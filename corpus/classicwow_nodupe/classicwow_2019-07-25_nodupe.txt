It's better for both games to be in one category. No matter what is going on with each game it will keep it more consistently at the top. Whether Retail has something going on or Classic just launched a new phase. More eyes on both versions the better for longevity even if we don't like Retail.

GET ON THE DEATHWING'S BACK
---
Gimme a hint, what is the last letter?
---
Can we get some estimates on how much pvp/week grinding it'd take to hit rank 10 solo?  I've seen a lot of people say you can do that "casually" but then saw one post that said it took about 6 hours a day in a premade for a few weeks to finally hit 10.
---
You‚Äôre gonna need it. Fuckin noob.
---
Since I'm duo lvling with a friend for my main and three other classes, I'll be forced to play something else when he isn't off or isn't up for playing. I'll most likely rotate those alts based on Rested Exp, but I doubt any will get that far before my main get's capped as I'll only have one weekend day for those guys.
---
Mage if you need that cast time break. Can also stand in place for the most part. I also suggest a nice wrist rest and light weight switches on a mechanical keyboard to avoid fatigue.

I still believe it'll take the average player at least 2-3 months to just reach 60. The average casual private server player/enthusiast will be hitting 60 in a month.
---
My time to shine! I have RA so I'm in a similar situation. When vanilla came out my symptoms had yet to manifest. Back then played mostly Rogue, Warrior, and Paladin, and none really gave me issues. 
---
Fast forward to the classic release date  announcement, I hopped on a private server to see what I wanted to play. I can tell you that the only thing I can reliably do without discomfort is heal. With healbot and other add-ons it's alot less stressful especially if you have certain fingers or movements that cause your flair ups.
---
It probably will be early on, but as the server progresses it'll become easier.
---
Thanks! I‚Äôll have to watch this later tonight.
---
I hope to see more druid representation in classic wow!
---
Does everyone on reddit work 18 hour shifts and sleep for 6 hours? Can yall really not find some time in the day to play video games or is this just a reddit circlejerk to make people feel mature
---
Don't do it solo, go with a premade. Even 9 other random people from world chat. Throw them into disc and you'll win over 90% of pugs.
---
Maybe just make wow your work?
---
In 1 month most guilds won't have even started to raid yet.  If you hit 60 in a timely fashion and start your pre bis there is a high chance you can be in a guilds first raid.
---
Ion said ~4 months from launch until BWL.
---
I think we are underestimating people's ability to get their friends into it, though.
---
It's hard to tell your friends to play an illegal private server of a 15 year old game and teach them how to do it.
---
It's easier to tell your friends to download the blizzard client to play a "remastered" version of a 15 year old game.
---
Also the extra mouse button on the top for your ring finger. Makes a good PTT button.
---
please god yes.  All the OGs at Blizzard are now gone (with a few notable exceptions) and say what you want about Disney, they don't make bad things.  Like....  ever.
---
As in 1vs1 I meant a friend on a duel no world pvp. Thanks for the tips.
---
Did they get rid of going behind the pillar to start duels in classic?
---
This reminds me of Daggerfall when it's synthed.
---
Thats why you kill the priest before the boat starts moving.
---
You're right.  These people are pathetic.
---
You're good. It's working in the current beta and there are no plans to change it back to the older naming policy.
---
Or end up in divorceüòÄ
---
You definitely want alchemy / leather working for their cds.  LW is awesome w/out skinning since you will mainly use for hide cd.  I would recommend rogue having eng / lw and lock having tailor / alchemy
---
Aye being pigeonholed into healing while also being the least desired healer is quite cool
---
SOURCE: tried to druid on pservers. Will not be doing it on launch

---
Enchanting isn't great as a casual since you won't be a guild enchanter so no rare recipes.  Also a lot of them cost a hefty amount or require a lot of farming for.
---
Lol. ‚ÄúThis is a stupider comment.‚Äù

---
I mentioned this to my colleagues and they had no idea. They are hyped to play too!
---
Frost until aq then fire for rest of game.
---
He didn‚Äôt want to get exalted with darnassus he wanted exalted with ironforge
---
There are specifics in each fight on when or when not to use cooldowns. These come from experience which is why you will see a rogue do 600-800dps on a boss while others are doing 400-500.
---
For a hardcore guild I'd except each class to know what to do on each fight. But that's not 99%.
---
Most guilds will have a CL. I'd say 99% will
---
&gt; What will happen post naxx?
---
It's probably worth noting that the question was what people actually /expect/ to happen post-naxx, not what they're hoping for. Rereleasing TBC is the most straightforward option for Blizzard, and a lot of us just have really low expectations from them and expect them to take the path of least resistance.
---
I'd really rather they not do a straight TBC rerelease and start down the path of replaying all the mistakes that led to current retail, but it's what I expect from them.
---
[removed]
---
This guy's pronunciation is aggressively incorrect. I mean well done for creating this content but FUCK ME, the Alturrick Mountains? I'm almost impressed
---
I do think the Blizzard people assigned to the project care very much about Classic.  
---
I think Activision is incapable of seeing beyond a profit spreadsheet and have no idea whatsoever what constitutes a great game. 
---
I think Blizzard proper, the suits currently in charge and beholden to their Activision tormentors, are flat out embarrassed that they somehow took one of (if not "THE") greatest games ever made and ruined it in the interest of profits for their corporate overlords.  
---
I can't imagine anyone in the company not wanting Classic to succeed.  But there will be a fair number of folks who are humiliated by the fact that the original game is far better than the abomination they've turned retail into.
---
Well, if there's no RPPvP servers at launch anyways and it comes later, there's no good reason why it should have layering anyways.
---
But my plan was to recruit RP style and talk to people in person so it might be a problem anyway, but the server putting guildies on the same layer actually works against me quite a bit.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt go so far as to say it‚Äôs a ‚Äúbad‚Äù way of playing. It may not be the most efficient but some people like to be self sufficient. Nothing wrong with that. But I do agree, for most it would not be worth the time investment to be completely self sufficient.
---
&gt;No one plays it!
---
Yeah it's funny how that works...
---
Engi for both
---
Great video. One thing I wish you would've done is actually talk about just how useful the PvP sets.
---
The rule of thumb is this: If your class is a dps class, you can probably just get away with using your raid tier sets for PvP. Rogues, Hunters, Warlocks in particular all have amazing T1 sets for PvP, and they only get better the further into content you go.
---
Everything in the PvP system can be replaced if you make it to Naxx. Unless you're going for r12-14, then ranking for gear is silly if you raid.
---
Hey if we‚Äôre talking about TANK ferals, that helm drops in AQ40.
---
But the shifty switcheroo helm. Oh yeah boi, if you want to dps as a feral you‚Äôll need it. The switcheroo is vital to their rotation if they even want to compete with similar tier players (like a fury warrior).
---
Heart of the mountain (blue trinket) isn‚Äôt for dps ferals though. Amazing for tanks.
---
I'm going druid (resto) I think and using my husband as a pocket dps. I've got radial tunnel syndrome, de Quervain's, and basal joint arthritis... it started getting bad when I was a hunter. I was messing around as a feral druid the other day and that was REALLY bad. I think it's because I use the mouse to move so much. Healer generally isn't as bad.  I'd avoid melee, personally. My hands are still angry about feral druid.
---
In his defense, his friends were in danger!
---
Feral tanks are fine. Their BiS for pre-molten core (before anyone steps foot in a raid) puts them higher than a warrior with pre BiS for MC.
---
If I didn't have a full understanding of how the ranking system works then I wouldn't know what he means. That's what I'm saying. Obviously since I know the system I know it's just poorly explained, but the video is meant for people who don't know the system.
---
You can easily get geared and be useful in pvp with all of those classes. If pvp is your main focus and you will be playing by yourself or with your rogue friend, hunter is the best class.
---
I would suggest leveling a hunter, and if you get to 60 and aren't loving it or feel like you want to play arms, roll a warrior. You'll have money in the bank, know the leveling paths, and be able to go back to your main to raid whenever you want.
---
Starshards is channel ability and feels pretty clunky.  I would rather wand then use it.  Dwarf priest isn't ridiculous at all, they have been clerics / priest / paladins / smiths in most fantasy.
---
I‚Äôve always wanted to play a Druid, but for some reason just never got to it. My best one in Cata got to 75ish. I‚Äôm considering going for it this time around. I‚Äôm not going to have time to put a ton into the game, night as well play something new and enjoyable.
---
Preach it radioactive man.
---
Pick your favorite class fantasy. It is really that simple. There's nothing worth than playing a class you hate just because it's "better" video games are supposed to be fun and every single class is useful in some way.
---
!Remindme 14 hours
---
I like how when asked for data, you provided none.
---
I also like that when called on your obvious sematic nonsense on equating ruining a stack with ruining ranking you respond with. "I have a full understanding" as if that means anything.

I'm looking for a class that will do well as a solo player. With my work schedule, I can't commit to a consistent raid schedule. So I want something that won't have issues pugging raids. Also, my main focus is probably going to be PvP. Lots of BGs and world PvP. I want something that can do well in both of those, and can 1v1 / 1vX. 
---
With that criteria, I was thinking mage, rogue or hunter...but I'm just not sure!
---
If you are enhance I would say orc and if elemental go tauren.  You can fire nova totem into stomp chain lightning for nearly unavoidable burst.
---
The Force Awakens was 100% a reboot of A New Hope.
---
People will be doing MC and Ony 18 months after launch.
---
In Vanilla people were doing MC and Ony up until TBC.
---
New guilds will spring up and start raiding all the time.
---
Okay, but druids are still trash.
---
What class are you going to play? Warlocks get a horsey.
---
We‚Äôll see. Private servers were as simple as clicking a link and copy and pasting one line. Even most of their big numbers were from China which will be separated this time from NA/EU
---
Who even plays on illidan as alliance?
---
The 58 set was removed early on and replaced with the final version. Blizzard is not reintroducing the old PvP sets, they said that we're getting the 1.12 itemization with item pools being gated behind content phases.

May want to cover the rares / elites with worthwhile drops next (regardless of rarity/difficulty), like the frost resist necklace in winterspring. Keep up the great work!
---
Check my edit :)
---
Most private servers found ways to make it impossible because it was just too broken. We will see if it's even possible on Classic.
---
They had one.  They changed the report options and now you just use like rule seven for everything.
---
I remember when I started I was like wtf is this giant pink bubble lmao
---
No, males have a larger range than females. Females may still have some sort of increased range‚Äîof that I am not sure‚Äîbut I can confirm from testing on beta that female Tauren have a shorter melee range than male Tauren.
---
I am downvoting as hard as I fucking can.  If you aren't one of the early 60s,  especially if you play druid or hunter, then you might as well uninstall.   You will only get into affecting guild with 15 hunters and druids that can't clear shit.

Pat, OG rank 14 tauren warrior. destroying everyone

If you're going for PvP you probably want engineering. Nothing comes close.

Maybe I should have said they were classics instead of masterpieces. That term certainly fits. I mean come on, head over to /r/PrequelMemes and take a look. How many 20 year old movies are still getting that kind of love today? The prequels had their flaws to be sure, but they still had the heart and soul of Star Wars.

Is it just me or is there an insane amount of warlocks this time around?
---
Lock has always been my main and I loved it so I've been trying to decide between lock and rogue (which I also greatly enjoy). I just assumed it would be like p servers where rogues are overpopulated and locks are on the lower end. However, looking at the guild recruitment discord, plenty of guilds posting that they are full on locks and still in need of rogues.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Being able to get loot and get into groups in general is important for me. Is it still easier to get groups as a warlock (compared to a rogue) even if many guilds are reporting that they're now "full" on warlocks?
---
Spiraling into debt, homelessness, malnutrition...not exactly a gun, no but I'm sure you could put 2 and 2 together.
---
Stop whining.
---
By far the biggest was shortly after vanilla launch.
---
The core of our guild was a group of about 25 people from a wc3 clan that had been going since the start of TFT (wc3's expansion). Most of the core in the guild had known each other for multiple years, spending entire weekends on ventrillo playing AT, tournaments and custom games.
---
Our guild wasn't super hardcore in vanilla, but we were basically middle of the pack progression-wise. We were fumbling our way through MC like most of the guilds back then, getting pretty close to rag/full clears. There was some obvious frustration from some of the members, especially the wc3 veterans who were mostly very competent gamers. A fair few of us were ladder ranked in wc3, which was a pretty big deal if anyone remembers back that far.
---
That frustration was then exploited by a hardcore group on our server that basically poached (or tried to) every competent player from about 10 well known guilds. About half of our guild's core shifted over to the new guild, with promises of hardcore prog, items raining from the sky.
---
It was even orchestrated in a way that there was no notice. Sitting in ironforge, there was suddenly 15+ /gquits at exactly the same time. 
---
The one that created the grudge for me was one of the players who left was my primary AT partner in wc3. We'd been playing together for 3+ years. When it finally clicked with what had happened, i messaged him basically asking wtf? The guild's mostly friends. You're throwing that away to chase purples?
---
His response was basically, you're shit, the guild's shit, i give zero fucks.
---
There were a couple of people that posted farewell posts on the old clan forums we still had running, real 'tear-jerkers' that i guess were supposed to sound sincere, but had this real thick blanket of smug 'i got invited and you didn't' air about them. Most of the replies were similar to what i said to my friend and were told they were never welcome back into the clan.
---
That single act crippled about 5 serious prog guilds, everyone on our faction fucking hated their guts.
---
Things simmered down towards the launch of TBC, and i remember encountering one player who was in our wc3 clan trying to complete an elite quest in burning steppes. I'd managed to solo it on my pally with the new greens and talents in the xpack, and he asked me for help. He bitched and moaned about how unfair it was that people in greens were basically as geared as their hardcore prog guild in a day from quest rewards, so he tagged the mob and i just stood still, watched him die and bubble hearthed with a 'lol noob' and a wave.
---
i'd say no.  maybe wait till next xpac, use the free boost and get in early and make a few mill in the first week just gathering and stuff to save urself a few hundred bucks... but not right now
---
Yeah of course there is gaps of data at the end there's not many people who get standing 1 and 2 is there? If the formula did not fit then this data would be OUTSIDE of the fit..
---
I really wanted to play a fire mage and did for like 0-30 and then again at 60. I love the class identity of a reckless fire mage hurling damage and death.  I ended switching to frost to try it out and honestly the control frost provides is unbelievable. It made playing the class sooooo much easier and I didn‚Äôt really lose any ability to provide dps for groups. Plus the survivability of ice barrier and ice block is crazy. Not to say frost does as much damage as fire, it doesn‚Äôt according to the numbers. But I didn‚Äôt notice a huge loss of damage while playing if that makes sense.
---
r/woweconomy.  You can farm gold very easily via herbalism/mining  or playing the auction house with the auctionator or TSM addon. You can easily farm enough gold in a few hours to pay for a month of wow time. 
---
If you use a character boost you should ‚Äúlock exp‚Äù so you don‚Äôt level past 110 and can farm gold much easier, and if I can recall any class that is in a Tank specialization does not get dismounted it hit by an enemy.
---
Buying BFA gives you a level 60 level boost in WoW Classic. Most people consider leveling in Classic to be the best part of the game, others disagree. Personally, I think it's worth it. At $50, that's less than $0.50 an hour in time it saves you.
---
If it is on sale, then buy it.  Get the mount too.
---
Oh okay, thanks for the tip?
---
Eng for sure
---
Maybe one gets herb and the other mining, so when you are doing WP you can be farming gold aswell.
---
Which rank unlocks the 2H sword?
---
There will be 2-4 hunters in most guilds and they will be brought to every raid.  Shaman is forced to heal in raid so there is that.  Hunters are always good in pvp and taper off in pve where shamans are pretty much oomkins until later stages.
---
I took the week following launch off.
---
Everyone will go hard the first week and then get taper off. I plan on going hard just around the time all the no lifers have crashed from their 5-6day binge.
---
Engineering
---
Thanks a lot man. I just do my best to make content i'd enjoy and briefly plug at the end. A lot of people out here rly trying to get you to sub without displaying any value. I dont get it.
---
Perhaps the leveling experience will be more pure for alts we pursue beyond phase 1.
---
Play druids they get handed gear since they are scarce.
---
Nope
---
The number of Orc purest on this sub lol. 
---
I've gotten in this argument more times than I can count just for saying there are situation where warstomp is better.
---
Boo
---
That sucks. 
---
At least it wasn't enigma or frostfire though, but still sucks.
---
Against most other classes for feeling like they are so much better (I mained resto shaman) =( was not happy.
---
You forgot Rohn the Silent in Redridge Mountains - who drops the leve 21 blue dagger blackvenom blade. I did some research and databases seem to not really confirm this but I remember people mentioning he had around a 20% chance to drop it and see comments akin to that in the archives forums and I even waited for days to find and kill him and when I finally did on my one and only kill I did, in fact, get that dagger drop. So either I got a very rare coincidence or it is really hard coded as a drop for him. I welcome anyone‚Äôs thoughts who has info on this!
---
Can we get descriptors on what each addon does? If you would so kindly...
---
14
---
The sword is pretty sweet tanking weapon.
---
I 3rd the scimitar,  best mmo mouse I have ever used.
---
If i roll a paladin will be healer for sure! 
---
Thanks for replying anyway!
---
At first I thought it would be a funny comment, as it was so cringe I could not imagine it to be real, but then I read everything and only the cringe remained..
---
Whatever is closet to being considered a twink weapon most likely. A lot of the mid range stuff isnt going to have a massive demand.
---
You can do mage and just bring a pally with you or do smaller pulls.  A single mage can aoe down cath in less then 10 pulls but with a prot pally you can probably do it in one.
---
Get good you 33 year old.
---
Did you feel you missed out a lot on something like a Stratholme run after learning about the lore?
---
I think this is a good video, I really liked it. 
---
Lol everyone says female Dwarves are ugly, but I never understood that because you can just customise it so they don't have the ugly faces.
---
Rise of the horde and arthas are two of my favorite books of all time
---
Don't. The rank 14 system is moronic, god awful game design, just plain a horrible system. 
---
Getting to low 10's is do-able with non-insane hours. After that it gets incredibly dumb. 
---
Rank 14 isn't about skill, it's about who can spam pre-made BG's for the most hours a day.
---
&gt; Advanced Target Dummy
---
Honestly I had no idea this was the case, gelkis for life. But I might look into seeing if I can buy an advanced target dummy when I go finish up deso around lv38. But it might just be too early for it.
---
I would never. Ever. Ever play with the stock UI it‚Äôs awful. I‚Äôm so glad ElvUI is being ported to classic.
---
Amazing!
---
Thats interesting. I have 0 experience with EQ. Were they more akin to dungeon bosses that required groups since the drops were so good?
---
Yes, someone who thinks an item is better for them *(and +int DOES help hunters)* has more of a claim to an item that a mage who has out-leveled the gear and planed to shove the item in their bank.  
---
If you had left it at, "Grumble, grumble fuck hunters" it would have been one thing but you kept this grudge going on for an insane amount of time and are proud of the fact. Straight up ruined every group you joined that this stranger was in and then offered help them only to kill a pet they were taming which is a top tier asshole move.  
---
Yes, you're the asshole.
---
12 hours depends on server. Mine had a lot of Chinese people who'd play the game for you so in the height of that one of our members in our pug hit 1,000,000 honor which is a lot more than 12 h a day.

It makes pretty much no difference at all. If shield lasts more than 2 seconds the content is trivial and you don't need to worry about min-maxing at all.
---
There‚Äôs an AddOn called TheoryCraft that basically sums up all of your stats from gear, talents, and race into a spreadsheet in-game and tells you how much int, strength, crit, etc. you have so you don‚Äôt have to manually calculate everything. A port or classic edition of this would be incredible.
---
Also would be nice to see the addon PvPLog brought back! It tracked your PvP kills and deaths and would track the names of enemies &amp; give you a tooltip under nameplates with scores (2-0, 5-3, etc.).
---
I play druid because I love topping the meters as the weakest healer.
---
would it be easier to reach higher ranks on pve servers?
---
Getting nodes was to easy. You could get out of combat by flying up so never killing mobs.
---
nothing =( hard to really focus on anything when all I care about is classic.
---
I‚Äôm still butthurt about a Shaman named Milkmustache on Deathwing killing me over and over in Hillsbrad in 2005. All of my main characters after that original one have been Horde because I have vanilla Shaman ptsd.
---
&gt; You can switch that based on what you're primarily using
---
Is that really prudent since it costs a few gold to swap talents? I figured you'd wanna just pick a lane and stick in it. I prefer swords (visually) over axes but I'd also want to use whatever is making me move along faster.
---
&gt;ww axe
---
WW axe?
---
&gt;Especially if you're orc
---
Rolling alliance probably.
---
What's the Addon where u can search your alts bags for mats and other things I feel like that should be on here (if it's going to get ported) considering Bank alts were a big thing due to bag sizes and how much crap u generally had to have on you at any given time.
---
Don't forget the shit bucket.
---
im rolling balance druid. I dont even care.
---
But.. they thought classic was a dumb idea before. Now it's a month away from release. They've already admitted they were wrong.
---
Yeah, I probably won't even be 60 by then lol, let alone BiS or molten core runs.
---
Interesting, i didn't know about not being able to reset with macro. I generally farmed Maura on private servers for gold on my hunter. Will you not be able to do some kind of tricks with inviting people and /camping to get back to entrance?
---
Following for advice üòÇ
---
Why is it easier to farm gold at 110?
---
Got it, makes sense now that i understand the mechanics of it. 
---
Thanks so much for the help and explanations! Can't wait to play.
---
For what it‚Äôs worth, I agree with you. There‚Äôs a lot of cool and unique things in vanilla that are cool to have, but everyone in this sub is so quick to dismiss everything for purely its value in gold.  Gold is useful but it isn‚Äôt everything people make it out to be....
---
Bad, he'll no,very
---
learn something new every day XD
---
FOR THE HORDE.
---
That is not how probabilities work.
---
I didn't mean change it based on what you're using at the time. Set it based on what you plan on using primarily as you level. If you don't use that specific type of weapon you just lose a slight bonus. No harm. I definitely don't recommend respecing at all while leveling. This build is just solid for leveling and a few of the talents give you a slight edge in PvP should you get attacked.
---
I feel like you're trolling, but I'm really not sure..
---
Skillful at dodging the truth this one is
---
It's not really. It's just not a word at all.
---
That's evil. I have a new goal for classic.

That‚Äôs not DR
---
Not a lot beats the joy of winning a big roll off but constantly losing them really gets to you
---
worst would likely be rogue and feral druid. Best, pretty much any caster dps or healer.
---
I can't recall any individual...
---
...but I vividly dropping whatever I was doing and camping individuals for hours in my rogue/druid until too many people showed up.
---
And that's how I learned that spending hours murdering people in world pvp was more fun than killing boars or AI dragons.
---
I keyboard turned and clicked spells way longer than I would like admit.
---
It was fun, there doesn't need to be more to it than that.
---
Sometimes what you see on your screen seems like someone is out of range but still in range server side. Lag on anyone's side can cause this. Spell leeway is a thing along with melee leeway that adds 2 yards to moving players.  To be honest no one can really answer this question besides blizzard. So my info is mostly speculation.
---
Not many regulars got beta invites.  Only a few wow lock streamers got in.  Beta shouldn't have any indication on how servers will be.
---
CTmailmod
---
Blood pressure is 160/110? Those are rookie numbers. You gotta get those numbers up!
---
There was plenty of DDLs the wowservers subreddit had a DDL link in their sidebar for years, still might
---
I don't think 2 million is that unlikely, for a first week high.     
---
      
---
* The total amount of people that have played WoW at some time is over 100 million
---
* BFA sold 3.4 million on its first day
---
* Nostalrius had over 700,000 accounts created  
---
   
---
I'm not saying you can draw any hard conclusions from that, but I think 2 million is in the ballpark, not some crazy dream.
---

---
He estimates the first couple of phase releases will be a couple of months and then they'll let community progression decide.
---
There is no threat.  We are getting Classic to play.  It doesn't matter what happens after that.
---
Shimmering flats is nice for levelling due to picking up all the quests and smashing them out, and the wpvp is insane
---
The best class fantasy is the one with Mind Control and cliffs.
---
I too played a a Night elf Hunter names xXxLegolasxXx
---
Seems like if your gear is good shadowguard is more dps than dp too, removing healing vs stunning from the equation. And obviously more dpm.
---
Rogues do extremely well in dungeon gear / easy to obtain raid stuff.  Mages without raid gear will suffer as will hunters.
---
I mean it should have *some* indication right? It's not just trash
---
Are they all just random drops off of anything in STV or are certain pages restricted to an area/type of mob?
---
It's very easy if you are hit capped.
---
Can always pause to read the stats if needed. ;)
---
True, many people had multiple accounts on nost though and the chinese were a mega population that just won‚Äôt be here (thanks to their gov), for whatever reason a lot of BFA people I talk to have no interest in it, like maybe 5 people out of my ~60 person guild is playing classic. This may go up though closer to launch
---
Confirmed? Because lightning shield is 4s. It took 12s to use all charges in vanilla, I remember clearly because its your best dpm spell and you need to maximise your 5s rule usage when grinding or levelling a shaman.
---
I had kind of the opposite experience. I had the piece from mc and was rolling on the eye from kazak when I won the roll amongst priests someone in the raid started arguing that since it was boe the whole raid should roll on it. It was a pug raid with only 1 or 2 from my guild so I had no pull. I linked the mc piece an raid leader said good enough and passed it to me. I almost died from joy and it resulted in me being one of the first benedictions/anathema on my server.
---
I don't play mages, but I've heard many times that PvP and PvE frost specs are very similar. Curious why you think they're different.
---
I was a druid in vanilla.
---
Can't recommend it.
---
This fear so much. I was always so worried about getting scammed I tried to only use guild or friend list enchanters
---
I personally prefer the default UI with a bunch of addons specific to their purpose.

Salvation and Kings woop woop
---
Same brother! I think we will be :)
---
As Alliance you can camp cliffs using shadow meld.
---
As horde you can be undead and follow people underwater and drown them since you have something like 300% breathing time.
---
Wait you can do that?!
---
OH I know... best DURID guide out there XD
---
Yeah. I mean say I'm a class lead and I play 5000 hours on my class. And your way is to have a warrior or a melee lead that plays a warrior tell the rogue team how to be as efficient as they can. It's easy enough to know a meta or tell people what to dps. 
---
But the rogue that's doing 200 more dps in the same gear or less, every single fight. Living to the end of the raid and doing his kicks and kidneys where required. This is the guy you want people to be able to come to, or friendly tips for that class on how you get that extra bit. What addons are helpful at the moment.
---
It also puts less stress on an officer team. While you class team can in itself be a whole social aspect to the game, with a designated leader for the class to bounce ideas off of.
---
That's brutal. I wanted that raptor so bad on my human priest but ended up getting it on my troll warrior. So dumb but I was still greedy enough to take it
---
Thanks, I missed this.
---
This is the best plan
---
Lol hilarious mission by them. Sorry to hear it caused you grief
---
OP, you wouldn't happen to know if it is possible to skip straight to Viscous Fallout boss? (possible stealth run?) I've read elsewhere you can jump down onto the large gear and he patrols nearby. 
---
Could you confirm?
---
IMO if this is any consolation, Druids and hunters are the best "casual" play classes. They can kinda just do a lot of different things in the game pretty quickly. Its also nice to be able to fill whatever role you want to play as well!
---
Pretty sure that‚Äôs his entire intent.
---
Topping meters as druid in anything in classic is just a good ass feeling
---
FULL SEND BOOMKIN baby!!
---
Gotta love players who contribute nothing but think they deserve everything
---
Lol well at least you only see 1-2 in a raid!
---
Be Night Elf and use shadowmeld to camp it.
---
druid sucks ass
---
Yes you can swap weapons in combat.  
---
For 2 and 3 [it doesn't sound like they last very long at all](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10847/dragons-call#comments).

Husband and wife running a guild? Sign me up, fam!
---
Hah, I'll imagine I'll do that :D
---
Awesome! I'm at work but will watch when I get home. Thanks for answer and detailed guide!
---
I don't think you know what the word *need* means.
---
Hello Micro-transactions!
---
HOW DARE YOU!!!
---
Awesome. This post triggered a memory of a guild I was in that had a similar rule. I GTFO asap and never looked back. I think that policy might turn off a lot of people.
---
Come on man
---
Especially if the wife is single.
---
The beta server had thousands of people on it. The 20 streamers were completely irrelevant to class balance stats.
---
No problem :D Scarlet Monastery series rolling out the next couple of days!
---
Started launch day as a Night elf rogue.
---
I probably spent like 4 hours just excitedly exploring darnasus when I reached it, picked professions.... learned to equip new weapons!
---
So on my first Gnomergan run I rolled (there was no need/greed only roll pass in the beginning)  on the final boss's 2h mace because it was soooo much better than my dinky dagger because I just though I would need to find the trainer to use that weapon type.
---
The paladin I won it over would randomly see me in Ironforge chat and tease me about that for *years*  but he was a good sport and didn't actually hate my guts :P
---
You gotta boof it for optimum value
---
Something about gnome rogue already made me dislike the guy lol
---
I work 120 hours sometimes during harvest and planting. Gotta love being a farmer ü§∏
---
I hibernate just for the luls
---
You think you do...but you don‚Äôt
---
It is good for pvp if you get lucky with procs.  It's not something you really bring to premades but if you get rag 2h people will bring you.  Even though you lose often it is a very fun spec to play.  In raids people will bring you if you have nightfall, but raid damage is very low.  The off heals are nice in 5 mans / ubrs.
---
I could see it being used to prop up subscription count. Just say ‚ÄúWorld of Warcraft has 4 million concurrent subscriptions and $X from micro-transactions for this month.‚Äù Without ever splitting either of them up.
---
We need to start worrying about when they are talking about Classic specifically in quarterly calls.
---
Yeah I don't know why 27th became the defacto date, aren't there way more NA players here?
---
Cool video. I also watched your other video on the analysis of 1v1 vs a warrior. I've been wanting to get into druid pvp come classic. 
---
Looks like you roll 19/11/21 for general pvp (feral for charge, resto for NS, and rest in balance)?
---
&gt;Dungeon rares merit their own video.
---
Sounds like you've got your next project!
---
I always enjoyed finding the gold farming bots. You could interrupt their circuit and watch them keep going spot to spot trying to farm stuff that wasn't there. Then I would report them after being sufficiently entertained.
---
MadSeason is the real mvp.
---
Im not going to dig up the comment but it was during the streamer invite interviews at the blizzard HQ. If you really would like confirmation you can scrub through those.
---
X isn't the server capacity, it's the realm capacity. The server could keep getting connections until it shuts down, the limit is in place to ensure a smooth connection for everyone. You don't want to run a 24/7 server at 100% load any more than you want to run your CPU at 100%. It cuts down on failures, maintenance, and increases stability. Look at pservers, you could feel primetime.

Wow. I dealt with some guild drama including one mass exodus like what happened to you. Really crushing feeling when you think all your raids work is shot and you'll never find replacements. The satisfaction of eventually repairing and getting that full clear is awesome though. Good riddance g hoppers. 
---
Hopefully the rest of your wc3 guild survived and you guys will be hitting the remastered ladder!
---
I don't see locks as being weak in PvP early on. One of their strengths is utility and control. They have that from the get go.
---
Personally I would only pick mage if you wanted to optimise for raiding. Otherwise lock hands down for variety.
---
Everyone on this sub is counting down the hours. You don't need to remind us.
---
Wyrmthalak will wreck a level 55 group. The rest of it isn't bad if you know how to do every pull, particularly in orc alley, so yes, key farming is viable pre 60 for sure. I just don't see any good reason to do it.   
---
The xp is negligible, so just level faster, and then run the dungeon faster. Same with every dungeon, doing them too low is basically just a bad idea. The slightly improved levelling speed from having the gear early is simply outweighed by the increased time it takes to complete the run.
---
For PvE you can pool for crusader procs. Just don't overcap and watch your swing timer if you're sword combat.
---
You'll be fine no matter what race you pick, skill and gear has a bigger impact than race.  In your shoes id probably go n.elf shadowmeld is damn handy in pvp and the 1% dodge is nothing to sneeze at for the minmaxxer.  Though speaking as a horde player there is nothing quite so demoralizing as dying to a gnome warrior.
---
I really don't like the idea of Disney owning more things....
---
You would be a fool to play on a PvP sea with reporters server trash.  They have no integrity.
---
the end killed the video
---
Take you tv time and your regular net time and use that. Some folks are like but the kids and the wife and well..   8 hours later still on the net, where is the time? :) Everyone WILL find time, or the time will find you :)
---
Well beta was what .1% of the playerbase if that, so no its not reliable at all.  Locks have a very bad early game and don't take off until 42 when you get deathcoil so with caps being 30 and 40 I wouldn't expect many to play lock.  They aren't 31 point spec classes.  Soul link is bad on its own since lack of damage.  Affliction 31 point sucks.  And conflag w/out spellpower is pretty terrible.  Also you don't even get soul fire until 48 so seduce nukes aren't good either.
---
Depends on if you're rolling horde or alliance. Horde does seem like it will have a lot, but still not more than mages and warriors. Alliance locks will definitely be in demand. Nobody wants to fear pvp vrs wotf.
---
Also, don't let the stats and surveys sway you too much. The people filling out those surveys and getting into guilds ahead of time are probably only going to be a small fraction of the playerbase.
---
The thing is that crowd says that every expansion and they are still playing them.
---
I'm a bad person and made a guy I didn't like from level 20 lose a rare pet spawn at 60
---
in vanilla it was a lot different in my experience, since then male dudes have opened up a lot more to female characters
---
Wait what, they're finally caving and launching a new server? Hopefully it doesn't go the way of red server but it's hard to imagine a split pop serving. :(
---
Well?  Don't keep us in the fucking dark, buddy!
---
Regrowth spec is a meme. I've talked with Druid players and pretty much all of them said that it's only useful in speedruns and still doesn't get you close to Priests/Paladins.
---
How did you consistently make that kinda respec cheddar as a priest?
---
Hi
---
It's so good. Try it. Trust.
---
Nah, his respawn was like 5-8 hours, IIRC. I would just log in every so often and /target to see if he was spawned.
---
Is he still active?
---
couldn't agree more.
---
&gt;prevent War Effort farming
---
None of the items for the war effort specifically come from Silithus.
---
Also, stockpiling those items for a long time is dumb, since the amount needed is in the tens / hundreds of thousands, way more than a single person could possibly stockpile.
---
Back when I first started playing in vanilla, I thought the high level guards outside of ZG in STV were actual horde players - I kept jumping around to try and get them to acknowledge me
---
There was a pretty infamous female nightelf druid on the og Shadowmoon-US server who would be seemingly everywhere at once ganking you. Kept it up throughout WotLK which is when I quit.
---
Fuck you Prayer...bitch.
---
It only eliminates half if he says heal, otherwise it eliminates none
---
The actual dick move is sitting in shadowmeld by the horde FP in Felwood and mind controlling people off the cliff. They're forced to either spirit res or run to their corpse and then all the way from Darkshore.
---
Yeah thats definitely in the future lineup. Kinda wanna do a race sequel to this video that was frontpage 2 weeks ago:
---
The people who are posting in discord are taking the game way more seriously than the average player. 
---
The fact that they need more rogues has got more to do with  having an optimal raidgroup (where you need more than double the amount of rogues than warlocks) than warlocks being more popular in classic this time around.  
---
On launch you'll see the same statistics reflected in the beta most likely.
---
It's not revisionism, zoomer. People rightly trashed TPM when it came out, and then wrote off the whole trilogy after the embarrassing AOTC. ROTS isn't good either, and saying it is is the real revisionism. All the prequels ended up doing was souring the public on Star Wars and making it even more of a joke than it already was for just being nerd shit before it was cool. That's why people consider the Disney sequels the biggest jebait of all time, but I guess that's what we get for thinking it could get any worse than Lucas's turn of the century fever dreams.
---
What type of server you play on? I played Night Elf which tends to make a good target, I guess, especially on RP servers where most of the casual horny guys roll up elves. I knew I should've rolled up a dwarf instead.
---
Probably because the 27th is a Tuesday, which is why I assumed it was the 27th until I saw this post...
---
Yeah I did the same thing.  Arthas‚Äô story isn‚Äôt really as epic as I‚Äôd hoped it would be. Basically most of his decision making revolves around ‚Äúmuh horse‚Äù lol. This is coming from an Arthas fanboy for most of his wow career.
---
I'm not your buddy, pal.
---
As a human alliance player, I always hungout in SW.
---
 Fuck IF. :P
---
2008.  11 years ago.
---
I played probably 16 hours a day. My professons were mining and engineering. Which is another gold sink so no help there. Constantly broke my Respec was 50g every time. 
---
I remember once not having enough to Respec on raid day and our MT who I was pocket healer for 10 hours a day gave me the gold. But really I had no fiscal ability what so ever. 
---
I'm not sure I ever broke 300g on that priest who had 180 days played when I deleted it about the time aq gates opened. So I may be the worst person to take financial advice from. But as I read in another post holy in the streets shadow in the sheets. Melting faces was addictive
---
Definitely in the future lineup, though i kinda wanna do a race/faction sequel to this first:
---
[Roasting Every Class in Classic WoW](https://youtu.be/Atj62np_gDA)
---
What is Disney doing with Star Wars and Marvel that Blizzard themselves haven't already done to WoW?
---
When I first started raiding my RL would often warn ‚Äúpat‚Äù. I thought she was patting me for doing a good job.
---
I think it's best to get one character to level 60 before you focus too much on alts, they can be a bit of a trap. People underestimate how helpful a max level toon can be, especially one that is raiding and beginning to really utilize their professions. Once you're there leveling the alts you've created along the way becomes so much more fun IMO, they don't struggle for gold or gear (BOE).
---
Leveling alts can become a bit of a trap I think
---
Wc2 took awhile to get used too. While wc1 was just way to clunky
---
5 boxing and leveling in instances... slightly slower than most but I'll have 5 60s, with all 3 roles available so seems worth
---
doesn't the same happen to SC 2 or am I tripping?
---
My biggest worry I guess for pvp servers is that all the most popular streamers will be joining those. If I can find out which ones there joining (most likely they‚Äôll wanna stick together) and stay away from those, then I‚Äôm going pvp.
---
Except stealthing BRD for the Barman Shanker is a rogue right of passage. You do it even as a sword rogue, just for the experience and to prove you can.
---
How much is it now?
---
Did you train the algorithm with a tracker?
---
I agree, I was pve, got my T2 finished just before Outlands was released. One problem is that your heal over time spells get overwritten by the druid with the most spell power and the other heals just can't compete with pally's and priests. Then people don't want you for a lot of 5 mans, you have no res or shackle. You can still do raids etc, just disappointing looking at the heal charts...
---
Being forced into cat mode for nefarian was the best thing ever though.
---
Yeah but then the poor rich men will only be able to afford 3 yachts instead of 5! Does no one think of them?!?!?!
---
Stopped reading at Marmite and soy sauce, what the fuck mate
---
I'm not your bro, amigo.
---
Dude I rolled against a tank for that last tank sword and he had the other one...and I was a rogue. I have felt bad about it ever since.
---
No experience whatsoever, but that sounds like a plan and a half.
---
Yes but it‚Äôs much easier than R14
---
I want to play classic.  I do not want to play classic but with.more dungeons,  a balance pass, and post classic mechanics.   Give me classic wow anyone who wants something else go post in the r/classicwowplus quarantine sub.
---
I'm not your amigo, compadre.
---
BRD &lt; LBRS &lt; strat dead/live &lt; ubrs/scholo imo. Most non end bosses are jokes compared to the trash. Scholo is lower if your healer outgears it enough that you don't need cc on the pulls with 2-3 shadowbolt volley casters/splitting ghosts, but gandling is still extremely random without an ideal group comp.  
---
If anyone in your strat live group hasn't been there before and won't listen, you're going to wipe multiple times btw. It's slightly easier than dead if everyone knows what they're doing, and much, much harder if they don't. The 9 gallants that appear behind behind you at various places will wreck you if you spawn them on your drinking healer. Breaking cc on a gallant while your tank is already handling one gallant and a battlemage doing what battlemages do can potentially kill them before the healer can blink. Inquisitors also manaburn for a ton, and if anyone stands near a doorway because they can't wait the extra 2s for the pull to be complete before they start dpsing, they're going to aggro a patrol, the patrol will aggro the next pack, and suddenly you're fighting 3 battlemages at once, which will at least be a very brief experience.   
---
I may or may not have once run it with a mage who clearly knew the place but spent the whole time screwing up and forcing us to cover for his mistakes. Said mage may have forgotten about archivist, targeted dathrohan, run up to his doorway, and started drinking. Archivist may have  then aggrod, and begin casting a very long, very slow pyroblast while the mage ignored me spamming in party chat as follows:  
---
'move back over here please'  
---
'move back'  
---
'come here'
---
'los'  
---
'lol'  
---
'hahahaha'  
---
'that looked like it hurt'
---
Nobody will obtain preraid BiS. It is theoretical shit for snowflakes. You can raid MC in greens anyway, just won‚Äôt clear it.
---
The warlord set for warriors on tauren is the best race and gear combo visually in vanilla imo
---
Frost mages. Plain and simple.
---
I get what you're saying, but then don't expect mages to just sit there casting a spell for you
---
some will, some won't
---
I bet you play as a gnome on Dalaran.
---
You literally just subbed to BFA retail.
---
Some show of support.

The reversal of the role here.

I was playing on a friend's account because I wanted to try out a high level Hunter, this was a few months into WotlK. Just doing some quests, deciding if I wanted a Hunter of my own. About 10 minutes into it I slammed with messages telling me I'm the most vile, despicable waste of skin on planet Earth. After a few minutes of telling this guy to chill out I log out. I ask my friend about it the next day. Apparently being a noob in vanilla he had successfully lead a group to down Onyxia, when she died he master looted himself every piece of gear, even though most of it he couldn't even equip most of it.
---
So that's the story of a 4+ year old grudge.
---
I'm not your compadre, partner.
---
That feeling when you know you are being kited but the urge to kill is so strong you keep chasing anyway.
---
no good guild is run like a strict government. the important people in guilds become important because they are likable by other people in the guild and it happens naturally &amp; gradually over time.
---
there are no "roles" the leader doesn't label himself a leader and it is just a group of friends.
---
So the gnomish mind control cap? That frees up basically every class then.
---
That's my plan.  List of quest in the zone and the improved quest widget.
---
Against my once guild leader and the guild's 2nd in command. Both of them were irl friends until they had a spat with each other. Couldn't calm tits; guild leader left and took half the guild with him; dropped from being one of the 3 guilds clearing Chromaggus and almost Nef, to being stuck on Razor for months again. Still hate those two fuckers with a passion thinking back on it, as they spoiled such a rare opportunity we had to be server nr.1 or at least nr.2. Was very painful to other guild members as well, as they didn't want to have to choose between which friends they'd stay or go with. Said guild leader was in hindsight a dick to my brother being a DPS warrior and other warriors anyway, legally stealing damage gear while he was the guild's primary MT, which he could exactly do because of that position as he didn't need to spend a lot of DKP and thus had lots of DKP left to spend on shit that only boosted his ego in PvP.
---
Haha I hope it happened when all the t2 helms had their ugly models in anyway. Did you ever ask if they regretted it or did they like the rep?
---
If you care about improving yoir equipment you ll get as much as possible.   I do think its an unreasonable expectation to have every piece, but showing up to raids with nothing but shit from lvl 40 quests is bad form.
---
Casual
---
They are good but not needed as a hunter till aq40
---
And you can dispel your own factions buff?
---
This guy knows.
---
It's only as important as your goals. As long as your goal isn't to win a server duel tourny, you'll be fine with no engineering.
---
Dwarf Rogue on pvp server.
---
Preraid BIS for many classes lasts a long time. you replace a few pieces in each raid tier but much of it lasts through BWL and into AQ.
---
Spotted the mom with the Autismo child.
---
Improved mana burn might be a trap as well and you might be better off spending the points into Inner Fire. I can't remember where but a guy posted his tests mana burning targets and noted that the difference was not worth the talent points. Just a thought.
---
&gt;hussah!
---
lol
---
This is where the difference between raiding 9 hrs/week and 3hrs/week comes in. Try Harding is the true casual.
---
Drinking beer through a straw sucks.
---
Not using the AH till level 40, and only using it to look good.
---
A million times this.
---
Yes but they will have easier time killing the nova totem since stomp is only .5 sec cast and grenades are 1 second I believe.
---
There‚Äôs no way its random chance. There has to be something in the hunter class that attracts douche bags and absolute morons.
---
They are wearing full naxx gear you sheep.
---
Ppl keep saying Razor, 2 years ago razor was a BOSS now days the quality of the product has declined and I can't recommend them. Logitech is still a solid brand. I currently use a G910 orion keyboard and have had multiple mouses. I'm currently using a red dragon mouse which are cheap and the quality seems sound after 2 years of use.
---
Classic is explicit confirmed.
---
On a non streamer/high pop pvp server I don't think it would be too hard. A normal server will have 5k of each faction, 10k total. Only about 2-3k will actively pvp. Only a few hundred will be try hard, and over time people who already got their high ranks will stop grinding. I think there will be room for everyone that wants r14 bad enough over the first 2 years.
---
I spend about 2-3 hours a week on food. We eat decently well. The trade off is eating the same three dishes rotated for six days straight. One breakfast option with yogurt as an alternative, two equal meals that can go for lunch or dinner. 
---
This week was lentils, turkey breast, roasted broccoli and cauliflower, or burrito bowl style shredded chicken, black beans, brown rice, and roasted bell peppers with cheese for my SO. I cook on the weekends for fun.
---
Meal prep is lifesaving. I admit to using rotisserie chickens frequently but roasted chicken breast works just as well for a little more effort. We both work 50HR a week and I have a chronic illness.

What's stopping the community from designated one of the pvp realms the defacto RP realm? Realistically, the only thing changing is player behavior and it's up to the community to uphold.
---
Ayyy same what country are you at?
---
Get foot pedals!
---
By your reasoning everyone should just play alliance cuz its ez mode.
---
My type of raider.
---
I know, but I don't have BFA. To be able to farm a token in a reasonable amount of time, I would need to buy BFA to be max level.
---
Prob at least 4 hours a day and more likely more on weekends. I tried it in vanilla and got to r10 and gave up because everyone thought I was depressed or dead so I had to come back to reality. Think I was doing at least 6 hours a day but that was a long time ago.
---
Literally do something crazy. Like, jump off of a building into a pool on stream.
---
Other than that, you're just gonna be another nameless face on the page of tens of thousands of 0-5 viewer streams.
---
I leveled a druid to max in WotLK for that exact reason lol

You but the wow token with your gold in your non classic account. Why wouldn't they be able to afford it? Heck I have close to max gold from farming I'm set for a while.

Dont you need bfa to even play classic?
---
Nah, even shitty countries have McDonalds!
---
BC druid was alot of fun.
---
What are the opinions on doing 5 into Cruelty then continuing to Arms. There's potential for a 40 Respec into MS and continuing.
---
I'm saving up right now for the first 2 months.
---
I read that in retail WoW it takes around 10 hours to farm a token.
---
Once the game launches I think tokens will be cheap because people want to powerlevel and be first to 60, so they will want to buy BoE epics by selling tokens.
---
No you just need a WoW subscription.
---
Druids can actually tank at level 60?
---
&gt;mfw he doesnt even know what knight-liuet is
---
It's just getting sadder bro.
---
That‚Äôs exactly what I did my first time around. I‚Äôm having a hard time overcoming the desire to do it again.
---
Sav dev delights! Yeah I have 2 accounts when nove 04 and june  06. My main old account has a stash of keepsake shit in there. I heard some of the shirts and stuff sell well.
---
Why silver+pine?  Before catalysm so few people leveled thier because thier where too few quests, not much to explore, and traveling between it and other low level horde zones was a hassle.
---
Ah okay. Sorry you dont have a main account with gold then :/. It was a problem back in 2006 for me when I didn't have an income I just asked for time cards as bday and Christmas gifts.
---
you're probably watching naxx PvP vids.
---
"The fuck's an alt?"
---
\- Many vanilla players
---
You don't need BFA to play classic.
---
How about we all come together and say fuck no
---
Shamans are good at most 1v1s.
---
Yes. But most have it and it's any sub as long as you have one. Sorry I did edit.
---
Do you know the name of bellows the bad?
---
You can PvP and PvE fine at the top level in the one healing spec.
---
Why silver pine?
---
It takes about 10 hours on a fully geared character where the person knows what they're doing.
---
Starting from level 1 with no heirlooms it'd take you a hell of a lot longer. Even on a fresh 120 theres a bunch of stuff you gotta do before you get to that level.
---
Either way, the WoW token wasn't in classic. If it's so easy to farm that gold in retail, just play retail 10 hrs a month and play classic the rest of the time
---
You can farm a token in about 5 hours with Legion content, which is included in a sub.
---
You don't need BFA to farm.
---
How long would you say it would take to start being able to farm wow tokens super easy starting from level 1 with no heirlooms?
---
Really? That's a relief, I thought that the difference would be two or three talents. Oh and another thing, would I have two different sets of gear for PvP and PvE?
---
Because you can't re-add them. Just find a guy who will regularly trade you some BFA gold in exchange for classic gold.
---
It's reasonable, and you need to be part of a solid group. I was part of my server's GM group until I hit rank 10 and I was playing nearly every day for about 4 hours or so at least. Anything above rank 10 and it gets REALLY nutty.
---
How in your opinion did they fuck up marvel? Marvel studios just broke the most grossing movie record with endgame.  Seems like they are firing on all cylinders in that category.
---
If you said Star Wars I'd agree with you
---
Assuming the person just starting out would even know how to play their class at 90.
---
And replace energy of the universe with moms tendies.
---
I spent hours in the elwynn mines farming Linen Cloth and then censoring it, for what we believed was a quick way to make gold and get rich üëç
---
It was a fair while later we discovered the auction house.
---
Dont they already have a lunch box? I swear I've seen one... anywho cereal also isn't crazy. I think what's more likely to happen is Overwatch related things, WoW isn't that well held outside of the WoW community
---
It's sarcasm, obviously they didn't.
---
Typically you carry a few pieces for PvP thats maximises stam at the expense of mp5/spirit, but really it doesn't matter that much. It's nothing like pally/shaman/druid which will be wearing a lot of cloth/leather in PvE gear and will need a mostly complete different set of PvP gear.  
---
  
---
PvE gear talented/geared holy priest will be very valuable in PvP, including top premades.
---
Solo will take a decent time investment in a group. God help you doing it solo as you won't have guaranteed wins like most pre made groups would.
---
The differences are so minor, in the end play what you connect to and like the most and you will be/do just fine.
---
True. How rare is it that someone is just starting now clean slate to play classic? I'd actually like to know the statics of this.
---
I mained mage in vanilla.  Great for soloing. Food, water, portals, strong ranged damage.  Great at farming gold (AoE or Devilsaurs).
---
Frostbolt spam gets a little boring in raids, but there's a decurse boss and sheeping boss in mc to keep things from getting too repetitive.   Also kinda sucks that you *have* to be frost spec for mc/bwl.  But hey, frost is great for pvp.  You'll be in demand for pugs.  More utility than rogues.
---
Go with hunter if you like the idea of a pet class.  Though I'm personally not a huge fan of pet classes because combat is boring when nothing is even trying to attack you.
---
Rogue is a slower leveler than those two but interesting.   Personally, it annoys me just how long the cooldowns for their utility abilities  are in ye olden days (yeah, you can spec Prep to help with those 5 min CDs, though it does have a 10 min cd).  That said rogue has a ton of great tools at their disposal, so there's usually something available to help.  And they're mean sons a bitches in pvp.
---
Ultimately I'd say any those can do what you're looking for.  Just depends if you find it more fun to stand from afar standing still  while casting spells, and using roots and whatnot to keep them from getting to you, or if you wanna be the maniac slicing the ever loving crap out of some poor sod's face and they just wet themselves while crying because they're stunned and quickly dying.
---
Ya let's ruin classic and have 95% of the players quit and hope the remaining 5% buys enough tokens to make the difference for blizzard's pnl for classic.
---
Yeh, it's not just mindless hate and memes. We have our reasons.
---
Not funny. Normies' humor :/
---
Won't make much of a difference seeing as this is all done in battlegrounds anyway.
---
I really like what a hot druid brings to the raid in form of, save one shots, more effective tank hp as 2 more hots is really strong any time things go sideways, pretty much assured healing for tanks
---
Thanks for the heads up
---
My 70 year old co workers know what twitch is. Everyone knows what twitch is its a multi billion dollar entertainment company owned by amazon. What in gods namd are you talking about

Bought one recently as my WoW Legendary Mouse started dieing out after only a year. I SUPER recommend this mouse. The ring finger button is one of the best tricks to playing extended times. Set the ring finger button to Shift or Control and BOOM your amount of buttons are doubled with almost no finger effort!
---
I was in STV on my first character, a mage, when a weird sword dropped.  It was blue, but had no stats, so I assumed it was trash and DEed it.
---
It was The Dazzling Longsword.
---
This is probably where I should point out I am colorblind.
---
I only even remembered it because it gave me, like, 4 large shards, and that was pretty weird to me.  When I discovered what I did, many weeks later, I felt sick.
---
You are forced to go frost for MC/BWL.  Lava monsters are surprisingly  resistant  to fire,so you don't do *any* damage to them.
---
&gt; 4:06 no it is not 0.003%, it is 0.3% And if you had 5000 with only 0.003% that would make it 0.15 people get into the bracket 1
---
What? No it doesn't. 5000 * 0.003 is 15.
---
Absolutely no apologies. They just said "sorry we didn't know" after I explained it to them during the run.
---
Disney ruin marvel by... Making it one of the not profitable movie studios??
---
Seconded. If this were possible I‚Äôd be doing it to fill all my gaming time before classic
---
Of course not, unless you somehow trick them into dueling you. Offensive dispels (purge, priest dispel+the few others) can only be used against enemies.
---
&gt; Even 9 other random people from world chat. Throw them into disc and you'll win over 90% of pugs.
---
I've had the opposite experience. Discord does very little at a low to med skill level. The team with better players will always win. Picking up 9 random people has never worked for me. I ranked twice on pservers, that's been my experience.
---
I had far far more success and inviting the best players I could find and not using Discord.
---
Loved it. You definitely understand comedic timing my friend, I just subscribed.
---
the AH
---
I cannot remember a damn thing about Rogue one and I watched it like 2 or 3 times. Also seen TLJ like 3 times. TLJ is fucking shit and killed Star Wars,rogue one was just crap and the solo movie sucked.
---
In 1.12 meta shadow loses to many classes after aq40+ gear
---
Mages, rogues, Locks and wow shamans destroy spriest st 1v1 in this meta.
---
Well I managed it while farming gromsblood and ghost mushrooms in Desolace, every other circle I'de stop and kill this group of dryads near the horde town for a couple of silver.
---
Can they tank while leveling? I thought only druids or warriors could.
---
I would say troll is better for wpvp but ud is better for 1v1. To each their own.
---
I spent $50 on 1g
---
Nope, can't say as I do. I don't believe I have ever rolled a gnome.
---
2006, I was 13 and havent played any other rpg before. I played a tauren hunter called ‚ÄûTaurenhunter‚Äú (üòÇ) with BM talents. I did more melee fighting than range combat with the hunter... and NOBODY questioned my decision. I was in a guild that later turned out to be the best guild on horde on that server (Germany, Malfurion) but I stopped at 56 since I wanted to play Counter Strike and actually got into a legit team that had success in amateur leagues... never levelled the poor guy to 60, still dont know why I rather started ne characters.
---
Ok that's pretty bad lol.
---
Druid is great in PvP, don't worry.
---
Good survivability, good team support, you wear people down or surprise them with a big crit.
---
The best part is you use all of your abilities and have a big potential for outplays.
---
That I got into it right before the expansion and missed out on all that true vanilla goodness.
---
Yikes. I'd have been fuming
---
It really doesn't matter man, after a while you only remember the times you caught them with their pants down. :P
---
Hour wise lvl 40 on a first character is the beginning of the game for so many. Not only raiders
---
grocery stores, uber, waiter at restaraunt, they have shipt where you do shopping, that service where you deliver food from tons of different restaraunts, donate blood/plasma x times a month, janitor, etc. Get something while you wait for whatever work you are probably looking for.
---
It's always going to be highly useful in pvp, the absolute best profession for it. But as for pve, it's not going to be highly useful until a few phases in aside from the force reactive disk for tanks.
---
The goblin sappers are the big ones and they're not going to be very useful in MC / Ony, both due to the AoE packs not being that intense or common as well as being massively resistant to their fire damage.
---
TL;DR engineering's big for PVP at all times, but not as useful in phase 1/2 for PvE unless you're a tank or throwing gold at the damage meters.
---
5 for 10 levels... And all big enough to split into 3
---
Are bgs cross realm?
---
I‚Äôm gonna have like four or five days off work at the release of classic, although I‚Äôm planning on going hardcore during that time :p so I wouldn‚Äôt really be classified as casual

Prioritising the game over other things in life and not playing in moderarion.
---
Osconty and I have been playing since the 16th, bud.

I had a friend who literally stopped talking to me for 9 months because of a difference of opinion over an upcoming patch change to power word: shield.
---
Oh I was as angry as my 15 year old self could be
---
Eat while you play?
---
If I‚Äôm able to keep up I‚Äôd roll with ya. What‚Äôre you rolling?
---
Its unfortunate, but due to the non-legacy client the game will be running on, Add ons will run rampant.
---
I tried to get into Rebels,but that is an actual children's show and I just can't do it. The reboot of attack of the clones was great tho but obviously had a more broad target audience.
---
rip, i didnt catch that. my bad
---
I remember his exact words when I asked.
---
"I had no idea what I was doing"
---
Pretty sure you can flick with any mouse, including an MMO mouse.
---
You can't read.  Comparing an alliance druid vs a horde druid in a vacuum makes no sense.  You have to compare them within their faction.  Even a dumb child would understand this.
---
I‚Äôm just waiting for someone to trade/convert gold. 100,000 current wow gold for 100 classic?
---
on my pserver tune up run i sided with the gelkis, didnt realize that was a unanimous choice lol
---
still too far away, grumble grumble.

Why not try to coordinate your two groups of friends into one server together. Could be a good way to bring your friend groups together, which in my experience can definitely be a tough thing to do.

# &lt;Lifers&gt; NA (CST/EST) - Alliance - PVP - Hardcore
---
**&lt;Lifers&gt;** (new guild formed from members of **Alixium**) is a new long term hard core guild with ties to strong groups of active players and roots to the beginnings of classic wow, both private and retail. We am seeking more like minded individuals who are looking to create a well structured raiding guild, permanently. Individuals should aspire to be an extremely active player and remain extremely active most times as a normal raider. **Past classic experiences are not required for membership** but are required for an officer position.
---
Officers will be held to a more active playing schedule than an already extremely active raider. This means things like leveling multiple characters, having multiple accounts, always being prepared for themselves and others, being way ahead of the curve in content and gear, being extremely active and competitive in pvp and consistent with community communications.
---
Strong PvE focus and are setting up premade groups for Rank 14.
---
We are wanting to have a huge guild to form 3 Raid groups (120+ members) and plan to clear MC by the 3rd-4th week. We are pushing for server 1sts for BWL progression and above.
---
Raid times **(T/W/Th)** will be active from **7p-12a EST**. **The first raid** will be from 7pm - 10:00p and **the 2nd will be** scheduled for **9:00p - 12:00 midnight**. **3rd Raid group is TBA**
---
Server selection will be either Central or Eastern.

A rogue named Schnoodle on US Blackrock stole my Ghostshroud from the chest at the dwarves event in BRD.
---
lol i remember some guy kept trying to join a friend and i duoing in the Alterac area of hillsbrad. We wouldn't let him, so he starts verbally abusing us in all the standard ways, "f*gs," etc.. So I replied "yes, that's right, we're both gay. We'll let you group with us, but we get to do you in the butt." The guy successfully reported my reply; it was my one and only game suspension.
---
thank you for making me laugh
---
i really didn't expect that there are dumb enough people to compare random world drops to the best gear you can earn through months of raiding, seriously. 
---
thanks again.
---
Kinda tame story, but it made me laugh.  
---
I was pracicing my leveling route and this hunter kills me in Thousand Needles.  I am bored, so I kill him.  We are building some animoisty, and I decide I will take the rest of my day killing him.  He teams up with arious people to make it harder, but I just lurk for hours killing him. 
---
At some point, my son sees him kill me, maybe missing the hour or so I was an equal jerk to the guy.  He is 10, knows little about the game.  But, he loves watching the guy's pet die.  I tell this to everyone from my faction that stumbles upon our PvP and we kill the pet first every time.  We camp their body.  We do everything.  My kid watches it, and he just loves it.  Eventually the guy runs to Tanaris (me killing him along the way).  My son actually wrote his name down and asks me if I saw him again every week or so.  I actually found his corpse once days later and just sat next to it stealthed until I realized he must have logged off dead.  
---
No reason for the animosity.  I just was willing to spend hours from my day to ruin his because he killed me once and I really had nothing else to do.
---
They aren't cross realm, no. I was on a PVE server in classic, there were plenty of hard-core PVPers around.
---
dear boy, I suppose you were about 10 years old when T3 was relevant.
---
so don't try to be smart.
---
Just play on a pvp server. World pvp is so fun. You‚Äôll never fully experience so many zones like stv, hillsbrad, and Tanaris on a pve server.

War of the Ancients trilogy and Lord of the Clans (Thrall's life from birth to orc leader) were amazing.

Also, I bought Chris Metzen's "Of Blood and Honor" ebook over a DECADE ago. Yesterday I tried to open it. DRM protected. Fuck! I don't even know what company I bought it from.
---
I think it would only be beneficial to play with your current account.  Where making a new account would add no positive affect.
---
Play Resto Druid and HoT yourself and run away as a cheetah :P
---
Udnderrated
---
I'm definitely not just in case they ever merge the playerbases through some weird compromise/re-make.
---
Yeah, that's what I thought. Terrible fucking advice.
---
I was 1 of 2 Resto Druids in Vanilla and had a ball. I think myself and the other guy kind of stood out amongst all the other raiders and we became the guild mascots.
---
He finally starts looking at actual items in his bags at 5:10 or so if you want to skip to that.  
---
Before that he chooses a name, gets a bunch of achievements, and then checks his mail.
---
I appreciate posts like this, thanks for your input :)
---
First thing I'd like to address is being a rogue counter. I agree that hunters are also a great counter to rogues with a similar toolkit to prevent them from running/ re-stealthing. Warriors charging in? Gouge/ Blind/ Kidney ----&gt; Sprint away to reset. Locks? They can throw some dots up, sure. They can't keep up with a rogue if they try to run away. Same with priests. Rogues? Uhhh sure? Shamans have ghost wolf to keep up... with a cast time and they need to get close enough to shock (which has a 20yd range, shorter than other caster DoTs). 
---
FF has the best of both worlds. 30yd range and even thought it's not a DoT, it lasts 40 seconds. It may not quite be Hunter's mark good but, its still really good. Rogue tries to run? Lol. Instant travel form with PvP set bonus movement speed? + Feral Charge? GL. They try to run in for blind? Pre abolish or stay out of range while keeping MF/ IS up as he rots.
---
I guess the point I'm trying to make (respectively of course) is that even though other classes can prevent a rogue from stealthing for a short period or time.... Druids are SIGNIFICANTLY better at it compared to other classes maybe except hunters of course. A 10 second dot is not nearly as bad as a 40 second prevention. They shouldn't be able to run unless the druid gets outplayed.
---
Oh, I also agree that the jack-of-all trade characters aren't going to be #1 on everyones raiding list. But there's no denying that druids aren't NEEDED in raids. Utility alone between innervate and B-res makes them worth it whether they put up the all-time best numbers or not. Having the ultimate rank 1, meter-topping warrior DPS is amazing and all don't get me wrong. But all that dps doesn't mean anything if your tank dies and the boss ends up wiping the raid. Like you said, to each their own.
---
Respectfully, I would rather recommend a fun-playing class to a new player over playing a class because they can min-max end game numbers harder. But we can agree to disagree :)
---
**Significantly harder** on PvE servers because there are less pvp'ers in the pool. The more players, the more people can be in bracket #1, #2, etc.  Players need 15 honor kills to be in the pool.
---
Was just really into undead areas. Also really liked sfk
---
It's funny because one of the main friend I made in vanilla was a hunter. He was soooo dumb. And a huge troll but that's what made him fun. Was down for whatever crazy scheme. Sneaking into enemy capital cities whatever he was down. But I always remember cringing when he would ask to get in voice because I'd have to hear his stupid shit.
---
They can definitely make pretty decent tank healers for sure. Just have to coordinate with other druids to not overlap HoTs since they don't stack!
---
Just jump on retail and farm keep tokens out of classic.
---
Exactly
---
Of coke?
---
So... Basically exactly the same as Blizzard?
---
That seems like a really good plan, ty.
---
Ive always loved summoner classes in rpg games whether it's zombie, demon, pets or companions, the more the merrier. I can't decide between warlock and hunter. To my understanding they both can only have 1 pet active so quantity is not a contentious point. So far hunters pets can be unique so that's a huge plus for me, wondering if there's sth I don't know that would away me to either?
---
No, I don't. I ruined my life trying once already.
---
I am going to solve the problem by getting ride of the green block. Works every time.
---
What is the point of that? You‚Äôll be paying for the a sub and have access to retail and classic either way. There is literally 0 point to doing this other than your email and password being different....
---
Druids are awesome man, I think you'll enjoy it.
---
I just made a video about my top reasons why i'm rolling one too. I think you might enjoy it if you want to check it out sometime, best of luck!
---
Here's the link: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpJu0qzQCgY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpJu0qzQCgY)
---
Idk, you would be giving up fear ward, desperate prayer, and stoneform just for the occasional shadow meld play and some potential use for star shards (maybe if you are shadow school locked?)
---
I got 2 weeks off but will work the first 3 days it comes out. I'm hoping I'll have a bit easier time with the starting quests as it will be packed for the first bit
---
If you can roll orc always roll orc. 
---
If you are a priest roll troll. 
---
If you are melee and cannot be a orc be a Tauren.
---
If you are a dps and do not fit the above situations, role troll.
---
For sure. You‚Äôll have the easiest time if you name the character after your username. Nobody fucks with ragnar
---
I got two weeks off, but not solely for classic. I actually need to take some time off cause I haven‚Äôt taken any time off in almost 2 years, and coincidently the best time for me to do so it the end of august because others are taking time off right before and after I do, so it worked out on its own.
---
More like 250k for 100g
---
I actually intensively farmed and bout a second black epic saber before the shity ass anime armor change. 
---
OI hung on to it for years and it was probably low key the single most valuable trad-able item in wow until blizzard randomly fucked me over with their changes to riding/mount  where they moved the expense to the riding skill, and made the mounts soulbound.
---
Then I later went and got my account banned anyway.

I hope you enjoy your much needed time off!

Wake up.. it's a cash grab.
---
I'm maining a hunter with a rogue alt I'll be able to deck out easy. Cause hunters are master gold farmers
---
Yeah you would typically only have a single druid spec this way.
---
Starting off as Nelf Warrior. I chose it because I wanted to use the duel wielding glaives like illiden cause I thought they were in the game, but wasn‚Äôt sure which class could use them so since Warrior could use almost everything I chose that. Hated it, it was a boring grind and I didn‚Äôt enjoy a lot of vanilla because of that choice. Now I know better and I know exactly why I didn‚Äôt enjoy it, and will not make the same mistake.
---
Hey Voxxel, I glad I found another druid brother. I'm actually currently working on a video that talks about this. But its really just specific to the class/race combo itself and not too much outside of it. Mainly because theres so many other reasons!
---
I did just finish a video about the top 5 reasons i'm rolling druid if you want to check it out here, feel free brother. Hope this helps. Best of luck!
---
Heres the vid: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpJu0qzQCgY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpJu0qzQCgY)
---
It will depend on the server and faction population aswell. I ranked up to Bloodguardist with hardly doing any PVP. That was prior to the battlegroups to be fair, not sure if those will be there in Classic. 
---
Server I was playing on had a low population and Horde was heavily outnumbered on top of that, so ranking up was pretty easy up to ~rank 10
---
I will have four days after launch clear to play as much as i want but i still have no intention of rushing or playing the insane amount of time i did in classic it to to unhealthy physically and mentally. I expect the first week i will get at least 35 hours in and likely average 25-30 a week after that.
---
What about BlackVenom Blade from Rohh the Silent in Redridge?
---
How about you fuck off back to retail OP
---
Not a bad goal. I‚Äôll probably average less than that honestly after the first week if I even put in for leave the first week.
---
Lol. I've read so many horror stories about hunters in this thread. I can only imagine it's actually hard being a hunter trying to get a stat stick that warriors also want.
---
Priests are a hardcore bunch
---
&gt; What's unreasonable about that?
---
If you are asking retailers? Communication and socializing with another human being. They loathe the social aspect of an MMO and will do anything to avoid it.
---
Do itttt
---
Avoid these: http://www.avoidstreamers.com/
---
He's talking about percentages while showing these figures in the video, buddy. If you can't infer those figures are percentages then that's on you. Either that, or you enjoy being pedantic on the Internet to make yourself sound smart?
---
I'm also questioning you throwing all those numbers around. Why are you multiplying 0.00003 by 5000? That equation makes no sense, you don't understand how percentages work at all.
---
I miss figuring out good mobs to kill for my level. Still annoyed they fixed those gorillas
---
thats a 10/10
---
Warlock can also only have 1 active at the time right? What are the different demons he can summon? Is it fair to say in terms of pet utility warlock summons are more diverse and in terms of pet looks hunter is more diverse (with the option of unique)
---
There‚Äôs a lot of truth to that. My friend and I picked Executus. Sounded bad ass
---
You did the right thing OP
---
Just pick the type of server you want and create a character you can keep a eye on this site if you want to try and avoid streamers https://www.avoidstreamers.com
---
Yeah I am, because I want to see the launch and how insane it will be.
---
I'm taking 2 days off for some fun, aiming to play for 6-7 hours a day for those days then going back to 3-5 hours a week sort of play.
---
Let us dream!
---
yeah no mate
---
The reason, is for the same reason they did it in the first place. To fly the RP PVP flag, because it's a different way to interact with the content than is represented by RP and PVP. Honestly, why RP is by default "normal" is beyond me, as PVP would should have been the default.
---
Bgs are cross-realmed both in vania 1.12 and Classic.
---
Idk about you but I dont need to be in a meditative state to enjoy my pizza.
---
Definitely depends on what you want to do. I personally liked PvP, and the idea of being able to attack players and players attack you sold me. Lead to some exciting times.
---
For those who want a list
---
&gt;  Hybrid Class - Jack of all, master of none
---
I would say you didn't touch on the benefits to a hybrid.  You can tank, heal or DPS dungeons.  Makes it easier to find groups and get your gear instead of waiting for a tank/healer in town, you can be that tank or healer.  
---
They're still one of the best at getting high armor for pure mitigation, but they still lack tricks that warriors have up their sleeves for tanking.
---
Leveling is nice as well since you get cheetah, also have seal form for swimming.
---
&gt; Underrepresented/underdog class - less druids means less practice against them in world PvP.  
---
While you just focus on world PvP, it also means less druids in your raid.  So at least for Druid sets you will only be competing against a couple other druids.  Specific druid feral gear is will go to you as well.  You'll still be competing with paladins/shamans for some non-class specific heal pieces, but you should get leather priority.
---
&gt;  One of two classes that can stealth, can pick fights
---
Stealth runs are also another big thing. Find a rogue and go do stealth boss runs.  You can do all druid boss runs and have tank/healer.
---
&gt; Kiting and class counters - knowing how to kite, also have a counter to rogues with faerie fire
---
&gt; Most fun class in the game
---
hey, this guy wants the hunter class all to himself for some reason!
---
Feral is also quite high skillcap in PvP. Compared to rogue or spriest anyway &gt;&lt;
---
I think 200k will be the top end. I‚Äôm hoping my guild is still going then. Once meme spec players realize that the internet wasn‚Äôt just being elitist, and people see how infrequently they will receive raid loot, people will trickle off. If it can maintain 200k for a year that‚Äôs a huge win in my eyes.
---
except if you‚Äôre someone who likes to play competitively (nothing wrong with this either). The. play a class that holds you back is very frustrating.
---
doesn‚Äôt work

---
Gnome or human mage, I played from start of BC to Legion. My first 2-3 years was alliance, so I am looking to relive that nostalgia.
---
I had a gnome DK alt for a while, I did not find the race as annoying as some would find. However, I have not played Human and figured that would change things up nicely. 
---
Just how big of a disadvantage am I at here for decent amounts of raiding and lots of PvP? If I'm playing semi-seriously, is that extra Intel etc a deal break in your opinion? 
---
Thanks.
---
Lol perfect
---
Having a kid. It really derailed my time to play. Fortunately he's 14 now and I thought I was going to get a second chance to relive what I missed and have him play with me. However, earlier today that little shit told me wanted to play on a pve server. I thought I was a decent parent and can't see how I raised him to be a coward and a loser but here we are. 
---
So with that said my son is my biggest regret.
---
F
---
!remind me 32 days
---
Attempting rank 14 i only made it till 12 and quickly realized i bit off more then i could chew. It just took the fun out of pvp for me and was extremely unhealthy. This time around i will try to just enjoy the game more and be the guildmate who is always helping everyone. Going to keep my raiding down to a casual level.
---
This is the kind of validation I came here for!
---
!remindme 32 days
---
I like it, I‚Äôve got to be much healthier than my teen self was now lol
---
Based on the age of Warcraft target demo it would absolutely be R. No kids know what Warcraft is they are part of the fortnite (shit) gen who could careless about an MMO
---
Fucking Sims flashbacks
---
my one piece of advice is just don't play runescape
---
The reason you side with Gelkis over Magram is that the Gelkis enemies are much harder to kill solo and it's substantially slower to side with Magram as a result.
---
My post asking about addons got deleted Idk why :( I hope your post stays up as I really need this info too and I think so do alot of people. We could all use a good addon guide.
---
Nah there‚Äôs enough movies for kids not to make this into another hunger games bullshit
---
That I never married my wow gf
---
Never played any version of wow ever. Plan to jump in once classic is released. I want to play on a pvp server but I'm pretty casual and not to uptight about min maxxing. Just want to have fun. 
---
I have narrowed my class choice down to warlock or Paladin. Not sure which to pick. Which one will be in higher demand for pve content and make it easier to find groups?
---
Cold bagels with spinach and artichoke dip.... Yea.... Gross....

Tell that to the marvel fan boys I argued with that they are morons for paying to see each and every garbage B list super hero movie Disney puts out. They are all essentially the same movie and plot with few that stand out in the crowded genre.

Ah man a 15 minute video, I'll take your word for it haha. Thanks for the link.
---
I would like Blizzard to fix and balance the game, yes
---
I originally started playing WoW after talking with some guys in a warcraft 3 custom games lobby. I had heard a bit about the game and asked them something along the lines of "Shamans are op i guess right?" So I decided to play a shaman. I leveled a troll shaman to level 14. One day I came to play and my shaman wasn't there. Looking back I don't know if my character got deleted or if I accidentally logged into another server. For some reason 15 year old me though "well that's that" and I made a dwarf hunter and started leveling him.
---
I never got the chance to apologize to my troll shaman for abandoning him
---
(#nochanges btw)
---
I went and checked and you're correct.  Good looking out.
---
ya man haha my 9-5 job leaves me with 0 free time either haha  not even enough time to scratch my toe before im back in bed and going to work again haha xd relatable epic maymay
---
I fast for 16 hours a day and eat for 8. I‚Äôm going to make sure all meals occur while I‚Äôm at work to maximize at home playing time.
---
I'm really curious why this topic keeps creeping up.
---
Are you trying to make yourself look like you are so anti-retail that you want your Classic account to have nothing to do with it?
---
There is literally no benefit to make a new BNet account.
---
My favorite will always be the video that inspired me to roll my Warrior, [Maydie](https://youtu.be/SwSR1SHYZRI).

---

---
Cereal sounds dope what kind does it mirror? Lucky charms?
---
Yeah, either one. I feel there's slight connotations differentiating the two.
---
Little do you know, they are actually all telling stories about the same hunter.

When I was playing WoW as a kid I was plowing through pizza bagels and mountain dew; This time It'll be baby carrots and water. I shall become the garden rabbit I was always destined to be.

I got told twitch before my question was removed by mods, but I can't find classic addons on there. I did find this site though:  [https://willitclassic.com/](https://willitclassic.com/) 
---
 If anyone knows how to get the classic addons from twitch I would be really grateful for a how to guide.
---
Yea, idk about that. Breaking a leg sucks, nothing is convenient anymore. Even standing up from your computer chair to stretch or take a piss is just annoying and potentially painful.
---
Here we go again with fan boys who claim just because they are all under the same ‚Äòumbrella‚Äô that they deserve to be all counted towards the same movie, which is garbage Logic. But you‚Äôll never hear the end of it from a true marvel fan boy junkies. They don‚Äôt listen to logic, and certainly don‚Äôt read reviews of some of these movies that were not well received at all

Honestly it depends on the server, many servers don't have tbc xp rate. As for tbc values on weapons, i don't know any vanilla private using patch 2.0.1 items
---
Ok sweetie I don't know whether you failed your high school math classes or you're just American, but you should really look up a percentage to decimal converter or something. Maybe go over how to calculate with percentages too.
---
would you suggest grid and clique? I heard I need healcoms. I plan to roll a preist so this is gonna be a thing for me.
---
I can think of a good few regrets throughout Vanilla that I corrected over time, like changing region, switching main etc etc. But in the end the biggest regret is probably how it took me way too long to figure out that I'm not a healthy leader for a guild. I ran the gambit of being officer, raid leader, guild leader etc but looking back at it I can see now that I probably did as much harm as good. Not that I was a dickhead or anything, but just sort of oblivious to the bigger picture. Although I definitely was too much of a pain in the ass to some people at times as well.
---
During vanilla mountain dew and pizza now black coffee water and home cooked meals.
---
You do realise you could contact a gm and ask him to return your character?
---
I don't remember anyone pissing me off enough in vanilla to actually form a grudge, let alone hold on to one. But then again, I played Horde.
---
Iam betwen a priest or a warlock :c i love both
---
Yea, no worries. I‚Äôll just stick to raiding and slightly hardcore pvp. The grind to reach those ranks, I didn‚Äôt expect that honestly. I mostly twinked anyway back in the day.
---
Not being able to kill KT. We wasted soo much time on 4HM because no tanks (if i remember right, like 6-7 weeks), then when we started working on KT the TBC prepatch came and ppl lost interest in killing KT.
---
Almost everyone I know that achieved it account shared to get it. Family and IRL friends.
---
Solo also wasn‚Äôt ‚Äògood‚Äô by any means. Should be easy to not make a ‚Äòbad‚Äô movie with a legendary world and probably a fat stack of cash to develop it. It‚Äôs not like anyone‚Äôs dying to rewatch any of these new Star Wars movies, Iv seem most in theaters but never rewatched any of them, even the thought of doing that‚Äôs got my blood pressure rising
---
Agreed 45 myself mountain dew and crappy snacks were big mistakes.
---
If you play Druid in Classic you'll get all the loots, Cenarius and Stormrage sets from Molten Core and BWL respectively. They did drop all the time!
---
In this case we want those rookie numbers
---
Note: that blue cloak is hella good for feral tanks.
---
Depends on the guild your in, as always.
---
Group dungeon content in Vanilla is much different than retail. More than likely you're going to find a group of players you will stick with, trust, and run dungeons with. I can't say the same about retail going back to mid/late wrath.
---

It is good, sure some of the movies aren't good, and some jokes are bad. But overall the movies are excellent. Thor ragnarok, endgame and guardians of the galaxy are excellent movies, the first iron man is amazing, winter soldier is great as well.

I mean really, they have more good movies than bad.

But it‚Äôs faster than ret..
---
Not in Vanilla but in WotLK I never got 8.5 shoulders on my Paladin. First conq went to another holy paladin and he quit shortly after, and conq drops were rare for us. I guess it never really mattered since also soon after that my guild asked me to change to raid as a resto shaman and ended up getting full 8.5 on it.
---
Just glad they never gave him Val'anyr fragmentss.
---
Should be easy for everyone on /r/ClassicWow - They were Rank 14 in Vanilla anyway
---
Yeah, cause the Marvel properties don‚Äôt go R rated ever. Oh wait.
---
Hunter for farming. Also easy to gear up.
---
I remember starting on a brand new server and joining a guild that planned to pvp to rank 14. They would camp graveyard beyond diminishing returns on HK, to the point that the opposing server pop stopped queuing. Guild leaders thought they were gods until we met another premade.
---
&gt;  truly experience what it was like playing on high populated servers in 2005 for the authentic experience.
---
With a weeks worth of free days too ? Naah, they want the money. Funny how people expect very smooth launches. It never happens. WoW US retail launch was a shitshow. But back then everyone was so hyped to play, there wasnt any major /cutwrists, like any small mistake in todays enviroment.
---
CGI and the actors are good but still the unfunny cringy jokes ruins my immersion every goddamn time... It's like watching deadpool and jokes like he would do but he is not there and it's a serious situation.
---
Something with a movement boost. Mainly for lvl 5 banking alt with disenchanting then later 35 for a max level profession. Probably a Hunter.
---
Dude why does this point about them extracting money justify that the movies needed to be made in the first place. Your basically saying they needed to make the movies to prove how socially acceptable being ‚Äònerdy‚Äô is these days. I work in IT sure a lot of co workers asked me are you gonna see end game when it first came out...sure it‚Äôs popular in the sense when it came out people were hype but it‚Äôs not like they are willing to have an in depth conversation about the movie, because it was just a three hour cgi circle jerk with captain marvel showing up at the very end for some reason and just kicking ass..also you now start to see iron mans contract running dry, watch out for this trend of super hero‚Äôs only dying out in the movies because they contracts up. Lame. Make them die at a meaningful part of the movie not at the very end
---
Yeah I'm not really going to reach hardcore levels so it's fine. Also I just fell in love with undead so I'm going with that :P
---
RemindMe! August 27, 2019
---
I don't see why people think paladin is a slow lvler. Their kill speed is a bit slow, but their uptime is amazing. You can get out of most situations without dying, and you get the lvl 40 mount for free iirc. Lvling is divided into three parts - killing+regen+running. Paladin doesnt have to stop to eat/bandage/both every other pull like a rogue or a warrior and the paladin moves at the same speed as both. Conserve your mana for seals and heals, and you'll have near permanent uptime. 
---
You can also watch Netflix the entire time you lvl paladin because it only requires minimal focus most of the time.
---
i wanted to say people barely use those... but now i'm not so sure. 99% of the time it gives out garbage, but i actually have gotten some gems from them (use one for my main's name) that i wouldn't expect was from the rng

When GW2 was launched I was in a Swedish guild with some high ranked military officers. We dominated World vs World vs World PvP so hard man. They were tough, but they were damn strategical.
---
Was fun!
---
The problem with this subreddit, is that everyone assumes you're trying to join &lt;Method&gt; and min-max your performance every raid. People forget that for most players, vanilla is spent farming raids that are easy to clear.  
---
When I played Vanilla, I was a PvP (holy paladin) spec 90% of the time. I only respec'd for progression raids, because it didn't matter **at all** once a raid was on farm.  
---
Sometimes, I would even show up to heal with a PvP ret spec, because who gaf.
---
Disney please buy them, keep blizzard and then dismantle Activision. You could even send them their final cheques in loot boxes eith a rare chance at getting a good payout.

I do that too and still struggle off and on lol
---
I'm chiming in late but I have to get this off my chest. Playing WoW in middle school in a raiding guild was a fucking nightmare. I was a Warlock and I was damn good at it, too. I remember being affliction my whole leveling career and I had 0 issue dropping DPS in dungeons. Finally joined this raiding guild so I could play some endgame shit for once and get good gear. 
---
First of all, I was continually ridiculed on Vent for my high-pitched voice. Eventually I was muted and could only listen to other people talk. As afflct, I was still competing well on DPS. But my guild made me respec to destro, which I did reluctantly. With my destro spell rotation I was number 1 DPS on every raid and frequently aggro'd off the tank cause he couldn't handle it. 
---
I still got shit talked to me constantly if I ever dropped below top 3 DPS for any major fight. I then started getting kicked mid-raid so the older member's friends could take my place. I remember sitting outside a raid entrance waiting for someone to drop out of the raid for two hours because I wanted that gear so badly. Fuck those assholes for ruining my endgame experience.
---
Get your ass off the sofa and get out in the real world and get urself a job. Deliver pizza, hand out flyers, grocery store do whatever it takes and you'll be able to get a steady income and then be able to support your gaming etc.

AV Snowball pvp

BiS for the next 25 minutes until they see another weapon which immediately becomes BiS
---
You'll need to respec every raid if you need to max out your DPS.  
---
Once a raid is on farm, however, PvPers can usually keep their PvP spec, because the raid's numbers will be higher than necessary anyway.
---
Must have not played pservers then
---
I just achieved Knight-Captain, that was enough for me. I loved that ranking system. I guess I would have hated it had I wanted to go much higher :)
---
Ay I‚Äôm Oregon too lol
---
isn't enh shaman mostly auto-attack like paladin?
---
Only 4 BRD Quest Runs until Classic launch.
---
The level 30-something Ogre body guard that walked around with that Goblin vendor between Crossroads and Ratchet, and when the skumsucking level 60 Alliance came griefing us little level 13s in Crossroads, the bastard would gank US...for defending our own town. He is affiliated with Gadgetzan, so from then on, every time I saw him I'd set myself "at war" with Gadget and murder him....slowly.
---
Why would they be there earlier? They said, they add content according to their original releases. Why should one piece of 1.5 content be available in phase 1?
---
It's not quest changes, those quests were added to the game in this patch. I think the NPCs as well.
---
How do you have yours reserved already?
---
if you you want to minmax your dps and be competitive you need to melee weave autoattacks in between your shots, without losing the shots. Then you will be in melee every now and then for sappers
---
 took the first day off thats about it for me though
---
Nah this is blizz not private servers. Youll need 2 ppl per account for a long time
---
I hope to god he means coke
---
Lol bubble hearth.
---
For feral gear you have to compete with rogues. Healing is pretty much a mix with cloth and leather.
---
The bad part is that the druid with most SP overwrites the hots, meaning having more than one resto druid in the raid is inefficient.
---
I blacked it out and then someone told me about it. Still not sure if I made it up or it was real
---
.003 and .003% are drastically different numbers.
---
Should I consider re-rolling if the guild that fits my personality/schedule already has 8 locks total? I really really want to at least accomplish full T1 in a reasonable amount of time.
---
Healer is probably your best bet, I think paladin and priest are both good choices. Priest has aoe fear, power word shield, and good heals. Pallies have blessing of protection/freedom and also good heals. Up to you i guess
---
Same. Gut said warlock because Im casual now and that free 40 mount sounded appealing.
---
However, Im going with Priest. Fits my leveling group quite well, and I shouldnt have a hard time finding groups for dungeons later on.
---
I want to play druid, but I want to be a Troll druid :(
---
Ok dad. üòè
---
We'll see.
---
"During Phase 3 (BWL), will pugs be easily clearing Onyxia?"
---
75%
---
Rofl sure, I want to see that
---
Get a job.
---
No time for friends and family? This is too real for me.
---
If these people are your friends and don't want to play without them then reroll. If you can live without the people, change guilds.
---
**US, PVP, ALLIANCE, LATE NIGHT**
---
Me and a few friends are looking for LATE NIGHT Raiding Guild for Alliance PVP.  We are looking to raid starting between 12AM and 1AM CST and can stay on as late as needed.  I am playing a Human Rogue and my 2 friends are playing Human Mage and Human Priest.  I have previous experience running my own guild in BC we made it part way through Serpent-shrine Caverns but were never big enough go much farther.  In classic I cleared all of Molten Core and BWL up to Chromaggus.  I would love to find a guild that is a lot of fun but at the same time is looking to progress through content.  I am willing to farm consumes and do all necessary things for raiding.
---
I work my first job for 4 hours then I go to my second job for about 9 hours straight with no break. I could stay at my second job for 48 straight hours being busy doing things and still have things to do. I think with some jobs there needs to be a time limit or home bell call.
---
I feel like teenagers can't compare to proper no-life NEETers though. Teenagers are still usually beholden to their parents and legally have to go to school.
---
If you live alone and have no job nothing but sleep is stopping you, and there are plenty of chemical remedies for that (though none that are really advisable)
---
Holy paragraph batman.  I really enjoyed endgame, despite it's flaws and sjw moments.
---
Someone had to say it instead of sugar coating it and getting end game part 1.5 (which we will still get) because no ones willing to critique the all mighty marvel studios!
---
My problem has always been people's shit attitude. I don't think your chance of winning is over 90%, especially not if you're throwing together a group of blue geared dudes going against MC+ geared. Usually the people I play with turd around in the first game, don't follow instructions and then get discouraged and leave. After one game. It's annoying as shit.
---
Guilds should be way more cohesive. Sorry to hear your time with that guild was unpleasant. Looking back I'm betting you could of dropped and found one with a more pleasant atmosphere!
---
How many times do you run sm or deadmines once ur 10 levels over that? Every 10 levels make the previous 10 levels irrelevant, this is no different...
---
Fine, but the idea that that is a "bad" spec for pvp simply isn't true. It's arguably better for organized Warsong Gulch, especially if you have trinkets.
---
PvE caster ?    ... mousewheer scroll frostbolt
---
I agree even on Horde i think there is room for 3 druids in ideal (or near) raid comps.
---
Mute commented on the videos on youtube for a direct link to the three parts which haven't been touched.
---
If you are attacking the warrior you're not pressuring the paladin. Healer not pressured it becomes pretty hard to kill the warrior. Sure, it heals for half the amount, but at the same time the warrior is pounding on the shaman. In a pinch, Blessing of Protection removes MS debuff. Sure the warrior can't attack, but he can always macro a buff removal, MS has 6 seconds cd, in that time the paladin can heal plenty.
---
What classes shine in premades? Horde side
---
But what kind of stories did the mailbox bear tell?
---
Don't you want to get ahead of the zerg?..
---
I have been torn ever since it was announced changing my mind every week! My guild help me decide though as they gave me the green light to play ele shaman 30/0/21 as a healer in raids that way I can still get my pvp on as a damaged dealer and I only pve to pvp :)
---
A lot of factors just aligned with hunters for them to attract less than stellar people and produce "that fucking hunter" stories.
---
Their leveling rotation is so simple that it's almost impossible to fuck up. I leveled a hunter on a no-no server, at my leveling was literally one button macro that used Serpent Sting, pet attack and started my auto attack. Until sometime in the 30's where you can actually sustain a Multi Shot now and then, this is the optimal.
---
The mechanics are way different in groups, where a hunter pet spamming Growl is a massive problem.
---
Not dismissing pet before a jump? Wipe.
---
They can use almost all weapons (I think all but maces and wands) - and all stats but Strength honestly has merit on them (usually prio is Agi &gt; stam=spirit &gt; int for leveling), especially while leveling. Problem is that a lot of these stats are obviously more desirable for a caster. So you'd see lots of hunters get seduced by that blue colour and roll need on Emberstone Staff, Illusory Rod, etc.
---
And while we're on that sexy blue (or heavens forbid purple) colour, a lot of us were terrible back then. Hunter sees a Ravager drop and oooh MY is it shiny and cool looking! And look at the DPS! Suddenly his sad, green [Armor Piercer] (https://classicdb.ch/?item=6679) looks terrible in comparison. So he clicks the little dice icon. Like, how could he not, right? Look how strong it is. He wins. Sad enhancement shaman and warrior leave group with a new "that fucking huntard"-story.
---
Playing druid. 3 bags worth of gear, twice the work for anything in pvp, having to heal in raids. Would not recommend for a 13 year old kid that thought it meant turning into a tiger and mauling shit to death.
---
There are frustrating issues with arenas as well though.
---
They were camping for a half hour+, well beyond the 4 kill diminishing returns. We weren't just losing out on bonus honor for wins, we literally killed queue times because nobody wanted to play anymore. Our guild leader was *that* kid. After we got our asses punished for an afternoon, we had a guild meeting and I got kicked for suggesting we try to git gud.
---
Fill the loot council with only hunters. They share most loot only with each other.
---
:)
---
The marvel movies for the most part are great, not sure wtf you are talking about.
---
&gt;You might get a tip from a guild mate that doesn't have high level enchanting that is trying to flip some white bandit masks and needs you to DE 600 of them for the reset day price hike.
---
Level 5 char with L1 enchanting can DE EVERYTHING. There is no level requirement for disenchanting in vanilla.
---
Haha vengence for the teens! 
---
I've definitely gone back for revenge on mobs. Grinding them into oblivion.
---
While almost every class does well in premades, Druid is probably the easiest answer. You need a good flag carrier and Druid does that best :)
---
&gt;(These 3 players assigned CAN NOT RECEIVE LOOT FOR THE CURRENT RAID)
---
I'd be ticked if I was assigned to loot council and an item that I've been waiting a long time to try and snag drops just for it to be denied because of the loot rules.
---
Back then it was some candy, Coca Cola with sugar and a little bit of chewing tobacco. 
---
Now I was in my early 30ies. Very healthy and I did non payed competitive sports 3 days a week. 
---
So I think I could handle it pretty good 
---
Now at 46 I can‚Äôt handle it as good and need to watch out. Tobacco I still use. 
---
But more healthy food and coffee. But I grew up being quite healthy too. My mother is some what of an health freak. So it‚Äôs in my system.
---
My favorite Vanilla zone is Mulgore, but it didn't changed much in Cataclysm.
---
Loch Modan is one of the zones that I was really pleased to discover before the world revamp, as I started in Cata.
---
It changed so much, and it's a totally different feeling without it's beautiful lake.
---
Used a lot of my hard earnt dkp on a pretty meh dagger cause i just thought about having an epic and thought others would bet more. I.e. waaay overbidded cuz i was bad at bidding. 
---
Also not being able to raid all that well because i had the plug pulled by my parents all so often in the middle of raids during late hours.
---
Warriors are great in PvP with their pocket heals, and they shine better on Alliance thanks to Paladin. 
---
Your impression isn't terribly accurate, in practice Warriors will do well when paired up with others, in a strictly 1v1 scenario it'll be hit or miss depending on what you're facing.
---
Dabu
---
Oh wow that is next level. To be fair it doesn't sound like a fun guild to be in.
---
I can believe that it happened a few time organically with people going there to recapture ‚Äúold time fun‚Äù or that a guild organized an event from time to time  there after 1.5 but if you‚Äôre telling me that during all vanilla and (especially) BC people were fighting big battles in SS-TM regularly, I just don‚Äôt believe it.
---
I mean without PvP‚Äôers who were in BG and too afraid of DK to come anywhere close to one of the town, with a total lack of reward and in a zone with very low activity (as Horde player, TM was far from everything and wasn‚Äôt a big quest hub) I really doubt that what happened on almost every servers didn‚Äôt happen on yours and especially that it continued even in BC when old continents became empty areas
---
You might want to consider that you are in a very small minority. The marvel movies are for the most part great for what they are. Very entertaining cinema. You don't hear everyone laughing in the theater?
---
Right and it was not well received because Warcraft players are well over 21 at this junction
---
Druid if you want to tank, heal, and dps while leveling (though generally the first 2). 
---
You'll almost definitely be healing in raids. 
---
Maybe branch out and look at Shaman/Paladin? Paladin if you like the potential tanking while leveling, Shaman if you like the end-game healing. Tipping point being if you like either one's flavour / abilities in PvP (if PvP matters)
---
It is possible yes. But it is not possible if you plan to raid pretty hardcore. Attempting world firsts or things like that. 
---
I played and raided with the same build as I pvp with. It was a casual guild that raided a lot but it was not really tryhards or hardcore.
---
Haha but you'll never forget that tier.5 denial. Gratz on the quick t1 right after though!
---
Not too hard, you're required for some fights. It'll depend on other hunters on the server &amp; how many your guild / group has. 
---
Paladin obviously is a natural great combo with both Warlock and Warrior (in both PvP &amp; PvE).
---
I didn‚Äôt participate after BC actually quit very soon after that came out so I‚Äôm feeling fresh and ready to go
---
I'm not saying there aren't but would you care to elaborate?
---
Thank you OP. Will be discussing these points with my co gm and designing a build brand around these ideals. Great information and very much appreciated
---
I do think both are needed. Especially in guilds, where offspecs are accepted.
---
Eg for paladins, the blessing distribution should be handled by the paladin class leader. It makes no sense for the heal leader to assign those, when he isn't even a paladin or the raid has non healing paladins.
---
On the other hand the heal leader should control heal assignments, as it makes no sense for the paladin leader to do so when they are a ret pala.
---
Not to mention a class leader can fulfill the mentor position better than a role leader and a class channels for every class in the guild are also a great spot for people to exchange knowledge and theories.
---
where did you get that 100 Million figure from?
---
If you have a problem with Blizzard requiring an active subscription to reserve a name... To the point that you think they are 'unethical' in their business practices... 
---
Well, I'd love to see all the corporations that you give money to on a day to day basis. Because I'm going to bet the majority of them are MUCH more unethical than Blizzard.
---
I mean if you *really* have a problem with it, then don't reserve your name. Its pretty simple. 
---
I think you're completely over reacting here. Its a video game company. People aren't dying over name reservations, lmao.
---
It's the 13th now? 
---
Last I heard it was the 25th. Anybody mind linking where to stay up to date there?
---
Cause my gaming new is browsing by hot here and upload date in my youtube subs...
---
Tailoring also helps you craft a few BiS pre-raid items for a Warlock. With the caveat of "casually playing" it may not be necessary but it's a nice boost.
---
Shadowmeld cant be used in Combat and 1% DODGE is actually Bad AS a Tank cause you dont generate rage..
---
I lvld a Paladin (my first charakter) to lvl 58 as a kid. Took me about 12 days of playtime. Then i tried out Hunter, just for fun, and i realized how much easier it is to lvl a hunter. Well i did the only logical thing.... i deleted the Paladin, and mained the hunter. I deleted the Paladin, because i sold all his stuff, so i had sone gold on the hunter.....very smart.
---
Stupid litl sh$thead
---
I think the lore justification was that their bodies just kinda...dissolve if they stay in water for too long
---
Is a joke.
---
Engineering is good for world pvp. That‚Äôs why I will take it.
---
‚ÄòFor the most part‚Äô that‚Äôs like saying you can hit the broad side of a barn. Sure if you create enough action movies a few will stand out relative to the trash.
---
I much prefer early kalmindor leveling for alliance and horde, I feel like the eastern kingdoms alliance stuff does have a lot of running around.
---
The first three night elf zones are awesome though
---
Both have great run animations which is all that matters at the end of the day. 
---
And POST
---
I did not know about the sappers for pve. But you say it cost gold? Then I will not use it in a raid;) I will save it for saving my ass in world pvp.
---
Yeah well you already got it. It‚Äôs not like a bug bite that will go away in a few days. Diabetes causes long term consequences. But to each their own. Find out what it‚Äôll bring you in the future if you‚Äôre not afraid of it
---
I really enjoyed doing IF when I was in school, but I just can't do it at work. So hard to make myself focus when what I'm doing is boring af + my body is hitting me with those hunger pangs
---
Pservers don‚Äôt monitor accounts nearly as much as Blizzard does, a huge part of grinding out ranks on the Pserver scene involves account sharing, which Blizzard is not very fond of.
---
I'm afraid you will be burned out psychologically. At one point the brain will say "Ah shit, not his shit again", even if you vary your leveling routes heavily. It's like eating 5 meals at the same time. You will be saturated at one point, not having enjoyed even one meal to the fullest.
---
I didn't think about any of that. I just saw that it was epic and an upgrade wooooow everyone must want that so much. Someone bids very low, i bid very high sort of in excitement. Then of course no one bids more than me cause there are better weapons to come. Just wanted my first item from a raid too much :D would've won it with half the points i put in.
---
Man I vendored a fuckton of gear from BWL, AQ40, and Naxx including some Frostfire. Needed the gold in BC and had no idea we were on the cusp of transmogrification
---
I was a night elf warrior and I wanted to FIGHT THE ORCS because that's what elves do. So I patiently level up to lvl 5, and then I thought "Okay, I'm strong enough, I'm going to slay orcs. Where are they ? On the continent I think."
---
Since WoW was all about having one big world with no loading screen, I thought I could swim from Teldrassil to Kalimdor (I had no clue that Darkshore was actually also a Night Elf zone...) so I went to Darnassus, and tried to find a way out. And my logical mind thought it was a good idea to jump from the water, because it would eventually join the ocean. Not a bad idea !
---
So basically I jumped from the world tree and died like 5 or 7 times before reaching the tree's roots. After that, I swam and finally reached Ruth'Theran's village. I thought this was some secret place and I felt like the first one ever reaching here. 
---
Then it was late, I disconnected and never came back to this char.
---
Yeah people really avoid critiquing things they don't like these days, it's becoming a huge problem.
---
This cartoon is wrong. Work is taking up the most time, so you replace that with gaming
---
As a Vanilla &amp; Classic Warlock you are my favorite kind of player. 
---
Welcome to the fold brother/sister.
---
So some will account share, some will stream their rank grind.
---
Sounds like you will have a good base of people not playing the system.
---
Hakkar server a dwarf preist named Chaoticzero. First encounter dude was tearing shit up on org. He would 2v1 me and my friend easily. Wasnt til TBC we would get revenge. He was like the guy on South Park he would show up all the damn time everywhere. I still hold a grudge over a decade later. But that's what made it so damn fun!
---
Self censorship it‚Äôs a bitch
---
They gonna make a second WOW movie. But because it's disney, they gonna add all the Disney check marks:
---
\- diversity
---
\- evil white men
---
\- strong waman
---
\- a little dose of LGBT
---
Had it since birth so pretty aware :p
---
I haven't raided properly for several expansions now, but back in WoTLk and Cata a lot of the guilds I raided with used EPGP. Is that system not used anymore?
---
I think taking off work for a game release kind of disqualifies you as a casual player by itself
---
Hi, /u/Skridrow
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/chkltd/just_had_a_very_small_update_for_classic_wow/). 
---
I honestly don‚Äôt know shit about healing of healing classes so I can help you there mate. Sorry. 
---
When it comes to content that is not raids, there is a lot. I ran a lot more dungeons than I did raids. And I farmed for this and that around the world. Making gold is hard in classic so everything you do will be ‚Äúrewarded‚Äù. Your playtime is never totally ‚Äúlost‚Äù. 
---
I had such a fun time grinding gold for getting both the level 40 mount and later the epic mount. And during that time there was a lot of grinding to get all those cool and useful speed increases you can get for your riding skill:)
---
You don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about
---
Haha I'm imagining a paladin leveling montage for you. Glad you got your message across and rolled them with the class they didn't respect.
---
Tank,,healer, 3 firemages? ;)
---
&gt; The Razer Naga is a bit out of my budget 
---
What is out of your budget is becoming handicapped. Sorry to say but you don't seem to take this very seriously, and it actually is very serious, it can get nasty. If you really think you cannot invest a bit into some better fitted gear then restrict your playtime heavily.
---
Another thing you could do, that I did and helped a lot, is learning to use the mouse with your left hand when not playing. That's a big chunk of your computer usage where your right hand will be left to rest.
---
I dont drink since i rather invest my Money in company shares or fun things like my car collection. If you read my Schedule correctly you see that we buy fresh groceries every day from the local farmers and cook meals with that, that often take an hour to make.
---
I get up 5 times a week to go to the Gym or do some other sports.
---
yeah thats just false
---
Actually, point taken!
---
Who needs to check a gear score for feral?  They already failed a spec check.
---
I used to play with a kid from Canada, must have been 12 or 13. He got bullied at school and had self-esteem issues. Knowing what I know now, he was probably dealing with depression. Anyway, me and a few others in-game were his friends, his emotional support. One day I just logged off for the last time, and I didn‚Äôt even think to say goodbye or stay in touch. I wonder how he‚Äôs doing sometimes, I hope he‚Äôs alright.
---
why would the "best" player required the best gear?  
---
shouldn't you be getting someting like a penalty for high rating?
---
The Murlocs in STV specifically can suck a flaming bag of dynamite. 
---
They're overleveled compared to every other mob around them and they just walk on the road like it's no big deal. 
---
The vast majority of my early deaths in WoW were to Raptors in the Barrens and Murlocs / elite crocs in STV.
---
Victurus, best Warrior ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
At least that proves you can comfortably hit level 11 for the mounts.
---
What part is false?
---
the pathing ofc.
---
In my experience, through Wailing Caverns you will learn who on the server (around your level) you do not want to party with again.
---
By not changing classic in any way and simply adding fresh realms over time, community driven changes can help or destroy only if they are allowed to happen.
---
First day game comes out at 3pm western us time. I'll eat before it comes out and then have food on the ready. Definitely will have an energy drink at the 12am time range and probably another in a few hours. 
---
When I was leveling on private servers I remembered the feeling of not getting hungry and all of a sudden realized I hadn't eaten yet.
---
No, you misunderstand. I was never sure about the 2 yards. Here is my original comment about it:
---
&gt; Everything I have seen so far indicates that any of the two players moving will add some range (2 yards?). So if either moves the range increase is 2 and if both move it's 4 (assuming the 2 yards is correct).
---
But the video of this post shows that leeway gets activated for each person moving, but that was BFA footage. I never argued the range because I was not sure about it to begin with.
---
Please make one for us to share then. Otherwise without elaborating you‚Äôre not adding to anything.
---
This only works if one either does not have a preferred role in mind or their preferred role is one that the class with their favourite class fantasy is good (or at least decent enough) at.
---
As a personal example, I've played paladin since the original vanilla, originally wanted to be DPS (similar to Diablo paladins, which were me reference point for the class), but tanking started to appeal to me somewhere around ZG and AQ releases. Obviously I was still a healbot in the raids for the rest of vanilla, but when TBC was released, I respecced to prot and have been a tank since then.
---
Granted, most other class + role combinations will probably have easier time being not-complete-garbage than paladin + tank (well, except rogue + heal =P ), but personally I have a rather hard time trying to decide if I should choose the class I'd like or the role I'd like.
---
He never left desolace. The other two maps are irrelevant since he never goes that way.
---
If it's a mob close to the tank that peels of to attack the healer I don't see the issue with a quick nova to stop that mob running away from the tank.
---
I'm burning hard for classic :)
---
Not telling my WoW friends how much they meant to me. Only looking back do I realise all of my real friends circa 2004-2007 were online buddies in Azeroth. 
---
And they helped me through the worst year of my life (so far). But I never realised how much they helped until we had all parted ways.
---
\+ he can take 2 routes in desolace
---
I know at least one guy who‚Äôll tell you that anyone who sides with the Gelkis is a little bitch. Don‚Äôt ask me why he feels so strongly about it, but he certainly does.
---
You're right, mageblade and drakestone beats the rank 14 staff. We will see little of casters reaching rank 14 as it's just not worth it. Casters were always gimped in early vanilla.
---
I'm ... 15 years too late but I would honestly play druid if it weren't for the shapeshifting. Love the class abilities and variety, but really don't want to turn in to an animal.
---
Meth = speed
---
do you know that in most videos there is always some things that get in your vision?
---
A text is displayed too long or too short, the music/ narration is too loud/ too quiet, the narration is too slow and boring or too fast and hard to follow, or the video is filled with rambling, plugs, ads, and unimportant forgettable info?  
---
your video had none of that.
---
i actually try to get better at editing myself and try to look behind the facade of the videos i watch (where are the cuts, what transition are used and everything i mentioned above).
---
and i completely forgot about it. i just wanted to follow the video. GREAT job! earned a like and sub.
---
Well you‚Äôre feeding false info, I‚Äôd argue that‚Äôs worse
---
I appreciate your insight and experience, thanks for sharing.
---
I'm pretty torn between classes and part of the motivation for one choice, paladin, is to get judgment and sulfuras for PvP smiting. Is it worth the effort or is it honestly kinda meh in pvp with ret? I'm perfectly content FoL'ing my entire raid career.
---
*You* are the one that brought up what OP asked about - he clearly is talking about *when* something is considered ninja looting, he gives examples of his doubt. He is directly saying he don't know where the line is, so I explained that the line differ from people to people. He knows what "ninja looting" means in a general sense, but not when someone consider it ninja looting. You can't just say "what the group expects", OP is directly *asking* what those expectations are.
---
You are absolutely not answering OP's question and honestly I can't figure if you are actually too dumb to understand that I am, or you are too stubborn to accept that you were wrong after embarrassing yourself.
---
Should have made one, the lvling experience on that Paladin was the best I had. There was a Draenei Shaman lvling up in the same pase all the way to 70. We helped each other with elite mobs, killed each other. A true love hate relationship.
---
I had a badly cropped image of the ganks but the online storage have maintaince now =(
---
So, you mean it'll be exactly the same?
---
It was announced in a [blog/infographic](http://media.wow-europe.com/infographic/en/world-of-warcraft-infographic.html) by Blizzard in 2014.
---
It's % of the spells total range, the total range is the range after taking Combatreach and range talents into account.
---
10% for non-channeled spells, 20% for channeled spells.
---
Example:
---
**Mage Fireball**(range talented):  
---
1.5 + 1.5 + 41 = 44  
---
44 \* 0.1 = 4.4 yards extended range  
---
**Mage Arcane missiles:**  
---
1.5 + 1.5 + 30 = 33  
---
33 \* 0.2 = 6.6 yards extended range  
---
**Warlock Fear:**  
---
1.5 + 1.5 + 20 = 23  
---
23 \* 0.1 = 2.3 yards extended range
---
This is a lot less for many spells compared to current vanilla private servers that use a static value of I believe 5 yards for all non-channeled spells and 10 yards for channeled spells
---
they did change it later on in future expansion to be unlimited water breathing. Maybe they just initially thought it would be OP?
---

He dosnt go that far in to stonetalon, usualy hes just on the border, a bit in to the sotnetalon zone, def not all the way to the aly base.

Feralas map is correct, he can go to the 2 pillars, desolace is missing the East road route.

OP: people like their information they are searching for to be correct, so they dont loose time or get duped. This is only 50% correct.

I leveled all classes to 60 except mage and warlock in vanilla, and can tell you that leveling a druid IS SUPER FUN, a lot of flavor and immersion, really really tons of fun
---
I'm not your mon ch√©ri, chief.
---
You could wing it and organically join a guild. A lot of these won't fully form and will fizzle before many of their people hit 60. 
---
But if you plan on tryharding and being the best of the best then seeking out like minded people who are preparing for that would be a good idea.

What's Moderarion? Sounds like an awesome LAN event

Yep.  I used to have this on my enhance shaman in Vanilla, if WF proc'd in PvP you could 1hk most players around your level or finish them off with a frost shock if it didn't.

I regret being a bit salty at times having a immature me and my crew vs him/her and his/her crew thing going on the forums.
---
Sorry Scarlet
---
Far from true, at least the DPS part. Warlocks/mage/warrior are all top tier DPS along with rogue and hunter isn't that far behind either. You usually don't use more then 6~ or so rogues anyway because you need to put them in melee groups so they get their appropriate buffs. Also feral druids can do competitive DPS you just have to be willing to farm Gnomeregan for the rest of vanilla.
---
Rogues were also generally overplayed, despite being wanted for raiding, you'll have a easier time finding a spot as a hunter or warlock.
---
As long as it's not a mac you are good to go!
---
That's fine, but in that case then maybe don't have a mega expensive hyped yearly conference for people who aren't your audience then.
---
Something need doing?
---
Top reason: I get to be a cat.
---
&gt;Dude. The elf in the photo has GREEN eyes.
---
I never said otherwise. I opposed your logic about green eyes = blood elf.
---
Lore wise there were high elves with green eyes way before they renamed themselves blood elves, so you can't say green eyes means blood elf. It could just as well be a green eyed high elf.
---
Of course most people knows that this picture is of a blood elf, it is taken directly from the TBC cinematic. I'm not arguing against that, I'm just saying you can't assume blood elf just from green eyes. Actually, a blood elf can also have golden eyes - the fel glow isn't permanent, but will fade if they refrain from fel for long enough.
---
Point is, the eye colour has nothing to do with whether or not they er blood elves or high elves. Both can have green eyes or other colours. The only thing that separate blood elves and high elves are whether or not they choose to name themselves blood elves in honor of their fallen. That is literally the sole difference.
---
I did this on a private server and actually farmed the MCPs. I then forgot to bring them out of bank for the raids I was finally allowed to feral like a dikhead. Managed to top DPS on a few bosses in ZG tho despite being in OT spec, huzzah. Dragged those 19 poor fuckers down to the stupid fish guy for weeks and finally got my fishing staff. It was real rare though, pesky warriors kept showing up for raids in prot spec.
---
Oh okay, thanks for explaining that. Yea the laptop has no gpu so that‚Äôs why I asked.
---
I also started off with a nightelf warrior and loved it. But I met a warrior during my levelling process who was a bit behind me. He kept asking me for info, which I provided as best I could. Some day he asked me: ‚ÄûWhen do warriors start being fun?‚Äú
---
I was stunned. Here I was, having the time of my life with this class, even though my spec was really bad. And this guy is not having fun. So I just said: ‚ÄûWhat do you mean? It is fun!‚Äú I don‚Äôt remember seeing him around much after that.
---
Not teaching other people playing my class (or like-classes) how to play better. 
---
This was back when tryharding wasn't really a thing, so for me to have consumed all of the collective knowledge of the (at the time) small internet communities on how to min/max and just generally suck-less would have changed my mediocre-at-progression guild into one that could actually murder the content available.
---
I regret this a lot. There were four or five of us (in the private channel) that all min/maxed &amp; theorycrafted the shit out of our classes/specs... this post made me wonder what a difference it would have made.
---
You use the backdoor smartass. It's like a two minute run back and forth.

What's the difference?

I mean't the time, sorry :)

If you can already run 1.12 it will run Classic.

The chromebook I bought six years ago $150 can run 1.12 &amp; Classic on low.
---
He does, he travels to the twin peaks thats about 30seconds into Feralas. If you turn too early you might miss him, ride up the entire way to Stonetalon Mountains only to meet him on your way back again.
---
Not his fault you're giving misinformation to get "Upboats"
---
95% of guilds will not be able to sustain loot council... Raid attendance DKP is superior for the majority of players.  Some guilds will do a hybrid approach, where they gear the main tank up first, and this will just shit on other warriors getting gear at first.
---
You get to avoid the leveling zerg. Congrats
---
If rated bgs was a thing in tbc and you could buy the same gear he wouldn't have a problem I think.

---
Its fun when you read about other classes perspective in raiding back then. 
---
I was priest healer and always thought the restro druids had as much fun as i did in raids, but the more i read about resto druids limits, HoTs not stacking, high inefficient mana costing spells, forced to spam Healing touch pretty much 99% of the time and even then you are usually passed by priests and paladins. 
---
Yea.. this is why i plan on rolling feral tank/dps cuz then at least i can tank for my m8s in 5 mans and in raids dps on cat when not offtanking. I know feral dps isnt great but I hope i can find a guild that accepts one.
---
Well, the truth about classic PvE is, that it is braindead easy. You can bring whatever class you want and success. Only in Naxx would this change, but that is mainly because it is gear gated. Naxx was essentially hard because of the numbers, so choosing better classes meant you easier got to the proper numbers.
---
In practice? It can matter even in MC. Some people actually believe it is a hard game and think they need to min/max. Avoid those guilds, they are the try hard wannabes. Some valid reasons is to want less fail chance - especially in a PuG this might be nice. Some might also try to make the runs faster, in which case class also matter.
---
But simply to success for the most part, you can bring anything. I'd say, if you play something that isn't considered meta, just find a guild that is not trying to go world first and not trying to speed run. Most casual or even semi-hardcore guilds can still use you, especially considering many will honestly have a hard time finding 40 people for every raid. It is common to have to just "fill in", sometimes even with random PuG people. Most would sure as hell rather have that friendly moonkin from their guild that they know won't fuck up instead of inviting random people into the raid.

Back then I drank a LOT of diet pepsi. I also snacked a lot, but nothing in particular. I think the snack I would most often eat was nachos.

But I'm glad to say that won't happen this time around. Since march I'm dieting, have already lost 45lbs, and the last time I drank a soda was on easter.
---
Thanks, that's really useful and matches what I remember!
---
Any chance you got a source or was it something you've tested/seen from back then. Either way, this helps a lot.
---
I work 80 % and in september when university continues I'll have regular 100 % week.
---
So currently every thursday is my free day. I took a free day on friday during first week.
---
 My GF wont be around for the release as well, which means I'll get home wednesday evening - cut all my socail strings - and just enjoy the time. I'm really looking forward to it, just knowing that it's for me and not going to happen on a regular basis
---
Its pure luck getting the eye to drop, some guilds might raid mc for 2-3 years without getting one. Its not exactly something I would try to actively work towards to, as you might get severely disappointed.
---
Its also stupendously expensive to make (not quite as expensive as TF) at 8(+1 for the recipe) sulfuron ingots and 50 arcanite bars. Sulfuron ingots went for about 300-400g each on pservers, they drop only from golemagg at around \~20%.
---
Is it "worth" it? just alone for the looks and the prestige, absolutely. Just for efficiency or min-maxing there are a few other equal or even better options very late in naxx or aq40. As for pvp ret is really strong and the massive random bursts are quite fun, but they're hardcountered by some classes like hunters or shamans. Also holy paladins are easily one of the top \~3 overall pvp specs, so theres not much reason to go ret if you wanna be serious about pvp.
---
But the mount is rank 11, and the difference between rank 10 and 11 is huge.
---
I had a creative name for my druid in Wotlk. It was "Rainfall". Well I played on a german pvp server and in raids they always called me "Reinfall" which means "Failure" in English.
---
Definitely wont take that name again.
---
Pet on agressive.
---
Pet on defensive (really anything but passive can cause a wipe)
---
Pet not dismissed when jumping somewhere.  
---
Pet attack macro on hunters mark.
---
pet pathing to and from combat
---
((and now a special new form of stupid only found in classic, pets commands get batched on the #nochanges retards caused 400ms duration spell batching, meaning even if you see it happening in time, you can't do shit about it))
---
Having pets growl turned on, or off when you are supposed to be picking up an add.
---
speccing survival, ever.  Specing Beast Mastery in raids. 
---
Running out of ammo mid-way.
---
A minor miskey is irrelevant to all other clases who are limited by range or cast time, but a hunter OP ultra range, auto targeting, instant cast attacks turn them in to wipes.
---
Scatter shot breaking CC, Stings on CC targets, catching a CC target in the edge of your flame trap.
---
Aspect of the pack, nuff said.
---
!Minimum range!  
---
In vanilla, most adds are caused by body pulling, either patrols or another pack, and hunters are frequently forced to choose between standing around with their finger up their hoohaa, or trying to make enough distance to shoot. This places them at increased risk of body pulling adds, exacerbated by the space their pet takes up beside them, and running back and forth to attack.
---
Especially as the game progresses and groups try to be "efficient" and kill as little as possible to reach the boss,  these oddly contorted pathings can put everyone in a tight spot but hunters far more than any other 
---
But it's not *just* the sheer numbers of ways to screw wipe your party, it's how *easy* they all are. 
---
Then you have the *Hunter Loot* issue, which took a legitimate problem and turned in to a way to shame hunters in to not rolling for legit BiS items, because someone else *needs them more* 
---
add it all up and really all you have to do is simply *exist* as a hunter in a group where someone else fucks up, and it's totally your fault.
---
The problem is classes are way more different and it drives me crazy. In 2005 I picked a priest and got him to 60 with points in every freaking tree because I got no idea what was going on and I got a wand but I never used it because I thought my big stuff does more dmg. What I want to say: back in the day it was easier because I had no idea. Now its different. Warlock? But soulshards! Maybe Pala? I don‚Äòt want to buff everything! Mage? Maybe its hard to find friends without a support class? Shaman! But its only horde...
---
We know to much I guess that makes it even harder
---
I guess attrition vs burst PvP is a matter of preference.
---
I'm planning on rolling a feral druid for Classic, and after being a rogue in vanilla I've gotten quite bored of the burst PvP playstyle, because it basically boils down to that either you kill someone in X seconds, or you're dead in no time, leading to rinse-and-repeat fights that often turn hopeless real quick.
---
Look at mister moneybags there, able to afford a couch!
---
I'd have a couch also if I wasn't living in a way to small apartment. Then once I get it, I too can search for change in it!!!!

I really really like your lore videos too, do you have some new ones coming out? :)

By PuGs, people actually mean 20 guys from a top guild, another 10 alts of people also from the same guild, and 10 idiots for spending gold for loot.
---
There will be no 40 men "pure" PuGs, like a guys LFM-ing in /2 for Ony/MC PuG. Those raids will not even form.
---
So, you are right, because PuGs that aren't backboned by a guild will never kill Ony, but also wrong, because PuGs doesn't actually mean 40 random dudes together.
---
in vanilla my other half would keep a list of alliance players that had killed her or pissed her off in some way or another and then when she saw them again would kill them, she is a vengeful woman
---
Yes, i believe we saw some items with +damage and +healing stats on greens.
---
What now, south park is a motivational series and not a criticism of society? Tell me they did the wow episode because of friendship teamwork and all this bs and not because how everyone viewed gamers and gaming as some lifeless mongrels hiding in basements. Treating gaming like it's a plague. Have you watched tv or news back in the day? Even in this sub there were links of videos on bigger news channels talaking about the online gaming plagues and addiction, how it destroys lifes.
---
Or you could, you know - have a balanced life. You don't have to choose between living solely on sugar or  boycotting it completely. There is a middle way.
---
Ele Shaman is top tier PvP once you get tier 2.5, before that not so much. And to get that tier, you have to do a whole lot of healing.
---
I maintain this one for Paladins, not the same sorting format, but it does cover items from lvl 30 (SM and beyond) and it accepts custom stat weights, auto sort function is still pending (soon tm)

I thought commander was rank 10? Then marshal, field marshal and grand marshal. I only ever got commander and that was the mount rank.
---
The first time I learnt of that, it was such an adventure to go there and check it out. I then got my friend to follow me, and he had no clue where I was taking him. It was just so much fun exploring the world.
---
Thank you for reminding me that this village exists.
---
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs add one of the most asinine parts of retail into classic because I‚Äôm too lazy to get a job‚Äù
---
&gt; A good few months after launch we're gonna see a mass exodus of the core Classic enthusiasts with their main reasoning being "Blizzard fucked it up" 
---
That only if Blizzard indeed fucks it up. If they don't, people won't leave.
---
This is a common and real problem in classic. 
---
While leveling you can pretty much heal with any spec, but pick up and keep heal/int items to do so.
---
Respeccing all the time is possible but also very expensive. But there is a bigger problem, in wow pvp is fun when you win. Winning with most people (despite what they claim) is mainly dependent on your gear.  There are only two real possibilities to get good shadow gear for pvp.
---
1) you are "the shadow" in your raid, there is always just one, and it is hard find a good guild who has this spot open. Especially when you have no experience
---
2) you raid as holy (everyone will love you and want you) in a guild that allows healers to roll / use dkp for damage gear. This is often allowed after you have your corresponding epic in that slot. So once you have heal shoulders you can roll on damage shoulders. You demand this from the guild. If they don't allow it, simply join another one, your holy, everyone needs holy priests! - this is the most likely and probably fastest way to get shadow gear for pvp.
---
Did you just assume his class?
---
This kind of items were not in the game until 1.11 (not sure about the exact patch) so I‚Äôm not sure if they will be available in phase 1
---
If you kept getting beaten as druid in PVP and think it was the class that was holding you back oh boy I got news for you...
---
My vanilla main ended up being a female troll priest I rolled on a whim and then discovered I enjoyed playing more than my (male) tauren warrior. *Lots* of people assumed I had to be female behind the keyboard, because who has a toon of the opposite sex? I never got that when I was on my warrior.
---
I'll probably roll a female troll in Classic too, they're BiS for PvE mage, priest and arguably warrior and look better than the male ones.
---
How this guy pronounces Alterac, Methystra, and Lo'Grosh got me good.
---
?
---
This kind of items were not in the game until late vanilla (1.11 if i remember correctly). So I‚Äôm not sure if they will be included in phase 1
---
Every guide I've seen claims druids are the worst aoe tank. And from watching Skarm he plays both and is a crazy at aoe tanking as a warrior.

Probably no Alliance and not much pvp

Just tough it out for 3 more levels and get both?
---
DP is useless against one entire race, Shadowguard is good against everyone aside from priests.
---
remember rogues destroying you and warlocks wiping the floor with you.
---
Your point isn't properly explained from the beginning. AQ40 is like 2 years after Classic launch. If you intend to main ele you should roll something else for the first 2 years and become a veteran in your guild so you can reroll once AQ hits. 
---
Also warriors don't need gear they need a team. A warrior in decent gear at phase x will still stomp everyone and everything. Shamans need a team + the gear or they just aren't a top tier class. You'd be better of bringing a resto sham to the premade before that.
---
Actually, it's the mother of Cenarion
---
Can you tank with a pvp warriors spec ? I won't be able to respec ( I know I won't farm enough ) and I will mainly PvP, so can I raid as a tank or I will have to stick to dungeon (or first tier raid only ) ?

There is also talk about storming Area 51. Let's not pretend what random people say has any merit.

No ones claiming the games are good due to gross profits so it‚Äôs not the same. And if asked I sure people have no issue rattled get off several blizzard or activisiin games that failed. Does that cover your ‚Äòargument‚Äô or you just trying to be an asshat?
---
Trash maybe, but how is this clickbait? The headline wasn‚Äôt misleading. It‚Äôs literally about an investor saying disney should buy the company.
---
Sorry to hear. On the plus side, considering that the majority of people coming back to classic now are in their 30s or older you might find quite a few people in a similar boat as you are. The crowd should be through the bank older than it used to be - and even back then there were a few guilds aimed at olders guys and gals who couldn't play as much for health or work reasons. So just look for the right guild :)
---
last year on ely i was consistently doing very well on our heal meter (and on legacy logs), and my overhealing was pretty much insignificant compared to our priests and shamans.  I even used the regrowth crit talent, and HT of many ranks.  I enjoyed playing for efficiency and for the clutch moments when you save someone, or when a bunch of other healers die and just a couple of you make it work
---
i just flat dont believe that "spamming R3 healing touch" is optimum at all.  maybe if you were testing outside org/IF but not in a real situation
---
Being short and thicc is fashionable these days.
---
&gt;Also feral druids can do competitive DPS you just have to be willing to farm Gnomeregan for the rest of vanilla.
---
nice
---
Eeeh, yes. Those would solve most problems of vanilla. It is hard to gear up and find a raid group, so LFR would be really great. And you often have to travel far to get to a raid, sometimes rogues will even attack you on your way. If you can just fly it makes things way easier.
---
Dont think about the leveling "spamming" keys, think about how your class will play at 60! 
---
leveling is a grind, at 60 its a lifestyle where u will spend months of your life and regret it when you are 65 and missed out on life moments
---
druid is great fun healing and is very good at it, and can be so much more efficient than the others (in terms of overhealing)
---
its more down to the player than the class... sure you're not gonna beat a priest who is playing his heart out but you can still be competitive and useful
---
spamming R3 healing touch is NOT the best way to play imo
---
Do you like Sid effects?
---
Probably a server flooded by the best of the best hardcore raiders and pvpers
---
20/11/21 is probably better all round cos of feral charge - you need to kite a lot
---
What do you mean "probably"? The performance difference is measurable and it has been measured. I don't know why you're clinging to this "5%".
---
I know Intel is completely screwed right now for everything except gaming, and  next gen AMD will overtake them in gaming. Intel is in trouble. However we upgraded my girlfriend's PC to a 9900K a few weeks ago once the 3900X benchmarks came out. My 7700K will most likely be upgraded to an AMD when it's time.
---
AMD has made the i3 and i5s completely redundant. But they haven't done so to the i7s or i9s *yet*. Regardless of you claiming they're functionally equal.

I'll buy whatever is better for gaming.

You didn't see the last duel tournament on the beta did you. Ele shaman was melting faces and won the whole thing at lvl 40.

Requires stealth and being behind your target. If those 2 criterias are met you Ravage.
---
I mean his comment literally said ‚ÄúIs it good? For me it‚Äôs not.‚Äù
---
Flying is probably one of the biggest problems of retail WoW. It absolutely destroys immersion. Besides, the idea of Classic is to not cater to the masses. LFR ruins the feeling of achievement and community around guilds, raid progression etc.
---
So no, I really hope they don't add either of those.
---
To be fair this kind of optimization is probably never required but like with many things in life, there's always room for improvement if you're open to it.
---
Hey that‚Äôs me
---
Everybody knows MMO players survive on Doritos and energy drinks. This is nonsense
---
Thanks for the info. Puts things into perspective. Seems like a little too much grind to reach rank 14 for me. I was expecting a grind but didn‚Äôt realize I‚Äôd have to play everyday of every week for hours and hours to be able to gain rank. One more question, once you get, let‚Äôs say for example, rank 11, do you have be playing constantly to maintain that rank? Like if you don‚Äôt play for a month, will your rank decrease and will you lose the ability to wear the gear or lose your title?
---
Or maybe you can learn to read? I literally said "Tanking has a few niche places". Full tier 3 gear at only certain fights in Naxx. Yeaaah, because that is totally not a niche scenario, right?. Not only will most people not get that gear, even if you get full tier 3 or close enough to make it work and raid Naxx you are only really better at certain fights.
---
*You* have to stop your fanboy propaganda. I never said they have absolutely no place, but realistically, you will not get to tank much as a bear and the places where you are actually better than a warrior are not many, hence niche. GET IT, *BRO?*
---
Doritos and Mountain Dew it is
---
I don‚Äôt hold grudges - I hold 2H weapons üòé
---
Why do you think they had planned each stress test 1 month between them ? Why do you think the 3rd stress test was (originally) planned so that taking in part of that would not cover any gametime after release ? Why do you think name reservations is 2 weeks before launch ?
---
Because they want your sub money. Race changes and stores give good money, yeah. But if you can MILK the whole player base for 1-3 extra months, its FREE extra money.
---
+1% crit = +1.3% to all attacks and abilities. 
---
4/1.3=5.2, so if you attack more than 6 times per multishot - which you do, including almost 2 aimed shots on average - the crit is better.
---
On private servers. With parry and resistance changes we don't know yet. Druids might be viable in Classic but they might just as well be useless like in Vanilla Retail. Time will tell.
---
Ps: For those considering niche classes think about this. Will I have time to reroll another class if my niche spec doesn't work out? Or can I go another spec and still enjoy this class? Druid tanks aren't close to any other spec available to them.
---
U can search the sub reddit. And one Guy was Nice enough to have done 6 different benchmark tests.. He has posted and reposted on this subreddit. Search benchmark after /r/classicwow
---
A Threat meter. Pulling and threat are entirely different animals than the are in retail. If you want dungeons to go faster the answer is not to jump in quickly with all your dps, but instead it is to wait for your tank to establish threat and then have a threat meter so you don't pull off him. Your healer will use less mana, drink less often and everything will go faster.
---
Yep, and at some point your body will begin consuming unused limbs muscle mass

You will lose rank but not the ability to use gear/mounts.

Edit: he actually died of a pulmonary embolism which I guess is different from a blood clot but honestly the guy was a piece of shit and I'm happy he died. 9/11 was an inside job and anyone who says otherwise is a bought&amp;paid-for Soros shill. 
---
Big Money OOOOOOOOOUUUUUUUUUUUUT
---
And post.
---
Yes, at level 40
---
No they can't. Using it is not the same as putting it to good use. When almost anything with agility on it will work out better for them, they're not putting the staff to good use.
---
Thanks! But the 1.3% number, where is that from? Also, would the crit be more useful the lower crit you already have, or is this more sort of a static figure where "crit is always X good" ?
---
The server choses the player.
---
Agenda pushing? What agenda???
---
&gt; I felt like druid was a ~~half assed~~ viable healer, tank and dps. ~~Pretty much an~~ On top of that innervate ~~bot~~ and battle res. Marvelous!
---
What?
---
Just a heads up, fastest &amp; easiest method to level a priest is actually going Holy (but picking Wand spec &amp; Spirit Tap first) until 40. Something like this - https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/05003-23505000102-5
---
At 40, respec Shadow, since Shadowform is a huge DPS boost and with it Shadow outperforms the Smiter build.
---
The logic is that Mind Blast is extremely mana heavy and Mind Flay is a pretty bad spell early. Also Shadow talents, especially the first half of the tree outright suck for leveling (excluding spirit tap, of course.
---
You'll be using Holy fire, 2-3 Smites and then wanding, keeping with PW:Shield on. You'll have mana coming out of the ass, literally never have to drink solo. Also while healing dungeons, it's a fun minigame to try to snipe last hits with Holy fire.
---
Trading in my ivory raptor :(
---
I sure as hell don't! I would triple my weight and that's really a lot!
---
Since I played in the evenings and on weekends, dinner wasn't the problem as I always ate with my family or friends. The problem was the weekend when I had nothing to do (i.e. every weekend). I got a big loaf of bread (1kg) from the baker and drank either Coke or EnergyDrinks.  And in the afternoon there was at least one bag of chips and one bag of popcorn each. every damn weekend. Well, since I don't train any more, that would put a lot of kilos on my ribs.
---
Carrot sticks and water while playing and otherwise only meals at the family table. I will not survive like this.
---
have to agree with everyone else on the pacingand the non fluff, my only critique would maybe have the item's skin next to the tooltip
---
Heyo! I'll add a few and the "why" I use it, maybe some alternatives.
---
I just figured mid-writing that I have to categorize so you don't waste your time. I'll structure it in "Must-have" and "Useful" and "Raiding"
---
*Must have (imo)*
---
1) Elvui - Makes everything in the UI moveable and editable (skins n stuff). I barely use any of the visuals besides Actionbars and Raid-Frame. You can also add Action Bars. Profiles can be safed aswell and other actually useful features. I think in Classic X-Perl was a thing, but I'm not certain which are the other big names that will be running on Classic
---
\- Elvui includes multiple other addons that are merged into it, like auto-repair, auto-selling grey stuff, merging bags together, showing gold/inventory on each character while being on another character, castbars and more -- and if I didn't mention it yet, you can turn anything to default that does not please you
---
2) A Damage Meter, I prefer "Details!". As any proper damage meter you can change how you want the DPS measured (effective dps on/off). Details as the name suggests let's you also use it for more in-depth analysing. Not for blaming but for improving if used correctly. You can see who had which buffs up for how long, who broke CCs (this especially safed so much time in BfA because some random trait bugged out one of the guildies in Uldir and I could easyly see what happened)
---
\- If using Elvui you can load AddonSkins and include any Damage Meter (Skada etc.) into Elvui's Interface. Looks really smooth.
---
3) Atlas + Atlas Loot - Even if less useful in Retail WoW currently, I have this installed since I Casually played on a TBC Server. In Classic this will be a good help again.
---
*Useful*
---
4) Auctioneer or alternatives because of the bad Auction House we still have after 15 years :P
---
5) WeakAuras2 - This is basically a platform for scripts. There are tons of good WeakAuras to import, I'll list a few functions made by different people, so you can see if that makes sense for you.
---
\- Tracking your CCs after using it with a timer so you know when it will break
---
\- Tracking Kick-CDs of your party (not raid), this can really help in any Dungeon - you can basically set up an order (top to bottom/left to right - basically whatever your UI shows) and if 2 accidentally kick together you can see that it's your turn
---
\- Tracking any cooldown, setting up your Interface with important CDs closer in sight
---
\- Tracking Enemies Skills (Bosses, Adds)
---
   and an endless amount of other things.
---
6) LittleWigs - Warning when important casts/mechanics come up in Dungeons
---
7) Gatherer (Currently GatherMate2) - Marks locations on your map where you harvested with mining/herb and others
---
8) Swing Timer
---
9) Azeroth Auto Pilot (AAP) - This is a leveling Addon sending you from quest to quest, location to location. It tries to give you the most effective path while questing (less running back and forth). It shows direction with a GPS Arrow, can share group informtion etc.
---
*Raiding*
---
10) BigWigs - same as LittleWigs but for Raids. Alternative: DBM (Deadly Boss Mods)
---
11) Exorsus Raid Tools (could not find confirmation for Classic Version yet) - Important Raid tracking like Healing CDs n stuff.
---
Also includes Notes: Raidlead can organize who does what and when including marks @names etc. and share it live with the whole raid. Nobody needs to ask multiple times, everyone can look everything he has to do up live on screen. Alternative is Angry-Assignments, basically the same thing.
---
I hope that lists helps you out a bit. If you need visual material I could make some Screenshots.
---
GL out there!
---
I keep forgetting about spirit tap
---
I loved Noggenfogger for pvp! A small ass skeleton no one sees &lt;3
---
Yes exactly, they can win pretty much every 1on1 and even 1onX sometimes, thats why reading above and misunderstanding I was being snarky before.
---
My concern is warlock priest and warrior hordeside or warlock paladin warrior alliside. I'm past most of the class choices but I still need to choose a faction which has proven difficult.
---
Wow üò∞ I‚Äôve had reddit for too long to not know that
---
If you see the downvoting I have received that will be the proof. 
---
The clue is that I used dkp purely as a selfish thing. I had no desire to increase my dps and thereby contribute more. I did relatively good dps in the first place but that was only because I know how the rotation work. 
---
I played with good looking gear. I would even play without upgrades because they did not look good. Thankful for me I played a lot of pvp and pvp gear you got from ranking was also pretty good for pve with an arms warrior.
---
AGREEED!!!
---
Do the best raider get penalised with grays?
---
Thats not how it works, thats not how anything works.
---
Your welcome
---
You should be doing most of the LAST 5 seconds of damage with rolling dots and just using wand. So you are out of 5s rule when you get spirit tap. It will boost your HP (ppl seem to ignore this part a lot) and mana regen by a fuckton. Its what makes you not to drink... ever.
---
But you need to abuse that talent. Aka get good wands, aka lesser and greater magic wands. 
---
Axe of Orgrimmar is 11.8 dps weapon. Greater magic wand is 17.5 dps, 5/5 talents makes it 21.9 dps weapon. You can use both \~at same level.
---
Except we were discussing top tier things not whats viable. Some people have to learn that almost anything and everything is viable. Meaning it can be done. But thats not top tier. 
---
Wording matters. I get what you mean but you should pay more attention to wording and context when reading peoples posts.
---
Yes, RP-PvP for everyone!
---
Release the Druids, let them conquer your lootz!!
---
Ahjeigkfndb can you fucking read? It wasn't I who said it, it was another bloke. 
---
Context mentioned shred, meaning out of stealth no stun. Not that hard to understand is it?
---
Prot Warrior OS Fury. I'll level with a set group of friends/family while hybrid-ing Fury/Prot as much as possible.
---
For 60 our intent is to grind the necessary MC Rep/Keys and find a guild. If we find a good guild we'll have a chat whether or not I can stay Prot as a MT in the Guild. If not I'll just go Fury.
---
PvP will be interesting. I don't have much experience with PvP yet, so I will probably try out everything Prot/Fury/Arms  and see what happens and what feels best.
---
I was less than a bar from 60. Accepted into my guild's AQ run because they had a few slots open.
---
Qiraji Sacrificial Dagger drops. There's one other rogue in the raid. He says he doesn't want it. Raid leader gives it him anyway because "Chain isn't getting it, not level 60 yet"
---
I tell them I can go be 60 in a couple minutes. Guild leader isn't having it despite other rogue saying I should get it and me dinging 60 only a few minutes later.
---
Wish I remembered the GLs name... Guild was Risen Sacrifice back on Dragonmaw.
---
There's also the problem of lacking knowledge. You're grabbing 3 random people assuming their input will be useful. I have literally no idea what healing items druids, Paladins or priests need. I have very little caster knowledge too. Same with tank. 
---
There's also the problem of forcing 3 random people in a position of power they might not feel comfortable in.
---
Odds are 99% of the loot will be decided by the core members anyway. The 3 rotating players will just follow the core's recommendations.
---
Like, u/NovercaIis do you really think a random player will speak up against the GM and the 2nd in command?
---
The guild I'll likely be in has an officer that told me if I raid, I'll be powershifting dps or not joining them at all. This was supposed to be a guild that lets people play the way they want. I'm seriously considering bouncing on them. Feral cat and tanks are both more than viable. With everything they bring to the table as far as support goes, even with shit dps they are valuable.
---
Pick the stealth talents, slap on your Darkmantle boots and cloak stealth enchant and enjoy being LITTERALLY THE MOST STEALTHY PERSON ON THE SERVER!
---
But how is the class fantasy of druid not fulfilled in Classic?
---
Class fantasy: jack of all trades, master of none
---
Druid in Classic: jack of all trades, master of none
---
Please use the search function, this has been asked and answered numerous times. However, [I made this post recently](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c23tlc/i_spent_600_buying_old_pc_parts_to_benchmark_the/) which might be of specific use.
---
Most of the American people here don't know what you mean ahah
---
You asked a question and received an answer. Sorry it was not the answer that fit your narrative.
---
On a boss in ZG I hearthed midfight. Thought I was casting the Priest group heal spell. Was a bit too stoned to raid at the time I think...
---
A ret paladin wont be able to keep up if the guild is casual though, unless he goes hardcore which defeats the purpose of a casual guild
---
Creating a Troll Male Shaman instead of Tauren.
---
Never said they were good reasons; just that they're the top 5.
---
I prefer Bongos.
---
Ditching them cause you want to tank? If you dps you have to powershift.
---
I love the idea, though it seems extremely unlikely to ever happen
---
I feel you. I have the same problem. Permanent RSI. 
---
Fortunately I can play non-twitchy games like WoW still in a decent manner (no PvP though...adrenalin + straining gives me pain within 30 minutes).
---
So I tried something new: Bought the 3 foot pedals which were memed here and actually gonna try if I can handle movement with that (1 pedal forward, the other 2 to strafe). That frees up one hand completely. They haven't been delivered yet, so I cannot test it.
---
ElvUI. Yuuuuck.
---
We could also murder people so those heartbeats are totally skipped!
---
Yeah there was another reply to it, where I didn't know what he was on about.
---
I can't get behind this.
---
They constantly jump onto the counters and sit with their BUTTHOLES straight on the counter. Disgusting
---
Yeah to be honest I think the rank system PvP rewards was a big flaw. That's one of the few flaws of Vanilla I would say
---
Most people just repeat what they heard elsewhere without questioning. It has been like that since the launch of the game. I don't think that will change anytime soon.
---
Lately I've seen a lot of guids thrive on YouTube that are just wrong or complete nonsense. But people believe that stuff because someone made a nice video about it.
---
Hit 30 and you will realize why only kids play Alliance. 
---
Luckily, I was 32 when I started Vanilla, and went straight Horde.
---
Can't even stand Alliance. Too gay for me.
---
Aka streamers etc. Who get paid to play. There is no way for a person with a job to get that. Rank 10-11 could be doable though.
---
Private server propaganda.
---
I agree
---
why u bully me, what is your preference though?
---
Playing a Paladin (my original main) instead of a Warlock (my current main).
---
Somewhat.
---
The priority for dps is loosely this:
---
Mages
---
Warriors
---
Rogues
---
Warlocks
---
Hunters
---
Shadow Priest (mostly for the shadow debuff talent 5/5 not shadowform and hybrid dps and healing)
---
Kitty Druid
---
Retadin/Ele shaman
---
Enhance shaman if horde
---
Oomkin
---
As for healing,
---
Paladin if Alliance
---
Priest
---
Shaman if Horde
---
Druid
---
This is a priority list - raiding works on the basis of priority, not that lower in the list won't be able to do anything at 60. A mage will do amazing damage with mediocre effort put into gearing and gameplay while a Kitty Druid has to compete for Rogue gear, has no tiers tuned to kitty dps, and lacks the utility and poisons that rogues already have. On top of that rogues are already highly competitive since there will be a lot of rogues and even some rogue BiS is shared with Fury Warriors.
---
So Kitties are forced to do their absolute best and no life the game just to come up a bit short of a rogue who only logs in on raid night.
---
Exactly. Like what they've heard private server players saying.
---
There were feral druid tanks in vanilla, they're simply not as good as warriors for the vast majority of content.
---
The problem isn't the theoretical maximum outputs that Druids can achieve. It's the gear that's needed for them to do it. MCP for every fight and iirc Druid tank viable gear only becomes available much later on or requires R13.
---
Even though it kind of makes sense, you still have some specialists in the hybrid niche if I'm not wrong (sorry not a Classic expert). F.e. Pally Buffs. Nobody else can buff that. Mark of the Wild (the Druid Buff, as said I don't know everything so sorry if there are some things wrong) and then the DoT Classes probably help out  with trash/adds quite a bit. Also Shaman totems give your party a buff, right?
---
Why did you delete it though? What was the point? You could start again without deleting it.
---
Looking forward to Pantheon 100%, but have to disagree with you in the TBC sentiment.  TBC is the best version of WoW to me.  Would be in heaven with Classic TBC.  Only thing that would make me sad about it is if Pantheon‚Äôs release really did coincide with it... P99 Green is already launching WAY too close to Classic.  Been waiting for a fresh P99 server for many years and will likely skip it as I suspect I‚Äôll be fully committed to Classic still in October when it hits.
---
I would suggest avoiding warrior tanking. Warrior tanks are very carpal tunnel likely.
---
I guess, it depends on how effective it becomes as a strategy. They have said they would implement services into classic at some point, so the question remains what comes first, a subscription price rise and parity with the the WoW token or realm transfer/name change being offered as services.
---
Seeing my RL giving the first Binding to the only guy in the raid that could a) wield it and b) had more DKP than me. Guy was a fury warrior and simply drunk. Alcohol told him he would be Maintank with that item. RL didnt want to lose face by ignoring our DKP rules and give the item to the MT that had the same guild tag as him (People in my raid were from half a dozen guilds).
---
Needless to say we never finished a Thunderfury after that.
---
Im still a bit grumpy about it.
---
I think the issue stems from Druids, especially car Druids, needing to do more work. You need to farm mana pots, dark runes, MCPs and then melee consumables. Then your BIS gear until phase 5 is rank 13 gear. 
---
It doesn‚Äôt seem like a pick for someone who can‚Äôt commit a lot of time to the game.
---
FAPs are great.
---
Not vanilla, but we had loot council on my guild during BC and tanks had the #1 priority, and I was one of them. One day this new guy with greens and blues just comes to fill a spot and by mistake the loot master sends to him an item I'd been looking to get for weeks. 
---
I told him it was a mistake and he replies "Sorry bro, I also need it" and equipped it in front of my eyes and I almost lost my shit.
---
Damn straight
---
Anybody has good ideas how can I sabotage rank 14 wannabes?
---
there was a lot of enjoyable things i agree with you, but TBC lacks the longevity of vanilla. As nice as some things are, the lack of exploration, and flying mounts, and arena's kinda shrivel the game in some ways. (Arena idea is great but not in that form of implementation)
---
* innervate
---
* battle ress
---
* shapeshifting 
---
* actually being able to damage something
---
* stealth
---
* charge
---
I mean, pally is a great class and I love it but druids can do a lot of things pallys can't vice versa.
---
Warrior+Shaman is a levelling juggernaught. 
---
Elemental is my favourite, the warrior pulls a bunch of mobs (3+) and the Shaman provides WF+Str+Magma then just goes nuts weaving Chain Lightning and Healing Wave.
---
I usually keybind HS to mouse scroll up and Cleave to down and just roll as necessary.
---
that's truly sad
---
No, druid pre-raid bis is very strong compared to prot warrior and is also easy to obtain. The main gearing problem is in early BWL because of a lack of upgrades from MC. But then even if you don't do pvp, there are a decent number of upgrades on BWL to tide you over until all the loot in AQ.
---
That's kinda their whole shtick...
---
They did have unlimited breath at one time, either the beta or early patches. It got nerfed because it was "overpowered". But apparently WoTF is totally fine compared to something any class can achieve with an item...
---
NOONE CARES ABOUT YOU AND YOUR RP PVP SERVER. Get over it man. Peace
---
It was really good you should definitely watch it
---
Phase 2 will have rank system but nto BGs, so there you have it, couple of moths of ranking through world PvP.
---
What I would adjust though is not releasing AV with WSG and AB.
---
Its like people dont understand that druid was broken for most of vanilla and was super viable in 1.12....
---
I'll be siding with Magram as it means that as soon as I get to Desolace I can run from Shadowprey village and grind nearby Gelkis centaurs for pickpocketing/cloth/xp.
---
Snatch this pebble from my hand, grasshopper.
---
Lol
---
feral dps works gr8 now that people know certain items that where counter intuitive back then work.
---
Like, we didn't even have spell rotations back then, you expect people to think that by getting some level 40 quest reward helmet + the shapeshift energy talents and mana pots is somehow the highest form of feral DPS. good lord, you actually have to do things as a druid to hurt things its spooky.
---
50g isn't even enough for $50
---
If they were in the game from the start, with shitty stats, and grt updated in match 1.10 or later, they will be in their 1.12 states from the beginning
---
I didn‚Äôt see dumb and dumber 2 even to this day, somethings I want to have a good opinion on and ignore the desperate cash grab
---
One cheesy scene does not constitute agenda pushing...

Oh meme specs just wana have fun!

Guild ninjaing the AQ gate opening on EU-Deathwing. 
---
There were several guilds competing for the AQ gate opening, but there was a cross faction agreement that the gate opening would be announced a head of time, so all guilds working towards it would be able to claim their rewards. 
---
Then, all of a sudden an Alliance guild called Ressurected opened the gate in the middle of the night, screwing over all the other guilds, including my guild. Needless to say, this caused a lot of drama, and the guild and its members became pariahs on the server. People refused to group with them, trade with them and the Horde guilds would gank them on sight.
---
I think the guild fell apart in the end, probably due to the backlash it created.
---
It comes with its flaws (just like Vanilla does), but for me it was the era of the game that I enjoyed the most during retail, and it‚Äôs the x-pac I‚Äôve enjoyed the most on the private server side as well.  Vanilla is a very close second for me, and the first half of WotLK comes in 3rd.  The game died for me after dungeon finder was implemented, so everything after Ulduar did not place for me (although ICC was great raid content).
---
I bet they're rogues that want to jack off to damage meters by doing more damage due to your sunders
---
&gt;Wording matters. I get what you mean but you should pay more attention to wording and context when reading peoples posts.
---
How ironic of you to say that. Try to read the comment section. I originally replied to someone saying ele wasn't a thing. It is either viable or downright top tier depending on when, which is obviously not useless.
---
You are the one suddenly discussing at what point they are top tier which is not relevant to this discussion. That is a discussion you started that I'm not part of.
---
Imagine having such under-developed imagination that you do not understand the fun gameplay aspects this adds.
---
Or they are serious raiders...
---
Except when that one hunter uses track hidden while wearing the engineering goggles.
---
Doubt.
---
Exactly this, I was a bear tank in BC.  Druids tend to take more dmg than prot warriors, but have the health to soak the heavier hits.  That said I could easily hold more trash than my plate wearing tank brothers.
---
Worst -&gt; Best?
---
Cat Druid
---
Rogue
---
Other Druids
---
Mage
---
Warrior
---
Shaman
---
Warlock
---
Hunter
---
Paladin
---
I do 20:4-18:6 intermittent fasting and that's how I got down to and have maintained a BMI of 20-21 from my previos 25.
---
I could see myself snacking on some fruit as a dessert, when it's still within my eating-window. But nothing with a caloric density &gt; 1.25 kcal/g.
---
Just eat enough healthy, barely processed food with a lot of fiber and bonded water and you'll be well satiated and not feel the urge to snack while playing.
---
Honestly, I'm appalled that they put this system back in the game for Classic.
---
The system is objectively bad for your physical and mental health. Why would they willingly keep a system that requires you to play 18 hours a day for 3 months straight? Fucking idiots...
---
Sorry but most guilds will still bring a warrior MT and 2 fury warriors as OT no matter what.
---
40 randomly picked up people will be able to kill onyxia 2-3 months in.
---
It might take a try or two,,but then she goes down
---
"Switching layers, please stand by"
---
Why would you cry over a system you dont need to participate in?   
---
Alot of people cry about new games are too easy, intant gratification, p2w and so on.   
---
Now we finally get a game, where you can choose to raid for 3-4 hours a week to get epics, or you can choose the nolife and rank 14 hours a day to get epics. Its your fucking choice and now people cry about having both options. Jesus christ.
---
I did, he tanks for one of the naxx wings and talks about the pros and cons of druid tanking.
---
Maybe I missed the answer, but plz don't make me rewatch the vid.
---
Check out the bestseller "How not to die".
---
It shows the relationship between the 15 leading causes of death and lifestyle choices.
---
And it teaches how to adopt a healthy lifestyle that can prevent and even reverse most of these issues.
---
Yes
---
Definitely worth trying, I had all my characters returned to me by a GM the other week and they had been gone since the start of Cataclysm. There were even ones I had forgotten about!
---
No!
---
The helm is the only R13 piece that doesn't get replaced in BWL, the shoulders and chest have upgrades in Taut Dragonhide Shoulders and Malfurions Blessed Bulwalk. In the R12 pieces there are the hands which are slightly better than the LBRS gloves, but the legs can be replaced by the Dark Heart Pants from a world dragon in phase 4, and the feet are replaced by Boots of the Shadow Flame from Nef which are bis for the entire game. Also I doubt anyone will actually get rank 13 in phase 2, even if it lasts 4 months that would probably require more time than getting rank 14 in BGs.
---
The most valuable items from pvp I would say are the AB shoulders and the WSG legs, but the reputation for one or both of those can be grinded out at a more casual pace and doesn't require as much time investment as ranking.
---
Soul Link Warlock is actually the best 1v1 class in the game.
---
When you see experienced raiders explain how Feral tanks have higher threat, take less damage and outperform Warriors in many situations do you cover your ears, close your eyes, and scream lalalalalala?
---
Pretty sure a Druid with rank 13 gear and consumables and MCP is going to beat any warrior without thunder fury on the threat meter. 
---
You‚Äôd be lowering your potential dps if you let a subpar warrior tank with lesser threat. The damage can be healed through.
---
WoTF got nerfed though. Remember early in vanilla? The immunity lasted for 20 seconds after use. It also shares a 45 sec CD with the pvp trinket, so it isn't that broken.
---
Mage all the way!
---
I mean it's true, for holy paladin t2 sucks, even blues from dungeons are objectively better.
---
T2 is good for PvP as a retri and that's it, you wouldn't need on it as a holy paladin, but obviously you won't let the item rot in the boss, so you just give it to someone for a minimal amount of DKP... But they won't even use the item.
---
If you care, go watch the other videos man. Do you need your hand held?
---
Items will be in the 1.12 state. They have been pretty firm about this.
---
That‚Äôs not true... macs run retail perfectly fine - great depending on your model
---
Balance druid can do a couple fights for sure but if one of your main tanks is a druid you will be severely gimping the raid on most fights.
---
Yes I do

I just want one so I don't have to see retarded NA names people come up with. Twistzz, Campyou, Naughtycat, etc.
---
Lore wise as in what? You got a source for that claim? Why are you bringing this golden eye shit into this? Irrelevant. 
---
Blood elves only started using fel after Kael thas went to outlands, which is after he renamed the remaining high elves to blood elves. 
---
Any elf that was using fel was a blood elf. The fact that you think the only difference between a blood elf and a high elf is choosing the name shows how ignorant you are. 
---
If the sole difference between high elves and blood elves is a simple name change to honour the fallen and nothing more than why are there still high elves? Based on your logic then all high elves would change their name to blood elves to honour their dead, I mean why wouldn't they? 
---
But you are wrong, again, which is why being called a blood elf entails more than a simple name change. 
---
Green eyes = blood elf
---
Same reason I complain about lootboxes. They're damaging to the experience as a whole and negatively impact people with obsessive/addictive personalities.
---
It's a trash system that they implemented without properly considering the consequences. Putting it back in again when they know full well exactly how harmful the R14 grind is astronomically fucking stupid.
---
The shaman can heal while the druid tanks.
---
So unless you really want to be the tank, I'd definitely go for Warlock in your situation.
---
Warior is great as long as in a group. But as soon as you are alone, everything else is better.
---
Yeah, you dont know what youre talking about. Are you purposefully ignoring the Feral Druids tanking Naxxramas and explianing how he also tanks on his Warrior and has first hand experience of Druid being better in many situations? Dont reply to posts if youre going to ignore the facts and blindly regurgitate the garbage I'm trying to clean up.

\#nochanges
---
To never try another class besides the shitty NE Rogue I played throughout the entire Classic time and to not read up on stuff myself and just follow my best friend like a fucking minion.
---
Now we just need a picture of some dimwit who's plastered his entire house in either horde or alliance flags while exclaiming that his battlestation is ready, and we'll have been through it all.
---
Someone explained to me how to use it already. Thanks for the link and I love ur content
---
It goes both ways though. I bet that quite a few people who never played Vanilla will roll feral because of all the "feral is actually viable" posts, only to realize that:
---
a)Feral is a huge time sink. You need several different sets, some caster consumables on top of the melee ones, and last but not least MCPs.
---
b)With one slot per 40-man raid, feral is the least represented non-meme spec in the game.
---
c)Since you're taking on a unique role, you will probably be required to stick to a stricter attendance schedule than other people beside the MT.
---
d)Because of the 1 slot per raid representation and the fact that being a tank requires more knowledge of encounters than playing a healer or DPS, most good guilds will have the feral spot reserved for an experienced senior member.
---
Feral is probably the second most hardcore PvE role (only behind the warrior main tank), hopeful casuals will get shrekt by the grind.
---
Why would I? Im fluent in English, even tho it's not my native language.
---
I actually think it's bad that there are language-specific realms, since being forced to use a certain language makes you have to learn it. And while it's not up to a commercial organization to decide what language you have to speak, let's be real - English is a world language. Can't hurt being able to communicatie.
---
You‚Äôd still be gimping yourself if you‚Äôre not getting the best gear available. 
---
I‚Äôm sure it depends on your guild. But I suspect most guilds who were pushing wouldn‚Äôt take a cat Druid or if you were going cat, you‚Äôd be expected to grind out rank 13 because that‚Äôs just wasted dps numbers on your part if you don‚Äôt get the gear.
---
The difference between a rogue going dagger or something over swords/fists is very little, the difference between PSing and not as a feral is like not using an offhand as a rogue because you want to rp as a fencer, the thing there is it severely hurts ur dps, to the point where u are under the tanks in damage.
---
Stupidly overpowered in 2v2 and 3v3 arena too
---
Cheers for the effort
---
i hate hunters man, always ruining stuff for others
---
playing as dps warrior in 5-man groups is great as well, if your druid is tanking you can just go full out dps as warrior, sure you'll pull a mob or two off from your tank, but that means you'll get more rage and boost your dps even more so as long as your healer knows what's going on you're just making the run go faster. and a 2-H warrior is hands down the best dps in 5-man dungeons considering their capability to switch to mitigation if shit hits the fan.  
---
Warlocks are however a solid dps class overall, not very fun rotation though ;)
---
It was introduced in Cataclysm but I don't think it actually really took off as a thing that people really loved until Draenor.
---
Some people play PC all day every day. Giving them goals is not bad.   
---
Pvp ranking was designed for nolife hardcore players and thats why the last 3 ranks are so hard.   
---
I bet your one of those guys that blame Mcdonals for your diabetes, instead of yourself.

Druid tank
---
Haven‚Äôt seen the ‚ÄúLook what I found going through my parents sex drawer!‚Äù Post with a picture of the vanilla wow strategy guide either... I‚Äôm sure we just need to give it some time.
---
Unfortunately there is no Cartographer and Move anything for Classic yet. I really hope for a GearMenu/ItemRack aswell...
---
We had a Druid MT in vanilla and we even got to Naxx with him. 
---
Never progressed there, and we outgeared a lot towards the end of Vanilla.. But as far as I remember we never really had issues.
---
Yeah, i like eating too.
---
Well in TBC all tanks are close enough to each other to be able to MT, however the "I can hold more trash" niche is firmly in the hands of Tankadins
---
Had my lvl 52 robe through entire Vanilla. My goal was to get all the dreadmist pieces. With my 7/8 Dreadmist Warlock I ran a shitton of UBRS, and the last time I begrudgingly joined a group with a additional warlock. Ofcourse it drops there and then, and the lock who had 0 dreadmist parts got the robe. Entire group wanted me to have it but the lock rolled anyway. 
---
I did try TBC a bit before rolling paladin, but other than that it was the last time I played that warlock.
---
On the very few fights they "can't handle", or on fights where it simply makes more sense to use a warrior, such as Nef/Chrom, even Onyxia... you just let the warrior tank. As a tank druid you can then either simply go cat and DPS, or you put on a heal set and heal/decurse. That's the beauty of druids, there are several different specs that differ slightly from eachother, play the one that makes most sense depending on your guild/raid needs.
---
Not answering the question here but some of these points are complaints directed at a poorly run loot council.
---
Subjective experience of course, the last guild I was in planned everything out ahead of time long before it was time to raid. Everybody knew what drops they were getting ahead of time and who was in line for what item.
---
Probably the most well ran guild I've ever been in.
---
It isnt a blizzard release if you dont wait 1hr queue just to instantly dc
---
Yea it‚Äôs pretty easy to exploit if you want. And if you a sort of caught doing it, just play ignorant and smile. Story of my life:)
---
That's definitely true, just also a bit worried about the quality of life as a warrior, and the constant need to respec and farm gold at 60, without the tools to do it properly. Conversely, as a Warlock I can raid and pvp in the same spec, get a free mount at 40, and also be a capable farmer if i need to.
---
My head says Warlock, my heart says I don't know :(
---
Just give them their own server, for fucks sake.  Call "The Lion's Pride" and be done with it.
---
As of 1.11 you could change realm.

shit, sorry, I remembered it wrong
---
Exact same formula as Vanilla.
---
I understand all that. But the point is. I'm not going to be a raider. I'll only go if they need a spot filled, and I happen to be off work that day. I'm not basing my entire character on that tiny amount of time I'll spend dpsing for the guild.
---
40 people x 5 minutes is 200 minutes of time....
---
With information like this we can assume it will work out fine with Druids as MT.
---
Clearly you aren't prepared to look at the actual benchmarks so we're running in circles. If you're happy with "5% FPS less" it's your money.
---
For the most part you spam regrowth rank 3/4 depending on your gear - you can use rank 1 regrowth before a fight to proc nature's grace if you want too. You use some healing touch yes, probably about 20% of your casts can be HT r4 on targets where you're not worried about getting sniped. Also you should throw some rejuv on the tanks from time to time.
---
Ironforge is probably the only thing that I envy the alliance for. Fortunately, I will have plenty opportunities to "pay a visit"
---
But it‚Äôs still good advice. I love druids and I know I‚Äôm nowhere near as good as other classes. But man they are fun to play. And in the end I get to perform my favorite role - healer.
---
I mean no one really needs advice on playing any class. I tried out every class on pservers. And the only class I hate is rogue. Any other class is fun to play. Well I‚Äôm not gonna go shadow priest for raiding. I know certain classes perform best at certain role and I respect that. But I‚Äôm sure as hell not gonna play dwarf priest just because of min/maxing. I love Night Elves and I‚Äôm gonna play them a lot.
---
And I am gonna finish every raid.
---
It's not really a regret, but what comes closest to it is rerolling way too often.
---
RpPvP at launch Blizz. Do yourself a favor.
---
He's not dead. In a Norwegian prison.
---
It's amazing. Especially if you find places to AoE grind.
---
Stoneskin (significant damage reduction on a warrior), WF, and Magma Totem, while the warrior is dumping Whirlwind etc proccing WF left and right, it's what dreams are made of.
---
I don't know who you've been talking to but its not only useful in speedruns by any means. It's slightly harder to pull off in MC but personally I would use regrowth from late MC all the way through AQ in every raid, and will generally top the meters on most raids until priests get more T2 (after that I can get very close to the top but not past priests).
---
At 9 yo, I made my first character a strong elf warrior when I was 9. I was doing my quest, killing monster nothing could stop me.
---
When suddenly, I saw some guy riding a freaking tiger ! This guy was sooo cool, I wanted  to have a tiger too but I was too shy to ask and didnt know about whisper at that time anyway. So I tried to follow him, we ran through some gate and some new place .
---
Eventually, I lost him because he was too fast. Here I am, a lvl 3 warriors among lvl 8 spider and wolf chasing me. Monster were too strong and I had no idea how to get back to the beginning. I was sad because I made lots of progress on this character. I resigned myself and deleted this character because I thought he was doomed.
---
Then I made a dwarf Hunter far away from the maze of the elf, so I wouldn't get lost again and so I could tam my tiger. I was actually really disappointed when I learnt you couldn't ride your pet.
---
Eh, i don't know your guild of course, but i'd say most guilds expect people to be at least 60-70% optimal, even if they are just warm body filling.
---
At level 40, but even with just prebis blue gear at 60 they have ridiculous burst.
---
yeah...
---
alao Druid TPS is insane if the player is ready to stack up on Pummelers. this is even more true for Druid OTs in comparison to Warri Prot Builds (even Prot-Impale), and especially on Ally side (since on Horde side, druids dont get WF)
---
To be fair, the battle rez is not used in at least half of raids in my experience. By far the most valuable thing druids bring is faerie fire - if you're not trying desperately to top healing meters you should focus on getting as much FF uptime as possible.
---
JFC, READ MY POSTS. I'm going to be a BEAR druid for pvp and 5 mans. I dont give 2 flying fucks about powershifting cat form once every few months if ever.
---
I played on RpPvP back in TBC and it was never enforced and trolls had to suffer no consequences. Rp was still fun. Blizzard never really cared about Rp even back in the early days.
---
English server.

I want my WoW-Classic server to be actually full and i hate germanz in MP games, they always think they're superior but most of the times they're just toxic trash.
---
Most people have no choice but to work 40+ hours a week. Choosing to do less will lead to what I've described.
---
tested in beta? :(
---
no
---
IIRC they said they were thinking about adding those services at some point
---
Great thanks!
---
It gave either a plate chest or mail pants IIRC.  
---
Also i lost it 3 times in vanilla and i am 100% sure nobody ever did the quest that won it and if my memory serves me right 1-2 of them were not mail or plate users.  
---
Can't remeber if i ever got it while running the place in the xpansions after but i don't think so.
---
You probably missed the 2nd level 40 tourney, Cdew didn't come close to the finals in the 2nd one.
---
Match up luck plays a big role in tourney outcomes, the 2nd time around Cdew didn't just face mages for the most part.
---
On the one hand I appreciate the commitment to fidelity. On the other... Getting rank 14 for a single human being is nearly impossible. I don't know a single soul that did it without account sharing and honestly I don't know how a single person could. 
---
You'd have to be insane to even try to do it by yourself. It is by far the worst part about classic wow. Hands down.
---
All that said; I don't know how to even try to change it and still have it be an accomplishment.
---
You only play prot if you're a main or sometimes off-tank in a guild, and there's plenty of room for several dps warriors in guilds, so don't worry about respeccing unless you aim to be the MT :)

Any chances for a priest version? Pls :)

I figured Arms might be considered less viable.

I just finished Rise of the Horde yesterday. It‚Äôs good - not the best book I have ever read by any means - but I learned a lot about the lore and had fun reading it. It made me really hyped to play classic, the only

problem is it made me want to change to shaman and I‚Äôve already committed to another class.
---
how do you figure that leveling **before** lvl 51 will not be hard? you think ppl wont gank the hell out of STV to bait your main?
---
You go around spouting a bunch of dumb shit, you know that?
---
You are saying "I think they will do X" and then following up with "where is the blue post confirming they will not do X" so the conclusion must be "they are going to do X".
---
There is no blue posts confirming they will not do every single crazy idea you can come up with.
---
NO CHANGES!
---
Was it Hakkar?!? Did you spread that fucking plague in Orgrimmar killing hundreds of players?
---
Druids start out as really strong tanks for all content. Their issue is they have a really hard time keeping up with the gear curve that warriors have. Having their tier set itemized for tanking is a huge advantage for warriors.
---
This!
---
You could do so in late classic, it‚Äôs one of the few actual additional money makers for them... knowing activision i bet they‚Äôll get in the game at some point.
---
you mean the "we're committed to the vanilla experience" statements?
---
This.

Thanks for pointing this out, holy is indeed faster pre 40

Speaking of picking a class....
---
I'm 100% playing paladin. Love the class fantasy, love the spells. I was never a healer though, so i'll learn something new along the way
---
If you‚Äôre interested in Druid tanking tips just did a deep dive with an absolute genius of a Druid / warrior tank named skarm who shows how viable tanking as a Druid is in classic despite what everyone said. Super cool seeing people still learning new things in a 14 year old game
---
Uhm really? I thought hunters were always needed cuz of their dispel and kiting
---
Yes. BGs will be cross realm and the competition to enter the higher brackets of rank points will be easier because the starting pool of players you're competing with are less into PvP by default, because they chose a PvE server from the start.
---
Shadowmeld is still damn handy, but ill take your word on tje dodge.
---
Just spam frost shock vs warriors easy win
---
We did that way back when, we were just sneaky about it.

Just don't invite classes that can use your desired item.
---
Lol. Intermittent fasting.

I've read through most of the comments, and speaking as a ret Paladin who's endgame goal is getting tier 0.5; I'm sorry this sub is elitist fckn cancer.
---
Hey I think Kargoz made some YouTube content about this a while ago. He also had another YouTuber he was working with that made a spreadsheet showing xp per mob based on lvl comparison between classic and pserver. Can't remember that guys name, you should be able to find it though.
---
I've only known a handful of top speedrunning guilds actually *require* rank 14 on warriors, anyone else requiring it is just a wannabe guild thats not as good as it thinks it is. My own guild is hardcore and is encouraging people to rank but requiring it would be a recipe for massive burnout. My point is that for 99% of guilds and even the majority of hardcore guilds you won't need to get rank 12/13 to be a very good bear tank - the rewards from ranking aren't nearly as good for druids as they are for warriors anyway.
---
Their damage doesn't really scale well late game.  They kind of plateau after BWL.  Full raids don't really want many late game.  Maybe 2 or 3.
---
yes I'm saying "I think they will have it at 50g" and then following up with "does anybody have any source explicitly stating 50g?"
---
The problem with your conclusion is that absence of evidence isn't evidence of absence.
---
It's okay to say "no there is no source for that, it's just so much expected that nobody ever asked", but that's not the same as saying "it is definitely gonna be 50g".
---
smh stop making changes blizz
---
Have you played retail recently?
---
Your reading comprehension is below that off an average 12-year-old. You should stop arguing on posts if you can't even read properly.
---
Yep. While it is an instance it is still classified as an outdoors zone.

This also works in AQ.

50% want Classic TBC :E, fuck flying mounts :/

There isn't going to be hardcore guilds using DKP. I'd venture to say 90% of the guilds that kill C'thun will be usking loot council.
---
50g with it going down 5g each week you don't respec.
---
&gt;Exactly this, I was a bear tank in BC. 
---
Exactly what? BC was very different to Vanilla in terms of class balance (probably the biggest upgrade in terms of gameplay). I tanked heroics and some raid bosses myself on my prot paladin, but that doesn't mean I can claim that prot paladins are going to be tanking raid bosses in MC. It doesn't work that way. Very different games all together.
---
No one asked
---
How did you find PVPing on a warrior in Vanilla outside of marshall premades?
---
Wow, that‚Äôs a harsh response.
---
Sorry. All I wanted to say is that people should just try to play a class for awhile to see if they like the play style and the fantasy and all that.
---
Sorry if it seemed I attacked you or anything. Wasn‚Äôt my intention at all. 
---
And people can raid as any spec if the raid group accepts them. They‚Äôe not gonna be really good at it, but I think it‚Äôs doable. 
---
Again - sorry if I seemed aggressive earlier.
---
I'm still going to do it every chance i get. A 1/5 chance of dying and suffering a small repair bill is worth the hilarity of a Doomguard running around.
---
well that's disappointing

Haha jokes on you! My heartbeat is irregular!
---
i have so many internet stories like this, i hope all those guys i lost touch with are doing ok. Back then internet people were actually real friends
---
Your 2nd link looks clean &amp; great, but sadly lacks alternatives. If there would be top 2-5 items as alternatives I'd definitely use this interface
---
Trying to do too much. Guild leading, raid leading AND going for high rank PVP. It led me to burn out twice.
---
err... if respec cost is 50g, then a 99% reduction would be 50s (100s = 1g, 5'000s = 50g, 5'000 \* 0,01 = 50)?
---
For real. I want to make a standard response to anyone who disagrees. Like.. Why the fuck would someone disagree with this shit? Do they not want a second option for a tank? People havent had to worry about threat in 10 years so I guess its sort of understandable that they just understand the benefits.
---
Efficient leveling for priest consists of shadow word pain, barrier and wanding iirc. If you have excess mana, you can throw in the occasional shadowspell
---
&gt;That which can be asserted without evidence, can be dismissed without evidence.

/thread
---
I read just well, you just can't acknowledge being wrong and now you even stopped trying to argue and just lowered yourself to insult as if that makes you more right.
---
If you think they are reliable tanks just run a raidguild your own with a druid maintank and prove us that you can clear MC as fast as others.
---
Not needed, no. But dx12 does allow to thread more tasks away from main than dx11 does.
---
Dude it was 50 in beta then they lowered it just for beta.... you are way over thinking this it will be 50 Max just like it was at beta start, they lowered it during beta to help with testing...

IMO i think warcraft 3 played a bit part of people choosing horde - personally I thought Thrall was the greatest thing ever during w3

Just read half the comments to this post mate, its like they all go blind and deaf the second the video of a Druid tanking Naxx loads up and come up with 20 different bullshit reasons why its not true.

Tranq shot as well
---
wasn't it "every month" in vanilla?
---
I remember once in LBRS I was stood next to an Orc and a Tauren who were room mates at University, we had a bit of down time so were just shooting the shit, they were funny guys as I recall. Anyway, the Orc started running on the spot, then just faded away before our eyes. The Tauren turned to me and said:
---
'That's not good. We share the same connection...'
---
Then he disappeared too.

I don't know why that stuck with me, it was like Infinity War circa 2006

Hi, /u/Mojoturner

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/chmhhr/lf_a_spellcleave_group_for_day_13/). 
---
Yes, lets assume every thing in classic is going to different from Vanilla, unless explicitly stated by Blizzard in a blue post they are going to be the same.
---
We don't need the to document the changes the smallest subset, no no we need to make the document every single feature that is the same, WE NEED EVIDENCE GOD DAMMIT!!!!
---
You just don't want the price to be same the so you choice the most nonsensical stance to keep the dream alive.
---
Maybe you shouldn't use private server footage to prove your point. Use actual vanilla as a source instead and people might believe you.
---
Congratulations, you wrote many words, none of which were even close to answering the question.
---
and what did I assert without evidence?
---
Not sure if we actually are all that different.
---
I actually had fun in doing what I did and maybe it even was the right thing to do given the information I had back then.
---
The only reason to regret what I did was that when BC came out, it meant that I would miss the content that there still was to explore.
---
But this was out of my control. So can I really regret something because something that I didn't know back then made it a bad decision in hindsight?
---
I read in another reply in this thread someone regretted selling certain items when BC came out. And I thought the same: There was no way to know back then that one day there will be transmog. So it was the logical decision to sell gear that would just waste valuable bank-slots.
---
So the people tanking AQ 40 and Naxx with a Druid and seeing firsthand how they outperform Warriors on certain fights.. theyre all wrong? Or theyre all stupid and wrong? How many guilds ahve you lead through Naxx again?
---
Tbc made a lot of classes more viable and mainstream
---
For the minimalist, MoveAnything and Align is all you need.
---
As I stated 70 days ago "the next 100 days leading up to wow classic release will be the most exciting part of classic. Once released, everyone will be hating on it just like they do to every blizzard game"
---
C2-C3, 2v2 EU
---
Meh, I don't think it was that harsh, not trying to offend you. Take it as you will.
---
&gt;All I wanted to say is that people should just try to play a class for awhile to see if they like the play style and the fantasy and all that. And then pick what they wanna play.
---
Well, the game isn't out yet so people can't try it, not everyone wants to go on a pserver and test things. But "pick what they wanna play" is a fine advice, my point is you specifically said people should just pick their favourite class fantasy, but many people might like the class fantasy but not the actual class. I like all class fantasies in classic, but only like to actually play less than half the classes. Many people are like this, which is why you can't just say "pick a class fantasy, that's all there is to it".
---
You use the devilsur primarly for the 2%hit chance. 
---
If you decide to go for the pvp item. May i suggest you go for the two set bonus.
---
This seems reasonable to me.
---
I know it was only the beta, and that fearing my mob couldn't do anything but inconvenience me (3 times), but you had no reason to do it except I presume for content on your stream. But I remember you WeAreBob you arrogant French fuck, and I will remember you in Classic.
---
Do you know what the most BS part of all this is? "Play what ever you want, as long as you have fun" and "only warriors can tank/if you spec elemental you're not viable for anything" being uttered in the same comment. Come 27th I'm done with this sub. I'm only here because I'm so starved for content.
---
Oh ya, I think someone in my guild did the same thing. I'm gonna consider that, though I do like zooming my camera in and out a lot too. What did you change that action to?
---
have fun playing a mage in AQ40 and BWL
---
It will happen when top progression guilds stream their raids with a Bear MT.
---
Most pleb guilds in this game just follow some guide about the "ideal" raid comp. There are even threads about "ideal raid comp" in this subreddit. That's probably the best way to continue this discussion, tbh.If you don't present some counter argument to the "gospel", then tanks will just continue to be Warriors 99% of the time.
---
I am forgiving on aspect of the pack. You know they cast it to help everyone move way faster, but you also know that it's very easy to forget you turned it on and hunters are generally not the ones noticing it because they don't get hit first in a dungeon.
---
Any good hunter would disable autogrowl upon entering a dungeon and problems occuring due to that are indeed annoying and unnecessary
---
Idk the current gold bots prices, but 20g for 20$ is WAY too low.
---
It capped at 50, but started at 1. It's a reduction from the starting amount.
---
See if it's recoverable! Bring him back!
---
You don't need rank 13 gear or even consumables to do that, only MCP.
---
My RHR ranges between 40 and 45 BPM, awake and sitting at a desk. I'm reasonably fit but not that fit. I've been to see specialist doctors about it and the only answer I have is that nothing is wrong and some people just have slower hearts than others.
---
The current theory crafting and guides that people are following and researching right now in prep for Classic... All from private servers. Are you going to explain to me how they are wrong about Druid tanking when the meta didnt even exist until recently? No one in vanilla knew how to build or play Feral. But please, go on and explain..
---
Lol' Tar, Ogar!
---
Mostly just to play with friends, though. I enjoy and have played both factions. Will be horde in classic as well.

You made zero comments from the time your account was created 129 days ago and that‚Äôs the what you decided on as your first... just wow.

100%. Will not be a Tauren Hunter again as I was an easy to see target. He was so pretty though q\_q

I was trying to say it‚Äôs good advice if they‚Äôre just in it for the lore and fantasy. I‚Äôm in it for it too, but if I hate the play style, I‚Äôd drop the class immediately.

I‚Äôm not trying to say they should just play because of the fantasy. I love the fantasy and fiction for the assassins in the assassins creed series, but dropped the game because it got really bad over time.
---
That‚Äôs why I wanted to say people don‚Äôt need advice on playing certain classes or whatever. When the games come out, they can try and see if it fits them. That‚Äôs all I wanted to say.
---
I've done it both ways and the guild I'll be in isnt doing it.
---
Simply put, it comes down usually to 1 of 2 main reasons:
---
1.  They just like something else more.
---
2.  They dont want to deal with the flip side of the coin that LC can bring, aka perceived or actual favoritism or loot drama.
---
My guild for classic is running a custom version of suicide kings that, while I have no experience with it, they've ran in all their previous iterations fine, so I trust the leadership.
---
I think more so than WHAT your guild runs, it's HOW the guild runs loot.  If the leadership is transparent in their thoughts, reasoning, and decisions, listens and ilicits input from members often and early, and can demonstrate they take that input into consideration even if they go a different direction, a guild will handle loot well no matter the system.
---
This reminds me of a friend who had been having internet issues all night and had disconnected a few times already.  
---
We see him running on the spot and over voice chat ask him if his internet is okay. We just hear this anguished "NOOOOOOO-" and he immediately disconnects from the voice chat as well. It was just so well timed and that made it that much funnier.
---
Threat should never be an issue and thus it really doesn't matter.
---
Because I‚Äôve exposed the pro-layering arguments to be flawed.
---
Yep, I've gotten quite a bit of feedback on this point, so I'll be highlighting that more clearly. Apparently a lot of people here have been in guilds where officers existed for no reason other than to pump up their egos.
---
Dwarf master race. Nothing beats having on demand counter to warrior, rogue and hunter tools that prevent you from stealthing.
---
If world pvp awarded more honor it wouldn't be that way. Kills in BGs give the same amount of honor so if you want to be efficient and rank up BGs are your only option
---
&gt;It's not abusing at all.
---
Its the built in retard how DKP will eventually "work" in any guild. Ppl know the important big items. Bank EVERY FUCKING last point to get that and even let real upgrades to be disenchanted to get that one item. Or wait that everyone gets the other shit for free.
---
Items to look out for (healer): WILDGROWTH SHOULDERS, Cauterizing ring. REJUV GEM. Empowered leggings. Lok'Amir, Pure Ele ring. FALSE PROFET mace. TWISTING NETHER hammer etc.
---
Yeah I am stuck between paladin and Druid. It would be easy if I could play my old Draenei shaman but fuck playing horde.
---
You are gonna wanna mb into pain then wand to finish and get tap this will keep you topped off and help from going oom early on.
---
Please buy it and let Blizzard become its own entity.
---
The wand vendor, depends on which city you are in.
---
The core of this post was a comment I made in the 4-Day Chat about loot distribution and guild structure. I just elaborated on that.
---
Yeah, played for many years and I didn‚Äôt learn about weapon swapping in combat until Nef in BWL and only used it there
---
I leveled them to 20 and 30. But whatever.
---
Disregard everything I said.
---
Issue with arms is debuff slot, but ye I agree that nobody really cared back then. I hope there'll be significantly large groups who still don't care, they'll be lucky to have raids actually challenging.
---
My condolences for your boner loss.
---
lol no. it's a one way ticket
---
It's just the internet, man. Don't take it too seriously.
---
Your sources are forum posts. Just peoples words as you have put it - therefore, they are just as strong as other people words in this thread. Including mine. Hillsbrad Battles continued right up to BC on my server (Defias Brotherhood EU)
---
You were discussing what was viable tho....
---
Engineering is not required. Regardless of what the min-maxers will tell you. That being said. It is both extremely useful (teleporters) and LOADS of fun! (exploding sheep - not sure if they are in classic but it was the first thing that came to mind)
---
The ones in Ungoro? Didn't they drop expensive barrels like 50ish silver a pop
---
He pop Shield wall but keep forgeting
---
To be fair - druids got their talent revamp really late in vanilla. So for 90% of what people were remembering, they were significantly worse than they'll be in classic.
---
Most people don‚Äôt seem to do healing assignments in pugs from what I have seen.
---
I met a guy randomly in Teldrassil while leveling, and it turned out we both were noobs and of the same nationality. We became best buds, levelled together for a good couple of weeks, did our first elite quest together, etc. It was a blessing, since none of my friends played, and I could barely communicate in english back then, but after like a month, I couldn't pay my subscription (I was 14 and poor as shit), and I didn't tell him, because I was scared that he wouldn't want to play together anymore. By the time I got back into the game (2 or 3 month later), he wasn't logged in for like 40 days, and he only was 2 levels above compared to when I left. I was really sad, probably I was his only friend on the realm and he quit the game/rerolled somwhere else. I should've told him I was coming back, maybe we would still be friends :(
---
It really is a huge QoL improvement.
---
There was also a bejeweled add-on to kill time when flying. Not sure if it would still work
---
I‚Äôm confused? This topic is about which machines can run Classic right or am I missing something?
---
I had an arch rival in my guild who disagreed with my preferred DKP system so I pursued a poisonous vendetta against him over the course of months, culminating in an expos√© thread on the guild forums where evidence was presented against me and I was asked to leave. I regret not crushing my enemies beneath my heels.
---
The other side of the coin is that before 40 hunter gear basically is always someone else's 'higher prio-need' than hunter'. Except bows. As a hunter you always feel guilty rolling on anything because there's always someone in the party who need it more.
---
Picking a female character, never thinking about which gender people though I were, ending up with everybody I had gotten to know thinking I was female which in the end made me switch servers instead of telling them that they were all wrong, thus never  forming any long-lasting friendships online.
---
I mean, I did meet my (now ex-) wife on one of the new servers I started on, but still.
---
Ctrl/shift + mousewheel for zooming. It's annoying in the beginning, but you quickly get used to it.
---
Does anyone here know how to follow a chain of comments or do yall really just ignore context and project your own meanings?
---
Legit the truth. So many good options. The game has been out for over 15 years and most of us have played all the classes at length and probably enjoy all of them, this is my dilemna. 2 weeks off to get a good start, but with bloody what hahaha xD
---
&gt; Okay
---
You know women actually exist in real life right? They're out there living their lives just like us.
---
&gt;even my females around me
---
What the fuck? Lmao
---
Are you CPU shaming me? where are the mods?
---
I don't know anyone of whom that was true. :o
---
The data doesn't support it and I've explained why. You aren't listening.
---
You did make your own claims you said he was wrong and that's "not how it works"
---
The data would need every plot point in at least one bracket as well as the honor values for those players in order to be able to support your claim.
---
Nah, we were all idiots back in vanilla and nobody knew what they were doing /s.
---
Since there have never been any servers in my native language  I was forced to play on English one. That year of levelling to 60, having to read and translate quest texts and communicate with people was more effective in teaching me the language than 9 years of school before that. 
---
Now that language skill is one of the main reasons I have a well paid job (for the country I live in) with decent career prospects. 
---
Not to mention the thousands of hours of written, video and gaming content I was able to consume that would otherwise be locked out for me.
---
Always roll a server in a different language.
---
What makes you think Activision is any better lol. Honestly every big company is gonna keep dragging Blizzard to shit.
---
Dude, just stop. It‚Äôs the worst class in the game in every respect. They can barely out tank a shaman, they can barely out dps a hunter and you‚Äôre gonna spend your entire life at 60 pressing one spell til your eyes bleed. The highlight of your raiding life will be getting  to press innervate to let someone else dunk on your hps/dps. 
---
The only thing druids excel at is being the games premiere pariah.  
---
So many threads yesterday were all about druids being awesome. That was fine, we had Druid day. Now let‚Äôs nip this in the bud and move on or else gearing ourselves up is gonna get rough with all the new competition.
---
You are so scientifically illiterate that it actually hurts. Please stop. Read a book, and learn how proof and evidence works.
---
I can forgive it. Got a good chuckle
---
Skarm main tanked kt on his druid.
---
Okay, this made me laugh.
---
Skarm main tanked kt as druid.
---
I will be leveling my priest like that too.
---
Mind Blast+SW:P + Mindflay (after level 36, its not worth until level 36) + at 35% of mob HP wand to death (5sec rule) ---- spirit tap ------ full mana.
---
Repeat.
---
60 lvl gz.
---
I told you exactly how it works and why. If you want to ignore that and attempt an ad hom instead of addressing it, that's fine by me. I know I've met what I'm supposed to.
---
Im down queens ny here
---
Thanks for the info! Do you know what the cadence is for releasing kunark/velious?
---
I picked the sword because I just like swords better (and didn't know any better)
---
Personally I dont think Raider.io atm is bad or worse. My opinion though. 
---
However, I do think the classic community will come out with something similar to be able to tell if theyre bringing someone good or bad. Grouping in classic however is far more different than grouping in retail.
---
Main reason why the "propaganda" exists : we want players to UNDERSTAND what a pain in the ass is to get a tanking spot, as a Druid, in a Classic raiding guild.
---
We don't want to STOP people rolling Druids for tanking...just make them understand that the vast majority of them will NOT get a tank spot in a raiding guild.
---
YOU WANNA JOIN MY GUILD?!
---
Wanding will be your most used ability til you get mind flay rank 3 at (I think?) lvl 38.
---
I remember the days of having the video freeze while the audio continued to work. The party i was in would tell me what my toon did while my computer was locked up. The worst was during dungeon runs. When my lagged out toon would aggro the room on everyone.
---
Retail players think its a passive boost, lul
---
Why would you bring suboptimal shit? It‚Äôs just stupid.
---
Now I am depressed
---
Everyone already knows this.
---
Yeah...in BC.
---
In Vanilla, Warriors are the best AoE tank. And single target tank. Which pretty much covers the entire tanking.
---
Luckily people have gotten better and smarter over the years. Feral is a great specc, especially for tanking. 
---
Moonkins though? Ehhh
---
Hey,
---
Can you run diremaul as a drood?
---
More than lasher farm, I mean.
---
Preach, brutha!
---
Playing shaman to 60 as my first character.
---
Should have played warrior from the start.
---
Preach it sister!
---
Something that is easy to slow cook or pressure cook. Stews, soups, roasts with veggies are my preferred foods now. During vanilla I probably ate whatever was in my parents pantry, swiss cake rolls, oatmeal creme pies.
---
Oh that sucks! All that rep grinding gone forever...
---
Also provides an Innervate and a CR.
---
If we're gonna commit fully to the alt-spec idea then the Innervate actually makes one oomkin or even Elem Shaman viable because they suddenly have 40% more mana during a fight, which will get them through.
---
The CR in turn allows a DPS to suicide off the threat table and go all out. Do this somewhere around 75% remaining and you'll have a good time.   
---
The CR strategy heavily relies on good raid members (no deaths) of course.
---
I personally intend on making a hybrid-spec that is mostly suited to PvE-Healing but takes a few points out of things I'd otherwise have in favor of being better at PvP.
---
For example improved Manaburn at the cost of 2 points in Mental agility and Searing Light at the cost of Improved Renew.
---
whilst im not entirely sure what you mean by "early world pvp"
---
my general advice for pvp as a rogue
---
for professions go gnomish build the BoP shit, then go goblin, the other profession dont really matter 
---
for spec https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fhg0RxdZhZxMe0cGRo
---
race wise gnomes or dwarves are good for pvp on the alliance
---
dwarves are arguably better for beginners, gnomes are arguably better in better hands
---
when your actually fighting people, you need to learn when to use your cooldowns and when to save them, general rule of thumb in battle grounds is to save them for big fights, such as the flag carrier, or capturing/defending a base, and in wpvp save your cooldowns to answer someone elses use of cooldowns, or to provide you with more control when fighting more than 1 person
---
My pserver is so hilarious about the disconnecting. Half the time we all just scream REEEEEE in chat until it‚Äôs over, or it doesn‚Äôt even DC us and tons of people log off because they think the server is getting pulled.
---
Because we are playing this game for fun? 
---
Do you think all those players want a 15 year old game back because they care about server firsts? The whole game is doable with almost every spec, if you don't bring 20 of the weaker specs to a raid.
---
I'd rather do a raid with a boomkin, a ret, a feral and a spriest than with elitist jerks who think **anyone** cares that they beat MC in under an hour.
---
Oh god
---
Considering how many things wrong with oruvate servers we've found out just from a 1-40 beta there certainly exist a myriad of even more errors. I wouldn't trust them as far as I could throw them. If they get basic shit like boss parry wrong who knows what else they've managed to fuck up.
---
&gt; Druid pre-raid bis is very strong compared to prot warrior  
---
Irrelevant.
---
Unless you are removing the skills and talents from the Warrior. A Warrior with pre-BiS is still superior to a Druid...because they have Shield Block, Last Stand, Shield Wall, high Defense, much higher avoidance (innate Block, Parry, Dodge and being Miss).
---
You are comparing what you think is relevant...problem is that it is not.
---

---
Dad, is that you?
---
Haha ye tanking is fine anyways. Only Kittens have difficulties. I was memeing though
---
No lock? They're relatively similar to spriests... Kinda
---
Oh Jezus man... That's epic!!
---
I sold one of my characters on a nono-server - one of the two that split from the big one, then got the hankering to play again because of vanilla hype and remembering that I had a mid-20‚Äôies druid on one. 
---
Anyway, I message them to get 2-factor-authentication removed, restored my password and find my old warlock, previously level ~53 when I sold him at level 60 with 7k gold. Was a little surprised to say the least.
---
Gotcha, then I saw yours! Just wanted to make sure nobody shows off others content as their own. :)
---
I play PC all day every day, but high warlord is still unattainable. You'd literally have to break ToS to obtain it, or reduce your sleep, and you can't tell me that that isn't bad. Only way to bypass the ToS is to raise a child, having one child play on your account is allowed.
---
That being said, you're right, its just that the person you're responding to is also right
---
Pallies are okay-ish tnak while leveling (11 points in Holy for Consecrate make a big difference) and pretty good 5man tanks at endgame, especially in Scholo/Strat.
---
Damn so you would just used to keep playing as a kid while your hands went numb?
---
I played lock tbc to late wotlk and honestly don't want to return.
---
Play whatever **you** want. Your friends may betray you. I already see this "sorry for me quitting after level 30, this new job/relationships are just too important for me".
---
Books are for nerds
---
Yeah since you get two PvP pieces at the same rank, you can get the (2) set bonus immediately. But thanks for the input. I think I'm going to aim for both devilsaur pieces.
---
Pretty sure there will be 1 or 2 Druids in rank 12-13 gear and MCP on a servers.
---
Every single other Druid won't tank.
---
You are using EXTREME examples as a rule.
---
Doesn't work that way.
---
Play what **you** want. Your friends may betray you. I already see this "sorry for me quitting after level 30, this new job/relationships are just too important for me".
---
Play whatever \*\*you\*\* want. Your friends may betray you. I already see this "sorry for me quitting after level 30, this new job/relationships are just too important for me".
---
Like I told other people: I didn't play on your specific server and cannot tell you are lying or misremembering but I'm asking you the same question as other: 
---
* What do you mean by 'continued'? that there was daily SS-TM battle for 2 years or that once every month there was a battle?
---
* Who was participating in these big battles after 1.5 where everybody caring about honor was in BG and too afraid of getting DK? 
---
* Can you find forum posts backing your claim? I mean ok they are just forum posts or blog  (because you can't find anything else) but yesterday I browsed many on the subject and almost everyone remember it as I do that 1.5 killed most of world PvP and SS-TM in particular. Isn't that strange? 
---
* Why would people (especially horde) would hang out in TM once world PvP has largely diminshed? it wasn't even a big quest hub and it was far from everything. Going to Blackrock mountains or STV was a way better place to find random PvP
---
* How old were you back in the days? because I feel that most of the people around here barely played vanilla and were so young that their memory is kinda fuzzy
---
Not like this.
---
Not like this...
---
nngh... studd.
---
Play whatever you want. Your friends may betray you. I already see this "sorry for me quitting after level 30, this new job/relationships are just too important for me".
---
Nah he said "the guildies", I don't see why focus overall would mean Rets.
---
If it fails he can say 'I said it!'
---
Well your half way there
---
Yeah, it was perfect for leveling Warriors/Shamans/Paladins.
---
Got myself one before I leveld my BE pally when BC came out.
---
Only lasts thirty minutes
---
We wanted vanilla.
---
We're getting vanilla.
---
They're not going to suddenly overhaul a major part of the experience just because a select few people are outraged at the notion that there are things you have to nolife for.
---
Anyone committing to a r14 grind is responsible for their own health, just like the countless other people that are going to be playing 12+ hours a day for months.
---
Do I think it's a good system? Fuck no, but it's completely optional and offers a way to truly set yourself apart from other players.
---
What‚Äôs the best (horde) class for supporting premade BGs? 
---
I‚Äôm thinking a healer is probably the go-to, but which healer is best at supporting their team in PvP?
---
Yes Blizzard makes money of the services, but having to spend 150-200 hours just leveling a character to play with someone on a different server just suck.
---
Depends which faction
---
Since you play the game and its built on game mechanics and not lore the race with the best mechanics should be the best rogue race correct?  
---
And the "point" of a rogue is not only stealth since druids as have stealth too and the main point of a druid isnt stealth is it?
---
https://youtu.be/klm2Q7xu_d4
---
The definitive Resto druid PvP from vanilla days. You are doing yourself a disservice if you don't view this masterpiece.
---
this is wrong on so many levels
---
rogues arent just stealthers, especially in raids where its rare you should ever need to stealth, and in pvp, dagger specs skip MoD whilst hemo rogues can grab either depending on what they want
---
the best rogue race is orc, (NOT dwarf) their racial blood fury grants nice burst in pvp (especially helpful for stunlocks) and pve provides a nice damage boost (and thats ignoring the nice stun resist racial which can be invaluable for countering other stun locks, and escaping from danger)
---
PS: the best alliance rogue race is gnomes with escape artist
---
For hours, days and weeks. I ignored all the pain because I had so much fun, suddenly I couldn't open my hand because of the burning pain everytime I tried to "loosen" the clawgrip I had on the WSAD-keys. So I only used my left hand instead and kept on playing till both hands broke permanently. And I was 24 at the time, so I can't blame it in me being a kid not knowing better.
---
You won‚Äôt be excluded from raid. Some of the fights need a hunter. They‚Äôre very good at kiting and it‚Äôs fun to pvp with them. They have a pretty good tool kit. I‚Äôm not sure of which spec, I haven‚Äôt raided Vanilla. Currently leveling a marks hunter though on a private server.üòÖ
---
Warlock who used Lifetap, of course.
---
Should be mentioned, that people often delay switching to shadow until they can get both shadowform and the wand spec, because it's just so good.
---
My point was that the druid takes roughly the same damage per hit as a prot warrior in pre-raid gear, even accounting for defense, block, parry, etc. So the warrior's advantage then is in cooldowns and shield block, but at the same time their threat will be much worse than a druid so on any fight where you don't 100% need shield wall to survive a druid will be better at this gear level.
---
Alternatively punch its mother in the stomach. If the baby tries to fight back despite your level advantage it's ready for Stranglethorn Vale.
---
Classic PvP is so situational and chaotic and people out here min/maxing like it's going to be hardcore 2v2 Arena battles. These things matter in Classic WoW BGs for like the 5% of the time you are going up 1/1 or fully coordinated BGs. 
---
90% of PvP success comes from class knowledge and character positioning/movement. Good players take out higher level higher geared shit players all of the time.
---
If it weren't for world buffs falling off on death, the suicide CR idea would be pretty cool. But I don't think that an unbuffed dps for the remaining 75% of the fight that gets to go ham from the beginning would be better than a fully buffed dps for 100% of the fight staying just shy of pulling threat.
---
I started working on this project earlier this year.  It hasn't been consistent effort, but I've maybe put in a total of like 300-400hrs since I don't have a ton of experience with C# and it's required a bit of programming to far.
---
&gt; Most people who want to play there want to escape the hardcore rush to sixty my name is xXxShadowdeathxXx players and take the game slowly.
---
You can do that on the RP-PvE server.
---
Many naxx weapons and shields had unique models that cannot be obtained,  even on the bmah.
---
Gl with your problem, hope you would fix it.
---
Something wrong?
---
Golden rule is this: don't look too much up. Learn during playing. 
---
So many of us who played around 13 years old wish we could go back and have that moment of wonder and amazement. Just enjoy that feeling and journey. Don't read about all of the theory crafting and best specs until you're level 60. Just go explore the world, get lost, learn by failing, etc.
---
Which world buffs?
---
Most raids do not time Onyxia hand-ins etc.
---
As for the other buffs, yes those would have to be reapplied, but for a warrior there aren't all that many buffs.
---
Arena is fine as an isolated PvP mode.
---
The problem is that it became the main way to PvP for rewards, and was one of the reasons that WoW PvP turned from big MMO fights into small, hyper-coordinated skirmishes.
---
It also forced Blizzard to balance and homogenize the classes FOR arena, as vanilla's rock-paper-scissors approach and certain class strengths would be incompatible with it.
---
Ok, I knew a lot of people who did
---
Which matters why exactly? Why would anyone in their right mind twink during phase 1? The longer it takes you to get to lvl60 the more likely you are of being corpse camped by bored lvl60 players.
---
Rotisserie chickens are a lifesaver, and I know some places (like Costco) have them for like five bucks a pop, which is almost nothing. As soon as I get 'em I take the meat off the bones and dump the broth/juices into the container to keep the chicken moist. Then you can use that chicken for any number of things. We even used it for some buffalo dip once, and it made a big difference over the usual canned chicken.
---
Aren't warlocks in a raid just for summons and curse resistances?
---
Tardigrades are the gaming professionals of the future man!
---
thats it, im breaking my leg
---
TL:DR;
---
Gathering professions while levelling to 60. Crafting professions to create green items. Disenchant green items.
---
A truly unique and original approach.
---
I don't agree at all with the guy you're replying to, but what are you even saying
---
&gt;If you do well, we'll punish you so bad players can win against you
---
HMMMMMMMMMM
---
what a waste, idk what you are so worried about, even if you double those hours you will be fine.
---
Warlocks do great dps when geared.
---
Is Combat Swords not good on bosses? I thought Rogues top the meters the first few phases?
---
I'll be that's asshole, I want to feel your angry reaction.
---
Spotted a protest warrior scared he will do worse than a 'subpar' class
---
When levelling I wrote down every name of the guys that ganked me so I could take my Revenge at max lvl
---
Remember you can get yourself a reputation on your server so try not to make it a bad one. Unlike retail there is no cross server so the people you see each day you will see time and time again.
---
I think you mean Guild Bard!
---
I'm assuming being a dad, you have less free time.
---
I suggest a paladin. You will level faster than a warrior, you will be able to tank some dungeons, become a monster healer and have the opportunity to play around with meme dps specs such as Ret or the other one i forgot the name of. You also get a free mount so less time spent grinding for you.
---
However, if you don't want to be a healer for most of your raids (easier to be a non healer in dungeons or casual guilds), then I suggest sticking to warrior OR
---
Play a druid. You are single handedly the best off tank due to your threat and serious armor. You level up extremely fast due to bear/cat form. You can create an offtank spec that is both DPS and Tank, you have the ability to heal if needed, and you can get movement speed increases in cat form to make up for lack of farming gold for mount
---
One thing to consider is that with your friend group there is no plate wearer. You'd have dibs on that gear rather than competing.
---
Ha! We had that happen once. One of our guildies used that argument until we got fed up with it and the entire raid gave him about 10g pp to finish his missing 250g. 
---
"There you go, now you can buy your epic mount. And no, you can't roll for this one anymore".
---
Even worse. AV is boring but too OP to pass on and it makes solo palyers able to compete in honor farming.
---
I deeply appreciate that you took time off from your busy schedule to reply, see you in Azeroth!
---
It's about the general server mentality. People who go on RpPvP servers have a different mentality towards the game. PvP is going to be more hardcore in general. RpPvP will be more about taking your time, enjoying the game and of course role play. It's simply a different mindset.
---
That is why there are different server types. Each server type attracts a different kind of player. RpPvP and PvP communities are quite different. RpPvE is also quite different from RpPvP in it's player mentality. RpPvE is also shit because it takes out one of the most important parts of the game: Non consensual open world PvP.
---
Skeptical if this would actually work. Iirc, disenchanting will cycle skill ups for low level items just like as if you were making them, no? Like DEing a level 8 green will be yellow for an almost guaranteed skill up, then green for less of a chance, then gray for no skill up no? Or does that not apply to DEing at all?
---
Also hybrid resto/ele shaman
---
High burst, AOE heal, totems, wolf form, decently tanky due to mail and shield

I've used this system almost exclusively since WotLK.
---
Get the transparency of a point based system without the colluding aspect.
---
People who want an item will typically get it if they deserve it.
---
The /roll aspect is 'fun' in the rare situations when an item is going to be determined by a bonus roll.  
---
Also protects the guild leadership from any perceived unfairness when appointing loot to raiders.
---
To be fair, I also wouldn't willingly join a guild whose sole purpose is to carry a ret paladin to "prove" that ret is viable raid dps.
---
Thanks. I updated the post to emphasize the point. I did state that you should identify necessary tasks *before* naming positions, in order to avoid creating useless jobs.
---
He not that kind of orc ...
---
Oh no sorry I didn't mean that. I was sword spec and topped my damage meters in MC (even on bosses) - but I get feeling from this sub that the level of skill and min/max involved might find people like me out to be frauds.
---
Different time and all that.
---
I'm a warlock main, but I will have a holy priest alt.  I'm only going with the usual heal output spec only because I will have friends I'm leveling with on that character whereas my lock I'm solo'ing like you mentioned. As you can see in the link below there is quite the deviance between the two specs due to deep disc working well for PvP but in PvE you'd pull aggro.

Good lookin' out!
---
In vanilla/classic feral weapons are a stat stick, the dps does not matter. Enter MCP manual crowd pummeler. This is a weapon that has an on use +50% attack speed buff, 3 charges. Since you don't care about the dps you can use this low level weapon for the buff. Since it only has 3 charges, you need to farm a bunch of them.
---
Oh, wipe mentality
---
&gt; booked 2 days off 
---
Filthy casul!
---
In seriousness though, I envy you, man...
---
Doesn't it fall off after you get like 25-30% crit. Like you benefit more from aw ap then from crit after that point. I have to do some proper calculations on it but it has to do with stats weight
---
Let them roll Ele shaman! I'm going to enjoy watching them go OOM before doing enough damage to kill anyone without t2.5, and having absolutely no defenses to fall back on when lightningbolt/chainlightning/frostshock combo only gets their target ti half health.
---
It does not fortunately. Disenchanting an item, no matter the rarity or level, will always be a skill up.
---
The only thing that will differ is the disenchanting mats you are given will be lower level/lower quality
---
The Undead are being hunted down because they capture, murder, lobotomize and test chemical weapons on human civilians.
---
Sylvanas' first action after defeating the Scourge remnants in Lordaeron was betraying and slaughtering the human forces that, get this, actually helped her retake the city.
---
But because Sylvanas sent some ambassadors to Stormwind after she betrayed her human allies and murdered every single one of them, she's the good guy? Oh, and the ambassadors never even made it to Stormwind. They probably got killed by any of the following: Angry peasants, angry trolls, angry ogres, angry gnolls, angry Alterac humans, angry dwarfs etc.
---
So, yeah, when you view the story thorugh that lens, which is caked in dirt and missing one half, Sylvanas' actions are understandable. But, if you know the whole story, you see that she is nothing but a batshit-crazy psychopath and the Alliance is right in condemning the Undead.
---
Pay it forward.
---
I'm totally rolling Warlock as my main. Priest is a contender with paladin as my alt. I'm still undecided.
---
You explain how to get shadow gear for pvp while raiding as holy but imagine if I wanted to go pvp one hour and then do a raid and then go pvp, there's no way I can do both right? I would have to respec everytime

Such a thing didn't exist in original vanilla wow, why would it exist in wow classic? Maybe you should have some more realistic expectations...this isn't a new game in development.

I don‚Äôt know why you made this about me, I‚Äôve never played a pvp server. However I fully understand that playing on a pvp server means you‚Äôre a target any time you log in. Some people like that feeling of vulnerability and conversely the ability to attack other players. You whining because you played a pvp server and get attacked is just that, whining. If you want to keep up you‚Äôll have to plan and coordinate better.
---
Use invis. pots, decoy buffs, have a warlock summon to keep you out of danger. It‚Äôs seriously sad to see someone roll a pvp server and then cry when pvp happens.
---
Think people are strongly overestimating how hard the grind will be. You're more than welcome to do your 12-14 hours a day and grind it out, but you could just as easily casually rank to 10 and start the grind from there. I think a lot of it is situational based on what server you're on. Earlier private servers had bracket 1 rankers capping out around 500k honor a week, which is extremely reasonable all things considered. It wasn't until Nostalrius and beyond that they started pushing the honor cap to 2 MILLION honor, which required these people to play 16 hours a day, per week.
---
Based Warlock poster. Love seeing my Warlock brethren. For the Shadow!
---
it all depends on the way you like to play tbh
---
The problem everyone already paid the 60 dollars for BFA, and we pay 15 a month as a sub fee. They then take that money and spend development effort on making super cool mounts for the shop rather than making them in game rewards. 
---
If there was no sub fee I don't think people would be upset about shop mounts at all, but it's obnoxious to pay continuously for the game and see them spend way more development effort on store mounts than mounts that are actually in game rewards.

Being raid leader of a mediocre guild and leaving them for an even worse guild.

The gnome racial of +5% intelligence is really nothing to worry about, if you somehow had 1000 int you'd only get 50 bonus.

Just go for what you think looks better, and humans also have the +10% reputation gain which is a very very nice quality of life. It will cut down days of grinding rep

For sure that‚Äôs why you can use the AQ mount.

Nope.

Selling my original account. I think I got $350 for it and bought some crappy video card. Kind of ruined my reputation on the server too.
---
Yes, i go over to germany just for german aldi stuff, it is lit.
---
Holy Paladin might make sense for the trio leveling then, and I can grab a frost mage or Druid for the duo leveling. Thanks!
---
In classic beta?
---
Let me just quote your original comment.
---
&gt;No stun in cat form to never be able to shred targets solo, and overall lackluster damage was just disappointing. You had to attrition targets down which was no fun.
---
Now tell me, where exactly did you mention anything about being in combat? You can start a fight with Pounce. I never said you could use it more than as an opener, but neither did you specify anything about having to keep doing it during combat. You just said it was never possible, which is false.
---
Cat form *does* have a stun and you *can* do a stun &gt; Shred combo. You literally said "never be able to shred targets solo", but you clearly can do it at the start of a fight.
---
Just accept that you are wrong.
---
So demonology best spec for pvp you say?
---
It's not harder on PvE servers, it's either easier or impossible.
---
If you have the required total number of people in the pool then it would be easier, simply by virtue of there being less competition (ofc if you compare a super populated PvE realm vs an almost dead PvP one it will be different, but in general PvE realms will have less PvP'ers).
---
If you dont have a sufficient number of people above 15hks, then it is not harder but simply impossible due to how the system is set up.
---
With some of the changes between private servers and classic I think cats will be less viable than they were, which was already a stretch. Anything a Bear can tank a Warrior can tank as well, and when you're a feral druid not tanking, you're not bringing nightfall uptime as well.
---
On the flip side there were quite a few high end guilds on private servers that used a moonkin, specifically Coalition on Anathema getting server first AQ40.
---
At the end of the day it doesn't matter, the game is simple enough to where a guild of 40 priests and 40 druids have progressed further than a lot of us did in actual classic 15 years ago.
---
hunter can share a PvE and PvP spec. MM and then survival. You just won‚Äôt have counter attack.
---
Shaman 30/0/21 is a fine pvp spec. It‚Äôs a weak healing spec in PvE but will work through BWL
---
Priests can do the same as shamans in shadow spec.
---
Warlock also has SM/Ruin
---
I corpse-jumped my first ever character from the world tree because I didn't know there was a teleportation device. I ended up reaching ruth'teran village by swimming and I felt like a fucking god explorer ! Til I saw someone arriving with the boat and teleporting up to teldrassil...

---
Because he was in the queue, the only valid reason next to the server being offline.
---
One thing about off specs that hasn't been brought up is the drama they can cause in guilds. Many people would prefer to play off specs but they heal because it's much more useful. So if some guy is allowed to play e.g. Shadow, it can cause real issues for the healers because given the chance they would prefer to be playing Shadow too. It gets even worse if the Shadow is getting gear because those healers are often only there to gear up their Shadow set for pvp.
---
My guild basically imploded during AQ progress because of this.
---
I remember I used to have this problem when I first started WoW in Cataclysm (I was a teenager).  I was F2P and used our family iMac.  Didn't have many performance issues except for the fact I tended to DC a lot in BGs.

You're just stating that DKP is better, without answering the question. Why can't 95% of guilds sustain LC? Why are 5% successful? What makes DKP "superior" for "the majority"?

Depends on what people mean by QoL, seen quite a few definitions, but I'll just accept your definition for the sake of ease.
---
Sure, they do add QoL like that, but I don't see the problem of that. Take raid frames, almost no one actually used them. Everyone had addons because quite frankly, they sucked. Now people can avoid using addons and the few that absolutely need those old school frames can get an addon that will undoubtedly be made. A different UI in settings doesn't matter, come on - how does that affect the game? And account integration, using their modern tech for security is great for everyone. Just don't use BattleTag if you don't want to, it won't affect you.
---
All I'm saying is, those changes are understandable. It is totally fine if you don't like them, but they hardly affect the actual game. They don't change things like lower gold for mount or something, those QoL are kind of outside the gameplay.
---
Warriors suck even with gear. You need to purchase a pocket healer.
---
Hah I guess. All in all I won't play more than 6h a week, which is nothing compared to the time put in back in the day so figured I'd call it casual

I got chronic tendinitis and arthritis from doing line work, but I have a similar story: was an adult, overdid it, didn't pay attention to the signs. My dad in particular would say things like, "Just work through it" and so I did, though it was obviously to the detriment of my physical health. Lost my job because I couldn't physically do anything anymore, physical therapy made it worse, and then I had muscle atrophy from having to rest it.
---
It's been years but I've learned how to cope and adapt; I still can't react quickly, a lot of common keybinds hurt too badly to try, and I'm super picky about how my desk is set up and everything because it doesn't take much to aggravate my issues again (and then I pay for it for weeks).
---
It's sad but people tend to not take these things seriously until it's too late. If you feel numbness or burning in your fingers, wrists, forearms, elbows, or the muscles in between, use ice, rest, and wrist braces (when you sleep is the perfect time if you curl your hands up) to help combat it. But rest is the key. Trust me, it's not worth struggling with mundane daily tasks to get some more Game Time in now.

No my good sir, only my lack of english probably. I thought the word 'flavoured' is only used to refer to somethings you taste with your tongue and it made your post especially funny.
---
&gt; I think more so than WHAT your guild runs, it's HOW the guild runs loot. If the leadership is transparent in their thoughts, reasoning, and decisions, listens and ilicits input from members often and early, and can demonstrate they take that input into consideration even if they go a different direction, a guild will handle loot well no matter the system. 
---
Take all of my upvotes
---
Frost pve and frost pvp are very, very different specs
---
One Resto Druid in raids, that's it. Only bring another druid if you don't have anyone else that's level 60 online. If they try to DPS or tank, just kick them and do the raid at 39 people.
---
So you‚Äôll he 60 in about a year

---
Expect everyone to assume you never know what you're doing and that you will wipe 5 mans with your inability/unwillingess to control your pet. Prove them wrong.
---
How about, no?
---
Druids have a res too, but you're not going to be resurrecting players after a wipe.  Just because they have 1 extremely niche way to stun a target (ignore cleary better options for openers in any practical scenario) you are techincally correct in that they have a skill which can stun an opponent.  However, using that stun for a reason you'd want to stun a target in either pve or pvp they are lacking unless you are conditionally A) A tauren in caster form, or B) shifting into bear form, or C) using a trinket or consumable which any other class has access to.
---
The Sky is red too... during a sunset. Do you want to argue about how people who claim the sky is blue are wrong?
---
I was 10 years old and playing a hunter in vanilla. I definitely had my fair share of growl and "didn't dismiss pet before jumping" moments. But even then I was more or less aware of the reputation that hunters had in regard to loot, so I was petrified to roll on any drops ever. I remember even up through TBC I would stress out so much every time an item dropped. I hardly ever rolled on anything unless it was literally hunter-specific or a ranged weapon.
---
You don't progress in MC with a tank that doesn't have Shield Block. That is a dead tank. Dead tanks don't do threat.
---
I hope you do understand that a Druid tank in pre-BiS gear will be crushed and critted 2 out of 3 hits by MC bosses? And no pre-BiS healers will be able to heal the damage? And if they somehow manage to heal him, they will run oom when the boss is at 60-70% HP left?
---
Strength recognizes strength.
---
The private server brigade has so much wrong it's mind boggling.
---
I haven't played vanilla wow since TBC either...  but my brain didn't dribble out everything i learned in the meantime. 
---
Aoe farming was a thing,  but not like Pserver pros think. there were specific limited ways it could work, and there were lots of other places it wouldn't work at all.
---
The whole fury prot nonsense.  Another thing that might be barely workable under certain specific conditions 99%   on Real servers fury prot takes significantly more damage, and deals significantly less when trying to tank. 
---
Your druid delusions are less wrong than those at least, but pserver druids have too much bonus attack power, meaning they will outperform warriors on threat by a smaller amount than you seem to think, if they do by any noticeable extent at all. , and they will still take way more damage, on top of not being able to pop consumables during combat.
---
Still real server Ferrals are stronger than most people remember, since most vague recollections were formed early on in vanilla, and They did get some love.  
---
So yes, smart raids will have one (possibly two if they're actively gearing up 8 or more total tanks) feral druid(s), because that is a smart way to streamline gearing up your tanking team.  
---
And they might even let the feral tank or OT as much as possible.  
---
But it won't be due to massive TPS.  
---
It will be because warriors outperform ferals as dps.
---
I'm experiencing slow internet lately myself. Feels authentic. Can't wait.

It's funny - people bash vanilla for supposedly being poorly balanced but the classes have their pro's and con's so well distributed that many people can't decide what to play. Certain classes are good at certain things instead of everything being 'sort of' equal in everything. To me that's great balance
---
Cottonelle Blue.... Always.
---
&gt; Like, [u/NovercaIis](https://www.reddit.com/u/NovercaIis/) do you really think a random player will speak up against the GM and the 2nd in command? 
---
I think that this depends on the culture that you have created. If you encourage feedback and welcome criticism, then yes. If you punish people for stepping out of line and they think that it will hurt them personally, then no.
---
Its not a weekend.
---
Off topic, but has anyone considered a traveling loot council? That is a separate 5 members of the raid become ineligible for loot drops for that week or raid night and then vote/select who in the guild gets what loot. If a member is selected they can waive their right to be on the council that week and another is randomly drawn.
---
Maybe this ends up more prone to corruption/favoritism but was just a thought I had.
---
I AM THE LAW!
---
Best solo levelers in the game.
---
Good pvp
---
Worst population to raid desirability ratio in the game. I.e hunter is like the 4th most popular class and is the least desired class in raid.
---
Some say druid but resto druids are desired and druids are the least populated class in the game so the rstio is better.
---
Unless you intend on joining a hardcore guild it wont matter
---
Most guilds are gonna struggle to get 40 people raiding so you should be ok
---
Would raiding as Spirest pvp spec  [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/5002321--0502525103511251](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/5002321--0502525103511251)  be viable?
---
Druid/Rogue
---
Yeah, that's pretty much impossible.
---
Even if you have two lvl 60 Priests, you need to do EVERYTHING twice, farm reputation, farm keys, do all the pre-quests, professions and everything. In terms of hours played we were pretty fucking hardcore back in the day, and I only ever knew one person who did this and I don't think the character ever really got off the ground after hitting 60

Struggling between shaman, priest and warlock. Looking for a strong and fun class to pvp with (wpvp, 1 vs x).

Will be raiding, so gear and gold for respecs should be manageable. 
---
Shadow priest falls off a bit after BWL. Warlock gets stronger with gear. Elle shammy is something I have never played and looks damn fun. 
---
Need help...
---
Well if you have a nice culture and members trust and value the leadership, then you don't even NEED to pull 3 random people into the Council. You're pulling 3 random people into the council, because you're worried about corruption and general lack of trust. But if the 3 people you pull in don't trust you, then they won't speak up.
---
It's a catch 22 tbh.
---
I hope you do understand being at the armor cap + having several k more HP than a warrior means that even multiple crits don't kill a druid? And every pre-bis healer can heal the damage without running oom?
---
I don't know what grossly overtuned private server you're basing your experiences from, but in the real world survival is not a problem on progression even on popular private servers where several bosses have been shown to do more base damage than in vanilla.
---
Yeah, PvP ranks will be in phase 2. I am going to be playing quite a bit more than many of my guildies, so I'm trying to figure out what I should be doing while they're still levelling. I don't think we're going to be raiding in the first couple of months, so I'm looking into PvP ranks, dungeon BiS gear and other interesting farms. 
---
But thanks for the input. As people have stated, the crit should be better thanks to the talent that gives hunter crits 30% more damage.
---
STV. level 39ish. They had zero armor. Ground my first character to 40 there
---
As a former raid leader and guild leader for several guilds (none which I created but was entrusted by everyone to take on the leadership role) I think its management issues. There have been extremely few times a raid member has ever questioned me and I have had 25-30 people on my rooster without ever having recruited most of them (being appointed raid leader from member/officer spots). That being said I think a loot council needs rules to. What I usually do is measure a couple of things listed below;
---
1. Raid attendance, no attendance = no loot
---
2. Number of upgrades in current raid tier (easier in retail), should be measured in time in classic.
---
3. How big off an upgrade the actual item is for the people in consideration.
---
It takes considerable knowledge and time to do it all alone but it can be done. Its better if you can get everyone involved in helping out, by having 1 person keep track of loot recieved, another taking attendance etc. Last time I played WoW was in Legion, Nighthold and did all of the above and came up with raid boss strategies for mythic and several other chores forcing me to spend about 4 hours just managing the guild every day but if it had been split among our 30 members it would have been about 8 minutes for each person everyday.
---
Shhh, you fewl. 
---
Now we will have to face an army of immobile already stealth rogues as Horde. What have you done!

Queues aren't coming back though...  because people would prefer faux-sharding vs not getting instant gratification.

---
those wowhead guides are misleading, the talent builds are stupidly wrong. i don't know who the fuck is behind them, but they are shit.
---
You can pvp as healer, that's no problem. Healers are welcome everywhere. There are a few talent differences between pvp and pve specc but thats no big deal. You can just pve in pvp specc or pvp in a pve specc. As soon as mc / bwl is on farm status you dont need the most efficient pve specc to raid

---
Hour before work ends, I'd text my brother to boot up my laptop and login to my WoW on it, so that when I came home, it would be (almost) done with the queue
---
Not really. A dps warrior would definitely use some mail and leather gear if it has better stats for them. +ap on a few pieces of gear, even if leather or mail, is better than a plate piece with stam, even for leveling.
---
&gt; You just acknowledged that I am technically right
---
Yes, just like Shadow priests and fire mages have a stun, too then.
---
I actually really like the replay value for both solo and rogue one tbh
---
I'm going to do the same: Mage main with PvP/PvE balance and a hunter.
---
Following the exact same route posted above. Upvoted.
---
Good to hear, I've been doing my own testing outside of them which I suppose I'm glad I did now lol.
---
Not all of us are total neckbeards that can endlessly grind shit, like yourself.
---
Well I don't know how much time you will have for leveling and how often your friends will be on. But based on my experience, 2 characters will be by far enough. Even if you are 2-3 level ahead of the others, you will still be able to level with them. (You could level in different areas, that way you could still do the same quests)
---
I think the 3 character variation only works, if the 1 friend, or the duo are veeery rarely online.
---
I tried this on one of the stress tests and it took a little for me to get used to. I think it‚Äôs a good idea because it frees up some keys and doesn‚Äôt make you look like a filthy keyboard turner.
---
I have the same conflict. I always played on german pservers, but I feel like I'm going for an english server. Even if it is only to hear other jokes. 
---
Btw, do you know a site to translate WoW terms, like item names and spell descriptions? I'm used to the German terms.
---
It's not that you can't, it's just kinda useful to have another decurse and you can't use the dust in bear form (which depending on the macro situation in beta I hear we may be in a better situation there than vanilla).
---
Giving up ice barrier for PoM? Looks like a shit spec if you ask me
---
they shouldn't have a horse in the first place
---
I currently don't work for Blizzard but I still have connections and was in the Dev Guild for a long time before they stopped playing. As well as a beta invite, my friend told me he was going to hold onto a bunch of names and wanted me to send him a list too. After the game is live, we'll be making arrangements to release them and then I'll grab 'em. This is fairly common with the employees and family members of all other gaming companies too. #perks
---
Probably more than episode 7&amp;8 for sure..I have hope that maybe some of the extended universe can be interesting but I‚Äôm hestitant to fork over 20$ to go to the movies these days
---
Im aware of this. Still mostly edge cases like devilsaur a lot of warriors use. Ive leveled a number of hunters to 60 in pserver and not one time did a warrior/paly roll on mail or leather. Its super rare. But if you want to ackktually my use of monopoly go ahead
---
For what? Pvp, pve, leveling??
---
Easy there, bucko. 
---
So quest. It‚Äôs only marginally slower. I like to grind a level or two in vanilla. It‚Äôs good for your gold, and it lets the quests catch up.
---
They didn't even remove it until the Cataclysm prepatch.  If you were that close to exalted in Vanilla why the hell didn't you step in solo in Wrath and kill some stuff?
---
Stayed awake on the last privateserver launch for the first 96hours AMA lmao.
---
I too would like sources. I remember this RealRecollector guy getting downvoted into oblivion on an other Feral Druid topic on which he kept shittalking druids and guilds who‚Äôd take a Druid tank along with getting pretty insulting to people arguing with him, so I‚Äôd take all this post with a grain of salt.
---
There is no same region downtime if your battlegroups are large enough. I've never once in my years of playing retail had any issue finding BG's even at ridiculous times like 6 in the morning.
---
Private servers are still better because they tend to at least be majority US/EU populated which creates some downtime when US is sleeping and EU is waking up/at work. There's a few exceptions among there but this has been my general experience.
---
The only real hope here is that the battlegroups are small, as there will still be downtime if the groups are just 3-4 servers in size. But 15+ like the one I was in? No, you have no downtime whatsoever. There's enough people going for R13/14 alone to fill up several BG's among such a number of servers.
---
Mid/later Cata.
---
PvP mainly
---
Your tank should never be dying in MC unless your healers are afk or oom. Unless your druid is somehow wearing all cloth, the only real danger is Magdamar being enraged for an extended period of time.
---
Weird, you'd think people at a company with virgin in the name would understand the importance of connection uptime.
---
Not to mention in classic there are going to be many more retail players who will just automatically dismiss mail/leather as a plate class
---
I haven't thought about classic for like, 2 months (been playing other stuff to keep my atyention of it). I know I want to heal and coming back to thinking about it now, the choice seems slightly easier lol.
---
An alt lol? I'm just gonna throw all my time and energy into a main.
---
Regret not having the time to play more classes.  Now with classic, can accomplish so much more!
---
It's ok he probably buys his plane ticket at the airport. Since it's rediculous to buy it earlie
---
You don't just "grind out" R13, especially if you don't have a dedicated PvP pre-made to carry you through it.
---
My first thought also
---
My guild has 5 warlocks simply for their utility with curses and dps, the soulstones and lock rocks are just bonuses. Shadowbolt crits are big money.
---
This. 
---
I think you're one of the only responses that remembered it was a question about what you guys where gonna do, Not what I thought was best.
---
Well, its still possible Blizzard WILL fuck it up. I'm not believing Classic is going to really be authentic experience until I see layering completely removed with my own eyes.
---
Someone who actually knows the actual golden rule!
---
Was going to write the same thing but did a search first to check whether someone else has done so before.
---
Well, we wouldn't have anime without Disney, so that's a fair trade, right?
---
Actually better stealth detections helps you flare better, you can't just be guessing where to flare all the time
---
The hell..
---
In all seriousness, never skimp on toilet paper.  Cheap stuff is like wiping your ass with sand paper and you have to use half a roll since it's almost see through.
---
That's what everyone is saying though.
---
If you have an old mouse they're probably still going strong, but their new products are much lower quality.
---
With the +20 agi from the pvp set (and if you aren't struggling for +hit) they are better than devilsaur. T1 gloves are better again though, but who knows how long it'll take for full T1.
---
Yes but a warlock is still going to do great dps on their own been a long time for me but I was also under the impression that they outperformed mages in early content due to fire resistance.  Op says he doesn't like mages but seems to be concerned with endgame dps of a hunter im giving him a 3rd option that is almost as powerful a leveler as a hunter and remains a strong dps class throughout the game.
---
fun vid, missed the guy outside of wc that drops the blue axe tho.
---
I'm honestly getting tired of these types of posts.  Sure, everyone wishes that classes were more balanced so that they could play their favorite spec without getting insta-kicked from groups.  But that's not Classic.  To ask for these kinds of changes is to spit on what Classic is, and what Vanilla was.  If you seriously want these changes, then you don't want to play Classic; and you shouldn't.
---
Nope!
---
I spent more time playing my 60 ele shaman alt in AV or my 29 rogue twink.
---
If I had mained as a Shaman I feel like I woulda enjoyed my time more, as I just had more fun with the class overall.
---
McDonalds paper bags. Strong enough that you can use both sides.
---
&gt; Nothing is more horrifying than 15 paladins bubbling up, popping skull of impending doom and running into your raid and each drops a sapper charge.
---
How about [an entire raid popping Light of Elune](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymk80wcPsX0) doing it?
---
Blizzard already confirmed that paid realm transfer will be in Classic but we don't know the cooldown restriction. It could be the original 6 months or Retail's 3 days or anything in between.
---
Did anyone else ever try to leave early on raid nights by faking this type of DC?
---
I'd press num lock, run into a wall, type "LAG!" in raid, then either unplug the ethernet cable or close WoW.
---
Just got hit by a wave of nostalgia.
---
Hindsight is 20/20
---
My favorite was when MT would have to do something before pull and when they left their computer we would all ‚Äúfake a DC‚Äù, voice comms went quiet, chat would go quiet, and we would all do various DC things (run into a wall, run in a circle, spin in place, or stand still).
---
MT would sit back down... ‚ÄúGuys?‚Äù.......‚ÄùGuys???‚Äù......‚ÄùDamnit!‚Äù and would go offline restarting their router or something.
---
You are right you can get with skills (game wise skills where you press buttons) to rank 10 alone, but after that you need another set of skills: team work skills. You need communication, organization and structure, and you need to act in certain way if you want to be  part of it.
---
That's also "skills", even if they don't require to press buttons.
---
If you think warriors (and ret) won't want items like CoD then you have another thing coming.
---
Don't be afraid to ask for help.
---
Don't be afraid to help others.
---
Make friends.
---
Have a good time.
---
Well with my schedule thank god the end all be all for me would only be Rank 12.
---
The hardest part is, of course, finding those right people. Once Classic launches i'm sure it'll be easy to find people, but the RIGHT person to raid lead? If you're looking to lead a guild, jump on the recruitment train now. Finding a raid lead ahead of time is a massive boon, but also incredibly lucky. There's only so many RIGHT fish in the sea!
---
A simple no would have sufficed.
---
I don't understand why anyone ever deletes a character? Unless you desperately need space for a new one...then you delete the lowest level char. It just doesn't compute.
---
I wasn't even answering to you here so maybe relax? getting angry is bad for your health
---
Show me a kill pic of Kel thuzad then we can discuss.
---
They do solid dps which scales well later, and banishes make MC far easier, especially the Garr fight!
---
Um, feral tanks have no issues tanking almost every boss. To my knowledge, there are only about 3 bosses where they struggle. For almost all content, druid is just as good as a warrior for tanking. Druids are even preferred over warriors for a few raid encounters too. im not aware of that being true for pally. Paladins are significantly more gimped than druids by not having taunts or any o shit cool downs to snap aggro back. So if you want to tank, druid is easily more viable than a pally tank. Everyone knows this, soooo much has been covered on this that if you still think pally &gt; druid at tanking, your obviously burying your head in the sand and not reviewing the raw facts that clearly state that warrior &gt; druid &gt; pally for tanking.
---
\&gt; Neither class is particularly well suited for either of the other roles 
---
Also, you just stated that neither pally or druid is suited for either tank or heals. Pally heals is OP, Pally is very well suited for healing. Priest are versatile with a large arsenal of relevant spells, but pally rules the fast big heals and can easily out heal priests, especially in the early phases. Druids have the most mana efficient healing in game, so much so that they can heal an entire raid fight, not run out of mana, and in order for the priest to keep going, they need to steal the druids innervate because they have worse mana efficiency.  Just because priests have more buttons to press, doesnt automatically make them better. Sure they may be more interesting to play, rather than just spamming healing touch or flash heal, but pally can certainly hold its own against a priest.
---
"The use of potions is another advantage that Warriors have. Timing a shapeshift, to chug a pot, when main tanking is damn hard, and it's risky as fuck."
---
A nitpick, but Druids can use potions instantly with a macro.
---
/cancelform
---
/use Healing Potion
---
/cast !Dire Bear Form
---
Each action is on a separate cooldown, so the server processes them in sequence instantly. There isn't even an animation, just the poof of smoke and you'll lose your rage (which doesn't really matter while tanking with Furor).
---
Nah man, it's classic - it's supposed to be broken. Isn't it?
---
How do you zoom in/out then? I do that a lot to get better view at stuff, especially in dungeons.
---
Your ability to run the 1.12 client has absolutely no bearing on your ability to run Classic. If you cannot install, launch, login, and play Retail WoW with even minimal success, you will not be able to play Classic.

Disney made comic book characters cool for the mainstream, for the first time. I'm not a huge fan of the movies, with a few exceptions, but I credit them for bringing superheroes to the forefront of pop culture.
---
Realize there are two types of fun.

1. The "in the moment" exploring doing stuff as they pop up kind.

2. The "slow burn" meticulous planner schemer type who is always planning out the future.

Both are fun. Both are viable. People can have fun anyway they want.
---
My tip is, don't let anyone tell you that whatever you pick is the wrong way to have fun with the game.
---
BOOOOOO HIIISSSSS
---
I've been watching a ton of classic wow content and this might be my favorite video so far. Well done
---
It hurts because its true.
---
Lol. Downvoted. Lol
---
&gt;They don't scale well and struggle to out dps tanks in later content.
---
This is blown way out of proportion. No, you're not losing DPS races to tanks. Hunters don't really even lose out on scaling until late AQ, and you're not likely to see that content anyway.
---
You did the same shit to me. Trying to tell me that my memories are faulty. That's gaslighting. So yeah, fuck right off.
---
You can dream, you just can't raid
---
Quality content.
---

---

---
How do you use the 3 sea shells?
---
While I don't think its possible, I will be endlessly searching for a level 58 green shield "of nature's wrath".
---
Firstly, druid threat with MCP is significantly better than every warrior spec except dual wield fury/prot, and the fury/prot is required to have Thunderfury to get close.
---
Threat is more important than survivability - druids can survive 95% of bosses in the game on progression without problems, so it doesn't matter if they take 10% more damage as long as their threat is high. With the high HP and armor even multiple crits/crushings do not kill a druid.
---
Also you can use potions, healthstones and sappers safely "in form" in classic thanks to the instant shifting made possible by the classic macro system.
---
You're correct that druids are optimal in an off-tank position, but they should be main tanking the bosses where druids shine (Vael, Broodlord) and put into an MT position whenever your raid is heavily threat capped and you're not on one of the handful of bosses where shield wall/stance dancing is required.
---
Sad that this post is being downvoted, but I agree actually. Remember guys, we have THREE name reservations on August 13th. I know my first 2 but my third is giving me trouble. I'm thinking a warrior for the alt, it doesn't matter if I play it 700 years down the road, but it'll be nice for it to be there with a great name
---
sadly not so much, since the shaman can't dispel the warrior, thats also the reason resto shamans are rejected for premades. priest is much better with a warrior.
---
Really my biggest but only regret was just not playing enough. I wish I would have taken the time to do more dungeons, explore the game a little bit more or seek out more friends while leveling.
---
One thing I haven't seen discussed yet is gear competition.  A shaman, druid and hunter are all going to be competing for the same leather paces until 40, a Mage, warlock, and preist will all want the same gear, as well.  As an inhouse 5-man, this might not be a huge deal but it could still pose a few issues.  A warrior, at least,  can take any and all mail/plate that drops and put it to good use.
---
Nope. :)  Leveled a rogue to 60 and never looked back. But I mainly PvPed and did casual/MC raiding. Never got a sweet purple weapon, but I got the blue pvp set and a few pieces of nightslayer.

I don't have anything against them. I'm not gonna Min max. Warlocks are cool. Mages are everywhere.

But if he worries about hunters, there could be  a chance people not wanting then for minmax purpose.

As someone who plays hunter, I love this build that doesn‚Äôt have ice barrier. I recommend every mage use this.
---
To get that angry over a discussion where I was polite and gave you arguments and link to back up my claim is kinda strange...

I mean if you played vanilla, aren't you older than 30? shouldn't you be more relax about gaming internet discussion?

I was a night elf  druid moonkin spec who was running cat form mostly in  level30 bgs stacking agility because i thought it made me run flags faster
---
Putting a druid as tank 3 to absorb gear and allow an extra warrior to go DPS is an easy decision and there will be plenty of raids with druids in this position in classic.

It's when it comes to main tanking that the debates start.

Warriors and hunters are barely in conflict on leather/mail pieces barring a few fringe cases like Truestrike and Savage Gladiator Chain. Hunters don't roll on STR gear and warriors rarely roll on AGI gear.
---
Woah don't lump me in with the Reddit masses. I have poor internet, so leeway is something i've grown intimate with in Retail, it's the only way I can play as a melee. I'm all for leeway, it's fantastic. Look, if you think you can get Rank 14 with under 12 hours of played time every day then fine, maybe if you have a premade and all that jazz. All I was stating is that YOU ARE RIGHT, but SO WAS THE GUY YOU RESPONDED TO. I don't care if its doable or not, it is UNHEALTHY. If people choose to do it, thats on them, I agree with your McDonalds analogy.

Do not lump me in with the rest of Reddit, I HATE all the complaining that goes on here and in r/wow and the fact it has been going on for so many years. I loved Legion, i'm having fun in BFA, i'm super excited about Classic and don't hate anything in it (well okay, the 1-5 experience on the stress test wasn't fun, but thats just launch so who cares).

Yep like in a duel. In world pvp, the stealthy one will win.
---
The initial assertion is ‚Äúnight elf is the best race for rogue‚Äù. Not alliance rogue, not in pve, pvp, world pvp.
---
The best race. Which is absolutely wrong on all levels as:
---
The are not optimal for pve
---
The racial is weaker than the human one in duel or world pvp.
---
If you want to roll a night elf, do it. But don‚Äôt try to justify the choice.

Then remember destroying warriors in PvP and making locks your CoE bitch in raids

That video has some good points. And the thread also has some great input. 
---
I personally am torn between a few classes, druid one of them. It sounds to me like druid is your best bet. Super versatile, great wpvp potential. You just can't expect any significant burst damage, which for many is the main drawback to playing one. Also check out Stormx and Ebbnflow on youtube, they've got some great druid content.

Fortunately real wages have gone up over the past 50 years both in terms of median and average pay.
---
See Schiller's data for [US Real Income Per Capita](https://www.multpl.com/us-real-income-per-capita). Remember, "real" means inflation-adjusted.
---
Additionally, the price of many critical items has decreased over time. According to HumanProgress,  [basic food items in America have become almost eight times cheaper relative to unskilled labor over the last 100 years](https://humanprogress.org/article?p=1798). 
---
Perhaps most staggering is the growth in [Real Global GDP Per Capita over the past two millenia](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/world-gdp-over-the-last-two-millennia). The past 200 years has seen exponentially more progress than the entire history of humanity.

Don't get me wrong, capitalism has its ills: pollution, contribution to global warming, corruption, greed, etc. But it has also lifted billions out of poverty and raised our collective standard of living vastly higher than that of any other humans in history.

Yes they are, gw2 had a large RP community when i played probably back in 2014-2015 and ffxiv has a huge rp community currently.

---
Also what I think people fail to realize is 'scaling' means tier 2.5 &gt; tier 3 is not as huge a bump as most others get. 
---
Often getting 40 consistent compitent  people together is the biggest deal. Tranq shot utility and being dependable is all you need for every guild besides the 1% world first types.

To be fair it's harder to see sarcasm in text form. That said people are getting real heated.

Dont think so. Ele doesnt really turn on until level 40+. Also it would mean significantly more drinking.  If i can be efficient with my mana playing enhancement, then topping off my brother after lifetaps would keep us moving like a well oiled machine
---
I don't know where you're getting that I'm angry from. I just know you're wrong, as do many of the other respondents here, and your argument against them all is "no, you don't remember that" and gaslighting is a really shitty thing to do to anyone.

Out of curiosity, what is a "sub rogue"?

Anyone staying up for days on anything has a huge crash. I've found it has less of a crash than say mdma if you don't redone and stay up all night
---
Early on yes, later on, no. They scale the hardest out of any class in terms of how well they do in meters. They perform poorly on the meters in early raids, but later raids give them tons of gear with great itemization. They go from bottom of the meters in MC to potential chart topper in Naxx. Pretty much the complete opposite of hunters, who do well in MC but fall off hard in Naxx.
---
I use the 12 button insert just because I play retail in a CE guild and I need to maximize my ability usage/efficiency. 7 is more than enough for almost any other game, and even retail WoW if you‚Äôre in a casual guild

RP servers don‚Äôt have sharding in retail. I imagine they‚Äôll have layering in Classic. Sharding is a bad thing to have in RP servers, hence why they don‚Äôt. Layering is a different, temporary, beast. I sincerely doubt streamers will pick RP servers. RP servers have rules that will cause streamers to feel they‚Äôre walking in a minefield.
---
If streamers pick RP servers, trust me, they will have a bad time. The RP community was not fond of project 60 swarming the servers. Harassing and interrupting RP is considered an offense in these servers. As is having names that don‚Äôt fit RP - so sodapoppin, tipsout, staysafe and others will be reportable. This also includes people that follow streamers into these servers. RP servers are also a lot less competitive, which I sincerely doubt is what they‚Äôre looking for.
---
I don't have a huge desire to get a feel for the market on a separate economy like that but it would probably be a better time investment than spam-farming with a level 110.  I've always liked farming but I will ofc want to focus the vast majority of time on a Classic character, and retail is more like a passing curiosity since I've been out since WOTLK.
---
I think most loot council systems can be setup to be open. To either show who votes for who, or just how many votes each person gets. This can help reduce problems with transparency and make people better understand why another person gets the item.
---
another thing I'm excited about, having that one person you just hate for existing and see them constantly.
---
Nah, you'll be back here, complaining about no one taking you into groups because you're a fucking ret paladin. It's not elitist to be realistic. Play whatever the fuck you want, doesn't mean other people have to put up with you.
---
It's just a matter of preference.
---
People say rebinding strafe keys and unbinding back-pedaling. 
---
Many Mythic raiders don't bother with that, they do what they are comfortable with.
---
I‚Äôve always viewed DKP vs Council in a pretty simple way. Before deciding which is better, you have to define how you and your guild want to view loot.
---
Reward - If you want to view the loot as a reward given to a player for their time and service, DKP is a good system. It‚Äôs like earning tickets at an arcade. You play all of the games and eventually get your Chinese finger trap payoff. The rush of endorphins from getting something you want. A downside to this view, is that loot is random and there are incremental benefits to be had. Not everyone gets the Chinese finger trap. Some people have to take the stale laffy taffy instead. No one wants it, but it‚Äôs there and if no one takes it, the raid doesn‚Äôt progress.
---
Resource - If you view loot dropping as a resource, that should best be allocated in a way that pushes the entirety of the guild forward, that makes subsequent farms and progression easier, this is the ideal system. The problem is, you need really good really transparent resource managers. If they do a poor job or aren‚Äôt transparent and offend people, it creates discontent.
---
There are ways you can adjust either system to make up for its weak points. You can put limitations in DKP, force upgrades on people who are clearly hoarding points, make items cost static values so classes can‚Äôt collude on tier gear to have better odds at cross class gear.  You can include rotating players in council decisions, and clearly state the reason you made the decision you did. But no system is perfect.
---
I personally like Council because it best uses gear as a resource. Instead of rewarding ONE player exceptionally well for their time invested, you‚Äôre rewarding the entire group by getting maximum benefit out of a drop.
---
As a loose example, say a Warrior wants to play Dual Wield DPS because it‚Äôs slightly better than Two Handed and it‚Äôs more fun to that player. If they take a one handed weapon drop and gain 100 DPS as a baseline, is that the best outcome? Now a two hander drops and it goes to someone for PvP or meme spec or whatever. Alternately, you realize that for the best average outcome for the raid, that one hander should go to a rogue which has less available options. Maybe the rogue only gains 80 DPS, but then the two hander drops and the warrior also gains 70 DPS. The net gain to the raid is 150, because you viewed those items as resources and placed them where the average raid output was going to benefit the most. Those are the types of outcomes that don‚Äôt happen with a typical DKP system.
---
I am going super slow this time around.
---
No more raiding or being stuck on the gear hamster wheel for me, I am just going to chill, do a lot of quests, harvest a ton of mats, do a crap load of crafting, fish for hours, cook all my fish and hang out with anyone who wants to chat while I am fishing.

Definitely not worth leveling 3 chars if u only have that much time, I‚Äôd stick to one
---
1v1 for the first few phases will be mostly what everyone is doing. Which is where druids are exceptionally good at. There‚Äôs plenty of stuns, there‚Äôs plenty of crowd control and ability to lock down a target. 
---
Regrowth and rejuvenate are easy to get off after stuns and are very good for PvP over a long fight  Being able to essentially tank through enemy burst with hots rolling makes Druid incredibly strong. Outlasting most classes is incredibly easy. 
---
People underestimate the power the Druid can bring to the table if played right. It is an extremely rewarding class in the first few phases. 
---
Not to mention you gear half of your PvP spec incredibly fast in raids. Most of your best in slot pre PvP gear is obtainable with ease. Only a few pieces require fighting against rogues for.
---
Nah make him play pvp server or tell him he can only watch you play if not.
---
We were doing the Eranikus event in Moonglade for AQ gates. Guards bug out and start attacking me, I get annoyed turn on "at war" with cenarion circle to kill them. End up nuking the entire raid's CC rep by the tens of thousands.

Safe to say I wasn't invited to many guilds after that one.
---
Sure, but its something you need to do every single week. I think druids are viable but you lose out on a ton of utility brought by warriors

I think experimental servers are a fun idea in addition to classic servers, but definitely don‚Äôt dick with the classic servers.

Yep. Instant gratification. Pity.

Doing Kel thuzad attempts on Tuesday, get home and my virgin internet won't connect. Had to do it tethered to my phone. Which, actually, was fine.
---
On the contrary, I got back to playing retail again lol. Since I haven't touched it for many years, I got a lot of content, and the old guild still is active. Classic will be a side-gig.
---
Maybe because you tell me to fuck off when I'm answering to someone else and you're downvoting my post for some reasons (like you really think it matters?)
---
And like I told you a million times: you are the one not backing your claim: plenty of people upvoted me and I gave you link to post, threads and blog saying the same and it's just you and another guy who seem to remember an alternate reality without giving me anything to back up your claims.
---
Like I said I'm pretty sure by know that you were a child when you played vanilla and your memory is very hazy
---
&gt; No need for shadow if you don't have spriest or loads of warlocks though
---
That's only true for MC, when locks are not performing well. No reason not to use it, unless you're running less than 3 warlocks for whatever reason.
---
&gt; Calm down nerd.
---
Proceeds to get mad about devs and pretends they're envious. Good shit.
---
Tetther your phone. It's fine and not a data hog.
---
Do we know if these add-ons will be live on Classic also? Or are these recommendations purely from former vanilla wow experiences?
---
Selling Eye of Flame for 15g.was a fortune for me back then
---
Any healers or hybrids can run a healing spec that will be good in both areas. 
---
Resto Shaman, Resto Druid, Holy Pally, Holy Priest. 
---
Warlock SM/Ruin
---
Hunter Marksmanship
---
Mage is fine for both fire &amp; frost depending on your raid progression.
---
Rogue is also fine with some kind Seal Fate dagger build.
---
Also, if someone is killing a quest mob you need, invite them for a chance to get credit and make a new friend
---
Leveling a paladin made me quit that character and play an alt for a few months. Most boring thing I'd ever done.
---
I played Warrior, Hunter, Druid and Mage back in Vanilla.
---
I really recommend against playing warrior for PvP. They are so dependent on good gear and support by others, that it was highly frustrating to PvP with it, that I rerolled.
---
Each of the other classes was totally fine.
---
But since you ask for 1v1 specifically... Druid is extremely hard to kill but it takes ages for the druid to kill someone. And against other healers it's basically a tie.
---
Mage is also way stronger in group-battles than in 1v1 but you won't really lose either as you can escape pretty well.
---
Hunter is really good against everything. Especially if there's room to kite.
---
I never really had queue times and I always thought my realm was decently populated. I must have been so naive back then...
---
I didn't take any time off for it. It's a marathon not a sprint lol. That said I have the Monday after off so i'll be binging that weekend
---
As a guy who fought a similar battle as a Prot Paladin back in TBC, I wish all you fuzzy guys luck. I've been there. It's an uphill battle, but if you believe you can make it work, go for it.
---
I'd prefer a queue at this point so then I can other stuff done while waiting to play and knowing there are thousands other that are waiting too.
---
This guy gets it.
---
Guy on Ravencrest-EU quit his job so he could focus on 18 hours a day grind. He quit soon after getting there as there were no other challenges.
---
This was on a private server, but I once had a shield drop that was lvl 50+ with frost damage and I had the same thinking. Think I‚Äôll stick with the sacred protector though which we all know is a joy to obtain.
---
Reminds me of that csgo video a couple of months ago where you can hear the kids dad threatening to turn is PC in the background. Then he just yells ‚ÄúNO DAD DON‚ÄôT TURN IT O....‚Äù and the whole voice chat start rolling with laughter üòÖ
---
I swear when he wrote those books everyone blew up about how shit they were and how he was a terrible writer which is why they moved onto the female writer they have now.
---
I BGed with an amazing group of people on elune.  We had the system where everyone took turns getting rank 14 and even after you got it you were supportive to others on the path. I got up to 13.  I just had got a new job and had to go for training. I asked my cousin at the time to play some for me while I was gone for the 2 to 3 days of training.  He wouldnt do it.  Fast forward.  I never got rank 14 and  to this day I still wear the Warlord title on my toon to show how close I came to it.   I regret taking that job when I did but it did provide me a better life that I enjoy today.  
---
I still regret not getting 14 though. :(  I also regret that I lost contact with alot of those people.
---
There is No Point in time where mobs could Hit you where you cant Hit Them. Its a logical Error, i used to think that aswell
---
Good for you, you‚Äôre not responding to what I said though.
---
I said the fights now are harder than anything in classic, speaking about mythic encounters.
---
Not to mention you‚Äôre talking about doing BoD at the end of the tier when you outgear it vs people doing mythic the first week it is available. Heroic is always easy.
---
WoW PvE has never had challenging gameplay mechanics. I think to date the hardest thing has been the Thaddius jump.
---
Most fights become complicated because other players make it so.
---
99.9% of the WoW community probably wont even be lvl 40 by then lol. And that may be conservative!
---
Well you know what they say when an ass makes assumptions...
---
I‚Äôd almost decided not to put myself through the agony of maining a Druid in classic again, damn you!
---
That is why I'm saying a majority of druids won't be doing this unless they put in the work.
---
What are some of those creative and weird ways?
---
i wouldnt say its exclusive by dumb masses. Just because its easy doesnt mean people who enjoy it are dumb
---
This is obviously coming from someone who hasn‚Äôt been doing the most challenging content.
---
Man you probably missed out on like 400g in crafting fees
---
Just pick a healer and do everything in your PvP spec. If you make it into raids, respec to PvE when you're progression raiding into new content and then go back to your PvP spec once everything is on farm.
---
I mean yeah tbh those are all excelent classes in 1v1 and against those it would probably come down to gear and skill but you COULD always win. 
---
Or you could at least always escape with your life :D
---
makes sense
---
This is a little confusing. You played all of 5 weeks when? Because you apparently played in Legion. Did you play for 5 weeks when Eternal was out, so most people were already decks in BoD gear and pretty much putting in on farm? That's very different from people on the cutting edge. Also as a tank, I don't remember Ursoc being any more complicated than any other fight with basic positioning and tank swap mechanics.
---
So here's what I did for server first guild lvl 25 running 3 heroic teams non-stop and one extra during daytime, beating out guilds that recruited up to 600 people to get it first (and scrubbusters, wish you luck this week!)  
---
Big ikea pot  
---
Make good chili  
---
Get a ton of wraps  
---
Keep that shit heated   
---
I scoop on 1 wrap = 10 second taco  
---
Make during bathroom breaks, have canned drinks in fridge
---
They will be pvp hit capped yes.  If pvp gear was available at launch I wouldn't have said the mage thing, but just dungeon gear and a few raid items on launch they will be squishy.
---
Just wait till you see Classic. People are gonna complain if Nefarian isn‚Äôt dead within an hour of BWL release.
---
I wouldn't care. I have a life with other things to do.
---
And what do calm people say? Also I know when I'm angry, you don't know me so how could you? Its just a bunch of sad trolls on this thread.
---
people weren't very good at the game back in the day. the world first rag kill has rogues not even using slice and dice with both weapons enchanted with fiery weapon, warriors using 2h without windfury in might gear, minimal buffs etc. so it's understandable why kills took way longer in early vanilla
---
in contrast the hardcore retail players in top guilds are much more aware of every advantage available to them and generally understand raid comps, itemisation, rotations and strategies much better. because they're using every perceivable advantage and have much greater knowledge, when they say a boss is op (idk if it is or not) they are probably in a better position to say it than a vanilla raider saying rag is op because it took 80+ days to beat him
---
"Nice heals!"
---
I got told this all the time in Classic, TBC, and even into WotLK.  I don't think I had a single 5-man run where I got complemented on my heals from Cata through WoD, and only once or twice in Legion.
---
*Not because my heals are bad, but because "success" is so default in dungeons today, that a good healer goes unnoticed.*
---
Here's the rundown if you want to rush to 60 the fastest.
---
Level 1-18, rockbiter staff throwing shocks. Attack a mob and keep attacking them on the move to the next mob. Abuse 5 second rule as much as possible.
---
Keep doing whatever you need to keep your 2h staff updated until you do RFK. Try to get the Axe. You should have imp ghost wolf, flurry and 2h weapon skill in enhacrment by your mid 20s. Melee/enhance is still the fastest way to level at this point. Hold on to gear with int for healing dungeons when you have full quests. Other than that, just get all str/agi gear.
---
The corpse maker or w/e ah blue will hold you over until mid 30s. Start collecting caster gear like the hypnotic blade and a good shield.
---
Respec elemental at 38 (4/5 points into lightning spell cast reduction, new rank of lightning bolt).  From there on out level by casting only lightning bolt (and the occasional elemental mastery chain lightning and lightning shield). It not only the fastest way to level as shaman even with chugging water, but you don't need to waste time upgrading your weapons. 
---
Don't waste mana on totems like strength of earth before level 30, or garbage like that. It will just slow you down. When you're elemental, you don't even need totems unless you multi pull. Then things like stone claw, grounding etc. Will come in handy. But otherwise they are just slowing your mana to damage rate.
---
You also don't need a second gear set. Your sp/int glass canon gear will be plenty fine to heal with. Spirit isn't as good because you can't regain mana while casting, and you want to spend as little time in between spamming lightning bolt at mobs faces as possible. Spam lb at mobs until nearly dead, down rank or finish off with 1 or 2 melee hits max, then move on to spamming lb at the next mob. You won't spend more than 5 seconds spamming lb to regen mana at all. Don't be afraid to chug water. Killing 4-5 mobs in a row 12s each and drinking w et for 25 seconds is faster than trying to regen mana and killing mobs slowly.
---
Capeesh? See you at 60.
---
No you're right smart talented people can do pve it's just not a requirement
---
Fire resist was a thing for Vaelestraz too I believe, I know in my guild we used fire resist for her.  I don't see it on your list.
---
That‚Äôs possibly the worst pvp spec I‚Äôve ever seen.
---
Here‚Äôs the spec you should use:
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#of0E0obZZVVGhRbtho
---
Yeah, I understand that. Really what I am asking is it is necessary/possible to always have +9% to hit.
---
These groups basically have the ability to field every single class in basically any kind of number and farm loot in the most efficient (and slightly crazy) manner possible. There's also that due to mythic+, titanforging, and other potential catch-up mechanics they will be pushing to the bleeding edge of gear.
---
Let's say you want to build a "perfect" tank for a raid. These guys can run groups in dungeons where everyone runs with the same loot spec as said tank, those dungeons can be mythic +15s or higher, and the gear can titanforge up and even socket. Then they can clear heroic raid with a similar goal/composition, once again just hoping for tradeable gear that is upgraded to put onto that character.
---
As such, in this modern era the raid is WAY less dependent on re-clearing the hardest raid content for equipment. And these players in these top guilds are pretty good, consistently doing all this content before the vast majority of even the cutting edge guilds can even try it. Sure, next week they will get some better gear from the next clear, but it's a different world.
---
Ok then you're a &gt;30yo person getting angry, downvoting and insulting like a teen because someone was trying to politely discuss a point of a videogame.
---
You should really go outside breathe fresh air and take a look on your life. 
---
Good bye!
---
I do remember being told about the rule that applies to the names and community. Seems like a good point, hadn't considered that.
---
Good man.
---
The difference in heroic and mythic is usually a numbers game, once people are geared enough it all falls into place.
---
Also im not sure the game is harder than classic when like i just said i started playing my 300 ilvl char and within 4 weeks downed the hardest content at the time, and then 1 shotted the hardest content after that too came out.
---
I dont think a fresh 60 would be able to do that with BWL, AQ40, or naxx
---
Which means it's not similar at all.
---
My raid team doesn't forget 20% of every fight each reset.
---
I'll start. https://youtu.be/V7y4ruVrwzo
---
One of my old 29twink compilations from vanilla. Defiantly cringe worthy. Everything from the music to the resolution.

I never understood why anyone deletes a leveled character, especially to play on a different server. Just... leave it.

there is no requirements, this is a game..

In the teitch app there is a mods section. Click on that select world of warcraft, select the version and download what you want. Its great because they update automatically instead of having to always download the latest version every time like we used to. (This could already be done with the curse client before twitch). I dont know about any other addon that isnt on teitch but elvui isnt and you have do doenload it from their page and aleays download the new version (i think they offer a premium subscription service where it does automatically but i could be wrong)
---
You plan on mixing in dungeons to your leveling route?
---
www.vanillafriends.com
---
Given average player skill... you seem to overestimate the majority of wow players lol
---
shit piss cock wank fuck \*waves slips of paper\*
---
I mean, back then we were all literally spamming one button to trigger an addon that would heal automatically (i.e. cast the appropriate rank of Healing Touch on the most suitable target and even coordinate with other addon users to cancel casts and prevent overhealing).
---
Was honestly more enjoyable than playing whack-a-mole on a 15-17" screen with nothing but 40 health bars on it.
---
Also every movement key would automatically cast Abolish Poison or Remove Curse.
---
It's going to be a lot different with the new addon API.
---
&gt; eXpOsEd
---
&gt; That's ~~because~~ *WHY* you're not a superhero.
---
The quippability IS the superpower.
---
As someone who is going to level a warrior. What? Elaborate please! :p
---
Sorry I meant not a requirement to excel at pve.  If you can learn to play a simple song on a piano (not well or anything) you have the mental capacity to beat any wow content that has ever existed.
---
It's 75% of the cost for half of the effect and if you don't need all of the effect it is lost.
---
How is using a heal more mana spent between pulls, more drinking and more downtime?
---
First of all I don't have to heal every pull. And secondly I specifically mentioned that I heal right before the next pull and not somewhere inbetween. There is no drinking and no downtime whatsoever! I only lose the 2.5 seconds it takes to cast one heal every 3-4 mobs.
---
I use PW:S when I need to prevent the spell-pushback or am trying to run away but not as a substitute for healing.
---
I think his sarcasm went over your head
---
Heart. Of. The. Wild.
---
Are you thinking more of content release, based on raids/dungeons?  Potions, reagents, etc?
---
I think it depends on what type of raiding you plan to do. If you're looking to min/max then I would assume you want to have as much hit as you possibly can at all times. 
---
However if that's not your plan, then I highly doubt it's "required" just probably "appreciated" 
---
With how few tanks I'm anticipating actually stick thought to max level and being a full blown tank main, I don't see a world where you don't get to raid just because you are under hit capped
---
"you guys" was meant as the whole classic reddit community and not you. Even tho i saw you as "another one" based on your uninformed answer about ranking.
---
Sure its unhealthty to sit at your computer all day. And yes classic will force you do to this every day past rank 12 if you want to achieve your goal. He IS right that its unhealthty, he is NOT right that is should be removed and its " astronomically fucking stupid". Not having such goals in retail is fucking stupid.  
---
What im trying to say is, is that this NEEDS to be in the game, not for the sake of blizzlike vanilla, but for the sake of the game. You cant have rare achievements if they are easy to get. In real life and in games, we need what seems like unobtainable goals, so we have something to strive for and keep fighting for, and for others to admire and respect.If none of us looks up to the stars and dream, we will never work towards a higher goal.
---
We choose to go to the rank 14, not because they are easy, but because they are hard.
---
Is this similar to when you would loot somthing and then move around hunched over for the next 20 minutes?
---
That's like when a grenade falls next to you and you can't do nothing about it, but blow up with it.
---
Not like i'm speaking from personal experience, just ingame stuff üòÇ
---
Super cool. Do you plan on providing/Is there a public repo to look at the source?
---
There's just a completely different dynamic here. We had hardcore raiders back then, but how many guilds were around that had full raids of players who could basically play WoW as a job, and were top-caliber players? How many attempts did those guilds actually have on those bosses. A surface level look sees the old bosses taking months to down, but that doesn't consider whether or not current raiders are also just putting in way more effort with way more coordination and pouring in way more time per day/week.
---
Why? This sub is by no means toxic at all.
---
Here‚Äôs the thing. If it‚Äôs fun and you love it there‚Äôs nothing wrong with playing a Druid. The thing people need to understand is your likelihood of having the support system Skarm has (I‚Äôve even heard horror stories about him) or the skill level of Javel, Stormx, Taladril, Ebn, Shedo, or Sodapoppin is VERY VERY LOW. If you‚Äôre reading this and calling bullshit, then you‚Äôve either played a Druid and made it work for you with a lot of effort (or naturally gifted), or you‚Äôre floating down a river in Egypt. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a population of both, and Druid naysayers are targeting the latter as nobody is going to talk shit about Skarm. But Skarm is Skarm and you are you. Know thyself
---
Paladin warrior combo is a dream. Dont see any reason why you shouldn't roll a warrior. Even as a casual player, they're still very fun. And with a pocket healer buddy you cant go wrong. I'm a warrior at heart and have been leaning druid lately, but I'm thinking the same thing about the forms. Not sure I want to stare at a bear's ass or goofy horns as a tauren cat.
---
All 3 are on warcraftmovies.com with the German metal and everything.
---
Yepp :)
---
I actually bought glider when I was a kid, couldn‚Äôt figure out how to use it thankfully and never got banned!
---
It has to be an on-going process and it will inevitably end in homogenization. Retail isn't balanced (check how popular Arms is in Pve for example) and blizzard change it constantly. So no, it shouldn't be touched. They can't balance their retail and you think they will do it for Classic? hah...
---
Damn...first we started with "more content" and now it's time for the fundamentals of the game... Damn thing isn't even out. I shudder to think what will happen once it's out.
---
Yeah, pretty much that. Each phase comes with new content and if you got some far-sight or experience what's needed in those particular patches, it's time to print money.
---
I were entierly genuine. 
---
Unless you're a Rogue or a Warrior, i'd say Dwarf is always the right option.
---
I've always disliked characters that cant wear shoes/boots. I love plate armor, orc warrior for me yes please
---
What you are really saying is retail content isn‚Äôt hard when you outgear it. You didn‚Äôt do the content at 300 ilvl, or if you did you had a fully mythic geared group carrying you. That same fully mythic geared group will easily step into heroic and clear it.
---
That‚Äôs not the same thing as a fresh 60 jumping into those raids. Not even close.
---
Raiding in retail is objectively more difficult in retail when it comes to bosses and mechanics. Everyone always says the hardest part of classic was just getting the 40 people.
---
Main is hard, alts are easy, but somewhat dependent on main.
---
1. If my main is a Druid, my alts will be Hunter, Mage, Paladin or Shaman, Priest, Rogue, Warlock, and Warrior.
---
2. If my main is a Hunter, my alts will be Druid, Mage, Paladin or Shaman, Priest, Rogue, Warlock, and Warrior.
---
3. If my main is a Mage, my alts will be Druid, Hunter, Paladin or Shaman, Priest, Rogue, Warlock, and Warrior.
---
4. If my main is a Paladin, my alts will be Druid, Hunter, Mage, Priest, Rogue, Warlock, and Warrior.
---
5. If my main is a Priest, my alts will be Druid, Hunter, Mage, Paladin or Shaman, Rogue, Warlock, and Warrior.
---
6. If my main is a Rogue, my alts will be Druid, Hunter, Mage, Paladin or Shaman, Priest, Warlock, and Warrior.
---
7. If my main is a Shaman, my alts will be Druid, Hunter, Mage, Priest, Rogue, Warlock, and Warrior.
---
8. If my main is a Warlock, my alts will be Druid, Hunter, Mage, Paladin or Shaman, Priest, Warlock, and Warrior.
---
9. If my main is a Warrior, I will not have time for alts as I will be leveling weapon skills.
---

First experience with this was somebody saying ‚Äúpat‚Äù in a deadmines group and I kept looking around for a man named Pat... never found him but I did find a group of bandits who‚Äôd in turn smack me dead
---
&gt; of course they are stuffing loads and loads of political left leaning social commentary into each and ever movie
---
Yes, a tank is expected to be hit capped.
---
Required hit for a boss is based in its level, so a dungeon boss who is 62 would require less hit than a raid boss which is effectively 63-65 (don‚Äôt remember)
---
After you‚Äôre hit capped there is expertise, but you don‚Äôt have to be capped on that.
---
If you‚Äôve got full level 60 blues, you should easily be hit capped already
---
Ok. This may be embarrassment time but I've been playing wow since classic (excluding the last expansion) and I still keyboard turn. What's the alternative and what are the benefits?
---
Oh thank god. The insane prices these things went for on private servers, and the fact that they were obsoleting raid gear was just nuts. 
---
Hopefully this doesn't apply to the dungeon blue random drops like Incidius bracers and archivist cape though. Those gave high levels reasons to join instance groups, and the difficulty of getting them was more commiserate with the reward.
---
Why do people keep trying to reinvent the wheel here?
---
Whether you're looking for a meme build or an actual build it will be online. Trying to "create" a build is pointless and just a waste of time.
---
Oh wow I just may be experiencing some minor early signs of this... will adjust accordingly!
---
Thank you for sharing your tale, it just may have saved a game!
---
LOOT THE WHOLE CHEST
---
Also this
---
It's worth pointing out to someone concerned and asking for advice.  My philosophy is play the class you want and if you're competent someone will have a spot for you.  But if op is on the fence and worried about his late game usefulness then a hunter does have drawbacks worth pointing out.
---
&gt; A subscription will pay for both classic and retail
---
A sub will provide classic and retail *up to Legion* content.
---
I played shadow with a warlock buddy quite a bit in Vanilla and it was super fun. Between all of our CC, healing, damage and felpuppy we felt like Gods in AV/AB. I have to imagine you'll be monsters in wpvp too
---
Only "opportune" ones that give a really good quest reward.
---
Its faster to skip them if you want.
---
I plan on completing every UC quest within reason on my orc shaman.  That will slow me down inevitably but to each their own. The overall strategy is the same. Leveling routes will vary.
---
i just recently played BFA foir 5 weeks, i quit after the first week of Eternal palace release, once i had downed it with an incompetent guild. Week 1 my 120 char was about 300 ilvl, I got to 385 the first week and was going to HBod, I did mythic the week before the patch dropped (which i was then able to rapidly get to 415 before eternal palace)
---
And i never said ursoc was complicated, just that i had to focus harder than normal, the swaps were on a tight window and actually mattered, where as Queen Azshara has a swap mechanic that you are suggested to swap at 30 stacks, but we would let it go to 50 or more since it allowed the OT to help with the add stuff
---
I would suggest using a Razer Naga mouse for the option of using your thumb for keybinds as well as keys on the keyboard that you can alternate back and forth with. As for the class, hunter is probably one of the most AFK classes for dealing damage. Night Elf hunter with a stealth cat you can just afk anywhere. Feign death is also nice. I've been feigning death irl since Cataclysm.
---
My first ever toon was a Tauren Druid and I was specced balance for leveling. Considering I was a ‚Äúspell casting Druid‚Äù naturally I needed to wear cloth like a wizard character, so I picked up tailoring and made all my own gear. I was in the mid 30s wearing shit greens I made for myself with tailoring. Refused to wear leather thinking it would make me cast slower...
---
Mine was getting upset and throwing a hissy fit and blowing up my guild because the officers changed our raid time by an hour while I was on vacation. I was 17 then, and still cringe when I think about it.
---
I had a friend I met in-game while playing an ally rogue. We got along like a house on fire, and had been in contact for a while, just shooting the shit. One day, I log on and he'd like, "Yo, we're gonna roll horde, you should come along." So, I was like, fuck it, why not? Best ^WoW decision ever, been horde ever since, *loved* kalimdor and ended up raiding (see: goofing off in MC) with them until TBC dropped.
---
It's not misleading, but it's hinting at a big possibility (Disney buying ATVI) with very little of substance to go off of. I'd say that's a form of clickbait.
---
How do you stand the new animations? UD is ruined and Human males do a weird comical run
---
I cried.
---
Second breakfast!
---
This ratio is true but I would argue it is offset by the fact there will be less hunters in your raid group to fight over gear and also their is less shared gear.  If a one handed sword drops you're going to have 15 rogues and fury warriors fighting over it.  A bow drops......2 maybe 3 hunters rolling.  Sames goes with all of their gear not just weapons.
---
Yeah, before ~40 just go enahance.
---
The things that make elemental work in the first place are all deep ele talents and skills learned at or after 30.
---
Without the talent to reduce lightning cast speed, crit, crit multiplier, etc. ele is hot garbage.
---
&gt; Its faster to skip them if you want.
---
not anymore its not, unless theyre nerfed from the beta
---
Okay, so my head-math was slightly off, I'll grant you that.
---
And, sure, PW:S is wasted if you don't use all of it's absorb or it's duration runs out.  But that also means that *you didn't take any damage.* No damage mean no HP to heal, which means no mana usage.  And even if you did use all of the absorb, a lot of time that means you could cast a down-ranked heal or a renew to top yourself off; again less mana usage than a full heal.
---
That's not the point.  The point is that while your swing timer is resetting, you don't want to get hit.  It's not about being out of range so only you can hit them.  It's about being out of range so that you can maximize the ratio of damage in your favor.
---
To do some really simple math, let's say you have a 3.5 swing and do 350 damage.  Most mobs have a 2.0 swing, so let's say the mob does 200 damage.  If you both stand there and slug it out, then you can do 350 damage every 3.5 seconds, and they can do 200 damage every 2.0 seconds, which means you are both doing 100 DPS to each other.
---
However, if you can control the fight so that you're both out of range while your swing timer is going, let's say you are only in range for a period of a second, every 4 seconds.  Now, you're both getting 1 swing every 4 seconds (because you can't hit when out of range).  Now, you're doing 87.5 DPS, and the mob is doing 50 DPS.  You've gone from equal DPS to each other, to doing 75% more DPS than the mob.
---
It's not about "I can hit you but you can't hit me."  It's about the mob having a hit ready that it can't use until your hit is ready as well.  It's almost like an interrupt for melee, or a significant attack speed debuff, in that it makes him hit a lot less.
---
Now, if it takes you longer to get out of range, that second hit may get off from the mob.  So now, instead of you reducing the damage the mob deals, you're still taking 2-3 hits while you get out of range.  Hits you don't return back, because you're on swing timer.
---
I remember my first serious raid ever was a PUG ICC. Now I had been playing since vanilla but had really never gotten into serious raiding. Well during all the trash mobs I was top three DPS. Someone in the raid made a comment and I called them out for low DPS....before we had even made it to a boss. The whole raid laughed and said dps on trash mobs don't matter where I proceeded to argue against and say yes they did.   Well first boss comes around and guess who is at the bottom of the charts.  XD

Then by all means, grab 3-4 warrior buddies, drop WF and go to town on SM/RFD/ZF

Exactly the guy took all the bis loot as soon as it drop and loot council it to himself. He's going to do the same bullshit where he takes the loot in his classic guild. And calls me the loot whore lol

That must have been a big fucking rooster.

Almost like all those things exist in the real world? It must be terrifying for you to get through each day...
---
A few things:
---
-bought all the mats for Stormshroud gear, traded them to a LW who said he‚Äôd craft them for me, he traded me a green helm back for some reason then he logged and blocked me. GM said since he traded me something there was no way to prove he scammed me. Pretty sweet.
---
-grinded from 40-60 pretty much, didn‚Äôt use the AH hardly at all for cloth or the white mats that dropped. Could‚Äôve been way richer but I assumed no one else could afford to just buy bulk cloth.
---
Warrior/Priest
---
Sounds like a slippery little gnome. Hopefully you take that grudge out on many little gnomes this time around
---
Yes, I custom printed it from a plotter here at work
---
As long as this doesn't lead to the same kind of Simcraft circle-jerk like Retail, I'm on board.
---
Enhance DPS is legit if the fight is 45 seconds long and you don't mind having Stormstrike debuff take up a slot that would be much better used on something else.
---
And this
---
Funnily enough I had ordered about 7 strategy guides that haven't show up yet lol
---
I will be playing a video game, not following a script.
---
True!
---
Classic is way more work to manage, alot more ppl to keep track of, and less loot to distribute. This creates situations that can quickly tear a guild apart if you can‚Äôt logically justify your decision. A dkp system gives the illusion that you yourself is in charge, ppl like that element of control.
---
Either just move on to tbc or keep everything the same and keep the servers on the Naxx patch. It‚Äôs not classic if blizzard is rebalancing classes.
---
Did someone say...
---
Because of what I've been reading in this thread I think I'm going to find a gm who is a different class than me lol
---
Tanks are the sliding scale of progress. Your first priority is to stay alive. The better your healers skill and gear, the more defensive stats you can give up in favor of threat stats. At the same time, if your DPS aren‚Äôt very well geared and don‚Äôt show up with consumables, the more likely it is your min/maxing of threat won‚Äôt matter.
---
Step 1: Have enough defensive gearing to stay alive.
---
Step 2: Have enough threat gear to accommodate your DPS‚Äôs gear/skill/preparation level.
---
Step 3: Fill in more defensive stats so long as you‚Äôre sure you have threat covered (because having twice as much threat as your highest DPS gains the raid literal nothing, whereas additional defensive gear makes it less likely you die and can conserve healer mana).
---
Ultimately, you‚Äôre hopefully going to be stuck in Step 2, if the people surrounding you are doing a good job, but a lot of tanks in casual scenarios might find themselves in 1 or 3.
---
That said, Hit is the best stat for threat, because it applies to all skills. Attack power influences heroic strike and revenge, but not Sunder or Shield Slam. Crit influences heroic strike, revenge, AND shield slam, but not Sunder. Hit influences all of them. This alone makes it a pretty important stat.
---
Given how important hit is, it makes Weapon Skill key, too. Your first 5 weapon skill against a level 63 boss is effectively 3% hit (and also reduces your change to be dodged or parried by 0.5% each, so an overall reduction in avoided attacks of 4%). Further, it reduces your white attacks glancing damage reduction (glances occur on 40% of attacks against 63 bosses), from 65% to 85%. White attacks are one of two ways to generate rage (the other being damage taken), so an increase to white damage for a tank is a pretty big deal.
---
So don‚Äôt automatically assume you need hit cap for pre-raid, just be prepared to adjust your gear as it becomes viable to, and think about how stats actually affect your rotation.
---
I think 200k after 6 months is reasonable. Obviously that‚Äôs not popular hence downvotes but I‚Äôll be playing anyways. If you don‚Äôt think classic wow will be the most played game of the decade you‚Äôre wrong on this sub.
---
Hey Pterodactly14,
---
My work schedule involves working every other weekend. So half the time, I have no restriction on the weekend.
---
The other half of the time, depending on my job location, I have to leave the house by 11:30a hard stop. 
---
You are right that otherwise everything seems to mesh, but like I said, I am a serious player and I feel as though walking into a situation where I have a guaranteed conflict is not optimal for me, and more importantly not optimal for the other 39 players in the raid.
---
Is 12-3 absolute, set-in-stone?
---
Oh boy, a Spinal Reaper just for me!*Yoink*
---
Very next raid " Oh boy, a Bone Reaver's Edge! Just for me! *yoink*
---
Following raid "Wow, 4/5 of my judgement set dropped, I'm so lucky! *yoink*
---
-Esfand, probably.
---
Overall, I agree. The stories for warcraft and the different factions/races are really well done and have more gray area and complexity than a lot of more popular fantasies, especially at the time. 
---
But (or, kind of even to your point), tbf, there were a lot of folks in the Alliance that tried to hold Arthas back from going all out for revenge, and I think it was Muradin (??) that tried *desperately* to stop Arthas going after Frostmourne, but to no avail. Then Arthas got possessed and the rest is history. 
---
Even the way the humans treated the orcs isn't unjustified, I mean, the orcs came through the portal under the thrall of demons, bloodthirsty for war, and by the time the humans put down the orcs, I gotta imagine they harbored some intense distrust for the orcish horde, hence concentration camps for these "bloodthirsty aliens." 
---
That said, fuck the alliance, the horde just want to live in peace and rebuild their people/kingdoms and if that means red is dead then so be it, see you fuckers in STV.
---
One downside is you could get diminishing returns quickly on fear since you both have that spell.  But otherwise both classes work well together.  Warlocks love power word shield to be able to cast a lot of their spells while getting hit from hunters, rogues, etc.
---
Expertise isn‚Äôt a classic stat, if was added in TBC.
---
Sure a fresh 60 would be able to do that. They would get carried thru nax just like you got carried thru bod.
---
Mythic Jaina is a 300+ pull fight. If you leveled, geared and cleared mythic in a 4 week span it means the guild you were in already had mythic bod on farm when you joined and just opted to carry you.
---
Was it Khadgar EU? :)
---
You shouldn‚Äôt read his posts. It‚Äôs just blatant lies and other gibberish. Just downvote and move on.
---
Play a warlock, if you're at all in doubts about the group time, play classic for your experience. Friends are important yes, but you have to have your own thing otherwise you may feel "forced" into a roll and if someone stops playing or slows down, there may be some disappointment because you "only played a warrior for them"
---
Hell hath no fury like a woman who has been ganked!

Expertise didn't come out until halfway through TBC.

Expertise essentially replaced Weapon skill stats.

the fuck? no...

How is this GearScore? Even in retail, no one uses SimCraft results as a qualifier for inclusion or not. It's simply a too used to help you better yourself as a player. Often the value presented isn't even possible due to fight mechanics.
---
You're worried about a problem that doesn't exist.
---
Oh you‚Äôll see it. Even way before BWL. But you probably won‚Äôt believe and claim that blizzard made Classic to easy.

I know right? If he was a true vanilla player then he did not have time to sire a child. Someone else was definitely plowing the fields, so to speak.

Mickey Mouse becomes the new warchief. You heard it here first orcs.

I mean, that's great.  I'll probably check it out, but I won't require any of my guildies to use it.

Is this confirmed? Because I was wondering the other day if it would be and am pumped if it's true.
---
I still hold a grudge (15ish years later) against the rogue that ninjaed Alcor's Sunrazor from me right before Drakk in UBRS. We agreed on loot rules at the start and they lost the roll. I can't remember why we had to all pass then /roll at the time, but I think it was because there was a bug with group loot. The rogue rolled a 2, I rolled a 99, then the rogue grabbed the dagger, pulled the boss, and left the group.
---
Why are there huge black bars on this image?
---
Great question and good intuition regarding feasibility. copy/paste from some other stuff I've written:
---
What about healers?
---
Healers are a little more complex than damage dealers because they often aren‚Äôt concerned with maximizing healing per second (hps) like damage dealers are with dps. Fight mechanics like incoming burst damage and encounter duration come into play, causing different stats to be more or less valuable for different fights. As an example, in longer fights the benefits of spirit, mp5, etc become a lot more valuable to them. Other fights require intense throughput but don‚Äôt last as long, increasing the benefit of raw +healing and +crit. These considerations make it hard to create blanket statements as to what is ‚Äúbest‚Äù. I‚Äôd like to add support for them, possibly with sliders for fight longevity, but I‚Äôm waiting to see how that idea develops. Please let me know if you have suggestions or want this feature.
---
It's almost like gear is the best indicator of a random player's performance. Don't want gear checks? Lead the pugs yourself or make enough of a name for yourself that your skill is publicly known.
---
Asking randoms to take a chance on you because you say you know how to do the content is rather selfish and ignorant. They're going to scrutinize you by what is available and what is relatively quick. GS and achievements were easy ways to present that information.

Hey wrong meme

What really? Spinal reaper is an amazing pvp 2h-er for warriors,

Shame, really.

This fiber isnt going to eat itself.

Hello. Just curious what you are playing. I will be in a similar situation and will be playing a mage with friends but am not sure what my other Char will be.
---
No, not really.
---
There is a huge difference in commitment between 11/12 versus hitting 10.
---
Most people who are "fairly" serious about pvp will cap out at 10. It gets much, much harder from there.
---
His post just shows that he was pretty damned hardcore about it, just not *poop-sock, don't sleep, play all day and have someone play for you for the 3 hours you ultimately do end up sleeping* hardcore.
---
&gt;Now, if it takes you longer to get out of range,
---
Agreed on everything, but this is not the Case. The kiting Radius goes Up because both Parties have More range but the ability of running away Out of the Monsters range (after you did your big Hit) stays exactly the same.
---
Okay, so my beef with Simcraft is different than with raider IO and iLevel; which DO have inclusion issues.
---
I have done this, yes.  My guild sucked at raiding.
---
Would there be a possiblity to have some suggestion of items. Never played a caster on any private server and don't know any names. Gotta sift through databases forever.

When you have mained a character named Bob the last 14 years, yes.

I‚Äôm going to assume that the zones are going to be packed but I feel that the server will be stable. I‚Äôm hoping to be at least level 20 in the first 20 hours Back in OG vanilla I could maintain one level per hour up until about Level 30. I‚Äôm taking the whole week off and I plan on playing 12 to 14 hours a day. I will probably Get to lvl 40. I‚Äôm gonna take time to lvl professions and get a bank alt to lvl 5, and do dungeons when possible.

---
Great points, you really expanded on concerns I had in my head that I  didn't have the words for.  You'd certainly need to approach it differently. The first idea that jumped into my head would be ranking the gear on a boss to boss basis. Not sure how this would materialize but you are very correct in alluding to how much varies between different encounters
---
There is a shield from the summoned boss in ubrs with 20 spelldamage I think
---
I do like 0/24/27 hunter spec for pvp, and it can translate well in pve, especially early on when you need surefooted to get up to the amount of +hit you need. People might bitch at you for no trueshot, but I never found it to be an issue. If you play well you'll still be near the top in MC raids.
---
Just don't take it on my server then buddy!

I expect to work a full day, and come home to the servers literally in flames.

I'll happily get all my flight paths, see who else tried to logged in on discord, and then come back the next day to hopefully better conditions.

You're the one that brought up store mounts, he never mentioned it. Just because store mounts aren't predatory in nature doesn't mean that Activision doesn't participate in other predatory behaviors related to retail wow.

These people literally are telling you that a *game* is somehow more enjoyable if you *don't know its rules*.

They are not very smart people.

---
I understand your beef with those. For what it's worth, I don't think that will be a problem in Classic. Over half the classes/specs have BiS gear that is lower "ilvl" than the highest stuff. Mages don't even ever wear full tier gear so their max "ilvl" for BiS would be lower than their highest potential, assuming they were just wearing the highest ilvl stuff.
---
Yes and no. Dumping energy asap to have SnD up 100% is good. But using BS or SS when building up asap is just waste of time.
---
no raiding mage build has IB anyways
---
Haha "idk boss I just couldn't open trade with then must be a bug"
---
Great question, thanks for letting me know this would be useful. I've done a bit of thinking about this myself and I have something planned -- stay tuned.
---
Dude how?  I played like 8+ hours a day from Vanilla through Wrath, and then more casually for every expansion since then and I've never had an issue because of it.
---
I've had more wrist/hand issues in the past 5 years from turning screwdrivers and using drills than 15 years of constant gaming before that.

---
I'm torn between rogue and priest. I intend to mostly raid (not full hardcore, but guild runs) and world pvp. I've mained healer and rogue in retail before so I enjoy the gameplay of both, so my decision ultimately comes down to quality of life:  
---
\- Ease of gearing: I'll be grouping with some friends so pre-bis farming should be easier, but I'm concerned how much it will take to gear a rogue in raids than a priest due to competition with other dps classes, and how much harder it will be to get a group in the first place (if I played rogue I'd be dagger to reduce competition over swords)
---
\- Spec swapping: I've read that priests can play a hybrid shadow/holy spec that is okay at raid healing, world pvp and aoe farming in early vanilla content, however I'm under the impression rogues have a rough time as combat in pvp. I ideally want to minimise spec swapping between raiding / gold farming / world pvp
---
\- Multiple gear sets: raiding as a holy priest I know there will be some gear change requirements needed for farming / world pvp as shadow, but would it be a full separate gear set or just some extra pieces, and how competitive is it to get the required pieces against mages/warlocks? Is it worth dealing with that competitiveness up front as a rogue and having gear that works for both pve and pvp?
---
\- Scaling: I've read that rogues scale badly into naxx because other classes' tier sets are so strong for pvp, will I feel neutered? Are shadow priests as powerful as ever in pvp in late vanilla?
---
Any insight on the above points would be greatly appreciated, either from vanilla or pservers
---
I'm all for not having people stand around for 5 minutes doing absolutely nothing after each trash mob pull.  
---
But I think the average player skill won't change much aside a select few in each guild trying to herd cats.

Pt wont be available before phase 5? Sigh
---
Don't sleep on that +spirit stave from WC. It hits like a truck and the 5 second rule ticks at level 20ish are pretty handy. The staff progression up to level 20 is pretty outstanding for shamans in barrens.
---
Depending on if you want to drop the 10ish minutes of running to TB and flying back the cauldron stirrer is a nice boost at level 10.
---
Willitclassic.com
---
that is exactly my use case most of the times, other times it is 'enjoyable background noise to pay loose attention to while doing mundane things'
---
Good idea. You could start small w/ expected boss durations and then get more complex with i.e. incoming burst (which would affect required throughput and subsequently increase the value of +healing)
---
Oh man. I remember how epic it felt to turn in Onyxias head and everyone getting the buff. Felt great
---
I believe all patches and expansion releases will mirror the release schedule as it was back in 1999-2001. So, much faster than the original P99 since there's a lot less development required. P99 Blue was essentially the beta for this new server.

This is great!

One thing I noticed you might want to include as an option for glass cannon is the Inferno Robe. I got it for my fire mage twink and I thought it was a good fit as it stood out visually and the +20 Int.

In 1 week they can only get the loot from 7 Mythic bosses.

If they wait a bit and get more people geared from the Eternal Palace Mythic, they'll probably be able to have an easier fight.

They need few weeks to get geared from the raid then clean it, no ?

Server reputation is number 1, but also fully loot your beast kills so skinners can level their profession!

My guild wasnt doing it. I really dont like to have to explain every little detail, I was just trying to get a simple point across. Ive been playing for 15 years i know what i am talking about, sure they have upped the difficulty of mechanics for encounters, doesnt mean that pve is hard. Even Preach often talks about how Blizz has made "another one boss raid". Which refers to how only the last boss is the only boss that offers a real challenge or hold up
---
Have fun.
---
The bindings have a low drop chance.  Some guilds never got TF.   Our guild never got 1.  In fact, there wasn't one on the server.  That really hurts progression too, because that thing is stupidly op

Something close to this was the standard frost pvp spec before ice barrier got buffed/talents reworked.  1.12 ice barrier is better.
---
It reminds situation, not in vanilla, but in TBC. I played as a holy paladin and had a BT pug. My friend sat next to me and was watching how I‚Äôm playing. So we were cleaning trash and healing necklace dropped (if I can recall), so I needed it and rolled around 90. I won it, raised my hands up and was like ‚ÄúYESSSS!, and turned to my friend. Then I saw a weird smile on his face and turned back to look at the screen: ‚ÄúDisconnected from the server‚Äù. When I logged in, server rolled back a couple of minutes and my necklace was gone.
---
Rogue/Mage is stupidly strong. You basically have two of the highest control-based classes in the game with some of the highest burst damage put together.
---
This guy (me) is talking about Vanilla and Classic, not private servers, and it is talking about the vast majority of players that believe that Druids that aren't farming MCPs and rank 12-13 PvP gear (which will be most Druid players) will have better threat than Warriors.
---
As I said, I am not denying that a handful of players in a handful of guilds, that are hardcore enough to farm MCPs and rank 12-12 gear, and work to prove themselves in a guild, will not be raid tanks. They WILL be raid tanks.
---
However, the vast majority of Feral Druids will not farm MCPs, nor rank 12-13, and will realize that they are subpar to Warriors, and ragequit because "people" told them that Druids can be as good as a tank, in raids, as Warriors, which is a blatant lie.
---
Without MCPs and high PvP gear and, Druids don't hold a candle in Threat and Mitigation to Warriors. Simple as that. This was a harsh reality in Vanilla, and it will be a harsh reality in Classic.
---
Wanna be a Druid tank in raids? Make sure you have enough time and dedication to do it, because if you don't have the time and dedication (which most players will not have) you will not going to tank raids as a Druid.
---
Not at all.
---
Clearing Naxxramas will probably require you to farm a bit in the initial effort to get pre raid bis, and after it's in the 10-12 hours a week ballpark, farming included.
---
haha okay, so what is "almost 1 week of ranking points" ?
---
I don‚Äôt feel so good Mr. Stark.....
---
The biggest complaint from players in general is that Dungeon Set 2 came too late.
---
The biggest complaint for PvE hardcore raiders is that its too powerful gear for early on.  But yet we are getting 1.10 version items that exist in phase 1 from the get go... so imo they are being hypocrites.
---
Don't conflate an ever growing/changing game like Retail to a static game like Classic. Homogenization happened in retail as a symptom of overall class bloat and more and more systems being added to the game, not due number tweaking balance.
---
Were you ninja looting sometimes?

Oh man having a hidden stat to other classes sounds like a recipe for disaster. If only someone at blizzard could of predicted that you could of been spared

There being a best way to do things, and wanting to know or do exactly that, is not the same as aggressively gatekeeping.
---
This is a sub about discussing classic wow, and optimisation has the most room for discussion. A laissez faire attitude isn't provocative of discussion.
---
There are better and best classes, specs, routs, etc. 
---
If you don't want to discuss optimisation, don't.
---
If you don't want to be optimal, don't be.
---
The people who gatekeep and the people who don't want to meet their standards wouldn't benefit from grouping up anyways, let each enjoy the game however they damn well please.

Every guild I‚Äôve ever raided in has had carries in the guild. Even when I raided at world 45th, we carried someone‚Äôs wife.

They are setting up stuff like in 1.12 bgs were cross server way before that stage

Ah gotcha! Awesome, thanks.

Oh, don't get me wrong, I love all the modern resources that we have.  They have helped push the quality of the average player up much higher (if they know how to utilize the tools available) than anything we saw in vanilla.

Again, my issue is when certain tools become mainstream and start affecting the culture of the game as a whole.  Especially if it leads to a certain level of elitism like my aforementioned gripes.
---
Same. I've narrowed it down to either a mage or a warlock but actually deciding is fucking hell.
---
I will however have a shaman alt.
---
You could potentially make an encounter like that but it would mean the vast amount of other classes would be left out of the final encounter, not everyone has multiple characters. Also the final boss is not tested on the ptr. That being said raid composition is a massive part of these try‚Äôs and is likely why they haven‚Äôt just given up and said it‚Äôs overtuned yet.
---
Might be but the effort to get it makes it fair
---
Yeah, very much this. I don't know where this idea of everyone being dumb as rocks in Classic came from, but plenty of people knew that T0 wasn't BiS, plenty of people utilised stats like Spell Power, Healing Power, Defense, AP. People DID know how to play this game.
---
I had a Druid friend back in Classic that was allowed time to farm his Rank 13, he was in his best in slot available to him pre-AQ/Naxx, he was armed to the teeth. The guy off-tanked for his guild regularly. Bears had a place, it's just not optimal to use them in every single fight.
---
True, but it does wonder for boomkin
---
I love druids, they are a lot of fun. 
---
I think it was in Wrath that druids got Typhoon, the pushback spell. That's when I always guarded the lumber mill.
---
We had someone ninja that mount on my server too it was huge drama on the forums. I believe they server transferred too. Nothing provokes a whole servers rage like a ninja'd mount
---
Play a boomkin for a month come back and read this post again and tell us how your experience has been.
---
What is the synergy here?
---
The min max attitude has never not existed people just weren't as right back then but they still called shit classes shit.
---
I hope you'll succeed mister tank !
---
&gt; A better geared healer that doesn't know how to down-rank properly will do much worse than one that does that has inferior gear. 
---
*laughs in holy paladin*
---
It‚Äôs in the link.
---
If you have half a brain you can play a mage with whatever spec in PvP and do well.
---
All these people saying that "lol its gonna be the ebin server crash xD" are letting their nostalgia get the best of them. Legion launch -- switch is flipped, play smoothly for 45 min, my desktop bricks itself and I swap to my laptop, login, keep playing till max. BFA launch -- 100 people on my screen, switch is flipped, walk to the starting instance, DC after clipping into some geometry, log back in, play till max. Blizzard launches are categorically smooth... server-side.
---
Gameplaywise? It should be practically unplayable due to the amount of people (and that's a good thing)
---
Exactly I still think these applications are helpful simply because it allows us to see how much a stat will increase our dps. Take a fury warrior for example. At a certain point 1 agi becomes more or less valuable than 1 str.
---
Correct. Youll be wearing t1-2 in engame, but goodluck. Most people will be wearing random crap they find. Walking trash compactors/garbage cans.
---
*YOU GET BACK IN YOUR CAGE*
---
I HOPE NOT. this was the beginning of the decline of wow community.  anonymity means being able to act like an asshat/ninja ect and just transfer off to another server.   Vanilla used to mean your rep followed you. and if you ruined it you had to re-roll and hope no one figured out who you were.  
---
guilds imploded when all the tanks or half the tanks and healers xfered to antoher server ahead in content to "play with friends" excuse.   sever transfers, race change and name changes should not be allowed (also faction change)
---
Bummer. Sucks when the whole group agrees except one asshat
---
I'm pretty sure I can see that level 52 robe was it red?
---
If it takes weeks for Method, it will take months for any regular hardcore guild to take a boss down.
---
You don't *dream* about WoW?!
---
Ran Rogue/Rogue and Rogue/Mage duo. Leveling, BG, world PvP, etc.
---
I agree with what you said, specifically a frost mage with a Rogue. I think dual Rogues was a lot more fun though.
---
UD shadow priests are not useless against dwarves, but their racial is.
---
Haha sounds like someone needs to watch their back during classic!
---
Damn...
---
Well let people play like they want to.
---
I agree that min/max may bring bad behavior but just avoid the player you don't want to play with.
---
Min/maxer will clean the content faster than you. So, in some way they'll probably be bored before you but will probably crush you in PvP.
---
Yeah a dkp drama sucks especially when an agreement had been made prior and then isn't followed through with
---
The skips are hotly debated. The devs don‚Äôt like them, most of the playerbase doesn‚Äôt like them, and a lot of the people who use them end up expressing regret for the decision. I‚Äôm solidly in the ‚Äúthey shouldn‚Äôt even exist‚Äù camp, but I understand the business pressures which made them necessary.
---
1-50 may be slow, but it‚Äôs the foundation for everything that comes after (and 2.4-2.55 is freaking amazing). Skipping straight past all that makes it really hard to understand the emotional impact of everything that comes after, and watching a summary on youtube or reviewing the cutscenes in the inn just isn‚Äôt the same.
---
As for the GCD, I did address that later in the comment chain. But for the beginner levels, a lot of the people migrating from the game find it offputting that they can‚Äôt frenziedly slam buttons right from level 1.
---
I don't know exactly how it compares to vanilla ele shaman (I played alliance in vanilla, and never leveled a shaman until like Cata) but NF/Conflag warlock is pretty bursty.  It's often overlooked compared to SM/Ruin min/max raid spec and Soul Link PvP specs, but I played it all of vanilla and plan to play it again in Classic.
---
Once I needed malachite for an engineering item. I was maybe level 15. I tried to buy one malachite from a random person for *barely* more than what the NPC merchants would offer. He quickly scolded me for being a noob.
---
It‚Äôs not all of the people who concern themselves with min/max builds. It‚Äôs the people that are telling people that they need to play a certain way, which is an issue on both sides. You, for example, are telling people that trying to min/max and discuss it openly is hurting the community. That isn‚Äôt true. 
---
Those who are insulting those others over opinion and those who are gatekeeping how to play this game are the ones that are hurting this community.
---
You should max your hit as much as you can
---
This spec is awful.
---
I'm gonna make my character as soon as possible (launch day I assume) then probably not touch the game for three or four days and let the powergamers do their thing.

I can get behind that, dual rogues is being assholes in the best way and having fun while mage/rogue is more effective.
---
Or her spider pet Arachgorn?
---
This is how I am. Having patience and busying myself doesn't seem like a mindfuck to me.
---
Thank you for putting this in very clear terms.  I‚Äôm very pro druids, and I want to see them succeed whenever they can.  However, it‚Äôs just a fact that warriors win by fair comparison.
---
There are good reasons to have a feral (faster gearing, flexibility to DPS, LotP, etc).  You can succeed with a feral in the raid.  You‚Äôd also be perfectly fine with all warrior tanks.
---
Lol sounds like he was mocking you with that final drop. I swear the programmers made the loot system spite players
---
I get what you are saying.  I guess I just miss the days when I saw a piece of gear and KNEW it was an upgrade without having to sim myself and three different gear swaps to figure out what's the best increase.
---
Haha thank you! The irony is great with OP‚Äôs pov.

---
Lol gotta stamp out the bugs before they force you out!
---
Hunter is OP for that gold making ability.  You can solo dungeons with your pet tanking.
---
Yeah, and one out of fourty players will be allowed to assume that role. A few hardcore minmaxers will fill in the feral spot in the non-garbage guilds on each server while the other people who wanted to play feral will either have to respec or give up on raiding.
---
Another you are playing the game wrong post... 
---
If you don't like min/maxing don't do it and ignore posts talking about min/maxing, it's that simple.
---
Speaking from experience, at first glance classic seems like it would be boring, the whole "been there done that" thing, but then i got bored during one of the lulls in legion and gave a private server a try... by the end of the day i had forgotten all about legion and spent the next few months playing vanilla, it really was like coming home again.  
---
I quit of course the moment they announced classic, but i would say to at least give it a try, who knows? you might be pleasantly surprised.
---
I had hoped they would make some balance changes before launch. Instead now it just means half my friends have no interest in playing Classic, which means I am much less interested in playing again.
---
&gt; having several k more HP than a warrior 
---
I am sorry...WHAT? In pre-BiS gear? Several k more HP? 
---
Please show me a Druid in pre-BiS, in Bear form, that have SEVERAL k HP more than a pre-BiS Warrior. Unless your pre-BiS Druid is pre-BiS Naxx and the Warrior is pre-BiS MC.
---
The thing is... we don‚Äôt *need* to do that in classic. If you run with someone crappy, DON‚ÄôT RUN WITH THEM AGAIN! It‚Äôs really that easy. There‚Äôs a finite number of players on your realm. There‚Äôs no LFG system, no ‚Äúbattlegroups‚Äù.

There's always that one trouble maker

I always enjoyed WPVP on PVE servers. 
---
Meaning you flag yourself. It's always tense when you are flagged and 2 or more enemies roll up on you but they are not flagged. Are they about to attack? Once they do it's on. 
---
Maybe you have some rogue/druid friends with you that are not flagged, and you are the bait.  
---
Then on days when you just feel like doing a quest you are not flagged. It's nice to have that control.
---
Bamboo TP to save the trees and bees üåé
---
Really the only thing you Need to know so you don‚Äôt invest 240+ hours into a class before you decide that you don‚Äôt want to play it is, 
---
If a class can heal it will be expected to heal at 60.
---
Yes you can. Warlocks can summon with two partners. Most competent guilds on PVP servers will fund one of their warlocks to get to the raid early to summon people if necessary.
---
Not so much ported as completely rewritten from the ground up.
---
You don't lose anywhere near 30% lol, its 4.8%: https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/wiki/Crit-aura-suppression
---
I have no idea where you got 30% from.
---
Even crit loss of 4.8% doesn't help prot warriors because of how far ahead druids are - and prot warriors are still relying on crit for a good chunk of their threat with shield slam. In fact, without very good gear impale prot will likely be less threat than deep prot with 5/5 cruelty in classic because of the crit suppression.
---
I also don't believe you need to be that dedicated to make feral tanks work - apart from 30 mins of crowd pummeler farming every week druids level and farm consumes quicker than warriors, and its not like any guild that isn't ultra casual will accept a lazy casual warrior tank. You also don't need any pvp gear to do well - its a nice bonus but nothing that will make or break threat/survivability.
---
Finally, during progression survivability is not more important than threat as long as you have a base level that will stop you from dying in 2 hits, which druids have. Progression is precisely when having shorter fights is most important, because if a fight drags on in progression your healers will struggle to keep everyone alive. Do you want a prot warrior in full mitigation gear with 440 defense to be tanking Vael, or Fankriss? Of course not, in full mitigation gear their threat is garbage and will have all your fury warriors holding back and the fight lengthened until many more people die than would be necessary with better threat.
---
I know right ?
---
Also, I find it interesting how without ANY gear, SPriest and Ele Shaman have the highest base dps.
---
Lol there are a lot of posts here of peoples bad experience with hunters. But it seems almost as many are hunters are admitting a time they messed up and it generally seems understandable.
---
*Alakazham* my friend! It and thottbot were the only real WoW resources back then.
---
You can‚Äôt. And if you want to get rank 14 I suggest you to not be a dick. Rank 14 isn‚Äôt just about skill or premades, but also about politics. If the top rankers on the server don‚Äôt like you because you‚Äôre known as the server douchebag, you won‚Äôt get rank 14.
---
Green, it was the Robes of Servitude from the warlock quest. I needed it badly when I got it and it was hard to replace apparently.
---
Like many others I sucked at the game back then. I thought Dreadmist was the best/easier upgrade outside the raids ;D
---
https://www.wowhead.com/item=20530/robes-of-servitude
---
Double stealth, druid offheals, druid added dmg, poison dispel. This combo was god-tier in 2v2 Arena in TBC, I'm sure it was strong in Vanilla as well.
---
That's the problem
---
Playing what you enjoy to the best of your ability.

It would be nice if there was more transparency in the math and more flexibility in the talents. As it stands now, I have no way of knowing if this is at all correct or relevant to me at all.

I think it will be stable.  Layering the world will help the crowding as well.  First 24 hours I hope to be level 20 and slaying it in the barrens and have cleared RFC.  Solo play for questing, but will group with friends for dungeons.

That's not true. Brackets are based on % of people who get at least 15hk for the week. If the pool is small enough rank14 might not even be attainable

‚ÄúBACK UP IN YOUR ASS WITH THE RESURRECTION!‚Äù
---
As someone already said, there is always raids open for all specs. Some guilds have a hard timing finding people so 40 people with a ret Paladin flasked, buffed and ready is better then 39.
---
This happens in every game ever. We min/max we research we know whats good we know what works, it comes with knowledge of the game in question.

I mean i can say the exact same thing as you for everyblizzard game ever made.

Barely anyone wants to play feral anyway really, druids are the least played class and by far the majority of them play resto.

All itemization is as it was in 1.12.  Some of it will be content gated, but once it's available it will be in it's 1.12 state.
---
Subtlety. It's a Rogue spec.
---
It is very easy to spot a good hunter it even easier to spot a bad hunter.  Most hunters are bad.
---
Always keep extra ammo, always bring food, only have your pet out during boss fights in dungeons(with taunt disabled),  learn how to properly trap and kite.  Engineering is manditory for hunters.
---
Orange flavour? You getting your salad tossed while you play?
---
Think there are many more significant changes that came through that was the _downside and destroying_ of wow. 
---
But I see your point
---
idk what your examples are, maybe you saw some truely toxic behavior.
---
however telling a person they wont be able to tank much as a paladin is not toxic.
---
Telling someone that they wont top the damage meters as enhancement shaman isnt toxic
---
telling people that there is a better consumable or enchant they can use isnt toxic
---
telling people to use a dang enchant and consumable isnt toxic
---
Classic is great, these people "rushing" to 60 still have at least 100 hours of gameplay to enjoy. With classic being so great they will likely come acorss all of these great things that people are so worried that they miss.
---
I think a better route would be to suggest everyone make alts once they reach 60. Alts literally fix all the problems that most people seem to think the speed levelers will have. Id say more than half the people who want to get to 60 in the first week its for server presence purposes, not because they think 1 to 60 is bad.
---
Id like to take my time but i remember how great it was to be some body on a server and id like to make my mark again, but being 60 quickly increases my presence and reach
---

People abusing it to use herb/mining nodes multiple times imo.
---
Naxx isn't mechanically hard (by modern standards) . It's incredibly time consuming both to get to the point where you're doing Naxx and to prep for it. The vast majority of casuals will never see a single boss kill there, much less actually get any loot.
---
If you eat a lot of greasy food and chug energy drinks you can probably get your resting heart rate up to 120+ BPM.  That'll bring Classic that much closer that much faster.
---
for 1. I did not know all specs have these buffs, good to know! Aren't druid heals less viable than the rest of the heals? But if they're still better than the rest it doesn't matter I guess. 
---
for 2. Why is that? In current Raids DoT Classes are always great in fights with adds.
---
Oh man a glorious tale! I'm glad that guy got a taste of their own medicine.
---
&gt; But you‚Äôre still not raiding as a ret Paladin, sorry. Wow is a team game and letting down 39 other people because you want to loot Ashkandi on a Ret pally is selfish and will lead to resentment.
---
There is a proper way to do some serious damage as a ret, however ashkandi is not one of them.
---
Use one of the 6-8 mages for that!
---
The pool on a pve server is smaller because of less interested people and no world PvP.
---
But a smaller pool doesn't mean less competition.
---
I'd rather compete with 200 people for 15  top bracket spots than computer with 40 people for 1 spot

I do hope TBC is released after classic. And I do hope we don't get any character transfer. All new. Let it be its own thing, start over.

Ooh this is probably one of the tougher ‚Äúwhich class‚Äù questions. If you‚Äôre making the alt on the same account, you should choose hunter. 
---
If I‚Äôm not mistaken, if you want to port your main using your own mage alt, you run into issues if the mage is on the same acct, as you can‚Äôt log into them simultaneously.

Yeah dude, they are freaking out way too much about min-max. Human racials are the worst for pvp out of like all 8 races. Perception is nice for human rogue, to detect other rogues/druids, so they can ninja a flag and always get the opener against rogues.
---
If you are competing for speed clears to boost that ego, then yeah human is definitely the best. Gnome is definitely best for warrior pvp, but many people just cant play a gnome.

1. In Classic WoW, all specs have access to most class abilities.  Talents merely push you in one way or another.  For example, in retail WoW, a Mage will have most of the arcane, frost, and fire attacks.  They simply get bonuses to fire or frost attacks in those trees, which is why a Fire mage will use Fire attacks.  There are a few abilities which are unique to each tree.
---
2.  For a couple reasons.  First, most trash mobs die so fast that DoTs are a waste of mana and cast time.  Second, debuff limits.
---
Sounds like a shitty guild
---
When did it change?
---

Go dwarf. Better pvp racials against rogue and dwarves are just a joy to be around.
---
Plus, alliance is going to have way too many lady boys. So the more men choosing to play as men, the better.
---
Bear tanking is super fun if you love mashing Maul over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over
---
Lol what.
---
How do they have the best gear if the raid just opened? Makes no sense....
---
A Quest Addon, Cartographer, Extended Quest Log 3, Aux, Auctioneer Suite (includes vendor prices, enchantrix, etc), LazyPig (or replacement), Debuff/Buff/Cooldown timers, Postal (or equivalent), Bagnon, Prat (or equivalent), Census+, and Swatter (or equivalent) 
---
I'll add a bar addon and UI addon later when I get deeper into the levels, but the ones above are almost mandatory.
---
There's no way to add ZG enchants? They add +hit and +damage for casters.

I think the problem, besides the bad reputation Druids have is, that a lot of people think, that Druid is the perfect class for casual players.
---
I'm big into min-maxing and I think the Druid has a lot of potential PvP and PvE wise in the hands of someone who wants to master the class.
---
There are a lot of reasons already mentioned here, why you should play Druid, but for me the biggest reason is that "WoW" effect, when people realize what a powerful Swiss-army-knife the Druid can be in the hands of an experienced player.
---
Yah called tbc bro

Sit and laugh at all the people complaining when they fail because their map doesnt tell them where to go is my plan on getting ahead. I play this game to enjoy it and that's going to be the best part.

In Vanilla Rogue specs that include Prep are predominately sub and thus are often referred to as "Sub" even though premed isn't usually taken.
---
Hemo/CB
---
Prep/Daggers
---
These are frequently referred to as "sub" in Vanilla.
---
stuff that isn't available in Vanilla from my mind. 
---
1. dual talent. (healing/tank class can have a break from this)
---
2. loot exchangeable within 2 hours
---
3. Tier set based on multiple classes
---
4. Tier set Variety (vanilla tier set for each class e.g. warrior t2 t3 are only defense, shaman,pally, druid, priest are only for heal)
---
Imagine on 25 man raid each boss drops 3-4 epic gears and the same amount for a 40 man raid. the grind for everyone will be increased almost 37%. couple month into the raid you'll find that everyone is going there to grind DPS items, while healer/tanking items are generally disenchanted. That was one of the reason why there is a saying Ashkandi, Greatsword of the Brotherhood will be brother no more. I was a guild/raid lead during such time, you have no idea how awful the experience of looting shit items that of no use. while half of your guildies are so disappointing because yet again none gets what they wanted.
---
Haha, yeah. That one really interested me, too. To be fair, there are a few kinks that need to be sorted out (that I know of).
---
1) I need to include base crit% from being lvl 60 of a certain race/class combo. These simulations currently account for 0 outside stat gains. Accounting for base crit would probably cause the other classes to rise relative to spriest, who doesn't gain much from crit.
---
2) There's a current bug with calculating channeled spells like mindflay. We assume the cast time is the full duration, regardless of if it hits or misses. This would actually result in a slight _increase_ in calculated spriest dps (due to leftover time to cast another spell) and also accounts for the current overemphasis on spriest spell hit priority.

Nobody is really arguing that. Most are just being realistic and noting that 99% of ferals won't be religiously ranking. And 75% won't be farming their Manual Crowd Pummeler quota for raids every week.
---
The raid prep required for ferals is much higher than warriors, so it takes that next level of hardcoreness to maintain. I welcome anyone that wants to put in the work, but it's not realistic for the vast majority of people.
---
Yes RotV is the pre-raid BiS beating out the Robe of Winter Night by 10 spell power.  The rest are BOE that really don't need you to have tailoring, and are pretty easy for random people in trade chat to pick up.  To me, the 10 spell power for the pre-raid BIS chest that takes up a profession I am not keen on is not worth the aggravation of leveling tailoring at the start.
---
There's nothing. It is stupid OP.   
---
It is like Naxx/AQ40 level class gear, but available as soon as you hit level 60.
---
lmfao, gotta cut the baddies out if you wanna be server best
---
Well I assume that everyone else is going to evacuate the starter areas to get exploration xp, do fedex quests, and group up to kill red mobs. That should leave me all alone in the starter areas to complete the starter quests uncontested.
---
Ahhhahahahah OP just got absolutely owned.
---
To OP: if you wanna play as a casual, play with other casuals. Let the min/maxers clear raids, while you do causal things.
---
Im sure you can play anything you want min/max or not. Yeah boom chickens suck but getting 40 people together to stick around is worst. Guilds will be hurting to fill spots.

It was a really popular bottling program, people would have it grind or fish for them when they were at school/work.

That's the internet.

Questions for Resto shamans, mainly as it pertains to pvp. I've played a Holy paladin for most my WoW career, and as my guild is going Horde for classic, R-Sham seems like a interesting proposition. PvP is important to me, and I've always played my HPal in a shockadin-support manor (mainly healing, while occasionally helping my DPSers with little bursts of damage). Are Resto shamans able to function in a similar manor? Will I have meaningful opportunities to throw in some damage between healing? Second, how leashed are shamans by their totems? I have this fear that I'll spend the whole time trying to stay within range or burning through my mana constantly redropping them to keep buffs on teammates who only run away. Is this be a serious concern?
---
Not recording footage after getting kt xbow
---
So basically DKP but you can get DKP through contributing to the guild in other ways.
---
I'm pretty sure there are already guilds that do this.
---
Is that mc pee pants? &gt;&lt;
---
In Germany it releases at midnight, so servers will be fine and zones won't be to crowded (or only crowded by non-casuals ^^)
---
Not you, but a ton of the feral cheerleaders seem to completely forget about shield block. It is essentially a broken skill in that it provides a MASSIVE damage reduction for a measly rage cost. No other class has anything that compares.
---
Without shield block, warriors would suck major ass. But they do have it, and it's part of why I love warrior tanking.
---
Blizzard's funny marketing joke : "WoW Classic is *free* **WITH** WoW retail sub" 
---
Sometimes, companies take us for fools (In the fact of Blizzard : always).
---
Pros:
---
- S tier leveling speed
---
- Top tier damage in MC through BWL.
---
- You get to actually use your raid set bonuses
---
- Strong in BGs, OP in open world PvP
---
- Essentially guaranteed to get your strong power spike weapon out of MC in a reasonable time.
---
- Engaging rotation
---
- Lots of utility and cool 'tricks' exclusive to hunters
---
- Very good gold farmer
---
- Best 'solo' class in the game
---
-Easy to play and get started, but has a very engaging and high skill ceiling allowing you to really get personal value and satisfaction out of mastering your class. 
---
Cons:
---
- Stigma surrounding hunters as the retard class is still fairly prevalent.
---
- People don't like you because you roll on their shit
---
- Highly overpopulated class in terms of the raid desirability to class overall population
---
- Damage falls off in AQ and Naxx mostly due to very poorly optimized range weapons to pick from after BWL and the fact your pet has no scaling. 
---
- May be weaker in PvP than private server version of hunters due to how melee leeway works.
---
Expectations:
---
You are going to have to prove to people you aren't missing 50% of your prefrontal cortex. People in pugs are going to expect the worse and try to convince you that the items you are rolling on are better suited for them; fuck em take that shit if it's an upgrade. 
---
Don't expect to afk spaming 1 button in raids. You're rotation has complications and nuances that other classes don't. You actually need to pay attention. Expect your feign death to get resisted occasionally, really pay attention to this. 
---
Expect to have a learning curve when it comes to properly controlling your pet. The AI is wonky and it's going to take some practice, but trust me it's worth it. Your pet even as MM is a significant portion of your damage.
---
As for your spec, you will be MM for raids. BM is a leveling spec
---
I would imagine, IDEALLY, channeled spells would want to be cast for their full duration.
---
Also I can see mana usage being an issue as well.  This goes back to talents too, as Mages have a few talents that reduce mana costs, or refund mana that makes their rotations pretty efficient compared to Balance Druids or Elemental Shaman (hence where some of their stigma comes from)
---
Maybe like strength to warrior bracers, or stam to chests for pvpers.  They do help, but since you don't have any rare recipes that means you won't be known as an enchanter, and will probably be the third or fourth person contacted when someone is looking for an enchant.  People will have to go to another person anyways to get the full set of enchants, so skipping you just makes life easier.
---
Yeah, DPS means talking about pve. There's no dps role in pvp. There's a burst damage role, and a damage prevention role, cc and healing. There's no tanks, and there's no DPS's.
---
For instance, that's why elementals are viable in pvp despite being shit dps. They have great burst, and damage prevention in various forms, including soft CC.
---
Trying to max out a dps meter will make you more likely to lose, not less.
---
Hunter.
---
If you get tired of your druid late in the game you can bring your hunter to raids. Once they get tranq shot from luci they're just as valuable in Naxx as any other hunter.
---
&gt; Putting a druid as tank 3 to absorb gear and allow an extra warrior to go DPS is an easy decision and there will be plenty of raids with druids in this position in classic. 
---
100% fully agree. It is a no brainer. You don't waste gear and you gain DPS by having a Feral OT.
---
&gt; It's when it comes to main tanking that the debates start. 
---
Again, I fully 100% agree. The problem is that this debate should not exist, because this debate started with private server Druid tank meta, which works in conditions that will NOT BE in Classic or are unknown in Classic.
---
This is what we know, for sure that will be in Classic and it is not on pservers :
---
\-14% parry in Classic vs 5.6% parry on pservers, for lvl 63 mobs.
---
\-6.5% dodge in Classic vs 5.6% dodge on pservers, for lvl 63 mobs.
---
\-6 hrs CD on Rallying Cry in Classic vs no CD on pservers.
---
\-an unknown critical aura reduction in Classic (estimates are 1/3rd loss in crit in Classic vs pservers). Classic player crit chance will be significantly lower, the higher the crit is outside the baseline.
---
\-unknown bosses armor values (Ragnaros armor value at the end on beta was not confirmed to be the real one. It's nothing but speculation). The armor values will be different, but we don't know which will have it higher. Still, Classic will have the CORRECT values.
---
\-unknown bosses resistances. The resistances values will be different, but again, we don't know which will be higher. Still, Classic will have the CORRECT values.
---
\-unknown glancing blow values in Classic. Still, Classic will have the CORRECT values.
---
\-unknown algorithms for multiple and different damage types, procs and crits. Still, Classic will have the CORRECT values.
---
Looking at much higher parry, a bit higher dodge, critical chance loss, Ralying Cry being or nor available for the raid, we can safely say that Druids will lose a BIG chunk of their threat, because of high parry and high loss on their crit chance, which is primordial for Maul, while Warrior tanks will be far less affected, because their threat is based mostly on skills, and not damage.
---
Adding up the unknown glancing blow values in Classic (which Druids will land more than Warriors) is another loss in threat for Druids compared to Warriors.
---
I consider that 14% vs 5.6% parry, the loss of crit, world buffs not available all the time, will put a huge dent in Druids threat in Classic, high enough to be similar with their threat in Vanilla...which was lower than Prot Warriors.
---
And Druid tanks without threat advantage over Prot Warriors, while taking much more damage than Prot Warriors, makes them highly unlikely to be a desirable tank over a Warrior.
---
Other people consider that 14% parry in Classic vs 5.6% parry on pservers is not a big deal. That the loss of 1/3rd of crit in Classic is, again, not a big deal. And the scarcity of world buffs in Classic is, again, not a big deal.
---
We will see, in like 6-7 weeks what the reality is.
---
They don't bother me at all. Different strokes I suppose.
---
This is completely inaccurate.   Bgs didn't kill world pvp in vanilla you can't kill world pvp in vanilla because the content requires you to go into the world.
---
Yes.
---
I like the idea of seeing some bones on undead, but I never got over the fact that a new piece of gear would drop, and it's almost like the undead would just hack it to pieces and put it on them.
---
A druid with aq40 gear blows warrior threat out of the water...
---
But when you're out of it you're free
---
I'm going to do my best to encourage noobs to try the spider wing. People have this mindset of "if you can't kill c'thun, you aren't allowed to enter Naxx". Everyone gets so caught up in full clearing the existing raid that they don't even try the next one.
---
Spider wing is easier than the last half of AQ40.
---
&gt; if you've ever studied language as I have. 
---
*tips fedora*
---
Just a heads up, you won‚Äôt be outgearing casual pve guilds, they will be farming the same raids as you every week.
---
Delaying is always a possibility for any game before they release. It could be 2 weeks from release and they could say "It is definitely coming out this day" and still delay it. It's just a reality of the gaming industry.
---
While I want the ranking system kept for the sake of Classic, I would like Blizzard to increase the number allowed in all ranks, or vastly reduce the weekly penalty (to maybe 3% instead of 20%), to allow more people to engage with Classic PvP.  Because as it is, I have zero desire to ever PvP other than World for fun.  I'm sure many other players feel the same.
---
race matters the least as far as min maxing. in a vacuum, yes some races pair better with certain classes, but you can overcome that with like 1 potion or better gear piece. if there is ever a situation where your racials are a dealbreaker for pve, there are other issues going on
---
/r/iamverysmart
---
No, you‚Äôre literally the only person in the world that is worried.
---
To be fair it's hard for them to know if you are going to dc for one minute or 20. So fair game to give it to next in line if you go offline.
---
* Rerolling to druid instead of staying with rogue or swapping to warrior.
---
We are doing a mix of council/dkp.
---
We decide on important items which class gets to roll first based on how important said item is for the classes or how long it will be BiS and then its rolled on with DKP. This was discussed with the whole guild. We went through every item.
---
Fatigue - Just keep to your google docs on who is allowed to roll on it.
---
Favoritism - No favoritism here except that there is an additional rule on who is allowed to roll based on attendence etc.
---
Corruption - Nonexistent since everything has been agreed on before the raid came out. If loot is distributed to someone else regardless just because they want to no loot system is able to stop that.
---
For the Alliance, were gonna rain death on you hairy boogers
---
I don't mind it. If you play PvE in vanilla for the engaging rotations then you're gonna be very disappointed no matter what class you play.
---
I was exaggerating slightly - you can get ~3.9k HP completely unbuffed in a good set of pre-raid gear as a prot warrior. In pre-raid gear in bear form, completely unbuffed I can get 5.4k HP. The difference tends to be larger with more gear, this is because for warriors 1 stam = 10 HP but for druids 1 stam = 12 HP with the Heart of the Wild talent.
---
No, you‚Äôre reading way too deep into a few words and making baseless arguments off it.
---
Classic will launch at 3PM PST August 26th and will have as smooth a launch as Legion did, which was near perfect. The logic for Layering will be very aggressive, meaning you‚Äôre unlikely to see even 100 players in your starting zone.
---
Exactly. Whether or not most people realize it, the r13-r14 cabals exist on every server. You play by the rules, or you don't get to rank up.
---
That buff doesn't justify giving up a raid spot.  Another mage would benefit the raid more so than the 3%  spell crit aura.
---
If you type fast enough some letters get lost for whatever reason
---
Also you kinda need to add support for enchants
---
&gt;I don't know why that stuck with me, it was like Infinity War circa 2006
---
So this is what Thanos did, he just shut-down hall of the server's connection to the game of life.
---
Short one liners or paragraphs you pull out of your ass.  About the same really
---
I leveled as some ungodly combination of holy/prot/ret paladin.  I vividly remember using nothing but a sword and shield combo until I got out of STV, so probably at least until level 40.    
---
I also made it all the way to BRD before I really learned how to heal.  I kept running out of mana, and the tank said "why aren't you using Flash of Light?"  I said "what are you talking about?"  It turns out I made it to, what, level 55 before realizing I had a healing spell other than Holy Light in my abilities book.  I think early on I must have just seen that it healed for less each cast and assumed it was worthless.  
---
Thankfully I learned, and was able to get into my first raiding guild after impressing one of their tanks by solo healing to save a 10 (or possibly 15, I can't remember) man Strat run after the other healer left.
---
it's possible, but it's unlikely.  most games get pushed out well b4 they're ready
---
100%.
---
LOL
---
It just depends how long you want the grind to take. Both examples you were given are accurate. You can casually pvp and hit rank 10 in 2-3 months, or you can grind for 5+ hours daily with a premade and finish in a few weeks.
---
&gt; This point goes contrary to what I've heard, I've been told during MC that druids are actually superior to warriors in threat and mitigation.
---
How could this even be true? You have Shaman flair and druids dont benefit from WF totem. How would they ever in any Horde world ever have better TPS? (They dont).
---
Come on bro, the guy has studied language. How could he possibly be wrong. 
---
/s
---
Did you switched on that death scene from The Matrix movie?
---
Yeah, all these ‚ÄúBGs killed wPVP‚Äù fearmongers have no fucking idea what they‚Äôre talking about.
---
Thanks, I'll look into it and I appreciate the feedback on prioritization for enchants.
---
Druids are missing over half the tools required to be main tanks. Niche off tank spec or gimp-your-raid main tank if you really want.
---
Cringe alert, proceed with caution.
---
It will most definitely be a show worth shitting, and I'm already looking forward to bathing in all the tears of crying kids.
---
What is a launch where you can actually play from second one? Right: a failure.
---
That's true too. Hell, a game will get delayed 5 times and still come out before it's ready.
---
Rank 1 shocks of all flavors should be your bars if pvp realm for the low mana utility they bring
---
Are you guys just trolling or is this actually how long you need to play to achieve this?
---
Allakhazam
---
Add it seperately. I for one would rather build something on my own and have everything set up the way i want it to look like instead of an interface telling me i can only move things around, change a few settings here and there but the overall look stays the same. You'd end up downloading a bunch of other addons anyways that don't fit the overall theme of ElvUI even when there exist a few ElvUI skins for some addons.. Some things just look very out of place if not done right.
---
Should be the top post. The more things like this are implemented the closer classic will be to retail.
---
Respectable?  More like Bullshit spewed from every orifice.
---
Im counting on it being a shit show. Im hoping that its over crowded, that the GMs abuse the F out of their power and destroy trolls and ass hats. Im expecting the servers to die every 30 minutes to to stress. I kind of want this to happen, you only get to live the launch shit show once before they get it stable. Wouldnt miss this for the world.
---
My understanding that #2 is answered that Blizzard doesnt think it will be a significant earns sector for them. They think that it will get a big hype surge in the beginning and then die off and become a ghost town and thus not generate a lot of revenue.
---
How did a city raid work on a PvE server did you just waltz into the enemy town waving at all the people sitting at the bank or did like killing a guard flag you for pvp?
---
Woah....
---
I was wondering about this. is life tap + heals good?
---
good call, more windfury procs=more flurry.  Already got all the shock rank 1's bound, thanks
---
They didn't like that I was considering keeping it, I guess. They were awesome in the beginning, but as the guild grew it went to their head.
---
The norm for blizzard launch days is "shitshow" so I don't expect anything more. I haven't put in for any time off, and don't really plan on playing much until that weekend (labor day weekend) That being said, I expected "classic summer" to be around, well, NOW, not in September, so I would actually be surprised if they pushed the date back longer.
---
Looks nice but you still got the react favicon ;)
---
You didn‚Äôt have it on group loot?
---
If you use the q and e keys to strafe then you are robbing yourself of two very accessible keybinds that are better used for abilities.
---
Its for my hunter alts off spec.
---
I was on the druid guardian train, until I read they only use maul and swipe for 10 minutes of fighting.  I just don't know if I have it in me to play a tank with two skills, zero cool downs, and any gear I obtain is not visible during the fights, and consequently most of the raid night.
---
More into feral. HotW is kinda important for both tanking and gives a really nice buff for healing. Deep resto really isn't crucial for raid heals. Swiftmend is mana inefficient, you're not really casting Regrowth much, so really if you just get down to Reflection in Resto you can kinda get by. Imp Rejuv is also good if you're the dedicated rejuver in the raid. The struggle is giving up Natural Weapons from Balance which hurts your threat.
---
memes are the only thing kids are good at these days
---
Everyone is missing the point here. If they stop the rest of us (use your head, they don't care about streamers, it's a red herring) from *wanting* to play on their server, there won't be anybody to compete with and they're all but guaranteed world first ANYTHING. It's actually a very clever scheme used by dictatorships the world over.
---
So perhaps everyone should play on their servers and then they would have to actually work for their world firsts.
---
I played a hunter in vanilla and oh boy was I bad lol. So naturally I was a clicker and keyboard turner. I didn't train freezing trap until a very high level because "it did no damage ". I tried to not buy a mount since I had cheetah, someone talked me down from that ledge. It was akward in a raid when I was told to use distracting shot, aka taunt shot, and I hadn't trained it. I got better while playing at 60 and managed to get the hunter class quest bow/staff
---
Never give your account info to another player.
---
You can pair it with mining, arcane crystals sell for 15-25g a pop and have ~15-20% drop per thorium node. You can level with skinning/mining, once you get your devilsaur set drop skinning and powerlevel engineering.
---
i dont see it as boomkin or resto. While i dont plan on stacking feral or moonkin, i dont plan on turning them away, unless they are actually bad..
---
Playing a meme spec does not excuse poor performance.
---
this was also my mentality. pulling ahead of the pack is just pure will power to stay up as long as possible. once people start getting off, you're naturally ahead.
---
I've been stockpiling insulin for weeks of sugar-fuelled diabetic ultra-gaming resulting in an eventual coma and death.
---
I played a warrior, first char, god it was painful and fun challenge.
---
Refused to raid because I was anxious about my gear. Had a guild that wanted to take me through zg and mc, I said to em I don't know if my gear is good enough and it never went further than that.
---
 Wish I applied myself. 
---
Made a horde warr with friends and got him to rank 10 before he hit 60. That was many many bgs and slowed leveling massively but it was good fun. 
---
This round, not gonna make a warrior for solo play
---
I wish I could upvote this 100000 times
---
Taunts have nothing to do with chance to hit mate.
---
You don‚Äôt want to miss swings, as they build some aggro but most importantly give you rage for threat generating abilities.
---
It's the authentic vanilla experience.
---
People like to throw out the "bears are superior in these very specific scenarios" thing, and they're not wrong, but I don't find it all that useful either.
---
Most people aren't that great at adapting to change. Generally, the key to success is consistency. So swapping out the main tank for every third fight just doesn't make sense. Most guilds will be far better off learning and adapting with a single consistent main tank leading the fights. Like you said, warriors can tank every single encounter, so why screw with what works?

I'm not quite ready to give a technical outline for melee yet because I haven't thought about it enough. I suspect I can still use the base concept of sequencing probabilities together, even for certain affects that are mutually dependent (i.e. white hits -&gt; more rage -&gt; more yellows -&gt; proc flurry -&gt; more white hits).
---
See my post on [How much do I lifetap?](https://pikach.us/posts/2019-07-16-Lifetap.html) for a similar analysis if you're interested.
---
It's the absolute worst. NO ONE ELSE PLAY IT. Thanks.
---
Good advice, cheers thanks man.  Super excited!  I have so many great memories from classic and met some great people simply questing outside instances.   When I recently retried WoW it all felt like this whole big rush to level to next level cap followed by rush gear level and then standing around in capitol city and getting ported to instances.   Want to give classic a try to see how much it changes how people play ... hoping to see some of the same people interactions that I call from back then.  Could be those times are totally gone ... who knows.
---
Why would they test layers with thousands of people and then only fill them with a couple hundred?? 
---
They also stated that "layers will be about the size of a vanilla realm"
---
Also not to pre-renew, can pull healer agro before you even get a chance to get situated.
---
Smart man. Im rolling a warrior
---
engi does i believe
---
Why did you post this?
---
Best race for horde priest pvp healing in high level premades? Troll or Undead?
---
The reason it doesn't suppress 30% of your crit because no matter if you have 8-9% crit or 25%+ crit it still on average takes away 4.8% +- 0.17% of your crit. It's not based on how much you have. Of course if you have 16% crit then 4.8% taken off that means you lose 30%, but it doesn't really make sense to look at it that way when its a flat deduction.
---
Fair enough man! I'm eager to see where this goes and wish you the best. :)
---
Evidence of lower tos on feral?
---
Sorry, his lack of punctuation made me misread it.
---
With standard DKP you know where the points come from, one of the other mages is not out of the blue going to have X more DKP then you, if you have been doing the same raids.
---
With multiple other sources to gain DKP there is no way to know how the other players got their DKP.
---
The Blackrock Slicer didn't exist in 1.12, but will be in.
---
Was 1000g for about $35USD in late 2005. Prices weren't terrible, actually.
---
1.  They are great in PvP and do good damage until very end game where they fall off a bit.
---
2. Almost all classes have reagents to manage.  Pet stuff is a fun little "sub game" for hunters.
---
3. We have good raid utility in tranq, pulling, CC, and kiting.
---
4. Rexxar.
---
I just hear alot about weapon bonuses from say humans to gnomes or vice versa
---
Aight, calm down there
---
That‚Äôs it, it‚Äôs decided.
---
That's the glimmering mithril insignia from the armorsmithing questline, but it is a 30 second duration with a long cooldown. Useful for sure, but doesn't fix the issue with bears and boss fear mechanics.
---
Did you not get invited to a raid or something?
---
We used to call that ‚Äúgetting Boulderfisted‚Äù
---
nah youre right, its gonna be awesome. Retail is trash and doesn't require any cooperation. Classic will play very close to how it did back in the day
---
Got rank 10 right before the lvl 60 set came out but didn't regrind from r8 to get significantly better gear. 
---
And the lvl 58 rogue set was garbage, too.
---
I'm generally of the leave well enough alone crowd, it's just a game we all love kind of mentality... but if the entire guild is gonna bitch someone out for trying to help during a raid that's wiping? Nah, that's whack. Like, if you're churning through the instance, that's one thing, but if you're mid wipe, why not listen to some advice?
---
Seriously? Because it‚Äôs a stress test. Emphasis on the word stress.
---
Eventually yes, layers will be the size of a realm. But if you think they will only start with one layer and assign people to it until it‚Äôs full, that‚Äôs not likely. Probably they‚Äôll start with multiple and randomly assign people during launch to help stability.
---
This is fake news. 
---
playing hunter is not fun and will most likely ruin your life
---
You are correct Horde side. Windfury changes everything, and warrior threat is undoubtedly superior.
---
Alliance side though, the threat argument is more valid. Bears are far more competitive.
---
Appropriation to class lore and casting/attack stance

So i must have gotten it later, but still can check on it.
---
Might not be a grudge, but I've never forgotten about this and I am still salty. So yeah, I guess it is a grudge.
---
The first instance I ever ran was with a few friends in 2006. Shadowfang keep. I was a warlock. Robes of Arugal or whatever it's called dropped. I was so sure I was going to win the roll, and of course I didn't.
---
I'm so salty that I didn't win the roll that I've never forgotten that moment. Not mad at the person that did win, and in fact I don't even remember who won, just irritated that I didn't win my first big roll in the game.
---
The upside to this, I'm very grateful that that happened. It has caused me to remember that moment forever. If I had won the roll, I probably would not have ever remembered what my first dungeon run was. Silver lining.
---
I won't lie, it was sarcasm. Hunters were pretty great albeit "meh" scaling past Tier 2 gear compared to others. I just wanted to be the only hunter so I can has all the loot :3
---
So much this, everybody who is saying that an off spec is better than an empty slot is missing this point. Off specs can be a cause of resentment and loot drama. Holy priests would still like that sash of whispered secrets and resto shaman still want those deep earth spaulders, why does the offspec bringing less value to the raid get prio? People like to say that since you can clear the raid with empty slots why not bring an extra off-spec player. The better question is: if we can clear the raid with empty slots, why would we bring an offspec player whose there to soak loot from the healers who want it and the dps who scale better with it?
---
To inform

You joke, but this type of bullshit is what forced me off of the strip and into the arms of old Vegas.

And I couldn't recommend those places enough! Nickel roulette with a beer cooler in the middle so you didn't have to wait on cocktail waitresses was the fucking best.
---
Wrong sub
---
Thank you for the passive-aggressive response, here are my answers to your list of questions.
---
1 - Hillsbrad battles were never a daily occurrence anyway. On my server, and others that have stated in these replies, the battles came maybe a couple of times a month and continued until BC.
---
2 - The massive flocks of both horde and alliance participating did it for fun, which is apparently a shock to you - people occasionally do things just for fun! It was a welcome break from BG farming. Also, the battles were held away from towns usually, and most players weren‚Äôt in groups, so little to no DHK‚Äôs. 
---
3 - Yes, I can find forum posts backing my claim. You‚Äôre on the post right now. Multiple people have now told you these battles continued. That is just as reliable as your own sources (which are also just people claiming things on forums.) 
---
4 - There were normally two reasons why the battles began. The main being that a horde player Leveling in the area would be yanked, and ask for help - this in turn would cause both sides to continuously ask for help, resulting in the battles. The second lesser way these battles began was that they were organised on server forums.
---
5 - I played Vanilla from 14-18, my memory is fine. How old were you? Because it seems it was your memory that is clouded by naivety. 
---
Also, didn‚Äôt you claim you play PvE servers? So, you don‚Äôt even know this first hand? You‚Äôre just going from forum posts? Great üëç
---
No stat bonus from professions.
---
Engineering is great, mainly for pvp.
---
Blacksmithing gives a trinket with 30 seconds (I think) fear immunity.
---
Tailoring have some BoP crafted robes and the ZG tailoring set requires tailoring for set bonus.
---
Enchanting gives a druid tanking trinket.
---
Probably a few more things but I forgot.

People would kind of have to self moderate in a way until API comes out. If you see someone with a different discord name than their character you‚Äôd have to check the ninja looter list or material thief list. I agree it‚Äôs faster to find someone in general/trade, but it could be good to find those people not your zone
---
about as strong as a boomkin in raid
---
Some hero-complex paladin and his warrior friend killed me when i was doing the tanaris chicken quest so they could start it early, so I made it my goal that evening to make sure they would never complete it. I waited until they were near the turtle beach and the bandit camp and then killed the chicken twice before they seemed to give up
---
Lowkey this is my plan. I‚Äôll play the first 3 days only a few hours each day due to work. I requested that Thursday and Friday off so those are my all day and night gaming time. While most people are working, I‚Äôll be online from morning to night.
---
New content same philosophy
---
Lets put it this way an arms warrior is a jock in highschool 
---
while the hunter is the computer nerd
---
So here's the thing.  Most people don't remember Classic.  I'm willing to bet you don't have all the facts either.  So what we do have is private server data, be it, much of the details could have gotten wrong in the replication, and we know of some that have been wrong.
---
But, people didn't absolutely min max to the level people have been on private servers with Druids on real Classic.  And we can't use data from real classic because, the footage is from people who didn't understand the new min/maxing methods that were discovered in private servers.
---
Whether they are using private server data is irrelevant to the principal behind it.  We know more now than we did during vanilla.  I'm not going to make the claims that for sure Druids generate more threat.  I guess we'll have to see when it launches.
---
It existed as The Nicker.
---
idk, tried to google friend but just gave 0 results
---
Lost all my faith in DKP when one of our Warrior off tanks hoarded all his points since TBC launch refusing even the cheapest upgrades to snag a Warglaive. And because he then had one, when the other dropped he got the second. Still angry on behalf of the gulids Rogues.
---
Certain bosses need to be taunted mid fight, and taunt is a spell that can miss so the hit is very strong
---
You are only near the armor cap when you get crit healed by someone with inspiration.  Not up 100%.  Certainly not on alliance.
---
13 here. There are dozens of us. Dozens!
---
Don't need tailoring to wear it and the cost is about 50-100g depending on server. Mats can be farmed prety easily too.
---
I also prefer this type of setup rather than a total overhaul. Would give you gold if I could, thank you :)
---
Perfect timing
---
Now this is dedication
---
Oh shit how can you fucking fail this much at basic maths...
---
Genuinely curious, have they been posting all the big fixes post-beta? Because I would assume they are just going to work on them and if anything announce what was fixed at launch.
---
Thanks. I was dead set on a Warrior but increasingly leaning Ele Shaman. Watching Cdew videos influences that as well obviously.
---
This made me laugh way more than anything should have. Well done.
---
Was this suppose to be a funny post? Did you used to play Hunter?
---
Be friendly ask questions ignore assholes.
---
OOOOH got it. I just looked it up, it's a channeled thing.
---
i love when people refer to that dead sub. Clearly he wants actual responses
---
&gt; bind on equip = tradeable, bind on pickup = soulbound
---
Not exactly. Only soulbound = untradable. BoE becomes soulbound when equipped, and BoP is soulbound immediately on pickup.
---
Black Lotus is neither BoE nor BoP as it never becomes soulbound.
---
Get your gold farming route ready since that‚Äôll be some juicy respec costs. But that is the best part of Druid after all, so own it.
---
yeah they are decent, but nothing that cant be made up/surpassed with gear or consumables
---
Fake news... This is a shitpost and OP is a douchebag trying to get everyone spun up... Classic troll post, just ignore it...
---
read the comments, i hope you catch on.
---
launch night literally just level 3/4 to have a short experience.  the following day &amp; week will be waking up early (6am to hopefully avoid neckbeards), playing all day with gym in the afternoon and sleep at a normal time.  goal is to maintain a healthy sleeping schedule and body so when I go back to work on tues the following week I'm not dead irl
---
&gt;  most of it is not even bind-on-pickup.
---
ehhhhh. Depends on the class.
---
usually i move items in my bag to make sure
---
No, just wish I coulda been a better guildmate. But then again, back then the guild was like 60-70 people to sustain 40 man raiding so it was a bit more difficult.
---
Yeah was bad formulated by me. Ofc you cant say that decay is 200k at rank 13. What i was trying to say is that the only restriction that blizzard made is the decay. You can get 13000 rp by playing 4h a day or 15h a day, it all depends on the competition.

A parody montage of one of the first quest you do in the orc starting zone my lifetime wow bro made way back
---
majority of the the nochanges crowd are just memeing to feel like they're apart of a group.
---
in reality most of them don't give a damn or have a coherent reason for wanting what they want.
---
Got off from the 27th to the 4th of Sept.  Had the days to burn so why not.  Not to often I take days off for launching of games.  Can't wait.
---
Who'd've thought having 10% spell hit would be a massive advantage lol
---
Ah, an uneducated shit opinion. Got it, thanks!
---
As someone who leveled 3 hunters to 60 on private servers, I can confirm this. If you're a solo player or don't have a guild, don't roll Hunter, dont make the same mistake I did 3 times.
---
First of all, people wont invite you to 5mans, everyone sees Hunters as retards, even if you're a good player, they wont give you the chance to prove that you're capable of not fucking their runs, they'll always prefer a Mage/Warlock over you, most of the time you'll have to create ur own groups, and even by making ur own groups, most people wont join because its a "Huntard" advertising.
---
Also, forget about raiding past MC, most guilds run 2 Hunters max and all spots are taken, not to mention guilds that force you to spam wingclip with Nightfall from MC to Naxx, ur only chance is MC pugs which is a wipefest and you'll be competing with all the benched/left behind Hunters, PvP premades also run 1 Hunter max so forget about that.
---
Yep, I quit all Hunters I did on private  servers because I couldnt do anything on endgame.
---
Tl;dr: Hunters are only good if you have another main character and you want to farm gold on maraudon/diremaul, don't roll one, you'll regret it. Choose between Mage/Warlock/Rogue, these are the 3 classes that are top of the food chain.
---
Ah that explains it then, very cool site btw love tools like this.
---
Because of this post I'm only making hunters from here on out. Drizzt&gt;Legolas
---
I would never stoop to the level needed to actually pick hunter as a class and I am offended you actually think im the type of person who would pick hunter as my class
---
Ok
---
Back in classic I was Healer for my friends group, moonkin for my raid and feral for myself.
---
I was soo long on 50G respecc cost, I believed it was the standart.
---
To be blunt, I don‚Äôt really care of that sub is dead. We don‚Äôt need more of these posts here, there are multiple per day.
---
He could‚Äôve just searched but he was too lazy to do that too.
---
Thanks!
---
When you're starting and you're squishy and your dps are in blues and not doing that much damage you won't need as much hit, you'll have plenty of rage and threat will not be an issue.
---
When you gear up and you stop being squishy and your dps start having threat troubles you can stay looking into some threat gear options
---
Figure out what your groups looting system is (loot on boes, loot on offspec).
---
Can you name a single class/spec that has more than one BIS BoP item from professions?
---
Haha going to cover them in dust! I've been debating taking time off myself but I'm afraid if I take a week I might never go back lol.
---
Combat swords is good throughout all tiers. It‚Äôs also piss easy like most dps specs.
---
Robe of Volatile Power is pretty good too, but more of a PvP chest. Also everybody and their mom will want it, so you are up against 5-7 mages and 4-5 warlocks to acquire it.
---
"Fix"
---
Layering was put in to appease the retail plebs who have 0 patience and want everything instantly. It effectively ruins the classic experience.
---
If it feels fun, do it. That goes for everything. You only get to experience Classic for the first time, once. So take a break from leveling to try out pvp, or professions, or even just mindless exploring with friends. 
---
The game is 100% what you make it and that's a big reason that it's so loved.
---
I mean, this gets posted here all of the time to ‚Äúgenerate discussion.‚Äù People are tired of the spam.
---
You mean some of the gear they have is bid, not all.
---
He may mean 7% hit. Since the Aged Core Gloves give +5 to daggers, thus removing the first 1% hit ignored from the boss no longer having over 10 defense over your weapon skill and the +5 weapon skill just giving you another 1% hit.
---
Absolutely TBC classic is fine but don't add it onto vanilla classic, make people level to 70, keep them separate.
---
This robe is in phase 3.
---
Hit is also one of your better mitigation stats considering parry-haste mechanics.
---
Full resto shaman is not very strong in organized PVP as talents after Natural Swiftness don't add much to your survivability. However, ele/resto is a pretty versatile and fun spec and could be played as you described your prefered playstyle. But consider that your role is more of a supporter than a healer (compared to paladins), so most times you will find yourself purging, denying cc with grounding/tremor/venom remove totem and waiting for someone to overextend to burst him down. All totems besides windfury are situational and utilizing them well depends more on your own positioning than on the positioning of your teammates. 
---
If you really like healing and play somewhat competitive than I would go for priest. They too can be played offensive if necessary. If you watch this movie of a pserver priest (maybe not representative if you play casual) you may find that the playstyle is pretty close to the one you described:  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=HNJFW7qkMlM
---
Yeah, fuck those people who just want to play the game, amirite? Having to sit in a 2 hour queue is the best part of the game! I love not being able to play.
---
Look at it this way. Let's just say there are 10 Black Lotus nodes on the map. The original servers were setup for 3000 players. If there are 4 layers on a server to be able to hold 12000 players, there are now 40 nodes. The ration of available resources to players is still the same. Yes, there are more nodes, but there are also more people to buy them. Layering is not going to damage the economy the way you think it is. Maybe you are thinking about pservers where there are 12000 people competing over 10 nodes not comparing to 12000 people competing over 40.
---
[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34CZjsEI1yU) song for race choice. Class - I never played healer before, so I will try priest this time.
---
Did you ever go to physical therapy? And did it help?
---
What's a moonkin? Are they like Oomkins?
---
That was 7 years ago and by a much more incompetent team. We‚Äôve had four WoW expansions and numerous content patches since then.
---
Now your speaking like a true rogue. Lol
---
they took it away, so they can rework it.  maybe it'll be back in time for classic.
---
Keep this filthy program out of classic please.
---
Late to reply to this, but I'm with ya. I'm certain competition will be fierce and I'm not about to bust my ass for a mediocre quest with mediocre rewards that will keep me in the area for another few hours longer (potentially) than if I just skipped it and ground the gnolls instead.
---
4 people eat 4 portions. Hard to make meals in advance. 1 person eat 1 portion. Easy to make meals in advance. Less time.
---
Yeah, I've recruited one total WoW noob into the game and trying to convince an old friend I played with back in the day to also start up again.
---
I honestly don't think the pattern is hard to get (5% drop rate in LBRS) nor do I think farming the mats to craft are difficult. 
---
My advise would to still be a Miner/Tailor at 60 and grind out the pattern/mats, craft the robes, then drop Tailoring for Eng, this is basically my plan. The robes are BiS for too long not to get them.
---
&gt;REAL vanilla fans!!!

I refuse to believe D3 was released 7 years ago, and no amount of evidence will change my mind.

We used offgamers and i know atleast 10 more people who used it.

now THAT is the level of cringe i hoped for. Well done lol

Another great MadSeason video. Jk, I would love to see Plat and Madseason do monotone rap battle.

Doesn‚Äôt holding right mouse button lock view and then A and D strafe?

Thanks for the kind words. I'm definitely planning on adding buff support -- stay tuned :)

---
Very cringy edits. Terrible music. Bad fights.
---
I called it trashcan because I knew how bad the fights were and I always wanted to make one that was actually decent. Never did obviously.
---
At least I wasn't clicking and UI was alright considering what people were using at the time I guess. Other than that, it's pure cringe when I watch it.
---
I think most of you are missing the point. Building  a community and making more subs. I dont think that perks such as mounts or whatever should alter classic play in any way...but it could help those that play retail by allowing them perks and playing both.
---
Jesus that is horrifying with launch so soon.
---
Bears are superior in every fight that doesn't require shield wall or fear break. Threat is more important than mitigation.  The top guilds will be using druid for farm content to push max threat.
---
Ah, didnt know that. Can one see the implementation of items somewhere?
---
I hope so. No way in hell I'm farming my ass off just so I can raid. I didn't 14 years ago and I won't now.
---
I used to have really bad internet and I began to HATE that music.
---
holy shit i remember watching this
---
Just play the game, do not overthink. And if you notice that something is not fun, ask for advice. But always try your way first.
---
Yep you are right
---
I feel like the horde are closer to good guys than the alliance. Like undead might be messed up but orcs, tauren, and trolls are just trying to find a home, right? but the alliance declines that right.
---
I still plan on going alliance for now though... part of it is nostalgia, but the cities are just better. also the tavern music
---
Easiest to level. People will always play hunters for that reason.
---
Everything is a hunter weapon!
---
One thing of note to be aware of is that if you go from Tirisfal Glade to Silverpine Forest you should pick up Sword training in undercity as soon as you have 10s to spare as most of the rewards in the undead starting zones tend to be swords which Orc's cannot naturally use.
---
So that +5 is double dipping? Removing the deference and adding +1%?
---
It has my bum hole puckering I can't lie
---
That's a private server though, not vanilla.
---
idk if you are talking about me or the OP but you dont get it, its a joke. He wants to be the only hunter
---
If you want to go for Pom frost spec, wouldn't it be better to go further down arcane tree and get AP aswell? You can get even bigger burst.
---
how is this different than every other thread?
---
Ranking up in Vanilla's PVP system was relative, not absolute. The total amount of honor you gained last week doesn't actually matter - the only thing that matters is how much honor you gained RELATIVE to everyone else in your faction last week.
---
Each week, during reset, all players on a single faction are ranked based on the total honor they accumulated over the course of the week. Then, each player gains progress towards ranks in the PVP system. For example (with numbers made up), the highest honor gained gets +100 rank points, 2nd gets +80, 3rd gets +70, 4th gets +60, and so on and so forth.
---
Each rank is a certain number of points apart. Let's pretend it's 100, so to hit rank 14 you need 1,400 total rank points (so the beginning of rank 13 you would have 1,300). The issue is, the higher your rank at the beginning of the week, the more decay in rank points  you have. So if you're rank 13, your decay may be -80 points a week, so getting the 2nd most honor in a rank on your faction wouldn't actually get you ANY progress toward rank 14 - only rank 1 would.
---
This means you are in direct competition with all the other players in your faction, and at the higher PVP ranks, this competition requires you to play ungodly hours to hit the higher ranks. I wouldn't be surprised if the first few Rank 14s in Classic do nothing else but PVP for 18+ hours a day.
---
Fuck, well done
---
I may be way off on this - but taunt functions on spell hit, whereas warriors other abilities function based on basic chance to hit. Take a look at the wording on [Neltharion's Tear](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19379),  [Band of Accuria](https://classicdb.ch/?item=17063) and the specific wording of the [Dreadnaught 4-pc](https://classicdb.ch/?itemset=523)
---
YAAAAS!! SUMMON THE LAG!
---
And that is why you find a replacement OT.  Slightly confused on if he was skipping any UG, how he wasn‚Äôt massively undergeared for high end progression and replaced.  The biggest hurdle for replacing under performing T6 raiders was attunements.  After they were removed it was much easier to poach top performers from lower profile guilds and force feed them gear.  
---
Perfect example of guild leadership needing to pull an executive decision.
---
May 15, 2012
---
It threw me for a second too.
---
They're just not quite experienced yet ;)
---
bro, accept your woosh.
---
The info in here is good, but one thing to take into consideration as well is when Bloodvine comes out tailors get 2% crit from the set bonus in addition to the 4% hit that is already on the pieces. You can always level tailoring, craft the robe and then drop it for engi / mining later, but I personally just go tailor engi for the entirety of the game.  You can buy 1-300 mats cheap early on. I spent like 20g to get to a point where I could use sapper charges just as an example. The robes will last until ZG which is likely to be a year+ away. If you still don't like the idea of tailoring, there is the robe that Vslice linked, or a robe from the lich boss is Scholo. Good luck
---
Your logic just shows how poor your diet is
---
Making an omelette for 4 people instead 1 just needs to add more eggs. The rest of the work is the same.
---
I will be drinking. 
---
Starting the game a week or so later on reduced hours.

Can I recommend [https://github.com/aikoven/typescript-fsa](https://github.com/aikoven/typescript-fsa)?

---
If you mean what phase an item is added then yes. If you search for an item on wowhead it says on the quick facts box the phase. Also searching for weapons or items in general, you can sort the list by phase too.
---
Wow a whole 28 days from your last near-identical [removed] shitpost.
---
I refuse to believe 2012 was 7 years ago, and no amount of evidence will change my mind.

^^^^I've ^wasted ^my ^life.
---
Made this video from Luna guild on Shadow Council. https://youtu.be/BxfunmBvIgI
---
At this point I just subtly bully feral druids for their inevitable hyperdefensive threads and posts.
---
Yeah, it's the druid form where your action bars disappear and moonfire is auto-bound to your "forward" key.
---
10000%
---
Are you going to add cat dps?
---
I don't think you quite understand how mafias work in Vanilla.
---
The devilsaur mafia for example will be camping devilsaur across all 4 layers, hopping back and forth.
---
They can choose to fiddle with the devilsaurs economy whatever way they choose. Consolidate all to layer 1...split b/w 2 and 3, ignore 4. 
---
The ways are plenty to do enough damage.
---
Unfortunately I'll just try the brute force strategy of trying to elbow my way toward the front. Any attempt at something more tactical will probably be slower even if it's less frustrating. Luckily I'm in a decent sized guild already and we will probably form full groups right at the start. That should give us an edge on mob tagging and kill x quests. By level 5 things should be slightly better and by level 8 fairly normal, yet still crowded.
---
Can't you play on a german server with an english client? And have you had experience with playing on an international server?
---
People did it back then, people will do it now.
---
It was bannable then, it's bannable now.
---
I wouldn't recommend it.
---
Because it‚Äôs literally impossible for a ret paladin to come even close to keeping up in the meters.
---
Elite Private Server players are going to wipe the floor with those that haven't played the game in 15 years. They're used to adapting to changes, have already adapted to the data available from the Classic Beta, and know the game much better than everyone else.
---
Or the other way around.
---
Oh. It came off far more a Troll attempt than a joke. /shrug. I don't care much either way. I just wanna play q\_q
---
Remember to utilise lower rank healing spells (it's amazing how many healers don't) also pw:s  means warriors will generate no rage from dmg received so I'd only use it on those that are taking a ton of damage, bad pulls or when boss/mob uses heavy hitting abilities. This will make your group faster and help with the tanks threat but if you're unsure just shield them as it's always faster if you dont wipe.
---
Quitting guilds for an item drop going to someone else
---
Shamans as 49 thinks are pretty fun though.
---
probably
---
Still won‚Äôt work. A pug typing in bg chat won‚Äôt be good enough to stop a premade in voice chat. A bunch of them will farm your gy while the others work on getting onto the roof.
---
Play faction your friends are playing in
---
Unfortunately it‚Äôs been proven that maybe 15-20% of private server info was accurate. The rest is all off.
---
I've always wondered if the % hit gained from weapon skill was actually just the 1% missing hit when &gt;10 skill below your targets defense. 
---
going to be fun to do all the testing and theory at 60.
---
Yikes man.  I guess I'll count my lucky stars that between gaming and working construction my hands don't seize up because fuck, gaming is my favorite hobby.
---
Because no one wants to join a guild that will gear up the officers and their friends first and eveyrone else can have the table scraps.
---
I mean defending with a prem. OP asked for idea to "sabotage rank 14" of others
---
&gt; so I can raid tank soon :) 
---
Man, we're gonna see a lot of broken dreams come classic.
---
No. Buying gold is *not* against the EULA and is *not* a bannable offense. Selling and advertising that you're selling is. They don't even bother with a "please don't buy gold, it might be stolen" email anymore like they did pre-Cata.
---
kill all the mobs on your way to the quest objectives and back instead of just running past
---
I think these are prolly the 2nd best options but still not worth passing up the Archmage for imo. These robes have only a 5% chance to drop in 4 bosses MC after patch 1.5, and likely won't be in classic til the BWL Phase 3. That's basically the same drop rate as the Archmage pattern in LBRS but with much more competition(vs other mages in 5 man or vs all casters in 40 man)
---
Another option is the [Bloodvine Vest](https://itemization.info/item/19682) but they weren't added til ZG 1.7/Phase 4 in classic. Although it still requires tailoring to craft, least you can get someone else to make.
---
[Netherwind Robes](https://itemization.info/item/16916) and may be easier to get and will likely come out in same phase as Robe of Volatile Power.
---
[Field Marshal's Silk Vestments](https://itemization.info/item/16443) aren't bad if you grind the rank for em and don't mind waiting til phase 2
---
The already suggested Robe of Winter Night or [Freezing Lich Robes](https://itemization.info/item/14340) are prolly you only real phase 1 option. You really should just grind out the tailoring for the Archmage Robes then drop it for Engineering.
---
Idk about pvp gear, and that wont be until phase 2.
---
No idea where those numbers are coming from...
---
weird. I always thought it was.
---
not telling it to other people on reddit
---
Release is 11PM for me, so I will stay up all night to play. My flatmate and I are going to set up in the living room and crack open the beers. I suspect minimal progress will be made with regards to the game itself, it's going to be rammed with players and the servers may crash/lag etc. 
---
Worst case is that I sit up all night drinking beer with my buddy, waiting for the servers to stabalise. Best case is that the launch actually goes smoothly and we manage to get out of Durotar.
---
The guy is spamming this thread with Bullshit... just look 2 posts down far.
---
why his behind of course!
---
Comparing the numbers between beta and pservers?
---
If you not going to get RotA, second best is Robe of Winter Night. If you still can‚Äôt get RoWN, then go for Freezing Lich Robe or Alanna‚Äôs Embrace from Ras Frostweaver in Scholo. If you still can‚Äôt get any of those, craft Dreamweave Vest. I suggest you don‚Äôt go mining. you are a mage. Farm gold and buy your mats for engineering from AH. it‚Äôs around 150-200g. Go Tailoring craft bags and farm felcloth for mooncloth(4days CD) for later on.
---
Private servers.
---
The AH is cross-layer. What does consolidating devilsaur skins to one layer even do?
---
This just made me bust a gut. You're the best parent that kid could wish for, now smack him in the head and tell him to man up .
---
Doesn't change the chat channels tho :/
---
Played international premade rBGs and dungeons/raids on retail for the last two years, and I've been playing on various private servers since WotLK. I think I just like to have more options available - in regards to players and guilds.
---
If it's going to be 5/1 I might end up having to sell gold lmao.
---
No need to get defensive over the question about age: ‚Äúsurvey‚Äù around here have shown that many people didn‚Äôt played Vanilla or were too young and were just having fun on their parent or older brother account and have just vague souvenir.
---
And you answered my main question: I first answered to OP who was thinking that SS-TM happened very often. Fact is that for a brief period of time (basically before 1.5 and especially between 1.4 and 1.5) there were a lot of battles there very often but it stopped. So yes sometime guild made event there or some people attacked town and for the sake of old time, people flocked around that area but this was seldom and my point is that 1.5 (BG+DK) really hit world PvP hard. 
---
So If you agree that it happened and you‚Äôre just arguing that it didn‚Äôt completely disappeared then we agree.
---
Then my other point is that after 1.5, Blackrock mountain and other lvl60 areas (and STV of course) where the place where mass PvP happened and not SS-TM who was an area without much interest for lvl60
---
Finally you aged very fast as you get from 14 to 18 over 2 years ;]
---
But in the end I think it‚Äôs just a misunderstanding: There was a lot of world PvP before 1.5 and then in one night, it massively went away. So if you agree with that and are just telling that it didn‚Äôt totally vanished then we‚Äôre fine
---
No, the EULA specifically outlines that use of the game/platform for commercial purposes is a violation but does not at all mention *buying* in-game items for money.
---
I may be a fury warrior at heart but I'm not stupid :-)
---
To each their own. Optimal is subjective to your Raid leader. Kitty won‚Äôt be your top DPS, sure. But you bring: Innervate, Bres, FF etc. Meaning you increase the overall chance of killing the boss with several tools rather than just more damage. 
---
MCP is very soloable. I soloed it at level 40 during beta. The drop chance isn‚Äôt bad either. But I agree that farming it just to be viable would def suck, that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt plan on doing it personally. With that being said there are some SERIOUS die hard feral raiders out there determined to make it work lol.
---
His sword has a pen built into it. And the pen has a clock built into it. That guy is not to be messed with!
---
&gt;Only tauren.
---
Fixed that for me.
---
...okay, I'll have a few non-tauren characters, but I just love playing the big races in RPGs for some reason. Maybe because I'm the only male in my immediate family who doesn't top 6'2" (stupid genetics), so it's fun to fantasize about seeing the world they way they do.
---
People might flame and hate private server players. But its good we have them, they have knowledge and many of them will be "officer" material, since many new players dont know the ins and outs of Guild Managements.
---
They might hate it now, but when classic comes and they help out with class optimization and overall guild improvments.  I think people will be happy there are those that can help others, even if its such a simple things as how to do the pulls in instances or holding premades in pvp.
---
It's worse than all the whirlwind weapons for warrior.
---
Weapon speed does matter, but only in so much as items of the same ilvl tend to be best optimized for damage when they have the highest swing time. (Think like that C'thun axe vs Kalimdor's Revenge)
---
Outside of this there are niche cases for raiding 2h warrior where you dont want a 2h with below a certain speed for PvE because when you pop flurry it will mess with your slam timer. But that was more of a TBC thing.
---
But Whirlwind Weapons all have the equivalent stats of like a level 40+ dungeon drop.
---
Look at the whirlwind axe, it has 3.6 speed but the damage range is actually just better. It's just a full on better weapon.
---
It's important to know WHY swing speed is important. People can be really weird about it in my experience.
---
On the other hand, for Sham or Ret I think it might actually be the best option until the SM quest reward axe or Herod's Axe.
---
Interesting, I‚Äôll keep this in mind! Thanks
---
I really hope you forgot the /s
---
its just renamed so people can't make black people jokes but its still the same stats as the nicker
---
Learn every quest in the 1-10 zones, then cut out the ones which take too long. Keep in mind named mob kill quests were noted to have a ~1 min respawn time on the beta, so if you group up with other taggers while you wait they shouldn't be much of a bottleneck. The real bottleneck is low drop % quests, its often better to grind mobs in an isolated area instead.
---
Practice on a populated private server during peak times to get more of an idea of what mobs will be camped.
---
Think so too.
---
What is important for people to realize is that how long it takes to get to r14 can vary a lot since its dependant on how much the rest of your server PvPs. How much time other people on the server have, how many people there are on your server, there is a large number of variables in the system. Still, the grind will likely be quite extreme either way.
---
I still don't think the system should be adjusted though, simply because Classic should stay the way it was. I'm part of the "slippery slope" callers so I don't want to see a change as substantial as adjusting the honor system.
---
What's the alternative then? Just play PvE. The only real advantage PvP gear has over equivalent PvE gear is more stamina, if I recall correctly.
---
I know some people will say "but I'm a PvP player I don't want to be *forced* to have to play PvE". If that is the case you have to commit to PvP and make the best out of it. Participate in premades and "honor mafias" to maybe get to make it as far as you can.
---
The mindset that I see there is one that I think is misguided in an MMORPG. The design of the game should incentivize players to want to experience all parts of the game, PvE and PvP included. As someone playing an MMORPG, players should ideally also enjoy both of those aspects as both of them are part of the RPG experience. From my perspective, adjusting parts of the game to accommodate for only a certain type of player only serves to make the game less fun in the long run as there is less to do for players and the experience is less diverse.
---
That could work I suppose. It‚Äôll cost you your reputation on the server and any chance you have of getting rank 14, but that could work.
---
It's really not. Just because people say things you disagree with doesn't mean it's toxic. I'm on here every day and rarely see true hostility.
---
Thanks I hate it.
---
Servers probably won't actually be working until 3AM. After that, I'll hop on discord with my guild and shoot the shit and level as fast as possible following Hakurai's guide for the alliance. In the first 24 hours I hope to at least clear deadmines, and be on my way to Duskwood. I imagine Northshire Abby will be a nightmare, so I will quickly run away and get levels via other methods. Playing warrior, going to try to get a buddy to heal me.
---
I played from Vanilla to Wrath and I loved Paladin that entire period. I came back for Legion and found my class was drastically different from what I remembered. I rolled and leveled a Brewmaster because BC showed me how much I love tanking with a Prot Pally. Brewmaster showed me alternative ways to tank without the traditional sword and board and I adored it. 
---
That said, I can't figure out if I should stick with the alternative tanking mindset and roll Feral Druid (which I enjoy to some degree) or relive my unparalleled class fantasy as a Paladin and maybe tank some dungeons if people would group with me.
---
Depends on how annoyed you get when people ask you to heal, because it will happen a lot.
---
What about private servers. What private server is somehow putting forth that 80% of the info was inaccurate?
---
West coast player checking in.. I realized I'd be able to play on the 26th technically which shifted things for the worse but technically I gained a day of time so yay?..
---
I'm assuming, that even with layer, there will be some fuckery going on but nothing long term or preventing a lot of people from playing. If there a choice I'll opt for less populated layers so I there's less competition initially.
---
My schedule is going to allow for some good stretches inbetween the days so I'm confident I'll get to my mid 20's by thursday or friday. Friday though is when I go balls to the wall. 7am-9am class, come home and nap for 2-3 hours or longer, and then just go all out until mondays 4pm class.
---
I should be able to get to my mid or late 30s by the end of the week If I stayed glued to leveling.
---
Each point of weapon skill also grants hit rating. So, going from 300 -&gt; 305 means you ignore the first 1% penalty, and also gain 2% hit rating on top of that, for an effective 3% hit.
---
I maintain that the propaganda is started by druids to keep their numbers low so they can get all the druid loot
---
It will be a flying mount you can use at level 1.
---
Why would the stated guides not have the hit gear as the pre-raid bis?  I could take a guess, do they give up too much armor and stamina as my first thought? You claim it is too important.  So much that you can be looked down upon by not picking a certain class over another.
---
Buying gold is bannable, people have been getting banned for it for YEARS. I don't know where you're getting this false information from...
---
That's a misconception, I'm sorry. Before BGs were released, pvp groups of both factions scavenged the contested zones (hillsbrad, plaguelands etc.) and as soon as the BGs were out, 95% of those groups disbanded and started going for BGs almost exclusively, as they yielded more honor.
---
World pvp obviously isn't referring to people killing each other, when they meet in the world. It's about organizing and using the contested zones to do pvp and farm honor. And that stopped as soon as the BGs were out. It happened to my group back then and all of the other groups that we were constantly in conflict with.
---
Had to scroll way too far to see this response.
---
People have been banned for buying in game items/gold for money, it is most DEFINITELY against the rules and has been for years.
---
What numbers? Who has any breakdown of this? Are we just talking about damage numbers? That info? Is that like... really 80% of the info?
---
I once did this and a nice BOE dropped, and the guy rolled for it and won it.
---
So I never did it after that.
---
Yeah about 1 day apart iirc, I just truly didn‚Äôt know that Cthun was nerfed too
---
Eh. You'd be a "rarity" accepted as DPS in Raids. You'd really have to be in good relations with the raid leader to be put in there, and I bet you'd be 1 of 2 at most. AQ/Naxx is indeed the most appropriate time for a Shadow Priest, mostly for Shadow Weaving for others, to be honest.
---
I honestly don't think I've ever seen a Shadow Priest in MC that didn't already have AQ/Naxx gear and was there for idk what reasons..
---
If someone sees a priest in a Dungeon, they usually expect a healer UNLESS someone else, ie a Paladin, Druid, Shaman, etc, have already declared themselves a healer. It's actually pretty rad to have a SP in there in combination. As long as there is a primary Tank and Healer in dungeons, no one should really be complaining.
---
I hear you man, gaming is my favorite hobby too. I just to try and spread some awareness to my fellow gamers so they can keep on gaming without any issues or damages.
---
How? They‚Äôve already added stacking cooldowns to stop you from changing layers any time you mine a resource, kill a monster that grants XP, get engaged in any PVP combat etc
---
This isn‚Äôt going to be exploited
---
You can probably raid shadow in more casual guilds. That being said even when my guild was raiding MC on Pug night (on a private server and through aq40 content as a guild) we wouldn't take Pug shadow priests.  We would allow alts to raid as shadow but pugs we wouldn't put up with it
---
Other things like BE ANGRY
---
Basically, against a 315 defense, points 301 to 304 are worth 0.2% hit, each. Point 305 is worth 1.2%. This is all before accounting for the 1% ignored.

This post and it‚Äôs supporting combat tests from beta should be any melee DPS (but especially Warrior)‚Äôs combat table bible.
---
Dont be afraid to ask questions and group up with randoms doing the same quests as you. 
---
Classic is about working together and building networks. That rogue you met in barrens who mentioned he was an enchanter is a good friend to have at lvl 60. 
---
So talk to people, be social, RP a little. Get immersed in the game and let the world work around you instead of trying to force your way into it.
---
&gt; Most of them say that raids won‚Äôt take one until later on into ZG/AQ/Naxx.
---
That's so weird how these people who write guides can see into the future and tell you what guilds will and won't be doing...
---
The Classic meta isn't 100% known, and even if it was you already are saying you're a casual player so the hardcore guilds who give a shit weren't on the table in the first place.
---
&gt; I‚Äôm just asking for someone who has more experience with the game if I‚Äôll actually be able to experience stuff like Molten Core.
---
&gt; how is the Situation with dungeons? 
---
Fine, but you'll be expected to heal, not DPS.  If you don't, you will have as hard a time finding a group as a DPS like a mage or warlock.  I don't see people playing DPS classes rerolling just because it's a little harder to get into a dungeon group.  You're also forgetting that Classic relies more heavily on guild/friends to play the game, not randos.  Make friends with a group and you'll always have a spot.
---
we did a 10 man druid  WSG and "cheesed" the flag and the game for over 2hrs. It was fun Alliance did not like it thou, haha
---
Honestly if you get scammed like this, you deserve it.
---
Exactly; each layer reduces the chances you'll see someone anyways.
---
Nevermind if most of the people you meet end up being "tourists" anyways - it just means that your reputation won't really matter outside a friends list, at least until they finally remove layering.
---
I wish. These people have no integrity. They are the type that would steal from their own grandmother.
---
um as shadow.... you are pretty useless unless the guild or has lots of warlocks
---
you are there to apply shadow weaving and most guilds take one tops
---
so if progression raiding is your goal then its not good to be a shadow priest
---
Wait, there is already no timer in WSG in vanilla. It is a game of patience. Like arenas in the good old days.
---
So because people don't world pvp the way you want it's not world pvp?  Alrighty then.
---
Fishing, cooking, skinning, herbalism is the way to go IMO if you want to make easy money while leveling.
---
Yes, Hillsbrad was a meat grinder that killed the servers multiple times per day , until the first battleground patch. Then flowers started growing again and it was over. I can't say how it has played out on private servers though, only referring to vanilla back then.
---
Definitely not. If you want to fully enjoy/experience Classic you should probably roll a mage. If you have little to no knowledge about the game, you'll have a hard time with a meme spec.
---
Experience, reputation, damage numbers
---
Dungeon and raid scaling
---
Armor and weapons.
---
Stats and talents
---
Abilities and shared DR
---
Significant differences in each of those categories
---
Ya gotta have one nice meal before to take it. Otherwise you're gonna feel weak and maybe a lil shaky
---
RP server? That may be the difference.
---
Because the majority of your hit comes from weapon skill which can only be improved by racials
---
1. Untrue. DPS doesn't scale well late AQ but it's enough other than that. Hunters are also top tier in all forms of PvP.
---
2. Who cares
---
3. Untrue
---
4. Who cares
---
Not being there
---
 ^(though I would of been 5)
---
Tanking is still a very active and engaging role. Just because you just hit Maul and Swipe instead of hitting Sunder, Shield Slam, Revenge and Heroic Strike doesnt really mean the class is boring to play.
---
Yea, well I hope people understand that mileage varies.. The higher the raid the less appropriate it is, and hopefully you've found a community of raiders where you fit in
---
Orc
---
You can think of it as each point of weapon skill increasing your hit chance by 0.4% up to +5 skill. Full details here: https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/wiki/Attack-table
---
I'm not talking about AHs. Maybe I worded that poorly. Basically it gives them a larger pool of devilsaur and a wider range of options to go after them than they would if they were locked to 1 layer/server.
---
Just think about how much devilsaur they will harvest for the months to come and after the merge has happened.
---
Is it even possible to calculated theoretical DPS? Most of the game's formulas, spell coefficients, proc rates etc are all unknown
---
If pserver people are to be believed, raids are so easy now any random 40 people in any random 40 specs can clear them in a week after launch.
---
Ah I see.  Must have something to do with the the damage "ticks" of the channeled spell.
---
Private server is not vanilla experience and as we've seen more and more of the actual beta it's been shown how wrong private servers were actually getting things.
---
So yeah if you only played on private servers you have no vanilla experience and it is invalid.
---
Meni crashes. Meni failed logins. Meni LFM lvl 1 hogger raids. 
---
Cant. Wait.
---
Aren't international chat channels going to be a mixture of different languages? I personally would rather play on a german only server. 
---
But I see a lot of germans say they don't want to play with germans, because they are toxic. French say the same thing about their people. Seems like people don't realize that there are retards everywhere, regardless of wether you will be playing on international or german servers. But that's just my take on it
---
I feels odd and hollow to me (key words=to me)
---
you may feel differently, but if a member of the other faction is being annoying and I cant do a darn thing about it... well that just feels wrong
---
The best ever system used in a guild i was in (very sucessfull in server 1sts and rep) was an attendance based system rolling.  
---
you had a % attendance rating.  some one with 100% attedance got an item over someone with a 70% attendance.  Want an item? SHOW UP.    if you could not make a raid just message an officer before the raid.  real life gets in the way. we were chill about it.  but don't try to abuse it by commiting genocide on your family.  (dog died.. then fish . .then cat..  well sorry grandma you're next)  
---
this encouraged participation and discouraged people showing up only for the day the loot they want might drop.  
---
partial loot council for ties.  bis slot ect.  every class had an officer chiming in on item for spec/raid role ect.   obviously mainspec over offspec ect.
---
Oh okay guess I was wrong, thanks DJCzerny!
---
\&gt; they take less damage
---
This is where I stopped. How does a druid take less damage when they have ZERO way to mitigate crushing blows, cant block, etc? I remember healing druids and they take a fuck ton of damage .
---
The real problem is that you've been playing shitty private servers so you think you know what youre talking about when you dont know jack.
---
Druids will have no place in highend raiding outside of healing
---
No need to hope. Just park yourself outside of the mage portal area. People come in flagged all the time.
---
Patience lol. The word You are looking for is fucked.  It was fucked.
---
What are you talking about?  It's been proven that itssang's statistics are 42-67% correct on Thursdays, and goes up to 48-85% on days that are prime on the calendar.  Proven!
---
Not necessarily. I know what you're saying, but even if they do a TBC-like expansion, that'll probably be better.
---
Keeping Org/Sw and the old world as the main focus instead of Shattrath or etc, would change the game's social feel.
---
And then non-dailies, non-LFG....
---
There are a lot of design decisions that can go into building on top of the "Why is Classic WoW more desirable than retail for these people" reasoning
---
So I don‚Äôt want to speak for him, and I‚Äôm not the most knowledgeable warrior player but I think it might be different in a 1v1 situation. The trinket he use was AGM. It absorbs an good amount of damage at 40. He popped it when he connected because he knew i was going to go bear which he wouldn‚Äôt have  been generating a ton of damage off taking damage anyway.
---
He can still generate rage off dealing damage tho. Trying to outburst a Druid is tough for melee if played right.
---
There is no timer in vanilla WSG.
---
If you want a pvp healer id consider Druid instead. As shaman, you are helpless against a focus
---
As someone that works in a kitchen, I'm used to smashing food into my mouth over a trash can. Chowing while sitting in front of a screen is a luxury
---
You just probably weren't in a competitive guild, specially for TBC where at the end no one could compete with warlocks. And for vanilla warriors were also the king of DPS once you start getting into BWL/AQ40. (though since we are starting with 1.12, warriors are top tier dps in MC as well.)
---
Food causes the ENS to trigger parasympathetic nervous systems pathways to begin firing.
---
This will cause your pupils to dilate, your breathing to slow, and for you to feel more relaxed. And if you're trying to keep your butt clenched when you hear the rogue stealth sound in STV GOOD LUCK, because your sphincter will literally be relaxed- so instead of a butt clenching victory over the mouthbreathing undead rogue, your reduced focus will cause you to lose: your relaxed asshole will result in a soiled ego (and pair of pants).
---
/s (or is it)?
---
What‚Äôs so bad about playing a private server? I have a lvl 33 on lights hope that I‚Äôm using as a practice run for release- your honestly gonna tell me relaxing after work on a private server makes me a inherently bad person?
---
It sets a price ceiling though, also when presented with the option to buy gold for cheap and risk a ban on a character you've put months if not years of effort into plenty of people will pay the premium.  No gold sellers don't go away, but tokens absolutely cut into their bottom line
---
&gt; the numbers
---
Like?
---
Dude I LOVED typhoon when it first came out lol
---
Do you have an official source on this?
---
My fault, I thought there was a patch later in Vanilla before BC that added the timer.
---
To win AB you should have had to 5 cap.
---
No man, but world pvp usually refers to more than just accidentally coming across a player and killing each other. People tend to describe these huge organized battles that rage across the contested zones like a storm. And that did happen indeed - Unfortunately, just until the BGs were released.
---
Quick question, how much extra work do you have to put in to tank raids effectively other then farm MCP?
---
Healers on 5man wont be happy to compete with a Spriest for gear, just like tanks wont invite a fury warrior, or will just leave the group/ask the leader to kick if he sees one joining. You better off healing as Spriest on 5mans.
---
Druid is pretty easy, just have a feral set and switch to Kitty and you'll do decent damage
---
Just do the switch, and completely unbind the turn Keys. It will be painful, but your body should have adapted within a few days.
---
Yeah, I vendored my Tier 3 right before Wrath as well to get inventory space.. Know how you feel. Fortunately they added it back on the Black Market Auction House which meant it didnt matter anyway, as there's no prestige attached to this gear anymore.
---
Now anyone who did Garrison in WoD can get the set effortlessly.
---
I just read my first WoW book, Cycle of Hatred, it was alright but going for War of the Ancients next.
---
https://i.imgur.com/dnT5UNC.jpg

This was during bc but it was a very long wsg like 10 hours or something.
---
Well, it's like post about not only 420 ilvl can have raid progress but 380 ilvl too. I wish you good luck in leveling your druid to 60.
---
Female human have the best models in the game
---
There is no risk of a ban. Buying gold is not against the terms of the EULA, only selling is.
---
the guys right, the guy hes responding to is clamining to be almondbutter, who with full naxx gear(including KT weapon) is doing less DPS than the warriors in a server first MC with full blues on
---
3 and 7 were accurate.
---
Ill be buying a few k.  Should just add topless really, so I can do it legit.
---
Don't fry bacon naked.
---
The chest respawns after being looted at all, anyways.
---
You say "pirated" as if anybody cares or thinks it's even bad.
---
If you feel "forced" to do anything in a video game, you may want to take a step back..
---
Grief a priest trying to get his benediction quest done and let me know if world pvp exists.
---
I like the ancient protector trope. My main for 12 years was a draenei shaman. They're thousands of years old and dedicated their lives to one day defeat the burning legion. So naturally night elf is the closest to that role for me. Thousands of years old protectors of nature and also hate the burning legion.
---
As for class. Alliance doesn't have shaman in classic and warrior is my second favorite class.
---
Ruining my GPA in undergrad and delaying my actual career for 7 years.
---
Timers came in wrath with the same patch that had LFG system
---
Why would you bot on your main account though? lol
---
as a former stepdad, I can't make heads nor tails of this contradictory statement
---
I always thought it was weird you had to get both flags.  It should have just been "get their flag and bring it back", first team to X points wins.
---
Pretty sure you could still buy Bijou's on the AH and turn them in?
---
if by none you mean priest yeah
---
there are only really 2 options here -   
---
1. tag first or group up. 
---
2. just start killing mobs until you are level 4 and deuce out of starting area ASAP.
---
I dunno how I got shammy flair I play alliance
---
Also bear threat might be better than a prot warrior at MC level even with windfury. 
---
Especially if they're popping MCP
---
The pirated server scum has no integrity.   They'll cheat any and every way they can.
---
He did but he ran out of arrows and pet food so he got kicked.
---
Yeah... about 0.5s after the ban I was a an experience richer...
---
TBC didnt have a timer either, lol.
---
I‚Äôll keep checking. My best guess is I‚Äôll just get more comfortable with finding the slash coming from the mouse. Do you know if having a mouse button programmed to type multiple keystrokes(purely in terms of chat) is ok with regard to TOS? And not in the ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no way to tell‚Äù loophole.
---
Auto attack and earth shock on cooldown would be the most mana efficient way to do it I think. Will be much easier once you get windfury.
---
Druid/x vs druid/x cross kill on dps.
---
I have all day and a piss bottle.
---
Depends, do you want the usual reddit response saying you'll be fine or a brutally honest opinion?
---
I sold my account as I prepared to start medical school. I had everything: hand of rag, rank 13, tier 3, BiS fury gear.  I just really needed the money then.  Now, I don't need money, and I wish I had that account just to look at, even if I couldn't use it with the upcoming launch
---
Oh, agree 100%. Nearly all gear looks great and  proportional on them. Except the giant weapon models but that's my favorite thing about them to be honest.
---
Well people absolutely get banned for it so don't know what to tell you.  You can try to rule lawyer all you want if you get caught it won't matter.  Eula pretty much gives blizzard the right to ban you for whatever reason they chose.
---
If you don't have an SLA with your ISP for nine nine uptime you're essentially a keyboard turning casual.
---
You can't even read...  commercial purposes includes buying and selling.
---
And what about the fact that you are now level 10 with 3 copper to your name and level 1 spells?
---
My method is doing my addons, Marcos and keyblinds so yeah I‚Äôll be behind anyways
---
It did depend on the server.
---
I looked into gold back then.  But genius me found WoWGlider a great botting program for $10.
---
I used to pvp at a high level whike raiding AQ40 so my time for mats)gold grind was zero.  So overnight I ran the bot.
---
To my knowledge they never learned to detect but the creator was issued heavy legal threat and caved selling all his users out to avoid litigation.  RIP my 4 vanilla 60s
---
lol no
---
I got everything I ever wanted in Vanilla and TBC. :)
---
..and don't play melee.
---
How does that math work all the way to 15 defense though? Shouldn't every 5 weapon skill give 1% hit, before accounting for the 1% ignored.
---
There is no timer in WSG in Classic and if a GM messages you about your refusal to capture the flag, just tell them it‚Äôs part of your roleplaying experience and they‚Äôll go away.
---
I don't think i've seen this sentiment atall on this sub.
---
Farming it takes forever. You need 12(?) of the chest drops that only spawn once every three hours and they‚Äôre usually heavily contested (greens and shit drop as well and it‚Äôs fun wpvp). Getting a head start for twinks is exactly what a lot of people would do especially on pve servers. I expect at least a few low levels to make the journey over to the first few gurubashi events, or maybe a few people parking alts there. Also, I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs gonna be a lot of downtime during P1; you get your preBIS and do your raids, besides that and consumable farming in the world/gold farming the only thing that‚Äôs left for most people is pvp or leveling alts. 
---
Personally it doesn‚Äôt really matter to me with the whole layering thing, and I agree that it‚Äôs not really a huge deal as I think layering is far and away a net good. But the trinket is very nice for twinks and plenty of people will (attempt to) abuse layering to get it
---
You know the best way to find people flagged for pvp?
---
Grow a pair and roll on a pvp server. ;)
---
They are easy to an extent. But why take a suboptimal dps that will take gear from other dps classes when we can just grab a pug mage or lock?
---
I fucking hope it does honestly
---
You don't need a lot of warlocks for an spriest to be competitive.  Definitely not more than 1 though.
---
I griefed my own faction and got denied from a raiding guild due to it.
---
Lol agreed. If someone is stupid enough to delete a level 60 for any reason other than already having 10 level 60's and needing the space, I dont feel bad for them in the slightest honestly.
---
Uhhhh I played on Shadow Council in vanilla :o
---
You can't summon *into* a raid instance in classic, so your lock is going to need some protection if he wants to summon most of the raid
---
I'm just going to assume you're a troll trying to get people banned. It's been bannable since launch, there is tons of proof of people banned for buying gold and items from websites, and gold sellers get banned for advertising too.
---
Don't miss being a kid at all for shit like this. Brings back the fury of trying to get my mom to understand the fact that no, I can't take out the trash, I'm running a dungeon and can't leave the computer for like 2 hours without fucking over 4 other people. 
---
No I can't pause it.
---
Nah, the name wasn‚Äôt changed until 2008.
---
All of those ideas are contradictory to what you are trying to accomplish.
---
And yet just about everyone of them ends up deleted by the OP or a moderator.
---
If I'm playing wow (which is not that often) I'm still on ShC but nothing like the vanilla days. Pretty sure Black Omen is still active on hoard side after all these years.

Non-meta and non-mandatory spec for raids, avoided by semi and more hardcore guilds (They pick healing priests with shadow weaving instead), and even if there is one full spriest then it's RL's best friend.
---
Dungeons? Zero AoE capabilities, generates unnecessary threat, goes oom very quickly. Can provide emergency heals, but it definetely does not seal the deal. 
---
I would recommend just to leave spriest to the people who already have well-established guilds and are ready to minmax, farm flasks, get r13 gear etc.
---
pfffffffft get a naga never worry about keybinds again.. ezpz
---
You just blew that person's mind
---
No, you will just heal.
---
Leave your door unlocked and one day someone will walk in there to rob the place and they can help you look for money, free helper.
---
The entire art approach is cartoony and kiddy.  Not upset with anybody for having a personal opinion, but I‚Äôve never understood the mass uproar over the new animations.
---
They have also had a good mix of support and crushing of people's hope of non-'meta' classes. As a future druid, I'm glad observer players exist. Otherwise I'd have never been comfortable with the choice. Sure, feral wont be top teir. But viable enough as long as I do not want to server race progression as a main tank lol
---
&gt;We're getting the authentic 1.12 vanilla blizzard experience
---
No we aren't. The content is all gated as if it's 1.1, yet the mechanics/abilities are implemented like 1.12.
---
Not only that we're getting updated UI, raid frames and Macros. The macros won't even function the way they did at any point in vanilla. 
---
&gt;Also as far as I know no private server ever even attempted an authentic patch progression either so.....
---
I never said the private servers have a more authentic experience. Some of them did in some ways. An example would be macros, UI, mods and even gear. That being said I am not saying PS did it better.
---
Yikes..
---
What‚Äôs the difference between a mafia on four layers vs four mafias on four different servers?
---
Also the devilsaur mafia, fingers crossed, wont be as big of an issue as it has been. Mages can‚Äôt polyspam the devilsaurs, cross faction collusion is illegal (they‚Äôll still be able to do it fine but it‚Äôll be much harder to pull off), etc. while I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll still exist I doubt it‚Äôll be as much of an issue as it has been
---
I‚Äôve done more than google and even those google results do not bring up a single ounce of proof of bans. Just people asking if it‚Äôs bannable and people like you answering that it is without knowing what the fuck they‚Äôre talking about.
---
One of the old gold selling websites is still up and you can tell that a couple people in my guild bought gold by their usernames being listed as having "won free gold" and that you could "contact them for a discount code."
---
You realize there are readily available leveling guides that will tell you ideal leveling routes already available?
---
Once again this is all stuff that was already done 14 years ago.  It's not some newly acquired knowledge that only private servers ever thought of.
---
What's wrong with pve servers?
---
It‚Äôs not a lie. Read the EULA. There isn‚Äôt even a single comment from Blizzard on their forums that buying gold is an offense.
---
4 is the number where I'd consider taking a shadow priest, 6 is the number where I'm like hell yeah we need a shadow priest
---
&gt;I'm still on ShC but nothing like the vanilla days. Pretty sure Black Omen is still active on hoard side after all these years.
---
HA, thats crazy to imagine. What were your vanilla names?
---
Well, my weekend ends on Wednesdays, and holy shit, I looked at a calendar and there is a weekend happening 4 days after launch.
---
&gt;What‚Äôs the difference between a mafia on four layers vs four mafias on four different servers?
---
You're thinking it'll be 4 mafias. It'll be one.
---
Where can I see the underlying math for this?
---
How do we know the numbers we get are even close to accurate?
---
I have seen just how riddiculous amount of work that went into the Retpaladin sheet to accomplish the same thing, and that with a bunch of people collaborating to make sure the mechanics were accurate. I have a very hard time believing this website can accurately map out multiple classes.
---
Just mathing out the DPS on a Firemage when you deal with multiple mages and rolling Ignites would be a major undertaking on its own.
---
yeah, the animated writing with corpses in the air outside the AH was next level.
---
If you cap honor every day, there will be more people at the top than the pyramid allows.  The top rank/level/whatever you want to call it is 0.3% of the active PvP player base per week.  "Active" PVP'ers had to get a certain amount of honor to qualify, in a perfect world you wanted as many people in the pool as possible, especially at the bottom because in theory that could add one or two extra people at the upper levels.
---
Not it isn‚Äôt and no there‚Äôs not. Gold sellers do get banned. Buyers do not.
---
A splendid idea!

:D

I've played on both.   1-60, PvE was way more chill and relaxed and i enjoyed not having to deal with a-hole ganking parties jumping me while fighting a mob.   At max level though, I enjoyed PvP realms much more.   It can get a little boring sometimes and a good random battle out in the world was a lot of fun.
---
This :D
---
Up to 5/5 in heart of the wild in Feral, then the rest in resto.  I think it's 0/30/21
---
The bear form/dire bear form armor % buff was patch 1.3 or 1.4, that was the the primary issue holding them back, their armor was *awful*.  By the time it got changed, even though it was fairly early on, the "druids can't tank" mindset had taken hold for the vast majority of players despite druids suddenly having way more health and armor in dire bear form than a prot warrior had.
---
Trust me, you don't want to try to play on the PvP servers with those shit stains from the pirated servers.  They're pure cancer.  Right wing sociopaths that revel in unfair advantages.
---
A larger supply for a larger playerbase.
---
So, contrary to the devs statement?
---
I'm benchpressing 200kg already, getting in shape to carry 40 mans ;)
---
&gt; No we aren't. The content is all gated as if it's 1.1, yet the mechanics/abilities are implemented like 1.12.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Not only that we're getting updated UI, raid frames and Macros. The macros won't even function the way they did at any point in vanilla.
---
Right but running say MC in phase 1 of classic will be the same as running it in 1.12 of vanilla.
---
Just commit to mouse turning only, keep your strafe keybinds and replace  Q,E with abilities.  I like quick access to PvP trinket and FAP as they  directly relate to my mobility so they are next to movement keys.  FD/freeze/scatter are on mouse buttons and the rest of abilities and consumables/items are on keyboard binds or key+modifier
---
&gt;Switch
---
I see what you did there
---
&gt;How are Shamans in solo PVE content
---
you'll put your dress and heal
---
Shit you're right, patch 2.3.2, 2008. My bad.
---
Don't worry, druids still aren't and won't be super popular, much less a dedicated bear tank.  You'll still be the token guild druid tank.
---
&gt; RIP my 4 vanilla 60s
---
If say that's fair.
---
I will probably book a hotel room and escape from my wife over a night just to play free of nagging and distractions. She probably think I‚Äôm out cheating on her. I don‚Äôt blame her, I‚Äôm probably the only guy in the world who disappears to a hotel just to play video games.
---
Reaching the 50 GPH minimum wage by farming isn‚Äôt easy as a Shaman. Warlocks, Priests, Mages, Druids, Rogues, Hunters, and even Paladins all have an easier time at it.
---
I see. Please everyone do what tbis guy is doing. Should work perfectly and you'll be ahead. 10/10. Thanks all.
---
Enhancement shaman are pretty good at killing shit solo especially if you put a few talents into resto too.  Not sure how much you're going to make just farming shit in the open world though.
---
Incorrect, certain ones get autoflagged due to filters imposed on this subreddit. In my experience and to the best of my knowedge, mods are happy to open up these threads as long as they aren't low effort (this particular post may fall into the low effort category now that I think about it).
---
No it won't. You get an updated UI and raid frames from the start. No waiting around for people to make mods. Then you get a whole host of macros that no longer function at all, and a new set that do stuff that wasn't possible. An example of this is checking for debuffs, or using an AOE on your target.
---
It's continent wide. So a new layer every 30-40 players would make empty layers. All but the last layer on each server should be pretty busy at launch.
---
Same here.  I like holding right click.
---
Zip - Gnome Mage - 60
---
Discord - Human Priest - 60
---
Well, then it‚Äôs even less of an issue that gets changed by layering. If the mafia is run cross server then why would it matter if there was layering or not? The devilsaur per player ratio remains the same and the mafia will control all of them anyway if it‚Äôs as bad as it has been. In fact, it‚Äôll be less profitable due to more devilsaurs per auction house; pservers were a bit higher pop compared to layers iirc when the mafias were at their peak, so less people per devilsaur means higher supply unless they artificially limit it (which means more time spent hunting devilsaurs you won‚Äôt actually be selling, drastically reducing profits)
---
All your hands and fingers are on it. Don't really have to grip anything with a proper mousepad.
---
Zinwrath!
---
&gt; booked 2 days off HYPE

More like a larger supply for the same exploiter mafias.
---
How's this hard to understand?
---
Everlook is even better ;)
---
1h enhance until 40 since leeway makes earthbind kiting impossible. 40+ ele for sure.
---
Yea.. tooth decay is a bitch.
---
Engineering is oP as fuck
---
Cooking is harder to train because you can only find a trainer in UC afaik (undead don't eat I guess).
---
The warrior class quest at 10 in Tirisfal Glade is a pain in the butt, but doable with 2 people, it also overlaps with another set of Quests in the area which is nice I guess. The rewards are the same though.
---
There is a nice early game ring reward in Silverpine which is worth it https://classic.wowhead.com/item=3235/ring-of-scorn. Also a good opportunity to grab FPs for doing SFK later. 
---
I would still go back to Kalimdor to do RFC at that early level but you'll have the UC quests which give good mail leggings at that level with very nice stats https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=5725/the-power-to-destroy
---
There is a very early tailoring trainer right before Brill which your wife could pickup for early bags, cloth and DE into wands (must have). Good opportunity to pickup herbing here as well.
---
Overall it's probably better than doing Mulgore (you) run to Tirisfal or Durotar even. Personally I bounce around between the two continents while leveling to make questing easier (overleveling).
---
But all that takes is one super try hard on the server to totally screw everyone over.  That happened on my server (actually, it was two Rogues not one).  They decided they wanted in, and were open about it on the forums.  The Cabal was like "no, you need to wait your turn", and they just said no, we'll farm as much Honor as we want.  It caused a lot of problems, as someone who didn't really care about those top ranks (and 99% of the rest of the server) it was /popcorn time.
---
Thanks Suds :)
---
Would you have passed it if you were him
---
If your a tank sure, as a dps warrior you'll be wearing the clown suit.
---
*shrugs* 
---
I'm just the translator.
---
1x Dagger + Shield = FlameTounge till WF available then go = WF instead of FlameTounge.
---
I would build Tanky and go 7/39/0 +5 so I have no struggle to pull 2 Mobs without shitting myself and Stoneclaw Totem will do his Job. (Taking the Talent is nice in Open-World if you PvE and or. PvP while fighting NPC's.)
---
The reality is most guilds or raid groups don't function how you're implying.
---
Even if people aren't world first raiders, they're still largely going to copy what the top guilds are doing, and people will always be biased against classes that don't fit with that notion. If a feral tank  doesn't mitigate as much as a warrior, and isn't necessary on 90% of fights, it's simply not a viable class, in the eyes of most players.
---
I wish Peons4Hire would make a comeback.  I found them to be smart and amusing.  If all gold sellers were like them... well it‚Äôd still be awful but maybe just a little less.
---
All that said, gold selling is such a machine now, so I don‚Äôt expect anything to creative there.  Established sellers are already taking orders, so it‚Äôll probably just be the over saturated spam fest that we see today in retail.
---
So weird how private servers are so wrong in all of their numbers, but people have known this stuff for 14 years!  
---
By your logic, somebody who has never played the game is just as good as somebody who has played it for 15 years.  Yes, that sounds completely correct XD
---
How are you hitting level 3 before anyone else without doing quests? It‚Äôs all the same mobs, board, scorprions, familiars. And even if you beat them by 5 mins you‚Äôre still going to have them right behind you tagging mobs you need. Don‚Äôt overthink it.
---
Healing in solo content, very smart.  Make sure the tank (you) doesn't die while the dps (also you) kills the mobs.
---
What an idiotic statement. Reputations go beyond leveling. The whole meaning of a reputation is that people who have never met you, have heard of you.
---
No room in my bags, sorry
---
So I‚Äôm guessing the tabard rep is not part of classic?
---
Was watching the video and say ZIP.  I remember your name, and i immediately remembered you as a gnome. I dont know why but i think we had some fun matches in WSG
---
So you dont like rank 1 WF, but rank 2 is good?
---
Buying gold could get you banned, you are not allowed to do real money trade.
---
I don't think a lot of people go in trouble they clearly prioritized the sellers over the buyers.
---
This is by no means supposed to be exhaustive. Hijacking from another answer to a similar question:
---
I definitely would have similar concerns :). It sounds like you'd really enjoy the some writing I've been doing while building it out. See [How often should I lifetap?](https://pikach.us/posts/2019-07-16-Lifetap.html) as an example. Also, a basic post on how we do all the modeling is here: [Primer on probabilities in Classic WoW](https://pikach.us/posts/2019-06-29-probability.html).
---
One of the things I hope to gain by increased visibility is some help in modeling certain combat interactions. It's currently all embedded in the code, but the readme gives a high level overview: https://github.com/owen-d/vanilla
---
Apologies for the link dumps!
---
They do get banned XDDDD There are SEVERAL people have have been banned for buying gold.

---
employees and representatives of blizzard have also STATES it's bannable on the official forums.
---
Same. I got rid of so much gear that I had to grind for again due to transmog.
---
Because I'm not a minmaxing tryhard, and the game doesn't require me to be one.  Dude wants to get in my group and there is room, he's going.  There will be loads of people who casually want to PUG stuff.
---
yeah but many of the p-s people are semi hardcore or pure hardcore. Giving advice to more of a casual or new people, can make it sound like its this or nothing. 
---
But its just the way they play the game, vanilla is a flavor for everyone
---
And some "help!  I was banned for buying gold" posts.
---
AARP's newest activity is farming honor!  Get off my lawn!
---
Right, still an itemization difference that's coming from post 1.12. He said if it didn't exist in 1.12 it won't be in classic.
---
I'm right there with you but I don't regret it. Leveling in TBC is largely the same as in vanilla, except there may have been a slight exp boost. I missed the end game content but played TBC endgame live and that was pretty sick.
---
Also mana stream totem or whatever it was called gives back it's mana cost in 20 seconds regardless of rank. Notice it takes 1.5 seconds longer to start normal mana regen tho
---
haha I bet you kicked my ass more then once.
---
Post-Nostalrius, the vanilla private server experience was virtually indistinguishable from the real thing. Dungeon mobs actually hit HARDER on servers that run the Nost core than they do in Classic, which means that those of us who've been playing on private servers for years are used to playing a harder game. Classic is going to be like Nost with bug fixes and training wheels.
---
Dude calm the fuck down. You use words like "Propaganda" and "need to get educated" like people saying druid are bad is an attack on western civilization. Nobody gives a shit. People will play how they like to play whether wrong or not. It's not a personal attack on you if you like to play druid. Go outside, take 5 minutes, take a deep breath and realize that it doesn't matter. Also, theres been a million threads on this subject already.

What is the panic about "getting ahead"? It's a long way to 60. If you set a pace that you can't maintain you're not going to stay ahead for long.
---
Because Blizzard is not dumb and can usually trace your side account to your main one anyway. Sooner or later you have to transfer stuff/gold over.
---
Think of it this way....
---
The most vile and tainted comments from Reddit and the forums will all be on PvP servers. All vying for some kind of epeen award in ganging people and talking trash.
---
PvE servers, you can enable PvP when you want, where you want, keep it only in battlegrounds if you want and so forth. Just like it was done in Vanilla and we had healthy BGs and TM/SS fights all the time.
---
It‚Äôs up to you.

"Its not out, till its out"

This is hilarious

All good advice, thanks!

Shaman are shit.  Idk y ppl want to play them.

Being too young to really appreciate the depth and complexity of the original game.

hes not 100% wrong tho, yall should stop baiting new players into rolling meme/hybrid classes that will be forced to heal

Well not really, what I said is someone who has only played private servers has no advantage over someone who actually played real vanilla.

I feel like hitting 40 in the first week is a bit unrealistic. It gets real grindy.

inb4 gold buying cheaters shout ITS NOT AGAINST EULA.
---
I actually do not remember SusanExpress. As others have mentioned it was mostly using bodies to write with names (both on the ground and floating) and spamming.
---
you think winding up a shadowbolt is better?
---
Yes thank you. Prolly gonna get ripped a new one by the "No Changes" crowd but I feel like that would be a necessity. Dont get me wrong I'm perfectly fine with how the game was/is going to be but convenience while farming, running an instance/raid(unlikely on the 2nd 1 but still), or just at any time to be able to search and see if u have an item that you need or someone is looking for is gonna be a great plus.
---
1/29/21 is better
---
Okay?  But those are just various UI issues, the balance of abilities, items and mobs will be the same as it was in 1.12.  That's no different than the differences between vent vs discord or thotbot vs wowhead.
---
&gt; for any commercial purpose
---
Buying gold is not "for any commercial purpose", it's for personal use. If you buy milk at the grocery store to make bread at your bakery, that is for commercial purpose. If you buy milk at the grocery store to drink in your home, that is not for commercial purpose. That section even goes into further detail by mentioning "gathering in-game currency for sale outside the Game" and "performing in-game services in exchange for payment".
---
&gt; Accordingly, you may not sell in-game items or currency for "real" money, or exchange those items or currency for value outside of the Game.
---
Exactly. Not a single thing about buying.
---
&gt; employees and representatives of blizzard have also STATES it's bannable on the official forums.
---
No they haven't.
---
im just answering the OPs question, and also telling the guy his plan is not at all like mine. Im not panicking
---
reduce chance to resist
---
I think you greatly overestimate Blizzard. I was botting from TBC to Cataclysm using the mentioned Glider, as well as other programs. Never botted on my main account. Had a few alt accounts banned, but nothing ever happened to the other accounts.
---
Could they connect the accounts? Of course they can. But are they going to ban multiple accounts all paying subscriptions? Absolutely not.
---
Can you please show us in the EULA where it makes the distinction between selling and buying gold?
---
Susanexpeess was around mid way through wrath. Before hand I have no idea. That's when I started. She faded quickly after Cata
---
I've gotten it a handful of times.
---
No, selling gold could get you banned. Buying gold will not.
---
RP-PVP self segregates the shitty PVPers from normal PVP servers. 
---
-Change my mind.
---
lolwut
---
I think the servers will be super stable, Blizzard proved on the last two expansion launches that they finally know how to do that. Since there's not any sharding, only layering there may be queues, or some servers might be closed to character creation but I think it'll be stable.  I except some servers to be closed to new characters after the name reservation happens.
---
I'm going to be playing solo on opening night because I'm foolishly playing a druid but I've got plans to meet up with some people for RFC and then later wailing caverns, after WC I'll probably being in a duo with a rogue.
---
When there's 10k+ people trying to get into one server, yes, it is 2+ hours.
---
But thanks for the condescending passive aggressive insult. Blocked :)
---
Lol. These are all basic management concepts. I'm sorry you've never had a good manager in your life, but they do exist, and they follow these principles.
---
Its obviously been awhile since ive played classic, but killing mobs is unlikely to make you rich.
---
Farming specific mobs or dungeons for a high demand BoE item can make you gold, farming mats for raid consumables can make you gold, farming mats for crafting high demand items can make you gold.
---
As for pve solo killing mobs, you'll be fine as a shaman...or any class. Just find a mage to make you water before you go out. You'll likely want to be enhancement rather than elemental, but you'll still need water.
---
do you remember what the brackets were roughly set to for bracket 1, 2 and 3? and how much they dropped after a few months after the first waves of rankers got r14? Thanks

Only that their knowledge is 14 years more recent, even if somewhat flawed... riiight.
---
Imagine being so insufferable that you report people for their username.

how?

Not saying I‚Äôll hit lvl 3 before anyone else, but I‚Äôll be hitting lvl 3 and moving outward before anyone else.  Either way it happens I won‚Äôt be fully completing the starting zone and leaving at 5 1/2 6 like the majority.

Thx for the reply, even though you did not really make it any easier to decide:)

---
He was talking about Human Rogues, but it's the same for warriors : "Therefore, for a Human Rogue who doesn't take the Weapon Expertise talent deep in the Combat tree, and has no +weapon skill from any equipped gear, stands to gain a massive 3% extra chance to hit from the sword racial." It has to do with the formula of weapon and defense skills for targets who are level 63 : 315 def VS 305 weapon skill for swords/maces = 6% hit only needed and 300 weapon skill = 9%.
---
So it won't be the same. There are tons of things impacted by the macro system being completely reworked. 
---
Also who cares about making MC feel like 1.12 MC? It was a total roll fest at that point. Even if they were making it that way, which they aren't for reason I've listed.
---
50-100g is like 1-2 hours of farming, maybe less for a mage. Not exactly breaking the bank...
---
Please, the only advantage they have is they're already organized no life scum.
---
Warlock zg set has multiple pieces abd requires tailoring for the +hit

The alliance are the bad guys...
---
It doesnt Matter. PPl say go full FT till 60 others would say go WF because of Flury-Crits uptime. WF is RNG and FT is constant damage.
---
That's definitely true. It only takes one person to destroy the system. It works great. Until it doesn't lol.
---
Criminally underated comment. If I learned one thing from the last stress test it's that Moonfire is one of the most OP spells for tagging in the wildwest of day of starterzones
---
IF you watch the PvP videos put out by private server players, there's no doubt the skill level of the person making the video is top notched, but all those people they're killing in wPvP look just as useless as most people looked in Vanilla.  
---
The hyperbole of both arguments is silly.
---
Oh yea, not too worried at this point. I'm looking forward to it really. Knowing how player skill factors in everywhere... I'm going to laugh at bad warriors thinking class is all that matters. I played a warrior late vanilla and mained it for the next 8 years primarily xD with an alt holy paladin and feral at points in wrath
---
I had no problem playing enchancement tbh
---
Except MUCH OF the info they hAVE IS WRONG
---
Truestrike shoulders come to mind.  Though hunter hit requirements are very low.
---
 This is the formula. Raid Bosses are level 63. Blizz during the beta confirmed that there is a modifier on targets 3+ levels higher than yours to ignore the first 1% of hit unless your weapon skill is within 10 of the bosses defense skill. So when skill triple dips to add to your hit if you can add 5 or more to it. 1st every point lowers chance to be dodged parried and missed by .04 and increases chance to crit by .04. Then you get a better hit formula. Then it ignores the -1 Hit chance modifier that was hidden. 305 weapon skill is a HUGE deal
---
    If the target is a mob and defense minus attack rating is 11 or more:     MissChance = 5% + (TargetLevel*5 - AttackerSkill) * 0.2%  
---
    If the target is a mob and defense minus attack rating is 10 or less:     MissChance = 5% + (TargetLevel*5 - AttackerSkill) * 0.1%
---
maybe some number here and there, but in general no
---
not kidding. if you logged off, and the rest of the server was doing more BG's well you are not going to get R13 or R14.  That's that.
---
This is the ONLY section that talks about in-game currency except the parts about "Blizzard owns it, not you".
---
&gt; Prohibited Commercial Uses: Exploit, in its entirety or individual components, the Platform for any purpose not expressly authorized by Blizzard, including, without limitation (i) playing the Game(s) at commercial establishments (subject to Section 1.B.v.3.); (ii) gathering in-game currency, items, or resources for sale outside of the Platform or the Game(s); (iii) performing in-game services including, without limitation, account boosting or power-leveling, in exchange for payment; (iv) communicating or facilitating (by text, live audio communications, or otherwise) any commercial advertisement, solicitation or offer through or within the Platform; or (v) organizing, promoting, facilitating, or participating in any event involving wagering on the outcome, or any other aspect of, Blizzard‚Äôs Games, whether or not such conduct constitutes gambling under the laws of any applicable jurisdiction, without authorization.
---
It is prohibited to use the platform for commercial purposes including gathering in-game currency for sale outside the Platform or Game(s).
---
Buying gold is not a commercial purpose nor are you selling anything.
---
I was thinking food such as vegetables and carbs that can be made a re-heated. My point is that for one person you can prepare enough food at one time so you can eat for a day or two without cooking too much. I don't see how that means someone has a poor diet. Omelette is a bad example.

Are there any alternative ISPs available to you? Of what ive heard of Virgin, their state of operations isnt exactly stellar.
---
Guess she finally bought that private island in the carribean
---
Who doesn't like quick access to FAP tho tbh
---
The Tailoring bonus does not give you +hit, it gives you +crit. And that's not BoP.
---
Except it‚Äôs 0.2% per point for 1-4 and 1.2% more for point 5. That‚Äôs relevant because it makes things like Maladath even worse.
---
Also, that's not even the current EULA.
---
"Reason for Closure: Terms of Use Violation -- Exploitative Activity: Abuse of the Economy
---
This account was closed because one or more characters were identified exchanging, or contributing to the exchange of, in-game property (items or gold) for "real-world" currency. This exchange process negatively impacts the World of Warcraft game environment by detracting from the value of the in-game economy."
---
It's literally considering abusing the economy. That's was part of an email someone got after being banned for buying gold. I'm done arguing with you, because clearly you're an idiot. You will get banned for buying gold, and since it's clear YOU plan on buying gold in Classic, enjoy the ban.
---
There are clear downsides to it. Its not just a metter of preference
---
What we were getting at was - with layering, you'll never run into the same group(s) of people - you'll always be meeting new faces; which sounds great, but you lose out on the experience of leveling along the same time/path as someone; and keep running into them, friend or foe.
---
The best part about Classic was the social aspect, and part of that was running into players who were playing at the same time/zones you were.
---
Also, it means that low/mid level experiences, won't properly translate into end level reputation - as in, "hey, I've seen that guy before; he was cool/not cool, I should interact with him some more; oh man, I remember when he/she X" - everyone essentially starts fresh reputations at 60.
---
How dare people encourage others to play the class they want to. /s
---
We should assume everyone has a backbone made of papertowel and will fold under the pressure of conformity at the first sign of rain /s
---
Omg u r so good at the game.
---
I have to agree with sweetpapisanchez here. Horde are definitely not the bad guys.
---
They are just trying to make their way in this crazy hateful world where all the more humanoid races are all out to kill them.
---
Reddit had been a fucking goldmine of resources and advice, plus solid discussion.

Stop being contrarian for no reason.

If you strive to become filthy rich from farming, hunter is your main.
---
"One thing is certain : Warriors are the optimal tanks during progression, as Deep Prot specced with mitigation gear, they are the optimal tank during raid farming, as Impale Prot specced in threat gear, and the optimal tank during raid fast clears (or easy farming) as DW Fury Prot specced."
---
The current thought for classic is that Impale tanking is basically dead with the loss of crit. Do you have any reason to claim that what you wrote above is "certain"?
---
I've seen this guy in multiple threads today.  Either they are getting a kick out of trying to bait people, or they need supervision to use a computer.
---
Played warlock through late vanilla all the way until WotLK. Distinctly remember going from only me, then one other warlock around T4, two more in T5, and then in sunwell we had 6 fucking warlocks.
---
Good times.
---
Mages are my favorite class in terms of pvp playstyle and I don't want to be the same as everyone else so I am rolling female troll. Underrated race imo and berserking is nice for pve / some pvp situations. Don't need wotf cause tremor totem
---
There was also the talent rework which was 1.8 I think.
---
Questing on an empty server is 1.5 - 2 hours for level 10, correct.
---
Launch will not be an empty server.
---
If you want to fight over tags and low drop rate items for several hours, you do you. Have fun. I'll be over here doing my thing, tho.
---
Virgin have by far the best service where I live unfortunately
---
Lots of it is wrong.  Patching for instance, the thing you mentioned, is one of the worst.
---
I was 12 irl. It was my first character. I was a mage. His fucking pet by itself ripped through me like toilet paper. And he did it for what felt like a month +
---
I didnt even know there was a comparable leveling zone on easter kingdoms. I just thought I had to suck it. And so I did. Bastard would sit on the watch tower. And he was good enough at PvP to like 1v4 or 5 most random toons from org. Bastard would constantly kill the flight master and every vendor...

JK, that's neat.
---
Cool.  Do you know what you are arguing?  
---
Raiding is choreography.  Not a math problem.  People learned the moves long ago.  There is nothing left to adapt to.
---
So you are claiming that everyone who has ever played on a private server has the optimal leveling routes mastered and will be able to do them by heart?
---
the topic was pvp and not leveling
---
I would say, do the research on your class choice. Alot of people roll druid/paladin/shaman expecting something other than to be a heal bot in raids, and end up either un-happy, or wasting alot of time. 
---
Educate yourself on classes.
---
    6. Questie is one of the absolute best addons for classic. 
---
People who lie to you and say it is fun trying to find the one random quest in the middle of nowhere that you need to move on to the next zone are lying to you.
---
Never claimed that. I actually think warriors will be more difficult. Pretty well known how much skill a warrior takes. It also happens to be what my vanilla experience was on. 
---
Vanilla warrior actually had a good complexity compared to retail. I do not think the majority will grasp it properly. 
---
Side note: how u get the druid icon? XD

Played shaman for like a decade.

How?
---
It's bordering on not even being piracy because you're not stealing from anybody.  If you play pservers after classic is out, then sure, you're hurting the creator of the IP and that's clearly piracy.
---
Good eye, mate.

I suppose I should mouseover names and assess karma to avoid replying to trolls lol

For the EULA nerds who don't personally know ban cases, here's an excerpt from the CoC:
---
&gt;If you come across a player violating the policies below, you should report them. -- Cheating in any fashion will result in immediate action. -- engaging in any activity that grants an unfair advantage is considered cheating. -- anything else that may degrade the gaming experience for other players will receive harsh penalties. -- (from dropdown below) Blizzard suspends or bans accounts for violations of our Code of Conduct.
---
If you get reported, you can be banned for gold buying. They just don't investigate directly any more.
---
Hunter 5/31/15
---
Wow that's a pretty unique find! Did your buddy do it himself or pay someone else to do it and just didn't want the thing anymore?
---
Very cool idea, brings back some great memories.  Thank you!
---
Sappers + Chicken if nothing else is bis
---
If you do the troll village after starting zone you are doing it wrong btw
---
Except chance to hit reduces your chance to miss and has no effect on parries.
---
Not when clique-healing, mouse-over healing, or clicking portraits to use default healing.
---
Nothing you do in the game is "illegal". Don't throw that word around.
---
And if Blizzard meant the EULA to forbid gold buying AND gold selling, they would have implemented language that didn't just mention gold selling.
---
A good excuse for an upgrade/rebuild
---
Thank God my gf understands this concept as a fellow citizen of Azeroth.

You realize there's an entire community of players that want to min/max everything right? It *is* a math problem.
---
Well said
---
That's a dope wallet!
---
The only winning move is to not play.
---
You can not legally download a 1.12 version of world of warcraft. That alone is piracy. It doesn‚Äôt matter if that‚Äôs not the updated version of the game that people currently play. You are illegally playing a game that is owned by someone else.
---
With the exception for casters, engineering is the only profession that can buff your numbers; especially in early game
---
Ret has no buffs they provide that no other spec can.  They have improved Blessing of Might, which is usually ignored and easily available to any spec.
---
Protection has Blessing of Kings, and I can't remember if Blessing of Sanctuary was in Vanilla or added in TBC.
---
Holy has Improved Blessing of Wisdom, which is sometimes grabbed.  Ret and Protection have access to it.
---
All of them have Blessing of Freedom, Blessing of Protection, Blessing of Light, Blessing of Salvation, and Blessing of Sacrifice.
---
People very much did not know how to play feral tank in vanilla. Nobody knew what the actual Bis was, nobody used manual crowd pummeler, but most of all druid tanks were pretty bad until the vanilla talent rework later in vanilla, which coloured a lot of peoples experiences with druid tanks.
---

Wow that is extraordinarily detailed. I'm hoping it won't come to having to be cheesy like that, but I bookmarked it just in case, thanks.

At this point I've got nostalgia oozing out of my pores. It's hard to contain!
---
They're very useful in raids.
---
I havrnt figured out how to turn with mouse without moving forward a step. How do you doit? Is it with click to move?
---
Actually druids are much easier to play, you press 3 buttons and don't need to stance dance for abilities.
---
&gt; That alone is piracy.
---
It's not though.  Please find me where it says it is even illegal, but legality =/ piracy anyways.
---
Unlawful use or reproduction also =/ downloading something.
---
Oh great decider of arbitrary internet cookies, I will adhere to your strict guidelines and humbly await your approval. /bow
---
No?  Do I need to add strawman to the list of fallacies you keep using?
---
Yeah, instead you have Clique allowing you to either alt-click, ctrl-click, shift-click a bunch of spells... and repeat for every other mouse button you have. On an HD monitor showing very clearly what other healers are doing. Oh yeah don't forget weakauras showing you whatever else you aren't getting from your healer frames.
---
Blizzard has a blatant 0 tolerance policy for private servers. They are not okay with them. Playing on one is using blizzards game without their permission. 
---
Again, piracy is ‚Äúthe unauthorized use or reproduction of another's work.‚Äù

How did we ever use dial-up for WoW? Doesn't at all seem fast enough to carry the connection an MMO needs
---
I'm not the one claiming that for some reason people who have played on private servers have some inherent advantage over anyone else.
---
Plan is to let the pack get ahead of me.  Avoid the chaos of the first couple days, then taking Thursday Friday off from work.  But it's more to have dedicated time to play than to race.  Goal is to enjoy the journey as well as the destination.

---
Your better then a warrior when both in pre bis,  warriors win in bwl gear and druids best them in aq40 then warrior only passes them when they get t3 + thunderfury if they are 2t and thunderfury they are about equal
---
You realize beating a boss 32 minutes ahead of others isn't "wiping the floor" with other players?  Right?  
---
You realize shuffling around stats for 1.3% more DPS isn't a hallmark of adaptation?  Right?
---
Conquering new content is adaptation.  Discovering new PvP teams because of balance patching is adaptation.  
---
This, at best, is refining.
---
It's my backup plan. My pally 1-10 time on a private repack is 1:42 - if shit's bad in the first 10 minutes or so, I'll switch over to FedEx. It's just so chill.
---
You can use sappers, pots and healthstones in form in classic thanks to the macro system. And half of these points are pretty dubious, how is "sometimes can't battle rez/innervate while actively tanking" a downside when warriors can't do those things at all?
---
Elemental is just fine with nice blue gear at 60.  I played the hell out of wow when it first launched, and I never did any of that raiding crap.  I just did BGs, got some battle ground gear, reputation gear, and the best stuff i could find in 5 mans.  I world pvped all the time and found a lot of success and fun.  My favorite way to play was sneaking into iron forge w/ a pocket full of invis. potions and sneaking around causing trouble.  My gear worked just fine.  Win some lose some but it was always fun.
---
Yikes if this is true, starter areas are going to be shitshows. Lets hope dynamic respawns are a thing, and are near instant.
---
I was completely out of the loop on that, thanks! Gotta get them early name saves
---
You're my classicpedia now. It's your own fault, you answered too many questions.
---
None of those numbers are taken at level 60 in proper raid gear, consumes and buffs. I dont think you are this dumb. You know its not going to be a 30% loss at end game but you cling to the 30% bc it fits your narrative. You wrote so much and didnt address this at all. 
---
But you are quick to point out that mobs being easier at lvl 1-40 doesnt mean raid bosses will be easier at level 60. You dont get to have it both ways.
---
The reality is we dont know how much crit is lost, but likely less than 30%
---
Or Luna with mouseover macros
---
Yeah, I'm not confused on that.  Having an advantage is a little different from:
---
&gt; everyone who has ever played on a private server has the optimal leveling routes mastered and will be able to do them by heart
---
Not for speedrunners it isn't, which is the only hardcore version of the game left for Classic.
---
I took the time to become a high warlord back on Mannoroth (reborndevil before someone took over the account).  Not exactly something I look back at fondly.  Caused me to also nearly fail a course in college -\_-.
---
Not much, I think it's pretty safe to roll any class you want for PVE.
---
We'll just have to wait and see what blizz comes up with.  It would be nice if they did include the API though, would make a lot of nice web tools like guild rosters and tradeskill searching and more.
---
Hotel=trivago
---
That feeling when you see wyverns/griffons but no flight master and you open map to see if it's close enough to run to next flight master or just wait for it to respawn.
---
EULA expresses it is forbidden to cheat and give yourself an unfair advantage over other players.  Which is what buying gold is.  It's against EULA.
---
So we admit there's no more adaptation, just refining.  Thanks.
---
Throwing a Shadow Word: Pain is pretty quick.
---
&gt; With multiple other sources to gain DKP there is no way to know how the other players got their DKP.

But doesn‚Äôt tag the mob until it deals damage. Something like fire blast will tag it immediately.

That's fine.  I have enough people telling me how much of an idiot I am, I might as well have a protoge to balance things out.

Nice to know! Same trinkets share cooldowns I guess?

He recently started leveling leatherworking irl (couple months ago), this is only the second wallet he‚Äôs ever made.  It feels really sturdy and smooth, the pockets inside fitting my cards/cash firmly and securely.
---
Pretty funny, I was having connection issues on Xbox Live and when I was talking I would cut out while I was speaking so if I was saying "Guys, I think I'm gonna DC soon", it sounded like "Guys, - think - gon - C - oon.".
---
They thought it was hilarious. Wish I could hear the whole conversation myself.
---
I figured this out in the beta I do not have room for that ice cold milk I don't use mana anyway!
---
Well boss you see the doc says that it's metastasized to my uh organs and I'm going to need time off starting Aug 26th 1500 PST...
---
I think this is just "counter-elitism" to combat the few PServer elites that are going around saying that they will have MC on farm by week 2.  Idk I'm kinda sad to see the WoW community spiting up in a borderline tribalistic way but I suppose it is to be expected in modern day gaming or culture in general...
---
&gt; legal definition of piracy
---
Which is?  
---
&gt; people have been fined for playing private servers..
---
Again, legality =/ piracy.  Stop implying that being punished for doing something illegal inherently means it is because of piracy. 
---
&gt; Playing patch 1.12 on a server that isn‚Äôt blizzards is piracy. Plain and simple
---
This may shock you, but I never said it wasn't.  I said "It's bordering on not even being piracy because you're not stealing from anybody", because you're not taking money away from Blizzard when they weren't going to capture it in the first place.  It's a really nuanced and complicated thought, I know, but I believe if you read it a few times and try really hard you'll understand it eventually.
---
&gt; Just ask Esfand 
---
I totally didn't know he was a piracy litigator.
---
congrats on being a cheater i guess? *golfclap*
---
You get flagged only in enemy capital cities, otherwise alliance running to SM on PvE servers would still have a rough time.
---
Horde tauren warrior. 
---
I'm mainly focusing on the barren quests like collecting the supply crate and best places to farm quilboars.
---
I used WoW Model Viewer &amp; Sony Vegas to put this together. Went to a spot in Felwood to get the empty background shots, used WoW Model Viewer to get the character animations, then keyframed the movements in Sony Vegas (as well as color corrected/chroma key).
---
I think I'm confused by what you mean.
---
Gear doesn't reeeeeeally matter that much in PvP.
---
Raw stats doesn't help as much as being good. You could roll up in WSG in blues and likely be able to take me (prot warrior) in T2+ with some patience.
---
So to answer your question T1 can carry you the whole game if you're good.
---
If you're not good, T3 won't help...
---
If you're average well T1 will be good as long as your opponent is in T1.

What did you do for 29 minutes after that?
---
I think a lot of the people complaining about PServer players don't realize that we really outta be thanking them for working so diligently on a project with no reason to believe blizzard would support their cause.
---
There‚Äôs been inflation since then,
---
The phases only matter for itemization and raid content, not things like UI. I don't know why it wasn't in the Beta, but it was in 1.12 and should be in Classic at launch.
---
Which is pretty obviously untrue.  I'm glad we've circled completely back around to square one.
---
I hope you mean 2005 or else I have no idea what year we are in
---
Most warrior tanks are complete garbage and druid tanking is painfully simple. The average player is going to get an awakening when nobody will let them tank.
---
I like it. Can you only find things by searching or will you add a filter so we can just cross what we want to see?
---
Considered cheating *by who*?
---
Nothing wrong with that I was just trying to provide the op with my experience. There is no right answer.  My experience is suboptimal specs were for alts.  That doesn't make my perspective right or your opinion wrong.
---
Relevant in that a rogue gladly ambushes a mage not running barrier ;)
---
The lifespan of your gear will be determined by your skill. I had T1 in vanilla and I would win the vast majority of my duels even if the opponent was in T3. Play smart in a BG or WPvP and you'll still be contributing effectively.
---
Alliance filth
---
It's not against the eula since the token was introduced, in all likelihood it will be bannable in classic.
---
You know you've won the battle when the person you are debating deletes their own comment.
---
You can call it cheating all you want, but Blizzard doesn't and theirs is the only authority that matters. Not having to clean, cook, or drive isn't cheating, it's just the reward for working hard and being smart about opportunity.
---
PUGs will have MC on "farm" by week 2.  LOL
---
Dang, dude.  I saw the channel as a cool story, and I see full clears of a tough raid.  Probably pretty close to what an average naxx raider's experience is going to be.  But you can interpret it however you want I guess.
---
&gt;However if that's not your plan, then I highly doubt it's "required" just probably "appreciated"
---
I think you might rethink your position once your tanks shield slam miss on Vaelastrasz during the first second of the fight : )
---
buying gold is against the rules and you will get banned for it if tehy find it out. only way to get gold for rl money is buying tokens with money and selling it. but that not a thing for classic.
---
You did it! Now you get the tranq shot!
---
Lol yes buying gold with real world money is against the rules in classic.
---
However - blizzard has said one way or another how they feel about person A giving person B enough gold to buy a wow token in retail and then person B giving person A gold in classic.
---
We'll have to wait and see!
---
How hard is to understand that the larger supply will be offset by larger demand?
---
Man.. you all have these nice memories of old WoW. I played a different MMORPG at that time. Far less quality and complex. I wish I was there. But.. now I can experience it with my family.
---
Those changes are going to MAGNIFIED once classic releases as well. For instance parry chance on PServer is somewhere around 4.something % and on Classic Blizzard has confirmed its actually MUCH closer to 14-15% for bosses.  This is fundamentally change the raids due to threat generation.
---
Patterns like that are pressed, not carved, no?
---
Not sticking around for that Tiger boss kill... It was getting late, so I logged out. The mount dropped that night.
---
Blizzard doesn't have separate EULAs for their games.
---
Nope, new server names like Field of Strife... rip bud.
---
Warriors are just all around more powerful in classic. Warlock is good, but not much could really compete with the burst of warriors.
---
It's not invalid because you've played private servers, it's invalid if you've ONLY played private servers.
---
There are massive differences in the most basic systems and values and most definitely in the more complicated ones. Boss parry is a great example of a basic one that private servers managed to fuck up missing out on a whopping 9% parry. Onyxias deep breath is an example of a complex one where we don't know how it works, just that it's wrong on private servers.
---
If you played at a high level during actual vanilla you know what you're talking about, you can even point out a lot of things wrong with private servers just by experiencing the game. If you've only played private servers and claim that they're 99% perfect or whatever bullshit number people pull out of their asses then kindly GTFO.
---
Consider how many groundbreaking errors were found out during a short 1-40 beta because morons kept insisting that private servers had it right. Imagine how many are still out there that people just haven't started bitching about yet.
---
And then there's the whole part where they on purpose ruin core design philosophies like the server caps even though they have multiple Blizzard devs confirming that it was a crucial design decision. They just don't give a fuck about preserving or emulating anything the way it was.
---
LOL 90% the server wont even be ATTUNED by week 2...wut?
---
I mean they do still have mana shield but yea
---
Between Shadow Weaving and Improved Shadowbolt you push each others damage quite significant.
---
I'm just providing the view that you should play what you really want to play, and not worry about if you will be allowed to raid or not.  There will be *loads* of people who aren't doing the optimal build, and I'm sure there will be plenty of opportunities to raid with them.  Plus if you wind up 60 and can't raid, you can always respec.  There's no point in missing out on 1-60 fun as the spec you want to be.
---
For all the people that say 'the game starts at 60', you need to remember that there is a *lot* of gameplay before you hit 60.
---
I hate you so much. I know I can't spend 120‚Ç¨ on that right now and I already have a pretty decent wallet. But this.. it's gorgeous.
---
Because the demand won't be proportional, and layers won't be of equal sizes??
---
Read the EULA, it does not mention gold buying.
---
Look for a Blue post on gold buying, you won't find one.
---
In any case, that 30,000 gold is going to be laundered through so many accounts that Blizzard would have to ban half the server before they found me out.
---
No it brings it down the 6%. Your chance to miss is 8%, not 9.
---
i agree but the current speculation is that blizz is considering the keyring an item and not a UI interface per-say and as such making it phase 6.  But there have been no comments from blizz about the keyring. It's not in the "known bugs".. the "not a bug".. or any other interview questions ever asked about the keyring.  I know I reported it as a bug in the beta for sure.
---
It's not specifically called out in the EULA, and Blizz doesn't care that much. That said if you're reported under CoC for it you can be banned.
---
The letter of the thing is irrelevant, personal experience shows this happening as recently as Legion.
---
Hard for me to care post-coin, but if you do this in classic you're exactly as much of a PoS as you would've been back then.
---
Banning gold buyers is good for the game, and the report tool is the only way that happens.
---
This post again?
---
No.
---
Go buy some coloring books or something to pass the time.
---
&gt; buying gold is against the rules and you will get banned for it if tehy find it out. 
---
You are thinking of expertise. Which wasn't introduced until TBC. You could only lower chance to parry with an ability or talent.
---
Cross my fingers that ill be the first to log in to the server
---
&gt; Lol yes buying gold with real world money is against the rules in classic.
---
I'm definitely going to take my time finding a good guild on the server, and not accept invites from any old guild (and guilds mostly say all the same things in their guild ads, so it's hard to tell which are the good ones).
---
I made that mistake in a more recent MMO, where I was guildless, resulting in constant guild invite spam from random guilds wanting one more warm body.   I joined some guy's small guild just to put a stop to guild invite spam, and pointed out I am just trying it out and may leave if it wasn't for me.  Unfortunately, he became completely possessive when I decided to leave.  It's better to be guildless than to join some random shitty guild.
---
New layers will be created as more people log in. I'm not sure you know how layering will work.
---
I think it was punkrat or metagoblin who made a guide on it. (On youtube)
---
All right. Lets take carbs, spaguetti.
---
Cooking time is the same for 100g spaguetti than 500g Spaguetti. Also 1L bolognese takes the same shimmering time than half a litre. See my point now? 
---
Sorry for metric system
---
I agree. The only time I'd think that spec would be actually advisable is maybe in AV if youre able to be a DPS turret behind a wall of melee. 
---
Other you give up too much survivability.
---
Yes you can.  The game is meant to be played how you want so enjoy it.  If you are casual you‚Äôll have a ton of fun doing dungeons and bg‚Äôs.  If you intend to raid join a guild that will let you play Shadow (there will be plenty) or just pug Raids.  I used to pug all the time in Vanilla but being in the military my schedule was all over the place.  I played Holy and Shadow. In Vanilla.! When I was Shadow specced I had no problem popping out of Shadow form to heal.  The problem is there is wayyyyy more elitism now then there was previously so everyone has something negative to say about certain specs and their viability.  If you are an awesome Shadow Priest, know your class, have a great reputation on your server, you will find groups and will have a ton of fun.  I wish you luck man.
---
Arthas is best server
---
And items like the AQ 1h mace, bonereaver's edge Mc 2h, maladath 1h sword BWL, edgemaster gloves, MC leather gloves (+daggers) etc
---
Yes you can get banned permanently i know this because i received a ban after moving large sums of gold through multiple accounts and different battle nets Blizz removed the ban after i contacted them and proved all the account were mine.
---
We've already been testing our raids at 14% parry chance in preparation for a week one Rag kill. Like I said, Pserver players adapt.
---
But the 10% that are will be a mishmash of guilds with stragglers and lone 60s, forming half PUGs to run MC.  And guess what?  I know this might be shocking.  But MC will be on farm by them as well.  Because MC was long ago mastered, and playing MC on 1.12 will be an utter joke.
---
Taco bell resets my insides.
---
Exactly. So if 200 extra people try to login to your server that is full, guess what? They will get a new layer, meaning a new devilsaur, meaning demand isn't proportional meaning a fucked up economy.
---
Do you want this in simpler terms love?
---
Why? You should only really be going for soft-cap, especially as a tank. As long as you're taking damage, you are probably gonna have excess rage. As long as you have excess rage, you should be using heroic strike. And as long as you are using heroic strike, you will not have much white damage.
---
Yes,  fuck buying gold.
---
Was going to mention that reputation matters and I don't mean the one you can track on your xp bar. Glad to see it's the top comment.
---
Best guess is to around the start of p4
---
Unfortunately prot pallies only take off in BC.  You can tank 5 mans just fine in classic but anything more is unlikely.  Still if you enjoy paladins and don't mind healing in larger raids then go with that.  Tanking as feral is more viable due to having 2 taunts, and feral spec can be pretty versatile overall.
---
Winners of what?
---
I didn't say they did have separate EULAs
---
Blizzard hasn't been specific about what items will be phased. Several interviews suggest quest hubs like Hinterlands and Thorium Point will be in the game at launch, which would mean some items that would be phased in a hard and fast rule are in fact not.
---
Really, you let shadow raid for the shadow weaving buff.  They're not really providing any significant DPS gains.  I'd only say for Loatheb and the healing it could be a thought if you have a strong enough Spriest.
---
Pvp servers just add time to everything in the open world.
---
Are there exciting encounters? Sure... do they warrant the warrant the dozens - hundreds of hours added to open world questing / farming? 
---
For me that's a no - there are too many games out there current and in the future that I want to play.
---
So if I play classic for 10 months and in that time 50 hours is tacked on to me herbing (even though this increases the price) - that's 50 hours I could have been doing literally anything else.
---
So it's all up to you - for me BGs are enough for me to enjoy PvP in World of Warcraft Classic.
---
[Go here](https://www.vanillafriends.com/)
---
Edit: vanillawowfriends (:
---
Then you understand that buying gold will not be against the EULA of Classic.
---
I think you start as friendly, and the discounts don't roll in until Honored. You start 100/6000 with everyone except your home faction, which starts at 1000/6000
---
Most guilds actually deny applications from private server players because they don't want that kind of toxicity in their guild.
---
I plan on utilizing some fine high grade crystal methamphetamine to get ahead of the pack
---
Theres no better tank for 5mans than a solid and correctly geared Dire Bear.
---
PvP doesnt end on flag carry. Apart from healing, you cant do offensive support. Faerie fire rogues, spam roots on your Warrior targets, Insect swarm and whatnot.
---
 \-Druid with MCP vs Impale Prot Warrior in mitigation gear : Equal threat for most fights. 
---
 \-Druid with MCP vs Impale Prot Warrior in threat gear : Equal threat for most fights. 
---
Yeah this does not add up at all no matter how you look at it. Someone over here is just a Warrior fanboy who wants to be able to say they can have similar threat. Any REAL warrior tank worth his salt would never claim to have higher threat than an MCP Druid no matter what, unless you are Fury/DW and even then it's about equal if not slightly in Druid's favor.
---
You got banned because Blizzard suspected you of selling gold, not buying it.
---
Streamers will get past login queue first - and I'll be playing with my friends probably 2 hours after 6pm EDT.
---
All depends on final stress test - neither we or blizzard knows since they pushed it back.
---
That‚Äôs what I figured. Just wasn‚Äôt sure if it gets to a point where other classes in higher gear tiers won‚Äôt take any damage. Multi shot in AV sounds like itl be alota fun with essential +30% dmg to it.
---
Mage or priest ? Even though I've never played wow, I'm the one organizing a group of friends so I'll end up creating the guild as well. I want a more active role so I'm thinking priest. Could even be THE spriest if I wanted. Thoughts?
---
Taunt is on Spellhit, not melee hit ;)
---
College isn't.
---
To be fair to the guy. Warriors are a whole lot more complex. Fury is about constant desicion-making. When should you switch to Battle Stance to Overpower, when should you ignore the Overpower proc because it'd be inefficient to lose that much rage etc.
---
But then again, they're by far the most complex vanilla pve rotation.
---
No gold buyer is going to give players the opportunity to report them, nor do you have any evidence that those reports would result in anything.
---
Think it will take 2 hours max - I'm also edt and depending on layering - we might be able to hit 12-15 before midnight :)
---
What brand of tin foil do u wear?
---
Everything? ^(/s)
---
You've set yourself up for a win/win. Good strategy my dude.
---
Didn‚Äôt know if it gets to a point where if someone in T3 will just destroy you regardless of skill because I‚Äôm in T1 and can‚Äôt keep up. I doubt I‚Äôll ever see AQ40 or Naxx. Would like to play a class that can get good gear early on and will stay relevant through later phases.
---
Come ZG patch you'll be hit capped or at 9% depending on your ring usage. Any main Mage using Bloodvine 3 piece  either doesn't know how to itemize or is fairly casual ie. not clearing raids every week or knowing what items to get etc. 
---
Bloodvine is the perfect items to grab for a casual player or alt caster.
---
buying gold is indeed bannable if you buy from anyone other than blizzard
---
I just want to be a cat. Group me in with the rogues for +3%
---
That's all. Bear dungeons but Cat in raids.
---
Low effort and minmaxing don't go together boss.
---
still will probably be bannable
---
&gt;You listed things that have nothing to do with balance. 
---
One of the things they limited is targeting totems. That most definitely has something to do with balance. 
---
&gt;The balance will be 1.12 balance, we've known for a very long time they won't be doing progressive balance patches.
---
Yes. We have known that it won't be truely blizzlike for quite a while now. 
---
&gt;The experience will be the same as it was for someone who started in one of the later patches.
---
Not exactly since they would have had access to all of the raids, and been carried through them. This time around they will see the same talents and abilities. That part is true. The content that is available to them will be completely different.
---
my dad = love  
---
this video = not love
---
I never mentioned the rest of the Bloodvine set...
---
Fear ward. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
I remember logging in to WoW at 10:00 am one morning to check the auction house, before going to work (software engineer hours) and seeing my friend on (same company).
---
Me: "Hey, you're on!"
---
Him: "Shouldn't you be at work too?"
---
not junk food
---
that's for fat people
---
Everyone has their own launch plans. I‚Äôve got a route of my own I‚Äôm looking forward to following. The biggest thing for me is grabbing a few flightpaths early and grabbing skinning/mining. 
---
Since I‚Äôm playing warrior the getting ahead of the pack falls closer to setting myself up early to succeed. Professions for food and money. Other than that I‚Äôll enjoy a nice cruise control esq experience.
---
I‚Äôm counting on spending 80% of the time between 6:00PM and 11:00PM offline spamming the login button as the server crashes multiple multiple times, etc.  and 20% actually getting to play.  5-6 in an hour given expected congestion sounds realistic to me.  If everything runs smooth and I‚Äôm able to level further than it‚Äôs just icing on the cake.  Just trying to temper my expectations based on all of the MMO launches I‚Äôve experienced over the years.
---
Unlikely. They used to send out a "please don't buy gold again, it might come from accounts that are hacked" email, but they don't even do that anymore.
---
are you a gold seller or???
---
I had this happen in Cata on the dragon Atramedes. Pulled with heroic throw - miss. Hit with shield slam - miss, auto attack, hits, heroic strike - miss. Mage pulls agro and wipes.
---
Hit is pretty damn important üëç
---
Eh and people say lw is useless
---
Yea it is more fun not knowing the rules. 
---
Formulating the quickest way through each zone, optimizing leveling spec, etc etc? Yea we do it that way because we already had the "go in blind" experience and had a fucking adventure. The first time through, I explored the world as I see fit, not streamlining the experience to do as little work as possible just to get it all done. Yea my shit was a mess, I was probably an aweful player, but I had fun. 
---
What came next was formulaic and rehearsed. Which was fine because I already knew what was out there and how it worked. 
---
Your not stupid for going in blind. I envy that you get to experience WoW from the perspective I had when I was 13/14. It was an adventure. Not some min/max race bullshit
---
Their healing does well enough, but their totems are definitely useful.
---
In a 40 man raid, you're going to want a variety of healing. They aren't the best at any one specific type of healing, but they're great for veratility.
---
Someone did this the other day arguing with me. Linked an article he only read the headline of, then the third paragraph 100% backed my side of the argument.
---
It wouldn't be vanilla if we had server stability and controlled populations.  :)
---
I'll be leaving work at 3PM on 8/26 to be ready for the 5PM launch.  I expect that the servers will crash multiple times, and that for when they are up, leveling will be very difficult.  If so, I'll probably take a nap for an hour or so and come back to see if its up and running.  If I'm at level 10 by midnight, I'll be very pleased, but I'm not expecting it.  
---
I'm off work until 9/4, so I'm hopeful that stability will come quick, and I can get to my goal of level 40 by the time I go back to work (level 45 stretch goal).  I figure I'll do mainly solo questing, grouping up where necessary to complete elite quests or dungeons.

You might want to read blizzards page on copyright infringement: https://www.blizzard.com/en-us/legal/0f4d7809-ac0c-453c-a28b-003d77aac798/copyright-infringement-notice 
---
People have been spreading the rumor that it‚Äôs legal to play on private servers for years now but copyright infringement laws have made it clear that if you unlawfully download their client/game, and play it at all you‚Äôre committing copyright infringement. Even if you own an original CD, the second you log in to a server that isn‚Äôt Blizzards and play free of cost, you are committing copyright infringement.
---
Also, again legally speaking, you are taking money directly from blizzard by playing a private server. World of warcraft is still world of warcraft despite massive changes to the game. A player who obtains and plays without paying a subscription fee is a player who would otherwise be paying to play World of Warcraft and is a loss to blizzard. 
---
And, lastly. If you thought I meant Esfand was a copyright litigator you‚Äôre a fucking moron. It doesn‚Äôt take a brain to realize i was referencing his Fine and Twitch Ban....
---
Was bannable then, will be bannable now.
---
I did the exact same thing but i tried to get back up, unaware that I could ress at the graveyard, so I made the exact same character and started from scratch.
---
well yeah thats in the post token era 
---
but classic wont have the token as far as we know anyway
---
MC is going to be done by the "first to 60" crowd for sure.
---
But BWL and beyond still have somewhat of a race on release.  But BWL, AQ and Naxx are all pretty straight forward and knowing the content before hand means you can farm stuff early like shadow resist for twin emps, nature resist for Huhuran,  tank gear for Patchwerk, etc.
---
It will still be a race on the phase releases for raids, but in a "who can speed run it first" race.  The rest is going to be how fast a raid can clear the content once it's on farm.
---
Nah, idk if you were around for BFA but it mostly took an hour to an hour and a half for stability... but of course a couple servers got hit with being down for like a whole day.
---
If it was a different company I'd say yeah it's going to take the whole night, but blizzard knows how to do it :)
---
Just as you talk shit on reddit, guildies talk shit in game. If they're smart they can dodge reporting, but not all will especially if they think it's NBD.
---
No evidence, but I know for a fact a guildie was banned within 24hrs after bragging in a BG and they claim it was related.
---
If you want to undermine the game, that's your prerogative.
---
My fault there.
---
No need to criticize skarms content. He tanked in actually vanilla as well and is very transparent of the differences. Also idk why this guy even referenced skarm because skarm says in his own videos about 500 times Druid is super meme and he only did it to prove he could. It‚Äôs unrealistic 99% of the time.
---
In WoW beta on the PvP server, there was this alliance Paladin called Minn.  Used to see her all the time in Hillsbrad and other big world PvP battles.  She would heal and support her allies.  I was a shadow priest, and would make a beeline to mana burn her to the ground, but she would always shove her Hammer off Justice up my ass at the worst possible times.
---
I told my beloved pc he has to survive 6 months more until i get Money. 1 month vacation, coming Home, boom that mofo doesnt respond a bit. Gonna repair him one more time for 100 bucks. Hope he survives if not i need a new one. That would be the epitome of vanila feeling since i bought my pc only to play wow back then.
---
Personally I still use Grid but I feel like I'm in a minority these days. It hasn't had any major updates or changes in a while. I think a lot of people use VuhDo.
---
Now I need somebody to set something this detailed up for Horde :p.
---
&gt; Yes. We have known that it won't be truely blizzlike for quite a while now.
---
1.12 is truly blizzlike.
---
&gt;Not exactly since they would have had access to all of the raids, and been carried through them. This time around they will see the same talents and abilities. That part is true. The content that is available to them will be completely different.
---
The experience will be essentially the same as a fresh server launched during 1.12 would be, with time gating of some things.  Balance will be exactly the same.
---
Its appreciated to alliance ,but its required forbhorde tanks iirc. Because of shamans and that wonderfull wf totem l
---
Content that was included in those patches would *presumably* only become available when that phase launches.
---
&gt;Now, I‚Äôve looked up guides about casual PvE Shadow Priest and lower end raiding to learn more about the spec. Most of them say that raids won‚Äôt take one until later on into ZG/AQ/Naxx.
---
So this comes from private servers, and the reason this was true was prior to ZG mobs only had 8 debuff slots. Private servers have long tried to emulate "patch progression" so it was common to see, that they would lower the debuff slots to 8 till ZG came out. In classic we are starting with 16 debuffs which allows the Shadow Priest to appropriately keep up shadow weaving and shadow word: pain, were as with 8 slots there just isn't't the room for you.
---
&gt;I‚Äôm just asking for someone who has more experience with the game if I‚Äôll actually be able to experience stuff like Molten Core.
---
People aren't likely to take MC super seriously, if that's all your looking for, just grind out a rune douse and people will bring you for that alone.
---
&gt;Also how is the Situation with dungeons? Is it hard to find a group who will allow a DPS Shadow Priest? Should I just choose another class?
---
You shouldn't have a problem getting into 5 mans as a DPS honestly. Shadow doesn't actually do vad DPS (at least early on) you're actually the only caster that gets a free 10% hit for your shadow spells (mages get 3 and warlocks 0) So in all honesty before ZG and later AQ were +spell hit becomes abundant, your actually likely to out preform other casters if your good.
---
To kind of carry on from that, I should point out. Spriests scale poorly. Mind Flay only nets you a 45% spellpower coefficient (so if you had 100 bonus SP, Mind Flay would treat you as having only 45), Mind Blast is 50% (IIRC), Shadow Word: Pain is actually your best scaling spell at 100%. I can go a bit into why spell coefficients end up screwing spriests (The TLDR is Utility over DPS)
---
The TL:DR of Shadow Priest DPS, is Grr Mind Flay Slowing Effect, Its really only in latter content where the fights last more then a few minutes that spriests suffer from mana instabiliy, you can do a lot to counter it. But you will run dry long before a mage or an infinite mana warlock ever will.
---
Like I said, icing on the cake if so.  Would rather take a hope for the best, plan for the worst approach myself.
---
it is a ploy to get the clicks
---
No - I'm the guy that has already bought 30,000 gold in OP's post. But I am considering a more serious investment in some of the companies planning to sell gold in Classic.
---
Which is why my poor decrepit warrior ass is leveling with the wife‚Äôs mage! Because day 1, tagging anything will make me drink.
---
I didn't say it would be against the EULA, I said it would probably be bannable. The EULA is not the only way blizzard enforces rules
---
Gotta love burning the mana away from a healer's soul rendering them helpless. Sorry they denied your pleasure with that hammer.
---
Looks like Randy wants to fight
---
Fuck the system, I'm rolling Dwarf Rogue this time around! If i was able to get Gladiator back in BC on a Night Elf, I'm confident I can....nevermind, I'm an old washed-up casual now.
---
Sitting in Onyxia when half the guild who isn't zoned in and is on the Kalimdor server just drops offline simultaneously.... guess we're not raiding yet!
---
Well yeah max to cap. Youre still gunna have autos which make a big difference. Its why human warriors lead the dps charts
---
And again, Classic is not going to have a separate EULA nor are they going to implement support systems requiring Classic-only employees to manage.
---
Upvote, like and sub for delivering the content in a timely manner without any waffle whatsoever or crap about promoting the channel.
---
The youtuber we don't deserve.
---
that explains it...
---
Yes it is.
---
All gear is hunter gear. The hunter told me so.
---
You have to do the same logout procedure, but while in a party, such as an alt. A little more work because you'll need someone else.
---
says the guy promoting gold buying....
---
Anyone who has played vanilla will tell you the hardest role to fill in a group is a tank.  The idea of it being easy to find a warrior willing to tank the specific instance that you want at a specific time is flawed.  If you start a group and find a warrior, with good enough gear/spec/skill to tank whatever content you are trying to do, your group will fill pretty quick.  But generally it's the last spot to be filled, and if it takes long enough you group will just disband before you can even find one.  This applies to healers as well, just not to the same degree.  There will be mages, rogues, hunters coming out the ass, but not one of them can tank.  Any pub group in vanilla is happy to have any capable tank join their group.  Vanilla city chat was a constant stream of "LF1M WARRIOR TANK PST".  People would sit around spamming that forever and get nowhere.  If your class is capable of tanking, and you are at least decently geared/specced for it, you will get plenty of invites.
---
I was having a good day until you reminded me of the disappointment that was d3.  :(
---
yup
---
Forgive me. Any mage using Bloodvine Chest over RotAM or Netherwind either doesn't know how to itemize or is fairly casual ie. not clearing raids weekly..
---
Nah it's not cheating. You will get banned if you sell gold but not if you buy it. I bought thousands of gold during vanilla and will do so again cause fuck farming your ass off just so you can raid, I outsource that shit.
---
take your pay to win shit elsewhere please
---
google hunter melee weaving vanilla. 99% wont ever do it but the ones who want to minmax will definitely.
---
While all this is absolutely true, I wish they made few tweak and changes here and there. Paladins have 2 almost useless trees and are terribly boring to play. Druids, while decent, are nowhere near their BC usefulness, same goes for shamans.
---
Priest, Shaman, or Paladin are all fine choices if you want to be a healer. What exactly do you want out of a healer?
---
I remember I played on Archimonde, as that was where a lot of old school PvP guilds from prior MMOs announced were going to duke it out, and they'd agreed to meet on the first server starting with "A" in the central timezone.  This ended up being a total disaster, and the server was down a lot at the beginning, and a lot of people restarted elsewhere.  It would be nice to see some old faces from my server again though.
---
Don‚Äôt ninja / roll need on items that another party needs and/or aren‚Äôt useful for your class.
---
Or don‚Äôt be a greedy dick.  You might get blackballed.
---
incorrect
---
Yep know the site - but that's more for finding people from back then, I'm more asking "where will we roll" :)
---
I'm not promoting gold buying. It would be better if I was the only person buying gold. Which is why I'm continuing to enter contracts with every major gold seller so that no one else on my server can buy gold.
---
Set hearthstone to Desolace, clear Mara(princess) invite random person, leave group, get free hearth out, reset, rinse and repeat.
---
There's no competition between the retail or Classic teams, either. Both are literally working off of Ion Hazzikostas' direction. They have different goals, where one is trying to faithfully recreate an old game and the other is trying to find interesting changes and directions for an ongoing game, but that doesn't mean they're fighting or in competition. WoW has always done some looking to the past for inspiration about where to go next. Classic existing doesn't really change that. 
---
And if the retail team sees Classic being really successful and decides to take inspiration from that for where to go next, and that gamble works out and more players come back to retail, the retail team will see that as a win for themselves. They're not going to be bitter about it. They're the same damn company and they all want all of their games to be fun and make money.
---
No, RickC410 made that claim, and that is his claim to defend.  I'm chiming in saying that the mindset between RP-PvP and RP-PvE is the same as the difference between PvP and PvE.  People won't want the stress while RPing of having the other faction showing up and killing them, while others would love the chaos and improv that would bring.  Telling RP-PvPers to just play on a RP-PvE server is the same as telling PvPers they should play on PvE servers.

That is false. Come up with any Phase 4 BIS list you want and I'll beat yours by including Bloodvine Vest.
---
Ah, sorry. I figured it may be easier to find people you remember and contact them directly. Well, good luck! (:
---
ok then...
---
you're not really helping your case...
---
The internet.
---
Now do this for debuffs.  
---
DPS:Debuff and you'll impress me and have a foot hold in evolving the meta towards bis optimizations.
---
It is not necessary and it won't be possible for a while without severely gimping your tankiness. Its really not until aq40 and naxx that you can hope to have 9 hit a reasonably defensive set. Before that max threat sets tend to have more like 4-5 and you'll be giving up some defense and stam to even get that high.
---
Is not armor alone what makes pally tanky. Divine Shield and Blessing of Freedom are, and baseline stuns, and else.
---
Meanwhile shaman eats all forms of cc with only trinket help.to get out
---
&gt;Fortunately real wages have gone up over the past 50 years both in terms of median and average pay.
---
Not on par with productivity and profits though, so that's a moot point. No one is arguing wages haven't moved at all. They've only moved a tiny fraction of the other metrics.
---
&gt;Don't get me wrong, capitalism has its ills: pollution, contribution to global warming, corruption, greed, etc.
---
This is where your sentence should have ended.
---
The standard of living for everyone has gone up, but that isn't necessarily attributed to capitalism. Especially considering how capitalism is designed to sacrifice human life and the planet for profits. Capitalism is *only* good for the wealthy elite. It's a net negative for everyone else.
---
&gt;  the second you log in to a server that isn‚Äôt Blizzards and play free of cost, you are committing copyright infringement.
---
&gt; You can not legally download a 1.12 version of world of warcraft
---
Well which is it?  I believe my statement was "unlawful use or reproduction also =/ downloading something", so I'm glad you've just confirmed that for me :)
---
&gt; Also, again legally speaking, you are taking money directly from blizzard by playing a private server
---
This isn't true. People who play pservers are largely those who do not play retail, and pservers are generally f2p in the first place.  There is negligible subscription revenue that blizzard is "losing" here until Classic is actually out.  Blizzard has never pursued anybody legally like this either.
---
&gt; World of warcraft is still world of warcraft
---
Then why make wow classic to capture pserver players?  
---
&gt; A player who obtains and plays without paying a subscription fee is a player who would otherwise be paying to play World of Warcraft and is a loss to blizzard.
---
Emphatically false claim.
---
&gt; If you thought I meant Esfand was a copyright litigator you‚Äôre a fucking moron.
---
If that's what you perceived, you still don't understand what an anecdotal fallacy is or why I was making fun of you for using it lol
---
As far as I‚Äôm concerned if they didn‚Äôt mention it was going to be gated, it‚Äôs not.
---
How do you equip a black lotus...?
---
is google down?
---
I may be wrong but on early vanilla I recall gnomes had increased dagger spec
---
oh no so this basically confirms my need to have a second account...
---
Tell that to the servers that used to get stomped by Emerald Dream premades when cross server became a thing.
---
BFA is a fucking meme. The first raid tier they literally had a mathematically unkillable boss for quite some time until they nerfed it. So yeah its not very strange for people to question blizzards tuning when they've proven themselves inept at times.
---
There is no case. You all *want* Blizzard to ban gold buyers in Classic, but history and common sense and the legal documents they provide all suggest they won't.
---
I noticed most of the engineering stuff is cloth.  But for a rogue, what items are worth crafting?
---
I'm guessing Gnomish death ray.  The regular PVP trinket in your other slot is mandatory.  So what does that leave open?
---
Is everyone just leveling engineering for the death ray?
---
They banned all the accounts including the one that recieved the gold.
---
So how do you turn ?
---
I know it‚Äôs something to do with mouse, but do I need to bind a key or something?
---
That pic with paladin in t2 though. Forgot the cloth robes in the closet?
---
Imagine being so insufferable that you cannot adhere to a simple naming policy on a RP server.
---
keep digging
---
If you manage to get R13 before AQ (because you get upgrade for every r13 slot there) you will be better than a T2 geared warrior on most boss. (There was one in my guild on a pserver that did the grind, he felt more resistant than a t2 war. He quit soon after because the grind burned him out tho... )
---
Thanks ill try it tonight
---
Hunter is pretty good for that then. Get a chrommy Xbow and you are good for life
---
No, this won't work. We tested it extensively in the Beta. If a character logs out inside the instance, resetting won't work. Your best option is using another person to force your hearthstone.
---
I agree. If the group leader did this to me for any boss except the last, I'd leave afterward. Screams of scumbaggery.  
---
"Oh, were you going to ninja &lt;blah&gt; for your friend but it didn't drop?"
---
Never heard of this mod before, thanks! Sounds really fun
---
Seems legit. How was seniority handled? What was the range of attendance?
---
I came from EQ1 making some assumptions about rogues based on that game....whew, NOT EVEN CLOSE!  
---
I did basically exactly what you did, except mage after rogue instead.
---
Yes, but even your own videos, you're putting forth more effort than a warrior. You have more consumables than a warrior. 
---
I don't think anyone is saying you "can't" do it. You've proven it can be done. The issue is that people may not be able to dedicate as much time to check all the boxes that you have checked.
---
Not every class gets to experience rejection, but as a shadow priest you have that luxury.
---
You can do some really good tricks shapeshifting to do some things if you are a skilled druid but it's true it's mainly in dungeon, can't do that if you are tanking a raid boss most of the time.
---
Most marketing is predatory by nature.
---
We're conditioned from an early age to be consumers.
---
IT doesn't matter if it's a loot box or not a loot box. The fact is they have people overpaying for content. The cost to create these mounts and other micro transactions is out of proportion with what they charge for them.
---
This is about 1/10th of all the minmaxing you can do.
---
What I mean is...  
---
It should be possible to equate the DPS contribution of buffs and debuffs. How much DPS is Sunder Armor providing to the entire raid, how much DPS is Thunderfury being equated to through TPS, what is the DPS contribution of LotP, etc. etc.  
---
A raid wide scope, oppose to a single player scope.
---
I think that monitor looks good for your GPU setup. If I were you I‚Äôd try to find that monitor someplace else and then get bestbuy to price match
---
If we are talking pvp troll is objectively better overall, no contest.  Yes, undead can win you some fights against certain classes like warlock, or if you‚Äôre in a scenario where your DP won‚Äôt be cleansed, but even still trolls advantages during those fights still outweigh the benefits of UD.
---
The main argument people have is DP vs. SG.
---
I‚Äôll make this simple.  DP makes you go oom.  You‚Äôre forced to use it with IF.  You lose the IF crit for a massive MB crit.  SG does more damage anyway during the duration of DP, unless you aren‚Äôt being focused, in which case if you aren‚Äôt being focused, then it‚Äôs irrelevant as you‚Äôre going to win the fight anyway. 
---
If anyone wants to fight me on it I‚Äôm up for it.
---
I've definitely done #4. And I've definitely left groups when the leader starts explaining all their convoluted stipulations.
---
In a guild run sure I'm happy to pass on whatever for someone. I've done plenty of runs without needing anything from there. 
---
But if you are scraping together a pug, rogue or tank idc both get to role on ironfoe
---
By this logic, there should be no R7-10 gear at all until phase 4 :) Old gear didn't exist in 1.12, new gear didn't exist until 1.9 or something.
---
Hopefully your healing the whole raid instead of just your own clique
---
I meant that you can trade it. BoE was the wrong word :)
---
Lol ye my bad
---
Start playing Warframe. That made it super natural for me when i came back to wow.
---
Guild leaders can be anything; leading a guild is a social role primarily. *Raid* leaders tend to be DPS, and specifically ranged DPS because they have the best overview of the fight. Tanks and melee DPS spend the entire fight looking at the boss‚Äôs ankles and healers are watching health bars.
---
Blasphemy!
---
Unlike the recent expansions, classic won‚Äôt be a solo experience. You need to be social and make friends to enjoy the game, run dungeons and pvp with. Hell, even questing should be done in duo or triples!
---
I never had that issue. There will always be some tough situations but you won't be totally gimped you'll still have fun. Full T1 was a major achievement for me in vanilla days; it may still feel like that in Classic :).
---
Tailoring gives you 2% crit on the bloodvine set which is a must have for any Mage who‚Äôs minmaxing.
---
Well it's a bit hard to constantly rely on someone being online and willing to help
---
No, the gear existed in 1.4 and throughout Vanilla, it just received changes.
---
&gt; I did like TFA quite a bit and that one being a good film really made things hurt when everything else after it was crap.
---
Yeah, that's the worst part about all of this. The Force Awakens was a pleasant surprise and got everyone's hopes up, and then they took a big dump on everything with the spin-off movies and TLJ. TFA was at least as good as the prequels, but unfortunately the same can't be said for the rest of the Disney films.
---
Ebbnflow also has a great breakdown of this on youtube https://youtu.be/ebfftvVL3rk
---
Games easy. Don't need to respec or min-max.
---
What made classic difficulty was people using bad computers, and internet connections, alongside little to no gaming experience.
---
Wotf works on sleeps and charms too.
---
exactly, mage is gonna zip zop zoom through the kill 1 quests, I really feel bad for any melee trying to get through em early on
---
It won't get obsolete. If you are in full epic (be it T1 or T3) you will be overgearing the vast majority of players, unless you are going tryhard for R14. You'll be fine in T1.
---
PVP dumbass.
---
So cp druid vs non thunderfury warrior is not a marginal threat gain its huge, the only way a warrior can keep up is if they dw and then open themselves up to being crit and crushed.  now warrior hold the advantage of putting a shield on when needed and when threat doesn't matter so that's a plus.  Also once a warrior gets a lot of mc gear they will pass druid in mitigation for sure but at the beg of mc when both in blues druids will win in threat and mitigation.  Druid will continue to win in threat until a warrior gets into bwl gear and dw fury.  Then a druid starts doing better once they get aq40 upgrades then obviously the warrior passes them in everything at some point into t3 with thunderfury.  This is not from private server experience my guild killed twin emps and a few naxx bosses in vanilla with a mt feral druid.  There is ebb and flow through the content where these classes best each other based on gear and encounters, there is also a distinct advantage of bringing a druid as it helps spread gear around that would otherwise be trash.  I would highly recommend at least consider bringing a feral tank to your raids assuming they are competent.
---
Wpvp sure, but just debuffing without any actual fighting is griefing. Plain and simple. I'm all for battles even if I'm going to raid, meeting a group of 5 gankers in DM for example. But debuffing like guys are talking about here is just fucking stupid.
---
I took 4 weeks of PTO off for classic
---
I agree even in raids you can min max someb but it really isn't necessary.
---
There's a lot of gear with weapon skill in Vanilla. It's not just racials.
---
Me because I'm still undecided
---
The EULA specifically says you are not allowed to violate or assist in violating the terms of the license.
---
Im thinking of playing Arms warrior as I want to PvP predominantly, but I want to make myself useful in a raid environment. Am I likely to get into a semi-casual guild by going for a 31/5/15 spec in order to function as an offtank? Is this kind of build atleast semi-viable in the modern environment? I feel as though as Arms I‚Äôll kind of have pick of the 2-handers to hopefully get my BRE.
---
Oh yeah, they have to be in their own bubble worlds. Separate launcher drop downs. Like a new game.
---
Nah, they were like only 1 day bans and you got a free name change lol. Although i think repeat offenders later on could get a perma, not too sure though.
---
Please tell me you know what I meant, and were just using a clever pun.  That way I know whether to be amused at the joke or weep for the future of humanity.
---
Why do you need to be able to turn while healing?
---
That‚Äôs a very nice monitor and your setup can easily handle 1440p 144hz for Classic WoW.
---
Second this, I was always gutted that hardly anyone uses or has heard of Mumble despite it being waaaaay ahead of all of the other platforms in terms of latency and quality.
---
Since you need to put 11 points into Holy for Consecration (your most important tanking spell), you might as well go all the way to Divine Favor since it makes grinding a lot easier. After you put 21 points into Holy, start filling out Protection. Then you can finish up with a 21/26/0+4 build, which is good for PvP and tanking or healing 5-man dungeons.
---
Upgrading gpu doesn‚Äôt do anything for Classic wow.
---
yeah, I feel like most people will stay in like 2 groups, people who did a lot of research, and people who are going in mostly blind, and then in the 20+ levels it will spread a lot more. But still a quick 1-10 helps later.
---
How much you charge if I bring the mats from the AH?
---
Yeah I plan on getting it slowly. People will always be doing MC so overtime I think it‚Äôs an obtainable goal. Just can‚Äôt dedicate two nights a week. Schedule changes to much
---
Did you miss the part where we're talking about the balancing of a shaman only ability? Lol
---
You can trust this guy, OP. No bias here!
---
100% if troll and UD racial was turned around, everyone would talk about how trash trolls are.
---
Making a ugly face on my first 60...
---
You never really notice while leveling!
---
And second is making my Rogue and druid both NE... i never liked em!
---
Oh it was fair.  This is a thread about biggest vanilla regrets lol.  Obviously cheating is deserving of punishment.
---
Most of my vanilla career I wasn't cheating just to clarify.  Just as Naxx was opening and I was spreading myself too thin between raiding, pvp, and the necessary consumables for both.
---
Yeah good luck with that. With how loot works in classic, if you're not one of the guild leaders buddies you're never going to get a priority on benediction/Anathema. And you also have to consider the hunter item could drop instead.

Sorry, I was referring to the succubus demonic sacrifice respec to SM/Ruin trick.
---
No, it's an old game.
---
&gt;\-Druid w/o MCP vs Deep Prot Warrior in threat gear : Warrior tanks have slightly better threat than Druid tanks..  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;\-Druid w/o MCP vs Impale Prot Warrior in mitigation gear : Warriors have better threat.  
---
&gt;\-Druid with MCP vs Impale Prot Warrior in mitigation gear : Equal threat for most fights.  
---
&gt;\-Druid w/o MCP vs Impale Prot Warrior in threat gear : Warriors have significantly better threat.  
---
&gt;\-Druid with MCP vs Impale Prot Warrior in threat gear : Equal threat for most fights.  
---
&gt;In BWL, Warriors have better threat, except Druid with MCP vs Deep Prot Warrior.
---
All of this is false. Druids do significantly more threat even without MCP than a warrior even in threat gear. The only way for a warrior to do more threat than a druid is to go fury and dualwield, and even with that you won't beat a druid with MCP (they did on private server but that was only thank to the sit crit bug abuse).
---
I never needed any MCP because i was doing enough threat every time (i did use some for fun sometimes). The few times i needed more threat i just put some tps gear (and the mitigation loss was really small, about 1% less armor mitigation for a 25% threat increase from my full mitigation gear to my semi threat gear).
---
Also i will not deny that warrior are superior on alot of fight because of the tools and cool down they have (some boss are almost not doable with a druid), but druid also have different tools and tanking style that are better on some boss.
---
Exemples :
---
When crush and crit aren't a concern, druid are superior thank to their superior effective health (mainly useful for patchwerk and bloodlord lashlayer)
---
Druid are superior on most resist fight because they have less to lose when going for resist gear than warrior (mainly on fire resist fight, geddon ragnaros firemaw)
---
Superior mobility : feral charge is a 15 second cd and don't require stance dancing (really useful on Ragnaros, Sartura and Ouro for example) Can also shapeshift out of about any slow (situational but really useful again).
---
Polymorph immunity (altho outside of jindo in zg, no boss use that. Really useful in some dungeon)
---
Also i don't expect much difference between private server meta and classic meta. Sure there will be a few difference but the core will be the same. Don't compare vanilla to classic tho because druid were only viable very late after the talents revamp and only a few people bothered to try druid tanking after that.
---
This isn't actually certain. The blue PvP gear was one of the rare instances where they created new items that had to be re-earned rather than just updating existing items. Especially the epic level gear shouldn't get updated until the Naxx phase as it got a huge quality boost.
---
yep, most people will get slightly ahead by group farming mobs and easy quests, so it's not a bad idea
---
&gt;nor does it change that 1.12 is an authentic blizz experience.
---
It does tho. The content/phasing is totally off from the talent, skills, and items. That isn't blizzlike. It's the mixing and matching that's making it massively different. You could take the BC prepatch (still something that was in vanilla) and put it in day 1 and call it blizzlike. 
---
&gt;And I fully expect that classic will not remain a static experience in regards to macros and add on api just like vanilla didn't.
---
Sure. But it starts nowhere near where it was in 1.1 or 1.12.
---
Came out in 4.3 which was the "end" of cata but that patch lasted around a year.
---
Jesus fuck I'd wish raids were harder in classic. A lot of the magic disappears when everyone has the latest raid gear.
---
Reading is hard, bro. My b
---
I feel like the thing to do would be to run a thousand simulated rotations over a period of time and see what that averages.
---
I don‚Äôt know, but it‚Äôs there for me and I am from NA so maybe yeah..
---
No you don't get those perks from professions. That was introduced in wrath.
---
The only professions that gives you an actual advantage:
---
Tailoring: For priests and mages the best chest in the early game is made from tailoring and it is bind of pickup. You can abandon tailoring after getting this chest though and many priest/mages decide to do that.
---
Later in phase 4 with Zulgurub a set called Bloodvine requires 300 tailoring to use the 3set bonus of 2% crit. This is very strong for any caster and can take quite a while to replace. 
---
And then of course engineering. It gives various items like bombs you can use for DPS increase, it gives pets you can summon like the Arcanite dragonling which puts a fire damage taken debuff which is very useful. It is required to wear the reflector shield which does amazing aoe damage and threat(but loses durability from doing so very fast).
---
Generally the meta is to pick engineering and then a gold making profession. If caster you switch the goldmaking profession to tailoring while bloodvine is worth wearing.
---
Before stuff like Questie I just alt-tabbed and looked up the quest on thottbot. I find it neither fun nor immersive not being able to figure out where to go for a quest. I find fun in fast, efficient leveling and always have.
---
A rogue with glaives in sunwell would trash everyone.
---
Without glaives, Warlocks were slightly ahead.  
---
This is assuming lock group had an spriest, and rogue group had war/enh at least.
---
Classes that Use AGI as a primary stat tend to be the best with a little gear. That's rogue and hunter are both completely playable the whole time in T1. Mages are also very good in just pre-bis gear. Because they get a lot of free crit in frost spec.
---
The fear that they might look biased.
---
Anyone who puts a WF binding or tank BiS to freeroll deserves their guild to fall apart.
---
27" would be better for 1440 resolution.
---
It will be midnight in Europe. I hope for smooth login and character creation. I will take some time for keybinds, macros and addons, and to look around with the new graphics. Hopefully, Teldrasil will not be too crowded after 1:00 and I can start leveling. Looking for group for the spider cave and the furbolg den, the rest I will solo. My plan is to be on the boat to Auberdine when the sun rises, being above lvl 10. Around 7:00, time for a break to wake up the Kids and prepare for school. When I'm back around 9:00, either take a nap, more realistically logging back in and continue till noon when the Kids come back. Tuesday is my only day off that week, so the rest I will play casualy in the evening, whenever I  feel about it.
---
Can't wait!
---
No item in Classic is being ‚Äúupdated‚Äù. Whatever stats it had in 1.12 are the stats it will have throughout all of Classic.
---
I'd rather get the 5/5 HotW, because I don't care about PvP that much.
---
" Finally, you clearly should have gotten Salv even though you asked for Wisdom. "  
---
Now this is pod racing.
---
Yeah if I just happened to accidentally choose whater the rp server was id do my best to break immersion at every turn, would also be damn sure to name my characters something memey. I have no interests in attempting to type like my character should talk.
---
Sure. Don't care. I'll just be trading steam games for gold if not.
---
Obviously don't go to the forums and do that, there will be a discord server you can do that on. :p
---
Not knowing about the game until TBC
---
As a Horde player, I approve of this paladin-hating post.
---
"Edit: Also if u plan on bringing just one tank u cant use a druid because he has nothing against fear."
---
If you are bringing just one tank you won't clear MC anyway. (And if you are alliance fearward is enough to deal with fear but true if you don't have a dwarf priest you are better with a war tank if there is a fear mechanic).
---
My work's firewall blocks your website as malicious.

Yeah I mean he‚Äôs got the i7 8700 so his CPU won‚Äôt be the problem
---
I'm wondering if it wouldn't be helpful to try and hop layers every 10 mins or so while in the starting zone to see if you can get into a lower pop one.
---
Classic is the type of game you'd hate if you didn't first play it between 2004-2008. Gaming has changed so much since then that most people who don't have nostalgia for it would never really enjoy it.
---
It's literally not.
---
I'm planning to main a Warlock. At 60, I decide meh, I want to pvp as a Rogue with friends. I take the character boost route. If it's anything like retail, I get a starter set of gear and dumped into the capitol city.
---
Do I have a competitive edge? No. 
---
I'm not talking about P2W like buying premium weapons that will give me a competitive edge over other players. If anything, an argument can be made that I'm quite disadvantaged as now I have to figure out how to play a class I never have at max level and in a competitive way. I still get to do the honor grind for weapons etc just like anyone else.
---
The bombs is the main thing (basically aoe incapacite that deals damage), can be used as a gap closer or to interrupt or to gain a few seconds to regen energy as a rogue.
---
Most items are really good, most good items have use effects.
---
Engineering also have 2 stealth detection helmets, 1 without stats but 18 stealth detection and one with stamina and 10 stealth detection.
---
The helmet that incapacite is really good to win fights against multiple people.
---
Spell reflection trinkets are great, they both adds some resistance and reflects spells, they have long cd but just use another trinket when they are on cd.
---
So you can strafe the correct direction.
---
Plus not max level stealth is fast as a fish on land
---
I did Kara back in TBC on dial up. It was okay for most of the raid, but for some reason, it just couldnt handle the chess event. Always kicked there...
---
FFXI (which as far as I understand is basically reskinned EQ - but it's where I started) was big on this too.
---
The problem though was with RMT and over competition.
---
Imagine if like every single piece of your preraid BiS was a BoE with a 3% drop on a 64 hour respawn, and each has it's own little mafia clique controlling the entire market on it.
---
It was cool in a lot of ways but I think I prefer how WoW relegates rare overworld spawn loot to fun gimmicks and a few minor leveling upgrades.
---
Except you need to move off of your unit frames in order to do that, or else you just end up casting a heal that's bound to right mouse.
---
Pserver noob
---
Idk if it'll be as common without honor in phase 1, but you have to know that there'll be some gnome rogue or mage who will sit in stonetalon and absolutely destroy the people 10 levels lower than him.
---
Nope, running a dungeon more than likely takes longer too and you aren't guaranteed the drop.
---
Any guesses how many weeks straight you would have to do that? If people‚Äôs estimates on time are accurate I think rank 8 may be my realistic goal
---
Raids and PvP will FPS drop? I thought they were going to use a newer engine for classic
---
Ask as many questions as you can. If you're in a group and loot drops that you have to roll for (there is a box with Need (Dice) Greed (a Coin) and Pass (X)) be certain it's good for your class/spec and that you can actually wear (level doesn't matter in this case, but f.e. a Mage can't use an Axe n stuff like that).
---
The rest will come. If someone complains tell them you're new. :)
---
I mean he just refuted your private server point.
---
Yeah, we were on Sapphiron and the same thing happened...
---
What if I make a troll with big hair named "tronalddump" and roleplay running for president of the horde on the promise of building a wall to keep the night elves out?
---
Well druids also have differents tools that are also really useful in other fight (like the ability to decurse and dispell for example) On top of that they have Innervate and Battle res which will be useful no matter the boss.
---
How‚Äôs that even a question? One is a gear independent solo god with top tier leveling speed and farming capabilities. The other is the slowest leveler in the game and is 100% gear dependent, benefitting immensely from being funneled items and enchants.
---
False. The old gear existed but was not obtainable. If you had it then you could wear it.
---
As a Horde player, I like receiving Paladin Blessings before zoning in for a raid.
---
I‚Äôm not sure what the above guy is talking about but in vanilla this was absolutely the case. It‚Äôs partially why blizzard revamped PvP and introduced resilience. People extremely decked out in t3 ect where basically breaking the game in PvP and pewpew one shotting people. 
---
Gear absolutely does matter. And will probably matter even more now that this time around people will actually know how to play. T1 will not last you the entire expansion. You can probably get away on equal footing with t2 / epic honor gear. But eventually when people are fully decked in t3 you will find yourself occasionally losing winnable fights simply because the gear does become rather fucksane in naxx.
---
The gear did not recieve changes. The level 58 and 60 set are completely different independent items.
---
You are 100% correct. People on here are seriously underestimating just how hard it will be to fill raids with 40 people. That kind of giant roster might be there for a select few guilds, but even then a lot of those rosters will slowly dwindle down into patch cycles and PuGs will need to be brought in. Every spec is gonna do just fine finding raid spots.
---
Looks like a good start.  Took me right to Mankrik.  Now if you could just add his wife...
---
What? Lol
---
&gt; I swear I get more"hiccups" in service in this month of 150mbps than in 20 years of 220kbps
---
*'Working as intended'* - Comcast.
---
The people selling gold on pservers were the server owners or friends of the server owners.
---
Hmm. I‚Äôm torn. 
---
Levelling really was the bread and butter of vanilla, in my opinion. Yeah, we all love raiding and PVP, but the RPG element is what makes vanilla so special. 
---
IMO, if you want to just Zerg to cap and PvP or raid just go play retail. Character investment and the world size is a big part of the game, and a character boost strips a lot of that away.
---
What sets are we talking about here? Actual names would be preferred.
---
Layering will probably make it so that this won't be anything like the private server launches where 15 people camp the same random boar spawn. As i am not going for any kind of record breaking leveling speed, i will just play the game a lot and hopefully that will be enough.
---
&gt;I wont be envying your neck muscles 
---
why not? he's gonna be yoked
---
It did really have the feel of a sequel when it came out. The level of change was massive. I liked TBC btw, I had a bit more fun in vanilla. After TBC WoW basically lost me.
---
Rather they buffed the raids.. it's a joke
---
You are technically correct but people just say BoE because it gets the point aboard with 3 letters.
---
Generally, yes, but the R7-10 gear is different. These were actually new items added to the game. One player could have both sets in their inventory if they re-earned their rank after the update.
---
What is your weird fucking problem with private server players.
---
You do realize if no one ever played private servers that we wouldn‚Äôt have classic right?
---
youre fucking scum
---
That happened on some of the more toxic Pservers, but not the good ones.
---
I'm interested to see how a lot of stuff will work in classic vs. private servers, like if Skarm's dual-wield fury tanking build will hold up, or if feral druid DPS will be any good at all. I know it's never been comparable to pure DPS classes, but for some reason a couple of my friends insist that it's going to be completely non-viable. I just really love how unique and mechanically challenging the rotation is compared to every other DPS class that's basically just spamming frostbolt, shadowbolt, sinister strike-&gt;SnD, etc.
---
This is crazy, only 31 days to go! I've been waiting years for this!
---
I would say their melee leeway also has a significant impact.  Overall, I believe UD would definitely be more of a PVP focused choice.
---
&gt; I felt like druid was a half assed dps and viable healer and tank. 
---
FTFY
---
That card won‚Äôt do max settings in raids imo
---
Your alt can just be a level 1. 
---
I've also been playing around with doing herb + princess and goblin runs. I can't down the gator, guess I'm bad. This way, I only tack on 2-3 minutes running back to the entrance. I don't think
---
&gt;Because the nochanges crowd would riot.
---
fuck the nochanges crowd tbh
---
I would imagine because of IP logging.  If your playing on your account and log out in one location, and log in 5 minutes later in another location, your account would be flagged.  After N flags then your account gets suspended for 30 days or more, and that would reset your progress to whatever rank you wanted to obtain.
---
It might have a crazy launch, it might go smoothly.
---
What matters is that *it will be launched*. Maybe it takes a day or two or whatever to not have server issues, but it will smooth out as it always does and it will be great.
---
You're right. It means that we're likely to get old 58 R7-10 gear for phases 2-3. Which is very odd, given the fact that R13-14 things will be as OP as they are in 1.12, since the items weren't renamed.
---
If you google you can get a classic model viewer with the old models etc. If you want to focus on classic machinima it maybe better
---
What the hell, this is the first twink video I saw back in the day. Remember that intro so clearly and been looking for this video for a while.
---
There were times where I dropped below 60 FPS in the beta using a 9700k and 2080ti, granted they were extremely rare and I was using CVARs to push clutter and draw distance. Without BFA's multithreading support, the game just isn't optimized very well.
---
I never had that problem with my ex. She made every single other healer look like trash in meters, and got nicknamed the 'Silent Scope' healer for her snipes.
---
The other healers all stopped posting charts very quickly.
---
"We already know"? No we don't. Further, it wouldn't make much sense to have R7-10 gear in its 1.4 state and R13-14 gear in its 1.12 state.
---
80 FPS should be enough I would think. Wouldn‚Äôt G-sync help with this?
---
Will classic even have 1440p?
---
You are, actually.
---
I honestly think I would enjoy shaman healing, paladin healing just felt like weak priest heals.  And during the time I was playing, raids used me as a cleanse not. Awful all around.
---
Here's one for every single class at once.
---
Ally pvp race: Gnome if possible. Dwarf if gnome not possible but NE if hunter(but this one is debatable). Nightelf if gnome+dwarf not possible(druid).
---
Ally pve race: If caster: Gnome, if melee: human, if healer: Dwarf if possible. If hunter it doesn't matter much but NE more base agility though dwarf gun racial can be useful in some situations. 
---
Horde PVP race: Orc if possible. Undead if orc not possible. Tauren if orc or undead not possible.
---
Horde PvE: Melee dps can choose between orc or troll. Else go troll if possible. If troll not possible go undead.
---
Professions PVP: Engineering + Blacksmithing. Blacksmithing gives a unique trinket that gives 30 seconds fear immunity. It's not mandatory though.
---
Professions PvE: Engineering + gold making profession. If healer that doesn't pvp then go guild crafting profession + gold maker.
---
*hell yeah we need shadow weaving.
---
Yep exactly.
---

---
Yeah lol
---
So close yet so far away...
---
That's my plan too
---
My launch day plan is simply chilling and enjoying myself, I‚Äôm not in a rush or a world first week 1 rag guild so I have all the time in the world.
---
I‚Äôm gonna try to keep my fishing/cooking up to date while I level too. So really I will probably be behind the rush crowd lol.(Gonna get 60 before phase 2 tho)
---
For a druid tanking, that argument largely goes away.  For cat form, I have never been really impressed with the argument, either.  If the innervate someone else or battle res, they essentially losses their shot at continuing average DPS.  If the argument is to innervate a healer, you would gain more by having the druid heal. If the argument is for DPS, you can have another class DPS (if decurse is your worry, choose a a mage; if interrupt is your concern, choose a rogue or fury warrior).  As a druid, I always felt this argument was trying to place a square peg in a round hole.
---
Did not now this was a thing! Thank you! Has this been kept quiet or did I just totally miss this?
---
Using 1.12 stats with progressive itemization is just odd in general. Completely unbalanced and biased this was proven one year ago when a private server used the exact same itemization and people disliked it.
---
The baseline is to expect something like 2-3 weeks or more per rank after rank 6. All depends on how much other ppl pvp, and how much population your server has. I know people who felt like achieving r10 felt like a job, and some people just did mostly pve and gained only incremental increase for their rank along the weeks. I suggest to do pve and pvp just here and there, because the honor gain is in the end relative and you can burn out easily by concentrating only on pvp.
---
yea im not trying to wf or anything but i definitely wanna be top 100 60 on my server.
---
Here‚Äôs a good break down from someone that mains an s.priest
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-FGSJ06BoGg
---
He speaks a bit more about UD specifically in the video about spriesrs in wsg
---
Weird..I was druid in vanilla too, and I'm thinking about rolling druid again for classic. But! I was in the top horde guild on my server and they let me take spell damage items so I could also play boomkin. Maybe I was just really fortunate..I was also 14 years old. Maybe I won't be able to recreate that same environment this second time.
---
My fault, I confused the sets. The level 60 set will be in the game at Phase 2, the level 58 set will not be in the game at all. [And we do know this](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/classic-pvp-content-plan/146049):
---
&gt; That‚Äôll change once phase 2 rolls around and we add the Honor System, which will introduce Honorable Kills, Dishonorable Kills, and PvP Rank Rewards. The items you earn from the PvP Rank Rewards will be the versions from patch 1.12.
---
I had to turn off my laptop so that was not an option :P
---
WoW is NOT for fun...
---
Play what you want as a main tank.  The last private server I played on our MT was a gnome.  Which gives zero pve benefit.  At least UD has an extra fear break and cannibalize can help when things get rough, the shadow resist is good too.
---
Spriest fit that but it might be a challenge to gear up and stay ''beefy''
---
As a begginer class I would suggest frost mage. You got the tools to deal with any 1v1 and it's fairly easy, straightfoward and in demand.
---
Oh cool hadn‚Äôt heard that. Do they have a bigger melee leeway and hence can position with a little more freedom?
---
Oof
---
*cries in troll*
---
My rule has always been, "If you have to ask, it probably is."  I've never found having the cheat/exploit argument with anyone who uses them to be particularly fruitful anyway.
---
I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôd lie to me, at least I hope not.  He said he used some sort of small chisel to carve it out
---
Honestly after names that‚Äôs the second thing I‚Äôm doing lol,bugs me too much otherwise.
---
I'd rather have a Paladin than a druid any day
---
Unavailable video, is it set to private?
---
Not sure what you consider competitive, but here's the guild I was in:
---
[https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/guild/us/sargeras/the-family-business](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/guild/us/sargeras/the-family-business)
---
In Retail I get 110fps on max while raiding with 20 people. I am more worried for the missing multithreading support missing in classic
---
Clique is an addon.  It lets you bind heals to mouse buttons, so all you have to do is click on a unit frame and it will heal that target.  For example, as I have my binds set up on a priest, I can left-click on someone and Greater Heal, right-click and Flash Heal, shift+click and Heal, mouse4 and Renew.
---
If the guild leader or a top officer (friend of gm) aren't the main tank I would never be a part of it.  Too many mt's up and quit guilds once geared to join a different one or create one.
---
Is that a thing they have in place now? If so that's pretty badass, i haven't played in a little while.
---
The point is talent were different for most of vanilla than what we will have in classic. Druid weren't really viable because of this until AQ if i remember right and at that point few people bothered with druid tanking.
---
But there are still a few druid that did it, here a few videos :
---
Druid tanking Chrommagus : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6zijYqbves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6zijYqbves) Druid tanking boss in AQ : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLkz7sXUmK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLkz7sXUmK8)
---
Yes. It supports any resolution your graphics card does. Even 5K and multiple monitors.
---
Priests are pretty squishy in Classic. They didn't become PvP healer-tanks until resilience was added to the game and some Disc talents were added/changed in TBC and WotLK. It's even worse if you're Alliance because Undead are essentially immune to your only form of CC (Fear). Shamans at least have the option of kiting melee. Priests just have to stand there and eat the damage.
---
Definitely something I've been looking into. So, because WMV takes the models directly from your wow folder (as opposed to being included in the install), I have to find a way to direct my folder path to the Classic Data folder but I haven't been able to get that working yet unfortunately.
---
He benchmarked BFA which a different game.
---
In terms of that I think most priests should level shadow. It's far more fun and faster if you aren't grinding in a group.
---
What are the downsides to mouse turning?
---
Thanks a lot for everyone who answered here! But I have bad news... I still can't decide! It's totally not your fault guys, it's mine. A lot of people are suggesting priest but I like characters that cann do huge hits, not many small little ones, I also don't like healers. I was thinking about warlock though.. Also, do people take rogues and shamans to high tier raids, or are they not really wanted?
---
I strongly disagree with that, for at least 3 reasons.
---
First, orcs can use 1h swords. It's trolls and tauren that can't. 
---
Secondly, you couldn't train these until level 10 anyways if you wanted to. 
---
And thirdly, there are no relevant quest rewards that provide any sword, 1 or 2h, for warrior, in either Tirisfal or Silverpine. (except the class quest, but just take the axe if you are orc). 
---
Silverpine has two swords: one requires you to kill a level 24 elite and isn't even any good, (talonstrike, a green  one hander at ~level 20). 
---
And the other is very clearly a consolation prize for rouge offhanders: being a 5 dps white quality sword that requires killing level 11/12 wolves. 
---
And the starting area for undead is no better. The big quest weapon is a staff or 2h mace (9 dps), the class quest is anything you want but you should probably pick the axe, and the scarlet crusade quest, you cannot even pick a sword: it's axe or dagger and both are bad.
---
You basically always heroic strike. But if you dual wield or have windfury, youre still white hitting.
---
Hunter T1 is by far the best T1 set of all class. The set bonus combined with the class trinket in ZG can make you really deadly in pvp.
---
I'd say until few weeks in AQ, your set will be on par with any other set beside R13.
---
That being said, people saying gear doesnt matter, are fooling themselves and dont understand vanilla past bwl. Past AQ the 1/2 button burst of casters is enought to kill any T1 hunter in a matter of few sec. Past this period skill doesnt matter much more, you need stamina, engi and burst to win. Being "skilled" come after that.
---
Neltharion's Tear prot warrior prio.
---
Savage bro
---
Shaman or hunter? Going to be sort of casual, will focus on PvP but will still try to attend a raid once or twice a week. Shaman I think I would enjoy more but it'll be a lot more effort with the respecs, healing for PvE and then swapping to ele for PvP. Harder to gear with presumably quite a number of shaman in the group, but the payoff would be great I think.
---
Hunter I just love the kiting and the efficiency for everything they do out in the world with farming and everything. Less desirable in a raid and harder to get into groups, but a lot more convenient and less competition for gear. 
---
Opinions pls
---
Well continent wide or not, in the first few hours of the game no one will be outside of the starting zones anyway, so they could do it and just collapse the layers as player count goes down and higher level player count goes up
---
I was under the impression that some of the loot from the Hinterlands quests added in 1.5 were very strong for being non-dungeon gear.
---
With a lot of patience! Back when I had to play WoW with dialup, I brought my laptop to a relatives' house several miles away (who actually had high-speed internet) and left it there overnight to install the game. Then, I brought it back home and played. Took forever to load into the game, or any zones - and it was just as laggy as you'd expect. God forbid they'd release a patch, I'd be sitting there for most of the day waiting. Chatting was a nightmare, so was combat, but it was just playable enough that I managed to get quests done if nothing else.
---
Just up the video card and your FPS is essentially limitless. Any 10 series card above 1060 should do 120-plus just fine. Your best bet is probably the 1660Ti.  
---
On the stress test I got a pretty constant 500+ FPS at 4k: https://twitter.com/congelatoremage/status/1131718588841308160?s=21
---
I probably spent about 8-10 hours on it in total, it would've taken a bit less but I was messing with a lot of settings / color correction to relearn
---
Kiting, LoSing, and keeping your back away from an enemy Rogue are a few reasons that come to mind.
---
kalimdor world server down. just like beta and stress.  Then login servers crash until 6am gmt.
---
It is VERY unlikely that you'll have more than one RP realm to choose from.
---
It doesn‚Äôt seem like it would work how people think it would, also re: sharping isn‚Äôt forever
---
Classic runs on a newer engine but it‚Äôs drastically less demanding than BFA for obvious reasons that you cannot seem to comprehend. This fact should worry you.
---
Damn those MEMESTERS are at it again WeirdChamp
---
Yes? If I cut them out, it'd be the same as cutting any carb out, such as potatoes.
---
BC, but I saved money to enchant Mongoose on to both of my one hand axes... As a hunter.
---
Yeah sounds about right
---
was that a druid at the end, that picked up nef? he was taking far less damage then the original main tank warrior. don't let the druid haters see this :O.
---
Wholesome and solid
---
I know they SAY that layering won't be here forever, but I simply don't hold a lot of confidence in that fact.
---
I've seen Skarm's videos and generally agree with him on the potential of druids.
---
However, I don't believe it's a good decision to try to plaster the internet with this "FERAL DRUIDS CAN TOTALLY TANK AND DPS" spam. My heart goes out to all of the poor casuals and semi casuals who roll druid after seeing these posts only to realize they will have to farm 12 hours before every raid if they want to dps or MT.
---
We had a "Tygarpnus" in our guild for years.  I don't know how he never got reported.
---
As I said in my edit, even if you're correct (which you don't know, and your justification is an appeal to tradition) you're still fucked.

Nothing. I hardly game at all for the past few years. I'll play starcraft once a month maybe. I like getting drunk and playing online.

Might make an appearance as a music bed again :D
---
No different than classic. As someone who was a lone wolf no friends on the server I met people some I stayed in touch with most I didn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs how it goes
---
It depends to an extent. When a t3 decked mages meme blasts you with a trinket proccd presence of mind instant cast and nearly one hits you there‚Äôs just only so much skill can accomplish. At the T2 gear level skill will take you far. Once naxx/aq40 gear comes into play it just becomes total nonsense
---
This and using your mouse to turn is the biggest "freemod" you can do for PvP. Keyboard-turners are an easy kill for any mouse-turner. The difference is massive.

Warrior secret is never to play alone. Have a priest/pally friend to turn the tides
---
Big brain move tbh
---
Yeah or if your just fun or a good class pairing. Add them to friends and connect back up at 60
---
And i have never said that. They are different from warrior and it's always worth for a raid to have at least one feral (alliance side, might not be as true horde side).
---
This is laughably fanciful. Please read 2. A. i. through 2. A. ix. and 10. B. ii. of the *current* EULA. The language in the EULA is different, but the conclusion is the same.
---
Blizzard does not consider buying gold an unfair advantage nor cheating, otherwise they wouldn't sell it.
---
Bring on level 20!
---
Not gonna spend that much time going super out of the way to run something or do a quest with a guy I just met, if it works sure but you find people when needed
---
We had zero dwarf priests on our team.
---
Walled Lake here.
---
We should make a MI guild
---
I have. And they only mention selling, not buying.
---
That's B.S.
---
Horde invasions 1 and 2 were completely one sided rape/murder/genocide. The Horde was invading a land that wasn't theirs and killing everyone and everything trying to stop them. You can hand waive this one saying they were working for the Legion if you want. Even though the Orcs were chosen for their *violent* nature, let's just chalk it up to the evil Legion.
---
So the Orcs are now stuck in Azeroth and put into internment camps. This is not an entirely unfair decision by the people of Azeroth who have been invaded twice by these Orcs.
---
Thrall takes his people to Kalimdor and eventually joins forces with elves and men. Archimonde is killed and Thrall and the Orcs now have a great chance to join forces and make allegiances to these "humanoid races that are all out to kill them." even though those humanoid races are *more* than justified in their resentment and hate towards the Orcs.
---
Fine, but now Thrall has a chance to make amends. They just shared a fox-hole against the undead. Thrall already showed poor leadership when he let Grommash go North to deal with the elves and ended up corrupted by Mannoroth's blood *again* because he's a warmongering jack-ass like *most orcs*.
---
But nah, Thrall is use his great wisdom to have his orcs start chopping down trees that the elves own and give no fucks to the peace he could have had. Thrall, the Horde's number 1 paragon of goodness and honor, decides that chopping down some trees is more important than peace between his people and the people of the land *his people invaded*.
---
So the Orcs break their peace with the Alliance. Trolls are right in with the Orcs so they are basically doing the same shit. The Tauren are mostly peaceful but honoring their allegiance to the Orcs who aided them in Warcraft 3. Great.
---
But they also ally with the Forsaken, a group of undead who literally wiped out the entire Northern human civilization. But that was the Lich King and not the Forsaken so fine, let's hand waive that too.
---
Except the Forsaken are working on a new improved plague that could be used to eradicate all life on Azeroth as we know it. *Totally not evil* right? They experiment on human subjects, have people vivisected in the bowels of the Undercity, and even the Orcs/Trolls/Tauren really don't take too kindly to the Undead, but hey they are part of the Horde now.
---
How about the Blood Elves enslaving a Naaru (being of light/good) and using it for power? The Horde definitely is big on picking up the Blood Elves and the Blood Elves definitely have no problem enslaving people to do their bidding.
---
But nah, they mostly help defeat Illidan in Burning Crusade so cool on the Horde I guess.
---
How about Angrathar the Wrath gate where a Horde champion unleashes death on Horde and Alliance members in an attempt to stop Arthas? A little genocidal but hey, the Horde banner is kinda reminiscent of some other famous genocidal dudes who had red banners and black symbols in the middle. Maybe the comparison is unfair but it's definitely meant to bring that visual into the viewers eye.
---
Okay, so maybe the Nazi comparison is unfair, and maybe the Undead went a bit overboard at the Wrath gate, they did really hate Arthas, and you do get to go kill Puttress for fucking with everyone at the gate.
---
How about Mists of Pandaria? Thrall in his infinite wisdom decides that Garrosh Hellscream should be Warcheif. Hellscream, the son of that other Orc who famously and *willingly* drank the blood of Mannoroth not *once* but *twice* and turned the Orcs into monsters. Thrall famously trusted Hellscream time and time again and was bitten in the ass. But hey, I bet this dude's *son* is different right?
---
*Wrong*. Garrosh, Warchief of the Horde, murders Cairne and runs Vol'jin out of town.
---
Do I need to list all of Garrosh Hellscreams crimes as Warchief of the Horde? You know what let's go back to that Nazi reference. Garrosh is basically Horde Hitler.
---
Let's see here what else?
---
Plague bombing Gilneas.
---
Plague bombing a fishing village (southshore).
---
Raising farmers and turning them against their friends.
---
Kidnapping Magnataur babies and forcing the parents to run rampant through Ashenvale.
---
Blowing up a school.
---
Kidnapping pandaren children to enslave the parents.
---
Not evil?
---
Okay well the Horde and Alliance kill Garrosh and un-make him as the Warchief.
---
So it goes to show the Horde are good guys cause they killed their version of Hitler right? I mean, how many Hitler's can the Horde have before they start being the good guys right? I think one is more then enou.............
---
Boom! Teldrassil is burned to the fucking ground by Sylvanas, new Warchief of the Horde, murdering thousands (millions?) of innocent men, women, children, animals, and an entire *ecosystem* living within Teldrassil.
---
tl;dr **How many genocides do the Horde have to commit before they are considered evil? So far they have about half a dozen genocides under their belt in the past several years and two of their recent Warchief's have literally gone full Stalin/Hitler-esque.**
---
Want to know how I can tell you only read two words from OP's post and didn't watch the video he posted?
---
Guess it all depends how many people get that gear. Id imagine the majority of people will not have T3. If those few no lifers on shot me they prob deserve it haha
---
That's infuriating to read. DKP only works as a system when it's applied within a set of parameters. Terrible decision made by the RL/GL there.
---
Last i heard of him playing was maybe wrath or cata, but we can hope
---
Thars not true.  You can have it in prebis gear. 5 Weapon skill gives 3 hit. Humans only need Lionheart, Blackcrow, 2 hit rings, and 1 more hit ( Battleborn armbraces) to be capped off the start. If you get accuria, even less gear needed.
---
Pushing more threat is valuable at all phases, moreso in BWL than AQ even bc of tge fight mechanics that drop threat or amplify magic schools making them pull big threat.
---
Missing your threat abilities on pull sucks. You dont want that to happen.
---
A max threat set will always have  hit cap, even early phases. I dont know where you pulled all this bullshit from.
---
I would laugh my ass off if the entire server first guild was publically banned. Well, solidly amused, anyway.
---
and they don't on classic. So good job proving my point for me.
---
Heck even the original post literally says "To get ahead"It's undeniably an undair advantage, if you want to lie to yourself to maintain your cognitive dissonance about that. Go ahead.  
---
You were wrong about the EULA, you were wrong about their being no posts about it. You're going to remain wrong regardless of if you accept it or not. Enjoy your ban when it happens, try to avoid coming to the forums to cry about it when it does.
---
What do you mean? I played a shaman from vanilla to Cata and loved it.
---
Epo was actually a Night Elf Warrior and was a very skilled player. It was always easy to heal her.
---
That too
---
I agree on priests being squishy, especially in phase 1/2, but that makes shamans not better. Witouth pvp trinket or a grenade you can't get away from a warrior and good rogues will simply kill your totems and reapply crippling poison. Mages can global you in one imp CS etc. Shamans are fine in PvP, but not because of their awesome survivability or healing capabilities.
---
&gt; It does tho. The content/phasing is totally off from the talent, skills, and items. That isn't blizzlike. It's the mixing and matching that's making it massively different. You could take the BC prepatch (still something that was in vanilla) and put it in day 1 and call it blizzlike.
---
Don't get me wrong I would have preferred if they just released all the content on day 1.  But apparently some people wanted progression and this was a reasonable middle ground.
---
&gt;Sure. But it starts nowhere near where it was in 1.1 or 1.12.
---
Most of the common UI options and add ons in vanilla will work in some way or another in classic, there are only a handful of things that just flat out won't work. 
---
I mean the patch where they broke add ons like decursive in vanilla was a bigger functionality change than what we're going to see between 1.12 and classic.
---
what are you talking about??? Druid with Pummeler generates significantly more TPS than even Fury Defiance warrior (on ally side at least). check out Taladril's treatise on Feral Druids.
---
If youre retarded enough to brag about buying gold in game you deserve the ban
---
Basically decide if you want to heal or dps.
---
DPS are a dime a dozen, but mages are fun.
---
Healers have no problem getting into dungeons/raids and a good healer will get added to friends lists a lot just so people can contact you if they need heals. But healers can be less fun for solo, lots of survivability but typically slow going.
---
Have a checkbox off to the side that can hide all or show all by clicking on the following:
---
* show all rares
---
* show all stable masters
---
* show all food vendors by type
---
* show all repair
---
* show all merchants for recipes by type (enchanting/engineering/bs/etc.)
---
* show all farm-able material by type
---
* show all enemy mobs by specific level 
---
* show all available quest givers by level range \[slider 0-60,  example 34-36\]
---
I will use this as it is now to search for pick-up quest items and spawn locations of pets to tame. But more importantly, we need a quest giver feature that shows all quests available at a certain level so youre not mindlessly walking around looking for a quest to pick up. And to show all mobs at a certain level, that way you can just go farm them.
---
GPU has very little bearing on WoW performance in comparison to CPU. I had crazy FPS throughout the beta and stress tests too, but had severe drops in large world PVP battles and other shenanigans. This was using a 2080ti and 9700K.
---
Survivability is probably the top reason I played paladin back in day. It was also the class I most wanted to be but everybody told me not to. I foolishly started leveling a rogue like all my friends suggested. I got to level 40, bought my mount. Saw a paladin riding his mount and said ‚Äúfuck this‚Äù and made a paladin.
---
Log in, glee like a school girl, finish starting zone and then I‚Äôll probably be needed to look after my daughter.
---
Druid tanks aren't required at all.
---
Same boat here. Im playing RP server and cant make my mind between male dwarf or female NE hunters. Both have so much potential RPwise, but hunter animations and equipment look lots better on NE
---
It's about how rewards shape behavior based on optimized play. It was optimal to put in your minimum arena matches, even if you sucked and weren't expecting to rank well, for the pity minimum points it granted. After a few weeks of phoning it in for an hour a week with a buddy, you could afford a piece of PVP gear that was better than the gear you grinded out over months of several-hour days in BGs.
---
"For a druid tanking, that argument largely goes away." As an off tank you won't tank every time.
---
Honestly when i played feral, i did something like 55% tanking 30% dpsing 10% decursing 5% healing. Always changing job on the fly depending on what the raid needed depending on who were online and which boss it was. Imo that's the main strength of feral : versatility.
---
"If the innervate someone else or battle res, they essentially losses their shot at continuing average DPS."
---
Innervating a healer (especially if it prevent a raid wipe) is worth more than a few seconds loss in dps
---
Battle ressing someone (if it also prevent a raid wipe or allow a dead dps to continue dpsing for the whole fight) is also worth more than a few seconds loss in dps.
---
And these are situational tool, you don't use them often but using them when needed will save you and your guild a lot of time when it prevent a wipe.
---
Don't go to work and you will be ahead.
---
My plan is to stay behind the pack!
---
God. Literally doing anything right is now " only for min/maxers" in this sub. Sometjing as basic as having enough hit is apparently a min/max thing. Come on. Do you ppl not care at all about how you play? Why even play the game?
---
I never cheated in wow, but I did in some games when I was a kid, like duping items in Diablo and stuff like that. Before I realized that it usually takes the fun out of games.
---
Kicks me strait in the nostalgia man...
---
If you want to role-play, the male Night Elf is the classic choice.
---
If you have friends going Alliance or Horde play with them.
---
yeah
---
Well, my 1080Ti was getting 235ish and my 2080Ti was getting 500ish, save for when servers kept crashing. 
---
For 4k rending GPU makes a huge difference when you‚Äôre running a CPU that doesn‚Äôt bottleneck it. OP won‚Äôt get much bottlenecking with a 7700k at 2k so GPU upgrade would make a significant difference for him.
---
Exactly. When I arrived there the first time, a sand storm took all the sight. I went directly to the inn for safety
---
Not to derail the thread, but this is what made Vanilla so much harder. The internet sucked and our computers sucked and raiding was a struggle as a result.
---
Okay, here's what you do, and stay with me here:
---
Heal your team mates.
---
I'm guessing she is not the kinda girl that most want to mount lol
---
None of the gear you listed has a single defensive stat on it outside agility, which is not a great defensive stat at low gear levels. You can be hit capped but you will be struggling to survive in any progression fight.
---
Those mechanics you mentioned are threat management for the raid more than the tank, a well geared threat machine means you can ignore them but in progression that is unlikely to be the case for your average guild. Managing threat is the core mechanic of classic.
---
You know what didn't exist in vanilla? 12k people per server. 
---
You know what didn't exist on vanilla? Blizzard having to put that many players on every server to avoid the servers going deserts in 6 weeks because tourists are gone.
---
There isn't really any perfect solution. 12k people on every server without layering leads to massive queues the first couple of weeks. 3-5k people per server leads to servers so empty that any group activity will be impossible. Layering solve both those problems but it can be abused.
---
Thanks for sharing. Be sure to upload any others you find.
---
No I wasn't. Any blue posts before the current EULA are irrelevant to the argument. That's like arguing that flying a plane above the White House wasn't a felony in 1792.
---
Legion was pretty stable
---
I have no friends XD
---
The most important questions about rolling a Shaman: Do I want to heal? Do I enjoy healing?
---
Most important Hunter questions: Can I be the rare amazing hunter? Can I be that guy who kites like a mad man and is always on top of his game?
---
Except the "raiding" meta changed a lot thanks to private servers. It is really easy to raid AQ40 just by playing at most 15h/weeks. 90% of the server was raiding and most players there had jobs and family.
---
my bad, i thought he was talking about holding the mouse button to strafe.
---
&gt; I'll be leveling with a Warrior and Shaman friend
---
Then you're fine as daggers.  I can't even remember what I leveled my rogue in vanilla.  I seem to remember I had an utterly shit half build linked that was something in a assassination/sub in my photobucket and I don't even have an idea what I was thinking back then.
---
That being said, solo it kind of sucks because all your backstabs are a gouge/backstab or kidney/backstab and you're trading those finishes when you could just have slice and dice running.  But if you're running a group, going daggers is going to be be really good.
---
Because the ppl making the guides are god awful. Its a common misconception that defense cap is needed for tanking. There are proper prebis lists and discussion if you know where to look.
---
I didnt see no druid, it was female NE warrior
---
I literally quoted the current EULA lol. I'm done with you dude, either accept that you were wrong or continue living in your fantasy.
---
Probably your server was in a good spot population wise. Problems is, if classic servers are in that situation they'll go desert once tourists quit
---
Where's my free food and water?
---
Well i did make a few fights easier sometimes with a few tricks (think i even prevented a few wipes). But yeah it's not that necessary, it's just more fun to use your whole skill arsenal when you have the occasion.
---
I will likely just wait until 3am to start. This terrible plan is being forced on me by a crap work schedule. I fully expect to have the exact same experience as if I started in prime time. I'll be watching this thread for ideas though.
---
Why wasnt this guy wanding
---
Okay, let's back up a step. What is your exact claim here? Is it that you can't be banned for being on the buying end of an RMT for in-game gold? Because that is false, as witnessed by 10. B. ii. (one can, in fact, be banned for no reason whatsoever). Is it that RMT for in-game gold is generally permitted? Because that is false, as witnessed by 2. A. vii. Or is it that enforcement is imperfect, and that one therefore *might* not get banned for it? In that case, I concede the point. But that is hardly any point at all.
---
I think it will be almost impossible to get into the game. Granted i sure as shit will try. But my plans are for the next day. Im PST and the game launches at 3pm but i dont get out of work until 7pm. So hopefully the eastern population will be generally logged on and going and if there are any problems we will hear about them beforehand.
---
No you didn't.
---
Step up to the [27" model](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/dell-27-led-qhd-g-sync-monitor-black/5293502.p?skuId=5293502). It very frequently goes on sale for $399. You're going to regret getting that 24".
---
There will be a million of everything
---
Everlook is chill (hehe) af
---
But but, stun resistance chance D:
---
exactly, they are basic concepts...for a formal corporate environment
---
and no, they do not apply to running a video game "guild"
---
That would have looked awesome frapsed
---
I clearly remember the passive aggressive and straight aggressiveness towards shadow priests. It is the most selfish class to play and unless you have good friends who will put up w it you, I don‚Äôt think the enjoyment will outpace the loneliness and growing realization and anxiety that nobody likes or wants you which will follow you around everywhere. At least for the majority of people.
---
The single most frustrating thing to see in BG's as a Hunter is fucking pally/druid combo 
---
Cause those fuckers will never die 
---
Mostly cause my team has no idea how to CC
---
If your healers get prebis gear, you will likely be fine to run hit cap.
---
 Especially with broken 1.12 itemized healer gear.
---
You're going to have FPS drops unless they add multi thread support. Single core clock speed is going to be the biggest factor. Have you oc'd your 7700k ? My 7700k is oc'd to 5.0 ghz w/o an issue and would help if you did
---
Making more servers won't fix the issue, or even server transfers. They'd be too far gone in their poor execution and estimates and would be forced to make another fix for world bosses or keep layering in regardless.
---
the easiest way is to set up Chrome Remote Desktop:
---
https://remotedesktop.google.com
---
it requires you to not fully shut your home PC down though.  I believe it can wake it from sleep though
---
couldn't you have just left it on and put it to sleep?
---
The gear earned through Arena should definitely be better than gear earned through BGs.
---
The only idea that has sparked my interest is the exploration path but even that takes forty five minutes to get lvl 3.... what? I'm sure you can just grind to lvl 3 faster.
---
\2. A. VII says nothing about gold buying/selling:
---
&gt; All Accounts, including the name of the Account and any Battle Tags associated with an Account. All use of an Account shall inure to Blizzard‚Äôs benefit. Blizzard does not recognize the transfer of Accounts. You may not purchase, sell, gift or trade any Account, or offer to purchase, sell, gift, or trade any Account, and any such attempt shall be null and void and may result in the forfeiture of the Account;
---
Yeah for all intents and purposes it‚Äôs a brand new game reverse engineered from the original
---
6 hit is all you need as a human or orc, and its not that hard to hit at all.
---
Nice try...
---
Hah. In Hungary it will come out at midnight.
---
I will only work from 9 til 13. After it I head to the shop, buy food, some sweets, water, instant noodles, beer, a few gram of weed. 
---
Then gonna edge myself the whole day with twitch etc.
---
At midnight gonna my UD lock, and gonna rock til 3 to 5.
---
I wont have to work til next monday 16:00 so i will have a shitload of time to have fun
---
Ugh. Like conservatives don't get persecution complexes. Both sides do. Please don't try and pull politics into this.
---
Druid, man. It's the only class that meets all your criteria. Hunter if you don't care that much about healing, but Druid if you do.
---
Yeah. I can't even imagine what it will feel like to raid at 60 FPS.
---
When people on our server would crash winter grasp because we were severely outnumbered.
---
I was attempting to stay out of range of Fear, which also kept me out of wanding range.
---
As a paladin player, the light forgives you and still loves you even though you're an unwashed cur.
---
I want to add to this: When it comes to PvP, Druids are AMAZING. I am always confused with all the propaganda about Druids being "weak" in PvP. Anyone who's played on vanilla pservers over the years knows that Druids are *insane* in organized PvP.
---
Often times a Warsong Gulch match is won by which team has more Druids for flag carrying. If your team doesn't have a druid, and the enemy team does, 99% of the time you already lost the match.
---
&gt;The standard of living for everyone has gone up, but that isn't necessarily attributed to capitalism. 
---
Right, it's not entirely capitalism. You also need a functional democracy and an impartial legal system. The functionality of our democracy and impartiality of our legal system is debatable, but we're in better shape than many countries.
---
&gt;Not on par with productivity and profits though, so that's a moot point. 
---
Fortunately average Americans can participate in these profits. It's called investing in stock market index funds. Unfortunately most Americans are horrible with money and would rather waste it on things like Air Pods, new shoes, and larger-than-necessary houses.
---
&gt;Capitalism is *only* good for the wealthy elite. It's a net negative for everyone else.
---
This is just patently false. Between 1981 and 2008, the proportion of China's population living on less than $1.25/day is estimated to have fallen from 85% to 13.1%, meaning that roughly 600 million people were taken out of poverty. Why did that happen? Because China opened themselves up to foreign investment, commerce, and moved away from a communist economy.
---
You need to stop reading r/LateStageCapitalism and r/politics
---
So what? If it is legit information why would you argue against it? For the sake of arguing?
---
I'm a bit more open and not a know-it-all like most other people here. Also I said might be, not is so its still not refuted due to lack of evidence. But I'll still not claim someone is lying to try to prove my unproven point.
---
Edit: The part about druids being useless in Vanilla retail is a general consensus not a fact. Most people would agree it wasn't a common thing but there is lack of evidence like I mentioned earlier.
---
I apologize. 2. A. i. 4, not 2. A. vii.
---
What about for Horde? When Blood Elves became playable I switched to a hunter, and have been playing that since.. not sure if I should have another hunter or not.
---
Me either. It took 13 year old me about 9 months to hit level 40. I fuckin sucked. Spent way too much gold on auction house items. Got mad at a couple guys cause they wouldn't invite me to RFK (which I thought was RFC, and that they just misspelled it), and did a plethora of other really dumb shit. Yikes. No thanks.
---
And again i have never said that. It's not required but it's worth it to have at lease one.
---
same thing if you click w and use your mouse to turn
---
Get layered, son.
---
When you say pink lives don't matter, you're also condemning shamans
---
I had a friend who was so clueless, he didn‚Äôt know how the spellbook AND quests worked, so he got 40+ by killing mobs with heroic strike.
---
It‚Äôs the real reason we‚Äôve been waiting for classic. I haven‚Äôt been able to eat in years
---
Shame you still have to get out of animal form to loot the herb.  Actually a SUPER nice QoL change that made me feel nice and unique while playing my druid.
---
Yeah I can understand that, I just know I‚Äôm pretty slow leveler so I don‚Äôt set my own expectations to high lol.
---
Good luck tho!
---
Seeing as KT melee attack is trivial that isn't surprising at all.
---
Thanks for clarifying that :) 
---
I do not have it there yet, but guess I have to maybe wait a bit then.
---
Cheers guys
---
Again, no. That's just about Blizzard's ownership of the items.
---
Yeah, not really. I'd take a resto for raid healing over a feral druid.
---
Still no news about the final stress test, or the server list, and they've been pretty silent about layering complaints. Hopefully in the next couple of weeks we get a lot more information.
---
Taunt in vanilla is based off spell hit, which is why the ZG trinket for 10% spell hit is so nice for 4 horsemen.
---
Rogue is still pretty easy. In raids You have three buttons: your builder (sinister or backstab), slice n dice (keep up 5-pointer always), and the occasional eviscerate. It's better to pool around 40-60 energy, but you can do fine spamming too. There's a lot of rogue intricacies to pay attention to but even if you don't, you'll still do great damage. A nice side perk is it's easy to put down for 10 minutes AFK and come back to not being dead. You can solo farm for gold in a unique way doing pickpocket runs. You compete with warriors, hunters, and other rogues for much of your loot which means you better get used to either farming to buy BOE, or find a guild in order to gear up. You get to pick and choose most fights in PVP 
---
Leveling a rogue is difficult compared to anyone but pala/warrior, but if you can make sure you have a smooth weapon progression via dungeon quests you're good to go. It's not mechanically challenging, you're just squishy melee so you eat/bandage a lot unless you fight exclusively 1-2 levels lower. In my experience at about 30 you really come into your own.
---
Mage I haven't played much in vanilla, but it's just a very solid class. Big damage from level 1 onward, in pve you either cast frostbolt or cast blizzard (AOE farming is another discussion), you have great utility and CC, and everyone wants you in their group over any other dps class. You kick ass in PVP too, shatter combos are insane damage.
---
&gt; they fail to remember than Defensive Stance reduces ALL damage by 10%,
---
The omission of this (and last stand/shield wall) during comparisons is how you know people don't know what the fuck they're talking about. 
---
&gt;In most cases, you are assuming that private server meta is going to work on Classic. Skarm, who started tanking in Vanilla, as a Warrior, after patch 1.9. and never main tanked as a Druid in Vanilla, except raids that he and his raid heavily overgeared, is somehow the holder of the Ultimate Truth regarding Feral Druids.
---
Fucking thank you.
---
Druid offtanks are great, and I think guilds looking to rush MC will be wise to look to druids for their 1.12 itemization and ability to level quickly and gear non-competitively with warrior tanks, but feral tanks do not have as strong a niche as they did in TBC as effective health tanks. They're viable, but warriors are still the monarchy of vanilla tanking.
---
It has armor on it :).
---
We dont know how strong the bosses will hit in classic. But private servers are supposedly overtuned. We have broken 1.12 items in phase 1 with aq/naxx like stats such as Rosewine Circle. Our healers are going to heal fatter, our dps is going to push more dmg than a private server in patch 1.1. Using that as reference, even modding private servers to have the increased boss parry, there is very little reason to believe you need defensive stats on all your gear. Even during progression.
---
You wont be full threat gear, but you will likely have hit cap for almost everything past first few weeks of MC at most.
---
There is nothing that indicates that your statement below is correct :
---
"You can be hit capped but you will be struggling to survive in any progression fight."
---
If I can tank a boss with greens in MC, I can do it with full prebis and hit gear. I can do it with some tier 1 and hit gear. Especially going hard with consumes and buffs! On private server MC is spanked with 0 defense
---
why wont you see aq40 or naxx?
---
classic wow is really easy by todays gaming standards.
---
people have better internet connections, better pcs, better addons, and overall better understanding of the game.
---
what made classic hard was bad internet, bad pcs, and 20% of the raid group carrying the other 80%. but that won't happen this day in age. people care more, if they want to be there.
---
Totally true story, I'm contemplating linking his armory as I still get angry over the Rogues being so obnoxiously screwed over (over ten years ago lol). A direct result was that we couldn't clear Brutallus pre-nerf because we lacked the dps. (Can you sense my bitterness?).
---
He's still active and a well known player. This was a huge deal on the realm and he got a lot of abuse (rightly imo), a few like myself left the realm after spending or dkp.
---
About the DKP. The rule for DKP is (was) that you could get an item for 0 if it was going to be sharded. There was no minimum spend. As this was a Fury main/2nd OT as needed (which he hated doing), he coasted along on the free upgrades which would otherwise be sharded. No-one complained because he always turned up (for the dkpz) and would OT under a little duress.
---
Hoarding generally was a problem, passing up minor upgrades for a shot at something later in the raid gimped us a fair bit.
---
Also remember this was back in TBC when compulsory ensuring your tanks were geared first was a fledgling concept (at least for this realm/guild).
---
Of course, despite my hatred and bitterness let's not forget that ultimately it's Blizzard who were retarded for allowing Warriors to even equip them. 
---
If you were inclined you could simply ask any of the established players on Shadowsong-EU about the Dwarf Warrior/Warglaive incident and most of them will remember it. He has a very love him/hate him personality.
---
Only a month from today but it's going to be the longest month of everyone's lives
---
If anything that's a disadvantage for a tank, positioning a boss is often one of the biggest jobs of the tank and it's hard to do with a bigger hitbox.
---
MC attunement is the easiest thing in the world. You don‚Äôt need BiS for MC, and you definitely don‚Äôt need a flask. All you need for MC is a level 60 character, some decent gear, and a working brain.
---
Obviously there won‚Äôt be MC pugs on week 2 but they will start popping up 2-3 months in when most of the player base is 60.
---
It litterally is. Just read the rules...
---
Trying to explain how business works on reddit is a straight up lost cause, when you have shit like that guy spouting that stuff
---
It had better sir! No fishing stream is complete without Take 5.
---
&gt; Alliance side though, the threat argument is more valid. Bears are far more competitive.
---
I feel like this should be the first thing mentioned when discussing feral raid opportunities!
---
I was fury prot back in vanilla because intuitively I knew it was the best TPS but I also knew that I was massively benefiting from WF totem while using the build.
---
No. We don‚Äôt need roll playing specific servers in a roll playing game. You can be weird and rp walk around in a regular pvp server.
---
EPGP and DKP are trash, if you want to run a guild that doesn't use loot council just use a soft reserve system on everything it's the best way to go.
---
Lol seriously this is the most petty complaint I‚Äôve ever seen JFC
---
It's funny cause we laughed 2 gold buyers out of our guild  (on SH) because they were dumb enough to buy gold and then get banned, and then make a new account, just to go and buy gold again. Absolutely nobody likes gold buyers.
---
The boars in the forest give 3xp each.
---
I actually made a guild called The Leftovers after a bunch of guildies and I got frustrated that we were constantly being left out of content since our big guildies were getting poached to do progression. This was in Wrath though. I made our tabbard look like a bucket over a fire! Before I quit WoW we had managed to clear Ulduar and everything before that.
---
Sometimes you want your toon to be in a place which is neither (a) where you are currently standing or (b) directly forward in a line from where you are currently standing. At most times, most of the game-world is not where you are and not directly forward of where you are. It is off to the side or behind you and you can get to it by turning.
---
Now suppose a situation comes up where you want to be somewhere you are not, and *at the same time* you want to be selecting a character from a raid frame, or using a mouseover cast, or something.
---
You can do this by moving and turning with your keys, and using the mouse for the other thing. Whereas if you only had keys for forward movement and strafing you would be trying to mouserun and click on raid frames at the same time and failing to fulfil your role optimally.
---
I strongly suspect that the "keybind everything keyboard turning is a total noob move!" meme came about from arena PvP, where they never have more than five people in a team and they need to constantly move. Anyone who ever healed a PvE raid knows that keyboard turning is fine for most vanilla PvE situations and optimal if you are trying to keep a raid alive while moving.
---
I am happy to heal if it means I get gear to smash people to bits with elemental.
---
I'm pretty confident in my ability at hunter to be good mechanically.
---
I know I will enjoy both and I know I can be good when I put my mind to it. The problem comes from the difficulty of getting a shaman to a good gear level vs the hunter which doesn't worry about respec costs and has an easier time gearing.
---
*That is what that means!* LOL! Blizzard's legal position is that Party A to the EULA (the Chinese gold seller company which has some gold stored on a player character) cannot sell gold to Party B to the EULA (Little Timmy Warrior who wants his epic mount) because both accounts and the characters on the accounts and the items on the characters and the gold on the characters are owned in toto by Blizzard Entertainment. Again, dude, this is an absolute fantasy on your part.
---
The whole point was being able to stack several realm size population on the same server to counter people who quit playing
---
https://twitter.com/tipsoutbaby/status/1143897554469322752
---
Lots of players in beta discussed it. Blizzard never talked about all the exact systems because I'm sure they're still tweaking everything, but it's pretty clear they're taking the steps necessary to prevent most layer abuse.
---
If youre min/maxing like on live, quit classic and go away. You only need like 20 people with a pulse to do most raids.
---
I always hear how shadow priests go oom super fast. Do regular disc/heal spec priests have the same issue in BGs? Never played a priest, but Can you run around and heal your party while throwing dots on ppl in premade BGs as a viable strat?
---
I have. And gold buying is not mentioned in them.
---
When did you learn about target of target?
---
&gt;Alliance - PvE
---
**\[EU-PVE\] - &lt;Placeholder&gt; - \[Alliance\] - Semi hardcore raiding - 18+**   
---
&lt;Placeholder&gt; is a semi hardcore guild which has just started which is currently recruiting for all roles and classes except meme specs (1 feral and shadow). Competitive specs required. The idea is a casual schedule with a semi hardcore attitude. We are looking to raid 3 times per week during the following times ;    
---
Tuesday - 19-22 server time   
---
Thursday - 19-22 server time
---
Sunday - 19-22 server time  
---
90% attendence would be expected in normal circumstances. Currently two officers with more to be promoted as time goes by. Consumables expected during raids. Loot system would be suicide kings for standard loot and loot council for legendaries (specifically thunderfury goes to main tank first then offtanks due to its threat generation and other legendaries rolled on by players in good standing with appropriate specs). Raider's friends and alt runs encouraged.  
---
PM me if interested in joining.
---
I used to adventure together with this goofy tauren hunter called "Eenhoorn" (means unicorn in dutch). At the time I never thought about keeping contact, but he's one of those guys who I remember whenever I think of wow.
---
Eenhorn had a pet called "Slammer" which was named after a notorious lv60 troll rogue who used to spend all his time in Tanaris ganking lv40 allies. Anyways, once we were beginning a run in MC, and generally waiting for the rest to show up. I was playing mage and doing summoning business just outside the frostbolt range from first molten giants. Eenhorn materialises next to me, throws mark on one molten giant and says "stand back, this might get ugly". Starts shooting the giant but feigns death just the moment the giant reaches melee range. Turns out the giant resisted and proceed to neutralize every player who were unaware of the situation.
---
We also did pvp. We were in this pvp guild called "Karnage" lead by Norwegian r14 shadow priest called Trevor. We also had guild quality time in the form of zg because according to Trevor "pve is a fucking facerolling noobfest every tard can do". Trevor also used to delegate encounter instructions to officers because "this shit is hard, makes my brain melt ffs". Yeah anyways we were once doing AB and we were dealing with randoms so Trevor gave ultimatum "looks like pros are off, zerg them like mindless noobs". Regardless we had assigned roles and Eenhoorn was left to guard farm. At some point it is capped and Trevor starts going mental over the raid warning until Eenhoorn tells about this "dwarf priest with low hp".
---
Oh yeah!, our nemesis was this alliance pvp guild lead by druid called Macalister. The thing was that we had no druid in our pvp guild, so during the wsg weekends we were literally struggling. We seriously had a "cat problem". According to Trevor we were playing like "mindless noobs" until we decided to autoassist Eenhoorn to nuke down whatever he had targeted. One of the best moments during vanilla was when our guild's premade joined AB during the weekend. We found ourselves being faced with Empyreon premade, which was alliance second best pve guild, and they afked out after they realized who they were facing against. Our roster was consisted of ranks 8-13, and at that moment I felt I was at the top. I was merely r10 ud mage and still felt like mortal, but at least I was playing with (pvp) gods.
---
Before BC dropped they made new servers. When not enough people transferred they said transfer yourselves or we will and theres no guarantee your friends will be with you when its done. Of course then everyone started transferring. It absolutely can be done. Classic will not survive if layering persists into phase 2. They said layering is temporary. If they go back on that pservers will flourish again.
---
you are so wrong on so many levels... wow...gj failing
---
Dont play on a pvp server if you are not horde. You will die to undead rogues 50% of the time.
---
&gt;Ease of gearing
---
Priests will be fighting with a bunch of other clothies (paladins/mage/warlock/other priests) along the way, depending on the stats you're going for.
---
Rogues will probably have less competition for armor.
---
&gt;Spec swapping
---
Priests probably take the win here, rogues are much more defined specifically toward PVP or PVE.
---
&gt;Multiple gear sets
---
If you are trying to PVP/PVE at the same time as either class this will be a problem either way.
---
&gt;Scaling
---
Rogues will not be neutered in PVE, but you will be less desirable than some other DPS classes. With that said, 40-mans rarely have the luxury of being picky about DPS classes. If you're a rogue who shows up to raid times regularly on time, knows your role, is decent at executing your job as a rogue and understands threat management you'll be head and shoulders above most people.
---
Getting 40 people just to show the fuck up and stick around for the whole raid is a difficult enough challenge. Having them be decently geared, on time, and generally nice team players is much more important than class composition of your raid unless you are trying to be world first.
---
Of course healers will be more desirable than DPS in raids and especially in dungeons. But you wont be *gimped* in PVE as a rogue. Priests will see a lot more invites and have an easier time making a 5-man or getting into a raid.
---
In PVP Rogue is a great class. World PVP, regular PVP, rogue's are beasts and can 1v1 most other classes and have good escapes if they get into a situation where they might lose.
---
Priests are decent in PVP if you have good team mates. If not? Meh.
---
Haha cool! I never would have left my guild for raiding so I feel extremely lucky that I got to raid with these guys.
---
No, if you take it that far, then trading gold between characters is also forbidden. That isn‚Äôt at all what this section is about.
---
Nah. It won't be. It's only a matter of time before they introduce server change for classic.
---
Having more than 2 resto in a raid isnt optimal because hot don't stack. And i don't see why you would have to chose between a resto and a feral. You either need one more heal or a tank/dps...
---
Oh, that's the reason i suposse. I don't have that link yet :P
---
Ty!
---
Dun dun duuuuun
---
How dare you! I have been playing vanilla WoW sixteen hours a day for fifteen years straight as well as being a Gladiator in every arena season, while leading a top-tier raiding guild, raid-leading Naxx pugs that clear it in five minutes, controlling the auction house and constantly doing world PvP like everyone else here.
---
You are probably a fifteen hour a day *casual*.
---
It specifically is bannable.

&gt;BLIZZARD TERMINATION OF SERVICE AGREEMENT

Termination of service without prior notice for serious violations of the Battle.net End User License Agreement

&gt;Buying or selling for ‚Äúreal‚Äù money or exchange, gold, weapons, armor, or any other virtual items that may be used in a Game outside the Game platform.,
---
Well, that sounds annoying
---
:(
---
Private servers attract naturally more hardcore people.  Time constraints or not the vast majority of players in classic will have shit gear.
---
Its vital on hunter, it may feel wonky at first, but force yourself to use it and after a few weeks it will feel super natural.
---
This 100%. I want to come back a thousans times.
---
Back in vanilla, most of us didn't know better, and/or didn't think it was that big of a deal.  Now we know better, but frankly, it's still not that big of a deal.  Generally speaking, vanilla fights are not (even remotely close to) THAT tightly tuned.  Your friends won't care about your race, and any future guild that does care (and sadly there probably will be some) has a stick up their ass and is missing out.
---
Skill &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; race.  Pick what you want and have fun!
---
As if we needed any more evidence that this sub and reddit as a whole in 2019 is a complete fucking shitshow lmao
---
Please quote from the EULA or GTFO.
---
There's going to be a limited amount of Druids, they're simply not that useful.
---
Tanking - Warrior

Healer - Priest/Shaman/Paladin

DPS - Rogue/Warlock/Mage

Trading gold between characters is not selling something you don't own! *That's why gold for real money is against the EULA.* In terms of Blizzard's legal position, the Chinese gold sellers are selling something they don't even own, and any such transaction, from Blizzard's point of view, does not even exist. Honestly, keep going, this is great! I'm dead. Good gracious.
---
So good.
---
It isn't a technicality if Blizzard isn't providing the gold.
---
Nice counter-argument
---
ignore him, hes really committed to his bit
---
Stupid min maxers lol. Good for you. Probably made no impact
---
&gt;Fortunately average Americans can participate in these profits. It's called investing in stock market index funds. Unfortunately most Americans are horrible with money and would rather waste it on things like Air Pods, new shoes, and larger-than-necessary houses.
---
Ah, so you've been duped by the "poor people are poor because of Air Pods" myth. No, poor people are poor because despite working 80 hours a week they still can't afford cost of living and healthcare and so on. And as soon as a major medical emergency happens, any money they do have is lost to pay off the massive fees that capitalists in healthcare have arbitrarily decided on.
---
You should really pay more attention to why people are poor. Hint: it has nothing to do with consumer goods.
---
And no, they can't participate in profits. The upper middle class can, because they have disposable income that can be spent on an investment portfolio. Tell me how the average American (which does not have disposable income or even money in savings) can "participate" in those profits? By magic?
---
&gt;This is just patently false. Between 1981 and 2008, the proportion of China's population living on less than $1.25/day is estimated to have fallen from 85% to 13.1%, meaning that roughly 600 million people were taken out of poverty. Why did that happen? Because China opened themselves up to foreign investment, commerce, and moved away from a communist economy.
---
I'm so glad you mentioned China. China is a fun example of the worst aspects of industrial capitalism:
---
* The leading cause of death in China is cancer due to industrial pollution. 
---
* Hundreds of thousands of people die every year from pollution. 
---
* 500 million people in China don't have access to clean drinking water. 
---
* Only 1% of the country‚Äôs 560 million city dwellers breathe air considered safe by the European Union. 
---
* China produces about 33% of the plastic waste found in the ocean every year. 
---
* China has 500% more CO2 emissions now than they did in the 1990s.
---
The dollar amount that people live on per day does not directly correlate to quality of life. If they were poor by modern standards but didn't get cancer from simply breathing the air, it's not a positive change.
---
&gt;You need to stop reading r/LateStageCapitalism and /r/politics 
---
You need to start reading scientific reports and fucking books.
---
I hope those 10 persons are very influent at the Blizz HQ then. Just the fact that my asshole comment collect only 10 dislike is the proof that noone cares. See ya on PVP server.
---
Wait, really? On a certain p server you can stay in animal form. Will it be different in classic?
---
I'd say make her a Paladin and you go Warrior. This is like the ultimate leveling combo. You go Warrior to tank/deal with threat or bad situations. She goes Paladin for a number of reasons.
---
Great for groups so even if she's really bad, just her presence will help you.
---
Versatile, so she can DPS, Tank, and Heal 5-mans or just regular PVE fights and get a real taste for all the range of roles in the game. If she ever gets *better* she'll have a lot of experience doing a bit of everything. Healing, dpsing, tanking.
---
Free Mount at 40/60. If your kid makes it to level 40, she will likely have made some poor financial choices along the way with her money and not saved properly for a mount at level 40. No worries! Paladin has a free mount, and it's one of my favorite mounts in the game. The level 60 one is even more bad-ass, and again *free*.
---
Easy to learn, easy to play, doesn't die easily. Paladins do a lot of auto-attacking and don't require a ton of micro-management to survive battles. Simply auto-attacking shit to death and healing herself over and over is a fairly viable leveling strategy and a simple gaming concept for kids to learn. Attack the target, heal your health when your bar gets low, repeat. Paladins *take more time* but they don't die often so that means your kid wont get discouraged when she's alone and getting killed repeatedly as other classes. The Paladin will make her feel like she's really doing something. A lot of their buffs are passive too.
---
They are also not heavily gear dependent, so having sub-optimal gear wont be a problem.
---
And Paladins are warriors of light. I don't know if your kid is more edgy or more typical "princess/hero" lover but if she's more into the stereotypical princess/hero character than the Paladin is definitely the White Knight for her.
---
you give blizz money and get gold...
---
technically blizz is not the source but.... still you exchange money for gold and blizz facilitates it
---
You know what did exist? A lot more servers to spread out that population. Sure, no perfect solution. But this is a remake with the stated objective (by Blizzard) to be as close to the original as possible.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
They are deviating from the original by not having more servers, server queues and eventual server merges as needed
---
This video actually made me second guess rolling Shaman.
---
A tank giving up all defensive stats on 5 or 6 pieces of gear to get hit capped is the definition of min/maxing. You cannot get hit capped and still have decent hp buffer and other defensives in the early game.
---
Minimizing survival to maximize threat. A min/max guild will handle that fine, an average guild will not and the threat will be wasted anyway.
---
Nah man rets do shit tier dps so shit that they do even less than your non powershifting non mcp druid.
---
IIRC undead started out as neutral with the other Horde races, but I can't remember if the other horde races started out neutral with the Forsaken.
---
Did you play beta?
---
HA HA HA 
---
You have a death wish friend?  Because this build is absolute trash, no offense. If you go frost, you go all the way down to get your shield. If you dont want shield, dont go frost and go fire instead and find yourself dying a lot. And pom pyro is a meme, it doesnt even do that big of a crit anyway.
---
There is spell push back on shadowguard.  Meaning if a mage tosses a frost bolt at you,  while the second one is winding up, they will experience push back from the first bolt landing and damaging them.  But, I think it only encounters push back if they don't have an absorb shield up like ice barrier.  Ice barrier is 30s CD magic buff , which can and should be dispelled.
---
Going back to do some work just as the game is about to launch.. Then the wife wants me to go to her country for a visit the next week... I am doomed.
---
Not since the EULA changed, they haven‚Äôt been banned.
---
Way my schedule is now I can‚Äôt commit to a guild that raids regularly. I can play often but not the same 3 hour blocks every week. Figure pugs for MC would be way more available. Or a guild that does alt raids randomly.
---
Yes, so you need one Druid and a bunch of Mages. Two Druids can't have rejuv/regrowth HOTs on the same target. They're raid healers.
---
Innervate is extremely overrated and Rebirth is a crutch.
---
There's nothing a Druid can tank that a Warrior can't, but there's certainly fights where Druids can't.
---
I'm sorry mate, but I mained a Druid in vanilla and they just aren't that good at PvE groups.
---
Why will streamers get past the queue first?
---
How come they won't support multi-threading?
---
A perfect rotation paladin will match dps with the worst holy priest.
---
So TBC??????
---
Over-all both classes will be good for PVE and finding groups. Both are great for casuals, easy to level, doesn't die often, free class mounts at 40/60. Both are great solo leveling classes. They both are wanted for groups too but are great survivors on their own.
---
But be ready to *heal* as a Paladin in groups. If you want to DPS/Tank as a Paladin then I'd go Warlock.
---
Warlocks and Paladins will survive fights and leveling really well, but Warlocks will kill shit faster which means leveling to 60 faster over-all.
---
For me to need a counter-argument, you would first have to have an argument and not just spouting your opinions.
---
Is there a sleep in PVP?  I know sucubus pets get seduction.  It seems like it would be a minor once in a leveling experience thing to have a sleep you want to break, because if you break it and the tank is in it you will be bum rushed.
---
Yep I'm watching south park now
---
It's not defense they prioritize, it's mostly stam
---
Hit gear tends to have very few other stats on them and almost never stam
---
No idea. Probably falls under the ‚Äúmake Classic for as cheap as possible‚Äù umbrella.
---
This crafter wasn't a dwarf, cannot expect much.
---
again, the topic was pvp, not leveling. a shaman doesn't enable a warrior the same way a priest does.
---
The only racial in the game that matters is Fear War for Priests.
---
Everything else is negligible and up for debate on effectiveness and how fun/enjoyable the mechanics are.
---
Pick which race you *like* more, visually, roleplay wise, etc.
---
It's not literally worthless, it's quite good at triggering sweaty boys who think they're Method material.
---
I feel like supressing it is, ironically, the worst thing you can do. It's basically acknowledging that there is anything inherently racist with it when there's not.
---
Barbara Streisand effect sort of..
---
This is an extreme example and more to get the point across, but it's like  banning the colour brown because it reminds us of the fact that dark-skinned people were slaves at one point in history. 
---
If you disagree or see flaws in my thinking I welcome you to have a civil discussion about it.
---
But I thought they built it on the current engine. Just doesn't add up to me. But I am no software expert tho.
---
Strongly disagree.  Our guild used EPGP in Wrath and Cata and it worked really well....nice loot balance between veterans and newer raiders.
---
I'm aware, I don't think this is going to be some magical experience of a game that will make all my dreams come true. But the game is going to be filled with all of us who have been looking forward to this for a long time, and we're all (mostly) starting at the same time, at level 1. Like old school RuneScape, but made by devs that actually know what they're doing. I'm excited for us to take this trip down memory lane
---
Well said.
---
We don't know any server names at this point, or how many there will actually be.
---
I started RP on EU-Steamwheedle Cartel, but after a break I got the feeling that the heydays of RP were over there and the people I looked up to were gone as well. I transferred to EU-Argent Dawn at some point before I stopped playing, but never really took off. If any familiar faces showed up in Classic, it'd definitely be exciting.
---
yes, it was in classic and it would be now
---
Wyvern sting and magic dust are the only 2 I can think of.
---
Embarrassing
---
I thought this America!
---
It's there for me, in Canada at least
---
Which cpu will be better for classic Ryzen 5 2600 6-Core 3.4 GHz, or Intel i5-9400F 2.9GHz 8GB  i am looking at buying one graphic cards are the same on both pcs. It really will only be used for classic. Sry for jumping in your thread seemed smarter then making my own.
---
Swapping main tanks fight to fight is not a big deal. Some fights, Druids literally take less damage and have more threat for the dps to goo balls out. If survivability is not an issue, there is no reason not to swap to the appropriate tank for each boss.
---
An average guild will still benefit from stable threat over a tank who occasionally misses his 2 first shield slams or more.
---
True Min/max is like dual wield tanking, stripping even more defense gear off and making up for it w consumes and world buffs. Spamming juju flurry on cd. Using Flask.
---
Just getting hit cap is not maximizing threat. Its having acceptable threat.
---
They built it on the 7.3.5 engine and then gave it some of 8.0‚Äôs security updates but never anything from 8.1 when multi-threading and DX12 support was added.
---
no?
---
I work for Virgin media but will be leaving due to redundancy in two months.
---
Good news, I can buy a sweet set up to play classic.
---
Bad news, I have to find a job after classic releases :(
---
I don't specifically recall anyone mentioning it.
---
It's one of those survival swords that has a compass on the handle and stores matches.
---
Thats nice of you to say, ty. Honestly i find all the extra stuff ppl put into these types of videos to be common sense to avoid. 
---
Nobody wants to hear you shill your account for 5 minutes, or spend an excessive amount of time talking about trivial details. Not overthinking your objective is all it is.
---
I could never get use to flying mounts, I really felt like that turned the game upside down. I played my brothers account during tbc some but wasn‚Äôt doing any organized raiding mostly farming and exploring around here and there - I heard they got some things right but for me it was too much to handle
---
I dunno, I feel like there is kind of a trope that some Dwarves are very *not* physically oriented but surprisingly *intelligent* and mindfully oriented. Their stout nature leads to a strong *will* rather than strong beefy arms, which makes them fantastic casters in their own right.
---
It's like the Highschool kid who wanted to take dance classes instead of football, or Santa's Elf who wants to be a dentist instead of a toy-maker because that's his passion.
---
Like a niche character but I think dwarf casters are definitely a thing, especially because they have an affinity for religion/light/healing.
---
Sick forearm size
---
I dont have any expectations for the launch day. I will try it for sure and i hope it will be smooth but if not than i rather wait a day until everything calms down a bit cause I think it will be an aboslute shit show with servers not being able to handle it.
---
I found an old Neffy kill I was involved in too. Seeing myself is pretty hilarious, as I have no idea what the fuck I was thinking when I'm standing around in fear range (as a Mage), not even wanding.
---
Yeah because they would go oom and they take up a debuff slot, both things I addressed. Wtf you talking about lol?
---
We are using a newer engine, but not the latest BFA engine they are using. In patch 8.1 they added directx12 and multi threading support this had a huge impact on FPS gains. Since we won't have that we're going to rely mostly on a single cores clock speed from our processors.
---
This was done at 1080p with a 8700k oc'd to 5ghz and a gtx 1070 but you can see the large fps differences. MT stands for multi threading which is basically multiple cores working on the same program in unison. We won't have that for wow classic even though we have an updated engine.
---

You will definitely see FPS drops when huge numbers of people are on the screen, but certainly nothing unplayable or bad.
---
Really, that's interesting
---
A feral druid, ret pally, and enhancement shaman all walk into a bar..
---
The bartender asks them, "Which one of you can do the most damage?"
---
"It is I", says the feral druid. "For i am basically a rogue and everyone knows that speed wins the fight"
---
"No, no, it's I" says the paladin. "I am basically a warrior but better, blessed with the holy power, my mighty sword wins the fight"
---
Before the two have a chance to duel, the shaman 1 shots both of them.
---
"..Sorry, I thought I walked into a casino.."
---
They are tho, you‚Äôre literally buying an item from Blizzard with real money which you sell for gold to another player, Blizzard is providing the gold
---
Do you have any idea how slow it is to farm on a Prot Warrior? A Druid farming all his consumes **and pummelers** spends less time prepper for raids every week than a Prot Warrior.
---
Only bad Mages will have this problem. Granted, there are bound to be a LOT of bad Mages since it's going to be the most played class and therefore filled with players of all different skill levels.
---
You will know it when you fight a good Mage.
---
You can always get a new wife.
---
I think innervate being 31 resto was a big issue preventing the other specs from being even tried out.
---
&gt; the wet-noodle-swingers
---
Fucking lol
---
I don't know why my brain latched on to this in particular, but this is what I'll be calling every melee DPS when Classic drops.
---
You raise a good point. It could totally be exploited, and I‚Äôd love for the community not to be tarnished by server transfers. 
---
On the other hand, other folks bring up good points as well. What if your server dies 6 months in. Or, worse yet, you meet someone IRL and they play on a different server? 
---
There will always be white hats and black hats...
---
&gt; Legplates of the Eternal Guardian
---
Fair, anything recommending those legs is definitely a pleb list
---
For a 14 year old game there is an absurd amount of misinformation out there
---
That's so funny. I also went nelf. So I didnt do the race or class I planned lol. 
---
But I've tanked for like 14 years on him. Im ready for a fresh start. Now if only I was that young again...
---
Had mindfang on my shaman forever. 
---
If in doubt, lok is always a solid choice.
---
We raided deep into Naxx with casuals, meme specs, and no consistent consumable buffs.  
---
I will be gladly taking everyone who wants to raid.
---
I see you glazed over 75% of the comments in this thread and the others.
---
My memory was a bit different but still, she isnt a tub of lard or butt ugly. Looks very much so like someone who would sell themselves for wow gold

Disney also ran Buena Vista and Touchstone which produced R rated movies. While Disney themselves rarely has, they aren‚Äôt categorically opposed or blocking of them.
---
Disney is distributing Stuber this year as an R rated film.
---
For sure, I had a feral druid alt on the last vanilla server I played on and in a ZG run when I was absolutely busting my ass I could just almost keep up with the rogues. Still a super fun class though IMO
---
I‚Äôm not encouraging anything. In fact, my whole point of contracting with all these gold selling companies is so that no one else can.
---
GET OUT MY THREADS
---
I really liked this explanation of how meme specs worked *during progression* in Vanilla:
---
&gt; ‚Äú...it's funny when people keep saying that you can join a casual guild that will bring players with unviable specs. Yes, you technically can, and you might even get carried through most/all of MC and Onyxia. But once you get stuck on a boss like Vael for a few weeks the "try-hard" clique of the guild will start pointing out the DPS below the tanks. Which inevitably leads to losing the tryhards or to losing those players with unviable specs (either respecing or not inviting them). Casual guilds will already have a harder time clearing content, why would they purposely make it even harder by bringing dead weight specs?‚Äù
---
I think 27‚Äù would be overkill sitting 3 feet away. I think I would be panning the screen too much vs having a 24‚Äù.
---
Good man
---
I think ret pally and dps shamans are the only ones not good enough to carve out a place in naxx, granted i havent raided with soecifically those 3 specs in naxx before so id have to think if they bring anything to the table that isnt covered by the other spec's for naxx specifically
---
Everything i would say has a time and place for it
---
So what I gathered from this thread is that upgrading to a 1440p monitor wouldn‚Äôt be a regret for me. Thanks for the help
---
Who got stuck on vael?
---
wish u good loot and stable connect)
---
I‚Äôm to the point now where I don‚Äôt have interest in playing any other game.. Classic is all I can think about. It‚Äôs gonna be a long 30 days.
---
The fantasy of the undying/undead warrior, i.e. Dark Souls, Salt &amp; Sanctuary, Death's Gambit is one that I really enjoy. Plus being a fan of Laintime is making me lean towards UD Warrior despite the obvious drawbacks.
---
In terms of art I really liked this piece of all the old school UD PvPers: https://i.imgur.com/ojTEZqr.jpg
---
I‚Äôve been googling twinks extensively.
---
We were all bad back then.
---
Intel i5-9400F has faster single-core perfomance, Ryzen 5 2600 has faster multi-core perfomance. For today single-core matters most unfortunately.
---
I thought I was on 2006 WoW forums again, hearing people argue that druids are viable tanks and that rouges roll need too much
---
Leveled a priest on a PVP server and a warlock on a PVE server.

What's your server, guild and discord please.

---
I played a TON on the beta, as well as running my routes during the stress test launch. 
---
For those of you that ran private server launches...it's a lot different. Layering changes everything, as does lack of dynamic spawns and a few other key difference (30sec named spawns, much longer normal spawns, etc).
---
I found that if you know your route, you'll jump by almost everyone quickly. Running is 40-50% of your time spent leveling, even at the start. If you know what path to take and how to minimize going back to town, quests will jump you ahead of most people.
---
In fact, you can time it properly to leverage the Zerg wave behind you (for example, as a NE, I plan to wait on doing the barrow den until late 9s, and then just running thru an empty den to grab the chests).
---
Knowing your route, where the quests are, and when is/is not the best time to go back to town (die+spirit Rez vs hearthstone vs run) will surge you ahead of almost everyone else within 30 minutes.
---
Practice makes perfect.
---
He means player run exchanges. For example you  buy a token on retail and take the gold and then trade it to someone else, who will then give you classic gold in return.
---
I didn't play a druid until early BC, but I can't even imagine trying to tank with 165% bonus armor rather than 360%, you'd get fucking smashed like a bug every single hit, a major selling point of a bear at that point in time was higher physical mitigation than warriors through higher armor.
---
Innervate being baseline or not, having similar armor as an enhance shaman (who I think we can all agree isn't a viable tank spec) is going to trash your viability right from the get go.
---
I dunno, I enjoyed my Paladin but I really like the aesthetic of their light based abilities but also damage and using heavy armor/weapons.
---
The buffs make up for not being quite as good of a healer as the Priest IMO and having the free mount at 40/60 was a really nice personal touch to the over-all character in my opinion.
---
If you're not into healing though once you reach 60 it's definitely a pain. It's also a grind if you don't have a partner to level with.
---
You'll run into more people in pvp gear, honestly. Someone in just Naxx gear might not have engineering or even be into pvp. But that rank 14 warrior tossing nades and the netomatic can cause you some big problems. But anyone who gets that high will probably have the time to raid, too. A lot stop at rank 13 and go get a weapon like dark edge or whatever.
---
Right. It's a community run gold swap. Let's say you have 100k gold on retail, and you want 1k gold on Classic. Someone else has 1.1k extra gold on Classic, and they want 90k gold on Retail. 
---
Third party middle man processes the transaction. Retail player pays 100k gold for 1k gold on classic, classic player pays 1.1k gold for 90k on retail.
---
Third party takes 100g on classic and 10k gold on retail for the transaction fee.

Yes. You trade vanilla gold for retail gold, to get game time. So you can buy game time for vanilla gold, or vanilla gold for game time (real money)

A druid with half a brain with drop form and magic him ever time he tries. No damage incoming at that time so it's a free win

Only 2-3? Is that for farm content though? I'd imagine they'd need a lot more pushing new content.
---
Melee in general can't touch Frost Mage, and even if they could, good luck getting through two Ice Barriers and Ice Blocks if the Frost Mage has Cold Snap up. That's assuming they can get out of two Frost Novas and Frostbite doesn't proc while they're hitting the Frost Mage.
---
The only two classes that have a fighting chance against Frost Mage 1v1 are hunter (any spec) and Soul Link Warlock with Felhunter out.
---
Check out Shedo's videos. 
---
Feral CAN be good, as in he is often a top DPS in raids, but that requires powershifting and MCPs. Without those, you won't be competitive, but probably still better than Ret
---
Spending too much time as an Altoholic and only really reaching 60 as B.C was on it's way and most the raid content was no longer being cleared

Just use the teleportation device from engineering for gadgetzan. Your hearth can be at lightshope chapel or somewhere similar that is out of the way that you want quick access to.
---
Thanks this was actually a really nice post
---
You can switch your alt easily. Why not try them all our a little?
---
Personally tho, I'd pick the hunter. An alt with easy leveling is a lot more enjoyable since you're gonna be spending a lot of time on your main. The alt is an easy side class.
---
I mean the current rate for runescape swap is 1:5 OS &gt; RS3. That's a pretty good rate since there's items on RS3 that sell for 200+billion gold, and 'expensive' BiS items on old school sell for 60 mil?
---
Yeah that‚Äôs complete bs, people love to link dps meters with 0 context. it‚Äôs pretty easy to right click on somebody‚Äôs name in legacy player and you can literally see how many spells they cast during that specific encounter. From doing so I concluded; 1 wielding nightfall, 2 he died early meaning NO worldbuffs, and 3 he had 50-100 more dispels than any other player on any fight that required dispels.
---
You don‚Äôt take hybrids for dps, you take them for the extra utility, reliability, and consistency.
---
This is why I'm going to try for the blue pvp gear. I don't have much time to just block off for raids, but I can log on for pvp and log back out whenever. And that blue pvp gear is really good
---
Answer this man! Lost connection right here!
---
Don't forget that time that they got full house cancelled, thank God priests convinced Netflix to reboot it
---
Bis items in osrs 60m? Lmao.
---
The bis ranged weapon is 1B.
---
Less than 1% of the playerbase ever saw Naxx much less "got deep" in to it. It was literally only the best players at the time. That's why I think you're misremembering. If you all were "casual" then your group is probably one of the best that ever played in Vanilla, so kudos.
---
I'm not an expert, but I think my experience gives me the right to speak. I would have to agree. While shamans use organic wood to create their totems, paladins use microplastics to surround you with a shield when they use blessing of protection.
---
Not sure if bad joke... or Undead...
---
I hate rogues, so I play Orc. Plus the shoulders are Chad approved.
---
Find mobs not needed for a quest at exactly your level or one above and just farm them. That's the fastest way to level when tag competition is high
---
Blackrock down!
---
Just get naked and jump in circles while /y WE MADE IT BOIS
---
Very cool, I'll see you around if you end up going Alliance.
---
Its better to just take a holy priest with shadow weaving
---
Lots of BiS are less than that. BiS melee neck is less than 15M for example.
---
Hunters are one of the absolute best PvP classes. Especially early game before mages can one shot everybody.
---
A player willing to put in the necessary effort is worth a lot, no matter what class he plays. Of course 1-2 ferals/SPriests in a 40 man raid are actually good for the raid, so no question there. More than that and it's getting difficult of course. 
---
Having a fitting personality is rarely factored into theoretical discussions like this, as it's so hard to pin down. 
---
That being said, I'd rather have a guy who fits well into the guild then someone who doesn't, class/spec aside.
---
How to "fit in" obviously depends on the other guilds members and how they behave ingame, so that can vary drastically from guild to guild.
---
Good work! The warcry-animation in the end was a bit overkill. :D
---
That reminds me, what is that quest you could turn in at Org and everyone in the zone got a buff for an hour?
---
I could spend all day reading these.
---
Trust me, I remember as well. While I personally did not raid Naxx in Vanilla (I had to quit around AQ) I have cleared pretty much every other raid up to BfA. Raiding is one of the biggest reasons I play WoW.
---
Memespecs can absolutely raid Naxx. The problem is, you're not going to see a serious guild with probably more than 5 in it. Casual guilds won't make it to Naxx.
---
To play a memespec well you have to do 10x the work of a Pure DPS and you STILL do 60% less DPS. From a min/max PoV, there's zero reason to bring any. Since casual groups won't have the dedication or time to complete AQ/Naxx, that's why I truly don't see too many memespecs clearing all of the content. Some will, but they are exceptions, not the standard.
---
I don't mean to be a dick and dissuade people but it's just more of a "fact" that in Vanilla.. memespecs most likely will not see much raiding time.
---
Hey look at this overgeared char who can tank this boss. It must mean that its viable.
---
I just think the use of the idea is overstated.  We usually roll with two resto druids (of v which I am one) and an occasional feral druid.  It would be rare, as in I can't think of an example, where we needed 3 battle resses.  I can think of a few times where the luxury of a third innervate is nice.  However, it isn't really needed.  Moreover, the lower DPS stokes the argument that the gear should go to the better DPS.  I have a hard time abilities for a druid to get the gear for this exact argument: they are a glorified innervste and battle res.  I rather the top melee DPS get the ring or the protection warrior to get the heck because I know what I am getting, and the druid can invite and battle res in any gear
---
I agree eating pizza without being infront of the computer is less insant-gratification as my senses/brain are not all being stimulated at once, but as a result I can focus more on the sense that is taste, which makes it more satisfying and rewarding, although more time-consuming and slow. Much like classic wow.
---
In fairness, we have no idea what will happen to Classic. We could get Classic+ or not; only Blizzard knows. Until then, I don't really see the harm in talking about it or not.
---
I guess my whole point is that this sub is no more "toxic" or "hostile" than any other, with probably the exception of /r/aww  lol
---
Sort of. Played horde then alliance in vanilla. Ally in tbc and horde in wotlk and on pserver.
---
Will be alliance in classic, I much prefer it.
---
Two things, first - as a rogue I raided to Ragnaros not even knowing there was such a thing as a damage meter (thus I was Subtlety spec'ed with swords and Ghostly Strike - also used Hemo).
---
The second, and far larger regret that isn't entirely my fault: our guild stopped AQ40 at C'thun cause the eye-beam was too hard for us to figure out. We moved on into Naxx instead, but I never got to see a real C'thun encounter first hand.
---
I did lol. My poor boss...
---
It also wasn't a stingray that killed Steve Irwin, it was actually a paladin.
---
What was the loot tho?
---
I feel bad for your inbox too.
---
As a warlock when you first log in, sell some white starter gear to get immolate.  I‚Äôll help tremendously to tag üëç
---
It is if the market sets it. I don't have a crystal ball to determine it, however with the amount of people that will be playing classic, It's almost guranteed someone is going to try to set up the market for it. If it succeeds and becomes commonplace? Who knows.
---
Not a bad looking woman
---
400 F, middle rack, 15-20 mins.
---
That person on the opposite faction you just passed is thinking the same thing as you. Strike first, strike hard
---
is that one 49" from samsung ?
---
It's the exact same with the [US one](https://www.blizzard.com/en-us/legal/b8a1574a-8137-44ad-acf0-11c92e90b26f/blizzard-termination-of-service-agreement).
---
Short-term investment: exercise to make your heart beat faster
---
Same with sort of. I've played both factions to 60 know pservers at this point. I 100% prefer horde but friends, who will likely quit well before 60, are demanding alliance.
---
Feral druid is the highest dps of any hybrid dps build by quite a lot, potentially surpassing some actual dps in naxx with bis gear (and using MCPs and powershifting). The rest are really garbage tier.
---
Naxx is not for casuals, it doesn't matter how good you are. Naxx is not skill based like Mythic raiding in retail, it is raw damage/healing. You must have massive amount of consumables to progress.
---
So there's actually a very tryhard "ret" spec out there that's basically a spellcaster build, where you get pummlers(just like feral) and spellpower consumes and get a lot of damage from procs. Seems like it might be competitive to feral dps. Feraldps is pretty decent when done correctly you can start approaching rogues/warriors, and shit all over casters(until AQ or late BWL) but there is never really a good reason to pick one over a equally skilled warrior. Or maybe there is, the verdict is still out on that. 
---
But in conclusion, neither of these specs are considered viable by the most tryhard guilds, and both these specs require a lot more effort and time getting consumables per raid(several hours more bc crowd pummler) and neither of these specs are any good in pvp.
---
Eating food is my off spec
---
Don't forget, coupled with Tranquility (20% less threat) and Windfury.
---
First and foremost...the actual Golden Rule.
---
After that, be patient, be willing to die and wipe, be a team player....or summed down, just act in a group how youd want others to act.
---
Honestly I understand it for the time. It was more about tooltip consolidation. 
---
The solution they eventually came up with was just giving us Feral Attack Power based off the weapon's damage/DPS or something to that effect.
---
I do kind of miss having those "Feral" specific weapons. I remember a lot of them fondly. That squid staff off Illhoof, Journey's End of KT, Blackice, Archon Glaive. 
---
Ahh I'm getting nostalgic haha.
---
For the Alliance!
---
My BPM is 3-10, fatty.
---
It's linked in chat at 16:10
---
Eh, Spriest is pretty meme. You don't even need to be Shadow to bring Shadow Weaving. Smart groups will just bring a Priest to heal and spec in to SW so they can bring an actual DPS.
---
Feral, assuming bear tank, is the only legitimate spec of them all, provided it's as an OT.
---
My biggest regret was not playing it. I started Dec 26 2006. I think by that point the TBC pre-patch was already out.
---
I'm sorry, not quite sure if I follow you here. Are you talking about farming the pattern for the robes of the archmage?
---
Somewhat related but... will juju's be horde only in classic?
---
All good man, I have forgotten more than i can remember about vanilla. 1 month left to prep!
---
It's similiar to changing your ram cards.
---
For someone in the know it's a 2 minute job, but for someone who isn't? They're too scared of breaking something to attempt it, in this case getting a virus. That barrier alone puts lowers ps numbers by quite a bit.
---
But I don‚Äôt agree that it ‚Äòmassively‚Äô went away. I agree that it massively lost its main appeal, as BGs became much more convenient, but it didn‚Äôt ‚Äòmassively‚Äô go away. It wasn‚Äôt until late BC that I noticed world PvP ‚Äòmassively‚Äô going away. 
---
End of the day there are no facts to support either of our claims, only what we know personally. Or other people‚Äôs opinions on forum posts, which you like to pick and choose depending on if it fits your views. 
---
So, like I said - let‚Äôs leave it at that.
---
I was alliance but my friends wanna be horde this time
---
Play on a PvE server unless you are a masochist.
---
This thing is not forgotten it was never known by EU people :D but Lightforge helmet used to look much diferent (10 times better) it was replaced few months after US wow launched. It used to look like todays mail helm Blood Knight Helm.
---
There was a giraffe running around feared... Weren't they untameable in Vanilla?
---
I could be wrong, but I don't *ever* remember seeing a giraffe pet.
---
Ugh that's so annoying, especially if my bags are full of shards. I'm not picking up every last bit of grey garbage so someone else can skin stuff.
---
Blizzard is not creating the gold and giving it to you. Another player farmed that gold and is providing it. It's a huge difference in terms of the economy.
---
Going back to Alliance
---
It's too bad you couldn't have simply played/leveled with those friends that loved their classes. Imagine how much more they would have loved their classes if they had a paladin at their back tossing them buffs and heals? And imagine how much less bored you would have been if you could have had a party of friends killing the mobs for you with the help of your heals or even the help of your seals/judgement? All the elite quests you would have made possible, all the 5 man dungeons you would have made easier - they would have looked to you to complete content instead of leaving you in the dust.
---
- I will be playing a Feral druid tank. I'm not going for the MT role, I leave that to one of our warriors, they're better suited for the task. 
---
- As such I am certain I have a place in raiding, as having one Feral as off-tank is just good sense - I won't hinder progression,  but help it.
---
- Feral druids are excellent for levelling and five man dungeons. PvP... warsong anyone? 
---
- I think people are worrying too much, because - by nature - we're only having theoretical discussions. "Soft" qualities, like skill, personality and willingness to put in some extra effort are very important and independent from class/spec choice
---
I think the key to enjoy and be successful as an off-spec is to embrace your role as a hybrid. I've decided to play feral druid as I love all three roles - tank, healer and dps. I WANT to tank one fight, then switch to cat after my add is down, switch gears for the next fight and heal or decurse - whatever is best for the raid in a given situation.
---
Yeah, I think that would be a nice addition, I just haven't gotten around to it yet :/
---
what kind of weenie is actually going to play holy weaving /laugh
---
No.  I will be changing specs and that‚Äôs it.
---
how do you CC a paladin and druid
---
My "10x the work" comment isn't exactly measurable, but I'll use a Feral Druid as an example. In order for Feral (Cat) to be at ALL viable, they have to farm countless MCPs, come stocked with Flasks, Potions, and World Buffs. Doing all of that still puts them around 30% less DPS than a Rogue/Warrior. These are numbers you can see on the Private Server Logs. Bear in mind, on classic, World Buffs won't be as prevalent and flasks will be MUCH more expensive. All this means is that Feral will actually be doing less DPS than they are on PServers. Any Memespec player will have to do so much work in order to be at all viable. A Pre-BiS Rogue/Warrior will come in and beat them regardless with zero prep or consumables.
---
All of the min/maxing and theorycrafting on Vanilla has been done. Some of it will have to be tweaked due to PServer values being wrong, but none of the differences so far will translate in to a DPS boost for any memespec. 
---
Again, I want to reiterate that I firmly believe people should play what they want. I also believe it's fair to let people know what to expect. I'd hate to be brand new to WoW, be told Ret Paladin is viable, and spend 3-4 months leveling to 60 only to be told I'm not wanted in raids. People should be informed and then choose to make a decision with that knowledge.
---
SP is hardly a meme spec, they can very possibly bring more damage to raids than a mage
---
Does nobody else turn with A and D while strafing with Q and E?  It is keyboard turning, but it frees up your mouse while still allowing you to navigate and strafe...
---
For dungeons shadow priests are pretty damn amazing, dependibg on the dungeon.
---
Thet have the best dungeon cc abil in the game, mind control, which allows you to kill 2 enemies without anyone taking damage, no other class can do that.
---
Thats not allowed
---
In vanilla and BC i was alliance since then in retail i have largely mained Horde so in classic i am returning to my roots to kill some Horde
---
Hunt him while he's trying to complete his seal form quest.
---
Lots and lots of guilds
---
People don‚Äôt know the difference between ‚Äúviable‚Äù and ‚Äúoptimal‚Äù. If your guild is falling apart and wiping constantly, odds are there‚Äôs a lot more issues holding you back than that one hybrid dps.
---
Holla holla, let‚Äôs think less investment at this early stage (other than those who can participate obviously,and jealous),and more engagement for all the old folks who can‚Äôt and/or won‚Äôt be hauling a rig around. 
---
None the less, we should organize to play on a non-streamer server come Aug 13th (if that date doesn‚Äôt change). 
---
I‚Äôm very excited to see others from the state of lakes interested! 
---
The battle within my crew is undecided on which side to roll. I think democracy should prevail and we go with the majority, but let‚Äôs figure that out together before the 13th if others want, maybe? Okay cool.
---
In any event, we can ‚ÄúSkol‚Äù with all types of players who want to evolve through the Classic experience (PVP preferably) together! 
---
For the Vikings! (Sorry to those who live to our east. Your cheese sucks (( that‚Äôs not true))).! We love you and your fireworks!
---
Played alliance up untill wotlk, then switched horde in cata untill present day. I'd like to do alliance again because dwarves are just awesome. And ironforge is such a nice city. But everyone I know will be rolling horde. I hope they don't all bail after 1 month
---
&gt;You don't need to be "hardcore" to minmax. It literally takes almost no extra time. And the most hilarious part is that the those hardcore guilds are the ones who can make the memespecs work. They could legitimately clear the content with them.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;Casual guilds are only going to struggle more.
---
It's not really any of your business then Mr. Tough Guy. You go keep being a badass over there. Leave the casual guilds alone.
---
I figured. Just bringing it up! üëçüèª
---
&gt; as long as you dont try and convince people that your method is just as effective when it clearly isnt
---
Do you think this is a twitch shooter or something? It's 2 keybinds in a slow paced mmo that can put else where. lol
---
Make money, grind mobs.
---
&gt; Show rare spawn locations and pathing lanes if applicable
---
No! Don't! I still remember a lot of them and I don't want others to know.
---
it's definitely worth the effort. very few easily-accessible pvp weapons compete with Sulfuras until ZG. but don't spec ret until you have it.
---
It just makes life so easy haha
---
Played Alliance then Horde in Classic. Playing Alliance again this time around because SO doesn't like trying to fight Paladins as a Warrior.
---
I figured. Just bringing it to your attention üëçüèª
---
ferals are decent, rets are  garbage
---
Druid Warlock :D
---
Most guilds are gonna wanna fill spots.
---
Also if you were smart you would want to bring these with so thats less people to roll on lets say cloth. Cover the difference in dps it will be worth it in the long run.
---
All great suggestions, thanks!
---
Of course people are going to go for the insanely popular ToEP build.
---
Blizz won‚Äôt split the servers. Would be real bad for populations etc.
---
Can't get Frostfire, that is gone
---
Balance druids and prot palas also belong on your list. They bring absolutely nothing that's worth their spot in the raid.
---
Feral dps/tank is somewhat decent at naxx levels of dedication, and some people actually do use an enhance as their nightfall slave.
---
Cold. Blooded.   Nice you realize your mistake years later.
---
Rogues have knives to throw that are excellent at tagging mobs.
---
The op was asking for a mouse to play wow. We don't care about you playing fps.
---
Losing all my vanilla wow screen shots due to HDD formats.
---
That‚Äôs the old one: https://www.blizzard.com/en-us/legal/fba4d00f-c7e4-4883-b8b9-1b4500a402ea/blizzard-end-user-license-agreement
---
You can't take arms and shadow priest really as they're so debuff slot hungry.
---
Is he selling out and going horde? That rat bastard probably stole this from an alliance gnome.  He is obviously a war criminal.
---
I was going to and then realized I couldn't do it.
---
All 3 of them?
---
I'm well on the side of Devouring Plague being relatively overrated compared to Shdaowguard/Hex. Let's face it, Touch of Weakness is a non-factor as it's so freaking useless, it's like a single chance at a blackout proc vs an opener and that's it.
---
Devouring Plague mana cost, plus the 3 minute CD, makes it inferior to the strength of both Troll Priest Racials. Troll Priest Master Race.
---
Whatever Blizzard does about buying gold from 3rd party sites will be the same for trading gold between game versions. The evidence they use to flag your account is the exact same.
---
Well there's your problem. All you need to do is go out for smokes with your computer and you're all set. You can get a less paying job/part time job since you'll only need to pay for ramen, shelter, electricity and an internet connection.
---
I'm not an expert on retail wow, cause I quit in WoD... but I'm pretty certain you simply go to the Black Market AH to get your T3.
---
Except this is not a thorough rebuttal at all, it's long winded and based on flawed information. It's mostly just flat out wrong.
---
The guy is literally saying that warrior can out threat a Bear with MCP which is just hilariously wrong. If we're factoring in Thunderfury that's a different story but it's such an edge case it's not worth talking about. So you can see within the first 10 lines of his "thorough rebuttal" there is just nonsense information. 
---
OP simplified it a lot, but in general he was right about Bears being threat tanks. Warriors can certainly switch to threat gear, including dropping their shield for an OH, but this guy fails to acknowledge how much mitigation they sacrifice for that (no block, no shield block, etc.). When warriors go full threat gear Bears will pull ahead in mitigation. 
---
So while warriors have the flexibility of going high mit. or high threat, druids are a nice in-between where they have innate really good threat and decent mit.
---
This poster is so uninformed, just because his post is long doesn't mean any of it is valuable.
---
My man üëâ  üëâ
---
The kind of people who actually put in enough dedication to match undedicated players with their meme specs aren't going to be in casual guilds - they are going to take up the sparse meme spots in the exact guilds that go for server firsts.
---
Having DPS doing less damage than the tank will negatively impact you even harder if you're in the kind of guild that struggles to clear MC.
---
Horse shit.
---
If you cant handle playing with a greasy mouse and keyboard then you aren't a true pro gamer.
---
Going by memory here but BoK is overwritten by Warchief's Blessing. I'm unsure if tranq interferes with salv. The rest should work fine.
---
You pretty much read my mind on hunter. To add to that it's also a solid potential twinkling class.
---
We've told you, 2pm isn't "late night"
---
I played a pally through to BC. Rest spec, I healed and helped tank in 5 mans. Never raided. I liked being fairly self sufficient whilst grinding on my own. I don‚Äôt have the experience to understand the irony here. Can someone do a ExplainLikeIm5. I think I‚Äôm going to run the same class again as my friends are rolling tank, priest, hunter.
---
QOL change really but change the cursor to a pointer on hover in your css.
---
We're talking about farming straight up gold to buy things.
---
Part of me wanted to cuz of how great I think elwynn forest is. But alas I bleed red.
---
I am the pack.
---
Don't forget druids hibernating other druids! Not that it's really relevant here though...
---
I‚Äôm going ally this time around. It will be a pretty fresh experience since I never played ally pre Cata and haven‚Äôt seen a handful of their early zones in Azeroth.
---
I literally cannot decide off the top of my head. That only narrows it to like 4 classes lol
---
I prefer my recipe for a low carb peanut butter sandwich.
---
Prep time: 4 seconds
---
Ingredients: peanut butter
---
Step 1: scoop a heaping tablespoon of peanut butter into a spoon.
---
Step 2: eat it.
---
Same. I might be able to pull off 5-6 hours for a few nights but then I require a 12 hour binge sleep afterward.
---
Next episode "wasdwawdwasdFFSICANTMOVE"
---
Get the family and kids into WoW.
---
I relate to this. It was druid for me but I still can't decide
---
Played Horde in Vanilla, switched to an Alliance DK in mid WotLK. Going to go Alliance for Classic as I never got to have that lvling experience before revamps.
---
I've been thinking about it...I pretty much only played horde back in original vanilla; I never leveled past 30 on alliance.
---
Part of me wants to play alliance this time to experience something new, but the other part of me wants to stick with horde because I think I would have a hard time dealing with the soft/weak alliance aesthetic, and the thought of grouping with human or night elf players makes me cringe.
---
It wasn't really that popular, it mainly for pvp videos. Playing a spec that is only strong 10 seconds every 3 minutes isn't that much fun in practice.
---
