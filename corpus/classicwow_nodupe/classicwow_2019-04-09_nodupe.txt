What is the honor system in pvp?
---
---
---
I remember back in vanilla I started a rogue and picked up tailoring/enchanting. I used my professions to supply my friends with bags and enchants for free and was 30 gold short of the mount when I hit 40.
---

---
You can't get much lower effort than that, my professions we're COSTING me money basically because I never had cloth or greens to sell. But I do remember thinking that if I had made a better effort at saving up money, I would have been able to afford the mount. I think if you keep the mount cost in mind from day 1 you should be okay.
---
On one hand, DM gear is much more easily obtainable, which makes it have a bigger impact.
---
On the other, even the blue PVP sets are much stronger and also easier to obtain for casual players.
---
Isn't that horrible if you're trying to rank?  Unless you meant that's not for people who aren't looking to rank.
---
He never made it passed redridge.
---
Most people that complain about this never hit max level
---
hey man fuck you. I had an AMD 2500 Athalon XP and an ATI 9600GT and like 1gb's of RAM, and a 160GB IDE hard drive. That shit was top tier. 
---
Also.... lololool I felt personally attacked by your comment, and the fact that my iPhone is probably more powerful now, than my "gaming PC" was back then.
---
:D
---
I know my phone has better internet service. My super mega-fast 8mb/s down and 756kb/s up was king shit of fuck mountain.
---
But yeah, I was thinking about this the other day.... I'm thinking raiding will be much easier with better PC's, Internet, and the Servers actually serving the content. As opposed to the 40 man lag fests we sometimes used to deal with.
---
Download the retail client and play for free. Should be a reasonable facsimile for the classic engine.
---
Turtles. Tuuurtttllleesssss
---
Sounds great to me. I was FM in vanilla.
---
Because the amount of effort and time required to get that gear and the length of time it will relevant isn't enough to cause concern. You'll get a handful of no lifers that will have a good time for a few weeks. The alternative is that I can't PvP for any progression until BWL drops either.
---
Good idea, will def do that.
---
That was my thought. I hope they clump together, and I hope it's public.
---
I'll still be 29 when its released so I'm good right?
---
This would be better, but I still don't like the idea of losing progress because life happened. I'm 33, single, no kids, in just about the perfect position to game this system - except I work weekend 12s. Between getting off work and going to bed Saturday and Sunday nights I have 3 hours max in which to shower, get some food in me, prep my lunch for the next day and try to unwind a little bit. There's simply no way I'd be able to keep up, being effectively unable to play 2-3 days every week.
---
I'd vastly prefer a new system which doesn't rely so heavily on a no-lifer grind. Sure, make it take a long time, by all means, but don't penalize people for being adults who can't sit down to game for several hours every night.
---
Yes, it was common for zerg players to commit all their resources into a relatively large number of zerglings early on to... overwhelm your opponent with a large number of zerglings early on in the game.
---
When people use the term to "zerg" something it's referencing doing so in large numbers, not quickly.
---
https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=zerg
---
All 6 references specially describe using overwhelming numbers, only one of them (ref 4) references rushing which then goes on to describe rushing via overwhelming your opponent with zerglings early on.
---
But yes, 6 pools were common, but so was bunker rushing and cannon rushing.
---
Speed of the mount depend on the mount. The riding skill just determines which mounts you are able to use.
---
Everything is a hunter weapon.
---
That's how I thought it worked too.
---
Again, that doesn't mean anything at all. The playerbase is 90% casual, those casuals are going to get very frustrated very quickly when they literally cannot do anything in level 50+ zones. There will be multiple honor farming gank squads running around camping anyone they can for honor. It's not 1 kill and move on, they're going to camp them till they give no honor anymore. Then the next honor farming team will do the same. It's not going to be good for server health and there's going to be a clear decline in Phase 2 in terms of server populations.
---
There is very little chance people will have tier 10 before bwl, and even if they do then it will be so few people.
---
FUBAR, mirite?
---
Except sharding (as discussed by the devs at Blizzcon) is only for low level zones and only for the first few months. It’s definitely plausible to assume sharding will be gone by phase 2
---
You should have seen STV on Nostalrius. There was a bug that made skeletons take forever to disappear, and thus, STV was just blanketed white with skeletons at all times.
---
Reading your specs 
---
I kinda laughed like seriously ?
---
We talking about a game that even today runs on low tier toasters 
---
You will be fine
---
Who has time to level with all the ganking opportunities!
---
Feral is fine for tanking in Vanilla. I woulnd't waste a slot for DPS though. Just too many other classes that can fill that slot and do more DPS. Feral tank brings the ability to switch to DPS when you're not needed in bear and contribute more DPS than a Prot Warrior.
---
Still living in a basement suite just working fulltime and paying someone for the privilege now!
---
I can't imagine them sitting on each phase for 6 months, with how quickly people consume the content these days. Even half-decent guilds clear BWL within 3 lockouts, and AQ within 4 or 5 lockouts.
---
The comment was clearly a joke and wasn't meant to push  anything. Big yikes my dude
---
There is also a channel on the discord. People posting there all the time.
---
Haha. I used to just sprint and circle alliance players and run away. 
---
Just to see them pucker that asshole real tight

It makes it easier.

There really isn't a great pve option to give that weapon to. My guild actually gave sulfuras to a moonkin as a joke. Who else would even use it? Warriors dual wield for pve dps and use one handers to tank. Shaman were a joke for dps so really they were in the same boat as paladins.
---
Man I miss that so much. I don’t care how much I’m ganked; I want to fear players.
---
Yes, but it doesn't matter if BGs are out or not - the only thing that matters is the amount of honor. The decay is 20% so it doesn't matter if you got 100K and the second guy after you got 90K or if you got 10K and second guy after you got 9K, you're both going to decay by 20%. So it doesn't matter if BGs are out or not, it just means the total honor gained will be lower (for everyone) but brackets/standings are still calculated in a relative manner. The gank squads are going to get the most honor so they will control the top brackets.
---
&gt;I dont believe well get a beta or stress test.
---
That's nice you don't believe it. It's clear from Blizzard posts they have no idea if they need 5 servers, 20 servers, or 100 servers. It's pretty obvious they need someway of gauging interest before launch.
---
&gt;Why would they ever do shared quest items? That's a private server gimmick to get groups to play together.
---
We already know they want the early play experience to consist of questing, not desperately trying to tag a wolf every 3 mins to get exp. Given that, we can either have a huge amount of shards so people can do quests, or less shards with shared items so people can do quests. If you think doing quests to level up instead of grinding is a 'gimmick' than more power to yah. I think a lot of people, including those at Blizzard disagree.
---
&gt;Why would they put in guild banks?
---
Just a hunch that they might put in a few things to reduce the CS load seeing as they are desperately trying to cut down support costs and fired thousands of people earlier this year...
---
**Some confirmations and clarifications needed**  
---
Release date and list of server names (most important for me personally)  
---
Beta  
---
Sharding  
---
Right-click report functionality  
---
Blizzard’s plan to manage dying servers and extreme faction imbalances  
---
Population caps
---
Oh that's definitely my plan for druid, sure. I'm just saying, there are some crazy folks out there who can crack top 10 in DPS with a cat. It's... silly.
---
Does starter zone constitute the level 1-6 isolation zone, or the level 1-12 starting zones such as Elwynn Forest, Durotar, etc?  
---
Stop acting like you know everything.
---
Disagree, I want it the way it was. Nothing else matters. I don't want battlegrounds in when the honor system starts. I want it the rollout to be the same as it was. and tbh you're describing exactly the way the game was then.
---
If you want something "better," play private servers or pve.
---
otherwise, get out nerd
---
One dude
---
Not hard to get your friends and roflstomp him; then go do a dungeon.
---

---
Just know that as a warrior you’re going to be expected to tank as some point.  You should also be okay with tanking 5 mans as most tanks aren’t going to want to share loot with you.  
---
You need to be okay with that if you’re a warrior, If not then rogue it is :)
---
Yes but it seems like what you don’t understand is that it still takes A LOT of time(even with the controlled honor whether it’s 100k or 10k) to get to those top ranks. There will not be a sea of people in R12/13, only a handful, and they sure won’t be raiding MC/Onyxia.
---
Exactly. The fact Blizz simply slapped a civilian tag on certain NPCs and called it a day without bothering to change their behavior or combat AI at all is perfectly exemplary of why DHKs were such a crappy "solution" in the first place. That they also effectively ended large-scale world PvP, particularly city raids, is only further condemnation.
---
Sounds fun but i was reading that solo pvp is terrible as warrior, like getting kited forever
---
&gt; even if you don't want to tank  
---
Are you approaching this thinking you'll never tank anything?
---
You could play WoW at 4? :-S
---
That looks exactly like the PvE server I played on. We always had that 1 or 2 players that were flagged, would start fighting and a healer would try to heal them and then the snowball would go from there.
---
I wouldn’t worry man, while that might struggle a bit with retail WoW you’ll have no issue running classic.  Even tho it’ll technically be the same client the graphics level will be much much less taxing.
---
But the game will never be how it was back then - it's played drastically differently, it's barely the same game. I don't see how nothing else matters considering the fact that your realm will likely see a sharp population decline in Phase 2, especially if there's a dominant private server guild on it. You just have no logical argument for it. I'm going to rank, I've played Vanilla for years recently, I know what the meta is going to be like, and I want a HEALTHY long term population server to play on. Phase 2 is going to be a terrible experience for most people, which will result in significant population decline. That affects everyone, including you and I on said servers.
---
Cheers dude
---
Got it - thanks.
---
Yeah, I remember that mounts didn’t scale, because I remember a level 60 with an epic would pull his 60% mount while riding with me and my friends to keep the same pace, I just wasn’t sure if it scaled down for high level mounts in this particular (and very unique) scenario.
---
Rogue is ok leveling 
---
God PvP 
---
And nobody likes you pve 
---
Warrior is Sekiro tier leveling
---
Peasant/ GOD pvp ( depending if you have support or not )
---
And everyone wants you ( to tank ) pve 
---
You can get away dpsing if you are good enough
---
I actually quit my vanilla warrior to play rogue in TBC. Life is simpler, tanking is stressful. If you’re up for the challenge though..
---
I'd struggle to believe that. But it would explain why half the people never talked on vent and we wiped all the time xD
---
We need wpvp guilds to protect the levers! UNITE!!!!!!! ITS BACK BABY!
---
This doesn't look like my dorm room from my senior year of college.
---
In vanilla there was now 1.12 epic rewards for ranking outside of battlegrounds. The amount of ganking from people trying to rank up with no BGs is going to be INSANE.
---
Im excited! The community needs to band together. Its what vanilla is about!
---
Swords are viable at 60. It’s also the easiest Rogue to play. 
---
Cheap Shot&gt;Sinister Strike&gt;Sinister Strike&gt;Kidney Shot&gt;Vanish &gt;Repeat
---
Spec is combat and you will need at least the Dal Rend swords from Upper. With the upgrade being the sword Onyxia drops.
---
An assassination dagger build Rogue will front load 3500 damage and most anything in cloth is dead in about 5 seconds.
---
Tanks afk again....
---
9 when I started, had 2 60s and a 40.
---
When the undead rogue unstealths for his opener on a lowbie, it is my warrior who bodies him to the ground with a running Charge
---
I’ve only leveled one to 40 but yeah, I would just smile and wave at Alliance in STV and hope they wouldn’t mess with me.
---
Warriors 2h in mc bwl until bwl is on farm then 1h is superior. The hit gear needed for 1h is too high and gimps ap or crit.
---
I too wanted the option for updated models, but it looks like they wont be doing that, and for good reason. Seems like the model toggle is throwing hissy fits when it comes to animations. Which makes sense
---
Well done, sir!
---
Rogue has sprint and vanish to help with kiting, but once those 2 cool downs are used they’re much easier to kite than warrior who has very reliable charge/intercept hamstring. This is why in long group battles with healers warrior is seen as much more valuable than a rogue.
---
Is there like a PvE branding campaign going or something? “The lady doth protest too much” comes to mind.  :)
---
You're late to the party but in the best way, like you've only got a few months now of "oh shit when is it out". :)
---
Hi, /u/XynoSigil
---
You can have more fun as a rogue in PvP. Warrior will be stronger in the end but to get there takes a very long time. So unless you want to wait or have a pockethealer I suggest rogue.
---
As far as I know warriors aren’t that complex. Watch threat (esp with HS) use BL on CD and use OP when proc @xx% rage or less (a stance dance). Execute and OP only on execute phase and dump rage on WW if HS is generating too much threat. If there is more to it then I’d like to know. There’s guides.
---
While this sounds complicated it gets in your system quite easy. It is more than rogue though.
---
The only reasons I wouldn’t pick rogue is because rogues can’t tank and share a lot of loot with other classes.
---
I could definitely see it stopping at wotlk. A lot of people(myself included) quit because of cata.
---
Listening to Motion City Soundtrack and questing through Desolace
---
I understand why. Not everyone is a Vanilla expert and aware of most item changes made throughout the course of Vanilla.
---
For the average player, seeing items evolve over time may be unprecedented. Also having to know what items are worth getting NOW because they will be good later is a chore that even the non-hardcore, yet highly familiar players just don't want to deal with.
---
I like the idea of adding items to the loot table later, even Savage Gladiator Chest, and just forego the blue version all together to prevent confusion. I doubt they would do that though.
---
I just get why they don't want to do progressive itemization, but in all honestly I would prefer if they did.
---
Your guild might get like... maybe one sulfuras before you're into t2.5. I don't see that is really making me wrong. Also I'd assume asscandy is better for pve anyway.
---
They are always triggered about something
---
Don't care, I want it the way it was. That's what I want. If I wanted a friendly game I'd play live. The game systems to be the same, unsanitized, warts and all -- and thankfully, that's what is going to happen. So your opinion, a bad one, is of no consequence.
---
Go play private servers.
---
I didn't claim there will be more or less than normal (whatever normal is), I was just responding to the guy claiming that because BGs were not out it will take longer to get high ranks - that's completely false.
---
I was 9 as well, nice.
---
PLEASE DRINK VERIFICATION CAN TO CONTINUE
---
It can be strategic. If you control an area for a day, how much xp does the horde lose out on? 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
If both sides are doing it, it's fair game IMO.
---
I wouldn't necessarily except them to release the server lists when they announce the release date. They could, but I also think we might not see the server list until we try and log in for the first time, maybe it'll show everything as offline or something until it goes up.
---
Also, there /r/Lebowski if you didn’t know already.
---
Oh, you will be moving forward and progressing, it will just be in-game.
---
Yeah it's relative to the rest of your faction
---
We don’t really have access to the API or even know which version they are going with precisely.  So while developers might be researching and planning it out.  I doubt anything has been actually made yet.
---
Wiser words have never been said.
---
Phase 2 is going to be the one that's mayhem.
---
There won't be full guilds of people in rank 14, but there will be people who have rank 14 with gear better than a lot of the BWL gear on release of BWL and also during the Phase where BWL is put in. That's the concern.
---
Thanks again m8, didn’t realize it was that much, honestly.
---
the long con
---
Hehe it's a Marilyn Manson lyric but I see it has set off some people LOL
---
Where's Mankirk's wife?
---
Paladin Police Force will probably be putting in some overtime for sure lol
---
Agreed OP, no idea why this isn't getting more attention. Blizzard states they want to "preserve vanilla wow" and then they release the rank 10 blue set upgraded that is BIS for some classes until AQ40 before BWL is even released. Absolutely absurd, considering how easy it would be to change the stats manually at a later phase. It practically changes the core philosophy of old WoW too. BAck then, you PVE'd to PVP better, and now you PVP to PVE better.
---
They weren't.  Go look at games like Everquest, UO, AC, etc, none of it was designed to be a race.    Do some research of the origins of mmorpgs and the past, before you make any judgement's on the subject. smh kids these days.
---
wait so you are delaying a raise by not claiming your paid days off? Over a few months you're probably better off just getting the raise ASAP and taking some non paid leave
---
OP is a bad meme, star shards lmao
---
Get fukt cowboy
---
People looking to get good PvP action will start war zones.
---
Yeah it's 100% a PvP weapon. I always played with guilds that did PvE to PvP so that was how some great was given out. I was actually the MT so I only really every used it in PvE while screwing around (like 2h 31/20 tanking Onyxia and Ragnaros). But at the time it was just stupidly good in PvP on a warrior. Once there were similar damage access and swords it lost some of the lustre but if memory serves I got it during BWL and it was comparable with the other best weapons and there were only so many tank 14 weapons and Ashkandis to go around. And yeah, Sulfuras was stupid good in PvP.
---
I hear this then hear the sound of a flare going off.
---
Calm down kid. You're not worth taking serious when all you do is throw out insults. Did I mention, keep telling yourself that? :).
---
Me too pls add me and we will hunt him down together
---
That rig will run WoW just fine. I'm shedding a single tear for that 2500k though, poor thing has been sitting in an H67 motherboard for 8 years.
---
I completely agree, but a lot of people find the joy in speed. My first time levelling in vanilla is not going to match my speed in classic. I want to be 60 as fast as I can, mostly because I'm taking a holiday from work for it and I'll just be in that zone. 
---
I'll casually level another character later on.
---
As someone who’s played both I agree with “play what you want” however calling pvp servers a “private server thing” is straight up wrong. They were super popular.
---
PvP servers offer an entire dimension to the game that is missing in PvE. Once you taste it, it’s hard to go back dawg.
---
I'd pay to see you cry if you get put in an equal pvp environment. I know you'd avoid it though.
---
I do think this is a legitimate concern, but this is something that already happens though even with Battlegrounds. When it comes to camping flightpaths etc. There's a period of time where people getting off the flight paths aren't worth honor.
---
Gankings part of the game.
---
They just don't make MMOs like they used to
---
nobody is gonna let u join the best premade if you suck, there is some "skill" involved, its not entirely time investment
---
Personally I would like to see two months between phases so we have the “full” game exactly 1 year after release.
---
And now the top pve guilds are going to camp people 24/7 because they want the best gear. This causes so many problems but nobody seems to care for some reason.
---
... you realize that if people can wait until release, pick a server, then tweet that shit out to the community who can all roll on it together?
---
There's no benefit to withholding any information.
---
I reckon
---
Ok, so you don't care if a large portion of your servers population quits so it can be the same? You do realize Classic is *not* what Vanilla was in 04/05 right? All items are 1.12 so far, 1.12 AV, the patch releases will not be the same, 1.12 talents for all classes, etc. 
---
It's not the same, it'll never be exactly the same.
---
Incoming 10-15 minute videos from the usual suspects on something that takes a minute or two to read.

I’m disappointed that AB will not be implemented at the same time as AV and WSG. :(
---
Instant 60 beta with full t2 to playtest raids.
---
And pvp... :)
---
hunter - best CC in the game
---
I was hoping that they would have the pre-buffed versions of rank gear.
---
But i guess even Blizzard has limitations on what they can do regarding Vanilla.
---

---
I think this time around it will take a lot more interpersonal effort to avoid shitheads and curate a good social experience for yourself
---
It’s insanely difficult to reach R14. Not many people will get it. Don’t think it should be such a huge focus.
---
Lolwut?
---
How much for 200g and 1-60 levelling service?
---
doubt it. most 60s will be grinding that phases bis
---
good luck farming devilsaur leather in phase 2.
---
A few months ago the termal paste has been reapplied, since the original ceased to exist long ago I suppose.
---
As far as I remember we got the hint pretty quickly that it would be a serious effort to get pvp rewards.
---
Different pop sizes from pservers I guess. There might be exceptions at peak hours on the most hardcore servers but I can't imagine my server then even had a big enough pool of dedicated pvpers to sustain gankfests everywhere like that
---
&gt; Are you just going to avoid all world pvp?
---
Literally Yes.
---
\-PVE players.
---
I like the 1 inspiration due to it giving another buff making it harder to purge off all a players buffs, but this is just a general spec.
---
That's the best part of vanilla, so much customization possible
---
4.99 USD, gweilo.
---
If they added them all at launch then the gear would be overpowered for the content at the time. 
---
WPvP also helps foster server community in the forms of grouping with new people and guild rivalries.  
---
Two ways to rationalize it as you asked.
---
It doesn't matter. There just isn't any blue plate that's better than available cloth or leather. It's like that in any patch.
---
Well, semi-vanilla since there will be 1.12 rank gear in like 1.3 (i think thats around where the honor system was introduced).
---
And its not a choice they ha e made because they think its better. They clearly either dont have any information on how those items were statted or not enough time to make the changes to the items.
---
I am assuming this since they removed the WSG spell pen trinket untill phase 5 because "they were released in 1.9)
---
Slam spec is a dps increase in PVE over regular 2H fury which just spams hamstring as a filler. It is top DPS for horde in t1 gear. If you have BRE *and* BRE uses the 1.12 version with the stacking armor penetration then it can be top DPS for alliance in t1 gear also.
---
I'm just going to pretend I have a baby and that baby will be wow.  "Sorry,  baby didn't sleep well last night"

My one undead character was on my "oh god my main server is down everybody panic" server. :D
---
I lost my mind when I saw this back in the day. Thank you!
---
You wouldn't want sulfurus anyway it's a mace. You want sword or axe for. Weapon spec and human orc.
---
You must maintain r3 but that is very easy to do, it takes multiple weeks of no PvP to drop below rank 3
---
They didn't add 1h caster mace and offhand till later. You had to be current rank 14 to buy then. Previous rank 14 couldn't buy then till the end of the xpac.
---
It’s the same picture
---
E3 could be a good time but blizzard has been kinda shy about advertising much.  Kinda get the feeling it’ll pry just be a new splash page on their website announcing it.  Or maybe on one of the QnA streams.
---
I am 56, started playing when my youngest of 3 kids was 7, (now 22) with 3 accounts in the house,  WoW has been a part of all our lives. Now they are grown and on their own path in life, we still have a strong family connection with the game. Our conversations lately are what characters and professions we are going to roll, and WHEN is this going to happen! We are hoping there is a realm like our home...Kael Thas!
---
&gt; It doesn’t make sense to be in a world of “warcraft”
---
I'm at war with some old gods, dragons, and a Lich.
---
Thank you for this!
---
This is classic. Not much will br happening on contested zones until day 2, or more likely day 3.
---
Problem is, updated PvP gear is literally BiS until in some cases naxx.
---
Paladin offhand from memory.
---
Still the best machinima I’ve ever seen. I haven’t thought about it in years, but I’m glad it bubbled up from the depths of my psyche.
---
People are talking about it. I just saw Asfrand talking about exactly this.
---
The thing is it really won't matter. Phase two and three will be what... 3 months apart? There might be one or two R14 players in that time and maybe a dozen R13's. Those people will absolutely not have time to be in raids at all while grinding ranks and when they get done they'll need to check into an asylum for a year or two. This is not something worth getting upset about.

not nearly as good as people make them out to be, for the most part rank 14 is very slightly better than bwl, bwl also doesn't take 6 weeks of playing a ton and then 5 weeks of playing 18 hours a day to complete

---
He’ll probably have to play on low settings if he wants to get any FPS in cities and raids
---
Unfortunately so far we haven’t seen a large amount of OC guilds pop up yet in general, but I’m really hoping that changes.
---
If you’d like to keep tabs on OC guilds starting up, an option is here: https://discord.gg/HNT7UPq
---
That’s one option to become more entwined in the community you want to be apart of, anyways.
---
As far as a community discord or similar purely for OC Classic players, I’m currently unaware of one existing, BUT I could well be wrong on that.
---
nostalgia is hitting me hard right now geez.
---
I think it is much more likely that they will give 2-3 months for the first phase. I also don’t think the phases will have an even amount of time between them. Some of the phases have more content compared to others. From server launch to phase three start around 6 months would be an ideal amount of time in my opinion.
---
If Phase 1 is 6 months long every single person that try’s remotely hard can have 2-3 60s. Do you really want on Dire Maul release to have that many extra alt mages and hunters on the server? Not everybody is going to level up an alt for farming, but enough serious players will that it could really inflate the server economy up on phase 2 release and beyond. I think more than likely content will be released over 18 months ~ every 3 months. I would prefer for it to be released over 20-24 months with a bit of leeway for things like the war effort. Speaking of which the war effort NEEDS to be randomized and adjusted to meet the changes to the server size. It is in my opinion the best world event in classic, and needs to feel monumental leading up to opening the gates.
---
I'd love to get a year of phase one in
---
Yep. Do not care at all. I want the game to be as mechanically identical to the original wow release as possible. I don't want baby proofing, I don't want quality of life features, I want the game to be mechanically what it was. 
---
If you want something different, go elsewhere.
---
Even no lifers will have a very hard time ranking that high with bgs being delayed. If someone can get r14 on wpvp alone they deserve the op gear
---
i think there is only ebough oce players for 2 good servers like a pve and pvp server.
---
my assumption is the pvp server will be the most popular but it may end up being the pve server.
---
i dont really think we want more than maybe 2-3 servers max.
---
it should be really good because we will not have EU or NA players so it should be pretty tight knit servers
---
I dont think there is a massive RP oce community , can you not just do that 9n the pvp or pve server and use like a rp global channel
---
PvE servers in a nutshell: 
---
/duel somebody and /forfeit 1 millisecond before the duel starts to flag your opponent
---
World PvP in its purest form died forever once the BGs came out, and despite Blizz’s attempts to encourage it later, it was never the same - more like just an outdoor BG. 
---
Starting the game with BGs would mean it wasn’t very Vanilla/Classic at all - because genuine pure world PvP for the fun of it is something that only existed in vanilla (and even then only for a short time), and never existed again. 
---
If you want BG-based PvP, that’s what mid-late vanilla and every expansion ever made gave you. But for us wanting proper world PvP, this is all we have.
---
I mean, there’s nothing saying that the state of classes in 1.12 is the only valid version of Vanilla WoW? 
---
Class balanced changed throughout vanilla WoW. Perhaps making balance changes (that kept within the original design framework of the game, AKA “hybrid tax”) is more “no changes” than not adjusting classes at all.
---
Will Molten Core Onyxia and Maraudon be acessable at the same time ?  
---
Also are they equally hard or will it be the case that some guilds are at maraudon while others still stuck in Molten Core?
---
You're forgetting that some of the gear is even better than BWL stuff. On top of that, you get 2 drops per boss for 40 people, even if you hit R13 a month after BWL comes out you'll still have a big advantage by having 6 pieces as opposed to maybe getting 1 piece every 2 weeks. Every single week that you get a chance to get your next T2 piece is more and more people that get r13 and 6 pieces of t2-equivalent gear.
---
Well, you're twisting his words. He never said that PvP wasn't popular back then. He said that the gatekeeping mentality of "you're either playing on a pvp server or you have no balls" that infests this subreddit is coming from private servers.
---
And an additional video of them all roger that goes for 2hours
---
They are probably in friends and family alpha. For all we know they are getting ready to announce a beta test period with a short intern period to launch. Soon (not trademark.)
---
We won't necessarily be on at the same time.
---
dear lord this thing thinks opinions can't be accurate
---
Did you see the official Discord listing for Classic WoW stickied on MMO Champ? Lots of great resources there.
---
Here’s a Discord for what you’re specifically looking for: https://discord.gg/HNT7UPq
---
I got it together, I just don't have kids so 20-40 hours a week is doable.
---
I’m very ok with them staying on phase 4 for a full year tbh.
---
not everyone is going to get rank 14 gear lmao
---
1. You're a priest, you are the healer.
---
2. Dat threat.
---
I never understood PVE in WoW 
---
Filthy Casuals
---
You obviously haven't played classic either, you don't need to get rank 14 to get gear.
---
&gt; Enemy players will automatically be flagged when coming into a territory your faction controls. Lots of players come to raid Goldshire on PvE servers. You can attack them if you want, or just watch them destroy your town. 
---
This is the same on pvp servers
---
That whole 3 months thing that people are just regurgitating is pure speculation. Second, the blue set is much more problematic than R14 gear because of how easy it is to obtain and how good it is for particular classes. People are vastly overestimating how hard it is to get to rank 10; you can get that with consistent yet casual pvp. And it will take you to AQ40 before BWL is even released.
---
I don't think r14 could happen based on the amount of time between phases alone. But yeah, I agree. Anyone spending that much time invested in WPvP to get a few weeks worth of gear advantage deserves their time in the sun. 
---
OP seems to be in the mindset of "if it's possible, you have to do it to be BIS". Fucking, good luck. The effort wouldn't be worth the reward IMO.
---
Killing specifically marked mobs by blizzard, typically quest givers or various vendors.
---
This has been more helpful than all the guides I’ve read. Thank you! :D
---
No Danes?
---
Just play on an oceanic pvp server.
---
NOOOOOOOES
---
This means if you are leveling you will be farmed for honor. 100%, since pvper has no battleground they will be out hunting people that is grinding and questing. This happened to me and my partner, we where level 53 and the pvp patch hit without any battleground
---
It was 100% impossible to get anything done as there was 1-3 kill teams out and farming people, when you finally arrived back to your corpse the other team or the same team knew just about how long you where corpse running, making them drop by in a minute or two after we resurected 
---
We went to brd and did the last levels there, while it sucked to have to travel as there was kill teams waiting in menethil harbour it really sucks that your factions pvpers are doing the same thing but to the horde "low levels". 
---
They could not have chosen a worse plan in my opinion.
---
Why would they deviate this much from how it was released but still have dishonorable kills? If they are going to change things why change things to the worse?
---
shadow priests are redundant just get a healer to spec into sw
---
Nice assumption but yes I did play classic since 1.0 launch on a pvp server and never had any of these issues.
---
I always had issues in STV in classic.
---
https://discord.gg/3jX9s3H
---
 
---
Oceanic classic discord
---
Year is not 2005 anymore
---
Super bad time, people that is leveling is going to have to go into instances if they are in the 50 level range.
---
This information might come out closer to phase 2, but Battlegroups!
---
Is there an event?
---
Logically there is no reason to hold it back though, other than that was the timeline in vanilla. The exalted rewards for AB are good but they are never overpowered and it takes months to get exalted, unlike AV where you can get exalted in a single weekend.
---
This is terrible, all 50's will be farmed for honor. 
---
It will be really sucky to try to quest, grind or farm. They will drop by, kill you and then usually knows about how long time you are running back to your corpse. 
---
You get back, they drop by and you die.
---
Worst part is your faction is of doing the same thing but to their low levels.
---
So as a Warlock I should be farming PVP for preraid BIS?
---
Only a handful of people will be rank 14 at the release of bwl, if even that. And tbh, if someone spends 3 months world pvping 12 hours a day everyday they deserve it. Rank 14 gear is stronger than BWL and rightfully so, getting there is way harder than doing BWL/MC once a week. And even though its stronger, it isnt THAT much stronger. A player in tier 1/2 gear can easily hold his own against someone in rank 14 gear. IMO those who put that much effort into it deserve to have better gear than the rest of us.
---
Yeah this really sucks, 50 range of both factions will be farmed for honor.
---
Why would they keep dishonoroable kills if they are going to change things up this much?
---
The one handers are honestly the biggest concern. Those things are absolutely busted
---
I see exactly where you're coming from.
---
But if Activision-Blizzard is looking at this from a monetary perspective, they're going to drag this out for the full duration of Vanilla at least for max "potential" sub time, even if people end up getting bored and hating it.
---
Mage, probably. Great PVP potential. Then warrior.
---
I wonder if Khadgar was originally supposed to be in SFK, that's at least pretty close to his TBC model in the second SFK screenshot.
---
Wrong, it's like going to the dog park, but owners have to agree to a contract and get it notarized in triplicate before their dogs can even sniff butts.
---
The impact of honor and no battleground?
---
On private servers both factions in the range of 50 was being farmed for honor. It was 100% impossible to get anything done outside in the world.
---
Sadly it seems the kind of community I'm after just might not exist in Oceanic realms, but I will keep an eye on the Oceanic discord and guilds. If I could find an RP-minded guild with mature and LGBT friendly players on an Oceanic realm that'd be amazing, but who knows. Thank you.
---
Low key but high key though, Mulan is a great movie
---
They will be hunting 50's, both factions and keep from eachother. 
---
THey get far more honor farming low levels then fighting other pvpers
---
Meaning if you are leveling and in the 50 range when the second content patch hits you are going to be farmed for honor, over and over
---
Thankyou for this!
---
Dks weren’t in the game when the honor system
---
launch, so I agree with you.
---
 My wife and I will be speeding to 60. We are looking for a group/guild that has similar goals. We want to be grinding dungeons by week 2. 
---

---
But.. but... without PvE servers there is no place for the mentally challenged, physically handicapped, or whiny no-skill babies... Don't be so selfish, think of others.
---
Me and my partner played on nighthaven elysium when honor rewards hit and no battlegrounds
---
it was 100% impossible to level past 53, we had to go to brd and level the last 7 levels. You where literally farmed for honor until we gave up. 
---
Nighthaven elysium has about 2k people online at most when we where playing.
---
It was terrible and the first pvp content patch cycle was terrible
---
That’s why you got the battle of hillsbrad.
---
I loved having a hand of rag shaman in the bg when pvping. Everyone always targeted them first, making them amazing pvp tanks.
---
Grind that meat baby, oh yeah! ^(/s)
---
There are lots of types of meat and each one is only used in a few recipes, whereas there are only a few types of cloth and they are used in lots, so I think the cloth might be easier to sell. Flip side is lots of people will be selling cloth, but if you can find a rare meat that is always out of stock on the AH you can make some good money (tho likely short-lived as anyone and their gran catch on and starting farming for it too). 
---
Cloth might be more consistent.
---
You can quest all the way to 60 btw if you do elite quests. Levelling guides are designed for solo speedruns.
---
I prefer grinding humanoids because they drop a lot of grey weapons and armour which can vendor for 1g or more. Beasts are good if you have skinning.
---
You can definitely jump ranks.
---
Butthurt wPvP gatekeeper spotted.
---
Really depends on the speed of the release schedule doesn't it. BWL might release before people are r10.
---
my guess is it's Arugal.
---
Debuff slots per phase.
---
Yeah its really not much you can do about kill teams running around with full enginering and farming you for honor. 
---
Being in the 50 range when this content patch hits is going to be terrible. Logging out or entering an instance is about the only thing to do.
---
*Rogue unstealthing sound*
---
Great, now all of China knows you’re here.
---
This makes me want blizz to have at least one RP-PVP server at launch more than ever. Phase 2 sounds amazing.
---
But that's also wrong.
---
Calling PVE players carebears in wow was absolutely a thing in 2004/2005/2006.
---
Def Warrior
---
Better then the Michael Vick pit you are diving into but to each their own.
---
This convinced me. I love Dire Maul but I'm now happy to wait. Thanks.
---
Sabaton are going to write entire albums about the game when Phase 2 happens good god.
---
I’ve played since launch. Vanilla wow pvp servers were not for casuals or single players. That is what the pve servers were for. They should make it the same as before. Griefing is endgame.
---
Pre 1.12 AV had its problems, but 1.12 AV had plenty of its own. I wish they could have found a good balance rather than just go with the easy 1.12.
---
This system worked in 2005 when nobody knew the gear would get updated later for example. You have no idea how unplayable the realms will be during phase 2 if you have competitive guilds on your server. You will not be able to level to 60 during that time. People have made grinding to 13/14 an art form and a ruthlessly efficient well planned out machine.
---
It will not just be a few people
---
It will not balance itself
---
People will stack brackets to maximum and camp every single lowbie until half the server quits if this timeline stays.
---
Move ranking system to p3 and it's all fine.
---
Pretty sure at this point I'd be surprised if it comes out before September.
---
Seems there isn't the smoothest experience going on with Classic WoW or Warcraft 3 Reforged
---
Could care less what type server people play on. To each their own. Was just stating that looked like something I saw all the time. Good memories
---
&gt; I realize you gotta take the good with the bad when you vote nochanges
---
Yep, it's a hard line to walk.  But walk it we must.
---
Rogue is absolute god in 1v1, and good rogues do 2-3x as much dps as a normal rogue in pve with swing timing and cooldown management.
---
You WILL have to tank if you go fury at some point, even if it's just to swap to defensive stance and pop shield wall.
---
They're both extremely boring to level so there's no point in mentioning that
---
I just found the classic section on mmo. Will check out the discord too, thanks!
---
They already covered that during blizzcon. It's 16
---
If you don't carry free action potions you might as well give up on playing a melee in general.
---
I actually take it back. DK are terrible for the system overall. I remember the accidental DK’s were devastating to players.  
---
Anecdotal story on Mug’Thol. There was a shaman who was rank 13 and doing the grind. Some guys messaged him saying they needed help killing some alliance in world PvP. He replied “invite” and accepted the summon. The group made three DK’s. I recall the guy being in absolute tears on vent.  He ended up petioning a GM and they gave him rank 14 the next week.
---
&gt;As we mentioned before, we haven’t yet determined exactly when each of the content phases will occur but we’ll keep you updated as they draw closer.
---
Can confirm. Had hunter friend get this as his first epic in early MC.
---
lol wtf
---
"If you haven't yet, maybe you should make a character on one of our many PvE realms!"
---
Tbh the fact Blizz even made those servers is sad , it doesn’t fit with the game at all until Legion was released and that was if I’m not mistaking 10 years after it first launched 
---
Get Ganked or go play Minecraft
---
you realize you’re talking to markymark who has ranked to 14 multiple times. he knows what he’s talking about. listen to his multiple episodes where he’s on countdown to classic.
---
I feel dumb but there aren't just these four professions in classic are there? I started in BC. Where my skinning &amp; leatherworking people at
---
DKs were added for a reason. They do not want you screwing over 20+ people for an hour so you can get a laugh.
---
DHKs werent in the game when this style of ranking (pre BG) was in the game.
---
It wouldn't be a change to have them removed from the game during phase 2.
---
you realize you’re calling markymark who has ranked to 14 multiple times on pvp servers a carebeare. he knows what he’s talking about. listen to his multiple episodes where he’s on countdown to classic.
---
Absolutely agree.
---
it was both. believe it or not but people left with different experiences that other people.
---
lol technically true, but I feel like spending your 20's in a classic wow binge is arguably even worse
---
This is literally blizzard doing the opposite of what the private server crowd wants. it’s the private server crown warning them this will not work in 2019.
---
Have they explicitly said if there's any progressive itemization, or if item stats will remain unchanged once they're in?
---
Basically "war mode" in BFA?
---
Isn't this months after launch though? Not too worried.
---
If you don't like wpvp, play on a PvE realm... But better play something like Hello Kitty online
---
I did this in vanilla/bc/wrath. When wows world pvp got to carebear I went archeage and started griefing there with huge groups. In that game you could even grief your own faction. If you don’t want the chaos pvp servers aren’t for you. I’m all about camping until they log.
---
Sounds like a bad mage.
---
Yes and at Blizzcon Classic had 4 phases now it has 6.
---
If they are willing to go with spell batching to preserve the old feel of the game, going with 8 debuff slots before 1.9 isn't completely unreasonable to expect.
---
Idk reallllllly easy to farm people in IF.
---
It seems you're having some trouble in dealing with these changes.  Living with these changes.  The world is a scary place now that you've woken up the demon...
---
&gt;It’s going to roll out just like it did on live
---
It was a real problem on live when it came out. Level 60 pre-mades would gank in world pvp while waiting for their bg queue. This was a compounding problem on servers with a population imbalance. The side with the larger population would have longer wait times in queues, which means there are more of them doing world pvp for longer while waiting for queues, further adding to the existing imbalance.
---
There were also groups of 60s would get together and do laps around level 50-58 questing zones, ganking everything that moves until diminishing returns got too low, and then they would move on to their main event for the night: BGs or dungeons. Ganking for honor was just an appetizer, not the main course.
---
It does not take long for one group of 60s to kill everyone in western plaguelands multiple times and then move on, so the trouble caused by one group does not last long. The problem is that there are dozens of different groups all doing this same thing, which means the zone is being camped by different level 60s non-stop for hours at a time.
---
I plan on purchasing many wow tokens and selling them \\s  
---
Although it is messed up that grinding at work is way more efficient than grinding in game.
---
Nah its the other way around. When you fresh hit 60 eviscerate is gonna so much of your damage. It does good damage even with shit gear. Since hemo swords/mace/fist builds combo points fast its much better than dagger. Also there are limited amount of blue daggers that does not have annoying procs.
---
I have a feeling we're gonna get around 5k server pop. It's probably what was "intended" for vanilla and still leaves room for a couple thousand tourists per server since 3k-5k is still a healthy population
---
I'm struggling with this. I'm just now getting my stuff together in my early 20s. Starting Uni and looking too the future. I probably shouldn't play.. but it's tempting.
---
I am confused by the Tauren riding a human mount (horse) up the steps, how?
---
It will, as long as Activision doesn't screw it up.
---
No that's wrong
---
Is hand of A’dal title really that impressive?
---
It seems like things are going very smooth for classic... we're getting updates damn close to weekly. They wouldn't be doing that if they weren't working hard and things weren't moving smoothly.
---
Ya.. I grinded to rank 11 basically just to get a mount because gold was so hard to come by. This of course led to me never caring about raiding again and, I basically only PvP'd after that living at Black Rock Mountain ganking UBRS groups as they cowered in fear of my pointy Mage shoulders😎😂
---
Just add the bug for a day next year on april 1st.
---
I'm afraid that, if they had to pay a team to be on live support for this game, they'd not even release Classic.
---
Their resources seem clearly devoted to present-day/retail WoW.
---
Rankers will farm level 50 players and camp them until they don’t give honor anymore. Server populations will tank hard during phase two when casuals quit because of this. Blizzard is making a huge mistake.
---
&gt; farming things like transmog
---
Transmog isn't in classic. People can have themed sets, but they're pretty rare.
---
The best money makers are materials for raiding, and the cooldowns like arcanite transmute and mooncloth.
---
Me and my partner played on a private server when honor rewards hit and no battlegrounds
---
it was 100% impossible to level past 53, we had to go to brd and level the last 7 levels. You where literally farmed for honor until we gave up.
---
The private server has about 2k people online at most when we where playing.
---
It was terrible and really sad, our factions pvp group did the same but against their 50's. The big pvp groups avoided eachother as they got far more honor farming people
---
Have you played a vanilla player server? the PvE realms die quick and your only option is PvP ones  
---
  
---
Like I said I played WoW back in 2004 on a PVP realm and the modern day vanilla player servers are nothing like original WoW. 
---
Classic WoW is going to have a massive influx of nolife neckbeards trying to climb the ranks by doing nothing but ganking and camping in WPVP.   
---
You better choose your faction wisely because you're shit out of luck if there is a faction imbalance.
---
It’s going to cause so many people to quit before BWL is released. Big mistake on Blizzards part. This plan will tank the population about 6 months after release.
---
I did not experience this at all, honor farming in southshore was just way too efficient compared to anything else
---
Ah, Desolace...
---
Only difference is people will treat classic a lot more seriously than private servers.
---
NOPE boys are already planning out which zones/flight paths are most efficient honor/hr...
---
"a reason" != "a *good* reason"
---
The simple solution was to make it so on PVE servers you couldn't kill quest people.  On PVP servers, go get a group of PVPers to help you.  DKs as implemented were a stupid idea.
---
It will be bad for those still leveling yes, but also there are a lot of people here justo for de wPvP... It will be fun...
---
DHKs didn’t solve any problem, griefs still griefed. What it did do was kill world raids. Nobody wanted to raid towns anymore if getting a dk hurting their rank was a possibility
---
Its stupidly expensive to build too. We also gave it to a pally because noone could be arsed paying for that shit.
---
It will help a lot with the social aspect of the game, when you had to organize to get shit done and don't be camped
---
I would assume that there will not be a WoW token available to sell in classic.  
---
Classic is supposed to be free as long as you have an active WoW account... but i don't think you can sell tokens on classic for gold in classic. I would assume so because it wasn't around til recently anyway...
---
So you're gonna be a guildmaster of a top tier hardcore raiding guild?
---
If you are in the level 50 range when this content cycle hits you are going to be farmed for honor. Me and my partner where 53 on a private server with about 2k online in prime time and experienced this. 
---
1-3 kill teams cycled whatever zone we tried, when we did the quests deep in the arachnid cavers south of fire plume ridge they literally knew kind of how long time the corpse run was and made sure to return, drop by and kill us and then move on. 
---
Our factions kill team did the same thing but in other zones. We ended up in brd to get anything done. 
---
Menethil was untraversable and it usually took 3-4 corpse runs before you got to take the boat, as they stood around and farmed you for honor. 
---
It was quite frustrating being farmed, i do not belive this patch cycle is a good idea if you want people to enjoy your world. Let pvpers farm their honor in battlegrounds and keep their hands of the low levels still trying to reach 60.
---
I'm lucky enough to have already ruined my 20's, might as well keep going y'know?
---
"haha let's jerk each other off" -substance-less post from OP
---
yeah that's kinda what i thought but since people are so interested in transmog NOW in current expansions... i would assume that the interest in it would carry over to classic servers as well to some degree. At least a higher interest then there was back in vanilla.  
---
I figured the things you mentioned would be the best though. Lots of people care about their raiding more than anything else lol
---
Hope you're right
---
Not likely on fresh server though. Sorry.
---
I remember taunting and being taunted by enemy players. /chicken
---
The circle is now complete.
---
The game started *really* going downhill when blizzard started overly catering to absolutely every player
---
Level 5 guy wants to join the raid?  Sure, come on down.
---
Level 5 guy tags the level 11 bread vendor? DKs for everyone over 17th level! YAY
---
Wow was not the first, second, third or even fifth mmo. Many of the people who played at launch came from other mmo and knew the advantages that came with racing toward the end game. At launch wow was even considered casual compared to previous mmo, and the time investment to get to level cap was a fraction of the time required from other mmo. The racers definitely existed back then, there were just less of them because there were fewer experienced mmo players.
---
Flash forward to today and now there are tons of experienced mmo players, and tons of racers.
---
Racing to the end has less to do with the design of the game, and more to do with the people that play it. New players are more likely to take it slow and enjoy the game while experienced players are more likely to try to speed through.
---
1000 times this. For me ultimately when vanilla ended so did my enjoyment for wow. Much like you I went back to check in from time to time but it never felt the same. I'm hoping if they do want to end up doing TBC they don't force vanilla servers into  it. May be a pain in the ass and I may be alone here but I feel the best way would be to add TBC servers where you can start at 60 with generic shit almost like a boosted character and play through the xpac that way.
---
All it means is that you raided SSC/TK in BC, or at least had the attunement quests in your log before they were made unobtainable. So, not really? But I think most people are impressed when they see people with retired titles/gear. And it was over 10 years ago at this point.
---
WTF? Why the hell is the honor system not live at launch?  That makes no fucking sense!
---
Oh, I was just sad that it wasn't being overclocked, that chip is known for an easy 4.5Ghz.
---
This will be AWESOME
---
I feel you. I made the extremely risky choice to join my friends on a 3 week bike trip in late June/early July. If I miss the release day, you know what, so be it. But damn would it be nice if it was like, mid July.
---
Getting married soon, buying my first home soon, have step kid. Full time job.
---
I refresh this subreddit multiple times a day. Do what makes you happy man. There is no  "normal" life progression. I could give a fuck less what my "peers" are doing. In gonna be taking a week off work to no life classic wow and get cheeto dust all over my keyboard. Fuck it. Literally will be the only time we will experience this in are lifetimes.
---
huh?
---
Why? We didn’t when classic launched.
---
You are also talking about blue gear which they reallt dont seem to get
---
The golden era
---
I was thinking it shouldn’t be a big deal seeing as I never got a piece of T6 but had 5/5 T5 on my hunter and hand of adal. Yet I never saw illidan or set foot in sunwell, quit raiding during black temple progression.
---
Ignoring puts the burden on people who are trying to enjoy the game without racist, etc trolls.  It is a significant burden to ask each person who doesn't want to deal with each troll to take some action.  It is enough to make many people not want to deal with such an environment.
---
So it shouldn't be surprising that Blizz and many of the players prefer the simpler lower effort solution of one mute per troll.
---
Sounds like a pretty social objective.
---
It’s killing me how few people seem to understand how much of a problem this created, glad someone gets it
---
I played wow for years without ever thinking about raiding.
---
&gt;I think it takes at least 14ish weeks to reach R14 if you are 1st in honor each week.
---
Why would it take 14 weeks to climb 14 ranks if you are consistently first?
---
And while that might deal with the weapons the blue gear still persists, as it is far more available it will drive an insane honor farm for pve'rs aswell. Making the 50 range impossible to do in the outside world when that content cycle hits as there will be kill teams out farming for honor.
---
Shit, I hope not. I’m married as fuck.
---
Ion has continually said during his retail AMAs that classic announcements will be left to the classic team and it’s being released in summer.
---
I get everyone’s anxious but I doubt it’ll be delayed now. They’ve said so many times Summer. Gotta stay positive my man
---
no it was always like that. would be incredibly stupid otherwise, even more stupid that is.
---
Totally agree.
---
But for the love of god, please no night elf priests...
---
Your Mt should've farmed an ironfoe!
---
Come on guys, there's no need to over-exaggerate, I'm sure we're all be fine.
---
\*Hops in time machine to see phase 2 with own eyes\*

[Classic Phase 2.](https://i.redd.it/ap00vvdvqcu11.jpg)
---
What is pahase 2? Haven't been keeping up with classic recently.
---
&gt; Having absolutely zero battleground access for weeks  
---
Do you really imagine them going from P1 to P3 in weeks?
---
&gt; Have you played a vanilla player server?
---
I have 2 60s on Light's Hope and the WPVP isn't like it use to be back in 2004.
---
Roll horde. Don’t gotta worry about shamans purging your shields
---
now this is a detailed explanation.
---
When PvP rewards were initially released you had to have the rank to use them. It was changed later.
---
Just the facts ma’am.
---
This guy wikipedias.
---
cringe.
---
When pvp rewards were released you had to have the rank to use them. It was changed later.
---
I remember a horde working its way from Org up to Darnassus; cutting through Astraanar. 
---
Turns out that, in un-death, Horde and Alliance could finally speak a shared language. They were not pleased.
---
Was a parent then already.   Except this time the kids might be raiding with Mom and Dad :)
---
Oh! That's awesome!
---
Please repost in the WoW subreddit
---
I wonder how hard it would be to get a no flying Nagrand.  Years away I know lol
---
Can confirm, played with a partner on private servers when this happened, we where level 53 and it became impossible to move, quest, grind or much of anything in any higher level zone. Kill teams circled the area. It would have been kind of fun if our faction had not done the same but to their 50's and rarely clashed with eachother. 
---
We ended up in brd for the rest of the levels to 60, we gave up when we realised they approximately knew the time it took to corpse run, meaning they dropped by when they knew you had ressed, killed you, moved on and came back.
---
Being farmed for honor is a really sucky feeling.
---
&gt;Have you played a vanilla player server?
---
I have 2 60s on &lt;Name Redacted because Mods don't allow it&gt; and the WPVP isn't like it use to be back in 2004.  
---
People on vanilla player servers do WPVP like its their job and it is never a fair fight. The devilsaur mafia is no joke either.
---
I play troll priest, and spec the traditional disc/holy build with the exception of ditching a couple points here in there in either tree for blackout in the shadow tree. So the spec ends up being about 24/25/2. That way shadow guard can proc black out. I generally will dot, mind blast, psychic scream, flash heal, holy fire wand, then mind blast again. Holly nova if I need to for quick damage and healing. I wear mostly t2 mixed in with a lot of R14 gear for stamina. It's fun but challenging. 1v1 is usually a loss until you learn each class.  Dueling shamans is horrible.
---
Hi, /u/Haraakviking
---
I’m with you man, but apparently we’re in the minority.
---
To be fair, September IS summer. I just think everyone has gotten their hopes too far up that they'll have time off work/school in the "prime summer" when it very well seems more likely to be September (Which is also September, but unfortuantely doesn't line up as well for jobs/school)
---
Things other then Kazaak are fine. Had someone one of the Bronze dragons up to Org; that was fine.
---
The problem with Kazaak is that he will feed his own health bar and shut down a city until Blizzard finally steps in and shuts him down.
---
I was just thinking about this the other day. I couldn’t remember anything about it other than hide and seek hide and seek haha.
---
So pve players will be pvping too... its going to be a bloodbath
---
they’re all 3 insufferable.
---
I know there is no lifers hardcores wannabe. But those are the minority, and if they are the majority it doesn't matters I'm sure you will find nice wpvp, maybe you're right and you get that after fase 3 when all the wannabes are farming honor in the Bg
---
I probably Will. Thanks for the tip
---
My first comment was unnecessarily aggressive, I apologise to you
---
Right? Haha
---
what a monumentally small concern that is, too
---
I don't see why that's "overbuffed" though. Defense works on any kind of melee, whatever type the damage.  And you're going to be in plate anyway.
---
I'll get downvoted to oblivion here, but remember my words.  
---
honour system with no bgs will be a disaster. Sorry.
---
And yes, Ive played pvp vanilla realms
---
Fuck, this is bad. Honor system without battlegrounds. I wish I could convince my friends to play PvE, but I'm forced to play PvP, and now my worst nightmare will become a reality - to be honor fodder for the PvP autists.
---
Would've made a good April Fool's, bit late...
---
https://youtu.be/AMmkS6L4Qp4 around 3:50 in the video.
---
Ok, looks like 12 weeks of you are first every week.  Just pointing out that isn’t like the day phase 2 comes out 10% of the players are decked out in R14 gear, it will take awhile and we may see Phase 3 and BWL released before many people have rank gear.
---
Yeah, but usually with wolfshead helm bugs and that gnomer mace.
---
when you’re 11 years old.
---
Do discs also have mana issues like shadow? How is healing raid groups with this build? Thanks man
---
the fuck is this racist shit?
---
The real question is what happens after Phase 6?
---
Nearly 50, and all my close friends are absolutely fizzing to sink some disgusting hours into classic wow.
---
Well if they're looking at it from a monetary perspective then they want to do whatever maximizes subscriber count. They've got plenty of post-naxx options if subscriptions stay up.
---
I forgot about the screenshot section on the site. It was pretty cool to see some of the screenshots that were featured.
---
Like this, phase two will now be known as PvP phase.
---
No so that's actually the purpose of disc hybrid spec in vanilla. It's the mana build. Most priests go disc/holy in early vanilla for mana regen before they  get more gear then switch to holy. I just think for PvP it's great even with gear because you can last longer in fights. It's great for raid healing as well because it is actually what most healers do anyway.
---
The ratio of content at max level to leveling content will tell you a lot.
---
You're right, I'm stoked!   
---
Im gonna consider this the universe paying me back for making me wait 20ish years to find out the end of Game of Thrones :D
---
I bet you she must've spent all nighters imagining all the possible worst case scenarios that might shake that foundation, here's a few examples : " OMG is it another woman ?" ..." OMG maybe he's finally coming out" ..." OMG maybe he already has a secret son/daughter that he hasn't told me about and I'm going to meet them for the first time".
---
Those were just a few of the possible scenarios your wife must've gone through, but merely the tip of the iceberg! de-escalation advised before fuming from the ears is visible.
---
Nothing better than shitting on alts in hillsbrad to get the big boy characters out so i could have fun 15v1 fights and start a casual shitstorm in between Tarren Mill and Southshore once the bois from org and UC arrive.
---
i think there was a poll some time ago asking people what age they started playing and the vast majority was early teens
---
No such thing as a fair fight, and honestly thats half the fun of it.
---
You can be a ret paladin or an elemental shaman or a balance druid, sure, just don't be surprised when 9/10 raiding guilds turn you down because you're semi-useless in raids.
---
Good old Talesalvo.
---
"horrible idea for everyone"
---
"horrible for everyone involved"
---
Please don't speak for everyone. Some of us are looking forward to getting our pre-1.5 PvP experience back for a while. I get that not everybody is excited for this and wants BGs out on day one and whatnot, but not all of us feel the same way about this.
---
the cool thing about pve servers is that no one remotely decent will even touch them, it's going to be like going back in time to 2004
---
I am also in Australia, and while internet speed is important the timing of raid etc is more important. It's not realistic (atleast for me) to raid at 7-8pm US time. Will there be Oceania servers in Classic?
---
Actually, I have a ton of room to talk, as I'm not really a part of the circlejerk of elitism. I'm just a guy who is going to play it for the right reasons. Personal enjoyment, and not to prove anything to.... well nobody because nobody cares.
---
Leveling an alt during phase 2 is going to be a bloodbath
---
Not really
---
How does it not make sense?
---
Bla bla bla insert #nochanges rant
---
I put a friend on follow for an entire MC raid untill Ragnaros. No one noticed.
---
If you and your guild are really coordinated... you see the other raid and the call goes out over ~~Vent~~ Discord "Everyone flag on the count of 3. 1... 2..."
---
Lol told ya...
---
Why would it change anything? Like if there were BGs at the start I would play a warrior but since they’re in phase 2 I’m gonna play mage? That doesn’t even make sense.
---
Yep, I tried out Balance at 40 just for shits and giggles, and couldn't get through a single quest without ragequitting back to feral. Sure it had good damage, but the RNG of roots breaking / not breaking pissed me off, and I had to sit and drink every 2 or 3 mobs.
---
90% of the time you will only get groups is if:
---
A) You make the group
---
B) You are friends with the group leader
---
C) You outperform
---
D) Luck
---
My buddies and I were talking about whether the [Classic PvP Content Plan](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/classic-pvp-content-plan/146049) should affect our faction/race/class choices (since World PvP is going to be so intense in Phase 2).  I was curious to see what other people were thinking, so I put together this short survey.  Let me know what you think!
---
August+sept+oct+nov+dec + 1/2 July = 5.5, not 4.5
---
If we end up with 4 to 5 months of MC and not honor system, the player base will riot or leave.
---
Yeah, because the Alliance and Horde had been in open war since about...wait, when did the war start exactly? You know, after they both came together to defeat Archimonde at Hyjal...? When was it and what was it again, you know, the big...thing...that got them to openly wage war against each other again...
---
Oh wait, you're just talking shit and don't have a damn clue about the lore. Alliance and Horde had been bascially living with an unstable ceasefire ever since Hyjal. There were skirmishes, yes. Smaller squabbles over ancestral lands or resources, yes. But there was no open war. Hell, Thrall was working on making peace with the Alliance pretty much the whole damn time.
---
Also, "those servers" were there from the start, they were the original way the game was meant to be played. Your PvP servers were added as an afterthought. Just because you want to gank people nonstop and get a little egoboost doesn't mean that anything that doesn't let you indulge your ego "doesn't fit with the game" - especially if, as I already said, it was the way the game was meant to be played from the beginning, the game was designed around that fact. Hell, the honor system was added months after launch, so I don't give a shit what your deluded ass thinks, world PvP is not the fucking point of the game. It just isn't, deal with it.
---
First, you need to come up with an idea for your character. Try to include a backstory, personality, and a lore friendly name (ie. not Xxaragornxx)
---
Next, go to a tavern in a major city and see if anyone there is RPing. Those are the most common places to find RP outside of guilds. The Blue Moon Inn in Stormwind was my favorite place. Also, you should join an RP guild that matches your character. For example, a Dwarf or a Tauren might join a clan based guild, while a Human might join a military order. Class based RP guilds are popular as well. 
---
When you actually RP, be sure to write as your character would write. Usually for first time RPers it's easiest to make a character that matches their own personality, and how they'd view themselves in that world. Also, make sure to use proper spelling, grammar and punctuation (unless your character wouldn't, for example, when writing out the accent of a Troll or a Dwarf) Also, avoid using abbreviations such as 'lol, wtf, rn, omg, etc.' 
---
Finally, you might want to install a few RP based addons. However, it's too early to say what will be available, so hold out on that until closer to launch.
---
Don't be worried about 'offending people trying to have a good time'. Most RPers come from tabletop backgrounds, and are very welcoming and friendly. As long as you're not outright griefing people, I'm sure you'll have a great time.
---
"haha I was just joking haha you fell for it"
---
Nice.
---
You the newbie asking questions about class and spec on a forum will find that successfull end game raiding requires you to min-max almost every aspect of your character. Talents, gear, preparation and skill/tactical knowledge. 
---
That being said, i am not gonna min-max my race or class, but that does not make it any less true that for example Dwarf priest is better in end game. 
---
Play as any race/class/spec you want but if you are going after end game pve or end game pvp. You are going to find that being somewhat optimal is important.
---
True.
---
But never expect actual thought to go into profit margin decisions.
---
I wish, it's going to be pretty similar to the current iteration on live of just rush to the boss.
---
I remember back in vanilla, before patch 1.5 when people were quitting the game in droves, just a mass exodus from World of Warcraft over world PvP.
---
Oh wait.
---
In all seriousness, as somebody who is about as filthy casual as it gets, when I started playing in early 2005 the PvP system did not discourage me or put me off. I embraced it and spent more time screwing around PvPing and exploring than I did actually questing for several months.
---
What I'm trying to say is assuming that the pre-1.5 wPvP model is "bad for the casuals" is a little presumptuous. Some of us enjoy the competition, constant threat of danger, etc.
---
I agree with others, for those who don't prioritize or even enjoy wPvP, the PvE/Normal servers are an excellent choice. You can still flag yourself if you want to scratch that wPvP itch now and then, but you have more control over when and where. But please remember that a lot of us like the way PvP servers work, and liked the pre-BG PvP system just fine and are looking forward to having the chance to experience again for a while.
---
They shouldn't have done that, DK were put in for a reason and if he went ahead and killed someone that fell under that, he should have accepted the consequences.
---
Easiest option, is make friends with a healer or a tank while leveling if you don't have any starting the game up with you.
---
Preferably a guild leader aiming to raid or PVP heavily later ;)
---
World PvP is going to be nuts in Phase 2, for two reasons: (1) BGs aren't getting released until Phase 3, which means World PvP is the only way to farm honor, and (2) the PvP Rank Rewards are the 1.12 versions, which were much more powerful than their earlier counterparts and on-par with many of the raid drops in MC and BWL.  
---
Since people are going to be World PvPing like *crazy* once Phase 2 hits, I'm reconsidering a few of my choices (like, which racials would be better for World PvP, etc).  Wanted to see if anyone else was thinking along the same lines.
---
The 1.10 version of Savage Gladiator Chain isn’t really better. They removed 20 defense and added 13 STR and 14 AGI. So it’s no longer useful for tanks, but quite a bit better for dps.
---
You literally can't do that. With no stats on your gear and no talents, tanks would be getting 2-shot by trash mobs and DPS casters would OOM after just a few spells.
---
its the girls server for a reason.
---
I'm glad it is releasing this summer.  I am a teacher so I will be off, otherwise I would waste all of my sick days.
---
Did you think sarcasm was serious? Yikes
---
To be honest that seems like overthinking and almost sounds a bit min/maxish. I’m offended.
---
Agreed. I don't think this even falls under no change as it is a change that would have been instantly made back in the  day if camping was that bad
---
This but non ironically
---
My daughter is 5...i let her make a mage and she spams whatever I have bound to 1 for her.
---
wait you're right
---
Try 500dps VS 1000dps in raid gear.
---
Even the so-called "god of Ret" Esfand, in super-BIS gear, stacking consumes and world buffs, struggled to do 500 DPS single target. Whereas rogues/warriors/warlocks/mages are pumping out 1k+ easily.
---
Phase 2 will probably be 6-8 months after launch. Leveling takes a long time(probably close to 200h for less experienced/casual players). That means that playing 40 hours a week, it would take you over a month to level. At 20 hours, almost 3 months. Gear acquisition is also very slow in MC, compared to modern wow. Most guilds will start raiding around 4-6 weeks in, but more cause groups might takes 2-3 months.
---
Yeah, they suck ass. 100% the vanilla thing I most hoped they'd change.
---
It’s not really even just about R14 or even R12-14 for that matter. Even the 1.12 R6-10 sets are very, very good. Especially for casters. The R10 mage shoulders are debatably BIS til Naxx and the mage/warlock sets are better than T1 for PvE. I guess if they just go full 1.12 itemization for raid/dungeons then I guess it wouldn’t be a huge upgrade from preBIS but doing full 1.12 itemization is a HUGE game change from how classic actually was. I really believe it would be best for the game to have progressive itemization because if there isn’t progressive itemization then Classic WoW really isn’t an authentic experience.
---
So many people worried about picking the wrong server. It's not like it's ever going to matter. You'll have fun no matter what, and if you're not, you're probably not good enough to be a member of Method anyway.
---
Well, it was like that in the real vanilla. Plus, it allows time for people to level up to 60 before worrying about the honor grind.
---
Things that drop cloth often also run when getting low and drag in extra mobs.
---
So it's a bit of a mixed bag.  But on my rogue (first 60) leveling on humanoids was obvious with my "PickShot" macro and auto-loot turned on to extra crap while grinding.
---
Stop embarassing yourself you pathetic child. Google what sarcasm means before you comment on it next time.
---
Yeah. Rogues a dime a dozen. Rogues that avoid cleave, give potions to tank/healer, train lockpock, and don’t ask for 5 minutes? Those are a bit rarer.
---
It's not that it was that incredibly hard to get at the time. The title is just proof you were playing back then. Most people playing now joined much later and never had a chance to get it.
---
Also shows you've been around long enough to maybe know what you're doing.
---
I assume you have never played vanilla... Leveling for experienced players is right at 100 hours to 60. Less experienced may take 200 hours. Probably 70% of the population would not even be 60 yet...maybe even nore.
---
Found the beta male. But seriously, stop blowing things out of proportion.... It will be fine.
---
The best part of Classic is we can play it however we want. If I want to rush 60 it is my own choice. No one is saying you should no life. This community is built on the premise of playing a nostalgic game however the hell you want. Get your bullshit out of here.
---
Then go play retail
---
Isn’t it crazy how often people say things like they know what they are talking about? Like you say hemo is way better than daggers as a fresh 60.
---
This sub is not representative of the WoW population, though. Don’t worry!
---
Jewel Crafting and Inscription are the only ones that weren’t in Vanilla. Jewel Crafting was added in BC and Inscription in Wrath.
---
This is a great idea!
---
There was also a R15 in the beta: City defender
---
That would be pretty sweet, even if it was simply that you couldn't use your flying mounts while PvP flagged or something, or a cooldown after dismounting from a flying mount until you can engage in PvP combat.
---
Blackrock Mountain is going to be lit. Almost makes me want to roll a NE priest just to MC people into the lava. Almost.
---
&gt; If they added them all at launch then the gear would be overpowered for the content at the time. 
---
Meanwhile Updated 1.11 Rank gear in the game
---
Classic wow confirmed gateway to the alt right.
---
Yeah it will be funny seeing guilds tear themselves apart with infighting for the chance at a mount we've all seen for ages.
---
Yeah most of the QoL features were nice but killed world pvp. People just spam level then never leave town as you can just queue and get teleported to the instance. Then it was “oh man I’m getting ganked, better look for a pve crossrealm group”.  Now pvp servers are gone and you gotta flag. Faction changes fucked up servers as people just started changing to what streamers said were op racials which left servers 90% one sided. 
---
Truth be told I’d still like the mount tab so it’s not taking up all my bank slots.
---
Ummmm no, the group in question immediately killed three civilians the second he loaded. That’s not how DK’s were intended to work.
---
&gt; To be fair, September IS summer.
---
Technically, yes, but when media is set to release in "summer", they typically mean June/July/August.
---
I think you've been paying too much attention to some of the more "competitive* type posts being made on here. They represent a very small group on an even smaller subsection of the entirety of people who will be playing classic WoW. Discussions on this subreddit are not going to dictate the atmosphere of the entire community.
---
Even folks on PvE servers will be flagging up - but at least you can *choose* not to flag. Especially while leveling. 
---
As a PvE server guy myself, I'm interesting to see how many folks camp Flight Masters &amp; core attunement quest givers during Phase 1 (no DHKs). It'll be a blast, and I'm sure I'll be flagged 80% of the time. But it's that other 20% that helps me keep my sanity.
---
The regular classic wow discord has only one channel for recruitment which is annoying to no end. They're too lazy to even separate EU NA Oc
---
I got some pitchforks left over from the last time someone suggested changing shit on here:  
---
——E  
---
Let’s get him boys!
---
&gt; you only have yourselves to blame with how seriously you take video gaming
---
I think you're the one who's taking gaming a little too seriously if you feel the need to vent off your frustration about other people on public forums
---
Even with a 2Hander you play fury in PvE, not arms, so weapon specs are irrelevant.
---
In pvp your weapon skill is normalised so you do not benefit from racials.
---
Realistically both in PvE and PvP you'd just use the best weapon available to you. UTB is a 2H sword and you'll see Orcs rocking it anyway.
---
&gt; I dont believe well get a beta or stress test.
---
Why not? Literally every other Blizzard game has had beta and/or stress tests.
---
It may be a Dave Chappelle reference.
---
I don't even world pvp that much... but pve servers are for casuals and plebs. We all know it's true.
---
It’s everywhere on this sub. Constantly that we’re the “elite” etc. I mean, I was running around in scrub gear with the most noobish pala you’ve ever seen in vanilla. Does that make me the 1%? 😂
---
It's already in the game, though it's only like 30 seconds.
---
You just get sheeped/CCd for the duration of it and then get instantly nuked by 5 people once it wears off.
---
Skinning=beast; else humanoid
---
Some what counteracted by economy inflation, but your point is definitely valid.
---
If you're strictly picking for rotation and numbers, warrior.
---
It takes zero effort to right click someone’s name and press Ignore.  Classic WoW is a social game - people are going to talk, and you aren’t going to like all of it.  So you ignore them.  You don’t beg for the hall monitor to keep your safe space unoffensive.
---
The fact that you think it’s a “significant burden” maybe suggests you should stick to retail, where you don’t have to talk to anyone.  Classic is a high effort game full of “significant burdens” and many of them involve talking to rude strangers on the internet.
---
Sorry about your feelings. (I’m not)
---
Not possible to get 14 before bwl lol
---
Be the rogue that uses distract to stop the patrol from aggroing right away when the tank mis-times a pull.
---
According to other people on this subreddit it is easier to run then the 1.12 client.
---
It's either a gnome who got exalted with stormwind and is using an orb of deception or it's a garbage pserver like kronos where they allowed you to buy cross faction mounts with real money.

Honestly people powergamed back then to, there just wasn't as much knowledge and you wanting people to pretend the knowledge isn't out there changes nothing about the knowledge being out there. The game will have its own set of goodness this time around. I think world pvp now will absolutely dwarf the old videos we have seen, I hope blizzard's server crew is ready because I can easily see a 200 v 230.
---
Fuck that "no changes" bullshit, I want Hand of Reckoning on my Paladin !
---
no it's not. Mobs vary by 10 levels. from what I remember. But that's the beauty of classic. It was not safe. You always had to be on your guard.
---
Danes lul
---
Rofl r14 required to raid. What?!
---
For sure, I would definitely flag up once in a while if I was on a PvE, but as you say, I would also have the option not to in order to preserve my sanity. I'll just have to take this head-on in the name of friendship, but I won't like it.
---
 It's either a gnome who got exalted with stormwind and is using an orb of deception or it's a garbage pserver (can't name, but starts with a K) where they allowed you to buy cross faction mounts with real money.
---
Also a feral doesn't dilute the warrior's gear which is another huge benefit.
---
The memory that stands out the most, the first thing to come to mind every time I think of vanilla WoW, is raiding Lakeshire with my guild when I was like level 30. The battleground patch was going live in a week or two and all the doomsayers were out in full force enjoying wPvP before BGs "killed it".
---
BGs didn't kill it, but they did take a sizable bite out of it. :(
---
There is one nightmare scenario. Burst-death. 
---
We are all very enthusiastic on here but we will not be enough to support the entire game. If people do not stick with it and give up on it for new games then it will all be for naught. Tightly packed guilds will kill KT, I'm sure, but outside that the game will be a ghost town.
---
Or, don’t be the Rogue that says “Nobody uses Sap.” Please, if we don’t have a Mage, you’re our CC.
---
And that's why there better healers, because ret literally brings nothing unique
---
&gt; Say it with me everyone. #no cha he’s
---
uhh, ok...
---
no cha he's?..
---
Probably that garbage pserver (starts with a K) that let you buy cross faction mounts for real money.
---
Oh wow he mad.
---
No it takes some minimal effort to ignore one troll.  But it takes a lot more effort to ignore every troll.  And each person who doesn't want childish garbage every time they play wow has to ignore multiple people.
---
Do you really not understand that a small thing multiplied many times becomes not a small thing?
---
I just wish people would start finding \*solutions\* on how to make the game harder rather than easier.
---
You don't lose anything when you die in WoW.   Who cares, live a little !
---
That is understandable and I agree, but the comment said R14, not the blue set.
---
Definitely. Its NOT balanced.. and yes that is OKAY. That's what makes it an RPG.
---
You are correct about spreading the info. People who dont know what they are missing might hate themselves 6 months down the line when they start wondering why they're always a few % behind on the damage meters. Sure most people wont care, but sometimes your race can be like having an extra 13th item slot beyond all your guild mates. If someone doesn't care about race at all then they also shouldnt care about loot at all, because when you are min maxing and looking for those small 1 item upgrades, your race itself is oftentimes worth more than that upgrade you're chasing.
---
It went into the “ranged slot” for paladins. Gave stats but didn’t do anything else..
---
Thing is very very few people are going to have access to that pre bwl.   It’s not going to be anywhere near as big a deal as people think. 
---
Everyone thinks that they will make it that high or they will be the next rank 14.  Very very very few people are going to reach that level.

Your opinion is retarded (and bad) and considering you haven't played Vanilla since 2005, it's hard to take you seriously when you can't even consider a differing opinion. The game is literally not the same as it was, and will not be the same as it was. Legion engine, 1.12 talents from the get go, etc. this alone makes your argument invalid. It'll never be Vanilla from 04/05, so you should probably get that out of your head now.
---
Honestly, who else would even take Sulfuras? It's a PvP weapon regardless, so it's not like anyone else would have priority. 
---
Your Fury Warriors should be stealing Rogue weapons, not eyeing Pally drops.
---
I'm sorry for enjoying a different aspect of the game
---
You guys don't understand, it isn't like 2005 anymore. The game is different. Plenty of casuals play on PvP servers, look at all of the private servers. They're ALL PvP cause there is so little interest in PvE servers. Even on PvP servers, casuals are 90% of the playerbase at least.

Warriors got Asscandy though

I remember when they announced WoW, I kinda rolled my eyes.

"How are they going to turn WarCraft into an MMORPG?"

---
Have to disagree. The only solution that was available in vanilla was rallying your faction to counter the group. It should remain the same.
---
Because your weekly decay is a percentage of your total RP while you can only gain a fixed amount. So it gets slower and slower even if you’re ranked first each week. 
---
You need 60k RP to hit rank 14. You lose 20% each week which means when you hit 50k you’re losing 10k while the maximum possible you can earn is 13k. When you hit 55k then you’re losing 11k a week and so on. 
---
Even if you can guarantee 1st (or top ~5 depending on how big the server is) every week it would take 13 weeks from 0 to 60k.
---
yeah sure, lets change something because some idiots are panicking.
---
If you’re a dps warrior, you’ll probably get declined to most dungeon parties, and you’ll be competing with a lot of classes for loot in raids. Honestly if you’re not planning to do much tanking, I’d say rogue is an easier choice.
---
I agree with another guy's comment--letting the PvP release plan dictate your race/class/faction is way overthinking it. Unless you are blatantly prioritizing min/maxing and actively competing to rank up, I don't see why this should seriously impact this choice.
---
&gt;plenty of post-Naxx options
---
I'm listening.
---
I'm glad we're getting the most no-changes possible experience for historical preservation. I would also be very interested in a separate set of servers with some tweaks for more long-term play.
---
Fun fact the older human models are actually still present in game with pirates and sailors. You can even MC them
---
It dealt extra damage. It was buffed.
---
In streamer guilds everything is streamer priority.
---
I'm pretty sure there will be more Warriors than Rogues, this time.
---
This is why I can’t get back into classic. I’ll ruin my life and won’t have my early 20s to bounce back into life from.
---
Goodbye hip flexor muscles 
---
Helloooo man titties
---
PVP servers think PVE servers are full of carebears.
---
PVE servers think PVP servers are full of sociopaths.
---
Neither is wrong.
---
Play what you want.
---
Trust me I agree with you, so I’m rolling on a PvP server. I don’t think any less of anyone who plays on a normal server though, and in a lot of ways the PvP interactions are “better” on a PvE server. I just happen to like getting ganked and ganking, so I’m rolling on a PvP server.
---
I don't see it as that big an issue. With current knowledge I expect Viscidus to be on farm much earlier than vanilla and will die much faster, especially with  **Elixir of Poison Resistance**  if it works on him. Gear won't accelerate you like it does with BWL T2 bonuses or the efficient stat allocation on T3.
---
You’re right. Should have used Lakeshire as an example instead.
---
The dk in TM was standing in the middle of everything and so he got killed a lot.  dks in cities are usually not out in the open though. Plus you can mc em sheep em.
---
It never made sense to me to compare it with real diseases. People wanted it to spread. Much like the Geddon bomb. 
---
The event has been needlessly dramatized, it was just a fun exploit that did some griefing
---
I was gonna go troll Shaman for berserk but I opted for fem Orc instead. That 25% stun resist is too good.
---
There's always a demand for good, reliable players
---
I've played a rogue on pserver and rarely had any issues with finding groups.
---
Take the initiative to create your own groups
---
Be social and make friends
---
Be a solid player
---
And most importantly, help others with their stuff and they will feel obliged to return the favor
---
The game is different because its been catered to carebears. Plenty of us are sick of it and have stopped playing or moved to other games. I'm looking forward to a rewind back to the fuck the casual mindset. IDGAF if they quit because they can't stand it. This isn't for them. With patches being rolled back nothing is different, old talents, old system, old playstyle of fuck casuals and single players. Get your group rushed to 60 and some quick dungeon grinds then off to camp everywhere.  
---
Are you under the impression I don't think huge camping raids are going to happen? That is what I'm waiting for, I already have a large group ready to go. We are dedicated campers that moved from wow to archeage where that game didn't give a single fuck about griefing. We have camped people for literal days for petty shit. We would have people standing where they logged taking shifts waiting for them to log back in. This is what I want.
---
I don’t get it. Why are people against the fact that challenging leveling conditions highlight the accomplishments of those who prevail? Isn’t that like... what classic is all about?
---
That's definitely a big part of vanilla. If you no-life it and get ahead you are rewarded for it with a sizable advantage over other players. What you choose to do with that advantage is totally up to you. This isn't a happy playtime no-child-left-behind type of game; players are not entitled to be on equal footing with their opponents.
---
srsly it wasnt that bad. calm down.
---
I’m going away for a week for work the 2nd week of July. I’ll probably miss launch but I wasn’t going to be on the bleeding edge of levelers anyways.
---
Yes but the major difference is that everyone and their grandmother has been complaining about the 4 phases, nobody has complained about the debuff slots.
---
Both are good in pvp. Priest does better early on, warlock does better after AQ. 
---
In pve only warlock is really viable because most guilds bring 0 shadow priests.
---
List of original variation epic mounts here: [https://www.wowhead.com/achievement=879/old-school-ride](https://www.wowhead.com/achievement=879/old-school-ride)
---
I'm probably going with a warrior at first but I'm an altoholic so I'm probably going to play most if not all the other classes, especially warlock, hunter, mage, rogue and shaman. Might do a druid eventually just for ganking redridge.

39, same
---
I played Classic every day from launch to BC launch.  I had probably six or eight people on my ignore list.
---
It wasn’t a problem then.  It probably won’t be a problem now.  Asking the end user who is offended to mute and move on is a much more reasonable thing than asking Blizzard to police speech heavily enough to keep everyone happy - which is completely impossible.  
---
Why take a blizzard employee who could be working on bugs or content and stick them in a monitoring role where they try to keep snowflakes like you from having to lift a finger, right click a name, and press the word Ignore once a month?
---
Inb4 “I’m not a snowflake” I think we both know you’d benefit from thicker skin.  I say this out of love.
---
So you've got a few fun alternatives, it all depends on how old the server is, and of course as always how your servers economy plays out. 
---
Grind grays, farm twink blues in old dungeons, mine/herbalism and make into raid consumables or other things people use consistently. There are also a few items that can sell for quite well like the 1 ring or dragon hatchlings if you spend time finding that person, not everyone is into buying gear and items that has a fun or cool look/name.
---
A few crafting professions have cd's that sell for well or the items sell for more when you craft them.
---
Alchemist transmutes arcane crystals into arcanite bars
---
Tailorers make mooncloth
---
Leatherworkers make cured rugged hide
---
First thing that came to mind was Esfand, and look who’s the top comment lol
---
I love playing w friends so I'd be totally cool with shared quest items... and maybe faster NPC's on escort quests.  But, since that's likely not in the cards, I'll level a rogue and just gank people and steal their mobs.
---
As someone who has determined they want to grind AV exalted and then never even look at a BG again, I really want to have multiple weeks of no PvP. Buuuut I guess I'll see
---
.&gt;RP player
---
.&gt;can't play on an RPPvP server because none will be available
---
I wanted to have a well dressed Night Elf kill me in Silithus ;_;
---
Now I have to choose between my Vanilla WoW identity (played Vanilla on RPPvP server, long time RPer) or the glory of constant open world PvP (PvP server).
---
Here's hoping Blizzard sees the light and releases at least one RPPvP server.
---
Make them a spell rotation macro, enable sticky targeting and give them a /follow button marked "Love Daddy"
---
there has to be a server options for girls.
---
This actually was a video from Vanilla. He (Cranius) uploaded the original video in 2005, this is the 2009 reupload. So OP posted this in the correct place. All of the recorded footage is from Vanilla.
---
I think a small number of people might level a farming class first but otherwise it shouldn't make a big difference.
---
Shadow priests melt faces in PvP. It’s a slight edge, but warlocks are very powerful too. 
---
That is true on the PVE side of things, typically one per raid if that. 
---
You need to ask yourself if you’re willing to respec holy if necessary. If not, warlock is your bet.
---
Mhm Mhm, Once again: The GM should not have done that.
---
I, among with other people, have been victims of ninja's in Vanilla WoW and we were told to "Suck it up" and just deal with it. It happened between players and should be handled like that.
---
So I don't see why he's a special case.
---
Every single person who ever uttered #nochanges
---
I dont want to gank people or get ganked. I take my time leveling and would hate to be camped. But it's the more fun and proper way to play. It's like trying to explain going to the dentist to a bird with a beak. You play on pve servers and think pvp is about ganking, whilst I don't possess the oratory abilities to explain to you why your wrong.
---
It's hard to know what to expect. If the game is popular, I reckon you'll see lots of new players.
---
I personally think the majority of active players will have no/low experience on pservers.
---
Every guild/raid will have a few folks going full turbo - bringing consumes, wbuffs &amp; extra trinkets/gear. But I'd expect the vast majority of folks to be similar to how they were back in the day.
---
And i'd bet ya 100G that dozens of PuGs disband over Lava Surgers in the first few months. :)
---
This subreddit is (to a large degree) PvP-server pserver folks. Kind of an echochamber at times - so it's hard to get a good image of what Classic will look like. I would assume that less than 15% of *active* Classic players will have hit 60 on a pserver and/or visited this subreddit.
---
You've discipline now at least? Initially I'll content myself with just eventually hitting 60 and getting pre-raid BiS.
---
&gt; When Vanilla was first released with Molten Core and Onyxia, those raids were legitimately difficult.
---
It will still be difficult for a vast majority of players.
---
The biggest difficulty of vanilla raiding is maintain a roster of 40 people that are capable of not standing in fire.
---
Also, a lot of people will still be leveling by the time phase 2 comes out.
---
Those who chose to rush things most likely know what they're getting into, don't worry about them, they've been doing it over and over for the past 15 years.
---
They run directly where you are facing when they reach the HP threshold for flee; aim them.
---
Finding a group is not a problem. Rogue is a top tier dps class and any raid leader will gladly take as many rogues and warriors as possible.
---
Gearing up is only a problem if you’re sword spec because there’s very few good swords in the game and you’ll be fighting over them with warriors and other rogues. If you go dagger spec then it’s not an issue because there’s plenty of good daggers and you’re usually the only dagger rogue in the raid.
---
I don't know, to be honest I was actually surprised by the reaction here. In all seriousness, I get ganked more than I gank others but if I wanna gank I will. It's part of the game and honestly it's that "fear" that makes the game fun in the first place (from both perspectives IMO). I enjoy that aspect but I'm also a really patient person. People need to calm their asses down and have fun with it! Or I'll gank your ass! 😂
---
This only really affects the more hardcore raiders doesn’t it? I don’t think most players are gonna push to grind day and night for the blue set just so they can have an easier go at MC. Even if they are, if someone is willing to put the time in, then who cares? It’s not like it will affect your own raiding?
---
Ion Hazzikostas said he won't be releasing any RPPvP servers at launch.
---
If you're an OG Vanilla RPPvP player, then you can't play on an RP server if you want to play open world PvP.
---
We have to pick between either playing on an RPPvE server, or a regular PvP server.
---
And no, /flagging on an RPPvE server is not the same as playing on an RP server.
---
Sad times. Being forced to choose between two passions because "you think you do [want an RPPvP server] but you don't."
---
Sometimes Blizzard is still baffling.
---
I'm really curious to see what the numbers show!  The plan probably won't affect what I end up playing, but I'd love to know if it will affect any overall trends towards faction/class.
---
It's THE most important topic.  A bunch of dead Vanilla servers 3 months in would be a disaster that would lead to further population casualties.
---
If, as a community, we can just lose the idea that Fear Ward is a deal breaker, I'd be happy. 
---
The stigma Alliance Priests got if they didn't roll Dwarf was ridiculous. Stance Dancing was very easy.
---
&gt; I think there will also be a ton of small scale pvp.
---
I think it's easy to romanticize and think this, but it shouldn't be what happens. When R12+ rewards are on the line, it doesn't behoove either party to roam for "small scale" fights. Efficiency is key. 
---
If you're doing that, another group is farming flight paths/dodging small scale pvp &amp; counter ganks/moving on to the next flight path or hotspot when resistance shows up. They're getting more honor per hour than you. 
---
You'd actually do best to collude with other-faction rankers to avoid each other and keep the lowbie blood flowing. I honestly think the system incentivizes it.
---
Start skinning while your pet kills the next beast. Sounds pretty clear cut to me.
---
As someone who could honestly not give two shits less about PvP, my goal is to rack up all the damn dishonorable kills I can get... as a holy pally. FOR THE ALLIANCE.
---
warlock is better for both
---
That's exactly how I feal! The threat of getting ganked makes the game feel a lot more real and fun - something I could definitely use while leveling. I might not immediately be happy, and I'll obviously fight back for all I can, but it really is fun to have other people around to fight. Getting corpse-camped feels like a loss, but it can't last forever and it makes the stakes even higher next time you're in a fight!
---
Priests historically got a lot of pressure to roll Dwarf. Being a Dwarf Priest was practically a free raid invite.
---
Cold blood hemo spec is the standard for early game PvP, if I recall.
---
Just pop cold blood and spend 5 combo points on an eviscerate.
---
Let's not give in to hyperbole so readily. There's been plenty of discussion about debuff slots since Blizzcon. Besides, I can't imagine changing the number of debuff slots to be anything but trivial for Blizzard on the technical side. So why not just do it?
---
Whether cross-realm BG queuing will be a thing when the first BG is released or if that comes later.
---
I expect them.  :)
---
No please.
---
Why not just let servers have their own identity?
---
Normal caveat of classic could be different from pserver, but I got rank 4 just off the AV rep grind and then maintained rank 3 just by playing AV on the bonus weekend a few times and just did gathering and joined up for the big push.
---
&gt; calling pvp servers a “private server thing” is straight up wrong. They were super popular.
---
Yeah I guess I should rephrase that. PVP servers were super popular but not as popular as PVE.
---
Yeah I totally get why people play PVP no doubt.
---
What kind of decisions/philosophies do you think were catered towards those hardcore players? I've always thought blizzard's general trend has been towards courting more casual playstyles and giving them more content and more ways to be part of the end game scene. Things like LFR, world quests, warfronts... I'd say that's all aimed at helping people outside of that 5% group.
---
Could be this one:
---
https://www.wowhead.com/item=15276/magus-long-staff
---
Which shares a model with a quest reward staff from hellfire (https://www.wowhead.com/item=15276/magus-long-staff).
---
If they do have the pre 1.4 mounts I'm making it my mission to get a frostsaber, I love that mount.
---
Did they send me word play,
---
When I asked for puns?
---
100% drop from stealth without the 90% chance talent int Subtlety... then you have 10% chance to need vanish every time.
---
People planning to play a priest or druid for pvp only might level a hunter first and farm up some gold while they wait for phase 2 then level their true main just in time for phase 3 with the first BG's. 
---
Ironically knowing the phases and release times = #changes because of this type of planning being possible now.
---
Yeah would be a nice addition.
---
I’m not gonna fix it be star I deserve the shame.
---
what is the swirly ball?
---
One thing that most PVP player don't get is that there's always one group that tries to ruin the experience for others.
---
I remember trying to level with my friends in STV during Vanilla and we kept on being camped by level ?? Alliance rogues/mages. No matter what time we came on, a combination of the same people were always there trying to screw us over.
---
I don't mind world PVP if it's SOMEWHAT fair, but 3-4 level ?? hunting down a trio of level 35~ guys is just pathetic.
---
I am mostly worried that I will accidentally pick 90% horde realm as alliance.
---
Replaced dozens with hundreds and hours with days and you got it.
---
Or you time your sap with the tanks ranged pull, just requires a little coordination
---
What I'd like to know is if they plan on starting new servers at Phase 1 on a regular basis for the folks who like the race aspect of claiming server firsts.  Then there's all the folks who for whatever reason just won't be around for the first wave, but would still like the experience.  As I see it, new servers should launch depending on demand from here until the sun goes cold.
---
Not that many people will get exalted with the factions prior to phase 3 as well.
---
Definitely more than r14's but yea.
---
"My leg!"
---
If a girl can cut it on a PvP server she's worthy of my time.
---
Update: still single 
---
:&gt;
---
Yes
---
Shame, that.
---
Still might be a decent way to get bonus honor.
---
&gt;~~12 hours~~
---
22 hours a day.
---
Also, rankers on the other faction have nearly no incentive to uproot, fly out, and run off small groups of the opposite faction. The Honor per hour they lose to go kill 1 flight path camping 3-man group isn't enough, when you know another group is getting more honor doing whatever is most efficient.
---
I have no idea what you said? In the last line about reddit being hardcore.. I have to laugh.
---
They make even hemo rogues do bat shit insane dps compared to a normal raid spec rogue.  Even more so on Horde where they can fully abuse WF.
---
This already exists. They can just cc for 30 sec or simply camp 30sec away from the FP towards the dungeon
---
Except Alliance priests. You will be dwarves and you will like it!
---
Hopes and prayers with the buffering of abilities.  It's good to try, but I guess you can kick a caster you fail to sap on pull.
---
Wow retail yes.
---
Overall people care about raiding a lot more than transmog. Not only is it a great way to spend time with online friends, but it gives some of the best looking armor sets.
---
No need to transmog when you're raiding with the set you would want to transmog anyway.
---
This bug would be one of the changes I could accept. Blackrock mountain carpeted in skeletons was epic.
---
Really looking forward to that first phase. When the gear level isnt insane the game feels so much better. Pvp is gonna be so much fun
---
Detect Traps
---
No, its definitely true. Maybe you didn't call PvE players carebears, but I did, and so did the people I played with back then. (It was meant in a friendly ribbing sort of way though, if people wanted to play PvE no one really cared).
---
Actually I think most top guilds will not take part in the server war effort. In the meantime they will farm as much "Scarab lord" they can.
---
I am thinking BWL comes out shortly after DM patch, within 4-6 weeks.
---
Maraudon is a dungeon, not a Raid.
---
Being the 10% on a 90/10 server can be a lot of fun on PvP servers too. I did it on purpose back in WotLK.
---
Was co-leader of guild and paladin with Hand of Rag. Can confirm.
---
Awesome thanks man!
---
I am amazed by the amount of pally support and horde druid.  Very unexpected
---
That’s STV, yep. Two pserv experiences brought countless horde hunters and rogues and locks camping me relentlessly for merely trying to quest and mind my own business
---
Make any incoming attack refresh honorless target, but any outgoing attack remove it. That way you have to be fully afk for the 30 seconds to provide honor
---
Yeah it's awesome, and the community it forms in the 10% is really cool. It definitely feels the closest to actually caring about fighting "For the Alliance" or "For the Horde".
---
What people seem to forget is that you can still flag for PvP on PvE servers. Meaning, there's nothing stopping some assholes on a PvE server from camping quest givers, flight paths, etc. I remember playing on a PvE server for a bit late into vanilla and the Crossroads were still raided regularly. Also, tricking people into flagging with a hunter or warlock pet/eye of kilrogg was fun.
---
Played horde in vanilla, tried alliance elsewhere. Horde has better traveling(zepplin close to a port hub and takes you across the continent), flight paths, leveling/questing, fewer aoe spots, overall better placement of friendly NPC's, sexier women (trolls and orc booty), and our feral druids look like demons not purple mountain lions.
---
My mage had his hearth to tanaris for aiding in that zone since it was a pvp hotspot, always just ported to UC and flew to blackrock when necessary.
---
&gt;If you're seriously expecting random people will defend a flight path against campers for more than 5 minutes you're delusional
---
There were guilds on pservers that did just that. I have no doubt that will also be a thing in Classic.
---
Also, you just need to put them behind, not camp them for 30 minutes. 2 or 3 deaths ruins their r14 grind for the day, and they have to play catch-up. That's worth it, and if it happens often enough (3-4 times a week), I think they'll at *least* move on to another FP.
---
You could always attack someone who is already flagged, when enough people do this youll find people running around flagged.
---
People really over stress how bad the ganking is. Teaming up with other people in the zone or calling in reinforcements to take down gankers  who outgear/outlevel you can be a lot of fun. If you've never leveled up on a PvP server you should give it a shot.
---
Gouge, evasion. Ask potential priest healer for a pre-bubble. Etc
---
My winter/summer is 1st of June - 31st of August. 
---
I’m sticking till that till they say otherwise
---
He's saying that most people who post on recruitment threads have min max profile since they are dedicated enough to recruit several months ahead of even launching the game.
---
When the game launches and a raid scene actually appears, the whole "OPTIMAL SPECS OR GTFO" crowd will be much smaller than a recruitment forum might lead you to believe.
---
Hope someone else can answer this for you man, as far as I’m aware they aren’t changing item stats. Someone might have the answer you’re looking for but
---
Meh. I remember leveling during those times in Vanilla. It wasn't that bad. If a guy or group was camping me I would just go do something else for 30 min or so and come back and usually they were gone. Finish my quest and GTFO. lol
---
Bitch it might be
---
Your life was never yours in the first place, you were born to roam the lands of Azeroth !!
---
Agree with you here, game play in classes just felt *so* good. Favourite expansion in that regard.
---
no
---
Maybe! Or just get really lucky. It's a longshot I know, I'll have to evaluate the idea after classic has been out for a while. Doesn't hurt to dream though.
---
Oh trust me plenty of people will participate in world pvp.  Epic mount or no, rewards or no.  Red is dead is a very popular past time on PvP servers.
---
It seems like what you mean is, content should be gated and slowed down so that your pace is the fastest acceptable pace. When did they ever cater to the 5% in classic, way late into the game? When I played my first character my goal from the start was lvl 60 with no smelling the roses, and I had no outside input on what to do or how to level.
---
Ya I fully agree. I started levelling a character from level 1 on retail and I love transmog. It’s a very fun part of the game for me because as I collect new gear I can update how my character looks. I would love this in wow classic, but it shouldn’t be shared with other characters, you shouldn’t be able to buy items with real money, and you should only be able to transmog into items your character has already worn and is soulbound to you. I feel like this would solve a lot of the transmog issues.
---
Not saying it won't take finagling, but it's not exactly perfect.
---
Don't forget having to worry about body pulling other adds in some locations, so it can't be used in places like SM Cath in the dense cathedral part, or in the last room of UBRS if I remember correctly.
---
Yeah that's what I was thinking would happen too. I figured the serious guilds would all have 2-3 scarab lords.
---
Troll spriest is S tier, right there with SL warlock, CB/Prep rogue, decked out arms warrior, and decked out mage 
---
Pros for priest : amazing 1v1, bad ass aesthetics, easy to be recognizable / stand out, reliable cc and very tanky
---
Cons : Mana issues, consumable reliant for pve content, low mobility and lack of chase mechanics vs running opponents (never catch a druid, shaman, rogue, or hunter if they are good and don't want to fight). Possible discrimination by plebs who think you can't pull your weight in raids. 
---
Pros for locks : incredible survivability, Mana efficiency, versatility (go SL tank 1v1/1v2 god or go SM ruin succ burst) utility via stones and portals, easy farming and chase if deep affliction w curse of exhaustion
---
Cons : massive upkeep w soulshards, less recognizable (tho fewer alliance locks) and very gear dependent unless SL (for pvp and pve raids - affliction is a beast at farm-tagging mobs in open world).
---
Someone loot the fucking Core Hound.
---
I have never been into PvP but I have always played on a PvP server because it feels like you're missing on some great content on PvE. No I don't like the feeling of being destroyed by any class when I'm so bad.. But gosh it feels good when u get honorable kill with just spamming your PvE rotation and randomly avoiding enemys crowdcontrol!!!
---
I’d wager the majority of the population will not be at endgame until 2-3 months into that.  Leaving 2-3 months of gearing and raid progression.  Personally feel like that is a good number.  Gives enough time to be able to level comfortably and have time to experience MC and Ony without feeling squeezed by BWL.
---
Who said phase 1 was 4-6 months? There is no timeline yet.
---
I like the ctra canceling your healing spells. early vanilla for sure.
---
Hi guys,
---
Might I please have some advice on how I should go about finding a raiding guild/what realms (EU/US/Pacific(?)) I should play on if my timezone is CET+6?
---
For Classic, I really want to find a raiding guild and I hope to play a Dwarf Holy Priest. What I'd like to know is just what advice you guys might have vis-a-vis whether to play US/EU/Pacific (?)? 
---
My general availability is roughly 6am-9amCET and 2:30pm-5:30pmCET weekdays and 4am-8pmCET at weekends. It's such a stupid schedule, I know, but it's a combination of a weird timezone and a working day in two parts (I work mornings and afternoons/evenings with my free time being 3-4 hours around midday).
---
I really don't want to miss out on raiding, at least once a week at weekends, but I just don't know how I can find a guild on that schedule and whether I ought be looking for West Coast/East Coast Americans, Europeans or Australians?
---
Spend ten minutes reading through it and let me know your thoughts. Cause thats not AT ALL how the recruitment forum reads. However there is the base line of success that everyone wants. Slapping a Hardcore Min/Max stigma on it isn't the right approach either.
---
Yeah this dude makes it seem like more actually viable specs are a bad thing. I'm sorry but vanilla raid class balance was fucking awful.  There is zero reason why half the specs cant even be brought into a raid.
---
Sorry dude but it was totally a thing lol
---
It's not so much that is aimed at people outside that 5% group (speed runners, that is) but it's that it tried to bring everyone into that type of content. The leveling process was just not as important as the big spectacle of end-game raids. And I get that; I do. Working with that many people at once is magical and they want everyone to do it. So few people did (and will) see KT that they re-vamped the raid for WotLK.
---
I don’t recall it being that bad.  Then again I don’t remember sleeping much.
---
Rerolled a toon named Data and stopped at the rank of Commander.  /flex
---
Remember that we start in 1.12, and hemo is viable from the start. So it's not that bad. I agree that he seems to be underestimating combo point generation for the traditional cb/prep daggers build.
---
I mean they haven’t.... but at this point it’s fairly safe to say that they plan on having vanilla like numbers post launch right?
---
I understand that MC and Ony may be easier with modern knowledge but for many vanilla players life now is much busier — having a big window of time accounts for job, family, etc
---
You're assuming OP is going to play Alliance.
---
If OP is horde, there will be no competition for swords with warriors because warriors will wield axes.
---

---
Sure, Humans get sword spec, which really helps, so be human. Combats sword is great in pve, and frankly has it's advantages in pvp. You lose a lot of great utility, but you do deal a lot of reliable damage. Also Adrenaline rush lets you chew through things you might not normally be able to. Hemo builds are also fine in 1.12, and you get the savory taste of CB/prep.
---
If you’re good with time management you can hit 60 in the first 7 days and grind for mc the next 7.
---
Nobody is talking about snowflakes and feelings here except you.  For the most part, in-game trolls don't offend people, they are a nuisance, which is their intent.
---
Blizzard GMs and CMs are not developers who could be coding if not for their community monitoring duties.  Were you joking on this point?
---
Since you want to bring personal experience into this, I played retail from vanilla to legion and nobody I associated with (hundreds of players) was muted, banned or reprimanded for in-game conduct to my knowledge.  Clearly behavior worthy of disciplinary action is rare.  Yet in my private server experience, racist/homophobic/etc trolling and responses from ~50 people (out of 10k+) dominated world chat.
---
I completely understand Blizzard wanting to avoid such a scenario.
---
I’m rolling rogue, but I intend to make a guild with friends we currently have 19 of us gearing up for classic and only 2 of us are rogues. 
---
I think you’ll find groups it’s raids like some others have said where you’ll have a lot of competition on rolls. But so will every class to an extent so play what you want man you’ll enjoy it and play more resulting in more rolls and more gear.
---
Where's your enthusiasm!?
---
#NO CHA HE'S! 
---
FOR THE HOR E!
---
There is a 20 or 30 second no honour buff you get on landing. Or was that something private servers included to address the issue?
---
This is what I'll be doing. Warlock (Alch/Herb), Mage (Tailor/Ench), Priest (Skin/Min) and my warrior (Min/BS).
---
I’m honestly having big trouble deciding, all of the classes seem cool to play.
---
I was thinking of a troll Shaman but I never healed in classic and I’m not sure how Shaman at 60 is. I’m interested in it but I don’t want to get myself stuck in something I won’t enjoy since 60 takes dedication.
---
If they care about minor details like delaying 1.10 tems and dungeons to preserve autheticity,  pretty sure we will get 8 slots at the start.
---
why addition? those are the og vanilla mounts, not having them would be a major #change
---
humans have mace and sword skill but yeah generally most arent gonna use hand of rag in pve.
---
I’d say Priests (all specs, but mainly shadow) and warlocks are two of the strongest classes in pvp and 1v1s
---
Or taking your sweet time getting to 60. Not everyone is in the race.
---
This is true
---
Ruining the spirit of classic.
---
Oh i have no idea I haven't played on private servers, but even with the no honor buff I still think gankers/pvpers will still kill you just because they can. Considering in modern WoW max lvls kill lvling players all the time even though they aren't worth a thing to them.
---
You can’t go into Classic expecting every spec to be good at everything. Leave that cancerous retail mentality in retail. Ret may not top dps charts but had some of the best oh shit buttons in the game, including an ability that could save entire raids from wipes. Just remember, you’re not choosing a spec to play. You’re choosing a class.  And ret was pretty good in PvP.
---
I still have nightmares about this Dwarf Holy Priest on an epic mount that kept ganking my leveling Warrior in Winterspring. He would SWP me as I rode along on my 60% lodo, mount up, catch me and drop another SWP, etc, until I was dead. There was no escape and I had no prayer of killing him.
---
You mean the Goon Squad, right?
---
To this day, I will never forget the satisfaction of killing a Goon... especially Alliance Goons.
---
I don't mean Vanilla vs. Retail, I mean Vanilla now to Vanilla 14 years ago. The game is different, and Blizzard 100% will not let you camp people for days on end, sorry to break it to you. Doesn't even sound fun, sounds like you're looking for a powertrip in a video game online.
---
Everything is 1.12, nothing will be like it was back then. The meta of Vanilla has changed a lot, even in just the past couple of years of private server gaming.
---
I don't see how making wpvp a bit more fair in a very specific situation is ruining the spirit of classic.
---
It’s also distance based. If you’re too far away you won’t get credit.
---
If you're not taking PI and buffing your mage/lock/sham in PvP with it you are trolling
---
Play on a PVE server.
---
Naw, pve server for the win.
---
Fair enough — change “most” to “many” and I stand by the rest. I just want any players who never got to experience World PvP in Vanilla to understand that it it can be both the best and the worst, but it adds a lot of social value to a social game. It’s worth giving a try!
---
How does not giving honor effect fairness?  You still die and the tiny amount of honor has almost no value.
---
My opinion on this.    Thank them first.
---
I see you plan on ganking lower lvls at flight paths?
---
Ok thanks. Been a long time
---
Let's face it, we are going to get a ton of tourists. People are going to give up before level 20.
---
#nochanges
---
fuck, right in the feels
---
Perhaps not a simple question, but I'll try anyway.
---
Does anyone know of a list of "fair" dkp item values for the first tier of items from MC+Onyxia?
---
If you're planning on being a Troll, you may want to lean more towards the beasts.  [Beast Slaying's](https://classicdb.ch/?spell=20557) \+5% damage isn't a ton, but it'll definitely speed up the grind, letting you get to the better-paying higher levels sooner.
---
Would rather not,  while I know there are a few things like this already. I’d rather not flood the game with pop culture references.  Was honestly the worst part about the zone revamp.  Felt like the game didn’t take itself seriously anymore. 
---
TLDR no changes
---
You will either have to get lucky for loot or prove you are a reliable asset to a raid team, earning the loot priority.
---
I'm very much part of the no changes, but I feel this change is so insignificant that it really shouldn't matter. Plus it would push for WORLD pvp. Not flight path PVP.
---
Personally, I’m extremely excited for it. I joined Vanilla a bit late, and then rerolled servers after I got my first hunter to mid 40s, so I’m looking forward to being able to savor a good part of the game where PvP will exist simply for the sport of it. All of us clamoring for older versions of AV will hopefully get to re-experience it south of the real Alterac.
---
The beauty of wow was that you made it what you wanted.
---
If it takes 5 months for WSG to be released playing a druid sounds quite a bit less fun.
---
If it’s red it’s dead.  Lowbies get killed once then left alone.  Once they are green then they are fair game whenever.
---
No, but I don't see a problem with it.  Don't roll on a PVP server if you don't want PVP to happen to you.
---
Problem is many people don't stop at once from my experiences in pvp servers in WoW.
---
I paid a shard for it, actually used it to kill the Ungoro demon on the Hunter quest.  Now, I remember doing it, no fucking clue as to my reasoning...
---
&lt;Undaunted&gt; - Horde |NA-PVP| semi-hardcore
---
Undaunted is recruiting members prior to the release of classic wow. Welcoming all players that are experienced or new with determination to progress at a steady rate and dedication on making the guild a better experience overall. We want to have a strong core of members when the game launches.
---
This guild will be semi-hardcore, Horde, and with a laid back demeanor but still seeking to progress with a goal to leave no one behind for those that show up on raid times, etc. Ideally a strong core roster of experienced players would be preferred to help out around the guild and bring everyone up to speed. We want a good sense of community within this guild so don’t be afraid to speak up and talk to others, in the end remember to just have fun with the game as well.
---
We will be doing PVE and PVP content with raids times being listed below but we do enjoy world pvp when we get the chance, perhaps even forming BG groups later on when they get introduced. When raiding starts we will be doing 3 nights a week. We are currently recruiting all classes, just play what you feel like. 
---
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday - 7:30 - 10:30 est
---
We currently have a discord channel. We have tabs for class/dungeon guide talk to help people out not familiar with classic wow and you can usually find me in general voice chat. Feel free to add me on discord or bnet for more info on joining it.
---
Blizzard wants to play their cards right. If the content dries up a bit, that leaves the door open for some leakage from Classic players into retail.
---
To piggy back what everyone else is effectively saying, this is going to take a very small few a very large amount of time to complete. If they do complete the T14 grind then it will be around the time of ZG anyways at the LEAST. 
---
How often did you run into the full T3  Nerubian Slavemakers in Vanilla? Maybe once, twice a year?
---
How is this possibly going to affect you other than gear envy? You’ll find them. Die and move on with your day.
---
Good thing winter is coming, next weekend
---
It's not that I don't want to be pvpd, I plan on playing a character on a pvp server and will prbly be my secondary character so if its a problem at a certain time ill just hop on my main, but it should be WORLD pvp, not flight path pvp. Find me killing a zevra in the barrens, not gank me and stun me and destroy me before I even know whats happening.
---
Cha broski!
---
&gt;there is no point in playing this you dont go hardcore, min/max, level rush etc. 
---
&gt;"Only my playstyle is the correct one!"
---
The irony
---
rip shadow?
---
I want them to keep the servers vanilla, with an option to move forward. I personally have no desire to play other xpacs. I just want a vanilla server.
---
Yeah, the raise and position I would have, I wouldn't be able to take that kind of time off this potentially close to the date.
---
Itll be there for me ;)
---
Think they'll do a television commercial???
---
Swede here. We started out on Dunemaul back in the days with Aggro Union, then we moved to Frostmane where a lot of scandinavian ppl played. We will most likely be 10-30 players coming back to Classic.
---
I'm having trouble agreeing with that one. The expanse is too open, there's a river/body of water, and there are trees, all of which Thousand Needles has none of!
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMGsAVoofhtcc
---
This PvP build works for raids, you're not losing much out of the Holy tree to have PvP talents in the Disc tree
---
I can echo this sentiment.
---
A lot of people coming back are not going to be able to even give 10 hours a week to this game. It'll take more than 6 months to get a sizable level cap population I'd wager.
---
Tauren warrior first. Can’t wait to go through Mulgore.
---
30 in one month ...damn!
---
While I agree with you on some fronts, what I think you are missing is that Blizzard's retail servers won't be like private servers in that private servers have a higher concentration of dedicated players. 
---
Think about it: You play on a private server with a population of 3k. There's maybe another handful of private servers with around 2.5 - 5k+ as well, but the skill level of the guys on those servers is going to be higher than the ones on Blizzard's 100 (or whatever) servers per region with 2.5K population? The reason is that the dedicated grief gankers will not all be on *one* server, but dozens and dozens. 
---
I think the population on each server will consist of a broader base of players than on privates.
---
Everything they've done is just to make the game closer and closer to vanilla. Highly doubt they will change the population cap, which is a very substantial change to the core experience.
---
When are these posts going to stop? No one cares how hard you can romanticize being bad at the game.
---
The tourist-cap with sharding will probably be closer to like 8-10k, though I think most people are wondering about the post-sharding cap.
---
How do we know Blizzard won't balance out the classes and their respective trees more appropriately this time around?
---
Should pally’s actually try to get Sulfuras, Esfand? I’m thinking about going for it but not sure it’s worth it. Yp
---
Oh, hell yeah.
---
I see where you're coming from, but I'd rather not make them unflagged at landing. In retail wow, there's no sense of danger in the world. Your character is bigger than anything you run into and flying mounts, sharding, war mode, and other 'qol' abilities mean you can always fight on your terms in pvp. Dismounting is a minor aspect but it plays into a larger mentality that you are not safe. You can, and will, die and it very often won't be in your control. Even if you dislike it and you don't gank, it is exciting coming into land and seeing in world defense that the place you're going to is under attack. Knowing you're 'coming in hot' adds flavor to the world. I think taking that away from the game would make it less rewarding experience.
---
two blue post in the same week... you heard it here first
---
I don't think ANYBODY not even the devs want sharding to be a permanent part of Classic. 
---
However the realist in me knows that the classification of "starting zones" is probably going to be very broad. The massive crowd of people doesn't disappear at the edges of Durotar. It will probably include all starting zones and then all major early leveling zones, such as Barrens, Westfall, etc...
---
As much as i find this behavior shamefully pitiful spineless, it is unfortunately contradictory to nochanges (which is probably more healthy for the re-launch of the game).
---
That’s just my philosophy on it.  Best solution to counter this is for people to call it out in zone or guild chat.  Then you get people to show up and fight them off and create wpvp content.
---
Lmao at you thinking any item ninja compares to out right griefing a rank 14 lol
---
Items are all 1.12, the only difference is that they will be time-gated behind their appropriate release phase.
---
If you grind the right beasts in your mid 30s, you will have plenty of gold. Dont train in skill ranks you dont use.
---
Then don't take flight paths or only take the safe ones
---
play druid or rogue and stay in stealth 24/7.
---
do a 360 degree sweep of at least 200yd around your questing area.  
---
kill 1 quest mob.  
---
restealth and repeat.
---
Depending on race, warriors can use R14 until literally Kel'Thuzad. There is debatable sidegrade stuff along the way, but if you have R14 and someone else doesn't, better for the guild for them to go to someone else.
---
Yeah would be ~~a~~ nice ~~addition~~.
---
Happy?
---
I would rather have classic launch a week early if it meant not getting these added in.
---
Unless its for an 8/8 bonus or something, I believe hunters will never unequip R13 gloves, they are BiS into TBC afaik.
---
There is a cave with a quest node in some alliance zone (wetlands maybe?) that you can mine for skill ups, and completely skip the tin grind. The cave is small has maybe 10 nodes with a respawn timer of just a couple minutes, so you can go from like copper to iron in just 30 mins or so.
---
Honestly, im mostly talking about lvl 60s farming lowbies. And while if I was say lvl 50 or something and got killed by a lvl 60 once I wouldn't care. But theres ALWAYS those people who kill you over and over even if you aren't worth anything, at that point it's just being toxic. Course im going to be told not to play on pvp servers then, but it's easy for the people doing the killing to say that.
---
Maybe in private servers. Back in actual vanilla NOBODY was a fury warrior for most of vanilla
---
People aren't talking about killing the actual flight masters, just players as they land (often times AFK for a long flight)
---
- realm lists 
---
- can u make a horde and ally char on a pvp realm? 
---
- population cap
---
- extent of progressive itemisation
---
- the extent to which bnet will be integrated (e.g. can u add enemy faction by right clicking their portrait? if u have a player of the enemy faction added to real ID can u see where they are and message them on the friends list?)
---
- will they have 8 debuff slots at the start, or 16 the whole time? 
---
- how will they deal with AQ opening, will they keep the same war effort mats?
---
- dynamic spawns or sharding on launch? or none?
---
- will they change spawn timers on key materials (black lotus, etc)?
---
- will right click reporting be just how it is in retail?
---
- release date
---
The lack of progressive itemization in PvP gear is a serious change.  As we all know, the temptation to make a few "small changes" can lead to serious problems.  In this case the change is from gating some gear while failing to gate other gear through progressive itemization.  Of course PvPers are being tempted by these wonderful rewards to abandon loyalty to "No Changes" and ignore the harm that mismatched PvP and PvE rewards can bring to the community and game.
---
I first heard of this change on a fun Youtube PvPer's discord and his intemperate responses made me quiet suspicious of the gear.  "God mode activated." "The items are gonna be SO GOOD during BWL and ZG" "Ready to be a raid boss in r14 gear vs BWL gear kiddos"  A temperate approach will see the lack of consideration for the classic community and perhaps even hopes for revenge.  We need a more considered response designed to build the community.  It may also help for PvPers to realize that hardcore raiding groups might prioritize ranking over BWL not for PvP but rather for PvE.  More competition means less chance at the gear for PvPers since the ranking opportunities are limited.
---
Blizzard has listened before and we can help them now.  They need to see how this PvP gear outshines BWL and ZG gear for each class.  They need to see how this is a significant choice for change.  And finally they need to be reminded that building the community around the common goal of no changes will benefit them with success.
---
Because there's no reason not to implement it on launch.  I'm rolling on a pvp server and I want to get credit for the kills I get whilst leveling up!
---
i remember reading before wow and alpha came out when i was in high school 2003 that there were no plans to have any sort of magic items and powerful gear. that perhaps there would be one epic item per server type deal. in a nutshell, that everyone uses grey armor. the game would be slower and much more epic in scale than it was instead of just dungeons and quests. thats why alpha looks like it does. it looks better in a lot of ways. a few unpolished enemies. but faces turned in alpha, more elaborate cities etc. if anything. vanilla wow is like the new xpaks of today that hold you hand and give you free shit compared to how alpha was intended.
---
They aren't putting in new talents, its all being reverted. I don't want current retail. I'm good with old vanilla patches. I have come to hate live over the years with them catering to casuals and just making it carebear. I welcome the hardcore back. 
---
Also private servers are aids, they aren't even vanilla. They cater to casuals as well. Every thing needs to be reverted.
---
Put it this way... at least we're getting phases at all, and not one big content dump upon release. There ya go.
---
Kel'Thuzad! I raided with him for a bit.
---
No thanks on dishonorable kills.
---
Ya, being heavily rewarded for putting in more time/effort is literally what I love most about classic. I'm going to be rampaging through those people for kicks. 
---
I was late to the party and got stomped on the way up the first time and had to work my way up through a few raiding guilds. Getting destroyed by people with better gear when I was leveling/first hit 60 is why put in all the time to get there.
---
No one participates in the honor grind before 60, but it would be nice to get credit for kills made on while leveling up.  There's no reason for them not to implement the honor system from the very beginning.
---
In the nicest way possible, fuck off.
---
Classic isn't even out yet and you're trying to turn it into retail. Please stop.
---
Can you please take a photo of the 3 of you like this when classic comes out?
---
Hey! Add me on discord Crimsoneagle#3839
---
Since it's a summer release. They could be nice and inform us early so we can plan our vacation time acordingly. Plz blizz
---
Definitely.  I can't wait to watch it play out no matter which way blizz decides to go on this.  I'll be leveling solo anyway so it won't have much of an effect on me personally until end game.  Hopefully by then we all have a pretty good idea where things are going.
---
&gt; Its NOT balanced.. and yes that is OKAY. That's what makes it an RPG.
---
Gospel truth right here. A couple of my favorite tabletop RPGs were made by FASA back when they were still a thing. Mechanically speaking, most of their games were a hot mess, and that's putting it gently, but they were also full to bursting with excellent world building and all the flavor you could ask for.
---
Which isn't to say trying to achieve some level of balance is necessarily a bad thing, but, where RPGs are concerned, if I have to choose between flavor or smooth mechanics?
---
I'll choose flavor every time.
---
I played as ret back in the day when you weren’t suppose to play ret. I don’t think I need to relive that experience. It was wonderful btw but very tough overall. 
---
I think I’ll be playing a desired class/spec this time.
---
Not anymore, fury warriors just wear leather and the stats are better understood. Back in the day, everyone was arms cuz fury spec was ass till it got reworked. Hell people didn't start realizing in mass how good fury was till Nax from what I remember.
---
Thanks goodness for Dishonorable Kills
---
Yeah. The pop culture references were more subtle in classic. Shop names and whatnot that you only saw if you were exploring and paying attention. Not shoved in your face.
---
Just keep a whiteboard of tally marks.
---
Shadowmeld + Mind Control would like to have a word with you. Preferably on the Thandol Span or the chain in BRM.
---
It deoends on if they kept the model for it. If they have to redesign the model and it would delay classic launch at all, then no. If it's as easy as flipping a switch, then sure.
---
This! Its a community game! Ill be helping fight!
---
I hope phase 2 isnt at same time as casuals burning out. Feel that might multiply the leaving from all the unfair pvp fights.
---
And Archaeology.
---
Don't forget to tell it how much you dislike that it never does anything around the house.
---
Play it casually. Do your Uni. Don't be stupid as me and do school again with 28. Yea I plan to play classic but school is my top priority. That is why I sacrifice sex and social life. Not that I had one but still.
---
We both are good.
---
So people are worried about losing time to flight path camping.. And your suggestion is that they run everywhere instead?
---
I don't think this is a real issue since there are going to be pve servers for this reason.
---
Yeah they're trying to recreate the magical time when there was honor and no battlegrounds so everyone slaughtered each other at SS/TM.
---
Do you have a source for this?
---
hah, we gave it to a druid aswell...
---
Well guess I'll see you in 3 years when you have 4 geared 60s then.
---
Hell yea. Can't wait to level up in STV in peace.
---
I am 39, I spent All of Vanilla and BC playing SC so I missed all this.
---
I cant wait.
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/KnottyPluckyTigerSSSsss
---
Level in zones where the opisite faction quests are very few and there is absolutely no point to a certain high level to go there unless he specifically is going there to gank.
---
Why's this set at 4 hours? My god..
---
this is the answer.
---
The no honor debuff existed in vanilla. I don't know if ps also used it. That seems like an easy solution or am I missing something?
---
There will be a lot of lvl 60s before I reach that lvl, especailly since my pvp character will be my secondary character, so high lvls ganking flight paths in my situation will prbly be pretty prevalent.
---
True, but that's a rare drop too. Like honestly not sure I ever saw one drop.
---
Well shit. That sucks. The way he said it made it sound like its not set in stone yet. Hopefully they change their mind about it.
---
I'd like if they gave us that too, but in the form of TBC/Wrath servers alongside vanilla. That way we can play those specs in their more viable forms, experience content like Black Temple/ICC again, and probably WAY more realistic to expect from Blizz since they openly said they don't want to develop 2 MMOs
---
I played with a shaman with one before and it was sweet. I'd prefer it on a warrior but I'm not gonna pretend it wasn't good elsewhere too.
---
Well I certainly wasn’t aware that private servers have that problem, as I’ve never played on one.
---
Perhaps it’s because they aren’t paying for the game that they act more rudely?
---
I'm ok with the pvp rewards being based off of 1.12.  In the absolute worse case scenario they can change it up on future servers, assuming this is going to be a repeating process.
---
One can hope. You can imagine how devastating this can be for an RPPvP player, not being able to play at launch day, and having to decide if it's worth gambling and waiting, rerolling after months of investment, or waiting for a server to release that never gets released, putting you behind the curve.
---
Nah; you won't. But I'm not playing this game for you.
---
This is where I am in the conversation.  If anything the higher power will make the gear even more renowned than before, and that could be a good thing.
---
There's an item or two from every big rep... Classic isn't retail though. Battleground reps are the only real rep grinds that people go hard after. AV has some really nice items. There's a rep grind associated with ZG that's pretty important for end game enchants, and one that helps with naxx attunement, but that's about it unless you want another races mount.
---
Oh I don't plan on RPing like serious RP, just play on an RP PvP server, chat in character, play with more serious mature crowd.   
---
I'm not gonna MoonGuard Furry RP oh lord no
---
There will be tons of dps looking for dungeon groups all the time, why would anyone ever take a ret pally instead of of the dozens of players on classes that actually contribute?
---
Boo. Let us level in peace. If you watch a movie with double speed it's not the director's fault he movie only took you an hour. Level an alt or something.
---
Correct. Let player find the solution. Not the overlords..
---
I found this YouTube guide pretty good for an overview of available bags https://youtu.be/LAkhIArfOuk
---
Could always make an unofficial RP PVP server. You won't get the fancy moderation on names but word gets around. Like games that don't make official RP servers.
---
My wife is going back to her normal work schedule in november, where she works 2/3 of her time when I'm off. I'll just slow play until november and then go crazy town!
---
Do we know if they will be adjusting class balance in any regard?
---
It does help its coming out in the summer and not in the middle of a semester lol.
---
Ninja’ing some random item vs getting fucked over for r14 trying to help people, ye, thats the same thing.
---
It was clear from the beginning. If your reading comprehension is poor, that's on you.
---
So with this the content plan is more or less complete, right? Seems like the next logical announcement would be a release date!
---
I still don't know why people follow the astronomical calendar instead of the meteorological one. Didn't Blizzard mention that Spring started as well at the 1st of February?
---
They did keep the models. There are still a select few people riding around with the pre 1.4 unarmored mounts to this day in retail WoW.
---
damn i hadn't thought about it, but we really are getting the glory days back now that we're all pushing 30 lol.
---
Classic wow and All the halo's now on pc. what is a social life? lol
---
It's gonna be lit
---
I leveled Alliance on K3 and Horde on Northdale... I know pain...
---
My ivory raptor &lt;3
---
Just wait for the massive wall of texts that newbs will post on the forums about this being the worst experience ever and how they are so appreciative of BfA. LOL.
---
I leveled Alliance on the latest K server and Horde on the freshdale server... I know pain...
---
Because a decent pally is still nice to have, imho. 
---
Not everyone is a "sUpEr OpTiMaL sPeEd lEvElEr" or who cares about running dungeons as fast as humanly possible. I'd wager most people just don't fucking care
---
&gt;mate, people who grind for rank 14 play at minimum 15 hours A DAY. EVERY DAY
---
0.0
---
I...what? How do private servers cater to casuals? It's literally Vanilla. Blizzards current release is very close to how private servers do it, except for honor system without battlegrounds implemented. How does adding WSG in Phase 2 instead of 3 make it carebear at all?
---
What about the third picture? Was thatvoriginally the stormwind guard armor? Bcs it looks better than release armor imo.
---
It all comes down to preference though man. You can’t really deny that. PVE servers existing aren’t going to affect your experience in any way.
---
It's not bad till their "fair game" for Honor at 48+
---
Gankers stop after a while. The revolving door of rankers don't.
---
Not everyone is worried about time. A lot of us are just looking to level comfortably and aren't worried about racing to the finish.
---
Also, it is merely a suggestion. If you wanna get camped at a flight point, by all means, go use the flight paths. If you don't, then go for a run.
---
I'm just tired of people already trying to push changes to how flights and honor works because of this "issue." It's supposed to be a recreation of vanilla, not a "fixed" version.
---
As you said, there's PvE servers. If people don't like how PvP servers operate, then they have other options.
---
You play how you want. I don't care about raiding but at one point I would gladly do it.
---
I never reached 60
---
But the memories , friends and journey of being in Azeroth and having an adventure and creating my own head canon for my Toons will always be the reason I played deep into the night
---
Knowing I had to get up at 7 am for school but playing til 5 am just to get one more level or get that last quest finished and claim my reward for the weapon/armor I’ve been dying to get my hands on 
---
Posting up in a capital city and seeing the characters come and go and wondering where they’ve been or where they’re going 
---
Good times...
---
I've tried both and I hated PvE.  Originally I wanted to play on PvE too, but my friends convinced me to go PvP because it would be "way more war craft" I agreed and am glad I did.  
---
Doesn't mean it's for everyone though, I just like the unpredictable nature of PvP servers for this game.
---
So you're sating that when forming a group and missing 1dps, a ret pllu, frost mage and a fury warrior /w you, you are going to pick the ret pally?
---
This doesn't look good to me at all. I like the standard UI far better. There are some great custom UI but this is not 1 of them for me.
---
I take the first person to PM me man, I don't really care what class
---
Well tell that to the no changes crowd.
---
Sounds great. Doesn't work. I'm still not getting into a raid with my Enhancement Shaman and I still want my chance tot resist stuns for my warrior.
---
You don't possess those abilities because you cannot comprehend that you're wrong and have zero relevant arguments to bring to the table.
---
I was such a fucking noob in both vanilla and life at the time. 
---
I started playing really early on because my cousin happened to be one of the few country boy nerds and basically showed me the life of Counterstrike and eventually WoW.
---
We played on dial up.. which is hilarious to even think about nowadays. Then someone picks the damn phone up and you're screwed. 
---
Anyways... from the moment I started playing I wanted to be Tauren.... cuz duh I'm from Texas and they be strong/honorable.
---
I wanted to play Shaman,  but my cousin told me that it would be too hard and chose a hunter for me. 
---
I would watch him play and when he slept or worked I would play that hunter.  Got ALL the way up to 17!!... and moved away with my dad so I got my own account. 
---
I rolled Shaman on Stonemaul US by the name of Moto. 
---
My dad moved in my now step bro and sisters and I decided to teach my new bro about WoW
---
He rolled Druid, Walkingbear.
---
We were pretty terrible lol.... When you're younger you kind of just play the game from what you see. Concepts are still forming such as patience and saving.. and other things
---
For example... I felt restoration was somehow the talent tree I should use to level. I never questioned it once.... all the way to 60...
---
My (I don't stay step usually)brother and I quit numerous times on the path to 60... because it took forever
---
I remember begging that cousin from earlier to help us achieve our mount at level 40. I ended up getting it at 42 off a 40g loan that I'm pretty sure my cousin knew wasn't getting much back from. 
---
My brother cheeta'd until 44 when he EARNED his and he would brag about it all the time
---
Anyways.. we play on a pvp server and love to make some noise,  like most Texans do. 
---
The pairing of a feral druid and resto sham can literally last/run forever.
---
We happened to kill a 60 mage in the Hinterlands one evening... at the prime level of 45... 
---
We didn't know he was a 60 he was skulls since he was 10 levels higher,  but a 50+ came running through and couldn't fathom the fact that we killed the other dude.... even though it was pretty rough on the mage with interrupts and form swap.... that stuff we actually knew early on. 
---
PvP became what we loved. Pretty much right as I hit 60 WSG came out and that's exactly my type of BG. 
---
We ended up getting better and older, started doing instances and we found a guild by the name of The Foot.
---
They got us attuned for MC and the fresh BWL. I was so fucking pumped when we went into MC for the first time.. it's still my favorite of all time.... sorry ZG..
---
I raided as enhancement...... yes.. enhancement...
---
These min maxers have no idea what og was like. I could do a lot more damage than expected,  especially when we all sucked. Though I healed as well,  when needed :/. People just worked towards a goal it was fun
---
I got Earthshaker and Crown of Rag. I thought I was the fucking bees knees fellas.... 
---
I finally understood talents and optimization and that is what I loved. Talent trees and making them work the best for me.
---
I made the hybrid enhance/elemental spec with no help from online stuff.... which is important because Earthshaker has a stun proc... just long enough for a chain lightning or heal... also being Tauren.. warstomp after... sometimes stunlocking people.
---
Even thinking how badass I was I never saw high end game content. 
---
Sure,  I went to  AQ 20... but nothing crazy. Never even set foot in Naxx because there was only 1 guild doing it and they required your soul...
---
Played until Wrath.  Ended up streaming on arenajunkies for a bit and he and I would showcase Elemental shaman/ Feral druid 2v2. 
---
We had obviously been playing together so long that we were able to just destroy people since he was basically my best friend too...
---
He unfortunately passed away, so I don't have my buddy to share it with... but it still reminds me of the good time we spent together....
---
That's true. I didn't think of that. If it's an easy addition then I'm all for it.
---
So MC and Ony are out at launch. That means phase one is alotting time for a good amount of players to hit 60 and get almost full guilds worth of gear. 
---
I feel enough people will be 60 by phase 2 that lower levels won't be bothered nearly as often as some think.
---
&gt;Play whatever you want.
---
That's the problem. I don't know what I want. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Every time I pick a class and tell myself "alright, you're sticking with *[race class]*", a week will pass and I'll change my mind.
---
&gt; [**Shapeshifting**](http://web.archive.org/web/20040716002605/http://www.blizzard.com/wow/ScreenShot.aspx?ImageIndex=9&amp;Set=33) \- Druids can assume a variety of animal forms to aid them in both travel and combat. The Night Saber panther and **Storm Crow** are just two of the shapes Druids will be able to assume.   
---
&gt;There you have it classic flying! #nochanges
---
Ah, well, what I said still applies somewhat.
---
Gonna be hard for some players without the vanilla decursive
---
On the other hand on pservers introducing the blue gear made a metric fuckton of people participate in PvP, because the rewards were good.
---
It's only 2 pieces that are very good and there were similar items in the game before like Truestrike shoulders  or Devilsaur. 
---
I dont mind if introducing 2 very good items through PvP will upset the gear proression slightly if this means that 95% of people will rank to atleast rank8. This means you will have a constant flow of good players participate in ranking which is good for PvP server health.
---
Druids make fine tanks for leveling- even if they're not technically as good as warriors and probably won't be a raid pick (you'd likely switch to resto). Same with paladin.
---
It'll be a cold day in hell before I'm dumb enough to roll on a PVP server again. My Knight-Lieutenant, Sergent, and Corporal are enough for me. I hated what they did to PVP with a passion and still do.
---
&gt; (Which is also September, but unfortuantely doesn't line up as well for jobs/school)
---
Exactly this though.
---
It would be very un-ideal to launch in September from a financial/business point of view.
---
July and August are the two best months overall, in order to attract as many players as possible for launch.
---
I think everything depends on your server economy. What is going to be a need cloth or meat. You have to see, but I think both will be profitable.
---
 Taking a two week leave from school and work
---
I actually hope they remove dishonorable kills. I get that high lvl characters could then take over a low lvl town, so maybe put on a lvl restriction like gray (10 lvl difference or more) kills on NPCs would result in dishonorable kills.
---
Just don't rep grind for a raptor mount as Tauren just to find out there's a weight limit.
---
Yeah. Phase 1 can be 1 month for all we know.
---
You get CCd for the duration of it
---
I’d be surprised if they weren’t included up until phase 2, given everything else they’re putting effort into delivering.
---
This really is no the case. The R14 indeed are better, but not by a huge margin.
---
 [https://classicdb.ch/?item=19351](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19351)  [https://classicdb.ch/?item=19352](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19352)   [https://classicdb.ch/?item=19360](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19360) 
---
These are all weapons which are only slighly inferior to their R14 counterparts without you needing to invest thousands of hours of grinding within a 4months window.
---
Play what you want. Dont be entitled and think all guilds should invite you to raids or give you loot. /thread
---
Why? Druids are great in world pvp. Just because they aren't as good in premade AB or AV doesn't mean they can't be good in world pvp. They do amazing in the 1v1 scenario and they have stealth which is just about the best skill for world pvp.
---
Yeah they can but not when they're all in the same place. Just look what happend when streamers tried to organise big open pvp battles in bfa.
---
It was just bad and laggy as hell
---
Yeah its definitely not ideal but its better than nothing. And if all else fails you can just blind+ gouge after
---
\*clenches butthole\*
---
Nope it’s the super lame thing it is now. There goes my motivation to play classic. Loved those old school battles that went forever. It’s what hooked me into the game and I played endlessly. Once they needed the he’ll out of it I pulled away from the game. PvP lost the epic feel it used to have. The new needed ave is not classic and I’ll be passing on classic all together now. Sucks cause I was really pumped. Haven’t played wow in a long time now and was excited to play again.
---
I for one 100% respect that fact. All I'm saying is you'll have a harder time reaching the higher ranks, or reaching endgame if you dont optimize your character in the areas available to you. Engineering is one such area where it can make quite a profound difference.
---
Blizzard themselves have said that they don't want to go back and change things based on today's knowledge.
---
Apparently the game can’t register so many hits at once so it had to be done in 4 batches. I’m sure someone has the more technical explanation for this.
---
It will affect me personally. I considered grinding a leveling alt whenever. With this announcement I might back to back level my hunter or mage immediately after hitting 60 with my warrior.
---
Yeah I think and that is the only real problem that if you pick a good healthy pve server you will have more fun in pvp when you looking for "fair" fights or even organised group pvp.
---
Of course you can not kos everything you see as a stealth class and corpse camp someone but be honest don't to something you would not want that somebody do to you.
---
Yeah. Maybe go run to the place instead of taking a flight path (or take a flight path to a safe zone and run from there). Or maybe get your guild together and defend a flight point from the opposing faction. Or just res at the spirit healer and go get something to eat or take a shower.
---
Apparently the game couldn’t register so many hits at once so it had to be done in 4 batches. I’m sure someone has the more technical explanation for this.
---
How did your cat react?
---
I guess I can see why some people like PvE servers. When I started it was on a PvE before a friend showed me PvP and I never looked back.
---
I love everything about it! Including being camped.
---
I'm even more determined to level my warrior as the first character. You never know what happens in life. I personally dont want to be level 43, have to lay aside the game for 2 weeks and find myself right in Phase 2 with my main having to level right through the 48-60 mess that will be wPvP ganking.
---
Or tanks so they'll have a fun weapon for PvP and/or grinding.
---
Me
---
Is classic wow out? I played from beta to the first expansion and I would love to do that again
---
Honestly, adding some more balanced PvP rewards in that phase hat aren't 100% vanilla wouldn't be the worst thing. Far better than the nuclear fallout once the masses realize
---
This.
---
“He was up all night strip-dancing on the city mailbox asking for gold”
---
I love you btw.
---
The weirdest argument I've seen on here is "b-but the game is incomplete without PvP!". Yeah, of course it is. If the game being incomplete bothered me I wouldn't be interested in Classic to begin with because it lacks plenty of the elements that BC and other expansions added that actually improved the game, like arenas.
---
There's plenty to engage with and plenty of substance outside of PvP.
---
This is too real.
---
Blizzard became that mom who tells her slightly retarded kid Billy that: *"You can be what ever you want dear"*
---
And thus, retribution paladins were born.
---
Definitely this. Making friends, helping each other get gear, and just being happy together as you all do better and better.
---
NA/Oceanic Servers
---
Guild Name: Oceanic Classic WoW Guild (will pick an actual name later)
---
Faction: Alliance PvP
---
Primary Timezone: AUS (SYD/PERTH/SG/NZ)
---
Contact info or discord:  @[OCWG] Uurdz
---
Description: I'm building a guild with a focus on the 'good' of playing WoW.  You value positivity, friendliness and respect while believing respect also means putting in the required effort rather than expecting to be carried. If this sounds like you, please PM me or join the discord and read more about the type of guild we will be.
---
If you're a working professional and or have a family but still want to see end-game content in a fast, positive and flexible environment then you'll fit right in.
---
We will most likely choose a PvP server. As we are so far out from release i'm happy to change that decision if required.
---
Discord: https://discord.gg/ZZkGJkk
---
Same
---
Thanks!
---
I laughed pretty hard at xxaragornxx.
---
It's crazy that now I'm asking who I would be and it seems like fun. 
---
So..... for example.... I could be NorrisChuck and tell people interesting "facts" about myself.  Or would that be griefing?
---
Asking for a friend
---
The top comment of [this video](https://youtu.be/TqPQ4SNmx2c) has an explanation as well that might make sense too.
---
Nah same.  I just don't want to ruin it for someone else. 
---
That seems dope
---
The release of content is not going to have a significant impact on the longterm subscription base. You do not understand how the game worked in vanilla/TBC. Throughout the entire life cycle of the expat you have guilds at all different levels. If you start late you can find a couple groups of people that are progressing from molten core to BWL. This doesn’t even take into consideration the fact that they can simply rerelease fresh servers and a huge core population of classic enthusiasts will refill on to it. Progressing to TBC, WotLK and fresh severs leave plenty of room to maintain the player base.
---
IMO raiding 3h-5h non-stop is not playing casually, even few times a week. And it's the reason why I'm considering not even bothering with Classic.
---
Chills....
---
FP ganking isn't even really an issue.
---
50+ just dungeon it. Lower BRD on rince repeat.
---
the worldbosses will be HELL. i can't wait.
---
Trust me that won't help you haha. Once you start to play there is no turning back. I would suggest you play after doing everything for school. Then on weekends you can just play the whole day. Be consistent with school. Just my 2 cents.
---
They do well in 1v1 and 1v2 not 50v50.
---
//macro target:daddy castspell Heal
---
Then don't go into 50v50 battles? Unless you wanna min/max and head for rank 14 as soon as possible, which is still almost impossible before bgs anyway, then yeah maybe don't roll druid.
---
OR GIVE US DEATH
---
There's a BILLION times they could talk about, they haven't even scratched the surface.  
---
  This is why pretty much everyone expects a beta.
---
Yeah seriously. WPVP isn't fun at all when its nothing but being ganked while you're trying to level.  
---
I mention the frustration of the faction imbalance further down the comment chain too.  
---
I know if I do decide to play Classic WoW that I will be doing it happily on a PVE server.   
---
I spent all my time in retail WoW on a PVP server and never experienced a quarter as much toxic WPvP as I have on the vanilla player servers. It seriously is a different ball game.
---
Where are you getting these numbers from? Wasnt original pvp/pve almost 50-50? 
---
Anencodtal But everyone i know, minus one, voted pve this time around.
---
first of the latest blue posts i am a bit disappointed about. 
---
i understand why they made the decisions they made and i am ok with it. i knew it wasnt very realistic, but somehow i hoped for bgs in phase 1 so i can join a bg here and there while leveling. 
---
what i dont find very good is that in phase 1 while leveling the HKs are not counted. that takes away some of the reward of killing player of the other faction while leveling. 
---
although i am very looking forward to phase 2 without bgs but with pvp system. the whole world will be a battlefield &lt;3
---
Right in the feels...
---
Yes, all two of them...
---
You're still going with swords even as an orc
---
You take the good.. You take the bad.. you take them both and now you got the facts of life.
---
As long has they have flightmasters that defend themselves I'm happy.
---
On all the pservers I've rolled, whenever FM is attacked, the flying mounts he summons to just flap there doing nothing. This has resulted in many trolling incidents of by a single individual.
---
I'm not too concerned about it
---
less players in general
---
and it will likely be mostly ps players who do gank flight points
---
also ill be 60 by then so i can help dem low levels
---
Then what happens if/when they release an RPPvP server? Mass exodus, guilds and friends torn apart, some people rerolling, some not...
---
Of course that'll be a last ditch compromise but it is still a very ugly prospect for an RPPvP player.
---
If they do that, the fight is won.
---
I agree with You, the toxic environment private servers provided will be transfered to classic. There was times I wanted to quit the game because of the insane imbalance and grieving pvp'ers promoted. And I'm ALL in for PvP.
---
Every time a sword goes to a rogue an equivalent dagger should go to a warrior.
---
Perfectly balanced
---
I honestly don’t recall vanilla having or not having it. It was on the private server I played and I thought it was blizz-like. It triggered when landing or exiting bgs/dungeons. It didn’t stop us killing people as they landed to grief them, but it didn’t give us honour to do so. 
---
We used to camp the flight point in azshara when azerugos was up and kill entire raids one at a time as they landed
---
Bet your ass every possible addon that can be supported will find its way into classic. There was a lot of addon bundles that gave the game the same type of minimalist look as well
---
Man, You have no idea How a single guild of no life veterans can ruin the Fun for everyone in a server.
---
I'm curious to see how many people my age will be playing the game. I'm 19, started playing wow in WOTLK but had a lot of fun on classic and TBC private servers. 
---
I'm sure it's gonna mostly older players but hopefully there will still be young people. I think it's gonna be really hard to attract people that dislike MMOs to this game just because they aren't super popular anymore.
---
Thanks.
---
Classic pvp was the best. I played a lot of WoW back in the day, but my fondest memories all revolve around pvp.
---
* Kiting Azuregos to Ogrimaar and watching him shoot 100 deathbolts through the walls to all the poor souls in the AH that just got back from a pvp zone.
---
  * Wiping the enemy faction as they attempt to kill Kazzak, and then them watching while dead and hoping we fail (but we never did).
---
* Chasing a guy to the edge of the Ocean in STV. He stole the arena chest so he deserved it ok? I think he thought if he died in the water he could get away. Little did he know I had the water breathing mask and he kept spawning further and further out.
---
* Mind controlling someone off the camp in Felwood. They would die in another zone on a mountain and have to run all the way back as a ghost then jump off to get their body. Definitely a dick move.
---
  * Getting a small group together and killing pvp flagged players outside the main city (running in/out of the blimp). They would complain in general chat and larger and larger groups of people would come to try and kill us until they finally overwhelmed us.
---
Ditto for R11 if you're somehow doing it for the mount only.
---
28. no wife. no kids. feel sooo good.
---
can confirm. I remember calling my friends and bitching on forums in UO and EQ about carebears. Then WoW came into the scene and the amount of whining in the pvp servers was epic.
---
100% agree
---
low effort
---
Private server players are not some kind of evil cult that you have to join in order to understand how to do thing efficiently.
---
Anyone who wants to even attempt the rank 14 grind will be doing everything they can to farm honor.
---
And since this will be the official servers that arent going away any time soon, there will likely be even more people attempting to the grind.
---
My only complaint is WPvP objectives are introduced too late. The end result will be the same as in 2006; noone will care about them. Putting them before BGs is a perfect oppurtunity.
---
We definitely needed another one of these posts.
---
I'd guess it has something to do with the size of the events. Packet size is limited, and the server only ticks so many times a second. If one user was trying to do 1000 attacks (or actions) in the same 1ms window, the actions would have to be split up so they can traverse from the user's PC to the server node.
---
Not off the launch realistically speaking
---
You're remembering wrong. Also, there is a classic meta with veterans now and they will gank your ass until they logoff.
---
Since you'd have to walk to the BGs anyways you can't really join them while leveling anyways.
---
The honorless buff that pops up when getting off a flightpoint exists on live for exactly this reason. And people did the same in BFA to rack up kills for their warmode weekly for a much less impactful reward.
---
So no, I don't really expect this to be a private server only phenomenon.
---
Well that's why there's pve servers. Personally, I enjoyed trying to escape gank squads
---
(you vs the guy she tells you not to worry about) [https://imgur.com/a/pV5z6sB]
---
You can't get really lucky. It requires thousands of gold to be funneled to you, and only 1 person or anyone else who completes the quest line in a 24HR period.
---
If you're not in the top guild on the server there's pretty much 0% chance you will get it.
---
as far as i know battle masters will be in the game. so for example when you walk into a city to learn new skills you could queue for a bg to switch things up. thats what i had in mind.
---
Do these phases directly align with the PvE phases or are they independent?
---
This is a huge mistake. This decision Will make the same that happens in private servers to happen in classic. Not every content needs to have a timer to launch... 
---
People were leaving and making a faction imbalance even worse because some guilds from the same faction dominated the server, I'm sure this will happen again favored by this decision... It was the worst to be in the losing faction and not find where to Quest in peace because everywhere was being patrolled by parties of ranked players. This will kill the game for New players.
---
I never played classic. How are healers in pvp? Is priest the best class for pvp healing ?
---
I think the max you can jump is 2 ranks.
---
A fresh 60 rogue with preRaid/PvP gear has 2.8-3.3k health. You certainly lack control as dagger rogue in comparison to hemo and getting crit by overpower, MS, shattering mages etc. is a lot more damaging to you.
---
Hemo is *the* control class + spec in the game. You can 100-0 in various stuns and incapacitates and you can do it back to  back a lot more liable. A dagger rogue is bound to eat more damage and does need solid daggers to do well.
---
I just want a guild bank.
---
Glad I'm not the only one!
---
I know, hence the big fit smiley at the end.
---
I'm pretty sure we're still going to see Phase 2 in 2019. Dire Maul came out 3 months after launch. So I guess, I'll be rougly the same.
---
That alpha human mage fighting in the SFK screenshot looks just like Khadgar's Outland model from TBC
---
Y so serious?
---
The problem wasn't they focused on the 5%, nor that they focused on casuals.  
---
  Is that they tried to appeal to the lowest common denominator, ruining the game for both sides by making everything streamlined.  
---
  It is no longer a game the devs wanted, it's a game that can squeeze as most money from players without much work put into it.
---
Will this work in the official classic client since it's based off of retail macros and not vanilla
---
The debuff slot was discussed at Blizzcon and will be 6-8 at the start and go up to the 16 by  nax.
---
Sharding on launch already discussed but I can agree not in length.
---
The rest is all definitely valid points man but could all be discussed after the release date but prior to release.
---
Well, playing off-meta specs heavily depends on the built relationships too. 
---
Will I invite the random guy from a trade chat asking to join my BWL pug as retri pala? Probably not.
---
Will I invite a guy that I've played before, so I know his attitude, his skill level and his gear? Yea I will if he fits the criteria, because you know, you can't just say "fuck you" in your friend's face without a really good reason. If that guy is chill and really tries hard to squeeze out everything he can out of that spec, why would I won't let em?
---
That's what separates this game from retail in a good way. You can get along on acquaintance if you proved yourself well, and the game tends to create a lot of scenarios where you can do so :)
---
Man, is this the only thing are you able to comment on every post?
---
If the dane understands norwegian (which will be the default language in both guildchat and discord) and we can understand him (aka no halvfjærs crap when it comes to numbers), then yea, we could maybe accept a dane 🤔
---
I am pretty much no change but flight master farming will kill the game pretty quickly. This isn't even today's knowledge this was known back then. It just has been optimized over the years
---
Ah okay, that sounds reasonable. But hey, at least we have the world PvP while leveling, even when there's no incentive to do so :D
---
Shut up man, that's great!
---
They 100% should be. Doubt we will see an announcement for this in particular though.
---
A beta would answer most of the questions.
---
We could get a release date and a beta date in one and still have everything sufficiently covered prior to launch.
---
Haha ok fair call.
---
Now you’re talking
---
Well, he does call himself ass ass.
---
From what I remember there were a fair share of PvP on our PvE server. Crossroads raids were the best, all the people here talk about Hillsbrad Foothills but for me Crossroads was the place to be. 
---
There might be less PvP overall, especially the on-the-spot conflict, but it's not like it never hapoened.
---
15? Hardly. More like 90 minutes.
---
Yet the test in full bis did some 800 dps. Bwl gear did some 5-600. So who knows. Guess we'll just have to wait for the sims
---
Doing it is the reward
---
No kidding. Anyone thinking they'll be DPSing as a druid is either delusion or has no understanding of the full list of issues they faced in vanilla. It suck, but a badly geared fury warrior hitting heroic strike only will out DPS almost any feral druid...
---
I had a friend that never got past 30 would spend all his time playing the auction house. I on the other hand would run dungeons constantly because that was my jam.
---
It's impossible to tell how easy/difficult it is. Maybe if they change it to 8 it applies to all servers regardless of at what stage they are which will cause problems if they launch fresh servers in the future, who knows.
---
I agree, this does not seem possible.
---
If you manage to do 6-10 days worth of leveling in 2 days I'm gonna be really impressed.
---
Make your own battlegrounds. 
---
Astranaar is now your main objective. 
---
Try to kill Jonathan. 
---
To give you an impression on what the game might be without BGs:

---
When the honor system came out back then, it was the first thing we would do. Camp the western plaguelands all day for people arriving and trying to pass through, until an opposing group decided to try to push us back, sometimes with success, sometimes not. I don't see a reason why suddenly this wasn't the case anymore in upcoming Classic.
---
Phase 2, When the men will be seperated from the boys.
---
Most people won't have pre raid bis before BWL
---
Not under any circumstances should you be allowed to make both alliance and horde on ANY realm! This change to retail was one of many final straws to me 
---
I couldn't understand when they brought it in, after years of hating the opposing faction and levelling side by side with other players on the realm, recognising the top players of the opposing faction and wanting to kill them! Then one day, I log in and find I can make a horde character on my alliance realm? WTT?! it killed the game for me
---
Shadow priest is really good in both types of content, what differs is how you gear.
---
For PvP you want shadow damage and lots of it in order to hit like a truck. For PVE mp5 is your most important stat since you'll go oom without it, there's no point in blowing your load in the first 30 seconds of the fight and be useless the rest of the time.
---
People who say you only bring shadow weaving holy priests to raids are both elitist and ill-informed at the same time.
---
Agreed. Let's see them first fix the itemization so dungeon loot isn't overpowered and tier out the patches or stuff like that like the community has been asking about.
---
OH wait.
---
Uhm, that was added in like 1.4 only it was 30 seconds.
---
I have experienced this first hand leveling alliance getting camped in Felwood by horde. It is a fucking atrocious experience. The way to win is to team up with your fellow players and beat the living hell out of the campers. 
---
I do believe that the super campers will be in a very tiny minority of 14 hrs a day+ gamers. They will not succeed this time! SCREW THE PRIVATE SEVER MENTALITY! Fuck YEAH FOR CLASSIC!
---
Time to call in the Hueys
---
We have to think about it in reverse:   
---
nobody will do PvP in BGs for rewards if there isn't great gear involved. 
---
R13 PvP gear is around T1 and why would I grind 1500hours for R14 if I can just rollstomp MC once a week for similar gear? The problem comes with knowledge.
---
If you know that the gear becomes reasonably good at AQ40, you have a much smaller PvP community, because you can once again just do AQ40 to gain better gear than R13.
---
There is a direct comparison from one pserver to another. On Viper and Daemon's they improved the gear at BWL or ZG release, so quite in the middle of progression like it will be in Phase2. That meant that lots and lots of people farmed PvP gear for the 2pc R7/8/10 items and the PvP community was bustling. 
---
Come Whitekidneys + Crogges server, they implemented improved rewards in AQ40 and the community was butchered. A lot less people were doing PvP for rewards.
---
Therefore: better gear = more participation, a thriving PvP community and a huge pool of BGs so you are less likely to meet the topdog premade every 2nd game.
---
Still we have no confirmation about moonwalk!
---
With the 1.12. stats on quite a few pieces the PvE gear will not be bad itself. Savage Gladiator chain, Spritecaster Cape, Scholomance tanking gear etc. will be really good too. So noone is forced to grind out BGs really. The 2pc will be good for casters, sure, but its not like you need to farm r10. R7 will do and thats couple weeks of casual BGs.
---
Well, it's a double edged sword. Don't want world PvP including it stupid versions - do not roll on PvP realm. The server differentiation was dead on retail and most pservers are PvP and people just used to it or something. Previous surveys show a lot of interest in PvP realms but how many players will stop playing or reroll when it will become apparent world PvP is less "fun" daily than some mythical SS vs TM?
---
The R14 weapons were upgraded with the BWL patch in vanilla, therefore if you gain R14 around BWL release (14weeks of ranking), it's fine.
---
I understand why, I just don't agree. I liked the npcs everywhere, spawning the cavelry would tear through the mindless zerg of players.
---
People forget that we had no idea how to play the game back then, most of us not using BiS items and clicking our abilities, when people understand how the game works it's a lot more fun, I imagine it will be one of the reasons people will still opt for fresh private servers over classic :(
---
No.
---
They haven't talked about RP Goldshire censorship. I want to at least be warned when I walk in there.
---
The part bothering me is the hardcore players won't have to deal with that much ganking and will level (relatively) safe while casual will get destroyed the moment the system is put in place (that's what happened during vanilla)
---
Second point is the system reward (and encourage) lvl 60 to kill lvl48. I'm not against PvP and being able to kill low level but rewarding lvl60 players with a few BIS to go kill players with 10 lvl less and green armor of the whale is poor gameplay decision.
---
Some people here are complaining.
---
I am absolutely delighted.
---
That may come down the line... Classic Burning Crusade is what you're asking for.
---
Is that the expected /played to 60 at launch?
---
On the other hand I prefer having 2pieces that are very good and make people PvP so the PvP scene is bustling to PvP gear not really worth your time if you dont dig the looks or are a highend PvPer anyways who grinded R14 on 3 different pservers already.
---
Fact is: not updated PvP gear is just not worth ranking worth as PvE gear always overshadows it.
---
My rogue hands are sweating
---
That's not true at all lol.  I've been invited to most blizzard betas and they often only hold friends family betas under NDAs and they're entrusted group of testers that never shared a thing.  They dont need to stress test because they have the server power... BFA is dead and they know what their servers can handle.
---
As I answered in another post, it's what happened during Vanilla: I hit lvl48 the day hornor was put in place and suddenly you had group of lvl60 roaming all the 50-60 areas to farm their honor.
---
To a certain extent I could say that it can bring a part of thrill but especially if your on the underpopulated faction, it becomes just stupid.
---
Now I also know that it's not impossible (I did it) I just don't understand why the don't put the honor system directly so hardcore player have to face all the ganking and wolrd PvP while they are leveling to see what if feels.
---
The best one yet! Thanks for the chuckle.
---
Sure, but then again look how Dire Maul or BRM looks like on a pserver.
---
You have the first layer of rankers on Thorium Point and the passage from Badlands to Searing Gorge. The next is patrolling from Searing Gorge entrance to BRM. In BRM they are hiding behind the gates. Next is in the passage from the gates to the lava room. 
---
Now comes the chain. Last is the balcony ganking group. 
---
Same in DM. Behind each pillar is a group of gankers waiting for people.
---
It won't differ in regards that you *will* die. But it will differ that you dont die 10 times, but only once or twice.
---
Stop acting like we dont.
---
I'm not against people dedicating to the game having an advantage. I'm against having a system that make the hardcore players level in a (mostly) gank free world because they are no incentive to fight and then giving them an incentive to kill lvl48 two months later. 
---
No it's not the end of the world and I'll simply go PvE but I find it's terrible game mechanic that I could understand 15 years ago (the PvP was simply not ready when the game was shipped) but don't get now.
---
The majority of people who take it seriously will manage it in approximately 4 days and some hours of playtime. Speed runners might shave of anything from a whole day to a few hours, who knows.
---
I assume this can heal ok still? I love builds like this, something most people would 9 think of
---
The thing for me is that PvP server can be a lot of fun also so it's a bit sad to go PvE for me just because the system in place is bad. But it's not the end of the world and I'll probably be happy on PvE servers
---
private servers alter xp gains, loot drops, cherry pick which patch is current. Its all about the casuals
---
Priest are the best overall healing experience. A good holy Paladin is core for bg premades, and rare.
---
He might have played Vanilla, but not pservers. On actual Vanilla camping in 1.4 wasn't that big of a thing, and 1.5 with the BG's came quite fast after. On pservers on the other hand its generally a shitshow if they implement it this way.
---
I used to make a lot of WoW videos back in TBC-Cataclysm, and will pick back up again in Classic. Shameless plug of my [Classic WoW playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YapnavrfM7c&amp;list=PL3aA5ceAkBk0Vjt3K-JanHYcHaNiCYG56) so far!
---
Not a bad idea but unlikely to happen because it would be a tech nightmare. Who do you allow to sign up? Anyone? Or just people with active subscriptions (probably). Plus what are you signing up for? A Slot on a Server at Launch? I don’t think the matters much. What will be more of an issue would be total players online at launch.
---
I was a rogue, prove you are competent just like any other class and you’ll be fine. PvP as a rogue is incredibly satisfying in vanilla. Though this time I will be going warrior to off tank and go fury.
---
World record is still 4 days and 20 hours.  Really good is 6-7 days.  Procrastinators like me are 8-10 days.
---
Took 6 days for the freash elisum? Server to get its first 60
---
I think it'll really  depend on how the starting area is, how many people wil be camping spawns and so on
---
Here are some more Finlanders to come.
---
I'm more of a logitech kind of guy, so a G513 tactile and a G502 mouse for me, but I've heard very good things about corsair keyboards.
---
They kill the flight master so you can't fly away when you see you are about to be ganked, and wait for the no honor buff to go away.
---
The adventure, and the people we met along the way, and the mobs that ganked us.
---
Like the quests in Darkshore where you get swarmed by Murlocs in the sea and everyone was poorly equipped to deal with the situation.
---
Good times.
---
"alterac valley 1.12" *cry*
---
Good is like 5 days at this point. 8-10 days is typical if you’re casually leveling without a real plan but you’re still focused on leveling.
---
That was without most quests post level 47, too
---
Even if phase 1 is four months, that will give the people who work full time jobs enough time to hit 60 and gear up to do the entry level raids. Those who no life it and get to 60 in a week will probably get bored but that’s their own fault.
---
they only sell for 15s
---
True but they will be split  dps/tank.
---
No 60 ever goes to Stormwind in Vanilla, unless he got lost :-)
---
Not at all actually. From my understanding DKs kind of killed City raids etc. bit by bit because those who ranks in PvP or plan to do so in the future does not want to risk it of getting DKs by accident if they join a group of players for a city raid. I’ve seen others in this sub who share the opinion of city raids being a big and important part of World PvP. I don’t know what the solution would be to discourage players of killing low level npcs etc. Maybe as another said in this thread; only make certain quest npc’s marked as Civilian?
---
it’s against the rules of the sub and frankly it’s just a shitty post.
---
Wrath also bugged the gate for some servers then you started seeing death knights with the mount
---
"Forced to get r13 for bis"
---
No one can be "forced" to be the most active and hardcore PvPer on his realm. BiS gear is something to work towords, look up to and dream about. Its never a recuirement.
---
yeah if i was browsing r/xkcd sure but i’m not and i don’t need to see this shit.
---
Think one was a mage so they might have just been aoe farming

---
Is the, wolfhead a bug ?
---
Yea. I'm happy for the people that are excited for this, but for me it has just solidified my decision to play on a PvE server.
---
No change. Still a female dwarf holy paladin
---
yeah you’re underestimating how long it’ll take. 5 days is pretty good for people who have done it recently and have a planned route.
---
Quite possibly, but still yeah, expect to see world first on day 4/5. I know some people who are only going to sleep once 1-60
---
Just be an engineer and use the mind control cap
---
Elves?! Alliance scum. I'd rather die fighting beside a troll. *Plenty of those in stv...*
---
I think it's more stupid today than yesterday because I believe that devs honestly didn't expect people to play that much and underestimated the side effect of the honor system back then and it was too late when they realized it to change.
---
Putting back such an awful system 15 years later while you know it will push people to play way too much is ethically very problematic in my opinion
---
Pretty sure there are some Trolls and gorillas that beg to differ.
---
I've been doing bg's as main source for PvP for 15 years now. Im really excited about patch 2. Where world pvp is the one and only source for honor. 
---
Heart so many awesome stories about this time.
---
No it fucking will not. It will probably take most 8-9 days+ and thats with questie. Only people with planned leveling routes break 6 days and thats fast as fuck
---
You need a couple of raidmembers with Hydraxian Waterlords reputation, to be able to fight Majordomo and Ragnaros in Molten Core.
---
In Vanilla there was a no honor debuff, if you just arrived at a FP and get killed your enemy didn't gain any honor points. Not sure for how long the debuff lasted. But honor grinding at a FP was no efficient way to farm honor. Ofc you could get killed anyway, but it was not the total mess some people are talking about now.
---
Low effort
---
They aren't going to mean anything since everyone knows they're going to disappear. I think Blizzard should pull a sneaky randomly make one of the other colors not available.
---
Excuse me, they only catered to the top 5% of players? Fuck me I love my hardcore raidfinder sessions!
---
Like me lol, if we can get a release date so i can have time off work !!!
---
Yeah I'm honestly shocked by how good the quality of his vids are. He deserves all the subs.
---
You are mostly correct. No one dual wielded fury until very late vanilla. 2 handed fury was what all the warriors used in my guild for pve DPS.  A war named lugdush got it in ours and it killed in DPS until dark edge/naxx.
---
Listened to 5 hours of that podcast with Staats and Kern (#12 and #13). Leaving aside that this is a 2018 source on 2004 and not something that came from any current employee. (For example, they called a Rogue a "Thief" at one point, and thought that there were achievements in Vanilla. So not exactly the most reliable of memories.)
---
I didn't hear 2.5k come out of either of their mouths. Kern said that Allen Adham (left Blizzard in 2004) wanted servers to be as small as possible pre-launch as a design decision. However, then they both agreed that post-launch the cap was determined by technical constraints.
---
Since we know that technically they could handle more than "2500" and there is evidence of specific servers going well over this number, I really don't think it's an accurate statement to say that **live** vanilla servers were limited to that number as a hard cap on concurrent players.
---
And yet people try to claim it was the absolute most you'd see on a server all the time.
---
There is no time frame from the content releases?
---
Even if it were every 4 months, the average player will only reach 6 after 1-2 months of starting regardless, leaving 2 whole months of gearing towards MC and Ony plus progressions?
---
War mode was added to give you bonuses for leveling and quest rewards by staying flagged.  All retail servers are PvE by default and allow you to go into the world with War Mode.
---
Just adding my voice to the "watch Platinum Wow" train. He really is just that good :).
---
&gt; Classic Burning Crusade is what you're asking for.
---
Not exactly. Although, something like pre-BC but post-2.0 Classic would be a good start.
---
Pretty much, I'm just going to grind on boars with my friends for a few months... Jk, I don't have any friends.
---
Having AQ40 level gear gear available before BWL even launches is a problem. People saying "so what not many people are going to have it" are completely missing the point.
---
If they don't have the un-updated stats available they should just rebalance it so it is slightly better/worse than BWL gear.
---
Im in the same boat as you. Played a mage in vanilla and TBC and part of me really wants to go back to mage for classic just for the sake of nostalgia, but I switched to melee classes ever since tbc/wrath and never really looked back. I tried to get back into my mage for legion cause I always felt bad about my coolest titles and mounts being locked to that character lol. In the end I felt really bored by the ranged playstyle
---
Im thinking rogue for that sweet melee fun, cool weapons, great in wpvp (dont really plan on doing BGs that much), great in pve, gear that can be used in pve and pvp, etc
---
True. 
---
Pvp - Home-made burgers
---
Pve - Mcdonalds
---
8-10 is very fast. Wtf are you talking about. Stop trying to talk like leveling in vanilla was a cakewalk that took 4 days.
---
&gt; Then I remember I’m no changes and I put myself in time out.
---
I'm "No changes" but I still wish they'd make quest NPC's non PvP flagged instead of putting DHKs back and ruining world PvP.
---
The first 60 on the pserver previously mentioned was critten a night elf hunter. He was flanked with mages as far as the eye could see though.
---
I think the true question is. Do we need to que for warsong at the original spot. Or will we have the battle masters. Because that, changes everything.
---
I don't really have much to say about this. Lookin' solid! I'm so excited for world PvP again, it's like Christmas! Actually.. Phase 2 might actually be the active phase during Christmas :)
---
P.S. please add RP-PVP
---
I haventr used anything but the standard UI on retail. At least since about wrath! I think that if there is no beta, and there is no add-ons at classic launch, well that will certainly be interesting when people try to play without questie! 😂😂
---
8-10 is very fast for an old person playing casually. It’s not “very fast”for anyone seriously trying to level quickly though. 4 days is very fast for a speed runner at this point.
---
Aye Stonemaul Horde represent! I was a noob troll hunter but my buddy raided on a Shammy in Unknown Entity all the way up to Saphiron in Naxx! Fucking great times.
---
Idk have the feeling the banks own most of these homes or they live in poor areas.
---
You're living a world of delusion if you're serious right now.
---
ye but there is a stupid artificial reason for it. If a pally is equiped with full plate gear in every slot where possible, he get's a 5% bonus to his main stat I believe. Every class get's this. Just so pally and shaman would not wear leather / cloth, a hunter and warrior wwould not wear leather etc....
---
Server first will be in the 4-5 days /played range.
---
Average hardcore players will be in the 5.5-7.5 day range.
---
Actual average player will be in the 8-12 day range.
---
Some classes simply can't level faster than 5.5 days.
---
If you genuinely think 8 days is fast for someone who’s actually trying to speed level you’re the one being delusional. I’m done replying to this though either you’re 30iq or we’re arguing about two different things and either way it’s not worth my time to reply to.
---
&gt;It is absolute crap to lose tier pieces and pvp gear to some guy who's at best competing with your worst DPS.
---
Well i definitely agree with this. I think im just a little more lax about all this cuz my old guild on pservers was legit clearing MC around 45 minutes every time, and BWL bout an hour and change. We had a few meme specs in the squad, but they definitely gave 100% effort.
---
4 days is not possible without Mage aoe grinding or private server XP rates. The record is still 4 days 20 hours, since the vast majority of private servers have incorrect XP values on quests. They usually use the TBC values, which were significantly higher than vanilla.
---
“Private server xp rates” please expand on this because I guarantee you I know a hell of a lot more about this than you do. The record from 15 years ago is completely meaningless. The tbc values post 40 were fixed a while ago and people are still getting under 4 days.
---
These have been in JB since original release, they just have a lot of stock
---
"how is it going to affect you other than how it's going to affect you" This is a multiplayer game. People are going to have AQ40 weapons before AQ40 is released. People are going to have 6 pieces of t2 2 weeks after BWL releases. Hardcore guilds are going to realize that camping people 24/7 is the only way to get BIS gear. There's absolutely no reason for this to have to happen.
---
You also have these two:

---
4 days isn’t very fast it’s 20 hours faster than the world record. I can guarantee you there won’t be people breaking that record by almost 20% less time spent since the current holder is arguably the most optimized and knowledgeable. 
---
The speed runners will be following Joana’s guide and might make it in the 4d20h time but they sure as hell aren’t going to be beating it, especially by that much.
---
It's not. Some players just like to label the use of obscure items as bugs/glitches.
---
I hope I will survive phase 2 and still be able to have children after that ! :o
---
It gives an interesting opportunity for players to gain their character's renown by saving people or fear by annihilating people.
---
Im not concerned about PvP gear of high ranks being gained because thats going to be at the very MOST minimal. People complain about how hard it is to rank we all know that and DHK's will at least prevent key mobs being mass camped.
---
Holy shit this comment is so unbelievably stupid I genuinely can’t believe you took the time to write it. “The speed runners will be following joanas guide” LOL why do you people type if you have absolutely no clue what you’re talking about.
---
I've always played "Bring the player, not the class" and that's not what Blizzard have changed WoW into. They've changed WoW into "Bring the player because every class is exactly the same now".
---
Dane time,  was worried about the scandinavian prescence but i think we'll be just alright :)
---
The best runners are reaching 3 and a half - 4 days to 60 pretty consistently on fresh launches.
---
I personally managed 5 days with a priest with my 2nd 60 in 10 years.
---
I also managed 6 days on a mage on Nostalrius in its prime when there was literally 13k+ pop online every night.
---
By all means keep living in your delusions. Remember to send me a ss of your (1)4 days /played once you hit 60 lmao
---
*“Laughs in Undead”*
---
I'm going to be one of those people who farms low level players to stay competitive and get my rank 13. I'm just saying I think it's stupid and will hurt the game.
---
Time to call in the House MD
---
Don't forget that the average leveling time is 8-12 day of /played, If as myself you can only play around 10 hours a week it will take you months to get to 60 compared to a no-lifer that can play 18h a day
---
Fuck off they made everything easier and more casual. They catered to your 95% what even is this sob story.
---
More like Phase 1, Phase 2 should discourage some people with DHKs but the majority won't be givign a fuck lol.
---
Pve server boys
---
Joana isn’t even going to be following his old guide lmao, I’d be willing to bet that someone beats the joana record by 20% but between the fact that you’re a random on the internet and likely pretty poor considering how stupid you’ve shown yourself to be I’m just gonna not do that :)
---
How will some 30 year olds still be able play 18 hours a day ?
---
What's all this phase 2 stuff about? Must've missed something.
---
technically there would be no guarntee they would have reached rank 14. In a sense the GM would have punished a ranker that was doing better than that guy because that guy got dk's.
---
We're in different countries at the time of the release, but we will try as soon as we can!! Man, classic is going to be good!
---
Wrong. After SW got AH, a lot of people had their HS in SW for Ony/Nef buff.
---
Haven’t heard that song since that time period.
---
They aren't talking about killing the flight masters themselves. Just the people landing there.
---
Just add them in forever, give people a larger range of mount choices. Also really good for RP if you can have an unarmoured mount for in city etc.
---
**Brings out popcorn
---
True  ;-)
---
plenty of hardcore wow raiders had jobs in 2006
---
PTO
---
Love it.
---
You have my sword
---
They said the 4 phase was a temporary plan subject to change. And then they changed it.
---
The 16 slot debuff limiit was final.
---
The debuff slots was discussed at Blizzcon, yes. It was said it will be 16 from the start. ;)
---
I'm pretty sure Joana himself would laugh at you for saying something so retarded.
---
They’re releasing the honor system before battlegrounds. The only way to get honor is to kill the opposite faction out in the world, hillsbrad and STV are gonna be straight war zones.
---
https://www.wowhead.com/news=291079/classic-pvp-content-plan-explained  
---
Looks like there will be no Honor System and PvP Rank Rewards at launch
---
We are 15 friends from Denmark who plan to play together.. 
---
As of now, we plan on making our own guild, and try to create a community with focus of PVE, with raiding 2-3 times a week, but overall we aim to do both PVE and PVP, and just create a guild where people want to hang out, want to farm and hang on a discord channel and actually engage with each other.. I think there are a ton of Scandinavian guilds out there, we dont specifically want it to be Scandinavian, since the recruitment will be a lot harder, and even if its people from norway, sweden and denmark, the language would still be english, so it wouldn't make much of a difference for me/us..
---
What realm are you planning on playing on? A buddy of mine and myself are looking to play classic, both Norwegian, but neither have time to be super hardcore about raiding, even though we can play quite a lot of hours.
---
There are two 4-slot bags given as a quest reward (one for the alliance, one for the horde); if you are leveling in another zone than Durotar or Westfall, I suggest you go there and earn them. Some 6-slot pouches drop from low lvl mobs, so let's hope you'll be lucky :) If you are not, there are going to be plenty of tailors looking to level their profession, they usually craft bags for free with your mats.
---
At 15 lvl one more opetion appears. I mean Captain Sander's Booty Bag (a nice 8-slot bag). It's a quest reward from one of Westfall quests, but it requires some grinding, cause the quest item usually doesn't drop that easily. Also according to classic.wowhead the quest is available for Horde players also; I'm going to test it personally while Classic.
---
One more quest reward (it's for both Alliance and Horde players) is Deviate Hide Pack, a reward from one of Wailing Caverns quests. The quest could be done easily solo if your character is 20 lvl by farming mobs outside the instance.
---
I was in my servers top Horde raiding guild. Second only to the top alliance guild. Clearing Naxxramas for server firsts.  
---
And i was a clicker. Along with pretty much every caster in the guild at the time. Clicking was no detriment to killing raid bosses in Vanilla. Organizing 40 ppl with dubious internet connections was the real hardship back then. One mechanic going off on a dc'd person would lead to a wipe.  
---
Any raider with keybinds will have a significant leg up from the get go in comparison.
---
Norwegian here trying to convince 16 of irl friends to join! Might end up with 12 of them at launch!
---
Thanos would like to know your Location.
---
Except not- there's no reason why camping flightmaster or people who fly to them will give you DHKs..?
---
Holy shit that mage was ahead of his time. From the the UI to his skills, impressive oldschool pvp video
---
I powerlevelled my priest in vanilla to get into raiding fast.
---
I can't wait to just take my time and enjoy the zones.
---
it functions as an off-healer, mainly. you’ll keep shadow weaving up as much as possible, and heal or wand the rest of the time. since you’ll be missing inspiration, improved renew, and the cast speed improvements, you won’t be as useful for healing compared to the holy priests in the raid. but you’ll likely have other priests for inspiration on the tanks, as well as a designated renew-on-tanks priest with 3/3 imp renew, so you won’t be depriving a raid of much holy priest utility. 
---
the biggest issue is the slower cast speed. if you can get used to it, then you’ll make the most out of it, but it does reduce your total possible throughput by a solid 16-25%. in raids, you won’t feel this too much, since it’s such a collaborative effort, but if you’re undergeared in a 5-man without a warlock to take advantage of shadow weaving, this will suck a lot. so, ideally get some gear before changing over to this spec, and run with warlocks.
---
in pvp, you’ll shine as a dps/off-healer when paired with a warlock of course, or you can play back and be a huge nuisance to kill as you can peel for yourself super well. PI-ing yourself and spamming imp mana burn on a theak with max shadow weaving also doles out a ton of pressure, if you can safely get in range. if not, just peel for your warlock and throw out dps/heals as needed.
---
Flight masters aren’t civilians are they
---
Joana has completely rewrote his guide, why the fuck would he be doing that if his original route was optimized.
---
It's for sure not just a thing that will happen on pservers.  Only real difference will be that it wont happen as often.  I can't imagine server caps will be anything higher than 5k let alone the 10k+ pservers reach.  That difference alone will mean its less prevalent.  Will for sure still happen tho.
---
Raids in retail for the past few years have been extremely harder than anything in vanilla, TBC or WLK (except for buggs that made bosses unkillable ofc).
---
Adds in boss fights have more abilities and are harder to deal with than most bosses in all vanilla raids.
---
The problem is that they catered the rest of the game to  suite those 5% raiders as well. Raiders saw lvling as a obsticle for late game, they made lvling easy cakes. Raiders saw a problem in inbalance between classes, Blizzard made every class equal.
---
The reason WoW dropped subs is because those 95% didn't like the game anymore. They removed everything that's fun and have created some kind of raiding simulator now.
---
&gt; The best runners are reaching 3 and a half - 4 days to 60 pretty consistently on fresh launches. 
---
With PServer bootsted XP rates you mean ? If Blizz has its original XP rates Data, leveling will take longer, because PServers used mostly TBC values for their quests, which on higher levels were boosted up to 30+%. And questing XP is really important past a certain level, as it far outweights grinding. 
---
That's not to mention things like overpopulated servers. Either way, you'd better add 1day of /played at least to your leveling time record for Classic.
---
The fucking FUN IS THE REWARD, GOD DAMN IT
---
Please explain how private xp rates are boosted.
---
When men will be separated from the skeletons, because the boys will not exist.
---
People will be in the leveling zones for 48+ because you get honor from them so you gank the people bellow 60 and kill the people ganking your factions bellow 60s.
---
I think it's just a side of effect of early tbc items being mostly simple recolors of high lvl vanilla gear. But TBC was in general a very colorful expansion with bright green and purple everywhere.
---
Not worth the weeks of hard labor of adding 14 item IDs to mount vendors
---
Wow I did not know this. Underrated comment ty!
---
Even if FP ganking becomes a major issue (I don't think it will, see end of post), it's going to be faster to fly in, get ganked, and res somewhere you can run away from. Even dying 2-3 times is probably still faster than running.
---
I don't think this will be a major issue, though. First, private server hardcore PvPers represent a small number of people who will end up spread across the Blizzard regions and then across multiple servers. Second, Blizz server population caps are far lower (~2.5-3k normally) compared to private servers (~8-10k), meaning there will be far fewer people popping up at any particular flight path. You might get a select few flight paths being camped at peak times but most of the time it won't be worth camping.
---
A lot of people are expecting private server culture to just migrate 1:1 onto Classic, as if Classic is just another incarnation of F R E S H pservers. I don't think that's going to happen.
---
They could also quit this job because fuck working when there be people to slay!
---
and MY AXE
---
They are based on a BC rollback so the quest xp has values from BC AFTER they were increased as a catch up mechanic.
---
“Content creators”
---
Dude private servers dont count for obvious reasons. You think they had a database with xp values for all quests? They literally had to make up a bunch of stuff.
---
You think the type of people who spend an hour griefing players care about DK?
---
Like everyone else has stated, Paladins have the best time dealing with pvp focus. Bubble, BoP, BoF, Lay on hands and so on. Lots of panic buttons in a addition to plate armour makes them very hard to kill
---
Yesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyes...
---
**YES!**
---
It's a private server hero, not realizing they are receiving boosted exp on private servers.
---
There's vomit on his tunic already
---
Again with people thinking Classic will be a straight 1:1 copy of pservers. The vast majority of the playerbase that will end up on Classic will have had *zero* experience with pservers.
---
My boy soupasoka, personal fav wow channel
---
You realise it differs all over the world.
---
&gt; we’re arguing about two different things
---
You're absolutely right you are. You're arguing based on boosted exp that is on a private server.
---
And you have no idea what you’re talking about
---
It’s not a private server thing. Everyone who’s interesting in ranking up will be doing it.
---
Damn, these 2 bonuses make chain heal really OP.  How can Tier 3 even be better than that gear set up when you factor in set bonuses?
---
Annual leave? Unemployed? Inbetween jobs?
---
I'm planning on booking at least a day or two off work for Classic launch. One of my siblings will probably take the week off.
---
This is really stepping into pointless nostalgia territory
---
well I've been working 72 hours a week for the last year so If I quit my job I've technically already worked an extra 9 months than if I would have worked 40 hours a week. I'm going to no-life for a couple months before going to college.
---
That was fixed on the newer servers and people still managed sub 4 days comfortably.
---
I remember something like that wasn’t it introduced later though?
---
Lol its gonna be a HUGE issue in p2.
---
Bruh ...
---
Even though it's Cyanide &amp; Happiness.
---
*Woah!* It's your **4th Cakeday** Softclouds! ^(hug)
---
Meet you bitches at thorium point FP do or die sluts
---
&gt;Nothing too game-changing
---
Okay I'm listening
---
&gt;Reckoning around being hit
---
CALL THE POLICE
---
Your recommendation makes absolutely no sense at all. When you walk to your destination your travel time increases so the chance of being ganked is way higher than just... Flying.
---
PVP or RP-PVP if they becpme an option. Send me a message if ypu're interested 😊
---
&gt;Could care less what type server people play on.
---
Ahh, but how MUCH less could you care?
---
Would they be 1000g or cost less because its 1.12?
---
in 1024x768 and a 4:3 aspect ration? :)
---
Yolo is back on the menu
---
Blizzard won't patch their game from "webbsites".
---
They got 1.12 data. We get 1.12 Classic. The end.
---
I didn't say anything about rushing to level.  Just that I think the worst part of being camped for most people is that it's a giant waste of your time at any level.  Thus not using flight paths to avoid ganking is counterproductive.  Traveling may be part of the game, but I doubt many people find it enjoyable.
---
Like I said before, anyone complaining about it probably shouldn't be on a pvp server.  People act like everyone on pvp servers has an honor code, but there will always be people camping for no good reason other than to piss people off.. Flight path or no flight path.  Hell, pve servers can be just as bad when people kill the flightmasters.
---
Nah it’s world pvp because they found you - wherever. You could be sitting with pants down in a toilet in stormwind. You don’t get to set terms :)
---
Can you get undead mounts as Tauren?
---
Yes, to some extent anyway. I started out on an RP realm so that just made it feel even more like an adventure. Just did things for fun back then, setting up random events and shit without a care in the world. That was special.
---
Personally it was my first MMO, so that helped too.
---
Yes and they also should be removed again so people who work hard early and get them can then flex their unobtainable mounts.
---
20 isn’t that much of a grind really. I imagine lots won’t make it anyway though.
---
How hard is it to get rank 10?
---
I don't think they are, but I could be wrong.  I thought they made them 55 elites with hella summons for a reason.
---
Flight masters don't give DHK
---
So if some “neckbeards” have this bad ass gear that helps you down the bosses quicker and they don’t need the loot to further guild progression that... helps... you? You literally have less people to gear if some people are willing to grind for hours for another loot option. Praise them not curse them. And if you’re upset about it in PvP.. these same people would have put in the time either it be honor gear or raid gear and still crush you.  As others said the blue gear is going to help more people get geared for raiding should they choose this route.
---
&gt;Play whatever class/race/spec you want
---
And how do you find out which class/race/spec you want to play? By Asking questions about the differences between the different classes/races/specs.
---
With dynamic spawns, increased drop rates and 4 bags when leaving the starting area.

Listen to the segment: Calling Countdown #4 – 1:37:45 – The Race To 60 With Alenya &amp; Umbra
---
Horde or ally? (swede here)
---
I'm 30 in 2 weeks :/ the feels are real
---
Paladin is very viable. You are a healer though. Trying to spec a healer into some sort of dps is not really "viable", so what?
---
My friends who play other games seem to think ‘gank’ means to steal something.
---
Played a mage called Moshu
---
On my first PVE server all wpvp stopped instantly once BG were released.
---
I rerolled on a fresh PVP server a few weeks after that.
---
Worked hard last 5 years to be financially and mentally stable
---
Classic wow in summer 2k19
---
Other priest still can purge em
---
Lol having a "spy" on the other faction isn't against the ToS. If I want to pay 15$ for another account to place a character on the other side, that is my business and my money. Good luck finding who I am, let alone getting me banned.
---
It's honestly ret pala and enh shaman prio. 2h swords are better for warriors.
---
Fingers crossed \^\_\^  
---
If you chose to roll Horde, then keep me in mind.
---
&gt; play druid or rogue and stay in stealth 24/7.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; do a 360 degree sweep of at least 200yd around your questing area.  
---
&gt; Start to attack quest mob    
---
*enemy rogue stealth noise*
---
I think you misunderstood what he said
---
6 days as in 6x24 hours of 6 x 10 hours or something like that?
---
Oh god no.. English is way easier. Danish/Swedish/Norwegian might be related, but I'm donkey balls at accents.
---
5 days, as in, 5 x 24 hours?
---
No joke. GoT will help fill in that void, even though it's not gonna have that many episodes.
---
I'll have a look. Thanks.
---
Lovely story ty for sharing
---
One more Swede here! And this sound fun to have have a nordic guild with Norway, Sweden, Finland and Danmark. Would make it much easier to find players of all types(Hardcore, Social etc) to join if we make something like this. 
---
An other nice plus is that we have the same time zone, so it would be easy to plan out events etc.
---
I will play Horde on a PvP server. And I guess it will be best to have a guild for each faction? Cause it would be very hard to try to get everyone to play the same faction.
---
I am up for being serious about this and make a Discord.
---
*fwish schlick schlick fwish*
---
This is the real answer. Combine realms, optional transfers. Keep the vanilla servers alive. Don’t force us to move to the next xpac.
---
Anecdotal story on Mug’Thol. There was a shaman who was rank 13 and doing the grind. Some guys messaged him saying they needed help killing some alliance in world PvP. He replied “invite” and accepted the summon. The group made three DK’s. I recall the guy being in absolute tears on vent. He ended up petioning a GM and they gave him rank 14 the next week.
---
^
---
Where does it say that he was NOT for killing the NPCs? all it says that They invited &amp; summoned him and he accepted and cried afterwards.
---
There's a huge difference between Reading between the lines and Reading comprehension
---
Why ? 
---
I know you can use bank alt for bank and auction house. But this isn't the only purpose of Stormwind ?
---
You hit rank 3 ish from pvping ever at L60. Rank 7 ish is easy enough to hit casually. Rank 10 takes a bit of dedication. Rank 12+ is a lifestyle of fulltime wow pvp with premades.
---
Yeah, would be awesome if 5-10 of my old guildies wanted to play Classic on a more than tourist basis.
---
You will learn while leveling and doing easy dungeons.
---
Now a good tank is not common because there are many things to learn to be better.
---
-positioning, agro on multiple mobs, avoiding damages taken.
---
So my advice is do all dungeons once to train tanking, and always try to tank AND move. Don’t be rigid.
---
Alliance!
---
Greetings fellow viking!  
---
Norwegian here.  
---
I started as late as 2009.  
---
But I have a huge passion for classic. Recently stopped playing retail WoW (december/January)  
---
Atm I don't know how many of my friends that are returning. Atleast one off em.  
---
I hope for a huge friendly scandinavian community.
---
True. I was just wondering about this community. Obviously, there will be plenty more Scandinavians at launch.  
---
I'm also trying to find a group of 5-10 ppl to roll on the same server with. Makes things a lot easier to level and grind ;)
---
Hello sir. It was a joke.
---
Timbermaw hold have cool enchants and some fine recipes. If you don't need anything from them, just grind to unfriendly, so they will let you pass.
---
Also, Argent dawn have some pretty good stuff.
---
These two will be good to grind on phase one. And hydraxion waterlods, too.
---
Next, will be good to have rep with cenarion circle before aq40 release.
---
And battleground reps, after they will become available.
---
Not necessarily for 3 months. You have to grind that much for 1 month, when you start to arrive around rank 11/12 and want to push to 14.
---
To go to rank 6/7,  5 to 10 hours per week is largely enough
---
That's a great idea lol
---
Oooo, that's definitely interesting!
---
Get to 60 moderately fast, make friends, go on exciting adventures, then when you reach 60 - GRIND MODE ENGAGED and fuck everything and everyone up with the friends you made during leveling.
---
Had some good times in WorldPVP against you guys \^\_\^
---
Is this 4 days on a fresh realm with zero rested XP? Rest makes a gigantic difference, obviously.
---
Fucking boomers
---
If there's one thing ive learned from my own experience its that age plays a significant factor to how you play videogames.
---
Back in vanilla i was pushing very hard to lvl and and to gain pvp ranks. I look back at my teenage self now and just shake my head.
---
I hope majority of Classic players will be chill and contribute to a great and positive experience but i also can't tell how others should play.
---
My plan is to find a guild that accepts off specs and just have fun, cuz it really doesn't matter to me clearing the raids again, what matters is the journey.
---
Yep, 5 days on /played
---
I Played on Mal'ganis Alliance during wow's original release. It was one of the few Horde dominated servers. World pvp was still amazing for me. We had guilds that did the flight path camping (Elitist Jerks and Sword of Storms come to mind) and it didn't really bother me. Having the battle grounds in right when honor is implemented will ruin one of the best experiences of WOW imo. Don't be afraid to pvp on a pvp server. Getting camped may be frustrating, but its going to happen, even at level 60. You're probably going to end up camping someone yourself. Its all a part of the experience.
---
That's it. The rest of the games pathetically casual.
---
Raids are only that way as it's competitor is FFXIV which has mechanics vomit for every savage boss.
---
don't train skills you don't need, vendor everything, and find some good 30-40 grind spots. focus on grinding 35-40 and you will have just enough gold to buy your mount. 
---
a great spot many players don't know are the hyenas packs in desolace. they have very, very little hp and drop great vendor loot, and are even better for skinners. There's enough packs spread around desolace meaning you won't have any downtime, except the traveling in between packs of course. bonus points for hunters and druids for faster travel time.
---
another great spot for 30s grinding is in Alterac mountains. The 34-36 Crushridge ogres have little hp and more than enough spawns to keep you going indefinitely. And there's literally a (engineering) vendor in the grind spot itself. 
---
although i'm fairly sure that it'd be faster in the long term if you just kept questing and got your mount somewhere around level 42-43. Gold rewards from questing/grinding in Badlands alone will net you like 30g.
---
I was horde for 14 years, I think I'm gonna roll nelf hunter or gnome mage for efficient leveling and partying. 10 sec shadowmeld CD? count me the fuck in!
---
Unofficial Scandinavian server sounds a lot like good ol' Stormscale
---
Sharding, server cap, beta (if it's going to happen. Hint: it needs to happen)
---
No, of course not. It's just that everyone and their mothers stayed in good old Ironforge. Stormwind was pretty barren over the course of vanilla.
---
knuckles
---
Just how many more times will people post this "Just play whatever" thread? There's like one every three days on the top of this sub. I think people got the message by now.
---
Think you're talking about OPie, you can put just about anything on those wheels, it's real neat and convenient for stuff you use every now and then.
---
My guild had a shadow priest tank Molten Core once, just because we could.
---
This subreddit has the difficulty completely overblown. The logistics of consistently getting 40 people online for a few hours dwarfs raid difficulty and optimization (pun intended).
---
I agree😄
---
just go kill the jaguar in swamp of sorrows from lvl 35 to 40 and you'll end up with 150-200g at lvl 40
---
You have to think that there's a lot of people who will become absolutely hooked for the first time.
---
Imagine hitting so hard, the server has to take a step back in awe of your strength.
---
This pally was an absolute unit.
---
No because kids attentions spans have shot way down with the rise of smart phone / internet use
---
"private server" is like the new "other" word for some people it seems like. PvP servers weren't the "special" selection, they were common and had more character.  When I first got the game it was straight to a pvp server with my friends.
---
It does certainly fall under the rule of cool though. While not the most powerful thing, it certainly is cool.
---
Hi, /u/Vermilion60
---
Warlock!
---
Not sure if Undead or Gnome, it depends on where my friends will be, if Horde or Alliance.
---
EJ was dominant in PVE. But my guild Extreme dominated PVP! Got several invitations to reroll as alliance lol. Looking forward to seeing you on the battlefield again old friend
---
I'm really curious what it will be like because in vanilla people didn't really know about ranking and most people were still noobs trying to hit 60 at this point.  Now there will be lots of 60s who might just start griefing for something to do
---
I don't know if i can't wait, or if its just going to be a miserable bloodbath
---

---
4?
---
Maybe those private servers had a higher population that the Blizzard servers will be? And wouldn't Blizzard counter this sort of thing if it got out of hand (sharding, etc?).
---
Is this loss?
---
Mmo isnt a genre the youngsters are reslly intrested in anymore it feels like. 
---
Saw on a pol that only 9% of the classic sub folks are under 20 years of age.
---
No more than we are by Everquest progression servers.
---
Agreed. Would just be a pointless flex for a select few.
---
I love that it takes so long. When you finally get to 60 it feels like such an achievement.
---
28 here. Gave up on romance and creating a family, bettering myself or working on a career after many failed attempts.  Figure I'll spend the next X amount of years pouring myself into WoW like I did when I was 14. Fuck it.
---
summer
---
It’s /played time, so 1 day = 24 hours.
---
on a server I can't remember the name of I leveled a rogue and the easy part was 1-10, it feels bad at lvl 10-15 when you are in all white gear save a few really basic greens which makes some mobs difficult to kill without paying attention. Past that, once you get your gear rolling and keep first aid relevant you pretty much just blow through mobs especially as combat but daggers aren't so bad either but the only dagger rogue I leveled was during TBC.
---
I want to tank dungeon, not sure i want to in raid
---
Id be interested in joining! If you can shoot me a dm with your discord
---
This is how I feel all the time. Especially when people start bsing about hardcore raiding.
---
You and me both, I want to really enjoy the journey for a couple of months.
---
Those were good times, having to avoid high level players on my alts.
---
people get too focused on getting shit done and the end goal.
---
Just play the game and have some fun. You'll be high level soon enough and fucking other people up.
---
I hope this winter isn't as *mediocre* as all the other winters so far.
---
Probably true, but they often had many civilians around them which got caught up anyway so I'd say it's still pretty risky going for them when DHKs become active.
---
Honestly, it really seems like the Classic dev team takes the old Blizzard philosophy to heart. They seem connected to the community. When people wanted more phases they added 2 more, now they show they got the PvP phases to include all the historic eras of PvP (pre-BG's being wildly asked for). They also seem to stick to their guns when necessary. Sometimes the devs do know best. That balance of listening to the community, while also sorting out what would not be a good idea is not easy to keep.
---
Now they just need to follow the soon^(TM) and not just release it premature and it honestly seems to be all we wanted. No date yet is a good sign, but I guess there is still a tiny bit of fear that they get forced to release summer from higher ups even if they might want to postpone a quarter.
---
It's pretty fun to see how the official Blizzard project that so many pserver fanboys cursed as going to be absolute shit that will never be as "good as pservers" seems to be totally nailing it. If they keep this up I'll be happy to throw money at them every month.
---
I feel like with the right support and people, they would be completely immersed like we used to be. Obsessed with the new twitch streamers and youtubers that gain popularity and are extremely entertaining.
---
I think there will be a good chunk of kids who will be just as addicted as we were back then. But Classic won't be free to play, which is a huge deterrence nowadays. Even back then, I had problems convincing my friends to join me on my adventures, because they couldn't afford it or their parents didn't like a monthly fee. And today, there are so many free2play games.
---
(Disclaimer: I'm **not** advocating for a f2p classic, hell no.)
---
And then we have the change of pace in gaming (instant gratification etc.). I mean, even installing vanilla and applying all the patches was a test of patience back then, but that'll be much more convenient with the battlenet client. I think kids nowadays will get bored quickly if they have to smash one button until a mob is dead, do that ten times until the quest is done etc., they won't last very long.
---
- Release date
---
- Pop cap (Blizz, just confirm #nochanges here so people can stop screaming for 10k pop servers)
---
- RP-PvP and Server names
---
- Beta / Stresstest
---
- How Bnet will work in classic
---
Those are the things we need more info on from Blizzard.
---
Phase 2 sounds amazing! Complete chaos like it was back in the day. All these carebears complaining about honor system with no BGs... Roll on a PVE server then.
---
Create one called GuildieBankie, a lvl 1 gnome with a secret love interest.
---
This video has done more harm to Classic than anything else. It has left us with people *actually believing* that paladins are capable of doing high amounts of damage.
---
I wonder what sort of spicy drama will come about this time. IIRC one of the guilds on my server broke the truce and opened the gate in the middle of the night and denied all but the most alert guilds their chance at the mount.
---
Timbermaw is a good choice if you have enchanting as profession
---
That is what I am counting on :D
---
Man the week I quit farming I was literally 1 pixel away from rank 10 and I pvped basically solo.
---
Imagine invading a world, genociding its inhabitants and then declaring yourself the "outcast" and " oppressed race"
---
JustOrcThings
---
My hunter wore cloth bracers for the Fire resistance, to all boss fights...
---
What about increased spawn rates and increased drop rates for quest items. This makes some quests that are viable on private servers less effective and they take longer to complete. I think you might also learn some things from the Countdown to Classic episode i linked in another comment.
---
You are all wrong. 8 days is fast AF, however not as fast as 5 days. But that does not mean 8 days /played is slow compared to the average time played to reach 60. Maybe include some context in your statements so that other people know what you mean.
---
Ours did with tfury back in the day but ain't nobody gonna have one of those for a long long time in classic
---
What is DK?
---
There will surely be some people managing it within three days and some hours (likely closer to four days). Mostly depending on how much help they will receive (think to tag and having a raid kill the mobs, etc...).
---
The experienced player will manage to hit 60 in 4-6 days. This is given a certain amount of variance because there will be many people competing for fairly limited resources, therefore - specifically on start - things might be much slower around this time.
---
And the absolute average player will likely need something like 10-12 days of raw playtime (so for the most of us that'd be something along the lines of a month in real time).
---
Players who have no experience with the game and also not friends to "boost" them through will be even above that.
---
So in total: A LOT OF FUN TIME BEING SPENT.
---
Most of this is questions you don't even need to ask. Spawn rates, debuff, pop cap, ally+horde on same server. It'll be like in vanilla, because that's what they're recreating. If they start toggle with this, the entire experience is changed.
---
In my opinion this is the best thing about vanilla, the journey, as much as the end goal
---
I hope some of you guys stream it. I'm going to be on my carebear server, but I'll open a Twitch window on my second monitor and watch the servers eat themselves as you guys go nuts in STV.
---
They sell for 45 or 49s, if memory serves
---
Go outside more often.
---
Cool. You make this? No? Oh.
---
And ret paladins are now where they belong, memes. Wait it's actually a very good thing :D
---
This is common knowledge. The workaround is: Sheep the player landing, wait, kill.
---
I'm pretty sure when they made the switch there was a period of some hours or a day where they dropped the price of mounts but hadn't increased the cost of training yet and you could get them for cheap, but I'm not sure if it really happened that way or my brain is crossing a few wires.
---
Exactly. Seems to me that the majority of the people in this sub never played actual vanilla and their basing their "knowledge" (or lack thereof) on private servers, which is woefully inaccurate and not vanilla-like at all
---
Taking time???
---
How big is the time investment for the full blue pvp set? 
---
Everybody talks about R14 Weapons or R13 Epics nobody talks about the rest.
---
It is going to be a bloodbath. Back during vanilla the world PvP battles were solely a result of no PvP systems. This time around it is different - everyone actively want to do this insane world PvP, especially because once BG's are introduced it will be gone. It is kind of a "second chance" at experiencing this epic PvP time that have been hyped up as a legendary time for PvP.
---
So yeah, it will be way more regular and probably even bigger battles than in vanilla. And way more skirmishes around.
---
Lastly, there will most likely be a lot more PvP players - well, *actual* PvP players. In vanilla most people had never played an MMORPG, many took awfully long to get to 60 and many didn't truly get into actively searching for PvP battles until BG's were introduced. This time, even people that wants to "take it chill leveling" will most likely reach 60 far faster than the averenge player in vanilla, simply because most people are better gamers and knows MMORPGs this time around.
---
It will be glorious.
---
Lmao if you're not 60 by the time the rank system is out you will be unable to level 58-60. Dad gamer morons thinking this is gonna be fun but they will be screeching when the time comes
---
If the man at the top is playing a meme spec I wonder what the rest of the guild looks like :D
---
If people clear too fast MC and Onyxia, they will have time to lvl up another character. It will also be a good opportunity to farm some reputations (for example... Winterspring FrostSaber if you play Alliance)
---
Maybe they should have never implemented Battlegrounds but only the PvP rewards.
---
I wasn’t primarily thinking of Dwarf Mage.  More things like Tauren Paladins 🙈
---
Same same.  
---
Back in the day my guild roster was roughly 50% Norwegians, 30% Swedes, 15% Danes, and then a few other nationalities. I have a lot of fond memories from that community. International (but mostly nordic) is a great mix. That's definitely what im looking for again
---
stv is entry level wpvp. The true war will happen in places where lvls 48 are. Most efficient honor grind targets.
---
Are you planing to keep it strickly Norwegian, or you mixing it up with other scandinavians? :D
---
Clearly a hunter weapon
---
Oh... /sadface
---
Pop cap, amount of servers, release date, progressing itemization, and rethinking 1.12 AV and 1.12 pvp gear in phase 2.
---
Sure as hell looks like it will be pretty sweet
---
They won't, they don't know patience anymore. They want fast action game, beautiful graphics and above all : competition so they can brag how good they are to theirs friends.
---
I have one buddy hooked, and trying to convice a few others.  
---
Still havent been back in my old guilds new discord to hang.
---
Your guild sounds perfect to me other than the fact I have my heart set on rolling Alli :(
---
This guy gets it. It makes the world extremly tense. I love it when i see the opossing faction out questing and we both taking it easier because we both think were gunna do something. I love the controling of towns forcing people out to defend their land. Ya it may slow down leveling, but it creates an amazing atomosphere. I love that guilds take control of resources and you need to counter that to take them for yourself. This game is about community and worldpvp and it brings the factions closer. To me i farm profs in the world and world pvp. It makes the world feels alive. You guys talk about "smelling the roses" and to not rush to lvl but the main thing that gets you to do something else is wpvp. You may have had 3 hours to lvl that night but half of it turn into a battle and you get others to help take it back. It felt fucking great. So i guess rather then telling the hardcore to smell the rose and not worrying to rush to max. Why doesnt the casual base take some of their own medicine and help bring the community together TO FIGHT BACK THE OPOSSING FACTION! FOR THE HORDE!!!!! &lt;3
---
&gt; Anyone who has basic understanding and doesn't constantly fuck around should be hitting around 5 days.
---
Im not saying *you* arent fast but I have played this game since closed beta in early 04 and you are full of shit. 5 days is incredibly fast. Sure people who want to speedrun through the game with a guide they found online or use questie might do this on a mage or hunter but no most people will be 8-9+ days played, if not more.
---
&gt; Great magic wands
---
i just sold some in private server for 15silver
---
It's such a great zone though. :-/
---
Using this sub as an indicator for the Classic community is a very bad idea. This sub represents the most dedicated fans, not the general community.
---
Incidentally it's exactly why if you read this sub you get the idea that "hardcore vs casual" is a serious dividing line for much of the community. Like every other game ever, hardcore players are a small minority, yet in this sub they make up a substantial chunk of the population. That alone is a solid clue that this subreddit's demographics are a poor dataset to use if you want to consider the entire Classic community.
---
Yes, they won't.
---
Esfand is Russian u tard, just look at his class/spec selection.
---
Hi, /u/berginion
---
If no, premades run rampant on low pop servers never giving the less populated faction any sort of chance of enjoying them. I had this happen first hand in vanilla and it was terrible. When battlegroups finally came out my guild and I could finally play bgs.
---
&gt;Was Vanilla WoW about the journey, friendship, and "everyday people" all playing this game together vs racing to the end and maximizing the "win factor", for anybody else?
---
That's what retail WoW is for me as well. The "journey" part is pretty short depending on how you see it though, like only a couple of days of playtime, then you have reached end game and are stuck repeating the same things over and over again until the next patch where the "journey" can continue. 
---
But end game in retail is still about "friendship, and 'everyday people' all playing this game together", as you put it. I'm playing a game with my friends, killing raid bosses/dungeons and getting loot from it. Just like I would in vanilla. 
---
I understand that not everyone has that kind of experience in retail, but at least for me the "social" part is not what I'm particularly looking forward to with classic. I already have my guild and stuff in retail. But it will be fun playing the old game again none the less, I hope a decent amount of my guildies want to play classic as well.
---
I will play on my iMac :)
---
and my keyboard
---
Sorry for such a late comment, I LOVE this map.
---
Though I think Gnomeragon is a little to green for its level
---
Somewhere around 10 days /played for your average player, down to as little as 3-5 days /played (I think the world record is just over 3 days) if you're seriously prepared and have your entire route mapped out and optimised to the max.
---
That 10 days /played is then spread out over real life days. If you're playing 12-hour days non-stop that's 20 days, for example.
---
The hardcorest hardcore players using optimised routes and playing 18 hour days from launch will be at 60 within a week. The majority of the population will be more casual and I reckon you'll start seeing decent numbers of level 60 characters after about a month onwards.
---
In my experience you usually get more money from vendoring the greens
---
I can understand the frustration, it’s the same one that is gonna get me downvoted, but that kind of stuff is what heavily adds to the feeling of a world to me. Server villains and heroes are both made during this, and a sense of community is build. You can bet I’ll be heading to STV when I’m 60 looking to protect my faction and no doubt get in to a bunch of fights. I won’t discriminate between levels either, as it’s about the RP 2 (hoping for that RP PVP server). 
---
Killing someone many levels below you was never a skill thing. Original wow was never about that (just look at how terrible we all were, even in the most Findlay remembered pvp videos. Today I’m 2000-2500 rating experience on all but 2 classes, I could wreck my old self). Retail wow with its arena needs an equal competitively fair playing field, classic does not ! Unfair fights is precisely one of its strengths to me.
---
What I intend to do myself when I’m getting fabled while levelling and there looks to be no hope of rescue is simply log an alt and level that for 15-30 mins.
---
The game will be completely ready come release (except unintended bugs, of course). They don't need to "buy time". They have been working on it for more than two years. They won't postpone "some work" after release, I'm sure.
---
What a long content rollout does buy them is money. :) The longer people play (because they can't rush through the game at their own pace), the longer they pay the subscription.
---
In the lower levels the disenchanted piece of gear is worth more than the materials you get out of it. So disenchanting is not a valid strategy for making money early on.
---
Cmd + F "Poop sock"  
---
No results found?
---
There's nothing obscure about wolfshead, even in vanilla it was common. There was an internal cool down in vanilla but one of the more popular vanilla realms didn't choose it correctly and you had players weaving shifting every other attack for the proc.
---
I'm looking for the same, but in Alliance. I hope we find our people!
---
Knees weak moms spaghetti
---
I agree and I don't, on one hand it absolutely made the world feel smaller, on the other hand nether wing drakes.
---
No fury 2h is superior pre bwl on farm. We about dw fury in vanilla, I was dw fury on bwl release. It was just not the norm and you over a grid the tanks easily as they did not know how to itemize for threat.
---
I guess they will release phase 2 a little sooner?
---
It's just the talent point. Extra attack or crit vs stun. Big game changer.
---
NE Hunters EVERYWHERE.
---
Kidding aside, i dont think the game will be of much interest to the very young gaming scene. Lets not kid ourselves, its a 15 year old game with a very slow progress level system.
---
On top of that the requirement for 60+ progress takes time too.
---
Kids want instant action and rewards today, its why Fortnite is popular because every round doesn't take long to complete.
---
Also retail has made it incredibly easy to get gear, its a shame really but also one of the reasons im so excited about Classic.
---
The rewards will feel like an actual accomplishment.
---
Pfft... your all kids. I was over 30 in vanilla! :@P
---
What kind of bikes do you guys ride?
---
I do understand them, as this is generally not how it was in actual vanilla. I mean there was wpvp of course with come camping here and there, but for example FP camping where ppl get CC'd, wait till de honorable buff runs out and then gank them and all that jazz is generally behaviour that came to effect on pservers. All in all wpvp in actuall Vanilla come 1.4 was a very different beast than wpvp is on pservers. And i can very much understand that some, maybe even a lot of ppl do not want the pserver experience. 
---
I do reckon though that how this exactly will unfold will fully depend on the realm caps that Blizzard is going to follow. Orignal caps and it might turn out to be pretty Vanilla 1.4 like, if they will go towards pserver caps it will most probably be a pserver like experience.
---
Forget about fancy youtube videos
---
Great to see this many vikings hyped about Classic!
---
Getting lowkey tired of all the shitting on PvE servers.
---
I leveled on a PvE server in Vanilla, and PvP on a pserver. I had no real memories of ganking while leveling when I joined a pserver, and STV has always been my favorite zone. Thus, I entered gleefully at level 31, only to fifteen minutes later let out a defeated sigh when I got ganked for the sixth time by a level 60 priest running around putting dots on everyone. And that's the opposite of fun.
---
Now don't get me wrong, I realize that PvP-servers can create some unique moments (like a level 60 orc running up to my then 34 dwarf in STV, nodding, and then riding off, only leaving me with a minor heart attack). But it's different strokes for different folks. I personally don't enjoy being slaughtered all the way through leveling and spending a much longer time corpse running. I realize others see it differently, but to me it just seems like a different way of "It's better because it's hard" elitism that is incredibly toxic throughout gaming culture.
---
I personally think they'll change some stuff around.
---
1: Extend to 5 since this is the biggest phase, people need to get to 60 and then there's MC to get on farm. 
---
2. Definitely needs shortening, 4 months is too long with just two bosses and basic wPVP for everyone who's already in MC gear. I'd say 2 months.
---
3: Extend to 4, both BWL and Battlegrounds in one patch is big.
---
4. Shorten to 3, again ZG is a catch-up raid so the dragons and AB aren't going to keep the top players busy for 4 months
---
5. Shorten to 4, mostly so that...
---
6. .. this can be extended. I firmly believe that if Classic is successful they'll be working on TBC servers by now, so if we assume it's 2 years after Classic launch it would give the top players 6 months for Naxx. Those who want TBC can copy/transfer to the F R E S H servers and those who want to stay can stay until they've beaten Naxx into the ground (then reroll).
---
Irrelevant
---
I hope it’s more than the vanilla cap, from my personal experience on private servers and vanilla in 2005 I personally think 2.5k is too low, 10k is too high
---
&gt;Seems there isn't the smoothest experience going on with Classic WoW or Warcraft 3 Reforged
---
Damn son where did you pull this silly conclusion from.
---
Maybe release a fresh classic realm at 5 and when tbc launches?
---
Where did they land on with Spell Batching? I have been out of the loop for a few weeks.
---
my man. I feel you.
---
His point is there is always flourishing world pvp wether or not there are bg’s
---
No lol.
---
Level 48’s still give honor at 60?
---
I believe in Outland and Northrend flying mounts are key, alot of those zones are designed around flying, perfect example is Storm Peaks. But flying was a bad idea for the design of Kalimdor and Eastern Kingdoms.
---
This manual wasn't even accurate the first time I installed the game. Was so hyped to let my druid wear a fancy spear, till i realised polearms and spears were combined together and they can't equip  it...but rogue was more fun anyway xD
---
Hi, /u/Need2LickMuff
---
Most likley, but your ping Will be a bit higher depending on where u at
---
This makes me hopeful that the 2str/2stam leather belt song will become popular once classic hits lol
---
Think of all the honor farming if the fortnite kiddies come over.
---
*THINK OF ALL THE DISHONORABLE KILLS FARMING IF ALL THE FORTNITE KIDDIES COME OVER*
---
I dont see why not.
---
I think if they do fresh vanilla it'll be months after Naxx. Seems weird to start new servers when there's still new content to come on the existing ones. Going forward, rolling fresh might become more of an issue but that's a different subject I guess.
---
The most dedicated fans?  90% of this sub hasnt even touched vanilla or even a private server and have no idea what theyre talking about most the time
---
I'm not so sure because we used to do organised raids back in the day purely for the novelty and adventure.  Now people will be thinking "oh gosh but it will cost me 3 hours of leveling/grinding time! I'd rather just get my BiS bracers"
---
There'll be plenty of random pvp I'm sure, but I'm hoping it doesn't end up with too much griefing of lower levels basically.
---
I'm so hyped for STVietnam though
---
This is how I feel talking to people who play WoW today or who are excited about Classic release and weren't there...
---
Flying mounts killed world PvP stone dead. It was things like Group Finder, Cross-Realm PvE content, and Sharding that killed the community spirit.
---
A disaster. Hyperbole much?
---
All 5 NA players who get rank 13 14 pre bgs deserve it.
---
This won't affect you at all.
---
Yeah, you just need an account specific to that region.
---
I hope either you or your friends are nocturnal.
---
\#NoChanges, right ?
---
You say moving forward, I say sinking into a pit of despair.
---
This is some low quality memeing
---
For now.
---
Rank 13 gear is equal to aq40. Not blue rank 10 gear.
---
I guess NA players get around 100~150ish ms on EU servers, right?
---
Given that the honor system is yet to be released in phase 1 then I suggest you use your brain.
---
Thats great news, thank you.
---
As Minkelz said, the answer is indeed no unfortunately. I do believe that the Vanish macro miiiight be possible in the new macro system though.
---
Might look something like:
---
/cast [combat] Vanish; [nocombat, nostealth] Stealth
---
dafuq did i just read?
---
I sincerely doubt 99% of Fortnite players trying Classic will even make it to STV.
---
No idea, but most privste servers are in EU and us players play on Them fine
---
Well i hope we will be fine since most of them have a screwed up sleep schedule, we'll see.. haha
---
Private servers are not vanilla-like. They have many minor and some major inaccuracies.
---
Ah, I see you too take things in moderation
---
Lol
---
You dont have to be a dick. Smh
---
Burning steppes will still be a Battle Ground, do not expect to do the quests there. I feel like having players level up in phase 1 will take care of the biggest problems with FP ganking. It is easy to gank lower level players trying to level up but a group of lvl 60's traveling together is not so easy. 
---
I played on private server that had the same model of phase 1 and phase 2. The ganking there only made me seek out revenge and learn how to play better. If you are used to a pvp server have no fear Classic will be good.
---
I so wanted to be an out law :(
---
I'm assuming you didn't play before bfa.
---
Before bfa there was no war mode. You had to choose if you want to play on a pvp server or not when you created your character. 
---
Pvp server means you are constantly in war mode without any benefits. 
---
Pve means you were able to flag yourself pvp to fight players of the other factions who are flagged. You also would be flagged if enemy guards attacked you. It takes minutes until the flag fades.
---
You toggle pvp by typing /pvp
---
Try this: https://us-looking-glass.battle.net/
---
There was a fury movement here and there. I was raiding BWL as fury and there we're plenty of videos around with some thunderfury hype as well. Arms was definitely the more popular thing in the beginning of MC though.
---
&gt;There will most definitely be casual guilds that accept "awful" specs.
---
Yeah, but casual guilds will not clear Naxx. 
---
Anyway, the problem is not that it's literally impossible to clear all content with some memespecs. Dedicated guilds who will clear all content just often don't want to take a subpar spec when they can easily recruit a more powerful player.
---
For this? I don't mind either way. It doesn't change the game as far as I can see. The hardcore will still finish every raid almost immediately and be fully geared as soon as possible, the casuals will still not give a shit about finishing the content before the next phase.
---
Im est playing on northdale pserver. Which is france i think. I get 98ms my west coast freind gets 130 to 150ms. Its honestly not that bad at all. Youll be more than fine. Maybe if i was playing a fps id get pissy, but u should be good
---
I feel looker for them it was ok you had stormpeaks and icecrown and bc was just.its first showing then with cata you never really needed flying people.just wanted easyer travel
---
No we need more Phase 2 memes! /s
---
&gt;Raids in retail for the past few years have been extremely harder than anything in vanilla, TBC or WLK (except for buggs that made bosses unkillable ofc).
---
&gt;Adds in boss fights have more abilities and are harder to deal with than most bosses in all vanilla raids.
---
But we now have 4 different raid difficulties so that even the most incompetent players can get a shot at raiding. LFR is not harder than anything in Vanilla or TBC. Only difficult part about LFR is that no one who actually knows what they are doing plays that shit, so you end up wiping endlessly anyway because no one knows how to play the game. 
---
&gt; Raiders saw lvling as a obsticle for late game
---
Everyone saw lvling as an obstacle to late game, raiders where the only ones who played enough that it didn't bother them too much. 
---
&gt;Raiders saw a problem in inbalance between classes, Blizzard made every class equal.
---
Everyone saw a problem in inbalance between classes. But hardcore raiders where more or less fine with some classes being better than others, they just rerolled to them instead and continued raiding. It's the "casuals" who were sad that "their class" was doing badly. 
---
&gt;The reason WoW dropped subs is because a lot of those 95% didn't like the game anymore. They removed everything that's fun and have created some kind of raiding simulator now.
---
Not in Legion and BfA, and definitely not back in Wrath/Cata when people started dropping out. WoW started "loosing subs" because it was no longer massively growing, it wasn't the game every kid played any more, people had moved on to league, minecraft, and whatever popular games came after those. 
---
Currently in WoW, and I believe for the past few expansion, you have two games in one. One is as you say, a "raiding simulator", with mythic+ being added lately in a similar vein. Then you have another game which is pretty much a dress up/collecting simulator. Which is what is commonly seen as the game that most WoW subs is playing, maybe dipping their toes into the easier raiding every now and then. Looking at patch/expansion announcements the latter half of the game is clearly also what is given most focus. So I really don't see why you think it's only a "hardcore raiding game" now. Raiding and M+ is in my opinion the only good parts of the game left, I can agree that far, but Blizzard is putting way more effort and focus on other parts of the game.
---
If WoW can stay above Fortnite on Twitch indefinitely, it might begin pulling a few away. But that won't happen. I give it 1 week tops.
---
This is usually the case even on an old server. Mainly because crafters can spam craft the cheapest greens in each disenchanting level range possible and then disenchant them for the materials if there is any profit to be made. There are some low vendor value item slot gear like wrist, waist, and gloves that are more profitable to disenchant than the crafted items but generally disenchanting random stuff isn't very lucrative.
---
Nah just a night elf hiding with their racial.
---
Reach level 40-45 so I'm done in the second week. Then gear my character for phase2.
---
When I reached 60 I started another toon. End game? What is that? Give me more STV vietnam
---
Well, we won't know until it happens, but I don't think people will be thinking they rather grind like that. Especially the fact that the pre-BG experience is a *limited* "event" will make people prioritize getting some time for it. It's psychological, a limited offer will cause people to do it. Heck, it is the reason I will do it. If I knew it stayed like that for years I'd rather just gear up first, then go PvP, but I know that once BG's hit it will change everything so I have to make the time before that.
---
Sure, many will probably want to get a lot of pre-raid BiS, but I think most will divide their time between BiS farming and doing fun things like this.
---
Agreed on STVietnam, though. I love spending half my leveling time doing PvP and on a server fresh there won't be level 60 griefing.
---
im getting 100~120ish ms, playable i guess, ty man
---
Phase 2 will be a disaster, the tryhards will mercilessly camp anyone and everyone, often with a numbers advantage.
---
You'll maybe get 1% good encounters and 99% ganking lower level or lower geared players during this rank.
---
We're both dick wagging. Also it's been a day, where your stats at? 
---
&gt;Hopefully for you one day you'll understand how to make proper and meaningful statistics and understand how guys like tipsout are just making people think whatever they believe.
---
as a reminder so we can compare
---
&gt;No matter how hard you believe it, and whether anyone has a better analysis or not, tips analysis is worthless.
---
Here's a fun exercise. Tell me what the sample size should be. The exercise should be easy since you're so well versed in stats. :) (bonus: tell me what beta is and the confidence interval you used.)
---
grind beasts
---
This.  
---
This is a game people, if you aren't having fun, why the fuck are you playing?
---
yeah true we'll have a wee while before lots of people start hitting 60.  its funny really i used to hate leveling but these days its the most fun part for me.  getting random ass gear, looking like an idiot, chopping down any enemies you come across and hiding from the bigger packs.  its just a good laugh!
---
Pot meet kettle
---
E3 would be interesting
---
Take time of work. Still set allarm at 7:00. Do some yoga, breatfast and shower. Play from 8:00 till 23:00 with some short breaks. 
---
Repeat till 60.
---
Just remember that if you want to be Main tank you have to be experienced and somewhat vocal. If not you can always be Off tank. If you have any doubts if you can be dedicated you would not go for tank, since you are the Core of the raid.
---
Or loser
---
During phase 1 there are no ranks or rewards. Everything is for fun.

---
I assume it will be part of some already planned Q&amp;A livestream.
---
I hope it's a ways down the road. TBC was what killed WoW for me :( Haven't played since its release.
---
I don't mind vanilla class/spec balance that much. But I agree. Design wise the honor system is terrible for both casuals and competitive players.
---
Problem is: Classic isn't about making a better WoW. It is about recreating vanilla. Retail WoW itself is broken beyound repair in the sense that it will never recover from all the anti-MMORPG features like cash shop, achievements, transmogs, flying mounts, streamlined classes, terrible lore and added races etc. The only hope would be that Blizzard re-learns what made vanilla WoW great and builds something from there win an entirely different game.
---
Would love that!
---
But E3 is a whole 2 months away :'(
---
I did the exact same thing, are we the same person? 😂
---
That's a really drawn out way to say that it's impossible to reach lvl60 in 48 hours :P
---
TBC
---
Yes it was the death of wow. And dailies.
---
Because dude, sure the gear is great, but only a handful of people per realm will have it. 
---
I would get you, that there will be more raids out there with multiple legendaries, than there will be with multiple rank 14 players.
---
Hire people to help her out and be nice to her. That way she thinks the world is filled with nice people. Also ask for some stuff she farmed like cloth or meat and act super excited about crafting banages or  cooking food. Hype is contagious.
---
I think in original vanilla there were probably a decent number of people confused as to what paladins were actually going to be endgame.  When they thought paladin they didnt think healing bitch, they thought "take my righteous fury" bitch.  WC3/EQ/most RPGs had a bit of a disconnect from the vanilla WoW paladin and the fact everyone "should" have leveled as ret didnt help.  Normally paladins were just tanky warriors with a few holy spells sprinkled on top.  Not priests that happened to wear plate(or cloth because better +healing yo).
---
Why not blur the game key?
---
E3 would put us in June. Two months before my guessed release date. Seems a little late but it wouldn't suprise me.
---
It's fine if you want to bring a ret, but just be prepared to piss off alot of your warriors. It can create drama. Ret literally brings nothing unique. Boomkins at least bring a crit buff and shadow priest give warlocks more dmg and help top off the party they are in.
---
I haven't heard that intro music for SO long! Hyped.
---
Calm down grandad you might bust a hip.
---
Fifth day from launch you can expect people to hit 60. Maybe even sooner. 
---
Also MC clear in 2nd week can be a reality. Should not be unreasonable to see a guild with 6 days played average and 12 hours a day for its members. It would depend on server launch day, 2nd or 3rd reset.
---
Imagine they just don’t announce it? And it never comes out? It was actually an elaborate joke
---
I wish I could do that, heh.
---
IMO problem with releasing server list too far in advance is then everyone plans to play on specific servers.  You will have ghost servers from the start of the game and the majority of people all packed on a few specific servers.  Its a Lose-Lose situation.  Do it last minute and most people will just pick a random server and it will lead to a more normal distribution.
---
Week one? Fuck all.
---
Actually, thats pretty much my entire 'plan'. Bumble my way to 60 doing whatever and however I feel on the given night. 
---
Even if it's running away from spiders or getting lost somewhere, I really have zero plans at all. Gonna take is as it comes.
---
Except berserker rage has a longer cooldown than most fear mechanics in raids. Plus the more dwarves you have, the more dps classes you can ward, especially rogues that can't break fear, which results in a massive dps gain for your raid. If a rogue gets feared into a Nef cleave he's dead. Fear Ward is very, very strong and the stigma is legitimate.
---
no, its not worth it, it rather eats your money, low level enchnating mats don't cost much at all, its much more profitable to vendor stuff.
---
I remeber i tried to do something like that, and ended up having no money even for spells and food. 
---
disenchanting is profitable only for some specific higher level items which mats are used for a good enchants. 
---
so de'ing green and blues items 52+ is worth it (not weapons). And lvl42-45 blues since you get small radiant shard which is used for minor speed boots and fiery weapon enchants.
---
46-50 blues give large bril shard which is decent aswell.
---
so ya everything else is pretty much wasting your money and is better to vendor. especially weapons.
---
Blizzard have no real E3 presence.
---
Classic-specific Q&amp;A stream with the date and beta info as the big news.
---
I hope there is enough time between phase 1 and 2 for this to not be as much of problem
---
I’m going to camp the shit out of those min/maxer
---
&gt;basic understanding
---
&gt;5 days
---
Pretty sure you don't understand the definition of the word basic.
---
Are there going to be a bunch of people with less than 5 days played even without dynamic respawning and other private server shenanigans? Sure
---
But those private server levelers are a minority and will be spread out across different regions and servers. In fact, just like what happened back in vanilla  a lot of those people are going to be standing around being pissed that they can't do MC for the first 2-3 weeks because tanks aren't geared and healers aren't 60 yet (unless all the PS people decide to roll on the same server, which I found doubtful) 
---
Look. It's fine that private server players have a hardcore approach to the game. Enjoy the game however you want it. But don't spread bullshit that makes it sound like someone who hits 60 in less than 7 days doesn't have a basic understanding og leveling.
---
Yea it’ll work. Want to play with the master race huh
---
But there's no honor points in phase 1? So less people will bother camping FPs.
---
/r/whoosh/
---
I got my ex gf who hated games addicted. She finished with full t2 as a druid before tbc ruined the game for us. This is how I did it:
---
Made a main and an alt. I would level the alt with her to keep her leveled. I think she got really hooked at around lvl 20 and experienced DM.
---
No RP-PVP is a huge shame. I want to have access to all game content, so not having the server option available is very disheartening. Got a few friends that wont be coming back without dedicated servers :(
---
I’ve been trying to get my wife to start classic aswel when it lauches.
---
Probably play 14 hours a day and see how far I get while I'm off work. I'm not racing to 60, still want to do every dungeon at least once, but I'm not messing about either. I think I should be in my 50s after 7 IRL days.
---
#afewchanges
---
Nope. Server setups including launch day and populations are the second biggest '?' atm, next to a release date.
---
One of the last major talking points still unanswered.
---
I feel like flying should have just been limited to very specific zones where it made sense.
---
So you can skip silver as well? Because that’s the real grind.
---
Is there any other kind?
---
Or, don’t talent, and just 100% need Power word: shield and demo shout for threat. Back in 2004, that’s how you ran dungeons. I’m 2019, no one wants to sap.
---
They'll just make an anonymous post in this sub
---
Sit and fish in the tiny lake in TB
---
Its the level youre at once youve done the most linear zones, stepped into a couple dungeons, and got some big abilities. Then it starts slowing down. Its not an extreme grind afterwards but some people just won’t enjoy it as much as we do.
---
Hi, /u/Larkonath

---
There are 7 runes you need to extinguish, so either 7 members need to honored with the Hydraxian Waterlords and finish the quest that enables them to buy the single-use Aqual Quintessence\[1\], or 4 players need to be revered for the Eternal Quintessence\[2\].

---
This is me for the first 4 seconds after waking up
---
I love that there are so many peope planning to play this game that we dont even see.
---
IMO best way for them to handle it is to do a "stress test" of generic servers about 1-2 weeks pre-launch (no beta) on a weekend.  From this they can tell with decent accuracy how many people will be playing on launch.  Then release server list less than a day before launch if at all.  The shorter the time period the better.  Why?  Because if you gave everyone say \~2 weeks ahead of time to see what servers there are and who is rolling where, you are going to end up with half the servers being dead.  Nobody is going to roll on that server that hasn't been selected by major guilds/streamers/etc except a few people who just don't care about raiding,etc.  There will be guaranteed low-dead server pops from launch that never recover.  A few hours is enough to coordinate a post on guild forums of hey we are rolling on X, but not enough time to research/conglomerate everything to all dogpile onto a few select servers.
---
IM SO FUCKING HYPED!
---
Why tb specifically?
---
&gt;Whats the point of killing someone if they are worth no honor?
---
Wut...  are you fucking serious?
---
Girlfriend is hooked. Im good.
---
Why 40-45?
---
Entirely depends on the server. Some were notorious for being heavy on the WPvP scene while others you barely had anyone doing it.
---
Doesn't matter how much time it takes, as it will always be a problem. Bgs are needed to take industrial honour farming out of world pvp. Becaus that can only detract from wpvp as a whole.
---
I hope they will shorten the phases. I can't imagine most players will stick around for 8 months of boring MC farm and no battlegrounds. That's just way too long to gate crucial content out of the game.
---
Naxxramas in two years? Who will still play in 2 years realistically? Players habits are very different from 2005-2006, I don't think sticking to the exact same timeline would be a good plan nowadays.
---
Jeg bor I Danmark nu, does that count?
---
Even tho I'm English, I used to run a guild with about a 70% scandinavian population. Amazing times.
---
Because that's about the halfway mark time/XP wise to 60.
---
Gotta have that Hand of Rag to cleanse heathens. Paladon Police force represent!
---
I think Blizzard does nearly all there "Summer" releases late august / september though.
---
Take 2 weeks of work and play 15 hours a day levelling as quickly as possible.
---
Cool cool was just curious 👍
---
Always awesome with a huge WPvP event once in a while
---
Sure. It wont be fast but it’s doable.  Be sure to log out in a inn to fill your rested exp.
---
&gt; Battleground reps are the only real rep grinds that people go hard after. 
---
That’s not true at all. Every raider has AD exalted and if you’re a guild crafter, Thoroum Brotherhood exalted. Some go for Cenarion exalted, but that depends on class and/or how much you need Nature Resist.
---
They have 1-2 elixirs that they benefit from, and other than that it's "just" mana potions and runes, which other mana users also use along with their remaining consumables
---
Won't be fast? More like napping turtle speed.
---
Yes it totally possible.  
---
However, it would take you alot more time to reach level 60.  
---
The time you reach 60, BWL has been cleared with others Tanks, and you will be forgotten, i gues
---
The quest XP is accurate. It's things like procs that are just guesswork.
---
Love it, can't wait!
---
There is no boosted xp on a good private server.
---
It had better be a "comes never." The only time I could support it is several realms have low pop and not enough pvpers, in which case they could band some of those together for bg's - but leave the high population servers with healthy pvp communities alone.
---
What I mean was, was those particular locations a total war zone?
---
Haha, "even if slower"? It's going to be orders of magnitude slower. Possible? Sure, but there's very little point. You can still get plenty of practice in doing each dungeon a few times and questing/grinding the rest.
---
Why do you want to avoid PVP if you're rolling on a PVP server..?
---
Roll on PVE server then, idk what else to tell you based on your assumptions. I on the other hand think that P2 will be fun.
---
Dishonorable kill
---
I'm expecting a cinematic with the announcement
---
If you want to avoid world pvp, just roll on a pve server ?
---
Not sure, but i think an APEXLegends style would be great.  
---
Don't announce it, just release it, without any communications.
---
That way you minimize the people who actually take work-leave for it, and minimize server stress.  
---
People who want to play classic, will be playing it anyway.
---
The weekend after that will be massive :D
---
I'm thinking people are overreacting to this. It's, not gonna be that bad, players will min-max the system and also if you dont like the borderline grief pvp then come play on a pve server with me. Too many people buy into the "pvp was only true wow" meme.
---
Boomkins are perfectely fine with AQ gear.
---
You never level as one though.
---
Couple of dungeons, you mean 1 as alliance? :D
---
Man I played casually for like 4-5 months and never reached 60 until TBC came out. Leveling was damn long, but boy, I remember those days of leveling now better than I remember anything else from following expanaions
---
Ok now this is older than my reddit account
---
Take long weeking off from work. Hoping it releases on thursday, so i can play from thirsday till sunday eve.  
---
After that, just normal playing WoW  few hours every evening. and max in the weekends #NOLIFE !
---
Depending on when phase 2 hits, level the fastest as I can to 60. Was 53 when honor system landed back in vanilla, you don't want to be in that position, it's fun for the 60 not the leveling folks.
---
Riiiight. In vanilla, we used shitloads of consumables too, and we did not even managed to fully clear naxx (only 12/15). Flasks was mandatory (no flask, no 
---
Only/nef head buff was kept for naxx, but we did not push the vice to farm plants in felwood.
---
However, juju’s potions, rules were mandatory too.
---
Initial op is delusional
---
ye sorry, that's it
---
Most people will tell you that grinding dungeons for xp is a waste of time. Typically if you pug a dungeon with random classes/people you’ll level at 1/3rd the speed of just solo questing(or slower) unless you’re only doing the dungeon once for the quests.
---
That being said, you can make it somewhat efficient if you get a team together to speed run dungeons. A group of warriors and rogues with a shaman healer for windfury totem could blow through dungeons quickly enough to maybe be on par with questing speed.
---
Yeah thats def playable dude. It's a rather slow paced mmo, you won't notice it that much.
---
That is such a stupid response. I live for pvp, but I've seen the effects of this system first hand and I understand the pitfalls of it. Being forced to camp randoms in world for ranks for 20 hours a day just isn't a positive experience for anyone. Wait and see, the dominant faction on each server will grind the other into dust and we'll see a lot of very imbalanced servers, unless the p2-3 gap is relatively short. Any longer than 50 days is a change from vanilla in itself.
---
This won't be what you expect, epic raid fights everywhere, it will be small groups of geared 60s on both factions avoiding eachother and camping choke points with a lot of traffic.
---
Jead people
---
It is. What happened is I accidentally replied to *your* comment and not the comment replting to yours by /u/picnicstaggs:
---
&gt;Is that the expected /played to 60 at launch?
---
Sorry about that!
---
No particular reason other than TB being a nice place to chill
---
That 10 days /played is then spread out over real life days. If you're playing 12-hour days non-stop that's 20 real days, for example.
---
The hardcorest hardcore players using optimised routes and playing 18 hour days from launch will be at 60 within a week. The majority of the population will be more casual and I reckon you'll start seeing decent numbers of level 60 characters after about a month onwards and after about 3-4 months you'll have a mature server where there's a substantial number of 60s and the endgame is active even at a casual level.

---
We had an English player in our Scandinavian guild. Steve was a soft warrior who liked to fish.
---
A Tauren riding on a kodo around most major cities, banging the drums of war. From there  the news would spread using smoke signals.
---
I have seen people say that spriest is better in some regards but I just don't see it.
---
Spriest isn't desired in premades, lock is, spriest gets destroyed by viper sting and there isn't anything you can do about it (hunters outrange you and you have no poison dispel). Spriest has only melee damage reduction (inner fire and sform) where lock has 30% flat+ MD bonuses as SL, their silence CD is longer and their only CC is on a long CD, range on MF sucks, MB has a cooldown and no ruin boost means your crits suck. Huge mana problems mean if you get locked out of shadow you need to switch to holy but trying to go in and out of Sform is expensive and you already have mana problems. 
---
Really other than dispel, PWS and very occasionally mana burn (which could all be done just as well or better by a healing priest) I don't see many upsides to playing one in pvp compared to a lock.
---
1v1 I don't see how Spriest stands a chance in hell short of the warlock being PVE spec, Insane blackout RNG, or using engineering when the lock has none. SL vs Spriest though you can easily have 30% damage reduction and 100 shadow resist without even really trying as a SL lock, and the best part is its completely undispellable (SL,MD, tier pieces etc,) + shadow ward, + spellstone, + MD + demon armor (most of which can be dispeled but you can't dispel yourself and the enemy at the same time and dispel isn't cheap to cast as a priest.)
---
Then you also have the problems of trying to gear as spriest, raid spots are hard to come by.
---
None of this is bashing Spriest, I have even been considering maining one on vanilla release just for a change of pace. They seem like a fun class but I don't see how objectively they would even be close to as effective as a lock at dps, they bring dispels but so do healing priests, now admittedly having a hybrid sounds like lots of fun in random bgs, but I think if your going full tryhard then spriest loses out in just about every metric.
---
Key is used long time ago
---
The subject was brought up during one of the classic wow pod cast interviews (I think it was with John Staats). Basically, Blizzard wanted paladins be a sort-of hybrid class that would be both swinging a big 2h hammer in raids as well assisting with some healing. Basically a jack of all trades. What ended up happening though was that players quickly realised that paladins was one of the most efficient healers basically nullifying all other roles in favour of healing.
---
**Jack of all trades - Apprentice in many, but master in none**
---
That would depend on the server
---
I tend to enjoy the shit shows even if they make the experience a bit crap. But i agree that it will get old after like a week.
---
Kinda like how 1.1 stat MC loot was interesting for the first clear until you saw that 90% of the items were worthless.
---
I think it would be fun having one week be honor with no bgs but have WSG ready for when people start to stop logging in.
---
I think they should test the waters but be ready to kill it once the inevitable happens.
---
The outrage from missing the release and being late to the party would be even more massive
---
Hate this idea. The release of a new expansion for wow has always been an amazing experience that so many and even potentially myself will miss if they do this.
---
I know, I'd consider myself lucky if my guild picked me over someone else to get it. A lot of people in those guilds will probably want it.
---
Theres my [kind](https://prnt.sc/n9icxj)
---
So if it's a PVE server, does that mean you can level in STV without being attacked by opposite faction? As long as you don't flag yourself?
---
Yeah i was thinking of working on fishing but I wasn’t sure if there would be an area that had the most valuable fish to maximize profits
---
I will always say PvP. PvE servers would just feel like I wasnt getting all that I could out of the game
---
Yeah instead of trying to make a good or even playable game they are just trying to go full authentic no matter what the cost. The ss tm battles happened only because of ignorance and novelty, not because of lack of bgs. They will not happen again because the best way to get honor is to camp flight paths. The way honor works is that the worse ways are not just worse, they are total waste of time. This will be very bad and either the devs are ignorant and don't have a goal of creating playable game.
---
No they're not. See:
---
https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?issue=11987#comments:id=45873
---
It's been proven again and again that many quests simply don't have correct values, and there is no way to know which quests are correct and which arent. A lot of the quests used TBC experience, not vanilla experience.
---
I think a lot of the people who maybe just played on 1 or 2 private servers don't really know how the sausage is made. Private servers got a lot right, and a lot wrong. Most of the time they got as close as they could, but it was still based on guessing.
---
To say that 1-60 runs or raid clear times count on private servers is silly.
---
Rogue is more solo play friendly while Warrior excel at group play
---
How can you tell if someone is a min-maxer? :thinking: :thinking:
---
Go play PvE LUL
---
How was your warrior in world pvp? Why was it more fun than in BG's? Was it cause it was mostly 1v1's therefor less people to CC you?
---
I'm taking the week off work getting to as high a level as possible, hopefully such that I can reach 60 before phase 2 starts, just incase the prophecies about roaming gank squads stopping anyone 48+ from questing come true.
---
Wrong
---
On which phase has T1 been changed? (the stats)
---
And will there be a change on new classic as well, or will they just add the "newer" version of T1?
---
If you're playing at launch then the ganking isn't going to be nearly as bad. There'll be plenty of people to fight back anyone who rushed ahead to start ganking.
---
Well, I don't know You, but generally speaking i'm of the opinion that you're missing one of the most enjoyable aspects of the game by playing on a PvE server. 
---
Getting ganked is annoying but at the same time fuels my lust for revenge and adds truly emergent playermade goals to a mostly static persistent world. It adds KoS lists, rivalries, hunts and player interaction on a different level than PvE allows for.
---
If you're honestly just annoyed and don't see any positive side to getting ganked you should probably roll on a PvE server.
---
Just note that speed leveling to 60 should be done for the sake of a unique challenge.
---
In terms of long term efficiency and investment it is optimal to take your time with leveling and doing *at least* gathering professions, secondary professions, grinding specific materials, gearing up in mid 40+ dungeons etc.
---
If you rush to 60 you have to do all that stuff w/o gaining experience in hindsight, which is not only overall slower but also more expensive.
---
An efficient leveler who takes around 2 days more (6-8 days instead of 4-6) will have more gold, maxed out professions, better gear (for all roles and purposes), higher reptuation in key factions, will be more socially networked though dungeons etc.
---
You'll see in time. I hope my concerns are misplaced, but all my experiences over the years in vanilla have led me to this conclusion.
---
My PC is like 8 years old because I only play CS:GO, might just upgrade it for classic WoW.
---
Verycoolguy and his YouTube channel SatansHeteroFather obviously
---
TBC did a whole bunch of things that changed the nature of the game forever, so it's pretty unfair imho to act like flying mounts singlehandedly ruined wow. I think it was a bad idea overall though, as muvh as the maps were designed around them in clever ways.
---
Can't wait to roll on a PvE server

Because she wants to play now! Figure strike while the iron is hot.
---
Yep
---
This, i want to add that it depends a lot on how much spells you buy too, spells is where most of the gold goes to while leveling. Just buy the necessary.
---
Depends what you are looking to get in return from your time invested. If you want to progress your character steadily without many changing factors, go play on PvE realm. If your aim is not steady, guaranteed progression but wild, random experiences give a PvP realm a shot. You can achieve both experiences on both realms but the chances are different.
---
If its before October 2019 i'm good as well!
---
Like everyone, you’ll pex... not everyone at the same speed but definitely everyone will still pex during the first week.
---
Reputation grinding will come waaaaaaay later.
---
Pvp will start even if you don’t chose too, at least on pvp server and this, from lvl 18-20 to lvl 60.
---
And gold farm makes no sense before lvl 60 or before your professions are high enough
---
Or fishing in STV during phase 2.
---
&gt; Those lame tryhards will be stuck on Lucifron while the REAL Vanilla players clear Naxx 
---
I'm gonna need a source on anyone claiming this, chief
---
the manual is what 1st led me to playing a pally, loved it, no regrets...till i found out when i was nearly 60 that if u wanted to raid you had to heal...
---
WR pace is just under 5 days /played, for now.
---
Might be the best answer
---
4 strenght, 4 stam, leather belt? AAAAAH, level 18? AAAAAAHHHHHHH
---
Trust me people will be making gank squads and it'll be both infuriating and awesome.
---
That might be true but it is not the only thing it will bring and it will last only for Second Phase.
---
What you can do however, is desenchanting until désenchanté does not provide you skill point anymore. Then and only then, use the materials
---
I'm not so much set on her trying Retail vs Vanilla, as much as just wanting to set her up for the best new player experience. So that come Summer, she's keen for Classic.
---
I've no issues with PServers, but maybe I'll have her start on my Retail account.
---
With a dedicated group with a working setup, it’s not that far off. But that requires five people and it also requires picking classes based on dungeon kill speed. 
---
It works wonders from level 30 an onwards on horde side. Get a shaman for wf totem, 3xwarriors/rogue and a mage. Cleave down everything. 
---
Especially good for overcrowded servers. This is obviously not faster than regular leveling. It’s also harder to pull of efficiently after mara since you only have ST to work with until you’re high enough to start grinding BRD, which has a significant uptick in mob health and damage. 
---
All in all I’d say don’t do it, even under perfect circumstances. What I do recommend though is farming SM armory and cath this way if you have a group setup and you’re playing on horde side. Not like I’ve done the math, but I’m pretty confident farming those two with a wf melee group is at least on par with solo leveling as a mid tier leveling class at 36-40/42
---
Also good chance for decent items to sell as a way to farm gold.
---
An answer from someone that played vanilla as a Rogue and watched a couple sword rogues do very well.
---
\&gt;Phase 2 will be mayhem/chaos/skeletons everywhere
---
If you aren't planning on murdering everyone despite what phase it is, you should be on a PVE realm.
---
That is the beauty of it, text is well written and sounds amazin, but in reallity things work different. And because of that i saaid use your heart, not your brain :)
---
Theeeeeeeeere!
---
If you dislike pvp you can just roll on a casual server
---
I agree with your take on things. Definitely not trying to speed-level her way through things.
---
But I'd rather get her playing now than "this summer". I'll chat with her and see what she thinks!
---
That I wont disagree with.
---
Wouldn't no penalty just encourage it for the lulz even if there is no reward?
---
Stranglethorn Vietnam, love it.
---
I think that pserver experience with tryhards != classic experience. The tryhard casual ratio will be much smaller
---
i will have 2 weeks of work. i will put in all the time i have to level. dont rush it in particular, but i will have lots of /played, so i will end up 60 in the first two weeks. i guess i will need around 8 days /played. after that i will farm rep / money / dungeons. first i will farm dungeon to get  good gear and besides gold. then i will farm rep and besides that farm gold. first thing i will buy will be epic mount.
---
PVE and flag. You can be attacked. If you don't like it, don't flag.
---
PvP, people who plan to play on PvE server @classic just to not face any competition should stay in bfa tbh.
---
I know people on reddit don't have amazing reading comprehension abilities, but I never said that.
---
You keep forgetting that in Classic WoW there A LOT OF things to do apart from raiding.
---
"Only my playstyle is the correct one!"
---
Yeah you definitely sound like the mature one.
---
You gave us 0 arguments about why this would be a good idea. What am I supposed to do here? Guess?
---
&gt; No one has any chance in hell of getting rank 12 without BGs out lol.
---
The thing is, the honor system is comparable so if no one has access to BGs the system is still balanced.
---
A picture of a bowl of vanilla ice cream on their Twitter with a date.
---
Isn't Phase 2 when everything is going to calm down? DKs mean no meaningful WPvP.
---
No thanks
---
My personal opinion on what I would like (obviously they aren't asking me):
---
1. Leave as is 4 months is okay.  Especially since worldPvP in phase 2 might be rough it gives people more time to level at least 1 character to 60.
---
2. Shorten to 2 months max.  There isnt much here honestly.  New bosses are cool and fun but don't add much content-wise.  World PvP is going to be chaotic but by even the 1 month mark people will start getting fatigued.
---
3. Good as is.  BGs and BWL will make everyone happy.
---
4. Shorten to 2 months.  Not much here and ZG is a side attraction for most raiders and isnt actually a progression block unless you are skipping 40-mans.
---
5. Shorten 1-2 months.  AQ40 is hard and I am sure tons of people would still be working at it at the 5 month mark.  Introducing Naxx will give people who finished AQ40 a chance and move on, and give people who are stuck at twin emps/Cthun a chance to try some lateral progression with starter bosse in naxx.
---
6. Cant wait for TBC. Lets go! (JK, but yeah I liked TBC dungeons/raiding).
---
Pretty consistently? Haha no.
---
If you do it in 4 days or less you have been practicing over and over and over optimizing leveling routes and making sure you avoid any downtime or any unecessary detours. When you say you did it in 5 days on your second 60 in 10 years Im going to call bullshit on that unless you have a screenshot to prove it.
---
*Ok, this is epic.* It's your **3rd Cakeday** EverydayFunHotS! ^(hug)
---
Agreed, that is complete bull shit. Unless you’re a mage/hunter/(priest?) and you maintain 100% focus the entire time you’re playing, with no delays or wasted time, 6-8 days played is the length of time it’ll take experienced players. People that have never done the 0-60 before should expect 8+ days played. These people on here are lying hard. Vanilla takes a lot of time.
---
Why would you say that?
---
It really depends on what the population is doing. If no one else is bothering with PvP before BGs, other than the occasional wPvP run-in, it might be relatively easy.
---
Not at low levels
---
"Forced"   lol
---
and my dirk.
---
I really cant wait to kill noobs, it happened to me when i was a noob and now i get to enjoy
---
&gt;That was fixed on the newer servers and people still managed sub 4 days comfortably.
---
NOBODY manage it comfortably. Leveling to 60 i under 4 days played and not getting mobtagged and not being logged off for 2 weeks between levels to stack rested XP takes a ton of planning and experience.
---
Other than that you are correct though. XP rates have been Blizzlike for some time now.
---
Then you get sapped and you're a goner
---
If you want to rank, yes.
---
*spams arcane blast*
---
I still have old screenshots of the whole AQ opening event with hundreds of players being in Tanaris and Silithus, Alliance and Horde and pretty much no one fought, as there was another goal ahead.
---
When the honor system was released, most of the northern zones of the Eastern Kingdoms became a warzone, but the Blackrock was relatively calm, despite tons of players entering for dungeons and raids, although the landing areas in Searing Gorge were a warzone.
---
Releases of the world bosses were calm and almost civilized, barely any sabotaging raids, who went there. First come, first serve. But I also think this was policed by Blizzard, as you weren'T allowed to interfere during the fights.
---
It really depends on the people playing and what type of situation is found on the server (e.g. imbalances between factions and so on)
---
Wasn't a thing during Vanilla... We just had large encounters near SS. Diminishing honor makes it not worth it to camp people. The mechanic encourages large fights.
---
Closer to ZG and you get Onyxia buff.
---
Their description basically fits the original RPG versions then.  Guess they just dropped the ball at implementation rather than design.
---
no sword pvp spec uses sinister strike. 
---
why the fuck would you vanish after kidney shot?
---
dagger builds are no 'assassination builds'.
---
i thought maybe this is just trolling, but it seems you really believe this shit?
---
Yeah I suck at math. Thanks for the correction :)
---
I think they should be available at all times if they also keep the old mount system. Having a wider variety of mounts with a 1000g cost adds a nice gold sink to the game.
---
I remember being able to use my original  key as proof of being the original owner of the account when I needed to recover my account after it got hacked. 
---
Your call though.
---
And that was MORE THAN A YEAR AGO! Jesus christ try and engage your brain cell once in a while. 
---
Also it was posted on Twinstar and nothing good comes from those forums. LH is not much better, but damn K fans produce some fucked up posts and mentality.
---
Why? It's an excellent gold sink which the game desperately need if they want to keep the server static post the first two years which Vanilla lasted.
---
I so did miss the judge mental know-it-all twats like you from those days. 
---
See you ig kiddo.
---
Playing Vanilla on a PvE server is like going indoor skydiving instead of actually skydiving. Like playing guitar hero instead of actual guitar, like fishing with dynamite instead of a pole. It takes what should be a painful and hard road that ultimately ends in triumph and turns it into a walk in the park.
---
What is STV without wpvp? What is getting through the UBRS entrance without wpvp? World bosses without PvP don't even make any sense. The whole system falls apart.
---
Vanilla on a PvE server is just wrong. Always play PvP. The fear of dying is the whole point.
---
&gt; HOW do you think release date will be announced? 
---
A human will let us know.
---
You mean arcane explosion?
---
I plan to gold farm in the starting area.
---
i recently played 1 char to 60 and 4 chars to 20 on a private server. i have not been ganked once at a fp. who even said this is a thing???
---
Pserver experience I think is more in line with the classic experience than some may expect. Certainly more in line with classic than with retail vanilla - if people expect the game to be played in the same way as it was in 2004-2006 then they're in for a rude awakening. The pserver meta will filter through to returning players and those coming from retail.  
---
It only takes 50 rankers in the world to make the game a living hell for a more casual player, I've seen this happen before. The best guild/guilds on each server will all be looking to do this, particularly when you consider that they're going with the 1.12 rewards. Any remotely hardcore guild, and every server will have one or more of those I expect, will highly encourage ranking.
---
Or grammar skills, eh? We all make mistakes

---
Yep, not far off mine, I think we have fairly sensible ideas all-round. Again, makes no difference to me, I'm going to be one of the players that'll always be ahead of most but even if I run out of stuff to do I'll be plugging away at an alt.
---
This genuinely made me laugh out loud. It far too accurately describes my plans this summer. I finally have a job with paid vacation and I'll be using it for the launch of classic.
---
Yep. You'd want to be ahead of the zerg if your plan is to rush to 60.
---
Level as fast as possible to 30. I definitely want to take my time and enjoy the game, but I'm too familiar with all the areas before then. Paladin is also boring as all hell before then (and after that really until late game). Plus Scarlet Monastery opens up which means I can farm Armory until the end of days trying to get that sweet Herod loot.
---
Personally I’m looking forward to being 60 within two weeks and when phase 2 rolls out, being able to help my still-leveling guild and faction members out in the world, and I’m sure I’m not the only one. Obviously there will be camping and the sorts, but there will also be moments where some random person from your faction saves you and it builds a sense of community which is one of the pillars of classic and why it is so cherished.
---
So what exactly do you mean by casual? By far most people in private servers are casuals if the word means someone who doesn't play much. Farming some herbs once in a while and raidlogging for instance is super casual. Yet such a player would have more character progression than almost anyone in 2005 who had 10x more time spent in the game. 
---
I think you mean someone who goes out of their way to avoid meta, I.E. a scrub.
---
I disagree, and here's why. Large scale pvp your honour is split between everyone in your raid, 40 vs 40 you'll get little more honour than killing a solo player - and one takes far less effort while often being cheaper (no FAPs/Sapper charges needed in most 1v1 encounters). Equally, repeat camping will happen regardless so long as a target still gives honour, something is better than nothing.
---
Areas with a high throughput of players, or enemy flightpaths in contested zones will yield the best honour per hour during this rank. Without question.
---
Bc ur crying about PvP. So go play PVE noob.
---
I love how it seems like 99% of people here have only played on the 2-3 big vanilla private servers, and nothing else. I've been around the private server scene a lot longer than that, played on a bunch of servers pre-nost and i'm telling you, quest numbers aren't always right. There is no completely database of quest xp that these servers use.
---
Are you refuting that or...? Do you think the quest xp we have is all accurate?
---
There's battlegrounds on private servers. There won't be any battlegrounds in classic until phase 3. The honor system comes in in phase 2.
---
That's what I am saying dude.
---
Nah, on 4chan.
---
Go warrior first.
---
Warriors can be a bitch to level compared to other classes. BUT on release there will be the very warrior friendly combination of shit loads of people to group with for quests and dungeons AND hardly any high level gankers intent on making your day miserable.
---
It's not impossible, it is everything doable if you know how to play the Game properly following the Strategy and have a better understanding of how Boss Abilities work and are related to your Class.
---
Name me a single Raid Boss , where Paladin is unable to Main Tank?!
---
**Taunt Bosses do have Ability which allows Paladin to be able to Main Tank** , ofc with the "Taunter" Offtank support (**Warriors even are using and already have their own "Taunter" Offtank support for the very same fights**) , so we are at the same boat of using 2 Tanks for the Boss.
---
okay, i didnt knew u were only talking about private servers without bgs.
---
Hopefully you will right
---
Yes, a grammatical error is definitely an equivalent mistake to calling someone out for something an entirely different person did.
---
No reason to complain. Will be plenty of PvE seevers for those that don't enjoy WPvP. I however am going to have a great time with phase 2.
---
It just boggles my mind how anyone can actually believe that "95% of WPvP are rogues ganking low levels", it's like they never experienced WPvP in Vanilla before and just make up false assumptions. In fact, it basically just proves that they haven't actually played the game before at any decent level.
---
Which is so wierd cause it seems more people want RP-PVP than RP. like 3x more
---
Because you clearly don't like PvP.
---
If you wanna raid 7 days a week, you will have to play with multiple chars anyway, soooo I guess just level all three of those classes?
---
this will be great!
---
its not impressive its kinda pitiful
---
1 week before release would be funny.
---
Everyone here would loose their minds. Lol
---
The overwhelming thing for me, is that i just see it as unnecessary. Having battlegrounds in the game does not stop world pvp from happening. If you can only queue from the battleground portals and not the bg masters then if anything it enhances wpvp. 
---
Having battlegrounds in the game would not in any way change that experience you mentioned, there'll still be gankers, there'll still be people to help, what there won't be is industrial honour farming on lowbies in every single 48+ zone.
---
I hope I'm wrong, and I hope my concerns are misplaced, but I really can't see people having an enjoyable experience throughout phase 2.
---
Holy Paladin WOW Veteran.
---
Intended region (NA/EU): I guess NA but depends on if guild fits my schedule.
---
Intended server type (Nomal, PvP, RP, RP-PvP): RP
---
Intended faction: Alliance
---
Intended raid/play times (with timezone): I work third shifts. Need to leave house by 11pm cst Thurs and Friday nights and by 7pm Saturday and Sunday nights. So I'd guess my available times are 9am-12p cst in the mornings. 7pm-11pm on Thurs and Friday nights and on nights I don't work I can raid anywhere from 7pm cst - 12p cst the next day.
---
Any priority you may have in a guild (Raiding, PvP, RP, Social experience, etc): Raiding
---
A preferred form of contact (PM, Discord link, website application): PM
---
Why don’t you just try them and get a feel for em?
---
Happy cake day
---
The moment you see this and goosebumps get over your body! 
---
We have the chance to do this right, wow classic community! Let's do it!
---
I agree that everyone should play whatever they want, but at the same time don't expect to have easy time finding a spot in groups/raids - I'm not going to invite a retri paladin just because that player wants to play that combo (I myself love retri paladins) and that way wasting everyones time by not picking someone who will deal way more damage.
---
So have I and I still think WoWGasm was the best. The latest editions of both K and ND has fixed the quest XP. I pretty recently leveled through it and I definitely noticed the difference. My /played went from like 7 days on LH to almost 11 days. Just shows how much you have to grind to make up for the nerfed XP. 
---
I'm definitely not a speed leveler tho so I'm sure those guys can push some much nicer timings. 
---
Another thing is that we haven't heard from Blizz about the quests being updated. For instance Silithus was completely empty until 1.8 and 1.9, and it is empty on the private servers until those patches. Will this be the case on Classic? It will be much easier to hammer out the last few levels if we can do Silithus, Winterspring etc.
---
One April 1st 2020 a Hunter with the name of "PlagueInc" zoned into the Ironforge auction house. Shortly after he summoned a pet with the name of "PatientZero", and pandemonium followed.
---
‘How does changing the game relate to the mantra of never changing a single thing’
---
WPvP isn't going to be gone after phase 2.
---
No, adding black lotus would be a huge hit to the economy and would make content easier
---
&gt; Bc ur crying about PvP
---
No I'm not. Not reading a word I said and insulting me?
---
What u/Cremebrulee321 said is correct. If I send that key to Blizzard, there's a none-zero chance they'll start working towards giving me access to whatever is tied to that account. People recover old accounts all the time using old game keys.
---
I love pvp, and I'll always roll on a pvp server, but camping lowbies is not my idea of what pvp is. there's no challenge in killing a level 48 as a 60 whatsoever. 
---
Saying "pve server" is kinda dumb, I don't enjoy the aspect of making rankers spend 20h/day pvping out in the world, that doesn't mean I don't like world pvp. I like organic world pvp, competition over resources, wiping guilds going to raids, things of that nature - those encounters are great and completely natural. Rankers camping flightpaths and chokepoints though, I don't see that as a good thing. Doesn't mean I dislike wpvp.
---
Yeah I was being sarcastic since war mode pretty much put the nail in the coffin for world pvp. 95% of horde leave it on while 95% of alliance leave it off.
---
In my opinion it was one of the absolute worst ideas ever implemented.
---
Right, 40 people flasked 3 times a week when there's only 4 black lotus in the world with a respawn time of at least 1h
---
especially them
---
Not lvl 60 in 15 minutes? Can’t “swipe me mum’s creditcard” for Tier 3? 
---
Think these are the questions they ask themselves just before quitting classic.
---
Ich spiele seit Classic und ich versteh's einfach nicht. Es ist so als würden euch nur die Raids, Dungeons, Battlegrounds etc. intressieren! Sogesehen ist's ja egal was Blizzard für ein neues Gebiet schafft, wieviel Liebe darin steckt etc.. Nur Raids, Raids, Raids. WoW ist so vielseitig, und ihr sagt nur weil's leichter geworden ist das WoW kaputt ist. Die Community macht WoW kaputt.
---
Healing spells take mana still (and quite a bit of it actually)
---
The game has moved towards knowing your rotation (which are far more complex than before) and boss mechanics instead of mana manageent. Except for healers who don't really have rotations so need to think about mana
---
Roll a warlock :D Problem solved (However u will end up paying more for your epic mount than any other class)
---
Honestly this is gonna be awesome
---
According to all the recent community run surveys, yes. And yet, Ion is under the impression that the community is too niche to get a server.
---
He is probably going off of Retail WoW numbers, but that's not an accurate representation.
---
Compared to 2004 launch, the community interest skewed *significantly* toward PvP compared to PvE in general. PvP just became more and more popular as time went on.
---
According to the survey of ~10k people linked in this thread, there are more people interested in RPPvP than RPPvE.
---
https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/rp-pvp-realms-reconsider-one-realm/130723
---
It is absolutely ludicrous that we're not getting a server at launch and I will continue tweeting at Ion and bumping the threads every day.
---
Nothing in Classic WoW was won without a fight. *Nothing.*
---
The only reason we're getting Classic WoW in the first place is community expressed demand.
---
That's how it was. That's how it should be. Can't change the game because you can't handle that. It's a slippery slope. Nobody is playing 20 hours a day either. Not at least until bgs come out.
---
All scandinavians are welcome really! But we are 100% sure to roll alliance though
---
Record is 4 days and 20 hours by Joana on official Blizzard server back in vanilla. PServer times obviously don't count.
---
Its funny, I play in a Scandinavian guild(primarily swedish) in DAoC and Swe and Nor can understand each other fine. The second a dane appears in Discord it turns to English
---
I actually mean someone who's not that interested in maximising their character, who doesn't have very much time to commit to the game.  
---
If you're the kind of player who has a full time job, and a family, and can play maybe 3 hours a night at best and a little more on weekends, if you spent 2 of those 3 hours being camped relentlessly by every ranker on your server, I just don't see this kind of player sticking around - and I think that's a shame, because everyone makes up the community in Vanilla.  
---
It all depends on the distance between phase 2 and 3, if phase 2 is relatively short then this problem won't be too bad, but if it lasts for several months then I can really see this having a dramatic effect on the playerbase.
---
Not exactly what I meant - the limit 1 per zone would not change, only increase ( or completely randomize ) the amount of possible spawn points, making it harder to find/camp.
---
How they are gonna deal with gold sellers, they were a huge issue on private servers, and it could make the experience less enjoyable.
---
My friend and I switch our mains for classic about a couple times a week. Just wait till character creation screen and follow your heart
---
Yeah its pretty obvious the gaming community is getting more casual and people on this sub live in a niche bubble.
---
When you read around or look at a poll you would get the impression that half the server will have a record breaking leveling time, plays dwarf priest, goes for rank 14 and farms devilsaur 4 hours a day.
---
Unless your part of the no lifer group who plans to play 24/7 on release, I think there will be a lot of lvl 60s in like a week lol.
---
No way you can compete with people who plans to play like its their literal job. Anything over like 3 hrs a day on a weekday is already beating me haha
---
&gt;  a couple nights of raiding a week is all you really need to keep pace. Throw in a dungeon per night and you're good to go 
---
Did we play the same game? Because the vanilla I remember was 2 hour Strat/Scholo/UBRS runs and 4-5 hour raid nights. Plus gold/mats/rep farming. By your schedule that would be at least 20+ hours of gaming every week, equivalent of a part time job. Hardly causal-friendly.
---
U speaketh wisely. Keep up the fight.
---
I did 6.5h on my first ever 60. That includes afking, some time on the AH scanning and doing way too many dungeons. 5-6h should be the normal for anyone with any experience come classic.
---
They were also removed for a reason.
---
It's cute that people think there wont be insane PvP in P1. Just because I wont get honor doesn't mean I wont gank everyone and everything.
---
This, but unironically.
---
Ah, ok, usually dynamic refers to spawns as soon as one is down to a constant amount is always up.
---
Yeah, idc if they randomize it.
---
Honor or no honor either way your getting killed
---
That would be a correct assumption. Blizzard realised what was happening by the time of BWL/AQ40 and thats when you also starts noticing how paladin gear starts to make more sense from a healing perspective. (T1 being utter garbage and T2 not great - albeit an improvement).
---
What are you talking about? I don't like the flightpath meta, it has nothing to do with not liking PvP?
---
d'oh
---
This guy gets its. You want community, well help create it. Im in love
---
There are addons now that have all sorts of filters to block the various gold spam methods.
---
"competition"
---
99% of encounters on a PvP server is you dumpstering someone 4 levels below you or the other way around.
---
I read everything you wrote. You should play on a PVE server because you are clearly frustrated about PVP at flight masters.
---
Put hunters mark on him when he is far enough :-)
---
Check out staysafes new video. Will answer your questions.
---
In my 14 years of playing WoW I haven't used /beg emote once. I had a spit macro in Vanilla though. ;)
---
Warrior is more skill dependable (pinpoint sunders, shouts, cleaves) and requires smart gearing in AoE threat situations.
---
As a druid you have EZ mode Swiping the mobs and can get use the same gear, but you do take more damage due to inability to block. 
---
At the very first stages druids could be a preferable option, but once warriors gear up for a bit the tables turn.
---
To be honest, you can do most 5mans even without a tank if your group has enough CC and is good at focusing damage.
---
Have you used the Logitech g600 mmo mouse?
---
The people you’re describing will rightly play on PvE servers. I suggest you do the same.
---
As a former Pserver feral/Vanilla hybrid druid I'd say Warrior for the most part, way easier time gearing up a warrior than a druid and a druid is more gear dependent than a warrior. Once you get your preraid BiS though it's pretty much fine. But then warriors just shoot for the moon in terms of gear after raids until around AQ where ferals finally get a little love. Also warden staff(lvl 40-something world epic) is literally bis until I think AQ40(?) or maybe even naxx.
---
There's even a guild on Northdale called &lt;People With Jobs&gt;.
---
There will definitely be plenty of casual guilds aimed at people with limited time on their hands.
---
Rank 7 boots and rank 10 shoulders are bis pre naxx for mages.
---
The updated pvp gear is SUPER strong.
---
What is phase 2?
---
I just got access to my old account, only information i had left was said key on my manual, 0 issues and it took about 10 minutes.
---
No, they should in this case release a fresh TBC real not ruin the progression of all vanilla characters.

---
Me! Love war, mage and rogue but was warlock and priest in the good old days...
---
That is exactly how it felt the first time I went to PvP in the barrens.
---
My plan is to do everything in every zone. I'm not rushing to end game because there really isn't any in 1.12. I'll just take my time enjoying every bit of nostalgia i can and hop into a raid guild a month or two before the first update. i jumped on a ps during blizcon and holy moly it was like my brain was coated in happiness. just so many memories from everything. tirisfall is the tits in vanilla. so heckin amazing. the rain makes you feel cold down your spine, its torrential. I would also advise anyone who never played nilla to take their time. You do not want to rush to level cap, vanilla is about the journey, it is not about end game. there was way more focus on the experience and less on content for level cap.
---
pun approved
---
the city for high levels only too, you wouldn't be in shattrah before lvl 58+
---
it was a sight to see half of your faction server in a city. then it all went empty
---
You talk as if everyone lvls up to 60 in a week and have MC and Ony on farm the day after.
---
Hi' I'm a long time player looking for a guild! I've been raiding since I started playing in Cata and I seriously want to support the vanilla servers. I want to tank because I like threat and I was pretty upset when they removed it in patch 4.2.
---
I'm really interested in tanking, because it's something I've always enjoyed doing.
---
Intended region : NA
---
Intended server type: PVP or RPPVP I don't pvp much, but I don't like running into a member of the opposite faction and not feeling fear/bloodlust.
---
Intended faction: Alliance, but I really don't care. I'm honestly 50/50.
---
Intended raid/play times : I work 3rd shift (11pm - 7am) EST. I want to raid before I go to work, so somewhere in the hours of 4pm - 10pm EST . Because of this, a PST guild is probably the best fit for me. As for my personal game time, I'll probably be playing whenever.
---
Any priority you may have in a guild: I want to raid. I want to tank.
---
I know finding a guild will be harder once classic launches. I want to Main Tank. I'm that guy who will be there every night. I want to kill bosses.
---
A preferred form of contact:PM me or reply with a website so I can apply.
---
I’ve mostly played on PvE servers over the last decade or so, but I do recall the foothills madness during Vanilla. The question is will it be epic 15 years later. Can we all be born again virgins? Probably not. But I’ll see you there anyway.
---
These are the kind of adjustments I can get behind
---
This is true only at leveling, and even though you still have fair fights, the problem is at endgame resources, you'll see that guy taking your herb/mining node, stealing your favorite grind zone and theres nothing you can do about it.
---
Oh yeah, this post is relating to the recent PvP schedule update on the front page. I am referring to private servers that have emulated the pvp progression that Blizzard is planning on implementing.
---
should be a significant difference between people running into eachother, and duking it out. VS making 40 man raids to rotate over epl, wpl and hillsbrad destroying everything for points. Camping flightmasters etc.
---
That’s true, you make a really good point. But at the end of the day it’s supposed to be as close as it can be to the original launch in terms of structure, and a part of getting past phase 2 will make the following phases in regards to PvP much more awaited. 
---
I am also worried it will devastate the casual community and as you said, without casuals the game wouldn’t function as it should, just as if there isn’t a hardcore community as well
---
I didn't say wPvP as a whole will be gone, but it will be *different*. Pre-BGs there are no alternatives, meaning anyone who wants to PvP will be doing wPvP. Post-BGs a large amount of PvP will be moved to instanced. 
---
And it is not only because of preference from the gamestyles - people farming honor in phase 2 will have no other way than wPvP, hence large scale battles and PvP raids will be somewhat common. With BGs it will be better to do BG premades in terms of farming honor. Furthermore you gain your rep that several classes will want (for example AV crossbow for hunters).
---
Queueing to a BG is also easier, it guarantees PvP action and it keeps the action going. No running around trying to find it and you won't run into being the only one of your faction against groups of the other. It is just an easy way to get some PvP, which is extremely valuable for all the players that have a job, studies, kids, a wife etc. 
---
So yes, wPvP will always be there, but the wPvP pre-BGs is extremely different. It is also a known historic period of WoW PvP, so people know about it and want to try it.
---
That retail illusion in the comments that raid guilds would 'compete' over the opening

You?

Good funnel bug shells into that guy/gal so we can open the raids.

100 RP is not even close to an entire rank
---
ye, good point, my bad , I'll edit the OP and change dynamic to random, just for clarity.
---
You are right but most of the playerbase will never make it to 60, so they will only experience the downsides of a PvP realm
---
You literally said it would be gone. Like word for word.
---
I've added that clarification. I didn't know where the 3 day record came from, I've just seen the number used before.
---
Warriors
---
You think you do...
---
It would probably be easy enough to do: just take every herb spawn point in the zone and, if one is not present already, make it a small chance that a Black Lotus spawns instead of the normal herb?
---
If you think nobody's gonna play that hard, idk what to tell you man. You're gonna get a shock my friend.
---
It's how it was in some regards, but how accurate it is depends on the length of time between stage 2 and stage 3. The introduction of the honour system was only 50 days before the introduction of battlegrounds. If the time between p2 and 3 is greater than 50 days, this is also a change. So, it's not "how it was"
---
Sadly, it's not 2005 any more, times change. If you think Classic will be played in the same way as 2005 vanilla, then you're in for another shock :)
---
Didn't really know this, but anyways that acc was only used for vanilla before many years and i don't have anything important tied to acc, credit number etc...
---
It wouldn't stay secret. NDA wouldn't help shit, *someone* would spill it anonymously and Blizzard wouldn't have the chance to find the source. So I highly doubt this.
---
Well, MC is not going anywhere. You can raid MC in a year if you're that slow to level, that's not an issue. I'm concerned about retaining the player base that plays more than one hour a week. Whether you hit 60 in two weeks or two months, having only MC/Ony and the occasional dungeon to look forward to for the next 6-8 months is not a lot really. I don't want servers to be empty and raiders to only log in for reset night past the first month.
---
The drug or addiction of choice has changed the last decade.
---
WoW gave you the feeling to be with a family. Just sitting in IF is like meeting the neighbours in front of your house.
---
The loot upgrades took a long time, but when you got them it was a meaningfull accomplishment.
---
It was like a slow but steady morphine drop or a good wine or whiskey.
---
Fortnite gives you the feeling of a seizure.
---
Every hitmarker, lootbox, achievement, winning screen... gives you a dopamin hit.
---
It is like drinking coffee made with red bull instead of water and speed instead of sweetener.
---

---
Obviously everyone isn't 12 anymore. People will be much better now. There will be many changes. Changes with how people play is fine, but minimal changes on how the game is would be preferable. I'm just saying nobody will PvP all day because it's a lot more work in phase 2. Of course people will be questing all day.
---
It will be different for sure. No way around that alone from the fact that *people are better*. Back then most people had never tried an MMORPG and in general the gaming culture were not as big. Now even 12 year olds are better gamers than many were in their 20's back during vanilla. We also know so much about the game this time around. We know builds, rotations, gameplay, tricks etc. 
---
In vanilla, at least in early vanilla (which is when the foothills madness are famously from), I'd say large scale battles were really only a select few that knew what to do, the rest were, as you put it - pure madness. People just played.
---
Now on the other hand, I think it will be much more structured. Even the worst in a full PvP raid will be able to follow commands, have a PvP build and know general PvP playstyle of their class. Actually, if you haven't already played GW2, check out their gamemode called "World vs World". It is a server vs server giant battleground that goes on continuously with only weekly resets. The big part of this gamemode is "zergs", big groups with a leader that moves around the map fighting other "zergs" and doing objectives. This is structured as hell, and even new players learn the basics in no time. You join the giant group and follow the "commander".
---
Personally I look mostly forward to not giant battles, but skirmishes. small groups fighting each other, like 5v5 and such. Pre-BGs I think it will be a lot easier to find those encounters.
---
It is doable while still having a full time job. About that hard. I don't know how much no bgs will affect that but I think no pre-mades in bgs will make it much harder but probably still within the possible with a full time job range.
---

Reduced honor, but yes.
---
If they are never going to hit 60 might aswell enjoy the game at it fullest, no? Low level pvp is one of the best things of vanilla. People that are willing to play vanilla for strictly PvE only are going to be a bit disappointed imo.
---
Lots of people will be playing 20 hours a day cause no one wants to spend the entire week farming, its nicer to have 1-2 days off than to play less each day
---
*"Ask not what your guild can do for you, ask what you can do for your guild"*
---
Classic will have 6 patch phases:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bawsup/the_complete_classic_plan_pve_pvp_phases/
---
&gt; Except berserker rage has a longer cooldown than most fear mechanics in raids.
---
Bullshit. I can't think of a single boss I couldn't tank with stance dancing. On some, like Magmadar, it was tight, but there was always enough time to use Berserker Rage.
---
&gt;Plus the more dwarves you have, the more dps classes you can ward, especially rogues that can't break fear, which results in a massive dps gain for your raid. If a rogue gets feared into a Nef cleave he's dead. 
---
Never seen a raid where Rogues get Fear Ward, most of the time the Priests put it on themselves, so they can still heal during a fear. It's a nice positive, but not a huge deal.
---
&gt;Fear Ward is very, very strong and the stigma is legitimate.
---
It's a handy tool that way too many bad raids/tanks use as a crutch, and it's not worth the insults and rudeness levvied towards literally any non-Dwarf Priest alliance side.
---
Yeah, I’m a disgrace to the horde faction.
---
People are kind of done and tired of talking about post Naxx. Nobody wants to think about it right now, we just want to play the game and think about that later.
---
You clearly can't read then. Quote from myself:
---
&gt;once BG's are introduced it will be gone. It is kind of a "second chance" at experiencing this epic PvP time that have been hyped up as a legendary time for PvP.
---
I'm clearly talking about that initial pre-BG wPvP experience. I mention it several times in my post that I'm talking about that specific experience of pre-BG wPvP. The only way that it will stay post-BGs is if no one plays BGs, and obviously that won't happen.
---
That could be the issue exactly though — similar to warmode issues in retail, where one side steamrolls the other. Still, there’s no way to mandate a fix while preserving the integrity of the original experience. So for PvPers, this is your best chance at a time capsule.
---
I don't really care about how long people play each day. Nobody does. I just don't want any changes like you were implying because it's to hard for you, but at the same time you don't want to play on PvE servers.
---
Try them all out and see what gives you *the most fun* Thats what i plan to do.
---
Yes, nobody has a gun to their head and are being "forced" in the true sense of the word to PvP. But if you think there wont be people ranking, and that these people wont try to maximize their honor/hour gain you are completely delusional.
---
P2 will be completely unplayable for anyone not ranking, and the people that do rank wont have fun doing it either. Whoever came up with this idea at Blizzard seriously need to rethink their choices.
---
Honor system with no battlegrounds in real Vanilla only worked because nobody understood the system yet. Now that people understand fully how the system work and how to maximize their honor games, implementing the pvp system with no BG's is simply insanity.
---
It's the focus on raiding.  They added Mythic (and heroic before it) to appeal to the 1% who QQd everything was "too easy".  They added LFR so people who didn't want to raid would "need" to raid but didn't have to be in guilds.
---
Truly the best war music around.

---
No I really do.
---
(I’m gonna play on a pvp server btw)
---
Imagine being mad that someone wants to play on a pve server, when it doesn’t affect you in any way. Are you ok bro?
---
Only reason I see there being less WPvP and ganking is due to the hardcore PvP players wantig to farm gear up for when Phase 2 arrives so they can go full neck beard? Idk just my 2 cents
---
You have no understanding what you're reading then. "PvP at flight masters" is not flightpath meta. When there is PvP at flight masters but no flightpath meta it's completely fine. Flightpath meta means the best way to get honor is to camp flight paths, I don't agree that it should be the best way to get honor. That is not the same thing as "being frustrated about pvp at flight masters".
---
Either is fine for anything pre-UBRS. Druids can tank UBRS but they need gear. No-one's gonna turn down a tank for Scholo or whatever cause it's a druid, probably.
---
But the original game never had honor farming on the scale we see these days because people didnt know fully how the farm worked so the top rankers could get away with much less hardcore and focused honor farming which meant there was little need to camp flightpoints 20 hours a day.
---
Additionall the original game did not have Dishonorable kills until BG's were in, so you would still have the famous Tarren Mill vs Southshore battles.
---
With no BG's and dishonorable kills being in from the start we are already deviating from the original experience in a big way and its not good for the game as a whole.
---
&gt;Nobody is playing 20 hours a day either. 
---
And this is why its impossible to convince anyone how bad no battlegrounds truly is. Because you people have no clue how people actually play the game.
---
If it's as normal then that's fine. They're pretty hard to camp.
---
Anyone got an guess on how long phase 1 will be?
---
Except getting ganked by someone higher level than you or getting spawncamped isn't enjoyable, which will be what most of your low level pvp consists of. 
---
&gt;People that are willing to play vanilla for strictly PvE only are going to be a bit disappointed imo.
---
Actually PvE is the actual game, PvP is just an afterthought from Blizz. People will be fine without it.
---
That's some top-notch advise there, thanks!
---
Well... we are quite biased in this sub since we all loooooooooooooooove the game
---
Always assume people using this argument are complete devoid of all rational thought and logic.
---
This is the sub for WoW Classic, which doesn't even have a release date yet.
---
The people on this board will (for the most part) tell you that retail sucks and you should wait to try Classic WoW later this year. They'd be correct. Retail is a dull, watered down experience now and it's hard to imagine any new players having much fun with it. But if you really want a *general idea* of how the game plays, you can play retail for free up to level 20.
---
Bear in mind, if you do, that Classic is a significantly different game and is much, much tougher, but also has the social aspect lost in retail.
---
Even if you have the most perfectly optimized route all it takes is one or two games, or high player density and everyone is looking at times closer to 4-7 days
---
&gt;You will not be able to level to 60 during that time.
---
You are going to be fine up to L52. PPl that rank will have been L60 way before stage 2 start, getting that gear from MC to PVP. 
---
Ppl say they want #nochanges and then when they get it, they will complain again.
---
&gt; Okay but you can just /ignore people who bother you. 
---
Indeed. And if you bother me in ways that aren't disruptive or socially unacceptable in an all-ages venue then I should do that.
---
&gt; Why should they get banned just for bothering you?
---
Because rather than 2500 people having to individually ignore the jerk, one GM slaps them with the banhammer once and they learn their lesson. Or become repeat offenders and get banned more.
---
&gt; Are you really that sensitive?
---
If someone is being a jerk at a party, everyone can ignore the jerk or you can throw the jerk out. Throwing the jerk out seems like a great solution if they cross the line to such an extent that the party is better without them. It's not about being "sensitive", it's about immediate and robust action to slap down the jerk.
---
Correct.
---
If you are asking whether or not to play Classic, this would be the right sub.
---
And if that is the case, the answer will depend on what version of WoW made you want to give it a try.
---
&gt;So, what's this all about? It's about the fact that we are gonna get very strong blue and overwhelmingly strong epic items available even before the BWL release(it usually +2 ranks per week if you are pushing for it, closer to the second digit ranks it slows down to 1 per week)   
---
Not really. Rank 12-13 are reallly slow and hard to get. You need to constantly famr PVP, with a team, and there will be no BG, so you're entierly dependant of the state of wPvp on your server, then there will be no mean to consistently farm honor before phase 3. WPvp is a very poor way to farm honor, as you get 25% less honor each time you kill somone in a row. Meaning after 1 hour, massive wpvp battle will earn you basically no honor.   
---
There's NO way someone get rank 12 before phase 3. I will be really surprised if someone get past rank 10.   
---
And the blue PVP set is on par with T1, evben worse for PVE, because of the lack of pve stats, like spirit and %hit.
---
Well, this is a common misconception. There was only a 50 day gap between the introduction of the honour system in 1.4 and the introduction of WSG and AV in 1.5, so the second it goes past 50 days between phase 2 and 3 that's a change in itself. We're also getting the 1.12 version of AV (a change in itself which I agree with). It's difficult using the "no changes" argument, when there's already a plethora of changes to the game when compared to the 2004-2006 progressive game. I don't think that argument can be used when it's ignored in other aspects.
---
Providing the timeframe between phase 2 and 3 is relatively short, the impacts should be minor, but if phase 2 drags out for too long - expect to see people quitting.
---
I'm an advocate for no changes generally speaking, but not to the point where it will have a negative effect on the overall game experience.
---
Oh we have a druid healer and no priest? I'll take that ret 10/10 times thank you.
---
imagine being so insecure you try to turn a mild comment into a confrontation, are you ok bro?
---
If there are no bgs can you describe how ppl will earn honor????
---
&gt;I did 6.5h on my first ever 60.
---
I assume you mean days and not hours, but no. You did not. I can tell you that much. Prove it with a screenshot, if you not you are just remembering it incorrectly.
---
NOBODY hit 60 for the FIRST time in 6.5 days it's just not possible given the scale of the game and the amount of knowledge you would need to sit on to be able to quest that efficiently.
---
Okay that's fine. Maybe some people will I'm sure. That's no concern of mine and not what I'm worried about. I'll be playing 20 hours a day, but I think most will prioritize gearing and leveling in order to dodge being camped while leveling the mains.
---
Is it any different these days? Seems like most people back then had some sort combination of Prescott P4 or amd equivalent and 9800pro or 6600gt in the classic days.
---
Any PvE Australian clans? Haven't seen any advertised.
---
You should check out Skarm Tank on youtube. He's tanked both classes at end game level.
---
Yikes
---
Nagrand would be full of [upset engineers](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/019/304/old.jpg).
---
Do you really think the same players go after AV rep rewards and lets say rank 10-14 stuff ? Reputation rewards are for everyone, those that play pvp but dont do it so much that they ever gain high ranks.
---
Those people who want worlds first high warlord will be doing whatever they can, regardless. It'll be fine. Stop listening to lame youtubers.
---
is it possible for horde to raid darnassus? i think the only way there is via the ships iirc
---
Yeah I’ve spent some time on p-servers testing out ideas. Narrowed it down to Priest - now agonizing over race choice!! Shit!
---
i don't have any knowledge of WoW. so i don't know which one is better XD
---
I leveled alliance originally and never leveled a horde until after cataclysm ruined everything. I'm looking forward to seeing the horde vanilla leveling experience for the very first time.
---
Played on LH but stilld have no idea what phase 2 is
---
They were pretty clear from the start that classic is meant to be as close to vanilla as possible, within reason.
---
It’s meant to be where people can go and play WoW as it once was, not a new start for the game.
---
I doubt we will see any post naxx content unless it’s 3-4 years down the line and classic is way ahead of retail, which despite what some people here seem to think will be unlikely.
---
What original movie is this?!
---
Still better than being Alliance. :)
---
5th of June
---
Yeah, of course it will be different, but that is not to say it is going to suck. I still look forward to it, and it might even be more fun this time around when I know what I'm doing.
---
Personally I feel like just playing the old game gives me that feeling of vanilla. I don't need me and everyone else to be bad at the game to capture the feeling, that is not what vanilla was about to me. I just need Blizzard to deliver a proper version of the vanilla game and I'll have all the fun I need.
---
This is how i feel also, despite the ganking you'll always be missing out on random world PvP which can turn in to some epic battles from just a tiny skirmish
---
Ranking adapts to people farming, it's not a certain amount of honor that you need. There will be always people reaching the top Honor point gain at the end of the week and getting 2 or even 3 rank upgrades on the next one. Not having BG wouldn't change much.
---
I’ll do whatever I feel like doing when the time comes, I don’t feel any need to over think it or plan anything.
---
What do you mean by "a lot more work"? Do you understand that ranking is completely relative?
---
I understand where you are comming from. The crucial difference between people who like PvP servers and those who don't, is that the PvP people are actively planning for and reacting to PvP encounters. That's really it.
---
I've heard your story countless times and I always wondered, why it seemed to be the same people getting ganked all the time, while I had only a few of really unfair encounters during leveling.
---
It started to dawn on me when I was helping said people. I'am usually responsive to levelers when it comes to PvP and go out of my way to fight back, except I'am in a dungeon group or something like that. So usually what happens is that I fight back, we win the fight and then the leveler(s) thank me and then just act as if nothing ever happened.
---
Well, I just traveled across continents to PvP with you and you just mind your own buisness and continue doing the same thing you did before? Guess what, the guy who camped you before will show up again, possibly with friends as well. Do I need to guard you now until the other players give up and log out?
---
From these situations I learned that people who usually complain about wPvP are simply not putting *any* effort into avoiding getting ganked or to establish dominance themselves. They just mindlessly follow their questing routes and just hope they don't get noticed, so they just get ganked and jumped all the time.
---
Even worse: They are visiting highly populated PvP zones like STV w/o grouping. If you are in your low 30s and visit that zone you *have* to at least duo level there or have a class that has the tools to pick their own fights like Hunter/Druid/Rogue.
---
For those who plan ahead and/or react accordingly to PvP encounters have much more fun on PvP servers, because they know when to switch areas/zones to avoid getting ganked, they establish dominance over grinding spots and they have fun, group vs. group encounters.
---
&gt;stop listening to lame youtubers.
---
Never have. I have an actual functioning brain and enough private server experience to understand how people will play when they rank. Honor system and no BG's will be a shitshow, and it will be very bad for the game as a whole. Im sorry you cant comprehend this, but its true.
---
Without seeing the posts you are talking about I can't say for sure but when people talk about only needing def cap for Broodlord, Nefarian, and Chromaggus the reason why is because those are the hard hitting bosses in BWL that can actually get around shield block. If you have shield block up you can't be crushed or crit because the attack being blocked prevents those possibilities. 
---
Most bosses either don't hit hard enough with their physical attacks for crits to be a problem or don't have any additional physical attacks, attack speed buffs, or stuns that let them attack enough to ever land a not-blocked hit. Broodlord has mortal strike and his physical knockback ability, Chromaggus can stun if he has bronze breath which prevents avoidance apart from misses, and Nefarian's warrior class call keeps the tank in berserker stance where they can't shield block.
---
thanks guys for your insight about pvp/pve servers but i am still struggling to decide which one i should play on ... 
---
please tell me also what u will choose ? i mean from the most reply’s i can assume what it will be but for future answers
---
yep, darkshore
---
WoW Classic will be an attempt at recreating the first version of WoW (vanilla).  
---
I'm fairly sure, that anyone on this sub will tell you that vanilla was the shit, and retail sucks. I haven't played retail since 2009, so I can't say much about WoW after that point. What I can say is about my journey up to that.
---
WoW vanilla was the best game experience that I have ever had. It gave you so many possible ways of playing. And the community was life changing. If Classic even gets close to vanilla, I can't recommend you to try it enough.
---
There's a lot of text there, but you're not very clear. What exactly is the problem you're getting at? If you're worried about HWL gear...well put it this way:
---
No honour system until P2. No battlegrounds until P3. There is no way in hell anyone is getting HWL gear through WPVP. 
---
It will take a bare minimum of 7 weeks to get HWL gear, but good luck getting that honour through WPVP. That gear won't be available until P3, when BWL will be introduced. Now consider how few people will grind to get HWL gear. Mid P3, much more people will have some BWL gear than will have HWL gear. 
---
Very few people are going to have HWL gear. It's not going to effect your gameplay in the slightest. If you come
---
across them, they'll destroy you anyways - they'll have been PVPing non-stop 15 hours a day for months.
---
The problem isn't the amount of honor, is the ability to be constently in the top people on your server. With only Wpvp, there's no way to get a constant influx of honor, then it will be really hard to be in the top 5 constantly.
---
Ok, thanks !
---
People will absolutely gank all day, I promise you that. I will be one of them, and I know many others within the hardcore community who will do the same. There's a massive minmax influence in some sects of the vanilla community, this will only intensify with the introduction of the 1.12 gear. in such an early patch - it's VERY strong compared to what else is available at the time.
---
Ganking isnt pvp, it's just being a cunt
---
Agreed to a certain point. I don't think having a main villain would exclude local conflicts. They could have had each zone or most zones having some internal conflict. And not all of the conflicts needs to be tied to the main villain. Westfall is a great example. That whole story with the people's militia and the defias brotherhood doesn't have to have anything to do with Arthas story. It's just a side show while leveling up in that zone that is isolated from the "main" story.
---
&gt; It takes what should be a painful and hard road that ultimately ends in triumph and turns it into a walk in the park.
---
Vanilla leveling is already tedious as it is, and getting ganked or spawncamped by ?? doesn't make it "hard", it just makes it more tedious.
---
It's not a rare spawn he's always there in the bar in BRD, I farmed Barman Shanker solo back in the day by stealthing through (before weapon speed normalisation so it was worth having) and it lasted me until Rag finally dropped Perditions Blade. The proc was annoying in raids with only 8 debuff slots, I remember the first time bringing it into MC and the raid leader shouting over comms "Which idiot warrior has used rend?!", had to own up to that one.
---
Great, thanks for that. The number kept being passed around when it is not really true with all the messed up numbers on PServers.
---
couldn't decide before still can't decide now
---
&gt; Who will still play in 2 years realistically? 
---
Me.
---
Most of the people in this subreddit will have been playing WoW for about 14 years. The current iteration of the game destroyed the playerbase. It was part of the reason blizzard stocks plummeted on the market to less than 50% of their value before release of the expac.
---
It's an incredibly mundane, dull, flavourless, grindfest that has you doing the same thing over and over and over all for the sake of reputation with a faction/race to unlock stuff that isn't needed. 
---
Mythic dungeons, which are dungeons with ever increasing difficulty are the main form of progression outside of raids... so yes, that means the same thing over and over on a tougher and tougher difficulty setting.
---
The social interaction between players that aren't in the same guild is so limited that people using group finder generally go through dungeons without even saying hello to one another. 
---
Classic WoW on the other hand, is what a lot of us would consider a 'hard core old school' mmo. As in, you actually have to work and put in the time to achieve literally anything. Epic gear is truly epic and seeing somebody with a tier set or even just a piece of it, is a privilege and an honor. You KNOW that this person has worked hard to earn that piece of gear. 
---
It's a bit less user friendly, but it's not a huge learning curve. People are vastly more interactive and vastly less toxic (generally speaking). 
---
Even the soloable quests are tough sometimes and require you to seek help from others, which means a lot more interaction with other players. Back when wow originally released, I made friends that I still speak to today. 
---
I couldn't even tell you the character name of any of the 10,000 most recent players I saw in-game in current Wow. 
---
I could go on, but I think you get the picture. 
---
TLDR; Classic &gt; Current
---
Problem is everyone seems to want the different thing. Even the #nochanges crowd doesnt agree on things.
---
This thing really is blown out of proportion.
---
You don't think they would take any notes from osrs? I see what you mean, I just think it's a shame that places like Hyjal go to waste. I feel like this is a perfect time for them to not only show what WoW *was*, but also what WoW *could have been* if they had the time to work on those zones as they wished.
---
Get out of here with this hyperbolic bullshit. You're acting as though the game's been released. We don't even have a release date. There's *plenty* of time for them to listen to the itemisation feedback, as they have done previously. Stop getting your knickers in a twist.
---
With few hours of honor gain reset and easily established cross faction connections? I doubt it. I am sure there will be groups of people lvling up a shitton of alts on both factions just to kill each other by their main characters every honor reset.
---
I tried to play with questie once but I hated how bad it cluttered my screen and all the bugs etc. So I just google quests when I can't find something.
---
Standby for the cries of inefficiency haha
---
It's American Beauty. I highly recommend it.
---
Hey Guys,
---
LF Guild (EU/UK PvP Server)
---
I'm going to be playing a Ret/Prot Paladin in vanilla. I always like to Min max my playstyle and will ensure I have consumes/pre raid BiS. 
---
Looking to join a PvE community guild focused on raiding and having a laugh. I enjoy PvP also. 
---
I've tanked, dps'd and led raids since Vanilla. 
---
I also stream, so this should be permitted by the guild. 
---
Cheers,
---
Xeu
---
They only really need about 10 knowledgable people that know what to look for. If even just to find inconsistencies between classic and vanilla.
---
Ohhhhhhhhhh!  Private server experience?  Well, I guess you know more and better than blizz, why dont you remake a stable legit vanilla experience then?  Gtfo, go play on your janky Russian servers.
---
Phase 2 should definitely be short for the reasons you mentioned.  Also going with the later version of the pvp rewards is a mistake IMO, as raiding guilds will want that pvp reward leg up since they are so much more powerful.
---
On that note, I wonder how much further PVP server raiding guilds will be ahead in phase 3 over PVE server guilds.  I expect every world first in BWL to be a pvp server guild just because they will be able to farm those rewards in 2.
---
You don't think a guild would take a totem twisting enhance shaman?
---
Damn.. hit me right in the nostalgic-feels. I'm excited for this again, but I'm afraid seeing the game through my adult eyes is going to be much different to back then!
---
Most likely out comes tbc or fresh servers. Fresh might have improvements on some things (like itemization) or not.
---
Give us our fuckin bg’s early
---
Yeah, but that was then. These days people have min maxed these dungeons to a silly degree.
---
Sure, shit still goes wrong, healer dcs at entrance and so on. But in general everything is done much faster these days.
---
Imo it has affected the feel of classic in a negative way.
---
Yep. I was one of them. 11 years old and everyone thought I was older. They never figured out why I wouldn't use vent.
---
It should destroy classic. So no worries there.
---
&gt;I'm concerned about retaining the player base that plays more than one hour a week.
---
You shouldnt be. This is game for the ppl that want to play vanilla, lets not start doing retail style changes before the fucking launch to "keep players playing". Aka giving them more.
---
&gt; raiders to only log in for reset night past the first month. 
---
This comment tells it all. Even a HC player that does the levelup quite fast, lets say 7d /played. At 5h EVERY FUCKING DAY, its going to take you 33 days to get to L60. Thats 35 hours per week... And you need to find about 60 of the same kind of ppl to your guild to even start raiding. Some might be faster, some might be slower.
---
I never had the chance to get its 2h sword while I was levelling my warrior...
---
That thing was a good weapon before getting Corpsemaker from RFK.
---
&gt; is Blizzard aware that thousands of players are holding back their PTO
---
Even if they were, I doubt that they would care. They will give us a release date once they are ready.
---
I thoroughly understand where you're coming from, and I think it's just a different type of mindset. I am not a player that enjoys "establishing dominance", nor do I prepare for wPvP encounters. I like the mindless leveling, as it is a way in which I am able to clear my head and wind down after a long day. 
---
Playing on a PvP pserver made me realize a few things in regards to leveling, and thus I started doing a few of the things you mentioned; I frequently switched areas and zones to avoid ganking, I avoided popular grinding spots, and generally tried to keep the shaky non-agression agreements with other players when journeying around the world. However, I felt like it wasn't giving me anything extra. It rather just provided an extra level of stress when questing through the 30-50 bracket.
---
The concept of "plan ahead and/or react accordingly" is prevalent in many games, with the Souls series being a prime example. However, as I said, it's different strokes for different folks. I'm just tired of the smug elitism coming from some players on PvP-servers, as if being able to avoid ganking during leveling somehow made them into better players, and as if PvP-servers is the "true" way to play the game.
---
Not even 1% of the server will be able to obtain epic pvp armor, let alone weapons. The grind to get them is unbelievably long and arduous. People will need to honor farm 16 hours a day everyday for months.
---
Leveling a 60 just to give ~2 kills worth of honor ? You are daydreaming.
---
Doesn't Garithos die in wc3? I think there should have at least been a grave or a reference by someone. But I hate when characters that die come back to life. Muradin coming back was really lame.
---
Agreed
---
Seriously 8 months is a loonngggg time to not have arathi basin and warsong gulch
---
It depends whether they actually know their release date or not. They might have a general idea but lack the confidence that they'll be prepared to go live on that specific date. 
---
They'll almost certainly have an internal project plan that will have at some point have a point at which pre-launch tasks turn into post-launch support, but there might be too many tasks between this point and that point that have the potential to introduce delays for them to be comfortable that the nominal date won't slide.
---
They probably prefer not announcing over announcing and then moving. Posts will just change from "I need the date to book PTO! Blizz plz!" to "I booked PTO because you said X and now you've moved it and my PTO is wasted! Blizz sucks!"
---
Yeah, I thought this was the point. It's 15 years later, people still want to place and literally do on pservers.
---
In classic, are herb and mining nodes fixed points that can be camped and spawn times predictable?
---
Fresh will leave realms for dead, and the fresh ones won't fill up.
---
Yes, I can easily see people lvling up hunters for that cause.
---
Winter 2017
---
You've never played on nost. People account shared and no lifed to max level very quickly and began camping at flight masters and running about black rock mountain in 5 man death squads killing anyone with a green level that provides honor.
---
People will do AUTISTIC things for a small edge in video games. Look at the people who ran island expeditions for months on retail just to raise their neck level.
---
These players run the best guilds. 40 man raids require a lot of players to operate. On a 4K pop server you can only support so many guilds on the same server as the best guilds will eat up any good new recruits. Put yourself in the shoes of a new player would you rather join this guild that's struggling to clear cthun and naxx or would you rather join a guild that's had every boss on farm since week 1? The answer is obvious.
---
So these guilds will eat all good recruits meaning if you're trying to run a semi-hardcore guild that doesn't require consumables or ranking the only players you'll get are lazy slackers who can't be assed while all the competent capable players migrate over.
---
This is what happened to my guild on nost. It becomes a situation where you either play long hours with a crappy guild because they don't have unrealistic expectations or you run with the hardcore guys and actually have an enjoyable time at the expense of having to play ridiculous hours to pvp rank/farm gold.
---
This is not ideal. Make the pvp rewards weaker. Do proper itemization. Do something. Don't force this reality on players because it WONT work. We've seen the results already. It was bad enough with pvp rewards being implemented in BWL in their weakened state on nost.
---
How many of these posts have been started in the last 24 hours? Makes it seem like "What is there after Nax" is a fresh subject to talk about.
---
Hi, /u/scousebox
---
Gets me every time.
---
He is right, I did that between queues on a private server, cos we had long queues and it was fun, but I cant imagine doing that for 10-12 hours a day. Rip Chillwind camp, Lakeshire, Menethil Harbour.
---
I think the word you're looking for is *impossible* :)
---
Exactly, or you just go to another zone or don’t roll a pvp server, just like we all did 15 years ago
---
You've got that right, small servers will also have SIGNIFICANTLY less gear, due to smaller standing pools and bracket sizes. People on large servers can feasibly grind rank 14 without troubles, whereas players on lower pop servers will find it impossible to progress past 13 as the standing pools will be too small to provide a bracket 1 spot.
---
Beta-testing server capacities, bandwidth limits and so on with 10 people. That sounds about right to me.
---
These same questions are popping every hour looks like.
---
It all depends on how organized this will be. It's certainly not the 2004 and people would care much more about it compared to private servers. Especially with items being their 1.11 versions.
---
I’m hyped to see coordinated raids on cities again. Which also adds to how torn I am about Alliance vs Horde cause I think it was so much more fun to sack IF or SW.
---
Removed by automod due to tons of reports, but we'd have removed it anyway as being inappropriate.
---
Why didn’t my overt cynicism think of this!?
---
You’ll be looking forward to a lot of Barrens chat then.
---
Which means competition for the top spot on the leader boards will be higher making the grind that much more tedious and difficult.
---
A lot of things in life that are tedious we call hard. When something takes a lot of effort and times that is what makes it hard.
---
This distinction between tedious and hard is meaningless when it comes to games like WoW.
---
Because it's an important topic to talk about and there is none of the top, obviously they will be started.
---
&gt;I'm "no changes" but I want this change 
---
🤔
---
There are other things that you can test in a beta besides those things. I think what you're referring to is an "open beta" or stress test. What  I'm talking about is a closed beta.
---
I feel like we played a different game. Mario/Luigi/Zelda quest chains. A dungeon that recreates a famous Indiana Jones setpiece. A boss named after a popular (at the time) German rock band. So many South Park references. Pop culture references were there and they were obnoxious, and hideously dated even at release.
---
If the release date is on 16th July, as many speculate, then next Tuesday which also happens to be 16th, will be exactly 3 months away from launch, and would be a perfect time to announce release.
---
people like to complain.
---
reality will be more like. "damn i got ganked 4 times tonight, its usually 2 or something. lol"
---
Or much more organized with people controlling it as they control the devilsaur leather market.
---
Eh it's not that crazy, you pick up mining and tailoring, save up the mats for engi, level tailoring as you go, make the robes and then switch to engi and use all the mats.
---
&gt; The devs don't want to put resources into getting an accurate progressive itemization pass. They'd rather push the game into the wild in an unfinished state to make a buck quicker. This is the only explanation that makes sense. 
---
No, they don't want to implement a system where people's gear changes depending on the patch. That is an entirely reasonable stance to take. Someone should be able to buy or loot a piece of gear and have it stay the same for the duration of the game. 
---
All a progressive itemisation system does is penalise people unfamiliar with which items changed and how, whilst rewarding those who do know about it. If someone has to go out of the game and look up information on what their items are going to look like 6 or 12 months down the track, then that is a bad system. You should be able to figure everything out by playing the game. Progressive itemisation does not do that, and Blizzard is entirely justified in avoiding it like the plague. 
---
Yes, it does mean that high end PvP gear will be the best gear in the game for a time. That gear however is far more time consuming to collect than gear from any raid in Classic, up to and including Naxx. it's also limited to a fixed number of people since only a tiny number can possibly get Rank 14 each week regardless of how much they play. So there'll be a few well geared people running around for a time who will be difficult to take on. I won't be one of them, but I look forward to fighting them.
---
47-56 is death. 56 is close enough to 60 that you can even start grouping with fresh 60’s for meaningful dungeons. But man..mid-late 40’s to late 50’s is gonna be roughhh
---
People in the old times had easy targets for ganking, there were a ton of people like me who played the game casually and had no idea how to deal with it. The people who go back to Vanilla 2.0 know what to expect from a PVP server and how to deal with ganking. The gankers from 15 years ago also are not the 15 year olds from then, they are 30 year old parents with a job now and have the reflexes of 30 year olds.... 
---
I am not convinced it will go as some people expect, in these PVP threads here. 
---
I will happily watch the videos about it and have a nice picknick in Ratchet with my guild on an RP PVE server. ;)
---
good luck man, that final was unexpected, hope you have fun. We will all honor your brother all the way
---
unpopular opinion: i'm hoping that they make each phase last longer than they did in vanilla. the game aint going anywhere, why rush the content for all of us just to appease 0.1% of us.
---
Even later on you’ll typically be an honorless target right after you land, but that sure as hell doesn’t mean you won’t get killed.
---
I do not say that everyone was on flask every time. But at least for tries. When you farm Mc/BWL, you don’t use consumables appart from potions/runes and elixir sometimes.
---
Regarding the black lotus, you have, according to classicdb 6 spots in silithius, 10 in eastern plague land, 15 in winter spring, 18 in burning stepped, at least 2 in dire maul.
---
They do not pop at the same time of course but there were far more than 4 black lotus in the world at the same time, per hour.
---
Even though we say that 4 were farmed per hour, it means the server can get 96 per day, 672 per week.
---
Assuming you consume 1 per raid (not on trash but at least on the bosses that are complicated), 2 nights of try, the rest on farm (that does not require consumables, at least not flasks) you well need 80 black lotus per guild, per week.
---
Assuming you have 6 try hard guilds on a server (alliance and horde), you consume 480 black lotus, not even the 672 generated by the world in that time (that seems really really low, even if I agree on the repop time). We can even assume that the 200 additional flasks are consumed by progression guilds on their tank/healers.
---
This is largely a myth. Very very few servers ever had prolonged instances of successfully controlling the server. There's always going to be people who go their own way and disregard the player agreed honor caps.
---
They haven't given a concrete answer on this yet. I kind of hope they see how launch goes first and see where everyone is at in a couple weeks to a month before deciding, personally.
---
The team of today is not the team of 10-13 years ago.  I highly doubt blizzard could release new content that fits the spirit of vanilla.  Game design has changed drastically since then.
---
Not on PvP servers anyways
---
There wont be enough people in WPL for a month or so.
---
Stv will be a shitshow first weekend.
---
I think most people (if they're smart) level first aid, whereas a ton of people won't bother with cooking and if they do it will only be on their main. Cloth is the way to go.
---
I guess you either never played vanilla, have not played on blizzlike pservers or played vanilla too far from adulthood to remember specifics from it.
---
I would just like to know in how many months after release Phase 2 will launch
---
What made you come to that choice?  
---
I've played mage since I started in Wrath, and I like it but isn't it really really boring just casting frostbolt x 12409124
---
Priest and Warlock seem to have a bit more about them, is that what you found?
---
I love the idea of a PvP server but I've always played on PvE. The PvP Content Release Plan made me change my mind for a few hours, but then I remembered I'm a pussy so I'm going back to PvE.  
---
To be honest, I think there will be a lot of world PvP even on PvE servers during Phase 2 considering it will be the only way to rank.
---
I'd argue that pserver experience trumps anecdotal memories of world pvp from 15 years ago. Particularly when you look at modern player interaction and trends. It's WAY more representative of how players will engage with the game in retail classic than how they behaved in vanilla. Times change, as do people.  
---
And quite honestly, we could end up with the situation where pservers are actually MORE accurate than classic, itemisation is a prime example of this.
---
Not one?
---
vanillafriends.com
---
It's a possibility and can happen, maybe won't be flawless but people will find their way to optimize this.
---
I can't remember where I heard it, but I did hear that private servers have BL spawns all fucked up. Apparently on PS, they spawn a lot more frequently then they did in retail vanilla. I think it's supposed to respawn like every 2 hours.
---
SO many feral druids that day.
---
&gt;Except getting ganked by someone higher level than you or getting spawncamped isn't enjoyable
---
Maybe try to git gud and fight back? Vanilla isnt hard.
---
&gt;which will be what most of your low level pvp consists of.
---
Wrong.
---
&gt;Actually PvE is the actual game
---
Well, if AFKing at Ironforge bridge when your raid is on a lockout is enjoyable for you, then fine.
---
If your enemy is secure at all points, be prepared for him. If he is in superior strength, evade him. If your opponent is temperamental, seek to irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant. If he is taking his ease, give him no rest. If his forces are united, separate them. If sovereign and subject are in accord, put division between them. Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected 
---
I mean every expansion has gone through alpha and beta phases under NDA and it isn't until the later stages or when the NDA was lifted did people begin to hear about it.
---
Knowing that the blue gear is updated means I'm not as worried about raiding to be competitive in PVP. Some blue sets are pretty good for PVP compared to T1, but for some classes T1 is much better. For the classes I'm interested in though, blue PVP will do me well. 
---
Anyways, I'm just going to roll what I want now (a pure DPS class) instead of going for a hybrid class that would have helped me gear up easier.
---
ah sorry to hear your going alli. I'm sure it would have been good to have you. What draws you to alli, can I talk to you out of it at all ;)
---
Keep in mind that those people are the exception. Most PvPers just enjoy doing it and that is why they join a PvP server. Yeah it's a game after all :)
---
There is no other way!
---
Oh yeah that was added in Cataclysm. I just haven’t done anything with it in 2 years so I forgot about it.
---
I hope they don't decide until it's launched and they give it a couple weeks to see where people are at. That sounds like the smart move to me anyway.
---
The whole world will be a hotspot - even if you are standing in some far-flung corner of Tanaris or Winterspring, you had better grow eyes in the back of your head. Or just roll PvE.
---
Hopefully. Can you imagine if they pull an Apex and just drop it one day?
---
Except private servers have accelerated timelines. You usually move to a new raid tier every 3-5 months to avoid being bored, not 8 months to a year. And more importantly, they all launch with WSG and AB because that's mandatory to appeal to the PvP player base. 8 months before WSG is insane.
---
STV will be just like the old days then.
---
I have serious doubts. Human greed and self interest will win out. It did then and it will again. And that's assuming an entire servers is even aware of the system set up by the pvp groups. Just that is a nightmare in and of itself.
---
#no changes
---
If anything they would be more used to dying a minute after entering the zone.
---
the amount of boring low effort memes gets way to high
---
It's "silver spoon in hand"
---
Maybe just post a coment in the thread that was posted 18 minutes ago about this?  
---
Just a thought.
---
I'm set on my main. But what my first alt will be is what bugs me.
---
Really want to try a staff warrior with spirit gear.
---
Always enjoyed mage gameplay and farm capabilities.
---
Sneaking with a rogue doing solo/duo stealth runs is just amazing fun.
---
Warlock was the first class I hit 60 with (yeah, that was TBC). Ended up being my main for years and now I've run into interesting ideas on how to use the class.
---
Also druid tanking would be a fun try.
---
So many gimmicks and things to try!
---
That's so funny to me. "Let's gank their money boyz"
---
Honestly, anyone in support of this latest PvP patch should be held accountable for their opinions when they can't level past 50 and quit.
---
Shit
---
Absolutely, my original point was just that there'd been quite a few posts here that keep putting PvP servers on a pedestal while lowkey shitting on those who don't enjoy wPvP, and it's not really creating a great environment. I realize that these people are a minority, but they're loud.
---
Yeah that would be the one! Although you cant really talk to others on the website and it can be confusing! I'm just trying to make things easier
---
What?
---
Eh....that's really not even remotely close to the same feeling from a true PvP sever, though
---
 [https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Black\_Lotus](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Black_Lotus) 
---
There was only 1 at a time in the entire zone, and u assume that every single one will be collected 24/7 wich probably wont happen. You also assume perfect distribution between the try hard guilds, again very unlikely. There will be also be more casuals guilds who will farm them to flask tank and healers. Not to say you absolutely cannot flask 40 people twice a week but it will require insane dedication around the clock.
---
This one made me laugh.
---
I agree with the general idea here. If you plan to play more than a couple hours a day and you haven’t played WoW before I’d say go PvP for sure.
---
Play PvE if you get frustrated easily and want a more relaxed experience and/or you’re short on time. I played PvP since Vanilla launch, but I’m going PvE  at Classic launch since I’m short on time and would like to re-experience the zones/quests without all the corpse running.
---
Remember, the people who are super hardcore into WPvP on here are the ones who are gonna gank your lowbie ass.
---
I personally would love to see some experimemtation after phase 6. Like reviving old vanilla concepts that got scraped because of TBC.
---
Finishing the planned new raids etc.
---
If they go down the route of the other expansions it wont be long until we are back at wow being bad again..
---
&gt;Maybe try to git gud and fight back? Vanilla isnt hard.
---
Yeah you can beat level 55 rogue at 38 if you try hard enough. I hope you are joking because its hard to be this stupid.
---
&gt;Wrong.
---
Powerful argument.
---
&gt;Well, if AFKing at Ironforge bridge when your raid is on a lockout is enjoyable for you, then fine.
---
Why are you talking about things you have no clue about? Have you even played Vanilla or just a private server child? The game released with 0 PvP content other than a PvP button toggle. At no point in history has Blizzard given a fuck about PvP.
---
You could say the same for each of the dozen threads we get complaining about no release date every day.
---
This is why. https://youtu.be/C8UzwM1Zt3M
---
They have their contact info and everything on there. I don’t see how it’s complicated.
---
Nah, still pretty sold on a PVP Nelf Priest. I'll be 60 waaaay before phase 2 rolls around.
---
[https://youtu.be/zJOLH8WfCaY](https://youtu.be/zJOLH8WfCaY?list=PLv7DmXktEzubBPcIFxwUZCGCdWJee3wuD)
---
Better get a playlist for those corpse runs
---
Weeeeell... They're a fighting-caster archetype but not specifically mage I would say. Considering how much their toolkits clashed I think they're more fighting-warlocks. I purposefully made that distinction because otherwise we're including DHs, paladins, shamans and DKs just off the top of my head. While those are fighting-casters none of them use Arcane magic and none of them are focused on nullifying magic to the degree a Spellbreakers is.
---
I agree, just wanted people to see my comment more so than make anything actually funny-  
---
 I'm just upset so many people think they're in support of the pvp post.
---
You are talking like there is a guild with full rank 14 geared ppl starting BWL clears. Autistic ppl will have advantage in gear, no matter how the game is setup. You CANNOT match anyone that is willing to spend more time than you.
---
And lets face it, if your guild doesnt require any consumambles, its not semi hardcore. Its casual and you were never going to compete over the best players in that kind of guild. You get the guys that play the game the same way as you do.
---
Im in the same boat. Sometimes I think that I know it but then 2 weeks later I change my mind. 
---
For now I think Im going to choose a class that can do PvP/PvE with the same spec. So:
---
SM/Ruin warlock
---
MM/SV Hunter
---
Hotw/Resto Druid. 
---
Can’t think of more classes who can do it aswell. 
---
Anyone knows if there are more?
---
And good luck grinding to even the blue sets if nobody will flag themselves. A goon squad on a pve server is gonna feel like a roaming pack of neutered dogs.
---
I’m planning to play on a pvp server and I embrace what that means even in phase two.  My only real problem with all of this is that they are using the late vanilla pvp sets which will have all the raiding guilds farming relentlessly for them before they can even look at BWL
---
I've resigned to taking several 3-4 day weekends post release. Less likely to burn out this way and as long as I ding 60 by the end of phase 1 I'll be content.
---
&gt;when they start wondering why they're always a few % behind on the damage meters.
---
😬 If by a few % you mean around 30-40% in similar gear, then yea.
---
Bugging Blizzard for a release date is def not the same.
---
As long as Drake aproves ;)
---
You didn't finish your last sentence bro.
---
*Either and no or
---
&gt;Yeah you can beat level 55 rogue at 38 if you try hard enough. I hope you are joking because its hard to be this stupid.
---
Level faster than him. Change Zones. Git gud overall.
---
&gt;Powerful argument.
---
Just like yours, PvE carebear.
---
&gt;Why are you talking about things you have no clue about? Have you even played Vanilla or just a private server child? The game released with 0 PvP content other than a PvP button toggle. At no point in history has Blizzard given a fuck about PvP.
---
Why are you so mad? This is the reality of a PvE server, when you are full Pre-Bis and your raid is on a lockout, all you have left to do is RP on goldshire inn or afk at Ironforge/Stormwind with your carebear friends, even on PvP this shit happens, imagine on PvE.
---
I dont need 100% bug free game, they can fix end game shit or some lamp color while i levelup.
---
For me, I've added myself on there, and I've also tried searching for people. I've found some, but only because I've had to scroll through to find them rather than making it easy.
---
I've created realm text channels, and utilizing the search bar on top you can find everything.
---
There will also be other text channels to use to to converse with other players too and maybe make new friends to go into Classic with.
---
I dont quite understand the point you're trying to make towards me at the moment.
---
I'd you want, take a look at the discord, and let me know if I can do something to help. Bearing in mind I'm still trying to construct it.
---
Yeah, that's understandable. This team has been proving their dedication to the Vanilla mindset, though. So you never know!
---
I think it would be neat if they even added simple things like a new world boss or something. The only thing they'd have to be careful with is drops.
---
They also had much higher population caps than Vanilla did and thus much higher than Classic will likely have.
---
Whether the competition remains the same will be a function of how Classic works. Will Classic have half the people but only a quarter of the spawn rate for BL? That means more competition, as there's even less BL spawns per person playing on the server now. Will it be the other way round, with more BL spawns per person than private servers had? Then less competition, as BLs will be more common proportionately.
---
Running through the barrens to get to each other's starting zone will take no more than a half hour. And once that's done there will be absolutely zero other obstacles you will face because you are different races.
---
They were removed with AV, so I would say it is only logical for them to be available in Phase 1 &amp; Phase 2
---
I’m stuck between a few classes, I know I’m playing alliance though, I want to pvp a LOT but also raid for my gear obviously
---
Warrior - hard to gear and hard to make gold
---
Rogue - overpopulated 
---
Mage - overpopulated
---
Warlock - want to play but scared of being a gimp in pvp due to undead and underpowered until late end gear
---
Hunter - very few raid slots
---
It’ll be just fine, don’t roll troll!
---
Who is that knowledgeable when it comes to vanilla? It's a game that has been offline for 14 years. Everything is completely overshadowed by the inconsistencies between vanilla and emulation.
---
We'll get that wild goose chase early enough. We already got a taste of that with the warlock summoning behaviour fiasco. "Knowledgeable" people insisted that Blizzard missed the daze spell on a pet that would hold it while another pet cast was made. They even produced screenshots and videos. Turns out those were not 1.12 and screenshots and videos are unreliable, as are the memories of the "knowledgeable" people.
---
Blizzard has a reference server. They are good.
---
&gt; It's basically impossible to get rank 12 let alone rank 14 before bgs are out.
---
Clearly you don't understand how the system works. If everyone is only getting 100 honor each week, you only need 101 honor to be standing 1 and eventually hit rank 14. It's a comparative system so the only thing dictating how much honor you need is all the players on your realm and your faction. 
---
The only thing that, as far as I know, can result in no rank 14s is low participation in the PvP rankings which requires 25 honorable kills. If not enough participates the top bracket will shrink to less than 1 player meaning no one can reach rank 14.
---
I don't know about horde, but I would travel from Teldrassil all the way to Elwynn with my NE characters at lvl 1, and it was doable.
---
Well next time try making that clear in your post instead of being critical of anyone who has to read between the lines of your post, which you admit right here was pretty vague to begin with for all intents and purposes.
---
Yay! Our forbidden love lives!
---
Thanks :D
---
Ok this confirms you never played Vanilla, you are obviously too young. Either that or too retarded to provide any meaningful contribution.

# The Argent Vanguard
---
**DnD style, Argent Dawn-themed Roleplay**
---
* **Region:** EU
---
* **Server Type:** RP
---
* **Faction:** Alliance
---
* **Play Times:** Varied.
---
* **Priorities:** Leveling &gt; Roleplay &gt; Dungeons
---
* **Particular Rule:** Willingness to engage in both organized &amp; random Roleplay.
---
* **Contact:** discordapp.com/invite/BGQ4Z9e
---
# Introduction; In-Universe
---
The      Vanguard, commonly known as the ‘Argent Spear’ was originally     created   in order to allow the Dawn to strike at foes in the farthest     corners  of  the plaguelands of Lordaeron.
---
Over     the  years as they gradually discovered the agents of both the     Burning   Legion and the Scourge have spread to the civilized regions of     the   world, the Dawn started deploying them as an expeditionary    force.
---
Nowadays they are known to operate all across Azeroth. Anywhere evil rears its ugly head, they will be there to meet it.
---
# Introduction; Out of Character
---
The      Argent Vanguard aims to be the premier roleplaying destination  for     all  your Argent Dawn themed roleplaying needs on Classic WoW.
---
We will offer:
---
* Weekly events &amp; multi-part campaigns.
---
* A commendation system for tracking player achievements.
---
* A defined path of progression, with multiple platoons &amp; roles to fill.
---
* Our own, home-brew RPG system for events.
---
* Discord server.
---
Our      Roleplay will be grounded in canonical lore, with our events   taking     place during the Vanilla timeline. This does not mean however   that     concepts expanded upon and introduced in later expansions  can’t be      introduced into our stories, within reason.
---
We      wish to emphasize persistence through our Roleplay, so we will    often    spend long periods of time away from major Roleplaying hubs,   even     outside of guilds events.
---
We also wish to manage &amp; maintain a PvE &amp; PvP wing of the guild to fully exploit the content offered by the game.
---
With the Vanguard there will be no downtime, always having something to do.
---
Wild Elven Hunter jumps into the battle
---
I just want to point out that there won't be much in the way of honor kills available to 60s in STV. Obviously this is just a joke post but it's pretty emblematic of how lots of users on this sub don't think through their priors and jump to their conclusion on how this'll play out
---
As they fight, holding vehemently to their smoking guns, they have yet to realize that both are waterguns. 
---
One devout warrior is holding a 14 year old, inferior, 'original supersoaker' and the other self proclaimed 'elite badass' is holding a next-gen watergun that has been recalled because it doesn't even shoot a directed stream of water at the enemy as a watergun should.
---
They say the argument may last until release...
---
It takes a long time to walk, but you can die and rez at new graveyards, shortening the trip considerably, and giving you early access to the flight paths.
---
First, Nost had 8-10k people online for it's one and only PvP server, meaning it was constantly crowded at all hours and all the nolifers were in the same room.
---
Classic will have far smaller population caps, divided into timezone regions (and thus will have *long* quiet periods), and the nolifers will be spread out across all of those servers.
---
There simply won't be the same 24 hour target-rich environment available in Classic.
---
Second, Nost attracted a specific crowd: hardcore Vanilla fans. Classic will attract them and a substantially larger number of "normal" gamers who wouldn't have bothered to go out of their way to download and set up a bootleg illegal game. 
---
Much like in Retail, much like in *actual Vanilla*, and much like in every game that's ever been played ever, the nolifer hardcore PvPers and PvEers will be a small minority and the vast majority of players and guilds will not be exclusively reserved for unemployed people.
---
 Hi, I am looking for a guild for when retail launches :)
---
* Intended region (NA/EU): EU, I'm based in the UK.
---
* Intended server type (Nomal, PvP, RP, RP-PvP): Don't mind PvP / PvE, but RP is not for me.
---
* Intended faction: Undecided.. more interested in the people I'll be playing with.
---
* Intended raid/play times (with timezone): GMT +0 timezone. Play time may vary as I have adult responsibilities, could commit to 1, max 2 nights raiding per week. :(
---
* Any priority you may have in a guild (Raiding, PvP, RP, Social experience, etc): Primarily looking to meet some nice people to do dungeons, level and slowly gear up with. Would love to see some raid content but realistically that is way down the line. 
---
* Any pertinent rules: None, I am very easygoing. None of my irl friends play WoW so just looking to meet some new people to begin this adventure with. :)
---
* A preferred form of contact (PM, Discord link, website application): PM on here and we can talk further :D I look forward to meeting you.
---
* PS: Mainly looking to play either: Fury warrior, Rogue or Priest. Really can't make up my mind but if you have preference for one over the other it may help me decide. ;)
---
* About me: I'm 27, I haven't played since the beginning of WOTLK expac when I quit WoW. I levelled a few characters in Vanilla so I know the grind and it's not a problem, although I never got past MC raid wise. In TBC I was a super hardcore raider as a Shadow Priest and cleared all the content.. WOTLK came around and real life took over and I missed the old content.. But hey, now I'm back and I am just looking to enjoy the game and see the content with some new friends in a relaxed environment. I've only ever played as Alliance so I am happy to stay on the side I know well, but equally I am up for a new challenge and a different perspective in trying Horde.
---
7 weeks? Hah yeah right. It takes a month of #1 just to go from 12 to 14.
---
The correct respawn is about an hour.  Some pservers did increase the speed.
---
https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=1046
---
^ good tool for making a decision if you’re still unsure
---
Ehh, the arena chest won't be available from Phase 1? :(
---
Sorry but I just repeated what I said in my post. Seriously where do in my OP do I say that "fuck me flight master pvp sucks". Nowhere.  I said that it will be the best way to get honor and you are therefore forced to do it due to the way honor system works. Now I  repeated it for third time :D
---
I'm sure they have as much in-house testing as they can ("beta" if you want to call it that). They have the original 1.12 client/server running to check things and a quite a few enthusiastic WoW players who played Vanilla. ;) I don't think they'd need just a few more outside people.
---
If they decide they need more testing, they'll have an open beta (perhaps limited in some ways) but I suspect there won't be one. They can get the game into a reasonably good shape with internal testing and I think they value the launch hype more than trying to squash more bugs before it.
---
I love when someone’s minority opinion becomes “nobody wants that.”
---
Now would be a good time to check #guildrecruitment on the Classic WoW discord.
---
This is one change you can make yourself you know xD.
---
If you actually need it spelled out for you:
---
My preference would be to have the Honour system as it was before the DHK patch. Which was part of Vanilla. I can see some people sperging at that, so having NPC's untargettable helps them too. Best of both worlds.
---
If that somehow upsets you, then just go with no DHKs.
---
Expect to die several times running through the barrens though, as the mobs there will be 10-20 lvls higher than you. Nothing wrong with that though, there's virtually zero penalty for death so lvl 1. Spirit rez if the graveyard puts you closer to your destination and keep on truckin!
---
If your really curious there's probably several YouTube videos about optimal routes and maybe even shortcuts you could look up.
---
Have fun playing wow with your hubby! He's a lucky man, I wish had a wife like you to play with!
---
I already had to submit my holidays..had to gamble on mid July since Blizzard gave us fuck all.
---
What if someone gets personal enjoyment out of relentlessly ganking lowbies?
---
You can't just sit here and assign "right" and "wrong" reasons to play the game.  Saying you're playing for "the right reasons" is in itself being elitist.
---
Nice ad hominem. Imagine being 25+ and still afraid of PvP in games, lol.
---
I remember seeing multiple fury warrior dps threads every single day on the forums, especially comparing 2h to DW. But yes lots of warriors were arms/prot hybrid spec simply because they were expected to tank raids quite often.
---
Honestly belongs in Phase 3, they haven’t thought this through at all. They imagine Epic world PvP skirmishes, but the reality will be camping flight paths relentlessly.
---
Oh yeah I wasn't referring to "memespecs" at all. Hell even just hunters played to the best of their ability will still be 20-30% like you said Haha. People are in for a rude awakening.
---
My post was just about comparing human warriors to Night Elf or Gnome warriors etc etc. When you see raw dps on a spreadsheet, and changing out one of your items gives you a 10dps boost bust changing the race column gives you a 40dps boost it can make you regret that race choice big time! Haha. I think we should let people know that ahead of time in case they get into min maxing and watching meters. That's the fun part of dps raiding for me. When you're in 20th place and no one sees you on the charts it feels like the guild wouldnt really miss you in my eyes.
---
Well as someone that will be participating in the beta I can tell you it’s not happening yet.
---
Enjoy being camped at a flight path.
---
Honestly, I think I hate 1-30 more than i do 30-60.
---
30-60 has so many spots were I can grind for mats to sell on AH or vendor farm trash while leveling. If you know the right spots and what to farm and what time to sell, you can have your epic mount as soon as you sing 60 along with basically anything else youd like gold wise.
---
Only downside is you need to do a FUCKTON of grinding mobs lol
---
Pex? Not familiar with that term
---
On paper, it takes 15 weeks of standing one (aka most honor gained within your faction) to reach rank 14.  
---
I can see people actually pulling this off via a huge group effort.
---
There is a town in ^
---
I like my #nochanges with a sprinkle of 'necessary' changes THANK YOU
---
Crocolisks
---
OP seemed to have reservations about a PVP server, that's why I suggested this.
---
Personally I know exactly what the feeling is on a PVP server, that's why I'll roll on a Normal one. :)
---
And getting gear as an ally boomy is the easiest
---
They will most likely add the updated versions of tier gear, because the PvP gear will be the 1.12 version.
---
That and server distribution info.
---
Is that really the same boss?
---
But you didnt though. You simply made the assertion that flight master camping will be the most efficient method of gaining honour and that people will be forced into participating in it... both of which had negative connotations that suggested you were unhappy with it.
---
Clearly you need to rethink how you articulate your points, try being a bit more specific and not relying so much on other people being able to understand your thought process when you fail to make it clear in the first instance.
---
Typical casual brain, everyone on PvP servers loves PvP. Camping flight paths/instance entrances with a massive team isn’t PvP. Incentivizing shitty play styles is a bad decision on Blizzard’s part. I expect something to change.
---
You're right, its a minimum of 7 weeks to get R12, which is when you get the first epic gear. My bad. Proves the point even more though; even after P3 is released, you won't see anyone with HWL gear for a long time.
---
Spamming this subreddit ain't the same as bugging Blizzard, but hey ho.
---
Absolutley pick aesthetic over racials, unless said racial is absolutely necessary for the playstyle you plan on having.
---
I will forever love creating female taurens and female dwarves. Two of the least played races in the game. But I fooken love em to death. I wouldnt have it any other way.
---
Biglike for big tru tru
---
STV will be the same regardless of whether bgs are introduced at the same time as we get the honor system? It makes little-no difference to wpvp at all, particularly at lower levels. The most dramatic effect will be on the 48+ levelling zones.
---
Just waiting on that RP-PvP announcement...
---
I play on progression Everquest and generally this is true, but it's not quite as bad as it seems.  When new servers launch, guilds on the old servers who are continuing on are going to have some consolidation, but there's still people there playing.
---
New servers will be needed for the folks who can't make the first wave.  This could be people who are just busy doing other things, or maybe kids who are too young to play today, but would love to experience it years from now.
---
Then you have the segment of the population who loves the race.  The race to 60, the race for pvp ranks, the race for server raid firsts, whatever.  Maybe they want to redo the race with a different class and just rerolling a new main and be carried into Naxx isn't the same.
---
We are going to need a new servers plan, exactly when and how often will be dictated by demand, but do not underestimate this.  Just because the current servers aren't full doesn't mean the demand isn't there.  Two years from now there will be a lot of inactive players idling in old discords just waiting for the announcement of a new server and will be back.
---
Then you have the idea that after the new car smell has worn off, Blizzard could start launching gimmick servers.  You could have a server with double exp, or half exp for those who want it harder/easier.  You could do a server where all loot is tradable and nothing is bind on equip.  Maybe a server where the turn-in items for unlocking the gates is unknown to players at the start of the server so items aren't banked from day one.  All of these would be fun variations that would keep players coming back for years without a huge amount of changes on Blizzards end.
---
Hey nothing wrong with a troll! Just make sure you go hunter
---
[https://youtu.be/QKNgN5C4kqE](https://youtu.be/QKNgN5C4kqE)
---
It's not like you couldn't.... Technically you could solo trash in dungeons or something.
---
Nobody is afraid, some people just value their free time and would rather focus it on more fun and developed aspects of the game such as PvE.
---
When you leave your mommy and have to make your own lunch you will understand.
---
Pretty decent tool, but I don't think it helps in this situation.
---
Especially since there are no Dhks
---
Lmfao, you don't see the absurdity in this statement?
---
&gt; What draws you to alli 
---
Just nostalgia and a chance to do 2005 all over again in the same way :P  
---
&gt; can I talk to you out of it at all ;) 
---
Now I come to think of it, perhaps! Maybe I should treat Classic as a new game rather than a naive attempt to relive my teenage experience!
---
They aren't talking about boosted exp. Private server leveling is absolutely not 1 to 1 with actual Vanilla leveling. A lot of quest reward experience is just guessed, or more commonly, pulled from a BC server/database (which is higher.) Not to mention most servers have different (or guessed) mob respawn patterns/timers.
---
Yes but what more information specifically did I provide in my later responses that wasn't in the original? Or was the problem just articulation?
---
This. Also, Taladril’s feral guide.
---
It’s similar to the Wetlands death run for Nelfs, yes.
---
Devilsaur leather
---
That’s fair then if you’re clearing quickly like that then I wouldn’t be mad. 45 min MC / BWL is what you want so at that point it’s gravy
---
This subreddit is 95% spam. Its one thing to voice your dissatisfaction with the way the game is being handled. Its another to make seperate threads for your comments.
---
Exactly. I wouldn’t be surprised if we see someone with an Ashkandi before we see HWL gear.
---
Idk man, the average player is soooo much better today than 13 years ago. Today, the average player _looks up information_ regarding their spec. Today, it's expected even in _average_ guilds to watch raid fights and learn strats. Back then, that wasn't so common. Mostly it was RL's doing that. Not to mention today's player has much more experience gaming in general.
---
So we have improvements on:
---
1. Expectations of average players with regard to class knowledge, raid knowledge, general game knowledge
---
2. General gaming experience for the average player
---
It has nothing to do with phase 2. Without xrealm-bgs you still need to grind the open world while waiting for the bg to open.
---
Arcanite bars
---
Dreamfoil, Icecaps, Mountain Silversage, Gromsblood - all those as well as Lotus' for flasks and pots.
---
Huh.... look at that.  I think we've found the threadkiller.
---
Absolutely true, but the vast sea of casuals won’t be able to comprehend how.
---
It would be awesome if the Spirit Healer randomly says "PvP happened on a PvP server" (on PvP servers, of course.)
---
You’ve played too much private servers. It’s deluded you from the fact that classic will not only have regional servers where you won’t be playing with people from China Europe Africa NA AND SA. You also don’t realize how many new people who never played private servers are going to play.
---
I'll be doing the same, and I hope my concerns don't come to fruition - but I can't see any other way sadly.
---
I think it will be a youtube cinematic + post in twitter, and official portal. I think that after a announcement we should see the poster in a [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) Launcher like they did with WC3 Remaster.
---
&gt;The  idea is that it should not be any data that wasn't in vanilla, that it  should stick to the old design philosophy and hold true to the old  tenents. With no modern problem solving. 1.12 is certainly the cut off  point because past that it wouldn't be Vanilla data but that's about it.  I personally thought they were going with 1.8 or assumed as much before  the annoucement because that's a middle ground between the extremely  hardcore and the completely lame.  
---
&gt;If  they're going to do itemization changes and use old data for that then  an older iteration of AV shouldn't be off the table either. It's  logically inconsistent and the arguments for it come across as a plain  old intellectually dishonest attempt to be mean for the sake of being  mean, because the changes side ([/r/wow](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow)) lost.
---
While this doesn't address the mounts the point still stands, these strawman arguments are pathetic.
---
Yup
---
ty :) the truth isn't always easy to hear unfortunately
---
Chinese farmer will get them during the night. ;)
---
I remember buying black lotus from a player that was NEVER connected from 6 to 1 am (to avoid AH commission) and discovered one early morning (4am) that he was connected but did not speak English.
---
True regarding the distribution, I only assumed 2/3 of the production of black lotus for try hard guilds linked to the fact that try hard guilds are ok to spend lots of money in the AH For consumables.
---
The dedication you are talking about is the difference between try hard and progression.
---
But what most people don’t realize (linked to retail perception/easiness?) is that very few guilds will be able to clear the whole content. We will not crush the content but it will crush us. And people that will be ready to farm 10-12 hours for a 2 hours raid, will be considered try hard and will finish the content. The others will be between :
---
- not raiding
---
- running Mc but not killing rag
---
- doing MC/BWL/AQ without c’thun
---
- doing above and a few bosses in naxx
---
And that’s fine! But I think it’s going to be a hard realization for lots of people
---
I will definitely do that with my NE Warrior lol. Elwynn, Westfall, Lakeshire and Duskwood are just too good to pass up imo.
---
My response to my friends at announcement of the phases was: well at least phase 1 will bring back the old tarren mill days. It will be a blast.
---
Since it’s easier for the majority to get more kills when bgs are out, won’t it be a matter of luck who gets commander to field marshal during this period of non bgs?
---
I never showed that same kind of mercy... 😂
---
do you enjoy being rich? Does farming anything you want by jumping into dire maul north and east 5 times each per hour uninterrupted sound like something you want? Do you want the best cc in the game? If so stick with mage.
---
I really don't understand how this is a problem. If you're willing to put in an absolutely insane amount of time you should be rewarded for it. That's Classic WoW. The amount of people getting R14 in Phase 2 will be absolutely miniscule and won't affect everyone else.
---
I was on Mal'Ganis because that's where all my friends were when I first started playing. I'm not doing that again. :L
---
I don't. If you want to level in peace roll on a PvE server lol.
---
Fuck off positing this.
---
All 2 of the pre bg rank 14s on NA will deserve it. It wo have NO impact on you.
---
Play in a pve server like me.
---
You only need to do this on the overpopulated faction - and maybe not at all if both factions are relatively balanced. What I'd like to see is some kind of hybrid between xrealm and server only bgs. A dynamic queue system whereby the queue prioritises teams from your own server, and after the first 5/10/15 minutes or however long, expands to search for players from different servers in order to fill up the games.
---
Crossrealm was introduced for a reason, there will be servers with 80-20 faction balances in classic, they're outliers and it just happens. With this system I feel like balanced servers won't have their experience hampered, whereas it'd fix the problem for those outlier servers with severe imbalances.
---
One thing I KNOW I will hate is the lack of bags until 20 or so. Secondly, I really wish they would add area loot :( 
---
Inb4 Im castrated by “#NOCHANGES” crowd
---
Warlocks on alliance are good in bgs. Paladins were the worst when I was a horde lock because they really destroy your damage with cleanse and you have to resort to being basically a shadow bolt. Escape artist is also arguably one of the best racial for a class that has really no way to get out of someone closed in on them
---
Depends on timeline. 
---
Early on crafted gear and their materials (So devilsaur leather, felcloth) will be in very high demand, but over time lower.
---
Late game items that are fairly low demand early (Elemental Earth), in theory won't fetch you much early but if you're patient can pay out later. 
---
In general things that are consumables are "always" in demand - mana potions\free action potions, but even those fluctuate. 90% of your server raids on Tuesday? Then demand is going to be way higher on Tuesday than Friday.
---
TL;DR - It depends.
---
Crossroads is under attack
---
Indeed, Ignorance is blizz (see what I did there?) ;)
---
I've barely played any actually. I don't think I've even gotten a character to 60 the couple of times I have. This is all coming from my experience getting to rank 11 on one of the highest populated servers back when the game first came out.
---
Hahahahaha true
---
Yeah they used to have, but we're not playing around on shitty Feenix servers anymore. The modern servers are extremely close to vanilla values. The BC server database was fixed over a year ago.
---
The mob respawn patterns on one particular server is given a boost if there are over certain amount of people in the zone. TBH this is something I want Blizzard to implement as well because holy shit it fucking sucks to compete for kills like that.
---
You level much faster in private servers than you will in Classic.  Stop basing your opinion of leveling in Vanilla to private servers, because they openly admit their values are wrong and that you level faster on private servers.
---
It should be updated according to this.. Something I missed?
---
When people say its gonna be a bloodbath *obiwan kenobie saying "that's why I'm here"*
---
Even if paladins did nothing useful, 300-600 dps max and no heals, you would still probably bring at least 3-4 just for Bok+Bom+Bow+Salvation since in vanilla it's kinda not practical to sit people outside raids for buffs.
---
Such is the power of paladin.
---
Yeah it’s hard to tell what’s worse because most of horde is undead and sometimes you might not see many Pally’s in a fight so not sure, I’m so stuck between the classes I mentioned lol
---
I disagree. Not many items get weaker and the items that do get weaker are because they were extremely strong before hand. The only item I can think of that got weaker was the off hand from the linkens sword quest. I believe it reduces mana cost of each spell by like 25 mana or so which was nice for healers.
---
The game was also designed to make you get stronger in each patch to keep up with the new more difficult content. That’s why items get buffed and stats change. There are many items in 1.12 state that are much stronger. You don’t want to create the large gear gap early.
---
Also blizzard is being lazy by not implementing it. two servers both were able to do it. And it was a fucking blast compared to The one that didn’t. It was always fun seeing items get better and it also worked in your favor for some items as they’d be listed for cheap in one patch and then the next be double the price. So you could snag some deals.
---
If s team of volunteers can do it, blizzard can do it. It’s a good feature to add and gives the game a lot more character.
---
My original comment got removed due to naming servers.
---
I was already leaning toward PvE and if they go with this plan and don't make any tweakings, it seals my decision. 
---
I played PvP server during Vanilla and mostly I liked it but I have the feeling that it will vastly different and I don't want to level from 48 to 60 with hardcore players who played private servers for the last 5 years abusing every mechanics and farming me at flight paths  to be the first to rank 14 while they leveled in a mostly gank free world because there was no incentive to fight.
---
Also it will be the race to level to 60 before that deadline for many and makes people forget about having fun.
---
I would suggest you both finish your respective 1-10 starting zones then meeting up at crossroafs on level 10-12
---
&gt; So the only “WPvP” in P2 will be camping flight paths. 
---
FTFY
---
Yea.. as much as i like a good world pvp, from the experience on private servers... there is no way i roll on a PVP server, maybe if i play Paladin..
---
Or you could pick them one by one although it's quite a pain as a Warrior xd.
---
I suggest you shut up, I've pvp'd in vanilla for the last 4 years+ and played a pvp server in original vanilla from 2 months after EU launch. I love pvp, hence why I'm trying to speak out against what I think will be damaging to pvp in Vanilla.  
---
And no, the people I'm describing will not play on pve servers. Everyone knows that pvp servers are the most populated and alive generally speaking.
---
I know I definitely want to play on Alliance side just still debating on whether I want to be a Paladin or Warrior.
---
I will probably have both but Idk which one I want to be my main. 
---
And you could always get the ram on Dwarf! 
---
Yes I know. This was of no help :3
---
Because some people take it TOO FAR. Just look at what happened on private servers. STV was unplayable, Tanaris was at times too.
---
Well it's what I'll do indeed. But it bother me because I like world PvP but I just don't like a world PvP where it's lvl60 farming flight paths and not skirmish between roughly similar level player.
---
But that's not really a big deal in the end. I'll just have fun killing dragons in dark dungeons then.
---
PVE servers will have it worse during this phase in some ways, you won't be able to rank up because nobody will be flagged and not enough players will reach the threshold to provide high bracket spots - so you will progress MUCH slower to your desired rank than players on pvp servers. This will create a significant imbalance between large pvp server and pve servers.
---
You shouldn't come across crocolisks. There is a shortcut from the valley of trials to ratchet.
---
If you play 4 hours a day, like most normal adults that play too much games can. It'll still take around a month of playing every day to reach lvl 60.
---
Then it'll take 2-3 months just to get gear for MC if you don't enjoy wiping a lot.
---
There you go, only a few months of MC until the next raid is released, which is less time than you actually need.
---
I PRAY TO GOD (none existent or not) that Blizzard won't fall for the crying raiders once more and just puke out content no one is doing because 99.9% of the playerbase is still lvling, doing 5-mans and haven't even touched a raid yet.
---
My son is 8. Some of his friends from school play Fortnite. I've played computer games since mid 80's (Commodore --&gt; Amiga ---&gt; PC) so I have a strong opinion of what makes a "good" game. Fortnite and many modern games don't fall under that category. I make sure his weekly screen time allowance is spent playing vanilla :) And he really loves it.

---
I don't think it will be that bad on classic. You can't really compare it to private servers with 10k+ concurrent players in the world. And also, the big private servers attract the most hardcore vanilla wow fans in the entire world and congregate them all onto one server. In classic the average server will be way less hardcore. So (presumably) ~4 times lower server pop caps and an overall less hardcore playerbase, it won't be nearly as bad as on private servers. There'll be plenty of relevant areas in the world where people can lvl/farm in relative peace.
---
You say this now, but when cata launched everybody was stoked the old world was changed for leveling purposes. Between two accounts I had 9 max level characters by WotLK. I remember being so burned out on the old world leveling routes. I haven’t rerolled on multiple private servers specifically to try and keep the experience fresh considering I intend to level 4 60s in the first 6 months.
---
Oh nooo I choose to play on a pvp server and now have to deal with actual world pvp!!
---
That’s the most important. Many other concerns, like how far they will implement sharding, or server stability, all tie into the pop cap. 
---
Other than that, I’d also like to hear about the report feature, I really hope reports get read by a human before someone’s banned or silenced.
---
If you've never played WoW, you will definitely enjoy current WoW. In fact I'd recommend playing it until Classic comes out just to get your feet wet. If you wanna play just lmk.
---
I think it's a fine balance Blizz needs to strike with release phases. Early on I think 3-4 months is fine but phases 4-6 could be 4-6 months between.
---
I'm in support of the pvp post
---
Hahaha! I'm rolling on a RP server too, I know exactly how you feel.
---
On a side note, I'm happy to know that there will be another person on the RP server besides me!
---
&gt;I'm hoping it doesn't end up with too much griefing of lower levels
---
My guess would be that lower levels will be fine until they hit 51, then it's going to get painful for them as they suddenly become honorable targets worth farming. I'd expect those chasing rank (myself included) will want to farm zones where honorable targets will be questing or be in zones with a historical reputation for PVP (STV, Tarren Mill). For lowbies it's easy to avoid those hotspots until you're forced into WPL/EPL/Winterspring etc.
---
Troll master race
---
You have to be the peak of casual to think “World PvP will thrive” as a result of this.
---
STV and tanaris were okay by comparison to the campfest WPL was.
---
However modern problems require modern solutions. For Alliance, never fly into WPL. Go hinterlands and cut through the mountains.

5-7 days is possible if you have a good route, get ahead of the pack, and no life it. Basically you need to play 18 efficient hours per day to level in a week.

---
What I described is basically 3-4 hours of playing 2 nights a week. Then some additional herb farming every once in a while whenever you have time. This is casual and I think can be supported by most people as long as they don't have this *mentality* of having to suck at the game because otherwise it's not fun or whatever. Doing the reasonably optimal things actually counts for more when you are casual.
---
*fortunate son intensifies*
---
Ok, explain it then. What aspect of private servers cause player behaviour to shift towards wanting to maximize honor/hour and what aspect of the authentic Classic experience makes player behaviour shift towards NOT wanting to max honor gains?
---
"Private server" has become just a useless word from people who cant be bothered to string more than three words together to make an actual argument.
---
I'm sure they will release it when the game is ready.  Announcing a date and having to delay would be bad for us and for them.  Chill your tits.
---
If you wanna get into that boy's hole!
---
Phase 2 of Classic is when honor rewards/rankings will be implemented and will land at the same time as Dire Maul. Phase 3 is BWL/WSG/AV, phase 4 is ZG/AG, phase 5 is AQ and phase 6 is Naxx.
---
I'll only mention this once in this one thread, hit 60 and take 1-2 friends.  Farm Tyr's Hand.
---
Dual boxing or just crazy?
---
It really is not that hard when you have two accounts. The first character you power level at launch. You can use that toon to give your primary alt instance runs in certain tiers for super fast leveling. The first two 60s will be within the first month of launch. The other two I’ll slowly multi box over the next few months. The profession cooldowns and access to different farms is simply worth the time investment.

---
We’ve waited 13 or so years for Classic, I hope they don’t pin themselves to the July 16 Easter egg meme just to gratify us a week or two earlier.
---
...still hope it comes out July 16 without bugs though...
---
I played Priest in vanilla and literally every expansion after lol. For me it’s an almost spiritual choice! 
---
But some of why I love the class: I LOVE healing. And pallies May be better in some scenarios but no one is more fun to heal with in vanilla, pve or PVP, than priests. HOTs, shields, quick heals, huge heals, AOE heals. And some really hilarious spells like levitate and mind control (so many shenanigans with this one).  
---
Priests look awesome and have lots of great sets. Love the way my priest looks after scarlet monastery gearing, grabbing the Voo Doo mask from ZF or whatever; and then the tier sets at 60 are great as well. 
---
Finally, questing is pretty fun as a priest! Grab a great wand, shield yourself, cast a couple dots, and then wand a way. Close to zero downtime once you get your wand (as early as level 5). 
---
Gosh I love priests in vanilla!
---
I believe my played was around 7days
---
See above.
---
Are you saying boy’s hole?
---
I have first hand experience of casual guilds from private servers - they don't tend to get far past BWL.
---
Just build...
---
You stop that.
---
I'm loving the memes and dont care if it's true or not. =)
---
Exactly. But I fear we'll have to have these discussions at some point in Classic, as all of these reasons are pretty irrelevant in raids especially, and some people only think about the raiding... 
---
It's usually the people who already played Vanilla on pservers for a long time and don't play it for a nostalgic factor anymore, only for a competitive one. I sincerely hope they are the minority though and only raid in their tryhard guilds, so both groups don't come into contact as much.

You really don't lose that much reaction time as you get older. If you're playing slower its because you're out of practice.
---
Maybe they are delaying the release date purposely so that some wont have time to plan vacation. This could mean the servers wont be as overloaded as they could be? :o
---
Spy usually refers to a person other than yourself so you dont have to log out or multi box.
---
Not many people are going to buy the game twice and pay 15 bucks whenever they want to peep the other fiction's cities. They'll just get in Discord for a server and ask a friend in there.
---
If you do that, your business is yours and your money your own. You probably wont be banned, and it's not against ToS, just an expensive and shitty thing to do, whether or not it's your business alone.
---
They are fixed, but the spawn times aren't exactly predictable. Black lotus might have a few dozen spots in a zone, but only one is ever up at a time.  After it's picked another will spawn somewhere after an hour. It's still an advantage to know when it's going to pop, but not a guarantee you'll get it.
---
It will be horrible if you're on a server where rankers don't get along with eachother or some serious try hard people that want R14 in time for BWL. Each zone will have rankers farming everybody lvl 48+.

I really want a Resto Shaman but I've seen in multiple places that they assume a hybrid position instead of a full healer. I was really conflicted about it. It's not like I hate doing damage... Helping out with that low level target here and there is fine. The problem is being a DPS first and helping out with Heals second... That I don't wanna do.  
---
I've downloaded Retro WoW yesterday to try a defensive build using some enhancement talents and will probably try it out today. I believe alot of people might have done it already but I'm trying anyways.
---
Why not simply offer all of the skins available in classic? Give people the option between armored or unarmored. This isn’t retail with 600+ different mounts, it really wouldn’t hurt to have a few extra that already existed in the original game.
---
A private server is the equivalent of you reading a book, a whole lot, then trying to rewrite it years later from memory. It's not an authentic reproduction. Add to that, it's not just readily and openly available to the masses, so your player base ideas are horrendously flawed when trying to predict behaviors in the upcoming classic. 
---
Private servers arent hard to find, or play on, but they are nowhere near the real thing.  And the playerbase they support isnt close to representing what we will get in the official classic release. 
---
Stop lamenting problems that arent here. Stop parroting all the nonsense surrounding classic here, there, everywhere.
---
I enjoy dps and tanking, but healing is the most intense experience you can get, from level 18 all the way to Kel Thuzad at 60. Sure, it’s not always what I’d call *entertaining*, but you have to stay alert for when shit really hits the fan. 
---
The only time being a healer isn’t fun, is when you get healing Aggro and don’t play a class that has fade :/
---
Ooh I’ll be the one corpse camping FPs with stealth. I aim to become one of my servers most hated rogues. Friendly and helpful to all my Horde brothers, offering food and bandages while killing every Alliance I can. I want to live by red is dead.
---
I just be in the minority because I always hated the cata changes. Everything became linear and scripted.  We were no longer adventurers.
---
I guess it started in WotLK when we got conscripted into the alliance military and I immediately thought that was odd since we're supposed to be adventurers. Then then tirion started calling us "champions" and it just got worse and worse until Legion where we all became special snowflakes with our classes artifact weapons.
---
But yeah I always hated the linear questing progression that kinda started in wrath but went full blown in cataclysm. Killed any sense of adventure and wonder in exploring azeroth.
---
Each zone used to be littered with unique stories and people. Now it became all about us champions going from A to B and deathwing was involved in nearly every zone which turned out to be a disaster for continuity since Deathwing is now dead. 
---
The old zones were great because there was very idea instances where content became irrelevant because of lore development.
---
I compare pre-wotlk to TOS star trek where you go on a new adventure each week.
---
Post wotlk is like star wars where you have an epic saga you follow an entire xpac.
---
Wotlk itself is kind of the transition period between these two styles.
---
Just stick to the road.
---
Unlike BFA, roads are actually relatively safe in vanilla
---
While it will be "gank free" as there are no higher levels, there will be plenty of PVP at grinding spots.
---

Equally though, if you're casual then you're not really that serious or invested in the game (generally speaking). If you're not enjoying your experience, which you absolutely wouldn't if 2 out of your 3 hours of playtime is spent waiting 2 minutes to res on your corpse (make no mistake this will happen), I think this type of player will find it very easy to walk away.
---
&gt; There is debatable sidegrade stuff along the way, but if you have R14 and someone else doesn't, better for the guild for them to go to someone else.
---
So true.
---
"A Call to Arms"  It's from the Original WoW Soundtrack
---
The little Retadwarf though.
---
Actually, I'd expect to see the opposite. 10k concurrent players means that individual tryhard guilds have less of an impact on the overall health and atmosphere on a server. I know for a fact if my guild rolls on a server and there's not stiff horde competition, we'll completely destroy the other faction with this system. We pretty much accomplished that on ND just ganking players between battleground queues.
---
If anything, I think the motivations to rank will be even higher on classic than on pservers. The gear is stronger because we're getting the 1.12 gear off the bat - and it's real, it's finally real and permanent. So many players don't want to commit the time to the rank (around 1200 hours if you're br1 all the way from 0-14) due to the risk of losing their characters on pservers. It could all be a waste of time.
---
Equally, it's kind of irrelevant how good the guilds are spread over different servers, but there will be a top guild on every server, and a top guild will have players who want to rank, the gear is SO strong that early in its 1.12 state.
---
I'm very happy with all of that except for one thing: the 1.12 PvP gear will cause problems. The ranked sets received updates in 1.11 and was made to compete with AQ40 gear. Making them available during T1 is going to cause significant balance problems in both PvP and PvE.
---
The weapons are whatever, so few players reach R14 that it's not a serious cause for concern. The R12-13 set is much more accessible, however. You can get it in about two months if you play a lot, and in four months with more moderate playtimes focused on PvP. There will be a lot of players with full epic PvP gear long before raiders begin to get full T2.
---
That's what happened on N*st, and it was kind of a big problem that went under the radar because all everyone talked about at the time was how popular and overcrowded the server was. To those who tried to be serious about PvP, a huge issue began to crop up after a couple of months: suddenly the rankers had full sets of gear that was pretty close to T2.5 while raiders were lucky to have more than half of their T1. 
---
While the problem wouldn't be quite so stark in Classic since the rank system is introduced one patch after release instead of being there from the start like on most private servers, it's still something that's going to become a thing. People will begin to have full epic PvP sets 2-3 months after Phase 2 begins, which is either before or right around the opening of BWL.
---
This brings a huge gulf between the haves and the have-nots. It creates a situation where being competitive requires that you have it. There will be a stretch of months where this gear is by far the best available in the game, so both high-end PvP and competitive raiding will be heavily affected by it.
---
If, say, 50 guilds across the world have 20ish hardcore rankers, those will be the only guilds that can compete because their gear level is massively inflated all the way until the end of BWL when comparable gear has been farmed for long enough to even out the discrepancy.
---
This isn't something that's going to matter to 90% of players, but it'll matter a lot to the 10% that takes it most seriously. The rank system itself remains unchanged, according to Blizzard, so it isn't something that can simply be expected of all players. You can't tell someone that they don't deserve to be competitive if they don't spend 12+ hours a day for two months straight doing nothing but honor-farming, but that's what's going to happen, at least on the servers with a strong PvP scene.
---
R14 is a grind. That’s the way people want it to be so it has some prestige I imagine.

I hope most people feel the same way, or we’re gonna have a massive tank shortage in Classic. Hopefully people are more accepting and encouraging this time around.

I played WoW back in 2004 on a PVP server, spent all my time on retail WoW on a PVP server and never came close to experiencing the amount of toxic WPvP that I did on the vanilla player server.

Good luck leveling when the 60s are farming you for HKs. Enjoy those corpse runs back and getting murdered again while you try and heal up.

The faction imbalance is going to be the icing on the cake too. It will definitely kill servers just like it has killed player servers.

1 top guild on a server can't ruin it for everyone lol. Sure you can hold BRM or dire maul entrance or something, making it miserable for the people running through there, but 99% of the server pop won't even notice you as they are in other areas of the world. On 10k+ private servers with a way more hardcore playerbase and more guilds, there was enough people to continually camp a bunch of zones.

Ooh the red white and blue!!

**&lt;Kor Kron Vanguard&gt;** Semi-hardcore | PvE/WPvP | Server region: EU (NA welcome) | Server type: PvP | Faction: Horde
---
**Introduction:** If you're looking for some pre-BG PvP action or you're a PvE raider who's looking to put that gear to some good use whacking Alliance in the face with it, you're at the right place. Everyone earns their roles here, whether they're Social, Raiders or PvP-ers. 
---
**What we are looking for:** Players of all different schedules and backgrounds willing to be part of an amazing community regardless of how much time they have on their hands to play this game.
---
**What we are aiming for:** Clearing all raid content, acquiring all epic items and scepter and be one of the most respected guilds on the server. We aim is to be decent in PvE without tryharding and sacrificing the fun aspect of playing this game in order to spearhead the advancement of structured WPvP in the Classic WoW community. 
---
**What we expect of members:** 
---
As a PvE raider: Knowledge and desire to improve in your class, as well as getting to level 60 and able to raid within 8 weeks.
---
As a WPvP raider: Show up at 3/4 of our weekly WPvP raids. 
---
As a Social: Participation in various social activities. (recruitment, social events, writing a 5 minute report etc.)
---
You are free to choose any combination of those roles within our guild. Currently recruiting all classes. 
---
**Our Raid Schedule:** Current plan is min. 3 major raids per week. (1 WPvP raid + 2 PvE raids) with Loot Council. Additional details (such as raid times, spots etc.) will be handled after the game launches. The WPvP raids are not be mandatory, but they will provide an advantage as a Raider in ties against other players when deciding for loot. Our timezone will be around GMT+1. 
---
**Guides:** A thorough introductory guide to structured World-PvP to show you how we get things done.

Pretty sure it was 2-4h.
---
Most prealms have it around 30-60 minutes though. But then again, most prealms have populations that are 4x the original.
---
How can you have that PC at that time but not configure your screen properly? lolz
---
There will be some PvP but considering the players will be in smaller numbers, have no incentive to fight and are likely to be in some sort of 'we're both rushing lvl60 so let's ignore each other' this will be nothing in comparaison of what 'normal' players will have to face the day phase 2 is put in place.
---
Yeah I don't rush other tanks and try to help out new ones as much as i can, but some people are just hopelessly bad at it =(
---
If they had to delay the game I would just cancel my PTO and move it to the new dates :D :D :'D :'D
---
I have.  Back in TBC, and on a p-word server I'm on right now.
---
When you're in Hillsbrad Foothills and 60s are running around, there isn't much hope even in a group.
---
&gt; Can somebody anybody tell me why?
---
&gt;Hey, can somebody anybody tell me why we die, we die?
---
&gt;I dont wanna die
---
I think most of the complaining is a kind of sarcastic bittersweet complaining. After all, nobody is forced to play PVP. I’m looking forward to some wild PvP battles. I just wish DHKs had the option of turning off civilian combat, like the at war option, or I wish they would mute the severity of them. If you get 10 dhks, it should be -100 hks or so, not stop you from getting the next rank.
---
No changes would dictate that it show "World of Warcraft".  "Vanilla" was never used at the time.
---
While private servers aren't a totally accurate representation of what to expect, I agree that I think this will be the case under this system
---
Yep. It was an interesting take on it. I think Ill try it by lvling two warriors to 30 and comparing the /played.
---
I must be really misremembering because even 2-3 months sounds so fast to me to level one character to 60. If I had to guess, I'd say I took like 4 or 5 months to hit 60 on my rogue. And I played obsessively back then like most people did.
---
No, I haven't tried that one.  
---
I did try a razer naga back when they came out, but the plethora of buttons just didn't sit well with me. Got tired in my thumb and all.  
---
When it broke I went back to a "regular" mouse.
---
But OP's meme isn't about the average player.... it's about seeing the exception to the rule in Stormwind.
---
Thanks, Jagex! Very cool.
---
Depends on what you mean by casual I suppose. Getting buffs, enchants, correct resist gear, and consumables is still casual. If they're doing all that, using average skilled players in terms of knowledge of the encounters and their class, there's no reason they're stuck. They won't break records or clear before new content probably, but they shouldn't get stuck. I think those guilds might be...extra casual.
---
Yeah and there are places like Mara or WC where a bad tank won’t derail the run, but in dense places like Deadmines, SFK, or BRD, there is no hope.
---
Microsoft Inteli, I mean the one before Inteli 1.0 :) I still have it.
---
I've seen it happen myself. This isn't me musing a topic, I've actively seen it happen.
---
Unpopular opnion: I hope they change it so we don't get a long phase too, since in the  between honor system and bg's comming out was only 49 days and i love world pvp but i don't want 6 months of it :)
---
player servers should be private servers?
---
Yes Garithos dies in WC3, but I can't remember there being a single reference to him in the game. He was quite crucial to the plot of Warcraft 3 TFT. He is the sole reason why the bloodelfs left the Alliance and partly responsible for the Forsaken taking the Capital City.
---
Bringing characters back is such a lame way to write a story. If you bring back characters from death you make death not very impactful. GRRM understood this. This is one of the reasons why Game of Thrones is so beloved. I have no idea how many characters were retconned back to life.
---
Muradin not actually dying takes a lot of depth out of Arthas' story arc in WC3.
---
Because the prestige of having a limited availability mount was a part of vanilla.
---
For Vanilla it will be worth it. Downtime in raids and dungeons is better spent on the auction house/crafting/fishing/dueling on your other account.
---
Agree with you 100% Tribe.
---
I posted something similar and got downvoted to oblivion!
---
You should go on countdown to class to make the case!
---
Not me. I leveled at least 8 characters to max prior to wotlk, and I hated the new streamlined cata leveling so much that I literally never managed to level a new character to max ever again.
---
Honor update killed the world PVP, the moment you get DK's no-one wanted to raid towns anymore.
---
Sure pvp turned into small scale ganking, but i remember when there suddenly was no more TM/ratchet fights and thinking that the last update killed world pvp.
---
Hah.. I always loved the look of the Paladin Warhorse and the Charger, just looked wrong on a dorf. :(
---
I'd be tempted to say Paladin first because you're guaranteed that level 40 mount rather than sweating on making 100g (no easy feat, especially on a new realm with unstable prices and everyone is poor as hell.)
---
I guess it depends on whether you like tanking or healing (OFC you can DPS on both but likely you will find groups easier as non-dps.)
---
Also, probably was no help :D
---
Okay but what's the thing masking taped to the desk?
---
You are not wrong, I see value to the limited window. However, I do not think it would hurt at all for them to be available past the initial phase.
---
Yes, on private servers with 10k+ people and a way more hardcore playerbase. I've seen it too. It won't be nearly as bad on classic.
---
TBC.
---
If you say "no TBC" you're worse than the "no Classic" retail fans, because at least they aren't hypocrites.
---
I think that they are aware more than you think, Because it will be more painful to announce a risky release date and fuck it up while all took their vacations.
---
Xp rates for a lot of stuff are still wrong on LH ND. It's not a 30% difference for sure, but you can't just be seeing xp rates adjusted and assume everything is adjusted to vanilla rates. The other record times from pservers dont even show a video of the full run so we have no idea how legit it was. It can be a stupid and simple thing like lower armor on a type of mob that can cut down on times in grinding levels by a big margin. I doubt all respawn timers etc will be exactly the same. Graveyard spots might even be different,... I don't see anyone breaking down alot more time than 4 days played without any bug abuse or account sharing but we'll see.
---
I honestly have this low key fear of the vanilla severs moving onto BC. I don't know. I enjoy playing on vanilla with a 60 cap and I really wish it remains. I would love some kind of Old School Runescape approach to all of that. New content gets added, but that content is an alternate timeline.
---
Do you have a source?  Everything ive seen says it was an hour. 
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Black_Lotus
---
I think Ghost Mushrooms were needed for a couple things and def. had a demand and were not too wide spread.
---
I know I’m going to main Holy Pally, but I’m kind of stuck on my supporting alt. I’ve played a mage to 60 before and enjoyed it, but I also love the feel of warlocks. Or maybe I want to relive my Vanilla days and go hunter. 
---
So far mage feels like the obvious choice for an alt, but idk... still have 3 months to decide.
---
I was on stream with tipsout talking about it yesterday, think I got my point across somewhat. I think I might make my own video about it though and whack it on Youtube.
---
Thanks for the idea though :)
---
It all depends on server caps it will not be nearly as crazy as these private server boys think
---
Opened with hamstring
---
We might be a good fit for you if you're ok with a RP server: [https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/willingly-suboptimal-a-pve-recruitment/116449](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/willingly-suboptimal-a-pve-recruitment/116449)
---
Very much agree. Bad tank doesnt break the run if you have a team working to support the tank (cc right things and dps focusing mobs). Its a team effort.
---
Honestly they should poll the community for stuff like this.. just like they do in OSRS.
---
Release date
---
Progressive Itemization
---
Battlemasters
---
Right Click Reporting
---
RpPvP servers
---
How Sharding will be implemented exactly
---
Holy Pally does it well.
---
They should leave it up to the community at large to decide when to progress to the next phase. Poll the classic community (hide the results) and if 75% or more of the voters want to progress to the next phase after a reasonable amount of time, progress to the next phase.
---
You're probably the same person that would have said no classic servers 4 years ago. Absolutely no vision.
---
Classic cannot be Vanilla. Clowns like you that scream otherwise are going to ruin the game.
---
Miss worded. Only concern is lvl 60s killing a lower lvl over and over even if there's no reward other than feeling superior killing lobbies cause you cant beat people your own lvl. "Play pve then" yeah yeah yeah that's what all of those lvl 60s say.
---
If we get population densities per server that worked out as well as the first time around yeah.
---
I remember doing PUG MC's back when I was clearing AQ40 on my alts, but I just worry there won't be the massive participation in Classic that many on this sub expect.
---
There are a few hundred thousand players interested versus the millions that played originally.  I just worry Blizzard will find a way to fuck it up.
---
I work 3 twelve hour days a week. Gg no re
---
What did you so securely tape to the desk on the right like it was trying to escape?!
---
DHKs did kill city raids I agree with that. Things like fighting over/raiding grinding spots, fighting for world bosses, ambushing raids in Blackrock Mountain continued up until flying mounts.
---
Ok, you're missing the point.
---
One guild of hardcore players has MORE of an impact on a smaller server.
---
Sure if you want to nitpick. I've been calling them player servers since Ultima Online in 2001 tho.
---
Exactly. Such a bad idea, also players will just pick a few which will get overcrowded and many others will be low pop.
---
I wish this was my setup now. Looks so much cooler than todays laptops and machinery
---
It wouldn't be the end of the world but I think the vast majority of players would like them to only be available during Phase 1 or 2.
---
They said at BlizzCon that they may not plan phase release dates ahead. They’ll wait to see how the community is progressing through content and when people need something new.
---
TBC was my favorite expansion for sure. I've played them all but I quit early everytime before the next one came out. TBC was the exception though. I stayed for the entirety of the expansion till WOTLK came out.
---
It still had a mostly vanilla vibe with just new stuff in it like a true expansion should. The arena's were my favorite thing to do because the class balance had gotten a lot better. It was so cool for the first time see all the healing classes become good in pvp, and everyone still had those hard counters that you had to overcompensate for to win against. It wasn't perfect, but it was the best balance that wow has seen in my opinion, though I didn't even try arena post cataclysm really.
---
With that said, you're in for a treat with Classic I think. I put vanilla and TBC on near equal levels in regards to how much enjoyment I got from WoW during those times, with maybe vanilla barely edging out TBC only because I think it's really cool to level for the first time and get to see Azeroth actually populated.
---
It was a 1/4 inch jack for a guitar patch cable.  I would plug it in there for easy access.
---
Yeah I leveled 6 characters to 60 in retail and probably 5 or so on private servers. I'm not the fastest leveler obviously, but I don't spend a lot of time fucking around and my fastest times are still in the 7 day range.
---
I do like money... But it just looks SO boring only casting frostbolt in a raid environment
---
Damage. 
---
Tanks and healers are enablers. They keep us alive and protected. If they do there job, we can start doing the main job. Killing bosses.
---
As dps you have 1 job. Do as much damage as possible. Im rolling a mage so I will not be alone. Being one of the 8 mages brings out the competition in me. Being Nr. 1 dps in a group of 8 mages is the best feeling there is. Nothing against the other mages but being on top feels fucking great.
---
You generally don't have enough by level 40. What you can do is pick up skinning and just vendor all the leather. It sounds crazy but leather is not an in demand resource, especially on a fresh server, but it does vendor for a decent price. Even with buying all my skills, I still had just barely enough gold for my mount
---
Don't believe so no, but I could be wrong
---
I have to agree. Over time it became more fun for me to be the one standing at the back observing the whole situation and tossing heals to people.
---
Especially when you’re the lucky mage that gets Power Infusion.
---
Oh you sweet summer child.
---
The agro radius of a lvl 1 running through lvl 10-30 zones is massive. You practically pull mobs from the next zone over, much less mobs off the side of the road.
---
Oh god are you that guy that always goes afk just a bit longer than a full 30 seconds of drink lmao
---
Don't enchanters need timbermaw hold too for the agi enchant? Or that might be honored or revered instead
---
If you are the best, you deserve the PI.
---
No. 
---
Enchanting+ tailoring, the most common combo, is also the worst for making money. If you plan on investing a lot of gold AND time to get ALL of the enchants, and spam them in ogr/IF every day to build a big customer base, you wont turn it into a profit. 
---
Way better to take pretty much anything else, usually you spend like 1g/enchant as a fee. You can just level a alt to lvl 5 to get enchanting on it and use it to break down lvl 55+ gear you send over from your main, mainly greater eternal essences tend to be the bottleneck adn most expensive thing, pretty much everything else is not worth it, unless you plan to invest a lot into it.
---
&gt; I don't like to pvp. I don't like playing with bad guilds that don't require consumables. 
---
&gt; People will do AUTISTIC things for a small edge in video games.
---
You have to do it 6 more times today though.
---
Not so Newbie with 2 Ony bags
---
No they don't, that's incredibly dumb. One hardcore guild on a smaller server will have relatively more of an impact on the server compared to other guilds than a hardcore guild on 10k+ private servers do, but the overall impact will be way less. There will be less areas in the world being camped.
---
Two monitors, and I have typically raid lead in the past, so it is generally when I am waiting on other people.
---
You know, I’d never really thought about it that way. You make excellent points, and I agree completely. Have an upvote!
---
Due to ignorance not the honor system.
---
STVietnam
---
It’s something everyone should try. It’s too easy to say “wow, this healer let me sit at 30% for 10 seconds, what a scrub” without the context and experience that tells you *why* that is the case sometimes. If the tank dies, you all die, lol.
---
It will be interesting to see how that all plays out. I would love it if they were too rare to use for every raid, and went back to strictly high end progression attempts.
---
Im glad im undead and my friends not. If I rush I dont have to play with them and I can keep rushing till 60.
---
Sorry friends, Ill make alts and keep them in diffrent level ranges later on but first things first .
---
Not right now, but i did see it mentioned in some oldschool wow guide made before BC. Read it about a month or so ago.. ill see if i can find it again.
---
And the Moonkin Aura :)
---
So? You can still outrun and drop agro on them most of the time, since mobs are typically not right next to the road.
---
Yeah nah this ain't it
---
You know thats like the top post on this subreddit right? And i 100% agree with you. But if either of us made that post now we would get downvoted to oblivion.
---
Sure but how many people are going to be on that level on launch? My guess is a minority.
---
I had no idea tbh
---
Personally, that's exactly what i'm doing with it. Though it may be technically the same game I feel there will be a very different atmosphere to it as the player base has changed so much over the years. Rolling on horde might give it fresher feel for you. Plus we have bigger shoulder pads.
---
Yes i can a day i will be finally happy with blizzard
---
i have that worry as well. i'd be fine with adding tbc or osrs styled vanilla servers, but they need to be an actual addition; there must always be true vanilla available.
---
My wife wants to roll undead lock and I want to roll Tauren Druid...much longer run...and more deaths
---
How long is Sulfurus a bis for Ret and Enh? Does it beat out AQ and Naxx weps and is bis for all of Vanilla for them?
---
Not sure if anyone mentioned this yet but mountain dew has game fuel out right now that has flavors just like the warcraft game fuel. Or at least close to it and it's amazing. So grab some and stock up for release!
---
This will happen and then they’ll be like “there’s nothing to do in this game.”
---
That’s not badass though
---
This\^ is what would really fck you guys trying to take vacay
---
Blizzard is nasty
---
I don’t like PvP servers at all and I’m thinking of rolling on one. Mainly because I’m worried the population will be much lower on the PvE servers. I’m still undecided, but leaning towards PvP right now.
---
Damn, I think you just convinced me I need one. What better way to spend your time waiting for the wipe to recover than by jamming on guitar.
---
I have nothing to do between June 25th and September 1st. I really fucking hope the "summer release" comes early enough to give me at least a full month of greasy nolife WoW glory.
---
Or they tell you to play PVE so that you stop crying about a tiny detail like killing flight paths. It will always happen and when it does leave the game for an hour and come back most likely in my experience they won't be there anymore.
---
i honestly dont think that's going to be that big a problem. people come and go, that's life. just having a vanilla server that persists will keep the majority of the community intact. being able to take a break and come back to your same friends without having to worry about what new fresh bullshit they moved to while you were gone will, i think, do more than keeping people playing 24/7.
---
Mining is about the only thing that willl make you money in vanilla go that and enchanting making bank
---
This needs “Felwood” or “Blackrock Mountain” setting text
---
Tried finding it, but did not, however several sources from 2004-2005 seem to talk about 1h spawn time. Google is such a handy thing :)
---
Levelling underwater is such a deeply novel concept
---
I think the complaints will be justifiable if the faction balance is something like 70/30. People know what they’re signing up for with a PvP server, but it’s so much more unfair when you have twice as many people trying to gank as there are trying to help.
---
They’re being used to merc lowbies :D
---
That Microsoft intellimouse optical was so legit for its time though.
---
This is a video game, not a real life war. Preventing people from gaining XP isn't strategy, it's griefing. You're not bombing infrastructure, you're being a dick.
---
The great feral druid and melee hunter war of 2005
---
Pretty much on par with AQ40 gear. The R12-13 sets are more or less on par with T2.5 and the weapons ave C'Thun/Naxx quality. The ranked gear was updated in patch 1.11 so I think it's a pretty big mistake to make it available as soon as the honor system comes online. Before these updates, the gear was closer to T1.

---
There will be an economic crash the week of Classic launch. Everybody will be off of work, chained to their computer. Trade will come to a halt, and the world economy will regress to bartering.
---
I literally plan on it. A pvp character would be my secondary character as I've stated numerous times in this post. Which I wish I could delete cause I guess not as many people as I thought were concerned about the issue and I'm just being met with people like you who are being assholes about  it.
---
It’s going to be nice not having to worry about some high level swooping down from the sky on you when you get into altercations. 
---
I miss the days of mind controlling enemies into murlocks out there...
---
Member when we called it prebc?
---
Don't roll on a PVP server if you don't want to PVP. Alternatively don't level at a snail's pace and you'll be absolutely fine, will be a good few months before phase 2 even hits.
---
As a former war, druid and priest I can tell you that for 5 man dungeon you'll be fine with both of them, gearing is not an issue for both pre-raid, when you start raiding druid is left behind.
---
Speaking in the name of healers, I accept without a doubt a druid tank but I prefer a war
---
They'll have higher capital reputation only if they target there questing for the rep they want and don't just quest in neutral zones goblin towns like tanaris, winterspring, ungoro and other very popular questing spots....
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
The time spent leveling faster and being a higher level, having access to 60% mount will let you gather faster after level 40. You'd do way more in those 2 days at 60 than you'd do in the 2 days leading up to it.
---
A level 60 is going to farm more gold than a lower level, especially if your a class that can solo farm mara on release. They'll also be able to farm gear easier whether its from a max level dungeon or a low level one.
---
It's cool to play how you want, and reputation is a good reason to level slowly but imo you should do some preparation for it so you arnt looking for your factions quests.
---
Are you in this video?

Yeah that wouldn’t work if my character Garishevilyell was around.
---
And when the band plays "Hail to the chief"
---
So..? it should be zero people.
---
There's nothing wrong with keeping things balanced this time around, we have the power of hindsight now.
---
Have you ever actually tried running through a zone that significantly out levels you in classic? Trust me, you will get hit and you will die.
---
My favorite role was playing the puller in EverQuest. WoW never got that same ‘magic’ of trying to split things with feign death as a monk. 
---
The next best thing is tanking.
---
If you can still change it, a later day would probably be better. Like, early August. The first week of Classic will be a shit show. A glorious shit show, but you won’t get as much progress in. That would also help in the case Blizzard has a later release.
---
I don’t understand what you’re asking. You have the choice to play on a PvE server—and of course, also have the choice not to play at all. What you’re describing as hell, some like. Neither of us represent anyone else.
---
The stupid cultist robes from Silithus.
---
My favorite time (in terms of progression) was being level 50ish and walking into western plaguelands. Its the first zone of the last 10 levels and i remember thinking “this is the beginning of the end”, like starting the last season of a show, or the last movie in a series.
---
It really inspired me to play on.
---
I know they didn't deal with item levels in vanilla, but IIRC, GMC (2-h sword) is ilvl 78 while MC gear is like 65 and Naxx gear is ilvl 88
---
This was a very good tip at TBC launch. 9000 blood elves all trying to turn in the same quest items.
---
I'm forming a guild dedicated to upholding honor, and serving the community. We'll be taking out those kill teams as often as people will report them to us. Fighting the good fight. At least on our server.
---
Not in vanilla at least
---
The more you know :) thanks.
---
I don't recall if it exalted but yes that is a rep grind as well.
---
I'm not sure how people are planning on leveling so fast. Some people talk like they are leveling in a vacuum without anyone one else tagging their mobs, taking the quest objects, ect. 
---
We dont know about how they are going to handle dynamic respawns or if they are going to implement some form of sharding. We also dont know what the server cap is going to be, all this will effect how people are going to speed level.
---
I don’t think retail is worth 15/month. It is a more *fun* game in the sense that it’s faster paced, but nothing has any weight or meaning to it. 
---
Meanwhile, 15/month in Classic WoW will get you a character to build and invest in, and also a community of other real human people that you get to know, love or hate. 
---
The current game has changed so much that you have to try to be social and know somebody, but in older WoW, you’re kind of forced to know people and be friendly, since being a lone soldier in a challenging open world makes things harder for you.
---
Kargoz has a video where he suggests running to TB at lvl1 to get flight points to make your life easier down the road.  It also gives you a lvl of xp.  He shows a pretty easy path.
---
Not legit enough, MX500 &lt;3
---
Try the NE run through dustwallow.  Gators galore on the road.
---
Played rogue and hpaladin since 2004 to present; gladiator, hota, server firsts, etc. But my favorite roll would hands down be the druid FC in wsg.
---
It required so much more than any of the other classes, and you had SO MUCH outplay potential. You could literally carry the match. On nost, it was fun being known as one of the better fcs (honestly can't think of another alliance druid with equal gear/skill during the 1 1/2 yr played there) I'm sure a couple came before me, but not while I was playing and up to shutdown. While I was ranking, all the premades were throwing FAPs at me to play with them. I normally played with the EU premade, since they were much much better than the NA premades at the time. Even after finishing ranking, whenever I'd log on the EUs and NA groups would msg me for wsg queues. Getting invited to the "ex ranker ultra tryhard" group was fun too, since they always needed a FC on alliance side. PS. the NA tryhard group was a bit better than the EU group of ex rankers at the time, at least on alliance (fite me).
---
It was especially fun when the ultra try hard horde team would queue into us to slow our honor farm, but we'd end up breaking their turtle every time. They always queued with more cloth based classes, and we typically ran 3 hunters, so we sorta countered their comp by luck.
---
TLDR: I couldn't imagine anything being more fun than being a good fc in wsg.
---
Too bad it didn't last long.
---
I can't decide between Priest, Rogue or Fury Warrior. I also can't decide Horde or Alliance. One thing I can decide is I'll be Human or UD depending on faction.
---
I mained priest in vanilla and TBC originally and it was a blast, I like healing but I'm not necessarily sure it's the only thing I want to do. I had a Rogue alt who was super fun for PvP and I'd love to raid with one although competition seems very steep here. Fury warrior looks insanely fun in some videos I've seen, it's like a rogue on steroids, no access to tier gear makes me sad though as the mishmash of BiS warrior gear looks dreadful. :(
---
As of RN: I'm 90/10 in favour of Alliance over Horde, and 40/40/20 in terms of Priest / Rogue / War.
---
There are warrior and shaman trainers in both starting zones. So its just a one time walk for 15 min.
---
A small tip, run straight to Ratchet and swim to the east. Swim untill you are in Durotar and drown yourself. You will spawn at the graveyard in the orc/troll starting zone.
---
Not 100% sure where you have to die so maybe someone else has some recent exp in where to die.
---
Hahah yes! Oddly enough that was my next mouse when things started to get “serious.” I hated the MX Revolution though, that scroll wheel was terrible.
---
Can't believe I didn't know about that server. I've been trying to level each on Northdale but this makes it a lot easier to test things out. Hero!

---
Battlegrounds are what paved the way for x-server bs, arenas, badge gear, talent reshaping, and a host of other horseshit that contributed to the downfall of our beloved game.
---
No, battlegrounds should have never been added; more open world objectives should have.

On a pserver I achieved rank 10 twice.  It took me ~6 weeks to get from rank 7-10 with about 30 hours per week while managing a raiding guild and working full time.  It's hard to determine if that will be equivalent to classic servers, but I think it's fair to say that anyone can do rank 10 if you are consistent in your week to week pvp progress.  The difficulty for me was having to respec(50g each time) twice per week in order to join effective pvp groups and still be a top producer in raids.
---
It's possible.
---
That's some dedication bro. Horde or Alliance?
---
Trying to blame someone other than myself.
---
Member when we just called it wow?
---
There are many of us. Like four, or even more!
---
Or, crazy idea, introduce Bgs at the same time as the honor system, or very shortly after, problem solved :)
---
Sorry, post removed (Rule #7). Posts that only relate to Classic due to the title are generally removed.
---
The amount of honor earned isnt how you get ranked, its how much you earn compared to everyone else.  If wpvp is all thats available and youre crushing it you'll still rank up
---
"Last one standing wins.. hehehhuhuhah"

Tarren Mill vs Southshore was the OG Alterac Valley and will be again in phase 2

Honestly battlegrounds are cool but I kinda think the game was better without them.
---
Sorry, we remove posts that only relate to Classic by the title (Rule #7).
---
Ok, sure bro, on a 10k server one guild is like a drop in the ocean, but on a 2500 server a guild like that is a much higher proportion of the playerbase. This will naturally fluctuate server to server but the impact of a single guild is greater the smaller the server and it's absolute fucking absurdity to suggest otherwise.
---
5 days is extremely quick tho, only the top 1% will do it that quick. Honestly people saying 10 days are underestimating it.. the average player will probably spend somewhere between 15-25 days.
---
Start law school in August. I'm fucked.
---
Depends on if I'm ahead or behind the curve. Some people will get to level through STV fighting people just their level. How different that'll be
---
When vanilla originally launched I rolled on a PVE Server (Elune - US) and there was still plenty of world PVP that happened.  Just no real ganking.  People would still attack major cities, people would still do TM vs SS.  And more.  It just wasn't all out.. If your quest NPCs were being killed you just find something else to do with your time or go to an alt or just grind mobs. 
---
Being on a PVP server sounds fun but if all these people plan to just hide in instances to avoid the PVP, then I don't personally see the fun in PVP to be level 48-52 or something and just chain rolled by a group of 5 level 60s.  I'd rather spend my time doing dungeons personally.
---
Wow, somebody else said it already. You people are my kind of folk.
---
My first week:
---
Create all the characters I'll need. Bank alt, AH alt, main toon, main alt, and a second alt for much later, for both factions.
---
Get bank and AH toons leveled to 5 and park in a main city.
---
Get main alt and second alt to level 5 and park in an inn to accrue rested xp. Train everyone on relevant trade skills.
---
After my support team is created and situated, start my fantastic adventures with my main focusing on lvl 40 and lvl 60 mount and making lots of friends along the way.
---
Ooh, they point the cannon at you, lord
---
This isn't really Classic specific and has been removed, sorry. (Rule #7)

I'm going to level and play end game as a Balance druid. I know it's not optimal, but it is what I played when I started late vanilla. Played my druid for over 700 days and always mained Balance druid. Killed G'huun Mythic (Final boss, first patch BfA) as balance druid and stopped my subscription after.
---
I'll stick to what I know best and what I actually enjoy :)
---
Also, the less players on the server, the less players who need to be camped, if you have 50 rankers in your guild (a very real possibility) you can send 6 to every high level zone, WPL/Feralas/Ungoro/EPL/Winterspring/Felwood/Silthus/Burning Steppes/Blasted Lands/Searing gorge.
---
5 players in each zone will fucking overrun everything. Especially on a server with lower population caps.
---
You won't lose Titansflask though
---
Eff that.
---
BGs *sucked* before cross-realm. If there was a big faction imbalance (which was the majority of servers) then you sometimes had to wait hours to get in a BG. 
---
And when you did, it's usually because the side with the larger pop queued with a full premade with good gear.
---
There's nothing wrong with cross-faction BGs, it will take literally nothing away from classic
---
10 days is simply unrealistic for the average player. 10 days is expected for a casual player that already knows the quests and zones and then uses addons aswell. A fresh player or actual noob will probably spend between 15-25 days /played, if not more. The average player is extremely inefficient and will spend a ton of time doing bgs and spending gold on useless things on the AH.
---
You could just use a VPN to make WoW think you’re in the U.S. but (and I might sound stupid) id check on legality of VPN’s in the country you’re visiting. You’d also suffer some higher ping issues but then at least you don’t have to worry about the problem later on. 
---
HOWEVER, we still don’t know what the deal is gonna be with payment options. With retail BFA you buy either the NA version or the EU version, then pay the monthly sub. As far as we know right now classic is only attached to the monthly sub so it could end up being that you can play any realm EU or NA.
---
They are the same throughout whole vanilla, 1000g without any discounts (rep+rank3) for skill+mount.
---
&gt;the impact of a single guild is greater the smaller the server and it's absolute fucking absurdity to suggest otherwise.
---
Yes, like i said, its relative impact will be bigger. But the overall impact on the server will be way lower. Are you being intentionally stubborn/dense right now?
---
Posts that only relate to Classic due to the title are removed, this included. Sorry! (Rule #7)
---
ilvl doesnt really matter in vanilla though because the itembudget didnt dictate how good it was. For example: HoJ. One of the best melee trinkets in game due to how it scaled with other gear, yet its available from BRD.
---
Health and Mana potions, no limit on 1 per encountered and casters were balanced around using them every 2 minutes.
---
I'm not asking anything but explaining my experience with modern day Vanilla. 
---
   
---
WPvP usually ends up being so toxic that it causes a huge faction imbalance. Hell, right now on the largest pserver there is a 9% player imbalance in favor of the Alliance.  
---
Leveling Horde there is an absolute nightmare.
---
Where do you get that number? I spent 9 days on Nost when I tried to rush it, not doing bgs or anything wasteful, except doing a few extra dungeon runes helping friends. The average will be much closer to 20 days, for sure.
---
Daralon, my mom she bought me this new game AHHHH UHHHH
---
raid off
---
It doesn't have prestige, it just shows you don't have real-life commitments and you're willing to pay someone in China to pay while you sleep
---
I'am mostly talking about neutral faction rep etc. But in general you'll spend more gold when speed leveling and doing professions after than if you do them while leveling with very few exceptions.
---
For example fishing is a fixed cost skill. It doesn't matter if you are 60 or lvl 5 for leveling fishing. What does matter is that you can fish more opportunisitcally if you keep it up while leveling, meaning you look for schools/wreckage and night time fish etc. So the generated gold is higher in the end especially since you aren't specifically traveling to get the fishing skill up.
---
Then cooking, if you fish alongside it is super easy to skill up while leveling and you save gold from not buying food, plus the bonuses you get from cooked meats are quite substantial. We're talking about having an additional green item or upgrading a green to a blue item substantial. The speed leveler will need to buy food while leveling, which costs substantial amounts of gold in total and if he doesn't want to spend money on the AH he will have to store a large amount of meat on bank alts.
---
Now gathering professions are quite obviously way more convenient and efficient to grind up while leveling, because you just have to be a bit more aware with your routing and grinding spots. This is especially true for skinning but also for herbalism and mining.
---
Crafting professions are it's own thing. I would agree that most of them are not too time/gold efficient while leveling except on an already established market (3-4 months after release). However it is certainly efficient if you plan your grinding/questing routes in a way that supplements your crafting profession. This requires some serious planning though.
---
The thing with speedleveling to 60 with only first aid is only more convenient, not necessairly more effcient except if you have a very efficient solo grinding plan afterwards that relies mostly on vendoring items like mara runs as a Hunter or similar, but for most classes this is not feasable. Not to mention that for many classes, pre-raid BiS and pvp item farming/quests start in their mid to late 40s.
---
I once enchanted a shadowstrike and a mining pickaxe with crusader, I don’t know which one was more useless?
---
just Play on our NA server.  
---
when you are back home, you want to play on your own region.
---
What did the poor swede had to do to get inside?
---
We are New Englanders, so the time zone will be EST on a PvE server.
---
Right now we are leaning toward Horde too. I have only ever raided as Alliance, so maybe a change in faction would be nice. 
---
I bet Onxyia will be more of a challenge without the fear ward. I have a vague recollection of many wipes due to the tank getting feared or unlucky deep breaths.  
---
I remember holding my breath when it was my turn to fear ward to make sure I clicked the button at the exact right time. I remember my heart pounding as we all ran like chickens with our heads cut off as Onxyia flew above our heads and reigned down fire from above. I remember everyone racing to kill those welps before they killed us. It was an adrenaline rush.  Even on our 50th kill there was still something magical about that dance. 
---
I know many people feel Vanilla raiding is easy or not a challenge.  I haven't raided since like 2009, but I remember it being quite a challenge and that the challenge is what made it fun.  I do get the whole idea of practice makes perfect. It's not just better gear that lets your raid one shot her every week. Your raid becomes like a well oiled machine. You make sure you don't include the unreliable priest in the fear ward rotation. You put the stronger AoE healers on the Mages/Locks so that they stay alive and welps go down fast. You have that super skilled secondary tank keeping a watchful eye on what is going on in case he needs to jump in. Everyone becomes practiced in the fight mechanics and how to overcome them and then it becomes "easy".  
---
I hope we can find that magic again in classic. When your heart races in hopes that the tank doesn't get feared into the raid. When you worry if the raid has enough DPS to finish her off before another round of deep breaths. When you struggle to find the path that brings 40+ people together to get stuff done.  
---
I feel like a lot of the vanilla mechanics were straight forward, but they were more mmo like. It was less about the individuals ability to jump out of fires and stand in the correct space at the correct time and more about how a group was performing together as a whole.
---
"Why are they forcing me to grind all this shit? The content is piss easy as it is..."
---
Not me, I base all my knowledge (read: lack of knowledge) on only managing to get to level ~43 before TBC came out. Also, I was like 12 and only discovered the talent system at around level 40 lol
---
Always go afk (make sure to logout) at first boss try.
---
Totally agree.. Monk pulling was the bee's f\*cking knees... Bard was a close second, on the 'fun' scale.  I miss EQ at times.
---
I don't like country specific guilds only because I'm jealous coz scandinavians are the chillest people to play with. Feels bad man
---
This dungeon as a whole is so incredible. Hidden bosses everywhere. Different settings behind every corner. It's just so well made!
---
I'll be competing with you for that "top Mage" ranking, boiii
---
I really love this. I can hear this and it speaks to my unrelenting undead spirit.
---
Shit the old ones much cooler. U can’t just remove two heads.
---
I'm still torn.... 
---
Priest - been playing since vanilla every xpac. my true main spec.  achieved many things on priest (US pve top 10's as shadow, r1/gladiator as disc)
---
Hunter - been playing one since vanilla but very off and on.  Love just chillin on a hunter and killing shit.  might just pick for the fun leveling experience &amp; BG's.  I look forward to outplaying noobs in bgs and hunting noobs down in wpvp. aim shotting in shadowmeld is extremely satisfying
---
mage - i've played a mage for a few months at a time in previous xpacs.  I love the idea of making food, being able to port and being super versatile in any pvp setting.  going caster as a main would be soemthing very new to me (besides when I played shadow for a while).  but I'm worried about there being too many mages.  gnomes are cute af
---
Just give me a robe.
---
Be more specific on what classes, for warlock felhunter and succubus quest is not worth as you travel felt all day long, warrior whirlwindaxe is totally worth the effort, but not sure if it‘s implemented on launch (also it‘s quite hard to obtain on a fresh server)
---
Depends on the class ofc.
---
You obviously dont skip druid quests to get new forms.
---
You can skip the mage quests that just gives robes.
---

---
Are we still talking about the barrens run? Because I assure you there's hardly any mobs close enough to the road to be of any threat to you. Maybe an occasional wandering raptor, but luckily you can see them from a mile away.
---
Yeah, they ruined it in MoP when they brought in this new serpent head model, and remade some old dungeons. It's the same model used for Megaera in Throne of Thunder. 
---
I think it looks hideous.
---
That's true for other expansions as well though, like CoF during Legion which was a must-have for melee DPS
---
I lived in the UK throughout vanilla and the only hard thing was raiding. I had to stay up until like 4am raiding and be at work at 7. Glad to say I will not do that again.
---
The free aspect may contribute somewhat to the behavior I saw, but I think lack of moderation was a more important factor.  A little bit of evidence for this: I briefly played on a well moderated server "The Rebirth" and its atmosphere was more like retail, maybe even better than retail.  But it was a much smaller server too.
---
bringing my cat trees into the gaming room so atleast I wont be forever alone gg

- Armorless epic mounts
---
- RP-PvP server at release
---
- Progressive Itemazation

This is what I was leaning towards but have no experience using a VPN for gaming and am expecting speeds to be throttled.
---
That's crazy about the NA/EU versions. Things are weird now.
---
Yep. The number of people seriously trying for R14 will be tiny, the number of people that *get to* R14 will be even smaller. The rest of us First Sergeants will just be playing *The Most Dangerous Game* in STV &gt;:)
---
Im sorry? Both versions have gear as the main and most important way of upgrading your character.
---
Both versions have the Rank13/14 gear be absolutely brutally good for players for most of the game.
---
Both versions have the honor system implemented the exact same way (Because despite what you claim, most of Vanilla is very well documented) which means the grind is going to be roughly the same.
---
And most importantly. Humans play both versions of the game. There is nothing fundamentally different between the way that would give us any reason to think player behaviour will deviate from how it is on private servers. Players will want to get to rank13/14 in both versions because of how powerful the gear is, and players will always choose the path of least resistance to do so, which happens to be camping the most populated areas until they cap out their honor for the week.
---
You seem to completely miss the point here. Private servers could be exactly the same as Vanilla or they could be very very different. It really doesnt matter. What matters is that the honor system in both give some of the best items available, and players really really want those items are and willing to maximize their honor gains to achieve their desired rank.
---
There is nothing fundamentally different between then two in terms of how players approach the honor grind.
---
That's the feeling I'm getting.

Dude, this must be a really crappy hunter. He's basically auto attacking you while you screw his pet up. He's not calling his pet back, or healing him etc
---
It’s something people will have to grind for. You honestly sound like someone who has no idea what they are talking about and didn’t actively play vanilla. Do you know how hard it will be to get that high with no organized pvp? I’m not saying impossible, but it’s not like even 1% of people will do it.
---
The point of classic is to be, content wise, as close to vanilla as we can get while being only able to go off of 1.12.1. One thing they can do is gate content, which they are doing, but they are still keeping it around when it came out patch wise.
---
They are adding incentive to get structured world pvp going and gang squads.
---
You are vastly overestimating the effect this gear will have.
---
Think really only 2 things we NEED to know are # of servers / pop and timeline lengths. 
---
Timeline length may vary which is why they haven’t stated about it.
---
Then obviously release date.
---
*but the target rich environment tho...*
---
I was curious about all classes. Do fresh start levelers plan on getting whirlwind axe knowing it will only last 5 levels or is it to difficult to solo so they skip it?
---
***consecration*** ***bubble*** panics ensues
---
5 people ganking every high lvl zone is a lot better than 20-30 people ganking every high lvl zone like it was on huge private servers instead. I don't think 5 people running around EPL is gonna be as bad as you claim for the people there, especially not if there is some semblance of faction balance where the opposite faction can oppose them. I'm sure it will get frustrating at times, but it'll be way more easily avoided and less frequent that you run into rankers when you're just doing your thing in the world, compared to the huge private servers.
---
it will be more like:  
---
M-I-C, K-E-Y, M-O-U-S-E MICKEY MOOOUSE \*mickey mouse\*

as we maniacally gun down some priest slowly farming with holy smite
---
I never feel bad about attacking someone who is red. Red=Dead
---
People still call it wow, prebc was a term used for an extremely short time
---
This is probably the best way to handle this, I'd personally love to see the old models return for a short time. Also puts a lot of incentive in early engagement and commitment
---
&gt; Some people talk like they are leveling in a vacuum without anyone one else tagging their mobs, taking the quest objects, ect.
---
Well, if you really rush the first levels, you'll basically be alone on the higher level areas. The first levels will be the hardest

---
They are carebears that's why.
---
Top progression guilds will end up buying off the competition (or at least, attempting to do so) in order to time the buff for their own raid.
---
U should just go shaman and chain heal bitches, boost melee dps, reduce threat, and basically be desired as all horde raids want a lot of shamans. Then you can go pvp elemental and blow faces off with ur raid gear. Gives a very interesting play style in pvp at 60 that really demands a lot of awareness and an interesting way of support. It’s like an offensive healer which is real fun when you start clicking on all aspects of purging totem dropping shocking healing occasional lightning bolt etc.
---
The game is technically how it was but the meta is not. Only the meta matters.
---
... no you aren't. What the fuck? Who upvotes this shit?
---
Axes outperform any set of swords on an Orc Warrior.
---
I would agree on everything but not beautiful graphics.
---
The trend with short attention span, "free" to play games started with League of Legends in my opinion.
---
Typical comic artstyle. Mobile Games aswell are very colourfull and simple comic arstyle same as Fortnite.
---
Kids cant afford 40 inch 4K screens with a 2080 ti.
---
If graphics were important, Battlefield V or Star Citizen would be much more relevant then they are.
---
I think the only issue is where does the line get drawn for something like this. I'd love TBC and think it was a great expac, but if they do TBC then you now have the people saying "well now they HAVE to do wrath, that's the best WoW!" and has the potential to divide the community.
---
Yes but look at what happened... 
---
Hunter Pets, much like an infected animal IRL would enter a populated area. People rapidly get infected with a number of oblivious people who took flight points, portals, hearthstoned etc and this infection RAPIDLY spread. 
---
You then had level 60's (who represent the healthy adult population) who were able to sustain, fight off and survive while those who were lower levels were affected horrifically by the infection (representing the vulnerable populace, such as young children and older people) this meant that the demographic was actually quite accurate as simulations go.
---
What was even bigger was the way that people began to react to this. People steered clear of major populations, they started shuttling people through the cities to avoid infected while healers (the physicians) worked to cure the problem.
---
Sure there were inconsistencies with Real Life, such as the fact that people could respawn mainly and people spreading the infection on purpose, but these people were so few and far between, and the major cities so tight nipped that it was of little difference by the time this started happening. 
---
There is a reason why it was used as a Case Study by the CDC.
---
I love to tank, idk why, maybe cause i like to take the lead, mark all stuff for the group and make it their best experience they will have in the game for a smooth run, doesn‘t matter if it‘s a 5man, 20man or 40man raid in classic! 
---
I‘m also always flattered when ppl tell me i‘m the best tank they had in decades 😄
---
And also a big point for me, i hate not finding a tank and look for one 30+ minutes! 
---
I‘m also happy in a supporting role and don‘t need to top the meters on raids, i did that in tbc and wotlk. 
---
Tanking simply is my blood!
---
I disagree, its better when something is decided for the players instead of by the players.
---
It has confused me that you've used a full stop, but not a capital letter.
---
8 months is to long, I think the game needs Battlegrounds within 4 months after release.
---
No I had broadband by 2005
---
What is wrong with the raid release schedule ?
---
Nope, these people are the people that's always doing something. Farming BiS, farming gold, leveling professions etc
---
When *popular private server* opened about a year ago I decided to practice the exploration leveling route, so I could skip the crowd at the Valley of Trials and also to practice it in case I would need it for official WoW Classic.
---
As an Orc it took me about an hour to do the exploration path up to level 4 and you end up at Mulgore. 
---
It's not the most efficient thing, but it's honestly not bad. The biggest problem was arriving in Mulgore at level 4 with the starter weapon and no money. The first quests in Bloodhoof are pretty rough as a Warrior until you kill a few mobs and are able to afford the axe from the vendor there. As other classes it should be slightly less of a problem, but you'll have to scrape together your pennies for the first few spell upgrades.
---
So no, not much of a problem. Decide which one of you will run the exploration route, and you should both meet up around level 4 at either Bloodhoof or Senjin Village. If the Warrior does it you have the advantage of meeting up in Mulgore which should be less populated, and the Shaman can save some extra silvers to buy the Warrior a weapon upgrade. Or the Shaman can do the run and you can start doing the Senjin/Razor Hill quests.
---
Think of that all by yourself did you?
---
I watched that stream, you all had some great points about how different things will be this time around. People know the meta, they know how to efficiently grind out honor without BGs. And that doesn't lead to epic raid fights. It was depressing however seeing how many people in the chat just didn't understand your point and how that this wont lead to great world pvp. It'll be the opposite. If there's a mass exodus of players because it's impossible to level that'll kill classic fast. Please DO make a video on the subject so that people might understand. Blizzard so far is doing a great job of turning back the clock, but what they can't do is remove all that knowledge that people have accumulated over the years. That knowledge will make a huge difference compared to back on 2004.
---
Agreed, it will take 4 months for a normal player (the hardcore college kids from back in the day now have work and kids also)
---
me
---
So a tremendously different overall population will have zero effect on how people will behave?  Ok, cool. You some kind of scientist or are you a clairvoyant?
---
Yeah I think it should be 6-8 weeks after release.
---
Better have a ret pally with SoR for nightfall - it seems the uptime is better
---
Geez where were you living that that was the case in 2004?
---
Depends, 2500 player cap will be interesting.
---
The XP rates are like in vanilla and the quest XP is very close. Something that definitely boosts the leveling times is the talents. Also just being able to pull multiple mobs because we are better at the game and don't play with 200ms latency. Even in Joana's vid the server sometimes bugs out and crashes or he dies because of a bad pull. 
---
Account sharing won't affect your /played. Something that definitely will is your rested time. So if you want to get a very low /played then you can do it slowly over a month or so to get maximum rested XP. Some of the speed levelings I've seen on private servers do this.

---
Usually whirlwind axe you easily can use up to level 60, there is no other axe for a warrior till arcanite reaper. And you always want that 5% cc.
---
If you don‘t level arms, well then you also can go for other weapon types, and okay alternativ for whirlwind axe drops of herod, but you sometimes have to cancel the procc. 
---
As mentioned above warlock pet quests after voidwalker are a time waste, on the other classes i don‘t have enough experience 🙃

Eh - toxic players are usually blind to how self destructive their habits are. Drive people away from PVP servers by camping them? Fewer people to play with.
---
Yeah, thats exactly why I love to tank dungeons. I'll have a warrior that never reaches 60 because they'll only do dungeons every now and then, but I feel like tanking raids is a whole different experience. Too much competition for me, probably.
---
They removed PVP servers from retail?
---
How does everquests version of classic work? Forgive me if they don't run classic servers, I am ignorant of that game.
---
Ooh yeah it would be nice to know they aren't doing crbgs, at least until closer to phase 6 or as dying servers need them.
---
The others are already confirmed right? We aren't getting progressive itemization, nor rp-pvp server at launch. 
---
I think we can expect the armorless mounts, due to the fact we are getting content phases, and the mounts are separate items from the armored ones. This means they aren't subject to "progressive itemization" since they are entirely different items.
---
I forgot to send my reply to this. Thank ya!
---
OP just cast Bloodlust on this entire sub.
---
If you're going to invoke a TBC spell at least wait until Classic comes out first.
---
Well yes, the assumption all these posts make for /played is "assuming you spend that time questing at reasonable efficiency".
---
Actual /played to 60 can range as high as you want it to if you stop levelling to do other things. 10 days /played of questing, assuming you're not constantly getting lost, is a fair estimate for casual players.
---
😭
---
You can be correct while at the same time making an irrelevant point. And I say irrelevant because there’s no actionable step to take—and for some, there’s not even a problem to discuss.
---
I’ve heard most of them are pretty cool, and that’s worth more then just skipping them, in my mind.
---
however, on a smaller server the impact of 5 players is equal to the impact of 20 players on a server 4x the size, you see what I'm getting at?
---
56k wow sounds like a horrible experience
---
Get a life man and stop replying to every comment and just go play on a PVE server like everyone else has already suggested. It wasn't a problem 15 years ago, and won't be a problem when it launched.
---
The ability to auto open mail. The ability to click the item you want to send instead of dragging. The ability to send more than 1 item at a time. These are functions add-ons for a long time added in but they're now standard in retail. Since the add-ons will exist, Blizzard may as well make the functions default.
---
That was a good one. :P
---
Yeah dude sort by top all time. It was 3-4 months ago.
---
Not at end game. Most groups bring, what, 3 tanks?
---
For raiding you need to be there 99% of the raids for your guild, otherwise they have no return on investment to gear you and take you as MT or 2nd tank. 
---
If you are commited and good at tanking you don‘t have issues to find a MT spot, especially during mc and bwl.
---
Axes for orcs would outperform swords, if there were any...

Well realistically a lot of people were already 60 when tbc was launched.  So if they were to piggy back off of classic into tbc, why would I have to level another character to 60?
---
I agree that making it easier to level hurt the game, but that really does not apply to this situation imo.
---
I didn’t lose them because, I vanished when the MT and OT died.
---
However, /gquit is in mind because we wiped on trash with full buffs, which is mad bad.
---
Well pservers aren't going anywhere. I don't think Blizzard should change anything to appeal to the pserver audience. If they don't like what Blizzard has to offer, they can unsub and come back later.
---
I think you should level by yourselves until you reach the Barrens.
---
You'll be playing for years together, It wont kill you to not quest together on the first week.
---
Aww I spent about 10 minutes clipping and adding the music.
---
Would it be more acceptable with captions for future reference?
---
A little sad given https://i.redd.it/zx126o35g6r21.jpg probably took 5 seconds whereas this took a few minutes.
---
It blows my mind I've read many times that using a VPN will hurt your ping, and read about equal times that it will make your ping better. I hate the fucking internet
---
Sorry, did I miss a post where someone else had all the exact same ideas?  If so my bad, I'm just putting my ideas out there.
---
Guild Banks seems to be a popular topic still
---
you missed about a hundred of them
---
Sorry my low effort meme is not to your liking.
---
Sorry, I must have missed all of the posts where others have said all of this already.
---
But fishing with dynamite sounds way better than fishing with a pole.
---
Through their play style
---
This was the best.  Battlegrounds were a needed and positive addition to the game, but the way they killed World PvP was a negative side effect.  I kept hoping Blizzard would find a way to promote World PvP again, but they never did - the world objectives were an abject failure.
---
Oh man, better hit 60 before phase 2, or get camped at every flight path 50 and above by no lifers farming honor
---
This probably won't be an issue for a while, until random pugs are allowed to free-roll on Ony head - but it will likely be the case later on.
---
Unless Vanilla pops plummet I don't see Blizz wanting to lose the same fight twice
---
But it isn't though, those 20 people can cover a larger area of any given zone, it doesn't matter if theres 1 guy next to you or 3 guys next to you, you'll all get slain when they find you, and with more rankers, you will have a larger chance at any given time to run into them.
---
Sorry, grind :)
---
That paladin hammer if you can get BFD done early, man is it fun for a while.
---
Nope, no update on that yet.
---
This
---
Good troll
---
Not really.  Large-scale World PvP typically happened in 20-40's zones.  STV, Hillsbrad, Duskwood, Barrens, etc.
---
I can’t imagine it would ever help your ping. I don’t know a lot about VPN’s but in my head I imagine it like this
---
You are here at X
---
You connect to Y (in your country)
---
VPN makes you think you are at A
---
You connect to B (in another country)
---
I would imagine that being MUCH further away you would have increased ping no matter a VPN because all it would do is trick whatever you’re connecting to into thinking you’re somewhere else. I think of all the Aussies I used to play on ps’s with that had super high ping all the time, and I don’t understand how a VPN would help with that...
---
The comment was made as an alternative to character transfers, so it would be a fresh realm. If you can't think of a single reason you shouldn't have to level a character to 60 on a fresh realm then I don't even know where to begin.
---
Even the world record for solo speed leveling is right around 115 hours, IIRC. It was a Hunter, on a non-fresh server too.
---
We'll likely be seeing the first few 60s at the end of the first week.
---
Negatory.  World PvP in the 50+ zones didn't happen nearly as often.  Generally, World PvP happened in the lower level zones so that accidental mob aggroes wouldn't be a factor.
---
This is mostly only true on private servers due to the price fixing
---
reminder that battlegrounds were just as effective (probably more) at killing world pvp as flying mounts
---
stay woke 1.12 babs
---
Well there are literally hundreds of posts on this topic, so maybe try using the search function?
---
I dunno, Ony is pretty easy with 16 debuff slots.
---
Dialup was long dead already
---
No, it will just reward people who rush to 60.
---
If they are in the game, they should be in the game the entire time.
---
This 100%.
---
Classic is once in a lifetime. There is no redo. If we get a shit launch and people bitch and quit, say goodbye to future support.
---
Did some googling of old forum posts from 2004-2005, seems like the resspawn was actually one hour.
---
I can't speak for enhancement shamans, but Sulfuras is BiS for Ret paladins for pve until Naxx, Corrupted Ashbringer or Might of Menethil. The latter of the 2 Naxx 2handers is obviously BiS for pve. However, I would argue that Dark edge of insanity from AQ40 would be better for clearing bwl/mc since most of the bosses are immune to fire, and you would essentially gain an extra % of crit chance and possibly more with world buffs.
---
I doubt they know. They probably have the phases ready to launch whenever the community wants them, or whenever progression hits a particular point.
---
That's what Psychic Scream is for. XD
---
Will the main tank leave first?
---
&gt;People should only make threads I agree with
---
Oh no 3 months of world pvp.,...
---
It won’t be the end of the world. It won’t be as bad as you think either.
---
hundred? That is a pretty conservative estimate.
---
I would think verigans fist would be a great item to get but on a fresh server it may take up too much time to be worth it. I know the dps is higher than any other weapon at 20 for sure. The sfk part is what really throws the time off tho Bc getting a group for that can take too much time. Deadmines u can just do at 20 for ur first time with all the dm quests, and the BFD part you can probably find just one pala buddy to duo mobs outside the instance. Loch Modan easy too. 
---
If the stars allign for you when trying to complete that quest then go for it. You’re going to have to run to south shore eventually anyways so getting those fps is not considered a time sink imo.
---
Meeting a great friend dueling outside of Darnassus.  We "clicked" over our both surprisingly high skill level and trading wins in the duels where we were both used to stomping everyone.  Flash forward and we've been playing wow together for 12+ years and have met IRL 4+ times.  We're both working on our masters degrees now but still find time to play here and there
---
It wasn't many places. They build WoW up around the idea that some people were gonna play on dial up.
---
Imagine the MT is trolling the raid and wipes it.
---
I mean... it was kinda obvious
---
Open world PvP is the tits, but I enjoy BGs. That said, I would like it if battlegrounds weren’t always open. If there were a call to arms once or twice a day for a couple hours where people could enter the BG of their choice—at least for WSG and AB. The rest of the time would be spent in the world. AV in the open world where bosses and objectives spawned on a timer would be my jam, too.
---
I like how the "this is giving hardcore players to much of an advantage" is already starting. The salt on the battle.net forums is going to be so marvelous.
---
Fine then add the option to start at level 1.  If you wanna level from 1-60 do it on the Classic Realm.  It sounds like you game is racing on fresh realms.
---
The launch patch alone would be impossibly long on a dialup connection.
---
A speed leveler probably wouldn’t go for whirlwind unless he is working with a team. Even then somebody can probably crunch the numbers and show it’s not worth it. You’d probably have to wait around 40 to farm everything and have a chance at the elite.
---
This and the zombie event were my favorite events in wow. Blizzard nerfing things like this was dumb they should have introduced a "cure" instead of just breaking the function that allows this to happen.
---
I'll only have enchanting on my bank alt lol
---
I played DPS in Vanilla, then Tank and healer until i quit in Cata. I really liked all the role :  
---
- As a tank, specially if you're the MT, lot of thing depends of you. Positioning is a whole dimension higher in difficulty when you have to also build threat, and stay alive. It's a a role filled where you have a constant pressure, because even on a single pack of trash mob, the whole group can wipe if you are not completely attentive.  
---
- A Healer is more playing a constant tycoon game, where all the bars on your screen have to stay high. It's really rewarding to successfully heal a group without having to drink because you used wisely all your tools.   
---
- But in my mind, nothing beat the pure adrenaline rush of doing a DPS race to the top of the DPS meter. Because you know doing this, you put yourself in danger. In Vanilla, i played Spriest in end game raids, and the first mind blast of a boss fight was always a prayer for it not be a crit, because then the threat would largely overcome tank abilities. But it was also one of the largest DPS spell in the game (short cast time, great damage, on a CD). Then, the earlier you did it, the higher you will finish in the DPS meter.
---
Ooooo I totally misread the post.  You are 10000% right.  Sorry about that
---
Thanks that's good to know. I doubt I'll ever have enough gold or raid often enough to get it but now I know I'm not missing out on too much.
---
I wonder if there is somewhere I could find a PDF of it?
---
that mouse, i swear everybody had it
---
Nae bother pal.
---
Dialup with 56k wouldnt diconnect the line if you where called.  
---
The caller would hear a Line busy tone  
---
Only if you pick up your phone for to long, it would disconnect
---
&gt;Plus we have bigger shoulder pads
---
Well that's me convinced!
---
I will actually think about this though as you fulfil all my criteria, which was: UK-centric, PVE focused but on a PVP server (I feel PVE servers reduced immersion), raiding twice a week and an expected time around 2 months to level 60.  A\*
---
No thanks, I"ll never play on a PvE server.
---
Unfortunatelly my recent found group of players on a private server are considering rolling on a PvE one, so I guess I'll have to make new friends.
---
WW Axe will actually last to the 50s. But, my plan is that if I have a certain amount of gold by 30, I’ll buy the components on the AH, and get a Shaman to help me duo it.
---
Fair enough, is this down in the rules somewhere where I could have read this?
---
phasing out but not dead. DSL was becoming more the norm with a few people have RoadRunner cable broadband or whatever your provider called it.
---
On pservers the pvp system and bgs are at launch. In phase 2 people will literally be ranking 100% by ganking people because there will be no bgs
---
&gt; why rush the content
---
Because people will get bored and unsub if they have to sit and farm Molten Core for 7 months before BWL comes out, and then farm BWL for 7 months before AQ comes out.
---
Hail to the Warchief!
---
I personally think if you they start releasing the other xpacs you would have to start in classic, transfer to tbc then to wotlk, and so on.  That would be the only way to really do it imo.  If you want a free max level character play retail.
---
I agree, Blizzard should be applauded for their efforts this far, they have by and large listened to their community. This is one of the first mistakes I feel like they're making.
---
I don't think its going to be as bad as you claim. 
---
You get ganked and camped a few times, call all your friends and guildies and roll up on the perpetrators and give them a taste of their own medicine. I had a geared NE warrior in Vanilla and lived for this shit. Bring my druid friend Aleo (shout out to a legend who i haven't talked to in years) for the heals and roots and we would go to work.
---
If you quit the game because you are getting camped or owned by some more geared people, you're weak spiritually and don't deserve to get to 60 and gear. Its part of the grind. Pay your dues.
---
The point is they should never, ever offer level boosts at any point in classic, to anyone. It goes completely against the classic spirit and it's the sort of bullshit we saw in the garbage expansions.
---
If they did TBC they'd let people copy/transfer their characters, or it'd be everyone starting from scratch. That way you don't end up with a server full of level 60s who have no idea how to play their character and a completely messed up economy.
---
If it's not a big deal to have the upgraded set going into BWL then it's not a big deal to have the unupgraded one then either.
---
If anything it shows I *did* play vanilla. I know it's flaws - and the time-grind reward for PvP was always a problem because PvP is inherently competitive.
---
Gear imbalance and time-grinds affecting PvP outcomes over skill were always a problem, and not really needed when you can instance the PvP.
---
It's going to continue to be a problem in classic - personal ability is secondary to your skill level
---
Then what? Think they will release “ fresh “ servers?
---
it works, ive been leveling a warrior on a pserver.
---
Yep. And I've noticed my playing get better on other roles too since I wont tunnel vision so hard anymore.
---
These posters are talking out their ass. The Barrens run is easy. Actually, all walks between starting zones are easy for the Horde. Night Elves are fucked tho
---
Now! Let's get down to business... to defeat... the Horde!
---
I do not mind not making much progress if I can experience the glorious clusterfuck launch and see how sharding fails miserably lol.
---
If they keep the same functionality from retail, there will be an "interact with target" keybind that will open dialogue with the NPC. 
---
We'll see.
---
Oh look! Bubble hearth land!
---
It sure depends on the class you play and the route you take.
---
The last char I leveled was a priest that I leveled with a friend and we did lot of dungeon and Wpvp so I was near 40 days of /played when I hit 60.
---
Before that I leveled a hunter, rushing to 60 to get to raiding and it took me 8 days with a few dungeons and doing profession. Playing only on week-end so I had lot of rested exp each time I logged.
---
Average will be closer to 20 days, I agree with that. I'll take my time when classic launch and don't think I'll hit 60 before 25-30 days of /played
---
He's a hardcore carebear
---
"EVERYBODY knows that I'm GREAT!" 
---
*Some president probably*
---
They are all pretty cool flavor and the rewards are always really good, but some of them have the player going across continents for items that can be replaced in a few levels.
---
What's this "mind control" you speak of?
---
;)
---
Why don't you mind it? People are just gonna quit and the server is gonna die.
---
That’s what I’d do but I’m gonna be a resto Druid
---
Again after what? Privates? Were there no PVE privates?
---
To be honest I’m in a similar but opposite boat. I like the idea of a PvE server, it sounds relaxing. But I’m too set in my ways I think. Someone’s gotta be rogue fodder...
---
I cant wait to chill with my buddies at the nessingway camp ^.^
---
Fortnite kids are much more likelly to play on BfA than on Classic
---
I will be taking a week off of work to play 16 hour days for 7 days so hopefully, I can make good headway. May not hit 60 since I do not plan to optimize but hopefully be able to get 40 and my mount.
---
if your "dream" is going tauren just go tauren, you can meet at what, 10-15? that's just a couple of days
---
I'm giving a heads up to people who haven't had the modern day Vanilla experience.   
---
It might be irrelevant to you but the people seeing all these Phase 2 memes are learning a lot about what to expect.
---
It works the same way
---
My favourite part is the constant posts about what happens after naxx
---
Just as you were saying the other day, massive downvoting. A couple geared rank 14 players can definitely sway the difficulty of a raid. It is concerning.
---
PvE vanilla pservers were very rare, yes.
---
looking at the ground to get some fps and not letting the pc getting into emergency shutdown
---
During the demo the API was the same as in Legion, thus not allowing for the complex scripts we could use for vanilla.
---
I hope they at least allow for a proper "focus"-target function...
---
Anyone know why my thumbnail for this isn't showing up?
---
Fair enough!
---
Could *not* care less
---
That thing where the priest calls up tentacles, and forces you to walk off the edge of ~~ecstasy~~ destruction.
---
Everyone is diferent. If you have fun thats all it matters mate.
---
What about them?
---
I for one would also love some more technical information, especially in regards to interface addons (API) and the mechanics behind it (e. g. will they allow focus-target to be a thing?)
---
Righteous orbs, blood of the mountain, large emerald, arcane crystal, wildvine, fadeleaf, stonescale eels.
---
Posts about class balance changes are my personal favorites.
---
"They just need few minor number tweaks! It totally wont have any impact on the game!"
---
Why would you join a guild that doesn't align with your effort level?
---
I dont think anyone going for speed is going to bother with instances at all unless it's wailing caverns with the boatload of quests in place of a grinding session. Scarlet halls has some amazing upgrades for some classes, tons of quests, and they are super short.
---
What do YOU mean, YOU people!?
---
That's exactly the point of his post. The people who play casually and won't have reached 60 by the time phase 2 rolls out will have a shitty time getting farmed for honor points...
---
There are two types of people in WoW: Those who hate flying mounts and those who got netherwing drakes...
---
&gt; but since people are so interested in transmog NOW in current expansions... i would assume that the interest in it would carry over to classic servers as well to some degree
---
Well, transmogging don't affect your stats in retail. In Classic you won't have traonsmogs, you'll actually have to wear the item. So, only a few bank alts will actually have some kind of transmog.
---
Or people in RP servers.
---
Not complaining that I don't have a release date yet, but I'd like to know for this reason. I've played this exact scenario in my head though. Find out the date, request time off, date gets moved, weep.
---
Uhhhh, I meannn doesn't everyone spend 10 hours a day in Classic WoW? Nothing to see here!
---
I've re-approved it due to the music. You raised a fair point in that it's not completely unrelated due to the music being so prominent in Vanilla. This is a bit borderline overall, but yeah, captions or anything else making it visually-related to Classic always helps. We basically want posts on here to be immediately recognizable as being Classic-specific by the post's content itself, not just the title.
---
*"I do this because I know I will be ahead of the curve and thus able to gank people who can't grief back at me on a level 60 because F-R-E-S-H"* \- John F. Kennedy (1962)
---
Honestly, before I even look at either argument - It's so much more likely that Tribe knows what he's talking about than you.
---
Okay, I've checked them both out and he is indeed correct. If a guild like APES can affect a 10k server greatly, imagine what they can do on a smaller population server. Now, there won't be an APES on every server, but there will be a top guild performing the same role.
---
I can’t imagine their will be a Classic TBC, why not a classic Wotlk, cata, mists ? Seems pretty weird.
---
If they go down the way of Old School Runescape after phase 6 I think that will be for the best. Balance changes voted on by the community and added content approved by the community.
---
It is a fun meme, but ya the addition of the Honor system with no battlegrounds will result in what it resulted in previously, everyone killing each other in Hillsbrad. A few other town raids might happen, maybe on major cities too to draw out more unique players to kill (avoiding the diminishing returns on repeat kills), but overall that's what it will be. You'll have a much harder time *pre-*honor system in STV, due to the lack of incentive for efficiency. STV is the kind of zone gankers would visit when they were bored, which happens much more often before honor and battlegrounds.
---
\#NoFlying in TBC means you can’t do the attunement for Kara, not to mention plenty of other content. It’s literally not TBC without flying.
---
It’s REALLY obvious that pservers drop WAY more bags
---
That doesn't align with my pserver experience at all..
---
during phase 2 there were roaming gank parties of 5-10 rankers in every single 48+ zone. I had to stop flying into WPL and just run up from southshore because chillwind camp was never not camped. 
---
I ended up just running mad instances for safe xp and grinding mobs in remote locations. 
---
 I'll be 60 long before phase 2 in classic though so idgaf I just don't think blizzard understands the implications here.
---
You should do a then vs now setup!
---
Saying you like your nochanges with a sprinkle of necessary changes is like saying you want a bowl of cereal without piss, just a little bit of piss.
---
For sure. I'm playing a hunter, so leveling is gonna be a breeze either way - outpacing my pals means I can run around as an escort for them in STV. It's gonna be a blast!
---
I bet even the earliest ones will have a non verbal cease fire because both sides in STV that early will be focused solely on 60. Anything else is a waste of time.
---
Cheers, completely appreciate your point. If I was a better video editor I'd have added cleave move icons and fear over the running Uruk Hai but alas my skills are lacking.
---
On an unrelated note: Did you get my modmail about the automoderator rule to automatically remove comments/posts with links to private server websites?
---
I accidentally got stung when I used a pserver item database link by mistake. I figured an automod response would remove a fair bit of workload on your part.
---
I used to think pve servers were lame but with adult responsibilities in rolling pve so my play time isnt interuptted by ganking.  Might still be lame but its the best for me.
---
Really makes me pity today’s generation. Their games are so diluted down by all these moneytizations.
---
...and everyone takes 2 weeks off at the same time and businesses close and the stock market crashes, and there's no fresh milk being delivered for the babies...
---
I was the same but settled on mage. I plan to spend most of my time PvPing but wanted something that people would take to raids if I wanted too. Add on beastly AoE farming capabilities and free food, water and portals/teleports and its a no brainer to me. Free mounts (warlock) and godly 1v1 capabilities (priest) don't compare imo. Not to mention Spriests aren't really desired in raids at any point and warlocks are pretty weak on damage until later in vanilla. The only downside to me is that mages are very weak in a fight against the other casters but all vanilla pvp is rock-paper-scissors like that anyway.
---
PvE realms will be an interesting experiment. A good percentage will enable PvP to rank up.
---
Yeah, I was being facetious
---
Trying to claim that there was one magic bullet that "killed" WoW is pretty absurd. There have been countless major changes to the game over the years. You can't point at one single feature and say "this is why wow is bad". Flying mounts, group finder, sharding, removal of talent trees, garrisons etc. are all things that you could argue are the most impactful thing, but the truth is, they all contributed to the radical metamorphosis that WoW went through over the years. Even if there was one single things that killed WoW, I don't think it was flying mounts. At least not in TBC. WoW continued to grow in popularity through TBC and WotLK, so flying mounts definitely didn't spell death for WoW.
---
If you think the game will be played the same in 2019 as it was in 2005 you're in for one hell of a shock.
---
I don't want to play a PVE server you spastic. I want to play a pvp server, what I don't want to do is be forced to spend 20 hours a day sitting ganking a flightpath for the best honour per hour and destroy the faction balance on my own server.
---
If you think this isn't going to happen, you're deluded.
---
The 5% crit is really that good that it is better than every other dps weapon to 60? Is crit that important that they should stack agil while leveling? 
---
From the demo I heard that the way hit boxes were different that kiting as a warrior would be less effective on live than private servers.
---
Or that one Tauren on his mount standing on top of the quest giver.
---
Yes, but people will play it completely differently than back in 2005, why is that hard to understand?
---
If humans had green combovers, I might play a human warrior.
---
This, flying was key to TBC. The downside was that it killed world PVP.
---
Good point. Do you think flying hurt the game though? I know a lot of people do. If so, how would we get around that?
---
I'm hoping Jinx brings back some of their original WoW tshirt designs again.... including the Barrens Chat one.
---
There's some truth to that, but you also encounter less players, so 5 rankers can cover more area on a low pop server than they can on a high pop server.
---
Ah we did, sorry I didn't reply. We have automod already setup to remove the names of private servers (as well as various permutations of those names) automatically, but we don't have it set to message people for every time this comes up just yet. We'll consider it, but have our hands full with a few other things right now. Sorry for not getting back to you on that.
---
Raid entrances will also be a valley of death
---
Yeah rural Alberta was still using dialup in 2004. Is some towns (Blue Sky, Alberta) it’s still the option because satellite internet services are incredibly expensive , like $100+ /month of 4 mbps down.
---
Aye if they just make it a short ass vanilla again and dump tbc on us it’ll be back to private servers for me
---
Pserver was the most horrible classic experience i ever had... while leveling getting ganked by lvl 60 in low level zones all the time was the biggest fun i ever had 😅
---
Rolling pve realm and done with that topic! 🙃
---
agi&gt;mongoose
---
World pvp exists from the start of the game to the end of the game, that never changes. I'm not against world pvp, I'm against it being the only way to gain ranks/honour. It's not good I promise you that. 
---
I hope it's not as bad as I think too, but my experience thus far has driven me towards these conclusions.
---
And this is why I tabled my level 50 orc warrior and rolled a tauren druid because I was the exactly wrong level when this went live on Kel'Thuzad.
---
+1. Don’t treat vanilla like a sprint, it’s a marathon. Otherwise we just have retail wow all over
---
You'd need to make tons of changes if you remove flying and other TBC-introduced functions, such as Arenas.
---
So, I don't think it's feasible. It wouldn't make the #nochanges people happy, and it probably wouldn't make modern WoW players happy, either. You'd end up with a messy half-assed version of TBC where the majority of people are left unhappy.
---
I think you need an all-or-nothing approach, more or less.
---
I'm just gonna try to be in the first group high enough for STV
---
If you don’t play with a group of friends then you don’t get to play.
---
-Phase 2 on PVP servers
---
That's just fantasy. It didn't spread. It lasts a few seconds (10ish?), you can't really carry it outside of large cities effectively.
---
If you don't get heals, you'd just die, regardless of your level. Healers weren't "working to cure the problem". 
---
It also wasn't really one disease. People would bring it every few ZG raids, as new griefers wanted to have fun from the mechanic. There were many people spreading it on purpose...
---
It's hard to imagine CDC or other reputable institutions used this for anything other than a publicity stunt.
---
Honestly these things are fun to read about but it's mostly just romanticizing games which I feel does it a disservice - the truth is entertaining on its own.
---
Ret paladins aren't a class.
---
Sidegrades, ways to make the non-meta specs viable, planned raids that never made it to retail like Barrow Deeps, I'm okay with post vanilla content as long as it's still in the spirit of vanilla and not a power creep.
---
Why is this not the top comment? - this is all I was looking for in this post
---
1. Nope
---
2. Yep
---
3. Completely subjective
---
4. My tip is don't, there's no reason to other than the aesthetics
---
It's a bit more than some isolated ganks or camps. It's on a much larger scale than that, particularly with the 1.12 rewards in the game.
---
I love world pvp too, and I will be ranking, but I don't like the idea of sitting farming low geared/lower levels/afk players when they land at a busy flightpath. There's no fun or challenge in that, and mark my words, that will be the meta in classic as far as honour per hour goes.
---
&gt;**Phase 2 will not be that bad**  
---
&gt;**not be that bad**  
---
&gt;**bad**
---
'scuse me, this is going to be the *best* era of Classic. Goddamn low levels and noobs have had it coming for a long time.
---
Phase 2 will indeed come out at a time semi-casuals will be in the high 40s and tourists might start thinking about going back to retail... Might indeed be the push over the edge fort many.
---
this is so fucking totally me
---
So why not have these at launch?
---
IIRC they were crazy expensive back in the day, so it would actually be quite the accomplishment to see them.
---
I keep thinking I've narrowed it down, then a week later, I've come up with a reason it should be a different class.
---
Nahhh they would figure it out.  It's the age of information at your fingertips.
---
Healing. It’s like a satisfying OCD thing, trying to keep all the health bars topped off.
---
Guild banks werent in Vanilla just ad grp finder wasnt. They wont exist
---
Why did you have a poster of a mass murderer on your wall?
---
Hey!  It's not nice to call people retards!
---
Mhm people still play it on private servers after 14 years. You think another 2 years is gonna stop them? It won’t. On the rest, it’s hard to say what would be best.
---
I am 100% a hypocrite in this regard.  #NoChanges for Vanilla, but I would entirely be on board with #YesChanges to TBC.
---
No flying for starters.  I know this would require additional changes to the way some things worked, but in the event you need to get up on a plateau or something, would it really be so hard to simply talk to an NPC who grants you flying for like, 3 minutes?
---
Just a normal day in STV in every Phase, not just in Phase 2.
---
You are kind of forced to in that level range the other options are awful and their is only so many times you can run SM.
---
Haha, um yea.. I maybe sorta expected it to have better graphics than it did back then?
---
Regardless, I would like to have the lag-free experience for once. Especially raiding 40 man.
---
Not the city lol i had dial up forever it sucked
---
It’s really not a big deal. Just stay away from the streamer servers. 
---
When classic launches, wait an hour and then pick the lowest pop realm.
---
You do not start with your faction capital FP or any other FP for that matter. 
---
Yes, there’s a limit to the buy back tab at a vendor. I’m not 100% sure if it resets on logout. However, it’s very very likely.
---
I just got 5mb internet where I live....
---
I mean I'd love lots of "small tweaks" to classes, but that just opens the gate for more changes, so...no.
---
I seriously doubt there will be many, if any, of those "fortnite players" you guys talk about.
---
Is that a Dean Markley amp?? I had one of those!
---
&gt; Stealth fear other druids.
---
Don't pvp with other druids. It's against the code!
---
Also, that fight will last hours. That's why we have a code.
---
I just got 5mb speed where I live this week...
---
On arms warrior yes, your whole spec is based on CRIT! Deep wounds and 20% more critical dmg, overpower crit causing deep wounds aswell.  
---
You just have a huge dps gap if you don‘t crit often enough as arms warrior.
---
And 10% cc in total you could get off your spec is alot!
---
SS was the "meta". I think some of you here talk about efficient P2 honor grinding with far too much certainty...
---
The Hillsbrad farm fields might as well be renamed the Hillsbrad killing fields for horde to borrow a term from Cambodia because alliance can gank there with the NPCs helping them.
---
Aku'mai?

---
No worries. If you guys are interested I've got tons of automod rules that I can readily copy/edit over from /r/Eve. Just give me a shout!
---
Yeah, I don't even know where to begin a response to that. I'm out.
---
I agree. Prestige comes from skill, not having too much time to sit down.
---
Are u saying dwarf warriors are gimp?
---
Depends on how they do server population caps. If they keep it like the original 3K, then I think they can keep original spawn timer. But if they have 10K pop servers then yes they need to increase spawn timer.
---
That's my favorite progression out of any video game experience I've had so far. It goes from green to yellow to red to blue. And that feel was chosen deliberately.
---
That's what I'm thinking too. What changes could be made in order to stop WoW from devolving into what retail is today? There must be some changes along the way.
---
That feel when you have wait 11 months for arathi basin 😳
---
What the fuck. Who calls it player servers
---
I always think of it as this: If vanilla wow had gone 3 years duration instead of 2 years till TBC i bet blizzard would have done the changes.
---
What the devs plan with Classic down the road is unknown but theres many talents and skills there were fixed later which was horribly bad in Vanilla *cough* lightwell *cough*
---
I had PeoplePC and every 4 hours it would restart the internet as well.
---
^ LOL truth. The hair options are so much better for other races. And the male human model is just terrible, females are better and can also fit in other places geometrically like between certain gates and fences that males cant.
---
 I have done the tryhard minmax Human Fury Warrior in the past on *other* servers, so I have had my fill recently. I will likely play something different for fun next time around when classic launches. Of course with the permanence of official servers (finally!) Ill likely end up making one again eventually.
---
Back on live servers I had a gnome rogue and felt the pain of always being 1 step behind, so it was awesome to do it "the right way" a 2nd time around on the other servers.
---
Wow isn’t as much about reaction time as other games. Correct prioritization or spells wins the fight every time
---
It has absolutely nothing to do with players being toxic. Do you think these players WANT to sit and camp flightmasters all day? Ofcourse not. It just happens to be the fastest way to get honor and when you need hundreds of thousands of honor each week to rank up you WILL sit and do this.
---
You are an idiot if you think you can just tell these people to stop camping flight points, because as long as even one person is willing to do it, everyone else are forced into doing it as well if they want to compete, or they get outfarmed on honor.
---
well, I decided Ill go for orc fm warlock, will have tailor+encha.... then literally ALL my friends confirmed they go Alliance. 
---
but I just cba to play gnome or human. so now the question for me is go for dwarf hunter with trollrageface or go gnome lock ? :/
---
Well, the problem with picking a low pop realm is that the standing pool will be significantly lower, meaning there might not even be bracket 1 spots on your server. This results in a much slower rank pace and you'll be significantly outgeared by players from other, higher pop, servers.
---
I remember when I was downloading something big, waiting hours, then someone would pick up the phone at like 90%... The rage was real lol.
---
Why do You think it will be different in Phase 1 ar any other Phase? 
---
Just a normal day in STV, not just in Phase 2.
---
Also since they said pvp gear was going to be 1.12 itemization, wont the weapons and some pieces be BIS until Naxx? Doesnt that make them absurdly strong and statted for being that powerful at phase two?
---
&gt; Dynamic Spawning Information (black lotus, devilsaurs, etc)
---
If they don't increase the spawns on black lotus I can easily see it going for 120g a pop and their only being able to be 2 raiding guilds per server.
---
Oh, I will, too. I'll also gank people after bgs come out. But the promise of rewards will kick start the action in phase 2. That time in release vanilla was pretty chaotic.
---
And you get caught up gearing without the promise of pvp gear, so you don't have as much time
---
Why would the **10million+** people playing one of the world's biggest games try out the "new hot game" of the month that's likely to be popular on Twitch? No idea.
---
No flying mounts, just add a NPC to fly you to and from or add item in your bags to call a bird to fly you to locations that require flying. 
---
Flying was a slippery slope and we saw where that went. 
---
LFG if I recall, found you a group but you still had two go to location.
---
I love pvp but will never understand why someone would put themselfes through being ganked over and over by some "GG ez" max lvl rogue in STV.
---
Hahd
---
&gt;I just don't think blizzard understands the implications here.
---
I think that is exactly what they do. They have taken time to make out pre-honor, pre-BG and then BG phases. They know what will happen, that is the whole idea. This is part of WoW vanilla, so they bring it to us. How we handle it is a different story. A ton of things will be different simply due to how we as players have evolved. They didn't promise us systems to counteract the change in the players, they promised us vanilla.
---
So the ganking might be way worse, but they bring us vanilla.
---
I'm a mythic raider on retail as a mage,  we finished this raid tier at #82 in the U.S. 
---
I'll be switching to a warrior for Classic as a dps/off tank. I currently have a warrior alt on retail. 
---
I'm looking for a high end raiding guild on a pvp server in the U.S. that is being led by current mythic raiders.
---
Yeah I have a feeling this might be a big blunder by blizzard
---
Not letting people get honor in Wsg or arathi is going to make the world absolutely toxic
---
Im in general no changes but id love to see a lightly rebalanced vanilla wow where they nerf fury and mages very slightly and bring up the shitter specs like moonkin, ret etc. 
---
To be clear, not in THIS release of the game but itd be a cool thing to see a year or two down the line on new servers or something. I know this wont happen but oh well. Maybe we will get a post naxx patch that fixes shit and adds some more content.
---
 I could always tell somebody was about to call too because the computer would make some interference noise lol
---
I wonder if we'll have a beta period to test this stuff.
---
Probably no dungeon finger would be the best change. Flying is very necessary.
---
Damn I remember deadmines being literally the easiest shit you could beat it without a tank and two pets
---
oh my sweet sweet summer child
---
This must be a country thing, no one (99%) in the UK was still on dial-up in 2005.
---
That last paragraph is so true... I feel like as a mage I wanna just nuke things but in team fights your CC is really your strength / priority.
---
They say monitor stands are one of the more expensive parts of a setup.
---
Why?
---
They're standing on hundreds of dollars worth of school books.
---
Reputation-wise it makes more sense for you to run to Durotar but both are possible. Takes 30 min and then you’re set. Don’t let your dreams be memes.
---
That was a godsend because in some cases I was able to prevent the phone pickup and save my download LOL.
---
You're fucking insane.
---
Because it's not the "new hot game of the month", and will most likely not be popular on twitch for more than a few weeks. 
---
And I'm pretty sure when people say "fortnite players" in this context they don't talk about anyone who has played that game. They have a much more specific idea in mind of what type of person that is.
---
Why so complicated? In vanilla and in classic you were and will be able to simply use:
---
/cast Riposte
---
/cast Sinister Strike
---
It will cast Riposte when it's available/possible, otherwise it'll cast Sinister Strike.
---
 If i remember correctly if a healer or anyone with a buff flags themselves and then goes around healing everyone or buffing people then they all get flagged too. I'm pretty sure that was a thing.
---
just roll PvP. If youre scared of getting ganked once people are lvl 60 then its up to your own factions 60's to protect the noobs.
---
It is, I lived way out in the country. It was hard being a gamer growing up.
---
Vanilla shaman trainers: https://classicdb.ch/?search=Trainer#npcs
---
Thanks slut
---
Probably if they are going to limit them in any way or not. Modern day addons (and even macros) can do way more than in Vanilla.
---
Mom im raiding Dont pick up the phone!!!!
---
Yup, they’re all just “servers”.  You have to flag for War Mode OR PvP to fight players in the world.
---
War Mode can only be enabled from your main capital city (Org/SW).
---
I’m a PvE fan, but this decision baffled me.
---
31/0/20 mage is fine in pvp
---
That's my issue with using an excessive amount of raid consumables. One stupid mistake and 40 people lose upwards of 800 total buffs, worth possibly hundreds of gold.
---
I'd rather not be forced to have flasks/pots/food and just try our best than waste so much gold and prep time.
---
just like in real life, its easy to romanticize war
---
There are definitely going to be those people that power level as fast as possible and miss out on all the fun
---
Yes it was, because people were ignorant. Now, if anyone knows the better way to grind honor (which they do), they will do that better way because if you don't do the better way then whatever honor you get from the inefficient method is  going to be worthless because ranking is based on how much honor you are gaining RELATIVE to everyone else in your faction.
---
And no easy training until you get level 10 for teleport &gt; hearth combo
---
&gt; Finally, questing is pretty fun as a priest! Grab a great wand, shield yourself, cast a couple dots, and then wand a way. Close to zero downtime once you get your wand (as early as level 5).
---
My biggest frustration memory of vanilla was being stuck in un goro crater just wanding down targets with a pitiful dot while i saw hunters and warriors around me kill stuff 200x faster...
---
I miss my priest from 5man and raiding, but damn if that levelling part wasnt frustrating.

Not this. It's no problem to just run over.
---
They removed the concept of a pve or pvp server altogether.
---
No no, it was less than that but limited per zone. It did not respawned in the same spot 1 hour after however, it had multiple spawn points and spawned in one
---
Of them after 1 hour
---
thats what i hope for diablo immortal
---
I hope so.
---
How do you know the revival of one of the biggest games of all time is not going to be the hot new game of the month? Yeah, it's not a "new" game but it's certainly going to appear in Twitch as "WoW Classic" or whatever.
---
I get what "Fortnite player" implies, but that term applies to such a huge number of people that it's completely inevitable that some of that huge number will try Classic out. Especially if Blizzard offer a free trial, which is uhh, not what I'm hoping for.
---
Wrong, its the other way around. Vanilla addons and macros can/could do way more than todays addons and macros.
---
Yup!
---
Priest and Rogue for me, which one is gonna be main is what im constantly re-considering..
---
Hey, it's this really uninformed opinion again.
---
&gt; How do you know the revival of one of the biggest games of all time is not going to be the hot new game of the month?
---
Because it's an old ass game. I love it, but I am fully aware that a lot of the "kids" today are not into it, as this post insinuates as well. And unless the kids are into it it's not gonna be "*the* hot game".
---
Here's mine:
---
/gloat      
---
/mock      
---
/cast Cannibalize
---
I know you've put the /s there, but I want to emphasize on this.
---
For the *majority* of players, there will always be content left to do. Be it quests, mounts, 'achievements', dungeons, raids, sets, specific gear etc. etc. PvP will also be a huge motivation since ranking up can take weeks, if not months.
---
Very little guilds will do a full Naxx clear, let alone have AQ40 on farm, even 1-2 years after launch.
---
The people that tend to say they've ran out of content are the *minority*, the min-maxers, the hardcore, the dedicated.
---
I can easily foresee Classic doing extremely well and retaining a healthy status even 2-3 years after launch without additional new/revamped content.
---
Keep in mind that your average alt takes a few good days to level up and a few weeks to gear up decently. Split that across your average playebase and you've got A LOT of time to sink in this game, as long as you're willing to play it.
---
Flying mounts made no sense for the type of game that drew me in. 
---
I thought at the time it was going to be only Outland but jeez we were wrong. Made the worlds they design seem empty.
---
i got felstriker on my rogue in vanilla, god damn i want that dagger again!
---
I'd rather play tweaked classic than TBC though
---
Your comment is anything but mild
---
After that comes Naxxramas...2.
---
Man that racial +5 to swords really pays off.
---
This dude has a macro, that anytime anyone lands at a flight path, he says hello and greats everyone warmly
---
I remember that. Hate when somebody called during a bossfight.
---
Wow wasn't even meant to have pvp originally, its an incredibly pve-oriented game...
---
live to win
---
You seem to forget a quite important aspect, some classes *are* better at certain things. If you plan to PuG it will matter, because when someone makes a PuG they don't know the players. It is logical to at least try to pick the stronger classes so that even if people suck their class can carry a bit. It is no different than wanting people with better gear.
---
The problem isn't whether you can clear with 10 boomies in your raid, the problem is it will increase the difficulty, and why would the rest of the people want to do that?
---
And then there are, as you mention, the spread belief that vanilla is hard. Doesn't matter whether or not it is hard if people make groups from the assumption that it is - same result, you will have a harder time finding a group.
---
And lastly, you seem to use the argument that even keyboard turners and people like that cleared raids. Well, because compared to modern WoW it was basically just a DPS race for the most part. So gear and class mattered a lot more than mechanical skill.
---
Oh, and also:
---
&gt;You wouldn't BELIEVE how many clickers and keyboard turners there were clearing Molten Core and Naxx and AQ in the middle 2000's
---
No, I certainly won't believe that. You can't say many clickers cleared Naxx when there were not many that cleared Naxx overall.
---
I thought I was set on hunter just because I wanted to faceroll to 60 but I've been playing a paladin on a p-server and I'm having a blast. I have a feeling I'm going to change my mind quite a bit before Classic actually comes out.
---
I'm looking forward to avoidong edgelords like you on my pve server
---
Just bought Diablo 2 second hand, can’t wait to get home 🤤
---
Are there even servers at this point or is everything entirely sharded?
---
Hope for new content after naxx
---
I'm fairly sure most people will be level 60 when Phase 2 gets released...
---
I have like 2 weeks before 16th of July and 2 weeks after, let's see if I get lucky with balancing a "real" summer vacation 50/50.

there is a lot more than just raiding to do in vanilla. cant speak for you, but i know i'll likely be subbed for years to come just for vanilla as i plan on playing multiple toons since i wont loose progress due to server closures. as well, not everyone will be hitting 60 in nothing flat, in fact i have a feeling that the vast majority of the playerbase wont even hit 60 for the first 3 months.

I very much agree to the argument OP is making regarding the release date. Though there are other threads discussing it also. No need to make a new one. Making new threads only splits the discussion and hurts it. So I hope OP is going to write this in existing discussion threads also.

Good luck on your paper. Not to say anything you probably don’t already know, but you’ll probably have to start with defining the key aspects of a religion. What the faith based beliefs cause as a result and then compare to WoW Classic
---
I mean even if they decide to add on Classic after a couple years its still gonna be its own version of WoW. Im just so happy that i dont have to start over on gear and shit once every 2 years now.
---
Same thing I do every day. Put kid to bed around 8. lean over to the wife and mention wow classic is finally live. Create my main, ah alt, bank alt, etc while my wife makes her main toon and settles on a name. Hopefully, play until around 1 am if the launch is stable and everything isnt insanely overcrowded. Log in for 2-3 hours 4-6 nights a week and play. I'm rolling warrior and she's rolling priest so at 60 we can quickly form our own groups for dungeons so were not online waiting 45 mins looking for a tank/healer.
---
Which classes are better with T1? Know of any Vida or guides?

Is there a way of making flying viable without killing world pvp? Love the idea of flying mounts and the feeel so right in the  warcraft world.

Make them very slow to summon? Much slower land speed than regular mount?

Obviously server size/sharding is apart of this but I would love a post of them just discussing the tech behind the servers. As we all know retail servers don't really perform well in things such as like 40v40 situations. I would love for them to explain the differences between retail servers and Classics.
---
Healer. I just love supporting people.
---
The game prefers to shard you with people on your server in the open world afaik. Also ah is still server-based.
---
But yeah realms feel meaningless at this point and the only limit what guilds you can join.
---
Yeah. This I don't understand about this. Things like what exactly happens in phase 3 to 6, or that one lamppost that has the wrong colour. WoW in 2005 wasn't bug free either, and we certainty didn't know the future regarding patches. Though I'm not a hardcore player, so maybe that's why. I would love to just get phase 1 and have fun with it, and have the surprise of when certain raids and features would be added.
---
Dynamic spawns is worse than sharding imo, the game as designed with specific realm pops and spawn rates in mind, changing these will fuck up the economy royally. 
---
Encounters are tuned so that the majority of players won't be rocking all possible flasks and buffs, why do you want to change this and simplify this but having dynamic spawns?
---
I can also recommend warcrafttavern as a resource for classic guides and hunter pets specifically:
---
https://www.warcrafttavern.com/hunter-pets/
---
Okay Kenny, add Eyes of the Beast to your hotbar...
---
Not for raids. The only boss in Vanilla a druid is actually better than a warr at tanking is Patchwerk. Because he can't crit and crush.
---
Druids are fine offtanks or third tanks, but warriors do everything better.
---
People don't use wisdom flasks and major mana pots? Am I missing something?
---
Just to add to this, Shamans are basically required to get them. Not having access to any single elemental totem would make leveling suck so hard. Same for Druids and their forms.
---
I would personally recommend doing them as you get them. Sure, you can go back at level 60 and dominate that Succubus quest, but it's so fun to do it at the right level.
---
Warrior is better, even if you consider a normal tank spec to be 31 Arms. Druid is defintely easier to play in dungeons most of the time though. Theres not a huge difference for 5-mans but Warrior is still better for the same reasons theyre better in raids. Theres also a plethora of old topics on this you can read through.

As for gearing, theyre both about the same. Since you only have 1 tank in the group, youll be the only one after tank items. Gearing as any tank is the easiest because you can make the groups fast and you dont have any competition on most items.
---
This is a post from 5 months ago no?
---
If they add TBC to Classic in any way, I'll go back to pservers...and at that point pservers will have better stats taken from Classic and be better hopefully.
---
If they do anything with TBC or any other XPAC, I hop they do it separately from Classic servers.
---
Um, depending on loot and faction, bone biter is better than whirlwind axe, executioner cleaver is a world drop blue axe that has 1% hit and is also better than whirlwind axe requires level 43..
---
the axe off Emp from BRD requires lv 54 and is also better than whirlwind axe.
---
Whirlwind axe starts to suck big time at lv 50+
---
also the quest can be completed easily considering you can freeze, fear and stun the lv 40 elemental you have to fight.

Chris Metzen once referred to OG WoW as Classic because he was put off by the term Vanilla because "there was nothing Vanilla about World of Warcraft."

I know Allies on my server gonna be looking at me like "what can men do against such reckless hate."

"Im as much for "no changes" as the next guy"  
---
"This unchanged gameplay bad &gt;:^(  
---
So what you mean is when things arent convenient and bad we should change them?   
---
Why stop there? Lets change classes a bit too because some of them are actually garbage.  
---
But why stop there? Lets add some more QoL nobody cares anyway.
---
And we eventually reach bfa.
---
Because flasks are insanely powerful and expecting people to pay that much for them leads to all sorts of issues. I don't like dynamic spawning but with how rare black lotus is I don't think their is much of a choice. Normally I am part of the no changes crowd but stuff like this and the warlord grind have obvious issues, I don't like the solutions but they are issues.
---
Mostly he's right. The API has way more functionality now than it did in vanilla. But you are right that in some circumstances, especially with common playermade macros, you could do a lot more in vanilla.

You misspelled absolutely awesome!

Not to mention that the time spent to level 10 is a tiny fraction of what 10-60 will be. You'll have plenty of time to level together.
---
Ok let me rephrase: Icecap isn't worth shit, it's only used for two recipes. All the other herbs are used for 10+.
---
Also, mana pots are found all over the place and any class that isn't a healer puts the straight on AH. Alchemists don't make them much because the profits are abysmal.
---
Risk of rain 2 has been pretty fun. Nothing can stop my thirst for classic but its cheap and fun to pass the time. Its a roguelike game.
---
4-5 months? lol this is 2019
---
Hey! Me not THAT kind of orc.
---
You know how blizz is with delays?  Tuesday downtime they'd wait until 1min before servers should be up to let us know 2 more hours.
---
I'm sure you can't cancel PTO 2 hours before your work day starts.
---
Sack off the Battle Royale garbage and play Titanfall 2, the low-key best online shooter.
---
Ranged DPS. I get to survey the battlefield and see all the action. I cant wait to play Warlock.

PvP - most realistic and authentic type of gameplay. This is World Of Wardraft, not “oh, I’m inconvenienced, better turn off my PvP flag craft. Getting mad while questing because you are getting camped is part of the fun
---
PvE - Sissy Craft 
---
RP-PvE - Sissy Craft with weird people
---
RP-PvP - Solid type to choose. If you are going to roleplay, this is the clear winner

A FUCKING RELEASE DATE
---
I can understand why you would want to do this.
---
But will this relate in any meaningful way to work beyond your masters?
---
What are you getting your degree in?
---
Fair enough; so don't go Icecap farming, but pick them if you find them.
---
Don't try to attack me, the reason people want classic is because the path chose to develop the game was not working for the old fans... The last thing they need to do is start listening to changing the road map that looks half decent.
---
Let's get the game up and available before we try to change classic right away. Let's not worry about getting bored before we even get into the game.
---
1. Don't start with any FPs learned.
---
2. Yes and you only get like 10 buyback slots. Pretty sure they don't all reorder themselves if you sold 11 things but buy 1 back; so they won't show the last hidden 1.
---
3. Depends what you're looking for, but it's really just about time=money or exp.
---
4.  You won't be able to learn any Shaman spells on Eastern Kingdoms. However, the Zeppelin coming from Undercity to Orgrimmar can help. You might want to look up on a classic database, whether you think the next spells you can learn are going to be worth the trip.  You can always go back at a later level, to make sure you're also picking something up that's more impactful, like a higher rank of your shock spell.
---
I agree with you, but don't act as if vanilla WoW was some expertly designed experience, the devs clearly did not know exactly what they were doing with a lot of the encounter designs for example.
---
I‘m kind of a scientist myself, but could you go on and explain to me how?
---
You don't need flasks to raid, it just helps.
---
/join WorldDefense
---
You will be occupied for months with all of the world pvp you could ever want
---
Leveling a shaman in trisfall is hard without shaman trainers.
---
The original Battle for Azeroth
---
I'm so thankful we got broadband like 3 months prior to the release. Got DC a lot due to a busted fucking router though.
---
BFD is probably my favorite overall vanilla dungeon. The ambiance, length, and difficulty of it was just perfect.
---
Yeah, if your guild likes you enough they might be willing to carry you through the content, just like they might carry a bad player through the content for social reasons. 
---
It's just a lot to ask, with the level of knowledge available today. Most people are going to resent struggling through raids, giving it their all, while carrying someone who is actively choosing to be (near) useless. So more likely you'll find yourself limited to very easy content.
---
shared cities ruined the immersion and flying made people dodge eachother, the start of removing the rpg from the mmorpg
---
Could argue the game became a revolving door, keeping in those crowds that better identified with other games. But pushing those that enjoyed D&amp;D style slow casual game &amp; Relying on others. 
---
Yeah more popular but popularity doesn’t equate being a good game or that all decisions were 100% solid. I still love Warcraft and all it’s lore and still buy expansions but I don’t play them past a month or free time given.
---
Yeah...it was pretty pointless to say the least, maybe some #changes lol
---
Right click on the shortcut, then on change icon, find the one you want (you should have it prepared obviously). Done.
---
There is no beyond. Vanilla is the endgame.
---
September 22nd while the entire community flames blizzard for it being them late and releasing it on the last day of summer, the 23rd
---
OH GOD THEY'RE IN THE TREES!
---
Not the death of WoW. TBC was just as good as Vanilla, IMHO
---
Nope =\
---
Wolves and kodos
---
I know how the progression works in vanilla, thank you very much.
---
&gt; Then it'll take 2-3 months just to get gear for MC
---
More like 2-3 days of farming dungeons, or a couple weeks if you casually do a couple dungeons in the evening with your friends. You don't need to do 200 BRD lava runs for that 1% drop IF to run MC, you actually barely need any gear at all, most dungeons blues will do. Pre-raid BiS is *optimal, not required*.
---
&gt; only a few months of MC until the next raid is released, which is less time than you actually need
---
You need a few months for what? Equip a whole guild with BRE? You're not gonna need months to progress MC. Most decent groups, either retail raiders or pserv, will stomp MC in a few hours. Hardcore raiders will clear MC in less than an hour each week. PUGs in 1.5-2 hours.
---
You seem to be stuck in your 2005 memories. The perceived difficulty 15 years ago when you were keyboard turning and clicking is nothing like what you will experience in Classic 2019.
---
From a Paladin perspective:
---
- Level 12: The Tome of Divinity / Resurrection quest chain. 4875xp in about half an hour or less. About on par with the XPH I plan on having in that range, so might as well. Cause you know if I'm level 45 without a rez spell and pass by a dead player, I'll get called a dick for not rezzing.
---
- Level 20: Verigan's Fist - Unless there are other speedleveling paladins around, I likely won't get it until ~23/24 because alliance speedrunners won't be running SFK, and with other paladins, we can just do the 1st boss and then nope out once we got the item we need. And this mace does 30-40% more damage than anything else in this range, which leads to 10-25% faster leveling in the 20-35 level range. SFK is the only barrier to getting it quick, but I anticipate it'll save 3-4 hours between 20-35, so anything less than that should be a benefit (with a group of pallies, it can be done in 60-90 min, not counting deadmines.)
---
People don’t buff me flagged on a PvE server :( 
---
This kinda matters to me.
---
Healers actually have imo the hardest time finding a group for strat these days. There are three healing classes per faction, but only 1 slot in group. And within strat are two BIS healing pieces (chest and neck), so every healer wants to do it.
---
Tanks however are really in demand for strat. I believe tanks don’t need anything from strat, Except if they want cape, which makes finding a tank hard. So if your goal is to do a ton of runs for the mount, tank will be the fastest.
---
Oh, nice.  Thanks!
---
Can I get my little bit of piss with a heaping helping of wheaties?
---
Used to run a lot of dungeons with a Feral tank and he was awesome. He used to off-tank in MC and BWL as well without a problem. Beyond that though, I don't think they're all that viable.
---
BC vet here. What exactly was “phase 2”?
---
I'm familiar with the talents, but the issue I see is that deep wounds can be overridden to not benefit from the full 20% bleed. Using a non-axe with more top end damage seems like it would be better than 5% crit after a certain point.
---
You don't need to do BFD. The nagas outside the entrance drop the gem.
---
- SFK needs the 1st boss (way out there, no alliance quests means nobody's running it, biggest hurdle)
---
- The Deadmines needs cleared to 1st boss room.
---
You gotta replace the two dogs with toy poodles, for a more accurate depiction. When PVE server players turn on that pvp. It's cute to watch lol.
---
Are you guys EU or NA?
---
I didn't say they don't know what they are doing just that they don't understand the full implications.
---
It's easy to think "Ohhh we will just implement the honor system with no BG's and players will be forced to world pvp and it will be just like the good old days with southshore vs tarren mill epic pvp battles!"
---
When in reality it will be a group of 60 rankers doing laps in Unguro crater for hours on end killing all the lvl 50's trying to quest.
---
The entire song is “Call to Arms” part of the Classic WoW Soundtrack
---
Wait, I thought we were getting progressive itemization?
---
To me it sounds so wrong to ask for more. We asked for vanilla. We get vanilla and people are worrying about what happens in vanilla 3 years from now.
---
People need to chill, enjoy it. And if they want TBC or Wotlk they should find other ways of playing that.
---
I dont want any "beyond naxx" discussions up untill its time to discuss it. Now it just not the time.
---
Ok, so it still works with w10.
---
Thank you. I‘ll keep in mind to nod delete the ps-vanilla-symbol when uninstalling.
---
There will be a lot of people in their 20s who were too young to get super into vanilla when it originally came out.
---
And having to go into the world for honor rewards will have a huge effect. That guy who grinds bgs for 15 hours every day will be world pvping that much every day. Hunters like me will be ganking in level 60 zones for honor. Healers suck alone, so you'll see a lot of small groups looking for trouble and clashing into each other. Anywhere with a lot of traffic will have rogues looking to pick people off or large groups attacking.
---
I know the memes are dramatic, but the pre bg honor days really were a war zone. Then again, I was 21 and recently divorced, so I had the time to gank for 12+ hours every single day. Except for when I had to farm for repairs and arrows.
---
I had a guy try that on me once. I was in my resto gear after healing a dungeon run, farming Clefthoofs in Nagrand and this alliance pally came up and was obviously inspecting me.
---
He offered a duel, I switched to cat form, switched to my T5/T6 feral gear and then destroyed him. I mean like literally within 15 seconds. But he had forfeited at the start of the duel and flagged me, and his stealthed rogue friend also tried unsuccessfully to gank me. He vanished away really quickly.
---
It was a great idea on their end, though, they just happened to pick on a raider. I had never had someone force-flag me on a duel before and never saw it again.
---
Found a ring in there last night...
---
It actually still has multiple heads that pop out of the water.
---
Such a necessity!
---
Absolute boomer tier meme
---
Generally because there isn't 1 that is.
---
I suspect they'll revert this decision if they get enough feedback
---
All I can hear myself saying is : “omg bro..... fuck off”
---
What sort of blasphemous ideas are you hinting at?
---
Archbishop Benedictus will be hearing about this. Consider yourself warned.
---
Heals &gt; Tank &gt; DPS. In vanilla, healing takes the most focus. Some fights it might be the tanks, but usually the healers. Decursing, watching for a big spike, instant heal CD.   
---
DPS has to be the most boring thing you can do. Takes 0 though other than pressing a macro. Maybe move out of the ground circles. Not so much in later expansions, but Vanilla DPS is basically Target Dummy.
---
I'd say it has more in common with heroin than religion though.
---
But good luck nonetheless.
---
Big **OOF**.
---
But a lot of changes that happened during vanilla started the bad trend that lead to today's retail.
---
* small, single path dungeon hubs instead of epic dungeons
---
SM and Dire Maul were cool dungeons and they war fun to play, but they weren't as epic as BRD, BRS, Scholo or Strat.
---
* realm transfer
---
That really hurts the community. It's better if you have to work with what you have instead of applying to a guild and transfer off.
---
* cross realm bg
---
Cross realm anything is bad in my opinion.
---
* power creep
---
AQ40 / Naxx items are too powerful and left no space for further vanilla content. The reset with TBC was inevitable.
---
* mini games in the world
---
With the revamped Silithus they started adding "mini games" into what is supposed to be a believable world. Today we have that crap everywhere where every third quest is some stupid mini game or vehicle.
---
The PvP stuff there? Just breaks immersion for no value. Keep that to BGs.
---
Obviously, many changes during vanillas life span were good but I'm not sure if 1.12 is really the best version and I'm not convinced a 1.18 would have been better then 1.12.
---
your post reminds me of the kind of players who obsessively pursue best-in-slot items as evidence that they are good players.
---
"Like two or three people on the server will already have R14 gear when BWL releases, classes is ruined!!!!!" -this subreddit
---
In my experience, earlier in Vanilla nobody wanted Warrior DPS period in PvE. You were an offtank first, and wanting to be pure DPS was seen as selfish. It was just kind of expected you'd be doing mediocre DPS, whether arms or fury, only when you weren't needed to tank. Eventually people figured out DW fury was viable, but nobody realized it was top-tier in actual Vanilla that I know of.
---
In a recent podcast interview a former class designer said that hey actually had a lot of class changes planned for vanilla, but they decided it was easier to hold them off until TBC. A lot of the (good) class changes that's
---
OMG THE GOONIES!!!! I forgot about the goon squad. They were the best guild ever. They had hundreds of players across multiple servers. They were all terrible of course but thats what made them great. They were like puddies. This nameless faceless garbage threat that would show up to menace angel grove. I used to love hunting goonies. They even followed me to Age of Conana and, I got to camp them there too.
---
Also to the Deleted guy us PVPers 100% understand their is always one guy that trys to ruin it for other people. After all we live on pvp servers. That being said it's part of the fun. Turning the tables of little shits like that over time is part of the charm of pvp servers. Yes you do get ganked by goonies as you level but, then you also get to learn hatred for goonies. It makes hunting them at 60 all the more satisfying.
---
As someone that will be on a PvE server, i can relate.
---
?
---
It's running off of the current retail engine..performs the exact same as retail
---
Obviously cat and bear form are a priority, but I just did the aquatic form quest and it was a huge time sink. I don't know if it's worth it until after getting land travel form or just waiting until 60. Same with the abolish poison quest.
---
I will still do the quests as I get them, do professions, and occasionally dungeon run. I was just wondering what tactics the super hardcore 4 days /played min max players do to pull ahead of the groups on fresh servers.
---
Religion is the opiate of the masses and all that
---
No. The only changes I'll recommend to any legacy content would be things that preserved the spirit of the content. Removing massive features like flying and dungeon finger [sic] would fundamentally change those expansions in ways we can't accurately predict.
---
Would it be neat to see that stuff implemented on a fun server, sure. But to be the only path for official legacy releases, that's a negative for me.
---
EU
---
circumstances are different - the rewards are not the same
---
Some UK areas are still on dial up, where I live I can just get 2mb on ADSL. We don't get mains water, we'll never get fibre.
---
TF might as well be it's own category with how much better it is than the other legendaries or any item in the game. It was still top tier at 70.
---
Do you enjoy running around seeking out other unsuspecting players to kill? Or are you a masochist and enjoy constantly fearing that someone will come stab you in the back while you are doing other things? 
---
If not, choose a PvE server. If you enjoy either of those things, you may choose a PvP server, but if you have any sort of problem with getting ganked, I would still advise against it. 
---
I am biased though, I just don't enjoy world PvP in vanilla WoW. Occasionally I might get a nice fight against someone, but it's like a 5% chance or something. The other 85% of encounters ends either with me dying without choice, or the enemy dying and me feeling like an asshole for ganking someone innocent. 
---
For level 60 I would personally be pretty fine on a PvP server, as I'm not easily angered by ganking and stuff. But for levelling I like to just zone out and not think too much about the game, and that's just not possible on a busy PvP server. So I will avoid those servers at all costs, maybe even choosing to play on a different server from my friends because of that.
---
Dude you are trying to change vanilla. Stop. They aren’t making a what if vanilla. They are making it as close as possible, minus a few changes, based on 1.12 data.
---
You know what else would have been cool? If paladins could have tanked raids and actually having a taunt, if boomkins had more mana, if druids could hit defense cap and be actual high end tanks, etc.
---
That isn’t vanilla, that is, to some extent, BC. You could play a what if game all day. That’s not what blizzard is doing.
---
Stop making a mountain out of nothing. Very few will ever get rank 10 stuff before bgs come out.
---
And, let’s face it, bwl, for the most part, is a joke no matter the gear.
---
&gt;shared cities ruined the immersion
---
What are you basing this on? Everyone I know loved Dalaran and Shattrah.
---
&gt;the start of removing the rpg from the mmorpg
---
Ridiculous. There was barely any wpvp on PvE servers and nobody gave a fuck.
---
Mainly they needed to stop wiping away all of their work and trying to introduce new versions of it..they just needed to build on what they had
---
There are lots of guilds that don't require full consumes / world buffs
---
It just helps? It has from what I remember as much spell damage as the rest of a mages pre raid BIS combined.
---
I really liked the very hard to get tbc flying n normal mounts tho
---
first
---
I don't think you'll find one hardcore pvper in a hundred who thinks cross reason bg's had a positive impact. All sense of pvp community was gone in a blink.
---
Yeah, getting her to play while she is interested is a good idea. If you want her to play Classic with you, then I'd just go with a private server for a little while. Retail and Classic are very different so if she decides that she really likes / dislikes retail, that doesn't necessarily mean she'll like/dislike Classic.
---
Mal'Ganis checking in! I was an Alliance Lock there too way back in the day. Good times, but holy hell were there a lot of Horde running around...
---
Where's your spirit buff? Priests are slacking.
---
Can you define FP and TB?
---
No, all servers are both now.
---
You set a warmode flag to decide what players you want to play with. Warmode on lets you play with all players that are PVP, warmode off lets you play with all players that are not PVP.
---
I know it's a joke, but this reminds of how annoying the bias is towards melee specs when it comes to mis-matched levels.  10 level 10 mages will absolutely die to a level 20 warrior because of the way resists are calculated which means none of them will get a single spell off for any damage.  On the other hand, 10 level 10 warriors versus a level 20 mage have a very good chance of bringing them down or at least doing some damage before they go.  Really wish they could address that somehow.
---
No mention of it at all iirc
---
[=O](https://i.imgur.com/sohWhy9.png)
---
Unless you are levelling a warrior, then the journey is hell lol
---
U can’t just put heads in water now out of nowhere
---
Classic is not about relaunching WoW. It's about preserving something which was lost for the ages. The same should be true for TBC, etc. So no, absolutely no changes.
---
:') ............... Good while it lasted
---
Yeah, my side was the opposite, there isn't 1 that would dictate as much effort as I'm willing to put in.
---
I WANT MY AV CHARGER IN PHASE 3
---
Flight Path and Thunder Bluff.
---
Oof
---
Warmode didn't fuck retail up. Calm down. all it does is let people try PVP without having to switch servers.
---
No, we are not, mister. I believe that we have to resolve this issue in battle.
---
LFM BFD Tank, Heal and 2 Dps. One of better dungeons. Some secret bosses if you are not familliar with the dungeon and noob fuckup with the braziers before the last boss. Damn I fucked once my group by activating all of them at once. Surprisingly they weren't mad.
---
the game will be very easy this time around and not due to better connections
---
I think he meant that it can work in a pinch to 60 if there are no other easy axe options without groups. There is a green axe in ungoro that may be the only axe upgrade that doesnt require dungeons or boe drops.
---
"Fucking Hunters. 
---
You're 20th on the DPS meter and lucky we are even bringing you.
---
You cant remember to do your ONE JOB and Dismiss Pet before we jump down????"
---
Other people addressed the other things, I'd like to add two things though:
---
to 2: we don't know yet. If retail buyback works differently this could be a case where they don't change it because it's not a substantial difference and just convenience. Similar to the decision to keep multi-item mail in.
---
to 4: You need to do the Shaman quests in Durotar / Mulgore to get your totems, so levelling in Tirisfal will be quite inefficient. I guess. Never played Shaman for long.
---
Barrens music intensifies.
---
Even if someone manages to grind up to R14 through incredibly unpredictable WPvP that's only one person and it'll take them a *minimum* of 3 months. Emphasis on minimum.  
---
I really don't see many people achieving that to be honest with you. And if they do then well played to them, I know I don't have what it takes to get R14 so why pull those who do back down to my level.
---
I'm sure you speak for all "vanilla hardcore pvpers"
---
I'm sure they all loved having to wait an hour to play a match of WSG
---
Nothing says "community" like having to sit around doing nothing
---
Yeah I ran like one instance on each fresh. I always do zf at like lvl 48-49 where I am an optimal level for it to make it faster, and there’s a lot of quests for an instance that takes no more than an hour. Plus that carrot on a stick is a must.
---
Wow how did I forget about it Extreme! Extreme, SOS, and Goon squad (don't know how I confused them with EJ) were the ones who use to cause havoc in pvp! Hey I look forward to seeing you back competing again also!
---
This guy gets it
---
I'm going to take PTO to rush to 60 (I wont make it in a week though) and then enjoy the game at my own pace. I leveled to mid 40s or 50s about a dozen times back in Classic/BC/WotLK but never raided in Classic or took pvp seriously.
---
While those of us on pve servers go on wondering when can we get the release date....
---
We’re getting Item Gating not Progressive itemisation 🙈
---
Inb4 Sean Bean dies again, poor guy.
---
The solution is not expecting people to flask. Just like it was in vanilla.
---
&gt;If i remember correctly if a healer or anyone with a buff flags themselves and then goes around healing everyone or buffing people then they all get flagged too. I'm pretty sure that was a thing.
---
You only get flagged if you heal someone that is already flagged, not the other way around.
---
Sweet, me too. :) Although I still haven't fully decided if I'll go with RP-PvP or just RP. But I'm leaning towards RP-PvP. Hopefully they have those at launch.
---
Noone is saying that 420 is the cap they are saying you don't need cap for most bosses.
---
Looks and sounds good to me, bub. I've actually seen very few troll/trash/low-effort posts and commenters on this subreddit specifically, so I think the moderation and general public so far has been great.
---
I'm ashamed to admit but I *DO* love memes, whatever they are. So I wouldn't be mad if this turns into a meme-fest  at and post launch. As long as the meme is more or less related to the Classic experience, I'm 100% for allowing them, either in image or video format.
---
Also, controversial belief, but I do support the *few notable streamers* who will be streaming Classic daily for the rest of their lives, so I'm also okay with allowing parts of their streams clipped and uploaded, or any discussion related to an event with/about them.
---
Just my thoughts :)
---
I'm assuming you were a casual pvper at best, am I right?
---
Had 100Mbit line at the uni at the time, so I can’t relate.
---
Have you tried getting verigan's fist on a fresh server? Having to group for 2 instances across continents seems like a huge time sink even if it is one of the best paladin leveling weapons.
---
Thank god I spec'd into imp feign death.
---
I guess that makes sense.
---
Try not to hope too hard, 'ey? Ignoring the fact that'd need developers who have the extremely archaic mindset of how raiding progressed back then (of which the original 4 Phase content plan showed that they don't have such developers), most people want Classic WoW, not Alternate Timeline WoW.
---
It's a hydra that resides in the deep water?
---
Many pservers had the xp rates of quests (primarily level 40+ quests) that were too high. The big servers have fixed it by now, but it was an issue on pservers for many years. There's also other things on pservers that make leveling different than retail -- some mobs have too low armor and/or missing abilities, and some quests are scripted incorrectly which makes them too easy (most escort quests are stupid easy on pservers compared to retail, for example)
---
where is the "of" ?
---
At least Warrior 2H DPS was still good damage lol, I think there was a reason for Arms warriors in raids but can't remember what it was now, could be misremembering
---
Damn that‘s a solid desk :-)
---
Actually, having all 40 members properly consumed / buffed will save gold and time spent raiding. More raid wide damage healing and threat, less chance to wipe, faster total raid clears. Wiping means 40x resurrections, rebuffs, re consumes -- easily 15 minutes per wipe
---
Most world buffs are either 60 or 120 minute duration, most consumables are either 30-60 min duration. You shouldn't need to rebuff or reconsume more than 1-2 times per raid
---
Ye like i said, guess we will see, i know they have a huge task at hand if they decide to bring in new changes.
---
There goes my good raid logs for week sigh. Gd lip always on cd.
---
Maybe it’s because I was on a high population realm, but TBC had tons of world PvP.
---
Easy fix, make killing flight masters into a Dishonorable kill.
---
Should be a great server stress test. Also I won’t be on AOL dial up this time!!
---
yeah that must have been it
---
It’s so painfully obvious you’re casual from what you just said. You don’t have a clue what you’re talking about. There will be the best players on the server, teamed up, relentlessly farming lowbies for 20 hours a day. You will *absolutely not* be “corpse camping FPs with stealth.
---
More like zergy aids lol. They are already a pita if they arnt popped immediately.
---
Felwood, between WPL and EPL, Ungoro, Tanaris will be absolute crazy with WPVP moreso than STV imo
---
Really disagree with "Post-Classic Content."  Discussing what happens post Naxx is valid discussion. I understand re-posts, but limiting discussion about a core issue with classic is ridiculous.
---
Seriously why is this a discussion. If you want wPvP you play PvP server and it is what it is. If that isn't what you want pick a PvE server.
---
&gt; you can safely assume that the minimum hardware requirements for running Classic will be that of modern WoW because the game will be running on the 7.3.5 (8.X?) client.
---
While I completely agree with removing these re-posts. I just wanted to point out that there is a good chance that the requirements will be lower than retail. It's using the same client, but lower poly models, less models, less special effects, no flying, lower res textures. etc.
---
At the core of it I hope they understand what makes vanilla great and retail wow a bore. Keep the mmo rpg focus, do not add mechanics that puts any of that at risk. From there they could go anywhere (not tbc wrath etc), a sort of second go at the Warcraft story, only with some more integrity.
---
Don't think you got my point then..
---
This, flasks were for like "we're stuck on this boss, next raid we try flasking" - the expectation wasn't that everyone was flasked all the time, there physically wasn't enough spawns for that to happen.
---
Thank you for limiting the subreddit to current content and not post-classic content.
---
Hopefully, they will! I am in the same boat, RP-PVP or riot!
---
How about BRE?
---
I cleared halfway through nax and I don't think I ever flasked. Flasks were pretty much reserved for MT to cut down on tank deaths.
---
I like telling people who demand that I loot a mob to go fuck themselves. It's worth more than the mobs loot.
---
Guild Banks would be good though so that you don't end up with bank characters, and they don't impact the gameplay or the world in any meaningful way.
---
Your comment is a great opportunity to expound on this:    
---
&gt;Also, controversial belief, but I do support the few notable streamers who will be streaming Classic daily for the rest of their lives, so I'm also okay with allowing parts of their streams clipped and uploaded, or any discussion related to an event with/about them.    
---
This isn't controversial at all! Our policy on this has been that streamers and content creators can feel free to post streams, clips or discussions about Classic. What would *probably* be removed are direct links to live streams themselves. This sub follows the Reddit sitewide guidelines on self-promotion. It's one thing to post your content and another to use the sub as a springboard for your brand. Hope that clarifies a few things!
---
Must be nice to be so retarded. I guess ignorance really is bliss.
---
EPIC!!!!!!!!
---
I'd like to add a recommendation to the census. 
---
On average, how much gold do you plan to spend on Noggenfogger Elixir?
---
But I’m saying that it’s less efficient to do the grind. Like to get to that rank you are competing against pvp players who have more time because they are not doing raids. Especially for the top tier raiders you are talking about it’s just not worth giving up time in other areas. Like if you spend 4 months getting people to rank 10 then if you go hard and raid for 1 week you’ll lose the rank 10 because of decay. You cannot raid progress and pvp because there are only 24 hours in a day. There are the pvp players spending 18 hours a day grinding so if you even take 1 day off pvping to raid then you’ll fall off because of the system. You are right people do the insane grind, but those players don’t raid because they physically cant because if you’re not pvping you’re deranking.
---
I WAS HERE
---
Paladin called and said blizzard was a bunch of idiots about many things.
---
It won’t stay low pop. I’m talking about an hour into launch.
---
Hi, /u/fyregeyer
---
I second this notion. It would be very hard to separate Vanilla from discussions about post-Vanilla.  Any decision made by blizzard would greatly influence decisions and maybe even gameplay of Vanilla itself.  Quick and dirty example: Maybe someone wants to pick a class that was crazy OP in Burning Crusade or something.
---
Should re rename the sub "Classic up to 1.12 vanilla wow"?
---
I’ll see my fellow refugees in Desolace
---
Why does everyone say you don't start with capital? IIRC you most certainly do. 
---
I just checked through joana's speedrun, and he does NOT pick up the flightpath the 2 times he visits orgimmar early. Pretty sure that's enough proof.
---
i agree with you TBH, my first character to 60 was a rogue and i did it in about 14 days of /played using thottbot and not knowing any of the quests.  All while leveling skinning and LWing to almost max.
---
i did it faster the next two times as there was a bit less congestion and i switched over to a PVE realm so i didn't have to worry about gankfests.
---
i would say it took closer to 12 days on my warrior and about 9 or 10 days on my priest if i recall correctly again i leveled professions and did dungeons in this time frame as well.
---
I am playing on a private server right now just to get my feet wet and get back into the swing of things and its a lot of fun for sure but i am using a questing addon which is already speeding me up even though i am playing alliance and i have never made it past the starting zones previously.
---
i am going to be on limited playtime by classic launch so i am going to focus on leveling as fast as i can.  I am really hoping to get it down to about 6 to 7 days of played being very selective with what i spend my time on.
---
Nah i hear ya, newer changes could just aswell been horrible.
---
I do know though IF they decide to add some changes, they would have a lot of experience doing so by looking at past expansions.
---
&gt; One thing that most PVP player don't get 
---
Why would a PvP player not *get* that? They get ganked just like you. Those ?? Alliance probably aren't discriminating. *No one likes being ganked.* In your scenario, you (PvE) and countless others (PvP players)  are being ganked on a PvP server. What's different in the mind of a PvE player vs. a PvP player that when ganked, the PvEr rerolls/opts out to an appropriate server and the other perseveres?  
---
I've ONLY ever played PvP, so I'm interested in the distinction - you guys can educate me. Why does unfair/non-consensual pvp defeat the PvE player and not the PvPer? When I get ganked, I add those guys to the list. At 60, I'm coming at them out of nowhere like it's [I Saw the Devil](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY1NjE1NTE0MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTYzNjUzNA@@._V1_.jpg) for some revenge. Why don't I just opt out, though?
---
The flight path camping really came about from private server spergs.
---
I lived in the suburbs of a large (not major) American city and had this problem throughout vanilla with our DSL cable
---
I agree with this 5000%.  Have stuff like the arena in the world for semi-organized world PvP, but it should have never been separate instanced zones.
---
&gt;  have the reflexes of 30 year olds
---
It just means I have 15 more years of practice than you, young man.
---
I think this is an interesting idea, and would depend on a number of factors. What is your definition of a cyber-religion, for example? Also, religious structures traditionally have a set of core beliefs, enunciated through dogmas or doctrines of the faith. It would be interesting to see what the main tenets of a WoW faith would be in this context. Is the phrase #NoChanges an article of faith in the Classic community? I’m not sure, even if I do think that those who oppose #NoChanges are heretics....  ;-)
---
Either way good luck, and feel free to PM me if you’d like.
---
A certain popular unofficial server player I see. On classic this will be very expensive as it will not be able to farm it in AV. And it will have normal spawn rates, not like it is on the private server you are playing.
---
That book is a stack of lies.
---
Some people just want to watch the world burn.
---
Soupa SUCC
---
Would tightening up the brackets help at all do you think? Say if max lvl folks only get ranks from killing other max levels, lvl 59 peeps get it from lvl 55-59, etc.? Even if just for phase 2?
---
It's hard to dispute that. WoW especially in it's early days (have no idea about modern wow) was extremely addictive...But I think most of the addictive aspects of it came from leveling. After hitting max level the community is probably what kept you playing. Alts too of course but if you weren't into alts then the community I think is what made you stay... 
---
Parallels could maybe be drawn between the community keeping you in a religion and the community keeping you playing vanilla wow. That's probably stretching it, but if hes doing a master thesis in some kind of liberal arts then word count probably matter.
---
Wow is a helluva drug.
---
Meme is 5 panes for you mobile users
---
Don’t you need to maintain rank 14 to use the weapon?
---
If there's no changes to vanilla there should be no changed to any other expansion.
---
The latter: Roll what you enjoy. Rogue DPS in raids is great.
---
Fine, but a complete glass cannon missing all of the great PvP Frost talents. As the winter's chill mage I did something like 17/0/34 and still had ice barrier, ice block, shatter etc. That was a much better pve/PvP build
---
This is wrong. Druids are also better at Jin'do (immune to poly), vael (since they generate more threat), and a few other encounters
---
I plan on doing a full deadmines run at 20/21 for quests and such, so that's fairly moot.
---
So only concern is SFK, and that's fairly doable with a group of 3 paladins, just need to get past the first boss, 10 minutes.
---
BFD is a nonissue, kor gem drops outside the instance.
---
I don't anticipate getting it before 23/24, but once 2 or 3 other paladins are around, it's easy to get, and not that time consuming... could get it done in an hour just doing the bare minimum for the dungeon portions.
---
As I get around 20, I'll be keeping an eye out in /who for paladins around the same level and keeping in touch.
---
Um count me in. Gnome mage here.
---
With that logic that means world pvp will be unplayable in Classic
---
You need rank 14 to purchase the weapons, after you have purchased them it does not matter. There would be only a few people using the weapons each week if that was the case.
---
Or even if what after phase 6 they decide to do a phase 7 balance update.  That would drastically change what people might consider playing.
---
pretty good comment and username combo
---
this is whats up.
---
Imagine how you would feel if the TBC community decided vanilla.
---
#NoChanges to TBC, but I think we should add flying mounts and LFG To vanilla.
---
Yeah... Don't be that guy.
---
Thanks for this!
---
Are you sure you dont just hate them now? Pretty sure a majority of people wanted flying back in the day.
---
You’re just intensely ignorant. The only WPvP will be flight path camping from the spergiest spergs.
---
Has there been any discussion about what will happen when the list of server names is released, assuming it will be before launch. It might be nice if we had a sticky to an official strawpoll to let the sub vote on which one should be the unofficial reddit server.
---
Well, depends on which version of BRE we get, but horde will definitely use it. When I was in a horde guild getting world record speedkills basically every warrior was 2H fury with BRE, and those that weren't just hadn't gotten a BRE yet.
---
Flight path corpse camping phase.****
---
Getting pre-raid BiS gear was more of an issue for my Rogue than getting a spot in raids. Rogues, Warriors, Hunters, and the occasional melee hybrid class are all vying for Truestrike Shoulders, Baron's cape, Mask of the Unforgiven, etc.
---
But what happens after I spend literally over a hundred days of actual game time ingame?? If blizzard doesn’t add more content to one of the biggest games ever created I’m gonna lose it!!
---
Thanks! Typically I’d want to hunt down low 50s, but I guess going for the helpless 48s are the way to go
---
Fortnite crowd wouldn't even get past their level ten class quest.  Gl finding bear form as tauren druid.
---
I guess in this case this means some NEET living in a country with good welfare, so now he's renting his mom's basement, so it's technically his own.
---
Human Warlock for me, there won't be that much competition for lock stuff probably.
---
*cries in low effort memes*
---
Kidding a side, you seem to have a great control on the subreddit, ive only been active here for a short while but already feel the community is overall positive and excited as a whole about the Classic release.
---
Keep up the good job.
---
There are very few players that will get to rank 14 on a server. I do not see how this makes a huge difference. This will not affect the pve on the servers in any significant way. Let the ppl that nolife to rank 14 get the overpowered weapons.
---
Yeah, I know.  That's why I said I realize I'm being a hypocrite.  But OP asked for opinions, and I gave mine.
---
T3 has no wasted stats and has really nice bonuses for your single target healing.
---
Looking forward to seeing the subhumans in this sub bitch and moan in every second post.
---
I died and lost so much shit in RuneScape thanks to shitty dialup internet. We eventually upgraded which lead my brother and I to play other "bigger" games (WoW.)
---
In a way, I can blame annoying house phones for my WoW addiction.
---
But knowing how strong they are people will try to flask regardless.
---
You can't just have a consumable and then say "oh yeah but it's so rare so you can't use them except for these cases", that doesn't work. Supply and demand, rich mages will get flasks regardless how it hurts other guilds ability to flask up for progress.
---
&gt;Is it really that hard to find a raid spot as a popular class
---
Raid spots are easy:
---
- Play good
---
- Don't play not good.
---
Alternately, if there are other rogues vying for spots too:
---
- Play gooder
---
Hahaha, imagine getting a bunch of casuals to kill, say, a 20-man &lt;APES&gt; party stacked with FAPs and Sappers. Oh wait, you’re someone who doesn’t think FP camping will be an issue, you’re unaware of what those are.
---
For PVP im a warrior and i TC.. RBG groups need a TC and i have no issue filling that role. I love the important roles! 
---
Back in the day i was a Healer and or Hunter and im talking like vanillia/BC days because hunters were Solid DPS and were loved because of the CC. so when you were running a heroic or a raid i felt badass pulling a mob off of the tank and would line him to my trap felt important to the raid for what i bring. being a pointless DPS was just boring to me.
---
If only it wasn't so far away.
---
Do we have a release date yet other than the vague "it b out in sumr sum time ...maybe"
---
There's a cap to buffs and clearly the player in the raid is a physical dps as he has juju might on. He does not need the spirit buff so he unclicks it to make room for procs like crusader.
---
If you listen to this sub, PvP realms will be 60% of the total population, RP realms would be 39%, and PvE realms would be 1%. Jesus the amount of bandwagoning in this sub is unbearable. Most of you people won't play on RP or RP-PvP realms, and yet you're all freaking out. Just play PvP like the rest of us, Jesus.
---
look deeper at the text I removed and the text I kept
---
Uhhh? Really? Random people making up random theories about post-naxx is useful somehow?
---
As soon as blizzard says anything it's allowed to be discussed here, but until this is just worthless speculation that gets repeated 20 times a day.
---
&gt; Posts related to “post-Classic” discussion will be removed as reposts until one of the following occurs: Phase 3 is released **or Blizzard makes a motion suggesting new content/expansions would be released.
---
Did you guys miss this part?**
---
You would have to be really stupid to flask for the majority of raids. A flask used to cost 70g on my server and it wasn't even that big of a pve server. A week of raiding with flask and you have had epic mount.
---
Please sober up before posting
---
**flare**
---
**feign death**
---
**ice trap**
---
Try me.
---
I want to play on a PVP server.  I want the total warzones in Hillsbrad and STV, BUT, I also want to be able to play with my kids who won't be able to handle that yet.  I might end up playing on 2 servers at once...
---
What a sublime Idea!!
---
The point of vanilla is they were continually improving and adding to the core game and balancing.  "Post-classic" is important!  Especially since we know we have Blizzards ear now.
---
For real
---
DUUUUUUUUUUUDDDEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Going there at level 30 is a suicide, unless it's during the early stage of Classic launch.
---
All these posts are futile. They only have 1.12 data (and little bit before that but they would have said if that amounted to anything substantial, so basically 1.12). They'll not patch their game with random data from third party websites (not matter how "authentic" those are). So everything will be 1.12. They'll withhold certain items before certain content rollout phases but that's it.
---
And maybe some more structured open-world PvP elements as well. Things like the EPL towers. I've always wanted to have a reason to fight on the Thandol Span.
---
Either one of you could run to the others with no problems.  Just stay on the road and avoid mobs.  There are Warrior and Shaman trainers in both starting areas.  Hell, I run my undeads to the Orc starting area because I don't like the undead one.  No biggie.  Plus I pretty much get a free level from discovery XP.
---
So, neither then.  Because neither "Vanilla" nor "Classic" was used at the time; the correct name would be simply "World of Warcraft".
---
&gt;These thoughts are also why I think Raid Buffs are dumb and wish they would get removed upon zoning into an instance haha
---
Imo it's more fun to get a billion world buffs and clear through farm content as fast as possible trying not to die, than just slowly clearing through shit you've cleared hundred times before with hardly any loss from wiping other than a bit extra time. 
---
Worldbuffs adds a whole new "mode" to raiding, and that is clearing it without dying. It gets really fun at AQ because god there's so much random shit that kills you.
---
Why did the decide to put DKs back in? They don't do anything to stop griefing.
---
11 months? They haven’t mentioned any time for the phases yet, only what the phases will include
---
Plus you can grab Camp T flight path and XRoads FP on the way
---
&gt; and continue on your way
---
LMFAOOOOOOOOOOO holy fucking shit
---
I was torn between mage and druid for a while but now i'm leaning more towards druid as I feel like i'll overall have more fun with the class in every part of the game. Even though people consider them to be good at nothing I still feel like they bring a lot of utility to a group specially in pvp.
---
Well, if the group is solid. It still has tough parts for an inexperienced group without any sheeps. Also,  2 hunter pets would honestly be a better tank than a warrior that facepulls 8 mobs in every tight room. Doesn't matter that a warrior might take less damage, if that warrior is constantly fighting twice as many mobs for no reason.
---
When do you think the Runecloth bags will be on the AH and cheap.  Mats seem easy to come by no?  
---
These would be 14 slot bags and you could just load up (assuming you have enough gold).
---
Ignore this comment, if you are not drunk is it even worth posting?
---
&gt;A week of raiding with flask and you have had epic mount.
---
Depends how much you raiding there.. On pservers I recently played a mage, I used a flask for every single raid from launch to when I quit after clearing AQ a couple of times. Flasks on this server cost between 70-130 gold(varied a lot especially with ZG coming out and making BL not bound). We raided 1 or 2 times a week, and I used 1-3 flasks per week. 
---
I had no issues with that.
---
That BRD grind for HOJ, rip.
---
So ignorant.
---
This sub is garbage. Repetitive posts and reposts because you mods are fucking useless. Literally no discussion anywhere. Where can I find some people that like the game instead of shit in it all day?
---
When I make an Orc character I kill a few boars to make 50copper, then I run him off the back cliff to  Ratchet, then to Xroads, then to Camp T, and out to Thunderbluff.  Then fly to Org, and take zep to GromGol, then from there to UC, then run and get UC Flight Path, then hearth back to Orc Starting area.  I've done that many times and don't die.  I usually get back to Orc start as level 3 or 4 and ready to level.  Not sure why you fail at it so hard.  It's not that hard.
---
"Where we droppin, boys?"  
---
All over Nessingwary's camp, boys.
---
You realize that’s still really fucking bad, right?
---
I understand that you want changes, but isn't there just a little bit inside you saying that maybe you should want something that isn't the best for you, but the best for the game?
---
Chill
---
Now try being a tank in a dungeon with mining nodes. 
---
"Oh cool, a thorium vein up ahead."
---
*Pulls mobs next to the vein.*
---
*DPS taps it in the middle of the fight.*
---
I second playing Gooder. It’s harder to do when drunk but it’s possible
---
Lowbie: steps into STV
---
*Fortunate Son plays*
---
It doesn't change or impact anything in a substantial way.
---
sounds like my old crew UPK (United Player Killers) - we kill and corpse ganked all day long.
---
It's because they want to be able to do it when they are max level. It's never fun for anyone to be ganked, but sociopaths love ganking others, and will put up with a little bit of pain just so they can go do it to others. It's a sort of power trip.
---
Clean that keyboard!
---
You know that's server dependent right? IF was dead on my main server in vanilla... It was all about sw.....
---
These people act like we all played in one wow server lol
---
Rofl, go to the main page and open your eyes. So much low effort trash and insensitive world war 2 posts about PvP.
---
Hope you enjoy dust
---
Ohh right that's what I was thinking of
---
Distance is not always the problem, sometimes it's about the routing. The path taken. It is possible for a VPN to speed things up.
---
The main problem is that Phase 2 will push casuals to leave when casuals are what keeps a game alive. The current iteration of Phase 2 will absolutely kill the game.
---
For sure.
---
I will PM you where I am seeing these people discussing how you CANNOT be crit by any boss besides Chromag and Nef if you have 420 defense. People are beginning to echo this information.
---
I can’t post it as a private server Reddit has the post and a bot blocks it.
---
Shield block is awesome to keep up however it does certainly put a dent in your threat output.
---
Strangly, the most popular Alliance race/class combination is Tauren druid.
---
Religion: people placing faith in,   
---
Leaders.(People who create the doctrines).    
---
Prophets.(People who predict/warn based on the faith).      
---
Texts.(Writings meant to teach, train, inform).     
---
Preachers/Evangelists.(People who propagate the faith).     
---
I can think of a dozen "nonreligious" ideologies in today's world that meet these, not sure if WoW does.
---
this is why you run everywhere and scope out flight masters with a friendly hunter flare
---
Fun story, over the weekend on a Psever, it was my holy pally healing and 4 hunters. We cleared Deadmines and only wiped once in the smelting room.
---
Care to link the video?
---
People have been playing pservers with 100-300 ms because they are only located in europe, and honestly it's not that bad. Wow is a simple game where latency isn't the biggest issue unless if you are doing high end pvp.
---
Can you tell me from which source this info is coming from or at least where I can search for these statements?
---
There are plenty of hardcore guilds though
---
This guy knows what's up.
---
the barren??
---
I don't think it will be an issue because of the amount of people that will be distressed by it. By virtue of that fact, there will be far more requests and plans subverted, potentially bringing more people into a fight that they must deal with.
---
I also don't think it will be an issue because that was the way it was in Vanilla in terms of content being released. It will be what it will be, and it won't be that way after a few months. That's closer to Vanilla than having the 1.12 items and Honor System released with BGs.
---
I see the potential for PvP guilds to form specifically for this, people who may not want r14, but some PvP rank, and may do so by zerging grinding groups in problem FPs. Maybe it's just for fun too, because that is SO easily forgotten in today's min-max climate.
---
You have tunnel vision bestowed upon you by private server elitism and isolationism from a far more social and friendly community than a bunch of min-maxers sweating on each other in a legally grey area server grinding r14 on the other 1% boi's alts.
---
Worst I had to grind for my Warlock was Dark Advisor's Pendant. Pretty terrible drop chance, and it usually took some effort/bribing to get pugs to willingly clear the student room in Scholo to kill Vectus.
---
The background pic should be APES blasting lowbies at a flight path. That’s all P2 will be. If you really believe P2 will lead to “epic world fights,” you’re more delusional than the current Democratic Party.
---
Black lotus for flasks.  Or just flasks in general as they are the actual consumable.
---
Hi, /u/888Kraken888
---
so your first post is just wrong, and in the second you randonly insult. you seem to be a very nice person! :)
---
Yeah, I get it.  Again, I didn't write up a thesis arguing for changes to be implemented or anything.  I literally just said *"I would be on board"* with them.  I think you're looking for an argument that's not there, bro.
---
lol typical ally errand boy quests.
---
This is pretty much the scepter of shifting sands quest line already in Vanilla, but they could totally do that concept again for a post Naxx 40 man pre event or something. im down.
---
Why wasn’t the pic a flight path destination????
---
Who are you talking to?
---
Can level 5 alts train professions all the way up to 300 if you have the mats?
---
Or are certain recipes only available at certain toon levels?  Thanks.
---
I haven't played Classic WoW since, well, Vanilla.
---
Part of me is tempted to *play it on a certain type of place* but with us being maybe 5 months max away, part of me is wondering if I should hold onto the magic until Classic launches.
---
Those who have been playing Classic I imagine have sort of "lost" the magic that maybe I still contain since I haven't played Classic since Vanilla.

Good meme, tiptop
---
 Can’t wait to play a Tauren Druid for the alliance.
---
i am wondering whether i will be going hunter or prot warrior... all the fun builds are so bad in classic (like shadow priest or ele shaman)
---
Not at all
---
I don't think people won't really take a 40 man raid anywhere unless they are ambushing raids in BRM or in Hillsbrad. But I do see there being a lot of small groups roaming around which will sometimes combine into bigger fights. 
---
And everyone focuses on STV due to leveling, but Fellwood was one of the most brutal places to go.

Not really. Most people don't want that kind of effort. Most guilds raid 3 days, which is pretty casual. Some still do 5 days a week, which I consider semi-casual. Last time I went out to find a guild that I would be comfortable with knowing that everyone put the same amount of effort into the game I ended up in Method. Basically the only guild that matched the effort I was willing to put into the game.

---
It’s hyperbolic to say there will be only 2 raid groups. Not that many raids expected you to flask back in the day. Tier one doesn’t require flasking at all. 
---
It won’t slow down hard core progression raiders because they were going to be fighting for nodes and grinding for consumes anyway. 
---
The casual raids that don’t expect tons of consumes won’t be majorly changed by this.
---
"go hard and raid for 1 week" isn't really a thing though since the only raid is MC and that only takes 1-2 hours of your time once a week
---
You’re delusional lol, posted a picture that has nothing to do with what you wrote.
---
I would disagree.  Earth totem is pretty much given to you in the starting area, and Fire totem is just a bunch of running from Barrens to Razor Hill and back.  
---
While leveling my Shamans I only ever used Fire totem while fighting personally.  I used Earth totems to get past mobs with Stoneclaw and Earthbind.
---
Never did I need Air or Water...but I always leveled with Shield/1H and Flametongue/fire totem/flameshock/and +fire gear.
---
Aha okay... there are still plenty of HC guilds. What you consider “semi casual” is actually hardcore. No semi guild raids 5 nights a week.
---
I always preferred range to melee when I dps'ed. Never really put it down to a reason, but this is probably why.
---
Just bubble...*laughs in paladin*

---
So will I be able to get the black scarab mount and use it on retail? 🤔
---
Puts ready
---
I'm not really a fan of the implementation myself but there's literally no evidence to support this. It's a larger issue on private server population, and those numbers didn't suffer at all. It's mitigated heavily by a blizzlike population cap. It will suck sometimes, but I think you're seriously overexaggerating how big of an issue it is.
---
From what I can remember from my vanilla days, we had 8/9 warriors mostly arms, lol.  We had 2 dw warriors, myself with thunderfury (but I main tanked most of the time) and another who was using Deathbringer from Ony.
---
I meant to say semi-hardcore. But that's the difference in perception.
---
PVE?
---
And picking off randos in leveling zones will be better than a constant warzone with 100's of players of the opposite faction that give honor? According to Nano (one of the guys that ran Nost), the best place to farm honor was actually camping flight masters so I guess we'll see where the honor farmers end up going..
---
Yeah, and getting every 5-second rule tick of mana before people start to get worried about their health. Theres a lot of little things to maximize as a healer, thats definitely part of the fun for me.
---
Oh, you have the reading comprehension of a dead animal.
---
Ohhh that guy can go fuck himself
---
I can so relate. My main MMO was Runescape. I died to Jad so many times cause of this!
---
HUG THE FUCKIN SURGERS
---
I wish that were the case. 
---
Can’t post this because of the subreddit it’s on. (The bot blocks it). This kind of stuff is echo’d all over the place.
---
“Why is noone talking about the soft cap ? 420 makes you immune to crit attacks from 98% of bosses. ONLY NEFARION AND CHROMAGUS need 440 defense to be crit imune. For all the rest, its 420. WHY DOES NOONE KNOW THIS?! Why do i have to argue with my guids tanks, who go on nef with 380 def and when asked why arent u crit immune i get " it was nerfed man, u cant get to 440" wich is total bullshit. And when they get 2 unlucky crits from nef in their imba "stamina gear" they blame healers ? Its hilarious :D”
---
My take:
---
Warrior: Stance quests of course. Whirlwind axe is optional as alliance because you can do SM for bonebiter which is better. I think whirlwind is more efficient though and then skipping SM.
---
As horde you can do the lv20 gear quest it doesn't put you much out of the way if you go for a corpsemaker at 29. But corpsemaker is very hard to get so it's risky.
---
Rogue: The horde version of the lv10 quest is good, alliance one you can skip. Obviously you gotta do the posion quest which requires you level lockpicking from another quest. I believe there's a quest to get free thistletea, don't go out of your way but if it fits the route then it's fine.
---
Hunter: Obviously rush pet as soon as you can. There's no other quests though.
---
Shaman: Get fire and earth totem. You can entirely skip water until 60, air you should do at 30-ish. I very much like doing this quest right before doing shimmering flats at lvl31, the end of the quest is in 1k needles and you get a very OP buff at the turn in which you can use to grind 1k(though care with gankers!).
---
Druid: Bear quest duuuh. The aqua and cleanse quest is not worth doing. Perhaps at lvl40 you can do aqua form idk.
---
I don't play priest/pala sorry.
---
Warlock: Do imp quest immediately on fresh it's insane dps increase. Voidwalker at 10 of course eventhough the quest kinda sucks. Skip succusbus and felhunter until 60. 
---
I've skipped mentioning the lvl50 quests, because these were added later in the game, I don't know whether or not they will be available or not on launch. They pretty much all provide amazing gear and they are worth trying out, though you need to do sunken temple for most of them if I recall correctly. I think druid and hunter don't? Either way you gotta consider that. Sunken temple kinda sucks as a dungeon, but for many classes it's actually useful gear at 60 so probably worth doing at lowlvl despite it slowing you down.
---
You need to play what you preffer. Some speccs like SP or Ele are good, they just need gear to scale. In other Words, you will need to play more to have that gear but will be satisfied once you completed.
---
That makes you a dick
---
Limiting discussion about the later expansions (TBC, WotLK) makes sense to me, though thus far that discussion really hasn't been frequent enough to bother me in the slightest. However, I don't see why discussion about possible "post-Naxx content" as it has been dubbed, as an extension to the vanilla Classic WoW, should be limited. It seems quite pertinent to Classic, and it's not like it's frequent enough to be annoying either.
---
Thats fair, I hope i get a couple days off near launch myself. My prediction is that the 1-10 zone will be a peaceful haven, and then when you step into any major city or the next zone, it's just an immediate clusterfuck.
---
You’re actually a moron. 
---
Also bringing up apes in all your comments like a fucking fanboy is just sad.
---
I understand that perspective and see where you are coming from if you look at it from a speed of the whole guild type perspective, but my personal favorite thing to do is to compete on the meters for server DPS records against other people in different guilds (or your own previous parses), and it sucks only having 1 chance a week to do so and being at the mercy of someone else to actually get a chance.
---
The RNG of the darkmoon buff alone is enough variance to make it luck based and then some random hunter wiping the raid and making that week's parse irrelevant sucks big time. I dont particularly care about clear times as I do for there being an even footing to compete against others for optimal DPS. 
---
In my eyes it would kind of be like trying to speed run Dark Souls or something where other speedrunners would randomly get to /roll 1-100 once a week and if they got a 90+ they would get a 10% movespeed bonus or something. It would just end up making 90% of their attempts be useless and it would be outside their control.
---
I’ve been going back and forth between mage and Druid for months but I think I’m just gonna main Druid and have my mage as an alt mostly because they seem really boring in pve.
---
That's funny because I have the same impression about you. :)
---
Well in the scenario that op describes, yeah it would. But if I kill a mob out in the world while soloing and some guy demands that I loot my mobs so that he may more easily profit off my work. I'll tell em to shove it.
---
I've been thinking close to an OSRS situation. Raids were NOT part of RuneScape in 2007, but we're added and fit the themes and desires of players. I'd imagine they add new stuff with the same feel that fits in Vanilla. This is complete speculation based off how a different game handled their situation, but it's all I've really got to base any kind of guess.
---
I’d also add that on encounters that require only one tank, having a Feral is better than having a second Prot, because they can heal and innervate.
---
I’ve been all for WoW 2 since cataclysm. Allows them to cut down on tons of mechanics they don’t plan on supporting down the line. 
---
I’m pretty sure they would never use classic as an opportunity to reboot WoW, but I would be pretty stoked if they did. 
---
I was also kind of hoping the sword in Azeroth/azurite bleeding from the ground would be sort of a doomsday and we’d reboot anyway, but BFA isn’t exploring that at all. 
---
The only way players are getting a good MMO is through classic. Which is fine, but long term i would like WoW to be good again.
---
I tried to do some research on this, and I think it is. Without any talents or skills, the hits should be relatively the same. 
---
Just keep in mind that a hunter is a bit squishier, and their gain a much greater advantage from a bow, but otherwise their 2handed swings should be similar on blank slates.
---
Not entirely true, there’s a shaman trainer at Stonard in the Swamp of Sorrows. Granted not very realistic to get there for a low leveling character
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b4hpic/blizzard_only_has_112_data_why_do_they_pretend/
---
I might come off as a bit combative. That's not intended. I was just a bit frustrated. :) In any case there are links there.
---
Tbh I think going for 2hander in DM then Archeus at 28-29 is probably better. Depends obviously on whether you can find those paladins or not I suppose, but getting to ashenvale while doing a deadmines related run seems like a lot of time investment.
---
You will have dominant guilds pushing for rank 14 on Classic, sorry. Flight paths will be relentlessly camped 20 hours a day by those guilds. You just don’t know what you’re talking about.
---
I don't think that's gonna make the cut.
---
For me:
---
No transmog
---
Only 1 raid size &amp; difficulty (WotLK)
---
Damn, I liked Soupasoka's beard.
---
And they have pets so it’s actually more.
---
Aaaahhh sunken temple
---
Once every 2 years? The gear reset is every major patch now.
---
Checking comments in 2019.
---
Referencing the best PvP guild makes me a fanboy. 
---
I’m gonna take a wild guess and say you don’t vote Red.
---
Yep, summer at some point, sadly.
---
Assuming same race, same level, no talents and naked, yes. The damage would be very close.
---
My understanding is: the general calculation of ranged attack power (rap) and attack power (ap) goes: strength: 1ap, agility: 1 rap. 
---
Warriors and paladins: strength: 2ap
---
Rogues hunters and cat druids: agility: 1ap
---
Hunters agility: 2rap.
---
With that said, naked at the same level, you will have a small difference in attack power from your race, so a small difference in damage.
---
The more gear a warrior gets at 2ap per str, the warrior's attacks will do more damage, unless you find hunter gear with agility+strength=the warriors strength on gear.
---
I'm 34, career, wife, kid, etc. I only can play a few hours a night, and i'm rolling a warrior at that (so I dont have to spend 45 mins in IF looking for a tank) That being said I am still going pvp server. It's something about that wild world, knowing that the second you step out of the base camp, there was danger lurking around every corner.
---
I won't lie, I'm glad i'm gonna play heals, so I can rarely/occasionally actually miss a raid or two for real life and not be making the raid way harder. I still want to be a core member of a team, but MT just has too much riding on you to enjoy the game, imo. Of course I'd also love to be the guy with Thunderfury, but I can't have it all. I can wait til Ulduar comes out in 2016 and I can get my Valanyr.
---
Found this [https://youtu.be/NxJG2txrNDE](https://youtu.be/NxJG2txrNDE)
---
great meme, mate, even rhymes. Also it is real :i
---
I got ganked way more while I was leveling my main undead warlock than my alt a troll priest in STV..
---
This is my thought exactly that I think people dont consider and often just jump to "flying mounts ruined WoW".
---
It’s off of your feral damage range on the character sheet when in form.
---
Eh, there's just one guy in the comments of that post that thinks different bosses have different def caps. Another guy also mentioned 420 being the crit cap against level 59 enemies in BRD, which is correct so he clearly understands the mechanic. The thread creator and commenters in general aren't contesting whether or not 440 is the boss def cap, they're arguing that reaching def cap often requires sacrificing too many other stats. Which is absolutely the case for tanks that haven't built up a lot of good raid gear yet.
---
I remember tricking people into flagging for PvP with Duel and a macro. 
---
You'd /Duel them and then when they start attacking you hit a macro that was /yield /PvP and if they weren't attentive they would hit you outside of the Duel because you were flagged, thus making them flagged as well.
---
If I log into a pserver on my shadow I get a better ping most times than in the house Im logging into the shadow.  Its honestly back and forth
---
There's only one prominent area in the entire game that can be gameplay denied. It's glaringly obvious you haven't played during original vanilla or on any of the large private servers if you think this is actually going to affect the population of classic in a remarkable way.
---
Wow. Warriors are much more popular in the Alliance than Horde.
---
Yes, it makes you a fan boy. I’m not American, I don’t live in a third world country.
---
Or even just eat the melee damage. I love healing as my druid, but so often I'll wait to heal, and still pull healing threat off of a weaker tank. Most of my gear is +healing from the AH, which is mostly cloth, so I'm squishy as fuck. Then, I have to decide whether I eat it for a second, or go to bear form and just not heal for 5 seconds :/
---
Having 200/300ms is not that bad (for wow at least) as long as it remains stable. The real struggle is when you ping starts going constantly up and down like crazy. Having it stable and not above 300 means that you can quest and do general pve content.
---
Don't underestimate 30 y-o boomers. Provided with enough Monster ultra zero they are a dangerous breed
---
the asshat I would corpse camp you and grief away I was a lovely teenager
---
Cannot fucking wait
---
Sure Pservers don't count but the are more likely inline with what to expect for Classic, aren' they? I can guarantee you that someone will break Joana record. 
---
There are mods out for the current wow that have fully optimized instructions/routes for level the fastest way possible, and I fully expect some similar mods to be in classic. 
---
When you factor in all the testing the would have happened on those "true" private servers, a lot of players are bound to get to 60 way faster than the true vanilla days, not to mentions most likely 100 of players will beat Joana's record.
---
The internet has come a long ways since 2004.
---
I literally could if I wanted to. I would show up and tell my manager, "my plans changed". The PTO isn't charged against you until after you take it. It's a flex schedule friendly work environment.
---
Lma,o not even American. I see why you think the way you do now. Sorry the government rapes you of all your income, euro slave boy.
---
Yeah. I can understand the thought process they had, but censoring discussion of post-Naxx seems like a bad move. Especially as now we’d need to decide at what point we can resume discussion on it. Overall, while discussion of post-Naxx content is repetitive, I think it is necessary.
---
Huh? Why
---
For PC specs.. It seems pretty simple.
---
If you can run retail WoW, you'll be able to run Classic WoW.
---
There is a real chance if you struggle to run retail WoW, you may struggle to run Classic WoW (Especially in 40 man content)
---
If you have a computer from like, 2010 onward.. You should be fine.
---
Yeah, seeing hunters line up trap after trap in the same fight is really satisfying to watch.
---
I’ve played on the relevant servers. Playing on original Vanilla and acting like anything from back then holds weight is exceedingly embarrassing. But, yes, obviously I played on original Vanilla, too.
---
I've edited my post a bit after you've responded to it but before your current post.
---
&gt;I believe that pre 1.11 versions of items should be in the database even if old versions of items are gone, because, instead of changing their stats they got new names, basically making entirely new items as a reward, while old item sets still exist on their own.
---
I was a noob but I made bank auctions off leather lmao
---
This^^^  
---
I rerouted the power button my my vox to a push button at foot level in the back of my desk.  I can plug in next to my desk and kick the button during wipes/flight paths
---
Lol blizzard is killing this game I hate pvp I like quests !!! :)
---
The meme is garbage, but from what ive seen in general chat in stv it really has some truth in it. People cry so much when theyre ganked in stv
---
&gt; Tbh I think going for 2hander in DM
---
The 20% drop chance Smite's Hammer? So waste ~3 hours for a fair chance of getting a 19DPS weapon instead of spending 2 hours getting a 25DPS one?
---
&gt; but getting to ashenvale while doing a deadmines related run seems like a lot of time investment.
---
I'll already have the Menethil harbor FP, take a boat and run down to Ashenvale is like 10 minutes.
---
Have an upvote.
---
I'm starting my PTO 2 days after launch - I'm not wasting days like I did at d3 launch.
---
The system is good for what it is, it's a wild west system where you can be a colossal douchebag but it's a kind of environment you opt into. If you're looking for fair fights that's what you have battlegrounds for. I know some people are looking for evenly matched organic world pvp but that very rarely happens, it's generally just very one sided ganking.
---
I dont think Def Cap is the right approach for Nefarian lol. Threat intensive fight.
---
Well first thing, you can try multiple times for DMF, most people do a couple of trys until they get a 7 or higher.
---
As for being reliant on your own guild well, dps meters depend heavily on how fast you kill the bosses so no matter how you spin it, you are gonna by guild reliant, and if you are someone to be very competitive then you are probably not gonna be a in guild that wipes very often from things like this. I don't actually recall any of such wipes from my last guild, obviously there were deaths, some not the dying players fault, but it wasn't bad.
---
That honestly sounds like a dream team right there. I can't imagine the desperation when any defias gear drops, though.
---
You’re not American? You’re not EU either. So you’re Canadian?
---
I remember it the other way around. The internet took priority. My dad was livid when he found out that his employer was trying to contact him all weekend but got dial up busy sound the whole weekend.
---
"Someone still has to loot the core hound!!!"
---
Yeah there are also special cases like Rut’theran village which automatically gives you the fp to darkshore.
---
"Fuck." Promptly followed by clicking the buff button again.
---
yet world pvp still happen very often on private server.
---
If you are good and friendly it will not be an issue at all.
---
You said you were doing DM either way so..There's an axe too, and even with the 1hander dropping, some just go 1hand + shield until better. Obviously if nothing drops for you, then you can go for the hammer.
---
Reminder that all the ranker are not aiming for rank 14. Most are actually aiming for rank 10 max. Which will still involve fly path and leveller farming.
---
A few suggestions I have for the census:
---
1) How would you want Classic to continue post-Naxx? (BC servers, 1.13+, fresh servers that go through the phases all over again, nothing at all, or whatever else you mods want to add to the list)
---
2) Which of the six Phases are you most excited to play? (Phase 1, Phase 2, etc.)
---
I want TBC and Wrath with no changes as well. If I can relive those years again I would.
---
Once you have target then his health bar stands out from other players assuming you don't have friendly nameplates.
---
Ok good to know thanks, do you by chance know how thats calculated? Like how much ap = 1 point sheet dps?
---
Ah, that makes sense. Thanks for elaborating!
---
True, however I have seen and heard people echoing the same thing.
---
One guy actually says I am not sue why the defense cap is higher for Chromag and Nef but I heard it from “Russian PVE people”
---
Got a good laugh from that one.
---
Apparently someone named “Skar” or something kinda of started this in a video which I cannot find for the life of me.
---
Either way that’s not a bad way to go about defense, but I do not agree with it personally. I prefer 440 for every boss during progression. Dropping down for a couple of threat pieces when clear times and dps threat output starts kicking up is usually my way of going about it.
---
Mate I'm sorry but the reason no guilds raid that many days a week is because the raids don't take that long to do. Sure you can put that much in for progression but no guilds is going to advertise a progression schedule as there normal schedule. A guild advertising 3 days probably right up your ally.
---
Same, will really mess with peoples heads! For the alliance!
---
People clown on Swifty now for being awful at WoW now, but no one can deny he broke Warriors back in the day. Swifty's Incredible Tricks was legendary.
---
Have you done any relatively large pvp in retail? This is 40 v 40 in an instance BG and look how bad the lag is.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iz1\_DLm3mCk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iz1_DLm3mCk) skip to about 6 minutes
---
Didn’t anybody try to use macros during the demo? I mean something as simple as pet attack and mouse over macros.
---
/gquit
---
Rip COF, you were my best friend.
---
Life long pally here. I know what you mean. The light calls, and you answer. And People may argue who's the better healer, but I think that's dumb. It's a team effort! We wouldn't be able to keep tanks up if you weren't focused on LITERALLY everyone else ...including me sometimes. :D So swing that light brother! See you in MC!
---
Your friendly neighborhood Pally.
---
Fun fact, people were complaining heavily on pservers with people camping flightpaths and levelers.. These were just the people waiting for 5-15 min BG queues. There's even people that say these alliance rankers "killed the horde faction".
---
My computer wont crash when I try to enter Orgrimmar
---
Okay Michael Jackson. You're ignorant.
---
I think you're vastly over-estimating how much resources are going into Classic WoW.
---
Once the servers are up and live, and with the likelyhood there will never be content added post-Naxx, it's probably a skeleton crew of like, 3 dudes keeping an eye to make sure servers don't crash. The Classic team will just move onto the next project (Considering the lack of Warcraft 3 reforged news, that would likely be next, and then if Diablo 2 remastered ever comes.)
---
I must be sick, I've literally never done this? Hmm...Actually I always got to the hinterlands first on a boat? Desolace to Hinterlands? Was that a boat?
---
This is about how I approach it too. Just glad to have vanilla back. I am curious if it does well enough that Bliz considers more options later, but for the foreseeable future I just want to get into Classic, enjoy the experience, and see what kind of reception and then retention it gets from players as a whole.
---
Yeah seriously I hate this. This isn't no changes. This is a drastic change that will make someone who wants to min max pve forced to PVP to get the best weapons. It was like this on private servers and was easily my least favorite part, You are incentivized to rush to rank 14 first and ignore gearing the normal way basically.
---
Early on you have fuck all for bag space, and I'm not running to town to sell a few silver worth of crap. Until I go back for quest turn in, nobody is getting free leather off my kills.
---
&gt;will result in what it resulted in previously, everyone killing each other in Hillsbrad. A few other town raids might happen, maybe on major cities too to draw out more unique players to kill 
---
No. The original "phase 2" pvp only happened for 8 weeks, people did not have time to theorycraft the most efficient way of farming honor, and trust me, it was not hillsbrad. It's ganking flightpaths and other hotspots like diremaul.
---
they aren't people, they are dwarfs..
---
Nice, clever, funny 🤣🤣
---
Honestly...yeah...I know it's technically a change. But so long as it only affects the disparity of gray lvl players ability to kill ?? gankers, and not any other resistance mechanics. 
---
I think theres a thrill in being able to *maybe* fight back, say if only 80% of your spells resist, and not 98%. Rather than, well, guess I'm just deserting this fight and letting that person die.
---
Some of the most fun PVP experiences are on low level toons, playing a melee and 2v1ing a ??.
---
He said
---
Maybe just post a coment in the thread that was posted 18 minutes prior about this?  
---
If you've played on these servers then you're already aware there is literally a 0.00% population decline during this period of time then. If you disagree, you're fabricating arguments for the sake of saving face and I don't see the point.
---
Completely agree. First couple of phases should be 3-4 months with the later phases lasting at least up to 6 months.
---
I'd call it a restoration, not a copy. They have the *original* 1.12 data, and they are making it work with the modern engine. If they change the 1.12 data, what is the chance we will ever be able to play a version of wow with that original data again? I'd say none, they won't do Classic 2. So the way to preserve it is not to change it. It shouldn't become unavailable to play a second time, that would be such a shame.
---
Yes of course. I want to clarify I am not trying to bring in "melee hunter". I'm just curious how it compares.
---
These seem very reasonable, and I'll make note of them. I think we will be able to add them as-is or with some minor modifications.
---
Also what looks like a wooden stool to sit on, unless it’s a footrest
---
Appreciate the response! Thanks
---
Although Classic may be different, the Legion and BFA launches have been near flawless atleast for me. I had no issues playing immediately.
---

&gt; Why did you have a poster of a mass murdering racist homophobe on your wall?
---
Thank you idolo
---
Damn taking the relise date post spam to a whole new level
---
I'm not afraid to admit I've done that on multiple occasions. Deal needs to be made before the situation arises!

Actually it's more like [this.](https://gifimage.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/anakin-kills-younglings-gif-4.gif)

Aren’t they talking about a day as in a 24 period and not a calendar day.
---
Hey, when you run out of ammo mid dungeon you gotta do something :p
---
I was just as good as many rank 9+
---
i hear that. but also if your Top DPS and you say die quick or need to go on a different character or fill a certain roll you can tell big time. like i had a Rogue slam with me on DPS in boss fights and when he changed to his druid healer on a certain fight cause he needed gear and the other healer needed gear on his character i think it was like a warlock.. but his DPS wasnt up to par cause of his gear. and you would feel the dps struggling in the fights because we couldn't kill adds fast enough.
---
Well, only Blizzard knows what exists in their 1.12 data.
---
However anyone can check what exists in the 1.12 client (but not server) data. Although I'm not familiar with that so I can't tell if what's in there would enough or not.
---
But it seems Blizzard is really not keen on trying to recreate anything before 1.12, even if it might be technically possible (which we can't be sure of).
---
Peak cringe.
---
Probably take the easy way out
---
*revolutionary
---
What date is your guess?
---
Easier dungeons and LFG did way more damage than flying mounts ever did, that's my hot take.
---
Trivializing zones with flying is a big deal, but not close to the impact LFG and easier dungeons did. LFG just made you sit in cities, and easier dungeons meant less reliance on community along with the anonymity LFG provided knowing you're unlikely to see people again so you can be toxic with no punishment.

You realize private servers are free and global, right? Not sure you understand that concept. Paying, casual NA/EU players will 100% leave if they’re being relentlessly camped levels 50-60 by an unstoppable raid of turbonerds.
---
we had a soundbite the raid leader would play of someone yelling LOOT THE HOOOOUNDS!
---
&gt;Actually the first time I was just curious what that patch of land behind Arathi's mountains was 
---
Same, I actually went there way above the recommended level and absolutely fell in love w/ the zone, but, not a lot of content for Horde (but IIRC there is a really nice fishing pole you can get from a quest there) 
---
&gt;I wonder what Blizzard intended there.
---
I heard rumors of another battleground but have nothing to back that up (written, anyway).
---
Let us all know what server you'll be playing on, so we can avoid it.
---
We all play and like wow who cares what version, stfu with the retail vs classic shit.
---
Something none of us want to hear.. Fortnite did what we claimed would never happen again with World of Warcraft.
---
"There will never be a gaming cultural sensation like World of Warcraft ever again. It took the entire world by storm."
---
And then Fortnite did it but even bigger, and got fucking non-gamer celebrities raving about it, and of course the infamous Ninja-Drake stream.
---
I assume they're referring to [Skarm Tank](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5xSfo5nMGSmv00sGpRN7SQ/videos). Dude obviously knows game mechanics so they must have misinterpreted something he said.
---
STVIETNAM IS BAAACK!!
---
It didnt come down to theory crafting on my server, it was just a simple thought: "Well, there's a lot of pvp at Hillsbrad." Creating a feedback loop of there being more pvp there because people thought it was a good place to farm honor. 
---
And even the flight path camping will of course focus on spots with end game content, not STV. If I was going to camp any part of STV for Honor at *any* phase it would be the ZG entrance.
---
Not a lot for alliance either there's like 3 or 4 quests
---
What program is your masters thesis in? Also, two and a half months is an \*extremely\* short timeline to do data collection, analysis, and to write your manuscript. 
---
I also think your sampling method here seems somewhat suspect. 
---
You've also got a host of spelling and grammar errors in your post here, which normally wouldn't be a problem but in this case it reflects poorly on the academic rigor of your study. 
---
What model of religion will you be using?
---
I'm interested in being interviewed, possibly over skype, but I have some concerns about the methodology being employed here.
---
I am gonna have to side with the mods with this one.
---
After 10 years of pushing to get Blizzard to make Vanilla servers, people don't want the game to move in a negative direction that ruins it for them after just 2 years. So people are going to get pretty  vocal and toxic about it. I can admit I've been part of that. People disagree with BC servers because it will hemorrhage the Vanilla servers' populations, and people disagree with having 1.13+ because they prefer BC or they want Vanilla to be a time capsule. But many also dont just want nothing to happen at all. It's going to be a divisive issue, and do we really want to be divided over stuff like this when Classic isnt even out yet?
---
no DPS no loots &gt;:(
---
HAHAHAHAHA!!! I couldnt remember if there was a boat that connected the 2. This is immediately what I thought of if there were one
---
Great meme
---
&gt;Most guilds raid 3 days, which is pretty casual. Some still do 5 days a week, which I consider semi-hardcore.
---
If they're easily clearing the content why should they be raiding five days a week?
---
Pretty sure that can isn’t a beer? Wtf?
---
Looks like AMD chart
---
I've had that. Hunter in mara after the first boss says "What do I do if I run out of ammo?" I jokingly told him to melee....the bastard went melee for the rest of the run till Celebras. #justhuntardthings
---
 In Classic, I liked being a Tank 44-55, but compared to the guys I later joined up with, I was pretty raw, so I ended up going DPS instead. I was one of 2-3 Fury Warriors in the Guild and we had a blast.
---
PvE all the way here :)
---
Looks great.
---
RE: Low effort posts - I believe a dedicated day for memes allows the best of both worlds. It means 6/7 days a week people can come to the sub for discussion and resources, with another day for all the memes that people have come up with over the week.
---
High effort memes generally should get a pass. This is a little subjective but if you compare /r/highqualitygifs to /r/me_irl for example you can quickly get the gist.
---
Thanks for all the hard work so far!

Groups vs solos is so unfun

Im going to try to answer your questions in a single comment. :)

First of all, im using  Emilé Durkheims (1915) definition of religion. Durkheim believed that all religions, despite context contains five distinct elementary forms:
---
1. Division between sacred and profane objects exists.
---
2. Belief in the supernatural
---
3. Belief in divinity
---
4. The negative cult
---
5. Religions must contain rituals
---
A previous research done by Adam Perkins, "*Religious experiance in World of Warcraft*" (2011) has inspired me alot, and he also used these elements in his excellent work.   
---
\-----------------------------------------------------------------
---
When i still was thiking about research subjects, i came upon this article:  [https://killscreen.com/articles/world-warcraft-religion-one-anthropologist-thinks-so/](https://killscreen.com/articles/world-warcraft-religion-one-anthropologist-thinks-so/) , and it made me realize how interesting the area is:
---
*"In the end, the most important thing I want to say is what we are playing is not merely a game… In this world we find a feeling of existence we cannot find in the real world. This does not mean we are escaping, nor that we can only play games. People who say this are not real players… Do not think playing games is a waste of time, because the game made up for something we lost."*
---
After seeing that article, i started to google for previous researchs. Besides Adam Perkins thesis, i found 
---
* Stef Aupers, Julian Schaap, and Lars de Wildt: Qualitative In-Depth Interviews: Studying Religious Meaning-Making in MMOs

* Stef Aupers, Julian Schaap: ‘Gods in World of Warcraft exist’: Religious reflexivity and the quest for meaning in online computer games

HAHAHAHAHA!!! I couldnt remember if there was a boat that linked the 2. This definitely accurately describes this moment. Particularly in the 1st week of phase 2's release
---
Hot pockets and even hotter coffee.
---
This wasn't an issue of classic guild raiding time per se, but rather explaining that not even today are there "plenty of hc guilds".

Black lotus in vanilla had 6-16 spawn points in the 4 zones that they could spawn in. They had from what we know roughly 1 hour respawn time. These spawns were cluttered up which means you could make a black lotus mafia where only you know the respawn time, and have multiple characters spread out ready to pick the black lotus at the spawn time. This happened so much on pservers that they had to introduce new custom spawn points on two individual different servers so it's a widespread problem.
---
Here's an example.
---
Black lotus spawns in EPL BLIZZLIKE: https://i.imgur.com/WLxG3qL.jpg
---
Black lotus spawns in EPL on Kr0nos:

---
https://i.imgur.com/sQcEUPI.jpg
---
Sure private servers also increased the spawn rate. That is really besides the point. I think it's only fair that you randomly stomple upon a black lotus while herbing, than you having multiple lvl5 characters with find herb scouting for you (Yes people did that).
---
Was young
---
Yes and no. Yes because knowledge has increased, and testing has been done. No because many of these private servers implemented a dynamic spawn system that kicked into overdrive during launch week. I remember on one fresh I literally stood in one spot and grinded the same two mobs Bc they respawned as soon I was done with the other.
---
And no possibility to have characters of both faction in the same account which is sweet
---
Just doing my part to help stomp out misinformation.
---
I originally caught wind of this from some of my own guild members in Discord last night. My exact response was “whoa whoa whoa, can you repeat that entire statement?”
---
They were saying that you CANNOT be crit by and boss except for Nef and Chromag when you have 420 defense.
---
Thanks for your input on this. I think it’s probably not as wodespread as I originally though...but hey, the more correct info out there the better I suppose.
---
Run the orc to Mulgore, take the backdoor to Ratchet and pickup the FP's on the way. I've timed it and it's 15min flat to Bloodhoof Village, add 3min to Red Cloud Mesa. Then you'll get the shaman quests and he can train the warrior anywhere.
---
Get the Call of Fire at 10 and head to Crossroads(pick up all quests) - you'll start the quest chain outside of XR and he'll start the warrior quests in Razor Hill(pick up all quests) - you'll both have good use of each other in completing the questing in Durotar and Barrens.
---
This is fab. Bravo old chap.
---
If he doesn’t plan on raiding he can have more then one main. Takes a few days to a week to get your full prepaid bis. Sure there is rep you can grind or 100% quest but it’s not out of the question.
---
Name checks out.
---
I think the private server method is better, but I expect it to be completely authentic as it was. 
---
World first clears might not be from guilds that even use world buffs, if they just camp outside the raid and start when the servers up.
---
Hahahahaha!!!
---
Never experienced lag like that before, but I haven't seen a stack on stack for a very long time... Usually spread out a bit more
---
The big orc raid leader is even yelling 'FIND MANKRIK'S WIFE'
---
&gt; Should World Buffs be changed?
---
&gt; Do you think world buffs should stay the same as they were in vanilla?
---
Yes.
---
How about "Classic WoW as it has been announced by Blizzard". The game isn't even out yet, what's the point of jumping ahead past the bounds which have been announced? 
---
We have so much time for those discussions during the course of Classic.
---
No.  You simply tell the person who wins the head to save it for the night you'll be raiding after the new tier releases.  Silly change.
---
Is it that time of the hour already?
---
iirc they will have a cooldown on usage/turn ins to active world buffs on classic wow which private servers do not have
---
Turned with the keyboard or the mouse depending on circumstance.
---
I still only keybind 1-0
---
And that's why it will be different. People are going to go for the path of least resistance and there will be plenty of youtubers out there with "how to farm most honor per hour" tips and tricks videos that the community that are serious about wanting to rank will follow. 
---
It is sad we can't just have a community of people doing random things and that everything comes down to a science pretty much, but those are the times and blizzard should deal with the situation accordingly. They are the only ones who can force a playstyle on people.
---
Watching porn 1 frame at the time.
---
Agreed. I get the stance, but I feel that even making a stance completely misses the point of this subreddit.
---
&gt; Content must relate to Classic WoW. Discussion about TBC servers, WOTLK, or beyond do not conform to what this subreddit is tailored to right now. We’re all here to play, and focus on, Classic WoW - essentially, Vanilla WoW, reincarnated.
---
It reminds me almost word-for-word of the WoW subreddit saying the same thing about the masses of folks interested in discussing Classic WoW. 
---
It makes sense to merely mention it if it bacame to be a problem, but it seems more as if birds of a feather flock together. It should be obvious why people here want to dream about and discuss post-Classic --- it is those exact sorts of discussions which built this place we are in now.
---
I don't think i've ever done the Serpentbloom quest in WC as a healer or tank because of this...
---
&gt; Paying, casual NA/EU players will 100% leave if they’re being relentlessly camped levels 50-60 by an unstoppable raid of turbonerds.
---
Yeah man people are totally gonna throw away an account they invested $60.00+ dollars and 3+ days /played on because they have to avoid Searing Gorge. Totally. I mean, there's literally no precedent anywhere in existence for this being the case, but hey reddit knows best.
---
&gt; By 3 months there will be PLEEEEENTY of guilds in pre-raid BiS
---
Relatively speaking, no there won't be.
---
You know I was thinking of adding captions - that’s just what was needed
---
The worst is in quests where theres literally not enough drops in the dungeon for everyone to get their quest maxed out.
---
Were? Still am.
---
Hands are no longer as flexible as they used to be due to injuries I have from military. Doesn’t make me a bad player because I click. I’m not gunning for a raid spot in Method.
---
Do you still click spells/consumables/macros then..?
---
That's.. That's not it chief.
---
Is it a habit you feel you can't break or just something you aren't willing to break? WoW feels so much more efficient when you aren't clicking spells at all and just turn with your mouse as it's way faster than keyboard turning. (Especially if you're Melee or PvP)
---
&gt; top. They aren’t making a what if vanilla. They are making it as close as possible, minus a few changes, based on 1.12 data.
---
He's not trying to change anything. These items were not nearly as good as they are saying they are going to be first time around. These items were literally buffed to be on par with naxx rewards so you would still be incentivized to earn the PvP rewards. Asking them to please not introduce the 1.12 versions of these weapons until their power-level counterparts are also available is a totally legitimate and reasonable request. They honestly have a perfectly good worry now. Anyone looking to be competitive in PvE officially HAS TO PvP to stay competitive, and that's just not how vanilla actually was.
---
In what circumstance do you keyboard turn
---
Private servers used to have them but they decided that it was better for the game to allow people to worldbuff (and then remove world buffs on new raids to allow for natural progression), than to force players to sit and raidlog days in advance to scout for worldbuffs, because trust me people did scout for worldbuffs and they will again.
---
A rare good use of this meme, well-done sir.
---
I really have no idea what's wrong with you, mentally.
---
Just search ret pally on this reddit and you'll have your answer in 25143 different formats.
---
Nope, no boat in either of those zones :/
---
I recall vividly during the early days of WoW Molten Core the raid leader yelling on the mic "LOOT THE FUCKING CORE HOUNDS!"
---
Running around...mouse is for when im running with it or dungeons/raids.
---
Kids these days .... lol.  Makes me feel so old.
---
Its a Cooler! stronger than a beer.. but i ran out lmfao.. so i had to deal
---
I should point out there is an emphasis on the word *sufficient.*
---
Method is shit anyways
---
Same tower too?
---
REEEEE
---
Dungeons you can do just fine as a ret paladin yes. Hell you can probably even join a ZG or onyxia a couple of times.
---
When people talk about ret not being viable they mean for consistent 40man raiding.
---
And thats only 40 v 40 Classic battles can get up to hundreds of people fighting at the same time.
---
Oh I turn with my mouse in dungeons/raids...its a fools errand not to...
---
What? Does the pet borrow the sword and swing it?  Theyre just talking about standstill weapon attacks lol
---
It does make you inefficient though. I know people will tell stories "Yeah this guy in my guild was a clicker and he was one of our top DPS" but nowadays it's just like.. I can't imagine clicking. It's so inefficient.
---
If you have an MMO mouse, it's even easier. Your thumb barely moves at all because even if you were a clicker, your thumb rests on the side of the mouse anyways. There are cheap MMO mice too and I'd say it's well worth the investment to break clicking and it doesn't cause strain on your hand since your thumb naturally rests there even if you were a clicker
---
pve is th way to go. The real vanilla experience. Pvp is usually reserved for either elitist or masochists. Best part about pve is that you can choose what type of day you want. Productive and story driven. Or on your toes and jumpy. If you have a bad day nothing beats just hoping on and getting done what you wanted without disruption
---
Good point on the account sharing thingy. I was also defending the private server settings but a guy analyzed some videos of the current gen pservers and compared it to joanas video. The first bunch od levels seemed very much the same bur the further it went in, the more often quest and mob xp was off by around 5-15%. The record can surely be improved by alot, but the slightest unexpected change between classic and pservers can fuck their whole pre-practiced route. I will be amazed if they can pull off runs near the 3days marker like some did on a pserver :p
---
Yep, especially because talk of "post-Classic" will also cause them to consider the folks who want "more Classic" and think about all plans for that - new realms, new content, whatever they want to do. Even if they do TBC they will likely keep up the Classic too since they now have proof that if people had the optiont o decide between Vanilla and TBC - some people will pick different options, and some would just quit if you made them go to TBC. So it makes sense for them now with their faltering subscription numbers to pen everyone into Classic/TBC/Wrath whatever they want since otherwise they weren't playing on a Blizzard Sub.
---
I'm aware of the numerous different advantages that those Private servers offered. However since everyone will be on the same playing field as Joana record is vanilla but with more knowledge and refine leveling tactics. That along should be enough for numerous players to beat that record.
---
Unless Joana had some advantage that we won't in Classic, it's just hard to believe that others with just as much time and dedication can't do it marginally faster.
---
Put placeholders, teleporter pods, whatever outside of the various flying areas.
---
Or remove epic flyers so that even with flying it's faster to ride your epic ground mount so people lean towards that.
---
Or if you're really ambitious, alter the map so that there's a ground route up to Skettis plateau, ogri'la, etc.
---
There's lot of options
---
I scrolled down to find this post. After reading all the comments I'm still nowhere near deciding
---
Error 37 intensifies
---
Yes, it does make you a bad player. As an example, if you have to click Blizzard on your bar and then point it on the ground, the rogue is long gone. That would be considered a ***BAD*** play.
---
?????
---
*EVERY WARRIOR RUSHES TO BRD ARENA FOR EPIC 1.12 CHEST*
---
Me too.
---
I started vanilla super late in its lifecycle (patch 1.9 IIRC) so I rolled pve due to a mixture of it being my first MMO experience and knowing it was tougher to level on pvp especially coming in when most people were already 60.
---
I wouldn’t judge anyone for rolling pve since I understand, and just different strokes for different folks. But I’m very excited to go pvp on a fresh server!  But it’s because I want those world encounters I missed the first time around.
---
If we did not have the discussion would classic still have been released?  If we had censored the discussion to remove topics about classic and how it would be pulling player base from retail?
---
So were will be a place to talk about how classic will evolve or even stagnate/frozen?  Fact is, you are advocating for removing people from the discussion that you disagree with.  I want vanilla, and then I want vanilla to evolve. Am I and others like me not wanted/allowed to be here?
---
I do think that it would be a positive thing to keep several mega-threads regarding common-re-post topics like this from plugging up /new.  I think the moderating the toxic individuals is always better than limiting freedom to provide a safe space for the #nochanges crowd so that they don't triggered by anything post 1.12.
---
Rogues very heavily overplayed back in retail because they were overpowered for most of the "expansion". However in 1.12 they are pretty balanced, and as long as you are a decent player you should be fine.
---
Yeah i'm curious about what makes you keyboard situationally.. It's so much easier and faster since you can whip around the camera with the mouse
---
The first meme I ever got from WoW was "LOOT THE DOGS"
---
Serpentbloom I'm looking at you...
---
You would avoid an entire server because one guy won't loot his mob for you.
---
Stronger is better, do not apologise. 😅
---
I was a clicker  + wasdqe when i first started. Was that for a long time. After I started to watch pvp videos with action bar i saw i could also do things with keybinds.
---
Oh I’m so sorry my inability to physically be able to use keybinds hampers your enjoyment of a game so much.
---
14 AP gives you 1 dps.
---
Yup, all true points. Obviously i still made it work in the end. However that's exactly what I was referring to with RNG of the dark moon buff. You can only try once per hour so depending on your available playtime prior to raids you have to prepare for days to get a chance at getting lucky enough to get a good one in order to compete and then you can lose it through no fault of your own, like a hunter wiping the raid.
---
I prefer the style that certain other servers use upon naxx launch where worldbuffs are wiped upon entry. You can still tryhard and have  to far a ton of gold for your other consumable buffs and even the above and beyond ones like tuber roots and juju flurry and time then properly and all that stuff. It just removes the RNG element from the competitive aspect while still keeping the tryhard elements IMO
---
I use the keyboard out in the world. I use the mouse in dungeons/raids.
---
I didnt raud until raid finder... which means i never did a single raid until cata.
---
There was ALWAYS something to do, even if not raiding 
---
Pvp, dungeons, professions, reputations, alts, etc.
---
*runs up from far away after drinking*
---
AHH STOP IT JUST STAY AWAY ...NOOOO^o^o^o^o
---
Stop projecting.
---
I know it doesnt seem like it based on the people who come to the subreddit but you'll be in the majority.  There will be many, many, guilds filled with people like you.
---
Except Dreamfoil and Silversage is also farmeable in AV, and the prices are 10x that of Icecap.
---
Yea #1 is meaningless
---
I leave the group, the other guy finds himself a new tank and learns his place. That's the deal.
---
Business model? Just have to resub to retail or will it be separate?
---
Wow was developed FOR casual people. It's a fact. Look up any article from 2005-06.
---
The hardcore mentality is there but by no means should you ever think that it's a vital part of the game.
---
Raid leader: omg you guys loot the damn hounds so we can move on!
---
Also raid leader: QUIT FUCKING LOOTING IN COMBAT!!!1!
---
Every MC raid ever.
---
There was some decent talks about it half a year ago but lately it's been more low effort, almost felt like a brigading.
---
Most servers nowadays remove worldbuffs for the first month of progression on new raids. I like that idea very much because it's good for progression and it's fun to raid new stuff without worldbuffs.
---
To be honest a server only needs a few hundred characters:
---
Me   
---
My 10 primary bank alts.   
---
Some friends.  
---
250 peasants to do the hunting and gathering for me...  
---
And 250 enemy peasants to do the hunting and gathering for me that my side's peasants can't do.
---
How am I projecting? I’m going to take my time leveling. No reason for me to rush to 60.
---
Phase 2 is where you make some real enemies.  Damn do I miss in game enemies that I love to hate.
---
Yeah no. Once again if I’m not gunning for some world 1st raid guild at what point does clicking an ability to kill a raid boss have any indication of my ability to play the game? That .002 response time? 
---
If you worry more about that DPS bar being above the rest of your guild than you do about playing the game, killing bosses and having a good time WITH your guild then Classic isn’t a version of WoW I’d say play. That’s more Retail.
---
TBC dungeon finder was perfect and would be a net improvement in vanilla as well. All it was was a high information density billboard to advertise your interest in groups and search for other players. A huge upgrade from the LFG channel that was a spam fest you had to constantly keep an eye on. TBC dungeon finder still left all the work of forming the group to the player, it just helps you find interested players before you start spamming every random person on the server.
---
LFD from WotLK was shit.
---
Since I used to play most of vanilla on a laptop at my friend's house, I almost always keyboard-turned, since using the touchpad wasn't optimal to turn the camera :D... but I had all abilities keybound, still have the same keybinds for the abilities today - guess muscle memory really helps and gives me more focus for everything else around me. Since TBC I never keyboard-turned again. Changing the keybinds to strafing is the first thing I do on a fresh client.
---
Now that's exaggeration at its peak, lol
---
Really sounds like you are over thinking it - the game has plenty of quality moments while leveling. If you do it slowly or fast, i am sure you will find it fun. 
---
Just go with what you want - guilds are usually pretty warm welcoming even if you come back after a month.
---
omg scuffed
---
Rural parts of the country at least in US was still using dial up for a while into the 2000s. I was lucky and Cablevision rolled out high speed internet in 1996 in NY/CT. I think less than 5% of the country had high speed at that time.
---
Gotta melt your eyes from all angles. Approved :)
---
Fake leak as per usual.
---
Wailing Caverns immedieately comes to mind...
---
Having already gotten everything from there along with the thought of having to spend another 2 hours there just so someone else can finish their quests....
---
Dude most classes can farm way more gold at 60 than ur level 41 male night elf hunter killing basilisks in desolate. You can legit just kill plaguebats and make decent money. You can farm elemental fires first before most people. You can control the marketplace more and manipulate prices. Skinning will be done 100% by hardcore players Bc of devilsaurs and that’s mostly the only reason why. The other will go to engineering at 60 when they use profits from devilsaurs to easily afk skillup engineering when they wanna wax the weasel or smoke a fatty. 
---
Then you can level up any gathering professions later with ur epic mount breezing through zones picking herbs faster than anyone else,etc.
---
 ur basically saying take 10 days to level to 60 instead of 7 so u can do whatever weird logic u came up with. Meanwhile an extra 48 hours of legit 60 gold farming would put that player miles ahead of your level 44 who probably would take an entire 8 hours to make 100g.

You also do know that quests give more gold at higher levels so the faster you get to those quests the more gold you’re yielding while also killing higher level mobs which drop better trash and cloth.
---
Rogues are basically second best raid DPS throughout all of Vanilla, there will always be plenty of rogues. 8 Classes available to each faction. That's enough for 5 of every class. But you will probably have fewer Warlocks/Hunters than other DPS. And maybe 12 Healers between 3 available healing classes, so average of 4 each. In reality, 2-3 Druids, and depending on Faction could be a lot of Shamans. Probably 6-7 rogues on average. If your guild is looking to the future, they will probably want 8 warriors. Highest DPS class in most cases in Vanilla, less so in Naxx specifically. But you need 8 tanks for Naxx as well.
---
If that is how it is going to be played, then we have what 6 blue posts we can discuss and all content not regarding them should be removed right?  Hope all the concerns of the community have been taken into account already.
---
Got the stream on the left, Game in the middle, Spotify/Discord Splitting the monitor on the right. DONT NEED NOTHING ELSE... Thanks for the Approval sir
---
i'll tell you a story.
---
i rolled a horde character on the dentarg server, not long after it launched.  one day,  a high level paladin decided to attack (solo) the crossroads.   i dont know his exact level, he was 'skull' and almost every attack missed.
---
there were tons of us, easily 25+ low level hordies. but no one ran away. we kept the pressure on until he was dead, even though it took probably took 10 minutes.  in the end, we were proud. some  might mock us because it took so long and so many to kill him, but i disagree. we defended our lands against the enemy.
---
this is the essence of old WoW pvp.
---
Casuals. I did click some totems, though. Way too many to bind up properly, especially with no keypad/extra mouse buttons to use.
---
I was in college by then so we didn't have to worry unless the campus internet went out.
---
So, you're creating a post with "obvious" speculations, claiming to have insider knowledge? Okay...
---
Nobody really expects the timeline to be the same as back in the days, as the original timeline depended on the time it took them to "finish" content. My guess is that they'll not even state a fixed timeline, but will wait how things progress in a live environment.
---
So you are already used to grinding long shifts
---
Valid, but what I'm getting at is that the meme won't hold up like some people might actually think. STV was not a honor farming spot, it was a zone for griefers, and a few high levels passing through to ZG, fishing competition, or the arena competition. It will be more of a war zone before there are incentives to min-max.
---
"Well, this is going to take longer and be less fun"
---
I personally think it’s ridiculous the amount of downvotes people get for supporting changes in the sub. But I don’t expect that to ever change here.
---
Gnome Female Mage &lt;3
---
Revered is highest you need for recipies. The only thing that was exalted was the Trinket that summons a Furbolg.
---
It's not about the honor. It's about pissing off the enemy.
---
Oh ive always used the keyboard to turn, and cast spells
---
It sounds like you already have a story you want to tell before collecting data. That is the wrong order of operations. Find a rich data source and let it reveal to you the story that should be told about it.
---
This sub is scaring me just a tad... As a dad who only has like a couple hours to game every other day. Should I play PVE so I can actually level?
---
It’s just like censoring anyone that goes out and says hey the honor system should change a year or two after Naxx. It’s a highly controversial oppinion but I think it’s something that should happen personally.
---
Whoa we have the same wallpaper and I literally just got that book yesterday.
---
In my experience, the other miner will steal that one or first two veins, then the tank will say "hey Im also a miner" and from that point they'll decide to roll or each take every other vein.
---
Statistically, the non-tank wins unless the deal is made beforehand!
---
Sounds like you don't have a unique research question then.
---
Older itemization also incentivizes different actions. The best warrior chest for pre bis is completely different in 1.12 than earlier patches for instance.
---
What is that strange brown colour you have there ?
---
Its .91 aps I think baseline according to shedo
---
How is that an exaggeration?  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYFD06UFscw&amp;t=4s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYFD06UFscw&amp;t=4s) 
---
Yeah Nost usually had like 8-10k people on at a time, but if you think there wont be larger battles then 40 v 40 you clearly never wpvpd in classic
---
I don't think it will be all that hard to get a group for SFK. Even on a fresh server. So many people are going to want to explore and really get into the game, I'm sure you could probably find a group that's willing to do VC and SFK.
---
dial-up was on the way out during the early days of WoW, but it wasnt uncommon.
---
It seem like you're the one who has a serious mental handicap if you cant understand that there are only 3 worthwhile 1h axes in the game vs a whole bunch of swords.
---
Also, not every horde warrior will be an orc anyway.
---
But if all you can do is make baseless claims and throw insults, then there really is no point to continue this argument.
---
The case yeah.  All the guts were replaced in it though.    That's the second PC my GF uses
---
PvP issue during TBC could be solved with :

But it's a #Change !
---
Northren Boogaloo
---
Am I in a Barrens chat private server right now?
---
Nost has inflated quest values I thought, which makes a huge difference. 
---
Dale of north has vastly easier drop rates on some quests. There was an absolute insane level of dynamic respawns for the first couple weeks of launch.
---
I am sure the record will be beaten, but you can not compare private servers to the record to a t when there’s crucial variables that can make it much easier to shave time.
---
iPhone 7?
---
/follow, the one meme spec to rule them all
---
I want no changes

Except this thing I want changed

Every single time ...

It is on retail
---
Thought lotus' were bop in vanilla
---
LOOT THE HOUNDS!
---
I fall into this bucket as well.  This is a good explanation.
---
Maybe, and this is just me throwing out ideas here, but MAAAAYBE... some people like to... uh... roleplay?
---
And, even crazier, maybe some people like to roleplay, and... get this... ALSO do WPvP...
---
Boot that fool
---
I absolutely agree that the record will fall due to all those factors but I just think that is unfair to mention PServers records in this context.
---
These were only rare because they were taken out by surprise.
---
They won't be rare the second time.
---
Name checks out
---
Minion mobs give too much xp imo. The imps in particular. I don’t really remember that but it’s been so long. Just felt cheese with rested xp I could kill a cloth humanoid for like 600xp in seconds.
---
Yus
---
I was only 12 so :(
---
Sure there was, you just had to use download managers like GetRight
---
Do you really think that's the reason people are downvoting you? Or is it because that's just an example of how you go out of your way to be a jerk to other people for no reason?
---
Okay but when will they give it then?
---
Can't speak from experience as a healer, but as a DPS (mage), Discreet Spellthread helps a lot when you're dealing with bad tanks. XD
---
There will be a percentage  that are top tier end game raiders.  You know, the type that min/max everything, BiS everything, hours of gathering and professions for raid buffs, and specific talents/rotations for raids.   These guilds will be a minority and are really for the hardcore gamers.
---
Most guilds, will struggle through content, scrape together enough people to run on weekends, but spend most of the time laughing and enjoying the game that way.  Back in vanilla, this was my guild.  You grabbed whoever wasn't locked to fill empty slots, regardless of class and gear, as long as they were attuned.   We saw content, we facerolled and wiped.  It was some of the best times I've ever had in a game.
---
Don't sweat the endgame, enjoy the journey and play whats fun for you.  There will be a guild happy to have you and you'll see end game if you want to.
---
no, hpriest have great use for all their tier sets
---
&gt; Simply put. Was it in vanilla? Then it makes the cut. Were these mounts apart of vanilla? Yes. Have them be at the appropiate phase and replaced with the appropiate reskins when that phase ends. 
---
BUT I AM ANGRY ABOUT ANOTHER USERS RESPONSE AND I NEED TO TELL THEM THEY ARE WRONG!!!!??!?!
---
Apparently in 2004 55% of people were on broadband, but that number didn’t hit 90% until 2008. Damn I guess I was spoiled and didn’t even know it.
---
Hey, put your nose down, your shit stinks too
---
You are talking exceptions, not rules. You do not walk into that without expecting some lag, get real man lol. I can't think of a single game that handles combat of that scale without hiccups
---
As I said earlier it will be on the current engine, it will handle "better" but not perfectly, anything better is a pipe dream
---
Fair to say I suppose but they have definitely played some role in refining that vanilla progression(outside of bonus xp &amp; spawning of course).
---
yea ull enjoy it, especially leveling. Take ur time to find hidden quest, read them quest, ull be 60 eventually
---
Will they include the real "Reset Instances" option that we got later, or will we have to do the jankety break party, make someone else invite the party, hope it has been long enough to reset dance?
---
So you're saying the non profit rag tag team of private server friends is an exception and can achieve better performance than Blizzard?
---
bupupup bupupup bupupupuwwwwuuuuuuummm
---
That doesn't happen anymore because cell phones use different frequencies, and lower signal amplitude (due to more sensitive electronics)
---
I have no problem with the time off the bad part would be the wife agro. It is funny because back in the day some guild members used that term, and as a single person I was lmao, now karma will strike back.
---
I disagree: the system doesn't allow you to be a colossal douchebag, it rewards you for it. For exemple killing lvl48-58 at flight master isn't interesting PvP and it's very likely that it will be the best way to farm honor during phase 2.
---
When you add this to the fact it will push people to level faster and the most annoying douchebag won't even have to go through it, then it's a bad system.
---
best comment here 🤷‍♂️
---
pservers will not be accurate for times because they implement dynamic respawns of mobs so that mobs will pretty much always be available, while in classic there won't be and mobs will respawn a hell of a lot slower. 
---
as far as largely solo play is concerned, and with minimal downtime, casual players will probably take 10-14 days /played, player's following joana's guide for the first time on a slower leveler will likely be around 8-9 days, experienced players on good levelers will probably be around 6-7 days, and the speedrunners on hunters will be around 4-4.5 days.
---
speedrunning leveling 5-man groups will probably break into the sub-4 day time because they will be able to efficiently integrate dungeons and the dungeon quests into their route, as well as aoe down large packs of mobs for quick quest completion.
---
Tank main here, we can angrily shake our fists together.
---
People say time off but that lasts what, a week? A lot of the elitists are either well off or living on welfare.
---
I haven't played wow since Lich King and I still get lost in thought and swoon over my Ivory Raptor.
---
Well I did try to play again a couple exp ago while trying to flex on my Ivory Awesomeness only to find out that Blizzard release a cheap knock-off version(Bone-White Primal Raptor i think?). No one around even realized what I was riding on, and maybe it shouldn't matter, but it no longer felt special after that.
---
I didn't know that!
---
The alliance has a really nice base there, I know that much (stealthed around the place when I was 60) whereas the horde has that little rinky dink town w/ a few huts and no walls....
---
The real question is how long is everyone taking off?
---
DRCHRISTIE NEVER FORGET
---
This hits home for me.
---
Priests bang bang in pvp real nice. Shammy isnt bad either, but lack cc and cant really perform in 1vs2 situations, in which priests shine.
---
That's what the word always meant outside of video games (slang wise).
---
You dumb
---
World buffs are already being changed from private servers hopefully. In actual vanilla there was a several hour Cooldown on head turn-ins so there was no guarantee that you would be able to turn in your head right before the scheduled raid. Heart of hakkar had a Cooldown to turn in as well. Private servers didn't have these, so raid buffs were far easier to get.
---
So even though world buffs will be slightly less of an issue assuming they reproduce the classic behavior, I'd still love to see them ripped out for raids.
---
Every Mc raid.
---
server?  I always play on PVP servers.  If you're talking about using totems in dungeons, I don't do much dungeon while leveling.  For pvp encounters while leveling, earthbind/frost shock/fire totems are good enough...but I focus more on leveling than PVP.  I like to PVP at 60 myself.
---
Healer is the easiest role to collect the Serpentbloom on. Usually the tank and DPS will just charge a mob pack and tunnel a bit harder whereas as a healer you have more freedom to basically look around in the middle of a mob fight and you can move on top of a Serpentbloom node as soon as the rest of the party pulls a mob pack, often times even collect it in the middle of a fight.
---
I've never seen a DPS just leave in the middle of a fight to collect a Serpentbloom, they always rush for it after the mob pack is dead if they notice one close to the group.
---
As a healer I basically get to pick them all first unless it's a vein which is not near a mob pack in which case the person who is in front of everyone else usually gets to pick it.
---
I got WoW because I played WC3. I walked into a Gamestop and just saw it and had no idea it existed. I bought it but couldn't run it in my mom's computer (thing hardly ran starcraft).  I read this book over and over dreaming of what class I wanted to play.
---
Some of us can actually see that the timeline + 1.12 balance is a massive fucking change, the #nochanges movement is a joke, and it's worth talking bout additional changes to compensate for the impact that changes to the timeline in Classic will have from original vanilla.
---
if u need 5 days a week to clear mc, bwl or any raid for that matters, ur guild is bad
---
He was just in shadowmeld making sure it was safe to attack.
---
Only losers care about fake internet points.
---
Disc priests are very strong in group PVP, but so are resto shamans. You’ll have a place regardless of which one you play. A pertinent question is whether you want to respec for some of the differences in PvE builds. 
---
Theres also the issue of whether you want to dabble in the other specs as shadow priest is very strong PvP wise but not sought after for PVE. Whereas elemental/enhancement shaman are not as strong in either category, but everyone loves resto shamans for PVE. 
---
So you’ve got choices!
---
I mean what time of day PST
---
I absolutely love warrior leveling post level 30. With a good weapon you become a train of death
---
what an absolute 9gag tier meme, christ
---
Do you need 5 days to clean a raid? As a HC guild you needed to raid 5 days? Kek
---
Yes you will. There’s plenty to it then just hardcore raiding or grinding pvp for hours. 
---
Many of us are older now with jobs, wife’s and kids so limited time is a factor for most this time around compared to when we were teens and could play 8-12 hrs a day. 
---
And as a whole this game was designed to be for the more casual player to start with. 
---
Enjoy the time it takes to 60 and once there there’s plenty to do - make gold, run dungeons, grind rep, sort out your professions - go fishing 🎣. 
---
Get into a guild that run raid times that suits you - most will be able to clear MC/BWL even with just 1-2 raid nights a week so the gear will eventually come your way somehow while you enjoy a few hours of fun with friends.
---
The way things are looking now I feel like it's required to farm PVP gear for preraid BIS and I will actually need the gear just to level safely. I'm really hoping I get to 60 prior to phase 2. 
---
My plans to not speed level are now changing. I will level an alt later at a leisurely pace once BGs start. I'm having concerns about leveling a Warlock on a PVP server because we are so dependent on gear for damage. 
---
I am also carefully planning talent point progression to get an improved voidwalker as soon as possible for the damage bubble with improved healthstones, instant cast corruption, and improved curse of agony. 
---
I was always a PVE player on a PVE server. I am researching leveling strats now to deal with world PVP. I'm also wondering if Engineering is now better than Tailoring 300 for the bloodvine set bonus.
---
I need to learn how to PVP and am currently researching Drakedog PVP videos. If anyone knows how to level a Warlock on a PVP server and has some tips please let me know.
---
What an asinine comment. Some flask because they want to, not because they need to or are forced to. 
---
You would have to be really stupid to believe otherwise,
---
Meant server. Water totem helps a lot for general grinding/dungeons, and air is a must for PVP. If you are on a PVP server close to launch you are going to pvp at lower levels.
---
It was quite common in rural areas even through the late 00's.  The only alternatives were satellite (expensive, bandwidth limits, ~2s latency) or in some places a 'wireless' type, which was also quite expensive (i think a friend of mine might still be on that).  Around here they'd put the transmitters on top of water towers to reach people that live well out of town/away from the county roads.
---
It costs a phone company a lot of money to upgrade their lines to provide DSL, and it flat out wasnt worth it to run a mile of new wires for the 3-4 farmers that lived on that stretch of road.
---
Hell, even where i live (in a village, but a very small one) im not sure you could get 3meg when wow came out.  I was stuck on 128k for a very, very long time.  I think you could get at least 256/512, but it was really expensive at the time.
---
Yes but actually no
---
Why wouldn’t you want to start phase 5? You can skip dying to garbage MC bosses and the hell on earth that will be phase 2! 
---
They better not open any new ones until well after Naxx.
---
The priest robe is absolutetly amazing and you should definately get tailoring for it but you can just drop tailoring after you craft it and get something else unlike bloodvine. Tailoring itself is pretty cheap and easy to level too.
---
This is THE BEST one !
---
You guys are killing it !
---
both are good and viable, you can play whatever is more in your style.  just stylistically in which skin you fill better. 
---
priest is better and has more variety for just healing. shaman is more hybridy and utility with all the totems, interupts, slows etc.
---
you can say priests are a hybrid too, cos you can go shadow in pvp at least. as shaman can go elem, so ya.
---
new servers should start on the same patch as the others, just like vanilla. if you believe in no changes then this is the only way.
---
opening new servers and having them start fresh just wouldn't work. not only would they have to separate them in the realm list, which has never been done, but it would also spread the community thin. people on PS flood fresh servers FAR before the one they are on even reaches the end. It would just ruin the population.
---
They won't do fresh servers until after classic has finished phase 6 if they know what they're doing.
---
I'm sure they'll do like EQ does and just put out a new server or 2 every so often. Once they iron out all the kinks with the mail Classic launch, it should be pretty easy to throw a few new servers up if they wanted to.

Alliance Human Warrior lvl 60 ... dressed in rags...
---
True dat !
---
Yeah it's great if you have a full party of friends happy to travel the world so you can get a whirlwind weapon...if.
---
Would you be able to explain your reason's why - stating just a No isn't an argument against RP.
---
Heck i've weighed up the arguments myself and honestly it makes more sense - otherwise blizzard should roll a dice for each user that gets an unarmoured mount and if you roll bad you should lose it for an armoured one to be truly blizz like.
---
Why stop at phase 5?
---
Lets just go straight to phase 127, that should put us right around BFA
---
What game you playing?.... Looks like trash...
---
Its one sub for both, if you are already retail subbed you get access to classic
---
PVP servers solved keyboard turning real quick for a lot of people.

Back then obviously.

**&lt;Senile Chieftains&gt; | EU PvP Server, Horde | Casual PvE raiding guild**
---
**Introduction:** 
---
"Senile Chieftains" is made for people who would like to see all the classic raid content (again), but are not able or willing to spend 8 nights a week playing. Of our 4 raids that we will run every week, we only expect you to attend 1. There are options available for people who would like to raid multiple days / multiple chars.
---
Senile Chieftains is made by ex raiders who have grown to old to raid to many evenings a week. Back in vanilla we cleared aq40 until the 'twin emperors', but because of the "tbc" release the guild disbanded. 
---
One of our officers has all the tbc server first under his belt up to kil'jaeden. So you can expect a mature and experienced raid environment
---
**Expectations from members:**
---
We are looking for experienced and skilled players to realize our goal of clearing all classics raid content. New players are also welcome, but keep in mind that most of our players are now 30 years and older so we will have a more mature guild environment. 
---
**Raid Information:**
---
Raiding days will be Mon-Thur 20:00 - 23:00 (server time). Once available, we will run organized raids on off days for lower tier content for alts and those who want to complete their tier/bis sets. Loot will be distributed by a loot council aided by a hidden dkp system.
---
Send me a message or contact Wolfie#2101 on discord for more information!
---
I was in a ubrs group where a skinner got the pristine hide of the beast and another skinner wanted to roll on it.
---
So much drama!
---
Well, even if it uses a server that is exactly the same, the spellbatching for classic should help with performance.
---
Is Discreet Spellthread even a Classic item?
---
&gt;## The Final Pre-Launch Census:
---
&gt;We previously held two large census/surveys: #1, over a year ago and #2, a few months ago
---
&gt;They were well-received and provided quite a lot of data to the community (and possibly Blizzard?)
---
So in relation to that, if in case they do read here (which most probably they do ?)
---
Couldn't we extend it and create surveys for future content for blizzard to get a feeling of what we want after the last phase, or even before we reach the final phase to have surveys for what we want in the phases as well ? even if they don't read it, it will be a nice addition to the subreddit to see what people can come up with :D
---
Or maybe they'll create their own surveys who knows. Just imagine the surveys they can create by adding a quick mockup to it, giving us a feeling of what we will get for each of the selections we have to choose from ! but im just day dreaming :P
---
Aight well,  14/0.91 = 15.38 AP to get 1 white damage.
---
it's more of a vr experience
---
This data needs revealed asap. I want spreadsheets, charts, graphs, 10:01 min long videos with catchy names and lots of !!!!! On my desk stat
---
This post made me face-palm; down-voted.
---
These people have already done this 4 times. They have this down to a science for every patch on what to do. They are extremely prepared and ready. They also will be motivated even more because now this is official and a lot of them have no life so they will try to capitalize in anyway on there nolifeness via streaming or potential competitive play if classic is huge.
---
You're dancing around my point because your emotional uncertainties make it too hard for you to confront. Your attitude is why you have no friends. Work on that, things will get better.
---
I'm not persuading you to level differently, I am just curious as to what you mean by "there isn't really \[end game content\] in 1.12". I feel like there's loads personally, with rep, professions, dungeons, and ofc raids (which comes with attunements).
---
Your best hope is making friends.
---
True, STV will be a warzone even more before honor system. With phase 2 and the honor system, the warzone moves to 48+ zones.
---
Definitely. Remember the name and don’t bring him to the next run.
---
I think you die at 3
---
Drunken RBGS haha
---
None, avoid sugar as it only gives short burst of energy and makes you feel bad after.
---
Go for caffeine pills and water, you want to live as healthy as possible while gaming nonstop as you can, because a healthy body can game for even longer.
---
Considering the client is 7.x I’d expect that and *many* other non trivial non apparent changes to be made.
---
So what level would 3 Red Bulls get me too?
---
Hi! Excuse my grammatical errors, I'm from Sweden.. In sweden we call this essay "magisteruppsats", which is a level below master here. But the international equivalent seems to be "masters thesis". I'm not sure.
---
\- The program is Religious studies.
---
\- My essay will be written in Swedish. 
---
\- I presented the model shortly, it's defined by Emilé Durkheim. 
---
We should maybe DM each other?
---
the second you change something, it is no longer #nochanges. it doesn't matter if you didn't like something, if it was in that expansion then it should be there again in classic:TBC and classic:WotLK
---
I actually like TBC's class balance way better. Hybrids are actually raid-viable and get a lot of their big issues fixed, while still having weaknesses. Like prot paladin now has a taunt and gets mana back when healed, but still has less threat/defenses than a warrior.
---
I like Vanilla's content more, though.
---
Just roll 29/11/11 druid and murder every damn one of this kids
---
45?
---
You can't have different servers at different patches it doesn't work, and it's never been done by blizzard before.
---
The real question. When do we get Classic BFA?
---
Hmm interesting
---
Of course the record will be beat. It’s just people are throwing private server playtimes out as the standard when in reality there is no standard other than the joana time because that’s the only one with official drop rates official quest values official experience official hp and armor values official skills official everything.
---
I suggest you don't. These coming months are going to be special just like back then when WoW first released. Sure its also gonna be sorta torture but revel in the excitement, the anticipation, the experience of coming back to what we all loved :)
---
Right? I used to think that all the time. About to die and leap to "safety" in the water below, lol
---
You will enjoy the game, the "hardcore" playerbase seems exaggerated if you're browsing this subreddit. They are the 1%, everyone else has now grown up and has careers and families and will all be the knowledgeable yet timewise filthy casual just like you
---
It is not.
---
Assuming you could somewhat compete with the world record pace, you're looking at roughly 100 hours of playtime to 60.
---
If you played 12 hours per day, you could get there in 8 or 9 days.
---
Given that you probably shouldn't have more than 5 250mL Red Bulls per day, then 50 total would be more than enough if you plan on hardcore no-lifing it.
---
It's going to need to be more than a mini fridge.
---
Are you only drinking one red bull every 10-12 hours?
---
Good answers!
---
Yeah lets do it.
---
As a teacher, all of summer.
---
Sir, your response has been flagged for r/wallstreetbets
---
Ok Charlie
---
It's best in slot for I think until several pieces of t2. So yes I'd say for a semi-hardcore guild it should be mandatory as it's an item that everyone can get as long as you put some effort into it.
---
Remember that you do not need to KEEP tailoring. You just need to level tailoring once, get the chest, then you can do whatever you want.

there are items that can be used to dismount people. there was one in vanilla, probably one in tbc, not sure about wrath, there was one in mop, wod, legion, and BFA. it would literally be that easy.
---
4-5 people including myself rolling 100 on Band of Accuria off Rag, then tying the next reroll with one other person and then losing in the third round. Then screaming in agony.
---
If the game wasn't made for casuals, it wouldn't have been so successful.

Bubble hearth ask for a summon

---
True, but I LOVE wpvp
---
I imagine it would depend a lot on population demand as progression comes to a close.  A couple of scenarios though..
---
If there isn't monetary value in tbc or post naxx progression, then a fresh server will likely be created.
---
If there is monetary value is there...
---
and the population is split on how progression should work, they will likely go with what they think will bring in new subs.
---
and the popluation heavily leans one direction, then they will probably go that direction. 
---
Regardless of which of these occurs, I imagine the end-of-progression realms will likely be merged or ended after some time as people from these servers move to playing the next fresh/tbc/post naxx.
---
But again, I don't imagine they give any clues until they know what the population wants when it gets there.  Then they'll factor in what works best for bringing in the mula.
---
We could rebalance the entire game using this magic spell qualifier you call "necessary". ;P
---
Too many.
---
I know what you mean! I have been thinking about it, but I don't know. The study uses qualitative methodology which yields unique answers. Maybe I find out new things? And, I havent found any previous research that combines image analysis with semi structured interviews.

I want to advise caution with caffeine pills as caffeine toxicity/overdose is a real thing that can ruin your week: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine#Overdose
---
I used to deal with security at a University's library, and had to deal with this more than a few times each semester. IMO, just stick to a couple cups of black coffee so you can keep the calories down and stay stimulated. I love your point that healthy bodies can game for longer.
---
Right click report? Still don’t know what they plan to do about that. Could have pretty devastating results if they decide to implement it.
---
Thanks man! I'm yet to formulate interview questions, but I will this week. Whenever I'm ready I will DM you :)
---
Would both require constant talent switching for raid vs pvp if I stayed healing in both?
---
Or is that mainly priest from disc to holy?
---
Ive played on both in my time playing wow.  Started on PvE (Wrath), went to PvP (Cata), then did some casual playing on PvE(mid Pandaria), back to PvP(late Pandaria), and ive been on PvE since late WoD.
---
Ive also spent a fair amount of time with warmode on and off.
---
I just dont have the desire to play on a PvP server on Classic.  10+ years ago when i was working fast food 35 hours per week?  Sure, why the fuck not.  I had enough free time that if i was getting ganked i could just hop on another character or whatever.
---
This time around?  Im working 45 hours per week minimum, have an hour and a half of driving per day, gym 3 days per week, other hobbies on the weekend, etc.  I just dont have the time (and because of it, patience) to play that way anymore.  Sure, it'd be fun to be on a PvP realm at times, but as far as a main server?  Nah.  Fuck that.  My time is too valuable to waste getting camped by people that i have zero hopes of beating.
---
This. The best form is dedicated and minimal medicated. Cold brew coffee. Eat healthy and pre cook meals. Stand and stretch periodically. Take a short walk outside in the sun. Sleep. 
---
People binging on mtn dew and staying up 24hrs are the ones who are going to crash at lv 40 and wake up two days later to see people in the 50s already
---
These questions are incredibly hard to answer because they depend on so many variables, it depends how active your server is, how efficient your honor farm is.
---
Any decent amount of hours will eventually get you rank10, the question is how fast it will take.
---
Yup.
---
Pretty sure the BiS list for classic WoW is going to be unique. Rank 10 is somewhat easilly achievable and it'll be items close to MC/Ony in power.
---
So in the end of the day, now there's really no difference anymore if Dire Maul is released later or not lol
---
I’m with you also. All I want is classic with the class balance that TBC had. I don’t want TBC either.
---
The question really isn’t will I reach Rank 10, it’s how soon after the release of Honor do I want to reach it? 
---
The more time goes by the easier it will get as more opportunities arise in BGs and the competition will be very fierce in the beginning.
---
Maybe. Either way you don't need them. There were plenty of raiding guilds in vanilla without mages using flasks.
---
You mean like this?
---

---
in my memory, the biggest thing was any sort of portal. normal play was generally fine, but i did get a hiccup if someone attacked me in the open world. (i began thinking of it as my 'spider sense', a warning that i was in danger)
---
entering a dungeon, using a mage portal, using a boat or zeppelin, i would be a minute behind.  
---
plenty of times the group was killing the second group in a dungeon before i loaded, or finding myself traveling back to the starting point on a zepp because i didnt load fast enough to get off at my desired destination.  part of this may have been the shitty computer, as well.  but i do remember when my cable company finally upgraded broadband the difference it made.
---
Obviously you need to know what you are doing when taking any kind of pill, the average caffiene pill has about 200mg of caffiene and you don't want to exceed 500mg, probably staying below 400 is a good bet. The half-time of caffiene in your body is about 6 hours, so one every 8-10 hours is a good measure. Avoid them before sleep though. Plan ahead.
---
Agreed. During vanilla i was 12. Now I'm working on my masters degree and work out six times per week. I dont want to spend the odd few hours i have for gaming being corpsecamped.
---
If people can manage to stack world buffs without ripping threat off the tank more power to them. For me DM buff always meant death.
---
Oh god. I hate that one since I never want to rerun BFD. Same with gnomeregan and the little consoles.
---
3-4 hours per day is more than "casual" in my opinion. :)
---
I've created a guild for people who don't want to follow guides, rush or min/max to the hilt. We do intend to raid and even to clear all content. We'll do it slowly but methodically. Classic is supposed to be here "forever" so we are perfectly fine with all this taking years.
---
I'm sure there will be other similar guilds. So don't worry just find one which suits you and enjoy the game!
---
Haha
---
The bloodelf triggers me hard
---
Warmode was actually a really great addition.  I went back to my old PvE server a couple years ago for the peace and quiet (and was on a different PvE one for a year or so before that), but its nice that i can just flag myself and do the PvP thing if i want to.
---
I actually had a lot of fun doing the big 40v40 or 80v80 raids earlier in the xpac, as well.  I think theyve really died down in the last few months, though.
---
Someone else had a good suggestion here to include a question or two about post-Classic content; I think we'll include that as a start. Then, I think it's very reasonable to make a separate "What do you want post-Classic?" survey, but that'll probably be down the road, sometime after Classic's launch.
---
Well kind of, most resto shamans in PVP have a fair amount of points in elemental. Can you get by in PVE with your PVP spec, sure. Will people expect you to have mana tide? Absolutely.
---
Mage rank 13 gear is pretty absurd. All the rank 13 gear is pretty insane but for mages that amount of stamina is irreplaceable and ideal for pvp. You can screw rank 14 as caster imo. Just add up the stats for yourself to see how much bonuses it gives and then compare it to mc/ony/bwl raid gear pieces, tier and off tier.
---
Just look at how the top players all feel about it. I don’t have the credentials of a top PvP ranker, but I agree with what they’ve laid out. We haven’t seen private server sperging in an official Classic server, but we will this time around.
---
OVER 9000
---
One thing I'd like to ask about post-Classic content.
---
Several times it has been brought to our attention that there are several zones which were intended to be in Vanilla which didn't become reality due to time constraints. Some of them were implemented in TBC (ex: kharazan) others were simply left behind (Emerald Dream). This content, although not properly finished in vanilla, it is still present somehow and could become some form of "post-content".
---
My point is: I'd hate to see threads axed because they spoke of implementing kharazan or the Emerald Dream in Classic. Those were all places which were meant to be pre-TBC and, IMHO, should be put in Classic.
---
Ele/Resto shaman builds are very strong in pvp
---
Dreamfoil and silversage for sure
---
Amen. I make myself some frozen food like chicken soup, and then a big batch of chili(without chilis.. no toilet time for me) before a fresh server, that gives you food for like 5 days, coupled with some premade sandwiches or salad and you are good to go.
---
Ha, this casual actually has a job.
---
I will be grinding the fuck out of troll rep for that white raptor mount
---
They don’t give keurig stamps for welfare?
---
Tailoring is easy and cheap to level. I would only have it for the first two phases so you can get your truefaith vestments pattern from strat. Once you craft the robe, drop tailoring for something else unless you plan to craft bloodvine pieces.
---
I don't think you can "whack it" on youtube. Pretty sure that is a violation of content.
---
Honor system in P2 means hordes of ranker turbonerds camping flight paths, not epic WPvP. Hopefully the change will come about it P3, or at the very least have the PvP gear have the same stats from when they did in original Vanilla.
---
I was very guilty of this.
---
Quick ELI5 on the difference? I played vanilla but I was 13-15 years old throughout and unaware of this stuff
---
I had shitty high speed internet that would disconnect about 50% of the time when someone called.
---
I dont understand why would anybody want to drink energy drinks... just drink water and the occasional cup of coffee. Energy drinks are so damn bad.
---
My entire town got broadband in 2001 so I was fine.
---
I was wondering about that. I had a friend who actually made it to rank 13 and said it wasn’t too horrible, but said he had no interest in pursuing rank 14. He was a hunter and I think that armor really set him apart once he got it. Getting to ten alone I know is a significant commitment, but it seems very doable.
---
ALL OF IT
---
that's nowhere close to what they were saying.
---
At least 5.72 PvP
---
You know you don’t need to level as pvp in retail, right? You have a choice.
---
I dont think well see a giant market of new addons.  I think we will see a lot of remakes of the originals.  Atlas, auctioneer, DBM, 20 different UI ones, prat, grid, decursive... ya know.  
---
I hope someone makes the one bag one quickly and the one that accepts all your auction mail in 1 click.
---
Pretty much the same as there's available on pservers.
---
Addons that basically know every spawn point of every single node/npc in the game, QoL things like auto dismount auto accept things etc, UI's, nameplates, CC counters, advanced map addons, deadly boss mods, all that stuff.
---
R. Shammy is a pure support healer, until you have AQ40 gear. While a Priest can go shadow for pvp and be a T1 pvp'r with pre bis. That is something to consider if you wanna throw down some savage beat downs.
---
I would say unless you really wanna be a shaman, go priest. They are the better more fleshed out class in classic wow. To be clear I am not anti shaman. I am just saying if you are unsure a priest is the better pick. It's  the smoother made better class.
---
Eat apples instead
---
As a healer I find my team is doing too much stupid shit. That I have to correct. Before I can grab serpentblooms. I usually wait until the end.
---
I love how punished rogues are for being rogues, revenge for pretending "world pvp". is a fair fight and not vietnam style war.
---
You should be drinking bawls to go back to the classic says.
---
When you say bear in mind, I think about my future Druid. God I’m so pumped.
---
Just schedule your vacation at the end off the summer, by that time Classic is definitely out. It's not rocket science people.
---
is tarren mill vs southshore analogous to the bay of pigs?
---
a lot of effort, and pride, put into something that doesnt really matter in the grand scheme.  i mean, no one ever raided stormwind or orgrimmar because of what happened in hillsbrad
---
Unless you plan on raiding Naxx. You should be able to be any spec you want most of the time. Some AQ 40 bosses may require min max as well. That being said Shaman won't do shit in pvp as far as dps until it has AQ 40 gear. I can not impress upon you enough. Unless you get god gear. Ele is pretty fucking unplayable in pvp. You simply don't do enough burst.
---
Are you my doppelganger?
---
Orcs and trolls have the great opportunity that is leaving the starting zone to run to nearby Ratchet, grabbing that FP, and then running up to XR and getting it's FP before hearthing back to the starting zone. Could expand on that by running to Taurajo and TB too.
---
You need something like 450 silk cloth lol.  I always just farm it but it's not exactly... easy lol
---
That's how I still do it
---
Dunno mate, never been on welfare :(
---
Energy drinks are 99% sugar and that gives a short term energy boost and then a crash.
---
So you need a minimum of 1 every hour and it takes maybe 150h to 60 (200-250 for normal people) so 150+ energy drinks.
---
You may (likely) die but whatever.
---
Repeating of course..
---
Server size and dynamic respawns we already know. Servers will be roughly 2500 concurrent and there won't be dynamic respawns. They're going for #nochanges so they're not going to make changes to core design philosophies like that.
---
I will be a casual player, and I can’t wait until release. Left retail behind a while ago, it lost the MMO feel I had enjoyed. As did other mmo’s. It’ll be great having WoW Classic, even on limited play hours.
---
This made me laugh. Brax you are completely right. How dare you play a game your way. Ignore the elitist who think only their opinion matters. You play however you can and get as much enjoyment out of it as you can. In the end, it’s just a game.
---
Pretty much every class gets amazing pvp gear from r10 , obviously 13 is better.
---
As for PVE usually using 2set bonus from r10 is best in slot.
---
From MA. Can confirm. Northern MA (on the VT/NH border) had dial up for a while. Also had no power during the 2008 ice storm for over a month. Only a little behind the times.
---
Esfand
---
Wow, had no idea lol.
---
And literal turtle heaven right outside their door. That place is a hunter's wetdream.
---
This is a pretty common theme for most horde quest hubs.
---
I remember running UBRS and all the Skinners would always roll to see who got to skin that boss.  Once I skinned the pristine hide and all the non-skinners also wanted to roll on it.  I said "that's not how this works..." And the tank kicked me from the group and made a post on the blizzard forums about how I was ninja looting.  He deleted it after a few hours of being made fun of.
---
Night elves can do it without seeing a single ?? level mob though.
---
I didn’t know that! I hadn’t even thought about the set bonuses for pve. Could be a nice way to supplement. It’s good to know the rank 10 gear will be solid gear even if you come across a better geared player.
---
can i ask why you are able to use a mouse and keyboard, but must click due to an injury? not trying to be a dick just trying to understand.
---
It seems to be overall fairly balanced.
---
as for your 2nd question, no. The ranking system scales with population of your own faction. I suggest you read up on it :) 
---
There's a cap on how much progress you can get per week, the more players on your faction, the more players can get that progress. You have to be top % of honor farmers on your faction.
---
Just like they were in 2005. Sounds like #nochanges to me, exactly what we want.
---
Every other brand new game... my bad, differing meanings.  They've launched SC, SC2 and hearthstone "expansions" without betas but WoW did have a beta for every xpac.
---
I dont think classic will have a beta because there is simply too much to test, not enough time and too much at risk for people picking apart how things work to get their pitchforks.
---
Let's say an average player who plays 40 hours a week.  It's going to take him 3 weeks to hit 60,  2 weeks go get BiS/Attunes, then he can start testing raids. It's just not logical and better to just make specific friends and family betas to test encounters or specific quests.
---
I do not feel too bad. At least I am not the guy asking how many red bulls he is going to need to drink.
---
Not if you go via land. Even if you swim it's almost an hour hoofing it.
---
I agree with the verdict on post-Classic content being that you'll loosen the restriction after P3 or a Blizzard announcement. I think it's smart to focus on Classic as we know it.
---
The only thing I was hoping to see in this post but didn't was mention of the constant flamebaiting against retail. Technically this already falls under rule 1 and will fall under the new post-Classic content rule but - and mods may remember me complaining about this in the past - I feel that these posts get through too often. Maybe that will change when you add a new mod. The toxicity against retail and, frankly, retail players doesn't need to continue to fester in this sub as we get closer to Classic release. A very large contingent of the overall WoW community will be turning its eyes toward this sub and they should feel welcome here as long as they, too, abide by the rules.
---
From what I have gathered on the private servers people have adapted to ganking at the flight master in lvl50+ zones to farm for honour points. Back in real vanilla it was just for the fun of it, but now people have min/maxed it to figure out the best way to farm to rank up. You don't get honour for killing a bunch of lvl 30s in STV and these people aren't looking for a fun mass pvp fight like the old Hillsbrad fights. Not that those won't happen, people still love that pvp, but the ones just farming to become the first rank 12+ people won't be starting there like you think they would.
---
Solid. Thanks for the insights.
---
Can I reach rank10 before phase 3 with 1/2h played each day?
---
Because I come from a time when they were called player ran servers  
---
I hosted my own UO server. I hosted my own EQ server. I can call them whatever the fuck I want.
---
this is where blizzard needs to ask the majority and change the game accordingly.
---
Generally on pservers and iirc vanilla the alliance had a miniscule amount more overall. It will depend on your realm however.
---
I think a guild will! I dont doubt at all that there will be boomkins raiding as well.  I'm just saying there wont be a lot of spots for them and they wont be in the best guilds on their server.   They can 100% still raid and clear content.
---
There would probably be more undead players than alliance players in total
---
It’s tough. Priest is a defensive healer and shaman is an offensive healer. A good shaman will heal, cure poisons, purge shields, drop wf for warriors and totem twist grounding totem after if applicable, earth shock healers or casters, send lightning bolts if you see an opportunity to drop someone (good on mortal stricken targets to get them to that 20% executable level). Anytime I had smooth wins as a 30/21 ele natures swiftness resto sham I was doing all of these things. It’s pretty intense and demanding but incredibly rewarding when you realize how impactful all your roles are as opposed to just sittting there trying to just chill back and heal, or going all out dps. 
---
Priest on the other hand is the only horde class that can dispel magic, meaning no priest in a bg against warlocks is going to be a ton of fun kek. Priests are crucial in organized pvp for the horde. As a shaman, when teams realize how impactful you are, they start to focus you because they know your value and they’ll do anything to either focus you, or simply cs sheep you (which is honestly impossible to avoid in some situations). 
---
It comes down to if you wanna be more defensive or offensive in pvp as a support role. The synergy between warriors and shamans is unmatched from a damage standpoint. I have spent some games seeing a super geared warrior join and making sure I follow him around because I know dropping just one totem turns him into a potential 2 shot monster. I have not played priest enough to know the ins and outs of the class in organized pvp but I really enjoy the shaman class and so does horde raids.
---
My favorite role is the guy who throws a throwing knife at some mobs on a lower tier than the party in dungeons and then acts confounded when 3 minutes later a huge conga line of mobs burst through a door and wipes the group.
---
I'm friends with Ronald McDonald. He'll give me a burger for a dollar.
---
What if because they’re min/maxing they are able to camp you :O
---
That ice storm was amazing! Had the longest Christmas vacation from school haha
---
If you choose to play on a PvP server then you know what you are getting into my friend :)
---
People better start making friends then. :)
---
What is phase two?

At 3-4 hours a day, you’ll be playing more than me, and I have plans to finish every raid. So time isn’t a factor as much as whether or not you’ll find it fun. I’d say, yes, Vanilla is made for casual players. It’s like a more casual version of old MMOs, rather than a hardcore version of the current game.
---
Dungeons take 2 hours from formation to the last boss, so you should be able to do one on most days. Raiding is only 2-4 hours, but you’ll have to find a guild that fits your schedule if you want to raid.
---
Yeah I remember that and had to eat some words because I thought the private servers had it down. This was over a year ago though and it has been fixed on the new servers since then.
---
I started college during vanilla.  On Friday or Saturday night you could play fine but Sunday through Thursday there were so many people in the dorms the internet got so slow.  My guild raided on Tuesday/Thursday/Sunday I paid $10/month to get dialup in my dorm room and it was better than what the school had.
---
Dark days...
---
Yeah, the whole idea of going thru vanilla again but with more knowledge got me and some friend talking. He share some of his experiences of playing on some vanilla private servers, and his overall experience is that everything is done so much faster.
---
Things like players clearing Molten Core very easily when in worse gear compared to my original experience where we wiped our way learning all the encounter mechanics in better gear. Now I bring up the gear because a lot of wows raid progression was gear check after gear check, but it's really interesting how knowledge and experience can more than make up for it.
---
In vanilla, I had to grind all day to raid all night, just to pay for repair builds/flask/ect. Now I wonder if it'll all be much easier while requiring less effort. It's an interesting concept to think about really and how the Classic servers really won't even be like the true vanilla experience. I may even go as far to say that players will get bored/maxed out and end up taking time off til the next phase.
---
I feel dumb, why does one player getting enough honor points that convert to 12000 RP mean that only 1.1% of other players can get it? Like it's not theoretically possible for every player on the server to grind out enough honor kills that convert to that much RP?
---
That time period was a balance mess but it was really fun.  All of the sudden the world flipped on its head and I got to kill KT the cheap way lol.  
---
I would like this to come down the line the same way it did, not servers dedicated to it full time.
---
The most logical way would be to buff those offspecs current trees as minimally as possible, increase debuff limits,  buff bosses to compensate... it's just too much.
---
Probably not the same case, but we actually had an older lady in one of our guilds and she clicked due to major arthritis in a couple of her fingers. She could still type but the repetitive motion really bothered her. She still played her role and it didn’t matter that she was a clicker. You can be a master “keybinder” but if you can’t move out of fire you are worthless.
---
How much time will we have to enjoy levelling before phase 2 hits?
---
Classic servers will probably be configured completely different since there's no cross realm zones.
---
There's no such thing in a video game as wasting time having fun. You know he had a blast too.
---
Your Vanilla experience from 2004-2005 is unbelievably irrelevant.
---
Wrath servers confirmed!?!?!

^^^^^/s
---
User has 2 year reddit age, no comments or posts before this. I’m intrigued. I’m interested. I’m making calculations. I’m in. I believe him.
---
Agreed, bgs made the pvp too streamlined. And it gets tiresome fighting in the same 3 places all the time. 
---
The biggest tell is my favorite memories from vanilla pvp. Almost none are from bgs, and those are a blur. But I can go for quite a while about fun pvp clashes out in the world.
---
For me it was the RAM. 256mb is not enough. Slideshow in the cities yay.
---
I reached ranked 12 and that was enough for me. Very draining, half pug half premade. I didn’t even think of trying for 13+.
---
"You think you want it, but you don't."
---
You need level 35 in order to get to skill 300. Also, some recipes are drops from high level dungeons (e.g. flask recipes)
---
Oh, wow, I didn’t even notice that sentence. What an ungodly terrible decision from Blizzard. They were doing SO well, too.
---
I played RP-PVP from TBC launch until I quit in Cata. My wagon has plenty of room, hop on in!

That quote was written by Guevara in 1952 when he was 24 and encountered blacks for basically the first time in his life, during his Motorcycle trip around South America (as told in his memoir ‘The Motorcycle Diaries’). The full context of this statement is addressed by biographer Jon Lee Anderson on page 92 of ‘Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life’, and Anderson notes they were “stereotypical of white Argentine arrogance and condescension.”  However, months later at the end of his continental trip, Guevara announced himself a transformed man and even denounced the racism he encountered while living in Miami, USA for a month, while awaiting his return to Argentina. Essentially, the quote was before he was “Che”, in both literal nickname and political beliefs.
---
From then on and throughout his life, Che showed he was ANTI-RACIST through his ACTIONS:
---
– The following year in 1953, while travelling through Bolivia with his friend Carlos “Calica” Ferrer, Guevara became indignant when he observed that all the dark-skinned indigenous Indians had to be sprayed with DDT (ostensibly to kill lice) before being allowed to enter the Ministry of Peasant Affairs.
---
– Che’s very first student in 1957 as a guerrilla fighter was a 45-year-old illiterate black guajiro named Julio Zenon Acosta, whom he was teaching the alphabet. After Acosta was killed in an ambush by Batista’s forces, Che exalted him as “my first pupil” and the kind of “noble peasant” that made up the heart of the Cuban Revolution.
---
– During the Cuban guerrilla campaign, Che’s girlfriend (for all intents and purposes) for the first half of 1958 was Zoila Rodríguez García, a black/mulatto woman. Moreover, his first wife Hilda Gadea whom he married in 1955 was a dark-skinned indigenous Peruvian.
---
– In 1959, Che pushed for racially integrating the schools and universities in Cuba, years before they were racially integrated in the southern United States. For context, the Alabama National Guard was needed to force Governor George Wallace aside at the University of Alabama in 1963 and forced school busing wasn’t enacted in the U.S. until 1971.
---
– In 1959, Fidel &amp; Che pushed through “Law 270”, which declared all beaches and other public facilities open to all races. For the first time in Cuban history, clubs, businesses, and other establishments that refused equal access and service to blacks were shut down.
---
– In August 1961, (9 years after his “indolent” remark), Guevara attacked the U.S. for discrimination against blacks and the actions of the KKK, which matched his declarations in 1964 before the United Nations (12 years after his “indolent” remark), where Guevara denounced the U.S. policy towards their black population. It was around this same time, that the black anti-colonial philosopher Frantz Fanon proclaimed Che to be “the world symbol of the possibilities of one man.”
---
– Che’s friend and personal bodyguard from 1959 till his death in 1967 was Harry “Pombo” Villegas, who was Afro-Cuban (black). Pombo accompanied Che everywhere in Cuba, then to the Congo and to Bolivia, where he survived and escaped the final battle where Che was wounded and captured. He resides in Cuba and wrote his own diary about his time in Bolivia entitled ‘Pombo: A Man of Che’s Guerrilla, With Che Guevara in Bolivia 1966-68’ and speaks positively of Guevara to this day.
---
– In 1964, when Che addressed the U.N., he spoke out in favor of black musician Paul Robeson, in support of slain Congolese independence leader Patrice Lumumba (who he heralded as one of his heroes), against white segregation in the Southern U.S. (which still unfortunately existed), and against the white South African apartheid regime (long before it became the Western ’cause de jour’). Nelson Mandela later remarked that while he was imprisoned Che’s “revolutionary exploits, including on our own continent, were too powerful for any prison censors to hide from us.” {1}
---
– Che was heralded by Malcolm X during this trip to NYC and in contact with his associates to whom he sent a letter. On behalf of his actions in Africa, Che would also later be praised by the Black Panther’s Stokely Carmichael. The Black Panther’s even adopted their black berets in honor of Guevara iconic headwear.
---
– In 1965, Che toured and met anti-colonial leaders from the African nations of Algeria, Egypt, Ghana, Tanzania, Congo Brazzaville and Benin. This led to Che assisting and befriending Algerian President Ahmed Ben Bella, Egyptian leader Abdel Nasser, Angolan independence leader Agostinho Neto of the MPLA, Ghanaian leader Kwame Nkrumah, and Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere. Che also established Cuban collaboration through supplies and military support for Amilcar Cabral’s PAIGC in Guinea Bissau, Alphonse Massamba-Débat in Congo Brazzaville, and Laurent-Désiré Kabila in Congo Leopoldville. Later Guevara offered assistance to fight alongside the (black) FRELIMO in Mozambique, for their independence from the white Portuguese.
---
– When Guevara ventured to the African Congo in 1965, he fought with a Cuban force of 130 Afro-Cubans (blacks) alongside all-black Congolese fighters — they then battled against a force comprised partly of white South African mercenaries and white Cuban exiles backed by the CIA. This resembled the fight in Cuba, where Che’s units were made up of many poor rural mulattos and blacks, against a Cuban army staffed at the top by whites with connections to the upper class. Of note, nearly all Cuban exiles who fled Che’s economic reforms to Miami throughout the early 1960’s were white, despite the island being 1/3 mulatto &amp; black.
---
– Che’s Congolese teenage Swahili interpreter for his African expedition named Freddy Ilanga lived until 2006 in Cuba, and his dying wish was to erect a lighthouse memorial to Guevara in Africa. In 2005 he told the BBC that Che “showed the same respect to black people as he did to whites.”

Lmao you get off your high horse. By the very virtue of starting the day classic launches players that no life the game are going to avoid being lowbies that get farmed. The honor farm/low level murderfests wont be a think for the first week or two and by then players that have no lifed wont be the low level cannonfodder that larger groups will be flight master meat grinding.
---
I prefer irony ganking personally. In TBC I had a max level rogue and I would follow 20s and 30s of my faction around while in stealth. I'd wait for an enemy ganker to make a bee line for the lowbie and then I'd shadow step ganking him.
---
This activity consisted of a lot of down time waiting for someone to take the bait. But was fun when it worked.
---
&gt; I dont think classic will have a beta because there is simply too much to test
---
"there's too much to test, let's NOT open it up to players and instead just keep ironing out bugs with our limited dev team"
---
Glad you don't work for Blizzard.
---
I was torn between shaman and druid before this, leaning towards shaman, but I think druid might be better just so I have the option to stealth away if I have a group of 60s camping me.

manatide totem is free mana if you kill 2 or 3 mobs in the same area.

---
Psh, Molten Core is famous for lines of afk people trying to hide by /follow ing someone else in the raid.
---
I just wish they hadn't stacked rewards so much in favor of bgs, especially during holiday weekends. Not only do you have great rep rewards, but you get multiple times the honor even in pugs. That isn't even counting dhks.
---
Holy shit your rotation on Vanilla as almost any DPS is so simple a god damn 5-year old could click away and still do exact same damage as a guy with uber-keybinds. PvP is a different thing, but dont come telling someone is a bad player because of that lol
---
Okay, you REALLY don’t know what you’re talking about and you’re incoherent. Have a nice day.
---
Many items stats changed throughout vanillas lifetime. When vanilla launched most t1 gear was pretty awful but that changed in patch 1.5 I believe. That is progressive itemization. There are many more examples of this. We currently dont know how they will handle these items. 
---
There are many items that were added to old content much later like several spell hit pieces to dungeon loot tables and relics that druids shamans and pallys use. Those will be gated meaning they wont come out until a similar phase in classic.
---
What are you even talking about? Stop with that incessant self pity. All I said was that clicking makes you an objectively bad player because it hinders you from being able to perform many key actions and maneuvers in both PvP and PvE.

Professions are mostly tied to levels. E.G. you can not get your engineering higher than 150 (journeyman) max if you are under level 20. if you are 20 or higher, then you can learn engineering 225 (expert). The next step to master is at lvl 30 or 40 IIRC.
---
Even broadband back then was way less reliable, and bandwidth mattered a *lot*  more.
---
"Pause your torrents, I'm healing a raid FFS!"
---
it is, you usually take any weapon that has a good chunk more dps and is relatively slow. I never saw a 50-60 with whirlwind axe.
---
You use the same gear.  If you’re primarily a dps, you use dps gear. Healers use healing gear. Druids can vary more than others, I think.
---
Because using WASD to move and a mouse to click abilities lets me keep my fingers roughly in the same space with limited normal movement.
---
Any type of Keybound clicking ( Shift/ALT/CTRL +#’s) causes my hands to go into a “cramped” state the closest I could say would be arthritis but it’s not that. 
---
It’s nerve damage from having my hands smashed by trying to grab a falling M60 tripod. Also have numbness in certain fingertips from exchanging hot barrels off those M60’s at times. We didn’t PCMI the gloves and didn’t notice that most of the protection in the fingers were gone.
---
Elemental shamans destroy in PVP with litle ease whatchu talking about? easy 1500 dmg crits eith frost shock then 2500 with lightning chain = dead
---
Most classes have a super boring raid rotation, just spamming 1 or 2 buttons. BUT, raiding is a very minuscule amount of total time spent in game, and most of that time you'll be happy just to be in the raid and get the chance at some new gear. 
---
Once you're in a good guild, you'll be clearing ony / mc / BWL in around 2 hours. The other n hours that you spend playing each week will be doing whatever else, farming gold, pvp, etc
---
And once you get to AQ you can go fire, and the pve rotation is a little more fun for sure
---
Definitely just make sure and roll alliance
---
Solid. Making me lean towards shammy with that one.
---
Not to mention they can rip PWS right off
---
I don't remember recipes actually tied directly to your characters level. The recipes were always tied to the profession level, crafted equippables and consumables themselves had a level requirement mostly.
---
eaxactly.

 we had fun taking him down.
---
and he probably had as much fun lasting as long as he did and telling his guildmates it took took 2 dozen hordies to take him down.
---
a beautiful game
---
I never said only my opinion matters, I merely pointed out a fact; that clicking makes a player perform objectively bad in WoW. But as usual the pity brigade on reddit is out in full force downvoting whenever someones feelings get hurt.
---
Just know that I masturbate to downvotes.
---
Good good, thanks
---
I think doing fresh servers 18-24 months after phase 6 is a good idea. Get through a full life cycle of vanilla and then launch a new "season." 
---
Any mid-cycle realm additions should start wherever the other servers are to prevent population fracturing. Although, if I'm honest, I doubt we'll see much need. If they underbudget the number of realms they need, they'll probably know it before the end of phase 1.
---
I’ve always wanted to join an RP server. I’m not really sure what’s stopping me. It sounds like another layer of depth to the gameplay.
---
Are facts allowed for this type of subject?

I have a feeling once America legalizes marijuana, people will state that Che killed people for using marijuana. Similar to how once gay marriage was legalized, out of a sudden, he hates gay...
---
I played EQ with a one-way cable modem (still used phone line to send data) and even that was barely playable. But the sense of wonder was so fresh back then that people just made do.
---
None, I would go for water and maybe a little bit of coffee or tea. make sure you're  eating  healthy and getting some exercise in!
---
The standard recommended average caffeine intake for a healthy adult is about 400 mg per 24 hours. For reference, the espresso you drink every morning might be anywhere between 50-100 mg, and the Monster car (500ml) you chug in the evening is 150mg.
---
So a big cup of coffee+milk in the morning and a Monster/Retbull in the evening should be  fairly safe and tasty combo in terms of fake energy consumables.
---
Most importantly is to drink *at least* 1.5-2L of water and having some nearby snacks.
---
I remember using barman shanker backstab build in the early days of Molten Core.
---
Maybe not VIABLE, but we cleared it. 🤣

You can almost do this as a hunter in let´s say Golemagg

Rogue

Going 440 defense for every boss just seems like lazy gearing to me. Def cap on Vael, for example, doesn't matter near as much as your FR for Vael and threat will be an issue on that fight even during progression.  You def cap and ruin your threat while still taking tons of fire damage anyways.  I don't think you need def cap for any boss in progression MC except very early on perhaps(kinda nice on magmadar if you don't have the tranqs) and in order to get def cap for MC you have to sac so many other stats just to not get crit. Shazzrah is mainly arcane damage, tanking adds on sulfuron is mainly shadow damage, etc. I would rather have stamina then defense if I have to choose, which you do with prebis.
---
Same here, I was 16 when vanilla launched and had all the time in the world to raid, pvp, farm, etc. Now I am almost 30 with a job, wife and a newborn. I know I won't have time to raid or hit high ranks in pvp, but I plan on playing at least for a bit for the nostalgia sake. The best I can hope for is some late night dungeons or the odd ZG raid after the baby has gone to bed.
---
I love Herb/Alchemy
---
Swords is still 100% fine for non-humans. Dagger combat is good too, especially on Alliance where daggers don't fall behind as much because of WF being better for swords, and because it makes losing out on the human racial a non-issue.
---
If it makes you such a bad player maybe you should take it to Blizzard to remove the ability to play badly from WoW. I mean clicking is a way to play the game and apparently if they allow the game to be played that way it must be acceptable.
---
Maybe just stick to Retail because me clicking those 4 abilities I’ll be using in most end game Classic Raids, instead of a mouse over keybind will just drive you crazy with my bad gameplay. So sorry to disappoint
---
On pservers the pop is redic and nothing like classic will be.
---
I see, thats interesting. Maybe get an MMO mouse and bind as many as you can to the mouse. If you can use that and also 1-0 and Q, E, R, T &amp; F, you will find it a lot easier and quicker.
---
Would be VERY surprised if they use a significantly different API than the one we had at 7.3.5.
---
Call waiting messed it up if you didn't disable it. There was probably a simple way to do it that I'm not remembering, like a star code when dialing.
---
Warlocks.  While all classes use a mix of both in both environments if they get to high ranks, warlocks love set pieces have some great pvp stats.  I think that's what you were asking.
---
I played on progression pserver with similar phases to upcoming classes
---
It was [2005](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4696613.stm) when broadband overtook dial up.
---
lol very true.
---
its always especially funny when I hear that line in real life from people who I know didn't even support gay marriage like, less than 10 years ago.
---
Yes yes, you're disabled and we should all pity you. I get it. Maybe try not strawmanning the entire conversation for a change - or is your head disabled too?
---
Go daggers.  All the humans will be passing on daggers because sword bonus ;D
---
I actually try to use a G13 with my left hand. I can use that thumb pad with no issues. Right handed and the thumb and index finger are the numb ones. Kind kills that ability as I can really feel the differences in buttons. I had a NAGA before thinking those were big enough to be able to tell but wasn’t the case.
---
All good comments here so I have nothing to add. But personally I'll be keeping tailoring even after the truefaith vestments.
---
Only thing disabled in this conversation is your piss poor attitude
---
i believe the only race that can be all of those classes is zandalari troll and that is certainly not a zandalari troll skull, sir
---
Depends where the new servers start. A couple weeks or months after Classic launch? They should be at the same point.
---
But I’d say if they launch after Naxx is out, then they should be a “fresh” server, at 1.13.1 so to speak.
---

The main difference is AP scaling from stats.
---
Warrior:  
---
1 Str = 2 AP  
---
20 Agi = 1% Crit  
---
Hunter:  
---
1 Str = 1 Ap  
---
1 Agi = 1 Ap (2 RangedAP)  
---
58 Agi = 1% Crit
---
Student here, at least 2 months
---
Hahahahaha thanks!
---
Or just tell him you will kick him if he dont let you both roll. After all you are the tank.
---
Wow, that was amazing. Fairly certain I've never seen that before!
---
Even raiding 3-4 hours 1 or 2 nights a week is hard to do imo. If nothing else it is the consistency, lots of guilds expect you to show up regularly so missing a week or 2 because of RL obligations might get you kicked. Hopefully the 40 man requirements loosen people up a bit more and allow flexibility. I still plan on playing, but I don't know how long I will last knowing that I likely won't be able to progress through the raids like I did when I was a teen.
---
&gt; Druids have decent kill potential because they can dot people up and survive them to death through sheer attrition. 
---
Druids are, hands down, the worst pvp class in Vanilla.
---
&gt; I'm not after burst damage or niche specs, but would a holy pala have any DPS at all to grind someone down in open PVP? 
---
Generally, no. If the gear difference is big enough,  maybe.
---
I’m sure they’ll be just fine with a handy dandy vanish though.
---
If you have the best group of pvpers as ur premade group it won’t be horrible considering there’s no Chinese to compete against. You will steamroll people to easy wins and win the competitive games at a high rate to the point where you are averaging far more honor per hour than anyone else and find urself (example) getting 100k of honor in 8 hours when another person may only get 35k in that time frame. 
---
If you want to minimize the time it takes, then you’ll have to wait for battlegrounds. A lot of us are unsure on the time commitment with this no battleground honor system that many private servers did not implement, or most players were unable to participate when it was active because it was early and a short lived period. 
---
I highly suggest looking for good pvpers and building a team, or joining one as it’ll make your life way easier and less frustrating when you have people with the same goals. Nothing like playing with a bunch of idiots and realizing you have no shot with said idiots.
---
Oh stfu. Going through your post history for just the last day you’re doing nothing but talking down to people and giving no supporting evidence. You seem like a genuinely terrible person. I hate using the word incel because it’s been overused by liberal retards, but you are the the shining example of involuntary celibate.
---
Game is already changed might aswell make it better than worse.
---
ahh well all the luck to you man, you def dont need to use a keyboard in order to enjoy the game, but it does really make you more efficient!

Buddy, I'm not on the side of people trying to ostracize others for things they said decades ago.

How does camping flight paths not fall under the umbrella of “flight master PvP”?
---
I wonder if anyone will be buffing like this in Classic. Tips Out made a pretty good video on this some time back and apparently world buffs are easier to get on private servers than they should be, and Black Lotus should be a lot rarer too. Gonna be interesting.
---
add-on system
---
Hah. Oops. Well, if I do roll a paladin I know what his name is gonna be
---
holy Paladins literally cannot die.
---
But they don't really do damage either. You can go a spec with holy shock which does like 600 damage on a 6 second cooldown.
---
You are right that's super common, but this guy doesn't lead with "I'm totally on team #nochanges but..." You picked a weird post to be salty about this on.
---
They specifically said addons like decursive is a no-go
---
Yeah. No. No dynamic respawns or increased server caps. I like how it was, and that’s how it should be.
---
Sure, let's have class balancing and remove the debuff limit while we're at it.
---
Alliance you can go dagger spec just fine if you are not human. It's not bad at all.
---
Yeah exactly, you definitely get it and how it impacts the larger picture. I think some people really don't like the idea of classic being this way because you can get an extremely similar experience on the current pservers and people I suppose were hoping for something different, and more true to memory lol. The reality is that even if they delay the release of better 1.6 upgraded pvp items, people will still grind r14 so they can buy the lesser items and just wait until later when they are better. That's the real problem with no changes, we all have knowledge of exactly what is going to be in every future patch and we can plan accordingly. We can't have vanilla back because the level of ignorance we had as a playerbase is gone. This will most certainly have adverse effects as people plan for the guaranteed future with present resources.
---
Quit my pointless dead end job. Blaze to 60 taking in the nostalgia and enjoy my final year before “growing up”. 
---
This is probably the last game where no lifeing it will actually mean something I plan to enjoy it.
---
My point is you should let your data dictate the method of analysis, and let the analysis dictate the story. Your posts read as though you know the story you want to tell and the methods you want to use, without having even considered whether you will find things that are contrary to your expectations. Get intimate with the data and answers will come. You are trying to put the cart before the horse, and if you are serious about academia then you should reconsider because this approach is career suicide.
---
Thank you man. I agree with you by the way!
---
The main difference between PVP and PVE gear in Vanilla is the Stam. PVP gear is going to have massive Stam bonuses. There are some small 2 piece bonuses from PVP gear that are BiS for PVE, and vice-versa.
---
I think it is impressive.
---
Hi, /u/HYPERMANIAS

&gt; That's a game you guys started, now you get to play by your own rules.

strawman
---
People who claim to be on the right hate him for essentially being a "communist", people who claim to be on the left hate him for being...? for whatever is trending to hate someone for I suppose?
---
So I’m not telling anyone how to play but I find using my N52 speedpad worked wonders!  You can bind keys for spells and movement and your hand was cupped very comfortably.  I found this to be much less taxing on my hands than clicking and keyboard turning.  I don’t remember them being to crazy expensive and they work incredibly well.
---
Not even kidding that's a top tier name. I hope I see you around
---
Not to boom
---
People actually not using FFA on raid trash :s
---
&gt;Buddy, I'm not on the side of people trying to ostracize others for things they said decades ago.
---
then why did you post an out of context quote from when Che was 24 years old as an attempt to demonize him
---
&gt;That's a game you guys started, now you get to play by your own rules. 
---
who tf are you talking about
---
and if you have an issue with the source, can you please point out exactly what facts they got wrong? even just one falsehood in what I posted?
---
You can do 5 mans as anything, literally any spec, lol. You should try some Molten Core pugs or something though, if you ever have a day off and 2 hours to kill, at least. You would probably need to heal for anything past 5 mans though, unless a pug doesn’t mind having a couple odd specs.
---
I want the old mounts not because they are rare or status symbol, but because I like the way they look better.
---
But I need to moonfire everyone and everything
---
Disagree with your first point. Druids tend to be excellent at WPVP and 1v1. Assuming the player isn't just sitting in one form trying to be a gimped rogue/warrior/Mage.
---
Same, somehow I missed this way back then.
---
The warm liquid goo phase.
---
I'm talking about making it better, not making it worse.
---
That's only as Arms people don't raid as arms generally unless they are too poor or lazy to respec. Fury 2hand would be used by anyone serious.
---
"Oh you're on top of the threat meter? Shame."
---
Might as well go and just play BFA instead at that point...
---
&gt;I like how it was
---
That does not mean 
---
&gt;that’s how it should be.
---
Meh, I only play on RP servers because of the stricter name rules in place and people are almost always a lot more friendly and mature. I personally dont RP but I dont act like an ass and ruin it for those who do, sometimes I just like to stand around and watch others do it.              
---
                  
---
If you want a more chill experience with less elitist assholes or 12 year olds named Zappyboi  come join us.
---
Ahh thanks.
---
They should be introduced in phase 2 if blizzard remembers to do it correctly. Most likely however, they will not.
---
That’s the thing about nostalgia. It’s subjective. What some people may find interesting or nostalgic, you may not. That’s why vanilla is so great and has many levels of attraction and dynamic gameplay.
---
Um. Yes it does. Go back to your private server with that shit. We’re good here.
---
i think its safe to say blizzard can afford to have as many servers as there were during vanilla then let people do free transfers after a few months or years.
---
like its a fucking subscription game if there is 2k people on a server blizzard has the money to make another server. they can also monetize server transfers 
---
blizzard is a big boy i really think more servers is better than trying to cheap out on hosting
---
True. Changing core design philosophies like realm sizes will definitely make the game a lot worse.
---
You could just google that...
---
Hunter and rogue does pvp very well in pve gear.
---
no, no, it's not a game. facts don't care about your feelings
---
and why would you care if someone is racist, if you post on cringeanarchy
---
hey that's fair.
---
Apparently everyone has a very subjective view of what is considered "worse" or "better".
---
In my opinion, anything that doesn't ABSOLUTELY have to be changed shouldn't be changed.
---
Vanilla wow also rewarded people who rushed... as well as people who took their time taking it in. There’s multiple aspects of the game that have a positive or rewarding effect.
---
The vestment appears to be BIS through Vanilla according to this guide (15min tab).

Am I taking crazy pills here? I was a fury warrior and the other 2 top dps in my guild were fury as well in MC/BWL(we never made it past BWL). At least on my server they were pretty popular for pve dps.
---
My brother and I made night elf characters and we wanted to level them in Westfall.  So around level 10 we made the ardous journey through the wetlands.  Only thing we got lost and ended up in the Arathia Highlands.
---
We jept getting ganked again and again.  Until a level 39 bad ass human warrior litterally ran us all the way to Iron Forge.  
---
Afterwards my brother and I consulted the map that comes with the strategy guide and mapped out our ridiculous path.
---
The good ole days...
---
But I already know the release date, 3rd week of June. I have a work trip then so obvs  #confirmed
---
P-blade ambush crits are tits
---
Definitely leaning in that direction. I don’t know what to expect so, it’ll be a good experience regardless
---
I mean you can still moonfire as feral/restore lol
---
You sound reactionary
---
Bear in mind at Che's time the US and UK were jailing and chemically castrating gays respectively, those who weren't essentially lynched at least. Hell nowadays Cuba is moving forward on gay rights and queer rights while the US backslides.
---
Also atwt clearly just debunked the racism in his comment
---
Yah but then I still gotta pug a new DPS, and I can either do that or I can ping one of the ten groups sitting around spamming "LF Tank then g2g".
---
Blizzard shouldnt “deal with it accordingly” and in no way to force play styles on the players. There is Retail for that. Vanilla is a sandbox.
---
So then it's OK to call dwarfs retards?
---
Mostly every guide I’ve looked at says this isn’t a good spec but if you want to then go for it regardless. I’m also going to roll a Druid since I always wanted one in vanilla and never got to but I think I’ll be more about the heart of the wild spec. That seems like the shapeshifting in an out constantly that just has me so intrigued and it looks like too much fun to pass up this time around.
---
They're not going to have 2500 population caps. That is ridiculously low, even if they are trying to be as authentic as possible.
---
Blizzard has ALWAYS forced play styles both in vanilla and in retail.
---
I’m not as no changes for BC and Wrath as I am with Classic. 
---
Still, you shouldn’t cannibalize the game. For example, flying was a mistake, but people like it and wouldn’t play BC without it, also. We have Classic to appeal to its strengths. I don’t think they should take away anything from BC or Wrath that it had.
---
...However, I think you can *add* to each, without taking away. Even one large BRD scale dungeon in BC would be a great addition, for example. Or, in Wrath, maybe a Mythic mode for 5 mans that give your 2 relevant daily badges, so people still do hard, *fun* 5 man content. 
---
So they can change them imo, but they can’t do something so sweeping and game changing like taking flying or dailies away.
---
I was thinking they would probably show up in Phase 2. I'm excited to give that Hunter quest a shot.
---
It wasn't until I got into Aion that I realized there were other ways to do things. I PvPed a lot in that game in a big guild doing Abyss/Fort raids and things, and at some point one of the guild leaders who was also a healer casually mentioned keybinding in vent and I think opened the eyes of a bunch of us lol. We got our shit together after that.
---
It wasn't until TERA in 2012 though that I finally bought an MMO mouse. That game you can't click anything but still had like 25-30 skills, so a gaming mouse was an almost necessity.
---
I'm sorry to tell you but you are just an asshole.
---
I forgot all about this! Thanks for the memories
---
Design philosophies like BEING HARD CAPPED BY HARDWARE oh yeah for sure.
---
Thats a sick vintage setup
---
O7 on the che poster too
---
Private servers are becoming more blizzlike than classic by the hour so might aswell.
---
He's wrong on both points. Vanilla holy paladin here. Yes you can do enough damage to kill people, it will not go fast and it will be a grind, but you can absolutely win fights.
---
 Stay away from sugary and caffeinated drinks. Eat and exercise well. Basically live healthy and you wont get tired as easily
---
Does the  "Pattern: Truefaith Vestments" that drops in Strat only drop if there is a tailor in your group, or can you buy it off the AH?
---
Meanwhile you are okay with every other change blizzard has already made?
---
Classic won't be vanilla. It won't even come close. I'm more for having a good experience playing the same game, than playing a shitty version because of old people like you stuck in their ways.
---
ill sometimes use my arrow buttons to turn if i have autorun on and im eating/drinking/my cat is being an asshole and wont get off my other arm.
---
I have A and D rebound, but sometimes keyboard turning can be useful.
---
Hi, /u/hellject
---
I think I a lot of ways it did hurt the game, but BC was built around flying. I think we need to look at the issue from a different angle.
---
Instead of taking away the feature, examine the problems it causes, and fix those problems in any way possible. For example, a better version of the PVP objectives would be cool, to help with the lack of wpvp. 
---
There’s still Vanilla this time, so if people want to play WoW without BC changes, there’s still the old game *this time around*.
---
He's just trying to help. MMO Mice help a lot of people who otherwise can't keybind stuff. It's a nice tip, you don't need to be a jerk about it.
---
Classic is a recreation. Blizzard gives us the tools. The onus is on the players to create the experience we want.
---
Name all those buffs.
---
Depends on what spec you're going. Combat is the typical raid DPS spec, but I've seen assassination rogues that know what they're doing that can be very competitive on damage. Human sword racial is great, but not necessary to do great DPS. Dwarves can do just fine with swords.
---
One of the things I see frequently is the very vocal private server community putting tons of min/max information out there. These guys have been playing "vanilla" wow for over a decade now and have everything down to a science. Unless you plan on playing in a super hardcore "everyone has to have the highest possible dps / most efficient healing / best combo of mitigation/threat tanking" guild just play what you want and have fun with your friends.
---
I love it when people like you who have no fucking idea how the pvp system works thinks they have a valid opinion.. On something they don't even know how fucking works.
---
you're assuming he even cares about engaging with the facts instead of arguing like a child
---
I’m a Classic no changer, but I have a feeling BC and Wrath, less “pure” versions of WoW will have a smaller no changes crowd. 
---
I don’t want to see them change the core of the game, but perhaps Blizzard could fill the voids and solve the problems that may exist in the expansions.
---
For example, I think Mythic dungeons in Wrath would solve the expansions biggest problem, and it doesn’t take much away from the game and the way it operates, necessarily.
---
I have most things bound, but theres still some skills i dont use as often that i click simply because my hands are pretty clumsy and using modifiers + keys is pretty tough for me.  I use the modifiers with my mouse buttons (and i have quite a few of them), but theres things like healthstone, rarely used utility, etc that i dont really bind because i'd end up fat fingering the wrong thing every damn time.
---
Thats even better actually.
---
Druid are incredibly fun to play because of their versatility. I played one and never got bored. I did spend thousands of gold switching back and forth between specs though lol
---
But mouse clicking is also a repetitive motion so unless only the left hand is prone to pain and the right is strangely totally fine, you'd be putting more pressure on one hand and causing more pain than trying to balance the load between both hands.
---
You can lazor chicken if you want to
---
You can leave your guild behind
---
I'd suggest to make clear about #1 that there is a world of difference between extra TBC servers and "upgrading" Classic servers into TBC servers.
---
You will still have to reclear the dungeon rather than just 4 manning a little slower while the new DPS gets here. It also lets him get away with behaving that way so nobody really wins.
---
Because pservers are so prone to shutting down or having a new one pop up promising no corruption and fixed scripting that there's no guarantee that they'll be around for naxx.
---
Classic wow offers stability at least
---
Cause if your guild dont crit then they're no guild of mine
---
What is all this nonsense about... IDGAF about Che.  Was just a shirt I had on my wall because I thought he looked cool and probably smoked sweet cigars.  Lets talk about WoW
---
Balance Druid is almost ok in pvp, you just need gear which can be hard to get. Moonkin form is just garbage though, you only spec it to meme.
---
Are you insinuating something about my class?
---
&gt; going through your post history
---
You already lost bro lol
---
HMU when you can get laid btw, nice projecting
---
....eventually.
---
But it won't be as boomy. Plus I need to save my mana so I can cast more moonfires
---
Always loved higher levels escorting lower levels. I got ninja looted on emberstone staff one deadlines run. It was all I wanted. No other loot. Then a party member logged on his main and ran me through till I got it.
---
Is that a helix on the floor?
---
Why not just use the mouse all the time? I'm confused.
---
I'm fairly certain holy shock was a 20 second cooldown in vanilla, no?
---
Shaman shocks baseline is 6 seconds if I recall.
---
Am i the only person that feels like flying mounts make much of the world feel *bigger*?
---
For me theres something about feeling the insane speed of a flying mount, and then realizing it *still* takes...what, 10 minutes? to fly from the top of kalimdor to the bottom.  Thats an absolute crazy amount of distance to travel at that speed.
---
The other part of it is that if im flying around im usually in game, or at least tabbing back often to see where i am.  I notice things on the ground, see things from a different angle, etc.
---
If i take a FP i just tab out or afk and miss it all.
---
Fair, what class are you planning on maining?
---
Hmm, true enough. I'll have to rethink how I apply my latent petty spite. Thanks.
---
Not really. Warlock needs +10 more hit in pve leading to very different sets for each. Rogue and hunter are very similar by comparison.
---
Che *was* cool though. He was an international revolutionary who successfully fought to topple a brutal, fascist dictatorship in his country!
---
Based
---
If it wasn't for them none of this may have happened. Keep that in mind.
---
It can be but it depends on the community. I played on Thorium Brotherhood in classic through Wrath, it had a massive RP community at first and walk up RP was fairly common. I met a lot of friends on that server.
---
The RPers slowly either quit or transferred and by the time Cata launched you never saw any random RP at all. It was like being on a PVE server. I still had RP friends there and we would RP together but that was it.
---
So I transferred to Moon Guard at the start of Cata. They still had a ton of RP and a lot of walk up which was nice. It was also infested with furry porn. Most of that stayed in Goldshire but not always. Honestly I found it hilarious so as long as they didn't troll or insert themselves into my RP, it didn't bother me.
---
Worse than the ERPers by far were the trolls. I remember there was a priest who would prepare sermons and speak at the chapel once a week. He was a cool dude who probably spent a decent bit of RL time preparing those speeches. Every single time he did, 5+ random assholes would show up and bounce on his head the whole time he was speaking or cast spells on him or spam noisy emotes. It was honestly quite disheartening. Trolling RP is so easy there's no sport in it whatsoever. Really wish the GMs would take RP trolling more seriously but it will never happen. Anyway it really bothered me but aside from the occasional trolling, my time on Moon Guard was mostly positive and I met a lot of cool RPers some of whom I still talk to.
---
I'm rambling but overall I've thoroughly enjoyed being on RP servers, aside from the occasional jerks. It's not all sunshine and rainbows but if you think RP is something you would like, I totally recommend it! The player base tends to be more mature IMO but the raiding is definitely more casual so if you want to be crazy hardcore I'd stick with PvE.
---
Yeah that’s what I’ve been reading up on and hearing from videos on pvp.
---
Once you get to rank 10, shoot for rank 11 for a cheap epic mount. Rank 12 and 13 gear are absolutely worth it. They're BWL / AQ40 competitive stat-wise. If I was playing a mage, I would probably skip out on the rank 14 grind. The weapons are good, but WAY better for melee classes than casters. You can get equivalent or better damage weapons by raiding with way less of a time commitment. 
---
As for what classes benefit the most from ranked pvp armor - all classes benefit from it. Healers probably benefit less from it for gear that's good in PVE too, since it's spell damage + healing. Straight +healing gear is always going to be superior to spell damage gear in raid situations. But hey, it's great solo gear.
---
That stuff will kill you faster than a run through wetlands... Dring water instead.
---
&gt;you think you want it but you just got pranked bro
---
Yeah but it was on the private server reddits, and was mocked by autists pointing out the awful default UI, the hot bar keys and the fact a level 30 had dal rends and onyixia hide bags.
---
I only remember that because the post image was good, but flew right over the private server communities heads because fun == bad.
---
Because I don't feel like it?
---
I could see that lol. I wouldn’t mind being Resto to do raids but primarily going to be focusing on wpvp and bgs like I always do
---
He didnt say it NEVER happens you turd. But its an indisputable truth that you never had as active of a world pvp scene after BG's were added. Everyone that played the game from the start will tell you that.
---
captain placeholders* :D
---
No they don’t. What a joke of a statement man. You are approaching wow from a modern perspective and not how it was designed. You do not have to pvp in the slightest.
---
Will you have the best of the best? Not exactly but also you don’t deserve it if you aren’t dedicating the time.
---
You are using the exact argument of what brought wow to what it is in retail. That’s not what vanilla is about. Nor should it be.
---
Vanilla content was not tuned around DPS checks the way modern WoW is. I mained a Mage for all of vanilla and didn't pop a flask until C'thun progression.
---
There's like... 3 or 4 bosses in vanilla that require a flask.
---
NA here, maybe I'll be alone after all. Depression.
---
I think flying was minor compared to daily quests, group finder, same dungeons with different difficulties, and zone scaling.
---
Once the game got put on rails rather than making you figure out what to do. It becomes more of a job than fun.
---
I see
---
Nobody forced you to be here. Just dont complain next time you there's some issue that affects YOU and nobody gives a shit.
---
I am insanely interested!  This is all very cool to me.  I am currently working on my PhD in physiology and involved with a lot of research, but its nature is inherently so very different from your field.  Because of this, I would love to maybe hear a little about what you're looking at and being interviewed if needed.  Either way, very cool and I hope all goes well with your defense.
---
Yeah I’m a bit shaman bias but I do love when I see a disc/holy priest join a bg Bc then I know if I do my part, and he does his part, and we have decent dps, we have a good chance of winning if the other team isn’t a premade. I just really enjoy shaman because I can adapt to the situation. There’s times when I’ll be all out offensive and torch people, especially on returning the flag I can throw some really solid burst at an fc at the right time if I try to swoop into a battle. A priest can’t really do that kind of stuff and have more of a sustained dps pvp play when not playing heavily defensive (unless you’re shadow and I’m sure some people can maybe pull off a shadow build but pop out of sf when necessary, not sure if this is a thing so maybe someone else can chime in with high lvl of pvp with priest). 
---
I just love the idea of a mail caster n shield with healing abilities and arguably the strongest burst in the game. Just look up some vanilla elemental shaman videos or try it out on that try hard pvp server with bis zg patch gear and all consumes.
---
No need to get snarky dude. Just seems unusual to play two different ways instead of picking one way and sticking with it. Just was wondering why, that's all.
---
I almost forgot about Aion!  That game had some really fantastic ideas, however I couldn't find a good group of people to play with so it fizzled for me.  Same with Warhammer online and DAOC.
---
3 days played time was achieved on a less than 1000 player average pop private server, that may or may not have incorrect XP values from quests, and other general questionable shenanigans (I don't believe dynamic respawn was a factor, but the fact said server at one point had it on bring into question how accurate the route is to actual blizzard hosted servers).
---
While certainly 4d20h is absolutely passable in a more modern speed run (even joana has stated he managed to reduce that speed significantly on just routing optimizations) I sincerely doubt its possible to be on Live Classic Launch 60 2 RL days past launch.  Play time 2 days? Sure, actual calendar days no way.
---
It's good, but not a requirement. There are plenty of blue dungeon items that boost your healing significantly. You're probably thinking of truefaith vestments being required. Bear in mind that you'll be running live strat a lot to get the pattern, then you need to get the mats and make it yourself. 
---
Or you could just kill the Baron in UD strat a few times and get a set of +68 healing robes.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=13346
---
That being said, tailoring is a great way to make gold when you pair it with enchanting. You'll be finding mageweave and runecloth like crazy during your leveling process. You can make cloth pieces like headbands and shoulders and disenchant them for magic essences and dusts. Those sell very well on the auction house.
---
I don't even bother trying to 1v1 people on my HPal in Retail, I imagine Classic will be even worse. There's no way I have the patience for even a 5 minute 1v1 as a Pally.
---
Well there is even click to move option in a game. It is not named "objectively bad players way of moving". Sure keybinging is more efficient way to play but clicking doesn't make you a bad player. Like binding doesn't make you a good player. You can buy best keyboad in the markets, keybind the fuck out of it &amp; still lose to a clicker in a pvp and pve.
---
if you look at live servers some servers over time become mostly horde or mostly aliance 
---
i think they will offer paid transfers and people seem to transfer to servers with more of their faction
---
Prot Warrior and will have a mage to farm and supply him with consumables. What about you?
---
Being a good druid is about knowing what part of your druid kit to use and when. And remembering that you have one of the largest and most variable skill sets to use. Druids who hyper focus on certain aspects end up getting beat cause they forget they can heal, cc, run away, and go stealth if necessary. A druid mobility is one of their greatest strengths. Anyone who ran a flag in wsg as a druid knows how slippery hard to kill a druid can be. Mix that together with bursts of magic damage or close range feral damage and you can find a way to win a lot of fights
---
I think this attitude is pretty toxic for the classic community. 
---
I don't think this is the experience the average player will have. Guilds/PuGs will struggle with coordination and timing on content during "progression clearing" and this sort of attitude will have players wondering what is wrong with their guild that they are not clearing it in 2 hours, and then start to think that only way to  play is go to the extreme of gathering every buff under the sun before you enter the raid zone.
---
Most people don't want to play to such a min/max hardcore extreme.  Its overwhelming. It's like a job. It's not fun.
---
Continuing to spread these ideas that MC/Onxyia will be steamrolled in weeks by the majority of the player base is going to cause frustration for those who don't have that experience, which will be the majority of the player base. 
---
Raiding is about the journey. The only thing you really need are people who consistently show up. Players should have their reagents, some mana/health potions, food/water, and their gear fully repaired. They should have a talent spec that lends well to raiding, and have raid-ready gear. Every slot doesn't have to be BIS, but it also shouldn't be the same gear you just turned 60 with.
---
I think over-all guilds will progress faster in MC then they did in 2005, because players are more experienced and knowledgeable, but there will be hiccups and there will be wipes as players learn how to work as a team and gain practice at these encounters.
---
As someone who actually leveled as a balance on a private server. Fuq the haters my dude, they don't know how to have fun. You do good damage but you have to drink alot, and it will feel like half the mobs in the game are super nature resistant. But at the end of the day you're walking around as a badass owl chicken, and you'll get whispers all day because people think they've seen a unicorn.
---
he's[ the chief](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWWQVmKOI28) and he need hailing
---
I just finished watching Tips out's video, and is anyone else concerned of third parties selling boosts during P2? If a company has the option to mutlibox or run 40+ accounts, and sell services to one dude to repetitively kill their 40+ accounts for like 10 hours straight, that'd blow anyone out of the water who's legitimately trying to grind ranks, right? How do others feel? If you have have an opinion, please mention why you feel that way and if there are prior experiences on private servers regarding this. Will Blizz be investigating kill trading like win/trading? Can't remember if there were any rules about this back then, and if not.. #nochanges right?
---
**Progressive itemization!** They need to adress this. By far my biggest concern
---
This is artificially created scarcity, though. Nobody cared about those mounts in Vanilla until they realized there was no way to get them back. 
---
These mounts are really just an excuse for players to preen around on them in Orgrimmar in front of people they know have no chance of getting them now.
---
We already have a mount in the game explicitly for that purpose, except to get it you have to bust your ass off. Go earn that one if you want an exclusive mount.
---
Nice. My heart says enh shaman but I want to do some raiding and level easily so probably a destrolock
---
And some random casual will get rank 14 for killing the gankers in 1v1
---
So does yours
---
At least it has arcane damage where ele shaman has mostly nature. Compared to mage it lacks the fun with ice slow and AoE and only can root things on open ground. It has a lot of armor but facetanking when casting is meh. Feral tank is way more interesting than this.
---
Yeah but there’s never a time when you would be attacking someone and your pet is not.
---
Yeah - a multiple choices option might work, or just splitting it into separate questions.
---
Fractal AX8
---
100% yes. It's not like retail where leveling is just a means of getting to max level so you can enjoy the "real game."
---
Everything is the real game—leveling, dungeons, questing, exploring, everything. Even just killing two or three non-elites after you accidentally aggroed a couple of extras is thrilling. Try it and you'll see.
---
No, it's definitely 30 seconds. Wowhead has a Classic site with data pulled from the Classic Demo last year and it has 30 seconds on there.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin
---
I hope you're one of those lvl 50's trying to quest.
---
Okay, THAT is ganking I can support. That's literally the only kind of ganking I've ever heard of that's actually morally defensible.
---
I had a ton of luck with wpvp and duels cause most people had honestly never battled the infamous moon lazer owl bear! And the ability to sneak up on someone stealthed and trick them into thinking you were feral and then they back away to try to get some range and you switch to your moonkin form and start blasting them was a great confusion tactic. Plus I could dash around in travel from to get some space go heal and reposition for more wrath storms. I'm getting so hyped to play a druid again
---
I just wish the forums were preserved somewhere
---
wayback's copy is very sparse
---
Remember going to third party file websites to manually download patches?
---
Funny story, in the searing gorge I found myself on my main "feral" druid (my talent tree was a mess, I was young and don't want to talk about it) fighting a what I think was a prot paladin for a solid 15 minutes.
---
Several potions later we both started emoting each other to stop fighting and both walked away.  It was in that god forsaken dwarf mine there in the middle of the zone, so no one else was around to interfere.
---
Your post has been automatically removed because you used a keyword which is reserved for the subreddit moderators.
---
Yea assuming you trinket and both abilities crit sure you can do a lot of burst damage. Warriors and rogues will stomp all over you. Maybe you’ll kill a mage or a priest and then you’ll be out of mana. 
---
Limited survivability and mobility. If nature school gets locked out and you might as well sit on your hands.

Nice setup though!
---
worked like a charm on ED as well
---
I've found enhancement shaman's really easy to level.  (Some mana issues)  But you will end up being a healer for raid content.  
---
Locks are fun.  Free mount is always a bonus
---
THIS ^^^
---
Community is what we want back.  Why dont the retailers understand that?
---
Thank you for being a non-RPer who respects the RP life. Seriously, it's appreciated!
---
For raiding its quite boring but for pvp it's all about mobility and versatility. You could run circles around someone while bursting them down with a couple wrath moonfire combos while insect storm and moonfire slowly tick away. And when it's necessary pop out and heal yourself and others
---
:( I got got.
---
Oh boy, another one of these...
---
Yeah, plus having a tanking pet means you can do some group quests solo or duo
---
I was lucky I found a good guild that I spent most of my 2 years with. Towards the end I left and ended up playing with a small group of in game friends before quitting the game. Aside from some Korean RNG BS, that game was awesome.
---
Hi, /u/peaox
---
I’ve always been drawn to this class and I maybe got one to around the 30s in wrath but after watching what they can do in wpvp it’s just looks like the most fun class of preformed correctly. Totally agree with you have to use everything you’ve got to manage fights but you have so much to your disposal the ability to just change what you’re doing on the fly to stay alive is so amazing to me
---
Only meant to stop a single player or a duo from easily griefing the flight masters. Against 5+ players ranking they pose no challenge whatsoever
---
Tell me where I’m wrong.
---
It's part of RES to indicate that persons username is tagged in the post.
---
I mean how many people do we think are going to actually get those weapons before BWL? If it’s just the truly dedicated nolifers it could just be two or three players per server, which wouldn’t be a big deal at all.
---
Oh, I totally forgot which sub this was XD
---
Ignore me.
---
I'm torn between full laz0r and something like [24/0/26.](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/BBzDPHAAA8x0xw)
---
they are a bit narrow. Setup has improved a BIT since this photo was taken a month ago.. it just feels clean and i have more than enough room to move. :P but thank you
---
I was asking if the people who were #nochanges for classic were also #nochanges for TBC and beyond (if Blizz goes that far). If no changes are ever made, then we will watch WoW devolve over the years (again) into what retail is right now.
---
This is all assuming there is even plans for post-classic.
---
I think you might have a hard time raiding as boomy but you could def make it work in pvp.
---
I wouldn't say it's too low. 2500 was roughly the original cap. That is a specific number by design and a few Devs from the vanilla team have stated that on various podcasts.
---
It depends on the API they will provide. I've read on this subreddit that it will be a Legion-based client so we might not even have the crazy capabilities the classic API provided. On the other hand we might have proper 40y range check, in which case I might play healer after all!

First column is rank, second is percentage of players in each bracket. These brackets only contain players on your faction that are eligible for a pvp rank, considerably less than the entire population. You can add up what percentile you need to be in each week in order to rank up consistently.  It’s impossible to say how much you would actually need to play. I’d say at least 8-12 hours of pvp a week after rank 8.
---
Realistically you can do it semi casually in everything from 7 to 15+ weeks. It’s not until rank 10/11 that the decay really starts to burn and you need to considerably step up your ingame time substantially for each rank. On a server with medium population, it should be doable in a little over a couple of months. 
---
I ranked to 11 without premades in vanilla, on a medium population server (I doubt this would work on high pop), by doing a lot of BGs during the weekends gaining bonus honor for the corresponding BG that weekend. I didn’t really play during weekdays with the exception of a few BGs here and there. Consistency is key.
---
Private servers spent so long trying to get the end game right, the issues with the game are probably most dominant in the 1-45 questing/dungeons. Obviously they’d need to fix the numbers for endgame content and actually ensure the encounters are done properly, but most of the focus had been on emulating the end game experience in the past 5-8 years, not so much the early leveling, which EVERYONE will have to do, so to have that buggy or broken would be a bad look.
---
Well on the flip side let’s say no one popped on their main to run him through. He would be bitter that someone ninja looted and unable to do much on his own without the help of others. He could subsequently quit to go play something easier and less stressful. 
---
Communities are built through times of adversity. Some people don’t want to be tested and would rather face roll across their keyboard for loot.
---
Best way is to raid as resto and acquire the gear. 
---
Once you have AQ40 on farm you should have a good shot getting BWL cloth pieces (nef hat, nef tear trinket, shoulders off broodlord, firemaw waist, lok amir, etc). 
---
Balance heavy hybrid Druid is the best support PvP class in the game imo. Coupled with engi, you'll be the most annoying thing on the battlefield and people wont be able to catch you to boot.

Not having guild banks forces you to trust the GM that much more and promotes social behaviour.
---
Yeah but you could also farm your epic mount faster than potentially going from 10-11 if u convert all the hours spent farming honor to farming gold.
---
See you all next week.
---
Flasks were really only used on your main tank and your Mages/Locks on your first few kills of Patchwerk/Loatheb.
---
Nothing else required them.
---
You’ll get varying answers from this subreddit, basing a lot of what they believe based on their 2005 experience. The truth is, getting gear upgrades on every class is noticeable, and Vanilla is an incredibly gear reliant game. If you’re concerned about not having enough time to optimally gear your character, just don’t pick a Warrior.
---
Hey we drink that at Quakecon!
---
It's true, I have a piss poor attitude towards people who refuse to engage with the subject at hand.
---
The truefaith robes are very good, the T2 chest and robes from Strat UD are also very good so it’s not like you MUST go tailoring as there are good substitutes.
---
My favorite part is how you shifted the picture up just a bit to get more of your wallpaper in the shot because you low key want people to talk about that also.
---
It will make raid content harder which is a good thing
---
How do you forget about this it’s posted 2 times a week 😒
---
Oof, this one hurts it's so true.
---
i think progressive itemization is a little too much to ask for it makes the whole system a lot more complex.
---
i think the idea was to give people reason to pvp before the bg's come out
---
some incentive to go world pvp is a good thing i would think especially when people are not in bwl+ gear.
---
we also dont know how high rank you will be able to get before bwl comes out.
---
im on the fence about this one the gear is pretty dam good , probally too good if people can get to the top rank before bwl
---
Am I ok with them? No, not really.
---
Do I understand why they're making them? Yes, I do.
---
No one in their right mind expected them to provide us with exact replica of vanilla. 
---
We knew they'd have to make certain changes, all that everyone had hoped for is that they would try to keep it as close as possible and not mess with things that they did not absolutely have to mess with.
---
From what I've seen so far, I think they're on the right track. It's by no means perfect, but it will do.
---
Even if they could recreate it 1 to 1 and it still wouldn't be the same experience, times have changed, people have changed.
---
Also, you have to be really fucking entitled to think that they should make changes based on things that YOU don't like about original vanilla.
---
&gt; I'm more for having a good experience playing the same game, than playing a shitty version
---
What sort of authority do you have to decide which is the good version and which is the shitty one?
---
Is your experience the only one that matters?
---
What if someone else wants to make different changes to the game that would ruin your experience?
---
Which are the right changes? Yours? The other guy's?
---
So yeah, I think it's better if they keep things as they were as much as they can, at least this way people will know ahead of time if they should revisit vanilla or not.
---
That's like saying a man in a wheelchair can beat a man with legs in a 100 meter. Hardly relevant to the overarching philosophical point, is it?
---
That's probably a good one. :)
---
Dude, go booming. I love to see stuff like that. If lucky, you can even raid as a one, and pvp will be ton of fun. Of course you can raid as a resto first and need on all that boom gear. Have fun man
---
First, no one is going to be camping lowbies, unless your definition of lowbie is a level 48+. 
---
Second we don’t know the time frame for Phase 3 yet. 
---
Third I can tell you’ve never done the vanilla honor grind before because if you did you would understand how long it would take to get to that gear and no one is going to be rocking Rank 14 before BWL.
---
r/meirl
---
Probably warlock.  If my memory serves; they were only good for utility.
---
Basically my experience as a boomkin until wrath lol
---
BiS varies wildly between classes &amp; specs. For Warlocks (and I'm assuming Shadow Priests, since we use a lot of the same gear), things like Felcloth Gloves or Fel Infused Leggings will last you the majority of your playtime in Classic.
---
Probably hunter or mage. Ive seen a level 59 frost mage in greens kill a full t2 prot warrior. Granted there was a pvp skill difference.
---
Hunters pets dont scale with gear.
---
Both hunters and mages have good cc and utility, allowing them to kite in order to overcome gear differences.
---
You're right dude. I actually heard that blizzard plans to spawn t3 loot for people who camp flight paths. I always knew blizzard was in cahoots with those dirty stinking no life pvp rankers!!!!11
---
Because they did exactly the same thing with Fortnite? Or Apex Legends? Or ANY other game that was top 3 on Twitch?
---
Nah
---
No, it means it's the player that matters in the end, not the hardware. Saying that someone is a bad player just because he isn't using the mainstream input method is just wrong.
---
Hahah I ordered 2 cases from amazon Im gonna stow them away for release
---
Yeah but it's way more fun killing players than farming satyr's, fishing all day, or gathering resources to sell. Maybe it was just the server I played on in vanilla, but I went from Rank 1 to 6 pretty easily -- before even dinging 60 I think. After that it was 6 to 8 in one week, 8-9 the next week, and 9-10 the week after. Rank 11 took 2 weeks, 12 and 13 took 2 weeks each after that too rolling with the premades on my server.
---
Hybrid build on lvl39 twink, that is my end-game goal :) see you twinks!
---
Dream Dreamstate druid is great for wpvp and offers a ton of support while still being fun and bursty
---
Or you could do like me, and always level as Prot. It's a little slower but ppl will remember your name and you will get CONSTANT pms about joining for a dungeon group. Meet new people, these new people see how much easier it is with a real tank, and they start passing the word around.
---
Anyone can find a DPS war, but people remember the true prot ones.
---
I believe in you brother, let your feathers flow free.
---
PvP is completely different for many specs. But you have to level, you will do a lot of PvE daily. There balance is kind of boring. So the question stands will you won't get burned out with balance while leveling or doing stuff at max level?

Gear score and ilevels are a cancer thar destroys community. When you’re on the same server you develop a reputation based on your performance in dungeons.

Ninja loot something in deadlines? I’m gonna remember that and sure as shit won’t invite you to my Uldaman run.

Yes clicking is very repetitive, but your fingers can lay flat on a larger mouse. You can use the whole finger to click where as most times hitting keys require bent fingers because you try to use the tip and not fat finger extra keys.
---
Even pre-raid bis for most classes is very good. For example, I started to play on a P server with a resto shaman and got pre-raid bis. I got recruited to a guild and downed Nefarian and C’thun in full blues + hide of the wild.
---
"Meh, I am good enough without them anyway"
---
Play on a PvE server.
---
&gt;a full set of BWL could see you through to BWL at least?

A full set of BWL gear will get you through BWL? I certainly hope so...

Basically, the world will look like The Walking Dead.

Such an original post!
---
Drink water mixed with chia seeeds and some amino-acid/electrolyte, and take a Ginseng supplement maybe two or three pills worth. Soaking the chia seeds makes them soak up and absorb easier. Caffiene pills are good too in moderation, in terms of how much stimulant will help - compared to drinking lots of coffee and having to pee more.
---
Red Bull is a short-term stimulant only leading to early burnout.
---
Another wonderful natural stimulant is [Rhodiola](https://www.amazon.com/Nutrilite-XS-Energy-Focus-Rhodiola/dp/B01MU03KD5) which can be found with a combination of various green tea extracts/spinach leaf extract/caffiene/etc. The kind of pill you take with no crash and you don't even get jittery - just focused.
---
But the key is always have water on hand so you can be sipping away all the time, maybe snacking on salty high-protien snacks like tailmix to retain more water and not have insulin spikes where you might get carb-coma'd.
---
If your basis for comparison is a t2 prot warrior almost anyone can kill them in greens haha.
---
If it’s more than zero people, it’s too many.
---
You don't have to hear it. FYI there are addons that parse the combat log and will quite blatantly flash LOOK OUT MOTHERFUCKER all over your screen so you never miss an enemy player using stealth.
---
Of course they will have to be adjusted for the Classic client (like all addons), but just a heads up they exist.
---
Paladins are pretty stong in 1v1 and damage is not really an issue since most classes have no or straight up worse recovery than you so you will win eventually. You don't really have any burst but stunning someone at around ~40% and then getting them to 20%  will kill someone without giving them much chance to escape.
---
The biggest problem for paladins is:
---
1. Getting kited by hunters which can be counterd with proper use of items like frost reflectors, net-o-matic and swiftness potions. 
---
2. Getting counterspelled by mages so you need to be able to fake cast good, don't get rid of your [rod] (https://classic.wowhead.com/item=5462/dartols-rod-of-transformation).
---
3. Getting mana burned by priests and there isn't really anything you can do about it, priests will hard counter you.
---
4. Warlocks in general but felhunters are especially bad, succubus warlocks can get wrecked by using exorcism on the succubus
---
Holy/reck will make you absolutely destroy any melee but holy shock can be really useful when fighting hunters.
---
I suspect you may not be sorry at all!
---
This, also making low level twinks 19, 29, etc for world pvp / when battlegrounds come out is a great way for casual players to enjoy pvp content on many classes.
---
It’s incentive to camp flight paths, not incentive to WPvP, that’s the problem. But there’s an added issue of getting absolute lord gear when people are in MC gear.
---
”ridiculously low”?
---
Cap was around 3500 the last year (or something like that)
---
&gt;That's literally the only kind of ganking I've ever heard of that's actually morally defensible.
---
Man, you've got quite the tall horse.
---
Maybe on an alt but my main will be 60 in the first month
---
If I went into PvP with 440 defense and a shield, I’d would kill zero people in PvP. If I put on STR + AGI gear with a 2hander, I might actually accomplish something. By and large, Tank gear has no place in PvP
---
I founded a guild called Stranglegank, whose sole purpose was griefing lowbies in STV. I literally didn't leave the zone for about a month at one point. 
---
This was very late in vanilla though, so my victims would usually show up on their mains and hunt me down
---
Fucking warriors fans, man
---
Please god no.
---
Whooops!
---
Whenever you kill a turtle near Revantusk Village without looting it, a baby turtle dies irl.
---
But just imagine the "authentic classic experience" memes...
---
&gt; Actually, having all 40 members properly consumed / buffed will save gold and time spent raiding. 
---
There is no possible way you can convince me that 40 people spending 200g on consumables for a raid will somehow SAVE gold. It does lead to very fun raids though when every member push their class as hard as they can.
---
Lowbie is anything below 60. 48-59 would be included. 
---
I assume you mean the time frame for Phase 2, in which case I’m sure people will be able to get their gear before P3. 
---
Thank you? It’s more of an embarrassment than anything to do the Vanilla PvP honor grind. But, I’ve gathered my info from people who have done the honor grind, several times over, on the most prominent PServers. Phase 2 will likely last more than 2 months. 
---
But let’s say they don’t get their full gear (ha) until BWL is released. They still have absolute lord gear while regular players will be *starting* to get their BWL gear. The PvP gear shouldn’t be what it is today until whichever phase 1.1 is apart of. That would be Blizzlike.
---
I always liked how there was that room underneath the middle of it. The bridge wasn't *just* a bridge. It was a full-blown garrison. I wonder if that model was ever used anywhere else.
---
My hope is that it doesn't rear its pointed head.
---
I don't think kids who enjoy Fortnite have the attention-span needed to finish a quest in Classic. This is both a jab and not a jab, because I think it's true. Kids today aren't used to the slow-paced games we grew up with.
---
How does it feel being so wrong?
---
I honestly cant believe I am the only one who just wants to enjoy the game, to each his own,
---
Just an infographic I put together while in class. Tried to make a clear Roadmap for people to reference.
---
Well, you’re completely retarded. 
---
But, at least 3 set of Rank 12/13 gear is BiS for PvP for the rest of the game for most/all? classes. So, it’s actually like them getting T3.5 gear, but sperg on.
---
I would just suggest rewording the phase 1 PvP a bit to make it clear PvP will exist, just no honor points, ranks, or BGs. So WPvP yes, but no systems to support it.
---
Exactly THIS, if there is no Battle groups there is not "im just gonna play a game or two for fun" there is no fun there is only hardcore premades playing all day rushing and crushing pugs, you will have to get rekt 6-8 times before you get   
---
 into a decent pug vs pug and actually enjoy it. 
---
You may ask oh but there will be premade vs premade, wrong they need fast games in order to be competitive, they will avoy playing agains other premades by simply spying the enemy faction premades waiting for them to get into a premade and then queue. win trade, just give up when they face a better premade and wait for pugs, things like this will happen 24/7 unless there is Battle groups and a PREMADE vs PREMADE system, meybe something in beetween, like pugs go server only and premades go to a crossserver kind of grind i dont know.
---
Its not about "server identity" its about being able to play the other half of the game .
---
Honestly, it's way harder to get people to join runs that have already cleared half the boss's
---
Such a perfect post!* 
---
People with your mindset are what’s gonna save Blizzard from ruining Classic WoW.*
---
Take what tipsout says with a grain of salt. He's not that knowledgeable and says a lot of weird shit.
---
He's somewhat right about the world buffs though. On Blizzard servers they have a 2 hour cooldown once the pop is popped before anyone can get the buff again. But! This is likely going to balanced out somehow by the server have proper population caps instead of 10-12k concurrent players. It should be possible for guilds to time their world buffs with lower caps.
---
I never got burned out before I doubt I will now lol
---
Hah! My raid/guild leader had dial up and we were in a relatively serious midcore guild, we even got a server first once.
---
Luckily he wasn't very popular so nobody ever called him.
---
I had my MX518 from release until 2016 :p Good damn mouse but the scroll and right click gave up
---
Ouch, I'm a life long pally, I didn't even consider your armor. But to start off, I'm wearing mostly cloth gear as well, although I do still have a shield.
---
10/10 meme. gj
---
If you mean horde/alliance; I think horde was always outnumbered in vanilla.  My server was like 75% alliance.  We had maybe 5 endgame raiding guilds, and horde only had one endgame guild I can remember.  
---
Pvp was still owned by horde though.  On my server at least.  Horde had THE pvp guild that no one wanted to run into.  
---
But it really did just depend on the server probably.  And I think a lot more people are anti alliance at this point.
---
Thanks for the comprehensive response. It seems like people suggested only doing the class quests that offered abilities vital to play that class or going out of their way to get 2-handers for the super weapon-reliant classes like warrior and paladin.
---
not sure you can really say that R14 is a wash with the itemization suggested by blizzard now. the caster R14 dagger is functionally equivalent to sharpened silithid femur from AQ40.
---
similarly, the only items better than the R14 healing 1-hand mace is the healing mace dropped from C'thun or the two dropped in Naxx.
---
A PvP server that’s 1 sided might as well be a PvE server 🤔
---
Another case of karma whoring
---
Oh it was great. One guy already had what he needed except for one of the BoE iteams, but the other three....it was funny. The guy with all the gear even made the comment, "it's like throwing a foot long sub and a group of homeless guys in an alley and watching them fight for it."
---
Glad I never had that issue in Netherlands
---
Thanks man, appreciate the help!
---
No. people like you are what's already ruined this sub. Fuck off with that bullshit.
---
Lot's of people make memes. If I was trying to karma whore I wouldn't be on an obscure sub like this, I can assure you.
---
Sorry, but your replies so far have been pretty retarded. Not only that, but you've made up assumptions based on something I haven't even said, hence why the word was used. Try to think before you write, that usually makes you seem less retarded, even if aren't the sharpest tool in the shed.
---
Because you are the sole expert that understands vanilla wow and knows what’s best for everyone.
---
Why wouldn't it? WoW classic will have elvui, azeroth autopilot classic, a form of gearscore/ilvl, dbm and all the other shit developed over the years.
---
I'd re-word tracking to ranking.
---
Easy, if there are no wipes and you can clear raid in 1 hour you don't need to reconsume. You will only spend ~50G or less -- nowhere near 200G
---
Wipes are what cause the gold costs to pile up. If your guild can clear and not wipe then the only issue is time.. probably twice as long to clear than the fully consumed group
---
When I was testing druid out I couldn't wait to reach level 10 and get that bear form :D
---
*Cries on rogue*
---
You’re actually an idiot
---
Well if you think the pvp gear is so op why don't you try to grind it?
---
Are you unironically listening to All-Star by Smash Mouth?
---
Hence the almost ;-)
---
I never had any mana issues while leveling my shaman.  Refresh Lightning Shield, pull with one LB or just run up and Flameshock.  Drop fire totem.  Hit them with flameshock if you didn't pull with LB.  Meelee auto attack with flametongue until mob is dead.  Normally I have some +fire gear and rest is normal Intel/spirit Stam/spirit.  
---
Every shaman I've leveled has been at full mana after auto attacking phase of mob kill.
---
Fucking yikes dude, a vanilla white knight is a sight to be seen lmao.
---
Yea it does make more sense. Not sure why Bornakk said "tracking".

---
shut up whore
---
Almost all pre-raid BiS gear for all classes/specs is outclassed by a piece of gear available from MC, Ony, BWL, or ZG. Mostly outclassed by BWL gear though, so a lot of pre-raid BiS gear is still BiS until BWL releases. There are only a few rare exceptions like hand of justice for physical damage dealers. But the thing is there are 40 people in a raid and it takes a long time to get geared up, so even if your guild gets the raids on farm right away its likely that when AQ comes out you will still be using a piece or two of pre-raid BiS gear.
---
maybeeeee
---
Yeah, those are insane. Even the blue gloves are amazing if you don't have a full tier set. Unless I need the extra hit in pve, I won't take those off until tier 2
---
**From left to right, top first:**
---
Darkmoon Faire (10% damage
---
Moldars Moxie (15% stamina)
---
Fengus Ferocity, (200 Attack Power)
---
Mark of the Wild
---
R.O.I.D.S (+25 Strength)
---
Spirit of Zanza (50 Stamina and Spirit)
---
Flask of the Titans, 1200 HP
---
Next 3 that looks like presents are holiday buffs, not sure exactly what each one does.
---
Elune's Blessing, 10% to all stats
---
Hakkar Buff: 15% all stats and 10% movement speed
---
Songflower Serenade, 5% crit and 15 to all stats
---
Shadow Protection
---
Stamina Buff
---
Next 3 that look like candy are Seasonal Buffs as well. I believe they give 2% melee hit among other things.
---
Juju Might, +40 Attack Power
---
Rumsey Rum or Gordrok Green Grog, adds 10-15 stamina.
---
Food Buff
---
Armor Scroll (means it's most likely a horde player since it wont stack with devotion aura)
---
Crystal Ward, +200 Armor
---
Juju Might, +30 Strength
---
Elixir of Superior Defense, +450 armor
---
Elixir of Fortitude, +120 HP
---
Elixir of the Mongoose, +25 agility and melee 2% crit
---
Warchief's Blessing, 15% melee haste, 300 HP and 10 mp5
---
Rallying Cry of the Dragonslayer, 10% crit with spells, 5% crit to melee and ranged, 140 melee attack power.
---
Strength scroll most likely.
---
This list tells me the player in the screenshot is a tank due to armor buffs.
---
Think it was slight favor to alliance back in vanilla

Music always plays a big part in religious ceremonies . You might want to reach out to Chimly. I remember him explaining why wow music generates feelings comparable to religious experiences in one of his scorecraft videos.

(Or maybe it was a podcast? Not so sure.)

I think he wrote a dissertation about wow too (music).

Well it’s one of those things that happen and it sucks but it’s just inconvenient and you have to accept there are good players and bad.
---
Literally every hunter against a melee, but we know your tricks
---
Do enlighten me, what "x wasn't created to y, silly kid" could possibly mean other than that he considers _y_ to be the wrong way to utilize _x_?
---
That didn't matter when I did alliance on the latest Kr*n*s server, although they had questions in the world enabled.
---
Projecting much????? White Knighting is blindly sucking off Blizzard and every decision they make. 😂😂😂 
---
62 in your name, btw, MMEEEEEGA yikes.
---
There is a big incentive to fight at farming areas. Less competition.
---
I just don't think it's a necessary thing for leveling.  I leveled a shaman after fresh opening of that one pserver that is way over populated and never got air or water during leveling, and I didn't have any pvp issues.  Most people were focused on leveling more than pvp at that time.  Either way, I did some pvp while leveling and I don't think that not having air/water totems made a huge difference.  It's not like I was making pvp videos with engineering and using all totems and stuff.  The point is that Earth and Fire are easy to get and I personally never needed Air/Water to level with, even on PVP servers.  Plus doing the Air/Water totem quests at level 60 with a mount is much faster.
---
&gt;nowhere near 200G
---
Flask alone is 120g. Not sure where you are getting your 50g figure.
---
Why don’t I waste my life grinding 12-16 hours a day just so I can have 3 pieces be BiS for the rest of the game? You are unironically asking this???
---
Ad hominem in 2019 lololol, fucking retarded old man
---
Can't wait for STV...yall in trouble.
---
OP is a bit too hot for my tastes, but i have to ask what's the real difference between getting this gear before BWL vs a few weeks post-release? if the argument is that it lessens progression, I don't see that as holding any more weight than the fact that, by the time AQ40 comes out, a ton of people will have had time to reach high ranks and get their 1.12 gear. The presence of BGs and natural downtime during this phase of the game will make it even easier for the average player to rank and get the gear before the next set of content comes out (loot of which the PvP gear will still outperform in many aspects)
---
They haven't said anything about server size or dynamic respawns, so not sure what you are talking about? Could you please point us toward a blue post or a vid where they talk about it? I mighta missed it.
---
Then play what you want to play :) If you have constant doubts and whatnot then go check it on the undocumented side of WoW. There are PTR subservers available.
---
How about the thought that Blizzard is screwed regardless what they do, so we might as well just wait a week for the cluster to sort itself out... and then play?
---
No, [design philosophy](https://youtu.be/izCBaGfGJCg?t=2394). It's been confirmed by Mark Kern multiple times, it's been confirmed by Kevin Jordan multiple times.
---
I never really felt hardcore in my playing. I mean... i played for like over 2 years and did some raiding but I didn't really understand a lot of the game. I also was really fucking terrible at leveling. I would say probably one of the worst people ever honestly lol. Won't tell you my /played to reach 60 but it was fucking insane lmfao. But I enjoyed it.
---
I don't think you have to hit 60 to enjoy the game honestly. And if you do you don't have to do it as fast as possible, with the best class/race pick, best talents, etc. etc. People been freaking out about this stuff but that was never what classic was about. So many of us were young or just new to this idea of an mmorg and everything. People played crazy builds and did their thing and could still kill people in pvp and do raids. 
---
So yea I think a casual can definitely enjoy classic.
---
That is very miss-leading in my opinion. Shaman is in very good spot with BWL gear, AQ is Just pure luxury. Also its much easier to get items since at least half of the gear could be t2, vael shield, lok'amir, trinket that nobody cares about (+ ZG) and list go on. On the other hand good luck getting off-set cloth spells dmge items - Benediction is only the exception. Also alliance has two deffensive dispelers that will make u sad very often
---
Why would they make changes to the game for no reason? The server size was a core design decision, they picked it on purpose.
---
No. Population decay is a real issue and with everyone from retail getting a free trial basically expect realms to go from queue to sparse way faster than vanilla.
---
So what is PvP then? Becasue most people here seem to pat eachother on the back that camping redridge as a level 60 is PvP so why not flight path camping?

All you can stop complaining about what’s beyond 1.12.  Blizzard knows their new market.  Both TBC and an indefinite 1.12 were scrapped in favor of a Fortnite xpac:  FARMING SOLO-LEVELING WARRIORS FOR METAL TO BUILD METAL HOUSEtm
---
Boring rotation, but we get invited to raids. Mostly make sure to keep up your assigned Curse &amp; spam Shadow Bolt. They're a lot more fun in dungeons &amp; solo or small group grinding out in the world, where you can really put your DoTs &amp; Fear to use.   
---
Also if you always keep 1-3 bags of shards on hand for summons your guild will love you.
---
This is new and exiting 
---
People like you are the reason I don’t even go to the actual forums anymore
---
My personal strategy.  Vendor quest items that I don't use.
---
Level my bank/auctioning alt to 5 and give them enchanting so that I can mail them all Auctionable items I get including BOE greens.
---
If the greens don't sell or aren't worth trying to sell, the bank alt can DE them.
---
I like how excited they are about it though, its contagious. Im gonna watch the hell out of it on twitch, but I can't survive the chaos personally. Gonna have to watch from a safe distance.
---
He won't. And assuming the gankers are ranker that he kill often, reminder they stop giving honor after a few kills anyway.
---
They're terrible in MC, ok in BWL, good in AQ, beast in Naxx. Basically the opposite of hunters.
---
Hi, /u/ShurimaSands
---
you seem to have absolutely no idea how slowly ranking up goes
---
It was the design philosophy of the game in 2005, they're not going to change something like that. If they do they might as well start re-balancing classes and removing the debuff limit because the game is already changed and ruined.
---
i love pvp servers
---
but having absolutely zero battleground is going to be boring for a lot of people
---
Haha i remember doing the same thing on my server,
---
I had so much fun.
---
Also, if my character is doing any crafting profession like Tailor/LW/BS, I can send the items to my bank alt for DE and still have a gathering prof like Herb/min/skin etc...
---
And i tell you there is plenty of world pvp and raid vs raid action on private server even with BG.
---
Rankers are staying in bg but even if no bg they won't join in raid vs raid action because it will give far less honor than camping flight path or killing 48+ lowbies that are questing.
---
Legit had a mage on my server called 'What'. It was a long time in vanilla wow before I saw this and then my brain went "Wait a minute"
---
I have my gym pre workout if I'm desperate.
---
original phase lengths are known. its not a far stretch that they'll be sticking to original
---
so 11 months worst case, maybe sooner if they shorten, but waiting even 8 months would really suck
---
Are you scared of fruit?
---
I seriously only saw the last boss 1 time out of the multiple times I've ran it because someone would always screw the candles up and wipe the group. Even when you warn the group ahead of time, someone still does it.
---
They've already answered this one. They will not be doing progressive itemization. They will however be doing loot table gating, where NEW items were introduced in later patches. So if a new BoE epic was added in 1.11, then it will not be available until the respective phase. Does this make sense? It's kinda weird to explain. Like items won't have their stats changed (ie, updated in later phases), only NEW items will be added to loot tables.
---
Let your shit flag fly.
---
I'd take it in even 3
---
when actual release happened people were feeling out the world and learning things
---
since we know everything to do already, its going to be crazy boring to have to wait the full time
---
That’s great but when is launch?
---
Thanks
---
I’m under the impression that ele shamans best gear for PVP comes from PVE. 
---
I played ally though so if someone can say more please do.
---
feelsbad
---
100% agree, and massive populations and dynamic respawn make the game so much worse, so lets not do that.
---
I realize now that if its according to original release it will be 8 months till WSG and 11 months till AB. fuckkk
---
Sorry if I screwed a group for you :(
---
Umm yea, but we are in 2019. If you haven't noticed blizz has made some pretty big changes as to how the game was in 2005. We aren't getting a 1:1 vanilla wow like we had back in the day.
---
So they haven't made a decision on server size or dynamic respawning yet, for good or worse. (Not disagreeing with what you're saying.)
---
It only seems like a tall horse because you're rolling around down in the mud.
---
I agree they shouldn't start it with BGs
---
but waiting 8 months for WSG and 11 for AB is gonna seriously suck
---
I hope they find a happy medium
---
If only
---
Yeah, about a dozen people have made some shitposts, what's your point?
---
Casual doesn’t necessarily mean you like an easy mode.  I consider myself casual because I go to school and work.  Doesn’t mean I don’t appreciate a grind game.
---
I’m not worried about the rotation, I’d love to be helpful with utility. I’m more into the PvP advantages of being a warlock but don’t mind pressing 3 buttons during raids. Although I am terrified of the hideous armor I would have to use as bis lol
---
You are entitled to that opinion but, I would say by patch 1.12.1 it's pretty hard to get an ele shaman to work. They nerfed the trinket stacking by this patch. If you don't mind can you link me the gear that you use? When I played a shaman I found it really hard to get the right stats to get ELE to work well in BWL gear.
---
&gt; but I have a feeling some English servers in EU will get (partly) used by people who don't have their own language servers  
---
I mean, this is obvious, no? Barely anyone will play on a server that they cannot communicate on, because they don't speak German / French / Spanish etc. and everyone speaks English, at least enough to communicate on a normal level.
---
yeah, 14 days sounds about right for a first timer. Im not really sure why were even obsessing so much about the time it takes tbh, but people here seem to vastly underestimate how long it takes on average.  
---
Even if you have limited time to play I recommend taking a second to consider why you're in a hurry tho, im also quite limited but im going to take my time and level slower than I usually do, really take it all in and enjoy it once more. If being efficient is fun to you, go ahead tho.. I just dont want everyone to get dragged into the rush to 60/endgame mindset of retail, when vanilla can be so much more.
---
Ignore the flask costs - melee and healers don't need a flask unless AQ/Naxx. Tanks are the exception as guilds might help with Titans cost. Casters would only be paying more
---
You use 1-2 elixirs (60min), 1-2 potions (60min), 2-3 buff food (30min), 2-3 oil/ weightstone(30min), a handful of protection potions, melee uses jujus, casters use mana pots... Easily no more than 50G -- wlock/ mages being the exception while flasking...
---
Pre normalisation shanker backstab would have been a relatively strong setup for MC raiding. If it was post normalisation yeah you were just a newb.
---
A rogue without stealth, even I wasn't that bad.
---
It was about 95% watching someone else quest. I have fairly few worthwhile memories of dishing out poison tipped justice for hours of boredom.
---
I wouldn't recommend it no matter how cool it sounds in theory.
---
A lot of experienced private server players are saying the same thing because we've seen it in practice.
---
One of two things will happen, they will change this before launch and WSG will be released the same time as the Honor System or they won't and you will see huge outrage on the forums.
---
Wasn't trying to be snarky tbh.
---
I've been playing games since DOS. A lot 9f games I've played there were no mouse controls, sometimes I run around with wsadqe sometimes I use the mouse. A lot of times I'll hit autorun and just turn with the keyboard.
---
No idea, I've never in my lifetime of playing World of Warcraft have ever had anywhere near that many buffs. This raid speed-running phenomenon from pservers confuses me. I'd much rather spend an extra 30 minutes clearing MC every week than spending however much gold and time it would take to get all of these buffs pre-raid.
---
I also wanna be very clear as well. I am not saying Shamans are garbage pre AQ40. I am saying it's hard to play it as ele because you don't have the stats you need to go 1v1 with other classes yet. Yea you can be a support and be really useful on a shaman pre AQ40 but, it was not my experience that you would become the thunder god you become after AQ40.
---
Nah,  just don't wanna take floor and other unnecessary stuff to the shot.
---
Nigga the only "yikes" i see here is your bitch ass using instagram emojis on fucking reddit
---
Nobody will. 
---
But we may see PvP purples before it.
---
Yeah man just play 12 hours a day for 6 weeks straight to collect those #fReEepIcS. Why wouldn't you??
---
I don't really get mad about it, I pretty much just expect the worst going in but hope for the best. Same story with the egg of Hakkar in ST, the odds of getting a group that doesn't mess that up are slim.
---
10/10
---
I think the non-english realms will mostly (or very likely even exclusively) be populated by people speaking that specific language. For the english realms though I think it will happen as you guess.
---
Even mixmaster BiS is pretty good looking for Warlocks. Felcloth &amp; Robe of Winter Night or Robe of the Void doesn't look half bad. Sash of Whispered Secrets &amp; Ebony Flame Gloves work pretty well with them too. We really lucked out with the aesthetics of our BiS and sets.
---
That you're unoriginal and make shit memes.
---
waiting for the picture to load from the top down like a dot-matrix printer
---
edit: I see you on lights hope posting occasionally, you should know all of this :'0
---
I'm right on both points. Vanilla Shaman here. Yes, a HPal can do enough damage to kill people, if they do nothing to stop them. But if you go against someone with equal gear 1v1, you're gonna BHearth or die.   
---
Druids were the worst PVP class in Vanilla. They might be okay vs some 1v1, but most classes can demolish a Druid. Druids were hot garbage in Vanilla. The only time there were good enough to 1v1 someone was with much better gear. Like HPal.
---
Blatantly stolen.
---
TBC and WotLK were the highest points of WoW in terms of population, and are consistently the highest scoring expansions in "what expansion was your favorite?" or "what expansion would you like to play again" polls.
---
So that's why TBC and WotLK could be very likely, and Cata+ are less likely.  Even if they made Cata, Mists, et. al...would it affect you?  Probably not.
---
People who want the OSRS model are trusting Activision not to screw it up.  That's a lot of trust to put behind a company that's screwed up everything else at Blizzard.
---
I made this myself lol
---
I think I wrote it wrongly. I meant English servers where half the chat is in a foreign language and the server is like unofficially an Italian server for example. I'm fine with that but what if you're unlucky and are in that server for example
---
Echoing everyone so far, this game was meant to be enjoyed casually. 
---
These daily threads might lead you to think you are not worthy of classic WoW, when in fact you will find many more players like you than the vocal few on here. :)
---
I mean, people have been saying for years that if Classic releases it would divide the community.  Why does the line have to be drawn at Classic?
---
So that's why TBC and WotLK could be very likely, and Cata+ are less likely.
---
Yeah it’s no T2 but I guess lol, aside from that I’m more excited to try something different and I think locks would best fit my preferences &amp; playstyle over other casters. Locks have huge potential to be God’s in PvP if I remember?
---
I demand RP-PVP darnit
---
Or you may end up building so much excitement and expectation that you’ll be utterly disappointed when it does land.
---
I mean, I dunno really. I did cave in and play on a PS, and boy, let me tell you... the game - wouldn’t you know it - got old! Part of me wonders if what I want is to actually Vanilla again, or to just get back to where I was before - i.e., get back what blizzard took away from me.
---
There’s no mystery anymore. Kill mobs. Get item. Talk to NPC far away. Kill more mobs. I mean, I have wonderful memories, but I can’t help feeling kind of dumb as I engage in endless uneventful combat and eating and drinking to restore mana... this time it does feel like I’m wasting my life away.
---
For now, it feels like I’m chasing the dragon of warcrack. I don’t see this changing when classic hits.
---
That I would aggree on, 1v1 is hard pretty much whole life-span, because rogues, warriors and warlocks are scaling much better with gear. O would also concider troll instead of UD, shadowguard scales really really well with SP, can blackout and spammable 20% mortal with physical dmge reduction is in my opinion better than meh dot that has to be used with another CD, if u are willing to give up Wotf ofc.
---
Feral druid, especially tank spec'd with all the armour trinkets etc is the most overpowered class in PvP, especially early on.
---
Great update! (Apr 9 boss page) 
---
Do you plan on having a contingency plan for dungeons having 1.10 loot on release?  IE: Mantle of Lost Hope from Lord Roccor. I have it on strong suspicion that they will be there on release.
---
They're fantastic in PvP, but require a lot of micromanagement of timers &amp; pet management. The only alts I ever end up playing besides my Warlock main were Rogues, simply because they hit the button mashing sneaky fun that was the only thing my Warlock didn't give me.
---
I almost always take skinning while leveling.  I almost never skin inside a 5 man pug.  Not gonna slow the group for some shit I can easily gather outside. (Now if the group is slow, that is a different story... ..skin away)
---
If you’re not going human, roll combat daggers.
---
Mostly because you won’t have to compete for swords against the other rogues/fury warrs. Plus, daggers are very roguey 😄
---
I don’t mean identical, but you literally stole the the other dude’s idea where he’s saying booty bay phase 2 and has the boats from D Day. Just do something original man. Mods just posted about this half assed shit.
---
I am stuck between these two as well. I played both to level 70 back in TBC. I am scared to be too squishy as a shaman on a PvP server.
---
I made this 6 months ago, he stole my idea asshat
---
I don't see them changing such a core part of the game, especially considering that they added back the debuff limit (which was a technical limitation) and spell batching. They're going out of their way to make the experience as authentic as possible and server community is one of the biggest contributors to that experience.
---
Aragorn is a ranger tho.
---
I feel exactly the same, I also started during wotlk. I loved hearing my guild members talk about how things were different in vanilla, it sounded so special and unique.
---
/roll

It's the year of our lord 2019, can't trust anyone that doesn't appreciate an initial D joke.
---
There were 10 year-olds leading raids in vanilla.  You will do just fine.
---
I don't know why but this just made me more hyped than ever.
---
Didn’t even have to watch this to remember “Hunter! You will want every single weapon in the entire freaking game.”
---
Accurate.
---
I would craft the vestments then drop tailoring. They are very good and look awesome. However no one is gonna be mad that you’re rocking Robes of the Exalted instead, so going with money making professions would also be fine.
---
I'm curious why they included as Maraudon as a bullet point in phase one. Been a long time since I've played and I had to look up with instance it even was.
---
Me, concerned, more-than-above-average player: Brings up perfectly valid and reasonable point about Blizzard’s calamitous decision making
---
Ultra-casual subreddit where the people need reminders to breathe: omg dude lol ur so toxic why don’t you just worship everything daddy activision does. NO DISSENTERS!!
---
I think it’s because it got added a (couple?) patches in, but was meant to be included in the initial release.
---
&gt; I’d love to be helpful with utility
---
That's your main purpose early on. Summons, Soul/Healthstones, curses. Warlocks are so fun in Vanilla PVP. I played one on Alliance and Shaman for Horde. I've played a decent amount of WoW, so I don't remember every patch and every ability, but you have a lot of options in PVP. Biggest threats are usually Warriors/Rogues with CD's up, but you can still win against them. The VW sacrifice is very nice.
---
Wasn’t there a video of a rogue who owned everyone naked with level 1 daggers?
---
Probably that class
---
This isn’t a Private Server.
---
Yeah kind of what I figured.
---
Thank you!
---
I probably had 3-4 almost fully decked twinks before I ever reached endgame. Beats me how I was able to fund that but I spent a lot of time just on twinking the 19 bracket. So much fun, especially when you find that twink guild.
---
So...you’re either reposting your EXACT same meme karma whore farming or you’re just hopping on the black and white pics of war and saying phase 2 or stv and karma whore farming. Sounds like you’re the “asshat”.
---
Somehow I missed this place entirely while leveling in vanilla. That and Mauradon.
---
Havent really seen any1 ask if the tier2 models are going to be looking like trash and get upgraded models later on? 😄
---
Quality post
---
The real issue with the gear is that the PvP gear wasn’t buffed to nuclear levels until 1.10, one full patch after AQ40’s release. Instead, this incredible gear will be available before (likely) or very soon after Blackwing Lair’s release. 
---
That doesn’t even cover the issue of P2 becoming a flight path decimation simulator, which has been evidenced on PServers. There’s footage somewhere of how it will exactly play out on Mn’s channel.
---
But, the casuals revere Blizzard, so any decision they make will be met with glee and admiration.
---
&gt; with all the armour trinkets etc 
---
They are only good if they outgear their opponent early on. They are okay late game when everyone has raid gear because they are so tanky and can heal themselves, but they only win through attrition, you can just run away from them.
---
Warlock will wear bloodvine set until naxx
---
He saw some shit in the jungle mate
---
I'd much rather just avoid that kind of shit all together so I happily opt out of a PvP server.
---
If you like 2500 as a cap and one of the server options has that population cap, how does it affect you if there are other servers with larger population caps?
---
Everquest TLP rolls out staggered servers just fine. Bringing new fresh servers online and merging old ones is healthy for the player base.
---
having a guild bank does not remove that trust
---
Yes *if* the population on some servers get low they will need to do something about that, offering free transfers to healthier servers or something. They don't have to alter a core design philosophy and start offering megaservers.
---
Gear Score and ILevel came from the breakdown of Guild Community and a rise in the number/ability to PuG. - I feel like Guilds will be a big deal again which means there will be little need for that kind of "Selection Processing" Add-on.
---
That's the hope anyways!
---
They haven't spoken at all about what extent they will do progressive itemization.. Just that they will do some dungeon changes in phase 5 and add things that were added in 1.10/1.11 to phase 5.   They did leave it open ended a bit but it leads me to believe that they will keep all of the MC loot as it was in 1.12.. so the changes to tier pieces / adding benediction / etc should all be there at the start.
---
But until they specifically spell it out we wont know for sure.
---
Yeap...
---
Died quite a few times afk on a Griffin at LHC. Damn you ashbringer.
---
You will lose to warriors, rogues, shaman.
---
Mages, Paladins will sustain you with their tears.
---
I don't remember how they fair vs priests, hunters, druids.
---
Im pretty certain they crush priests and druids because if mana drain.
---
I need it released tomorrow as a surprise:D just cuz why not
---
I mean, at some point i might make a character on a pvp server to play around with, but it certainly wont be where my main is.
---
Technically not an infographic but good job.
---
I'd argue vanilla is more casual friendly than retail.
---
Do it, its one of the best quests in classic.
---
christ dude, did you even take a second to think maybe your point isn't actually valid and reasonable? That maybe you're making a big issue out of something that isn't an issue? That maybe you are vastly overestimating the speed at which people will rank up.  
---
but nooooooo, no, definitely couldn't be any of that  
---
its everyone else who must be wrong, right?
---
Contact support and have a note put on your account.  Drastic geographic ip changes can flag you.
---
Most of the p-servers were close to perfect balance, also I think that many players found out that alliance is really strong in vanilla (PvE wise its faceroll in compare with horde and PvP wise its anyones game) so the myths with "great horde" are overcome
---
Hmmm... private servers do this easily.  Like, it’s literally a setting in a config file....  don’t see how it could pose a technical challenge to Blizzard. Even Daybreak Games can pull it off (sort of).
---
I’m reposting the exact same meme karma whore farming. Didn’t get the memo that a picture could only be posted once on the internet.
---
Thank you very much! I posted it in our guild discord so that the less attentive players can easily see the current plan
---
You have to remember that this is a 15 year old game now instead of a global phenomena that is rising to become one of the biggest games of all time with a constant influx of new people.
---
In Classic a lot of people will play for a couple weeks to experience a fresh server and never touch there characters again. So if you have a population cap of 2500, after a month the server is going to be peaking at 2000. This will continue to dwindle throughout progression.
---
It is an MMO, do you really believe that if you had a time machine and went up to the Vanilla devs and said "here is the technology to allow 15,000 people to all play on the same server at once without causing lag or other issues" they wouldn't implement it into the game?
---
If I get the drop I’ll give it a shot. I am not looking forward to when I inevitably mess it up and have to wait 5 hours for a respawn
---
* X Pearl instead of ElvUI
---
* Vanilla Guides instead of AAC ( I will grant you that leveling aids where a little harder to find in the day.
---
* Gearscore. Yes.Keep that CRAP out of all versions!!!!
---
* DBM instead of Bigwigs or CT Raid Assit
---
So your point?
---
We had and used addons in Vanilla. That does NOT make it any less authentic. 
---
The removal of some types of Vanilla addons will even make the game more challenging for some and teach them to ya know.. actually heal and decurse.
---
Why you no like TukUI/ElvUI.. that makes this blind old man sad :(
---
Coward?
---
Respawn times were reduced in vanilla, just dont ask how much.
---
When did they upgrade the models?
---
I spent a month and a half farming bloodfang during wod. And my goal for classic is to have bloodfang. Fuck me it's going to be hard.
---
Yea, but you literally can't say they have decided on it one way or another, when they literally haven't said anything about it. They have already made changes in order to "keep with the essence of vanilla", which were not true to how the game was in 2004-06.
---
Warlocks are great to level, fun in 5-mans, really solid in PvP with a few different builds that are viable but as others have said, raiding can be a bit dull besides a few specific fights (Garr comes to mind).
---
Pay blizzard to swap server if you are unhappy
---
The warrior set has a 2 piece of 40 Attack Power. Combine that with the 2 rank 10 pieces of gear, which add 39 STR, 42 STA, 2% crit, 1% hit. That’s pretty damn powerful.
---
Correct, I had a wrong source.
---
First raiders go marching into MC
---
“Um, anyone got quintessence?”
---
Damn...
---
If you want an advice just play a rogue. you felt like its your style so don't miss it. competition is good cos it makes the game more long lasting. and finally getting the piece of gear more wholesome.
---
warlocks are a very gear depends class, and pretty trash in the beginning of vanilla both in pvp and pve, but in aq and naxx patches they start pwning hard, and in naxx they one of the top damage dealers, and become really cool in pvp aswell, cos they start doing so much damage.
---
they still probably the most immobile class in the game, and once slowed nothing they can do, so wise positioning is the most key thing for them, if you are caught its quite rip, they continuosly struggle with melees and getting raped by charging warriors with healers behind them in bgs with no chance, which is frustrating. and warlocks are warriors most favorite target. 
---
destro warlock with sucubus is very technical and complicated play, with a ton of nuance, it relies on setting up burst and more galss cannon build and high spd gear and crits. Sl warlock is braindead, and relies on tankiness and doting ppl, outsurvivng the opponent.
---
Yeah dude I had like a month off from school and all I did was play WoW hahaha
---
&gt; Content Release Timelines (how many weeks/months each phase will be) 
---
You won't get a statement on that is this will depend on retail releases.
---
One sub, two games. Activision will make sure that they are not allowed to release the next classic phase when retail just got enough content to keep the sub numbers up and running
---
How many hours/week for 12 &amp; 13?
---
Welcome to the club! I’ll be sporting a toddler and newborn when classic drops!
---
Rolling PvE and hoping to join a guild of like minded casuals with less time to play then back in the day.
---
&gt;fucking entitled to think that they should make changes based on things that YOU don't like about original vanilla.
---
It's not about my opinion, it's about what people want. And trust me once they realize how bad blizzlike pop will be, their minds will change but at that point it'll be too late. 
---
I'm speaking from recent experience, you guys are speaking from a 14 year old experience were Wow was a constantly growing game, trust me that classic is NOT going to be a growing game. It'll start huge and slowly fall off. That's why you need high pop.
---
It was 1.12 when the new tier2 models came iiro. Dont worry you have plenty of time to get t2 m8 😊
---
Thanks for this comment! We will keep the posts with flame baiting retail in mind. Typically, we remove these under rule 2 because bashing retail adds zero value to the Classic conversation.
---
I read the Vestments are BiS until AQ.  Seems like it's worth it to take tailoring just for that. 
---
Not sure about relearning a new profession after that.  PITA and gold lol. Maybe I'll hang on to tailoring for BC!
---
stop making me hyped. I'm already dying
---
&gt; And I think a lot more people are anti alliance at this point.
---
Hooray!
---
&gt; Below are featured various planned changes
---
No changes!
---
Pretty sure they're using the 1.12 version of all items
---
Those players are going to be full guilds of no-lifers - better geared, epic mounts, full PvP consumables - you guys don't know what you're in for.
---
The most popular private servers are 1x, blizzlike servers, including loot and patch content. You have no idea what you're talking about. The 2x-3x leveling XP servers are always much less populated than the blizzlike ones.
---
Nah, just don't want to be bothered. I played back in 2004 on PvP server and stayed there until Wrath was done then stopped playing. I was old then so this time around I wanna just enjoy myself and not be bothered by the inevitable camping and all the other bs that distracts me from my favorite facet of the game. I will however run BGs cause I really enjoy them.
---
Atm, I have no plans on adding dungeons to the sheet. I might consider adding the lvl 55+ dungeons in the future but for now I will let it be only raids.
---
Sharding is a horrible way to address it but yes I'm sure they will. People just don't understand the game is much different and have no idea what they're in for come Phase 2. Yeah they most likely have higher pop but that'll actually make it worse for servers with dominant guilds since they have to camp people even harder for honor.
---
The link you referenced he said it started out as a design then it later became a technical
---
So yeah.. it's both.
---
[deleted]
---
Because the most important thing is how the game FEELS rather than what the exact numbers are.
---
Excel? I think he looks a lot more experienced than Excel.
---
So, for the pvp boiz, do we have to farm MC in order to gear up for pvp in a first place???
---
Yeah agreed. I'm sure this is what will happen once all the people here applauding the decision literally can't do anything in 50+ zones. These guys all haven't played since '05 - a lot of the rankers have been on private servers for years and will: be better players generally, level faster, have better gear, epic mounts asap and full PvP consumables + engineering items at all times. Will not be fun at all for 99% of people.
---
Call for help!

I would recommend herb/alch if you were to change, so you can make your own consumables. It honestly only takes a couple of days running around getting the herbs. But you could just level herb alongside tailoring and then get a guildie to make them for you. If you believe TBC is going to be a thing then yes hold onto tailoring!
---
Yes BiS til AQ is correct, especially if you’re only going for 3/8 t2 instead of 8/8.
---
Yup. They really should be in the game. Not having guild banks heavily encourages account sharing.
---
If the game basically forces you to break its TOS to run a guild somewhat efficiently something's very wrong.
---
&gt; just thinking/knowing that pandaria and the wondering isles are out there, somewhere. and excatly where to broken isle's are , ect  
---
Thinking about retail trash is the last thing I'll be doing when I'm playing Classic.
---
It's not a technical challenge at all. It's about community and how the game is portrayed. It's weird to start up wow and there's difference progression on servers difference patch dates etc. It's very confusing.
---
Nice one mate
---
It promotes account sharing = breaking TOS more than anything.
---
Either this guy is a troll or he's a colossal douchebag who has no idea how few people a month will be getting their pvp stuff. I'd actually love to see the maths on just how many people you'd have to kill in world pvp to hit rank 14, specially considering the fact the honor rate for each person drops after every successive kill.
---
Any predictions on how long between phases?
---
It was patch 1.9
---
Cool thanks.
---
Oh i know I've got plenty of time, it's just going to be tough getting to raid status. I've been playing on a private server as a sort of "test run" solo rogue at early levels isnt easy. I made a NE hunters for the nostalgia (first toon I made back in 04) WAY easier getting those dings compared to the rogue
---
I mean, when I said "nobody" I was being hyperbolic. But even the warrior class designer stated that the vast majority of warrior dps in vanilla we're arms...
---
I think I might be insane wanting to roll PvP but that's classic for me I think I need figure out some realistic goals and find a friendly UK guild
---
I would quite frankly be astonished if we didn't get at least 1 rp-pvp
---
I've played on private servers for years and I understand the repercussions of this decision better than most people on this subreddit do. The game has gotten so min/max after 14 years that 99% of people cheering on this decision are going to change their mind 1 week after Phase 2 launch when dominant guilds on their server camp them for 30+ minutes until they receive no more honor for the kills.
---
These people generally have been on private servers for years and will be: generally better at the game, level faster, have better gear, have epic mount asap and full pvp &amp; engineering consumables very early on. 95% of the server will not be able to compete with that and get steamrolled in World PvP, even if they have a numbers advantage.
---
Can he get an Amen?!
---
AMEN
---
I got you fam
---
I think the decision of making rp-pvp of not is wholly dependent on the interest Blizz actually expects Classic to get. I mean if we have 500k subs then creating rp pvp would be no big deal. But if we're at like 5 populated servers total then its tough to justify.
---
No horde guild is going to give CTS to a warrior over a rogue. Ever.
---
I could really go for some bare asses.
---
Yeah, a megathread every now and then shouldn't hurt.
---
Nope. By later he means much later, as in not vanilla. He confirmed at a different time that the cap they chose was roughly 2500 but the hardware could handle as much as 4000, which it never did because it went against the design.
---
Keep your private server #changes out of Classic ok.
---
I raided as a combat dagger dwarf rogue and was perfectly competitive against sword rogues. Not conpeting for weapons with other rogues and fury warriors is pretty nice too
---
Yeah, since the ranking system will be introduced in Phase 2, it would probably be in your best interest to run MC, and even BWL a bit to get an edge over others.
---
&gt;unless your definition of lowbie is a level 48+.
---
How is someone 11 levels below you not a lowbie?
---
&gt;Second we don’t know the time frame for Phase 3 yet.
---
Considering blizzlike release dates, phase 1 to 2 will be fairly fast, and 2 to 3 will be long. Either way, if phase 2 to 3 is less than 3 months which is very unlikely, you will see with AQ gear before BWL is out. Even then, having AQ gear while BWL is out isn't fair either.
---
&gt;how long it would take to get to that gear and no one is going to be rocking Rank 14 before BWL
---
It's really besides the point. The gear was never supposed to be this strong, it will be with this patch cycle.
---
I agree. It's important that it feels exactly like it did in 2005 and the authentic server sizes are one of the most important contributors to that feeling.
---
I will be doing the quest line after I get to max level.
---
I’m guessing it’ll be based on Blizzard’s opinion. My prediction: We’ll move to phase 2 around 4 months after the first Rag kill. (Unless that happens within the first month or two)
---
I don't think they should announce it way in advance. Just drop patch notes and go.
---
I found my people
---
Uh... people raid Hillsbrad on PvE servers.
---
I'm in the same boat.
---
Having kids makes playing WoW a lot different.   Hardcore raiding is right out.
---
On the good side, if you group with other parents, they are much more understanding when you send a message saying "Kid just woke up, be back as soon as possible"
---
A lot of popular streamers play alliance such as asmobgold and Esfrand. A lot of their followers will be joining suit
---
It's hilarious how the casuals on this subreddit are talking about how this isn't a big deal and that it's super hard to get R14.
---
Meanwhile these will be the same players roflstomped by rankers for 3 months and then those same rankers will have full BiS for a tier that's 1-2 above the normal players.
---
Private server quest experience (on the most popular vanilla server at least) was exactly the same when quests were tested on the demo. The 3 day and change run was legit, albeit not on official servers.
---
Except that having 2500 caps servers the population will be 1k when AQ comes out, which is anything but blizzlike.
---
We don't know yet
---
I hope phase 1 lasts a long time so people can level and do MC/Ony for a while
---
There's always going to be people crying for more content, but vanilla restart really isn't about providing content but enjoying and reliving old content
---
I’ve heard MC gear is enough for Shamans to start doing well as ele. What about the AQ40 gear allows shaman to wreck that much harder? Obviously AQ40 gear will be hard to get as an offspec.
---
The pvp rewards are on the level of AQ gear when you get up to HWL/GM and will be released a phase before even BWL.
---
If you're in a hardcore guild, there will be no option except to spend your time mass camping anything you can find that's worth honor (flight point camping will be the norm). Which means it will affect everyone else on the server a lot too when they run into the 20hr/day crews.
---
You're essentially skipping almost two tiers in a number of slots, including *weapon*. Warriors are going to be nuts.
---
&gt; Actual average player will be in the 8-12 day range.
---
I think it'd be more fair to say that the average player *who is trying to level quickly* will be in the 8-12 day range. I guarantee there will be a ton of people who intentionally take it slow; doing dungeons, battlegrounds, world pvp, maybe some role playing etc. I'd imagine the real average would be more like 15-20 days, to be honest.
---
The run was done by Critten aka Journey, on a 10k pop realm so significantly larger than any blizzard server ever was. XP values are correct on quests per testing on the Classic demo, the XP values matched up with the most popular vanilla private server. Dynamic Respawn was only on in the starter zones, saved him maybe 10 minutes at most.
---
Only time will tell. All I know is that if the server ain't PvE, it ain't for me
---
Dude yes. First time on a vanilla server a 30ish ally comes into Tarren mill and like 5 of us lvl 20ish banded together to take him out.
---
Best day ever.
---
Health wise? Yeah they're terrible. But I do enjoy myself a sugar free red bull once in a blue moon. It's a nice taste of tart.
---
I've been enjoying G Fuel the last several months, personally. No added sugars and it has ~160mg of caffeine per drink, which is generally more than what red bull and monster provides and just about on par with genuine coffee.
---
The N-word
---
I dont think so. Seems like they still have a lot to figure out, as they usually have spent one week or more per issue, and there are still couple bigger questions to be answered. Could be before end of april.
---
I mean really, with 40 people how often is it actually you?
---
Until it's you, and you feel like an asshole lol
---

Omg #nochanges!
---
Moms from Presque Isle so Ive been in that area a few times and its always awesome, but Idk if I could live there cause there was never any internet hahaha. This was also like 7+ years ago lol
---
Just because it's incredibly hard to get that doesn't mean the gear should be incredibly overpowered way way more than it ever was in vanilla.
---
Alliance was favored in the beginning, all the young teens picked night elf hunters so they could be legolas and pallies were really good for raiding
---
It'll probably be a bit more even this time around.
---
It really depends if they decide to do some small balance passes
---
You have that little faith in the game? Even if that were to happen there are ways to solve that problem without changing the entire game.
---
&gt; No one participates in the honor grind before 60
---
Are you familliar with the honor system? If the game starts off with it, the players who level the fastest have an advantage of being able to hit rank 14 pretty early on with little effort. It's a weekly system, and every week where you aren't level 60, you're missing out on ranking points. Having that being drilled into the heads of people who want to level probably wouldn't make it fun for casusals. PLUS, tryhards would rush to 60 then camp level 51-59 questing areas for ez kills and ez honor, thus making the grind to 60 from 50 incredibly frustrating
---
Original phase lengths as in the content release schedule from 2005?
---
You weren’t confused when ND launched and you rushed to 60!
---
retail bad
---
If you want to be a non-healer spec as a hybrid, you're going to have to hustle for gear and become valuable to your raid group. It can be done, but you have to git gud.
---
It takes min 12 weeks to get R14, how long exactly do you think it p2 to 3 will be?
---
Also the blue set is on pair with AQ gear what the fuck are you talking about?
---
Warrior: R12 legs are best in slot until 1.10
---
R10 chest + shoulder is best in slot until AQ40
---
Mage: r10 2piece is BiS until you get absolute full AQ40 bis, most won't get this, so people can use r10 set in naxx
---
Warlock: BiS until several T2.5 pieces.
---
Hunter: BiS until full T1 or T2 
---
Those are the ones I know for sure.
---
I think most people in their 30's are considered millennials
---
&gt; PvP realms will be 60% of the total population
---
makes sense, although it could be sample bias because of dedication to the game to read about it/talk about it before release 
---
&gt;Jesus the amount of bandwagoning in this sub is unbearable
---
a fair criticism
---
&gt;Just play PvP like the rest of us, Jesus
---
what about bandwagoning?

Oh no, I mean I was the asshole yelling on vent to loot the motherfucking dogs!
---
Yes it's bis til bwl and I never seen archivist if healing drop. I made thousands of gold off crusader orbs running strat live for that damn cape. It's not even much better than hide of the wild. I recommend maybe farming truefaith and if u get truefaith but no archivist of healing, then just make a hide of the wild.
---
Thursday is dedicated to 8.2 and their plans for “fixing” certain things and an overall content preview. I don’t expect, and would t want, them to detract from that with Classic news.
---
This crap literally affects no one all it does is give those hardcore douchebags something to be happy about that HWL or GM again. And for the all the 1.12 items were supposed to be getting it just gives those who never experienced vanilla a fighting chance. If not for that then you’d see a lot of real huntards with spirit stacked gear just waiting around a year to be awesome. The high ranks also will be very limited and if you get one of those guys in your guild he needs nothing from all the raids and you get one less roll to deal with. Stop bitching over making wow exactly as it was things have changed and a shit ton of people have grown up. Lastly if you do bitch then you basically gonna fall into that no lifer category anyway. All I personally want is a damn liking challenge so give me those damn fucked up ganks and give the real unbalance back to WOW. 
---
For the alliance!!!!!!!!
---
ilvl matters less in vanilla because itemization is a lot different. Some specs like different things, it's not just about mainstat anymore, you have things like +armor and fire resist and mana regen and +spell/heal and +hit/crit and all types of item effects that change it up.
---
Unless you're in a min/max guild pushing for world first you shouldn't worry about it.
---
Vanilla content is easier and people know how to play now, if you find out the guild you joined is anal just join a different one
---
I'm a sucker for infographics!  Classic WoW infographics?  Sign me up!

What is wrong with having servers with higher population caps if they also have the option for "authentic" 2.5k servers?

Do you really think Blizzard can't implement High/Med/Low pop servers?

First time this meme gave me a laugh. ggwp
---
**PETITION**: Rule 8 - All subreddit posters must pretend (or "*roleplay*") that ClassicWoW is a brand new video game they've never played before. The launch of the ClassicWoW server must be treated as if it was the original 2004 launch.
---
My suggestion would be to bump all the existing rules down one and make this #1. Please also use the threat of an immediate and incontestable ban if this rule is not followed.
---
Reply "SIGNED" if you agree with this petition.
---
It's a bit different though, LB was done for. It had progressed to 1.12 there was no more to come, no more updates.
---
Imagine blizzard doing an update for 3 different levels of servers, "for stormraider kel'thuzard and other generic server name, you will now be phase 3, okay back to x, y, c you are now phase 2". It would be quite confusing.
---
Though a never ending cycle of fresh servers does sound appealing to me :D
---
There have been some streamers that primarily play shooters who have expressed interest in streaming Classic. Summit1g would be one such streamer. He watched the Classic WoW announcement on his stream and said something along the lines of "Hell yeah I'd play that." Whether streamers like him actually do play/stream it for any length of time remains to be seen.

True, I didn't expect to come off that way. I just thought saying it was against the ToS was lulz worthy.
---
Would be interesting to see if there's a correlation between "nochanges" and fundamentalism of some sort.
---
It's not about having faith in the game. The problem is that everyone interested already knows about classic, and everyone will be on at launch, this means there's very little room to grow, but players will quit.
---
What exactly do you purpose to solve low pop at end stages? Server merges? I'd pref higher cap early myself. I don't see any significant negatives about high pop, the only people I do either haven't tired it or had really bad experience from some shite pserver.
---
Subpar bait 4/10
---
Oh my goodness, it would be of hysterical proportions.
---
Heals. I think im rolling a lock tho.
---
Hell nah, please not that shit again. If I'm wearing full tier, I wanna at least look good.
---
I would just get hide of the wild, with 1.12 the recipe for truefaith will be boe and you won't have to farm live strat as much, and tbh hotw isn't that expensive maybe like 100g and it will prove to guilds you're investing into ur char
---
I never thought I'd find someone who used the trackpad to play like I used to
---
People that ask for a summon when they're closer than the lock
---
This is the type of phone I would use to call myself in the past.
---
You realize if more than zero people have god-tier gear, it’s an issue, right? It’s not just R14, it’s 12-14. I shouldn’t ever have to fight someone in that quality of gear when that gear wouldn’t be what it is until *literally one patch AFTER AQ.* 
---
Idk why it takes more than 80 iq to see this. 
---
Yeah, nolifers having access to AQ40/Naxx+ gear  in Late MC/early BWL, as opposed to having it during mid-AQ is a problem.
---
Oh darn, thanks for the heads-up.  I didnt know that.
---
self-proclaimed "more-than-above-average player" over here, we got a badass here guys!  And he is worried about no-lifers!
---
Good to know. I find myself doubting if what I know is from vanilla or from a private servers. I'm hoping more it's different from what I remember than I'm expecting.
---
Lol, y i k e s, Bernie boy opinions.
---
I hope the time between 3 and 4 is like a year. I want to relive the experience of finally getting HWL, only to realize I can't do anything against people who have been farming BWL for months. Delicious futility is the perfect aftertaste to a system that promotes an unhealthy lifestyle.
---
Lol it was a design decision in Vanilla because the game was designed around low pop turning into high pop, so empty servers would naturally fill up. He said its all about communities. Its easier on a medium pop server where you know most people than a high pop where you are irrelevant, or no pop where there are no communities.
---
Except this time with Classic the servers have to be designed around 80-90% of the population leaving in the first 6 months. Saying "durr it wasn't like that in 2005" is stupid and completely non applicable 15 years later.

Because you can just as easily use your unarmored Lv 40 mount for roleplay. You'll be walking anyways, so speed percentage doesn't matter. In addition, the unarmored mounts are a valuable tribute to dedicated players who have played since the beginning, and that value only increases as time goes on. To let anyone have it diminishes its value to the base gold price, which is comparatively zero when compared to any other vendor-bought mount.
---
Nobody is going to have quintessence on the first entry into MC. There's 2 quests that require killing stuff inside the raid before you get it. So while you can get it after you start, the earliest someone can have it is after having cleared 7 bosses.

Talent respecs are enough of a gold sink IMHO.

As far as I know no one else really wants the set. So I don't remember 2.5 being hard for a shaman to get. That being said it's not one specific thing. It's that gear is what makes you reach a tipping point. Before you have that level of HP, Crit and, Armor it is very hard to solo any one. I am not sure if you have ever played a shaman in classic but at early gear scores. You are frequently sacrificing something to hit the stats you need to work. Normally that sacrifice is armor. Which is why you struggle in pvp as anything but a support that stands in the way back, before AQ40.
---
30 seconds, and yes it's on pservers too.
---
People either wait for people afk on fp(they usually are) or CC you until the 30 seconds are over. And the flight master will be dead so no escaping there.
---
People just say camping FP's because that's where people are, it's not neccesarily killing you as soon as you land.
---
Dissertation is the English word unless I’m understanding wrong.

People never camped flightpaths in classic, this retarded PVP system is whats ruining the spirit of classic.
---
If you wanted a battleground there was almost always a back and forth battle in Hillsbrad Foothills. We survived not having battlegrounds before, we can do it again.

---
Also archivist cape of healing is like one in a million. Not worth going for.
---
Very first mind, what
---
I’ll bite for a second and just say this. I personally couldn’t care if someone has better gear than me. If they do I’d just call up a couple of friends to kill them with. You also seem to throw around 80iq insults in every post without realising you seem to be the only person here terrified of fighting people with better gear. Could it be per chance you suck at pvp and being an obvious drop kick have no friends who’ll help out if needed? As the saying goes git gud scrub.
---
Holy crap man. Dont talk about people like that.
---
&gt; You realize that’s still really fucking bad, right?
---
Its really fucking not.... This isn't retail with 10 man content. 40 man raids across a dozen guilds per server horde and ally. A couple folks who no life 3 months having a momentary edge in gear for BWL of all places isnt a big deal at all.
---
And how about quest item drop chances? Those aren't same, what about item procs? All those things add together and change the circumstances. It's simple, it's just not the same game, you really can't argue about that.
---
nice
---
Yeah I’m going through his post history as well, cake across this. Dudes clearly a virgin incel troll, dudes fucking yikes to say the least.
---
[Seen in yesterday's news post,](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/classic-pvp-content-plan/146049) it's the phase where the Honor system is implemented but battlegrounds won't be in the game yet.
---
That was way before 1.12 and will probably not work on classic servers
---
You did not live anything. What he is talking about never happened in any form in vanilla. It has only happened on pservers.
---
Heya! I played a priest for all of my time on a pserver and the robes are really nice for the time until you get to the point where you have a fair bit of T2 and can snag the Nef chest. All in all, I don’t think it’s hugely important and I skipped it and still performed pretty well in relation to the healers with it. 
---
If you would really like two other professions, I wouldn’t sweat not having tailoring. I found that having herbalism was huge for grinding out consumables. Best of luck in classic!
---
In a duel? No. If we don't count WotF The only thing that beats a (1.12) warlock in duels is an insanely well-geared and well-prepared rogue. We pretty much stomp everything else. Warlocks excel at duels and small-scale word PvP.
---
In organized group PvP it's more of a mixed bag. That's where the lack of mobility and defensive CDs really sucks. If you don't have soul link you will be popped like a zit. If you do have soul link you're basically just a turret and can be shut down by any melee class, thereby turning you into a mana sink for your healer.
---
Yeah that would be sick
---
Same though mate I work three full time jobs and spend every other waking moment in the gym getting gains
---
No like Mark Kern said on ClassiCast they decided on a server size that was the perfect size to foster server communities. That cap was roughly 2500 concurrent players. It had nothing to do with sub growth, they didn't even think that they were going to get 1 million players.
---
Healers usually hang back. If you run up on a new spot then the tank and melee dps will get there first.
---
AoE tanking phase 1 Nefarian adds (at least on Alliance, Pally buffs help a ton) &amp; Twin Emps made putting up with the boring raiding worth it.
---
&gt; Do you really think Blizzard can't implement High/Med/Low pop servers?
---
They already did. High = server that have 2500 players online around the clock.
---
You could not be more wrong, warlocks are very gear dependent, both in pve and pvp. In pve they need more hit than other casters, because they dont get hit for shadow bolt as a talent. 
---
And you need good gear for pvp, both as SL or full destro.
---
Why would you travel to the other side of the world to level in the undead starting zone? Shamans nearest trainer is in Swamp of Sorrows, and that's a helluva run for a 1-15 toon. Here's a tip: Don't.
---
No dude people won’t have r14 weapons to progress through the epic raid known as bwl. It’s totally fine /s
---
It may not seem like it, but IMO Classic is actually way more enjoyable for a casual player than retail tends to be. Yeah, you won't get tons of epics and won't get to see Naxx, but you do get to experience challenging content, make friends, and really earn your rewards. 
---
Retail has a weird dichotomy where you get 85% of your maximum power almost for free, and then you essentially have to play hardcore to advance further. There's no useful content for "casual guilds" to even do. Everything is designed for PUGs or elitists.
---
😎🍆🤛😩🤜🍆💦💦💦
---
Exactly this. 
---
I thought breaking it down would make it easier for the casuals to comprehend. The problem is that they think at a surface level. They see “honor system, phase 2 where’s there’s no BGs” and think organic WPvP is incentivized and the world will be lively with death squads traveling all over. 
---
They don’t realize that ranking is down to a science and the most efficient honor/hr comes from camping hot flight paths and going for every 48-59 in sight when moving around. And then after destroying level 50s for 3 months, they AQ40/Naxx gear, while the normal people have full MC gear. 3 set for a lot of classes being BiS for PvP for the entire game. 
---
I know there’s some Mn video somewhere of him doing exactly this. Maybe that’s what the casuals need to see. But, I fear that due to the casual’s affection towards this decision will lead to this sticking.
---
What I hate the absolute most about the new BFD (which came out in WoD, just to be pedantic) is it’s entirely casual use of the Old Gods.
---
Even today, the Old Gods at least try to be subtle, at least until you fight them personally. Moreso in Vanilla when they were much deeper in the background. The new BFD, however, has them literally speaking to you. Not in a creepy manipulation kind of way like they normally do, but full on Dr. Claw “We’ll get you next time!”
---
Here’s a literal quote from the instance:
---
&gt;Savor this victory, mortal. Now that you’ve heard our whispers, it is only a matter of time until you belong to us.
---
I know the Old Gods were never a *perfect* mirror of Lovecraft, and especially so now, but that line takes the ridiculousness to new levels.
---
For me, as lame as it sounds this was also part of the fun. I never felt the need to be the absolute best of the best, but I loved the idea that some people were far and away the best.
---
It helped create lore and stories and people could actually have some meaning within their servers.

---
You’re right, my only experience in vanilla was getting my rogue up to level 23 before BC came out lol.
---
Ah that makes sense, thanks for taking time to explain! So for a semi-casual-leaning-casual player that wants to raid as a healer and PvP as either healer or hybrid, a hybrid Shaman would likely be too time consuming to gear properly?

If they see someone else go up to the node but attract aggro , then take it themselves wile the other guy is fighting off mobs, that's already a douche move. Next step up the douche ladder is ninja looting, and that's just not a good risk to take.
---
But theres never a time you'll be attacking someone standing still using no skills with a warrior who wont be using skills. 
---
If we use your assumption then no they dont do the same damage because the warrior has more melee attack power. Agi gives 1 ranged attack power, strength gives 2 melee attack power.
---
This question was just about if all was equal and a hunter and warrior swung the same weapon, would it do the same damage?
---
aaaand for the gold to buy it
---
there aren't epic battles, because the people doing the pvping will hunt in groups of 5 looking for 1-2 people leveling to prey on and avoid those groups of people trying to do the same.
---
What do you guys think will be the usual length of time between each phase of content? And what’s the plan for after Naxx?
---
It sucks we have to wait so long for AB
---
Wow, that sounds really interesting and I'll need to give that a try now!  Never thought of that as being viable, but certainly while leveling it makes a lot of sense.  I'm trying a warrior out on pserver now and just imagining what recovery in between fights would look like.  "of the Whale/Eagle" gear here I come!

BWL is phase 3 though.
---
I’ve heard 13 &amp; 14 are really tough. My buddy had a really incredible wsg team and I think they had a lot of fun playing together which was why his grind to 13 wasn’t bad, but it was certainly enough that he told me he had no interest in going to 14.
---
You quoted one sentence to take it out of context, nice.  I get that you're sad... just keep waiting though!
---
If they play on a PVE server sure.
---
If they play on a pvp server well.. Just ask lezonta how his scarab lord went.
---
Because people know what the reward is this time around, we’re not going to see multiple guilds working together just to have the gates open. Sad, but you are spot on about this.
---
There are going to be multiple people with 1.12 rank 12, 13, and 14 gear before BWL that wont be replaced until the last phase in Naxx........ Madness. I'm ranking for sure.
---
I know people in rural areas where their two options are dialup and in theory satellite but that is even less viable for gaming.
---
That is for sure the plan. I have a few friends I’ll be playing with and we are going to build a team. We had a pretty good run at arena and rbg ratings so hopefully we can bring that coordination to classic.
---
Are they using better methods? I see no proof.
---
SS is a reliable way to farm honor, and premades/high levels would do well there.
---
I suppose.  I was just thinking a naked hunter still has a pet tho. It would be like a warrior fighting with only 1 arm.
---
I started at the beginning; and ironically quit after Wotlk because I personally thought the game had changed so much I wasn’t enjoying it anymore.  
---
That being said; you may not enjoy Vanilla.   We look back at it with rose colored glasses, but it had some real issues that players today would probably think are insane.  
---
If you wanted to do endgame; you had to get into an endgame guild.  Usually there were only a couple per server, and they were difficult to get into.   If you got into one; your life was raiding.  If I wasn’t at work or school I was raiding or farming mats for raiding.  Raid night were 3-5 days a week, 6+ hours at a time.  Dropping out was not an option.  We’d have 40 people stuck in a dungeon till 3am sometimes, and no one would/could leave until the officers called it.  
---
The pvp honor system was even worse.  The top players were known to be two people playing one account, playing 24 hours a day.  Maybe logging off for 4 hours to keep it from being obvious.  
---
I can also think of a lot of other positives that may not be positives anymore now that everyone is so... hardened and experienced.  
---
I remember right before tbc, things were actually dying.  People were getting bored and/or tired of the grind.  I remember just standing around town for hours.  For no reason...  or wandering around “exploring”, which now has lost its mystery.  
---
I still think you should play it.  Just don’t be surprised when you find an old outdated game with an endgame grind only a teenager can fit into their life. 
---
I also have fond memories of it. But it was because it was new, and we were all clueless idiots. And partly because I was in one of those top guilds; being treated like a celebrity by 80% of other players for having high tier gear.
---
that means you didnt use enough resources and were coasting at a speed slow enough to let your mana regen to full instead of using resources at a rate equal to their regen rate.
---
Awl dem durgons.
---
Not to mention all the other outdoor content you have to complete, some with 10+ people raids.
---
They are limited yes, but it's not really something that comes into place in pvp, especially not when it's 16 debuffs which blizzard wants to have from the start.
---
As for multiple debuffs, you can have multiple corruptions and other dots on the same time, they each count for 1 debuff slot. As for non-dot debuffs you can only have one on. Also fun fact you can only have 1 version of HoT's on a player at the time, which is a big reason why the optimal setup is having only 1 druid.
---
What pre bis gear would it take for a priest to do well in PvP?
---
Hoo - well good to know that this kind of minutia needs to be discussed and agreed upon prior.
---
That's that part with PVP. If you are a big shot streamer or some shit you are gonna get griefed HARD. So on a pvp server I don't see it possible unless if they do it in secret at 4am in the morning or some shit.
---
This quest chain is one of the most toxic quest chains... lol was sooo hard and took sooo long i couldn't bother.. i rather dance naked in IF be my guest... lol
---
Yes the melee range is extended a touch. And is it easier for you to click on a big thing or a little thing? Seems simple to me
---
You won’t be R14 by BWL, most likely
---
Epic gear is pretty rare if you think about it because you might be /rolling against 7 warriors for an item, right? That plus the fact that the raid gear from every raid is strong makes it so you would want to run EVERY available raid every week, as opposed to later expansions where you only raid one tier. Every piece of gear and every consumable makes a difference in your preparation for a raid. Tier 2 gear is really good for some classes but your pre-aq40 bis might not fare super well on the 4 horsemen or kt (the hardest in vanilla) fights. Pvp gear is also quite good, especially if they have the 1.12 version rank 14 weapons from the beginning. It would take you 4-5 months to hit rank 14 but that weapon would carry you in pvp or pve all the way to nax until you start rolling on mights of menethil. At that point, a geared-ass warrior is gonna be two-shotting in pvp, so bis/near bis is rly rly strong. 
---
As far as gearscore is concerned, I always tell people that it wouldn't really be that useful. Ilvl means nothing and, while you could use it to compare two people's stats, it's not gonna tell you who's the best choice to take. A raid leader is either stupid and bad because they only take 6000 gearscore players or they are good and smart enough to know better than the add-on and I bet the better raid leader would fare better taking a poorly geared warrior that just hit 60 than the other raid leader would by taking a decently geared ret pally. Plus, the best "pugs" to join are actually guild runs that just need to fill that last couple of spots, and in that situation 1) social skills and just knowing people on the server will help you a lot and 2) for mc, ony and 20 man raids especially, they are just looking to fill the raid, not to get a godmode hyperdps so they might look at u to make sure ur not an idiot but that's about it. Lastly, I'd say that inspecting a person will tell you way more about them than gearscore.
---
I think context is important though. Casual by the standards of 2005 when it was competing with MMOs like EQ is different than today.
---
I was leading raids at 15. I'm 26 now and it blows my mind that there were people who were this age being ordered around by a child. I don't think I was particularly good at it either.
---
Yes, I'm intimately familiar with the honor system as a former rank 13 Druid.  Implementing the honor system from the beginning will encourage not only leveling quickly on pvp servers, but active hampering of opposite faction leveling.  I'm a huge fan of any system with incentivizes world pvp as it is by far the best aspect of wow.
---
What do item procs have to do with speed leveling? No one going to 60 in 3-4 days played at the fresh launch of a server has any item proccing stuff.
---
You don't think these devs spent all this time making quest values correct but not the item drop rates do you? Trust me, some of the quests are awful and a lot of speed levelers skip them alltogether due to drop rates. If it isn't Blizzlike it's damn close, and not enough to drastically change the runs on Classic.
---
Can you explain to me how the existence of a 15k population cap server affects you if you also have the option of choosing a server with 2.5k population cap?
---
I wouldn't be against it but on the other hand we're here for classic. It's not a bad idea it's just not vanilla :)
---
[R13 Hunter](https://www.bilder-upload.eu/bild-9d5997-1554847034.jpg.html)  
---
It was a pain in the a55! I will never do this again. I did it mostly solo, just some days with premade group.   
---
You will ruin your fun of wow.   
---
Do go for r10 is great and absolutey doable, but more then 10 is very hard work.
---
Also, after this grind you have all the good items, you dont need to any raids..
---
Hahaha stop baiting him to his death
---
Claiming that it’s a disadvantage to play Tauren because they’re easier to target with your mouse. And people still keep on saying everyone in classic is gonna have their shit together and be good at the game.
---
Gonna be a wild ride boys
---
Jokes on you
---
If it takes you 20 days to level... you aren't trying to level. My first character, a Warrior, took me 11 days to level. I experienced as much as I could and wasted a *lot* of time trying to find dungeons, crafting, and exploring.
---
20 days is like... you spent 9 days in the Goldshire in ERPing.
---
I'm 22 and I guessed ice ice baby, googled it and it's correct
---
Your test is not old enough I think.
---
Yeah, yeah. It's just for speculation.
---
When they're 100% sure of the date and that it wont be delayed.
---
Well how easy is it for you to click on a gnome running around, compared to a big ass tauren.
---
I think the respawn timer was lowered to 2 hours.   
---
And the tip is to have a friend with you in a group, I know they can't assist. But that's also the point, if you can see that you are failing, have your friend attack the quest mob. Then a shade will spawn and kill you both, but the quest mob will not despawn.
---
Bro they just inspected you and if you had crap gear you didn't get to raid, sure it wasn't as plastic as a simple number but you definitely weren't doing bwl at lvl 58 in greens.
---
We arent talking about people killing the flight masters. We're talking about people waiting at the flight point and killing people as they come off.
---
Why would I ever want to be at a disadvantage when I shouldn’t be? Does that make sense to you? I shouldn’t ever, for any reason, have to fight someone who has AQ40/Naxx gear when I have MC gear? That does make sense right? 
---
You just said you would call up your buddies when you saw someone with this gear? Does that not make you the pussy who’s scared of people with this gear? I think you’re projecting. It’s not like I’m rolling a Warrior, anyway, where I would feel the most disadvantage as a result of the gear. 
---
The gear wasn’t good until after AQ (1.10), so the gear shouldn’t be good until after AQ. It’s really that simple, honest.
---
Summer, so around 2 - 5 months from now
---
Plus if you just stay on longer and grind through the slog people with jobs/school/etc will eventually log off and it lessens the competition and you pull ahead.
---
As for that, I think it's important to have gold sinks, and mounts are on of the biggest. You'd have to change how something else about the game to match it. And obviously I want this thing to be unique per character no accountwide BS.
---
Troll tempers or whatever they're called in ZF comes to mind. But maybe the dropprate on pservers is off.
---
Alright stop.
---
You just don’t have the brain capacity to understand this. 
---
If the gear wasn’t good until after AQ (1.10), literally AFTER AQ40. Then the gear shouldn’t be good until after AQ40. It’s really that simple, honest.
---
Interesting. Good tip. I also heard that if you have a hunter with you who knows what they're doing they can do the kill for you and you can loot the quest item. I see this as cheating yourself out of a challenge though.
---
It’s so incredibly easy. It’s so easy I’d never, ever, thought I’d see the day someone claimed targeting players in WoW was even remotely difficult. It doesn’t even register on a scale.
---
Dude I’m surprised you can even type. Please don’t drive or operate any machinery capable of bodily harm.
---
I don't know if i'd consider devouring plague to just be a "meh" dot.
---
I used to love healing. I started playing as DPS and since I was a noob and didn't understand what goes into doing great dps, I got bored of it since "you're just doing your rotation all night". 
---
After that I switched to healer and loved it because it was instantly a challenge. However, after about two years I started getting really into the game and started being competitive. And being a competitive healer doesn't exactly work because a) in order to do incredible healing you have to actively fuck over the other healers, and b) because as you play with better people, they make less mistakes and require less healing. When I first started healing it wasn't a challenge because it's hard, it was a challenge because the people I was playing with were bad and took excess amounts of avoidable damage.
---
Since then I've switched to DPS and never looked back. When you do incredible healing, it's because the raid made a lot of mistakes and you sniped everyone else out of doing any healing. When you do incredible damage, it's because you prepared and played well. It's so much more satisfying.
---
Get off your high horse. It's about comparison. Yes they're both easy to click on. It's easier to click on something bigger than it is to click on something smaller. It's super fucking simple how do you not get the question he asked. It's retardedly simple
---
The honor system works by ranking players in your faction relative to each other. Who gets most honor gets best rank. Nobody wants to camp random players and I mean to the extent that is expected in this system, it's entirely new dimension of camping that was never experienced in retail vanilla in the slightest.
---
However, since it's the best way, and with honor system the best way is literally the only way, it will happen and possibly even kill the game.
---
Part of the charm is the grind.  One of my best memories was grinding for my 40 mount.  
---
Besides grinding for your mount IS the achievement.  Especially if you go for another factions mount.  Getting exalted is not easy.
---
Free mounts for almost no work, retail has enough of that.
---
Private server host was on classic cast and said flight path camping was a popular thing to do. And tips out said many people are concerned so that's why I made the post in the first place. Just to come up with ideas but it appears everyone wants to be dickheads instead.
---
Sorry I don't know the full lyrics
---
 take a step and listen?
---
I'm with you man. We do need a solution.
---
Where do I find that wallpaper?
---
I can’t find the link to verify this but I was aware it was in the game but had a different outcome not the squelch. Still we can get info on that sort of stuff after a release date or even bundled in maybe some form of release presentation?
---
Actually that was the wrong part of information to fill in if you wanted to be helpful, as its very common knowledge that fear ward was made baseline(and it was only mentioned 4 comments above). But did dwarfs get anything else unique in return?
---
Flight point camping probably won't be that good, depending on certain variables. For one thing, the "honorless target" debuff did exist in vanilla, and plus u would only be camping 50+ zones anyway. 
---
Secondly, it takes months to get rank 14 and phase 2 will end (causing bgs to take over as highest honor per unit time) long before you get your first epic pvp gear piece. 
---
Thirdly, after bgs do come out, there might still be fp camping due to faction imbalance (farm some honor between bg queue pops), but who knows how common it will be and it is just something you sign up for when you create a character on a pvp realm. You could always play on a pve realm or, better yet, call in your allies for some help and create some pvp :)
---
It seems like these are the big ones left. A lot we could find out from a beta possibly. 
---
We may not find out server cap until blizzard find out how many players will return/stay after launch
---
Funny how the incredibly obvious fact of "big cow man is easier to click than tiny gnome" triggered you so hard, for some reason.
---
Why are you clicking at all, use tab
---
*Definitely not work
---
"your comment is not helpful!!"
---
Neither is yours. Blocked.
---
The true hidden disadvantage is that being a Tauren can be annoying indoors or in caves and such. Time for first person mode!
---
My old mouse broke in late 2005 iirc. It was raid night, so I rushed to the local tech store and bought the best mouse I could find. It happened to be the mx518. Changed/Udated PC three times in the last 14years and played tons of hours (way to many ...no more WoW though). But I am using my mx518 till this day.  Plan on using it in future raids. Classic hype :-).
---
Collaborate and listen.
---
 10/10
---
One, you’re wrong. Source: Top rankers on PServers.
---
Two, you think Phase 2 will end in 2 months or less? Doubtful. 
---
Three, after BGs come out that’s how people will rank. 
---
You’re just not knowledgeable on how this has already happened on PServers and will be replicated in Classic. Listen to the top rankers.
---
You can grind the rep from elementals on silithus to get the quest for the trash mobs in MC. Then you go back to turn that in, get the quest to kill the naga bosses and be summoned back in. Then you douse a rune and head back to aszhara to get another quint and repeat that process till all runes are doused.
---
We can only assume as of right now.  
---
I personally think each phase is going to be 2-4 months long..hopefully in the 3.5 - 4 month period....even when the 4th month comes and some people feel they will be 'out of content', its not dragged on and can still continue at a good pace while others catch up.
---
They ganked Boromir, though.
---
if you say so.
---
It was a design decision to have a 2500 concurrent max back that, not technical.
---
Source: https://youtu.be/izCBaGfGJCg?t=2399
---
Even if I earned it wouldn't wear it. Such an ugly title. The mount's dope though.
---
Yes that is the issue. They are a very good class but, they aren't "finished" in classic. That doesn't mean they are bad to be clear. They are quite bad ass. It just means they have a metric shit ton of un-sanded edges which means they are not for everyone.
---
It's not that they take too much time. It's that the gear that has the stats they need. Specifically I mean Mail gear with the stats they need. Simply don't appear in the game until AQ40. If you have ever heard the term "clothadin" it applies here. So your time investment doesn't necessarily need to be bigger then a priest. It's just you will be waiting months for the gear to appear. Honestly if you want a shaman. I would level one as a second guy and consider moving to him later.
---
As far as what pre bis a priest needs at 60. Honestly I don't know. Mostly because I don't know what items will be in the game. When I played my priest I was walking into Nost a couple of content patches deep. That being said. I can tell you for certain. Shadow priest is uber strong with very little help. As a fresh 60 even in greens you will be one of the scariest classes. Shadow doesn't start to fall off in pvp at all until AQ40 gear. When it goes from notably OP to just in contention for biggest bad ass.
---
Because ganking people while screwing around in the open world is totally morally reprehensible in a game based on faction wars on a server designed for altercation. Get over yourself, good lord.

YASSSSSSS. Never thought I'd see the day that WSB and WOW are referenced in the same thread. Haupt91 forever..
---
I’m laughing my ass of picturing you people struggling to target players. This is actually vanilla all over again. 
---
So yeah, guess I’m #triggered and now I kinda have to roll a gnome
---
Yes, but I mean something more than "soon" would be nice. It would be good to know when they'll announce that release date, whether it's next week or next month so at least we know what to expect
---
I can *feel* this meme.  Always felt like a waste of mats when leveling my other characters who weren’t pursuing skinning.
---
Rags will be lucky to last a week.
---
It doesn't really come into play during 5mans either. 16 debuffs is a hell of a lot, yo.
---
Not right at launch, not cheap anyhow.
---
Just like how everyone's going to roll through all the raids week one, but everyone's going to gank me with rank 14 weapons. So many things wrong with this complaint.
---
Tab.
---
About 1.5 Alliance players per 1 Horde player.
---
If it was solely a design decision and not technical why did they continue to increase population caps despite the players becoming more and more concentrated in EPL and Silithus with the releases of AQ40 and Naxx?
---
Why did the significantly increase population cap in TBC despite those zones being significantly smaller and able to handle fewer people than Vanilla leveling zones? If 2,500 was a design decision only, shouldn't they have decreased population caps to be more in line with the smaller zones?
---
Are you going Alliance or Horde? Everything I've seen indicates that Ally locks will be a minority compared to Horde. So by being one you could be considered more desirable to bring it parties if there are indeed few. Supposedly there will be less because they don't want to fight horde with WOTF and tremor totems. Sounds dumb to me.
---
I’m worried about how a post-launch addition may upset the communities that start establishing themselves on RP servers from launch. 
---
This sub is obviously a self-selecting group, but the polls here have shown even more support for RP-PvP than standard RP servers. Haven’t kept close tabs on the official forums (work blocks that but not Reddit for some reason), but from what I’ve seen I wouldn’t be surprised if Blizzard changes their mind on the issue before launch.
---
It would be sweet if the did that then in like a year or two give you the option to move your character to a BC server
---
I hope its in 2months. I fucking hate end of summer releases.
---
Literally a clip of lotr
---
I feel your pain bro, if I had trouble targeting stuff I’d probably kill myself. Good luck tho

Priest is funky, since you’re the healer with two trees everyone takes you for granted, “of course he can tank a melee and keep himself and others alive and not go oom—he’s a priest.”
---
When a sham does the exact same thing—he’s a god. 
---
A sham is defined by his use of utility a priest by getting the heals out. Both work, but the sham looks a lot more flashy shocking, toteming, ghost wolfing, etc. the priest fears, heals, los’s, and heals.
---
Bc op wanted to know which was easier to CLICK on. We all use tab. I use tab, you use tab. Everyone tabs. But tabbing wasn't what op was asking.
---
If you level quick enough it won't be bad.
---
Also rants about modern politics in wchat and throws racial slurs at random people if they tag his mob
---
Now I really want a wow classic t-shirt. Anyone know of any? I'll try googling after work if I remember. :)
---
People will camp flight path camps insted of world pvp
---
A lot of people initially were on board with new leveling zones.  New and fresh content is always a promising content.
---
Of course, a large number of them were not as pleased once they'd actually played the new zones.
---
My first PC game was Diablo 2, you pressed hotkeys to switch to different abilities and mouse buttons to use them, you also pressed hotkeys to drink potions. So transitioning to WOW I found keybinding to just be more natural. Same with moving the camera, I was used to first person games like Half-Life/Morrowind/Oblivion/etc so keyboard turning was a completely foreign concept, still is.
---
I stand corrected then
---
5 days played is VERY, VERY fast (you also need warriors who tend to take longer lol), then you got to factor in sleep and its probably almost 7 days before anyone even gets to 60, someone probably gonna nolife in 5 1/2 IRL days.
---
No time to gear and also 35 - 40 people got to do this.
---
In short, no way he dies in a week.
---
Downvote and no response. 😂 80 iq brain wasn’t ready. 😂😂
---
If your group isn't retarded healing is the easiest role.  Keep tank selected and press a button every now and then. Don't even need to stop to drink. 
---
If you're a priest throw in some wand damage. Otherwise depending on the mobs throw in some melee damage or keep your range of needed. 
---
Now if your group is retarded then you'll be spamming heals and pots and drinking all the time. And that can get intense.
---
It will take at least 12 weeks to hit rank 14 and that's if you are bracket 1 (literally 1 person unless two or more people exactly tie in honor) every single week. Phase 2 will surely not last that long. This period lasted only 2 months in 2005. It will be extremely powerful to rank up early on, but op says that there will be legions of rank 14s before bwl and that's simply gonna be literally impossible.

1. No

2. You can buyback limited items

3. Grinding areas are about mob density, HP and armor levels and distance to town

Agreed. This rule is nonsence
---
I'm English and pro European (remai🇪🇺n!!!) But this was a huge problem for me in vanilla. I ended in a Swedish sever and couldn't talk with half the players which was kinda crappy. I may play on east coast American forums tbh and just deal with the time difference. May even work in my favour for grinding whilst everyone is at work and school as I'm a fee hours ahead.

This is the bane of playing a warlock. There's always that guy that wants to keep questing so the lock can summon when they get there.

Allowing pre-registration for server would have the opposite effect. Unless Blizz manages the horde-alliance ratio, alliance players will be drawn towards alliance heavy servers and the same for horde.
---
Ok your "one" wasn't a rebuttle. I listen to top rankers all day, I watch streams and videos regularly. 
---
2 yes, actually, I expect it to be less than 4 months which will mean 0 rank 14s in bwl week 1. 
---
3 that's what I said, isn't it?
---
4) you don't know that classic will emulate pservers in any way, and u do know that they won't in some ways. The meta could be different based on the variables I mentioned. 
---
Lastly, I'd agree if your statement was that progressive itemization would be best but it's simply false to paint this picture of rank 14s rampantly camping fpaths before bwl.
---
I can only speak from experience as an undead warrior who pvpd all of vanilla.
---
Equally geared warlocks were a free win in a duel, and a free kill otherwise.
---
My friend played a shaman throughout vanilla as well, and he said the same thing. To this day he still laughs about purging soul link.
---
I'm sure there are ways to win these fights, but I don't really see how.
---
Even then only the most extreme groups on select servers will down rag in the first few weeks. I bet on average it takes most servers closer to a month if not longer.
---
I got one on that kron3 server on my paladin.
---
One week before my guild called it quits for freshdale.

Censorship of ideas is never a good thing. Especially relating to creative outlets like post  naxx content. No idea what the mods are thinking with this imo
---
Not Classic wtf
---
The most beautiful piece of art ive ever seen.
---
Just looking forward to the silithus mats farm to open AQ. Was so cool back in the day seeing all these servers trying to open AQ on their own.
---
LoL!!!! Sounds like you have my luck!
---
But no one said anything about pulling additional mobs.
---
I mean, summer 2019 is a good timeframe. Imagine if they said july and then it comes out august.
---
Scroll up a tic
---
No single thing has gotten me more excited than this.  Seeing it all planned like this is incredible!
---
I dedicate this meme to my old buddy, ~~Insanetoker~~ ~~Insanesmoker~~ Insanejoker, the guy who had to change his name twice because GMs made him.
---
He did not have insane jokes, if you were wondering.
---
&gt; If it takes you 20 days to level... you aren't trying to level.
---
Yes, glad you understand the entire point of my comment.
---
I think everyone's guess on the average is extremely biased towards fast runs. The only people who generally talk about their /played time are those who cared to level quickly. All the people taking 20+ days aren't lurking forums and posting their own speed. The result is that the perceived average is much faster than reality. It's too bad Blizzard never released as stats on this.
---
Also if you care, I don't know my vanilla /played time. But my TBC /played time was over 20 days, although I don't know exactly. Back then, I didn't care much about reaching max level.
---
No. That would hurt you in battle grounds and in common world pvp. If you're killing the same tool over and over again.
---
Go boom, man. Do it. It might be a bad spec but there's something fun about being a rare spec. I saw maybe 3 at 60 in my vanilla time and each time they brought joy to my heart. Just manage your expectations about who you'll be grouping with and what you'll be doing. But there will be just as many people cheering you for being brave enough to boomkin than there are reflex taunting you for the same.
---
His art is the prettiest art of all the art
---
What you don't get is that most of the stuff I mentioned are *fixed time costs* like cooking and fishing. If you do them at 60 you mostly gain nothing from all the fished/cooked stuff you are crafting in hindsight, and again you'll spend money that you shouldnt have spent.
---
Your epic mount and your theoretical farming speed, that doesn't matter because it has absolutely no influence on how fast you cook or fish.
---
Now with gathering it is the same. It is super smooth to skill up herbing/mining while leveling if you know what your doing, and with addon assistance it is super easy to keep up (even you could do it!). You don't need an epic mount, you just kill mobs, gather, kill mobs, gather. Your traveling speed has very little influence.
---
Just as an example, the welp =&gt; jaguar grinding route in SoS has a fuckton of highly valuable herbs right on top of it in Blindweed and Fadeleaf who both sell for a fuckton of money. Plus if you are an Alch you get a good amount of Liferoot too which you can combine with STV Kingsblood to make multiple stacks of good health potions for that level.
---
Or Tanaris, you kill a bunch of pirates to get Volatile Rum, then you make a round of grinding in the open field to get Firebloom to craft GRF (again, sells super well) for example. In the open field rounds you kill those fire buzzard things that go down super quickly (caster stats) and they drop eggs for Monster Omelet. Back on the way to the pirates there are usually multiple of Stonescale Eel swarms, the occasional wreckage and Oily Blackmouth.
---
Or take mining and be a bit smart with your pathing, you find higher amounts of deposits alongside mountains/hills and inside caves, which are usually great grinding spots because they have super high mob density. Especially Silithid caves have high value minerals for their level range.
---
I already said above that crafting profs are probably not worth it except if you really weave the material gathering perfectly into your routes, but for some of the easier professions its no issue and you probably don't lose much time here either.
---
Like all of this stuff done smartly while leveling is just much more efficient. The people who don't do this are either speed levelers or people who follow questing guides. If you plan your own routes and mesh them well together with efficient quests and grinding you come out ahead easily because again, those are basically fixed cost activities.
---
&gt;"Oh you're on top of the threat meter? Shame."
---
the downside is usually those are the people doing the least in the dungeon. if they're *too important to dps the trash* they also likely feel that they're *too important to learn fight mechanics* so they're a bottom threat anyway due to crap dps. 
---
spent way too many years being a tank and seeing that mentality. its been around for a long long time.
---
ok if my edit didnt clear things up let me retype this again. 
---
IM TALKING ABOUT CHARACTER MODEL INTERACTIONS. NOT CLICKING OR TARGETING PLAYERS
---
But how many want to be the next Hokage? :V
---
I was thinking something like this, introducing some kind of bounty system.
---
Are they keeping the aoe loot system where you can loot entire areas? That seems kind of like a super positive QoL thing that should be there.
---
With 16 slots on release, 1.12 talents, potentially just Item Gating they’re going to be much stronger than original Vanilla and on current Private servers.
---
They call it Stranglethorn Vietnam for a reason
---
Nah dude Blizzard just wants to make sure you are having fun and enjoying your self thats really ALL they are worried about rofl. They could care less about this project.....just surprise launch the servers already sheesh
---
This is exactly what I needed to hear, I really appreciate it!
---
Love this! So many people are hyped for Classic, seems like it’s going to be huge!!!
---
DKs were originally going to give you some sort of notoriety or something like that, but instead they just sucked.
---
&gt; rebuttle
---
&gt; I listen to top rankers all day
---
Really? Because I’ve seen 2 prominent ones complaining about it in the main thread. Monkeynews shares the same opinion. I’m gonna go on a limb and say you aren’t hearing from any top rankers.
---
TBC was better at 70. Raids were tough, content was gated by difficulty (t4 and 5 there from start), etc.
---
But tbc had flying. Which ruined what made vanilla so good by comparison.
---
Azeroth from 1-60 on a self contained server was a world. By 70 the game was a “theme park”. 
---
1-60 was a game in of itself. 60-70 was enjoyable, but it was work. There weren’t any mini map pop ups or up screens to tell you what to do once you hit 60, it was just “here you go”. We will never get back not knowing and not having thottbot, but that journey, that big world is all that’s left of the difference.
---
I'm curious if using a deviate delight changes their model size.
---
All this because of a 60 day wait from when honor system arrived to BG's. 60 days gonna cause tons of changes and shit like this.
---
Just introduce BG's in phase 2.
---
Hi, /u/Hockeynerden
---
Tweaked classic would be awesome with the tbc balance changes but no level cap increase or flying mounts. Throw in the tbc raids and dungeon in the old world, and that is a hell of a game.
---
Of course getting classic done is the priority, but it is fun to think about. I don't think it will ever happen, though. They are more likely to just release tbc than modify vanilla imo
---
neanderthals had bigger brains than homo sapiens
---
Ice is back with my brand new invention.

Yeah I literally have 3 or so seconds to decide, because 2 melee swings will cleave me. Even warlocks and mages are more survivable, :/
---
My cousin has to use phone internet for everything because the only other option is dial-up. They live about a 15 minute drive to fiber internet speeds.
---
If people quit the game because they got ganked maybe they should play a PvE server? Personally I don't care at all if I get ganked on a fp and camped.
---
Black lotus respawned once every hour in one of four zones back in vanilla. Stop talking shit.
---
Yo, no one is reaching r13 without BGs. This complaint is unfounded. Even if people camp like crazy in EPL, there will be diminishing returns from killing the same people over and over. Yes it will be war everywhere. But very very few people will be able to amass enough honor for the higher ranks in time to buy all the gear prior to BWL opening.
---
It does, to the standard hitbox
---
Casuals do not belong on pvp servers
---
I was out enjoying the morning breeze and having breakfast and I'm not the one who downvoted you.
---
For fucking real—and even that’s pushing it. As if you gear up a couple more weeks you won’t even needs flasks then.
---
Outside of naxx full consumables is a sign that you don’t want to associate with said player—probably elitist and toxic af,
---
Horde seems to attract more pvp-focused players due to the better pvp racials.  So even when alliance outnumbered horde on the server alliance players experienced instant or near instant BG ques where as horde were waiting for up to an hour.  At the same time horde at least in my battle group destroyed alliance in solo que BGs.
---
Yes tauren hitbox is larger.
---
Can hit others from further away than other races, however they can as well. This is even further if tauren v tauren. Your deadzone is also larger, so you need to be "further away" to charge, for example.
---
They should have made you having a do give an honor multiplier if killed by the enemy faction while reducing honor gain for the killer

---
&gt;Next 3 that look like candy are Seasonal Buffs as well. I believe they give 2% melee hit among other things.
---
They second set of seasonal buffs are from valentines chocolates...
---
Buttermilk Delight - 13 Defense
---
Very Berry Cream - Spell damage +23 (this also shows they are just trolling with buffs)
---
Dark Desire - 2% melee hit
---
&gt;**Strength Scroll** most likely. 
---
It'll be the 2nd 10% stat buff from the lunar festival by dancing with plebs in moonglade (stacks with Elune's that you get from killing omen) can't remember it's name, though  
---
absolutely no idea what the present icon buffs are!
---
that's not how it works
---
Agreed. u/Butt_Bandit- makes the most beautiful pieces of art to ever grace our presence.
---
Wrong sub
---
*Laughs in Self Employed.
---
1.12 version of the PvP gear so actually the top stuff is aq40 level I believe
---
During vanilla and even BC absolutely. It wasnt until wotlk when I really hit my stride. The biggest thing for keyboard turning I was taught was bund A and D to strafe left and right. Now you can no longer turn your character with the keyboard. Comfortable keybinds is not a far jump once you get that far.
---
Heal on my brother in the light!
---
Spells don't crit. There are resistance fights obviously, but if you want to keep spike damage down you wear def.
---
That guy talks nonsense or is just plain wrong a lot.
---
I mentioned that video on a popular discord for classic and it was dismissed because hes just some random youtuber. That might be true, but it doesn't change the reality of the gear being different over time and content was balanced to that environment. I think his idea of itemization passes at certain phases was actually novel and should be the way it happens. Otherwise retune the content for 1.12 gear stat weights. No changes right? Right?
---
WPvP here I come!! :D
---
*Guilty as charged
---
I remember encountering a troll rogue named "Pokinyew", sounded the name out in my head, and was in tears laughing for minutes on end. 
---
The joke landed way harder than it should have, felt like.
---
Thanks. Doesn't mean you should just wear 440 def for every fight during progression for no reason.
---
were you 6?
---
Some ones salty about getting wreckt before the games even out ! lol at this
---
Classic didn't have diminishing returns on sap, right? 
---
Because I swear I remember that, sometimes, a rogue would sap me, taunt and laugh at me from the shadows, and then re-sap me as soon as it wore off, keeping me locked down with sap for a few minutes on end, felt like. Was frustrating.
---
you can say ass on the internet..

I absolutely promise you that there's something you appreciate that someone else doesn't.

Who cares you get nothing but useless shit from being the "Scarab Lord" fcking nerds
---
Saaaaaame.

Yup. I like to mind my own fucking business while leveling but also at 60. I don't enjoy griefing other players so I don't need to opt to be griefed.
---
Yup. Where PVP is the only option.
---
I need to get off this sub
---
wpvp in vanilla ... so much fun !!
---
&gt; It's not about my opinion, it's about what people want
---
What is that even supposed to mean?
---
People want vanilla as it was and you're here claiming that it will be a "shitty version" if they don't increase server caps or w/e.
---
&gt; trust me
---
I don't know you and I don't agree with you, so no, I'm not going to trust you on anything...
---
&gt; I'm speaking from recent experience
---
OH WOW! You've played on a private servers?!? Well aren't *you* a special snowflake!
---
Well, guess what?  So have I and many, many others
---
&gt; you guys are speaking from a 14 year old experience
---
You're making way too many assumptions.
---
In the previous post you've called me "old"... I'm not even 30, bro...
---
Now you're saying that my experience is outdated?
---
Don't worry, I've got a few years of pserver experience under my belt, so I'm all up to date on what the kool kids like you are doing.
---
And speaking of pservers, they've been around for the past 15 years and now they're more popular than ever before. So much for not being "growing game".
---
Not only that, but people who've played on these pservers are the loudest ones about #nochanges.
---
The 10k servers are fun for the first few hours, but it gets old really fast.
---
Even the 5k servers feel too crowded.
---
But if what you say really does happen (all things do come to an end eventually), that's when we can start worrying about how to keep the population alive.
---
Merging servers and increasing pop space, adding new content post naxx, progressing into TBC or whatever else.
---
But right now, people want vanilla as it was, with all of it's flaws.
---
If you still don't get that, then I don't know what else to say.
---
SL warlock is kinda on it's own tier of power in 1v1 pvp, looking down at all the rest

Forget time off, I’m trying to plan a 3 month sabbatical!  Conversations with my boss about it are starting to get awkward.  I can’t really say “I’m taking 3 months off to play WoW”, so I’ve been talking about this enriching life experience I’m looking to pursue, and he’s asking why I’m not doing it yet.  He’s starting to get suspicious, and I’m running out of ways to say things like “Its hard to predict when chakras will be aligned harmoniously, but I’ll let you know as soon as the Internet tells me they will be.”
---
This sabbatical may end up being a permanent one of I don’t get a date soon.

a naked SL lock will get 1 shot
---
Answer: Both.
---
Sure why not. I played through all of vanilla as a raider, only bosses that remained unkilled: KT, Saph, 4HM, Cthun. Was aged 13 at launch to 15, nearly 16, at tBC launch. Went from a ragtag guild of friends to a top end raid guild somewhere between ZG and AQ patches.The connections I made with a raiding roster of ~55ish mostly-older individuals influenced me in a lot of ways (group strategy and organization, management of egos, general life advice).  I'd love to chat about it all.
---
I for sure will be recreating my old leveling guild, &lt;More Scrubs than Brillo&gt;, inviting absolutely anyone and everyone. By the time some of us are 60, we'll see who's interested in grinding 5-10 person dungeons for pre-BiS. If that works according to plan, we'll see who's interested in attempting a raid. Just a "no pressure, but let's see what happens" kind of group, where the tailors make bags for people, the alchemists make potions for people, the enchanters improve gear for people, all for material cost at least and friend prices at most.
---
Point is, I cannot be alone in doing this. There's got to be a slew of people looking to make the pioneer journey easier for themselves and others. There must be dozens of guilds like the one I plan to make on any given server.
---
Well it is supposed to be some major old god minion so it makes a little more sense for it to be like the new version rather than for it to just be a regular ass hydra.
---
Play a pve server...?
---
The real tauren racial is standing on top of people capping the flag on AB so they're harder to spot.
---
Du hast for sure
---
There were some people who would listen in on Ventrilo, but refused to connect a mic. 
---
Some of those people might have been autistic, had lisps, were extremely introverted with social anxiety, et cetera...
---
...but a whole-ass *handful* of those people were probably pre-teens who didn't want their squeakster voices to give them away. Haha.
---
When a raid is having trouble filling 40 positions and half the population is a mage/hunter without any discipline or skill, a dedicated Boomkin player who is willing to prove himself ought to be a decent choice.
---
Just like in RL, sure you've got a thousand certified job applicants sporting the same old bachelor's degree  but sometimes you're best off picking the kid who wants to work and prove himself.
---
I swear all these kids playing must have raimstien on repeat.
---
Grummz: 
---
"Our goal for population of servers and why we... was design, yes, and later on was technical... we, we can't do more than this." "From a cost perspective you want to get as many players onto a server as you can, you don't want a lot of empty cycles sitting around where you can shove a player in and utilize the electricity and bandwidth and everything else. But Alan Adam(?) was very adamant about communities and servers and he very much wanted a world where you, it was like the bar in cheers where everybody knows your name and you see the same guy over and over again where you form these social bonds, you'd be like "I know that guy I've seen him before. And so he wanted even smaller sizes on servers and when we shipped the servers were actually running okay."
---
"We had a bottleneck on the back-end, and I can't go too much in detail about it, but we had a bottleneck that was on the back-end that caused us far more headaches and so we had server caps and soft caps, but we were trying to get it as low as possible and I was trying to find the right balance between cost and everything else to do this and to build a community at the same time and I have to say that's one aspect I really miss from MMOs and including modern wow is the loss of that feeling of community and I think Alan was very right in that respect that you do trade something off for that."
---
"But I know that nostalrius and other realms ran much higher player counts on their servers and u remember seeing screenshots of lines for certain quests and that actually seemed to build their communities. So that's an example that goes in the opposite direction. Which feels like there's a lot of activity, you're in a bustling city and HEY everyone's here this is really cool[?]. And so I want to keep playing I don't care if there is a line vs that tight nit community Alan really wanted."
---
Hope I transcribed it well enough for anyone that didn't want to watch the vid.
---
So it sounds like the og design philosophy was to have a small server (2500), unbeknown by john staats. So the 3500 cap that was added later was their technical limitation then?
---
Or just say fuck diminishing returns and improve gouge people for eternity. 
---
I loved to duel kids next to the Zepp and gouge them till we leave.
---
One other disadvantage of playing the best race in WoW, is that in crowded PvP situations people will click on you first.
---
Whether intentionally or by accident from trying to target that scrawny undead next to you, you will get targeted first and will be eating all the bolts and DoTs of every color and flavor.
---
I prefer prozac firestarter, tyvm.
---
Small scale groups is exactly what happened in classic, that isn't romanticizing anything. And ganking lowbies wont give you much compared to 60s with pvp rank. This is a time where honor for kills is 100% what gets you rank. Anyone who only farms low 50s is getting jack shit for honor. 
---
Also, it isn't even just about pure efficiency. People love world pvp, and now they can actually rank up doing it. Even honor grinders who are super into it will take a break from pure grind to have fun. And rivalries will be a thing again. No matter how you grind, you will make enemies. The highest ranked ally rogue liked to pick off horde duelers in badlands. I killed him all the time on my hunter.
---
&gt; Not saying he's right or wrong just trying to clarify.
---
Read the last line of my comment one more time bro.
---
I will think about it, thanks. You are right absolutely!
---
Horde tends to be outnumbered in Vanilla because Alliance has Paladins.
---
My favourite edgy rogue name was, &lt;Shanxalot&gt; as it was my rogues name. Lol
---
Nice! I DM you!
---
Cool. I DM you!
---
Is this going to be a US guild? If so please let me know which server is picked!
---
pretty sure it would be /4. nobody used /2 until they took away our glorious /4.
---
Pretty much. Anyways, he's saying "well they have ways of dealing with that", meaning server transfers, which are hands down WAY worse for the community than have a 5k+ pop server. Like it's kind of funny hes arguing about community, and also saying well if your server dies because its 2500 pop, then just transfer later. ::thinking:: I'd rather have a healthy server with a bustling community.
---
I guess we can all just go play on Tichondrius if the servers will be 2500 pop, and sit in the queues. Atleast we will know our server won't be dead a couple months after release.
---
Voodoo People, Prodigy
---
That moment you realize you’re wrong
---
Nobody, it's a shit job
---
Yes, I realize you want to believe I meant to include tanks in that comment... but I only brought up dps and heals!!
---
"not listening" to this.
---
Least gear dependent: Mage, Hunter, Rogue. They don’t need much gear because of all the control and survivability they have. 
---
Most gear dependent: Warrior, Warlock, Spriest, Elly Shaman. These classes are depressing to play without gear but turn into literal gods once they get good gear.
---
Ok then, link me where any top ranker gave definitive proof that, in classic, you will be able to have rank 14 before bwl by camping flight paths. That is what I am arguing against.
---
Coming from Private servers, I see a LOT of rogues.
---
Every once in a while, you run into another mage who is actually not a mage but in fact a warlock and it's like: "Holy shit, a lock!"
---
Considering all the players know there are too many mages yet continues to roll mage makes me think there will definitely be a shortage of locks despite knowing there is a shortage of locks.
---
Just like college: Everyone wants to be a nurse when we know there's a nursing bubble. And every fool who doesn't know what they're doing goes into Criminal Justice yet no one ever follows through. Patterns just are.
---
Roll a lock and be special. :)
---
I mean, we did.  Maybe I just worded it oddly.  Pretty much went like:
---
~The Beast dies~
---
Me: Skinners roll to skin it?
---
~  Everyone agrees.  Three people roll, I win and skin The Beast~
---
"Attrm receives loot: Pristine Hide of the Beast"
---
Tank: Hey I should get to roll on that.
---
Attrm: Oh sorry, I thought the lots were done. Are you a Skinner?
---
Tank: No but I need it for a quest.
---
Rando:. If he gets too roll I want roll too.
---
Attrm:. But you aren't a Skinner...we rolled to see who could skin it.  Just because it ended up being something you want doesn't mean you can have it...
---
Tank:. REEEEEE!  Fucking ninja!!
---
After he kicked me I took a screenshot and when I my friend said the dude posted about it on the forum I just posted the SS and the dude got mocked until he deleted it.  Never had a bad rap otherwise.
---
Pretty sure you cannot select your title in vanilla, and having any level of PvP ranking takes priority.
---
Definitely Hunter. The Hunter tier sets are very viable in pvp. Just like their pve talents are viable in pvp. 
---
Hunters take the cake when it comes to pvp/pve viability. They’re the only ones who never have to respec or change gear.
---
Except that PvP gear get released on the same phase as DM? it also take way longer to get rank 10 than the DM stuff.
---
It's okay, I'll BoP you!
---
/2 \[Anal, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker\]
---
Is it always one raid per Stage ? And how long do you think will be the time between the stages?
---
It really gladens my heart to see your interest of the subject guys! Because so many have shown interest, I might have to make a random selection of who I interview :) 
---
By the way, I would love to interview females ! It would be awesome to make comparisons between their and male players answers! If you are a woman, or know a woman that would be open for an interview, just tell me!!
---
Ooooooh - I got you. You rolled to skin it, skinned it and then they wanted to roll again on what you got.
---
Hahaha - yeah they can go fuck themselves.
---
Dagger spec is the way to go. You’ll love not having to compete for swords.
---
Only if it actually kills you. If I go 440 defense rn, I lose like 2k HP and so much agi and threat stats its ridiculous. In prebis during MC progression, its the same. Ill take warmaster's legs or eldritch reinforced over eternal guardian every time.
---
Man, those night elf hunters are really throwing shade at their horde counterparts.
---
I enjoy pvp to the extent of a few bgs here and there, not being constantly under threat. Some find that relaxing, I certainly don’t! I’m glad there is enough demand for pve servers.
---
Yes, you can have just as much fun lvling as you can at lvl cap.  That's the beauty of classic.
---
Me too man I don’t think I can wait much longer, all I do is watch classic wow videos and I’ve even made a full word document planning my leveling, proffesions and end game I’ve got it all figured out lmao
---
I dunno, I might be getting down with the sickness actually.
---
its just a different experience. nobody likes being camped by max levels in STV, sure that part sucks, but there are so many other benefits that make the entire experience more immersive. For example) leveling through the blasted lands and seeing the enemy faction, you both keep a close eye on eachother while you quest ready to defend yourself at any moment. Or killing the enemy after they tagged the last ogre you need for your quest.
---
Overall the *threat* you constantly need to think about makes the world really feel more dangerous than it already is, grouping with people to take control of a base camp so you can turn in quests (nesingwary). Sure there are some negatives, but the player generated interactions honestly make up for them, especially during downtime where there aren't any raids or dungeons going on
---
Bruh

Not really no.  Anyone who doesn't wreck you should quickly realize the futility of their actions and just leave.  Many specs will still kill the hpal but for anyone who you heavily out gear or who doesn't know how to deal with an hpal can just walk away if it the fight doesn't go their way.  In a duel where you fight to the death? sure.

Wasn't peggle in the game at one point?
---
Holy shit the 3 saps has me dying. They do it just to fuck with you
---
You have my sword! Er, dagger!
---
never understood why people started doing buffruns for speedclears and then sperging out when they lost them. dying is as much part of classic as the aspects we remember and love it for are. clearing the raid a few minutes faster than a group that didn't waste far longer gathering these buffs, is only a testament to insanity
---
You could probably clear BWL in an all pre-bis guild. Lots of crafted items/BoE are stronger then raid gear at that point.
---
From a purely PvE min/max view about half of MC loot could be disenchanted.
---
You need to make sure to Get Up first, before you Get Down With the Sickness. This is key and a lot of beginners mess it up.

That’s the Druid

Only true WoW players will understand.

Played during the initial ‘phase 2’ and it wasn’t nearly as bad as all the ‘sky is falling!!!!1!’ crowd around here would have you believe.
---
If you’re so damn terrified of getting ganked while leveling, then play on a PvE server.
---
But... my kings...
---
We're east coast United States, yes. I'm chomping at the bit for a release date, server list, etc. Cannot wait, and would love to do some online and local flyer advertisement for preemptive recruiting.

The core issue is that I'm bringing my wife and a guy friend I played vanilla with, so we are a trio, and yet cannot decide which faction to be on. She wants Alliance, but would be willing to go Horde if that'd make me happy, I'd like Horde but would be willing to go Alliance if it made her happy, and my guy friend in the middle doesn't care either way. So...we're undecided on a *big* make-or-break fork in the road. Hah. I'm sure we'll find eager people wherever we go, but it'd be nice to have a definitive faction so that we can narrow our recruitment criteria, as some people are faction loyalists. I spent 90% of my WoW career from vanilla to WotLK as an Alliance, so it'd be neat to see the other side of the story line and use their sweet PvP racials, but we'll see.
---
Lastly and as an aside, my wife had better win the /roll on gear she wants, because she's not getting it, otherwise. I loathe bias and favoritism, and she's not getting treated like a privileged queen just because we've been together 10 years. I'm not going to hide my relation to her character in-game, but she's not getting preferential treatment over any other member of the guild if they have more points or a better roll. Don't you hate when a rare mount drops, and someone gives it to who is clearly their best friend? I know I do...  O_o
---
So if I pick druid (my main in retail and favorite class) Ill need to heal?? Because I HATE healing :v
---
that is insane. wow.
---
You are probably right
---
Can someone ELI5 DKs? 
---
I don’t remember the penalties for DKs since I was only a wee baby noob in classic. Never ganked anyone with my level 38 prot warrior 😹😹😹
---
I think there's a big difference between dying a few times, and what we're going to see in phase 2.
---
whatever the fuck. i clearly don’t care
