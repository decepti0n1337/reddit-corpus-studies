Not really on topic, but I never really played shaman and was thinking of trying it in classic. My idea was start as hybrid enhancement so I don't suffer going out of mana constantly when leveling while being able to easily join pre-raid instances as a healer since it's easier to find groups that way. Later on I would change to restoration for raid content and when I'm bored of PvE I would respec to elemental for PvP.
---

---
What I wanted to know is if restoration shamans are often welcomed in raids or if people usually prefer priests or other healer classes.
---
---
---
There is no way in hell you're going to get enough gold from skinning to buy your mats for engineering. Unless you skinned at 60 and farmed rugged leather for a significant amount of time
---
Wait which part lol?
---
Don’t do that hot pockets shit. Meal prep. Make some chicken and rice, burrito bowls, a hearty salad. Meal prep for your week or whatever and give you body proper energy.
---
Wonder why they fix some bugs yet leave the trap scatter DR one.
---
Very funny and original.
---
So you just hop around everywhere to swap your tracker? That's awesome haha.
---
No massive contingent of gamers knew how good WoW was going to be on November 23, 2004 and they certainly had very little knowledge of the game or any strategy of how to play it at all.
---
The release of Classic will be completely different and nothing from Vanilla will compare.
---
I believe it did back in the day
---
Never forget.
---
To be fair, PvP weekends haven't existed in a looooong time aswell
---
I'll be rolling Horde but I will not stop any Alliance corpse camping UD rogues.
---
My wife got surprise time off and we are now taking a week off. We literally leave on the 27th.
---
Changes in my Classic? *REEEEEEEE*
---
Code red, no dose, and corn nuts.
---
It should be pointed out that [Rallying Cry of the Dragonslayer](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=22888/rallying-cry-of-the-dragonslayer) and [Fengus' Ferocity](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=22817/fengus-ferocity) only give melee attack power. Hunters don't get RAP from these buffs.
---
Battle, not demo?
---
Dps are gonna dps, and if they die, are gonna blame me, so I’d rather not take that into account hahahaha
---
&gt; twitch reactionary moves
---
Sheep is a twitch move is it?
---
Somone knows what happens when you disenchanted an epic in the beta? Nexus Crystals are AQ patch.
---
Gain the weight beforehand, then eat nothing for the week. Beware that just eating *less* will be unsustainable; you have to eat zero calories.
---
Alternatively, eat one meal a day and meal prep like /u/corshura mentioned.
---
Any mouse that has the 12 buttons on the side is the way to go you have so mich keybindings you'll NEVER run out! Once you get used to it becomes as easy as dialing on your telephone.
---
Bullshit.
---
This would be a cool idea for a healer/tank class LOL
---
Yeah you can look cool but what’s the point when there’s nothing to do and nobody to impress that sweet set with?
---
Put your faith in the light and all is possible
---
I also wonder if this is true, nobody on the sub seems to have mentioned it, or?
---
as expected you were talking out your ass again
---
Healing Touch is one of if not the most mana efficient spells in the game, Druids should not have any issues healing.
---
What have I said that’s incorrect?
---
But it does, because we’re just testing the servers survivability with high population. We’re not testing for bugs, we don’t even have access to the full game, literally 2 days to see how the servers stand. It’s just a test. I don’t know how much simpler I can explain it without bursting a temple.
---
IMO guild bank doesn't change anything I'd miss.
---
Not all YouTube videos are from 1.12 tho
---
I stopped the video right there. 
---
Great representative for the guttermunching plebs that call themselves the horde though.
---
I'd be alright with a calendar function would make managing raid invites a ton easier without need for a third party.
---
&gt;ez mode experience with the 1.12 talents
---
theres literally not a person that isnt a dev that worked on vanilla that knows if 1.1 or 1.12 is actually more or less damage overall

I have inferred from context that you mean troll by this and I feel personally offended.
---
Props to you for keeping it up post oops.  Made my day reading it my friend, have an upvote.
---
Especially when you desperately want to play WoW but not on a substandard set up like a laptop. I want to lock myself in a basement for half a year a play Classic with no responsibilities. Even if I had a yacht, I wouldn't care to go anywhere with it if it means I can't have low ping.
---
&gt; Make some chicken
---
And remember to really cook that shit trough or you will spend your classic week on the toilet.
---
I love Tabasco on pizza.

So the first one would be Harvest Festival where you get the gadget that summons food once per day.

Someone did a post about it with vids conparing and everything a few days ago.

Some general rules if you're new to the dungeon/tanking in general:
---
1. Get a gun/bow and pull groups back instead of charging in.
---
2. Use Line of Sight to force casters to come to you.
---
3. One sunder/revenge is generally enough for each target.
---
4. Save excess rage for next pull and use Bloodrage between groups to stop rage loss.
---
5. Rely on taunt to pull mobs off DPSers. Your main job is to make sure the healer isn't getting swarmed.
---
Start everyday with eggs and a fruit. 
---
Snack on nuts throughout being awake. 
---
Drink plenty o' water. 
---
Eat a protein for dinner. 
---
Ggwp.
---
I've been hearing around 15 later on. In early game crystal's will be pricey.
---
I agree man, try to find one of the really high pop servers and they will have people raiding all different times of the day
---
Hey, honestly it's a whole odd thing about sometimes you need a sub sometimes you don't. Maybe try getting a trial to level 10, then it should allow you to post. Sorry for the late replay.

Why DO you type LIKE this?

Trust me I want to play ally but as a rogue I don't want to play vs orcs

How long will Phase 1 be ?

I'd like to know this as well

Can you share your wallpaper please ? Looks so awesome

trust me, as a horde rogue you dont want to play against dwarfs, orc is based on RNG, dwarf is 100% hes gonna 100-0 you

---
It's going to be tough to guess. The problem is that a pretty large portion of classic will be going in with prior knowledge, and be able to make money much faster, which will also likely give them more to throw around. Conversely more people may have a plan laid out and begin the process of working towards making their own, eliminating the need to buy them.
---
Your in for a disappointment.
---
My most recent main on a private server was a warlock - tailor / engineer.  For the min max crowd you need Bloodvine for the +hit (especially since I was a warlock) and engineering for sappers and such.
---
AoE farming is great, but I recommend an gathering alt as well.  I make a druid who is a miner / herbalist.  If I'm mining rich thorium and a black lotus pops right next to me, I can grab it.  Its just so much more efficient.  Druids can stealth to hard to get to nodes, CC with entangling roots and are slippery if contesting a lotus.  They can also farm mobs fairly well.  I grinded lvl 51-60 on mobs that had good cash drops and were near 2-3 black lotus spawns.  Druids are also pretty fun in my opinion, I like the variety of their toolbox.
---
Everything in Classic needs a lot of buttons for PvP.
---
I have a mouse with two buttons.
---
MB1
---
MB2
---
Mousewheel up
---
Mousewheel down
---
Shift+MB1
---
Shift+MB2
---
Shift+MWUp
---
Shift+MWDown
---
That's more than enough if you add in 1-5, q,e,r,f,g,z,x,c plus shift modifiers.

I dont understand all your downvotes.

You are right.

There is literally dusins of hypotheticals that might justify his friends feelings about him playing videogames.

Buy something to track your sleep cycles, I'm partial to [the one made by Nokia](https://www.withings.com/us/en/sleep) that fits under your mattress.
---
Have it wake you up the moment you complete 4 full REM cycles (about 6 hours). Light is the best alarm clock, I use a bunch of Phillips Hue lights to replicate a sunrise that starts 20 minutes before the projected end of my last cycle.
---
This is usually 11:30PM to 5:30AM for me. Around 2PM, I take 150mg caffeine (grande caramel macchiato) and take a 20 minute nap. The [Coffee Nap](https://youtu.be/CaI5LWj6ams) is far more effective than just coffee or just a nap. It's important not to nap for longer than this as you'll enter REM sleep and end up feeling more fatigued than before you started your nap.
---
Yeah but then they buy new games, etc.
---
Uhm Ark is super fun if you find a private or good unofficial servers, and I highly recommend it. You don't have to play on official with zerg
---
World of StarCraft?
---
Mobs don't have a leeway increase, Kevin Jordan confirmed on his stream. The reason you feel they have a longer range is because you have better connection to the server.
---
How do you even have fun playing this little? Legit, I don't get it. Whenever I couldn't dedicate at least a fairly decent chunk of time to wow I just quit, every time. 
---
If I knew it would take me approx a year and a half to go from 1 to 60, I'd just lose all motivation to play instantly.
---
I’m glad I asked. That was fascinating! Thanks!
---
this is 100% bullshit
---
Thanks!! That was fascinating.
---
stop this meme please, it's so oversaturrated
---
From what I've heard/read 8 hours is the recommended amount for a growing individual (child), while 5 hour is enough to rest your brain and body the exact amount is individual but ranges between 5-7 hours for an adult.
---
The whole point of spell batching is to deal with networking issues.  
---
And it does affect spell casting, cause of how queueing works.
---
And yet, before beta was announced, I came across countless people claiming that a beta is not necessary because "they're just re-hosting vanilla".
---
/rolleyes
---
Your guild will have raid calendar setup in their website, thats how we rolled back in the day.
---
##nochanges
---
Someone build this.
---
Someone took Ethics!
---
According to this sub there's going to be 0 arcanite bars available because engineering is the only viable profession.
---
This feels a little premature. I like the idea for sure but I won't be looking till servers are announced. It would suck to get a partner then find out you will be on different servers.
---
I think this comment pretty much sums up why most people are #nochanges. We want the magic and don't want modern blizz to meddle.
---
When you had been playing UO/DAoC/EQ this was 100% Pog to see.
---
It is basically a requirement for bank alts. So it does
---
stoneform, you'll never be able to reset the fight with blind, crippling poison or even bleeds (if hes a rogue and  youre trying prevent him from re-stealthing).
---
Start a fight, go make a sandwich, change the oil on your car, watch one of the extended cut Lord of the rings movies, collect loot from the mob you were auto-attacking, repeat.
---
Not really you have so many different tricks you can do, you’re really situationally flexible. Also isn’t mage super boring to play just pressing frostbolt, frost nova and blink? The same argument can be made for most classes in classic.
---
Sure, in raid gear and with downranking and the right build it's very good efficiency. For your average 5 man while levelling and at 60 though it has much worse efficiency and poor throughput, meaning you will often need to use other much less efficient heals.
---
Just made em for fun. Haven’t completely decided what to do with them yet.
---
Definitely want a razor naga. I can easily run 1-8 with just a thumb press. Makes it much easier to bind the skill bloat of classic.
---
It means that if you scatter your target and then they hit your freezing trap within 15 seconds of that scatter, instead of being frozen for 8 seconds, they'll be frozen for 4 seconds.
---
Who. who has tested it? Who has shown their gear after grinding dungeons to level? 
---
The beta was so dead that I don't think many people even ran a lot of dungeons from 18-25, and what I did see of experiments (like kargoz) were way too brief to even get a sense of gearing. I don't think they even ran wailing caverns, completely, once.
---
The scarlet monastery stuff was all after everyone was already near BIS. who would even notice if greens were or were not dropping in sufficient quantity to stay geared, especially as SM has a huge loot table due to being so many bosses, and of course, if you have a level 30 blue, you won't be considering equipping a level 36 green. 
---
What testing are you referring to? I mean this as an honest inquiry. Because I am aware of no such testing. 
---
If anything, I heard BOE greens were LESS available in the beta, because apparently low level chests are way too generous on private servers (a guaranteed green in each chest where a lot of the beta chests were just some white items or other junk). 
---
Frankly, I don't think we will get better drop tables until someone mines them or builds an addon to havest large datasets. I can see not putting a lot of faith in classicdb.ch, but I certainly cannot see making declarative statements that run completely counter to it, when it's by far the best source I am aware of (barring perhaps wowhead classic, which is much less complete but also includes the (very small) sample sizes for the item drop rates.
---
Well, I can't wait to be the only source of them on my server! LOL
---
I'm not 100% of the values. But basically it reduces the duration of the trap for x seconds after using scatter. Or vice versa.
---
Blacksmithing is pretty nice for the 30s fear immunity trinket + escape artist boots.
---
As another comment suggests, it would be easy to add requirements that make it highly impractical for solo bank alts (if that's what they wanted to do), and I would not miss the awkwardness of official guild bank alts at all.
---
Aye, but mana pots could save my heiny almost as often as health pots could save his!
---
It effectively puts you in combat, so the normal rage loss when not in combat is negated. So it gives you 10sec if no rage less while actually gaining rage.
---
If you bank rage between pulls, this will make bloodrage between pulls a better use than as you pull
---
I raided with him in GoReHaMMeR on Burning Blade back in early Wotlk. He was surprisingly pretty chill on vent. It actually took me a while to even realize that it was indeed him despite being a Cannibal Corpse fan at the time. Kinda made me wonder who else I was really playing with sometimes.
---
The big ones are against priest/mage/druid you rely a lot on getting them in a freeze trap and opening at 35 yards- and really the only way to do that is with a scatter to set it up. With them sharing DR both of those skills become much less useful, and you're never going to be able to get in position to get aimed shots off vs mage/druid now. They can now easily just see you drop the freeze trap and play around it.
---
Not to sound mean but I'm not sure how that's relevant to my comment?
---
AnOtHeR fOrCeD MeMe
---
No changes
---
I read too many stuff that is hard to keep track, play whatever way you want im not here to convince you.
---
This is exactly correct. 
---
You have to train yourself to feign death then freeze trap to disengage. This way you get the full 8 seconds.
---
Well I do have babies and all that garbage, but launch also happens to be 9am on my 39th B-Day so I fully intend to no life it for at least launch.  From then I can Probs commit to at least 2 hrs most days.  I am in Australia but I'm not committed to an oceanic server as my play times will not be standard times for here. I haven't decided between horde or alliance or mage or druid.
---
It's pretty obvious after a couple of pulls whether it's a good idea or not. It's not like you're locked into never using a shield. Any decent tank will have a macro for wep swap and be using both as needed.
---
You need achievements to enjoy the game? Oh sweet child what have they done to you...
---
How bout I do neither? It's not like there are multiple videos of Devs saying No RP servers at launch or anything for you to find what Q&amp;A session I'm talking about.
---
Burning Blade was the best server.
---
Definitely, dwarves are so terrible for rogues to fight against.
---
&gt; Targeting Totems with macros is again possible.
---
How much do totem stomping macros screw over shamen?
---
No shadowmeld in combat in vanilla bro
---
Mate feeling up Horses and Alliance you sure are a Randy bugger!
---
I posted this video to showcase the differences between the Beta and this footage from vanilla.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
There is no doubt that this guy would have died many times if he tried this in the current beta as mob leeway is a big issue currently.  
---
Let me know what you guys think, especially those of you who have beta access.
---
1080p version: https://imgur.com/5YBsv8q
---
Except you only need a 35 alt to transmute.
---
Why?
---
Oh I haven't thought of using shift with MB1 and MB2. As a warlock I'd like to have devour magic as a mouseover in shift + MB1 and spell lock on shift + MB2.
---
Thats where the laptop comes handy
---
Wow, I've seen clips of that Tauren and those skeletons but never the full thing. I never realized those clips were from a trailer. A god awful trailer, at that. I'm glad I never saw this when WoW released as it's *so bad* looking.

You can report a bug that was reported 100 times already be my guest. I’m telling you that is not what we are playing the stress test for. If they wanted us to find bugs and fix the game for them, the stress test would be called a beta and last longer than 48 hours.

Chicken sushi or medium rare pls

---
Enchanting makes you poor because you disenchant your quest rewards instead of vendoring them.
---
&gt;hard counters rogues and handles warriors very well also, seeing as how those two classes will probably make up 30% of the player base
---
maybe re-roll mage like every smart hunter is doing right now
---
Ok so we are testing during the beta phase of development and we can report bugs BUT it's not a beta test lol. Your twisting so hard so you don't agree with the facts of the situation.
---
&gt;* Defense is worthless.
---
Well that's a bold statement. Can you elaborate on this point? Mitigating damage and not dying seems like a fairly crucial part of tanking- and defense gives a good amount of avoidance.
---
Will people really pug when anyone can Loot Trade to friends or sell after the raid with whisper and trade. Just have your friends un-equip items you need and let them roll for you etc.
---
Iirc once you get your stat caps you just aren't going to die from a boss hit, so you focus on threat gen, which increases the raid dps.
---
Never played vanilla. I look forward to putting in the time and learning the hunter class. Like anything in life there will always be the chicken littles screaming the sky is falling. Fine with me, one less person I have to compete with.
---
If they make it to the base, I'm gonna be wondering how wide the police force's rectums are from sitting with their thumbs up their ass so long while a viral event has been spreading through news and social media.
---
This isn't debateable lul. What are guides in your opinion then? Why do people go to theorycraft forums to learn how to play no matter how basic their involvement in raiding?
---
"Disagree completely" just sounds like you haven't raided in a long while. I was in *guilds* that week after week got all the world buffs just to die in most random ways before approaching first bosses. It's not up to discussion *if* it happens, but to what degree.
---
&gt;And people don't care about damage meters nearly as much as you think unless they're tied to the way loot is distributed, which very few systems are.
---
Seriously?
---
my mage spec might actually take a capstone talent instead of being the broken bastard that is 0/30/21. Worked great in PvP late vanilla and into tbc.
---
Yeah, who wants to absolutely carry a team in BG's with their blessings/heals/invincibility?  That just sounds sooo boring.
---
This looks very helpful, thank you!
---
Holy crap dude. What a great theory.
---
Have you had any problems with addons and Linux?
---
You can get the EU starter edition for free and pay for a sub
---
Reno I’m assuming?
---
Im with you. Thats why i told OP to 2h tank it
---
For now I just want them to do Classic as it was back then. We've been crying out for this server for a decade. I would also like them to continue on to TBC simply because I've never really played it. After that though I'm very open to doing a Classic+ server or hell, let the playerbase make their own server like the guys at ascension. That would be pretty cool.
---
Show me just one tree/spec that is worse in 1.12. 
---
Then, even if you manage to make an argument for one, I’ll show how the vast majority are wayyyyyu stronger, and then, if you’re insisting on being retarded, I’ll talk about 8 debuff slots vs 16, and, if necessary I’ll just flat out dunk on you, by bringing up the massive buffs that come from the itemization overhaul.
---
You can’t win this argument by relying on your emotions and feelings. Sorry cupcake. Only FACTS and LOGIC work in these parts.
---
I don't disagree with anything you're saying, but I get the feeling you don't pug much...
---
The amount of avoidance you get from defense is laughable and completely negligible. The real benefit of defense is lowering the chance of being crit by bosses. Things get interesting with DW tanking, but for normal sword and board tanking you should keep shield block up 100% of the time. Shield block pushes not only crits off the hit table, but also crushing blows! AND THEN THE BLOCK PROCS REVENGE! Why would you ever waste a single ilvl on +defense when you can get literally anything else? 
---
There's my rant :\^)
---
Not talking about quality of questing or anything in this vein, but more in terms of player distribution. Durotar and Tirisfal Glades will be filled to the brim with Mulgore a dead-town. In Alliance's case, you will get a more or less even distribution of Nelves and Humans in their respective zones, with the weirdo's congregating in Dun Morogh.
---
Seriously? Knowing you single-handedly carried a BG team is insanely fun and rewarding.  A lot moreso than getting 8 killing blows, especially when the paladin healing in the back probably has more kills than everyone on the team because he survives and keeps the fight going.
---
Fair. I usually run with guildies or friends who are vanilla vets at this point.
---
I own one but ended up only using the 12 buttons, but it's definitely worth it
---
Gross. Now shove them up your horde butt.

I believe enchanting would be better as on of the profs for feral if your plan is bear.  Heart of the mountain trinket is super strong for them.  Can drop chanting after you have it if you want.

Yup. Stead area.

I heard skeletons disappeared after 5 minutes though... There's no way that they rebooted the server every 5 minutes.

Thanks!

Yes ... this was so bad that if you wanded a mob as it died right after a frostbolt/fireball it would literally disconnect you from the game. It was super effed up, but is working properly by the end.

had them for pserver guilds
---
Thank you very very much for this, it's really good to see this aspect of what has been done for once, and not hear about how it's not perfect and there's still X to fix. Good work from them and you!
---
How do you delete a previously created starter account?  I have two there from before the server merge. I can’t recall at all how I created them.   But I don’t see an option to delete them. 
---
How do I delete these accounts?
---
My b, thought this was about hunters like the rest of the thread.
---
Had a g600 for a good couple of years now. I can t see myself playing another MMO without it. I use all the buttons on it and it makes casting whatever I need super quick. The Razer Naga is also a good choice, but mine died on me and my mate has gone through 2 of those. 
---
The biggest advantage to me is being able to focus on my positioning and movement so much more and not  having to take my fingers off the movement keys. Great for PvP, especially as a melee class.
---
You do know the beta is over right? So we’re not even in the beta testing phase anymore. You’re hardheaded as fuck. One of those people that has to be right when they are obviously wrong? Must be a fun life you live.
---
How much? :)
---
...then hes dead.  Dies in opener if he doesn't trinket or dies after blind if he trinkets opener.
---
Only one of the two relevant ones is shutting down. The one that is shutting down is open source.
---
killing them before you have to do either
---
So would you rather they add expansions onto classic? Cause then they will just be rerelease the game we are currently already playing all over again.
---
Woof lol.  Outrageous.
---
My body is so ready for Classic Wow. 
---
I don't normally drink Mountain Dew, but there's some allure to just letting it go for a weekend and load up on Funyuns and drinks and go for it.
---
Let’s see you repeat your same shitty argument again please it’s cracking me up
---
Parru unless you have Setup in the sub tree.
---
Dude, all that RBG, I hope you're going to main a rogue with all that edge.
---
I don't agree at all that the amount of avoidance is negligible. 
---
Let me ask you this question- do you think an item that "increases chance to dodge by 2%" is a worthless tank item? That is essentially the same as saying "you take 2% less damage from melee attacks" or, in pre-raid gear, the mitigation equivalent to somewhere in the neighborhood of 500-600 armor. 
---
The [Deathbone Chestplate](https://classicdb.ch/?item=14624) from Scholo has 17 defense, which is equivalent to 2.04% avoidance (0.68% of each parry/dodge/chance to miss). It's also better than straight dodge for 2 reasons:          
---
1. Parry is better than dodge due to the fact that it gives you haste on your next attack.         
---
2. In addition to the avoidance, it *does* give you a .68% less chance to be crit if a hit gets through shield block. Given the fact that Blizz has confirmed boss parry to be 14%, you're  going to see something like 5 parry hasted attacks every minute from a typical boss. This will lead to bosses hitting you 3 times in a 5 second window occasionally, making your shield block ineffective for one swing. This is where crit reduction helps. It's not the most important aspect of defense, but it isn't useless either.          
---
That being said, the primary reason to use gear with defense is the mitigation. ~1% mitigation per 8 defense is nothing to sneeze at.
---
I took up skinning on an alt. Got so tired of equipping the knife after awhile. Just something to think about.
---
Entangling roots&gt; No action for 6 seconds&gt;Drop Combat&gt; Shadowmeld
---
Depends on if you PvP or PvE most of the time.  Parry only works from the front, and you shouldn't be in front of the boss.
---
"brainlet" and "redditard" are two extremely classic examples of cringe worthy shit reddit users say.
---
You sound like a caricature of yourself.
---
Free action potion or living action point...
---
Not much.  Probably a few gold if that.  Everyone will take alchemy as the non-labor intense money craft, which means plenty of supply for them.  Your bottleneck will be how quickly people can dig up arcane crystals.
---
There's also a page for that: https://battle.net/support/help/product/wow/181/878/solution
---
lol not even sure what that means but okie dokie.
---
&gt; This sub is hilarious, the attitude towards Blizzard changes so fast here.
---
What if different people could post and upvote different things, that would explain this unique phenomenon you're witnessing
---
I mean is sleep even viable ? Will I get guild invites or will they make fun of me for being a “sleeper”?
---
I remember intentionally doing only green and yellow quests because I kept getting my ass beat solo questing.
---
Yay they fixed the totem bug. I thought I remembered them being immune to AoE but my memory isn’t good enough to confirm and report it.
---
Parry because of parry haste.
---
No one levels as a tank, so good meme
---
Then play with default settings until you're ahead of the pack. 
---
If you can't play with default settings you should just give up now.
---
Are you able to kill them in resto spec?
---
I put it on everything.
---
I'm fine if it goes either way. Don't really care. Sperg is different from retard, in that the association with sperg is that a given person tunnel visions a minor detail/mistake, is overly obsessed with being right in how said detail should be, while not able to relativize that he's making a big deal out of nothing.
---
Must have happened very recently, same with summoned warlock demons. I saw the demon bug live happening on stream at the beta closing event.
---
Arcane Crystals were:
---
* ~18g on LH-ND
---
* ~35g on K3
---
* ~25g on Mannoroth-Horde
---
So the transmute fee appears to be only about ~25% of the cost.
---
It's been in the launcher for quite some time big homie.  Cant do anything with it except stare in awe.
---
This is why Intimidation + Scatter Shot PVP build will be more popular than it was already becoming on pserver premades. Intimidation -&gt; full length trap, and still have your Scatter.
---
The option has been there for almost everyone since the last stress test, not only that but the beta, even for people that have it, ended yesterday. 
---
Please blizzard, I'm begging you, disable this option until a few days before the stress test these threads are killing me!
---
Something must be wrong with your install then, we’ve been playing for about a month now.
---
Final day of Beta was the 12th.
---
If you did get an invite then it was probably for a Stress Test post Beta.
---
Sunder armor
---
There's a page for that: https://battle.net/support/help/product/wow/181/878/solution
---
Circle of Healing 😍
---
My bad, had no idea... tried searching =\
---
I thought that was the case, with different creatures having different resists etc.
---
I was 22 when vanilla dropped and rolled a NE warrior prot spec.  Tanked all the dungeons and off tanked MC, BWL, AQ40, and early Naxx.
---
Lvls 60 dungeons are really easy.
---
Range pull
---
Taunt
---
Sunder x3
---
heroic strike sunder
---
taunt if agro is pulled away from you.
---
That's it.  Its surprising easy.
---
I'm still not sure what that has to do with the recent issues/complaints surrounding Hunters. My point was that the class was functional and playable.
---
Did frost nova have a heartbeat? If so could just be rng releasing a small amount of mobs on the first heartbeat? Just a guess.
---
Luckily for you, it's not my job to educate retailers on how to get r14. Good luck with your grind.
---
&gt; reversed all those bans in April and haven't banned or suspended or even warned anyone since 
---
They reversed the bans but made it very clear, if you're using model changers from this point on *REGARDLESS* of why **you will be banned*****.*** [In their words](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/update-to-recent-suspensions/161149): 
---
&gt;Any future use of software that bypasses the security of the game client, regardless of intention or gameplay advantage, will be detected and sanctioned with increased penalties.
---
Wow no ones posted about this you are they very first!!
---
Yes I think 2% avoidance is trash as a tank item. You're almost never going to be bottle-necked by healing, you're going to be bottle-necked by threat. If you don't get hit and you don't get rage.
---
Crits sneaking by due to parry haste is a good point, but still I'd rather have stam to soak dmg spikes while producing more threat.
---
Warrior stance dancing!
---
I’m not sure why someone downvoted you. Yes you can google it but we have nothing to do until classic release other than chatting about classic. I’m a little rusty as it’s obviously been awhile but I believe there is a one handed from wailing caverns? Also, sfk has a dagger I believe.
---
I don't even set up key bindings at the start. They happen as I learn more abilities. 
---
Why waste time setting up bindings when you only have 2 abilities.
---
We are at the end. There is no more beta phases, the beta is over. They are throwing one last stress test in, not only to test the servers but to hype people into resubbing for it which works. After the stress test it’s just a waiting game until release. They will be sorting all the bugs out that we’re found in the beta portion of the test and polish it up. Then it will be release and whichever bugs are left will be faced by the players and dealt with. I can assure you classic will not release 100% clean, but the stress test won’t help with any of that.
---
As a horde player i can respect ironforge.
---
Nice.
---
oh fuck off loser no one cares about your pc bullshit
---
Ya wife picked a good race, mon. And ya picked a good wo-mon.
---
People shitting on this and forgetting it was 2001. There was no other game competing on cinematic or promises of immersion.

Well, it's been 3 months and not a single person using Lucid Morph has been warned, suspended, or banned even though the devs know it's been detected by Warden since before they released it.
---
Impossible to know since we don't know how strong the effect of layering will be at launch. If there are enough veins up for everybody, then you obviously want to pick mining. Skins are much cheaper than ore anyway, so they won't cover the costs of engineering mats even if you grind beasts 24/7.
---
238 gold per bar.  I ran a simulation.
---
I saw staysafe’s video showing imp leveling + dot/wand was the most efficient. 
---
How does this compare?
---
For sure!
---
I probably get a new one every year and a half or so. I never really thought much of it but it's at least great for how much I use it.
---
Worries about having stuff to do after admitting rushing past all the content in a week. Smh 
---
I miss when every gamer wasn’t a wannabe speed runner.
---
Is it wrong that I want a video of a paladin attempting to bubble hearth spliced with Walter Junior's driving lesson scene from Breaking Bad?
---
Super rewarding in group play, super dull when solo. That’s my memory from vanilla paladin play.
---
Tab sunder
---
Focus building threat on skull
---
Don't break CC
---
Learn what mobs need to be CC'd.  And kill order.
---
Advanced:
---
Learn what mobs can be skipped.
---
Learn different runs for BRD and other such higher end zones.
---
Also try your best to not develop carpal tunnel.
---
Just wait until TBC. Problem solved.  Now pallies are useful for 2/3 specs and somewhat viable for a 3rd spec.
---
Honestly I love the nostalgia for vanilla/classic; but it has some serious diversity issues in builds that didnt completely get solved until WOtLK.
---
Ibdid blacklights, so I'm no better 😱
---
In the 1-30 range, it's an identical spec/playstyle to Staysafe's video. However, he prefers to keep the imp instead of swap to Succubus.
---
It doesn’t really work that way though, fire can resist ice/frost no problem which makes no sense to me
---
Just play on EU. You'll be happier without the ping deficit. They'll be plenty busy.
---
I wonder if the Dragonmaw Orcs were supposed to have sworn allegiance to Thrall earlier in development, because this trailer only showcases Horde races and thatd explain it if the Horde was meant to have dragons like in Warcraft 2.
---
We have no idea what dragon that could be. It looks most like Sinestra.
---
Usually it's all discussed ahead of time. Everyone will know their job.
---
just 6 days before. Jesus.
---
I believe they said it matches their 1.12 reference client, that doesn't imply anything about whether something was intended or not. This is why it's important to look at how hunters played during the course of retail vanilla wow and to a lesser degree, TBC. 
---
Also you'd think the wording of the patch note in 1.10 would mention that trap and scatter would now share DR because that is a pretty big change to the class. It only mentions trap (freezing trap wasn't DRing with itself).
---
um I think if I swing a sword at a wolf it will definitely not bring its claws up and parry my attack, no
---
Wait... you don't DPS with your butt facing the target ricocheting arrows off of the walls?
---
The magic? Yes how about such shitty itemization on gear that paladins who wear plate have to wear cloth as healers to be the most effective.
---
Time to take off those rose tinted goggles you crafted with Engineering and smell the Tauren manure.  Vanilla is nostalgic as hell but it has a ton of diversity issues in builds along with poor or non existent itemization for the builds it does have.
---
Jesus christ. It's been a naaru this whole time.
---
No, that was 2019 years ago
---
And impressive guide also aesthetically pleasing
---
wat
---
On the one hand, I want to point out that you can always bank those BOPs until you swap professions.
---
On the other hand, if everyone followed the groupthink on this subreddit, we'd all reach 60 with either herb/alch or herb/~~skinning~~engineering, wondering where the hell all our ore and crafted BoE gear is.
---
I say enchanting it is!
---
This site lists quite a few effects that weren't in the game. Take clumsy and horrified for instance, they definitely didn't exist in classic. Fear, howl of terror and death coil were all classified as fear effects and shared DR with each other in vanilla. They were also dispellable. Death coil wasn't a horrify effect until 2.1.0 and at the time it was the only horrify effect in the game. [See here.](https://i.imgur.com/xcIZNyj.png)
---
This site also lists 'shielded' which is both not a crowd control effect, but also isn't a separate DR tracker in classic. Shielded DR wasn't a thing until years after when they removed the cooldown of power word shield and the weakened soul debuff.
---
Pacify also isn't its own effect in classic for instance, whatever that is.
---
Asleep. Another effect that isn't on its own separate DR tracker in classic. It's a unique effect, but it's classified as an incapacitate effect together with the effects I mentioned above. That's also what charm is classified as for example.
---
You're right about some abilities having special exceptions though.
---
Alright good to know. I’m all for trying new things. 
---
I’ve leveled a lock once in vanilla and another time in cata. I used to level with voidwalker but it seemed slow back then. 
---
I can see the viability of both. I just remember the imp dying a lot. Voidwalker never had enough damage. I also wasted a lot of time on drain soul when I should be wanding. 
---
I’ll def be playing way more efficiently now.
---
I mean, from a roleplay perspective it makes sense that caster/healer stats are primarily on cloth gear, with a handful of rare pieces of plate with those stats.
---
Link to guide is broken
---
1. Sunder Armor
---
2. Curse of Recklessness
---
3. Faerie Fire
---
4. Curse of the Elements
---
5. Curse of Shadow
---
6. Winter's Chill
---
7. Improved Shadow Bolt
---
8. Deep Wounds
---
9. Taunt
---
The rest are:
---
* Thunderfury (this is 2)
---
* Thunderclap
---
* Demoralizing Shout
---
* Hunter's Mark
---
* Corruption (one per warlock that is Nightfall spec)
---
* Shadowburn (though not really)
---
* Shadow Weaving
---
* Mindflay for Shadow Weaving
---
* Expose Weakness (Hunter T2 8/8)
---
* Garrote (only there for the opening before everyone can push it off)
---
* Later you'll have Ignite, Fireball, and Improved Scorch, though Fireball usually gets knocked off
---
* Nightfall (the weapon)
---
* Judgement of Light/Wisdom (situational)
---
* Gift of Arthas
---
&gt;  gold supply will be low too.
---
I know that no matter how many times I remind myself, I am not going to be prepared for a WoW where gold is scare again. I wonder how much inflation vanilla actually experienced from gold sellers.

---
I think if you just drop the whole "stam stacking" thing then your argument makes more sense. You're not really going to run into that many situations where you're picking between stam and def on pieces of gear- they tend to come hand in hand. 
---
I think your main point regarding threat vs. mitigation is a good discussion for tanks to keep having, but I think it's misplaced when trying to give generalized advice to someone starting to learn how to tank.  
---
I would love to be proven wrong on this, but I have a pretty strong suspicion that threat is really only going to be this big of an issue in the best progression guilds on a server. Most players will not be in guilds that require consumes/world buffs and most players are not going to take the time to learn how to fully optimize their classes. 
---
Most guilds will be worried more about just filling raid slots than any sort of actual optimization- 40 people is a lot of people. 
---
If you're not actually struggling to maintain threat, then there's no real reason to trade mitigation for damage. In general, keep your healers happy and only switch out pieces of gear if you're actually struggling to hold onto a boss or if your dps is having to hold back- that would be my advice. 
---
I'm going to play fairly casually and my expectation is that I'll have one or two try-hard fury warriors keeping me on my toes, but otherwise, threat will probably be less of an issue than just staying alive.
---
I mean yea. My kids are dogshit at all the NES and SNES games.    Modern gamers do suck.
---
Modern games suck.
---
That's how people illegally hunt boars here.
---
Reinforced bull bar on a pick up truck and they drive at the boar full speed.
---
Hmmm, others are able to access it. Try the [direct link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qdUs229_XvkR1NCeTrJkybL5BDXGIh7q/view)?
---
It's so obvious yet I never pieced it together.
---
Not the only example with Ragnaros! A tiny dude can block a huge molten lava hammer with a wooden shield.
---
&gt;Just use TBC ~~talents and abilities.~~
---
I like how people are still treating Blizzard like the good old Blizzard of 2005. HA HA HA... The beta ended, which means that they're DONE with 1-40 bug fixing. Now they're moving onto the endgame content, which I expect to be just as buggy as what we currently saw in beta. And that's exactly how the game will release. Sorry guys, no more funds allocated towards classic, we have mobile games to make.
---
Yet you do not provide a single armor set as an example that is better than Judgement. I'd vote Pally T4 as my absolute favorite tier of all time, but I can get behind saying Judgement is the best overall.
---
only way to see if leeway is wrong is to recreate these type of videos, doing the exact same pulls.
---
I intend to drink approximately a liter of strong coffee a day, sleep for around 8-9 hours, play for 7-8 split into two sessions, and use the remaining time for errands and cooking.  Basically my normal weekends except for 3 weeks.
---
Why is it illegal to hunt boars there?  They breed like crazy.  Better hunt them now before it's too late.
---
That's not my point. I know the China has the most speakers, but English is the most *widely spoken* language in the world. Why are you trying to fight me on this? You are literally speaking english right now, not chinese. Almost all of reddit speaks english. It is the language of communication on the internet.
---
Yeah I never got into private servers much so I'll just be going off memory lol - also probably going to dualbox so might not hit 60 for a few weeks.
---
this
---
Daoc rvr was perfect
---
You don’t need to be Prot to sit in defensive stance with a sword and board either. If he’s new to it and with a random healer it may be worse to just go 2h. That works if your healer and dps now what they’re doing. For learning it may be better just to go defensive so you aren’t dying every pull.
---
Why would he think glowing fire hands are fear?
---
All good - still 1 stress test left!
---
It’s the reason I don’t use mine anymore. Drove me nuts.
---
I only drink coffee for the nap. For everything else, there's adderall.
---
Warlocks use drain life instead of wanding at later levels? Why?
---
Yes! Good reference.
---
He was having issues holding threat at low levels, sword and board aint gunna help that
---
mage AoE grinding was fine in classic beta though? the first player to level 30 used aoe grinding
---
Since you seem like a big 502 fan, I have a question. Just bought one and I love it *except* the mouse wheel feels very loose. Often I’ll scroll down with it, and it will scroll back up a little bit when I’m done, like it’s a free-spinning wheel. 
---
Is that how it always is, or did I get a bad mouse?
---
As someone who actually played a Hunter in classic, and not on a private server, the doomposting is overly dramatic. Hunters are easy to play and incredibly fun. Make friends and you'll find groups and raids. You need to be extra personable, friendly, and courteous to stand out because the class attracts the most retarded people in the game. IMO this class has the second highest skill ceiling in PvP, second only to druids. It has a complex PvE raid rotation that will keep you engaged.
---
I did. It was. . . bouncy.
---
I forget if cast bars were in original WoW, but in arena in later expansions,  a lot of people interrupt as soon as they see a cast bar start going up.
---
It's an easy way to juke out inattentive players. 
---
Or fake cast half a fear, cancel it, then cast immolate to bait a kick.
---
Midsummer Fire Festival started near the end of the last Stress Test. The Shoulders gave 2 armor and were obtainable at at least level 15, if you wanna corpse run to 4 high level Eastern Kingdoms zones. I did the quest to visit the fires of all 3 friendly capitals and got some neat brews that make me breathe fire, FYI they are incredibly loud. I forget if the Kalimdor quest gave the helmet or the robes.
---
Tossing a Blossom into a fire gave 3% crit for an hour!
---
Parry for sure. It doesn't activate a Warrior's Overpower and gives your reduces the time before your next auto-attack by up to 40%.
---
I second this this. Yes.
---
That's badass
---
I like dark purple tier10 more
---
Not a weakness but elemental mobs are programmed with high resist or immune to their element. That's why you cant be a fire mage in early end game classic.
---
My favorite part about this is that it is almost scene for scene identical to the official WoW intro cinematic.. but just a shittier version.
---
Imo one of the reasons wow was so successful was that they started marketing it YEARS before it came out. I still distinctly remember my Warcraft 3 jewel case having a two page spread of the Tauren shaman sprinkling magic dust in the wind with nothing at all but “world of warcraft” on it. No description at all.. I hadn’t even gotten my wc3 into the CD player yet... 
---
But I already knew I had to play that game
---
 It's difficult to allow some small changes and not others, and I don't think the value gained by including an in-game calendar is worth what's at stake.  It's easy enough for someone who wants such a calendar to use an addon.
---
IIRC, going from Pokemon, Fire does increased damage to Ice, it's Water that has the effect
---
Yeah I don’t think they’re bad, they’re just the least good. In 5 mans I find them the most fun healer to play as well.
---
Goetia here. Thanks Dive for putting this guide together!
---
If you’re asking reddit how to find a top guild they don’t want you
---
if you did ANY research at all on this subject instead of trying to be right all day long you would realize that you should of stopped typing a few replies ago
---
Ever tried to argue with a pot head that weed isn't always a miracle in every single situation possible, won't cure all diseases, and isn't the cure for world hunger and peace? hyperbole aside, WoW is an addiction, and other people planning to invest a LARGE portion of their time to the game might secretly feel some shame knowing they spent enough time in classic to learn 2 languages, 3 instruments, and get into top 1% physical shape, not exaggerating that for some that would be an understatement. Just being honest.
---
But you didn't argue, you just disagreed without any reason.
---
Chris Metzen would be the one to know/decide.
---
Havent tried in beta only pservers.
---
At least he has chicken.
---
You wrote a full paragraph and never addressed what phase we are in, if not beta. I can only assume you ignored it because there is only one answer. Beta!

I'm skeptical about that being sustainable, you might have to supplement with time spent purely farming, to the best of my knowledge if you do 30 minutes of pvp and 30 minutes of farming you may end up with more honor and more ore, it's a min-max thing which you don't have to care about.
---
awesome thank you 😃
---
WoWInterface has a Classic section, and on the Curseforge website you can sort WoW by 1.13.2 (does not work on the Twitch App)
---
Actually, it really does. You don't really care if the dps pulls aggro, you care if the HEALER pulls aggro. 
---
By taking less damage, the healer generates less threat. Also, you can shield bash stuff that's not casting. Hell, you can shield bash stuff that's not even a caster, and it's both more rage efficient, but also more incremental: a lot of mobs, you don't need 15 rage worth of threat to hold aggro, but you might need 10.

Shields really help a lot in terms of keeping stuff off the healer. Mainly by not requiring them to do healing nearly as early, giving you time to tab target everything down.

The general rule is battle for &lt;5 mob pulls. Demo for &gt;5 mob pulls. The rational with battle is that it buffs your party members thus causing threat.
---
I used to play combat in PvP. You can still stunlock using adrenaline rush for 1v1s, and in a group setting you're still just "damage dealer." The combo for stunlock is (stealth) cheap shot, gouge, adrenaline rush, vanish cheapshot, kidney shot, ss a bunch of times the eviscerate, blind, restealth, cheapshot, gouge then by this point you can just fight them normally. :D You have to hold your stuns until the last few seconds though so you dont go out of energy.
---
A lot of them do, but they never played hunter in vanilla or forgot. 
---
Hunters will still be great in the right hands. The meta will be different than p servers with more focus on survival talents like entrapment, but hunters will still do well.
---
&gt; when your tank accidentally pulls 3 packs at once.
---
Or when you get a tank who endlessly chain pulls pack after pack, expecting healer mana to last forever.  He never reads chat so he can't see you saying "OOM!"
---
The lack of balance is charming in it's own way.
---
The final guide:
---
Use the stress test on 25th of july. Customize your add-ons, key bindings and in-game settings. On 13th of august you can create your character and copy the needed folders in the wtf directory.
---
&gt; Is a Gnome Frost Mage a good choice for someone who has never played classic?
---
That's one of the best race and class combinations in the game for PVP and PVE so for sure.
---
Go skinning and tailoring. Make a bank alt you can mail things to for disenchanting.
---
No one ever said it wasnt beneficial.  Its not mandatory.  5 out of 70 something bosses doesn't make dwarf the best priest.  Ony will be a damned joke in classic due to the 1.12 patch.  A JOKE.  Humans in the long run are better priests for PvE period.
---
Just curious, which one is the main gaming monitor? With those angles and the position of the keyboard it could be either
---
Green droprates increased last days? Any agreers
---
They're top tier what are you on about
---
So, for anyone curious. I picked a single pedal up for $8 just to try it out. It has a slight lag to it but I really like it. It's binded to stealth on my rogue and travel form of my shammy/druid.
---
Yeah, what is this "more alive" thing? People play on the EU realms from all over Europe and even from Africa.
---
It's definitely the one on the right.
---
Might steal this
---
seems odd logic. I for one wont play retail. high chance I would play BC if they re-release
---
Well I can certainly notice an extra 120 ping.
---
If you don't share your google calendar with your raid leader, are you even playing classic?
---
Ogre's strength (not ogre strength) is very  sought after. It's a powerful recipe primarily because it's very cheap to make: neither kingsblood nor earthroot are super valuable herbs, and it stays relevant for an incredibly long period of time: there is no +15 strength elixir, so you are using it right from when you first get it, up to the 25 strength elixir of giants at level 38. One of the most expensive for it's level recipes in the game. 
---
I don't even know that it's worth, because I have so few sample points on mature servers. It's tough to get. 
---
Fortitude is much more accessible but still very valuable. Fortitude is an incredibly high volume consumable, useful for every class and spec at every level from 25 to full clear of all current raid content.  So you won't really corner a market. you will likely always have competition, but it's very valuable to make while leveling: you are never going to walk past any of the herbs this is made from, so you are likely to have a small supply with you at all times while leveling.  
---
Mongoose... I don't actually know. Obviously you want it, but the databases suggest it's got a 2% drop rate off of a couple specific non unique non elite mobs in felwood or azshara, and the mobs also drop raiding consumables (demonic runes), so supply of this might be high, if those drop rates are accurate. Powerful, possibly not scarce.
---
Limited invulnerability: I don't actually know how scarce or expensive this is, but the potion is obviously super useful for pvp and pve. I would expect to have trouble acquiring it. 
---
Swiftness: very good for both pvp, and leveling. It is a lot easier to level alchemy with this potion. 
---
Mighty rage: also looks to be farmable if database drop rates are accurate. I wouldn't worry. 
---
Greater stoneshield: I think this is obtainable outside raids, but it may be tough to get. Very useful for tanking. 
---
The flasks: well, obviously. 
---
But while leveling? In order, swiftness, ogre's strength (skip if you are a caster perhaps), fortitude, limited invlunerability.
---
you also want FAP, of course, but that's a vendor potion. And if you see frost oil in Alterac, obviously buy it, but that's again, a vendor potion.
---
How is imp vw working in beta? I figured the classic immo dot dot wand imp drain soul was the most efficient grinding xp. So now drain tank with succ is best now?
---
if its not in addons will pop up

Hopefully this game will go the route OSRS went
---
Skriðdrekinn, that's awesome and unintelligible. Ironically it fits a gnome!

"Sucked"
---
It was BIS at it's time. Nothing, and I mean nothing around at that time compared. We've came a long way.
---
Not that many ores around. You outlevel the zones way before you get your mining level high enough to proceed to the next mineral.
---
Also due to engineering being the most valuable profession (In terms of benefits, not gold making) even low level materials go for a decent price. Whereas there is no point in picking low level herbs that don't give you any skill.
---
I consider myself a good cook, and I still use my insta thermometer for all meats.

Got it setup and ready, its not a hard concept. Dunno why kids are surprised
---
Ahhh gotcha!
---
...I should have tried elemental in AV.
---
The enchants will have 0 impact while leveling. Only the high end weapon enchants does and no one will have them on low level accounts for months.
---
You are going back to 2004 sweet child. Lmao it will be a wild ride for you
---
Cool stuff! Assuming you're Carmond on the kitty haha
---
I like healing though.  Also I mained priest forever.  My main flip flop is between shadow and warlock mostly.  I dont think I'd care for shadowbolt spam in raids, and I prefer healing raids, but I like shadow more for pvp and warlock seems like it'd be really similar but more involved/interesting.  I want to do everything, so I'm having a hard time deciding.  Warlock has the 'its something new' factor going for it though.
---
By the way, in the guide you wrote drain life doesn't deal threat for the healing, but isn't that false?  I've read elsewhere that drain life gives threat for the damage, and then threat again for the healing.
---

This is pretty cool. This should have 2k+ upvotes instead re-used crap memes. I can never fully understand pleb logic.

You should gather prof and  get a guildie to tailor shiz for DE (and other guildie craft shiz from your gathering prof)

---
Have not confirmed myself, but this CoC bug may have involved the strafing bug that was hotfixed toward the end of beta. The character was doing a hard 90 degree turn on strafe (improper). Im guessing this affected the calculation of CoC's cone.
---
Anyways, hopefully its fixed, but it would be good to get confirmation from someone on this.
---
&gt; But since you have to be standing still to auto shot, is there any leeway at all?
---
The concern about leeway is that players will be hitting you as you try to reach a range where you can use ranged attacks.
---
&gt; Does leeway still take effect after the target is wing clipped and slowed?
---
Yes
---
&gt; Can you really use a speed pot to run over a trap without triggering it?
---
Yes. Anything that gives at least a 60% speed increase is enough to run over a trap without triggering it, though it's not easy. You have to be at a very specific range from the trap (changes based on what speed bonus you're using) and only move in a perfectly straight line (no mouse moving at all).
---
&gt; Could a druid in travel form do the same thing?
---
I don't think a 40% increase will let you cross enough distance in 400ms to accomplish this.
---
&gt; How bad is hunter pet responsiveness?
---
It's pretty bad, but we don't know what it will be at launch.
---
&gt; Could this cause your pet to continue attacking and break your trap even if you macro'ed fd-&gt;trap-&gt;pet passive?
---
Well, you want to put your pet on passive first in that macro anyway, so probably not.
---
&gt; Any chance this gets reverted?
---
No, none.

---
Why would player behaviour be different here than on private servers when the game is 15 years old?
---
Most posts seem to asking if enchanting is viable for gold making. As opposed to a means to a end.  So all responses are the usual " it's a sink bruh..."
---
so you're going to play Hunter and roll against 39?

Thanks for the post! I’m very unaware of the lore from the Warcraft games so these are always enjoyable.
---
Ah but bears know what you are doing
---
That guide is for hypothetical main tanking. You won't ever need that trinket. Read the guide and find the part "role in raid". You will be 3rd or 4th tank and you don't need any defense gear for that. Dps gear is much more important for feral druids in raids. 
---
There's no such thing as a tanking druid. Only feral druid and you need to adapt to the best suited role.
---
Still not sure why people dont just spend the same amount of money on an mmo mouse with 4x the buttons.
---
and rogues have both stealth and combat control.  
---
If a rouge can find somewhere they can pull squishies in groups of 1 and 2, they can grind non stop by simply shutting down the mobs ability to inflict damage.
---
Removing most of each classes toolkit definitely added to the complexity of each class.... not
---
Druids do fine until something goes wrong and everyone's taking damage. That's when you find out Healing Touch is too slow, Regrowth is too expensive, and Tranquility isn't as powerful as you thought but it's one hell of an aoe taunt.
---
The bug fix reported in this post is likely different from the one you are referencing. The bug that causes warlock demons to be *completely reset* (as in, new names and don't know any abilities) is still in the classic client. The bug that was *fixed* is the one that causes pet abilities to be removed from the pet bar.
---
It's not so much mechanically difficult, it's that it punishes you for not paying attention to your gear.
---
Not only is your damage very very gear dependent, your resource generation is also gear dependent. 
---
Beyond that, it has a huge incentive to pull multiple mobs, as it's best abilites early on (cleave and rend) both don't scale at all: once you have rended a mob, you can't rend it again. It's your BEST ability, but it has very limited throughput of rage---&gt; damage. 
---
Beyond that, you lose resources out of combat but don't regen health in combat, so you have an incentive to push yourself low on reosurces and at risk of dying. 
---
And your class buff is quite costly in resources to keep active, as it's very short duration and also punishes you for eating every second pull. 
---
They also don't play well with instant damage classes, as they have a lot of damage over time early on (rend, deep wounds), and you cannot even control WHEN you apply deep wounds. It's very easy for your leveling partner to clip your dots if they are just autopiloting with say, a mage or a rogue. 
---
And if someone pulls aggro off of you, it can be difficult to cleave multiple mobs properly, as you have no control over WHEN you cleave. it's not an instant, it's a "once every 3.5 seconds" thing.
---
You also have to balance ending fights quickly, to get charge off (charge generates a lot of resources), and pulling mobs into other mobs so you can cleave both of them without having to face tank 2 mobs from full health. you also have to balance charging in to generate rage, with not wanting to fight 3 mobs at the same time, so they are very much worse in areas with tightly spaced mobs.
---
They also hate casters as their damage mitigation is largely physical and they don't have good access to magic resistance, and they are not good at repositioning casters, as they have to actually run in (and risk aggroing stuff) to actually reposition a caster by interrupting them. 
---
They also have no mobility skil and their damage is bleed damage, so they are horrible against water elementals and not particularly good against mechanical monsters or fire elementals. 
---
You can do stuff to really mitigate this. For example, one of the best things warriors can do is level with another warrior: if you just pull 1 mob each, and stand next to each other, you can both rend the other's mob, and you can each cleave the other's mob. It's just free damage. you don't even have to be grouped, in terms of mechanics. And then, the whole problem of hating closely packed mobs becomes vastly less relevant. 3 mobs? just split the attention of them. 
---
Overall, they are..... the most punishing class to level badly, except perhaps for rogues. But you can very much do it, and if you are doing it well, it's very powerful indeed. Warriors can do a lot of sustained dps under ideal conditions.
---
It might be but it’s definitely not definitely. If that were my setup I’d use the left as it’s in a much more comfortable position due to the angle. His keyboard is directly between the two, so any angled monitor is going to be more comfortable to view than a perpendicular one. If he uses the right monitor, the far right side of the screen is significantly farther from his view than the far left side, that’s pretty awkward if you ask me.
---
Ah.. are you splitting hairs or what?
---
The “punishment” is still part of the mechanics.
---
You don’t need to understand lfr fights. If you don’t know fights in bwl (a few anyways), aq, or naxx it’s gg wipe.

Dungeons in wow classic are for level 48-55. There's no late or level 60 dungeons. 10man don't exist.

If it's your first time playing wow vanilla, there's zero difficulty in the content. It's a big grind. You grind your blues is low level dungeons. You grind your gear in raids. You grind resistance gear for hier tier raids. You grind bg's for pvp rank. That's the content in Vanilla.

Razor thin margin for error.  If you pull a couple more mobs than expected, you're likely dying or needing to spend more downtime to replenish health.

Staying on top of first aid and cooking really helps out, moreso than any other class.
---
Not really. Have they tested it with different crit values?
---
Blood elf pally was master race. Change my mind.
---
Yeah honestly in that level range I think it's totally up to preference. Imp performs very well at that stage because of the dps, and buffs as you mentioned. Him being ranged doesn't make any difference however.
---
Discussing with Staysafe about this particular issue, he had said that he found similar results using both Imp and Succubus, but that he personally preferred the imp (basically for the same reasons you listed). I tend to lean more towards the succubus side :)
---
Maybe, but an intimidation+scatter build really gimps you against melee.
---
I agree with you on pre-bis lists. I see a lot of lists that over-value def and don't seem to value strength, agi, or hit at all- which doesn't seem great. And to your point, if you're a warrior going for stockade pauldrons or even stonegrip gauntlets- good luck also getting an epic mount. 
---
I'll be excited to see how things play out in regards to threat on Classic. I haven't tanked a WoW instance since Cata, so I'm sure all of these pserver folks have a better idea of the meta these days than I do, but I think that people may be underestimating just how "casual" many will be compared to pservers. Even suggesting that healers needed to go farm consumes or get world buffs would've been a foreign notion in my old vanilla guild. I'm not sure how things will change this time around.
---
Especially these days
---
People used potions in vanilla ?

Shhhh he diesnt know what hes talking about.  Let him be

not zero, but not very significant. Before level 200 enchanting, I think the best you can hope for is +3 stat on a particular item.

There might be 7 meme specs in Vanilla, but there's only one meme class.

I’d say no, just extremely time-consuming and not at all casual. Can it be done casually? Of course. But warriors are one of the trickiest classes (imo) to push to the maximum efficiency.

Even with batching?

I want one of these pedals for music. Bind the record / stop record buttons to the feet and it would make a great pedal for home studio recording.

I might have missed if it is mentioned but MARK MARK MSRK. The easiest way to tell if you are tanking it right or if your not is by marking all the targets. Skull the dps target, X the second kill target and just assign the other marks for cc if needed. I just bind it to the numpad so I can quick mark on the way to the next pull.
---
Yeah, That's not true. 
---
I've wasted a few years of my life doing not a whole lot other than getting super lit, and staring at walls and shit with my friends. We had a great time, But it was an absolute waste of time.

Having fun, doesn't automatically mean, hey man you didn't waste your time. u had fun. that's not how life works.
---
The problem with WoW players is the "single player doing everything" mentality. If your class can't pwn asses then it's boring. The reason why I personally roll a Holy Paladin is not to solo my ass through content but to duo with my friend improving our leveling experience by a huge margin. There are many synergies that a Paladin can provide to certain classes and guess what a Paladin pwn asses as a support class 2vs2+. We've handled many 2-4 people our level or higher, my friend and I. Due to the superb tools a Paladin provides to keep his friend a live. All other classes are used to the "use cool downs, burst the bastard down." tactic which works in 1v1 but doesn't work, ever, in my duo experience. That feeling of working together with my friend to quest with ZERO downtime and pwn Horde asses left and right feeling invincible is FUN and filled with exhilarating experience.
---
The fact that Paladins are amazing single target healers with Blessing of Freedom (my hunter friend loves it) and the cleansing and all these abilities; it really makes playing a Paladin a beautiful experience. They go after your DPS friend? Heal, Heal, they almost got him? BoP his ass, they realize they can't kill him then come to you. They try to take you down then they realize your DPS friend is blasted their asses with damage. They almost kill you? Bubble, now they have to switch to your friend. Heal his ass, cleanse, BoF. Your bubble is off and now they come back to you? kite them, stun, heal yourself with shock or whatever. A Paladin is not a boring class, it's boring for boring people who wants to solo all the way. Every class is boring in my opinion if you want to solo all the way.
---
I feel like it is useful to mention one thing.... which targets should you call? 
---
Casters. Casters not only are great for dps to start on (because if they pull threat it doesn't matter, the caster's probably going to get interrupted anyways), but the interrupt itself generates a lot of very efficient threat. If you don't have to charge through several packs to get to a caster, it's almost always best to mark the caster and focus it, while you build threat on the other targets. 
---
It also builds a consistent pattern your dps can get used to. If, on every pull, you tell them to focus the caster... they will get used to it and start doing it without you having to mark every pull.
---
I’d say it shares the throne with Bloodfang, but that’s a personal opinion I guess.
---
That's... Creepy... I'm at the bar, just say hi and buy me a beer like a normal person
---
Actually this would be awesome for a ctrl and shift plus mmo mouse
---
I think rogues' bonescyth is kind of boring. The rest are memorable though.
---
What makes a good tank is knowing what to do when shit goes wrong, don't be tank that gets complacent and loses focus. You need to be ready for unexpected situations, You can save a lot of wipes just by being alert and responding quickly.
---
&gt; If no one has gold it really don't matter what you pick.
---
It actually does. Disenchanted stuff has no vendor value. But disenchantable items do. And on higher level money lost by not vendoring stuff really adds up (especially if you DE weapons and plate/mail gear)
---

&gt; It also seems to me that Classic Warlock leveling is extremely interesting because it's not so clear-cut as "use this pet and do this" for all circumstances. It depends on what you're doing, what playstyle you're good at / understand better, etc.
---
This is what hypes me up the most to play lock. The choice to use quick DoTs for low hp mobs, a full set of DoTs for high hp ones, the choice between wanding or draining, the choice between Fearing or DPSing, and the choice to pull multiple mobs for faster kills at higher risk of death. All of these choices will affect your leveling speed, and for me personally I want choices to matter. This is why I dislike the draintank playstyle: it takes away the most impactful choice (to multidot or not).
---
You weren’t in the 1% but 0.05% (and among that group you were again one of the most efficient player if you’re not telling lies)
---
I mean is this that hard to understand that you had an experience totally different than average player? That while you were #3 of honor during first week of honor, the vast majority of players weren’t even lvl60? That when you looked for PvP group with your Naxx stuff that nobody had, it was easier than random joe with some blue and one epic from Alterac?? That having the opportunity to play more than 40 hours a week and any days of he week made a great difference? Do you acknowledge that it sound a bit strange to have such a vague idea of you played time? (Like you didn’t check nor did it made an impression on you?)
---
And yes I totally « wasted »  time in Vanilla doing stupid stuff for no gain like 99% of the player: making movies, jumping on top of bank while making joke with friends, trying to climb mountains, etc and the fact you tell this as insult really proof you don’t understand casual player at all.
---
(But I
---
**tl;dr:**
---
* (Almost) Always be in Berserker Stance.
---
* Always be the one chasing mobs pulled by dps.
---
* Pull from range to give dps time to get aggro.
---
* Skill order after pulling is generally Taunt&gt;Mocking Blow&gt;Challenging Shout&gt;Frantically Type "LET ME GET AGGRO"&gt;Let your healer die&gt; then complain about how shit the healer is
---
* Never save taunt for pulling aggro from your healer.
---
* Try and manage your group by kicking bad dps.
---
* Get a threat meter addon so you know who to yell at.
---
FTFY

Bloodvine wont be out till zul gurub , so it wont be you
---
Seems about right, yeah.
---
Lot less hookers than I thought.
---
What is the point of this when there are like 100 like it? 🤔
---
Ehh. It was 3 years before the game's release, they could do whatever at that point.
---
Hunting is timegated by seasons
---
If someone buys it you didn't sell it too high.
---
Cuz MC is sooooo hard lmao  (Holy btw, so don't even try for that low hanging fruit)
---
I have an RP-ish story planned out for a Troll Shaman; I'll be running to Mulgore RIGHT AWAY to start her journey there for the full effect. I'm fucking excited.
---
Briefly, should you care, her story is that her mother was killed when she was very young, and she was abandoned [somewhere (still working out details)], found by a passing Tauren who took her in and raised an a Mulgore village amongst the Tauren. She sees and refers to her tusks as "horns", which I think is a super cute and endearing idea. ~~uwu~~
---
I would be interested to hear the logic behind going furor before natural weapons. 
---
* Furor gives you 40 energy every 2-3 mobs. That's enough for one extra claw. If you are shifting anymore than that then you are probably wasting your time drinking from being oom. 
---
* Natural Weapons +10% damage and OOC will give you that same free claw that you would have got with furor.
---
Don't forget [Wingblade] (https://classic.wowhead.com/item=6504/wingblade)
---
&gt; you're going to be extremely broke all the way to 60.
---
I watchet Preach stream. He picked enchanting and disenchanted everything. By the level 40 he had 10 gold!!! Seems like no mount to lvl 60 for him.
---
Paladins will be way higher for alliance pop imo.
---
That wasn’t hostile at all, or did he edit his comment?
---
A dub dub
---
Yusssss
---
The WoWer’s type of exercise.
---
he was probably using birdshot tbh, a human could easily eat a birdshot shell and be fine, let alone a bear.
---
Which literally have 0 impact. Also considering even getting to 200 will cripple you. You will not be as high level as you could have been and you won't have as much gold.
---
I mained one...
---
tirisfal is awesome you can easily hit level 12 there then go to silverpin get up to around 16/17 run to barrens do other quests and be in ur 20s by the you leave
---
I had a friend who would do open mics and the bars in Iowa City when I lived there a while back. He had a loop pedal I think it's called. So he would play out the rythm on guitar and hit the pedal to loop it in the background so he could play over the rythm as if there were two guitarists almost. Not the same as stop/record or whatever but it was cool as hell. I don't know how convenient it would be to start or stop recording via pedal instead of just a button but for some reason reading your comment compelled me to share this anecdote.
---
&gt; all avoidance has diminishing returns 
---
Not until Wrath.
---
Only one I ever had issue with was wands, for obvious reasons.  All the melee classes I actually enjoyed a brief tour in a grey-level area with a grey weapon of the type I needed skill in; Just auto-attacking things to death until I was close to whatever the cap was.  If you were way behind you gained weapon levels really fast, against weak enough foes you still hit nearly every time, it wasn't an issue.
---
Man I must be living in the berenstein time-line because I don't remember anything about wow until frozen throne.
---
The wolf swipes your incoming sword attack, thus sending your sword in a different arc than you had planned for, thus it parries.
---
The wolves train for this shit.

I'm not sure. I always just /invite
---
Sure isn’t
---
those mobs do not have normal run speed. Mobs do not have 1 movement speed, they all move at a different speed depending on thematics, name and/or type. Anything with "runner/strider/etc" will be much faster than a similar mob without that name. ALL tallstriders and elk types are faster, roughly 40% faster based on them being able to catch up to you with aspect active. Most humans run about the same speed as you, most beasts run slightly faster than you but with variances in speed depending on type. Etc etc. They're far from being "normal run speed".  
---
Both mobs in those clips are moving fast enough to avoid a trap
---
3 square meals a day, with protein and carbohydrates a priority. 6-8 hours sleep.
---
yeah and thats kinda wrong in my opinion.
---
hunter was exactly the class that wasnt easy to do well with. which is why "huntards" were so popular back then. if you didnt know exactly what to do you can mess up greatly, pet control or on point kiting is just one of the things to easily fuck up whole raids on your own.
---
But working for one hour is a lot faster then farming gold for a token. All depends on how you value your time
---
My comment was targeted at a specific post, im very well aware about early raids being easier due to 1.12. It's something i often think about but im not ready to argue about it.
---
How are you supposed to "out consume" everyone if everyone is using all the consumables? You'll still be dead last
---
A [little stand](should be pretty cheap). The problem is actual music/voice mircophones are just microphones, they don't come with a preamp/dac so you can't just plug it into a computer (technically you can plug them into your mic 3.5mm socket but it will sound like garbage). You need to buy a usb audio interface and decent ones start at like $300 so yeah, that's why people generally stick to cheaper ones like yeti's that come with all that built in (and really you're never going to notice the difference in a streaming setting).
---
&gt; Inb4 guilds pour gold into their first mage
---
Is that just an example or is there something special about mages and enchanting?
---
How many times did he accidentally hit the NOS?
---
very grateful you took the time to do some math on the figures i gave, that's something that's lacking in this subreddit for sure.
---
[here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10JTjoPlF51MuVX6BAyRCTSg7kJTnqnuPlEGgmVHo36o/edit#gid=1468718791)'s the main source of the numbers i gave for that comment.
---
this particular sheet is just basically a direct import/analysis of Joana's guide, and claims a total of 16,630 solo kills from 1-60. is it really so unreasonable to you that less than half of those are beasts? i feel like that is a somewhat fair estimate.
---
10/10
---
Simplified version because I can't be arsed to look up the actual formula: 
---
Before patch 1.8, damage from your sinister strike would be calculated as follows:
---
SS base damage x AP x speed of your weapon. Slower weapons meant more damage since the multiplier was higher. 
---
after patch 1.8, it was just SS x AP, omiting the speed of your weapon from the equation. 
---
And since Sinister Strike adds damage to your normal weapon damage, the higher that damage is, the higher the sinister strike number would be. That's why the sword set from ZG is pretty garbo for Rogues - the mainhand has super low damage.
---
If classic is success then go for BC, but i can't help but see the amount of difference in opinion of what should be released, changed, classic+ and every kind of brainless arguing surrounding these.
---
The way i see it is as follows and IMO the best and only option. 
---
Success=TBC. Classic should only get fresh servers from time to time. Blizzard should be very very careful with what they do, since community split can hurt a game with factions far worse than people seem to realize.
---
I don't think BC turned everything to shit, but as much as we loved it, it still was the first step towards that shit.
---
This is just speculation.
---
Blizz doesn't want to say how their crit aura reduction formula works, and it is much more realistic to assume that they take 3% of everything instead a flat 3% from base and a flat 3% of the auras.
---
Tests done showed a 30% drop in crit chance (of all sources combined) in Classic vs private servers.
---
For a Fury Warr with 50% crit , it will be a 15% crit loss...WAY MORE than your assumed 6%.
---
One thing that is CLEARLY off on private servers, and everyone can see it, is player crit chance. IT IS JUST TOO DAMN HIGH.
---
So, I'll probably be on the side of a 30% loss in crit from people testing.
---
PvE as a paladin can be pretty lame but it builds a pathway for an unstoppable burst damage spell power full tier 2 shockadin god that can provide strong heals in PvP. Combine holy shock with Zandalarian Hero Charm and full tier 2 with a Lok’amir and you can one shot with a crit. You also are a strong and versatile healer with high survivability.
---
Shockadin PvP is the most fun you can have on this game imo.
---
Could be locks also. They are usually the ones hitting 60 first.
---
In theory it might aswell be Hunters or any other class that hits 60 pretty quick. But usually it's a caster or healer that goes for enchanting.
---
No, absolutely not.
---
Shit I forgot about Luffa! 
---
Tanaris, right?
---
TRUE original post by /u/Sequisha.
---
Fear them both, dot'em up, and enjoy the two HK's
---
takes an evening to do some 5mans and gear up a tank, a lot of good tanking items come from quests.
---
Yep. These fixes are for super fucking common and generic problems, basically anyone who played even a little bit of pservers or remembers retails knows the value of skull of impeding doom or nifty stopwatch in WSG, as an example.
---
The game needs another 3 months of open beta testing. They're missing GLARING details and polish. They have to essentially undo all the patches and fixes they implemented against vanilla items in later expansions because players were exploiting them due to how powerful they were.
---
Wait until TBC than.
---
Okay, here we go:
---
I think your CB/Hemo build is mostly fine, I'm not a big fan of imp. KS myself so I'd use something like [this](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/305320105011-3-500253000332121) - there is also an argument for improved Expose Armor over Murder, but it's debatable. 
---
Dagger builds are infinitely harder to do well in my experience, there are so many variations and little nuances that can change based on personal preference that it's hard to pick a definitive build. You might want more experienced rogues to chime in here, but these are pretty ok as baselines: 
---
[SF Dagger](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/305320105021351-3203-5502)
---
[Prep Dagger w/o imp. Sprint](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/305300105-3203-55020303030212)
---
[Prep Dagger with imp. Sprint](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/305300102-320302202-55020303020012)
---
this last one I'm not extremely happy with, but again, it's a decent baseline to build upon. And of course, builds can change depending on your focus - these were designed with mostly solo play in mind.
---
unlikely
---
But Attack power isn't effected by the speed of your weapon at all.
---
So if its SS X AP weapon speed shouldnt matter. If you have 800 attack power youll have that much no matter what weapon speed you have (barring the stats on the actual weapons themselves).
---
Wasn't the restriction on disenchanting added in TBC, in Vanilla you would disenchant all items at skill 1, right?
---
Unless you have a reason to skill up enchant you don't have to if you mainly want to use it for disenchant, you can stockpile the mats you need for leveling enchanting and spend the gold needed for rods and skills when you have your mount.
---
Personally, I just want to get into the level 46+ items as fast as possible, don't really care about skilling up enchants until I get to max level.
---
You can also get engineering goggles for extra stealth detection, iirc. But detect hidden might be enough. I played for a couple of months with a level 39 twink, and fighting rogues in AB was my favourite thing. I even befriended an undead rogue twink from the opposing faction after we met each other so much. I’m thinking of naming a char after them, Cologne.
---
you made a thread about forcing streamers together on the same server claiming everyone wants this when in reality it's a small, loud minority confined to /r/classicwow 
---
now you're saying you're just joking and you're just trying to be an edgy memelord 
---
which is it :s 
---
I think the scary reality you're not willing to accept is that not everyone shared your irrational hatred or resentment of streamers. most wow classic players are, believe it or not, adult, and don't feel this strongly about someone they've never met or cared to research beforehand
---
Can confirm; Mained a paladin 2004-2007.  
---
As soon as I heard that manaburn sound, my eyes would roll into the back of my head, because I knew there was nothing I could do but shield and run away before I went oom
---
We caught the mistake 7 hours ago man lol.
---
pre purchase the meth for bulk discounts
---
I remember people started avoidance tanking on rogues with like 99% avoidance at the end of tbc. Blizz couldn't have people having fun with off meta stuff so that's probably why it was nerfed
---
Thanks.
---
It's what I needed on a Sunday : a good laugh:)
---
The sad thing about 40 man raiding is that - regardless of guild - there will always be that 10-20% of players that aren't as committed and don't play as you might like.  His advice on how to get a raidslot as a hybrid is essentially to display the behaviours guilds want from their raiders, and this will be good enough because so many players don't do that.
---
However, if you're going to do everything right, wouldn't you pick a spec that helps your raid the most? :thinking:
---
I use a 12 button with claw grip, I just use my pinky as a stabilizer,  how are you holding the mouse? Just front fingers?
---
No sound
---
Culture changes. Complaining won't change that. You must simply shrug and accept it like the rest of us.
---
Yeah you're right. How'd you know about me so well?
---
Haven't been playing since 2003 Beta all the way to Sapphiron in Naxx as a holy paladin in Silent Requiem on Mal'Ganis as one of the top 3 Alliance guilds.
---
No I just made all that up. Quit while you're ahead. This entire post is completely against you, as you can see. No one agrees with you.
---
i use my thumb for stability
---
Yeah... 20-30 people? Are we supposed to be impressed?
---
That's a weird, distorted way of looking at it. If they had done it properly, the game would have been the same, you just would have had a better computer and internet connection playing it.
---
It's no different than being able to play Quake 3 at 200fps at 4k today. You couldn't do it in 1999, but the game hasn't changed.
---
We interpret what he wrote differently. And huntard didn't come from it Beeing difficult IMO, it was semi easy to f up and even the best did it here and there. And attracted some people who "had a harder time realize things". Rolling on everything and ninja didn't come from Beeing hard to do ok. 
---
But leveling, basic PvP and such was pretty easy to do well with. But it also said second hardest to be great in from the beginning. 
---
So you are correct. We just read it differently.
---
Thank you. I thought concussive was something else than stun.
---
You should have seen the nost AQ40 release or Nost shutdown event
---
where did you get them? and how are they called? nerd pedals?
---
You missed the point
---
Tbc was good but flying ruined the world. That unforgivable and should never be considered again
---
Both dkp and loot council have downsides.
---
yeah really easy to get a 300+ fire resistance set by running dungeons and doing quests
---
Basically the other guy is one of those "omfg warriors in full naxx gear do the highest dps so why do rogues warlocks mages and hunters even exist lmao" people
---
once you get the ZG trinket that resets aimed shot/multi/arcane etc you can destroy people. hunters are a great bg class and having one is always useful. you will also get gear more easily than other classes in raids due to less competition
---

---
If that's how they want to play, more power to them, but it's just not a level of nuisance and dedication most guilds are going to require or most players are going to accept. The content in Classic just doesn't demand it.
---
As a priest I usually use a down rank of heal because my health doesn't need the highest rank as I level. It helps I'm undead so I don't heal much anyway.
---
We maintain different definitions of 'playing the game'. Being ported from one place to another and automatically grouping with others has, in my view, nothing to do with actually 'playing the game'.  
---
&gt; If you are dumb as a rock then you might think that a simple guild bank or calendar will have a similar impact on gameplay as the dungeon finder tool. 
---
Replace 'dungeon finder tool' by 'finding people and travelling to a dungeon', then replace 'simple guild bank or calender' by 'dungeon finder tool', and I welcome you to WotLK: the peak of WoW and the beginning of the slippery slope of QoL and cosmetic features. I assume this was the point that Blizzard's popularity has led to an influx of high-potential, Ivy-league developers who all had to put their 'mark' on an otherwise mature and balanced game.
---
Yikes dude. All im saying is hemo sucks in raids. I don't know what you're on about.
---
Ain’t nobody kicking a shaman out of a group
---
Basically the DR thing only matters at the highest level of duelling.  Outside of that... It will barely affect you
---
I'm not even gonna be speccing scatter shot!  Fuck tha police!
---
Yeah, that is exactly what I am saying. How much AP influenced your damage used to be influenced by weapon speed prior to 1.8, it was in the damage calculation equation. Now, the speed itself doesn't matter, but the damage of your weapon does - and since faster weapons generally have lower damage, they make for crappy mainhands for rogues.
---
Uhhm. Why is the forsaken a playable race and not called the scourge?
---
of course the content doesn't demand it, you can clear it all with full meme-spec raids, that's not the point. for a guild that wants to do fast clears it is not optional.
---
Honestly don't bother and just go feral. You want to keep intellect gear as you level, sometimes even cloth if it has decent int on it. Just throw a few +intellect pieces on and you can heal leveling dungeons just fine. Your basically just rushing to heart of the wild because it buffs your intellect and that will get you through the 40+ dungeons that can get a little harder. After 40 definitely go into resto like you have here.
---
Lol, so what? Its good that hybrids are weaker than pure specs, as they should be. I only play hybrids, mostly shaman and druid, and I dont play healer at all, and the only version of wow where my preferred playstyle is viable is in vanilla.
---
Can't play Counter strike anymore.
---
When i was younger i was fairly decent. (Not tactics or strategy. Just fairly quick on the draw and decent aim.)
---
Now I just get annoyed by my lack of aim and skill. And since i cannot achieve my previous level. (Thanks to work and kids) I simply cannot enjoy CS anymore.
---
No ok you're right, some people are using the beta/stress test to map out their leveling route. Is it the most productive way to test out the beta, not really. Is it completely useless, not really. Non paid testers are just going to play the game and report bugs they randomly encounter, they're not going out of their way to run into a way at every possible angle for 2h straight to see if there's any clipping.
---
When it comes to the stress test, though, the only metric is the number of people. Cram as many people as you can on the servers, see what happens. If they shut down some of the servers during a previous stress test it's only because not enough people were logging in, not because people weren't "behaving"? What does that even mean. The expected behaviour during a stress test is "play as if this was launch day". Which is what people are doing.
---
You can make a ton of Goggles to help level engineering.
---
Imagine thinking hunters are bad in pvp. Boy you're in for a surprise.
---
Yes. Just focus on a few pieces with int, you don't want too many pieces of gear to carry in your bags while leveling.
---
Currently on henhous*. *=e
---
I was more thinking you just drop skinning once you have enough greens.
---
That’s the thing with hybrids though. You can fill a role when others slack or miss raids. For example, I know it’s a meme spec but I tanked as a Paladin and feral Druid (non-progression) when I was a dedicated healer because a tank or two didn’t show. Do you not raid? Trust an outsider? Or rely on a hybrid. My guild new I was always prepared and always was willing to respec to fit the guild needs at the time. 
---
That’s what he’s saying. If you are a hybrid in Vanilla, if you want to shine, you’ll need to always bring your best. It’s challenging, usually there aren’t a lot of your specs and you can be valuable to your group or raid. If you know what you are doing you can usually beat more than half of the people or are phoning it in, not paying attention or simply not going all out. 
---
Raid and guild leaders appreciate it and you are more likely to secure a spot and be able to play the style you want to play with preparation, dedication and a good attitude. Just overall, don’t be a dick and try your best.
---
Thanks! You helped a lot!
---
Great stuff. Is there one for druids?
---
Plus you can more easily tell if DPS are the problem. X is targeting the mage, he messed up.
---
Lmao what? No.
---
What about the priest bug that caused them to be immortal in BGs sometimes?
---
What the fuck? So you are actually saying that a guild bank or a calendar has the same impact as the dungeon finder tool? We all know that the dungeon finder tool also teleports you to the dungeon, but thanks for clarifying ... I guess?
---
I'll repeat:
---
&gt; If you are dumb as a rock then you might think that a simple guild bank or calendar will have a similar impact on gameplay as the dungeon finder tool.
---
So yeah ... I don't really know how to talk to a rock, so I'll just leave it as it is then.
---
That's because the one they have is needed for buffs.
---
&gt; Highest base agility, which shines at lower levels 
---
It's the smallest of differences, like 5 agility or something..
---
&gt;All of the racials are usable. Extra dodge, nature resist, and faster dungeon corpse runs all come in handy.
---
Extra dodge is pretty useless for a hunter given your pet should be tanking mobs and a warrior should never reach you. You shouldn't be dying in dungeons, either you'd feign death and res the healer via engineering or the healer will be soulstoned and res you anyway.
---
&gt;Starts with a bow, bow sound &gt; annoying gun sound  
---
&gt;Starting zone will most likely be less populated and is lovely to boot  
---
&gt;Easy access to tons of pets for getting all the proper skills  
---
&gt;Easier access to Humar the Pridelord and Ghost Saber
---
Literally so minor lol
---
&gt; Flipping when jumping   
---
&gt; Saber mount is the best Alliance mount   
---
&gt; SM is fun. SM + prowling cat = OP Aimed shot ganking, eye of the beats fuckery, eating/drinking while stealthed, point guarding made easy, hiding from pathing mobs and players, safer spawn camping 
---
I'll give you those ones, so basically roll nelf if you want to grief people, otherwise go dwarf
---
Disenchanting all your greens/blues is gonna cost you a huge amount of gold. Half your gold is gonna be from vendoring that stuff.
---
While levelling at least it can be worthwhile to try using cleave and HS instead of sunder for aggro generation.
---
Related: I want to play [not the cookie cutter speccs], can I still level up?
---
No, you should uninstall the game and kys.
---
Talented it’s a 20% chance to stun. A death sentence for a rogue caught out
---
Holy shit that's terrible.
---
Great job.
---
That's not what I'm saying at all. They don't have the same impact by any stretch of the imagination, but they fall in the same category of cosmetics and QoL UI features. Anyways, if you have to resort to putting words in my mouth in your rebuttal, then I agree to leave it as it is. Rock on.
---
A model of Herod as he is the Chad of vanilla

You could also write a macro like this to save on button space:
---
/cast OPHeal (rank 9) 
---
/cast OPHeal (rank 8) 
---
/cast OPHeal (rank 7) 
---
/cast OPHeal (rank 6) 
---
/cast OPHeal (rank 5) 
---
/cast OPHeal (rank 4)
---
...etc.
---
I used to macro most max rank spells like this except for the ones that didn't have their mana cost reduced with rank so that even if I was too low on mana to cast the highest rank spell I could still cast *a* spell if I needed to.

The only people with hatred is the meme spec crowd. The only one complaining here is you and the other meme spec defenders. 
---
Nobody cares what you will play, you meme spec people can form your own guilds and play however you want. Stop crying that not everyone will take you for their group, it's your choice what you play and it's other people's choice whether they invite you or not.
---
Shoulda woulda coulda.
---
I was debating between a druid and Hunter alt with mining/herb.. basically something easy to level while hopefully making good gold. Still not sure.. lol
---
Thanks for the tip. Had not thought about that one. Could be useful.
---
r/iamveryrandom
---
yes for sure
---
Have you confirmed that this works in the classic 1.13 client?
---
For a rogue roll alliance get the tunic of westfall then faction change of you want horde.
---
You're wrong
---
Thats a level 60 spec, for leveling you should just go full standard feral.
---
Completely disagree. New ranks of both Healing Touch and Healing Wave tend to by far more healing than you want when you first get them. Keeping the highest rank and previous rank around is a good idea. Plus this way you're getting your key binds ready for 60 and don't have to retrain muscle memory.
---
check my response to nigmastolemybike, you mind find it even more useful ;)

And he has several more active right now that I won't be revealing. He even managed to sneak into Onslaught (famous Pserver guild) and steal all their boss guides and 90-hour leveling guides for us (though the most useful was all the dungeon XP research they've done).
---
In our Discord he showed that the moderators could ban one of his accounts every day and he'd still have enough to last for the next two years, all with unique names, karma history, and of course, old enough to bypass the 72h /r/classicwow restriction. They've also never been linked by IP or email address, so even Reddit admins can't do a thing. They're all part of a massive karma manipulation service he built for some lobbying company.
---
"The whole argument was pointless" I agree but you're projecting really hard here.
---
Do you know if there's a VoD of this? I'd be really interested to see it if possible!
---
Well it goes into feral up to about lvl 40 before switching to resto
---
dude...
---
Thanks. I've been wanting one for a "push to talk".
---
same
---
But if everyone thinks like this then there won't be enough miners which means the prices for the mats will be much higher. 
---
My philosophy to make gold is do what others aren't and I don't think that many will want to mine.
---
i have "try for free" (as in retail wow) and no play button... do you have to have an active subscription to retail at this point?
---
Yeah but you're missing out leader of the pack, natural shapeshifter and natural weapons. They all boost your leveling process while the resto tree does almost nothing. You can heal your friend just fine as full feral as long as you keep an intellect set in your bags. The whole point of 1/29/21 is to have HOTW and Nature's swiftness at the same time, and you wont have that until you hit 60.
---
It works on 1.12, You could test it on Retail/BFA but all the api calls still exist so i see no reason why it would not work.

---
People are down voting you for saying "you seem angry" it's quite passive aggressive.
---
Sodapoppin is the last person people should watch for druid pvp knowledge lol dudes been playing classic for like 2 months and not even at 60.
---
fucking bubblehearth pussydins
---
i still love you fellow classic fan
---
So which spec should I use? I’m at 21 now and am still only in the feral tree so I won’t have to respec.
---
After taunting, always remember to follow up with a high threat ability like Sunder Armor or Revenge. So before you taunt always make sure you have enough rage for a Sunder. This will keep aggro on you.
---
Bananadin tho
---
Because he's saying gear meant dick on Hunter's. That's why you did fine.
---
Didn't know. My sarcasm detector is broken.
---
if the conditional statement is not working on classic then that is a bug and i imagine will be fixed eventually.
---
Cool. You are free to raid with your meme buddies all you want, make your own guild and stuff.
---
I am leaning towards something like the below. I like to think about it as the 40yo hardcore schedule.
---
* 10PM-6AM 8hrs sleep.
---
* 6AM-7AM Some muesli with low fat milk for breakfast and 30min of light exercise and a coffee (raid fuel!).
---
* 7AM-8AM Travel to work.
---
* 8AM-12PM Work
---
* 12PM-1PM Lunch, a nice wholemeal ham and salad sandwich.
---
* 1PM-5PM Work
---
* 5PM-6PM Travel from work.
---
* 6PM-7PM Dinner (a chicken salad perhaps) and get the kids to bed.
---
* 7PM-9PM Solid hardcore wow action.
---
* 9PM-10PM Get ready for the next days wow packed adventure.
---
* Repeat points above.
---
Dodge.. party activates riposte
---
Yes. 
---
Depends on the class, it's painful for hybrids because primary stats don't adapt according to your spec. It's also quickly very expensive if you respec often. 
---
Yes.
---
Are those MMO gaming mouses worth the investment? If so any recommendations on what ones are the best?
---
That’s just how some people enjoy playing this game, and the type of person who play like that is much more likely to scan Reddit all the time for Info
---
The bandwidth of your connection has nothing to do with your ping so that is about the worst argument you can make.
---
But the speed that strider runs at should without a problem trigger the trap. And it did all the time when I played on my hunter.
---
Hell yeah. That was cool
---
Enjoy being upset when meme specs inevitably get invited to your raids because you can’t find 40 players who take the content as seriously as you and also aren’t already in better guilds than yours
---
Also me, a lazy drunk lol
---
I remember something about blizzard stating that they wouldn't allow conditionals in classic because it allows for too much automation. They don't want to allow one button rotation macros and that kind.
---
&gt; I've tried searching
---
(x) doubt
---
There literally multiple youtube videos on the top of google search for "duo leveling classic wow" as well as forum posts...
---
Guild Banks would have an impact on the economics portion of the game. People will create alts, with alt guilds, just to have 98 extra bank slots (per tab). That's free bag/bank space for an adventure capitalist.
---
Wait, is that controversial? Never heard of that, pretty convinced it's normal.
---
They’re pretty nifty, you don’t need to get the ones with like 20 buttons on the side though; you’ll barely ever use that many binds as a Druid
---
Sorry man, but you’re wrong here. You should use the ranks most suited to the health pools you’re healing, which often means downranking, especially on your big heals since they often over-heal massively when you get a new rank (not to mention the mana cost will ruin your mana pool in a few casts).
---
Pretty much every warrior will get ww axe, most at 30. It’s such a strong weapon that it’s worth the time and effort it takes at lvl 30
---
I enjoy using them very much. I recommend corsair scimitar.
---
The only upset people are the meme spec players lol. You are the minority, I've played vanilla from open beta to TBC launch, raided to the end of AQ40, it's will be even easier to find normal players than it was back then.
---
Nobody cares about you guys, stop thinking otherwise.
---
I could be wrong but I faintly remember a dev saying that they wouldn't allow for conditionals in macros because it allows for too much automation. They don't want a button to play the game alone.
---
It shouldn't be too hard to write an addon that lets you use conditionals again though.
---
You’re taking yourself way too seriously. I mained hunter through vanilla, my whole class was a meme and it really didn’t matter. People cleared raids on computers that couldn’t even handle orgrimmar. People keyboard turned. People showed up without ammo or consumables and the content was still doable. My guild in retail is a bunch of IRL friends and we are planning to do 40 man content as a 25 man group because it’s just that trivial and we’ll get geared faster with less competition. I just find it hilarious that people are taking 15 year old content so seriously when classic itself is a meme.
---
There is really 2 things to pull from this video, #1 the info provided here while directed a meme specs is really a blanket for anyone who wants to raid. #2 Bear druid isnt a meme spec, the community as a whole needs to get past this idea that its sub optimal.
---
Sorry, poor choice of words.. your Blizz Launcher?
---
You can get everything you need from PvP but the road to rank 14 or even rank 10 with reputation grinds is a long one. Raiding will make the process significantly smoother and can provide a few superior pieces.
---
You can respec for gold. All that is required is placing the new talent points. You only need to train spell ranks once even if you lose that talent based skill. It's worth specing for leveling and paying a gold when you hit 60. It will save a LOT of time. If you get indecisive in the future, the cost of a respec will get out of hand quickly
---
This absolutely will not work.  CastSpellByName was protected back in 2.0 and they are definitely not going to fix it for the exact reason that you can use it in if functions to automate what spells you cast.  
---
Yes it works in 1.12 on private servers.  No, they aren’t going to unprotect CastSpellByName.
---
It'll be 5-7GB in size. But if you have that kind of connection yeah it'll be painful. Luckily like others have mentioned you can pre-load it.
---
Yes but the size of the downsides matter...
---
just freshly downloaded it today!
---
Tbh if you’re rolling on a PvP server, having an alt is good purely for those times when you’re being camped by a level 60 and your soul is destroyed... just relog to a diff toon for an hour or so
---
I think its target markers in the key binding menu.
---
Not a bug but by design. You can do some conditionals but it's very limited - [combat] for example. [Here](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Macro_conditionals)'s the list.
---
NPC ping pong lol. Nice idea.
---
Loop Pedals are it's own thing and is a guitar pedal like any other, this though, is a different things. I get why he wants it, when recording alot of guitar / bass by yourself, there is a lot of putting away the pick, marking the place to start recording in the DAW (Digital Audio Workstation), pressing record, hurrying to pick up the pick, and getting ready to play, rinse and repeat.
---
That's why pedals are a thing for guitarist in the first place, in stead of knobs to turn. And, what he needs is basically a MIDI pedal, or just a pedal that an PC can recognize as a button, without any other musical relations. Easiest fix imo; getting a MIDI Pedal. Activate MIDI Learn in the DAW, hit the record button and stomp on the midi pedal you want bound. Done!
---
That aside, I enjoyed your anecdote. It's always fun listening to people react to the world I know from eyes that doesn't know it, if that makes sense. I just wanted to share my two cents on the subject. I have been looking into this Play/Stop/Record pedal setup myself, never actually thought of using in in a game, but that's pretty creative!
---
(Using a MIDI pedal would make it useful in music making ONLY, don't think you can bind game commands to them, but, with PCs, everything is pretty much possible if you know how........ Now I want to use my MIDI controllers, knobs and buttons in front of my screen for things in WoW...)
---
I think the name stays locked to you for some amount of time. Like an hour or a day or something.
---
Need to add in bubble next the hearthstone since it's a paladin.
---
this shows you do not understand my post at all.
---
the reason you cast big heals when the target has lower health rather than the top up method you are describing is because you cast much less often and can take advantage of ooc regen in combat due to the 5 second rule, if you heal the target at higher hp using downranked spells you cast more often therefore using in combat regen more often which will actually leave u far less mana
---
The face that every single comment in this thread is disagree with OP, who is absolutely correct not to down rank heals while leveling (which a crazy amount of new healers do because they hear that rank 4 heals are what people use in raids so they figure that is the correct heal to use), really goes to show the value of advice on this subreddit. 
---
You are being completely mana inefficient if you are downranking heals without +healing. Prevents overhealing- You should have waited until your target had less health so you weren't overhealing.
---
Faster cast- You should be precasting anyways
---
Only have enough mana for a lower rank of the heal- This is the only one with some merit, but if you are managing your mana correctly shouldn't be happening and unless that singular heal is the only thing that saves the tank from dying it is probably better to wait for your mana to regen enough to cast the max rank.
---
It definitely can be. When doing multiple takes for guitar / bass you can save a lot of time and putting down and picking up your guitar pick and getting ready to play by having those controls by your feet.
---
Thanks, it's gonna suck working while being half dead but I'll be playing on launch either way lol.
---
By far the best looking gear set in the entire history of WoW.
---
levelling up cast time means nothing outside of maybe pvp, in dungeons you could even afford a 5 second cast heal if you have a bit of foresight and precast/cancel etc
---
i don't think you understand how protected functions work:
---
&gt; API functions in this category are protected. This term is used for three main types of functions:
---
&gt;API functions that addons (or any other insecure code) can NEVER call.
---
&gt;API functions that addons (or any other insecure code) cannot call IN COMBAT.
---
&gt; API functions that addons can only call from a hardware event (i.e. the user clicking a button), but not from OnUpdate/OnEvent handlers.
---
CastSpellByName being a protected function is irrelevant when its called from a macro i.e /script or /run
---
Warlocks are both great and fun btw.
---
Of course you should be precasting but sometimes that's not enough. It's better to have choices in your bindings instead of going "oops tank died because my cast was 0.5s late".
---
a new rank heal will never heal 100% of a tanks health, maybe 65%-70% max meanign if you heal the tank around 30% heal its all good, then allowing his health to dip a bit while you regen using ooc regen means you are at good mana levels consistantly, why you woudl want to use a lowe rank that heals less and means you have to cast more which in turn means less mana regen i don't know. I think many people here have a big lack of understanding how vanilla healing and mana regen works
---
Yea I mean how DARE somebody want to play the spec that they want to when we need to have the OPTIMAL raid comp for the most CHALLENGING of PvE encounters in ANY MMO like... Molten Core, and Onyxia. 
---
The game isn’t even that hard, idk why people are so hostile to it, if the meme specs cause a problem that’s cuz somebody (more likely a lot of somebodies) in the group is really fucking bad.
---
Here's me tasting delicious leeway for the first time in person. Just keep your eyes on my wingclip icon being spammed in the middle of my upper action bars. I'm dodging his auto attacks while my wingclip is red and out of range.

---
Would you say the succubus comes ahead when you're alliance and play on a pvp realm?
---
You don't need to disenchant everything, you can still sell good items on AH and vendor items with a high vendor price. You can sell everything if you don't want to skill up enchanting, I'll probably not skill up enchanting, but I know I'll be running a ton of dungeons so I want the extra gold from large shards.
---
&gt; Paladins had every manner of "oh shit" buttons 
---
Like what?
---
I’m safe. The taunt was not resisted
---
you're welcome
---
With the launch at midnight, I plan to push it till 7am. Generally only water, might pop a energy drink in the first hour and finish it before 3am. Not much food, only a little snack at 6am to make myself sleepy. Will sleep till 1pm, light lunch and then just go for it till I get hungry. Will try to hold the 6 hour sleep pattern as long as possible and when needed will end sessions sooner (still wake up at 1pm).
---
You’ll be 100% fine. It’s not like there is 1 server either, there will be plenty of servers. And if your looking for a more laid back type of community, join an RP server. You don’t have to rp, but usually rp servers aren’t as hardcore with raiding and pvp and more accepting of all kinds of players.
---
Undead or Orc Warlock? I'll be rolling on a pvp server.   I change my mind every day.
---
How can you brake a sarcasm detector?
---
Press Esc and bring up the keybind menu. You can assign any key you like. I have mine on F1-F4
---
I understand you’re advocating having to be less spammy with your heals in order to use the 5 second rule, but you’re forgetting that the mana cost between ranks, especially, at lower levels, is exponential. The benefit of you delaying your heals so you can get a bit more mana regen (and letting your targets drop to a lower health) is not big enough versus casting a cheaper/faster heal. I’m not saying you should be spamming lower ranked heals, I’m just saying you need to adjust the rank of the heals you’re using to your mana pool and the health pools / damage intake of your targets, and only very rarely will the max rank be your best bet. 
---
The crux of your argument (maximising the time between your casts to trigger mana regen) is solid but you’re wrong in saying this means you should always use the max rank at lower levels.
---
Cool just what the world needed, another 10 min $$econd, w/e video.
---
Dkp is best for casual guilds and loot council is best for hardcore progression guilds. Loot council has the downside of corrupt people ruining the guild for every1 else, but with dkp billy the noob who is there for every raid can get the good stuff that would be better on any other member.
---
I prefer dkp personally since I am a casual but there are good arguments for both.
---
..Yes which still means you cant use them in the way you want to.
---
Nah, the real optimum is around 8. Don't listen to the motivational video bullshit.
---
Alright, if that's how you interpret it Ill let you be happy lol :P
---
Np man, you can play 1/29/21 for healing at 60 if you want to tank dungeons as well because that spec can do both as long as you just switch gear. But for strictly healing you can't go wrong with swiftmend [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zL0hZZxEfqeqMo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zL0hZZxEfqeqMo)
---
Hakurai’s guide does WW @ 36 I think, but uses nature protection potions self crafted. If you have help 36 is reasonable.  The period before this is rough. Corpsemaker is great if you can get it. Otherwise it’s slim pickings with a couple of vendor weapons, merciless axe and Bullova.  There is quest rewards early 30’s but they are really high 30 quest difficulty so it’s the same problem as WW axe.
---
There is a limited amount of bag space/bank slots to begin with. This creates a slight challenge for the player that wishes to have a bigger bank/bag space. The tailoring market would be completely dead if Guild Banks came into play. The importance and price of going from 14 to 16 slots or 16 to 18 bag slots is part of the end-game content. It's big bucks to get 18 slot bags in your bank; this is due to the fact that tailors can only make 1 Mooncloth a day from 2 Felcloth. You need 12 Mooncloth to make the 18 slot bag. You only need 1 Mooncloth to make the 16 slot bags, but that's still a lot of time and money if you're trying to build the maximum amount of room for your bank alt.  
---
Your bank will fill up quick with herbs, ore, quest items and sentimental items. There's only 28 initial slots. You can buy the other 7 bag slots for your bank, all 7 together cost \~110g total. You want more space? You work for it and at the same time are moving the economy.  
---
Say an actual "adventure capitalist" maxes out his first bank, but now also has 96 extra slots to play with? He's not the only one thinking of stocking up supplies for the next raid. Next thing you know, that guy along with everyone else is flooding the market with nature resist potions for AQ20; now making Alchemy less profitable.
---
Sort of but not near the end of the last one. You put on rejuvenation near the end of a pull and you might still be healing him at the start of the next one
---
Yes, I took a video game comment personally and it ruined my day.....
---
Guess I am the one who typed 10 paragraphs trying to defend my completely unimportant video game decisions. xD
---
*4 warriors and a shaman* wishes to know your location.
---
Haha worst redaction ever 😝
---
Idk I've heard from people who have beta access that private servers and the beta are actually really similar in feel. Balance differences won't stop people from playing classic over private.
---
There is all the knowledge about meme specs. They want to get carried.
---
:P
---
I love Tabasco on Lasagne.
---
We should be friends.
---
War stomp is real
---
Low effort. You are boring me, and your responses arent even clever. Zzzz
---
It's been like that for a whole. No servers up though.
---
another one of those typewriter-like keyboards?
---
ok i get that numpad is pretty useless, but no wrist rest?
---
Lol you must be alone.
---
yeah, come August first I will resubbing for the first time in 11 years :) exciting times!
---
EXACTLY, I upgraded to one 3 years ago after i had my 3rd naga die within 6 months. And i have never swapped back.
---
Probably just multiple different opinions from the same group. I mean no one has any idea really how the server dynamics will play out and too much of either crowd will probably drive out some of the others.
---
I feel like this post had to be a meme at this point... it can’t possibly be posted every single day for this long without some sort of concerted effort... can it?
---
If the ground is visible, it's not a lot of players.
---
this guy won't make it to 60 \^
---
I'd throw in a druid. Gives you versatility and a big dps boost for all physical dps. Plus having a flex roll who can also pick up adds if needed or brez someone is great. Synergize with your comp more but you do share some gear.
---
I knew the betas / stress testing had been going on over the past few weeks / months, but I was not aware up until today you could pre-install the client. :)
---
*squints*
---
That’s better
---
Most guests ask me if I do vocals or sing.
---
I just merely tell them I'm a quality geek and use discord/Skype a lot with friends.
---
I'm playing Gnome and still can't choose between Mage and Warlock. I'll be on PvE servers, and just can't decide. My hope is to do end game stuff at some point, but won't be a super serious raider.
---
Won’t be that bad, the streamers that got in needed their fans/donors to also be invited as a condition for them to market the game.
---
I made sure lol. It's an account from vanilla / tbc with not a whole lot on it. Super excited to get back into vanilla again!
---
Except scatter/trap is a fundamental part of Hunter PvP.  It wasn't intended and shouldn't be in classic.
---
&gt;I was used to my AE reaching farther and keeping melee farther away when kiting(not just warriors&amp;rogues but mobs as well)
---
Just to illustrate this, watch [Vurtne get almost deleted by a slowed warrior from a pretty insane distance](https://youtu.be/4sj21TAmQ-M?t=215).
---
Yeah, and neither were the 25,000 other people that have posted this exact same thing daily for the past two months... OR WERE THEY?!?!
---
I wasnt sure in what i wasnt going to play when classic launches but now im sure that i will play Warlock, thanks!
---
You would not have commented if that was true. I'm being entertained personally. Hope people like you will spaz out in game as well when they get declined group invites. Will be even more entertaining.
---
Never played mage in classic but I played warlock and the amount of flavour you get from class quests is great. Having a minion is also great for levelling. On the other hand, mages are famously good in vanilla and you get portals!
---
tl;dw: don't be bad
---
Can confirm, been fugged up by a lot of hunters in my day. Seriously Hunter’s are fiends in PvP!
---
Since I watched this video the first time it always reminds me of:
---
https://youtu.be/iGuuOdD6iY4
---
Man good old times
---
Bloodfang is BiS lookswise
---
&gt; you will also get gear more easily than other classes in raids due to less competition
---
Hunters on Alliance also have very little competition for loot in dungeons.
---
Except you can still DO any farm that ele can. It's just not as fast.
---
There was a post about it I'm trying to find it
---
Undead man! I've had an undead warlock since vanilla  and the class/race combo is so fun. Not only does it feel great thematically, the racials don't make that much of a difference really. Cannibalise is great whilst levelling and will of the forsaken is handy too.
---
The name is an unique identifier.
---
Invite, mail, whisper etc. It is all based on name.
---
Ofcourse it works to not have it unique by adding another unique identifier (like using battlenet tag) but then it need to be designed like that and it would be a lot harder to interact with people then.
---
Imagine thinking linking a wikipedia article is an actual argument. I'm out of here. It was fun, but this is getting nowhere.
---
My point still stands. If you dont want to play with hybrids then dont. But this hate for them speaks of serious insecurities on your part and thats a fact :P
---
Or an invite, trade or message. There are loads of reasons for unique names in games, MMORPGs especially.
---
Good one!
---
Have you read my post? Without jumping to conclusions and applying opinions on me which i have not expressed?!
---
I only said i would like to keep seeing the streamers interact as they have been in the beta.
---
Does not mean i would want to play classic with them on whatever server they would play in. Much like some are spreading the ''damned streamers ruining the classic experience.'' mantra.
---
I'm not even arguing, i'm asking questions and wanting an discussion on if it's for the better. Both for the players and streamer/youtubers if they focus their presence on one server.
---
The correct answer is always, it's on CD
---
Paladins can't tank....
---
I 1 It’s a system where after a boss kill, players bid (like an auction) for the loot. The money is divided between the rest of the players.
---
2 It’s a run in BRD where you jump down at Incendius, run along the edge of the lava (swim a little at times) and pop up where you forge dark iron bars, right before the Lyceum. So you only need to kill 2 bosses from there. There are a few terms like this. Jump runs where you do a jump to skip sections, particularly in Scholo and DM. Tribute runs in DM where you are not killing the guards to get extra loot at the end.
---
3 Yes, it’s exceptional with the crit. You’ll use it for a long time, you may replace it with Bloodvine set when ZG comes out, but may even bring it back once you start breaking set bonus up. Good for trash set as well.
---
4 Yes, mages can AoE mobs and skin. Hounds in BRD is a known mage skinning farm. You can sell your moon cloth cooldown. There are a few tailoring pieces that will sell but it’s not going to make you huge money. I find it a good flavour profession though.
---
The easiest way to verify this with a reasonably high degree of certainty is to run a macro like this through version 8.2 since the macro APIs are for the most part identical.
---
I think I'll do this, but I'm going to pick up engineering at max level (rip gold) and maaaybe tailoring+mining on an alt if I ever do one
---
Played hunter in vanilla, never played pserver and played hunter on one of my beta characters. It feels clunkier than i remember and solo you have a fair few active rotation abilities, but what I remember best was my shit aweful ui with every extra bar turned on and a move on absolutely everything. I had a shot to cure what ails you, in every situation. For me hunter never felt like dps. I felt like a swiss army knife for any situation that happened to do damage. For this, nothing has changed. Most of the problems effect high end pvp where people know how to abuse batching and your deadzone and frankly fixing any amount of bugs will not stop the odd tryhard of that variety mopping the floor with you. Wow is kinda rock paper scissors in class vs class pvp, but player skill has paper beating scissors all the time. You're still a monster for solo content, an amazingly efficient and effective farming machine, and just a pure fun class. They'll sort out some of the more egregious problems, but the ones they dont or cant will affect everyone not just you. And even though them there is plenty of room to shine as the utility class hunter is.
---
I gotta say this discord is really nice and keeps me questioning the class I've decided to roll on classic. I mean, I know I was gonna play lock, but I was 95% sure I was gonna go with the vw, and now I know I can have other options. 
---
Everyone is nice on this discord, thanks dive and everyone there!
---
- Owek
---
Where’s a good place to order one of these?
---
Friend: "You dude, I heard the high is so much better if you inject Classic WoW straight into your butthole."
---
Me: "I'll check the alley for some needles."
---
I'm just kidding of course, I don't have any friends. Just a bunch of needles and an infected anus.
---
1. Item drops and who wants it bids with gold to win the loot, loot master receives the gold and spreads it with the other guild members likely carrying the raid. Only done by established guilds who can clear raids with 25/30 and the help of the remaining dead weight. 
---
2. Lava runs are skipping the majority of BRD to get to the last boss/MC attune. DME Jump runs again are skipping trash packs to kill bosses quicker, usually done by a duo group of a good geared fury and a healer pref a Shaman for WF others can do this but that duo is best. Priest works well also something I did often on Nost for my epic mount. Very good gold farming but with the dungeon resets in classic will be less profitable.
---
3. No idea tbh
---
4. Tailoring you can make money with ZG sets, bags and other BiS items but tends to drop off as others are also tailors. Skinning is highly profitable if you can establish a mafia for Devilsaur which is highly unlikely unless you have network of players who understand this process already. This market will be dominated by the private server players and I do not recommend trying to contest, you can make consistent gold from skinning whilst levelling but I’d recommend dropping it at 60 for herb and try your luck with Black Lotus and other herbs of higher levels because these will have a more random swap and are less likely to be camped.
---
? You haven't made any arguments either, you just typed out your own problems.
---
Good Hunters NEVER used Scatter Shot before FD + Trap. You always saved it for after the trap as an interrupt.
---
Those years were all just practice for the real thing!
---
I already told you I am just baiting you into responding. If your mind wasnt fixated on trying to insult me and you didnt tunnelvision on that you might have spotted it :P
---
You should sleep as much as you feel the need to - don't set your alarm.  Go to sleep when you're tired enough that you can't push through anymore, and wake up when you're ready again.  If you're like me, after you get past about 6 hours of sleep and you wake up and are excited about something - you'll be refreshed and ready to rock.  If I had your schedule, I'd probably end up waking myself up after about 6 hours of sleep without an alarm - just with the excitement alone.
---
Excellent PvP build. Pretty shit PvE build though, no?
---
hey who told you I was depressed and trying to throw back to a better time? OP you don't know me!
---
You literally have no idea what the hybrid tax is actually about.  Pretty sure you never actually played during vanilla because if you did play a hybrid back then;  (I rolled 2 shamans on 2 different servers) you'd understand that the itemization is what allows classes to be VIABLE (not good) in raids.  
---
And I call bullshit.  If you played shaman/druid I'm vanilla.  You were 100% pigeonholed into healing.  I remember healing raids from molten core up to AQ20 at which point ITEMIZATION had been released that helped shore up some of the weaknesses in certain specs.  Namely I was able to go elemental since I had enough gear to support it.
---
I also remember having the freedom to finally enjoy Enhancement on TBC with the class overhaul to using dual wield, gaining a vastly updated talent tree, and not having to scavenge shitty rogue gear for dps.
---
Seriously it's like you people are permanently under a spell where you think WoW vanilla is 100% perfect.  Me saying it isnt perfect is not saying it's bad, just saying IT IS NOT PERFECT.
---
God forbid people actually enumerate the flaws in vanilla.
---
Yea I really am not sure. I just read a random comment that I can't find anymore which made me think this might work a bit differently.
---
This is the same way people used to solo dm tribute in vanilla im pretty sure
---
Progression content my ass....  
---
More like overgeared for the content, and using the world buff exploit.
---
Disagree. Stacking plus healing on a paladin will make rank one flash of light useable for a long ass time.
---
Christina perri?
---
I have taladril’s link. Thanks! Yeah a friend just messaged me the same spec just with Natures Grasp instead of wrath. Makes more sense. Thanks for your help!
---
Thanks for the info!
---
If your guild doesn't have a shadow priest, it's a good idea to have one provided they have 2+ warlocks. If your guild has 4+, it's almost mandatory, imo.
---
A shadow priest will have low damage, but when you add in the amount of damage they're "responsible" for from Shadow Weaving, they suddenly becoming one of the most valuable DPS additions to your raid. 
---
It's the same reason you bring other "meme" specs, or the reason you bring a warrior with Nightfall.
---
Sure, you don't need more than one in your raid, but IMO, the most valuable priests will be ones that make it clear they're willing to play both holy and shadow.
---
Exactly. If you already have a guild then the pace is set (you'll likely want to keep with them). If you're looking for a guild, there"s a bit of urgency since if you fall too far behind curve, it'll be difficult to secure a raid spot.
---
So it could matter depending on you goals and your situation.
---
Honestly, pretty bad on mana. Just down-rank everything and keep the spells coming, resto druids and priest will help pick up of the hps numbers you just help provide a buffer (aoe healing). (Honestly pretty much everyone on Horde does this early... another reason why ally&gt; horde pve.)
---
Priest maybe better 5 man healers but shamans are far more needed and wanted in 40 man raids. (3 priest can do priest jobs in vanilla, however, you want 6-7 shamans for shaman buffs. ) Honestly, shamans are probably the 2nd best 5-man healer, bit weaker early just due to mana issues.
---
If your group is pre raid farming try stacking melee (either rogues sapping, or one class with good cc). IF BoE farming, after getting a good amount of mp5, maybe the BEST 5man healer.
---
Hell for 5 mans is paladins with aoe damage, they are just bad at it, but most of the time are really good early as they can just spam heals. Druids have hots for aoe and a LONG ST heal cast, and their mana efficiency comes later with an idol. Also no rez, so they are probably the worst 5 man healer.
---
I bet DM releases as it was in 1.12
---
So much salt? Maybe you need to re-evaluate what being salty is.
---
i wish it was only two years i wasted on private servers...
---
EU here still nothing
---
This a mage makes your life great. and while people are always like priest wand... you give totems while drinking.
---
I loved the feeling of helping the group and making everyone better that Paladins used to give. All the different blessings, auras and judgements that you could give out and help others with. It was like you were an inspiring figure guiding people with the Light, superb class fantasy that I just don’t feel from retail pallys. Too much holy warrior and not enough warrior-priest.
---
Minor tweaks to streamline fundamental game mechanics like not needing to hold shift to auto loot is entirely different from adding entirely new functionality like a calendar because the community asks for it.
---
Happy cake day!
---
Don't fall into the blacksmithing trap.  Blacksmithing is not useful leveling, and you will waste precious materials while leveling it.  The gear you can make while leveling is quite sad, and by the time you have access to the materials to make an item, it is levels behind where you are.  I will have alchemy and herbalism because I'm not going to min-max, and those are two very useful money making professions.
---
The most important things is minimizing downtime, schedule toilet breaks and sleeps, arrange when you log back on.
---
For food, meal prep, chicken and fried rice is great.
---
Prep coffee before you go to bed, remember microwave heating or drinking fridge cold coffee is - ok-
---
The server could give them unique ids, but how would the players on the server message people?
---
why hearthstone???
---
Why not?
---
Would pay lots for a Game Grumps play WoW Classic
---
Best place to find addons for classic? How about macros?
---
lol
---
But why?
---
Those old intelligent macros wont work with the new client.
---
We will only have access to the current bfa client macros.
---
I've said it over and over, but the large majority of people talking about "meme specs" harming a raid never raided the content when it was relevant and likely haven't raided any difficult content in retail, period.
---
For one, many of the above "meme" specs bring utility to a raid that increases the overall raid DPS, and acting like they don't buff raid DPS shows a critical lack of knowledge.
---
More importantly, though, vanilla raiding content was stupid simple, and while you could argue you might clear it FASTER with an optimal comp, the difference will be extremely minor and more based on experience than class composition.
---
I think you need an idol for this to be true tho. Also its really slow and you have no regular rez, You also cannot provide dps increases like the rest do. Overall easily the worse healer 5 man, 20, or 40. 
---
Still more than viable and super useful in raids.
---
This was truly epic. What a fun GM!
---
On my last lock I went demonic sacrifice and would sacrifice my voidwalker for massive hp regen. Have you tested this out as an alternative for level 50? The extra hp regen makes it so you never need to eat/drink and can just facetank multiple mobs. I would just dot up 2-3 mobs and wand them down. Lifetapping whenever I needed mana. Between your normal out of combat regen and the 3% max hp/4 you go from zero life to full hp in under 90 seconds. Besides just being efficient it makes casual solo play in the world very fun as you never need to worry about overpulling. You do sacrifice a bit of damage for the extra regen but I believe the time/money saved makes up for it.
---
I've tried the drain tank method but I found siphon life to be an incredibly inefficient spell. It barely scales with +damage and the ticks are slow and small. A mob would need to live for a full 30 seconds for the spell to even be worth the global cd in terms of just raw damage done. 
---
My preferred method of taking down a mob consists of shadowbolt on the pull-&gt;second shadowbolt before the mob reaches me-&gt;quick immolate trying to dodge pushback-&gt;agony+corruption-&gt;wand
---
This method kills a mob very fast but is mana intensive. Thanks to the hp regen from sacrifice void I'm able to lifetap at will. If feeling up to a challenge after dotting the first mob you can go right into dotting up the next.
---
The idea is very much the same between the two specs except you're not relying on inefficient siphon life and drain life to heal yourself, you're naturally regenerating HP. This gives your more globals to use more spells. The spec is also very strong in pvp as you get access to soul link and master demonologist if you so desire along with nice utility spells like fel domination which can save you in a pinch.
---
Really? I never did that, but it seems kinda unreliable. The way I remember it, FD resisted pretty often, so it seems a little risky for soloing dungeon bosses. But maybe that's just my confirmation bias ;)
---
pretty sure those icons are just copy &amp; pasted in
---
What is the better weapon to have in your main hand as a rogue? A slow 1h sword, or fast dagger?
---
One could argue druids need the 2nd most (if not the most) keybinds...
---
Parts 18-30 and 30-40 are done and ready to be tested, we hope that the global stress test will allow us to level to level 20 to test it (1-18 will be done too of course so we can test that and if that works properly,the other guides will too)
---
That would fucked with my head so much while driving and talking at the same time.
---
Yeah this is blizzard remember. They often just say stuff. In this case they didn't say leeway was the same as it was in vanilla. They said it was working as intended, and a similar experience to people with low latency connections in vanilla.
---
Whatever that means.
---
Right, but melee leeway is less than 10yds. So it makes sense that the druid could not be in range of melee and still be in range of blind?
---
Add to that the fact that the rogue was sitting on the druid and getting "out of range" errors meaning the druid was probably laggy af and the video is possibly using clips from pre-leeway.
---
This evidence is complete shit, the first video posted even shows some serious melee leeway happening in vanilla from mobs.
---
Depends on the spec. Most people say combat swords, but daggers stay competitive and someone needs to take those dagger drops.
---
warriors already have a couple of ways to break fear, so I would say it's more useful for other classes.
---
You mean break? I don't use it.
---
* Play a few hours on launch night to enjoy the hype in disc and chaos online, level a bank alt and farm some silver.
---
* Get a good night's sleep, have some healthy breakfast like eggs and toast with coffee
---
* Send my main some cheap levelling gear from the bank alt then play all day with my friends in daylight hours without sacrificing any sleep, competing for tags
---
* Take breaks to chill,fuck around, get some fresh air, eat proper lunch
---
The real pro strat is not burning yourself and losing the fun, but to each their own
---
***LOK'TAR OGAR!***
---
Aye, mail at 40.
---
A thoughtful response! :)
---
1) Yes..private servers can make the code on server side? And?
---
2) I don't have any source because when I was playing in Cata/Mop I didn't think of needing to 'document' changes like this. The game was being more homogenized starting with TBC flyingmounts/dualspecs/hybrids etc etc. 
---
2a) "it's reasonable to think an added range was added on the server side" - It's not reasonable because that 1) Breaks all AOE farming 2) Breaks all encounters with ranges that deal with 5 - 10 yards in ANY PvP scenario. Vanilla - wotlk PvP is done on a razor's edge. MOP+ Expansions introduced devaluing movement. 
---
Leeway being in the game is a shift in fundamental philosophy of valuing abilities and math; vs movement and mechanics. Play WOTLK arena and you will see what I mean vs playing BFA arena.
---
3) Experience is not a weak argument; just not one that can itself be used for proof aka a posteriori. This is similar as the proof of reason via reason. Reason is a matter of faith that cannot be used to prove itself aka a priori. (But that is tangential.) 
---
4) There are many clips showing what seems to be 'leeway range' and then a second later having a player warp/update back to their old position. This is because the server for the current was just updated with an issued packet via movement command.
---
4a) Lag compensation is used on retail; but was not used in the same way in Vanilla. Blizzard needs to recognize this otherwise detrimental effects will occur.
---
5) Yes, latency is exactly what they said was why and how leeway as a function 'feels' different for us now. In effect saying that at some arbitrary point X in latency/connection our experiences would have changed for how leeway functions. 
---
5a) Problem with that above is that I experienced the Leeway Mechanic being introduced which with it gave me the intuition that movement and mechanics were being devalued. This happened to me without any modifications being changing on my end around 15-25MS at the time. 
---
We as classic fans want the original game back and so this #nochanges meme is not one about trying replicate anything other then our experience. That is what is at the core of Classic; an experience, something not arithmetically derivable.
---
This video shows at least one instance of mobs hitting from an insane distance, I'm not sure why you think this doesn't match up
---
Have you ever actually played a druid? What you described usually works, but is the bare minimum, no creativity way to play the class.
---
Why is there a gnome in the belf city?
---
I will be leveling a warrior and a pally, what professions should I get? My inputs are: class utility, PvE utility, money earned and sinergies created (if any). Thanks!!
---
There will also be people who can’t be bothered raiding (at least not hardcore) who will get loads of fun out of the journey to 60 and then working towards pre-raid BIS and completing the Dungeon 1 and eventually Dungeon 2 set.
---
Yah... I will watch this space with interest to see how many launch day plans survive the initial contact with the enem... erm... servers.
---
yeah level 40 is also when warrior can use armor
---
Would love this for hunter
---
I hope this isn't a dumb question... Is the PVP ranking system account wide, or locked to a single character? I really enjoy playing multiple classes...
---
Your answer tells me you’ve not even looked into it, so I think we’re done here.
---
I really hope you have some positive experiences this week, it sounds like you really need it ... Good luck with your life
---
People don't like batching and leeway, which is fine. It seems to me that this is how vanilla was though and Blizzard probably know that from comparing to the reference client.
---
I don't care what kind of experiences you have or what your life looks like.
---
I think your numbers for mages are too conservative.
---
Alchy is way better for just pure gold making tho.
---
I would level Engineering/Mining on the Warrior, and Herbalism/Alchemy on the Paladin:  
---
  \-Engineering gives warriors all kinds of utility and DPS regardless of what role you're filling  
---
  \-Alchemy is a great Prof for crafting consumes used in both PvE and PvP  
---
  \-Both characters have the ability to gather materials in place of grinding gold if their specs limit their ability to kill things
---
Assuming no overhealing, which assumes very low tank hp %, which can lead to dead tanks.
---
It's based on individual character's earned honor. It would be *way* too strong if you could rank to 14 then buy all your characters HWL weapons.
---
How else do you think i get into raids 😛
---
Haha! not a bad idea...
---
\^ Good advice here. Also keep in mind Daggers may go up in value a bit since the recent crit suppression revelations.
---
I really hope classic sees a return of the oldschool style GM interactions. Maybe Blizzard will let it happen because its just classic.
---
an annoying idea, just look at yasou and braum in lol they are lame to play against though fun to play as
---
&lt;3
---
zero
---
Prot paladin is literally the worst spec in the game, and that' saying something in classic where half the specs are trash.
---
I'd you're so bad that you can't lead MC with a few hybrid specs in your raid then that's probably a good idea
---
I would say Crescent Staff -&gt; Strike of the Hydra(optional) -&gt; Corpsemaker -&gt; WW Axe is a realistic goal to strive for. That means once you ding 28 you can put together a group and run RFK ASAP. It may take several runs, so starting while the mob XP value is highest is in your best interest. Those are also levels when your weapon will be weakest, so grouping is actually faster leveling than solo for most.   
---
Corpsemaker is strong enough to take you nearly to 40. By that time you could pay or beg a couple people to help you kill Cyclonian.
---
It sounds like your joy in this game comes from what you think other people think of you (they don't care about you). If 1000 other guilds get a week 1 naxx clear in addition to you, and that somehow takes away from your experience, then my only suggestion is therapy.
---
**Faction:** Horde
---
**Server:** EU-PvP
---
**Class:** Warrior (Tank) or Priest (Shadow) depends which fits guild needs/open spot.
---
**Looking for:** Semi-hardcore or hardcore guild also interested in premade PvP, fluent in german (native) and english.
---
**About me:** 30 yo team oriented player, experience Vanilla-&gt;MoP + various Private servers with multiple classes.  I´d like to minmax/theorycraft/play efficient with a nice guild/server wide community in PvE (main focus) and PvP (at least rank 11-12). I plan to put in the time to be ready to raid within the first 2 weeks, have a high attendance (optimal prepared) and are open to help at administrative work if needed.
---
There is a Druid Discord: https://discord.gg/XPrNqn
---
Kargoz has put out a druid levelling guide. https://youtu.be/UNHSOBkCYBk
---
Other excellent content posters to find online are : Taladril, Stromx, Ennbflow, Powerfulnoun, Javel &amp; Skarm
---
Isn't a game changer?  If you stack them all, it's 50% raid dps, and 30% raid health, and it completely breaks pve content.
---
Shadow isn't a meme spec, they're needed for the warlock group.
---
Curse has combined with Twitch and has lots of macros
---
How the hell does a paladin tank 4h in naxx without taunt? LMAO stop making B's up.
---
What a stupid question.
---
Acer is fine.  But if you are a gamer I'd recommend 144 hz and up. 75hz and below are going to be a disadvantage at times.
---
Yeah T3 warlock would like to have a word with yall.
---
Questie.
---
And u can heal dungeons.
---
You can spec into impeoved FD if needed.
---
Planning on playing rogue and I would love to find a list of really great macros for the class. When I played back in 05 I was 16 and didn’t even understand what macros were.
---
Did anyone test if you could get 10 people into Deadmines. I know there is a video of 10 level 70s doing it so it was at least possible until BC.
---
yeah I feel like enchanting is going to be really niche and if we manage to get some nice recipes early on then that could mean some really big profits. Being the go-to enchanter on the realm could be big
---
You forgot "/s" its important on this subreddit
---
Wow way to add a meaningful response to the question. Seriously man no need to be a dick.
---
I personally would recommend using a standard leveling guide, and skipping only the drop quests that take awhile like Mountain Lion Blood in Hillsbrad, or Akris Reed in STV etc. It's not bad to grind as a group for a long time if:  
---
1\] You don't run out of mobs to kill and have to stand there doing nothing  
---
2\] The mobs are within 1-2 levels of you  
---
If those two things aren't true, and the quest isn't part of some epic chain you're probably better off skipping it and keeping your momentum rolling forward. GL HF!
---
You’re not gonna bring a hunter for one boss of a raid and then kick him
---
Explain AoE leveling. Like spamming blizzard? I don’t think I understand.
---
I don’t think you know what you are talking about.
---
There will be guilds catering to those people specifically. And there will be guilds making an exception for few individuals.
---
Play what you want but do not expect your contributions to be meaningful if you pick a role that is barely viable. Just because a warrior can bandage does not mean they should be a healer.
---
There will always be situations where healers can support/dps. Some fights don’t require more than 1-3 healers. It is standard procedure for priests to smite or shamans to Nightfall.
---
By the way, druid tanks are not a meme. They are perfectly viable and super easy to heal into Naxx.
---
[This](https://bobo-talents.aerobaticapp.com/?class=rogue&amp;talents=tktRthtrtstdtFtGtHtItotWtntVtttjtJtKtLtMtZt0t1t2t3tXJTJUC0C1C2tpuIuJuKuLuMuXuYuZuPuSuTu9uDuEuFuGuHuQuR) is is the spec i would use for PVE.
---
Tell him mage is the best class in the game
---
You have a direct zep between Org and Undercity so depending on which continent, the zeppelin is a decent meeting spot. Anyone coming from Mugore is going to have a bit of a hike, unless you level individually until you make it to the crossroads. (Level 15 I reckon?)
---
&gt;	he is one of the forerunners of fury tanking
---
That’s stretching it. His guild used to be awful 2-3 years ago. They improved a lot and he has an insane amount of experience at this point. But he was no fury tanking pioneer by any means.
---
Tinfoil hat much
---
Oh boy. If you buy into that, and actually want to have a focus in raiding, you are setting yourself up for disappointment.
---
Great read - brings back the nostalgia 😁
---
How do raiding guilds handle 2h weapon drops in raids? Seems like you would want your warriors to all be fury and ret/enhance isn’t all that viable so I’m confused about priority.  Same question for pugs?
---
Let’s say a Spinal Reaper drops or even the eye of rag?
---
Are you like his biggest fan?
---
Looking over his uploaded videos I could criticize his content based on production quality alone.  He finds a way to just talk about a topic for a hair over 10 minutes? Is he broke or something?
---
That guide is just fine for leveling. Plenty of people have strongly-held opinions about skipping certain zones, which means you'll have to dungeon or solo grind to offset that lost XP. For example on a fresh PvP server I would skip all quests in Stonetalon Mountains as Alliance. There will be far more Horde in that zone, and you will make for a delicious target for them. Combine that with the generally miserable corpse runs in that zone, and I'd skip it on *any* leveling guide for Ally. Some people say the same for Hillsbrad while leveling Horde.   
---
Just keep in mind that your gameplay experiences will be unique to any of ours, and be ready to skip some areas if they are taking too long to complete. Please don't feel obliged to complete every single quest in a zone, I'd rather you enjoyed the game in your own way. GL HF!
---
Google USB computer pedals. I found mine locally but they're on amazon
---
I always play "meme spec" class. In fact, those spec/classes are hybrid and they are mean to play as a hybrid spec/class.
---
In the time of F2P-twink was strong on retail, I played all the meme spec/classes in WSG. I recorded full games and posted them on F2P-Twinks forum how to be good with those spec/classes. (ie: being a top healer and 3flags capped in a single game is possible with a feral druid. being top damage dealer/top healer with a retribution paladin with no BoA items is possible).
---
Awesome!
---
Google USB computer pedal. You can get them on Amazon.
---
Will classic work well with a 1440p monitor? Will I need mods to make the UI look right on a display of this size?
---
You can create your toons on August 13th.
---
Full list of servers will be available then.
---
Ok, we have two people playing tauren (partners). So if they level on there own we can mix and match groups at 15.
---
Quest until you're level 10 in Tirisfal. Then head to Orgrimmar and pick up the Hidden Enemies questline from Thrall. That's your first dungeon questline. Group with as many people as you can. Head down to Razor Hill, and grab the Crossroads quest from the western road guard, and knock out the level 10-14 quests in Crossroads. Once you're level 14 you can pick up and share the Ragefire Chasm quests with your friends and start the group dungeon slaying. GL HF! =)
---
I didn't realize it until just now... I have surgery on the day it comes out. I'm going to miss launch. Boo
---
Why the ad hominem? If you find their argument that ridiculous, just argue the argument and not the person?!
---
Thanks :-)
---
&gt; You might be being a bit unfair to drain tanking here. In classic it is a bit more unrealistic to "multi-dot" as you can do on pservers
---
Yeah, I think people really exaggerate this a bit. Even on pservers, for max leveling speed without downtime using VW + multidot you are really only dotting an extra mob, maybe 2, sometimes none. The epic 5-6+ mob pulls, while sometimes possible, aren't efficient at all, and can get you killed pretty easily.
---
Tauren range is 7m, not 5m like you.
---
I would say hunter hands down. The possibilities are near endless as long as you are creative and intuitive.
---
Never had to much exp @ level 60 since pservers lol, usually quit right at hitting 60.
---
Anyhow, your pet can face tank lots of things and with the right gear and setups you can out-heal dps done to pet or at least off set it enough to get through the elite/boss.
---
I remember rotgrip being pretty tough with his stacking dot, which i was doing those in my 50's. Probably tons easier @ 60.
---
I prefer healing ferals in Naxx on servers with buffed content over warriors any day. They have less avoidance and more mitigation. Damage income is steady and can easily be healed by OP priests without having 10 seconds of bait breaks where the tank parries/blocks etc.
---
Yes. I am running a 1440 monitor now, and played in the Closed Beta for Classic. Heck even actual Vanilla WoW client plays well with UHD resolutions. You should use UI mods regardless, because they more simply and cleanly present game information than the crummy default UI.
---
The big thing that worries me about a guide like this is that (in my cursory review through level 30) it makes no mention of dungeons whatsoever. Now, as a person who ran all the vanilla dungeons many, many times in 05-06 I’m not bummed about missing them from a nostalgic standpoint, but wondering if I’m going to be missing some important gear for leveling without detouring from the guide. Thanks for the insight thought, I’m SO pumped for Classic.
---
Full list of servers will be available **before** then. We just don’t know when yet.
---
I remember this as a thing too.  Unfortunately it was back when ret pallies typically had consecrate.  However in the patch 1.9 paladin talent rework that's now a tier 3 holy talent so very few rets will have it in WoW Classic.
---
I have the ones you see in the picture. I think they’re called “FootSwitch”
---
FWIW, I use them for:
---
Movement ability (blink/charge/ghost wolf) | interrupt | rare utility (slow fall/intercept/waterwalking)
---
That sounds incredibly boring and pricey.
---
Engineering is mandatory. The second profession is irrelevant.
---
Only baby bitch bois roll paladin instead of warrior change my mind
---
Conbat swords is easier so id just stick with that. Additionally, if you are a Dagger rogue, you still want a slow MH dagger, even though daggers are fast by nature.
---
not to much, i keep my guide updated if i do :p
---
My guests assume I play racing games.
---
This answer is accurate. Be warned, it'll take you 50%+ longer to level as elemental than enhancement. I would consider leveling resto even before ele. You'll be drinking every two mobs, and you need to buy your drink as a Shaman unless you get super lucky and make friends with a mage or three.
---
And they fixed the unintentional oversight.
---
But world buffs remained unchanged.
---
Again, just because you don't like something does not mean it is an "exploit". If Blizzard did not want us using world buffs, why didn't they disable them, and why did they keep adding more of them to the game?
---
Better than running around like headless chicken isnt it?
---
The very TL;DR is that the other tank taunts but doesn't use threat generating abilities so they only just sit above the hate meter. All the Paladin has to do to "taunt" back is drop a judgement/exorcism.
---
The same tactic can be used on fights like Firemaw with an OT taunting before Wing Buffet.
---
If u want spend a minute before dps aka spending hour more per dungeon..sure.
---
I have a naga and pedals. The beauty is that I barely use my left hand. It’s the movement/buff-casting hand
---
Because leeway is *not* working the same way it did in vanilla, regardless of what blizzard says
---
Mobs didn't have an increased auto attack range if both parties were running. There was a range threshold that , once broken , would induce auto attacks until your character is outside the threshold again
---
So, for mages, you could easily kite targets and even run back in for a split second then CoC / FN and continue kiting
---
With this version of melee leeway, the mobs would attack BEFORE the threshold is broken *because their attack range is increased while moving*
---
I truly don't understand how blizz could've gotten this one **so wrong**.
---
Thats a lie right there. Taunt.
---
Well that's kinda untrue. The way it's looking right now, layering will give you the tools you need to get ahead of the zerg.
---
He won't be behind too much, but that's not because of a scuffed launch I think.
---
It was intentionally designed to stack almost indefinitely, yes.
---
Well, multibox with 5 different classes? How is that? I can imagine 5 different rdd multibox, but how you are going to heal and tank with multibox?
---
This would have given me an orgasm. I was like 8 in 2001 but still.
---
I watched people on youtube doing that, even soloing stratholme as 5, on classic that is
---
Mage fixes N/A - sums it up quite well
---
My mum was a boomie. She rarely got to dps and just healed in boomie spec.
---
Yes pls.  And clock + stopwatch also. That wasnt in the game until tbc iirc
---
Yeah..... bloodfang is right there too.
---
I'm sure they understimated how many bugs were in the game. I'm also positive they are regretting the release date.
---
How about you play the game you pay for?
---
Hey, I love optimists, but after that amount of shitty releases I've played I definitely will be assuming the worst. Didn't play BfA or WoD release, heard they were slow and ok for players , but of classic gets the numbers that some are projecting, it's gonna be a bloodbath. 
---
Even 1000 per layer is a ton of people to contest mobs with. 
---
But yes, overall the point is that the commenter will be ok missing the first day. 
---
People won't remember who was first to 60 when everyone's clearing BWL or AQ40
---
Can go to into more detail? I'm deciding between rogue and mage, and I like daggers
---
I've not bookmarked them just stumbled across several here and there when diving into various forum threads thoroughly researching the topic. 
---
There is a problem with Prot Paladin footage (similar to Druid tanks) whereby no actual vanilla footage exists of progression tanking for certain raids because the pre 1.9 talents made it even more unlikely for druids/paladins to be considered for a raid tank role.
---
If you're objectively interested in looking into the topic then Mowsen and Killerduki are decent YT channels to start with. If you're just looking for an easy example to prove/disprove the topic then I'd say not to bother because without the additional reading it's a pointless debate.
---
So... The idea that they don't scale well with world buffs but somehow scales well with gear feels like it's a congruent set of beliefs to you? You don't feel like there's a contradiction in there at all?
---
Just wondering.
---
This is a major concern for the well being of Classic
---
This might be frowned upon, but my personal plan to maximize my own enjoyment of Classic hinges upon the ability of Mages to AoE grind. If AoE grinding is scuffed enough I will probably make a big plan change and roll Hunter first...
---
I don't think it has anything to do with melee content creators
---
Melee leeway (auto attack range being increased while moving) was absolutely not in vanilla. Gonna have to disagree with you.
---
I’m only concerned about what I’m doing anyways
---
The only way the boss dies in half the time with "dps gear" is if your dps do twice as much damage. If dps is having to hold back that much just to not pull aggro, then yes you should absolutely start subbing in threat gear or even start looking at switching specs. 
---
I feel like this idea of threat as a bottleneck is a pretty new phenomena and is coming from pservers. I'm just not sure that the reality of this in an average guild on Classic. Most players are not going to use consumes, not optimize rotations/gear/enchants, and not actually push tanks that hard on threat generation.
---
Just my speculation though. Like I said in another post- I'd love to be wrong. I hope that I'm forced to go DW Fury Prot just to keep up. I don't think it's likely.
---
Without an organised group it makes little difference to a class which shouldn't even be healing in the BG. Shadowspec survivability while healing is more beneficial than having better mana, especially if you're getting zero peels from pugs.
---
Besides, pug BGs are playgrounds where suboptimal specs aren't going to slow the progress of a whole raids.
---
Eh I still wanna play mage :D
---
I ain't no huntard!
---
On k3 they went for 39g - 49g each
---
Hunter pet does a lot more threat and are also tankier if you want try something different when running dungeons.
---
I for one welcome our new classic overlord.
---
"it was intentionally put in the game by the devs but it's an EXPLOIT because I don't like it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

"it was intentionally put in the game by the devs but it's CHEATING because I don't like it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

Seems your mind is set in stone, so I'll just go ahead and block you now. Stay seething. :)
---
43 days boys and then finally we can start living again
---
&gt;Even the shitty guilds on private servers get world buffs on most of their players.
---
That's not even remotely true.
---
Is dat why ur commenting your opinions to strangers on a public forum? Cuz you only care about what you're doing? Hmm... 
---
Wouldn't have keeping to yourself exerted less energy and, therefore, less concern upon the lowly actions of mortal beings such as myself?
---
Easy to heal?They have bigger healthpool and less mitigation aka more healing required.
---
At worst, your characters would need a rename after 10 years of absence. If people can still log back in after over a decade of no sub and see their characters in their roster as digital time capsules, then there's no reason to believe it will be any different here, barring classic servers getting shutdown for whatever reason.
---
Oh
---
Druid is pretty bad as a dungeon healer as it doesnt have a rez unfortunetly.
---
No changes! Oh wait... would changing the meme format to be a classic format be a technical change? AAAAHHHH
---
&gt;I was in guilds that week after week got all the world buffs just to die in most random ways before approaching first bosses. It's not up to discussion if it happens, but to what degree.
---
That's your guild being dumb. It's not a problem with world buffs themselves.
---
Tbh it will probably only last a day. 
---
Only 1 ( maybe 2) of my homies who i raid in modern with will be taking time off work to level. So ill probably end up just playing with him and then helping the others as they level slowly.
---
Yeah obviously tanking is ideal but if you're in a situation where you have to heal because your group can't find a healer to you can do that as long as you have an intellect set with you.
---
I have one of these things funny enough!
---
This is why people like Classic. 
---
Running makes you appreciate mount, hard fights make you appreciate kills, dying makes you appreciate being cautious. To me it's also why people dislike layer hopping. 
---
In actual vanilla, if a zone was aggressive pvp, you had to learn how to get around it, deal with the players, find new methods. It is one world afterall. The ability to vanish from an aggressive pvp zone suddenly to a new layer is like a cheat code; it is antithesis to what makes WoW great for many of us. We want those old hard fights, hard travels, difficult times in one true world.
---
We have holidays like that in real life. Have you ever left your house on Halloween or Christmas?
---
Eww wasting a warrior slot on nightfall smh, get a hunter to spam raptor strike and wing clip.
---
Dude, man.
---
Use a MIDI keyboard for extra hotkeys lol. I have a korg nanokey that would be perfect.
---
This is the reddit thread talking about leveling in dungeons:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bx6mc4/dungeon_grinding_time_to_reevaluate/
---
Ofcourse the people that got that fast xp was basically twinks, so shouldn't be so high xp with normal gear but still good.
---
The main thread multiboxers discuss dungeon leveling in (somewhere, idk where, people have said at what lvl they intend to do which dungeons):
---
https://www.dual-boxing.com/threads/55725-Comparison-of-squads-for-5-man-dungeons
---
Warlock means you can HS and sell and then summon back, saving time. Mage = water and food to save time and gold.
---
Feels like using both priest and shaman isn't optimal for dungeon leveling (less AOE and not mana efficient) but probably works fine.
---
What is the hearthstone doing there?
---
"I would bring that guy back to life just so I could kill him again!" made into a reality in the world.... Of Warcraft
---
There's 3 possibilities for launch as I see it. 
---
1.   Blizzard launches with each server having several hundred layers, so the early zones are less crowded.  
---
2.  Blizzard launches the game such that there's roughly 3,000 players per layer.  Not likely imo, as the starter zones would be insanely overcrowded.   Though, maybe they'll do it for the "classic" feel.  idk, doubt it.
---
3.  Blizzard utilizes layers and sharding at the same time.   This seems the most likely to me.
---
But its not going to be the same. The internet community has changed and we nerds know pretty much everything there is in the game. So why not make raid organisation (something EVERYONE says was a massive hassle) a little easier?
---
That's not what that word means.
---
in classic wow you will run mc regulary even when naxx is released. so you can take a long time to finish leveling and still get into raiding
---
Scatter shot and freeze traps are “separate schools of magic” thus, should be on separate diminishing cool downs... I thought it was always like this. As long as ya got the time to get an aimed shot off after a freeze trap it’s all good imo. I’m still going a hunter too. They are somewhere in the middle as far as “best class”. I heard the hunter DPS falls off in PvE when you start Nax. I’m 100% sure I’ll be doing better than some other DPS because I’m so good at rotating spells. Also since I’m going to be a casual player, hunters have the fastest leveling ability, which will help me keep up with the others. I got my first hunter to 52 before deciding it wasn’t the class for me then rolled a warrior. Try it out man. Wow is all about having fun!
---
&gt;People cleared raids on computers that couldn’t even handle orgrimmar.
---
those random lagspikes while kiting Razorgore dragonkins...
---
No, it would just be making a “classic version” of the meme
---
Feral dps, with its power shifting, consumables, and farming for crowd pummeler charges would like a word.
---
It might knock off nightfall...which is a big deal
---
I tried to find good image of classic or but I think this facial expression was just so great.
---
I think the whelps were white drops in Vanilla, they are worth keeping.
---
You forgot annihilator debuff
---
FOR THE HORDE!
---
Death to the alliance scum!
---
LOVE that episode. Professor ChAoSssssss *mwahahaha*
---
light feather. AH those puppies.
---
Sounds like u already chose nelf mate
---
Closed beta....with layering...
---
Definately not.
---
Druids generally have a higher armor than warriors. They don’t have as much avoidance as defense is not as effective.
---
Healers become seriously overpowered in T3. The health pool and armor do play a very big role. The warrior will receive less damage overall but taking no damage for 10 seconds and then suddenly going 100 to 0 in less than five seconds can be a tricky situation.
---
I am fairly certain there was a patch to update a bunch of items to be more caster friendly with +dmg and healing added.
---
Don't die. If you do, run back. Druids are very good 5-man healers
---
No prob !
---
Battle.net launcher &gt; World of Warcraft &gt; World of Warcraft Classic in the launcher. It might need a subscription, but even if you cant do it today you'll be able to in August for sure.
---
I did see the aq40 release, but this was the end of something I really enjoyed. Also it had been dead af for weeks.
---
I've had both (Razer and Corsair) and by far the the Corsair Scimitar is my favorite. It has a bit of a learning curve only because it's more customizable and adjustable to fit each person differently. My razer naga was great but the thread on the cord came undone and the buttons started sticking and clicking when I didn't want then to (this could be resolved with cleaning but it seemed like mechanically it had just reached its life expectancy).
---
Just a fair warning though, once you use one you'll never want to go back to a regular mouse.. haha
---
Just need a sub, no need to buy any form of the game
---
Oh, you dont even have a wow account at all in your Blizz account? Then maybe make a trial one, if you really want to download it now instead of the week before launch or whatever.
---
Today, I think it’s for the sake of simplicity. In the past, prior to btag and crossrealm stuff I think it was more practical. It can’t be too difficult to prioritize mall by btag, toon name and then server. Mail address could be legolas@malganis@boozoo69.
---
I will also do some Horde Routes, Tauren-Shaman is one of the fastest 1-10. ;)
---
Thanks for the info! Of these, which ones are you likely to see in a semi-hardcore raid environment? I love the ability for players to have non-standard builds if they want, and am curious how much that would translate to a real raid scenario.
---
Because that's when you realise you have no business being here and need to gtfo 🤣
---
This so much. The days before marking (aka most of vanilla) were so much more brutal for pugging dungeons at 60.
---
Good question, gonna follow this thread. I’d say check cooking guides and make sure to save anything in those recipes
---
&gt; wow you sound like a great guild member
---
I was Class Leader and sometimes I also led raids. I knew who I could count on to perform tasks, and who I couldn't ask to do anything more than the shitty dps they were doing. It's not like we kicked them, or denied them loot. We carried them, as pretty much every guild did.
---
We didn't bring them on MC/BWL epix auction runs though.
---
&gt; Then why are you so afraid of losing your crutch?
---
What crutch? We didn't really use world buffs back then either. IIRC we stacked what we could gather for Nefarian first kill, and for Patchwerk because we got there a bit scared. Didn't really use them for anything else.
---
Bubble, holy shock, 100% crit heal, LoH.
---
I wouldn't say full list.  They'll make more, if the demand is there.
---
Someone needs to take one for the team and reserve the name Legolass on every server, then sit on those characters and never play them.
---
Imp Weapon Totems &amp; Enhancing Totems would be my best bet for Horde raids. Blessing of Kings for Alliance. Both are likely to have one(and only one) special snowflake in raid with those talents as healers.
---
Damage wise, not bad at all but they run oom fairly quickly and will just end up wanding away if they keep dps'ing
---
All games global chats have always been like this. Only the words have changed.
---
#FOR THE ALLIANCE!
---
If you had the started edition + sub, then does that mean you could play everything up to BFA?
---
Private servers got a lot of stuff wrong, sure, but i guarantee you private server players will wipe the floor with anyone that hasn’t played WoW in 12 years.
---
[Personally I'd have gone with this guy. ](https://i.imgur.com/PBj8nYA.jpg)
---
Do you really not understand which part of your post of speculative?
---
Yes. There's only two game purchases: a sub, and then BfA.
---
Try to find guild on your play stalyle pvp or raids.
---
Also your play times, so you can shot on time when needed. I had hard time finding day time eu raid guild.
---
Yeah, i guess they want it to be accessible as possible for the wide mass. :D
---
No, you are not going out of this discussion with your head up high.
---
You wrote
---
&gt;	Except there are videos of paladins tanking progression content, including 4h in Naxx.
---
All I did was ask for those videos. And you have been sperging uncontrollably since. Show us those videos and stop dancing around the subject. Or shut the fuck up.
---
You are not prepared! *cough cough* I mean nice keyboard
---
Could have sworn I saw WoW box at my local walmart recently though.
---
Of course you may be right.  And of course, nothing lasts forever.  However, Asheron's call never held a candle to WoW in subscriber numbers, and blizzard is a much more profitable (and well known developer) than Turbine (okay, so I'm reading Asherons Call's wikipedia page...).  I think blizzard will find a way to keep wow going (classic at least) for as many years as it can be profitable.
---
All that is is a sub.
---
Do weapons that increase attack power against certain creature types benefit ranged attack power?
---
Feral is pretty easy to play. Sure it’s hard to go all out to achieve somewhat acceptable dps as it’s not a pure dps class. Not sure what that has todo with the topic at hand
---
I prepared by disabling the ridiculous Gamer Rave lighting on my mother board, and changing my keyboard to a neutral sustained color.    Either way your upgrade is well worth it.
---
Two weeks or one week before August 13th.
---
lol his reply makes me feel like he's also a healer and that you've both encountered a similarly terrible tank. 
---
I can only pray that I don't meet any more tanks like this.
---
The only one that's really imperative to run will be Mara to get your Thrash Blade ASAP.
---
&gt;However This only applies at max level or at least 50+ as healing becomes a lot more about casting frequently so downranking is the best way to heal and conserve mana at that point. 
---
Reason why downranking comes into play at level 50+ is because that's when gear with +healing drops. The more +healing you have, the more mana efficient your lower ranked spells become. You can test this easily by dividing the amount of heal by the mana cost. 
---
If you barely have any +healing gear then your max ranked heals are more mana efficient.
---
1. This is not due to spell batching but due to position interpolation.
---
2. This happened in vanilla, too.
---
I have to say this hand is full of weird ol pervs
---
I doubt it, Hunters literally had a reason to complain, they had by far the most bugs in the beta. They still have a bunch of issues and people are just acting like its fine. Pets will randomly go unresponsive, NPCs can run through traps without triggering them, if you look at game files the whole DR FT/Blind is just messed up (they use different game mechnics and incorrectly triggered each other). I'll be playing hunter but I understand why a lot of people will re-roll.
---
Oh ok, so currently starter edition + sub gets you everything except for the latest expansion?
---
Kinda weird to mention you’re a mod of the discord lol
---
&gt; But in order to be a fine dps, aren't you saying they scale well with gear?? 
---
Not necessarily.  It takes time for high scaling to outperform high static damage.  
---
Are they topping the meters in Naxx?  No.   But take away the world buffs, and the gap isn't anywhere near as wide as you have been led to believe.
---
Haha i said it wrong, i love the game, waiting for it myself played private servers and raided naxx. I meant running around zones doing wuests i thought its faster to spam dungeon and not run around zones
---
Just need one more pedal for autoattack.
---
You can reduce the price without going all the way to dual spec.
---
Cheaper respec would ruin everything.
---
Pffffffft. Only normies wouldn't play from the operating table while being cut open. /scoff
---
Ahh some very good advice. Thank you.
---
But what about the early levels, like 10ish.  I planned to go tailoring/enchanting to at least rush the lesser and greater wands. You think it's worth it or just get one off the AH, or my buddy who's gonna be tailoring
---
Agreed. We have absolutely NO idea about what is happening next, and also Classic provides a place for people to roleplay without all the stupid bullshit of WoD and Legion and all that other garbage.
---
me not that kind of orc
---
Log onto the stress test and set up configurations and target attack macros for the first 10 levels of quests to get ahead of the curve.  The set up will remain when Classic releases.
---
I do not believe that shield block pushes crits off the table.
---
what?
---
Slippery slope. #nochanges
---
How should you farm money for your mount at 40 (on a fresh realm)? Are there good beasts to grind with skinning and vendorable greys? Or something totally different?
---
But if you weren't fucking with an alt, you'd be 60.
---
if you have 4 warlocks, a priest is perfect lol. if you only have 2, sure. but 4 is what the top guilds will run for most of the phases
---
Thanks i only hope it last as long as my Lycosa did. Btw i went for MX Brown switches.
---
It has been there for US accounts since the last stress test, when they added it. Everyone with an active sub was given access.
---
Nah, unfortunately those days are over lol
---
Before you go go
---
dreamweaver
---
No. If this was the case, everyone could just play hybrids and raid as a good spec. This makes it so hybrids are very few and far between, and makes spec choices very valuable. I hated how everyone was optimized the exact same. Now, we will have people in all different kinds of specs. PvP specs, pve specs, balanced specs for both, etc.
---
I tried to shadow bolt someone once
---
Ferals don't need that many MCP's. In MC/BWL most fights are over in under a minute in a good guild. MCP lasts 30sec, so only need 1 or 2 charges per boss.
---
Even less as a Tank druid cause it's just for threat and if you have a threat lead there's no point to use a second charge.
---
You could play it on a laptop from 2007, wow can run on a potato
---
Dont wake up
---
That's another issue. Reddit has enough useless, thoughtless posts as it is, don't contribute to it.
---
Hunter has it worse from my understanding despite the slew of fixes that blizzard implemented recently, it still seems like its going to have trouble.
---
This is so true on many levels.
---
1) I have my doubts that Blizzard has all the server side code as well. And because of lack of information; they are defaulting to how it works in retail. Hence the lack of detail and technical information. And the type of 'emotional responses '---Working as "intended".
---
2) I did extensive testing on Beta Stress test, ALL units with melee have leeway. It results in mobs getting an extra 1 attack always, sometimes 2 and having an extra 2.66 yard range which is completely not how the game was.
---
You can find clips of this all the way since Demo. They ported the Legion Client / Server data. It was literally the 1st or 2nd thing I tested. 
---
3) I'm one of the few Veteran Multir1 Players from oldschool WoW who still cares about the game's authenticity. Most of the people who were extremely knowledgable about the game either A) Have quit or B) Don't care (aka me messaging Neilyo a few days ago and he said "Dude I don't care about WoW anymore."
---
Reminds me of how humanity sees technology in warhammer.
---
If by "wipe the floor" you mean "dedicate more hours per day," then sure.
---
Man like you've never asked a bad question before.
---
Millennial here. Haven’t heard it. Am I out of touch? No it’s the kids that are wrong
---
Always be thinking about your mount, even from level one. Kill everything, loot everything, and don’t spend money on needless things. 
---
It helps if you can get ahold of larger bags while leveling. The more you can loot - the more you can sell. 
---
Skinning will also help, as it gives access to even more items to vendor.
---
&gt;So OP that instead of balancing new boss fights around it, it was removed altogether.  
---
I'm not sure whats so OP about wipe protection, or how you could rebalance a boss fight around it
---
I also did fine dueling because the class was fine and wasn't broken.
---
Yeah man he's not wrong. With no taunt and a limited resource pool Palidans are just awful tanks.
---
This right here is solid advice. Fruits and nuts (a.k.a. healthy fats) are the best foods for sedentary jobs and yes, even gaming. :P Water should be the main source of hydration because it will keep you alert. oh, and a single apple will provide more energy than a cup of coffee. :D
---
Probably be better off finding a nice guild you like and passing the savings onto your guildies.
---
IMHO, AH prices is entirely supply and demand. Selling at 'normal' vs selling at 'high' isn't really a thing. If it sells it sells, and the item was worth that amount. Posting under market value is only doing yourself a disservice.
---
You'll learn while leveling, tanking as fury spec.
---
As everybody did back then
---
(☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞
---
This was how I killed a lot of mobs in TBC with an Imp while I was on my Lock. I’d ping pong the mob into running between and my imp who were max distance apart. By the time it made it to the Imp, I had aggro, by the time it turned around and got me, the Imp had aggro. Worked like a charm.
---
NO NO NO
---
There is a good reason for these increasing respec costs.  They start cheaply, so everybody can fix a poor choice or just change it around a few times, like leveling as spec X and then at 60 go to spec Y, and somewhat later to variant Z.
---
But some classes would be waaaaay to powerful if respeccing was cheap. It is also a needed gold sink to keep inflation under control.
---
Set up your entire UI (including addons) during the stress test and then just copy your WTF folder onto whatever character you make on the 12th/13th.
---
To piggyback on this: many classes have fairly useless abilities before (and even after) 40. An example would be hamstring or wing clip; all levels of these abilities slow by the same amount, but additional levels only marginally increase the damage. It's not worth it to spend that extra money for the pitiful damage increase. Skip them and buy them at 60 when you're flush with cash.
---
This meme was just on r/2007scape yesterday

For a raiding character I fully support that engineering is ideal. However, making an alt with extra needed professions is the ideal way to deal with having engineering on your main.
---
Gl finding enough +healing pre-60 to make that worthwhile.
---
if youve got rgb and youre not letting strobe in all the colors of the rainbow, youre clearly doing something wrong
---
I literally posted this 43-4 days ago minus the overlay and it was removed. SMH mods are filthy Horde lovers.
---
As a Mage wands aren't crucial to your leveling like a Priest or even Warlock. I would delay and just buy a lesser/greater Magic wand off the AH or someone advertising. You'll be able to level just fine without one compared to them.
---
It dispels all debuffs and removes you from combat. You could essentially remove a mechanic from a fight. They actually admitted to doing this. Think about it, there are debuffs that give you huge DPS but they can kill you when they expire. Imagine having that completely removed. the fact that it can save you from wiping, it’s the fact that you can sacrifice one guy to save another entirely. 
---
Sorry for grammar, using text to speech atm. Blizzard admitted to this. It was OP.
---
I’ve already stopped showering
---
This is just an excise to do nothing.
---
I've been trying to spread the word about the website vanillafriends but the reddit fight for posting the link isn't looking good &gt;&lt; I've found a few old friends up on there but there are a ton more I'd love to reconnect with. I know I'm not one in this either!!!
---
did you squeez your .... back in the day to elfs ?
---
Shamans are very mana efficient so you rely HEAVILY on melee. Go shield + dagger + flametongue enhancement. Pull with one or two LBs then melee down, maybe shocking once. This is mana efficient, quick, and consistent.
---
Honestly everyone who complains about layering and how any convenience ruins the game needs to be on an everquest progression server
---
They dont owe you or anyone else anything. If you want to try the beta you sub. It's not like you are only paying for the 2 day stress test. You have their other content to.
---
You can pray but you know you will.
---
That's why I'm rolling warrior, I don't want to be running with shitty tanks, I'd rather tank myself.
---
First off it serves as a goldsink. But more importantly is that you are not "HiImTwelve the warrior" you are "HiImTwelve the protection warrior". You have to make tough choices and usually stick with them. Warriors now have to help noobs tank 5 man dungeons and reserve some loot, create an alt or find a healer to farm DM with in order to make money.
---
I personally wouldn't stress about it too much; unless you dump gold into leveling profs, you'll easily reach the money needed by 43-44 at the latest. Post-40 mobs start dropping items worth serious vendor prices 1g+, so if you save wisely and skip not needed spell training as others have suggested you'll be fine.
---
Basically the optimal spec for every situation is already discovered so there is not really any place for experimentation really
---
Why are you asking this?  you can test it for yourself on pservers, what are you waiting for?  I would also not underestimate the training you need to get this smoothly under control.
---
BONK

2H Fury is viable on Horde
---
It’s.. beautiful

They take between 3 and 4 debuff slots.
---
SW: Pain
---
Shadow Weaving (a good one but still)
---
Mind Flay (yes it takes one)
---
Vamipric Embrace (Optional but probably the second most justified one)
---
It was my understanding that the private/pirated servers didn't have the balance 100% accurate. So does it matter what happens to those players? My thought process is that they will try to do their usual antics, but learn it may not work like it used to because of the balancing change.
---
Sounds like pvp happening on a pvp realm. If you can't cut it, play on PvE.
---
That'd be my choice, a huge amount of lore to explore. And I love sci fi settings. World be a lot of fun. Could get to be to much killing bugs though...
---
1000 people per layer will be fine with me as a Tauren.  Assuming a 50/50 Horde/Ally split, it'll be 300 Undead, 150 Orcs, 47 Trolls, and 3 Tauren in the entire layer.
---
I also play with a window open and sunlight streaming in.  I definitely don't play like a translucent goblin titillated by glitter.
---
First I’ve heard this complaint/concern. Personally, I look forward to encounters like this... get a good group of friends that will come to your defense.
---
I ran a PvP guild and we welcomed chances to rally and dominate.
---
It seems like it would be *waaaayyy* better as a modifier for other macros, as opposed to just a single spell.
---
Not saying I’d kick someone for not having an ahnk, but if he’s dps he’ll be replaced in 3 seconds. Healer could be just as quick depending on the instance and current server pop
---
This, except Mulgore instead of Tirisfal. Mulgore will be the least populated leveling zone in the game.
---
Also reputation will be a thing
---
With no +healing I 100% agree with you OP. Yo-yo healing is by far the most Mana efficient way to heal in 5-man dungeons. Not only are you literally casting your most Mana efficient heals (without +healing higher level spells tend to be slightly more hp per Mana), but you have to cast fewer of them giving you more time regenerating Mana in the 5 second rule AND you have more up time on your wand.
---
This means you need to drink less between dungeon pulls while also contributing more DPS to the dungeon.
---
Yes, letting your tank drop to 30% in a dungeon IS more risky than keeping him constantly topped above 50%. That does not mean that it is a wrong choice. Especially when you're past the first few seconds of a pull and have a good understanding of the rate the tank is taking damage.
---
Yes you obviously don't cast your highest rank heal on a DPS that has less hp than the value of the heal, pointing that out is just being pedantic. As a priest for example if you keep your max rank gheal and your max rank heal on your bars that is essentially all of the heals you need for the entirety of leveling content. Keep max rank Flash Heal and PW Shield and you're good.
---
Non pvp servers
---
Crossroads is more 11-12ish, I wouldn't go there at 10
---
Lmao was thinking same
---
HS is almost never worth it for threat
---
Should those be auto-translated to chuck norris jokes?
---
It's quite similar to mine, lol.

---
PvP should be a fair fight.
---
Only thing they need to do is add PvE servers, which they already did.  Sounds like that’s where you should play.  And I’m being 100% genuine with this statement.
---
I say it's the opposite, holy priests have 5 different heals that they can use, if they keep the max rank on their bars of each one they're set through all content until raids.

PvP is PvP. It *shouldn't* be anything but that. If you can't hack it either get friends or gtfo.
---
I don't like multiboxing. It just don't worth it. But I've used honorbuddy for a while. :)
---
I go with the policy "I'll stop whenever the healer asks me to, dps can mana break whenever they want, I won't stop for them unless they are needed for cc"
---
I asked a blizzard rep in a live chat yesterday and he said it should be available for preload around the time the name reservation goes live.
---
Don't know if they know that for a fact, but it's something I guess
---
What balance?  The only really difference will be that the server won't be insanely overpopulated.
---
I wonder which private server this guy got banned from to be this salty.
---
There’s already a solution to this, PvE realms.
---
If it was Flash of Light, Holy light, and Blessings, you’re bottom half would be ripped in one MC run.
---
If you don't like getting ganked you play on a PVE server, when you make a character on a PVP server you consent to PVP, so HTFU or make a character on a PVE server.
---
Are you implying that corpse camping is a specific issue to private servers?
---
Corpse camping has been happening since the dawn of time, it's a pvp server. If you don't like it, go play on a pve server.
---
 [https://itemization.info/item/18404](https://itemization.info/item/18404)  added in 1.3, so i assume head will be available in phase 1?
---
I really appreciate anyone who makes content, but I feel like this whole video is a little misleading.  It's basically things any class and any spec can do to be more useful.  Then just mentioned that as a meme spec you need to do this things to even be considered.  As a rogue/mage you could do everything in the video and be even more useful.
---
Hopefully the big ones will go to one server, I assume they will so they can circlejerk each other's content and actually get involved in it
---
What's the point of changing the game? it's great as it is. I don't know if it will be good with some changes. Why do you want to risk making the game worse?
---
Ultima Online has outlived Asherons call and is still going today, thinking WoW only has 5-10 is probably a poor estimate... It won't look the same but will likely be around a good long time in some capacity.
---
Honestly, 9/11 was a blip in the radar for a lot of people.
---
Blizzard was literally on the opposite side of the country.
---
Look at this guys post history. He clearly has some kind of mental illness.
---
You hoard them of course, if you sell anything on the AH in the first month you are just throwing away money.
---
One could argue that it contributes to the community aspect if you have to ask for help of higher level players of your faction
---
I guess you never played on blizzards servers, ganking players that are low lvl and give no reward and is no challenge to fight has always been a thing.
---
It is a part of the game, it is the reason stranglethorn vale is sometimes called gankingthorn vale.
---
I'm not talking about superfluous balancing like faction numbers.
---
I'm talking about real balancing like Spell X does Y damage or Spell W does Z damage over A time.
---
The 31 point prot talent is a big thing to give up though
---
Corpse camping was far FAR FAR less severe in Vanilla wow.
---
Or risk making it better?
---
Or just, using paladins as an example, enjoy being Ret while farming and doing PvP but suck it up for two nights a week and heal/buff the raid. That's not that big of a sacrifice so you can experience content and get a chance at getting good gear.
---
I mean you can
---
Don’t forget to bind orc racial to all of your abilities
---
&gt; It's not like you are only paying for the 2 day stress test. 
---
A lot of people did though, every other beta prior to this one didn't require an active sub. I wouldn't defend this especially when it's counter productive to what a stress test is supposed to be for. You can spend your money how you want but I feel this is a pretty transparent money grab due to the declining sub numbers.
---
You're wrong.
---
Seeing the clips of the system working as a whole sets a certain bar for viewer intellect. If you dont understand the argument, just move along please.
---
3 factions what be quite interesting.
---
Mobs fleeing to the opposite direction they are facing is a private server thingy, won't work on retail.
---
Honorsystem is relentless on pvp servers, it happened in vanilla also.
---
If you are on EU I have sent you a discord message and could use a heal buddy to level with I am on that NEET life for the foreseeable future so can go crazy hours.
---
&gt;Or the additional 30% crit?
---
I heard it was 200% less crit. And I also heard bosses have 1000000 more armor in Classic.
---
No, it's always existed. I remember a druid on my server who would pick a new lowbie zone every day and just camp it ALL day, it's not griefing, and it's what pvp servers are for. Ever heard of Angwe?
---
Go play a pve server.
---
&gt; Angwe
---
no
---
They'll do fine on meters when it actually matters; they are really efficient
---
They don't always do well in meters when it doesn't matter because there's really not much healing needed and other classes just snipe heals with faster cast times.
---

---
Just start questing and killing, pick up professions at the first trainer I see, go go go
---
PvP realms can be really fun when people aren’t cancerous and camp you or gank you 24/7. There’s nothing to stop people from doing this. Also the one time I rolled an alliance character I got ganked so much by horde, lol didn’t realize quite how bad it was. 
---
Because I won’t be playing that often and be way behind the pack. Probably take me 3-4 months to hit 60 I’ll be leveling on a PvE server so I can just chill while I’m leveling, have a few beers and go fishing and feel comfortable not getting ganked.
---
That's fine?  I'm sure lots of players gave up on PvP realms and switched to PvE back in 2005/6, or just quit the game entirely.
---
While I like this idea conceptually at face value, I think fracturing the Classic community would not be good for this version of the game.  I’d personally rather they just cycled through Vanilla -&gt; TBC -&gt; Wrath every two years.
---
Sounds about right.
---
https://m.imgur.com/gallery/15ZDdmV
---
“Everyone’s wrong except for me”
---
Ganking low levels has always been a part of the game, regardless of if it’s on a private server or not.
---
This is the real difficulty. Getting to the raid and making sure everyone has consumables and are speced pve.
---
&gt;But many will come to our game
---
What... It's just as much their game as it is yours. You don't like the way they play it, but that's like... Your opinion man. 
---
&gt;It's pure cancer, and countless people will quit, if they're endlessly griefed by some no life virgin assholes with borderline sociopathy.
---
What's really sad, is that they are giving them a reason to camp people in phase 2. The private server meta wasn't even as toxic as what we're going to see in that phase. Private server players are going to say "blizzard servers? Woooa those are too toxic for my liking"
---
People quitting the game is the opposite of fine...
---
Yeah they have the highest possible agility over all which is good for all their classes.
---
There is a lot of good stuff here.  Great job!  It almost makes me what to play a warlock.  I think I'll stick to healing you for now though...but maybe my first alt will be a lock!
---
RemindMe! 41 days
---
No. It shouldn’t. Competitive fairness belongs in competitive settings, like esport tournaments. Retail wow tried that, and it’s been hit or miss at best (which I say having loved it for over a decade). Don’t pollute classic with this dumb notion. Pvp In WoW has nothing to do with fair, fking stop. It’s about the immersive world factor, nothing more and nothing else.
---
Definitely in the 20-30g range depending on the stage of the game. 3-5g for the transmute.
---
No. Stop it.  
---
MC: warrior&amp;rogue &gt;warlock&amp;mage
---
BWL: warrior&amp;rogue&gt;warlock&gt;mage 
---
AQ: mage&gt;warlock&gt;warrior&amp;rogue 
---
Naxx: all 4 classes are almost same
---
You can Google mountains of evidence that will yield the above results.
---
Blizz makes the game, players do the rest. Whether you wpvp or not is entirely in your hands.
---
Never heard of gankingthorn vale, yet STVietnam was its official name in 2005 and further on. So just get used to it or go to PvE server. You don't enjoy PvP, you just somewhy think that everyone should abide wih the rules of PvP you find suitable.
---
You know I love you, you fellow bear, but you know that "sub optimal as a main tank but probably the best off tank ever" is not only not the insult you're acting as though it were, but that's probably the best description of bear druid you're gonna get in a sentence. Skarm would agree -- although he'd also go on a long-winded rant about threat per second, something about missing 2 mauls, make a joke about maul rotation, insist you save that quest reward from the NE starting zone that adds 1 damage to weapon attacks for raiding, talk about MCP for a solid 5 minutes, and tell anyone who will humor him that he could murder Arthas in greens solo because he's not an idiot.
---
Clearly not lmao
---
&gt;plus 1 month free? That’s cheaper than just subbing.
---
That's not cheaper than just subbing, **that is just subbing**.
---
I've purchased two mechanical keyboards and returned them both, I've games on a membrane keyboard for 15 years, I prefer it at this point.
---
This is a good outlook, however unfortunate, you can't just raid two nights per week has holy until you get to that level. Which means actually being a holy paladin for however long that takes or spending a shitload of currency to swippity swap specs all the time.
---
100000:1 you are playing one of the OP classes.
---
It's a comparison my friend....
---
It's not a meme spec if rogues need you to pad their personal dps!
---
That's the point of 5 boxing the way he describes it. Making an entire party for himself so he doesn't have to group? I kind of feel bad for people that do that.
---
Well that's their problem if instead of looking for a solution they rather just quit the game. This is like me saying that I want more items to drop in raids otherwise I will quit. cmon now
---
You think stream sniping is against the TOS as well? It’s not.
---
Reminds me so much of Vanilla, so many fun interactions with GMs.
---
Sorry it’s been a while, but doesn’t buying physical include the 1 month free anymore?
---
I resemble that remark!
---
&gt;The private server meta wasn't even as toxic as what we're going to see in that phase. Private server players are going to say "blizzard servers? Woooa those are too toxic for my liking"
---
Good point.    I don't understand why BGs aren't in the game by at least phase 2, and the rewards in phase 3.   The BGs really help to fill the void of nothing to do.
---
Why? Classic is so easy, you don’t need supportive elements in PVE
---
No one is saying you can't be an awful player raiding with a bad guild.
---
NE or Tauren Druid?
---
Ok then let me try your style of argument
---
Please take your time to view the range of evidence from PvE in vanilla that clearly shows that the current classic implementation is correct.
---
https://youtu.be/yMeBA0D1LJY?t=51
---
Now clearly any refutation you make is clearly because you haven't got the intellect to understand the argument. Please submit a valid IQ test result before replying further.
---
I know that.  I still don't get it.
---
The danish is not safe.... There is an imposter among us, and he touched my ass.
---
Mod UI gives the dark theme. The elite dragons around the frames is something different, cannot remember the name.
---
But I like FAIR pvp.
---
Depends on your groups speed. If pulls are back to back then anger management gains value. If you're still gearing/progressing then overpower is better since downtime for drinks/buffs will be longer and more frequent. Remember that mobs can still dodge when you're behind, overpower is really strong.
---
Did you just tell someone their memory is faulty because you don't believe what they said?
---
World pvp was never fair.
---
This is you taking a side against yourself. You said hunter is the hardest class to play well, but I mentioned a power shifting well played cat has potential to out dps, but it’s a lot harder work, hence being a more difficult class to play well. Which is your argument.  
---
Outside of that I agree with you
---
It used to be mostly fair.
---
I agree. The fun argument always worries me though because thats how blizzard got us to current retail.  No one will have less fun if we ...pandas!  no one will have less fun if we...more green jesus!
---
just sayin!
---
This gets the reward for most disagreeable thing I read all werk, to be honest.
---
Heal rank 2 on a priest is bread and butter. Max rank flash heals get you oom instantly. Downranking shields is especially smart.
---
Yes, healing at the last moment with a big heal and then using five second rules is quite efficient on a paper. But in reality you want to keep people topped off sooner, get a feeling how much damage comes in and play things safe.
---
Pre 50 people pull aggro left and right and you have to adapt. What you recommend is something you gotta do in situations that will be tough to sustain. Some good examples are fights like Rivendare when you just hit 60. It can be pretty tough not to run oom and get tempted into casting a lot of flash heals.
---
most people saying they will look forward to this will enjoy about 10 minutes of wpvp and then quit to go back to retail or just camp inside instances solo farming to the end of the expac :\^). Its either that or they themselves are the basement dwellers who get off on lowbies (and lolicons)
---
Relax and take my time leveling, doing some fishing and cooking while I'm at it.
---
I've seen Naxx back in the days and I am in no hurry this time.
---
Which is a change
---
The guy at the top of this chain literally posted an example of it happening at 3:40 though
---
I mean as long as you’re specced 21/0/30 and downrank your flash of light right you should be good to heal a raid. Granted you won’t be the best and it will be pretty mindless but you can definitely still help. 
---
There’s other ways to be useful as well, buffing and cleansing. Taking engineering and bringing some repair bots, making sure you’re good on food and pots, etc.
---
Also 90% of the time, in casual raiding guilds being on time, nice, actually trying and having your shit together will get you an invite. I don’t mind wearing cloth gear to help my homies out for healing, but I’m taking it off and putting my plate back on for BGs and WPvP.
---
It's basically the same as "th"
---
Never hurts to have materials prepped early.
---
I'm intrigued. Looks epic
---
making sure I get my \[Lesser Magic Wand\] as fast as possible and possibly sell a few, although I'm not so sure people will have the money to spare but I guess we'll see
---
Sorry for the 5 week old necro but was hoping for clarification.
---
The guide says Blood fury gets better and better with more gear. My understanding(albeit from reading others thoughts not testing) was that it’s static since it’s an increase base AP. Compared to the trolls speed boost, it was said trolls end up better once gearing in AQ40.
---
Luckily, I am a government contractor and work from home. I'll be "working" really hard that week!
---
Isn't that the truth.   They're the same assholes that will go abuse DM farming, so they don't have to worry about getting ganked.
---
But wait a minute, I thought anything that prevented Wpvp was bad?  Ohh I guess that doesn't apply to shit that's too your advantage.  
---
Almost like there's a certain type of asshole that likes these pirated realm meta.
---
It's only important if:
---
You want to get a headstart at gold, spawns and nodes will be less contested earlier on as less people will be leveled.
---
You need a headstart on bis farming for more hardcore raiding. 
---
You don't want to be caught in a zerg the whole leveling process and wish to be ahead of the pack.
---
Tauren is stronger by itself, but paladins help druids better than shamans.
---
Duel people outside Orgrimmar or Stormwind if you want "fair pvp"
---
I used to do that constantly.
---
I don't have a source for this, but the 400ms batch persisted through the expansions until the end of MoP though right? Which means it would have been the standard even with modern network latency and I don't remember anyone really caring.
---
Good, then there's no issue here at all
---
Yeah, you generally don't "get anywhere" playing video games. Some people find joy in helping others, even though the people who benefit from it might never know. 
---
Kind of a sad attitude you're displaying here, really.
---
A continuous 2 year rotation would actually kill my desire to play classic beyond level 20 or so.
---
It's really hard to say, depends on your gear. 2nd point improved overpower early to help flurry uptime and when you are low gear you don't usually lose rage from using overpower. Usually at higher gear/dps you have a hard time getting a good use out of overpower procs bc of your rage gain.
---
If you are ahead enough to actually farm some of the good mobs uncontested then sure. But usually I'd just recomend continuing leveling. Getting efficient exp is more important.
---
Typically yes. If it says "increased attack power" then generally that's both ranged and melee attack power.
---
Fuck this wpvp fantasy you guys are trying to force happen.
---
I like both...
---
I'm so excited! Can't wait :) I never played the original, so I'm super excited to play this.
---
 !RemindMe 43days
---
Epic mount won't increase my dps, consumes will :O
---
1.3 is Dire Maul, so if we just go based on slotting each patch into a phase, then no, it won't be available in Phase 1. But I don't think Blizzard is forcing that rule on every item, especially between Phases 1 and 2.
---
&gt; So, what can blizzard do to prevent these people from ruining the game for everyone else? 
---
Ha ha lol. Blizzard have decided to make Phase 2 reward Honor but they don't release BGs until Phase 3. You have seen nothing, NOTHING! lol
---
Best beg made by tailoring is the Core Felcloth Bag iirc. It's 18 slots and requires 300 (max) tailoring. However the recipe only drops from MC which is a 40 man raid and I would guess it would be very expensive to buy. 
---
There's also an 18 slot bag you can get from Argent Dawn quartermaster
---
By level 31 I had 116 plus healing just buying cheap greens off the auction house.
---
Idk about that though because pandas isn't what ruined the game, and I think you have shown you think rationally enough to know that. 
---
It was the short-cuts, changed mechanics, and an overall paradigm shift to instant gratification rather than sticking to the principles that *made the game fun*.
---
The fun argument definitely has a silver lining, but imo you stay true to the base community that made your game popular. 
---
How many games have we seen go downhill by confirming to the casual community that played because the game became cool (made cool by the OGs and hardcore players ) ? Most recently: fortnite, before that? Anything EA or Activision touched after like 2010. Epic has done it before fortnite too, with Paragon. Blizz did it with pretty much anything after 4.1 in cata . 
---
Anyway, I just think the no changes argument is shit. 
---
When we played vanilla, it was ahead of it's time and we didn't even notice the little, annoying things that were actually flaws in the game. However, nowadays, if you've been playing modern games and you download a 1.12 client n played a Pserver you know that vanilla has **so many gaping flaws** that could be avoided and actually probably make the game better.
---
You will need to go to zulgurub to get the specific enchants. So no to that. But it won't be released at the start.
---
Yeah, you can grind mobs in Arathi and avoid STVietnam. Not to say early on Arathi won’t be a battleground too.
---
I don't think you know wtf you are talking about.   What random box?  I am just making an educated guess that the people that most like this system are the ones at the top on the pecking order.
---
You only want 1 shadow priest in the raid and that's only if you have 4 or more warlocks already in the raid.
---
Their purpose is Shadow Weaving, which a hybrid healing spec can accomplish just as well as a shadow priest pretending to DPS.
---
Agreed - spec 0/21/30 to get 15% fire damage along with all of the hellfire-modified talents from destruction (chance to stun, reduce interrupt, etc)
---
This narrative that shadow priests boost warlock dps is not always true.  Warlocks have higher threat, more dps means you will be more likely to be threatcapped.  Tanks on private servers have more rage than in classic.  So warlocks will have to wand or idle more with shadow vulnerability.  Shadow priests are good dps until aq40 pops around where range becomes an issue, and then the upgrades begin to focus on int and mp5.  Ill take a shadow priest not for shadow vuln, but because they are a good dude who tries hard.  
---
At the end of the day, you will have 20 core members, 10-15 members who dont try as hard but show up, and 5-10 people coming in and out of the guild.  Fill up 35 of your best, and fill out the rest with whoever puts in some amount of effort.  Any memespec works, being that classic is easier than privates, its just that memespecs need to understand they have low priority for gear.
---
i miss pre 2013 razer products. the og naga epic was bulletproof.
---
Nope.  This place is just filled with toxic private server scum.
---
This is bad advice for druids, it's easy to massively overheal with healing touch (the only spell you should be casting while leveling).
---
*"classic is gonna bomb 2 months after launch."*
---
**SHEIZ THEE ASSH TOUCHURR!!!**
---
I can Google a mountain of evidence, yet you don't bother offering any.
---
&gt;This is just an excuse to do nothing.
---
Yes?
---
uhhh, yah that makes no sense.  It was also just an analogy, and not meant to be taken literally.
---
Power curves in MMOs (and you could argue in all games) should always have diminishing returns. In other words, each incremental hour spent preparing for a raid should have less impact than every hour before that, generally speaking.
---
World buffs are bad game design (when exploited for raids — they’re super fun otherwise). Having a buff that’s worth 10+ item upgrades that takes 30 minutes to get before each raid, even with the steep downside of it being a 2hr buff that is lost on death, is just a poor game mechanic. People can disagree, but no game designer would ever build that purposefully. 
---
I’m not saying it should be changed — this was part of vanilla. But not everything in vanilla was good.
---
There are reject weapons from raids that warriors/hunters do not actually care too much for. BEfore raiding there is arcanite reaper or quested/drop weapons that you are able to pick up.
---
At best, you're using Pserver data, which is totally irrelevant. And even with your Pserver data, you're still wrong.
---
MC: Warrior &amp; Rogue &gt; Mage &gt; Warlock
---
BWL: Warrior &amp; Rogue &gt; Mage &gt; Warlock
---
AQ: Warrior &gt; Rogue &amp; Mage &gt; Warlock
---
Naxx: Warrior &gt; Rogue &amp; Mage &gt; Warlock
---
But in Classic, it's more likely going to be:
---
MC: Rogue &gt; Mage &amp; Warrior &gt; Warlock
---
BWL: Rogue &gt; Mage &amp; Warrior &gt; Warlock
---
AQ: Mage &gt; Rogue &amp; Warrior &gt; Warlock
---
Naxx: Rogue &amp; Mage &gt; Warrior &gt; Warlock
---
Shouldn't we petition blizzard to address this?   Phase 2 BGs, and gear in phase3?
---
didn't know mango played classic
---
You should probably leave then.

!RemindMe 43days
---
very nice
---
You made the analogy dude.
---
Sooooooo, you are talking to a guy who is a member of [this guild](https://www.korkron.com/). So, naaaaah.
---
And let satan win?  Not a chance.

Frost Nova, blizzard, cone of cold, repeat until dead.

Arcane explosion if mobs low on hp

Is it free to mail things to an alt? Or is the postage 30c? Won’t that cost add up over time?
---
That's how it be though.  In game and in reality.  Hot chicks rule supreme, that's just how it is.
---
Stupidest argument ever.
---
What's wrong with a guild bank?
---
&gt; but no game designer would ever build that purposefully.
---
Except they did. Kevin Jordan said they designed them to be stacked, they just didn't like how many guilds were willing to go through the trouble to get them all the time. They considered it too much work.
---
I actually really like this spec and you have swayed me from VW/bolts. Imp sounds nice early game for the Stam, and I plan to lvl with a buddy so pact is nice. 
---
As such, do you recommend imp over succ past 30 if duo lvl? Won't need imp bolts much as the duo adds extra DPS, so I get using succ auto attack solo for the extra dmg while maintaining a Mana pool.
---
Well you're not a hardcore raider so you can skip ZG all you want. You don't have to do anything you don't want to do.
---
Weird how I keep saying people comment who agree.
---
Regardless, wouldn’t matter even if that was the case. Facts are facts, and what I have said IS 100% factual.
---
I guess your right. Good thing I’m doing that university study in psychology so I can learn. Please excuse my errors, and thank you sharing your wise “educated” ways.
---
These are the same people who spam trade chat with easily googled questions.
---
 Which still isn't close to enough to make fol more mana efficient, not to mention you'll have no spell crit on your gear.
---
Can’t wait! Although I was thinking arms though
---
You can have unlimited space by mailing items to a level 1 bank char. Mail box has no limit.
---
If in doubt -&gt; mail it and google for it when you have downtime
---
Make sure what is it used for and when. 
---
Things like elemental fire are obviously going to be very expensive at the start for greater fire protection potions for example.
---
You can also hoard things for their relevant content phase. The equivalent would be elemental water for frost protection potions, that will hardly be used in pvp premades, but be mandatory for naxx.
---
Small eggs sell for 4 copper and are only used during the winter holiday event where you can sell 5 for 1-2g when the AH is being rushed, being worth 500-1000x their vendor value.
---
Not sure but I believe it’s the same as spell hit chance, depends on the mob ( its level ). Some extra hit on gear would probably do it.
---
I think only the boss addon for raiding. I am terrible at looking at things like threat meter so I have never used it. I have always played with default UI anyway. I will most likely mouse macro all my attacks anyway.
---
I doubt they will make it public until they've gotten their character names.
---
If horde raids bring a shaman for every group aren’t some inevitably going to be ele or enhance?
---
Gnome has a little more Int for PvE and Escape Artist is occasionally useful in PvP for Mage. Human gets nothing for PvE DPS and Perception is a pretty bad PvP racial. You do however get nice rep bonuses as Human
---
I report every one of then as it's against the tos to use those characters.
---
Slowly level and make a note to myself to not spend any gold that I don’t have to. In order to save up for the first mount. And then the fast mount. 
---
I will most likely also pick up engineering and mining and mine as I level.
---
STV is a great zone ruined by assholes.  As far as skipping it goes, look at this guide.  [https://www.joanasworld.com/speedruns/#fullmenu](https://www.joanasworld.com/speedruns/#fullmenu)
---
According to this speed running guide, you spend very little time in STV, so it would be quite easy to just grind these levels or do additional quests in the other zones.
---
ZG is the best instance in the game.  I am not sure why you would want to skip it.
---
You can heal with zero talent points as a druid as long as you have int gear.
---
If you are really concerned 0/30/21 works well, Feral NS
---
Unfortunately i have. Midrun i decided to fury tank the rest of the dungeon.
---
Link to said guide please?
---
Only essential ones like swing timer and lazypig. Lazypig sells junk items automatically and accepts/turns in quests automatically by holding Shift.
---
[No it isn't](https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/34530):
---
&gt; Accented characters are supported.
---
I always laugh at the logic that below average guilds one shot all content. I remember being part of these guilds during part of my vanilla escapades with bad guilds,... You wipe... All... The... Time.
---
50 pummelers is spot on for consistency
---
If you aren't a hardcore raider, then the upgrades you get from ZG are just that much more impactful.
---
I started out just north of 'ambivalent' on this, but as time moves forward I'm getting more and more interested, even excited. Reading stuff like this is getting me stoked.
---
Create a character
---
This would probably create an imbalance in and of itself. The second one faction starts to be a little more populated people will just reroll
---
Thats why i have been leading them while i raid other raids with guild.
---
Once again, I'm going to ask you.  Do you really not understand which part of your post was speculative?
---
Personally Im rely digging the idea of Druid, but I agree with your survivalist mentality and am approaching the game at a slow pace. For some reason the idea of taking it slow and maxing myself out sounds really fun, and that definitely wasnt the case back in the day. Probably just a symptom of being more patient and mature now than I was during release.
---
As far as the class goes, I've been testing a lot of classes on pservers. I just really enjoy the ability to do anything I want, and I dont plan on getting to into raids so the min/maxxing doesnt bother me.
---
Alliance or Horde? Hope to run across you one way or another!
---
Lortiui maybe
---
You’re obviously confused. No biggie
---
Pservers are far more accurate u might think. Sorry to break it to you, but you are years behind son.
---
Ya no kidding. It would be a lot cheaper that way.
---
I don't understand why you would DI someone to save them from Burning Adrenaline. Having your healer alive is infinitely more useful than a DPS that probably won't even get that proc again.
---
Lol so that's a no?  Oh sweetie...
---
Sweetie? 
---
Weird
---
Have you ever seen a male dwarf Paladin?? They are the dumbest looking in literally every tier for Paladins 
---
If you roll male Paladin idk wtf is wrong with you
---
Hence why I said “this period”.
---
Ah. My thought, and I’m assuming the other posts I saw, was that base is naked AP. Curious to see how this plays out on live servers because that would be a big difference and I could see this being on of those stat discrepancies of pservers(like sands being treated as full ranged weapons)
---
T2 is really good for holy too
---
Absolutely. I mean technically for mana efficiency you could heal alright with holy 20/ 31 Prot. But I don’t really see a point going deep into Prot outside of a PvP build for reckoning. I like the early Prot tier trees but never really liked the deep holy trees.
---
....lol?
---
You are completely wrong
---
I've decided to run a rogue and a warrior. Which should I level up first? Is there any benefit to choosing one as my main over the other?
---
There’s one in southern winter spring in the caves where the demons are, a little imp that sells 1 restockable felcloth if I remember correctly
---
Feral Tank is superior to Warrior in 5 mans at pretty much all stages of the game I think.
---
Say something to the effect of "Holy crap there's a lot of people here!"
---
Your exactly the type of person i like to gank lol.
---
Friends? Being concerned about ME? I don't know what either of those things are.
---
I’m taking it slow too on a mage. I don’t have the same kind of time I used to, but I’m happy that the leveling will be more enjoyable than retail. I won’t feel so behind even if I go at my own pace.
---
If the guild management plans correctly and well, manages the guild and forms it the way they want then yes, it should be the absolute best composition just about every time.
---
Probably not :-) we're quite casual
---
 #notmyorc
---
Can you pm where to find those guides, please?
---
Does it really have no limit though? I reached a point on pserver where I had to clear out some mail on my bank alt.
---
uhh what? You will see locks topping meters on various bosses throughout vanilla.
---
I dont think these other people are lying to you, but memory is a funny thing and we are all getting older. Its been over 10 years. 
---
Servers all have different cultures, as well. I was on US Sargeras playing Alliance. Now it wasnt as bad as it is now, but that server has always been Alliance dominated which probably colored my experience a bit.
---
Then roll Horde.
---
I didn't say it was. but you're not going to take 14 fury warriors into a raid group.
---
The game came out in a different era. Even though wow was considered extremely casual at the time. No blizzard is not going to implement dks to low levels for carebares like yourself that cant handle gameplay within the rules of the tos. Either level up, call friends to help or go roll on a carebear server.
---
Rolling on a pvp server you know this is going to happen to you at one point or another. It is what it is.
---
Don’t downvote me again
---
Yes I'll add up but almost any white item is worth 30c.
---
Noice! thx for the response i was gonna farm those demons on my lock so this will be a perfect vendor ty!
---
&gt;*"But PVP should be a fair fight"*
---
You must have world PVP confused with duelling outside Orgrimmar.
---
For serious guilds? Yes you should be the best comp if not 1/2 classes off every time.
---
Not the method PVE server since they're from EU, but yeah the PVP guys of Method will all be in the same servers as every other NA streamers. I'm so happy to be from EU :D
---
My favorite thing about engineering are the teleports. I prefer the gadgetstan one, but it saves so much time I would do it just for that.
---
If you want to do both I recommend going with the PvP advantage. The PvE racials are nice to have but won't be something game changing. In a raid you wont think man I wish I had a that 1% dodge chance or 10 nature resist. But in PvP you will be thinking I wish I had a 3 second stun and extra hp.
---
I’ve seen that clip, and Kevin is saying what I’m saying.
---
Yes, they designed the buffs mechanically to be stacked. What they did not intend was that guilds would stack them relentlessly in raids to huge effect, incentivizing to the weird behavior we currently see (accumulating buffs over days and logging out in between). In the clip he literally calls it a mistake that they didn’t anticipate it.
---
FWIW you’ll hopefully find that to be more fulfilling, and at the same time helping society! Who knows maybe you’ll make some WoW friends there .
---
Why a gnome lock
---
I don't think it's malicious lying.  I think they're just misremembering things.
---
It mostly has to do with the Asian/International markets. You know the whole K-pop beautification culture? It's kind of a big deal over there so they had massive faction imbalance because all the horde races where "ugly". They added belfs specifically for this reason.
---
He also sells an item used for the tier 0.5 quest chain, so if you end up going for the set it's helpful to know how to get t him.
---
You stun the enemy, blow your bubble and use HS to GTFO to safety.
---
Could try using ESDF for movement and rebind everything around those keys so her finger never has to move more than one key away from movement?
---
You are wrong...  You saw one stupid video of a mage being ganked that played like shit, and was fucking around.
---
You sound weak
---
ah neat I doubt I will but maybe eventually just to have the set for shits. ty
---
You get absolutely shit on by rogues
---
No, he specifically says it was a mistake because of the work involved. He never once mentions they're too powerful.
---
Get a Mouse with those extra 9 buttons on it, make her keybind with the mouse, normally and with useing Shift and Alt.  
---
and just move with WSAD. 
---
Would that work ?
---
Will look for a PvP first thing then thank you. Havn't decided on Mage, Priest or Warlock yet and I won't stress over Rank 14. Thank you
---
This right here is good logic. Dont want to be camped relentlessly...roll on a pve server absolutely nothing wrong with that.
---
But dont try and change the way the game is beacuse you personally dont like it when there are multiple solutions to this problem that dont require blizzard intervention
---
It’s a meme idk people say “me, an intellectual”
---
Multiboxing is a lot of fun though
---
This isn’t about toxicity it’s about game design. This was the way it was designed since it was implemented. Even the developers griefed each other when they first had the option to.
---
Nice guide. But I think drain tanking specifically means using drain life while tanking melee hits from a mob or player.
---
It's mostly nostalgia. Even at the time I didn't find it funny, but if you found something funny in the past, you'll find it funny now.
---
He doesn't "make it work". Even his strat live runs are awful and worse than what warriors can provide, in the instance paladins should shine in.
---
You live in a fucking fantasy, if you think this is the norm.
---
How old are you OP?  Genuinely interested as I’m trying to understand the WoW community in its current demographic state.
---
Did you went in person in the shop to test all kind of switches red, blues, brown etc. I can defiantly feel its quicker then the Lycosa a little bit higher keys but nice travel of the browns after 5h i am defiantly getting used to it but i love it. Good thing i plan a head and bought it with enough time to get used it before Classic is out!
---
I've never messed with the standard controls, but I've rekeyed some settings before so this'll be easy. She's had a hard time using shift and alt for the same reason, but maybe this'll change that
---
i saw nothing and have no clue what you are talking about. i played on private server recently. i didnt say 2 level 30s. Between 5 and 10? absolutely.
---
am going to run a prot warrior tank.  Question is.. do I level only as prot warrior.. or do I start out as arms or fury first then drop talents in prot tree at level 20/25/etc?
---
Thx!!
---
I rolled a horde cow warrior as a bit of a lark back in Vanilla after I had 2 60 alliance toons and a MC raiding guild that I was an officer in.  This was pretty early days, before ZG.
---
Leveled to about 15 on and off and then went off to Redridge.  Did a bunch of PvP and had a great time. Even had a bunch of 60s trying to chase me down despite the fact the people I was ganking were high level than me. 
---
Later my raiding guild self destructed on Major Domo and I decided to just keep on leveling my flow picking cow warrior. I found a casual raiding guild and I had a great time playing horde for the rest of vanilla.
---
Why don’t you take a seat over there.
---
" Without an organised group it makes little difference to a class which shouldn't even be healing in the BG. "  
---
You don't think priests should be healing in a BG?
---
&gt;  a couple of lvl 30 guys CAN kill a level 60
---
&gt;I remember the sub going wild over this a few days ago. 
---
What doesn't this sub go crazy over? I'm sure we'd fill a 4 day sticky post about how some texture in a wall isn't period correct.
---
With only a 16 debuff slot limit, which chosen debuffs are the worthy few when it comes to a 40 man raid?
---
I don't gank, although I'll often try to get you back if you kill me. For random engineers, I usually just wave and hope that other players will leave me alone.
---
But ganking lowbies has always been part of the game. It's annoying, but you either live with it or play PvE.
---
Been debating between Hunter and Warrior for ages.
---
Warrior: Getting a fat weapon upgrade and just notice the big difference.
---
Hunter: The immersion of being a Hunter, chase pets and explore the world with your companion.
---
However will prob be Warrior, I can’t miss out the opportunity of those Vanilla weapons!
---
I will definitely pitch the idea. I'll try to report back with thoughts. Thanks very much. I'll do anything to keep her excitement up.
---
Me not that kind of orc
---
i can verify to that this Lycosa in the picture its 2008 and still working pretty much fine. Just the keys plastic got little fragile and i braked some of the space and shift supports after cleaning.
---
https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/couple
---
seriously?
---
Yeah, sounds about right.
---
Blizz didn't design the game for you to be a toxic lil shit.  Get real.
---
Survival spec really shuts down rogues and warriors.
---
Everyone in this thread is talking about Aimed Shot and I'm over here dreaming about Wyvern Sting and Counter Attack.
---
A LEPRECHAUN? IMMA HANG EM BY HIS FEET AND BEAT HIM UNTIL THE GOLD FALLS OUT
---
Sounds like Vanilla wow.  Pro-tip it's impossible to camp someone with invisibility potions.  Carry some if you play on a PvP server.
---
Can't tell if shitpost or if OP has transferred to visual art the low effort ethic that launched a thousand undead rogue PvP videos set to Linkin Park.
---
Yeah just run dungeons between 32 and 42.
---
People sign up for War, and then become POWs....
---
The point of my statement was if you took one as a dps
---
As far as I'm concerned Human Male is the only way to go for paladins
---
How hard will raid spots be for hunters? Do hunters fall off in BG pvp as much as they do in PvE after MC?
---
This is some sound analysis and brought up some points that I hadn’t considered.
---
One other word of wisdom if you go the naga route, you can press both mouse buttons to act as your move forward key, then use 1&amp;2 to strafe left and right then 10 binds to use. (I honestly might do this when the game launches, since I love being able to play Diablo with one hand)
---
You want something like this: https://www.amazon.com/RAZER-Tartarus-Progammable-Detachable-Mecha-Membrane/dp/B07754PYFK
---
I’ve used the G13 for years but they don’t make that anymore.
---
The left thumb uses the joystick for movement. This leaves all 4 left fingers for spell keys. She won’t get lost on the keys because she won’t be trying to contort her fingers around wasd.  This setup is actually better all around, even for hard core raiders.
---
Thumb stick does wsqe and she will use mouse right click to turn her character.  She won’t even know that a d keyboard turning exists.
---
I bind mouse thumb button to jump, and left thumb “click” to auto run. (Not sure if this model has a click thumb stick.
---
It is actually pretty quick to get used to.
---
I bind all the buttons to 1-90+- and numpad 0-9+-.
---
I do an alt key as well, but that’s probably overkill. Most players don’t need more than 20 bound spells.
---
Id recommend doing Ench+Tailoring to get your first wand around level 10ish, just farm up those 58 cloth.  It'll make your DPS and mana efficiency about double.  But I dont plan to level up enchanting beyond those first 1 or 2 wands.
---
Change her keybinds. I switched from clicking to all keybinds several years ago and use a similar layout across all characters and games now.
---
123456 qety
---
asdfgh xcvb
---
I use W and R to strafe left and right, mouse for the rest of movement, I don't backpedal. This moves my hand right slightly and up a row, making it easier to hit my keybinds without looking. I use ctrl modifiers and macros if/when needed. I'd encourage a mouse with 10ish buttons or more, too, so she can either bind heals to it or her spammy rotation abilities to save action bar space. I started healing with a 3 button mouse, it's playable with a lot of modifiers, but a 10+ button mouse is a game changer. I don't play a lot of DPS/tanks, but I did take to binding my most frequently used abilities on the few non-healers I leveled.
---
I think for a game controller to work she's going to have to keybind a lot of her abilities to button combinations. There are far too many abilities that should be accessible regardless of content or spec for a simple controller layout to handle, but button combinations should work.
---
Ty
---
Nope their primary functions are to defensivley/offensively dispel, manaburn, and shield, with healing in emergencies only. They're awful pvp healers when compared to the other classes. In pugs they're even worse healers as they constantly need baby sitting.
---
Interesting. That does seem familiar from Diablo!
---
On the beta or on pserver?
---
Who could forget that?
---
/shout WE ARE HOME !
---
I'll probably use UI addons like XPerl
---
Then i'll use the best addons for me : my brain.
---
It's gonna give me so much pride/satisfaction/fun when i'll be able to accomplish things myself and not by looking at a tool telling me what/when/how to do.
---
&gt; then complaining about how unfair war is.
---
You mean like every war story ever told?
---
I enjoy listening to his stuff, but he does have a super low production quality.
---
 Record a dungeon or raid run and play it in the background. Read a script for 10+ minutes. occasionally splash a screen shot of an item or image for not enough time to read it. No links in description, no demonstrations or discussions as far as positioning, rotations, key layout, etc.
---
I normally have a farming alt that is a miner / herbalist. I usually go druid.  60 feral druid can cat dps them easily.  most packs you can onky agro 3/5 if you are careful. with half-decent gear you prob can.
---
Implying that most of the people playing classic come from the retail community to begin with.
---
Why would this be trying to impress people? I'm just sharing a screenshot about the end event. 
---
For a lot of us this was a bit if an important moment.
---
Good balance to me is when things are weaker and stronger than each other in different areas. A rogue should always do more sustained boss damage than a shaman or druid. Even with worse gear. If shamans do more dps and provide tons of utility, why even bring a rogue? This has been a huge issue in retail honestly, where certain classes just dont get a single raidspot because they have no niche. There is literally nothing they provide over what ever is OP at the time.  
---
In vanilla a druid will always have brez and innervate. Shamans have totems. I am more than happy to ONLY drop totems and not use a single other ability, I think totems are a ton of fun.  
---
itemization also have some of these same philosophies, but I wont go super into it, because its honestly just too much for me to type right now. But in essence, great balance = inequality.
---
Are those addons essential ? Meaning that we can't clean the PvE content without them ?
---
So in your opinion the dps as a druid - in this case i think feral is the best choice- is viable?
---
Also i think druid is definitely funnier to play.
---
Probably not, seems like gameplay automation.
---
You are in extreme denial if you don't think ferals will tank in Classic. They tanked in vanilla and will continue to do so.
---
If they are going purely off the reference client, then to them it doesn't matter if it was intended back then or not.  #nochanges. /s
---
Depends on the mouse. My corsair had to bind the abilities to the F keys then bind the keys on the mouse to the F keys. Wasn't hard just an extra step.
---
I have similar problems with finding all my keys when it gets hectic and I play shaman so I have to find a workaround
---
I keep seeing that orc face all over, where does everyone keep finding it?  
---
I posted it originally on MMO-C like 5 years ago and now it seems to have spread like wildfire on these memes lol
---
Hunter is a great choice also.
---
heck of a challenge at launch
---
What do you think  “Hardest class to do well with by far” even means? Doing well is subjective. The parent comments are talking mostly pve which generally means the amount of work it takes to put out competitive dps. I take it you’ve never played a feral Druid in first couple expansions? It’s more exhausting than any other class timing shifts with energy ticks, and having farm requirements in order “to do well with”
---
Setting up options and keybindings as I autorun to turn in quests and run to new areas
---
of course it’s viable in PvP. PvE is different though.
---
I use the old N52TE, the new version is the razer nostromo, really easy to use and if her hands are small you can use it without the rest pad part and its even easier to reach keys whilst still being comfortable. I like it cause it's got so many buttons in a small area. Just the thumb has it's own d-pad.
---
I think this is a pipe dream, and a lofty one at that. Blizz has already stated they are open to the idea of TBC after some time. If Classic is a success I think it is inevitable that TBC gets released.
---
You want to start at the same zone so I think if you do Horde, it's Priest+Lock. If you play Alliance it depends if you like to run Teldrassil or Dun Morogh.
---
Hi, /u/chronosthesage
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cd6cle/noob_how_do_i_join_a_discord_server_so_i_can/). 
---
Whoosh
---
Doubt it, people are going to make it work knowing what to build from the beginning.
---
I was in a naxx clearing guild and we let the druids tank every once in a while and let them raid as DPS, because melee just wanted more crit to top meters more. 
---
The issue was, they only started thinking to spec feral once green dragons started dropping feral hammers, they were also not buying off spec tank gear because it hurt their priority for heal gear.
---
We did have a druid try to buy the drake fang talisman and another boots of shadow flame, with no real evidence they had any sort of tanking sets made at the time, so we denied them the trinket.
---
But overall, the differences between private servers and live won't matter in the end. Just means dual wield tanks will need more gear. And if the end of beta is anything, they spawned ragnaros and people found the armor was a couple thousand less than private servers, so it's easier to get zero armor on bosses possibly.
---
Tanks will hate you if you don’t use KTM
---
&gt;The danger of Overpower is overrated
---
Uh an arms warrior might take 20-30% of your health out...in one shot. With some shit like ashkandi even more like 30-40%.
---
The mouse wheel can be pressed left, right, or down which is a nice feature that I didn't expect. I use left/right for forward/back when internetting.
---
Finish orc starting zone and then run with my sorry troll to Mulgore to enjoy the scenery
---
You can take whatever you want in a raid and still clear everything. But locks are in the same boat as hunters. You want hunters for tranquilizing shot and locks for their utility, curses, healthstones, and soulstones. Their dps is nice but if you want more dps you'll be better off with a warrior/rogue/mage
---
At level 30+ there are a few places you can make a lot of gold by grinding mobs, definitely worth if you need gold for the mount or need a level or two before moving on to the next zone.
---
Maybe faster, maybe about same, maybe slightly slower.
---
I don't think anyone should multibox to lvl faster.
---
I think the dungeon xp seems to be great for everyone that want to multibox to multibox since questing as a multiboxer is a pain in vanilla.
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
pfUI and pfQuest are two of my big ones. I bloody love them.
---
Fuck that and eff you 2. This beta should not be behind an asinine paywall, and plebs should not defend corporate greed.
---
What about mana? I’d run out after the first rotation.
---
You mean the wars where people were drafted and didn’t have a choice?

Super important tool in making meat that doesn't suck.

You are paying $5 for the box basically.

She may want to visit a doctor.
---
I bought mine back in Jan. for all of my previous play I'd just done the normal keyboard binds etc. Changed the entire way I play. Extremely easy to use. I have a corsair as I like their products and they fit my hand better, but for a woman a razer may be more comfortable as they're narrower. Most bestbuys have them so you can test how they feel etc and then just get them to pricematch amazon lol.
---
I have confidence that they may re-release TBC and WOTLK.  But I also have confidence that they'll have the sense to make those expansions optional, not mandatory (I.E. TBC and WOTLK servers).  In which case, my dream is still intact.
---
Personally, the key to keep having fun is to not overplay.
---
Roccat Nyth has customizable buttons for the thumb, if she likes the idea but doesn't want the 12 grid
---
Hey the new models look pretty dope. Give em a shot!
---
That second one actually looks pretty cool. Not very paladin-esque, but still cool.
---
Most posts you've made in this thread have come off as whiny, but this one in particular.

No one who's ever been a part of those big WPVP fights in vanilla would ever say something like this.
---
For most of vanilla I recall it being inline with arcanite. 3-5G for a cooldown. And in the 25-30g range. No idea about PS but thats how I recall it.
---
Yea when a game is stale but server keeps going the economies are a mess. I see this on all old games I play like AO,EQ, SWG.
---
The guy with the cows is up to no good and the guarda just look the other way smh
---
Thats just it though, it's WPVP, if you dont want to get corpse camped play a PVE server as has been stated multiple times. People are giving you sound advice: afk a bit, get friends to help, bring pots and other consumables to help etc. Classic wow isnt going to change. If you dont want to be corpse camped go play Hello Kitty Island Adventure.

that's why i want buttons for right hand thumb then you never have to move your hand, to be honest it takes a time to learn and even longer to unlearn then old setup but she will have it easier sins there is noting to unlearn. This is also perfect if she for some reason want to brake in to FPS games you can use d pad to give commands to team
---
Is anyone using a horse guide that isn’t Joanna’s? Right now it’s the only reliable source but would love to look at some others as I plan my route.
---
Roughly 25g on LH-ND.
---
Roughly 20g on K3.
---
On Mannoroth-Horde around what would be Phase 5, they were roughly 20g.
---
Aug 1st will be a waste. 10Th at the earliest but name day should be fine.
---
Probably around the same, 15-20G for the 4-day cooldown.
---
I can't wait to find out whatever realm Asmongold/Esfand/all the streamshitter fanboys will go on and then go as absolutely far away from there as possible.
---
Obligatory "it depends, yada yada yada"
---
Probably between 15 and 20g each on the ah. Mooncloth has a pretty steady demand across the phases but will spike in p4 when bloodvine gear comes out. The CD will go for more than arcanite because it's longer and because the profit margin is higher when selling on the ah. Probably 10g just for the CD.
---
&gt; No one who's ever been a part of those big WPVP fights in vanilla would ever say something like this.
---
Because they damn near never happened.
---
Providing PvE and RP realms for people to play on, like they did back in Vanilla.
---
I like doing what I want, when I want to. Having the world to quest/farm/dungeon/raid without inturruption, while having BG's for when I want to PvP is ideal. Ill PvP alot, I just dont want to do it whe I'm trying to quest.
---
None of my time gets wasted. Which being 30+ years old now, is super appealing.
---
Thank you for a mouse recommendation. That one looks very customizable. Some combination of using more buttons on hey right hand and changing up the left hand should solve this!
---
Both games share a subscription, so yes, this will work.
---
Human's increased spirit racial means more mana from evo i believe but it's not a big boost.
---
I am starting to think I agree with this.
---
&gt;Classic's success is hanging by a thread to begin with.
---
lmao
---
Mate what the fuck is this
---
It saddens me greatly that vanilla has no Peggle addon.
---
you can also get a mouse whit a modifier button for right hand thumb like ROCCAT typhon then she won't have to move hand for shift+ binds
---
Good point! I'll call over to best buy to check if they have a good model. Sometimes it's hard to look at a thing online and tell if it'll be comfortable
---
Check discord, you’ve been kicked.
---
Yea, I think a lot of people have tunnel vision on the "no changes" policy, but I still think Blizz should be VERY careful with changes, but about the leeway I am also leaning towards you're answer
---
Soda has said one of two things. He's either specifically going to go to a server the rest of them aren't on to try and get away from it, or he's going to go offline for 3 months and enjoy it so he doesn't get streamsniped...which means in 3 months it's a roll of the dice since when he reveals his server they'll swarm there too.
---
Really it's a shitty situation all around.
---
Are those the pants?
---
WTF are you even talking about.   Talking to a wall.
---
1 major problem with that site, the name search is case sensitive so new people not knowing that won't find any of their friends.
---
That's a really good and efficient idea of she uses more mouse binds! That should definitely be her first one. In fact, I may use that too! I use shift a lot, but not alt as much as I'd like. This may improve my gaming.
---
And you sound toxic
---
Dammit, that description of an Orc made me change my mind on what to play for the 14th time. An orc melting things out of stealth then slipping off into the shadows is pretty cool.
---
Taking to a wall? You commented on my comment bro. Don’t add in your 2 cents then get upset when you get confused.
---
I am seriously questioning whether you have the reading comprehension of a fucking 5 yo.
---
Okay, if this doesn't remove the remaining challenge of the raids it's fine then \^\^
---
I thought threat was a challenge during Vanilla, but if an addon can tell you your threat state, is it still a challenge ? I won't have to use my threat reducing spell in my dps rotation ?
---
No. While Arcanite and Mooncloth do have similar pricing history, the materials for Arcanite make up ~75% of the cost whilst the materials for Mooncloth only make up ~15% of the cost.
---
I don’t see why you have to talk to me that way. 😂
---
I'm not familiar with the story context but the delivery of the line and idea of a gnome having his ass touched got a chuckle out of it.
---
Is this an old YouTube series? It looks so familiar.
---
No changes, it was ok back then and it will be ok now. 
---
If you're that mentally soft that someone saying kys over the internet will be what pushes you over the edge then you were a ticking time bomb and lost cause to begin with.
---
Backstory, lvl 17 hunter was mad that I (lvl 27 Pally) didn’t save him at VC because our group in general was very low lvls and my focus was keeping the lvl 18 squishy War alive. I still rezzed him and ensured he completed his quests.
---
Pretty sure you can config your settings if you're already paying to reserve the names anyway.
---
Looking forward to this too. I'll be playing a Shadow Priest primarily for PvP, will get the Rank 10 set, Anathema, some off-set items from ZG and BWL and then the character will be set for a lifetime. Sure it will be weaker than a Shadow Priest in Rank 13 gear or fully optimized Naxx items, but this won't be as common as people make it out to be. SPs/Rets/Enhancement ect get a lot of mileage out of their PvP sets.
---
In BFA, even though gear is handed out everywhere for free, the gear treadmill moves so quickly. You can take a break for a month and already the character will feel obsolete.
---
It's ironic that they made this system to please casual players, when actually casual players feel more disillusioned by it than ever.
---
Orc all the way if minmaxing is all you truly care about. Hardiness is just stupid OP and gives you an insane advantage against all other rogues and can basically ruin any paladins day. Plus im fairly certain it should work against Blackout which would be so very helpful vs shadow priests.
---
I hope not. I want to be clean of addons except of UI. Do you think i won't be able to get invite in raid without this addon ? I thought addons were optionals :(
---
Priests, warlocks and warriors have fear.
---
While the only other class that can be scary with stuns is rogue tbh. While the stun resist is nice and all, the WoTF is consistent ability.
---
I would go undead.
---
HS is just a rage dump for tanking. Generally just tab target cycle and spam sunders, use some aoe and keep focus on the main target. A good dps should not only manage threat but also be able to stun when you move on to the next target or burn it before taking damage. 
---
I generally switch to build rage on the next target around 20-30% left on current target depending on the group.

---
Unfortunately she can’t play the game. You could, theoretically, rebind the keys so that she would find it easy to control her character. However, such complex instruction will be daunting to a wife, and will cause her to immediately quit the game.  
---
The above seems like a stupid as fuck statement doesn’t it?
---
Teach her the concepts of character control and rebind the keys to surround the WASD movement area. It will be easier.
---
Except its not, and even if it was it wouldn't make it wrong.
---
My theory is that TBC is what the classic team will start working on as soon as they get through all the unforeseen problems of launch.
---
It's the internet, trolls and assholes everywhere. Get used to it. Just report and ignore.
---
I already saw tanks using it while tanking, as a healer I was quite pissed off, the guy did not know about the heal reduction debuff!
---
Same. Although streamsniping payo and musclebrah and/or mining their ore has been hilarious.
---
Pulling threat can many times guarantee a wipe in raids. If you are purposely being ignorant to addons like KTM you are honestly kind of a jackass for purposely putting your raid in a situation where they could potentially wipe because you have some wild aversion to any and all addons. You really dont need many addons to raid properly but KTM is one of them you should have.
---
In classic just say "Reported" and ignore them. Believe me, it'll steam him/her wayyy more than if you said anything else. Also, once he/she calms down, they'll get all paranoid.
---
If a small child can do it your girlfriend can do it.
---
Report him, ignore him and move on.
---
It's harder to avoid the shit when people are flinging it toward you ¯\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Great! I've seen the elven one before - is there a dwarf counterpart?
---
The challenge is finding a tank who can produce enough TPS to allow the dps to dps enough to down the boss before the healers are oom.  That is the balance challenge. 
---
You going over the tanks threat enough to pull and wiping the raid isn't a challenge to overcome, its stupid. The mod allows you to know when you are approaching the max threat you can have before you pull and allowing you to use your threat reduction talent as needed, rather than on rotation so thus increasing your dps. And some classes \*cough\* dps warrior\*cough\* have no threat reduction and pull off at a much lower threat since they're in melee rather than ranged.   
---
Blizz hasn't given out the threat numbers, so its all guesswork/testwork. The threat meters work very well but its all material that has been gathered by other people and assembled. Its just a tool like any other addon and it certainly doesn't take the "last challenge" away since if you are riding right on the max level of dps you can, right behind the tank on threat and get a few rapid crits in a row.... you've pulled.
---
Not knowing how to take a screenshot is worst than racism. Change my mind.
---
Tried it didn't show as option, do I need a subscription before?
---
You clearly meant 2 30s could kill a 60, and then doubled down, and now you are trying to weasel your way out with some bullshit semantics.  Stop lying.
---
Maybe +spell hit?
---
I think sometimes people forget that some of us actually do like being healbuffbots and don't want to DPS.
---
This thread, this idea, but most of all this OP, are a complete joke.
---
If I were you, I would get the grooved WASD kit from Corsair for her keyboard. Then get her an mmo mouse like a razor naga.
---
And then you continued to reply to him even after he called you a racial slur. You can’t complain about these things but also do nothing to stop it/further escalate the situation.
---
Orc is always best at pvp.
---
Must have been awful at the game then. I never had any issues tanking any dungeon on my recent Paladin.
---
Obviously, but anyone reading this knows this person is just complaining about being ganked and thinks they can change things. They cannot. they need to get over it, therefore they have two options; log off and log back in after some time, hoping that person is gone or move to a different zone.

---
Just stop with the "big wpvp battles never happened", you're starting to sound like the Spongebob meme at this point. The whining by itself is pathetic enough, no need to push falsehoods just because it suits your PvE realm agenda.
---
Blizzard already counters this just fine by having Normal (non-pvp) realms.
---
As for anecdotal experience, I've always played on a PvP realm in classic and TBC, and incessant corpse camping was not a common thing that I've experienced. Sometimes it did happen, but you have options to deal with it. Firstly, you could resurrect near your body behind something, in bushes, etc, and then hearth out; this was usually successful for me. Secondly, you can resurrect at the graveyard that is away from your body and take some durability damage and wait 10 minutes for the resurrection sickness to subside. Thirdly, you can log out while dead, go take care of something irl for 10+ minutes, or log into an alt to level, or check mail/AH, etc., and its unlikely the corpse camper is still going to be there when you get back, because they don't have very long attention spans.
---
If this is too much of a problem for you, then just don't play on a PvP server? Pretty simple solution.
---
Hahahahahahahaha How The Fuck Is Cyber Bullying Real Hahahaha Just Walk Away From The Screen Like Close Your Eyes Haha
---
A friendly reminder that people who play games these days are beyond fucking sensitive and never once learned to ignore nonsense. Instead they take everything a 15 year old says over the internet literally instead of “lol” and then putting them on ignore. 
---
Not you, not Blizzard, not the Pope, nor Obama, not even mother fucking Keanu will change the way people behave with anonymity.  All you demonstrate is that you’re easily triggered, and that you somehow have authority on how others are allowed to conduct themselves. You don’t. Move on. 
---
As for myself, I imagine the corpulent noisome Blizzcon attendees are the ones downvoting me or talking shit to me, and it’s almost impossible for me to stop laughing at the pathetic trash talk. Try it.
---
Forget racials. Gnomes will have a few hundred more mana in BIS gear and .4% extra crit (or some negligibly small number) compared to human but human have +spirit. Net dps is almost identical. The math has been done. 
---
Gnome if you are very serious about PvP. But even escape artist isn’t game breaking. Choose what you like.
---
Both are really good but I think Orc is better. Your hardest counter will be Warriors and other Rogues who get the opener. Resisting a stun or charge can flip the fight in your favor immensely. 
---
Will is also powerful but there’s not that many Alliance Warlocks and Spriests.
---
You said its not a valid argument not that it isn't a good one.
---
I mean the traditional way to make gold will be bad goings as a protection warrior or a healer but it just means you adapt to your strengths.
---
There is a load of ways people use to make their coin, and to me it enforces the MMORPG aspect of WoW moreso. You are a healer, and as such you need friends to propel you to your potential. Are you a respected tank so much that people want to pay for your services? Dope. 
---
When I played a resto shaman I found that I had to go about my gold making in a different way. I found a fun warrior pal from my guild and 2 manned diremaul, he would mine, I would disenchant. Another one was that I would team up with a rogue friend and farm the scarlet dudes in EPL for raw gold, and enchanting recipes, we were more efficient together and if PVP tried to take over the spot we would win. If I didn't have a friend to play with I would hit up my herbalism spots. I eventually found out I could solo the caster demons in winterspring to farm eyes of shadow, I would get one every few hours but I doubt other healing classes can kill them without grounding totem and shocks *(just thought i'd toss that tidbit in here)*
---
If I could just switch to a DPS at a moments notice then it becomes more of a single player, do it yourself self sufficient way. You miss out on the interactions the game forces you to take to be profitable. It's just like questing, if all the quests could be solo'd we would do it but we would miss out on the interactions group questing brings us.
---
Yeah not being able to benefit from a PVP spec all the time sucks but that is also another thing I enjoy. The high end PvPers are always known on the server, they are the ones that dedicate to being 99% full time PVP. They have their own image in the world just as a respected tank or healer does.
---
Plus, everyone else is rocking PvE specs in battlegrounds unless they are the PVP players usually, so its not the biggest downside in the world if everyone else is as gimped as you are.
---
That’s what I was worried about, but I figured I’d would run an ample amount of dungeons to the point where I’ll be geared relative to my level.
---
No i did not, that would be absurd. But whatever, whatever makes you sleep better.
---
Using racial slurs is something we as a community should stigmatize but frankly, it's such a goofy lil game, there's nothing too wrong with a little rough play. I agree with other posters, you had the better cards. This player is a stupid lil shit. Tell them you reported them and let them stew.
---
Lol no girls play wow.
---
&gt; Look, I get where you're coming from, but instead of just saying "No, it wasn't in the original game!", give me a solution to how you would expect to handle guild banks in the modern environment of account sharing being much more difficult.
---
First of all: "No, it wasn't in the original game!" is a perfectly acceptable reason. It is not game breaking not to have it. You seem to argue the opposite, but if you have any experience with vanilla you would know that guild vaults are a luxury and not a necessity. 
---
People have been playing vanilla for over a decade without a guild vault. Can it lead to drama? Yes. Does it happen all the time? No. Is that a problem? No. 
---
Second of all: "Classic" is not about making the game as good as it can be. The goal is to recreate the game as it was - with all its warts.
---
There isn't really a rotation as such. Besides, you don't want to level as elemental. It's an *incredibly* terrible leveling spec. You level as enhancement, and there's generally three ways to do it:
---
1) Stormstrike on cooldown, usind Windfury. SS costs a lot of mana so that's pretty much all you'll do.
---
2) Lightning Shield. Probably the most mana efficient, but also annoying unless you stress your mana by pulling with spells. Note that a surprising number of mobs are immune to nature damage.
---
3) Flameshock + Searing Totem. It's convenient because you get to pull with a ranged spell, and if mob density is good enough, each totem will cover two kills.
---
All three have roughly equal speed and mana consumption. #1 is good if you expect to do PvP while leveling, otherwise you can completely skip Stormstrike since it's extremely mana-inefficient. #2 is a bit more mana-efficient if you don't pull with a spell, but it sucks having to run up to mobs. #2 and #3 can be done with either Windfury or Flametongue.
---
I always go with #3. For one thing, it lets you go AFK for the full duration of every fight instead of having to constantly keep an eye on Lightning Shield or the Stormstrike cooldown. Just slap down a totem, pull a mob with Flameshock and alt-tab.
---
Throughout the leveling process, you can go either 2h Windfury or 1h+shield Flametongue. WF is a bit better DPS if you keep your weapon up to date. FT lets you level without ever thinking about your weapon, you can literally use a level 1 white dagger until 60. It also lets you use a shield so you take less damage.
---
Low level large shards aren't worth anything. The items they are from will almost certainly sell for more to merchant than the shards will, with maybe a couple exceptions if you wait a while.
---
Can a tank and healer do all of BFD no issues if they are 22, maybe 23? What level should the DPS be to compensate if this is too low?
---
Yes, it is almost universally regarded as very boring, and it's mostly autoattacking.
---
Just keep in mind most people that act like this can’t afford $15 a month so they probably won’t be able to afford classic.
---
Youre probably too cheap for a sub anyways, I'm happy the sub will stop you from playing classic when it comes out too. Go back to private server.
---
You did what Blizzard refused to do, thanks!
---
You would think with so much emphasis on fixing remaining issues and the visibility of changes that they would’ve released beta patch notes.
---
That was awesome thanks for recording it I’m sad I missed out but damn what fun it looked like y’all had. Great to see it, kudos to the devs for having fun at the end of it. Now we begin the long wait
---

---
“Do nothing to stop it” .... well I can’t just reach through the computer and set him straight, what ideas do you have? 
---
“Further escalate the situation” the second reply from him came in the same time I sent the first “&lt;3s”. I’m sure sending a heart isn’t escalating. If a heart gets you fired up.... you have some deep issues.
---
Also since a lot of comments suggested I was hurt by the comment I guess I should clarify. These comments didn’t hurt me, or get under my skin, or change anything in my emotional state.The post is literally a reminder that we are a gaming community and probably have a pretty high amount of young players who will take this personal. Because all it takes is someone to follow through from a text like this, then it hits the web and everyone cries about how we could have prevented it. Just don’t pass on the hate.

&gt; . 3-5G for a cooldown. And in the 25-30g range.
---
Who would sell the CD for 5g, if the 2 felcloth was only 2g, and the end product sold for 25g?
---
Sorry, there's been a miscommunication here. You'd use it like you're describing if you need to take a break between pulls. If you're chainpulling you can min/max by using it after the pull. 
---
When you use it after pulling it can generate enough threat to keep mobs off a drinking caster, which is nice.
---
Don't waste your time typing. These spoiled brats don't understand how some people go through an immense amount of stress, and cyber abuse can actually really, really bother some people.
---
Depends on the type of PvP you want to do. 
---
Are you looking to do world ganking? Rogues shine in these scenarios. They can pick fights and can easily kill any class 1v1 with cooldowns.
---
Do you want to do bg's? Mages are great in BGs, especially AV where you can just AOE choke points.

Don't waste money on AH. Loot everything to sell, even gray items. Sell valuable BoE items in trade/AH. Don't level engineering. Only learn spells/abilities which you will be actively using.

If you do these things, you should have a mount by lvl 42 at the latest.

I'd bet on poorly scripted. Warlock dps really wasn't any competitive, to the point that at naxx most guilds only brought one for curse of elements.
---
They parked warlock alts outside the istance for soulstones
---
From my understanding PVP leeway is working perfectly but PVE leeway is incorrect
---
Any thoughts on charge and demo shout?
---
Yup, change to silver after tirisfal
---
So  PVP leeway is working correctly and only  PVE leeway is incorrect?
---
Someone doesn’t engineer
---
You gonna wait and be miserable, or you gonna start a party in line?
---
It is definitely consistent and dependable, but the overlap means that both are not likely to be used in the same fight. Now say I took the charm break out of WotF and stick Stun break in there instead - how much more powerful would that be in your eyes? If your answer is significantly moreso, then roll Orc. 
---
It's not as good as Hardiness since Hardiness is passive and not a cooldown, but you get the idea.
---
I think the only thing alliance rogues hate worse than orc warriors are orc rogues. Their cheap shot gets fully resisted, they get insta-gouged and all of a sudden they are being murdered while being stunlocked themselves.
---
I will say some f-words about retail version of the game in Barrens Chat.
---
Look up the KUL keyboards
---
They group had a healer in pally/priest it said
---
In what way exactly?
---
If I rolled a horde rogue I would go orc. I think undead looks better but I wouldn't be able to resist having the stun resist. Blood Fury is decent as well.
---
That's a pretty ignorant thing to say.
---
Once you get anger management charge is fine. Demo shout for 6 or more mobs, battle shout for 5 or less
---
&gt; P.S please no play what you like better replies, I just want pvp comparisons between their racials to help decide
---
And that's relevant how, exactly? Other than being a strawman?
---
I can still see the ground. This beta event was a ghost town

Remember what it's called?
---
Thank you for replying back with your productive ideas. 
---
Again, I did not “get so upset”. You’re just adding what you want to the situation.
---
This video truly was a masterpiece.
---
When I level undead, I usually quest in Trisfal and Silverpine until 13-14 then head to barrens. Barrens questing is much faster than Silverpine imo. I would go over sooner, but I prefer to get a couple levels ahead if that makes sense.

You'll also have access to RFC and WC without much travel.

On that same note, replying to a comment on my post also isn’t considered “out of my way”, is it? I think in hindsight, you’re going more out of your way to tell me

Steelseries have some pretty professional looking stuff, also Qpad. This is from personal experience ofc, but my clients are fascinated by the sound of my mechanical keyboard. Eveyone else hates it though.
---
They shafted me alright.... by not extending my contract. Hello unemployment and Wow Classic!
---
Holy priest
---
Really? Am I?
---
This is not a troll or harass comment.  This is your friendly reminder that using your phone to take screenshots isn't welcomed.  It's never okay to not use print screen to take screenshots.  We are better than this.  When classic releases, let's all be helpful and re-live the good 'ol days!
---
You’re a softy if these comments bother you. I wouldn’t report, but if you feel that is justified then just report and move on. The more we censor, the closer we get to censoring comments that shouldn’t be censored at all (a la so called hate speech on social media these days).
---
Shedothedruid has created a spreadsheet for specifically for feral DPS, I’d go check that out if you haven’t.
---
Easy way vs hard way, you choose.
---
You right. Going on reddit isn’t out of your way. You spend majority of your time here by the looks of it. The fact you also made a child means you should probably take a break.
---
Superb guide, both in information provided and presentation.
---
Filco majestouch 2 keyboard with mx browns with a steelseries sensei raw mouse are what I use at work.  Great quality and blend in great in a business setting
---
I want to make my own leveling guide for myself to use. I will be piggy backing from other guides but I want to customize it for me to make it easier to follow. What would be the best tool to make it in? Microsoft excel, power point etc? I want to include pictures (maps of zones) and I want to draw arrows on the map, including which areas I need to grind a level or two before question in a new area.
---
Cool story, but like 95% of this has to be embellishment.
---
good call out. youre right. thank you!
---
If you’re not familiar with the communities that follow these people you can just check out their twitch chats sometime. The same behavior follows in any game they play. They encourage this behavior. Also the server population will ebb and flow with how much content the streamer thinks they can squeeze out of it. They aren’t normal players, they are entertainers that use games as their platform. They are playing for money and don’t care if they ruin others experience in the process.
---
Maybe not first, but I’ll be making a whole bunch of bank characters for different kinds of items. 
---
Bag space 😍
---
I did a lot of tanking during the beta, so some additional things to consider -
---
- One of the biggest differences between classic and retail tanking is that you are going to be limited on rage, and you probably aren’t going to filling every single GCD with an ability.  Ideally you want to use as few abilities as you can to conserve rage so you can then when you really need to
---
- understand your aggro range and what you think members of your party are going to do, charge isn’t good for every situation but you shouldn’t be afraid to use it on a pull when it makes sense, the extra rage is nice
---
- Taunt directs a target to attack you but only brings you to 100% of the threat that person had, but you need 110% to completely pull it off someone.  Taunt on a high health mob without following on with another threat ability (I.e. Sunder) is pointless.
---
- This is going to be controversial with some, but in the leveling dungeons you can get away with a lot more 2h tanking than you’d think, and it gives you a ton more rage to work with, which you’ll need in certain cases (when shamans get windfury).  If arms, you’d be surprised how well a charge -&gt; sweeping strikes -&gt; whirlwind will glue a group to you.  You can always go back to the 1 handed and shield if you start taking a lot of damage.  Largely dependent on your gear and the healing.
---
- a low health mob that switches to a Dps and is going to die soon anyway may not be worth a taunt
---
That said, this is mostly talking about the sub 60 dungeons while leveling.  Cheers.
---
So you killed the elite elementals at lvl 30 all by your self...?
---
For the sake of everyone I researched and watched the full video.
---
the name of the guild in the video is "illegal danish". They apparently have an actual danish that glows in a secret compartment in their guild tavern.  There is an impostor in their guild trying to steal the danish. 
---
So. That.
---
Then be a female orc
---
If your friend is going to raid through AQ and Naxx, priest+lock would be devastating. If your friend isn't going to raid, priest+rogue works great as rogues aren't gear dependent plus the rogue can peel for you. Druid isn't a PVP dps class, they're a support class that excels at carrying flags and slowly wearing opponents down in 1v1 encounters.
---
Beer, coffee, and nicotine seems like a healthy balanced approach for the first 2 weeks,
---
I don‘t bring my coworkers home. I bring costumers home for meetings because I got a home office. Those are people I don‘t know before and It has to look like a work place not a gaming station – I would love to have a separate place for gaming. And btw all my friends know about my hobby and some are hyped for classic 2. call it being ashamed but it‘s business. I don‘t like ties and suits but that‘s how it is and yeah..
---
Where did you get those monitor stands? I've been looking to get a 4th monitor ontop of mine and been struggling to find stands that will work for my desk.
---
These gaming keyboards people use are not something you need. My favorite keyboard is a Logitech Ultraflat. Just a normal keyboard that is very thin. Find it much more comfortable and I type quicker on it compared to normal keyboards.
---
As for a good mouse that doesn't look weird, I use an old Logitech G5 gaming mouse. Maybe they are not available anymore but should exist some newer version which is basically the same. Looks like a normal mouse with some blue pattern and one small light showing which DPI setting you are using. Mouse has 2 sidebuttons and the scrollwheel can be tilted to the left and right giving you two more buttons there. The 2 DPI buttons can be used as keybinds as well. For setting up the sidebuttons and scrollwheel I use Logitech Setpoint program.
---
You're right it's really specific.  I might have gotten some small details wrong (like on the Rogue roles etc.), but remember I was standing around for 45 minutes with the original 3 gankers. They basically how it went down at the start before I was there.
---
For the info on what was happening internally -- it was just a mix of gossip, hearing from people who were there, and info from my old guild leader.  Remember that my old guild leader had communications with the other guild leader. :)
---
He would like to play a race with the superior racials for pvp.  Why do you waste our time with your stupid comment?
---
They aren't elite. Had another warrior and a priest help with killing the eles. Took a couple hours but we got it done.
---
You can equip the pvp trinket to break fear.
---
Orc &gt; UD
---
Take my time leveling and give the raiding guilds time to form and get sorted out.
---
We've invented this thing called cabinetry that allows you to store things out of sight.
---
You’re such a weenie. This is what makes pvp memorable. You know what you do? Get on your 60 and return the favor.
---
All spirit. 
---
You can't survive without hope
---
Making it hard not rolling a warrior.  Nice write up, cheers!
---
Personally I like being called derogatory words and being encouraged to better myself so while I don't encourage those actions I would appreciate it personally. (use the ignore button, stop trying to make this a social justice issue, seek help if you feel bad).
---
just wanted to point at him
---
Well, that's the opposite of a fact. That's just bullshit. 
---
Also, this isn't vanilla retail. There have been 15 years worth of theorycrafting and testing to figure out what works best since then. Go ask one private server guild how many warlocks they use and come back to me with those "facts" of yours.
---
Why not? You're likely stomping on multiple effect pedals anyway, what is one more?
---
There's a guide in preparation on barrens.chat on the topic ;-) it's not by all means complete but is a starting point
---
Do not click any of the links in his video description
---
What class would synergise well with a warlock? A mate of mine will start a warlock on a PVE realm, what class should I make that would work well with the warlock and pve?
---
Far too clean
---
PvE unless you're 1000% certain. You can still play in organized PvP, and on PvE you can farm gold or play more lazily like streaming Netflix while grinding.
---
Sorry this is a dumb question but what is minmaxing?
---
Yeah that's how I play the game too, except using Q&amp;E instead of W&amp;R. Haven't used WASD in years, and I became a lot better when I stopped using it.
---
LaTeX
---
Paladin is an incredible addition to warlock, but in reality any class works totally fine.
---
no and no
---
Lol?
---
Tmorph I think does it. Although some people say it's against tos but I've seen streamers use it and never get banned.
---
Neither. Dun Morogh -&gt; Elwynn -&gt; Early Westfall -&gt; Early Loch -&gt; 12-17 Darkshore
---
&gt;It's not often, but sometimes in dungeons you'll need to toss on your shield and taunt the boss if the tank dies or some other silliness happens.
---
Oh, you're going to be one of *those* warriors
---
Its actually super easy. I played EVE for years, boxing is not foreign to me. 
---
Once you set up the system, which admittedly takes some time, its quite simple. 
---
Simplier than getting 4 other real people to run the instance with you? Yes.
---
Druid instancing while leveling is gonna be amazing. You are tank specced as your leveling spec, can heal just fine, with that same spec, and even DPS if needed. 
---
Just go feral - then figure out what you wanna do at max level
---
The GY is pretty close too...
---
What class are you leveling first? That will largely determine the major dungeons you *should* run.
---
That's a very time inefficient way to level. Try juggling 2-3 mobs simultaneously, it's both faster and more exciting.
---
This is basically the absolute good, reliable, standard Druid leveling build. It won’t be super great for healing dungeons or raids but you’ll be able to take good care of yourself and others for the most part.
---
Basement of ravenholdt manor, engineering recipe. I forget what it is. Jumper cables?
---
&gt;So they ~~will~~ accept meme specs who goes the extra distance
---
may
---
The more 'clack' the more deeps, common knowledge
---
You will absolutely be able to find a raiding spot in *some* guild's roster. You may have to go the extra mile, and get used to being sat for certain progression if your guild is struggling. Only the most hardcore or elitist guilds will have a big enough/picky enough roster to avoid hunters fiercely. Besides, they are quite handy in T1/2 raiding.
---
Can they learn all other abilities from other pets in the stables, or is it certain types? Like, can my cat learn from crocs, birds, spiders, etc., or is it just a select few?
---
sounds like a plan someone had 80 years ago
---
Your post wasn’t high quality either. This one should also be deleted. It’s literally just a ShittyWatercolors post from two days ago that this dude slapped an orc face on.
---
Crisp spider meat, tough condor meat and great goretusk snouts for the redridge goulash quest, sell them on the AH in stacks of 5, most people cant be bothered grinding them out so they sell quite well
---
Go to specs for warlock pvp are Sm/Ruin and Destro, SL is bad for organized pvp and is only good for wpvp since your damage and burst are so low and anyone can run away from you, you cannot force fights or burst people down like other classes and specs. If you want to pvp and pvp use Sm/Ruin spec and save yourself gold on weekly respects
---
I know I wouldn't play Classic at least for first year due to personal reasons, but I'm super interested in what it will be for you all guys
---
Some people say players are more experienced than in actual vanilla so it'll be a lot easier to rush through classic content
---
I hope they are wrong
---
I have duo’d with a priest both on beta and on pservers and I can say without a doubt vw is king. You can also juggle a ton of mobs on beta since most mobs weren’t hitting us nearly as hard as on pservers and since you have an added player who can deal damage, you need to deal less damage and therefore cause less threat so the mobs that your vw are tanking won’t ever pull off of him.
---
It really depends, some groups you almost have to judge righteous just for innitial threat. But wisdom is the ideal. You are better off tanking in a caster group compared to a melee group. You have solid aoe threat, so youd fit in better with big pulls and short drink breaks. Immolation oils are also insane if you can get your hands on them.
---
&gt;The entrance, inner mountain, and instance portal were all camped by Horde.  The instance portals were always the most heavily camped areas because that's where they knew all of the traffic would be (including summoning portals).
---
Except the whole raid could have zoned out and summoned him...
---
&gt; Gm island will be removed in Classic 
---
What makes you so sure?
---
Sry to try and correct you again: we won.
---
I do that. Keeping several bank chars will make it much easier to keep track of what goes where.
---
Druid can also output more threat than warriors.  For a warrior to keep up with a feral tank, they have to swap from mitigation to threat gear, which lowers their mitigation/avoidance way below what a bear will have in threat gear.
---
Bears are easier to heal for almost anything except bleeding edge progression while undergeared.
---
To be fair, that's like Boralus in BFA
---
He sells the pattern for jumper cables. But other vendors sell it too.
---
You should probably consider rolling on a different continent.
---
AD quartermaster only comes in Phase 6.
---
Lol, this is been going on for decades and will never stop, it's the internet ffs. Stop being a snowflake, ignore and move on. Lel
---
You'll find more odd ducklings, but yeah if you look you'll find.
---
Because the enemy is still breathing.
---
Legit thinking of seeing if I can find one with a single pedal, just for discord/voice chat push to talk. I use so many KB buttons and modifiers that voice chat is the only thing I find myself needing a separate activator for.
---
You really need to chill out, you're toxic AF.  You're gonna be the one who can't get in groups after 3/4 of your server blacklists you for being a raging asshole.
---
Ive cleared the vanilla content on pservers and im just here to tank a dungeon or farm some herbs :) i kinda enjoy stuff like that
---
cant wait to get my hands on wow classic!
---
I thought this was Azeroth!
---
Horse shit.  This story is pure fiction.
---
Had a rl friend that had a schedule like this, I believe he ended up playing mostly with New Zealanders and Aussies.
---
Basically this, feral in low level dungeons is really op for a tank
---
That too. Doesn’t bother me that much tho tbh. I mostly don’t want to regret my decision later on. 
---
Hunter by all means is good, decent. But it’s not on a Warrior level. I mean the iconic weapons, Ashkandi, Arcanite Reaper (hoooo) etc.
---
And PvE servers. Us carebears are lucky. Absolutely zero of the LARGE streamers that are big enough to cause an actual problem will roll PvE.
---
None.
---
0/31/5 and then you can either go further into Resto (that's your Phase 1 raid heal and PvP spec, except you will probably switch Leader of the Pack for NS @ 60) or go more points into Balance for a bit better solo with Omen of Clarity.
---
Keep Int gear around if you want to heal dungeons, but that spec can do any role well.
---
&gt;What a bunch of idiots.
---
Or wait for it... It's fiction.
---
Okay thanks for the info. Really like having another option though. Always used to get bored just leveling with VW. May do a bit of both.
---
**Formal Dangui** sold by [Geenia Sunshadow](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=4184) in Moonglade, pretty rare dress.

So you would tell Usain Bolt that you dont care about how fast he runs, since you walk 100m all day &amp; your Friend works in a Bakery so he does stuff even faster? Your comment seems pretty relevant. :)

Everyone has fun in his / her own way, if you can not share it, you do not always have to say something about it! (:

The Logitech G600 is very plain looking. 
---
It has the 12 thumb buttons for a great MMO experience.
---
However there are different way to map these 12 buttons on different presets, therefore it's also very convient to map it with macros to open various Microsoft Office applications etc.
---
So it can be used as both an MMO mouse as well as office work mouse.

Min Max in his true meaning is minimizing the weakness/flaws of something and maxing the strenghts/value. Can be used in a lot of situations, it is most known in the world of business.
---
Why do you care? I tought it was interesting as a fellow glitcher
---
You just saved my life
---
Im trying to copy my addons and keybinds from the beta to the live download area... So the first thing? Checking to see if my settings and profiles/addons/keybinds are right.
---
Its always crazy having to unbind rotate left/right and turn on the autoloot and instant quest text stuff first.
---
&gt; don’t care if they ruin others experience in the process.
---
so, like any PvPer ever?
---
Oh wowie glad your wifes boyfriend got you the manuals, oooo I love it!!! So excited for classic wow and clearing Ragnaros as level 45
---
I was engineer/miner on my shadow priest in vanilla.  I had way more time to play and spent lots of time in PvP and still managed to raid 4 nights a week.
---
I quit 3 weeks into tbc.  Was a good time for me to just walk away.
---
This time around in vanilla I'm playing a warlock.  Very casual.  An hour here, an hour there in between family commitments running wow on shadow.
---
Going herbalist/alchemist.  I can see myself just pottering about demonology speced letting Mr felguard do the heavy lifting while I respond to family commitments and tab target my way though enemy's dotting everything.
---
Haha bro sick ex wife perfect timing. Now u wont have wife aggro bro gonna be epic gaming classic alone shitting and pissing in bottles. Bro i think i may not even shower for a whole 3 days haha gonna be 7 7 lit

If someone makes an addon that automatically translates twitch chat memes to 2004/5 memes, I'd download that in a fucking heartbeat.

And call them the fuck out we did.

That story is AT BEST based on a true story.   You know, sort of like how the Titanic was based on a true story, and about the only true thing that happened was the boat sank.
---
Pure fiction
---
hunter is def more "class fantasy"-ish for exploring the world, getting pets, soloing instances etc.
---

haha the ex wifey can get fucked for all I care!!!! Might call up work and quit while I'm at it 😂😂😂😂
---
As I said, I prefer healing in pve and even sometimes in pvp, so that's not really a negative.  On the flipside, warlock has sm ruin which, while not SL-OP in pvp, it's still plenty strong (while also being a strong pve spec, just slightly behind DS... so you can be the imp buff warlock).
---
SL seems honestly a bit too braindead anyway.
---
It was op to me because they would always conveniently have it every single fight against me. :(
---
Not sure a rebuttle is caring.

Your best best is going to be finding an Oceania guild.

yAaah bro fucking siiick dude. My wife was fucking nagging me on about playing on the computer too much so she left me and took the kids LOLLOLOLOL. Uberpwned. Anyway idk, I think shes with her coworker Tyris now, but atleast I got the house to myself and can game classic all day. SICK!!
---
Beautiful
---
&gt; In defense of pserver players, they are the reason, you get to play classic wow you unthankful retail crybaby.
---
I am supposed to thank you for playing a pirated version of the game?   ROFL!     Maybe you meant I should thank the people that stole Blizzard's intellectual property?     Either way, it's quite laughable.
---
I'm in the same situation as you, OP. I practice out of my home so I decided to go with Steelseries everything. You can disable the LED's in the settings or you can choose to run a generic colour like red.
---
this EXACTLY. Play whatever you want but don't be surprised when someone decides to invite a rogue over your ret paladin (and don't be mad about it either).
---
I would also add--
---
Humanoid mobs run away from you when they get low hp, so if you tank the mobs such that their backs are facing your party, when they run away they don't pull the whole damn instance but instead run into the empty area you just cleared. It also helps to pull the mobs out of rooms and to a more safer area. 
---
This will save you from some wipes when running any dungeons with humanoids in, but particularly ones in tightly packed areas/rooms such as SM, BRD, LBRS.
---
Would like something like that too. Was using FuBar\_MoneyFu on WotLK and it did a great job, counting +/- daily, weekly and monthly.
---
Why would you clean the xwife's garage?
---
yeah bro like my room is gonna look like that one south park episode haha 😂😂😂😂 gonna write my letter to the wifey
---
#metoo?
---
I wanna stay on us
---
I will be alright with the remaining 1/4. We will make an asshole guild. No meme specs tho!
---
Breakdancing is better than eating your enemy's corpse.
---
Because I wanted to see if I could find my manuals since I need them for classic
---
Wireless mice sucked a decade ago, they're good now. I don't use one, but given the choice between something wired and built for business or something wireless and built for gaming, I'd go with the latter every time.
---
From a vid I just watched it seems that flare does not instantly reveal players in stealth upon cast. (Seems it reveals upon landing)
---
Nope.
---
My lycosa bit the dust years ago lol. Got a cooler master stealth now. And I love it.
---
Meh, I'll just stick to my plan of sending in VW and wanding. I'm only training spells that I'll be using in my PvE raid rotation to save all possible gold for mount + training (I'll be getting the raptor mount on orc). In other words, I won't be training any dots.
---
That just creates a cycle of cancer.
---
What are you trying to prove posting this image? We've had enough of those already so please stop. We don't care about your box with a hot night elf character on it. A lot of us here played vanilla so you are nothing special. You are probably a private server player who thinks hes above everyone else guess what you are not. We dad gaymers are gonna rise up and show you how its properly done once we hit lvl 60 after 9 months. Cope.
---
I would say herb/alch. I think being able to make health potions is a huge advantage for non-healing classes. Plus utility stuff like rage potions, free action potions, and swiftness potions.
---
Also I think herb/alch provides more money-making opportunities if you’re willing to do a bit of grinding.
---
But then again the extra damage, stuns, and other fun/utility stuff from engineering is good too.
---
Here i was hoping, thx dude.
---
I think streamers playing on pvp servers will have a very large target on their head should they play PvP servers. For every brainlet fanboy they have, they will have annoyed regular player who will likely want them dead or camped for the lulz. 
---
I don't plan on playing PvE serevrs, so for me the problem will sort itself out
---
sorry but youre just plain wrong. one 30 second look at parses will show that.
---
Oh, it would be on the pedal for vanilla for the same reason hearthstone is. It saves you your repair bill, and when you’re pushing progression plate is not cheap. It’s more of a meme thing. So yeah, it fits the pedal for the same reasons.
---
Or, or ooor you go for both in one mouse?   
---
Pretty much all Logitech mice are understatement and perfectly build for gaming *and* business.
---
You don't need a Razer Naga to play videos games, did you know that?
---
Not me, but pserver community. You can call it pirated version, but you can as well call it the good version of the game. Retail sadly, is very boring. And one more time yes, without them pirating the game, there would be no classic wow
---
Looks like lake town from the hobbit.
---
I can see that.
---
Druid works best, just use roots and WL dots, VW for range mobs you should be able to kill a mob every 6 sec.
---
It looks about left.
---
Grid and mouseovers = winnar.
---
A good combat sword build will probably be better in the end, but a good pve dagger build isn't too far behind. It's sorta a personal choice, just be willing to have a pve and a pvp spec. Otherwise enjoy
---
Hey, I want to create my own custom ui, how did you turn your files into .blp files?
---
On the other hand arcanite cd it's 24 hours compared to mooncloth 4 days
---
Simple web page would probably be the best, if you have no experience with that microsoft word or similar would also work.
---
Don't forget to log into the toons, even if briefly.  Blue bar doesn't start until after the first log in  =)
---
have fun in pretend land
---
Clique is better than nothing, but mouseover macros are best
---
You should probably go to the doctor then. Genital warts aren't curable, but they can at least remove that fucking thing.
---
He borrowed 4,000 from me... I feel like I have priority here on the payback timeline
---
Maybe I'll post in the retail sub, but that shit doesn't exist in classic.  ;)
---
Find yourself a resto shaman who also cant respec to elemental and rock that fury warrior spec.
---
Dont have the funds? Do the best you can.
---
Better to start viewing respecs the same as flasks in PvP.  
---
Would you flask for 2hour fun? No? Then why would you respec when you do fine (not optimal) in your PvE spec?
---
Skinning/mining is ideal so that you can sell the skins for money and send the ore to a bank alt for you to use on engineering at 60.
---
What’s blue bar?
---
Darkmoon Faire mats.
---
Lol I didn’t say that, I said they enabled the option for it. Don’t like it don’t play on a PVP server.
---
Orc &gt; everything for pvp

You're the one pretending kid.

Win+Shift+S *is* the new snipping tool.
---
You'll still DR your freezing trap (and your sleeps, and your rocket helm.....) by using scatter to interrupt. And good hunters didn't have to deal with unresponsive FD, batched trap that take ages to trigger... Trapping someone without scatter is gonna be more difficult than it was.
---
I've always been pretty adamant about herb/tailor. I love these professions for many reasons, but mainly because they are about fiddling with chemicals and I'm studying to become a chemist so it resonates a lot with my irl interests. 
---
That being said, I most recently picked up engineering on a private server and once you try it you can't play without it. You get so many new abilities that just completely revamp your class.
---
haha holy hell I actually remember that guild! you were the only LGBT only guild on the server
---
Well even if a target already had battle shout it would still be buffing them, since they get a new refreshed battle shout
---
Welp looks like I learnt something today.
---
I did a similar thing on my original warrior - herb/arch for his own heal pots, and kept up with cooking and first aid to reduce out of combat down time. I understand it isn’t the most efficient, but I get enjoyment out of making the things myself. 
---
This time around it’ll be spread around the alts a bit though. Priest for herb/alch, while the warrior main does BS/mining and makes armor. 
---
I know what you mean about the survivalist bit. I started doing that on a hunter alt back in vanilla/BC. It was kind of fun. He was an engineer, to make his own ammo. Did all the secondary profs, both to feed himself and his pet. I would explore every nook and cranny with him, do every quest I could find. So much fun.
---
I can’t wait to get back to it all.
---
Spirit BiS even for warris
---
Or you just don’t know what you’re talking about
---
This did not happen Horde-side to my knowledge. I was there until the last moment. RIP server.
---
I like to think the OP wrote that comment while staring lovingly at himself in the mirror
---
Prot paladin is the best tank for grinding dungeons with casters. If he plans on mostly doing dungeons to level going straight for consecration and then full prot would be a good idea.
---
I won't be taking any professions until level 60. All my characters will have Engineering and then one of the crafting professions depending on class with Alchemy being a priority.

goodnight, sweetie.
---
Ah, I see you're a man of culture as well
---
You’re kinda being a jerk to this dude for no reason at all
---
Can Rumsey Rum Black Label be consumed by a lvl 1 or is there a lvl req? Can’t seem to find any info on it
---
Whichever raid frames you like most + mouseover macros.
---
Everyone dies eventually...but he'll forever live in our hearts. &lt;3
---
Plus your stories are better.
---
If you are leveling with a hunter, pretty much anything is viable. 
---
Mages have a lot of good AoE farms at 60. Warlocks can do most of them as well, but a little slower. Warlocks can also do princess and several DM runs. They're pretty similar at 60 solo, but mages can make a lot more money selling portals than locks can make summoning.
---
Level 40 is good to pick her up. Felsteed quest -&gt; Ride to the tent &amp; pick quest -&gt; ride back to Ratchet -&gt; Fly to Ashenvale (requires Theramore's FP to connect) -&gt; Do the quest and fly back to Ratchet. I recently tried to do it at 26 and it was really inefficient time-wise. It will be rough on release too to run through the Barrens while barely being higher level than the people there.
---
Just add cancelaura to the spells that require you to leave shadowform first?
---
This upcoming stress test, I'm just going to set up my UI and get everything configured all nice-nice, since I've already done everything I wanted to do in the stress test before. (level to 15 and tank / heal a dungeon)
---
Until the moment you discover your server is being used as the unofficial Romanian/French/Dutch/Italian/whatever server and you can't play endgame cause you don't speak their language
---
White Magicforce keyboards look like straight out of a dental clinic, but are flawless for gaming.
---
its not actually, although tbf i'm not even planning on much pvp.  my spec sacrifices a little PvP utility
---
Googled classic+tablet, ended up here. Now several months later, did you learn anything? Ill be working in a fashion for a while where ill have alot of on and off downtime all day, i can toss up a tablet in between but a laptop would both be impractical and frowned upon, ill have to rest it in my lap or hands😅.
---
Would love if i could install classic on a tablet and pit a datatwin sim in my tablet and play where ever i roam. I dont care if fps is only lile 20+, and latency from 4g network laggs as all ill do is level up autohitting mobs to drastically shorten my realtime spent 1&gt;60.
---
#nochange.
---
If you cant handle the world pvp, go pve server.
---
That damn Mountain Dew look..
---
You can aoe grind as prot eventually tho and it is amazing. Later levels like 45+ become pretty fun but ya early on there’s nothing that really improves your kills like seal of command &amp; even the AP boost from BOM. 
---
I always say level Ret then once you have light + reckoning then you can start pulling heavier packs.
---
Has any classic version of a game come out and stayed completely the same over the years? Private servers existed but those were shutdown if they got to popular and were free.
---
 2007scape is vastly different from how it was in 2007 and afaik most people agree that if the game stayed how it was it would of died.
---
If they do release the other expansions I doubt it'll be optional as they wont want to keep splitting the playerbase. I see them going as classic means no cross realm/dungeon finder route if they choose to do BC/WotLK.
---
They will disable it before any world bosses will be implemented.
---
The first world bosses to be released will be Azuregos and Lord Kazzak (both in P2). The devs said multiple times that they will remove layering some time before P2 and even cited the world bosses as reason why it absolutely has to be gone by then.
---
Weird. When I right click it off it doesn’t trigger any GCD so you’d think /cancelaura would have the same effect but I’ll have to test it thanks
---
obviously leaving up classic realms while moving to bc &gt; wotlk &gt; cata &gt; mop &gt; wod &gt; legion is pog
---
yes I see, that seems appropriate.
---
I guess that should work. Thanks!
---
arcanite is 48 hours https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=17187/transmute-arcanite

Did not know this about shadow thanks for sharing
---
Arcanite is 2 days not 1 day. https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=17187/transmute-arcanite
---
Haha okay so all my assumptions were wrong :D thanks a lot!
---
That’s what I’m doing too. From what I’ve heard, it’s pretty cheap to level up engineering, which makes the decision easier
---
What class has the best lvl 13-14 PvP rewards?   
---
Who has better PvE rewards for PvP?
---
I'm not saying streamers don't ruin fun. It's just that sentence was funny to me as wow is absolutely full of people who don't care if they ruin others' experience.
---
My favorite expansion is TBC, so I hope that is released. I think we all know it should be separate from Vanilla. My main concern with TBC is preserving difficulty. In Vanilla the “no changes” mantra dominated all conversation in a way that I thought less preserved authenticity, (1.12 talents and items and 16 debuffs, etc. met people’s criteria of no changes, while I feel this being the state during MC makes content too easy).
---
Many of us think TBC had some of the greatest raids/dungeons in offering us appropriate difficulty. By the end of the expansion, things were nerfed to the ground, which made sense because a new expansion was coming out, and it gave people a chance to experience a little more content first.
---
The WoW: classics are a different situation. If anything, difficulty/attunements/etc. helps things last longer, which seems like strictly a plus when no new content is coming out for a given iteration of the game. AND we already will have more knowledge of the game, people coming back to play the infamous BC expansion are already going to be above average players, etc. I’m not saying I expect the content to be buffed because of this, but at the very least we should be getting the more difficult versions of raids and dungeons, maybe with talents progressing organically over the course of the expansion. I know in some instances the very first version of a raid or dungeon might not work if it had bugs or was unbeatable.
---
Frankly, I think it was a mistake not to worry about how nerfed early Vanilla raids are going to be. As BC was known for arguably the best era of dungeon/raid difficulty, and people would already have their retail and Vanilla versions of the game, with more casual raiding opportunities, and we might have more data backed up, I at the very least do not want a nerfed BC!
---
Hard raids, hard heroic dungeons, keep 
---
I hope this community will pay attention to how nerfed MC feels and will agree to argue these points with me when they time comes for the likely BC expansion.
---
&gt; Humanoid mobs run away from you when they get low hp, so if you tank the mobs such that their backs are facing your party, when they run away they don't pull the whole damn instance but instead run into the empty area you just cleared. It also helps to pull the mobs out of rooms and to a more safer area.
---
I'm not 100% sure, but I believe this confirmed as a pserver feature. Humanoids in classic runs in random directions.
---
The problem is that pvp rewards can outpace raid gear so this is fine
---
Most players aren't even going to be level 60 before the Honor System or Battlegrounds come out. It's not Blizzard's responsibility to give you more content early just because you can't exercise self control.
---
&gt; Wyrmhide Spaulders
---
I have never seen this mentioned and you are totally correct.
---
This is a change....
---
There needs to be some classic servers always available because there will always be demand for them. 
---
Otherwise the private servers just come back.
---
Character copy to a TBC server would be ideal. Have TBC progress through the patches. Then same thing with WOTLK.
---
This would leave a trail of characters spread over several expansions worth of servers but I don't think that's a bad thing. 
---
They may have to merge servers later on, but that's also not necessarily a bad thing either. Realm merges on retail worked well. It was phasing that ruined the community feel.
---
I levelled a mage last year on a private server and tried fire out. It’s rough. The damage is great but the downtime is too much. You drink after every 2 kills. 
---
Single target frost spec is much better all around for levelling, and technically AoE frost is better than that.
---
Except now the Pvp rewards will be bis raid gear.
---
Literally [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cah4go/i_feel_like_wow_classic_is_saving_my_life/) guy.
---
At least 5 people with tmorph.
---
i'll look into those! tysm
---
You’re not going to change it now. Ranking pre-BG is going to be pretty tough, but if you avoid hotspots I’m sure you’ll be fine.
---
Suck it the fuck up, buttercup
---
Also: I’m drunk
---
Avoid west fall on any character. It’s terrible
---
I am with you except of arena (just to be able to do it... the gear isn’t necessary to me).
---
Haha I have this exact foot switch.  
---
Bought it for my chronic hand problems, but it didn't help me much :(
---
No, this was early 2006.
---
That just makes it worse, because then they're easier kills for honor.
---
Did we learn from the Beta whether the Horde Hinterlands village was in and what state Light's Hope Chapel and Silithus were in?
---
Huh?  The patches aren't set in stone.   It would take no effort to move things around a bit.
---
No it is not. This is actually entirely blizzlike.
---
Incorrect. The honor system entered the game before BGs did. The honor system entered the game after launch.
---
So no honor system in phase 2? After all DM and honour where not released the same time.
---
Oh no wait phases aren't vanilla like and release honor and bgs at the same time wouldn't be any more or less vanilla like than the current phasing.
---
I have often wondered what an original Vanilla Hyjal, Karazhan, Emerald Dream, Dragon Isles, Azshara Crater ect would have been like 14+ years ago, that ship has long sailed. I simply do not have the confidence that Activision Blizzard in it's current state and their recent history across all their games will do justice to these areas. Do you?
---
Let them remain in the past as "what could have been". New content is there in BFA if that's what you want.
---
As for post-Vanilla servers, that's a tough one, there is definitely a market for TBC and WoTLK. 
---
TBC can absolutely work. Some would argue that in gameplay terms, it was the best state WoW has ever been in (although I personall hated the space theme and Blood Elves).
---
WoTLK is kind of iffy. When the final phase has come, all raids pre-ICC will be completely obsolete as the progression path becomes Level 80 &gt; Heroics &gt; ICC. Unlike in Vanilla and TBC where people will still be raiding MC and Karazhan years after the guilds have been farming Naxxramas and Sunwell.
---
I think they are also worried about spreading the playerbase too thin. Classic is already quite ambitious and I'm sure Blizzard have their concerns with it, but at what point do they stop releasing expansion servers? Let's be honest, nobody wants to play a Cataclysm server. But if they drew the line there and stopped releasing servers, that's essentially admitting that WoW post- Cataclysm is in a poor state. Which we of course know, but I can't see Blizzard admitting to that.
---
What is my rotation as combat daggers? Is it true I shouldn't use evis? Only basically snd and backstabbing
---
PvE server is that way. --&gt;
---
Logitech’s new mx518 mouse and a poker3 keyboard. Couldn’t ask for a better setup.
---
Not really. You won't get any Honor for killing grey opponents and your Honor for corpse camping green opponents is basically nothing.
---
Hey an actual good meme.
---
&gt;It would be cool if they had TBC servers that you could copy your vanilla character to, but keep separate from classic
---
This will never happen. Either Classic TBC happens or it doesn't happen. There will not be three different WoW games.
---
Update. In a surprise twost I thought I wasn't being fair and tried classes I actually never played in 1.X and 2.X..
---
I kinda love hunters. Absolutely left field. I know..
---
Add level 60 class quests that reward a choice of relics/totems/librams/shields that makes a meme spec relevant.
---
For instance, a relic for balance druids that increases their spell hit chance by 5% in moonkin form and returns 100 Mana every Starfire crit.
---
The key is to do it without affecting the PvP meta.
---
Holllyyy shiiittt i remember this place! Random guy came up to me and offered to take me somewhere crazy, i said sure and here we were! Dont even remember how we got there but swimming was definitely involved. Also saw an orc sitting there AFK which was cool, i imagined it was a GM. 
---
I hope they keep this in the game.
---
Totally disagree with this - healers please don’t let your tanks dip so low that your max rank heal has no risk of overhealing; I’ll burn defensive CDs unnecessarily because I assume you’re not paying attention or are just a bad healer. I may even burn stuns/cc of my own just to shift out of bear to heal myself.
---
When healing, I use both my max rank and a lower rank heal, generally one with a shorter cast time (as healing touch gets to be a damn slow cast as it ranks up).
---
Here's the data
---
Time | Walk | Run | Enchant Boots - Minor Speed | Blink | Aspect of the Cheetah | Aspect of the Cheetah – Imp1 | Aspect of the Cheetah – Imp2 | Travel Form | Ghost Wolf | Ghost Wolf – Imp1 | Ghost Wolf – Imp2 | Nifty Stopwatch | Skull of Impending Doom | Rare Mount | Epic Mount

Sure, if you have clever traps that would be around 900 dmg from immolation trap on top of the wyvern dot, it’s not bad but not crazy either. And spending time in mêlée without deterrence is risky. 
---
Thing is, the CC won’t be that good since it will DR with your freezing trap and your goblin rocket helmet. And in a lot of situation you want to immediatly overwrite the dot with Scorpid sting so your target can still be cc’d by someone else.

Mage - great single and aoe dps, good CC, and most importantly the group utility of food and water to keep pulling, and portals to go to the city to train spells, buy gear, then hearth back to your leveling area.

I would never not have a mage in a premade group.

Anything is anything

Can confirm, was a raiding warrior, hunter got Ashkandi over me.
---
For the 8 set bonus of hunter T2, basically how good is it and how long is it worth still wearing for the bonus even if you’re getting naxx gear? Will it bump off other debuffs on a boss?
---
so, from what i remember, cc was am much bigger thing back then, and massive pulls were rare

Step two: leave your wife and kids cause naxx won't clear itself.

Step three: sell your house and live in a cybercafé for the rest of your life.

I rerolled faction after like 2-3 months on a pserver, when i dinged 60 i immediately joined the 3rd best guild on the faction(and with pserver tryhard guilds that is a pretty damn good guild). Honestly I could've joined Apes(best pserver guild in most eyes) too but someone else yoinked the spot before me. Basically goes to show that being first isn't really that big a deal, if you are good then people will want you. As for alts once you are at the status of raid logging where you have decent gold, you have all the prebis gear, you really don't need to play the game more than like 10hours a week, that is the time where most people level an alt. Alts are nice for farming gold and doing alt runs with the guild, quite fun. And having alts is quite useful for the guild, say you have a weird raid and severely lacking healers, one of the dps can log their healer alt and do just fine, and then raid the alt raid on the main later. I think i've had a 60 raiding alt on almost all the pserver i have truly played on.
---
Thanks?
---
wtf?? #nochanges game is now ruined
---
Hell yeah good to see a bear tank rep, I’ll be right there in the near future
---
mass buffs ... i dont remember if it was in vanilla or not
---
I hope they leave the level cap but maybe add the TBC talent trees just to have a lot of varied specs. And add in arcane and nature resistance instances before then using combinations. It would also be neat to see a holy resistance instance as well.
---
Realistically they're probably going to just milk classic and release Season servers, every few months after naxx comes out they launch some new classic servers and older servers are merged down as their populations dwindle. This would have people pushing for world firsts on each server season and blizzard would have to do nothing for this to happen. - this way they milk classic servers truly until no one wants to keep playing on them.
---
If they do a level squish on retail and bring back talent trees and cause portals and flying to be unreliable (weekly resets for random portals each week). Then fix lfr and loot slot machine that is titan forging. Then there isn't any need to do a classic+ patch because we will almost have one.
---
They someone else will still need the pattern.
---
I think it will not be so common until late into release, until then unforgiven mask it is
---
Would you be interested in content based on existing Kalimdor/Eastern Kingdom zones (Hyjal, Caverns of Time, etc)?
---
Would you be interested in new content that doesn't raise the level cap and/or doesn't increase stats on gear, therefore just being new content for the sake of having new zones/dungeons/quests to explore with minimal stat advancement?
---
=================
---
Yes.  I'm in favor of horizontal content.  I DO NOT WANT power creep.
---
It's Loi's raid, my raid, and lolskaters raid fresh from Hillsbrad. There are 120 people in the valley of heroes here I maybe just didn't catch them all in frame.

Just buy normal equipment. Same thing, just cheaper and less flashy.
---
Yep. Phase two is going to be a nightmare if you are 48-59. I'll be trying to rank for some of the early items, the blue caster 2 price for example. 
---
My friends and I are just going to camp random people a few times till the honor isn't worth it. I don't WANT to do it, but that's the system that will exist.
---
Most racecar bed looking gear you can disable the LEDs entirely which helps immensely
---
Thanks man, I had missed this -- installing right away!
---
That could be problematic though. I seem to recall a few spots in Outland which were basically floating islands with quest mobs, quest items and/or gathering nodes. So you dismount at an island like that just to kill a few mobs, or pick up an item and then you gotta HS?  
---
One that comes to mind is in that zone where Black Temple is. It was somewhere in the southeast and I think there was a quest for a mount speed trinket there.  
---
I guess the most affected quests could always be reworked though.. and neutral flight masters added at a critical location or two.
---
hey np!  i just learned of it myself too.  hope you have great time playing with the wife.  best of luck!
---
Lol some of the caster items at lower ranks are amazing. Tons of them are good filler items for every class too. You aren't going to just walk into a raid and get everything you need. 
---
You don't need R14 to get some pretty choice items from PvP. Especially during that phase.
---
you don't need to "put up" a common knowledge, lmao, it's not his fault you are ignorant, and it's not mine or OP's job to correct it
---
Classic launches at 9 a.m. where I live, I can't imagine if it launched after work+school hours. Jesus
---
The only thing that's common knowledge is that Hunters are the worst pure-DPS class in the game.
---
I'm all for TBC and maybe WotLK, but I don't want to see new content. It would cheapen the experience and I don't even think it would be well received. Imagine if Peter Jackson's LotR films had added a fourth movie that he came up with himself. Or just look at how near-universally hated those parts of his Hobbit films are.
---
The base game is plenty on its own. Its staying power has been proven again and again over the course of years of private servers. New content simply isn't needed, just fresh servers every so often. Once Nost brought an age of vanilla servers with sufficient quality and population, people were satisfied with resets.
---
There are some pretty big issues with the idea of post-Naxx content. For one thing, anyone who has actually played vanilla at that late stage knows that the game turns to absolute shit due to insane power creep. Mages with 900 spell power, warriors with Might of Menethil, etc. Adding more on top would just make that even worse.
---
Furthermore, if we start adding new raid tiers after Naxx, we'll be talking about a vanilla timeline spanning years. I don't know about you but I don't really want to be playing the same character for two or three years, and I certainly wouldn't like to try to reroll at that point in time. It's bad enough trying to switch mains during AQ. Most people don't. If they get tired of what they've got that late into vanilla, they quit and wait for a new server. Can you imagine trying to reroll and catch up two or three tiers after Naxx?
---
Tacking new content onto the end of vanilla is just not appealing. I want to play vanilla WoW, not what vanilla WoW would have looked like if it had stuck around for five years without an expansion. The mechanics already start to fall apart after AQ.

Most people are just afraid of the 48-59 complete and utter camp fest. I'll be leveling early and camping that level range, not because I want to but because I will have to. If they call lvl 60 it's even better. You actually WANT to camp people till they start complaining in the chats channels.

What is the threat modifier on berserker stance? 1.0?
---
You will still get at least half way there before phas3 3, and then be on a good path to having BIS weapons, and probably a few other items.
---
Takes many weeks from my experience. I only made it to 11.
---
Picking human and then reverse running from Elwynn to Teldresil. Grinding that Darnassus rep before I'm out of range so I can get a tiger mount at 40.
---
Which is more like classic, a vanilla pserver or retail?
---
I don’t think they’ll expand on Classic, and if they do it’ll be just BC.
---
After releasing Classic, they have two - three years to change Retail to possibly capture the players who returned to Classic, but have no interest in Retail.
---
You’ll see changes in expansions like, condensing levels, 40 man raids, return of PvP emphasis, etc. to try to capture the Classic people back to Retail. However, they might be too far gone because I don’t care about Pandas and the other 50 races they added.
---
Or my other theory is that they have a WoW2 or SC MMO in the works and want to grab the attention of the Vanilla players via Classic.
---
Uhhh what? Lava packs are a big part of why you neex resistance

---
When you speak 3+ languages you don't mind practicing the world's lingua franca.
---
I would be interested in all new content following Naxx... but I worry about how well Blizzard would be able to stick to the Classic style.  Making new stuff is very different from remaking Vanilla, and I worry that any new stuff could either be subpar or move away from why we're coming back to Classic in the first place.  If it's done right though, it would be the best option by far.
---
I don't particularly want TBC Classic.  I loved it at the time, and might even go back to see it again if it does happen, but I'd rather go an all new route that never introduces flying, tokens, dailies, etc.  New timeline would be ideal.
---
Don't care if it's just the original continents or moves beyond it, but it should at least start by filling in those gaps in them.
---
Staying at 60 is probably best- I might be okay with a level cap raise if there isn't such a massive power spike this time around (especially when it comes to equipment), but it'd be very difficult to get it right and would drive a lot of players away regardless.
---
How is there not an option to buy it all in wow?
---
Reserve names?
---
If they were to re-release TBC, i would hope that they would avoid the mistakes they made last time.
---
For example: Flying mounts were a mistake. Players asked for them for ages, and what blizzard should have done is say 'you don't want flying mounts. You think you do, but you don't.' And they would have been correct.
---
What else. Welfare epics, those were a bad idea. Daily quests, terrible. 'Balancing' classes and homogenising gear, bind on pickup items from professions, i could go on...
---
&gt; Beta comes and prove that private servers were much harder.
---
Okay, I'll let you humiliate yourself.
---
What exactly do you think the beta proved about real vanilla raid encounters and their difficulty?
---
Of all the words, scuffed is the cringiest to come along.
---
Take all of my clothes off of my little plumpy gnome and dance
---
That’s a good point. Perhaps portals could be put in these locations or like you said a few more flight masters.
---
How do you cause flying to be unreliable without removing it? How do you fix lfr?... make the gear not as useful? No matter what blizz does they are fucked, they've dug themselves into a hole with no ladder out without starting a new hole and pissing off their current crabs dug in with them
---
I originally mained hunter and went with the standard skinning and leatherworking. This time I'll be playing a Warlock and want to tinker around with Engineering. Partially for the PvP assistance and partially for the random "for fun" toys.
---
I swear by vuhdo.  Very easy to set up with lots of advanced features if you decide you want more.
---
I think I used healbot and some mod that listed people with a dot that i had to dispel in some MC fight.
---
How exactly is that a stretch? They said Classic was never going to happen. Now it is.
---
Unless they're dumbasses.
---
I have forgotten so much about the vanilla honor system. I remember I desperately tried to get the alliance plate shoulders and wanted the big 2 handed honor sword. The sword I learned quickly that I would never get and I could not get the tank for the shoulders. Will it be the same system now ?
---
&gt; **Oh, I'm sorry** 
---
Sorry for what?
---
I like wpvp.  This won't be wpvp.  This will be campfests.    Why would you waste your time farming gold or some shit when you can get BIS items for just pvp?   
---
I am sure you watched the South Park episode on WOW?  Well, that's what this will be like.  You won't be able to level in the level 50 zones.  It will be impossible. You are going to have to go kill boars or some shit.

Except they won't camp every where and both sides will be farming honor. Not to mention you can always dungeon. Its decent exp and camp free.

---
I shall not oblige his sexual proclivities... Good day sir!
---
&gt; cited the world bosses as reason why it absolutely has to be gone by then.
---
which is all the more reason not to trust it.  that's ridiculous.
---
This is pretty crazy, is it really the case that for some reason in vanilla 1.12 hunters were bugged to share different cc types on the same DR? This was a bug? Blizzard refuses to fix it because they want to keep all the bugs?
---

Chill on the Snapchat filters, bro.
---
You should have thought about that 8 months ago.
---
Ha ha you are funny. Yeah, pvp on a pvp realm will ruin the game. lol
---
I strongly recommend against this path. You should rush Leader of the Pack no matter what. All of the absolute best feral talents are the ones *after* Faerie Fire (Feral). Furor is mostly useless and you'll win a lot more in pvp in those 5 levels if you go straight down the feral tree than you would win because of gimping your build with Furor too early.
---
They'll be able to reserve names before the crowd, obviously.
---
I'm a teacher and it is  dropping literally on the first day of school. No taking that day off!
---
It doesn't really need to be common, you just need to take the time to farm the gold and the mats for whoever gets it.
---
I see you are a man of culture as well.
---
I think those are 2 major flaws with Vanilla.
---
It's the first version of the game and not perfect though. You can see that the put class flavour &gt; dps/tank viability.
---
I think the way they handled class balance and itemization improved in BC. Classes were so valuable to bring to the raid and most were close until around T6 where the pure DPS specs pulled ahead.
---
And I am fine with that tbh. As long as the hybrid classes bring utility that is too juicy to pass up they will always get brought to raids. In Vanilla they weren't quiet yet refined to get there and neither were the items. But in its own way that is what made charming. 
---
In some cases I think we are the problem. We need to pull out of the mindset that we need to do max DPS to be valuable to a raid.
---
Yeah the entire problem I see here is people that don't want to play on a pvp server rolling on one.
---
You need to stop
---
i'd recommend herb/alch as a leveling warrior. warriors need health potions more than any other class cuz you have no other way of healing yourself, and your ability to escape is very limited. you will make very good use of alchemy as you level by chugging tons of health potions.
---
What race?
---
This ain't pvp.  This is just mass griefing.
---
How do you reserve a name?
---
We have zero indication of how they've handled the raids, let alone any hypothetical new ones they'd come up with themselves.
---
Ha ha you are hilarious 🤣
---
Same. No source, no discussion points, no purpose.
---
Honestly a little surprised this wasn't taken down as low effort low quality. That OP took personal offense for not reading the sidebar... Yikes!
---
You can go around and be paranoid and think that blizz will destroy your beloved game.
---
OR
---
You can actually chill and just accept it.
---
A raid frame
---
I think if I remember well that we changed coordinates within the clientside game files and be able to ba going by airships. We got chaught and thrown in the so called “Gold pit” for 10 min and had a 3 day ban afterward. Very fun GM we had to deal with and accepted our punishment.
---
Vendor in stv that sells pirate hat recipe I'm p sure
---
What the fuck
---
Investigate each streamer individually since I'm sure we really won't have much information until August 13th when they open servers for name creation
---
With layering in place, I don't really think there's going to be much of a "zerg" like there was on private servers.
---
yeah kinda cringe
---
So, sleep effects (wyvern sting or magic dust) have been confirmed to DR with Scatter and Freezing Trap. I don't think it's confirmed for the Helm, hopefully they change it because Gnomish MC Cap is kinda clunky to use as a hunter (because you can't use it if your pet is out). But apparently, Helm has always been supposed to DR'd with sleep effects and they do on beta on other classes than hunters. And since Blizz confirmed Sleep DR with scatter/freezing then Helm probably does too. 
---
So yeah, basically mage can sheep you forever, then full Helm you, then magic dust if needed, into another full sheep... CC forever. Meanwhile hunter scatters, into freezing trap 50% DR, if you use Helm or Dust after that it'll last like 2 seconds and then you have basically nothing during 15/20 seconds, except your immobilizations which are useless against casters, and your Intimidation if you took it... but Intimidation DR with grenades. So if you were thinking "eh, can still Intim or nade instead of scatter so I can land my trap", it's gonna DR your other shit anyways...
---
And yeah, apparently it's a bug and they keep it in... you know, despite changing plenty of other stuffs, adding QoL changes, but no, bugs that break Hunter pvp are fine.
---
In this state, Hunter will be pretty fucking bad in 1v1. You'll have your various immobilizations against melees... but they have broken leeway on their side now. You'll get out of their melee range, activate cheetah and get dazed by a white hit out of nowhere from 10 yards away. You'll be in a position where you can't melee or shoot at a rogue while the rogue is able to white hit you with crippling poison. Warriors will obliterate you with white hits if you can't immobilize them somehow.
---
Like honestly, I was all over hunter for pvp, because it's an intricate class that feels balanced, but it's always been a very thin line. The 1-2 yards that allowed you to escape range through your slows and start kiting, basically don't exist anymore with leeway, you get white hit'd from space and it's extremely punishing.
---
Nah, just go survival hunter :D
---
Layers are whatever size they need to be to ensure a stable game. At launch, they'll be small. Once people start spreading out, they will undoubtedly be bigger.
---
Layers are not supposed to be the size of servers. We don't know the Layering logic completely, just what we observed and tested in the Beta and Stress Tests. So far it seems Blizzard plans to aggressively Layer individuals and even seems to take into account how many people are in one specific zone. On launch day, a single realm could have 100's of Layers, all with no more than 50-100 people in them.
---
That's a bit dramatic. For starters the PvP sets cost gold so you need to farm gold to buy it. As far as BiS gear only a couple people can earn it. It's not like retail where everyone can earn the best PvP gear. Both sides will be killing each other so plenty of safe places to farm or just dungeon.
---
This is idiotic lol. You were getting effectively no healing of your FOL because of coefficient and you gimped your other stats. Literally just more int to cast more would give you so much more total healing lol...

A layer spawns the whole world
---
So much hurt during the leveling adventure, but it truly only adds to the satisfaction of reaching your goal.
---
Do TBC after, no separate servers, just run it like a usual new expansion. Then ***maybe*** wotlk, but that’s pushing it. After that, then maybe they can consider doing separate servers. After that, let wow die lol. JK, kinda.
---
The amount of time your likely going to waste for that gear could get you to 60.
---
&gt; After the first major group got their arena gear in the final season arena would have long queues and be unplayable probably on some servers.
---
I don't see the problem, you just merge all TBC servers into one battlegroup for Arena matches, resulting in a massive player pool that can easily support a decently competitive ladder. The more competitive players won't just quit after getting their gear, they'll play for ranks or play on alts for variety in team comps.
---
I'm trying to find a post someone made here a month or two back where they made themed dungeon nameplates for all the classic dungeons in one big image. Anyone know where it is? Cheers!
---
It really wasn't. Take those rose tinted glasses off, bud.
---
No. You will never be in the same Layer as someone on another continent, that we do know and Blizzard has confirmed. The two continents have never shared a single space in the history of WoW.
---
Blizzard stated LONG TIME AGO that layering would END at or before PHASE 1.
---
Blizzard is now estimating at most 2 weeks for layering.
---
Definitely this. Make time to eat well and get a decent sleep (7 hours is good) each day. Take in a good amount of water to stay hydrated, balance it with any caffeine. Fruit/Nuts/Tuna are good snacks too. Easy to eat on the go.
---
Most of the guides just rip each other off. Any organized guide is going to do well enough.
---
I have a bunch of software advice that may come in handy for you!
---
# [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com)
---
- Free to use
---
- Can be shared with everyone or just specific people
---
- Viewable/editable from any device/OS
---
- Allows you to paste images
---
- Allows you to make bookmarks to arbitrary locations (note: these are not the same as browser bookmarks).
---
Regarding bookmarks, they're actually incredibly helpful for WoW content. For example, in my own notes, I have a section that I called "Event-based TODO items", e.g. "When I get to Orgrimmar, do the following". One of those things is to visit the weapon masters, which I have in another section of the document. Thanks to bookmarks, I can link directly to that section. Here are some screenshots:
---

# [ShareX](https://getsharex.com/)
---
- Windows only (use [ShareNix](https://github.com/Francesco149/sharenix) on Linux)
---
- Lets you clip arbitrary parts of your screen to paste into your guide
---
- Lets you upload to Imgur with a shortcut (which is how I linked the other images in this post)

# [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com)
---
- Windows only (use [AutoKey](https://github.com/autokey/autokey) on Linux)
---

---
AHK can help out greatly for taking notes. There are two shortcuts that I use all the time:
---
```ahk
---
; Alt+win+V: make the selected text a link to what's on the clipboard
---
#!v::
---
SendInput ^k
---
SendInput ^v
---
SendInput {Enter}
---
return
---
; Typing `ref literally: make the selected text a link to what's on the
---
; clipboard with the text "(reference)".
---
::``ref::
---
SendInput (reference)
---
SendInput {Left}^+{Left}
---
```
---
These are helpful if you're like me and want to be able to refer to the source material that led you to a conclusion, e.g. https://i.imgur.com/KWNidTN.png
---
Of course, you can do a million things with AutoHotkey, e.g. have it so that pressing ctrl+shift+alt+G will open your leveling guide from anywhere.
---
Hey guys you wanna join my guild?!?!?!?! Hehehehehehehehehehehehehehe

I imagine it will be a lot more like a war than camping.
---
Dear god please don’t do this shit as a Druid tank. As soon as you shift out you get absolutely slammed by mobs. Have seen dumb druids do this mid level dungeons and the mediocre healing you get out is not worth the massive extra damage you’ll take while unshifted. This is only acceptable if you have a dps war taunt off you and you healer is oom so you can innervate and cast maybe one heal.
---
Bruh, these are *my* reasons for going NE over Dwarf. I don't give a flying fuck on your thoughts about them as you're not even the OP asking for them.
---
Doesn't matter - it's strictly for let people play without having to form lines for a quest.
---
Why are they better?
---
I would like to see some Caverns of Time stuff.
---
The 'meta' of Classic Wow is that Chromie hit a button to send us back to the good old days. This could be a massive mistake for the Bronze Flight because it is rewriting history... Which is what the Infinite Flight does...
---
Suddenly the Infinite Flight has a large recruitment pool of people that wish things turned out differently, so they recruit vanilla wow characters to ... say .. try to prevent future expansions from happening by doing things like saving Darnassus or telling Thrall not to be an idiot and leave the Horde to a genocidal maniac twice etc.
---
I'd also take less meta stuff like implementing half implemented stuff like Hyjal or the Emerald Dream (or less crazy CoT stuff).
---
(this all assumes that this is not introducing loot that leaves things like Naxx irrelevant)
---
I'm thoroughly confused by your question

Now, it seems like you think I'm referring to retail, which I wasn't, but even if I were I can't log onto retail and buy the current set of raid gear from blizzard. So, that's how.
---
However, I was speaking moreso about vanilla where (and i hope it stays this way in classic) this principle is much more distinguished.
---
Let me know if I didn't answer your question properly, like I said it was quite confusing as it's somewhat self explanatory if you've ever played endgame wow.
---
Sounds awful. You would make more money by training dots, leveling more efficiently and earning the gold back.
---
Thats why i am tryimg to figure out how big they will be
---
How dare you put Paladin icons in a Horde mosaic! You should be ashamed.
---
Maybe I'm wrong about this, but I'm assuming that rolling on an rp server is a good strategy for avoiding the big streamers. However...I'm only willing to do that if RP-PvP servers exist, and it doesn't look like that's happening as of now.
---
The people who watched this when it first came out were 13 in 2004. This was pretty much the highlight of The internet humour back then.
---
I am terrified by how many people think downranking is correct during leveling with no +healing on gear. The HPM efficiency jumps with every rank and it is by far the most important factor in healing low-mid level dungeons.
---
If a layer spans a continent then each player will be assigned 2 layers, one for each continent. For example. 
---
Player: Beertaster 
---
Assigned layers: EK3, Kal3
---
I'm on year 5 and got the stealth keys so everything is printed on the front face of the keycap instead of the top.  Still looks and feels like new other than a little shine in the spacebar and wasd keys.
---
They only want me for my pants.  Well I can't blame them. They are leather. They're a gay man's pants.
---
By chance have an Alliance version as well?
---
Hmm, for what though?
---
Let's pretend blizzard plans on having 34 layers on day 1, then by day 7 there are 12 layers?
---
Not sure why or how the size is going to affect anyone.
---
Only time it matters is when phase 2 hits and layers are no longer a thing and there are servers with 14k pop at peak.
---
They gon have some long queues.
---
Wait, but if you're wiping, who gives a shit if your feral dps does less dps than some other people?
---
Was looking forward to trying some exploration. Visiting [the Deadmines secret](https://youtu.be/TypwFz9CakA?t=310) is one of my best memories from vanilla.
---
I've worked in tech for a long time now, and I'm a huge fan of the [CODE Mechanical Keyboard](https://codekeyboards.com/). I have a Razer Basilisk mouse, which I've turned off all the lighting on using their software.
---
Great question!
---
No it's not. It's a game whose servers were kept online for 15+ years despite there being absolutely 0 new content for the game.
---
Yet people are crying that Classic will die very quickly if there's no new content added.
---
Just push all realms to TBC Classic and open up a single Vanilla-only realm for the diehards that wouldn't play TBC in any case to transfer to and be ignored forever.
---
yeah, I thought leveling as prot is more fun than leveling as ret. but my memories of that are from the late 40s and up. Probably I was ret until then.
---
You didn't watch the other video did you?
---
Yeah I forgive you. Can you forgive me for being an autistic dirtbag? ♥
---
No Paladins were harmed in the making of this image... maybe.
---
Flying mounts aren't nearly as unpopular as you think. They even tried to remove them in WoD and the backlash was so harsh, they quickly made an achievement system that unlocked it even though the world wasn't really built for flying like Outland and Northrend were.
---
Fortunately you can’t be on two continents at once so it’s irrelevant.
---
You probably want to pick a class that you or the other person will enjoy playing at 60.   Yes, the journey to 60 is part of enjoying the game but eventually you reach 60 and then, hopefully, you can continue playing together and having fun.
---
48+ give honor to people who are already 60. That's why I listed that range and said it would suck to be in it during phase 2
---
Oh shit I have been had
---
Private servers won't ever go away I'm afraid, there is always going to be a crowd who want a different experience from what Blizzard supplies.=
---
Ive read less than 1 percent of players reached max rank during vanilla. It will be a small group for sure.
---
So... you are admitting that it's immersive after all? Thanks, that's all I needed.
---
Remindme! 40 days
---
It’s spelled incite
---
Stealth is probably a good idea, my M is missing a leg and the O is becoming a C as well.
---
I've been on the fence of whether I'd want Vanilla, TBC and Wrath servers or if I'd like Vanilla with improvements on it and I really feel like it'd just ruin vanilla adding onto what it already is so I'll stick with getting separate servers for the other 2 expansions.
---
IDK but I laughed
---
I gotta be honest with ya, playing BGs for 16 hours sounds like fun. I wish I could do it haha.
---
I already have
---
‘MUUUM! TOILET!’.
---
That episode is pure gold, then to think the creators thought people would hate it..

It’s disable permanently before world bosses exist.
---
Someone gets it every week.
---
This is some solid input.  I respecced according to your build and I agree, it's much more powerful.  I also agree about aoe grinding.  There just aren't going to be aoe grinding opportunities in classic.  Thanks for the reply.
---
I think you need to have righteousness up most of the time, and to be able to judge righteousness to generate a big lump of threat (in lieu of a taunt).
---
But you might be able to start with wisdom up and judge it on him right away, then put righteousness up and use it for the rest. I don't know if it's worth it (e.g. do you get more mana back than you spend?)
---
You could put blessing of wisdom on, I guess.
---
I think consecrate is important for a paladin tank -- I would start with 11 in holy (spiritual focus is good, so you can heal yourself while getting beat on if you have to (in the world, not so much in dungeons); then get consecrate) and then go into prot.
---
It'll be a long haul until you get your other threat abilities, though. I guess sanctuary at 41 and holy shield at 51. But then you should be in good shape. (Paladin is a long haul in any case, I guess!)
---
Not a single streamer in Oceania region.  
---
Yay !
---
Fortunately r/wow doesn't seem to allow as many shitty, low effort memes. The content over there is generally not great but that's more related to my personal issues with the game rather than what people post.
---
TBC requires Flying and it's not nearly as unpopular as you think. Also, transmog, achievements, and the dungeon finder with cross-realm and instant-teleport weren't a thing in TBC.
---
I feel like they'd charge for transferring a character from Classic to TBC.
---
AtlasLoot, some map and gathering things, some kind of bag addon, auction house, threat meter. Not too much else, going to avoid having too many
---
I think you're confused on how layering works.  The starting areas will still be a disaster as a layer allows a whole servers population in a zone...
---
Private servers aren't going to be able to come back when the new copyright laws in the EU (that the US is also being lobbied to sign) come into effect.
---
For sure. Shaman are my favorite class. Unfortunately they are Horde only and I hate the Horde.
---
I never had the oppoprtunity to play Vanilla. I would like to roll a healer in Classic. What are the best healers?
---
&gt; with itemization to make some off specs more viable
---
Don't limit it to Kara though. Introduce these types of items as dungeon blues and MC epics and stuff too. Doesn't have to have entire tier sets or anything, but make it so that a semi-casual raider can hodge-podge a moonkin set that might not be top DPS but allows him to carry his weight. 
---
It would be fun to think up all the stats/equip bonuses they could add that would make them viable but couldn't be cheesed by other classes or what-not. Not an easy task but I'd love to see them give it a go to shake things up after 2 years or so of classic.
---
Which ones are the ones to skip.? The none colored ones.!
---
Warrior arms does decent in pve and fury does decently in pvp, it's not that bad in either case, gear matters more in casual pvp and pve.
---
Should be doable.     
---
People will come if they can expect the PuG to actually clear MC - anyone that isn't okay with the reservation part won't bother, but there are always folks that just don't care.
---
So, the most difficult thing would be to find regulars and build a good reputation for your PuG group with them. You won't be able to carry a MC PuG alone simply because you're a tank.
---
If you have that core group though and a reputation that you regularly clear MC, you'd be totally fine with that plan.
---
Having said all that - it would be way easier to just find a guild and be main tank there.
---
Nope. I know people who had their name changed for having accents. It also just looks fucking stupid.
---
Reason #524 as to why mages are the best class.
