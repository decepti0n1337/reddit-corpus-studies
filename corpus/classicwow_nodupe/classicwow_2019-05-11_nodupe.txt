I just saw a thread that had three pictures of tipsout basically letting his dick hang out and said there might be multitasking with the last GOT episode which is may 19th. So potentially, but these are all just rumors being stoked into a wildfire lol.

Spriest are bad for pve regardless of gear.

Lack of originality.

They don‚Äôt out scale rogues until after AQ and only on melee unfriendly fights. /shrug

That right wall needs some sort of coverage. A cheap, badass looking tapestry type thing would work well.

I actually know the classic release and what the collectors edition comes with (item wise) and the moderators keep removing my post even though i can provide proof. its mildly hilarious

Damn it man you can‚Äôt just leave pics of geared dwarf warriors on this sub!

I just finally settled on dwarf Paladin!

They're unavailable. WHAT HAPPENED?

One monitor for game, one monitor for BiS list, final monitor for whatever stream you're watching.

How do you plan to watch porn and play classic at the same time??

Gonna need the source too, boss
---
Nah I never said it was confirmed and it‚Äôs nothing but speculation, just something I was thinking.... would be best case scenario invitation wise. I honestly don‚Äôt care so much about a what will most likely be short beta/stress test, but just give us that release date! üòÅ I also don‚Äôt believe I was being illogical as you suggested. Simply put, I think it would be a great idea to send invites to all our lost friends. But realistically we have no clue. Just consider it a blessing if you get in! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
They do a good job later on. More than one isn't necessary though.
---
Yup, poor coefficients on main spells and very bad value of crit. Sad times.
---
Love the map
---
Ooooo - I think you're right. After doing some research, they were definitely added in a later patch. I guess we'll have to see if Blizz is releasing the gear all at once, or mimicking vanilla 100% and trickling them in phases.
---
beta is coming shortly along with the release date. I actually know the classic release and what the collectors edition comes with (item wise) and the moderators keep removing my post even though i can provide proof. its mildly hilarious
---
This is also a good idea - thanks!
---
Beta was a weird time.
---
Well considering you didn't really ask anything, I can't really answer anything. I guess you'll just have to wait and see if your friends all want to do 5-man stealth crew in a couple months.
---
But OP wasn't asking about what class was better than other classes with gear. They were asking what classes "really shine once they start getting geared". It is unequivocal that the extra 10% of hit gear available in later patches (or in this case, phases) drastically increase the dps of Warlocks, even if one could argue that other classes are still better than them. When the question is "how much does gear affect scaling?" I say Warlocks are higher than Mages or Rogues because those two classes already have high damage baselines. Even if they still stay ahead of Warlocks, they don't increase in capacity as exponentially, largely due to the +hit problems that Warlocks will have in early phases.
---
I agree that Hunters are kinda flat anyway, because they have a high baseline that never gets as improved as other DPS until they wane out at Naxx levels.
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt have one yet. Still trying to figure out a computer to buy.
---
Fuck yeah!

and now its friday, so we wont hear anything until next week.

Dude I think you think that we care. Stop trying to promote yourself surreptitiously. I see you swinging from the scrots of like every Classic WoW twitch streamer/youtuber, commenting on every twitter post, posting multiple threads on reddit about the same topic. You just seem desperate at this point.
---
Sadly spreadsheets show they‚Äôre a DPS loss compared to using holy weaving priest.

The fact that they‚Äôre DPS takes up so many debuff slots is also rough

When is it then? x)
---
FWIW if you just want a system that is one system you don't need to fuss with too much, I really think EPGP is the best. 
---
If you start adding attendance and keeping people at a certain spot and other complicated modifications to SK it loses its appeal as a "lightweight" and "transparent" method of distributing loot, so you may as well use a more involved system.  And I think EPGP solves the most problems with loot distribution systems.

That's what I wished they did for that arena in Valley of Honor in Orgrimmar

My wife if perfectly okay with it. She knows my stress release is playing video games and that its my hobby. I currently play about 6 hours during the week and maybe another 6 on the weekends. I play a lot when my son takes naps. Also my wife enjoys time with her friends who also have children. She takes the boy with her about every other weekend and that means even more game time, but she also does it for me cause I am usually worn out during the week and she knows I wanna play. I work a very physical demanding job.

They have all said many many times that starting from 1.0 would be awesome for Blizzard to do.  But they also understand that would be very hard for Blizzard to do

You don't even need to send you bank to town. Just create the character and flood his mailbox. Make the trip when you have the to level him to 5 so you can pick up enchanting.

They shut it down pretty early on, a couple months after release. I remember "casinos" on top of Orgrimmar bank... I remember being a noob first couple times in Orgrimmar I kept seeing rolls in chat and was confused how/why people were rolling, and remember people advertising casinos in /yell wondering how they did that. Then one day it was nowhere to be found. Also, I remember it always being an undead rogue running it...
---
nice dude.
---
Yeah, Warlocks are higher on that  list for sure. They turn into beasts in PvP with the right gear.

I don't believe you care correct. This was not intended to be self promotion. I made the video literally 10 minutes after I woke up. Yes, I should have made a different screen. But as I said the video includes the same information and I only posted it here as a part of the promise.

Actually that is not my motive. You can call me a liar and not believe me. My motive was to own up to my mistakes and apologies. I posted the video to remind me of the shame I carry as a result of those videos. I did not put tags on them, in fact I can even remove the video link if people are so pissed about it.
---
If I do recall they are doing item progression in terms of when they were released, but all items will be in their 1.12 state, so it will definitely come later if that‚Äôs the case :)
---
Guys you're all thinking with your northern hemisphere bias. They meant summer 2019 as in December 22nd.
---
There are guides for major weapon/armor upgrades while leveling. Find one for the classes you are interested in. A good wand/sword will change your leveling.
---
Leveling a gathering proffession takes several hours. Look into what end-game gold farming methods are available to your class before deciding on herbalism or mining. Herbalism for a hunter means more lucrative Maraudon solo runs, warrior mining for DM jump runs...
---
It shouldn't be starting at 1.0 it should stay 1.0 forever. 
---
The whole thing is we can no longer play the game we paid for. And I paid for 1.0.  Anything else is changes. 
---
If you argue for any content after 1.0 to be included then you should also be arguing for some of the talent reworks from TBC to be included as they were planned for vanilla but got delayed as they were too close to TBC being released.
---
Damn man this is sick! I never realized how many flight paths are connected to Thunder Bluff. Well I‚Äôm not a horde so does not matter, lol.
---
I can tell by your setup.
---
Discipline isn't a healing branch though. It's honestly more an augmenting branch to Shadow and holy like Arcane is for mages. The only true discipline spec would be like a holy smite spec.
---
I don't think you could distinguish discipline as a healing or offensive tree really.

Haha, I can imagine, this is actually an upgrade to what I had when I moved in - and there are some absolute shockers at /r/NeckbeardNests

I've never played Rogue before (leveling one now just to test it fo, currently level 24). I've been told that when it comes to weapons, i should simply use the ones with the best stats for my current level as there's much difference. I'd that i've always been into classes that can use duel wield swords so Rogue might be the one for me, not sure yet.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Anyway, I wanted to ask - can anyone please suggest me a build that suits both for leveling and some world pvp? Does such a thing even exists? Thanks in advance!

more than 1 monitor?

nothing duct taped?

That raid is a total cakewalk. What's great is that it's totally okay! It means you get to have a good time with 39 other people for a couple hours a week while you work together for loot. Most of my best memories of vanilla raiding come from MC.

So fucking dope.

Not being required doesn't make something a luxury. It improves performance way too much to be a luxury.
---
Oh come on man... Most fights you won't even be using that many frostbolts. Stop giving people an unrealistic expectations of how exciting mage PvE is.
---
Maybe they'll release it during June July or August to get a smoother launch since not every body will try and log in at same time... We'll I'm not getting my hope to high but it would be a smart move.
---
Added in 1.4 and we‚Äôre getting progressive loot tables.
---
I'm torn between druid and warrior.
---
I'll be levelling with a priest, although I'm not sure how long they'll stick at the game so I don't want to rely on them being around ad infinitum.
---
I generally don't enjoy dpsing, I vastly prefer tanking and secondarily healing is pretty relaxing. I'd like to take my time levelling tanking every 5 man (except VC) and figure as a tank-healer pair that will work out fine.
---
I like pvp, especially wpvp so would like a class that can do well there.
---
Warrior seems appealing as no one is going to doubt your ability to tank, I've never done one, their tanking kit in vanilla seems complicated and challenging, I could raid tank if possible. I'm worried though that end game will be pulling teeth in terms of shitty grinding and having a choice between no lifing or being stuck dpsing raids. 
---
Druid seems appealing because levelling and grinding will be easier, much cheaper repair costs, neat class in general. I'm worried though that tanking at end game is a pipe dream even as off tank and I'll have to spend a bunch of energy convincing people it's possible to tank 5 man's as people will have read "druids aren't tanks" and taken that as gospel. Also I'll never get to see the giant numbers that a geared warrior puts out in pvp.
---
Thoughts? Just how likely/grindy would warrior tanking be in like a once a week relaxed raiding guild?
---
What???
---
Be sure to watch my next fourteen videos to see if it really IS interesting!!!!

Downvoted because FTP   
---
Skol
---
I needed a better title and some WoW collectables in the shot, I've nominated myself for the wrong category D:
---
I'm not even sure spamming a single spell constitutes "play". It's more of just existing as a mage in a raid.
---
Go on...
---
This is good. Doesn't choose sides. Quests with everyone. Ganks and gets ganked while looking good.

We want to know more

That's a wednesday.

So no.

Then they would have less gravity and would jump higher.

That week maybe though?

---
This doesn't happen.
---
I mained a tank for years in a many mmos, and this is the main reason I tank. The fast ques and nice, but setting the pace and keeping a nice smooth flow through the dungeon maintains my sanity. You can work around bad dps or a bad healer as the tank, but as a dps you're at the mercy of the group.
---
Any healer can
---
Who cares? They speak from a much more recent experience than those who played hardcore in Vanilla, and are able to see how Classic might translate into a 2019 gaming community.
---
Very funny joke.
---
I was considering posting a pic of my setup but its literally just a computer, a chair and a bong.

[let me google that for you: vanilla wow spell coefficients](https://i.imgur.com/kfTiHaf.png) leads to [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/95abc8/list_of_spellcoefficients_1121/) that's fairly reasonably accepted.
---
There's a recent discussion among paladins if Seal of Righteousness scales at 10% or 12% regardless of weapon handed-ness... but it's pretty much accepted as gospel.
---
They always say "up to x amount" they don't say they flat increase. Just google vanilla spell coefficients. Some spells don't even have a coefficient at all. Frost / shadow ward for example.
---
1 screen in 2019 ? Especially in gaming :(

look at Plate wearing characters. Full set of plate armor and can still jump over a fence with ease. Even a Night Elf in full plate armor can do a flip.

    @Reldey: Nah.
---
Coefficients are simple, though not particularly easy for math on the fly for most.
---
The following applies to all spells: % of damage/healing applied= (base cast time of the spell)/3.5
---
As an example, pyroblast has a 6 second base casting time. This means it's coefficient is =6/3.5 or 171.4%. Healing touch is easier and offers another example. as its base cast time is 3.5 seconds its coefficient is 3.5/3.5= 100%.

This is a more likely to time period for 8.2 imo

---
Played all of classic, 2 private servers and only ever saw 1 binding and was when I was running an Alt Mc for OT. At least you haven‚Äôt done 4-5 years of MC and 0 binding lol
---
You shouldn't have a problem serving as a healer or tank while leveling, though especially for healing you'd be well off keeping a caster set ready. 
---
As for swapping forms in combat, there's not really any way to do so. The biggest reason druids as it is tend to stay in one form is the massive mana cost of transforming, you can't swap forms more than a handful of times per combat. Usually you'd want to save that mana for the last bit of the fight, in case something bad goes down and your utility is needed.
---
Terrible setup. No forearm support for your left arm. Move everything  45 degrees to the right, and stay healthy and happy, friend.

I think that much was obvious from the choice of page. I doubt anyone is nostalgic for the movement controls, or have forgotten how to right-click NPCs.

exactly :)

Hunter
---
Presumably not. Blizzard's philosophy on this matter is that the progression should emulate release, but the assets should not. Class specs will be based on their 1.12 releases, as will the stats of all available gear. Even though some gear will be gated behind a phase, the gear that isn't will have its 1.12 version enabled from the outset.
---
In this regard, given that mounts are items like anything else, only the 1.12 versions will be available if Blizzard continues to follow their philosophy on this matter. If there *are* old-school mounts in the first and second phases, then it's because Blizzard made a special exception.
---
We don't know, but hopefully. But maybe not since they seem to be aiming at a recreation of 1.12.
---
I put {this rig setup in dollars} into VTSAX this month.
---
Think of all the gaming we can do once retired, friend.
---
It's okay man, you don't have to lie to me, it's fine.
---
The sub is going to 'blow up' once the release date 'bomb' is dropped.
---
'Key' is sort of a misnomer, it's actually a ring that provides access by opening a door. Hence lockpicking or BS/Engi tools won't work.
---
As a dps I can just chill when doing dungeons, no need to have 100% focus all the time if you know the dungeon and it's not super hard (like high m+ keys). As a tank you always need full focus, you can't just do a "relaxing" dungeon run as a tank unless the dungeon is piss easy.
---
I was 13 back in vanilla and i raided naxx, so she's old enough! She's lucky to have a dad like u btw :D
---
Rogues are better in WPvP, Warriors are better at everything else.
---
Per the earnings call last week:
---
- 2nd half of the year
---
- Q3
---
- They listed several games that would be released at the end of Q2 (Q2 ends 6/30) and Classic was not among them.
---
This is the best most reliable information currently available.
---
This is the best meme I have seen on this sub, take my upvote
---
imo depends on your focus. if PvP roll UD, and if PvE roll troll. as for priest racials that is. besides that, raptors my dude.
---
Maybe someone accidentally leaned back on the huge red "destroy everything" button :o gosh darn it!
---
Lol what
---
Well that's encouraging, how likely do you think being a druid off tank in raids is?
---
I can buy that. But still, I think blizzard should have supported more tanking specs that are different than sword and board.
---
or he is not fucking himself over and is allowed to tease his community a bit.
---
It might, it might not. They haven't released anything like this before, Classic is NOT an expansion, and I think they've got an entirely different development team than retail. Anyway, the question was if most expansions are released during Aug-Sep, and the answer was no, they're not.
---
Honestly, as fun as playing WoW on your big TV is, I personally found the novelty wore off pretty fast... It is chill af though
---
Naxx is out on snort hale, so yes of course they have 2 raid nights.

it can but it won't

Playing the same race and class and character name but I have much different goals. As a 15 year old Vanilla player all I wanted to do was PVP. I distinctly remember the patch that added Warsong Gulch and how I (and it felt like the rest of the world, too) took a break from leveling for weeks on end just to PVP.
---
As an adult and having played on pservers, I'm far more interested in being in a good guild and clearing as much PVE content as I can. PVP will always be there and its something you can always do solo, but PVE requires a being a regular and committed team member.
---
And the winner is...
---
$20 LEDs behind the whole desk and also behind the monitors
---
It can crit, but base bonus damage for spell crits in classic is only +50% damage (150% total).

You are prepared

release date wont be in june. august is more likely.

&gt;i said i was way closer with the Blizzard's announcement that most  in here.
---
Most in here? the guesses as to the date before we were told summer '19 were all over the place. I'd like to see anything that suggests 2020-2021(Q1-Q2) is the most common guess. Your guess of Q2 2019 was also wrong so I don't see why you bring up the 85% downvotes in your OP, it seems like they were appriopriate.
---
&gt; The 7-21 July is about Blizzard summer release date and where i expect to fall   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; but Blizzard wants to form a timetable that wont mess with BFA patch/expansion releases. 
---
8.2 is expected to release in late June or early July, with the raid opening over the following couple of weeks. That seems to cover your expected release window pretty well. I don't think it'll matter personally, but you said your theory was based on not wanting to mess with BFA patch releases which it seems like it will.

Sun-Thurs just do calisthenics and light weights during downtime, should be 10-20 minutes/hour with flightpaths autowalking, waiting on something.

I got the first horde Stein too is awesome, too bad at the time I didn't have $ to buy the alliance one tho, would love to have that

&gt;will they be just shadowbolt spam, or will there be enough debuff slots that destro locks use corruption etc as well?
---
depends on the fight but you'll be keeping up curse of shadows and elements. any trash will be getting corruption spammed if you're sm/ruin for nightfall procs. some things will get curse of doomed.
---
&gt;will aflliction be viable
---
sm/ruin or ds/ruin (that being affliction/destruction or demonology/destruction)
---
&gt;how many shards do you go through in a given raid? How much time do you spend farming them outside of raids.
---
30 mins preraid is plenty. You want as many as you can fit.

Also pyroblast in retail definitely can crit. Retail player here.

&gt;I think it would totally make sense to have simultaneous release.
---
Which is all fine and dandy, if the OP didn't use the argument that 7-21st of July **wouldn't** mess with BFA patches and is therefore most likely. You're essentially arguing the exact opposite of OP.

I have played primarily horde but will be rolling alliance for new quests. I‚Äôm stopping to help my team 100%

I'm rolling Druid and I've done a lot of looking into it. If you going into playing druid thinking you're gonna JUST dps or JUST heal, you're gonna have a bad time. They're the master hybrid class, and you have to play them as a hybrid to get the utility out of them.
---
That said, 0/30/21 is a very popular healer spec. Yes, healer spec. They go up the tree to get Heart of the Wild for 20% increased intellect and they pick up Nature's Swiftness in resto. It's a spec that you can use to heal mostly, then pop into kitty and dps when you're not needed in healing and do some respectable numbers.
---
[Here's](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0ZE0bcfbdxVx0Vxo) what my understand of the build would look like. You can mix and match a bit, and i focused on kitty for you instead of bear, but either works. I also took Furor for you assuming you'll learn to powershift, instead of improved Mark expecting another, deeper resto druid to take those talents.
---
Pots, engineering, and other consumables are all optional, but some are more helpful than others.
---
True, but BWL had just come out not long ago and we were silly noobs with no wowhead :P
---
The point of a quantitative survey for academic reasons, is to get a lot of hits with "simpler" questions in order to generalize something.
---
These questions are bad for quantitative research and lean more towards qualitative in nature, which generally is used more to understand the reasoning behind certain decisions, and are also used in a more back and forth talk like an interview or a conversation, not a 3-4 question survey.
---
That's really awesome to hear. Glad your wife supports your hobby! My wife is okay with it but when we're both home I kinda have to tread lightly asking about it because she kind of expects us to be hanging out or watching TV together, but sometimes I would rather play games than watch TV, but fear asking her to not cause some unwanted argument. We're newlyweds so hopefully this will get better when we have kids, etc where we're more comfortable with spending time apart.
---
Logitech Trackball master-race reporting in
---
&gt;because up until then as a NE, we would just jump and double flip while throwing out rejuvs and it was boring.
---
You can take solace in knowing you at least won't be playing like that anymore, even if you roll a resto druid.
---
Honestly I think (even though polls show 50/50) most people on this sub will be horde... so you get more stories from it.. but there are plenty of alliance PVP'ers out there that will help a buddy out
---
This is definitely a great aspect of playing video games as a kid on a low quality pc/internet, vs being able to play the same classic wow we fell in love with as adults on a at least decent pc/internet. 
---
Also just more common sense and being able to play effeciently vs when you were young. Efficiency also key for people with busy lives who can only put in minimal time as adults. 
---
Glad you are as hyped as i am!
---
The alliance and horde banners should swap places
---
Jesus Christ lol..wish I could do that
---
I was fooled as well by this today. I clicked on it anyway, even though my first thought was, "Impossible!? r/classicwow woudl've blown my phone up already with notifications!!".
---
I would argue that RP-PVP is not essential on release, and in fact, better to release slightly later to capture a more casual population.  
---
Let hardcore players race to kill rag as soon as possible on day 1 servers, and let people who want to relax roll the fresh RP-PVP server a few weeks later.
---
YOOOO!!!!

&gt;New Classic 'Beta' patch right when I was falling asleep. Removes over 100k post-1.x sound files, leaks some dev addon names (neat!), bumps addon toc version to 11300 and has some other seemingly minor changes.
---
&gt;Minor neat fact, Classic now has 261635 files in its manifest opposed to 8.2 PTR's whopping 931490 files. They really cleaned out a lot of stuff already and there's quite a bit more to go still.

This is gorgeous

how is some random date on a random guild supposed to mean any kind of confirmation lol
---
they even have a "close" date for some reason
---
Delegate all the things
---
Why would anyone choose to be left handed?
---
I feel like there's a distortion of perspective on the whole thing.
---
Horde say they're the best at world PVP then complain when they get ganked by a group of Alliance.
---
Then claim dominance of world PVP when they work together... as a group.
---
Fuck it, I'm rolling Alliance again, suck my Iron Grenades.
---
I feel like a really key thing to mention is that on horde side priests are the only ones with a defensive magic dispel. I don't want to discourage you at all from going druid, but there's a lot of information swirling around in this thread and I feel like if you want to play a dedicated healing role the defensive dispel is a really important consideration.
---
Priests are also really complex in terms of going in and out of combat, while you do need help from your teammates in certain situations that a druid could easily escape, you also have a lot of different instant casts to use while moving, which means you have a lot of movement options compared to say a paladin or shaman who have to cast to do any meaningful healing.
---
Yeah dont really have many responsibilities besides fiance step son work etc. When i take my time off i do whatever the fuck i want lol.
---
Of course ill still have to throw some attention to my fiance to loose aggro every once in a while or pick kid up from school etc

I mean obviously. Demanding money sounds a bit ridiculous, huh? just like demanding someone get a PC.

Yep! Been prepping my girlfriend for months with reminders 3 times a week.

Omg those bags make me moist. All those consumables
---
I played tank once, fucked up twice in a raid, got my ego destroyed by too many people to count and left the group. Joined another that happened to have a few people from the last group and instantly was called a bitch for leaving the first one so that was the start and finish of my tanking experience
---
And it's my dream!
---
Funny how that works lol.
---
Sounds like complete bullshit. Even if there was somehow an observably homogenous "faction culture" across the millions of vanilla players, what makes you think it would magically be replicated by different/older people 15 years later?
---
You just reminded me of one of my favorite things to do... MOTW for everyone!
---
IIRC, there's only one alliance WQ like that in BFA, but two of the daily invasion capstone quests are of that type
---
lol exactly, it's annoying how infatuated zoomers are with these people. is it because young people dont have friends nowadays? so streamers are kinda like imaginary friends? i dont get it.
---
I'm going to wait 36 hours for the hardcores to burn out THEN start my hardcore grind at like 6am of the day+half afterwards of launch.
---
Yep i have already gave her a rundown multiple times of what im going to be doing etc. All cool over here.
---
Bravo good sir.
---
Not a bad idea either. Im trying to hit at least 40+ by the time my first week is over. Want to be 60 the latest a month but thats with work+gym +whatever else

I work from home, gotta keep my gaming rig far away from the office lol. I'd never get anything done. Do RDP on a secondary screen though when I occassionally allow myself to be on both. :)

According to this subreddit, EVERY SINGLE PLAYER wants to play on an RP-PVP realm.

I feel like this is in an old Russian missile base somewhere that someone accidentally left hooked up to the old phone lines and you're playing 56k.

I've played a lot on both sides and they're about the same in my experience.

No, I have a full time job unfortunately
---
There's going to be the first 24-36 hours of everyone hopping in right away, retail or classic lover either way.
---
I want to slip that a little on my time zone's off hours and then surge ahead once the casuals get bored of taking 4-6 hours to hit level 10.
---
No. There's no such thing as an overarching alliance culture. There is the guild you join and the friends you make and the culture you develop between each other. If you want to be in the kind of Guild that comes help people who are getting ganked, join that Guild. If that Guild does not exist, you can make that Guild.

People below me saying 'always let the Warrior charge' wasn't an etiquette on my realm. If you get the opener, you get the opener.

The same would happen in world PvP &gt; Warrior spots you &gt; you tag him so he can't charge.
---
Same goes for Rogues, duel a Rogue and you're free to cast any spell you can to get him out of stealth, otherwise you're just sitting there.

No, what's ridiculous is making this thread when the answer is so blatantly obvious...

Continue being an entitled, pretentious passive-aggressive little N.E.E.T though because it shows.

That one guy you grouped with, you just couldnt understand why it took him 3 times longer than the other people in party to jump over that certain rock. Or why he turns so slow it looks like arrow turning but you can tell its not arrows. He always takes longer to change targets. When you ask him to buff you it takes way longer than it should. Eventually you wonder. Is this guy playing on a computer from 2006? Is he mentally challenged? Or maybe hes playing with a trackball and a $20 membrane keyboard on his lap. LOL

Honestly I don't understand the appeal of rushing things. I am planning on taking it slow a couple hours here and there, actually read all the quests and just enjoy it. That said a lot of my friends are planning on no lifing it, so to each their own I guess.
---
Yea
---
My question is why? You obviously chose this uncomfortable, suboptimal setup. I just don't get it.
---
Also immediately after posting the last comment: ‚Äúto d-d-d-d-d-duel!‚Äù
---
I hate how much I love these.
---
I'm super torn between Shaman and Druid. I love the class fantasy for both of them and I'm 100% fine with being a healer (since that's what I want to do anyway) but I really want to farm herbs and PvP. I like Ele resto because you have the ability to one shot people with chain lighting and lightning bolt but at the same time they're kind of glass cannons. I love how Druids never die and their play style looks extremely fun for PvP. Constantly switching forms and being able to disengage from any fight. Now for PVE Shaman seems to be the most fun. I know for Shamans you want to be the MT healer but being one of the chain heal spamming Shamans would be fun. Chain heal is one of my favorite abilities of all time. I love the animation of it. Druids you seem to be casting rank 3 and 4 healing touch and rejuving everybody and trying not to over heal. Could any of you guys persuade me for either one?
---
Queue for battlegrounds, I'd love to meet you.
---
I‚Äôm on tichondrius. Literally it‚Äôs famous for its toxicity. I‚Äôve was on thrall in WoD. I‚Äôve never seen anything compare to what I saw in stormrage
---
My bank alt will be a rogue, level 10 (for Sprint), and will have enchanting. And his gear will be whatever he happens to have when I get him to level 10. Utility is all I need.
---
I second this. There's some places in the leveling process that are very thin on quests
---
DBM, threat meter and decursive will be required by most guilds
---
Why lvl 10 ?
---
Why would they market something like this at this time? We're close-ish to release but we don't have the date yet. I'd expect marketing close to or right after release (PLAY NOW).

I have an old TV just like that, that I keep just so that I can play Smash: Melee

And than you turn them in to gain 2 bars of experience

hahahah
---
Lvl the bank to 60 and buy the epic mount
---
Damn, the answer was right under my nose. I should've read more carefully
---
HHHrrrnnnnnnknnknkgngg.  My body is ready.
---
Threat meter is important unless if you are a healer. Dps/heal is optional. KTM or DBM whatever its gonna be called for boss mechanics. 
---
For healers UIs that help healing are very useful. If you have to dispell then decursive or any other addon that helps dispelling is also helpful but not mandatory.
---
try 30-40 session.
---
Beautiful set-up. Where did you get the  banners?
---
You know its a vanillla screenshot when auto attack is at the bar
---
When people ask me what my in game goals are for Classic, this is what I want to beat.
---
Removing all gear and punching lowbies to death in Redridge on your level 60. Sometimes they group up and manage to kill you (if you allow them to ofc, it's easy to just equip a weapon and start one shotting people)
---
where's the holy water on those adds boi
---
(Note that this is from the perspective of an alliance main)
---
I‚Äôve found this true with the exception of Tauren feral druids, who are like undead rogues with heals and root/poly immunity and are extremely smug about it.
---
Darkspear lean toward chill but are more of a tossup, Zandalari are aggressive but not vindictive, goblins are either keyboard turners or massive punks, Orcs are aggressive (straightbacks moreso), blood elves are often aggressive, vindictive, and at times caffeine-addled.
---
Just buy a desk/table lol. You could find one for like, nothing
---
what is that feet warmer? I'm struggling with cold feet in the winter.
---
Kmspico, look into it
---
I remember pushing a 30+ hour session around the time P99 launched, but staying awake that long has become alarmingly difficult over the past few years. Plus it's a total no go if Classic launches on a Thursday since I can never take those days off.
---
Yeah, it was. There's my PVP set in there as well. XD

Any good rogue youtubers to follow? PVE or PVP  doesn't matter preferably ones that are making/going to start making content, could even sneak in youtubers in general, I just subbed to Frost and binged all his videos, other than that my wow youtube subs are pretty dry besides CatDany asmongold stream highlights of him watching youtube.

---
Black Tuxedo is BIS.
---
2.0 patch maybe. Mangle and that arms warrior debuff there as well.
---
Compared to most other classes their pve is more complicated, trying to keep 100% uptime on SND and weaving 5pt evic, time AR with energy ticks, stay behind the boss, avoid clipping autos with SS and of course watching threat and on most fights you are trying to do all that while avoiding fire or whatnot. Now that isn't to say they are HARD but compared to say a mage or warlock who mostly spams one skill the whole fight and is ranged its certainly higher.
---

We need the Friday math guy to tell us how long it will take you to break even on the time investment to get to level 10 purely for sprint.

I always think about this. I am going to make two bank alts, a male and a female, I just have trouble searching for gear for them, can never find a vanilla only site with images of the gear.

I used to go for 48+ but it really messed with my head lol. Cant go more than 24 anymore without starting to loose my mind literally. Shadow people dont pkay around cuz

 I‚Äôve been effective with two add ons: R*count and H*albot. Purely to gauge my damage or healing while monitoring others and the healing assistant for performance while raiding. I just recently started using HUD but it is just for looks.

Yep, reliably killed your FPS every time. Annoying if you were frapsing but also wanted a screenshot.

Crazy that they didn't allow them to play as magic-based classes. I'm sure they partied with them and saw them around the game world, but they weren't allowed to play one until one day they sat them down and said "Son, its ok if you want to play a Mage or Warlock now."

When does heroic molten core get released? How much better is the heroic molten core gear than the regular molten core gear and how much raid content after molten core would heroic molten core gear trivialize?

Finding 40 people that can avoid standing in fire is hard enough as is

Soooo do you play horde or alliance?

How do you like it? I've heard the ruby bearings can be imperfect, causing ball lurch from a standstill. Is that your experience? I've already watched youtube videos on how to replace them with ceramic.

Tough to say. I am planning a week of 12+ hour days up front, but that is only in my head where Classic releases at one of my summer vacations.

The lack of a release date is killing me.

If there is, or if someone makes one, I'd like to get in on it too.. Figure I'll try my hand at Lua, just going to develop fir the retail client and hope I can port most of it over

wew.
---
I was T2/T3 NE hunter with the chromaggus xbow.  I can say at that point you eat most classes.  My favorite was shadowmelding at LM and taking on 2-3 horde before they could really close the gap
---
Nope, but getting rid unneccessary files is done to reduce download size. Usually one of the final steps before shipping the game.
---
Large format trackball like the elecom huge arrods better ergonomics and greater cursor precision and speed all in one package. I was a season 2 gladiator in Vanilla on a Kingston expert mouse trackball.
---
Pretty much the only area they lag behind mice is it's hard to find a large-ball trackpad with a lot of gaming-friendly mappable buttons. Elecom Huge seems like the best bet atm, though you might need to replace the bearings.
---
Or just streams and this is for Twitch chat.
---
Is that why your former allies were deserted in their time of need? Wasn't the guy leading that scourge a human prince? His right hand guy a former human mage?
---
The horde exists because of alliance greed and inaction. Lok'tar Ogar!
---
Looks wicked man
---
I think it should be the same stats but a different color tint.
---
Ah, man forgot to mention release timing. Theoretically, it would release at the same as as Molten Core, since it would take several clears for people to be able to attune for the Heroic version as it requires revered with the Hydraxian Waterlords. The gear situation is answered at the bottom of the document (not the best place for it, I know, formatting needs work anyway), but it would release no "better" gear, it would just be cosmetic/prestige rewards, as well as some crafting materials (arcanite bars and the like).

Hehe engineering is so broken, I love it!

Won't work in a tournament though.

---
With the endgame build you could also opt for Murder instead of the improved evis! It is situational, but either way both are sword builds.
---
Sorry I cannot spare much for the pvp aspect :(
---
What's with down votes on this? It seems an apt GIF.
---
Closed beta is upon us probably.
---
We don't speak of anything past the killing of arthas. Retails like a bad nightmare we all convinced ourselves was truth.
---
Classic is the reincarnation this game so desperately deserves.
---
For sure! Living Bomb has wiped a lot of raids. Highly mechanical fights just wouldn't work with 40 man raids for almost everyone, which is why I think 20 or 25 man raids are a much better size for raids, as it allows you to have large groups where the whole raid doesn't wipe based on 1 persons mistakes but still allows for individual responsibility that effects the whole raid.
---
HAIR CLIPS AND MAKEUP BRUSH... there's a white girl up in that room.
---
I wonder if the account wide mount concept will apply to mounts already acquired that are 1.12 accessible or will it be completely separate? You‚Äôd still have to buy the expensive riding skill but not mounts..probably a clean slate will be easier to implement for the code.
---
Yet the reality for those realms back in actual vanilla were all low-pop splintered realms. They have a small target audience and I understand why Blizz doesn't want the overhead of supporting more realms than they need to for what is probably less than 1% of the playerbase.
---
I appreciate it, but I'm fine, save your money
---
EVERYONE STAY CALM
---
i
---
Yep
---
Level 5 bank alt with move speed enchant on his boots. And knows Enchanting.
---
Aeron gang! :D
---
&gt;Well you typically call it by it's class.
---
Why though? I just call it dispel for friendly dispels and purge for offensive dispels, on both factions. Clear and simple.
---
I have a minifridge, but I left it 2000kms away :p couldn't afford to get it on the plane with me lol, that would be pretty neat though
---
Your trackball dig is true for thumb balls and small balls. However, get yourself a trackpad with a large ball positioned for use with the index and middle finger, such as the Elecom Huge, and you'll never go back to gimping yourself with mere mice.
---
...if you put in the time it takes to acclimate to one, anyway.

Wow they are really cheap, are they good for that price?

Thats amazing

Wow! Where can I get the world map?

Love the painting!
---
Haha yes casino‚Äôs and for allie it was the gnome.
---
I thought about chroma-swapped gear, and it would be neat, but settled on the "simple" rewards of a title and a mount and some extra crafting loot. Chroma swaps are a good option for sure though, they allow for players to show off what they have cleared without affecting the games natural progression, which is a big goal.
---
M
---
you missed what I was saying here
---
Amazon!
---
Provide the proof in mod mail and I'll approve it.
---
That requires open beta to start, close, and time for bugs worked out before release. Earliest likely be July. At least they don't need to make disc copies.
---
Oh......
---
My.........
---
God........................
---
Respect.
---
Absolutely! One of the cheapest 144hz monitors with super thin bezels
---
I played horde in retail, but alliance on private. For every death I had in red ridge I inflicted 10X in stonetalon. The horde watched their brothers die like cowards. Both sides have their fair share of wimps. I was not killing gray they were greens, and therefore no excuses. Most people will jump into a fight if they think they can win it. STV is when people run more often than not.
---
&gt; All cool over here
---
Day 3 isn't a problem because she thinks it will end. Day 58 is when she gets tired of "that fucking game". Good luck.
---
The best levelling build is simply the best DPS build and that is full 32 points in combat and then 19 points into assassination. With this build you will level very quickly with low downtime and you will not have any trouble in PvP except for intelligent mages. I've done it for 5 years on about 5 different rogues and I win at least 95% of my PvP encounters and breeze through levelling (although I focus on gear and enchants more than pretty much everyone else rather than levelling efficiently). Thistle tea is also extremely important in winning tougher fights and totally compensates for the advantages that hemo has in PvP, so I would recommend herbalism very much. Once you get Adrenaline Rush you can pretty much stunlock every class with absolutely no counterplay, including warriors and excluding frost mages.
---
Very nice setup OP, but I will say I am very charmed by the Lego characters on the desk to the right.
---
Where did you get the map poster? Can't find it on Amazon and I need it
---
Top 3 classes played will be mage rogue and warrior correct? Does that mean I should play mage to counter warriors and rogues? I considered warlock but they get absolutely destroyed by warriors and rogues right?
---
it's happening don't panic it's happening
---
if I don't get a beta key I will be big mad it's been 14 years I've been subscribed and never gotten in to one REEEEEEE
---
Im not a fan of separate difficulties because it ruins my immersion. I like the idea of more difficult content though. You can make things harder by lets say adding another wing with clearly harder bosses and something only obtainable there(legendary reagent) or simply more loot. Another way could be doing it the ulduar way, as example not using any keepers help on yogg saron, this way it doesnt ruin the immersion of having the same place in 2 different variaties. In molten core maybe it could be dismissing some hydraxian waterlord that is weakening the bosses.
---
How are warriors in WPvP? I prefer that over premades.
---
I want that crafted robes tho, plus the group im playing with want me to be the bag maker for the guild.
---
Same but like... I am doubtful that i'll get any beta for this thing.
---
Damn this is a boss setup.... But man, it seems like everyone but me sits so close to their monitors. My desk is 38" deep and my monitors sit towards the very back. I feel like I would have to turn my head too much sitting so close to the monitors like this.
---
I SAID STAY FUCKING CALM!!!
---
Also should consider that orc is just simply the best PvP race in the game and it's not even particularly close. Regardless of what class you're playing.
---
question marks on the minimap for completed quests, smh, not even a vanilla server
---
Wonder if they will consider going to 20-25 man raids to increase the tank percent per healer/dps in raids? Or maybe do minor restructuring of the other tank classes to improve their off tanking to compete with Warrior dps off tanks.
---
It might look like it but it‚Äôs really not that bad. I used to play WoW on 3x 32‚Äù monitors and it wasn‚Äôt that bad. Most info is displayed on the center monitor anyway
---
Sweet
---
Alliance is better, just saying....
---
I haven't played wow since TBC and I've been waiting for them to bring back classic forever. Why hypothetically cant they just roll back the expansions and updates? Why is this a huge chore? I don't know much about coding and making games and stuff but I feel like just installing WoW and updating to the preferred patch and saving that for a server wouldn't be to hard.
---
ü§§
---
Would updating the old raids with modern mechanics and upped difficulty be interesting? Absolutely. Do I ever want to see it become a reality in Classic. No. Hell no.
---
People in my guild really did enjoy that quest when TBC launched
---
Guys they update new beta build every week or so it doesn't mean a beta is going to release tomorrow.
---
Food/drink/bandage thats it. 
---
We had a few scum bags start using engineering but they'd get heckled by the crowd instantly. 
---
Of course you could clarify before the duel if engi was okay, but whipping it out of the blue was a low blow and since there was usually a crowd you got called out.
---
Then there were those that used engi out of blue and still lost and those were shamed hard lol
---
I totally understand what you mean. Ulduar hard modes were so well done in most cases (Mimiron just involving hitting a button and the like). I was planning on adding more "immersive" hard modes to the other raids, but Molten Core is lacking so much that its hard to make it more immersive besides just adding a whole new version of the raid.
---
Do you hotkey shift + number keys?
---
There is much more you can do to raise skillcap. For example cooldown stacking everyone knows, but pro rogues will absolutely min max it to hell, and stack things like Juju flurry, double crusader procs and thistle tea; pooling your energy efficiently so that you only expend it during windfury procs, (little known fact about windfury is that it grants you 340 AP for 1 second after it procs) which is difficult to do with AR, all the while adhering to fight mechanics, watching your threat and health, and maintaining maximum possible uptime on the boss and doing all of this during optimal cleave windows. It's a lot less braindead than casters and only warriors can optimize their DPS more than rogues.
---
That's different then
---
Well shit. That is amazing.
---
Yep, I totally agree. Classic is supposed to be Vanilla, and a heroic Molten Core isn't in vanilla. This was just a fun thought experiment.
---
Outside of Orgrimmar
---
Holy fucking r/battlestation
---
If you see my other post in this thread I totally agree with what you're saying. Tanks are severely underrepresented in vanilla due to both a spec viability issue and the responsibility concerns others have mentioned.
---
No, I'd suggest playing a Paladin so you don't infect the Horde with your retardedness.
---
Anyone remember the blizzard blue poster named ghostcrawler ?
---
So it's not fair to use things that everyone has access to but fair to use things that most people don't? 
---
That seems backwards.
---
Yes but cleaning up the files they don't need is one of the last steps before release, so that means that they seem to still be on schedule for summer, maybe even early summer, which is still hype news
---
Same, I used to lug it around for halo lan parties. They're definitely not lightweight
---
No. Not then, and not now. I just don't really like key combos as a personal preference. I used the F-keys back then, but since then, I have rebound Q, E, R, F. I don't really need to turn, my mouse does that, I like to keyboard strafe though.
---
 Who needs sleep?
---
2.0 had 40 debuff slots.
---
But what race/faction? I feel like human is obvious for Ally since Northshire is a stone's throw away from SW. If you wanna go to IF you can just hop on the tram.
---
For horde, idk if troll/orc or undead would be faster, but I guess troll/orc would save you a zepplin ride since there's no way you're gonna wanna stay in UC.
---
If its useful to me, im gonna need. Fuck em.
---
Holy FUCK brah. So dope
---
Great idea actually.. I think I‚Äôll do the same for sprint cheers mate
---
Hate to be that guy but fuck no. What's the point in being sleep deprived and feeling like shit afterwards? Honestly?
---
1. You'll more than likely crash for 14+ hours afterwards.
---
2. You're not gaining much of an edge because more than likely you're going to inevitably crash for an equal amount of time afterwards...
---
3. It's a fact people perform worse in a sleep deprived state.
---
4. No amount of stimulants can compensate.
---
Your call though, chief.
---
Is this somewhere on r/cringetopia??
---
Your question depends on a lot of factors, namely how good you are as a player. If you join the absolute best guild on your server, you have a heavy workload early for the first month or two of the server, but then you can literally just raidlog til Naxx, farm BiS gear for every content tier on 2 characters, and only play like 10 hours per week. But that requires you to dedicate those first 2 months SOLELY to WoW, like 12+ hours a day.
---
If you play casually, say 20 hours a week, and you're not spending every single second playing extremely efficiently, then I'd say you will never have BiS gear for the current content.
---
Happened often on Uther.  I remember diverting my focus there when I was tired of just working on leveling.
---
Where do I get a horde banner??
---
Because imagine modern day exploits on an actual rolled back 1.12 server. It's flawed and the best bet for security and server and client stability is to use the 8.1 API
---
No, it doesn't. A duel is an enclosed, simulated 1v1 with no stakes, determining which player with all available tools can defeat the other player. But if both players have the same tools available at the same frequency *and* those tools cost a lot of money, then you can either agree for both players to use those tools (and therefore spend money on a meaningless 1v1), agree for both to *not* use the tools (thereby still demonstrating "the winner" without having wasted money), or say nothing and then provide a perverse incentive for both players to use the tools in absence of an agreement.
---
Engineering *can* be a tool both players have, but it doesn't have to be. There's never a time Alchemy isn't a tool both players can have. So if you want a simulated fight but also wish to save money, then banning Alchemy is reasonable. Banning Engineering simply because only one player has it, however, is a bit like (for a better example) an Orc Warlock telling an Undead Warrior that he can't use WotF because it's unfair against Fear. The Undead Warrior has a specific bonus available to his character that has no monetary cost, and therefore if he wants to use it, he should be able to, unless both players agreed to setting aside racial abilities because they felt like it.
---
It's all about the money. Flasks cost a pretty penny, they have a high opportunity cost to wander into Scholo or BWL for the purposes of making them, and non-Alchemists can use them. So if you want a duel that showcases each player at their best, but also wish to save costly resources, then you ban Alchemy (honestly, flasks moreso than potions).
---
The pot plant makes up for everything
---
But no one even knew you made the promise.
---
Oh yeah.
---
There are WoW onesies!?
---
Thats why im only doing 16 hour stints. Still gonna get 7 or so hours of sleep every night. No hard crash. Your absolutley right now amount of stims can stave off lack of sleep
---
or just a pve server... Yeah i heard some cucklords actually play that
---
That‚Äôs why they‚Äôll do it.
---
Shes seen me level multi0le classes to 60 on private servers she knows the drill lol
---
I could see this happening down the road if they were to do horizontal content with Classic+ or something. Y'know adding content to what's already there rather than just changing the goalpost with a higher level cap.
---
Where did you get that desk at?
---
I love having city layouts that make sense... except for that one place we don‚Äôt talk about
---
True, I didn't think about the plethora of people who would try to screw with everything.
---
I always find it interesting seeing other's hotkeys. I use lots of shift +. For every key I use, there is a shift + of that same key.
---
Lol, what a fucklin nerd, if I walked into someones room and it looked like that I'd marry them.
---
Nothing?
---
Where did you buy the poster at?
---
If you make an alt and join a great guild that does split raids you will have an easy time completing your tier set no matter which class
---
Full tuxedo with monacle.
---
because in a raid dispel doesn't mean anything. A druid can't remove magic Nor can he remove poison with Decurse.
---
And you'll potentially have priests trying to dispel you for nothing.
---
And while they will usually be watching for it, it's just more efficient to mention up front what the class of the dispel type is.
---
Maybe so, but as the other commenter said, this is usually one of the final steps for a game on top of the news of the classic content creators being invited to Irvine.
---
Poster and banners off Amazon. May be out of stock
---
Too late hehe
---
IKEA kitchen counter top. Wrapped in Matte Black vinyl

Don't listen to a lot of these answers. It is not difficult. You can find a premade spot if you're a good player no matter which class you are (spec does matter though... don't expect to get into any premade as enhancement shaman for example, elemental or GTFO).
---
Yes, if they are 1080p monitors, you would run it at 5760√ó1080. Just need the software.
---
obviously there is something coming soon (i'd say 2 weeks) but this build doesn't mean anything, they've been doing this regularly for a while
---
Adding a variety of the same place, in this case adding a separate difficulty, doesnt seem so bad at first but once you take it further or way to far like retail, you realize its another thing that unmakes an MMO world. Just take deadmines as example, in classic there is deadmines, in westfall, for level 20 players, with 1 loot table. If deadmines would be updated in retail there would be, low level deadmines, timewalking deadmines, normal deadmines, heroic deadmines, myhtic deadmines and mythic plus deadmines, which all have different loot tables and entry requirments. Those are not places in the world but just scenarios players play to get ready for other scenarios.
---
This is why I plan to play on an RP-PvP server. Roleplaying can start this sort of thing, then before you know it it's basically player-generated content.
---
I'm just saying I think people are just hype specifically because of the content creator summit.
---
The client for Mac works fine. I've used it for two years up until now and it's still working.
---
Facebook marketplace man. Desk/chair combo $30
---
"The difference in viability at end game between a hunter and a mage is less than the difference between being a human or a gnome mage."
---
This is just utterly BS. A mage in Naxx will literally double any hunters DPS.
---
Do you guys not have phones?
---
What, asking about if retail is going to have a Mac port? Not really. When you barely keep up with the current state of things relating to modern-day Blizzard, it‚Äôs less obvious than you think. 
---
Don‚Äôt see how anything I said is me being entitled either. Besides being entitled to my own opinion? As far as being pretentious...eh, I can say more or less. If you‚Äôre saying that then you don‚Äôt exactly know what pretentious means. If anything, what you just said is pretentious in itself. Don‚Äôt know what a N.E.E.T means and it‚Äôs probably nothing good. As far as passive-aggressive I agree 100% on that one.
---
Don‚Äôt do this please
---
The image was posted on this sub a few days ago. You could probably have one printed to whatever size you want.
---
Filco Majestouch 2 Ninja with white SA Filco keycaps from mechanicalkeyboards.com. 
---
If I could do it again I would get TKL.
---
Imho worst way to release a game. Announce it 3 years prior, and then leading up to release give no clue as to the date. Should‚Äôve just done like google stadia - ‚Äú and it‚Äôs coming end of this year‚Äù fuck the graphics updates fuck all the bells whistles üëΩ
---
Anyone know if you have an actual chance at being chose for beta if your battle.net account hasn‚Äôt had an active subscription in years?
---
We gone do it and we gone do it big
---
I got the alliance on eBay and probably overpaid for it, but I love them too much!
---
You guys get me pumped up every day. MMMmmmmmmmmmm, lets go!
---
no possible way to discern, no. :( here's to hoping though.
---
Maybe I should just try that Mac client then.
---
Would be cool if they ever do a classic + server separate from the static classic servers.
---
No
---
Yeah that would be cool just to get a different color or something of some of the gear.
---
I'd prolly do that shit for the first week if my wife would leave me alone. I have plenty of PTO but when I'm off work and home shes always wanting to do some lame bullshit. 
---
Itll be my usual 2 or 3 hours at night if I'm lucky.
---
Anybody that opted in for beta has an equal chance.
---
I have played a rogue last 5 years but I am going to switch to fury.
---
I love rogues, truly. I love going into Stormwind and solo killing the flight master. And then sit and watch as clueless alliance gather around ol' Dungar Longdrink. No other class can do that. Also things I like in rogues favor is that they only stick to leather, warriors mix and match plate, mail and leather and that annoys me. Obviously stealth is an incredibly convenient utility. And I like the class fantasy better. 
---
But Jesus, warrior is just the superior melee and it's not even close. They do more DPS in every raid tier. in PvP rogues can kill warriors 1v1, but you have to use 4 5 minute cooldowns, TWICE, and have like 60 seconds of uptime on the warrior, to prevent them from charging or intercepting you, mortal striking you, and executing you in all but 3 globals. It's honestly ridiculous. Then the rogue has no cooldowns and can't do shit, while the warrior can charge off and global someone else. 
---
For those reasons I can't ignore the superiority of the fury warrior. And I hate to say it. Because I like rogue better. But as a top tier raider I must do what benefits my guild the most, and that is to play fury.
---
Why not? It's a spec in the game that people play just like everything else.
---
No one lets you forget the amount the reference gets dropped and the source video gets reposted.
---
Only if you're the designated ignite Mage.
---
I've gotten into betas while being subbed and while not being subbed. It's just chance.
---
I need a few: Bartender, CooldownCount, Omen, Quartz.
---
Purpose: Bartender to obviously move bars around and make it easier to keybind but an important thing for me is full icon out of range coloring rather than the default bind only. Cooldown count is self-explanatory. Better than the "clock" style for longer cooldowns. Omen is also self explanatory. Quartz for a more detailed cast bar and the GCD bar.
---
That's pretty much it. Anything else for me is purely aesthetic.
---
I like
---
do you not use q/e or any of those easy keys? o.o
---
Or have scheduled duel tournaments with betting or something. That'd be neat.
---
If I'm not mistaken, there actually is a normal and heroic deadmines right now, which was updated in cataclysm, with a heroic version for level 85 players with a bonus last boss :P. But I totally understand, the goal isn't for this to be even remotely something that would actually fit in classic, just as a fun (for me) thought experiment.
---
I got one, broke it after a year. Went back to the store and bought a new one and 2 more to keep on reserve. Best I've ever used.
---
I use 2 side mouse buttons, F for healing, G for mana, S-R for cooldown reset. Other than that, ya almost the same UI.
---
Nothing personnel kid
---
Keeping the trend üëåüèº
---
for rogues WoTF is not as good as other classes, but still great. However orc racial doesn't have anything to do with scaling, having base 30% stun resistance is what makes orc the best class in PvP period, no matter what class you are playing.
---
When the code decides it really wanted to ERP with the monitor instead of going for the graphics card.
---
..or something.
---
Yes I do use some easy keys such as G,F,R,T. I do remap a lot of my keys but other than that, this guys UI and mine looks almost identical.
---
I strongly disagree with this. WoTF is good because it allows you to use a 2nd DPS or utility trinket. You should never run both WoTF and PvP trinket as a rogue.
---
The effects of sleep deprivation will still be felt *in the long run*. People have to remember that unlike retail, classic is a marathon, not a sprint...
---
Those thinking of pulling 36+ hr sessions are crazy. Although it's pretty rare, people have actually died due to blood clots forming. You guys better be taking breaks.
---
Amen, need less people in the pool to get an invite
---
Got the same color Aeron and everything. Mainly because I know it'll be getting lots of use this summer.
---
Cold snap and lay on hands always seemed to get salty responses
---
Absoutley taking breaks. Every few hours gonna get up get the blood flowing a bit etc. Not long ones but def breaks lol
---
I really hate to do that but for the ones that did not know, this video was staged... still epic as fuck but staged :(
---
This is why deviate delight and noggenfogger elixir exist.
---
To fucking
---
Cheers m8. All I needed to hear.
---
Can you by Any chance provide a link for this exact poster?
---
My family had aol for longer than necessary. I used to login to aol then launch wow. Dont know how it ever truly worked.
---
I could care....for money
---
Then why do people say no lay on hands?
---
Also alchemy is only available to all players because some players actually choose to get it.  Saying that it's okay to use engineering items because you chose that as your profession for pvp shouldn't let you say it's not okay for someone else not to use their profession for pvp. 
---
Or do you also think that no boe crafted armour and weapons should be allowed in duels because they are available to all players and some can cost a lot of gold. 
---
Actually if it's all about gold then should no boe epics be allowed in duels unless you have proof that you got it from a drop and not from the AH?
---
He was the lead game designer in vanilla. Hard to forget.
---
In my opinion hemo swords is the best PvP spec in every tier. You have more control than everyone else and you can get a 5pt CB/Evisc every fight with no cooldowns or tea during a full stunlock.
---
Ignite. With 5 points that's 40% of total crit damage over 4s - so roughly 110% 
---
A 5k crit will deal an extra 2k damage over the next 4 seconds, making the pyro 7k in total damage.
---
I'm here for the hookers... oh wait, wrong room..

Brave browser? Do you use BAT with it?

Nope. Any mage.

---
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN
---
Retail expansions have been releasing in late summer (Aug-Sept.)-November since 2012.
---
I agree its not retail, and that theres a nothing we can compare this to, but its hard to argue that theyre not attempting to fit this release into the end of quarter 3 to boost that and to give them momentum going into Q4 as they have for a long time now.(7 years).
---
Where did you get the map?
---
Unless you're on the receiving end
---
I level from 10-25 in barrens (dungeon grind included) hit stone talon for as long as I can (I think 28-29) go to hillsbrad (until 33 if I remember correctly) do the SM quest (35) then go to Desolace (38) then I go to STV. That way low level killing quests are ez and ganking isn‚Äôt too much of an issue
---
I'm not sure what he's up to currently, but a handful of years back he was working with Riot on League of Legends at its peak.
---
Not just too much responsibility 
---
But if they fuck up or make a mistake no one will let you hear the end of it 
---
A lot of people don‚Äôt like having people bitch and moan at them for getting wiped in a dungeon
---
Where?
---
You figured out dps warriors before private servers did lol
---
Savage

I don‚Äôt trust someone that doesn‚Äôt pick a side!

Understatement of the decade.

I can't find it. Help?

ahh, I thought you meant his keybinds as well and such, made me curious

CLASSIC RELEASE IMMINENT, YOU HEARD IT HERE FIRST FOLKS
---
What desk do you use
---
IKEA counter top wrapped in Matte Black vinyl
---
Sweet. See you in Azeroth this summer.
---
Who are you lol
---
You new in town?
---
Ill give it two hours maybe three hours. Only after the kids go to bed.
---
WE DONT KNOW, THEREFORE RELEASE TOMORROW
---
BAT?
---
It needs to be designed for portrait or be IPS. Standard TN panel monitors viewing angle does not work in portrait mode! Found this out the hard way.
---
What‚Äôs wrong with trackballs? :(
---
Works wonders for limited desk space
---
If there's no one duct taped to the ceiling, you're not winning.
---
Standard TN panel monitors have a limited viewing angle and most don't work very well at all in portrait mode!
---
wut? They aren't going to change anything.
---
The specs that have the most combo points to work with are Seal Fate and Hemorrhage. Seal Fate doesn't really become a thing until AQ40/Naxx, but Hemo is viable at any point. It's more of a PvP spec, but with the right raid setup (lots of melee), it's viable to have one Hemo rogue in PvE as well. It just doesn't look good on the meters because a lot of the DPS comes from the Hemo debuff which is distributed evenly across all melee attackers. That's why it's an unpopular spec. It's kind of like the shadow priest of melees.
---
Thanks for the indepth reply. I raided hardcore in TBC and got the glaives and whatnot but our guild wasn't top on the server or anything. I just haven't raided in vanilla so wasn't sure how possible getting geared would be when the raid has like 8 rogues instead of 3. Though now that I think about it, several classes shared a single token in TBC, so maybe the time required to get the set won't feel much longer than it did during TBC.
---
That tauren in hwl gear. Tauren warriors don't always look as good as orcs in like what will now be phase 1 gear (still look boss though). But everything that comes after that..tauren warriors kind of take the cake aesthetically. They look so good in blue and epic PvP sets too.
---
I came
---
What do you mean?
---
Blizzard has supported Mac since the mid 90s, except Overwatch. You‚Äôre good
---
doesnt matter as long as your bank alt is a warrior. Thats meta.
---
I drive a sonata.  Highly recommend to others.
---
didn't add a ...hic after.  Literally upvotable
---
Except they're purposely slowing their server refresh rates...
---
Opportunity squandered
---
I fully (and respectfully) disagree with you. Why should I and so many other people who want to play RP-PVP have to wait weeks to play on a server type that existed in the vanilla days just because some hardcore players want to kill rag? We matter just as much as any other players out there.
---
Not the same one but here‚Äôs a nice plain super high res map.

Proud of you for not subbing
---
The other MMOs at the time started having these (like Warhammer) so Blizzard just integrated them more each expansion to make sure nothing else could be as good as WOW (see also Aion, TERA, Conan)
---
This was from my old vanilla guild called &lt;Obsidium&gt; on Ner'zhul. Shortly after we transferred to Nathrezim because the queue times to login got crazy long. 
---
This was when tier 2 still had place holder for the armor sets. So many great memories during vanilla. So excited for classic.
---
I will never not up vote this video.
---
This is an underrated comment... see sticky tar at lvl 60
---
Lvl 5 with minor speed enchant to boots.  All green outfit with a green guild tabard. Guild name to be determined.  Alt will have a big enchanting bag for all the de‚Äôing.
---
I never once used Lay on Hands in a duel when I played Paladin in BC. The cooldown was too long to justify as being a "repeatable effect". If I could only beat someone once every hour, that means they were better than me.
---
If Engineering items were not actually restricted by Engineering skill, then I would actually say they *shouldn't* be used, since they'd also be a form of equally accessible consumable that can be removed to find the "lowest common skill denominator". But they aren't. Engineering items require Engineering, so because using them won't compel the opponent to go buy some to use themselves, I treat them much in the same way I treat class or racial cooldowns.
---
Obviously there's going to be gear discrepancies unless both players duel naked (which is honestly pretty funny sometimes, especially in Vanilla if you had leveled your unarmed), so your analogy breaks down. You might as well say that raid gear isn't allowed against a non-raider. You can't ever hope to create a perfectly equal environment without restrictions that border on the absurd. But you can take steps to make a more evenhanded one. Do you honestly think that it's reasonable to go outside of Orgrimmar or Stormwind and then pop an item that cost over 100g and lasted for two hours to fight a single person for two minutes max, and then say it was a reasonable outcome despite having 1200 more HP than them? Or create a "meta" in which the opponent, in order to get an even footing in this regard, needs to spend 100g themselves? People didn't typically use flasks for *40-man raids* until BWL, especially since they didn't persist through death until 1.7.
---
It's a simple matter, and I'm frankly done arguing about it after this post. If both players use flasks to make themselves "equally buffed", they're both down, say, 100g. If one player uses a flask, they're down 100g to prove nothing in a duel that was unnecessarily one-sided. If neither player uses flasks, they're both equal and not down 200g collectively.
---
If the choices are either "equal but 200 less gold", "not equal and 100 less gold", or "equal and no money spent", then the third option is best. Not because it's unfair to have Engineering or not. Not because Alchemists should be able to use their profession in fights or not. Entirely because *you shouldn't be wasting raid buffs on duels.*
---
Potions? Again, if you wish to use them, fine. I think potion use facilitates a lot of hit-and-run tactics, where you just try your best to hide for two minutes until your health pot is back up and your opponent does the same, so I personally duel without them so as to make sure duels aren't 10 minutes of guerilla warfare (especially when fighting Rogues). Bandages and food are fine because (A) both players almost assuredly have them; (B) they're cheap; and (C) unlike potions, they can be interrupted by ranged chip damage.
---
But hey, if you want to waste fucking Black Lotuses on crafting endgame raid-level death-persistent buffs in order to stroke your e-peen in pre-resilience Durotar scuffles against people who are going to whine and moan that you refuse to fight them fairly, then go ahead, and good luck finding people who actually want to duel you.
---
Pre-raid BiS!!
---
Blizzard has supported Macs for about as long as they‚Äôve been making games. (Except Overwatch) 
---
And maybe he didn‚Äôt get it for gaming, it can have multiple uses.
---
Good way to get caught in the Swarm honestly.
---
If there's one rp-pvp server only, let's say it's in NA or Australia or Europe...people will demand one in every region for ping purposes. It would only be fair, don't you think? Has anyone but Blizz really thought this through? So to be fair now you most likely have to add three more realms when there's not really enough people demanding it for barely one realm. The petition is still showing less than 1K--and many of those just support it for those who want it, so it doesn't seem like all of those would actually be playing it. And here, though people keep bringing it up, the threads themselves are not very upvoted. 
---
Don't get me wrong. I played in one in Vanilla, but it was not there at the start. It was a piratey guild and we had fight nights and stuff. It was fun and all, but even then not really popular enough to hold people.
---
Iiiiiiiiiiiiiiit‚Äôs Tiiiiiiime!
---
You're a brave one, bringing calm reason and sensical trains of thought in here.  Begone ye of little hype.
---
Not Vanilla, he took over after Jeff left for what became Overwatch
---
That makes my shitty setup look even shittier. But it looks great, well done.
---
i played wow for years and was opted in for all betas. I never got invited. The only times i got to play a beta was when i was a guild member of a pretty good raiding guild that got "invited" through our guild leader giving out keys that he got from someone at Blizzard.
---
Stopped playing in WoD and hadn't played since years and randomly got invited for the BfA beta. So yeah there is a chance i even if you dont have an active subscription.
---
I respect u person
---
decursive might not work in classic
---
I've seen these setups on here... And I thought oh that's cool good for them. This one makes me think two things:
---
- I need that monitor setup.
---
- I need all of this
---
yeah just disgusting seeing that on a hunter...
---
Some people don't like 1080p resolution at 27". Pixel density is better with 1080p at 24" or 1440p at 27". 
---
Personally, I think it's fine. Especially considering the ridiculously low prices of these monitors including 144hz.
---
Hunters and druids will have an easier time gearing than any other class but the rest is really quite negligible and is guild dependent not class dependent. Level an alt and do split raids and you will have the best gear no matter what
---
Torn between hunter and shaman. Played hunter when I first started, don‚Äôt want to deal with the pain in the ass feeding pets and buying ammo. Been in love with enhanced shaman since BC and Resto is fun too. Mainly PvE but wouldn‚Äôt mind PvP as well. 
---
Any ideas as to how enhance shamans did in vanilla pve and pvp aside from the pvp montages?
---
Its mildly hilarious that you think we believe you
---
What we are doing is really a hard set thing, we arn't sure if we are actually gonna form our own guild as most people we are in the group are gonna be leveling at different rates and would rather ah their cloth than give me any.
---
Put on your masks and watch!  Watch the magic pumpkin!  Waaaaaatch......
---
So they'll be back on the 23rd?  Must be our official beta date
---
It‚Äôs hard to imagine someone who has played WoW past lvl 25 not knowing that this was staged.
---
I actually just downloaded the Mac client a few days ago cause I wanted to give pservers a test before classic, it works just fine - have fun man
---
why's that ?
---
Lol I work physically demanding construction before two 1 hour breaks, 14 hours of labor. I've driven trucks for 24 hours straight. I think I can take bong hits and play WoW for 14 hours tops if I'm on a mission and it's the weekend. It's not something I'll want to do that often though but I can definitely perform and get the sleep after.
---
Just don't eat junk food. I'll be eating salads with fish, cliff bars, and green tea for alertness along with medicinal marijuana.
---
How tall are all of you? I had a HM at my office and I hated it, the seat pan was wayyyy to small.
---
Wait until release
---
A guild tabard and nothing else
---
While I understand your point, the extra "useless" spells are nice and help to define class uniqueness. MoP had quite a lot of these spells (see druid symbiosis) as well as more interesting rotations
---
The trim could use some fresh paint, so there's that.

You did so in bad faith, with no intention other than being annoying (which failed), and no sense or rhyme to your posts, no attempt at civilized discussion. By calling me foolish for answering, you essentially admit that even you yourself realize how worthless your posts are.

The reason why I am answering you? Because I get mild amusement out of publicly dismantling you. The sorta amusement one would get from a bad TV show, a sort of background noise.

So think about "foolishness" again, friend, and maybe seek a mirrors help when doing so.

Rogue raiding too, they probably died in many AoEs. Makes me feel bad about being upset at people who didn‚Äôt get out of the fire

I'm sure there are hoarders on this board that have computers stacked with so much stuff around that only has a window on the mess to see the monitor, and a hole in the mess for mouse use.

Or lazy shits that do the same with pizza boxes &amp; mountain dew cans.

Doesnt matter if you are enjoying the game! Don't let it get you down
---
Guy on my clash of clans, clan claims to work for blizzard. Says release is early July. I have my doubts to his reliability tbh but provides me with some hope lol
---
Unless they don't consider Classic a "new release" and more almost like a patch release or just another version of WoW. It's probably just considered an addition to current WoW since it's tied into the subscription.
---
Not sure it matters what sub a shrine is posted to - if saying something is *"A bit over the top"* is too much then maybe thicker skin is needed?
---
Ah, that's right about broadband in general.  I remember now reading someone making that point as well a long time ago somewhere (probably an MMO-Champion forum post).
---
I often forget I was rather lucky to have relatively early access to decent high-speed internet.  I went straight to cable internet, skipping DSL/ADSL entirely, in 2003 or 2004.  So it can be hard for me to realize how much of an impact that truly made on MMORPGs, something that's hard to understate.
---
And that's true about the seamlessness and cohesiveness of WoW at the time.  Although I doubt every MMORPG back then was like RO where *every* area was loaded separately similar to a Zelda game, I assume many did have a lot of zone borders for loading, didn't they?  The ones I played sure did, but they were Korean, so...you know, that's that.
---
I did overstate the importance of luck or coincidence in a game's success, but yeah, I'm glad you got what I meant.  WoW surely would have been extremely successful no matter what, but it's interesting to me to look at what could have caused the severe degree of success it enjoyed until Cataclysm.  But I realize now that can quickly spiral into an exhausting, neverending discussion of factors like society a a whole, generational shifts of lifestyles and tastes, and blahblahblah, so eh. :P

Reminds me of the time in the beginning of BC when one of my WoW friends came to visit and he checked out my char on my PC. He then asked me how I had managed to raid BWL as a healer with the amazing 5fps I was getting. It blew my mind when he scaled down the resolution and it all became a lot smoother.
---
When I finally got an upgraded video card I just flew around Shattrath for a while, in awe about how good the game looked.
---
absolutely incredible. Where did you get the map if I may ask?
---
Haha it was your post among a few others that got to me! Honestly man it‚Äôs the sickest set up I‚Äôve ever seen. Big up to you. If I had the means for a set up like that I‚Äôd do exactly the same lol. It‚Äôs not getting me down just slightly envious. Thanks for the words of encouragement!
---
&gt; We matter just as much as any other players out there.
---
  
---
Definitely, man.  
---
I'm just saying a later RP-PVP launch may lead to a higher quality population on those servers. Here's hoping they release them day one, and also later on as time goes on.
---
Thank you for sharing ! More dots!!!
---
I remembered more than I got credit for. Apparently I am an atrocious speller.
---
Well technically the only WoW players you see are ones who make money from gaming so that doesn't make sense. Not all of us work jobs where we can play during a shift. 
---
Make no mistake anyone from fry cooks, programmers, ironworkers and even tweakers on welfare have played WoW.
---
At the end of the day. All that matters is we‚Äôre in Azeroth together and fully immersed. I‚Äôd happily be plastic table, butt pillow playing wow than not!
---
I'd imagine based on what happened with the Halls of Origination that it would send a massive shockwave across the planet decimating every speck of organic life. It likely reaches deep into the planet aswell. It also probably risks killing the world soul
---
Did you frame the map yourself? Or get it from somewhere? 
---
Also, would you be interested in doing some product shots with your setup?
---
Thanks for the kind words my dude! 
---
Honestly it looks more expensive than it is and very doable. 
---
LED's were $20 per strand
---
Monitors were $200 a piece (Great price for 144hz 27" monitor with super thin bezels) 
---
Posters and banners were only $20 a piece or less
---
Counter tops were $40~ maybe less.
---
Nothing was super expensive. Just made it look like that ;)
---
Maraudon sucked but it had phat lootz
---
Wait a second. Hasn't seen WoW players who work hard jobs? Hmmm let me guess. Alliance?
---
Framed it myself! Had the frame forever and it just fit perfectly. Dimensions are in the link:
---
Absolutely interested! What were you thinking?
---
Who is offended here and needs skin to protect themselves? You're a dick for defending and making your comment. What else is there. Pretty straight forward.
---
Honestly never saw it after many visits until right now.  Thanks man
---
It's slightly true. According to this survey you can see that horde players are a bit more pvp focused  https://aablain.github.io/wow-classic-survey/
---
Classic with 144 FPS and 15 ping is going to niiiice
---
You must tell me where you got those flags
---
Quite surprised! Thought it would be significantly more. Well you have a great eye for setting up gaming stations then! I‚Äôll note some of the prices of these and hopefully I can work towards a better set up in the future! Thanks man!
---
Most people who play osrs have at least 2 accounts, it‚Äôs very common to play 2 at once because of how non click intensive most of the game is. Jagex actually allows people to multi log as well.
---
It‚Äôs also wide screen and pretty good quality graphics. Not sure that‚Äôs a solid indication that it is newer, maybe just my setup was really bad.
---
Happy to provide links for you if you needed :) See you in Azeroth!
---
I love how people are pointing out that this might be 2.0 patch.
---
But that's the amazing part if you think about it. The current state of WoW is play the patch. Back then it was play the world. 
---
People were still doing MC runs even on 2.0 
---
Nobody will be doing the first raid (Uldir) anymore on BFA. Not even for transmog because the sets look fucking terrible.
---
Humor me then. What is the purpose of your comment if I am wrong?
---
Bubble=surrender
---
If you‚Äôre willing to when you have a few moments I‚Äôd gladly take a some links. The monitors just look too good! No rush. Thanks my friend :)

Thanks for the quick reply!

Agreed!

I love this idea

I ran it for sure... so... many... times... tanking Princess Fat Ass over and over again.

if it makes you feel any better, your set-up is much more #nochanges than all the set-ups posted around the sub lately ;)

you got one of them CRTs at 1024x768?

40 man raid. 2 tanks.
---
Split that in to groups for 5 man dungeons and the maths just doesn't work, so if you want to raid, don't be a tank unless you've got good backing.

This is from the currently most populated private server.
---
Naxx was released about a week ago and groups are forming to farm trash mobs for epics like the dagger OP just received.
---
How few of servers do you think they‚Äôre going to have in each region? I think you‚Äôre underestimating how many people are going to be playing. I‚Äôm also not sure if you understand how small an individual server population size is. Having one in each region would not make much of an impact. Also do you think everyone who is going to be playing classic is on this subreddit or on the wow forums and even knows there‚Äôs a petition? Most of my friends just assumed there would be an rp-pvp server at launch until I told them. There‚Äôs no point in arguing with you though. I guess we‚Äôll just wait and see. And in the mean time we will keep petitioning blizz.
---
Do you stream at all?
---
The map is amazing but I think it says ‚ÄòAralhi Highlands‚Äô instead of ‚ÄòArathi Highlands‚Äô... :/
---
this is classic sub, take that elsewhere
---
My school ends in September so that would be pretty great.
---
As a healer, I find it easier to use clique addon to mouse click + keyboard press over unit frames. Also, it doesn't hurt to have a UI addon that shows a grid of the raid and their HP/Mana with healing predictions. Overhealing is a waste of mana.
---
Horde in general is full of bloodthirsty murderers. We need soldiers on alliance willing to take them on. I for one will be helping everyone I can against these despicable greenskins.
---
Classic when?
---
I bet people are even giving it away if someone bothers to pick it up.
---
I'm expecting it to launch about 1 or 2am my time, so I'll go to bed like 4 in the afternoon, wake up at midnight, and when it launches I'll just play til I'm tired again. Sleep for however long I need to which could verywell be 10-12 hours, then get up and do it again.
---
I may find that my excitement now does not match with my excitement after actually playing it again, but we'll see what happens.
---
My pc just died 3 weeks ago, gpu failure but I was already having a ton of hard drive or memory issues. It was a 7 year old machine that served me well. I don‚Äôt have an income currently so no classic for me anytime soon. (Not a begging post or request for help, it is what it is)
---
That said it‚Äôs been really cool to see people setting up for their battlestations in anticipation of classic. Crafting a special place where they plan to experience a new adventure in a familiar world. Whether you‚Äôre playing on a water cooled, RGB monster of a gaming pc with 3 ultra-wides or on a 4 year old laptop while sitting in a folding metal chair you are still a citizen of Azeroth. Plus, all the hardware in the world won‚Äôt save anyone in STV.
---
plus mining mats will prob raise in price come phase 3

Having used both, I'd have to error on the side of 1440p, myself. :)

---
i wonder if yall cleaned your desks before posting to this sub or youre authentically anal retentive. my desk is the physical manifestation of clutter.
---
On retail yes. On Classic it means you have to go back to a capital to find someone with most likely no tp back to the dungeon.
---
This is true, but when I played Alliance, I didn't care even a little bit if I saw a gnome in the distance getting killed.  
---
I did feel differently on horde.
---
Nice setup.....horde scum.

Hover over the contact info symbol shows you their contact info, clicking it copies the info to your clipboard. If that doesn't work, it might be your browser. What are you using? Best to use are chrome or mozilla.

Carpet floor. I'm Asian/European and I've only ever seen houses with wooden or stone floors. :O what do you do if you spill a drink on it??? Can you pick the carpet up to clean it? Is there stone underneath? A bit off topic but I have so many questions.
---
Ah I see, hopefully you two will be playing together then? :p
---
Thanks! Yeah that‚Äôs where an AIO radiator is meant to exhaust hot air but until I get one I‚Äôm pushing air out on that side with two 140mm fans.
---
I want to get an NZXT Kraken and that‚Äôs where the rad will go, with the rad fans pushing it out the side. There‚Äôs room room for 3x140mm on the top, one of those is there now but those two will be up there soon (hopefully before Classic launches!)
---
I guess OP never specified, but this is has private server written all over it. Would be really weird to censor guild name/members otherwise.
---
Shamans are usually very offensive with purge, shocks, totems etc. Priests on horde tend to be more defensive and fill the "pocket healer" - role Paladins have.
---
Priests on ally side are in turn more offensive since they are the only ones with a offensive dispell.
---
If you're good.. Check out Maydie and Swifty!
---
You be better off just casually spending a couple days leveling a hunter to 20 for aspect of the cheeta.
---
As far as streamers, Asmongold would be a hot choice. I guess Esfand would have been a better choice but he has drama surrounding him at the moment. StaySafe I think is a more popular streamer, but tips also does youtube so he might hit a wider audience.
---
Love the desk! Had the same ikea desk in white for a few years before I moved. Miss that guy
---
He could also have been told by blizzard not to say anything directly. No one knows. Take it with a grain of salt I'd say.
---
Do you know how those classes play in those respective roles, and if you do which one do you prefer more? I would choose that.
---
Got a cardboard standee when BFA came out. Gutted it and just took what I wanted :D
---
I‚Äôm still building the room my set up will go in -.-
---
Nah
---
 Bro I‚Äôll send you 10$ go to goodwill and get a desk lol
---
To my memory enhancements werent really viable for pve. I only remember one guild that brought one and it "happened" to be the guild leader. In his defence, he did outgear everyone and he was using some weapon that reduced resistances on the boss or something.
---
All in all, its more like a niche thing and youre probably expected to play resto most of the time(which isnt that big of a deal since hybrid classes usually have multiple gear sets anyway)
---
Good luck
---
Iv got my bucket ready
---
Doesn‚Äôt tuxedo require level 30?
---
Hey! At least in the world of Azeroth we'll all be on equal ground. No one will judge you for playing on a toaster, and no one will care if you have a diamond keyboard! That's the beauty of it.
---
The very last one I put in with 25 secs to spare lol.
---
I played Vanilla for 1 month before BC came out and spent most of my time in BC. From what I remember Alliance were just like Horde when it came to saving their buddies in trouble. At the same time though I remember Alliance players not as willing to raid contested Horde zones, while on the other hand I remember at all times Horde in Redridge, Duskwood, etc. Alliance players always seemed more dedicated to leveling rather than goofing around hunting Horde players. The few times I did play Horde there seemed like a collective joy in ruining Alliance players day. That was just my experience though, I'm sure others had a different experience.
---
Right on brother! NOCHANGES
---
Have seen practically every profession under the sun playing WoW. Where have you been?
---
We need more of these. I want to see this devolve into the armpit of gaming conditions
---
Pretty cool setup!
---
i waited until a sale came around for 1440p at 27", 144hz+, but I would have also been happy with 1080p at 24". Pixel density is a luxury
---
A lot of what most people say about vanilla is wrong. For most people it's "I remember it x way" but as we figured out from the demo, even if most people think it was some way, it still may not be.
---
Ihu
---
Perplexity is a fantastic rogue who just put out another pvp vid on YouTube a few weeks ago. Rogues are of course synonymous with vanilla pvp, but he shows you how the class can be taken to another level.
---
I'm going to be honest with you... you need more red.
---
may 20
---
That is so cool
---
So it must not work on mobile then. Thank you!
---
A genuine mistake on my part
---
From what I've seen, both of the classes gameplay seems interesting, but I did not have the chance to play vanilla, this is why I need your experience, even if it is your own opinion ;)
---
Upset?
---
Dude stop projecting your insecurities and downplaying your viewpoint as "poking people with weird views"...
---
You are seriously butthurt that I used logic to flip the conversation in a way you couldn't defend against it....and seeing as how you obviously think you're intelligent.... you're now resorting to deflecting.

I bought a sit/stand adjustable desk for fear of this. I plan on doing maybe 24 hours day one and then 16 hour days after that, and the whole time I'll be switching back and forth from sit/stand whenever one starts to feel uncomfortable.
---
A man of culture
---
His channel is based on classic hype. He's probably just trying to cash in on it while he can. He probably doesn't care if he isn't invited again if Classic is gonna release soon as by then it'll be released and the hype train will be over.
---
Honestly I don't understand the appeal of taking things slow. I am planning on rushing it as fast as I can non-stop, skipping all the quest text and enjoying the speed. That said I have no friends so that's probably why I'm like this.
---
Upgrade to level 10 rogue for sprint?
---
There wasn‚Äôt much advertising when vanilla came out, it slowly built up.
---
why not just play like 12 hours or something then go 36 the next? you wont see the hardcores that go 36 hours with that plan. But the hardcores are the least of your worries for competition. Its the pack of players clogging up westfall , redridge duskwood etc. The hardcores usually dont bother with ganking, as they know its generally a bad idea to do so since the resources of mobs and quest items are abundant with little competition. And theres less of a purpose to create enemies in that environment. Either way, good luck with whatever plan you go, itll be fun regardless ofc
---
We're more likely to see them drop 8.2 the week or two before. (which will be about 90 days after 8.1.5 which was about 90 days after 8.1.0)
---
why not rogue for sprint
---
Bankthetank?
---
I agree 
---
Just get some THC in your system and you won‚Äôt even care 
---
You‚Äôll be in Azeroth enjoying the grind 
---
I don‚Äôt even have a Laptop/Computer and I‚Äôm hyped AF
---
I agree. My guild in wrath loved doin nax
---
Should be fun getting to play the real game for once!
---
Let's go through the current content creators. Asmongold is too anti-PC to be officially associated with Blizzard. Esfand has too much drama surrounding him right now. Staysafe doesn't do youtube. Tips is probably the next popular content creator that doesn't have any drama surrounding him, is PC, and does both twitch and youtube.
---
I'm going to assume there will be server issues for the first day, there so frequently is.
---
Is this a prison cell
---
Horde: Rich and diverse ensemble of unique and aesthetically interesting races with tusks and fur and bones falling out
---
Alliance: Human, short human, shorter human, purple human
---
this is true
---
It does in most cases, but yeah, best to check on desktop.
---
Its too bad Draenai and Worgen werent Horde
---
That's good news. I'm glad they won't be forcing us to download 60 GB of crap we don't need from later expansions.
---
You wash your hands? Filthy casual
---
0w0 what's this???
---
We don't even know if there IS an NDA. We're all just imagining something and getting angry over it.
---
95% sure this is a private server picture
---
Well, all the best to you. Nobody knows how many players might play and stay on an rp-pvp server. Nobody even knows yet how many servers there will be. I think Classic will be pretty big, and I think Blizzard has to figure out the best way to be able to have the right amount of servers. Otherwise, you're looking at later transfers, people having to change names, and all that, which is great in retail but not really what Classic is about, nor I don't think they even started with rp-pvp servers. Most of us are just looking for as close as an authentic experience as possible. If there's room for every kind of server, fine, that's great. I think Blizz may just cautious due to actual numbers of people rather than "I have five friends who want to play on a pvp-rp server".
---
I don't think your wrong, but you could say that about them all cause they're all humanoid
---
Horde: Green human, Dead human, Blue human, and also Cow
---
S
---
Yeah I played a feral druid on satellite internet from the time I started playing (around 2008) to 2011.  Can confirm, died in a lot of fires in WotLK.
---
I have a laptop on one of those plastic card tables and a shitty wooden chair , none of that matters cause we'll be in the same game :D
---
Still better than playing filthy console games.
---
Still the missing FPs version though. Can nobody fix this?
---
Good thing it‚Äôs legal here :)
---
This meme will never get old.
---
you poor
---
Yeah I cleaned it my shit is a mess 80% of the time.
---
Those who say dbm Is mandatory, come on... I think we can see the whole 2 ability most boss have without a red flashing message in middle of the screen+ loud voice telling you to move
---
Do you have any thrift stores nearby? I got a comfy computer chair for $25, a couch for $40, and i've gotten a few other things on the cheap. I know it isn't available to everyone but I figured I'd make the suggestion.
---
Only monocles i can find on classicdb are like high 40s, low 50s.  At that point it's just an alt
---
Learn skinning at Razor Hill and skip going to Org all together
---
Tailering and echanting for my mage (pve)
---
As someone else stated in another part of this thread. Even in Retail where every tank is a viable tank and you got many classes to choose from, people still barely play tank.
---
I personally get waaaay to anxious to be expected to know where to go and lead the group. I don't like giving orders and when you think of Tanks as Leaders and the rest as Followers it makes a lot more sense why there aren't a lot of them. Most people are followers by nature. Not everyone feels fit to Lead.
---
Imo depends on how much original content they really create. I'm fine with channels like Frostadamus who produce unique materials and aren't just following the same cookie-cutter formula of "easy-money videos". I genuinely enjoy letting his videos play on the background.
---
Exactly 
---
And if you don‚Äôt smoke or just don‚Äôt want too 
---
Buy some THC [Syrup ](https://wm-mmjmenu-images-production.s3.amazonaws.com/menu_items/images/1844882/medium/5245497_cannalean_muffin_tech.jpg?1496220904) unlike weed you can drink one chug of this and you‚Äôll be high from 8 am to 10 pm 
---
Perfect for a day of Raiding/Leveling 
---
And it‚Äôs cheaper for what it does
---
Is it weird that I want to see a picture of it?
---
Get everyone to ask their guild or just jump out of the instance and ask in the local chat.
---
My bank alt will be a human rogue. Ill train her in enchanting, leather working, and lock picking. Ill eventually level her up to 20 so she can train lock picking up to 225 so she can unlock all my lockboxes from my mains farming. Enchanting obviously to d/e greens and stuff. LW to use excess leather to make crap to vendor for extra gold.
---
I didn't even have an option for wow beta on my profile. All other bliz titles were there but not wow.
---
It's on a private
---
racecar chair, more monitors than necessary, razer products, I mean....pretty normal to me 5/10 :^)
---
Nice setup. Now show us your wife/gfs half of the room :)
---
These gaming stations are great, but not required.
---
When I was younger I had a lazyboi reclining chair and a large monitor, was awesome for raiding and playing long hrs.
---
But I am 45 now, with wife, kids and a demanding job. 
---
I‚Äôm spending about ¬£2k on a good gaming laptop with large screen, for classic as I haven‚Äôt played since 2012. 
---
I need to be ‚Äúmobile‚Äù,  Cos I work away. Need to be able to play from the sofa Cos the wife wouldn‚Äôt accept me playing 2-3hrs in the bedroom on a desktop. 
---
So it doesn‚Äôt matter what you play on, just about having fun once classic is released.
---
It‚Äôs in a constant state of ‚Äútornado just came through‚Äù
---
I think all this doubt of people not playing certain specs is really bumming me out
---
So I think I'll just try to get voted guild "president" cuz I don't need to be the Master and as long as we're getting through what we need to any spec is welcome. Do not count on me for organizing anything because that's not what I'm good at. You need someone fair and objective.... I'm usually your guy
---
Hey, I have to play on my little bar-top in my kitchen on a laptop. Just because everyone on this sub posts their weeboo/bachelor den, it doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt have a great time.

I had to make the same exact decision.  A large majority of my experience in WoW was on a priest.  2400 arena and all that jazz. Ended up picking R shammy for classic though. I played it on a few private servers and just really enjoyed the playstyle, especially with friends. 10/10 would recommend
---
Crowd pummelers are only for feral dps. You run armor weapons for bear tanking
---
Yeah also Blessing of Freedom on Warriors is huge in skirmishes, probably the best PvP combination in the game.
---
Is 3 monitor even useful ?
---
(the pioneers used to ride these babies for miles)
---
Why aren't Macs for gaming? There are all kinds of great games available for OSX.
---
Engineering.
---
That's okay for that price. I wouldn't personally get it because the resolution is only 1080p and it's a TN display.
---
r/buildapcsales routinely has great monitor deals, if you're in the market for one I'd check them out
---
I'll raise you one, even though it's TBC.
---

Warrior of course.

---
That sweet, sweet mould painting the lungs black.
---
She's a keeper
---
You will need them no matter what. A feral Druid isn't there for just tanking or just DPS, you gotta do both depending on the encounter.
---
It's likely. They're becoming more "meta" to bring one to a raid on Alliance.
---
Well, "summer" and "Q3" cover almost the same dates in the calendar. When Actiblizz announces a summer release you can read it has "late August/first half of September".
---
I hope to god there isnt, that would really kill the hype. But even then, we will both hit 60 eventually haha
---
While levelling I'd probably go with any class that has good DPS/buffs if you want as many invites as possible. Honestly Hunter/Druid/Mage are all so welcomed imo due to how often tagging is required. 
---
For dungeons obviously a competent Tank is the Nr1 asset that everyone wants some of. Healers are good too, though maybe not a Druid healer unless you have a hybrid with Res. So any Healer but Druid if you want a lot of Dungeon invites. 
---
As for Raiding, healers and casters usually. People argue for Hunters but you need like 2-3 in a raid and they are overplayed for how few you actually need. For Raids, Druid/Shaman/Pally/Warlock are what I remember being the hardest to fill.
---
The other day in SM arms: me, a lvl 36 warrior tank having issues hitting mobs at times, him, a lvl 42 warlock, precasting shadow bolt on pulls for maximum dps, keeping on attacking the mob that wasn‚Äôt being focused. Fun times. Never been quite so rage starved and struggling to keep threat
---
You can also tell by the iphone ;)
---
Go to bed, Asmongold.
---
Staysafe still usually keeps a good 500-1000 viewers even when Asmon is streaming.
---
There is a 2 gig memory minimum requirement on the specs to run WoW. But that‚Äôs alright, the memories of this baby should be more than enough.
---
I‚Äôm going 7 days straight. No naps. Amphetamines.
---
Well I think its time for you to check their previous releases. When classic is announced for summer, wc3 is obv gonna be late q4. Stocks over customers mare.
---
Say hello to the shadow people to me. Sinister little bastards
---
I'm left handed and use the mouse right handed. Just have to teach yourself.
---
...undead?
---
Eh, I‚Äôm not advocating for people to level as sub, but combat just feels awful for pvp after playing sub. It‚Äôs not even close. A sub rogue in bwl gear should beat a combat rogue in aq40 gear handily.
---
I find that dude too boring, I mean they are all getting a house with asmon, probably because they know there all hanging on by his dick.
---
Also asmon has been playing eso and just doing commentary videos. 
---
We‚Äôre all just getting by watching anything about classic, doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs good.
---
Then you have not been blessed with Gorak's Guide to Classic.
---
I rofl every time I watch it:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9l88qaitts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9l88qaitts)
---
I'm guessing Sir Mittens and Sir Mittens 2 were not dismissed before dropping off a ledge.
---
That'll for sure be different, I think my current monitor costs more than my entire rig did back in the day.
---
doing differing amounts of dps doesnt make one viable and the other not. Optimal would be the word you are looking for.
---
The crusty crab pizza is the pizza for you and me
---
I decided to roll a warrior for classic and see what happens. I enjoy tanking dungeons and might keep doing that max level depending on what the guild needs. I used to heal full time, so I think it might be a nice change of pace. If a tank isn‚Äôt needed I‚Äôll just roll dps
---
I don't think so. I watch Asmongold. I found his channel like 3-4 months ago I think. 
---
I don't play BfA. I haven't played since the first week of Cata. I have no idea whats going on in the game when he plays. The numbers are huge, there are races I don't recognize. Orcs can be mages, I don't know what a Demon Hunter or Monk even do, and I don't care to learn.
---
I watch his stream cause he's funny and likable. I have to imagine, that most people aren't watching his stream for sick WoW content. I think the people that watch other WoW streamers either like those streamers more, or they do provide some kind of sick WoW content, idk i don't watch em.
---
Everyone is going to be streaming Classic WoW. At least for a bit, I'm sure Asmon will stick with it, but you're going to see big names playing it too. At least for the first day or two anyway. 
---
Now that I think about it, when Classic arrives its going to be weird to see Asmon play WoW and me actually giving a shit what is happening in his game.
---
I'm glad you chose gaming as your basement hobbie
---
You should consider doing a longer first and then doing 16 hour sessions! Gets you even better distance away from the pack and 16 hours a day is pretty much guaranteed to keep you ahead.
---
Keep in mind, mail to your alt is gonna probably take an hour
---
https://youtu.be/HEUShQeCA10
---
Robe of the Archmage and later the Bloodvine set are some of the best items a mage can get, so tailoring is a very good idea.
---
People recommend skinning as you're leveling up so you can vendor the skins for extra cash, as well as being able to have mining or alchemy along with it. The thing about skinning with a mage though is every second you spend skinning is a second you aren't drinking water to regen mana which you're going to be doing a LOT of as a mageso you gotta ask yourself if that's worth it.
---
Engineering goes incredible with mage of you're planning on pvping. Being able to rocket helm somebody and sheep another turns a 3v1 into a 1v1
---
If you're planning on rushing to 60 grab skinning and Herbalism/mining, but if you're going to take your time I'd pick herbs/mining and the crafting profession of your choice.
---
Yeah, the race will happen, but then the grind will set in as well.  There are limits to human endurance.
---
Looks like they are selling it for 500 bucks, that's too much for me I think, I'm so glad I bought the horde one :)
---
The glowing shit is just LED strips. For $6 you can also make 16 or so inches glow. 
---
The extra monitors literally just make it so you don't have to tab out to look up stats and you can watch Netflix or something. I've never had a second monitor because I'm weird and prefer minimalist set up, small desk, space conserved, etc.
---
Point is your not missing out on much dude. None of this stuff makes them enjoy the game anymore than anyone else, not really. Just sit back with your fairly modern laptop, and slay some Alliance scum.
---
Not sure the appeal behind streamers. If it‚Äôs a game I have never played before it‚Äôs fun to see it through their perspective, but after it‚Äôs really boring.
---
You still use pummelers as a feral tank
---
Cant be a slacker and skip those noggenfoggers!
---
Orc is strong, but I think I prefer Undead as a Horde race for Rogues. Classes that can stun absolutely destroy Rogues. Resisting a Warrior's Charge is not going to win the fight for you. If he was able to Charge you at all, then you're at a disadvantage and you need to reset the fight or run away. Paladins &amp; Druids have relatively long cooldowns on their stuns so they know not to waste their stuns on Orcs. They don't need stuns to beat you, anyway.
---
On the other hand, the Undead racial doubles down on your strength: murdering Warlocks and Priests.
---
Love this
---
Ty Soo much!
---
So for a couple more days? ;)
---
My setup back in vanilla was a piece of plywood laid across 2 dog cages with a space in the middle for my legs. And i had a wooden chair with no padding. Try sitting in a wooden chair for 6+ hours a day... my dogs were more comfortable in their cages/beds with blankets.
---
Just throw down a Tranquil Air Totem/Salvation to drop agro and continue playing.
---
No worries, I'm using a 2015 apple macbook. I play in my kitchen since it has the best connection.
---
That‚Äôs a low amount of consumes for Naxx tbh.
---
It's happening, its happening
---
NO CHANGES
---
you get that 60hz CRT monitor out of the garage and throttle your internet connection until you have 300 ping
---
I'll be rolling horde 100% no idea about meta
---
gl keeping aggro without pummelers
---
Pretty toxic in here, ugh...
---
Theres a specific classic Patchwerk video that stands out to me because I believe its from a pretty good guild. The mages are all frost and mostly wearing full Netherwind. Goes to show why Naxx was so much harder back then lmao.
---
You and I are just old people.
---
I just realized that I'm going to have to figure out a UI setup before Classic comes out. I don't want to have to fiddle with it much while leveling ):
---
You could, but comparatively Horde is clearly more aesthetically unique
---
yikes.
---
Get a mage to aoe boost you to 20 in a couple of hours.
---
easier to play between a mage and warlock is the warlock because you have pets that help you level much easier, but both pretty easy.
---
to raid, Mage would be easier honestly. they are both great classes. they both level quite quickly also. consider Hunter also for easy leveling
---
H
---
Dude what's that screensaver???
---
finally a worthy setup! not one of the $3000 setups someone got from their divorced parents to play fortnite we see here posted hourly
---
This really needs to be pinned. Great stuff.
---
FINE I WILL TANK IT MYSELF
---
every gm prolly.
---
I think every GM I've had has been a tank.
---
Yeah, but unlike when a DPS fucks up, when a Tank fucks up everyone knows its his fault. No one blames him because he's valuable and sometimes people are known to just fuck off if they're feelings get bruised.
---
But everyone knows when the tank fucked up a pull or wasn't facing the boss where he was supposed to, or whatever it is. Its impossible to hide a Tank fuck up.
---
It‚Äôs based on 1.12 and there were rp-pvp servers by 1.12. As close as authentic as possible right? Guess we for sure need them.
---
There is no skinning trainer at Razor Hill...
---
ya maybe people are thinking it was an insult im not sure either haha
---
You got the Harmen Kardon soundsticks too!
---
Uh where is the dog?
---
Yeah, I still think thats questionable design choice, but it is what it  is. A lot of Druids and Fury Warriors having to bust out there tank sets if no you can't poach enough tanks.
---
They were cool with mages, but they probably didn't want us googling occult stuff at 10 years old. :P

This is like the dad joke of memes in this subreddit.
---
&gt; I also have a secondary question: It is possible to heal dungeons before-60 with leveling-dps/hybric builds?
---
Druids excel at this. Keep some int in your bags and you'll have zero issues healing dungeons (only issue is your long ress CD but with the right party setup that's irrelevant of course) while leveling very rapidly as Feral who are amazing at it.
---
The crappier the setup the more you'll probably be able to play, which matters more than anything. I've seen some really nice setups in pricey looking homes, they won't be playing nearly as much as we'll be able to, guaranteed! :)
---
One of us! I hate shift+stuff. Currently using `/~ as an ability, and f1-f4
---
I was 16 when Wow dropped. I am 30 now.
---
Oddly enough have more time to play now then back then because parents put hard limits on it. 
---
Also work from home and have been pre-powering through projects so I can just respond to e-mails during that time.
---
Go on gumtree or freecycle or Facebook marketplace etc you‚Äôd get a 2nd hand desk for like almost nothing
---
Roastme subreddit isn't here
---
a gym ball for a chair will help more
---
What desk is that? It's exactly what I've been looking for.
---
I'm with you. Granted, I started playing vanilla around EU launch after having been a WC3 Night Elf main so there's a lot of bias, but I love the zone. Back then I leveled every class to 10 there first. 
---
Sure, some places (like the Barrow Den from Hell) are horrible and it's definitely not the quickest leveling zone, but the aesthetics, fantastic soundtrack and exploration potential (if you're new - like finding the Satyr on the big branch at the edge of the world) are A+.
---
Level 40 mage for portals.
---
Must be rolling pally
---
I think it‚Äôs more about self-selection. Horde (IMO) have much better racials for PvP and so people wanting to PvP are more likely to select horde.
---
I think Alliance are just as likely to help, but because of the above, are less likely to instigate and so it seems like they care less.
---
31/0/31 will have you level 71
---
SP gets oom very fast, faster then the shaman
---
melee dungeon runs will be much faster then spellcasters
---
Literally all your points are anecdotal and personal to you. Spoken like someone who has never operated under stress before, and taken stimulants to help.
---
A 40 hour session is no problem.
---
I've always wanted just a straight up ffa server. Horde and Alliance can talk to each other and kill each other anywhere but very early starting zones and in towns. It was done on DAoC and that was probably the most fun I've ever had in an mmo.
---
We would all benefit idf you would delete your karma farming useless post.
---
Same here, i was so excited when i first cleared bwl and before that MC and i got my first real dagger ( Perditions Blade)
---
Just excited to have actual PVE servers. I have never once ganked in my entire life and so not losing 30 minutes to an hour every couple of days to ganking and the like will be nice.
---
Hate it when that happens
---
Looks like shit.  Who cares about who has more money to buy more monitors and some banners?
---
Lol
---
vid doesn't exist
---
Is Runda not in Vanilla?
---
Had a picture frame laying around. Used hot glue to position the CDs in place. Simple!
---
Point of note, you're hovering between Alliance and Horde. Pick that first? Presumably it's true to vanilla, so you're faction-locked per server. Who cares about the races on the other end then! 
---
That could make it easier to decide.
---

no it wont in classic they addressed that this wont be in classic

Nah, Diablo Immortal is coming out. Hard to watch tv and play on your phone without missing stuff.

Not much trying involved if you plan your meals ahead of time and count the calories

Got the equivalent of that in front of the dog food box.

You sure about that? Check the blizzcon panel and listen closely to what he says

Oddly enough it‚Äôs between paly or Druid right now.
---
Nah I‚Äôm just retard when it comes English and spelling.
---
I had that exact desk, I hated it cause it was too small for multiple monitors and the glass showed everything, could never keep it clean.  
---
    
---
Managed to sell it for $50 and used that money to build myself a new desk.  
---
Much happier with the new setup (pls ignore cable management)

&gt; My Fear is that most everything in the Barrens will be too high level to skin, and I will be stuck either back-tracking into Durotar or grinding out the few beasts I can actually skin to catch up.
---
There's those huge packs of neutral level 5 gazelle critters that roam the barrens that are perfect for this
---
Shaman. When in doubt throw some lightning bolts and feel like Zeus. But really they are the coolest class in the game from a lore perspective, and offer a variety of  ways to play, it almost feels as if you're en entirely new class when switching specs. And for the love of all that is classic wow, try 2Hand windfury for pvp(or go watch some videos for the lols). As an Alliance main I approve this message whole heartedly, when TBC released I was gobsmacked at his much fun the class was.

Pre-nerf heroic Grim Batol XD we still bear the scars to this day

Im quite curious what Classic WoW UI design is going to look like. There's a whole bunch of people that will be going the modern ElvUI-esque look, or some lite version of that, and then there's this big group of people that may come back and try to recreate some older UI design philosophies. Remember the era of your lower screen being a giant black rectangle with all your bars in it? Or the era where the mana and health bars were giant curved lines that sat in the center of the screen around the character model?
---
WoW UIs are fucking fascinating to me.
---
Personally I hated the stronghold quest design, especially with how professions were handled.  Other mmos automate the process too, which just has so many ripples of negativity across the game.  The economy feels artificial, less player interaction since you don't have to go to nodes, nevermind the fact that you don't even have to play the game.
---
I'll probably go for tail &amp; herb/mining at the start. Once I paid for epic mount I'll switch to engineering or alchemy.
---
It‚Äôs been a long time since I played it, I remember the only time people would have more than one account was when they had pures for pvp
---
idd say 1 or 2 months after 8.2 release
---
Please don't make baseless assumptions. It's really not a good look.

I Level as undead shadow priest to level 10 then i will push skinning to 50-70 with the mobs in front of orgrimma. This cost time because of full bags and because i must run to skinning teacher.

After this i am ready for game.

---
shaman is more offensive healer
---
Rogues and Druids are really similar. A lot of the skill comes from knowing when and where to leave stealth. You also have to know when to run and when to fight. I think Druids are more complicated because they just flat out have more abilities, but Rogues are right up there with them.
---
You may think that's mold.
---
You're wrong.
---
I wish you weren't.
---
i got 1 word for you and it will answer all your leveling questions
---
"Joana"
---
Staring with the easiest part; do you prefer or care at all about healing or DPS in raids? Mage and Warlock will of course do DPS, a very repetitive "rotation" granted. Druids and Priests will be healing unless you're the lucky 1 shadow priest but I wouldn't count on that unless you have a raid premade. If you care about that, that'll ease things. 
---
Open world PvP you can't go wrong with any of these. If you're a competent player, these classes will all be amazing. Druid is the most unique in that it forces you to focus on outlasting an opponent rather than bursting in most scenarios, you'll be "stance dancing" (forms) a lot. Stealth is also wonderful for open world PvP, for obvious reasons. Massive difference. Keep in mind for something like premade WSG they're usually relegated to flag carrier which is a very divisive playstyle. Mages are the most straightforward and easiest to do good with. Warlocks and (Shadow) Priests will present a ton of difficulty for most classes at endgame in open world PvP. 
---
For leveling I'd say Druids have it easiest. Warlocks are incredibly strong for questing, but lack mobility. Druids can quest solo very efficiently, have virtually no downtime, have some of the best mobility in the game and regardless of your spec you can heal, DPS or tank in dungeons up to 60 with no issue. Mages have a ton of downtime, constantly drinking. Priests are probably the slowest in general. Then again if you're rolling with a group of people this won't matter as much. 
---
&gt; I have played Priest before (during all of MoP) and really enjoyed the class. I know how useful they will be in Classic and it never hurts to have more, knowledgeable Priests whenever you are pursuing any kind of content. Biggest drawback is that I've played the class before, do I want to do that again?
---
Honestly, I don't think you can really remotely compare vanilla Priest with MoP Priest so I wouldn't worry too much about that factor. 
---
&gt; I will likely be spending most of my time in world with a Warrior.
---
Assuming you're mostly hanging out together with no one else, Druid or Priest will fit the best there. Warriors really struggle in open world (PvP) while leveling, but heals make a world of difference. Mage is probably second best there due to their CC allowing warriors to catch up.
---
But it was so satisfying if people really nailed the dragon bomb run.
---
"Shadowmurder"...that right here gentlemen, is a classic Rogue name =)
---
Off topic slightly.... Am I the only one who looks at this pic and thinks it's a live in game shot? Do any of these vanilla wow screenshots look like they are moving to anyone else? Have I just played this game too long and my brain is just filling it in? (15 years and counting /fml)
---
I'm no mold expert. I just thought the big waterstains might hold some moldy magic in there.
---
Most people on retail aren't long term WoW vets anymore. They aren't the target audience.  So i imagine you are right and the cross over won't be huge except for early on.
---
If that is the case, I will probably skip the whole rush to a Greater Magic Wand. Might not be worth the money and time.
---
Well, I s'pose you could call it the magic of life...
---
I was going to blast you for not listening to the [panel],(https://youtu.be/hhKkP8LryYM?t=2286) but Ion actually lets slip that mail from/to an alt takes an hour. 
---
Ion is mistaken. Mail sent to a character on the same account (and obviously on the same realm) is instant. 
---
It is my assumption that all mail is instant in BfA, which is why the "controversy" presented in the panel was born.
---
i thougt about this question alot because i wanted to play warlock, shaman or priest so let me give you some input.
---
Shaman: 
---
\- has a higher skill floor and ceiling if you play him right he is allmost as good as Spriest in every situation. But he needs more "stuff" to work, meaing engi / world items, but he scales very well with them.
---
\- has super easy access to gear your t1,t2,t2,5 has alot of pices with spelldmg on it so its kinda easy to get gear.
---
\- dos cap out lower, if you really min max your gear, meaing doing rank 14 trying to get BiS shamans list is kinda lacking.
---
\- is often used as a DD in premate groups, thats super cool cause you can play your solo specc in group pvp.
---
\- you can raid as 30/0/21 ele in "low end" raids and just heal with this so you dont need to respecc this often.
---
\- i was told shamans are super wanted in raids, and its super easy to get a raid spot, even compare to priest.
---
\- totems are not this painfull imo, its more like spells.
---
\- can heal decent in pvp specc, so if you are in a 2man group or something you can easly switch between healing and dmg, mana will be a issue but you still have more mana to work with then a shadowpriest.
---
\- can play enc shaman if you get lucky with gear or put effort in, sure its a meme specc and super bad but atleast you have 2 dds speccs.
---
Priest:
---
\- super easy to play, i have played alot of priests over the years the best sentence to describe a priest is "A class for noobs to kill noobs" atleast as shadow.
---
\- some classes played by good players will just walk over you, while shadow allmost stomps every class played abit wrong, i has absolut 0 chance against some classes played right.
---
\- allmost allways plays disc in priemates.
---
\- extrem hard to gear, access to raid gear is very hard and raid gear is very bad for shadow pvp, you need stamina as a shadowpriest. You basicly need to have rank 10 to compare to up to bwl ppl, and rank 13 to even have fighting chance against aq40 and naxx gear, or sometimes even good bwl gear.
---
\- some player still think shadow is an super op monster, so you often wont get credit if you win a fight. Or they will tell you, you dont need the gear i just said to perform, belive me against half decent ppl you need every point stamina you can get.
---
\- scales kinda bad with engi/world items, like all classes with dots, that like "long" fights utility items are not your strong site, you dont have a slow that sticks that makes it hard to hit nates. Your dots will break cc like rocket helm.
---
Sure they have uses here and there but its abit limited.
---
\- shadowpriest is allmost usless in group fights, your mana is to limited, you hate despells, and your burst dmg is super low.
---
\- feels super tanky against noobs, but that has a flip site, against good ppl or ppl that outgear you its a class that can feel super helpless, you just dont have the tools not not facetank dmg.
---
\- PvE healer gear is bad for pvp healing  too...so meh.
---
tl:dr :
---
Play shadow if you are not confident in your skill and have atleast some idea how to get your gear, if you have the time for rank 13/14 priest is a very good pick too.
---
Play shaman if you are more casual, it has easy to get ele gear even spelldmg 1h maces shouldnt be this big of a problem. You have alot of things to show "skill" to overcome situations, and it scales very well with "cheesy" stuff.
---
&gt;You can do this on live with most projectiles.
---
You don't get it. I listed just a few examples but there are many others. Kicking Warstomp Clones is another good one. And no, you most certainly cannot do this on live: [https://youtu.be/xF4Rx1sQYQU?t=58](https://youtu.be/xF4Rx1sQYQU?t=58)
---
&gt;Slight nerf to improved gouge so there's no inconsistency
---
You're missing the point as to why Blizzard is putting in the effort in the first place, which is no gameplay changes, as well as the much larger picture about batching, see above.
---
&gt;Are you a clicker or something? This just makes no sense.
---

&gt;I‚Äôve been thinking about the concept of heroic or hard modes for Vanilla raids.
---
Congratulation, you burned valuable calories in your brain for nothing.
---
Turn them in and you will be 44 and 75% :)
---
I think if the release date was 06/26 it would of been announced already. That is not too far away
---
The only skinning trainer in Durotar is this [this guy](https://classicdb.ch/?npc=7088) Who resides in Orgrimmar.
---
Time to retire early?
---
No it doesn't, I choose to do that pretty early in my reactors personally to get the clutter out of the way. It feels good to begin like that. Obviously they didn't do it right at the beginning but just saying that's got no obvious connection to far through they are. Not to mention this is the client, there is also the backend that is being worked on in parallel.
---
You only bring 2 hunters for Naxx. And like 6-7 mages. You don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a difference in viability?
---
Is this true?
---
Ehh warrior hard counters rogue, combat you stand a chance but a stunlock? not in my experience
---
stoneclaw puts you in combat and removes stealth?
---
We‚Äôre talking about levelling here. Also, give me an AQ geared combat rogue with stam priority and health enchants, I will mop the floor with any BWL geared sub rogue. Assuming they do not fap, which in case, yes sub would win.
---
It is true that it will not take an hour in Classic but it has never taken an hour so it does not make sense for it to be "addressed".
---
Okay, hopefully someone can do a quick test to make sure in beta.  It was always instant between alts on the private servers i played but wasn't sure if that was a quality of life fix on their end or actually historically correct
---
&gt; https://miro.medium.com/max/594/1*lg8oMoZuGKqO0So7DxENdw.png
---
You know you're on reddit when this bullshit comes out.  You're obviously too smart 4 me ecksdee
---
Look bucko, the only reason you give two shits about spell batching is because it benefits your class the most.  All it does is create inconsistent scenarios where you SOMETIMES come out ahead due to conditions outside of both players control.
---
Click on, hero!
---
It's fine I've heard that fun is just a buzzword anyway
---
I remember being a kid and convincing my father to buy me wow and to pay my sub as my allowance. (In retrospect my monthly allowance was triple the monthly sub, so it was a great deal for him.)
---
Installed it on my NEC desktop with no GPU. Pops had to buy a GPU to run it properly I could not afford a GPU with my savings. He bought me a 6600 GT, best time of my life.
---
Had a night elf arms warrior that I would insist could tank, I was so clueless and never understood why people would get mad at me.
---
Honestly, I have a 3 monitor setup now with 75Hz monitors at 24 inch and it looks so nice. I've been playing Division 2 a ton on this setup and can't wait to play WoW Classic on it.
---
Bank alt will be a hunter. Going to get it to lvl 30 eventually. Aspect of the cheetah and run speed enchant. Will be an enchanter so I can DE stuff
---
5 hours to level 10 
---
2 hours to skill skinning to 50 
---
quests near orgrimmar on the way to crossroads. 
---
Day 2 i planning clear crossroads and ratchet 
---
Day 3 to get all fligh points 
---
Day 4 normal questing and leveling.
---
Week 2 desolace and grind dustwallow for level 40 mount.
---
After this i will see.
---
i think 8-14 hours daily in the first 10 days
---
Rogue has a major advantage to warriors, 1v1 and especially levelling
---
Yup (LET ME INNNNNNN).
---
Not that an old wiki is any authority, but: [Vanilla WoW Wiki](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Mail).
---
We ran 2... Banish 1, fear/VW tank the other.  Why 4?  That's mage/rogue dps slots being taken. Then again, I warlocked early MC with the GD 8 debuff cap.
---
spell batching is trash that only benefits rogues and you'd have to be a total melon to want them to re-implement unresponsiveness into the game so that you can get lucky and gouge blinks
---
the hilariousness of linking the DK effect by someone who *believes* they have figured out one class in 15 years is also spicy
---
Btw this phrase is "err" on the side :)
---
&gt;Click on, hero!
---
Q up, crop
---
The gm stats don't support that.
---
Leeroy Jenkins is a lie! :'(
---
Depends a lot on the gear level, too. Mage has 4k+ health unbuffed? It's tough. If he's barely at 3k? Ambush+Eviscerate is almost enough on its own. Rogues are insane in early vanilla and okay in the end, so the gradient just depends on where you are chronoligically at any given time.
---
Fun devil's advocate, here: the offer goes away on the 11th, and if you buy it just before it's removed, you then have 90 days to activate it. What is 90 days after June 11th, you ask? Why, Monday, September 9th. Could it be that release is on Tuesday, September 10th, just to get around the RAF obligations?
---
Do you have any idea what I should take out to pick up improved sap?
---
If you have only a few items off of BiS and just other decent items in other slots you are more than fine for MC/Ony. If you look at most BiS items, as long as you have a decent item, the stat contributions are similar.
---
Am i the only one that don't care about the beta? I just want the real thing as quick as possible so i can start my character. Everything i play in the beta will be gone anyway and maybe also take away from that magic feeling of playing classic for the first time.
---
Pick a side ffs
---
You want a stealth opener followed immediately by Gouge. They can't get ouf of that. If you simply open with Cheap Shot, they can Blink right away and be fine. If you open with CS/Ambush and instantly Gouge afterwards, you've got 3-4 combo points and cal follow up with Blind+Ambush+Eviscerate or something along those lines.
---
Nice try
---
Yeah easymode
---
*To err is human*
---
Took me way to long to get perds on my rogue back in the day
---
Dont be shy to grind mobs
---
why both faction flags. pick one heretic
---
deffo skinning, always needed + its also needed in the end game
---
Best one yet. Please explain how its a 3,000 year old year old dragon in a childs body and your not a pedophile.
---
Threat meter &gt; damage meter
---
&gt;  leaks some dev addon names 
---
What does this mean?
---
It's clear you've never done the ddr fight or Thaddius with your raid in vanilla. People really need those flashing lights and sirens and even then they'd fail pretty hard.
---
Exactly. And the Orgrila and Skettis quests are not really the same.
---
In reality nobody is ever more effective with less Addons, when you consider Addons like WA or being able to move information into a more central place... Its physically not possible. It's just a preference they have.
---
I take skinning only. but i not shy to grind some mobs.
---
Second profession i will decide until i find some epic pattern 
---
i roll shadow priest
---
So what is Blizz's current stance on personal model changing? Like changing the model of your chars race to a different one on your own setup.
---
Thats the thing about Classic though, doesnt matter if youre rich or poor, we all start at level 1.
---
Obligatory ‚Äúrelease date??‚Äù comment
---
Not that much. Farming consuables shouldn't take more than 3-6 hours per week tops, and then one or two raid sessions of like 4 hours each. Competent guilds clear BWL in one go and then take care of MC+Ony on another night, hardcore guilds can do both in one night, and mediocre guilds might need three nights to clear it all.
---
what are you saying?
---
Judging by retail, that's definitely bannable.
---
Where do I get that map
---
Pvp server? Fishing herb alch. Free action potions and limited invulnerability potions are always going to sell. FAPS are a really low level potion to make, 1 black oil thing and 1 stranglekelp turns into at least a gold per, swiftness potions are swift thistle and briarthorn. Also sell very well. If you're horde just go to northern barrens and pick briarthorn(quilboar), alliance just circle westfall or the south western side of it for briarthorn and stranglekelp.
---
Altering the client and therefore against ToC. If detectable likely to get you punished
---
It's just French for "red."
---
Could you share that confirmation with us?
---
meh i was 8 years old and didnt want to eat because i wanted to keep playing so im very skinny. theres more than one lethargic type of wow player
---
Just curious about one thing - do you think that it's good gameplay where sometimes kicking warstomp cyclones or gouging mage blinks works and sometimes it doesn't, where neither outcome is in your control?  Why exactly is that extra layer of RNG a good thing?  Who is it good for, and why?
---
Personally, I don't care if spell batching is implemented like vanilla or retail.  I have a hard time understanding why someone would take such a serious stance on it other than hardcore nostalgia.
---
is this related? https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/employee-alpha-testing-for-wow-classic/155986

True, then it just comes down to how they learned and if they choose to relearn with add-ons for that added benefit.
---
The only beta i participated in was for Pit People, i had a blast and it only got me even more hyped for the full release!
---
No one got banned for tmorph afaik

The best part is that roof fan. Goddamn my upstairs game room gets so damn hot. I‚Äôm gong to go buy a room AC, found a fancy one I can connect to with an app and turn on so my room is ice without having to cool my whole house, therefore saving some scratch.

Yeah, of course it might take time to adjust but there's zero argument that it is always a benefit.

herb/alch is always profitable, once you're 35 you can start selling arcanite cds for 15g a pop(unless you're playing 24/7 at launch)
---
If you decide to get enchanting you'll just end up draining your money. There's lots of money to be made once you've maxed it out, but leveling it is extremely costly
---
Depends on the concert I guess :P
---
Nickelback? You bet'cher ass.
---
&gt; Any ideas as to how enhance shamans did in vanilla pve and pvp aside from the pvp montages?
---
Poorly. Very poorly, unfortunately. Most of the time you'll whiff. Is it doable? Sure. Anything is, really. But there's virtually no reason to do it over Ele Shamans in PvP which are very competent. 
---
You'll have the oddball Enh Shaman running Nightfall in PvE, but I'm not convinced that'll happen this time around. Vanilla was a different time, it definitely won't be the same and a lot of guilds will simply opt for their off-tank to spam hamstring which technically has a higher upkeep IIRC. But who knows, still it's incredibly unlikely you'd be that person. 
---
Leveling though, they're above average. But endgame there's little rhyme or reason to stick to Enhancement. They're probably a little too frustrating to stick to for most people. 
---
Still, it is probably what I'll end up doing. Leveling as Enh, doing whatever in dungeons (they can tank dungeons too for a while, if you know what you're doing) and swapping to Elemental around 40+. 
---
Enhancement (Troll) Shaman was my first main in vanilla, loved it, but this was around EU launch and people didn't realize how trash they were quite yet. So for a while it worked, hardly anyone knew how to optimize, but after a couple of months that died out pretty fast. Then it was waiting every patch for our time in the limelight, our time to climb the proverbial totem pole. Alas, that doesn't happen until TBC.

I've gotten into beta with my main account's active sub, and my 2nd account's dead one so it can go either way

Are you suggesting that a post from 21 days ago referencing an employee Alpha was actually talking about the Beta build not posted online until today?
---
It's a conspiracy!
---
You can build a beast classic PC for under $500 if you already have peripherals.
---
Dude your setup is made for paladin lvling. You just can have a Full workout consisting of 4-5 total body exercises while killing one mob. You will be shredded and lean once you hit lvl60
---
Depends a little on the zone, honestly. While leveling it's rough, since they struggle the most of any class and if you get caught out while fighting a mob you're probably dead. 
---
Some classes will run circles around you and you'll need engineering to close the gap. Again, an issue while leveling. If you can get the jump on them you'll do fine, but any class would.

60 is a different story. Warriors start scaling incredibly well, you'll presumably have engineering at this stage, and so they can do fine against all classes. It's not a particularly hard playstyle, but optimizing everything takes time. Once you got that down though, they can be real strong in 60 WPvP (but again so can every class really).
---
starting zones gonna be packed no matter what for at least a few weeks. You're better off trying to get ahead as early as possible.
---
Where did I say that I only play one class? I said that I have *mained* Rogue since 2005, not that it's the only class that I play. In classic I will be leveling Rogue and Mage first, followed by Warlock, Druid, Priest, and Hunter.
---
Also, you'd have to be a total melon to be arguing about this when Blizzard has already made up their mind. Batching is being implemented, and it's being implemented for good reasons.
---
&gt; spell batching is trash that only benefits rogues 
---
Removing spell batching would be a massive, massive buff to Rogues for your information. Batching allows Rogues to do things that are flashy and interesting but if all I cared about is making my main as strong as possible I'd choose the free restealths created by a lack of batching. Also, the fact that you think this is about Rogues wanting a buff is particularly rich in a world where we're have prep--&gt;blind, thistle tea, and certain lesser known but very busted things that I will be keeping to myself for the time being. Trust me, I'm not going to need batching to 100-0 you any time I feel like it, I just want batching so that I can be stylin' on you at the same time.
---
See you around in STV, BRM, Gulch, and Basin, rat. :)
---
That was the alpha test 3 weeks ago, this is a new build with almost 700 000 unnecessary (BC, WotLK, Cata, MoP, WoD, Legion, BfA) files removed, it's very likely the Classic beta test client build.
---
warriors is hard, but orc is. orc is stupid. and dwarf,
---
that original CDN thing happened a couple days before that bluepost and the subreddit was filled with speculation of a classic beta and not an alpha, so i thought they might've been related, yeah. my bad
---
Show us a video when it releases, I've always wondered what negative FPS looks like
---
&gt; Top 3 classes played will be mage rogue and warrior correct?
---
[This survey](https://aablain.github.io/wow-classic-survey/) puts Warlocks slightly above Rogues, but it's not a significant margin. On private servers, most of the time Warrior &gt; Mage/Rogue is indeed the case. 
---
&gt; Does that mean I should play mage to counter warriors and rogues?
---
Not a bad line of thought. I'd say the average rogue will win from the average mage, but it's very much a close skill matchup. 
---
&gt; I considered warlock but they get absolutely destroyed by warriors and rogues right?
---
If you're rolling with Soullink they definitely won't. Leveling is rougher, especially if you're Alliance (Because of WOTF) but at 60 they're an incredibly good PvP class. They're quite a bit tougher to master than the others though.
---
Thanks for the critique! I will mention the flaws of this survey in my essay.
---
Nice pot
---
I plan on skinning till I get my mount at 40, and then train Tailoring for [Robe of the Archmage](https://classicdb.ch/?item=14152) at 60. I know it will take extra time after each pull, but the money gained for selling Leather to the vendor is significant. And having more than enough gold to purchase my mount at 40 is most important.
---
So there will be instant mail to an alt on the same account. But will the post cost of sending mats and items too and from an alt be too pricey for the early wand strategy to be worth it?
---
Legion addons definitely won't run in a 8.x based environment. ELVUI is coming though
---
Skinning and disenchanting. Everyone is saying "herb/mining" you kidding me? Everyone will have those,  good luck getting to a gathering node when the whole server is trying to get them too.
---
/gif IT'S HAPPENING

"GET OUT" lmao 4sp00ky8me

what is this end game pve build, trying to get him to loss dps meters? :D

PVE:  [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/Aw\_0wAU5zwDHPQA](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/Aw_0wAU5zwDHPQA)  imp backstab for veal you will swift to daggers for that.
---
While leveling, its gathering all the way.
---
Long term its Enchanting.
---
If I remember correctly, you will often see "LF ENCHANTER" in THE cities chat.
---
That is one amazing set-up. I've seen this this morning while waking up and now I am on my way to buy LEDs and a new keyboard üòÅ
---
Where did you get that map ? I found one on amazon but it is now quite the same.
---
Ty
---
At the end of the day, I'm going to be able to 100-0 you any time I damn well feel like it, with or without batching. Batching is about looking cool while doing it.
---
During a wipe, one of the Mage players decided to taunt the dead a little ;)
---
Why would you choose LW and Tailor for your bank?  
---
The profession ceiling is based on your character level, or am I wrong?
---
I don't understand the question. I had about 12 mains in vanilla and I'll probably have about 12 in classic.
---
I am Oceanic and played on NA servers.
---
Nochanges?
---
Im Just happy it's released this year. But it's be better if it's released Naaauuuwww
---
While leveling skinning + mining or herbalism will be great for gathering materials to sell. You can drop them at 60 for whatever you want to have long term. If making money is your primary goal, gathering herbs or mining ore at 60 are still good options. Alchemy, leatherworking, and tailoring all have cooldowns (Arcanite Bar, Salt Shaker, and Mooncloth) that will give you some great passive income. If you plan on doing dungeons, having access to engineering for feign death + jumper cables as wipe protection can be a great buff to quality of life. If that's the route you choose, mining from 1-60 to gather the mats for 300 engineering would work out nice.
---
You have a lot of great options. I'm only playing one class in Classic, and Hunter and Mage were on my short list before finally deciding on Priest. Good luck with your Hunter, and enjoy the game!
---
What cant crit in retail is Greater Pyroblast which deals 33% of target HP in PvP. Normal Pyroblast can definitly crit.
---
14 glorious years later we are returning to the roots.
---
&gt; Trackball mouse, probably THE worst mouse for accurate quick control in a videogame.
---
Umm, NO! Trackballs have insanely fast turn speed and are super precise. I was using a thumb-trackball mouse playing Q3DM17, railguns only, no problem.
---
Professions are mostly a gold sink while leveling.  Particularly at the start. 
---
Wands from Enchant are great for leveling, but on your first character you're not going to get the 75/100 enchanting you need for them before level 5/13 unless you slow yourself WAY down.  
---
Once you do you might make some gold on the lvl 13 ones but the lvl 5 ones are not going to be feasible for people to buy on their first character.
---
Route my leveling-route and see to that hunters work the way I want them to work, bug-testing all their abilities.
---
if you're in the best guild. you will be require to rank 14 as a rogue, means 14/16 weeks full pvping for 15+-hours a day with no honor war. you will minimum be require to get all world buffs, depending how the server is scripted you might also need warchief's blessing from horde as a alliance, might even go as far to require flask of the titan for melees in speedruns, so it might go to 200-300g/raid, also they might go with 2 raids, team a and b where they split mains in 2 runs, and all is require to have a fully geared alt,  
---
also, requirement to be a spotter for worldbosses, and the requirement to allways be ready for worldboss spawns.   
---
so nah you cant just raidlog :D.
---
Not in all eurooean countries. We have the astrological begin on Sommersonnenwende and the meteological on 1. Juni.
---
the guy that helped ruin the game? yeah.
---
I'm going for a 24h session. I've tried the exact path i plan to take. Obviously it'll be different depending on competition due to high pop server, but as a warrior, after 24 hours, i expect to hit about level 7 üò•
---
No changes means no new tech, good luck running a 64bit on a potato hooked up to a toaster.
---
Guys I can‚Äôt find the golden retriever
---
If you plan on AoE-grinding all the way to 60, pick tailoring and skinning. You‚Äôll be killing a lot beasts and humanoids. Then when you hit 60 you can leave skinning for engineering.
---
My plan is influenced by this [Kargoz video](https://youtu.be/7--FKSEXkFw).   
---
You are correct, but I only need to be level 5 to train as Apprentice Tailor/Leatherworker. That lets me skill up from 1 - 75. Following the video, I only need to be an Apprentice to craft enough greens (in the correct item level) to send back to my Main. My main will then disenchant for Enchanting materials and skill ranks to eventually craft the Greater Magic Wand.
---
2 weeks off work, 30h+ first session, then 16-18h a day till 60. MC first week here we go üòè
---
415k xp to go on their xp bar, it might be bc?
---
It doesn't even require PvP gear. If anything, you want PvE tank gear against a rogue. Mana pool and spell power aren't very important in a matchup where you want to be in bear form as close to 100% of the time as possible.
---
It mainly cuts out all the June speculation.
---
I work nights at a call centre and we're usually pretty dead (5-6  &lt;1min duration calls over the course of 11 hours) So I'll be playing at work, then drive home, then play for a few hours at home. Sleep and repeat.
---
Isn‚Äôt that a standard UI feature? ‚ÄòShow dispellable debuffs‚Äô I think it‚Äôs called
---
That's honestly a terrible approach fir hardcore pushing. You will get caught in the zerg from day 1
---
Or the rogue gets a kick in against the spriest's hilariously obvious channelled spell which makes up 50% of their damage output. It's obviously one of the tougher matchups for any melee, but the priest doesn't have to fuck up in order to lose. As long as the rogue has trinket or WotF for the fear, it's really hard for a priest to get anything done with a rogue sitting permanently on them. People overrate spriest, it's a very poor PvP spec except in 1v1 against a couple of classes.
---
Your set up reminds me of my original college setup. Much more authentic experience.
---
Very nice ! I love the color of your walls and the paintings. The battlestation blends in pretty nicely too !
---
I assume that split raids means funneling gear in a selected group of main chars while the rest are alts of people who don't get any gear on purpose?
---
Stop saying you need decursive. Decursive won't work in Classic. Display the debuffs on whatever unit frames you are using and decurse manually, it's not difficult.
---
The one and only point is to get really ahead, and grab the lvl60 resources while you are there alone. It gives you many opportunities for gear/gold and will get you ahead. Only makes sense for people that are pushing for server firsts though, not everyone wants or can do that
---
Stv gorillas. I always hit these in the high 30s if I need mount money.
---
I'm expecting the first wave next week. That would likely include content creators initially. But they could go all out and invite a lot of people due to the very different testing requirements compared to an expansion.
---
r/neckbeardnests
---
Do you need an active sub to get an invite though?
---
I remember back in the day, people would talk about this.  The idea was that alliance players in general were younger and wanted cute characters.  And that those you get character(kids) were less inclined.
---
Not sure where it came about, but I remember it was a theory.
---
Alchemy if You are one the first people to get Frost Oil recipe.
---
I like a single monitor setup like this. Makes me feel more immersed in the game. I find that a second monitor for other stuff breaks immersion a bit.
---
Dude, my classic WoW hype is through the roof and I don't even have a PC. I'm saving all the money I can and hopefully when we get a release date I'm going to cash in the money I've saved on a sweet rig.
---
cool thanks man
---
Taking two weeks off from work. I already deal with insomnia and sometimes have to force myself to stay up for another whole day due to being at work.  I imagine a lot of us will be able to hit 60 fairly quickly with enough dedication.
---
Yes, after a month or two the alts will start getting gear as well. It‚Äôs like 40 man raiding but only 20 get loot and none ever goes to waste
---
As long as you have DBM you're fine, at least that was my experience as a healer clearing everything except some of naxx
---
I think the large "GET OUT" really sells the 35 y/o neckbeard living in my mother's basement feel this photo has. Can you imagine the smell?
---
He count all the mage/caster types in League and buffed them significantly.
---
Same here. I prepped my wife with "I hope you are prepared for me to take my wow classic vacation. I will not leave the house, I will not mow the lawn, I will not do anything until I hit 60"
---
She is cool with it.
---
revamped naxx was RUUUUINED, it was fun... but it was a nerfed original naxx, like, around 400% easier, just imagien any boss in naxx 25man, and imagine it being 4x harder, but wearing the same gear lol. Revamped Onxyia was cool though, got to wear teir 2 again :)
---
This is from live, just have my 60 on my account :P
---
I presume based off the mic you stream. If so, how does your audience feel about the 21:9 gameplay? What steps did you take to ensure they have the best experience as possible?
---
Potatos and toasters are too good for this setup
---
You're thinking with a warm country bias. Summer in Finland lasts usually 2 days, hopefully on a weekend this year. July 16th

100% is, guild chat is referencing the best alliance guild &lt;APES&gt;

Are you asking if Blizzard will use a time machine to contact our younger selves and convince us to play Classic in the future?
---
No, I don't think they will do that.
---
Get a coaster for your drinks pls
---
Does a cat or dog go on that pillow?
---
Same here, and I have to share the pillow
---
The announcement needs to be "we will be releasing classic wow on (date)" that's it that's what everyone wants fuck the pageantry we just was the mfing date!
---
payo ofc
---
I think you like WOW
---
True Chad Immersion right here.
---
Haha, if this wasn't staged it's gold!
---
He's asking if there's an ingame BFA storyline or reveal for Classic. Imagine like a prepatch concurrent with 8.1/2, whichever it is, I imagine is what he's saying.
---
No i am just interested lore wise are they gonna do something
---
Believe what you wanna believe
---
Honestly just go out and exercise if it's that important dont multitask you'll do both poorly
---
/fall /winter
---
The realms released late, so that not even that bad considering they had a year to catch up to or so.
---
&gt; I remember being a hunter and having rogues and warriors roll need on ranged weapons so they can pull mobs.
---
Yep, that UD Strath Crossbow. I remember clearly losing that to so many freaking melee classes as a stat slot to pull mobs; but the same people would blow a GASKET when you rolled on weapons as a hunter for your stat stick.
---
The double standard was ridiculous. I was so happy when I joined a guild and escaped PUGs man...
---
Wholesome

---
Hunter setup ! Because pet unstealthed a rogue
---
Classic is suppose to be CLASSIC dont change a fucking thing from how it used to be on day 1
---
The names of the dev's addons.
---
They talked about Classic in the earnings call. It'll come in the second half of the year. They also keep saying summer. So it's July or August then. (Or September if we count that weird "astronomical" summer thingy. :)
---
Was it always that ‚Äûhigh‚Äú? If i remember correctly i played tbc and wotlk on a pc with 1GB of ram
---
Have Blizzard said that before? I always thought more reliable accounts had a higher chance with Blizzard betas. I know its only anecdotal but for the Overwatch beta I had about 7 accounts signed up, and most of my friends also had multiple accounts signed up which they made just for the Beta, the only account that got invited was my account that I've been using since WoW tbc and has nearly every Blizzard game on it. From then on I always assumed they prioritised people who played Blizzard games over newer accounts.
---
I agree. Like a server that changes like OSRS maybe? They had 2007scape and OSRS
---
This. I like this.
---
The finest clothes my tailoring main can provide! Will be a female tauren with a name somehow relating to milk. Almost mandatory I feel.
---
This is about the cataclysm deadmines though...
---
I can't decide if I think this is anime level semi cringe or the coolest minimalistic set up I've seen so far. I think I'll go with cool. I kinda want myself a sick painting like that too. Love the way it's separated into multiple pieces. Props for not living in a basement too.
---
I think it will be 10-15 gigs big. Original 1.12 client had I think 6 gigs or so, but in classic there are more graphic options so it would make sense the client would be a bit bigger. But yes I agree with you. 60a would be just too much.
---
Hey don't worry, I remember those raids. Made it impossible to level there some days
---
&gt; You are seriously butthurt that I used logic to flip the conversation in a way you couldn't defend against it
---
This is a strange new definition of "logic" that I am previously unfamiliar with. It does look an awful lot like stupid straw man arguments and attempts to personalise the argument though. Are you sure you don't get your ideas about "logic" from Ben Shapiro?
---
I haven't said anything about limiting anyone's free will in any way, shape of form. That is sheer nonsense you made up out of whole cloth.
---
I am just saying there's nothing wrong with liking some consequences of free-for-all PvP but not all consequences of free-for-all PvP.
---
For all you know I might not even want to play on a PvP server at all. Would that blow your tiny noodle? If I literally had no personal stake whatsoever in what people who play on PvP servers think about the consequences of free-for-all PvP?
---
The Office&gt;Dogs&gt;Battle Stations&gt;?
---
I think thats a cool idea but I think this is aimed at a different audience. Classic is here to bring in players who arent interested in retail and to increase interest in the wow brand overall. I doubt they want to pull players from retail as that doesnt create new revenue for them. They likely expect retail to hold one player base and classic to create an additional one. More money bruh!
---
Dude you have a switch. Wish I had a switch.
---
Where did you get that?
---
How do you know this??
---
Never trust an Alliance, he is just trying to get you to roll an Enhancement shaman and wants to kite you forever!
---
That‚Äôs elite, gj wp
---
And if not for that run, it will become the tank after a couple of runs anyway
---
&gt; I find it somewhat infuriating how poorly many essential mechanics in WoW are actually conveyed to the players. 
---
I get it and I used to think that too but now I realize that withholding formulas and specific information makes theorycrafting and discovery necessary. It adds a new dimension in which players can be better than others.
---
OSRS also has bonds which allow you to pay to win. Classic wow wont have wow tokens.
---
So it's the vanilla map, that's nice :)
---
Well I did choose the druid over the shaman, because of totem management.
---
If I could have dealed with this mechanic I probably would have picked shaman.
---
It depends on what you pref. in terms of gameplay style. 
---
Do you like to shift forms and be an escape artist.
---
Or do you want those chain lightning and chain heals, but with more stationary totems.
---
The devs used addons and the new build leaks some of their names.
---
Thx for your input.
---
I have considered Hemo as i personally like the cheap cost of the ability and idea that im buffing other melee classes in raid (although only slighty), but, its also a spec i have as a backup only because like you said, not many raiding guilds use the debuff slot for hemo rogues over say fx a shadowpriests shadow weaving buff, i hope to find a raiding guild where i can be the designated hemo rogue, otherwise ill be perfectly happy being combat or SF specced.
---
I like it even tho it got jumpy now, can't do precise movement but it doesn't move the cursor on it's own if that is what you are asking. Trackballs also have a learning curve.
---
I'll bet that keyboard costs more than the pc. What keyboard is that?
---
I hope its on the earlier phases, yeah
---
I had a shaman main tank dire maul west once. He would open initial agro on multiple mobs by chain lightning. Was sceptical at first. But there were no issues the entire run.
---
People just want totems. They are amazing support buffs meanwhile you are tossing out chain heals and topping meters.
---
Priests cant do any of that shit.
---
Can tell it's been a while, I used to have that Samsung monitor. Used it for many years and got rid of it many years ago hehe. +1 for the conspiracy poster. I want to believe also!
---
this man knows
---
I still remember watching this for the first time back in 2005. Good old times..
---
Am I the only one that won't play the Beta? I want to conjure up as much nostalgia as possible and go back totally oblivious and act like a complete n00b.
---
16 hrs lol what a casual
---
No. Have always received a beta invite for every xpac from cataclysm and onwards and I was never subbed during those periods.
---
ded sub cause of release ? :P
---
Eh, Razer products aren't even bad, just horribly overpriced. I've got the same keyboard and it's extremely well built, just not worth the $150 asking price though. Got mine on sale, think I only paid $80 for it, would do it again in a heartbeat
---
I think late 80's [IBM Model M](https://i.imgur.com/p2Ean1T.jpg).

About 100‚Ç¨ in good condition. Uses buckling springs so it's very clicky and pleasant to type on.
---
it was certainly possible to play on 1gig at launch, maybe even 512mb .  i think the 2 gb min is since the overhaul around cataclysm or further updates
---
Oh wow, look at you flexing all your money on your high end build.

Warlocks should eat mages and torture most rogues.  Warriors...  Maybe not so much.

or you could just buy a 2nd hand pc for around ‚Ç¨100 / $100 that will run current WoW and classic just fine....   I even played it on a ‚Ç¨20 old office HP from a junksale without problems.
---
How dare you call Taurens out on their hygiene. Your gnome bias is too obvious! \^\^
---
Buckling springs, nice. Sadly haven't typed on those or any alps switches.

Nope.

This is so godly. Phenomenal setup.
---
Wow I just might do the same now. It never dawned on me about the 225 lockpicking
---
So I  just watched this movie on a whim based on this thread and your comment and it was absolutely incredible. Thanks for the call out.
---
Cheetah is level 20 tho.  But if you get it to 35 you can get professions past 225.
---
Easier option: eat less
---
To each their own. Wow is so basic, I've always felt the need to multitask to be fully occupied. I'm never playing without some other media on. My second monitor is 4k, hooked up to 4 different media sources, most premium channels, Netflix, Criterion Channel, and Prime. 
---
My current leveling plan is to rewatch my favorite 100 films or maybe my top 5 SF TV series. And I'm excited to do so while wanding mobs 18 hrs a day on a priest :)
---
FYI, you couldn't do the Razorgore fight and the nefarian 1st phase with an ISDN 64k connection. I had a super good PC, my ping with ISDN was around 30ms but major raid/event would make my connection overload and disconnect :(.
---
Worst part i was in a top elitist FR guild, they never knew :p
---
Oh :p thanks
---
Two words. Chainlightning/Chainheal. That should be all the info you need. Seriously though i think Shaman have more longevity not to be burned out. Three unique specs etc.
---
I'm glad pfUI exists. Been an elvUI guy since cata. First thing I'll be doing is installing that.
---
What models are those screens?
---
Whats that addon called that displays the exact time in buffs?
---
It is a Model M.
---
Coincidentally, I just found and bought a Model M on a local flea market. Typing this very comment with it.
---
A race of class doesn‚Äôt define personality. It‚Äôs total bullshit. That is what i mean.
---
That sounds right. If I remember correctly I bought a new pc when cata came out
---
Classic will support high res. On the demo I played on a 4K. You'll have a lot more space, unless rocking a vanilla age monitor :)
---
But to do that they'd actually have to know something about vanilla instead of making a video based on someone else's spreadsheet.
---
If you get the Rogue to 21, you can get 2 points in Endurance for 1.5 min off the cooldown of Sprint!!
---
This but unironically. Retail is total garbage at the minute
---
Normally you'd be correct, but this is a different case really. Generally speaking this is one of the last steps because they don't want to clear out unused files too early, for the off-chance that they may find a use for them once more and would have to find the file again etc.
---
In this case however, they already know exactly which files they need from the get-go. They're free to do it at any time.
---
You could invest in a desk with adjustable height. Standing while gaming feels awkward at first but you come to love it. It is also healthier than sitting due to more muscle groups being activated for your balance. Just make sure to keep good posture!

Just check the link that this thread posted... The Classic Beta has been on the CDN since April 15th and has been confirmed to currently be a friends &amp; family Alpha. It is presumed that this will transition into a closed beta at some point, but we don't know when. There's been 7 updates to the Classic Beta CDN already so this particular update means nothing at all, really.
---
Even lesser fights like Cthun or Ouro it can be helpful on.
---
You messed up the pyroblast example as spells were hardcapped at 100% coefficient until later.
---
Did HE send you?!

Retail for flying mount /s

Which you could have got months ago by raiding instead of wasting time in dungeons.

Do you think all the hardcore guilds will be farming pre-raid bis before they set foot in MC?

The plan is to stay up really late Monday night into Tuesday morning. Sleep for 8 hours basically exactly before launch and then wake up and go hard from there.
---
It's the same client as the one you're speaking of, it was called a beta then as well.
---
1.12 client is a universal binary and it runs on Intel.
---
1.12 private servers run just fine on the latest macOS natively

Because it doesn't really offer any perspective when everyone loses against SL warlock.

I can‚Äôt wait to just get out playing and enjoying all that Azeroth has to offer. I enjoyed tBC but part of me was gutted all the work put in was immediately made obsolete when the level cap was changed.
---
I am looking forward to this not changing and working to maximse my character as best I can even if it takes 2-4-6 yrs or longer!
---
Yea, that's gonna be a no from me. 27" == 1440P. A lower resolution just looks... blurred.
---
I was so excited when they announced oceanic servers. When we found out they they were still based in the states I was a little pissed. Playing with 400ish ms from NZ never felt great
---
Right because refreshing /r/classicwow and taking pictures of your setup is any more of a waste of brainpower. How about you just let him post what he likes.
---
Ehhh... The neon-green tube is kinda horrible unless the rest of the room has adequate lighting as well. I've tried something like this as well, and having a light source directly under your screen is terrible and distracting.
---
This. Quantity and quality of addons will depend on the length of beta.
---
read the post before commenting like a mongoloid. 
---
&gt;I don‚Äôt think adding heroic or hard modes is appropriate for Classic, as it‚Äôs supposed to be a recreation of vanilla as it was, but it was fun to come up with a more ‚Äúdifficult‚Äù set of mechanics for the bosses in Molten Core.
---
You can wield a big 2 hander with windfury as a ele too. In fact if you're fighting clothies, there's no reason to put a shield on.
---
Why are you making fun of the left daniel, respect the deceased dude...
---
This is not my classic experience
---
Tailoring and skinning at the beginning, before you start raiding drop skinning for engineering.
---
Blizzard entertainment not giving you specifically a release date is downright disrespectful
---
You can skip up to level 10 mobs with 1 point in skinning. 
---
The skill required to skin a mob depends on its level. Here's how it works:
---
Skinning skill required is:
---
1 for level 1-10 mobs.
---
(10 times mob level) minus 100 for level 11-20 mobs.
---
5 times level for level 21-63mobs.
---
I was broke this time three years ago too mate. Now I‚Äôve got a house, wife, dog, killer setup and life is good. The only advice I can give is just keep applying yourself. The rest will fall into place. Never stop trying with whatever it is you‚Äôre doing.
---
But I downvote and/or report all of the memes and boxes/guides and now "battle stations", why aren't I left with just discussion?

Oh it didn't break it on its own. My german shepherd got ahold of it.

It took a beating and still worked, just jagged as all hell from chewing.

I have a trampoline, I plan to do 2 or 3 minutes of hardcore jumping every hour.

I tested it on a 24h run on a pserver, it's miraculous against sleepiness (my calves felt stiff for a week after that \^\^) !

What desk is that. Any chance you know the name? Would like to get the dimensions and find out if its adjustable.

Oh fuck I‚Äôm deleting it
---
How the hell does this garbage keep getting upvoted... this sub is totally unrecognizable from a year ago
---
A lot of people are in this situation nowadays I find. The AAA industry has gone off the deep end in terms of how mechanical/calculated the game design is, and not in a good way. For a few years now, older/Indie games are easily the most enjoyable outside of the rare AAA game that actually does something good.
---
Even porn actresses play WOW !
---
looks comfy tbh
---
Also extremely good for fending off any home invaders.
---
Im saying my own experience with that class from last 2 months. If you are losing to rogues or dealing low damage, you are doing something wrong
---
Killing any horde player in the open world.
---
I played Warrior on Nost and Ely and Low-Level Tanking is just THE WORST! 
---
And the fun thing is, at 60 if your Gear becomes too good it also sucks because you are Rage-Starved (in easier Content).
---
I always tanked during Leveling but I really didn't like it, especially since all the Min-Max DPS didn't even let me pull.
---
Orc females are the best looking race in Hunter tier sets imo. The body proportions look really good. Male Troll has better shooting animation I would say, but the posture and feet aren't as nice to look at once you get geared.
---
Killing any alliance player in the open world.
---
I'm really not into BfA atm, but you know what's the thing with opinions...
---
It's not really the lack of exercise that makes you fat. You're just eating too much.
---
\&gt;:(
---
what education? lmfao
---
Oh common, I levelled 3 warriors to 60 in Vanilla, it's not that bad.
---
Warrior 1-10 feels better than hunter and druids !
---
Warrior 1-20 feels better than rogue.
---
Of course after that they outspeed you, but remember that you're still faster than paladins \^\^ !
---
Who? :O
---
Are you implying that they aren't?
---
Looking at that list, some of the betas took months to go from beta to realease, so I'm going to hang fire on this one.
---
\- You : 911 what's your emerge ... fuck ! Heal me, heal me I said !!!
---
\- Person in distress : hello, please someone's trying to kill me !!!

\- You : AND WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS NELF HUNTARD IS TRYING TO DO TO ME ???!!! CALL BACK LATER, I DON'T HAVE TIME NOW !!!!

:D

Thoughts.

there where some obivious hints for next wednesday
---
I never cared how my PC looks, I just care how it performs.
---
gaining 50 pounds cause im sitting in my chair 14 hours a day.
---
TBH i never realized Those servers wernt a thing. But makes sense seeing how my guild had a few aussies and NZ players.
---
The fucking release date.
---
creating 10 different chars on one server and start playing, deciding what i want to main after countless mindchanges, dont rush things. trying to create my own actionbar addon
---
I got it through Zippay and don't really deserve it tbh
---
Imagine getting a beta before they even give the release date?  I thought they would tell us the release date first then give a beta afterwards tbh.
---
LEEEEEEEEEEEEEEROY JEEEEEENKINS
---
That's blizzard pretending everything is dandy.
---
If you have to say "Am I the only one" then you're not the only one.
---
I've gotten used to sitting down low though, I kind of like it
---
A kotatsu would probably make it perfect though
---
I don't care haha. You have a switch! But yea I like your build. At least you have two monitors. I just have a laptop.
---
Enjoy giving my time for a game. I haven‚Äôt much time to play but I know exactly what game I‚Äôll be playing :p
---
Now, I am wasting so much time to chose what game I want to play.. :D
---
r/wowclassiccirclejerk when?
---
A fast one hander can be nice against clothies to keep their casts pushed back though so sticking to 1h + shield may be preferable

Look at the chat, even then people wanted to stay in Classic rather than venture into the Dark Portal üòÇ
---
I had an accident at age 3 or something where I damanaged badly one of my right hands finger and that caused me to grow up as lefty.
---
the crazy setups are cool for a few days and then your brain just finds it normal. kinda sucks, happens to all new stuff.
---
You aren‚Äôt alone. I have no interest what so ever in participating in the beta for the same reasons as you. Plus that you lose all progress you make on the beta character so it just feel like a waste
---
No consumables. And if a Pally used LoH or crap like that I was kinda pissed too.
---
As a Structural engineer i'm worried about those beam joints.
---
I can't wait to be getting excited about getting a new upgrades as i level, they actually feel like upgrades. Its always a good feeling, especially a weapon upgrade.
---
Nobody believes me when I tell them slam is good !
---
Having a place to call home
---
I mean skinning is good, he knows that, but enchanting is useless on a fresh server for making gold...
---

I was looking for a dog...

My usual raid time was 1-5am NZ time when we were battling our way through BWL. Guild leader was in Hawaii if I'm not mistaken and we'd all be in ventrilo waiting for him to get home from work as he was also our MT.

---
Yes
---
yep
---
where's everyone getting this 'final step' meme from? i mean, it makes sense but [citation needed]
---
Yeah, I love this setup. Well done, OP. 
---
I have a reasonable PC, but it's getting on in years. Can afford to upgrade if I need to. Have one five/six year old 22" monitor but could probably get three new 24" ones. Have a second hand swivel chair but could get a cool looking gaming chair.
---
You know what's stopping me? I don't have a big enough desk and I don't have the room to put said desk if I ever got one. :(
---
Our next house is definitely going to have a study or a spare bedroom...
---
Skinning combines well with tailoring as several bags and other good skilling recipes sometimes require skins.
---
You can also make an enchanting alt and bust all your tailoring stuff no one will buy into enchanting mats (unlike TBC+ there no minimum skill on disenchanting in vanilla, so you just need a level 5 bank alt to do disenchanting duties).
---
That way if you decide to swap to enchanting at 60, you won't have wasted any materials, or if you decide not to, you can AH them once people start trying to speed grind profs at 60.

Thats the case every single week for months.
---
Sure I have changed, in WoW I played Hardcore Rogue. 
---
Late TBC I started my first twink, my Druid and absolutely adored to Heal, Tank and have the budget Rogue.
---
I adored the class so much, I mained it during WotLK.
---
That set me off to a path of Support Playing in all kinds of games.
---
I developed two playstyle for myself: As a DD I'm a high risk, high reward player. High damage, while I'm in your face.
---
Or the unkillable support player, while my DDs clean house all around me.
---
Which makes me a versatile player to master the Druid. I read a lot, how casual players think, the Druid is THE class for people who just want to cruise around. But I disagree, I think the Druid is the perfect Class, to test out your skills and go to the limit, especially in PvP.
---
I'm very excited to gear my Resto Druid to say the least and Tank a little bit here and there.
---
I have a different idea. I tell her about classic like once every 30 mins. So when it release and and I stop nagging her about it she feel relived that i just sit down and shut up and lets me be alone
---
level 10 is under 2h-2h30min if you know what to do, so more like 5h-7h till 10 if you don't know what to do + new server population
---
Hunter for aspect of cheetah. Imagine all the combined time saved running back and forth from bank, mailbox, and AH.
---
30 out of 40, but I've played WoW mostly in another language so I guess I've got a good excuse. :D

---
Well there haven't been any news about classic lately so a harmless joke can't hurt anyone except you so yeah keep getting butthurt.
---
SL/SL isn‚Äôt possible until TBC. You only get to pick one, so I assume you mean Soul Link. This means your only DOTs are Corruption, COA and Immolate. By dispelling CoA (the trick is to wait until it‚Äôs less than 16 seconds left, which is where the damage stops being neglegible) and keeping Fire Ward up a Mage can actually last a while, especially when you factor in Ice Barrier and two Ice Blocks. Fear is short range, and a Warlock has no way to close the gap if you keep r1 frostbolt slow up.
---
All in all it really isn‚Äôt that one-sided. The mage just requires deep knowledge of both classes to stand a chance.
---
I just want to say a big rip to all of us when they announce August 25th release or something like that...
---
Not rushing it to the max level :)
---
Don't crush my dreams dude....
---
He meant 30/0/21
---
If Beta starts next week/tomorrow and it usually lasts 1-2 months for Blizzard then August is looking more and more likely. But I pray everyday that what you said is true. I want Saturday to tell us it's out June 20th or something!
---
Warrior.
---
It could run two classics
---
My only complaint is the Horde flag. Don't be that guy. Roll Alliance.
---
I understand it's still quite the wait, but I would just appreciate a release date by now. The longer they wait, the less likely it is for me and many others to get my vacation approved to enjoy the first 1-2 weeks after launch.
---
Certainly a PServer, nobody walked around with so many flasks in Vanilla.
---
Yeah comfortably. I‚Äôve got something similar and it runs BFA without issue. And Classic will run on the Legion engine so you should be fine.
---
Proof of setup OP, we want pictures!
---
I've got two and really trying to figure out a way to squeeze in a third, even something small. But preferably a rotated screen for reading. So one main, a video/web, and a chat/reading screen.
---
Right?
---
We are all using version control, every single iteration of everything is kept, no need to keep the junk lying around.
---
Or druid.
---
At that point turn on click to move and play it like an rts with the camera zoomed in. 
---
Yikes.
---
That video gave me Vietnam-style flashbacks of 90's computer gaming.
---
I prepped my wife, and miraculously she is taking our daughter (3) to the grandparents for the weekend (first weekend after launch) to give me time alone. 
---
I am more excited for those 2 days than any vacation.
---
There's plenty of people doing the starter raids for the current expansion and the same was the case in Legion. I know we like to shit on retail, but lets not make shit up.
---
Heh ? U had such a shitty rig back then ? My old gfx card Costed more than my laptop I‚Äôm using now
---
cant be r14 and lean
---
Questing in the barrens at night, when the music sets in as you leave crossroads.

We call that the giving machine, because it will definitely give you carpal tunnel.

Those mods though!

No changes

Exactly. All kinds of RBG looks cheap to me tbh.
---
Ya oce servs will probably be a thing
---
the thing is though oce will end up in the/an NA battlegroup so shit ping for bgs. rip.
---
Atleast I have chicken
---
Looks awesome
---
Ah well, at least we can sit outside ORG (or IF) and duel one another :P.
---
Yessss

As a person that played ud shadow priest in vanilla to r13 u are wrong. Troll is the better pvp and pve priest. U get berserking to cast faster heals or mind blasts when ur low, u get a spammable low mana curse that gives -20% healing on ur target and u get the sickest priest racial shadow guard . Which does like 1k dmg every 9 sec with gear and shadowspecced, gives blackout procs !!!!! And stacks of shadowweaving and procs on ranged attacks too so u can stun a hunter kiting u. If i had the time to play a lot again I would of played troll spriest but the gearing is what holds me back

depends.

If she will go enhance, you might go ranged Dps

if she will go ele/resto, you might go Warrior

Lol no.

Do you even play BFA? Nobody does Uldir anymore. There's no gear in there that's required. The azerite gear is trash, the trinkets are trash.
---
Looks terrific! :)

Can it run BfA / Retail, if yes, ? then it can run clasisc.

am i the holy one?

In construction management it‚Äôs quite minimal. So between my family vacation and the two bachelor party weekends I‚Äôm shit out of luck. That being said I‚Äôm out of work at 2, so it‚Äôs not like I won‚Äôt be able to crush a couple 9 hour sessions

Well that ruins the fun.

Yes, lol.

&gt; Do you even play BFA? Nobody does Uldir anymore. There's no gear in  there that's required. The azerite gear is trash, the trinkets are  trash.

Yes, I do. I literally just went online now, EU. Booted up the Dungeon &amp; Raids finder, and there's 5 Uldir groups forming. I did Uldir heroic last reset, to help out some friends getting achievements and it took maybe 15 minutes to gather the people.

Fairly certain [this](http://www.wowclassicbis.com/) site already has all this.

Whenever a company gives you sensitive information about an unreleased product they have you sign an NDA which is often a legal binding that pretty much says if you leak the information you've been given they can sue the shit out of you. Whether or not they'll take legal action depends. If it's an online NDA that you agreed to, then you'll most likely just get your account banned. They however actually went there and physically signed one, which they do with anyone who will be anywhere near locations development is going on to cover themselves in case you see or hear something you're not supposed to.
---
How strict the NDA is may vary as well. As others haver commented it's possible that it only states they're not allowed to directly leak any info, but are allowed to subtly drop hints. However, with the climate of Classic, they've been quite tight lipped about it so I imagine it's a pretty restrictive NDA and Tips could potentially get into legal trouble.
---
Lmao I seriously think about making a pala and workout while leveling himüòÇ that could actually work out
---
Nah, not that good. Model F is better - it's two or three times heavier.
---
Good catch, do you have thoughts on replacements on the waist?
---
I'll just remove Carapace Spine Crossbow since the other two alternatives are good enough.
---
Do you think two shaman are viable?  We won‚Äôt be raiding, I wouldn‚Äôt think.  At best just 5-mans.
---
yeeeah, but Alphas typically don't last less a month either.
---
Hunter shaman for leveling maby would be nice?
---
He was worse than Ian. Let's try to forget him.

I had Dell Inspiron 1300 with P4M 1.7 GHz, 512 MB of ram, Intel 945 or 915 as GPU (whopping 8 MB of vram). It ran WotLK on 15-20 FPS. When Cataclysm came out, I've already upgraded it to 2 gb, so can't confirm.
---
That is correct.
---
Amen! Triggity trash
---
I looked at that site and I feel like it fails to give alternatives or difficulty to each slot. Dal'rend set is very hard for hunters to grab, just too heavily contested, same goes for HoJ which if it drops should go to the hunter only if all the other melee in that group has it.
---
Me too. Growing up lefty in a righty‚Äôs world amiright?

I can see why Subtlety can be better for PvP by looking at it's skills.
---
I had another question about poisons - which one should I keep on for leveling? I've been told that for PvP I should mostly use Crippling. Does it matter on which hand do I put them? Should I put on both or just one?
---
Right off the first 10-12 days until I‚Äôm 60

Have to agree with this. It's a very well done room but I don't think the green light adds anything.
---
The more players the better, with more pop you have more wpvp shorter bg queues and less lfg dungeon wait time. Might aswell roll a pve server if the server is capped at under 5k
---
You want strength/stam mail gear for leveling. Cloth is great when you go full holy
---
Warrior, druid or hunter.
---
The mythical figure. Some say he's still eating his chicken to this day.
---
Eh.. no class honestly has much of a skill cap in pve (power shifting cats would be the exception).
---
But in pvp the difference between an average rogue and an amazing rogue is immense. Watching someone like perplexity control the battlefield.. peeling, cc‚Äôing, interrupting - it‚Äôs honesty nuts. You couldn‚Äôt be more wrong.

They won't.

You realize that back then we had considerably less "news" than we've had for months? And yet somehow memes get upvoted over discussion every time. This has nothing to do with news and everything to do with the subreddit rules. As long as memes are allowed, substantive discussion will be an exception rather than the rule.
---
And sure, there are other forums where that isn't the case. It's just a shame that it's apparently been decided this one won't be one of them anymore, even though it did that job wonderfully for a very long time.
---
Yeeep! Lol warrior orcs. Ah shit that brought me back
---
Howdy, well we are 80+ members now but we assume that not all will actually end up rolling with us - or reach 60 for that matter. Mages are just as popular now as then it seems, it's our biggest class atm... I'll talk with the other GM's in the guild and get back to you
---
How did you get the middle monitor floating?
---
Yeah, I remember looking a bunch of stuff up after I started watching Asmongold. I literally cannot tell who is Horde and who is Alliance, and I'm guessing it no longer matters.
---
I remember quitting first week into Cata, partially because I did not like all the additional race/class combos. I thought that was a step too far, but it seems trivial in comparison to what it is now.
---
You're talking about WoD's garrisons right?  
---
I agree that it made the garrison your own little prison, but I'm talking specifically about the questing experience of the zones. I liked WoD's questing more than Legion's or BfA's, and far more than Cata's and MoP's. 
---
I'd roughly rank them like this overall:
---
TBC &gt; WotLK &gt; Vanilla &gt; WoD &gt; Legion &gt; BfA &gt; MoP &gt; Cata
---
&gt; Retail has so many tools given to melee that the skill floor is quite low &amp; the skill ceiling is quite low.   
---
I know people here like to shit on retail, and on many occasions I absolutely agree with it. But thats just plain wrong. Retails skill ceiling is by no means lower than Classics. Everyone who says that probably never did high end pve or pvp.
---
you should 100% level your bank alts to lvl 10.
---
im not exactly sure how blizzard will handle things in classic but in retail gm's can only restore things(and or character) when he is at least lvl 10.
---
A regular philisophe in the house

Shaman and Warrior make for a great duo. You are basically set for all the elite-quests, and elite-mob-grinding. Had this with a friend of mine back in the day. So much synergy. Especially later on with windfury totem, brings big fun for warriors. The versatility a shaman brings, is really nice. You won‚Äòt have to roll on the same gear and no matter what drops, you can basically make use of it, except for wands. Leaves the question for what professions? I‚Äòd recommend alchemy and maybe also skinning/mining for money
---
Next weekend the beta will start and we will get the release date 16th of July. I have two weeks off from work beginning 15th of July, just trust me.
---
They would get a ton of hate yes.
---
Legit thought about this since I travel for work from time to time. Hahah damn glad to see I'm not the only one.
---
yup. Pretty much every new game I actually enjoy/like is either Indie or Nintendo. Have a switch and a somewhat decent PC and you are good.
---
And  graphical fidelity will be downscaled (for the classic option). Imo It will run even better than classic did.
---
My GM is a filthy rogue. He has his council of tanks.
---
I see. Would you take it over crit talent or anything else really? I.e. is it the strongest on that tier?
---
So incredibly torn between Shaman and Hunter for (mainly solo) PvP. Played both back in the day, watched countless of PvP videos now. I love both playstyles. 
---
Ele probably will be a pain the ass to gear. On the other hand it has an Enhance spec to spice things up.  And Ele has more potential to 1vX.
---
MM Hunter will be a lot easier to gear, but it's should be a lot weaker in 1vX situations than Elemental. Sweet levelling though, even if I intend to go MM all the way.
---
Burst is awesome in both specs... It's so close!
---
just wait, it's only getting started. they wouldn't release races like murlocs first or nobody would buy recolored elves
---
I will leave that calculation to the theorycrafters
---
I‚Äôd much rather have race additions than class additions. Not a balancing nightmare and when the new class is the inevitable FOTM you don‚Äôt have to deal with seeing 6000 shitty ones in your dungeons. I admit LightForged Draenei and Maghar Orcs are fairly uninspired but Zandalari Trolls, Nightborn, and Kul Tirans are great.
---
Lol.  This is much better than most of the recent posts, I have to say
---
Fair enough
---
You won‚Äôt see this mentioned anywhere because apparently everyone disagrees with us but personally, 2/2 improved sprint is amazing. I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve survived mage fights and broken CC with it, and lower cooldown is fantastic too. I think your proposed build is great
---
I also personally modify it by dipping into subtlety and taking improved vanish too. But that‚Äôs just because I love to pvp and those two are sick while levelling. For pure combat your build is good
---
Warmonger.
---
tbh HoJ isn't too bad since people run BRD a ton so other classes tend to pick it up pretty quickly.
---
Truestrike Shoulders are tough, there's always [Ghetto Trustrike Shoulders](https://classicdb.ch/?item=12082).
---
Painreaver's Band is pretty hard to get your hands on too.
---
So, you end up running UBRS a lot. Luckily, people want Hunters in UBRS.
---
WAWAWA
---
I like it but during the day that would be too much glare for me.
---
Oh ok - people can only agree here?
---
I'm not obligated to like someones shrine to a game.  I enjoy WoW as much as the next guy but I think this is over the top - nothing wrong with saying that when it's posted to a public forum.
---
I purposely use 1 monitor. Two is very distracting and it kind of ruins the immersion with a second bright white screen open. That applies for movies/other games as well.
---
Tankandbank
---
10 year old setup here. Typically computer chair and a fake wood desk I built from Amazon. Represent my dude!
---
wowclassicbis.com alrdy done it
---
Frostbite Girdle, Cloudrunner Girdle and Cadaverous Belt are some good waists. You can just run Scholo and get which ever of Frostbite or Cadav that drops first. Relatively similar in dps. You can also get Cadaverous Armor there which I would say is comparable to Savage Gladiator Chain.
---
The felheart robe actually has 1% chance to hit and some spell power so it‚Äôs really good early on.  So if robe of volatile power isn‚Äôt available your still sitting pretty good without robe of the void.
---
Holy shit you are the most passive aggressive guy here, chill the fuck down man. 
---
I know for a fact that I wont be resubbing for wow before classic is out, and neither will a large portion of players. Another month without classic is another month without us as subscribers, and that's a net loss, no matter how you look at it.
---
They realize their numbers are dwindling, and they're dropping enough subs to realize that these content patches for BFA arent enough to keep people coming back,  but classic will.
---
Cozy
---
Aussie on servers back then were a nightmare and my 256mb vid card was chunking.
---
What are the stats and name of this puppy? I think I had one just like it in college.
---
That's a nice intent dude, I hope you will be able to deliver.
---
256MB RAM
---
Lol!
---
Good call on Warmonger and the other shoulder-alternative, not sure when they were added though. 
---
It just says added in 1.11 on wowhead, so there's a good chance they're not available.
---
Mongoose Boots won't be in either given that the recipe is from Dire Maul.
---
I think it's the first time I see someone complaining about more customization options for his/her characters.
---
Like to be free down under? Give me a call!
---
Yes it can!
---
It's only dumb if it doesn't work.
---
It's what Ions team does. They saturate everything until it's bland and meaningless. Look at gear and mounts for example.
---
I know, I just wanted to open up a discussion regarding options since some of the BIS-slots for hunters can be hard to aquire.
---
since BC, Blizzard has alternated adding a new class or race each xpac.. except for mop added both and wod added neither.. so we gave new races mostly in bfa so should in theory be a new class in the next xpac... but we'll see what they do.
---

Well, that's beyond terrible if this is real, but hey, good on you.
---
I'm glad I see fellow Chads in front spamming Tab+1 instead of waiting in the virgin queue.
---
Nope! My plan is to be on as much as I can, but still maintain work and social engagements, while I level. Once I hit 60 though, I intend to take a week off work and go hard. I figure that's the best plan of attack, atleast for me. :)
---
I'm having an OCD panic attack.
---
Not sure why wowhead says that. Itemization.info says that they're a release item, and they're always available from the beginning of private servers.
---
omegalol!
---
Good catch!
---
Thankfully sharding and authentic server sizes will prevent things like that from existing
---
Yeah bro, had a newborn so pc money was tight. Now she's almost 16...could pay her to farm for me lol.
---
Don't trust wowhead about when things were added, because wowhead itself was made in patch 1.11, so any item from that or before just says 1.11.
---
There actually is no shine on the screens from the window to the left.
---
WoW stopped being Wow a long time ago - it's just a way for them to keep the $$$ train going, by piling more shit on the original game, to the point where you can hardly recognize it now.
---
wowhead says added in 1.11 for everything because wowhead was started in 1.11
---
Just tel her that. Everyone needs time alone. We both enjoy our alone time.
---
This is all true, the sad part is however that 90% of all classic content creators and 100% of the classic content creators that attended the party in Irvine are clueless when it actually comes down to classic. Most of them didn't even know about private servers before Nostalrius and none of them have ever played vanilla when it was a thing back in '05-'06. They're just leeches and entrepreneurs that saw a way to make an easy living, read a couple of forum posts, spoke to some private server heroes, and jumped right on it.
---
Rrasons I have always played tank: love to support people, love to be durable and set the pace of the dungeon.
---
Reasons it sucks to be tank and I am reconsidering: respec cost, repair cost, bag space cost for extra gear and consumables.
---
I need to get a second monitor.
---
A bunch of boomer virgins should be here any minute to explain that their computers from back in the day were lucky to have 16kb of RAM
---
Heated? That better be a heated Kotatsu
---
Use your PTO but continue to go to work and play there.
---
You canceled everything you said out..all by yourself, they don't have a pattern
---
Minimum Requirements for Legion will probably be the same as Classic.
---
tough to stand for a 16 hr session straight tho
---
You can really tell you're in a circlejerk sub when comments like this are regular
---
!remindme 8 days
---
I think it's a shitty attitude to think that someone isn't "worthy" of creating vanilla WoW content if they didn't play the game 15 years ago.
---
You should be happy for new people to be able to experience a game that you love so much.
---
I also don't understand how they're "leeches" when all that they're doing is providing entertainment for people. If they didn't provide said entertainment, they wouldn't get the views or donations to make the "easy living" that you claim. What exactly are they leeching? 
---
And if it's such an easy living then why don't we all quit our jobs and start making WoW videos?

Be aware that reckoning won't work the same way in Classic, where mobs don't crit you when you /sit. Other than that, it depends on your playstyle. You could need more mana or more str, armour is preferable over stamina generally, but it depends how much and it is also more expensive to repair. There is no right answer.
---
I feel like some things are written just to add meat to the post.
---
&gt;AB: not much changes here, but 2000 points rather than 1500 gives teams a bit more time to get comeback wins.
---
This is here only to make the post seem larger?
---
&gt;5) Once addons are released for classic, hopefully they wont need constant updating &amp; changing. Its very frustrating when you have an awesome setup that you have used for years. Then a new patch breaks it!! :'(
---
On live, any larger addons will have its update ready on the day of new patch every single time, thanks to the PTR. Updating it fixes any breaking you experience. It's a non-issue on live.
---
&gt;Retail has so many tools given to melee that the skill floor is quite low &amp; the skill ceiling is quite low. PVP is so much more engaging with a high skill ceiling.
---
Someone else pointed this out, but this is blatantly false when it comes to skill ceiling. 
---
As for kiting, in the same way that casters got a lot of tool to keep melee off them, melee got a lot of tools to stick to casters, kiting is perfectly possible on live, it depends on who responds best to the different tools of the opponent. The main issue here is that melee need to be able to stick for at least a bit, because casters got the same levels of stamina as plate users since wotlk. This means if casters could keep melee away indefinitely, pvp as melee would be the worst. But casters got compensation in a much higher stamina.
---
I agree with some of your post, rest seems to be a bit of mindless bashing.
---
Or napping
---
Thank you for the vicarious feels
---
Ok, didn't know that!
---
It will definitely not run better than classic did, but that laptop will slay all but the major cities and raids. For those you need the best intel CPU with the best fiber optics internet. I am actually a computer science engineer and make games for a living.
---
Ikea, purchased 8 years ago. Couldn't find it on their site, so I dont know if they're still making this particular one.
---
My main monitor is 4K can‚Äôt wait to spend a lot of time playing wow classic at 4K with awful resolutions. I consume most of my media via phone while playing wow.
---
You gotta get a lot of gear to be good as ele. Like AQ gear. Hunter though isn't bad with basic gear since it's all about kiting
---
Nice ui
---
Damn that ui is fresh.
---
Holy shit that's dope. My setup is on two dinner trays with a laptop whose monitor or keyboard doesn't work anymore ppl and I have to run Wow on low
---
I use two and I very rarely feel like maybe a third would be nice, but I don't feel that way often enough to merit the purchase.
---
Probably wall mounted
---
When classic hits, it's going to be tough.
---
I'm sorry, but this room is way too clean to be legal.
---
It might be a pain if you share armor/stat priorities, but it definitely doable.
---
I got one too, wonder if we are going to get the collector's edition minipets in classic.
---
I'm pretty sure I uploaded the UI and serious files to one of the add-ons sites even had a few downloads kept it updated until first tbc patch when add-ons advanced by leaps and bounds.
---
I‚Äôm looking forward to playing alliance, I was a horde for life kind of guy and although I still prefer them aesthetically, I cannot pass the opportunity to relive vanilla with a familiar yet entirely new perspective. It will be amazing.
---
Are thoese the thousand dollar dumbells.
---
I hope that's for a lack of room cause you could've gotten a basic full squat bench deadlift setup in a rack for that price god damn.
---
He still has as even later. Nobody just cared to summon him. 
---
I played a lot 60 lvl AV during TBC and we used to summon the tree sometimes. As well as rams
---
Im pretty sure the requirement for classic will be significantly higher than in 2004 for reasons I cant fathom
---
They removed almost 700 000 unnecessary files, this is something that is done when a client is being prepared for distribution.
---
darth??
---
I think I started a trend, my bad.
---
The reason is pretty simple:   
---
Its a different game
---
embrace the difference!
---
How is this post classic wow related? r/shittybattlestations
---
Send to your friends, and let's all progress in the hype!
---
No 5 monitors, no horde or alliance emblem, no disco lights or statues. 1/10 downvoted
---
It's really interesting to think about.
---
Im 32 with a career as a developer. I make decent money.
---
I grew up with Frankenstein compaq rigs, and played a lot of WoW and D2 like that.
---
Now that I'm in a different situation, which I'm sure is similar for a lot of you... it's nice to experience the game on the opposite side of the coin.
---
Shhhh. It's better to let the children believe. They will find out when they're older.
---
Your connection isn't that bad. As long as you see other players it's fine :)
---
and.... who are you ?
---
I can smell the dry jizz...
---
Can confrm its old AV (1.5-1.7)
---
The addon gives the names of the devs that go for a leak.
---
Been patiently waiting for your upda...wait who are you?
---
sorry to hear that, hope you enjoy BfA :)
---
Multiple weeks of PTO saved up.
---
I'll be taking 2 weeks 80% off, likely working 1 day a week just to make sure too much doesnt pile up.
---
ofc
---
Prot warrior.
---
ye defo, i went with one 1080p 240hz on the left and a 4k60hz on the right best of both worlds :)
---
Lissandre with aftershock :)
---
Hoohooo I'm famous! XD Yeah that's cool man, thanks for the linkage!
---
nope, i dont need no fancy shit. Sleeper settup= best setup XD
---
That was an amazing read lol
---
Not having the quiver in the last bag slot is bothering me more than it should.
---
you gonna die my man
---
The red lighting looks pretty tiring for the eyes.
---
Multiple races are not a problem IF they are destinct enough.
---
Man I just wish they would have made the races more unique with stuff like the priest racial abilities for other classes .
---
I already have a 27 inch 1440p 144hz monitor. That sucker cost me 500 bucks so I was thinking of getting a cheap 1080p 60hz monitor just for displaying information while the gaming monitor games in full screen.
---
From the videos I've seen it does pretty well even in blues with spell power. Like PVP gear for ranks. So not sure I'd agree with you.
---
Well when I used to pvp in classic I pretty much had a different game plan for every single class and most specs. There was no stun lock 100-0 every fight. That would rarely work unless they had no cooldowns, shitty gear or were noobs. 
---
A good rogue makes it look easy but there is quite a decision tree involved to be efficient and not have to hide for 5 mins after every fight. 
---
Warrior / hunter / pally are the other classes I pvped on in vanilla and they were not even close mental difficulty wise.
---
I'll  still play on US servers cause of the friends I made before the oceanic server days.
---
vanillafriends.com
---
Yeah, Tauren Paladin LOL
---
Yeah, that's why there's "so many warriors". Their level 1 and sitting in org/sw
---
Well that sounds fun
---
But not on League IIRC.
---
Moar dots
---
Visibly upset about people criticizing retail lol.
---
Being realistic, classics skill ceiling is dramatically lower for most classes.
---
I had a p3 500mhz at the start of classic, it had some kind of "your cpu is too slow" warning during the setup but you could bypass it somehow.
---
Still managed to level my warrior to 60, but didnt play too much after due to raids been pretty bad.
---
loving these set up pics.
---
That was really suspenseful! You had me guessing the whole time
---
I wouldnt think so, some people who dont have a CE account would go mental if they cant get the pets :(

Dear blizzard: you are kindly invited to my party - all i wish is a release date
---
Be you boo
---
But then you can‚Äôt play WoW.
---
Alliance scum. Was hoping this ended with Hogger ripping your toon's head off and shitting down its neck.
---
Good job mate.
---
Properly OSC. What are the specs of the machine?
---
The release date will be announced shortly with August 27th.
---
I had 768MB ram back in the day, but I remember people running it on 256MB.
---
How times have changed.
---
Look at those speakers.  Regular Uncle Pennybags we have here.
---
You can call yourself a GAMER
---
Quite gay
---
We will miss you.
---
this is some opium den wow shit.
---
The best complimentary combo that would result in loot efficiency while leveling would be Shaman + Warrior. While grinding out quests you can deem cloth and leather to her and you soak up the mail. As for weapons until you learn from the trainers in UC and Org you are limited on 2h Maces and she can use 1h mace + shield. The best part of this combo is the utility of build choices. I would say if you are going to min/max the experience and speed level you would want to be Arms while leveling and she can be whatever she chooses. Just note that if doing elite quests or dungeons she will need a high int set to have a bigger mana pool for healing.  
---
The bonuses is this combo alleviates looking for tank or healer since you already compliment that role, and if incase someone joins filling either role you 2 would be flexible to fit another without much hassle. Once you hit 40 and go plate armor she will also attain mail armor so again you dont cross each others gearing up choices from new gear and you can prioritize loot based on stats.  
---
This choice seems to also benefit what you expect from the game 5 mans and 10 man raids in UBRS and possibly LBRS. I wouldnt put it past you to attempt ZG, AQ20 etc even in pugs and as for 40 mans youll be surprised how many pugs are formed once content is on farm.  
---
Final thoughts, i picked warrior since shaman is a slower class to level and since warrior is one of the slowest you get to increase the speed at which you both lvl when combined. Sure that may mean you have to grind mobs for quests a big longer or gather quest obj. in an area because theyre not shared but at least you'll be safe and going at your own pace.
---
WH OMEGALUL?
---
Sick.
---
My anxiety knowing that the game is finally here.
---
He quit Blizzard and went to Riot to work on LoL and fart in people's faces
---
I appreciate your entry anyways , strange stranger
---
Honest question, how do people see what files have been removed?
---
Is affliction the raiding spec?
---
What do we do now?
---
well, we will be playing with the same accounts. having my panda baby out would be #nochanges so i sure hope we see our ce pets again!
---
How do you like the HP24FW?
---
They dont call it a circle jerk for nothing. Get tuggin or get out!
---
The addon names some of the devs that the leak used
---
Don't know for classic but in vanilla :
---
You don't do both, if you change your skill tree twice a week you'll have to pay 50 gold each time, 50g is a lot of farming time.
---
No healer was able to farm anything, it takes too much time to kill anything.
---
Ghostcrawler.  The guy who wanted to play WoW with his 7yo daughter so he redesigned (aka ruined) the game.
---
Classic is a simpler game in almost every aspect. And that's okay. It does everything else much better. But to say that the game we have today is simpler than classic as he did is factually wrong.
---
Goodbye.
---
Yes. 35 was what I ment to type, my bad lol
---
I didn't play since the start of Wraith but from what I've seen and heard the mechanical skill ceiling is much higher in retail. Vanilla was a much slower and more methodical game. PvP in vanilla is very punishing since there are less "outs" and "oh shits", I personally like that. I'am a DotA &gt; LoL guy.
---
If you design a mechanically demanding combat system give me a \*real\* one, like we see in fighting games and similar. The cooldown based, tab target combat system is much better suited for a slow, RPG style combat like Vanilla had.
---
Just curious, but what makes it terrible?
---
Probably going skinning/mining.  I probably won‚Äôt get filthy rich this way but plenty of people don‚Äôt pick gathering professions or will swap to a craft at 60, so even hoarding all your minerals and leathers while leveling up might sell for a good amount once there are a bunch of 60‚Äôs trying to powerlevel engineering or blacksmithing.  
---
I have relaxing memories of listening to music between classes and doing laps around winterspring/ungoro farming for thorium veins and arcanite crystals.  In vanilla and TBC I got my max speed mounts by doing this for a few weeks.
---
If you are planning on raiding at some point just a reminder that while leveling as a druid is faster raid spots are in short demand. Typically won't see more than 4 and that's being generous then again some guild's are filled to form and won't care as long as you are a good player. I personally love shaman's and their mana efficiency. If he's going rogue shaman + rogue is a strong combo for elite mobs and dungeon groups when forming up. Nothing says clear speed like wf procs on a rogue with sword of omen after you clear SM.
---
My GPU is running 6 degrees celcius on average after turning off the RGB. It's a fucking plague. Heard about the SSD with 72 LED lights that run so hot instantly after turning on that it'll throttle down and won't be able to boot windows?
---
I only use it for discord/spotify/browsing. And for that purpose its great. Only downside is that its not possible to adjust the angle or height, but lucky for me its the perfect angle and height from where i'm sitting.
---
gotta stop talking like that about yourself champ
---
If you fight against someone at the same skill level the engineer will 100% win.   
---
But where it really shines is 1vX situations
---
Lmao, fuck off with telling me to chill out.
---
It's probably random except "influencers"
---
Wait until the silent generation comes and explains their punch cards
---
&gt; WSG: The older version without stacking damage buffs &amp; timers was 10000% more fun. 
---
It is not 10000000% more fun when a griefer won't give up the flag and won't cap it either. :-P
---
It's not a hill I really want to fight a trench war on, but limits to how long a bad WSG could drag on for were a real improvement in my opinion. It had no effect on the good games whatsoever and it made the worst games less awful. I don't want to be stuck in a one hour WSG turtlefest, and I don't want a deserter debuff for pulling the plug on one.
---
No, those are the Bowflex SelectTech ones.  They run about 250-300 on Amazon and other sites.  Besides, all that stuff isn't going to fit conveniently in that room.

Best tip i can suggest is be sure to collect every single quest prior to doing a dungeon run. Most likely you'll only need 1 run to complete all the steps. That way you can turn in and gain efficient experience and move on to the next area/dungeon. I can't tell you how many times i would have to rerun ZF because a buddy forgot to pick up a quest or didn't ask for people to share quests prior to starting the run. Some quests are not shareable and thus research and discover any prerequisites prior to clearing.

yea thats what I imagined, but since I know nothing specific about this stuff, I dont wanna pretend I do

I'm not upset about people criticizing retail. I dislike when people just make up things to criticize something. I criticize retail a lot, I don't have an active sub at the moment, I don't want to return to retail, it's not a game I enjoy, I think it have a lot of bad things and there is plenty to criticize. So why make up stuff that's simply not true in order to criticize it, when there is so much stuff you could actually criticize?
---
I'll upvote this just for playing with 9.8fps.

Two-handed-ace-wielding troll enhancement shaman. Nostalgia intensifies.

I mean DPS in fury / arms gear in tank spec- not ideal I know but when a 1-2 tank fight?
---
Could you link?
---
He's got both though
---
And it was still to this day the best game ever made. Aus vanilla player here
---
&gt;while being a hypocritical 
---
First of all, the wording is "a hypocrit". "hypocritical" is an adjective, not a noun.  
---
If you wanna try talking down to people, at least keep your grammar up to a standard that wont ridicule itself.
---
&gt;You are just criticizing him for no apparent reason
---
Secondly, The fact that **I want to**, is reason enough. I don't need another one.
---
Thirdly, I am not posting pictures of my setup, so your entire premise is nonsensical to begin with.
---
And lastly, I got spare brainpower to waste in betwene coding sessions, don't worry.
---
Dang, haven‚Äôt watched the full video in probably a decade. So obviously staged I can‚Äôt believe I never realized it back then.
---
Just feels like retail bashing now. Retail bad, classic good, AMIRITE GUYS?
---
It can. It's heals that don't crit.
---
Being simpler isn't even necesairly worse. It doesn't need to be complex to be a good game. Obviously simplicity can have negative aspects, I think it's far more satisfying with more modern rotations with a bit of engagements instead of 1 button macro spamming that a lot of classes have. On the other hand more complexion often means more tools, which means more answers, and less weaknesses - I much prefer the fleshed out strength and weaknesses of classes in classic compared to retail, especially in PvP.

Seems like a lot of retail fanbois on the Classic sub today.
---
Might be a thing in Classic depending on server size and whether/how sharding is implemented, but interestingly, this was not a thing in Vanilla.

It"s clearly in comparions(so related to) classic wow

No. Changes!

But yeah, I hope for a smooth launch.
---
Sure: https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-warrior-pve-tanking
---
Only one thing I don't really like about the builds, especially the build for raid beginners. I personally think that +defense is better than +10% armor, but it depends on gear.
---
Are you telling me classic actually have a higher skill ceiling than retail? Because it doesn't. The other comment in this thread is saying the same as I am, skill ceiling of retail is higher. And it definitely is. Both in PvE and PvP.
---
Thank you Chris
---
SM/Ruin and DS/Ruin are the most prominent. SM ruin is the more overall and less gear dependent speck while DS/Ruin deals more damage. With good gear, i personally would roll to DS/Ruin.
---
Here they are.
---
SM/Ruin [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warlock/BPzMfFMABOMDTAQ](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warlock/BPzMfFMABOMDTAQ)

Yes, that can be a legitimate complaint.
---
How did the ink not fade away after 15 years? What sort of black magic is that? I need to know that secret.
---
wish I could be a horde druid but also not be a cow ):
---
No, druid is better because he has swipes while the warrior needs to switch target to generate agro on each mob.
---
It's admittedly quite faded at this point, the manual has done a good job at preservation!
---
I really hope so, panda cub for life!
---
yikes.. no way I could play without a dedicated monitor centered.
---
I had 128mb ram during classic and it was utterly unplayable on the lowest settings.
---
My dad bought a second hand 256mb ram after a few months and holy shit I finally was able to play :D
---
I would emphasize that ds/ruin is more glass cannon and significantly more gear dependent, whereas sm/ruin will do really well as a fresh 60
---
It was best in Classic for Prot Paladins to spec Holy.
---
What a steal

11/11 you bought it on the lucky number. Better keep it

I‚Äôll never forget in 8th grade when my mom returned from Target and called for me to come help with the groceries. I get out there and she‚Äôs holding WoW for me because she saw me playing the trial after watching ‚ÄúMake Love Not Warcraft‚Äù and really enjoying the game.
---
Thanks mom. Still didn‚Äôt help my masturbation problem though.
---
Part and parcel to the "threat generation is garbage".
---
Thats hysterical
---
YOU KNOW I CAN'T COUNT!
---
It's definitely going to be August 15th or later. There's no way they're going to release Classic before patch 8.2 for retail WoW. They want people to play retail, not Classic.
---
Is it easy to reach def cap in raid gear I.e MC gear?
---
Oh I remember this bloodbath well.
---
I never had this happen back in Vanilla but it was probably because I was on a lower population server
---
Awesome post man, I love seeing these time-lost characters in modern day wow. Hype!
---
Yeah. Or picking one that dies within like 6 months
---
They certainly have :D  I bought my first Pc as a teenager, first big item I bought with my own money, washing dishes in a restaurant.  It had 4Mb of ram and I was unsure if I should upgrade to 8MB, which meant another month of wages :D
---
Great memories! Can hardly believe it's been 14 years.
---
You should stay in tank even if the boss only need 1 or2.
---
First your output won't be really improve if you dps with a tank tree, stuff wasn't as important as it is nowadays if you don't have a dps tree your dps will be awful. 
---
If you are with dps stuff and the main tank dies first of all the first two rogues and the real fury dies then you taunt and die then wipe.
---
If you're a tank, do what you are build to. Make as much agro as you can and take the less damage you can. There is 30 others people who are here to hurt mobs.
---
I actually have a computer with 4MB ram, my old 486 that sits in my moms closet. I've been playing around with Dosbox for a while now and when I feel like I know enough I'm planning to transition to real hardware.
---
Old computers are fun.
---
No changes!
---
Start later, but you probably knew that?
---
Very true point actually!
---
I doubt I can wait lol
---
Looking forward to meeting you in STV, mate:)
---
If I remember correctly, I wasn't capped even after our first Ragnaros kill. But not perfectly sure tbh.
---
Mine would be accidentally ending up on a pvp server that a streamer is on.
---
1. PVP SERVER != 24/7 PVP
---
2. Off server pop, is not a big thing
---
for 1. most players on pvp servers play mainly PVE, but the option for open World pvp is nice to have. 
---
for 2. a population ratio about 30 / 70 is not bad, u don't even notice it.
---
i played 2005 on Frostwolf - a German PVP server, with a 30 / 70 Ratio for Alliance (70), I'll played Horde, and i can say i had only benefits from it, 10sec bg queue, alliance was about 1-2 Hours.
---
on pvp servers there are some OpenWorld Ganker, but not as much as u think + but every fraction had its own areas with small overlapping, most of the time everyone mind there own business.
---
Literally hadnt thought about this once up until now, and all I planned to do was bgs at 60... 
---
Fuck. My. Life. For the first time, now I actually don‚Äôt want cross realm battlegrounds... :,(

This guy has the world record. There is currently no alliance guide out, but he said it's basically done and will be released the first day of the beta.

Then you can just reroll. Before you say "I lose my investment", you are gonna lose your "investment" anyway, classic is only about the journey.

Mount as a usable item rather than a spell :)
---
My mage will be herbalism and skinning. Mostly for profit. But I will funnel some herbs to my alt priest alchemists and leather working bank alt.
---
 My priest will send pots to my main. It will also be handy as a priest to give pots to the tank to heal himself as a fail safe. The bank alt will use the excess leather to craft and vendor for more gold.
---
The truth is, you will not be just playing a single toon. Your playing an account. So I have them work in concert.
---
Yeah. People gonna regret taking enchanting at the start since its a goldsink. But as the economy settels and you made bank. Its Great
---
I flew/layovered 14 hours, spent 5 days with my in-laws in a hotel, and waded through hours of graduation crowds for my brother-in-law to acquire the wife brownie points to do exactly this thing. 
---
I have one week to no-life the shit out of this game to get myself in a reasonably good spot on leveling.
---
Yes, you want a one hander. A fast attack speed is helpful too. You will be using SoR for holy damage on each hit. +Spell damage helps you generate more threat although the spell coefficients aren't great.
---
Protadin is actually pretty strong at getting initial threat in a fight. Especially AoE situations. Judge SoR on skull target and then lay down consecrate. SoR and then cycle through targets. If the dps pull aggro then HoJ their target. Use BoP if you need to get a mob off of healer or dps.
---
Reeee

Def cap is the minimum you need for not taking crit from bosses, it's not a max to reach. 1 def = 0.04% chance that the boss miss you, 0.04% of dodge, 0.04% to parry. 1 point =0.12% for not taking any damage plus 0.04% to block. In order to not taking crushing strike (150% base damage) you need a total of 102.4% with boss missing chances+dodge+parry+block that's the real cap, and no, it's not reachable in vanilla.
---
We all knew about dps warriors in 1.12 :P
---
That's from TBC, not vanilla...
---
The hardest part of being the tank is getting to 60.  You'll have less competition for drops in raids and pre-raid dungeons, so you'll get geared quickly once you are there.  The good news is that you'll have an easy time and faster time finding groups to do dungeons with on your way to 60.  You can even pick and choose which group you think is optimal as there will probably be two to three groups in every city spamming "LF1M tank SM then GTG!".  Ask who's in the group and the levels of the players and pick the easier team to run with.
---
Small wise choices add up over time.

Business is booming (in the US) so there no real reason to be poor right now.

You're not going to fit in with that attitude.
---
One thing to keep in mind that it seems like so many people are either my mentioning, or have forgotten, is that Enchanting can be quite expensive in it's own right off you don't have a friend/guild mate that is mining/blacksmithing. Blizzard streamlined Enchanting in Mop to only require Runed Copper Rod, but before that there were several different rods that an enchanted would need during their career. The only one that could be created entirely by the character in their own was the Runed Copper Rod, as the base Copper Rod was a vendor purchasable item.
---
Following the Runed Copper Rod, one would need to craft a Runed Silver Rod, then a Runed Gold Rod, Runed Truesilver Rod, and finally Runed Arcanite Rod. The actual base Rods (non-runed variants) had to be crafted by a Blacksmith, and the only way to craft Enchants with a skill level above 290 was to have the Runed Arcanite Rod.
---
To further frustrate the money making potential of Enchanting, all of the Runed Rods were learned from Enchanting Trainers with the exception of the Runed Arcanite Rod. It was taught by a limited supply recipe sold by a vendor in Moonglade, which meant that the pattern was often camped by enterprising Druids who would snatch it up to sell on the AH at a hefty premium.
---
Yeah wow doesnt need much in terms of GPU at least. im currently playing it without a GPU, just the integrated graphics the 8700k has.
---
Well they could just have gotten the CE back then.
---
Its Deliv-o-ry!
---
&gt;Retails skill ceiling is by no means lower than Classics.
---
I'm sorry I disagree with this. First of all, classes with Mana are very limited by their resources. When you are oom, you will likely die. You need to manage your resources very well.
---
Secondly, multiple ranks of skills, several dozens different engineering gadgets, several dozens consumables and a much more complex item system all make a very different type of gameplay than Retail. You also have long but strong cooldowns, and using these at the wrong time likely means a loss. It also takes some skill knowing how to avoid these as the opponent.
---
For real, as if staring at the monitor all day isn't bad enough
---
In preparation for long flights between cities i see!
---
How can the skill ceiling be higher when every class have infinite resources, a ton of cooldowns, very low access to consumables and engineering gadgets and very limited options when it comes to gear?
---
It makes no sense to me. My experience is that you need to be a lot more knowledgeable to do well in Vanilla PvP. Just having SOO many more skills per class as well as multiple ranks of each makes it a lot more complex to play the class right.
---
You also have very little room to recover when you mess up and having to balance gear with offense vs stamina becomes a huge deal.
---
I'm worried efficiency is going to tuing the experience for me. Part of what was amazing about vanilla was all the mistakes I made and all the long journeys I made because I didn't know about all the different modes of travel and the best zones to level and things like that. The world felt gigantic and unending and I'll never get that feeling back.
---
Love this Music ‚ù§Ô∏è

I always think of librarians. I guess I've known a few that acted like they were guarding a collection of ancient scrolls and not 20K copies of Oprahs latest book.
---
The likelyhood of a server being closely balanced is quite rare. I guess we‚Äôre all jumping in to random servers with no idea what it will be like in 5 months down the road. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll meet good people, make friends, and have fun wherever you choose though.
---
Lol no you wont

Thanks

I haven't played retail since TBC, but wow the armory is nice.
---
I‚Äôm going take it slow to enjoy it.  Play a few hours per night when it releases, and not go nuts.  I want to enjoy the zones and the old quests.  
---
Who knows when there will ever be an MMORPG experience like this again, don‚Äôt rush it.  Since BC, I assumed their would eventually be a game that topped WoW, didn‚Äôt happen.  Bird in the hand, etc.

We got a gamer girl in the house

Raid night when your all flying to menethil to get on the boat to go to Ony, and the boats leaving and someone is trying to run down the pier to make it and they just miss and jump into the water.

ya there's a whole lot of noise for oce servers but no real talk about battlegroups and what it means if the current live approach gets taken..
---
imo, and ive said this elsewhere - oce being in an NA battlegroup is a given, we'd just need the matchmaker set to only look for NA matches after like 5mins idk, we dont really have the pop to be completely cut off but at prime time local matches should at least be given a chance.... unlike live, where instanced oce pvp flat out doesn't happen
---
What are those golden disks and since you have two can I have one please?
---
SHAMAN!
---
Wow, that's a pretty shitty and unfair comment.
---
Im worried this time around say 70% of most pvp servers will be horde for the OP racials? probably wrong though.
---
Imo, if you have time for the gear grind of the warrior, it's well worth it. Not to say you wont have a good time without the gear, but being the most gear dependent class makes it hard to excel without it. Ive leveled a handful to 60 through vanilla and private servers and they're one of my favorite classes. Their dps is sick, and being able to tank dungeons and form groups as you level is a lot of fun. Just be ready to raid a lot or grind out at least rank 10.

Kiting is certainly more prevalent and common in classic however I have had a 2600 frost mage kite my demon hunter on retail through 6 gap closers and it was infuriating lol
---
Way to stay true to your roots brother!
---
Yeah, cool and old school nonetheless.  For me, I‚Äôll take anything Pre-Cata.
---
Not really. I love the fact that you can now play as all these new races like Dark Iron Dwarves, after gaining them as allies.
---
College, rent, and food. I don‚Äôt have the best job at the moment but do work close to full time. I‚Äôve never been in a great financial situation but I do see what you‚Äôre saying. I expect my situation to improve someday it‚Äôs just a bit rough right now for me.

i wonder what chris is up to these days...
---
Do you guys know if there is a BiS version for PvP? Pretty sure I don't want my Ele shaman to run around without a shield and in cloth armor :/
---
Or to have more than 3% hit.
---
I remember when they announced that both factions would soon be able to roll shaman and paladin there was some upheaval on the forums that I was a part of. Got a week long suspension for it. I'm glad we'll have the classes separated by faction again too!
---
This post made me depressed.
---
Reading a few bits of info- seems that it wasn‚Äôt a big deal compared to TBC/Wrath.
---
I'm saying that simply saying "retail has a higher skill cap than classic" is not really much of an argument.  Give some examples.
---
I‚Äôll level as arms but always tank. That‚Äôs good news!
---
So you just take the crits and move on?
---
The chicken is strong with this one.

Enchanting and skinning. When I'm 60 I'll drop skinning for tailoring

mtn dew actually supporting race divide and making people kill eachother in a grocery store smh
---
Lucky you with the 768mb. I played on the "recommended" 512mb, and I would trudge through IF with like 5-8 fps.
---
Having played both factions, I find both sides charming. I prefer the leveling experience on the Horde side. I also think Shaman&gt;Paladin, by fantasy alone.
---
I appreciate the fact that you can more accurately "inject" yourself into the world by playing a human, so Alliance has got the immersion factor for me personally. You feel more justified slaying an a Orc or Undead than you do a Human.
---
Comparing cities - I much prefer Orgrimmar to either SW of IF. The drums, the warm color palette, layout and overall badassery of OG can't be beat.
---
Bah gawd, he broke him in half!
---
I don't know who this Chris is, but I want to father his children.

Unpopular opinion: the video is pretty racist. 
---
We got a white dude doing "black voice", fucking up the raid, talking about eating chicken.  It grinds my gears that people want to celebrate this so much when it's not only a hoax, but a racists hoax, and bliz gave this guy a mic once or twice at a live event... Shameful IMHO, albeit unpopular.

Lol why? üòÇüòÇ
---
I heard that 2hand windfury is only about RNG and very gear dependant, but yeah it looks fun. I am more attracted by the resto and ele specs, which seem pretty similar when switching specs.
---
This just in foaks, the words "black" and "chicken" are now regarded as extremely racist!
---
Someone call the Alliance to get this troll outta here.
---
Kind of you, thanks.
---
Using my own :D
---
Best tip? Practise!
---
What made you switch from priest to R Shaman exactly ?
---
Some guilds bring them along as Nightfall wielders who also bring the enhanced totems from deeper in the enhancement talent tree. That being said, it's almost always better to just have one of your off-tanks equip the nightfall and get one of the healer shamans to sacrifice a few points to go the totem spec with the melee group.
---
are asians good at math?
---
Or when you get that one rank upgrade that makes you a living God for 2-3 levels. Mm.
---
Man I used a janked up version of nurfed unit frames until wrath, loved them

whats the point in having it if you never even looked at the goodies it has :S

He‚Äôs a real asshole. Loves to sit in front of the monitor when I need it most.

It's 100% speculation. The beta client was already some 45gb lighter than the retail client. This is not the first cleanup nor will it be the last.

Thanks! I don‚Äôt plan on leveling them or moving them at all. Maybe log in once in a while for the feels.

It's not entirely equal. They target certain hardware platforms. In the past, you had a much much higher chance getting into certain betas if you had a Mac for instance.

I think the one that stands out most is that the current minimum requires the same amount of RAM as the original required on the HDD. The modern client also now "requires" a keyboard and mouse, and a minimum display resolution of 1024x768.
---
I've been hounding Blizzard forever to confirm Oceanic servers but never given this much thought. If say after 15 minutes we join an NA queue, then so be it. No helping it  really. The alternative might be to not find a match at all, at least during off peak.
---
But what about the hot pockets and cans of mountain dew
---
You probably won't be rejuving anyone as a Druid. One druid (who has the most +healing) will rejuv the tank and then thats about it. Rejuv gets too messy as the newest cast over rides the last. It can result in a ton of wasted mana if you have a bunch of druids trying to rejuv targets. There may be some merit to having one druid on rejuv duty, but even then they're probably better off just doing healing touch.
---
Greg "Ghostcrawler" Street, guys a legend in my book. He did game design on Age of Empires before jumping to blizzard, and he was responsible for a lot of the development of WoWs community.
---
I didnt get much more either. I had an Athlon XP at 1.3ghz and a GeForce 2 MX (or maybe i had already upgraded to a Radeon 9600 Pro by then) and IF was about 10 fps.
---
Am I too old (27?!) to think this is waaaay over the top? A few RGB lights here and there is fine imo, but this is way too extreme. Not judging though, you decorate your room as you want it. :)

1.    **Content must relate to World of Warcraft: Classic.** This is not a community for private servers or current World of Warcraft.
---
Not really, block mastery (don't know the English name) gives you an extra 75% chance to block one attack for 5 sec. That is how you get rid of crush. But the more boss miss, dodge, parry hou have the less you'll have to block and the less you'll take crushing strike. That's the build i used to play : https://www.wowisclassic.com/fr/calculateur-talents/guerrier/X-2u-6Qe5DgDRr3i/

Oceanic servers definitely existed in 2005, that's when and where I started playing. On frostmourne
---
You‚Äôre going to want to switch as you level and get 300/300 engineering. 
---
1. Skinning and mining
---
2. Mining and Engineering 
---
3. Engineering and tailoring
---
Yes, but priests have a better toolkit, they are more versatile as a healer right? Apart from chain heal, do R shaman have the means to compete without being oom too quickly ?
---
The Devs have said it themselves. Classic will run on a tweaked BFA macro and add-on system.
---
You try to sound clever and high and mighty, you just show yourself up as angry and immature. If you honestly believe classic will have the same requirements as vanilla from 2004 then you're also pretty fucking dumb.
---
The client was already 45gb lighter than retail. It was hardly their first cleanup nor will it be the last.
---
&gt;Ret paladins don't even bring the utility that other non-optimal hybrids can
---
This always makes me wish they'd stuck blessing of kings so far down the ret tree that it made bringing one a great choice.
---
yikes
---
Yeah but if right now you lift you probably eat a lot but it becomes muscle - if you stop lifting it can become fat pretty quick.
---
Thanks, you convinced me
---
Collective Soul has a new album coming out in June!
---
No? Just me?
---
Okay, cool.
---
Yes sir!  Tire manufacturing with rotating shifts here. I have a few men at my job that play with me as well.
---
I randomly read all your posts yesterday i think. So awesome to see you got him back after all this time!
---
Don't drop the weights on the doggo while he's sleeping! 
---
And yes to echo the top comment level a paladin while working out.
---
I've literally never had that happen, ever.
---
Even less, about 5 gigs!
---
By talking about longevity do you mean a better mana efficiency and/or survivability ?
---
Im hoping they do another promo due to classic, but I know they wont.
---
no offense, we are all different and want different things in life. But thats my literal nightmare. Having kids and not being able to have a gaming station and a wife that wont accept me playing games for 2-3 hours alone in the bedroom.
---
Hey, it‚Äôs okay if you‚Äôre not aware of this, but there‚Äôs a history of white people doing racist, caricature impersonations of black people that‚Äôs about as old as the United States. 
---
It takes a lot of forms, one of which is speaking in an exaggerated ‚Äúblack‚Äù voice and saying things that draw on black stereotypes (such as ‚Äúblack people have an extreme love of chicken‚Äù).
---
If you want to read more about it, it‚Äôs called ‚Äúblackface‚Äù.
---
No, the 'jumpy' you're referring to is exactly what the issue seems to be. That would bother me. I may need to pick up some ceramic bearings to replace the ruby ones. :( not sure I would have bought it if I knew I was going to have to do surgery on it out of the box.
---
Who am I kidding, it's not like there's an alternative.
---
I got 7 days with 30 min naps each night, same as MOP release then free 2 weeks after normal sleep planned
---
&gt; farming Gnomer is going to be a complete non-issue in regards to "wasting time", it's honestly kind of therapeutic to just end your night with some chill music and Gnomer. 
---
I'd rather end the night doing things outside of WoW.
---
Sorry, it was late, I meant 30/0/21 ;)  
---
edited
---
yeah i'm not too fussed how its done, just feel like people are kinda overlooking this especially with bgs being such a "big" part of endgame idk
---
also dunno what else to do atm except bump threads and shit here and on official forums
---
Biggest factor in PvP is skill, which in Classic is a lot about game knowledge; where to get power-ups, how to gear properly, how to spec properly for the fight you want. The second biggest factor is Engineering as it is a blatant on-off switch for impressively powerful items and consumables. The third is probably racial abilities, but in a group setting like a battleground it would be a non-issue.
---
Well this is just not true. Bodyweight exercises are very legitimate.
---
Same, there's about 10 or so easily reachable keys right around the WASD keys, and I found it easiest to just add a shift+ to each of them, and a control+ to each of them. It gives me plenty of very easy to reach hotkeys.
---
Depends what youre looking for, big server with your faction dominating? Roll the same server and faction of a streamer you know will be playing classic 6+ months from now.
---
Your content is recycled trash ;)
---
I remember trying so hard for these... ran some many strats
---
Wait a bit, see where the big streamers are and avoid at all costs. Im pretty sure there will be sites to check ally/horde ratio.
---
What is this weeb wank station?
---
Oh yes, especially on US Servers. You'll get both a ruined faction balance and the fucking streamers ruining the server with their followers for all kinds of shit, events, witch hunts etc.
---
Hwy man! Ship it to me and this will become the most insane sleeper pc ever
---
When I joined the military and went from doing power lifting to body weight exercises everyday for months at a time my strength fell off a cliff as did my muscle mass. Sure I could do alot of push ups but that doesn't translate into raw strength or even muscle mass
---
Panda cub! :D
---
I showed this video to my chemistry teacher in high school. He bought the game within a week.

Wait are you saying you have a voice based on your race?
---
Even though old WoW was wildly imbalanced I still enjoyed the GhostCrawler "era" the most.
---
Guy did something right, even if the game was a bit rock paper scissorey.
---
Well yeah you can‚Äôt just do push-ups and pull ups. You have to change up your progressions and do plyometric type exercises, but I‚Äôm certain you can maintain/ build mass over time with proper calisthenic training.
---
One of my mates chose my bank alts name.... Banksnoobs because of Tanksnoobs
---
Launch date confirmed.
---
Oof
---
Not where i live dell were not common at all, must ppl had compaq here
---
Eeeeh, I disagree. A tank can have horrible threat generation but still have a taunt. Taunt won't help you much in a dungeon since taunt still has a cd. If you have a taunt you could still act as a 2nd tank since you get his threat level and hopefully ahead enough of the dps
---
He‚Äôs got a Chair!!!
---
My only dismay with Shamans is I dont know their usefulness in PvP. I know totems and what not but I hear they're not that great of healers. I hear they're very squishy and not taken in premades. Now feel free to correct me if I'm wrong because this is only stuff I heard. I never played Horde before.
---
How many big streamers are there?
---
 Also, are we expecting more than just a handful of servers? I didnt think there would be all that many.
---
i was hoping for FUNKYKONG but FUNKYMONKEY is acceptable i suppose
---
I‚Äôll listen to it. Most albums are around an hour long. Gonna need hundreds.
---
I‚Äôm doing the same thing. I‚Äôve never played alliance before so what better way to make classic really feel new again? I‚Äôm thinking dwarf Paladin or hunter
---
Yup
---
It'll absolutely gain traction, doobie
---
*Chris*
---
Lol this is definitely the epitome of bringing race into everything.
---
True, it‚Äôs pre BiS for hunters in phase 1 unfortunately
---
..really expensive sex dolls from japan
---
Sure you can build some muscle mass and some strength but you cap out at a certain level and you cease to make progress
---
You stop gaining real strength after about 10-12 reps. This is prety well established in the body building community, people dont train for strength at the 30 rep range which is typical of pushups.  After that your just building endurance. I know people who can bang out 100 push ups in arrow and struggle with a 2 plate bench because they never get any stronger
---
Watch them only give beta invites to active subs and 75% of this sub commits sudoku
---
I‚Äôve played WoW across three monitors and it looks amazing but because WoW scales horizontally for UI, all combat text and chat bubbles are enormous. Plus it‚Äôs a pain in the ass to have to reconfigure every window to your center screen. 
---
Here‚Äôs to hoping Blizzard fixes this for Classic!
---
Upvote for the cat
---
That's about all that can be done. I doubt they're going to say anything until they're ready to talk about server numbers anyway. Which is not going to happen until after a release date has been given.
---
heh yeah well uhh i'll beat u up irl nerd
---
I have been using the original WoW manual as reading material when I'm the pot for like... the past couple years, even before Classic was announced.
---
Yes, that‚Äôs why I said you must do progressions of  the movement. Like front levers for example. Let‚Äôs see you do 100 of those. 
---
And training for strength and training for mass are two different things. 
---
And actually you do not stop gaining strength after 10-12 reps. You can‚Äôt just broadly assume this. A lot of research shows light weight and high reps can achieve similar hypertrophy as heavy weight low reps in certain populations. 
---
The problem here is your referenced the bodybuilding community. That‚Äôs bro science, not real science.
---
Wall mounts
---
Probably meant that there were no servers in the region.  Frostmourne etc. were all located in NA still.
---
I needed 256gb according to the [original min specs](https://kotaku.com/world-of-warcraft-system-requirements-have-changed-a-lo-1638506551).
---
Was up to 1gb by [Wrath of the Lich King](https://www.wired.com/2008/10/system-requirem/).
---
Thank you for this detailed answer. 
---
I would probably never have the time to reach rank 13/14, however I heard that shadow priest were not really gear dependent and still very strong without good gear compared to other classes, is this true?
---
Do shadow priest bring nothing to a group fight ? Shaman have totems and chain-lightning which seems to be very useful, but shadow priest have some control and can dispel more than any other class
---
In term of viability in 1v1, would you say that both classes perform the same ? For example if I am ganked in open world, as a shaman will I survive better than a priest ?
---
BRB enrolling in college classes so I can fail them.
---
Classic uses the same textures and models so no size increase there
---
You can't go wrong with a hunter if you want to shine in solo PvP. They are absolute monsters in the hands of a good player. Massive burst and great survivability. I'm a hunter at heart, so my opinion might be a little biased, but i've never had so much fun as i did on my hunter.
---
Absolutely recommend my green chair. DX Racer Gaming Chair. Was around $300 but so worth it. I can play for 16hrs with no back problems.
---
Upvote for title
---
but why not open the thing up and enjoy the contents?
---
Literally never had that happen either, and you just let them die if it did happen?
---
Thanks man! Link for map is in comments!
---
Was this the old Gamestation in Birmingham City Centre? I remember that place, it was epic.
---
I dont stream but if I did I would play my games in 16:9 and capture in 1920x1080 so noone gets bars but me, to reduce bitching.
---
Fucking love that fan. Can oscillate in a figure 8 pattern, has a remote, and I plugged it into a smart outlet so I can turn it off and on with Alexa!
---
Links in comments
---
Remastering it in my opinion will at least bring more people into the game to play again on matchmaking. I've always wanted to  play the game for the game.
---
Its not ink, it's thermal printer paper.
---
That stuff fades pretty quickly if its exposed to oxygen, and even faster if exposed to light.
---
Now, stuffed inside a game manual, there was no light, and the amount of air circulation in there is zero, so not much oxygenization going on either.
---
Vanilla wow was the most balanced the game has ever been.
---
I‚Äôm developing an Alliance Quest Completionist Guide, currently complete through level 38:
---
Discussion of vanilla was low-key banned both on reddit and the wow forums. I'd spend a lot of time crafting well thought out posts about Classic and its design principles, and how they could be applied to the game going forward in a constructive manner only to have the thread locked. 
---
So... once again, the problem mentioned has its origins in the way Blizzard and the community responded to pro-vanilla players.
---
What's that druid doing on your desk?
---
Somewhere between stuffing your face with food all day and having a setup like this is a healthy middle ground.
---
I see so many great looking setups, that dont give a f if it actually is decent to play games on.
---
What UI you using there Oomchicken?
---
Check that Euro symbol m8
---
This is a big reason I could never get into professions in retail (despite playing quite a bit off and on from Cata to Legion). So many different mats and recipes, most of them functionally worthless except as a way to level (and then they put that thing into WoD (I think) where an item can drop that lets you skip all the lower levels of a profession anyway).
---
Plus, like, why craft my own armor when I have heirlooms? Why make bags when I have enough gold to just buy better ones off the AH on a fresh character? Why use potions or bandages when practically every class has some way to self-heal built into it, and is too much of an unstoppable juggernaut for it matter usually anyway?
---
(Maybe there's more of a point to them in endgame, but I was one of those people who spent a lot of time leveling alts, so that's my primary experience).
---
Actually there is some difference. There is classic option where you can experience it like it was before but you can turn the graphics up.New water effects are there, (not sure about) shadow and sun particles. Distanfe can be tuned like a lot etc. Google it. There is a differrence.
---
Everyone has their favorites that's for sure. I don't know if I would pick vanilla as my #1. It's a lot of fun and it is my personal favorite, but I think TBC, WotLK and Pandaria were all more balanced. Even though I enjoyed them less.
---
&gt;The problem here is your referenced the bodybuilding community. That‚Äôs bro science, not real science.
---
Yea but a few of the people I work out with are national record holders in power lifitng. The last time I was in America my dude was squating 975. There is a truth in experience
---
As someone who owns their own software company and works in the "sciences" I straight up disregard most of the scientific "research" that comes out regardless of the field. The vast majority of what I've ever read on artificial intelligence is objectively false if it isnt coming directly from a peer reviewed paper. Often when you read an article its a 2nd hand recitement of a paper that someone scim read and their analysis is fundamentally flawed.
---
MoP was the start of the healer-tank era in pvp which destroyed the fun of pvp.
---
My 9600pro exploded in the middle of a AV at the alliance bridge, before that we could see flyinh helm or weapon
---
why is it when people find these old videos they decide "im going to reupload this in 360p"
---
TOOL's new album is apparently more singing and less screaming, Maynard's voice is shredded so he can't scream anymore. Some of my fav TOOL songs don't have screams in them but that scream in the song Grudge is probably one of the craziest things I've ever heard.
---
Looks good! How‚Äôs that chair on the lower back üòÉ

The key to what he said was over time. Not everyone starts out on the same financial level. Was basically homeless around 5 years ago but now playing on aurora r6 with a 1080 and 2 Asus gaming monitors. Trust me it was a bitch but just got to keep on keeping on. And you don‚Äôt have to have the greatest job just got to not waste money on eating out and the non necessities. You can do it!
---
Ah vanillagaming pserver. Where every other character in IF is a r3 warrior
---
Oh, wow. Sounds nasty. Mine finally went out when my Mom inherited my computer when I upgraded to a better system. She had noticed sparks were flying out the socket in the power strip when she plugged it in, so we moved it to the kitchen (where her only grounded wall plugs are) and the moment I flicked the switch on the PSU, a streak of blue lightning game out together with the magic smoke. A friend later took it off my hands to try to remake it into a server, and after changing the PSU he noticed the graphics card was dead as well.
---
That machine served me well.
---
He hasn‚Äôt really screamed in nearly 20 years. I think it‚Äôs less shredded and more he is a senior citizen.
---
Druids are considered better than warlocks for leveling. As they have always technically sat right behind hunters which are top.
---
But this all comes down to the player.
---
It only matters if you are good and efficient with all classes evenly across the board.
---
But that legend of stalvan tho
---
Not at all. It‚Äôs Rock Paper Scissors in PvP. In PVE, Rogues, warrior, mages, are top dps where as specs like balance, Ret, shadow, MM in tier 3, BM, enhance, ele, etc aren‚Äôt very optimal in raids
---
I think a possible resolution would be to have one RP-PVP server for each region at launch, rather than trying to have one for each time zone. Like one for US, one for EU, one for Oceanic, etc. That way all players interested can be on one server to minimize the possibility of having multiple low-population servers after the first few weeks. No one has to wait, re-roll, or settle for a different realm.
---
It‚Äôs not a perfect solution, but a more reasonable one to ‚Äòtest the waters‚Äô.
---
Agreed I am going to play maybe 5 or 6 hours on my days off, none on work days.
---
Fantastic! I cannot overstate how much this chair helps with posture over long gaming sessions.
---
That's why I prefer vanilla's PvP lol. You can legit die in 2 globals and it's awesome.
---
Shaders and effects use almost no space. You would know this if you had any experience in computer graphics programming.
---
The Horde exists because you invaded our planet because you fucked yours. Why don't you guys just drink more obviously evil liquid and go on a murderous rampage again. Oh. Wait. You don't need evil liquid to do that, it's in your DNA to be monsters. 
---
If it wasn't for your Horde, Azeroth would be much safer and well off.
---
Can always server transfer if its rly bad.
---
And here's the first take  
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hmgrHohDGM
---
Frost. I have been following you for awhile now and your videos are so beautiful. There are often several times during your videos that I almost cry. Sometimes I am on the brink of crying during the whole video.
---
One more thing: Up until now the undead race has been out of the question for me. But here you come making the undead race seem cool to me.
---
Thank you for your videos Frost. Thank you for being you.
---
Aussie here! I‚Äôm going with US this time, simply because Oceanic never gets RP servers. EU means you‚Äôd be logging in during early morning server time. 8pm server time raids will occur on 4am our time. Be aware.
---
EU is ok, bulk of my mates are there 300 ish ping.
---
I saw them in Salt Lake City about 13 years ago and it was an excellent show. The idiots on the floor started moshing and Maynard stopped the show and said "Meatheads in the front row moshing, if anyone gets hurt I'm leaving..." Love how he doesn't tolerate dumb ass behavior and wants people to just sit down and listen to what he is trying to tell you.
---
Fury tanking is a thing that exists so you dont have to concern so much about the talent resets, unless you REALLY wanna be the tank then just go Prot and call it good
---
I would like to main tank, but what are the expectations?
---
Ok.  
---
I'm over here stating facts that are true about vanilla class "balance". Rogues are going to be very powerful in PvP either way. They are going to be more interesting, cool, and fun because of spell batching.
---
No tactical master?
---
Shamans are very good in pvp. They‚Äôre more of a offensive healer though, as they run a 30/0/21 build. They can heal well when needed but they really shine on burst damage with the heavy elemental investment. Plus when providing windfury totem for your melee, offensive dispels, and the shortest cd kick of all classes, they are a force when played well. And they are not squishy at all if you have mail armor and a shield.
---
I know kargoz and I are going to be doing 24-8-18-8-18-8 until we‚Äôre 60.
---
Professions will be fun and useful to level as your toon levels in classic. No heirlooms, leveling takes longer making crafted items more valuable and gathering brings some gold. Crafting professions will all have actual value, where in retail only a couple do. I'm excited.
---
I didn't even realize they were still a thing.
---
Good to know, I'll keep an eye out, I'm sure some peeps might want to get rid of it for whatever reason in the future
---
Apparently. Might be that the mods think i‚Äôm promoting private server use, which, for the record, is not my intention.
---
Wait, you guys don‚Äôt have phones?
---
It seems like I don't remember 15 agi being in the game at first but I'm not sure of that.
---
Some people still think this is real.
---
as much as i hate to say this, i think a fix to this could be on a server with streamers using alliance and horde. wouldnt recommend playing with them tho.
---
I look forward to getting a little stronger every level. Retail is such a mess with that. Welcome to 117, now you're weaker. Shoulda just turned off xp gains.
---
You shall not trigger me! Nice try! üòÅ
---
I played Wotlk with 512MB ram. Leveling and dungeons were fine but Dalaran and Wintergrasp were unplayable lol.
---
"Hybrids aren't viable in raids" is not a counterargument. The game can be at its most balanced without every spec being exactly equal at everything.
---
Druids are not faster than Warlocks. Pet classes are the fastest levelers for obvious reasons.
---
Ret pally memeüòÇüòÇ
---
I remember getting a pc with 512mb right before i started platying. Ran like a dream
---
The bigger factor is going to be your own burnout and if you can enjoy it. It doesn‚Äôt matter how fast a class is supposed to be if you pitter out and hate the class by 40
---
Reminds me how my friend and I stole a couple 256mb strips of ram from our high school computer lab so we'd both have 512mb and could play without it being a slideshow on our Intel integrated graphics.
---

Alliance is better in pvp because they have Paladins.

Where does one get a chair decoration like that?

Most if not all servers will be Alliance heavy so there‚Äôs no real way around it.

Totally agree

I have no idea if black dragonscale was in the game yet but the 2 piece is solid, and the 3 piece good if you can get the boots and avoid giving up devilsaur.
---
Lol, this whole subreddit has basically turned into r/battlestations, it‚Äôs pretty funny.
---
Frost ill keep this short, u are a cool guy. Thanks :)
---
REEEEEE
---
I don't think Shamans are that squishy, they can wear mail after all.
---
They also have a massive arsenal of utility, like kiting melees around and can interrupt casters.
---
As far as I can tell a lot of people have recommended the Shaman in PvP to me.
---
Frost is on this sub? Easily one of the best content creators for WoW out there.
---
Same field of view or do you see way more than an average player on a say 22 inch monitor?
---
What a weird Classic WoW you have on your main monitor lol
---
Who hurt you?
---
Wrong. Warlocks have no speed increase, which really sets them back behind druids. Druids also are extremely efficient and probably the least gear dependant class
---
it'da been nice if all the other ones said their specs too...
---
i have a theory that 1-dagger rogue is actually best dps but nobody's ever done the math on it
---
Okay this is epic
---
Well those are just some of the things. We will see.  I hope it won't be big as I first wrote. Time will tell.
---
Definitely a larger field of view

To all the people saying 'just eat less', ignore them OP. Lifting weights while losing fat will help you preserve and even gain muscle (not to mention health-benefits from the exercise).
---
Yeah the same thing I would use it for. Is it VESA though?
---
*Very* debatable. Also, OP said solo, not "fastest leveling". If we go by straight fastest, twink AoE mages take the cake. In terms of what class can deal with the most bullshit while leveling, it's Hunter or warlock above druid for sure.
---
Still better than playing Consoles
---
^^
---
The new models and assets will take up more space if those are included in the Classic client.
---
Oh yeah! The longest lasting one hit wonders every ;)
---
There may be a little confusion, but I'm not even necessarily implying just leveling, I wanted to include post leveling as well.
---
These numbers seem very off
---
Basic Attention Token. It‚Äôs a cryptocurrency created to be used in part with the Brave browser.
---
\#nochanges. Blizzard is not including content that was not in vanilla
---
I would love to, but my body is too old. It just wants to sleep at 11 pm.
---
Hunter can be strong. one of the most underrated class in vanilla.
---
its a skill question which class to choose.
---
Right? I can't wait to invest my time into something other than LoL and Vermintide currently. Can't find the motivation to invest time in a private server right now.
---
Hey, I'll count Shine and December as two hits!
---
Leveling a healer will help
---
These came out in tandem with the WarCraft Movie from ThinkGeek. Alliance is pretty easy to find still but Horde are rare and sell at inflated prices. I eventually want a horde banner for my wife‚Äôs chair as I played both in vanilla-WoTLK. 
---
If you get one I recommend steaming it to get all the fold lines out. There‚Äôs a bit of trial and error to get the perfect fit but once you do it looks great!
---
Wrong. Warlocks kill things much quicker and have 0 downtime because of lifetap. They‚Äôre also one of the few classes who can take on 3-4 mobs. Druids are actually not even close to Warlocks.
---
This is like the equivalent of when scientists try to do artwork of what dinosaurs probably looked liked but really they are only like 65% sure

Interesting. I just looked it up and I've noticed them trying to push the feature but I've mostly ignored it. I just want an ad-blocker on mobile in all honesty. I'm not really interested in any other feature the browser has to offer. Seems neat, just don't have enough interest to engage with it.
---
Do you use it?
---
Ah, rip
---
Btw what region?
---
Keep in mind that unviable specs is one of the things that made Vanilla Vanilla.  One of the main criticisms of Retail is the homogenization (sp?).  Everyone is as good as everyone else.  Everyone is viable.  No one is special.
---
I understand your frustration if the one spec you want to play is on the "bad" list, but it is the price we pay for a more interesting game.
---
I agree. One RP-PvP server per realm would be an excellent resolution üëç
---
League is going to lose a lot of players
---
No offence taken mate, it‚Äôs all good. I‚Äôm really fortunate, my 2 girls are brilliant, love spending time with them, and I‚Äôm well punching above my weight with the wife. Great job, nice house and such. 
---
I loved gaming when I was younger, but it‚Äôs not my life. I miss vanilla wow, and look forward to be playing again, but life comes first. 
---
I gave the wife a hard time a few years ago when she was addicted to that candy crush game and wouldn‚Äôt put her phone down, so can‚Äôt do the same when wow classic is released. 
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, when she‚Äôs out, and the kids are in bed, I‚Äôm playing solidly. Might even ‚Äúwork from home‚Äù a few days when I know the house is empty, and get some power leveling in....but the joy of this game is that it takes all sorts to play it. 
---
Can‚Äôt wait üëçüòÇ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
There is a vicious group of people who seriously expect blizzard to release classic with all bugs and exploits intact. Its ridiculous.
---
NA
---
It's all one subscription. They don't care which people play long as they get their $15.
---
Haha this was good.
---
those new BC arrows though...so dope :')
---
I‚Äôve heard of it but never used it. But your post inspired me to download it so here it goes!
---
Why all the clean battlestations now?  What happened to the ones that made me feel good about only having a few cans on my desk?
---
If it makes you feel better, this summer I will also be rocking the dining chair + but pillow with a small plastic/wood walmart desk while I'm at my mom's. :P
---
**SAD** EUW here :(
---
Pepega Clap good tests
---
LFG UBRS 1 DPS
---
I don't understand an alternative
---
I understand classic is going to be fun, but expecting an mmorpg to stay time frozen forever and make sure every piece of gear stays viable for over ten years is bonkers
---
Nice let me know what you think. I've loved the browsing experience so far. The ad-blocker works really well. My wife even downloaded it for iOS.
---
For sure, still is a ridiculously fun game if you don't take it too seriously.
---
Wrong.
---
Anything is better than sitting in a computer chair for 8 hours and eating garbage.  High volume bodyweight exercises are phenomenal for losing fat and improving overall health.
---
You can also "twist" totems to increase your viability as enhance.  You time your totems so that your melee group has both Grace of Air and Windfury up at all times.  This takes some practice as is mana intensive obviously, but it could be one more thing you bring that justifies a sub-optimal spec in progression raids.
---
Not really, their lists are pretty bad for pre-bis hunter, they aren‚Äôt even reaching the hit cap and don‚Äôt provide any alternatives.
---
Big lols but who'll be laughing when we're playing on switch ü§î
---
&gt;Classic setup &gt;WoTLK background. Smh.
---
Solo is rough.  Add a healer and you are great.  Add a windfury totem and you are godly.
---
Bummer! I've played with a couple guys from this sub already.
---
No not really. I‚Äôve not played a lock ever, but hunter was my main. You don‚Äôt get the tame pet quest till 10. You only start getting good shots as you level higher and use the talent points (ie to get aimed shot).
---
Pointless
---
Played alliance on SC. We got a small discord going if you're interested. Small but growing, alliance and horde welcome.
---
I played the Beta with 256MB or even 128MB and the Flight from SW to Westfall was like 3 Frames.
---
Faster kill time doesn't matter if travel time costs you more. 15 seconds to kill with 15 second travel is still slower than 20 second kill time with 9 second travel time.
---
Thanks, but mine is sitting to the left of me, at the same place it's been for the last 14 Years.
---
Random with a look toward the computer you're running. I think the only reason I have gotten Beta keys every expansion is my computer is a potato, lol.
---
I take it you did not roll a paladin then?
---
is that a leak for the next wow expansion after bfa?
---

My ZX Spectrum had 16 KB, and I'm a gen X!
---
..it was a piece of junk, though. I swapped it for a Commodore 16, and later swapped that for a C=64. I used that until I got my first PC, and I still keep it in the garage with a 1541 drive and a selection of floppies, because I just can't force myself to dump it.
---
Great video. Just finished watching it.
---
Titan Bar!
---
While your correct, that doesn‚Äôt make it the most balanced just because one of his points doesn‚Äôt make sense. In terms of PvP and PvE, class balance was best in BC and Wrath. Perhaps not as fun, it was certainly more balanced (save DKs which took forever for them to manage properly).
---
No druid, 0/10.
---
They do care, because Classic will not have an in-game store for pets and mounts or WoW-Tokens. It's a very undesirable business model from a "modern" gaming company's perspective. The shareholders were probably not very happy about it.
---
upvote for paintings
---
I didnt want them to get destroyed (I am very nitpicky with these sort of things), hence it just never got opened. 
---
And now I just dont want to open them for the same reason. Im just very weird that way, I can buy stuff and never open/use them or use things very carefully because I want them to remain pristine.
---
You can always tell who the retail whit knights are. They're the ones who are most butthurt and start name-calling.
---
It's in retail, added what, over a decade after the game's launch?
---
So were a whole host of UI additions which aren't making in classic.
---
Do you have a source that it is?
---
I dont want to open it :(
---
For PVE healing I would go shaman personally, I really enjoy the playstyle.
---
Herblism - Druid 110%.  Stealth is amazing for getting to hard nodes and avoiding the other faction.  Entagling roots is amazing for mobs near a Black Lotus spawn or if an opposing faction member is fighting you for a Black Lotus.  You can also do Stealth runs in certain dungeons for hard to get herbs.  As a druid (or rogue) you can do stealth runs in Maraudon for ghost mushrooms or RFD for grave moss.
---
What is this? You completely missed the -0.04% chance to be crit. Bosses have a Crit chance of ~5%. The def cap is a soft cap that starts when you have a 0% chance to be crit. The cap is 440.
---
Crits and crushing blows aren't the same thing.
---
It was in the demo.
---
They have changed SO much.  I'm not as well versed in hunter but Locks are a whole new animal.
---
Haha same here. Can't unsee!
---
Gooby pls. I didn't call anyone anything. You, though...
---
Oh they had a few (at least I'm the rock charts). I think they had seven number ones... They are just always called a one hit wonder. I love em!!

---
Classic is not a private server, you will switch to Classic WoW in the BattleNet launcher, install it and launch the game just like you do with retail.
---
Monitors don't match and the gap between them! Aaaah my head hurts!!
---
Well from my understanding they will be using a different client so most likely you will have to download it.
---
I'd very much like to heal in classic. I'm more interested in PvP.
---
However, I'm unsure what the best class would be to do so. What healing class would be considered most desired to heal bg's / wpvp?
---
Excluding paladin since For The Horde!
---
Are you gonna go to every single post and say this? What is wrong with u lmao. Relax.
---
This only makes it harder to decide lol. I see myself enjoying both classes.
---
1 slice 1 calorie right?
---
Ewwww thumb roller?
---
I would advice you to try a private server but nazi mods would come down on me like it was ragnarok. So definitely don't try classes on private servers *hint hint*
---
It‚Äôs hilarious and it always baffled me that there was a contingent of viewers that didn‚Äôt understand it was a scripted video.
---
I mean ‚ÄúI‚Äôm coming up with 32.33... repeating of course, percentage of survival‚Äù isn‚Äôt exactly a calculation you can make.
---
As cool as this is it's seems to so misrepresenting the classes. 4 min on an unknown boss/mob by unknown players of unknown skill levels. Maybe if this is measuring burst. Still, I'm assuming this is a mob that takes more fire dmg. Who knows what armour and other stats are affecting this. Wouldn't trust this at all
---
"Switch the realm list"? LOL
---
This isn't some shitty private server. You install the game through the battle.net launcher and run it from there.
---
lots of addons for a potato

Dell 27" 1440p 155hz freesync (gsync compatible)? If so, I got one too and I LOVE it. Upgraded from an old BenQ 27" 1080p and it's so nice.

Vanilla was anything but balanced dude lol wtf you talking about.
---
This is somewhat of an uncouth subject, but Rogues are unquestionably the king of unfairly killing other players, so what are people's thoughts on the best ganking spots? We all know about Lakeshire, Nesingwary's Hut and the various boats of Azeroth, but what other places do you folks gank (or get ganked at) often?
---
this is me every day
---
Yeah do you think thats swords or daggers?
---
Its obvious people didn't like the ilvl creep of past expansions so there needs to be a middle ground between no changes and replacing all your gear with new greens.
---
Client side changes are new content? We already know they are changing other things on the client side.
---
Just ordered a 2003 Toshiba laptop off eBay and stole a shitty wireless Logitech mouse from my office to get that authentic vanilla experience
---
Tauren Hunter, I see you are a man of culture.
---
Wait what....a rerelease has the same content as the original?
---
Regarding the warlock -
---
You put a curse up (usually Shadows, Elements or Recklessness) and some warlocks get to use corruption (not all).  There are not enough debuff slots.  Besides that you will be shadowbolt spamming.
---
Affliction is viable in that SM/Ruin is one of the accepted raid specs.  It has slightly (very slightly) less dps than DS/Ruin but you are much better at farming and pvp'ng as SM/Ruin (IMO). 
---
Shards - not bad.  Bring a full bag of shards and farm them on trash as you use them.  You will be expected to SS a rezzer.  You will not be giving out healthstones to the entire raid.  Your biggest use is if you Shadowburn bosses for extra dps.
---
Salvation - HUGE.  This is big.  Shamans get tranquil air totem, but you will never get it.  All of the shamans will be in a melee group for Windfury.  If you are lucky enough to run 8 shamans - sure.  In my experience on pservers I never EVER got tranquil air - EVER.  If you consume and are a good player you will 100% be threat capped on Horde, unless you have an amazing tank with Thunderfury or something.  The downside to Alliance is that in PVP you will be going up against a lot of undead, who have WotF.
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm just so on the fence because some people say gaming racer chairs are a meme and others say they are good
---
Second character... female night elf without primary clothing. ‚ÄúFappyFap‚Äù, what masturbation problem?
---
I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs not viable. Because at the end of the day any race is viable for any class. But I‚Äôm sure that for rogues, orc is the best race, hands down. I might be wrong, but most guides I‚Äôve seen say the same.
---
are you ok? if a video was in 360p when it was uploaded in 2004/5 you cant magically put it in 1080p
---
My bet is that they will have it like the OG Starcraft , and be treated like another game , but I don‚Äôt know
---
Scarlet Crusade here. Nelf resto druid named Rozencrantze. I miss SC.

Thanks for looking, I appreciate it. I'll scour the catalogues anyway and see if there's something similar at least.

TRIGGERED
---
I had an active subscription from 2005 to 2018. I got into the WoTLK beta, the Cata beta, and the BFA alpha and beta. Knew some people who didn‚Äôt have active subs who got into some. Really does seem random ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
---
Na, WoW, doesn't require much. But it will not be the only game I'm playing after purchasing the rig. Plus, epeen?
---
No , and no
---
Thank you chris
---
Truth. That‚Äôs why I order my pizza uncut and chickens whole!
---
Although a lot has changed, the basic "feel" and mechanics are unchanged, especially for the lower levels. 
---
Play both classes to level 20 but keep in mind that virtually all of the "drudgery" work was removed in later expansions. 
---
For example, Hunters used to need to feed their pets at regular intervals or they become un-happy and run away. Also, each shot with ranged weapon used to cost ammo, so you need to keep track of how much ammo you have left and craft more ammo. 
---
I didn't play Warlocks that much but if I recall correctly, many abilities cost "soul shards" and you need to create "soul shards" by killing enemies.
---
A desk that clean must be brand new.
---
I'm surprised the ink has held up so well.
---
I‚Äôm gonna puke it‚Äôs perfect.
---
They're completely different.
---
In general, on retail you have only one type of weapon, while in classic you have both melee and ranged, on retail you don't have weapon skills to level that make a difference and spells aren't resisted by mobs, on retail you have less and different abilities and talents.
---
Hunters especially use mana in classic (not focus), on retail you don't have to feed your pet not train it or level it, on classic you have a dead zone between melee and ranged where you can't fight at all so you have to move yourself accordingly, on retail you don't have it so the feel it very different.
---
That's what's on top of my head but there are many other differences that make classes feel very different between the two games, so if you never played wow before *don't* use retail to judge classes.
---
They wouldn't do it if thought it wouldn't generate profit.
---
Love your videos Frost, watched them all!
---
I still have some blue fuel in my mages bank
---
not only is it pointless, it's actually a bad idea.
---
on retail you can spam spells endlessly from 1-10 and everything dies in 2 hits, while doing no damage at all to you. it's basically bejeweled 3D.
---
if you get used to that and then try to play classic, mobs are going to wipe the floor with you.
---
(yeah)
---
there's an aboslute shitton of miss information out there especially about warriors, so I think you should take everything you read including this with a large grain of salt.
---
I can tell for a fact that: 
---
A) Arms leveling is the most efficient way, /sit spam is not possible in classic so 2hand fury becomes mediocre. 
---
B) You want to kite mobs with hamstring to reduce damage taken, as mobs should have way faster atkspeed than you and by kiting you elimate that as they can't attack until you have your attack ready. 
---
C) Spirit is a decent stat, it's not overpowered but it's not useless either. 
---
D) Generally try to stick with axe spec as axes are easier to come by at mid/high level but drops can change it. Try not to respec too much though.
---
As for DPS and tanking. Well private server meta which good guilds will most likely follow in classic, you don't have too many main specced tanks. In fact typically only one or two. You have fury warriors with good tank gear ready to put it on whenever a fight calls for more than 1-2 tanks. So you could main a fury warrior but be one of the warriors immediately called to tank whenever needed.  I have experience playing this role and it's quite fun. Though having to tank some bosses can be annoying if you care about dps whoring.
---
Goldmaking: This is definitely ways for warriors to decent money, some warriors do chose to have an alt character, however I would generally advice against alts only for gold. It takes a LOT of time to ding 60, and for just a bit more gold/hour it's not usually worth it. But if you want to have an alt for other reasons, picking one that makes good gold is a smart choice.

let's get you in here
---
Thank you! It looks great!
---
I was talking about pvp only.
---
Also only a complete idiot puts mm in same tier as ret, should I post my video of getting top 5 in four horsemen in retail vanilla? 
---
Marks was tier 1 in mc and bwl and tier 2 aq/naxx.
---
But it's not blizzlike to have a global channel...
---
It kind of makes me sad that a botter got their ban overturned if I'm being honest here.
---
Weird how 3 weeks ago this same post would have been tossed aside with malice.
---
Although I agree with everything you said, as that is what I want too, we're a long time from that.
---
We have a good 2-3 years of classic content before we have to worry about new stuff. 
---
Enjoy the project for what it is. Blizz has already said that they don't want to run two MMOs. They also said  they "will do what's right for the game and community." We don't know what that is yet. Just be patient.
---
Awesome. Nelf rogue here, Koz. The community on SC was amazing. Gunna be hard to recreate, but doesn't hurt to get a group going.
---
I played on a pve server but fell in love with pvp. Always regretted not being on a pvp server, so I will do that this time. Rolling horde this time too, I was alliance before. I want to embrace this opportunity
---
To gain 25 rage over 8minutes boss? Have nothing to sacrifice for tactical master. What would you remove for it?
---
As someone who has had this chair for a couple years now and had multiple 16 hour plus sessions, I would highly recommend a gaming chair
---
Pvp was most balanced in vanilla period, I spent hundreds of hours in pvp in retail vanilla. It was balanced around countering and getting the jump.
---
Pvp has been downhill since.
---
Classic is a way to get back people into their current wow. Many people will sub for classic then try bfa, and some will stay with bfa.
---
Is it not needed to stance dance fear? Or do you just bloodrage?
---
Forgive me father for I have sinned
---
Rock Paper Scissors is the essence of balance you utter noob. That is what balance is, you counter some, others counter you. It wasn‚Äôt perfect but so much better than pvp since.
---
Thank you! 
---
I may still take the trip to grab skinning before exiting Durotar. I think being able to skin mobs through Sen‚ÄôJin, Razor Hill May prove useful. Also I‚Äôd have much more skinning materials to help out with my ultimate goal of crafting Greater Magic Wand. The whole reason I‚Äôm sticking with skinning until I hit 40 is for extra gold and getting enough for my mount. After 40, I drop skinning and pick up tailoring.
---
He‚Äôs talking about kiting and that barely exists now, higher skill cap in vanilla for sure
---
How many hours have you spent in every other expansion? Because it seems like you stuck in the mind set of Vanilla &gt; all other xpacs and it seems to be skewing your perception because you haven‚Äôt said a word about how it‚Äôs more balanced. ‚ÄúCountering and getting the jump‚Äù seems like such a vague expression that I could use it to reference any xpac.
---
I dont understand why the only options are a poor workout routine or nothing at all
---
The standard is so abysmally low here.  Its not like im saying this dude needs run a marathon everyday, im just syaing he should put some legitimate research into a proper workout routine other than just doing random body weight exercises  for 20 minutes a day
---
Yeah, I agree with you. This sub has lost the plot. Why do people feel the need to pick the most mundane details in classic and hail them as pinnacle of mmo design? Retail does many things wrong but somehow people here always choose the things that are not the problem at all.
---
Wait, your pc set up felt cute and might pour liquid over itself later?
---
all hail potato, the true king of vanilla wow!
---
You plan on streaming classic when it drops? If so, will you be playing on the 21:9? What will your format settings be like for OBS to ensure a high quality stream for your viewers. I really want a 21:9 monitor but I also want to start streaming.
---
Huh, Bismark is actually a pretty cool name for a hunter.
---
It was actually a real event! They found pretty funny after the fact so they decided to recreate it.
---
the class design nowadays is NOWHERE close to what it was back then, and neither are the spells that you have at that level, dont waste your time testing classes on retail to see what you like more because they feel very different from what they will be in classic.
---
All is is forgiven and all is well..
---
Except for the fact that I‚Äôll be bootcamping vanilla on a Macintosh iBook, I didn‚Äôt get a PC until wotlk...
---
No changes.

Haha faps

It looks like you want a class that excels at everything. If that¬¥s the case, play retail. Every class in Vanilla is very oriented to be good at one or two things. You want a class that deals a good amount of damage, has a lot of survivability, can heal, is wanted in PvE and PvP, can farm gold easily, is easy to play, is good at 1v1 and is able to win a lot of 1v2.
---
Ok, let¬¥s dive into it. Both of these classes will give you what you want to a certain degree but it won¬¥t be for free. To be able to gear up a Shaman or Priest you will have to willingly sacrifice equip as a damager to every other damage dealing class in the game that is not A) a hybrid B) can wear that item...and you will heal through most of the game. If you can do that and spent literally hundreds of hours running raids, knowing that all that equip that drops that you want for your PvP damage spec is not gonna be yours is frustrating. 
---
There are tons of great trinkets, cloaks, rings, necklaces and weapons that you will have to give to a fellow warlock or mage that it¬¥s gonna torture you inside. Add to that there is a few mages AND warlocks in each raid group, you will need months to gear up a hybrid as a damager. Even if you play as damage dealing class - shadow priests will get their eq last - unless you are a guild master or a very good friend of a guild master. Ele is more useless than a shadow in the raid environment.   
---
Now if you are willing to do this, you might as well be willing to open an instant Pserv, create both chars and play them for a few days to get the feel of each of them. Then you can easily decide which one you like the most.
---
I don't have bfa nor any plans to buy it. They will get my sub only because of classic. I'm sure that I'm not the only one. Depending on classic after naxx, I will either cancel or keep it.
---
at least get a mousepad, or an old book or something, whats the point of having a decent mouse if youre going to use it like that lol.

I leveld a onehanded rogue to level 34 or smth like to try it out, it's great until level 20 but then u rly miss that 2nd weapon, i could imagine that it gets better in endgame again tho.
---
things to expect are: ninjalooters, rogues in gurubashi arena waiting for you to jump in, get killed on a ship just after it crossed the ocean, get ported to certain death by a friendly warlock, /spit macro, chain reaction after killing opposite fraction while leveling or in farming zone, opening the way to chest for someone else to take it, low level pvp champs(19/29/39..), backpedal, keyboardturning ppl and movementg√ºnthers, arathi basin flying rush from lumber mill to blacksmith with noggenfogger, hunters jumping from balcony in LBRS without getting rid of their pet and pulling everything... and for everything else there¬¥s mastercard
---
No one else in IF 39-45 lol
---
Bloodrage, I don't care about loosing rage, first when the boss will hit me i'll gain my rage back and i'm often low rage
---
Can't believe we're getting a new Tool album 2 days after Classic release. Crazy!
---
Very cool story. Back in the day I‚Äôd have been happy to see a botter lose their account. I was young then too. ~15 years down the road we‚Äôve all grown up and learned a bit. I‚Äôm glad to see you got your account back! I just can‚Äôt believe how long blizzard stuck to its guns! Good on you for sticking to yours even longer. You deserve to be rewarded. In the end you put in more effort to get your account back than botting saved you in leveling!
---
Chilli is a chance on hit aoe cone attack, so SoL there. You do have Ret aura from paladins though
---
At least he had chicken.  I wonder what that guy is doing today?
---
yeah, seriously. Who is the real racist here? The people who make no assumptions and enjoy entertainment (at no ones expense, lets be honest here), or the guy who is starting a fight over ‚Äúblack voice‚Äù (like what even is that?)
---
We‚Äôll they are fucking retarded then. 
---
There is no solution to having a gear reset each expansion. That isn‚Äôt the problem. The problem is wow expansions are designed for the max level and the current ‚Äútier‚Äù. Since Wrath, there has been 0 reason to go to previous raids‚Äîulduar came out? Guess I‚Äôll never go to naxx again. On vanilla and sorta Bc, skipping content is hard if not impossible. Going into aq in pre bis‚Äîis going to be a bad time. You have to go through mc/ony/zg/bwl to get the gear for aq. 
---
The profession bit he complains about is the same for classic as it is for retail‚Äîexcept for herbs in classic. No level 60 used light/medium/heavy leather. No level 60 had an interest in silk or mageweave, but to sell. 
---
Subsequent wow expansions added just a new max level cloth‚Äîthat doesn‚Äôt feel as complex as offering a new suite of clothes. In Vanilla whether you used it or not, you had linen, wool, silk, mageweave and runecloth‚Äîit felt cohesive. In wows ‚Äúcurrent tier‚Äù paradigm since, you get 1 cloth for the expansion, 1 raid per tier, etc. 
---
It feels less like you progressing through the game, and more like the game is progressing around you.
---
You can tell I was a real expert because I had auto attack bound to 1.
---
Corby! No way man hahaha! Thats my hometown, that GameStation is still going, one of my friends works there
---
I started on a pve server on tbc. My brother was already on that server. And when he started, his friends were already on that server. I feel like I missed out on a lot. Not only not playing at launch (was playing baseball in college and decided not to play any video games)... But all that glorious Pvp.
---
Orc Hunter. My body is ready!
---
I don't understand your focus on cloth when it's everything that changes when new expansions come out.
---
Not only char levels are added, but also all crafting is revamped with new levels, new recipes and new mats, and gear is reset as well. Classes change too and often you have to relearn them.
---
I agree it will be nice to not have to throw away you progress in whatever you're progressing every 2 years.
---
Same with TBC, I believe. You want mitigation gear, and then a caster 1h (and wherever you can slip in +dmg on a trinket or other slot).
---
But it wasn‚Äôt racist...? Just because you some how find a racial disagreement in something 10+ years ago doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs somewhat valid.
---
You are a vacuous shit stain ;)
---
Hmm, wonder if that works in bear form
---
A great day for them to give us the release date.
---
You know you swing with your offhand whether you have it equipped or not right? Or do you mean just not ever training dual wield?
---
I should have specified better, it looks like one of those animated still shots to me haha
---
Its not an addon its in settings
---
Game Fuel was the best Mountain Dew flavor ever.

If you are focusing on levelling use instant on both. If you are focusing on PvP use crippling on both. And if you‚Äôre levelling in a contested zone use instant on MH and crippling on OH.
---
Uhm, no that's not blizzlike at all
---
World chat makes the game far more convenient and leaves the city to those who are actively engaged in commerce or visiting for quest/travel reasons. This results in a more active world, which is a good thing in a MMO.
---
As a fan of World PvP, the global chat is a godsend. I can be out in the world, farming or fighting, and still be a part of a forming dungeon or raid group while monitoring the economic activity I could be doing at any mailbox. Global chat makes the world more active instead of just the area near the auction house in a major city, and that's a very good thing to have.
---
#Nochanges aside, World chat is simply better for the game. If you don't like it, either set it up in a separate window or leave the channel entirely.
---
YOU'RE a vacuous bully ;)
---
That I dont know,Im guessing not
---
Boy it's almost like more endurance based exercise is just as valid as strength based exercise so long as bro-science hasn't rotten your brain
---
Because not everyone wants, or is physically able, to go full HAM into a gym routine.  If we're talking about people who played Classic back in the day, you've got people on the older side, with families, full time jobs, etc.  I'm not personally targeting OP I'm just saying people in general.  They might not be in the best of shape to begin with, or have physical limitations that prevent them from keeping up with a strenuous strength routine.  When you factor in diet, you add even more work.  Prepping your meals every week, tracking your macros, planning your meals, that shit is fucking exhausting, but pretty much essential if you're serious about making progress in the gym.  
---
All I'm saying, fitness doesn't need to be this exclusionary hardcore experience for people to make progress.  If someone is starting from less-than-stellar physical shape, then cutting back on problem foods, drinking more water, maybe starting and ending their WoW sessions off with a walk/jog around the block and a rigorous bodyweight circuit, will do wonders for their physical well-being over the long term and something that doesn't require a lot of extraneous effort, and something that is a lot more tangible for the average Classic fanatic.
---
I see a grateful dead/truckin reference and upvote.
---
Honestly rogues were the hardest class for me as warlock. Much more even fights against warrior. A good rogue can punish a lock unless the lock is soul link or really geared.
---
I know it wasn‚Äôt this bad on tv. You could barely make out facial features in parts of it.
---
How is it a higher skill cap when certain classes (warrior) just cant do shit?   
---
Its more rock paper scissor, which personally I find more fun, as it creates a whole different dynamic (coupled with gear actually mattering) that is way more engaging. But the skill ceiling is not higher. Like, just no. I find it hard to believe that anyone with even a remote idea of high level retail pvp would think that.
---
What would be the point of improved backstab in a swords build? The OP asked for a swords build üòÇ I just feel that you lose too much utility in exchange for nothing‚Äîswords will outperform daggers pre-raid bis. And the murder/evis is still interchangeable. Tune into the LMGD video for info on that. üôè
---
You paid with exactly ¬£32.99 in cash?
---
Even with a succubus?
---
I asked myself what would be the most fun and rewarding, complete char on a PvP or PvE ? And I always end up with the PvP server.
---
Blizzard uses the same assets that were in vanilla. I highly doubt they remodel and retexture before release
---
I remember world defense. Not global, however if it‚Äôs not there I‚Äôm sure people will just type /join WorldChat or /join Global
---
You don‚Äôt need 1/2 the consumables pserver players claim you do in order to clear naxx.
---
yes, instead of 27 hitcap or smth u will have like 9
---
You wont build nearly as much muscle
---
You wont build nearly as much strength
---
You wont nearly as many calories
---
I fail to see how its "just as valid"
---
Yeah and it's actually quite disgusting what they've done to my lock.
---
Nochanges
---
As someone who mained a hunter in vanilla, world pve were strong, pretty good in pvp. Due to scaling though we fall off a cliff in raids and the like.
---
Yes and those would be gigantic issues if OP had to hunt down a woolly mammoth for his dinner
---
I'm late to responding to this thread, but I'm kind of shocked by the results. While I'm not surprised by the tank disparity I am shocked at the overall count of shamans as many are touting them as the best healer. This graph shows priest as almost double the number of shaman. Sure, you can equate this to shaman only being horde side, but we are speaking DOUBLE here. That is a crazy number to say the least. 
---
Also worth mentioning 70% are not even subbed. Now don't get me wrong. I didn't expect many current subscribers to be on this poll at all, however this is almost a 75% discrepancy. Pretty telling of the how people view the current state of the live server and poses a good future for classic moving forward. Adding this to the whopping 50% that reported having played BFA... Yeah not looking good for live reception. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not bashing BFA I enjoyed it (kind of) until I reached the dang near year long content drought with only raiding to do for my guild. However, it comes as a shock to me that the doom and gloomers may be on to something about the game's current live state. Along with this I  am shocked by the amount of people that hung in until BFA, this is just from personal off-hand experience but the killing point for most people I know was WOD which shattered my guild and left us grasping for straws during legion.
---
I am calling BS on the amount of "Vanilla" players though. A lot of people reported themselves as 18-24 and would not have even been able to reach their daddy's keyboard on the desk at this point, and some were probably unaware of what WoW even was at like 12 years old. You would have to be around my age or late (29+) to have fully experience WoW and even then you'd have been casual (Unless you dropped out of high school). 
---
I find the "content" section interesting and found the poll to be a bit wonky here. A lot of quests required grouping/social interactions I think these could have been lumped together personally. I was also shocked to see dungeons and raids as the highest weighted results as live is basically a 100% dungeon/raid focused game unlike vanilla/classic.
---
I'm personally shocked there weren't a little more percentages towards PvE even though I knew it would be primarily PvP dominated results.
---
Yup, thinking about GC really makes me appreciate Ion
---
If your going to spend 1 hour per day exercising why would you choose an inefficient method?
---
You spend the same amount of time and energy regardless why not get the greatest output?
---
It‚Äôs on a patchwork spawn...
---
Classic is literally dead until release so it‚Äôs kind of ironic to call retail dead
---
All you do now to close gap is spam your movement abilities, in vanilla as a warrior you can use many different items and trinkets. Ye it is unfair sometimes but there is so much more potential here, with outplaying and out of the box ideas
---
Shadowpriest dos not rly need alot of gear to kill noobs that is right, i killed very geared ppl aq40/naxx geared ppl in blues, if the class is wrong + the player bad shadowpriest can do alot, if its a UD priest.
---
But it can be very daunting against good players, its just the nature of shadowpriest, you "tank" alot of dmg if the player is bad you will just tank the dmg and leech up again. 
---
I mean its a big diffrence between someone that knows how to do dmg and just never enters fear range, or a hunter or mage that happly runs into you to get feared.  
---
If the player is good he knows how to deal with SP that can result in very frustrating fights since your toolkit is kinda limited, for example my zg/t1 mage beat a full aq40 geared shadowpriest easly, and i am a very bad mage player, i just did know how play and pve gear is very bad for sp pvp.
---
Shadow gos OOM in group fights, dots gets despellt. Shaman has insane burst and a good geared played ele shaman is wanted in every premate group. 
---
I think you vastly overestimate shadow controll, yes you have a blanket silence and a fear, but the fear is melee range and  can be done by a heal priest too. Shadow has very bad controll over a fight.
---
A blanket statement about 1v1 quality is just wrong to make, both classes are very good, and have weaknesses, if you get ganked as a priest, you can be in a situation where its no sweat at all, or you just blown half of your mana on a mob, shit happens now you wont have mana to kill a decently geared guy.
---
Same with Shaman.
---
And even if you just look at 1v1 duel case its hard to say what class is better, its depending on what gear can i get, what gear/class dos my opponent have. With BiS Gear i would say Shadow is a small bit better because ele shaman BiS Gear is so weak. 
---
But you need to think about here what are my sources of gear, a shaman with t1/t2 and a nice weapon can be very fun and be very strong.
---
Gearing a Priest just from pve is very hard on the other hand because what should you do go for something like that ? :

---
Jea good luck convincing your raid to get you these stuff and then you still have very low hp, and will die before you can rly do anything. I mean you basicly need a raid that lets you raid as shadow and even gives you "pvp" items that are not BiS to not be a walking oneshot. Basicly the only easy thing you get as a shadow is your weapon.
---
While the shaman example looks way more realistic because most of the pices are you t set, so you can basilcy just get them as a healer, jea the weapon maybe a hard one but hey its a mace, and with effort it can be even more insane:

If your lucky and the rogue doesn‚Äôt sap you and kill the pet super quick. You can catch people with it sometimes, but if UD or trinket out of charm, they can vanish and sap and kill the pet. In WPvP, you can catch people though with succubus but it also depends spec. Sometimes as destro or demo I would run succubus or double void from fel dom. As affliction, you gotta use the succubus different but I guess you get some slows/better dots.  But there were plenty of times I got completely jumped and stun locked by a rogue not able to even sac my void or didn‚Äôt have succubus out.
---
The warrior one is extremly off mostly because there was no execute phase
---
Also some classes such as fire mages and Warlocks are very limited by their high threats, a fire mage will have to be afk half of the time to wait for threat.
---
You also miss out on offhand swings (boosted by snd), poison application, and the stats from the offhand. Hoping mage girl does that math.
---
I rolled a dwarf warrior. Dun Morough was the shit
---
Not at all, not even for a single one of them. Every class has such vastly different abilities and how they interact with each other now.
---
You mean the "What should i play wednesdays?" post? OP is not asking what he should play? Can you at least read the post before you copy paste mr. internet janitor.
---
no changes...
---
Yet another torn player here. Shaman or warlock?  I really enjoy the utility and pets on warlock, but I understand lfg will be super easy as a resto shaman. As far as understand they are both pretty solid PvP classes. I enjoy healing and dps. I really need to be convinced.
---
Fuck... I'm going to end up owning someone Reddit gold. :(
---
as i said Backstab is for veal only, as you get the buff for energy and will outdps swords, maybe you should read. we're talking about 100% pure raids.  
---
to be fair i would never follow LMGD, he's ok but if he says that specc is best, he is in fact still clueless,   
---
Murder is better then evis, your dmg comes from auto hits, and you maybe use 1-2 Eviscerate √° boss. as you go 3cp s&amp;d -&gt; 5cp s&amp;d,  and keep s&amp;d up,
---
I'm tellin' yall...we are getting the release date in less than a week.

Get Ironfoe, or Flurry axe, stick to 5 man tanking, host and heal your own MC pugs  and reserve bindings, get thunderfury, get t2, win game
---
Nude...its the only way to go ....
---
Ok ponyboy you could say that argument with literally anything and it becomes stupid:
---
"If you're going to spend 1 hour per day enjoying yourself why would you choose to waste it playing Classic WoW?"
---
"If you're going to spend 1 hour per day watching TV why woulden't you instead read Immanuel Kants *Critique of Judgement* and actually learn something?"
---
"If you're going to spend 1 hour per day exercising why would you listen to music when you could instead be leaning Portuguese through this podcast?"
---
Like yes, everyone acknowledges that they technically could do something whatever percent more "efficiently". You don't live your entire life 100% efficiently, because for most people that's fucking stupid and kind of defeats the point of living your own life. Barging in here saying "OMFG HE DOESN'T EVEN COUNT HIS MACROS AND MICROS WHATS THE FUCKIN POINT XDDDDDD" when most people are just normal human beings about it saying 'lol nice' just makes you look like a fucking idiot lmao
---
This really has nothing to do with classic and more so to do with how shit retail is.  A lot have been saying it‚Äôs garbage since cata, and the sub numbers showed that.
---
It really is tho lol with or without classic I‚Äôd still call retail a garbage can
---
Your post history is quality.
---
I think there is great value in zone chat. When the only strangers available are going through the same things as you there is a common bond. 
---
That said, I wouldn't break out the pitchfork if global were implemented.
---
Apes mongoloid detected
---
So was LFG and a whole bunch of other stuff. I was going to mention the demo as something to not use as a barometer, but I figured everyone knew by now the demo had a whole host of stuff from retail in it.
---
A lot of that stuff got removed.
---
Mmmm, tooth rot.
---
&gt;You've got people on the older side, with families, full time jobs,  
---
I started my own software company in my free time while working a full time job. I worked out  during my lunch breaks at my 9-5.  You do people a disservice when you give them the excuse that they're "too busy". I Haven't worked a normal 9 hour day in years. This idea that anyone is "too busy" to get things done is just an excuse
---
I don't say this as some sort of a brag but there is something you have to accept, you are never as busy as you think you are and you waste way more time in your life than you think you do. If you cut out all the wasted time you end up with a massive pot of time to reallocate 
---
&gt; All I'm saying, fitness doesn't need to be this exclusionary hardcore experience for people to make progress. If someone is starting from less-than-stellar physical shape, then cutting back on problem foods, drinking more water, maybe  
---
45 minutes of an intense focused routine 5 days a week is something everyone is capable of and can be scaled to any physical capabilities. I really dont believe theres a reason to ease your self into it, thats just a form of creating excuses for failures and laziness
---
On weekends I can play during kids nap time and after they go to bed so 6hours if I'm lucky.
---
Seeeeegaaaaa üéµ
---
I followed my frends to a standard PvE server in Vanilla. Had a blast, but still feels like a tragically missed opportunity. At some point after TBC, I tried a rogue on a PvP server (because I was a cowardly carebear, indeed), and loved it. 
---
I'm gonna' go all-in this time and roll a Hunter on an RPPvP server. Hoping that not being able to disengage at will will not ruin the experience.
---
Still going Alliance, though; ain't about that fugly life. Also setting up ambushes (real ones, not that rogue crap) with traps, a stalking cat pet, and a shadowmelded NE sounds like too much goddamn fun. Also going to have a NE Priest alt, because I want to be the asshole that MC's you off the cliffs at the LM.
---
Orc imo way better than Tauren. The amount of times not being stunned vs having an aoe stun for like a second to win a fight happens a ton. The stun resist
---
Is just so huge for orc it‚Äôs hard to look beyond it.

Awesome!

The argument is that if he is already giving an hour to working out why not work out in the most optimal way.  I want him to get the most out of his workout and not just waste his life being overweight and unhappy
---
The difference between me and you is I legitimately want people to succeed and not encourage them to do retarded meme routines for a week and ultimately end up in failure and worse off in the end with the notion that working out just doesnt "work for them"
---
Compassion kills people
---
Agree to disagree my friend.  It doesn't have to be all or nothing in my opinion.  There's a massive area in between, and with the key word of consistency, any steps taken towards improving your wellness over the long term are worthwhile.
---
You could create your own channels at any point in the game, so yes, technically it was blizzlike, it just wasn't meta similarly to how consumables weren't in the beginning.  
---
Feel free to use 0 consumables and use Int/Spirit Gear as a Hunter, though.
---
Orc for PvP bc stun resist op. Tauren I feel can be good but orcs stun resist may save ur life way more times. Troll good for pve and I gues can stack with rapid shot for quick arrow slinging.

[I understood that reference.](https://i.imgur.com/XS5LK.jpg)
---
Should probably tag this as NSFW
---
&gt; The warrior one is extremly off mostly because there was no execute phase
---
Right, also no buffs like Windfury which impact Warriors a lot more than other classes because of Rage generation.
---
So, these tests are a bit misleading when you remove the context of a raid.
---
Still, people don't believe that the current meta is to run 10-15+ Warriors in a raid to burst everything down, but when you consider that Warriors are only 20 dps behind Rogues without Execute or buffs...
---
You think you do but you don't
---
Wow I had almost the exact same UI as well. Forgot about xperl
---
There is no point in this, it is inferior in every way to other specs
---
You either go ruin for PVE or Soul link for PVP. You can't raid without ruin it's a fact.
---
 Just go SM/Ruin if you want an "affliction" build
---
I think there is a difference in optimal dps class. Naxx was doable with 5 of everyclass in your raid except for warriors of which you needed 8 for 4h. (So drop 1 Druid and 1 lock since fewer people play those outright, and a hunter, since we can agree hunters do less dps than other pures) 
---
All pures are viable dps through the entire game, no I wouldn‚Äôt field a raid exclusively of hunters, but regardless of warrior or mage dps, I wouldn‚Äôt feel compelled to staff my dps exclusively with them either. There is one real dps check in Vanilla‚Äîpatchwork, and even then a mixed dps comp of players who bring consumables and know how to play their class will kill him fine. 
---
If you bring only mages and warriors, you don‚Äôt need 1/2 the buffs pserver players bring to naxx. If you bring a mixed comp, you‚Äôll appreciate having the consumes. A balanced comp of non snotty players clears naxx fine.
---
Most people on this sub have never touched either vanilla or pservers and know nothing about the game what do you expect lol?
---
I mostly come here for memes and to laugh at the ridiculous things people say like "troll shadow priests underrated in PVP", "rogue is the easiest and best class to play in PVP" and my personal favorite: "Vael in BWL was called the GUILD KILLER"

I've been fat and I've been fit and in my experience being fit came when I stopped trying to ease my self into it and just accepted change had to happen. I genuinely want people to succeed at losing weight as I believe it will majorly improve their lives but I just don't think this can really happen until someone says I'm going to do whatever it takes to succeed. In my experience including personal the only effective life style changes I've seen are hard and fast and most people who ease into it end up getting cold feet and quitting. I truly just want the best for people trying to improve their lives

Got CD's?
---
dude that's an awesome setup, do you have a list of the different furniture? sorry to be weird, but i'm moving apartments soon and want to upgrade my desk space. your desk looks great, i like the lower keyboard.
---
You're the hero I was searching for. Thanks for the map links.
---
NO HUNTRER!
---
When I started WoW in 2004 I played on a PvE server then about 6 months later rolled a toon on a PvP server and never looked back.
---
Even with being ganked/camped on occasion while leveling, it's still fun as heck. The world feels a lot more dangerous.
---
Also, while ganking is a thing, it's not as bad as you'd think. It happens, but its not something that you'll be dealing with 24/7.
---
Plus, I've had several occasions where I've helped out the opposing faction and they've helped me out. Sometimes you hate an NPC enough or know an elite quest can be a pain and you are a generous god.
---
I went back and forth one day questing in Arathi with an opposing player and we were running the same mobs so we took turns, kept pointing and let the other lead back and forth. Was fun.
---
Mine is still in my Amazon history...
---
I always find myself min/maxing almost subconsciously and have to stop cause it always burns me out. Love reading stuff like that link cause it reminds me that fuck it, I want to have an undead warrior and get exalted with orgrimmar so I can ride a wolf at 40. Why? Cause it will be awesome. Thanks for posting it
---
It is an entirely different game
---
When I play hunter, I‚Äôm constantly taming pets for latest bite and claw tanks for eventual endgame/continuity of endgame pet playstyle using cats or wolves. I played Marksman leveling and kept cats and wolves. Had a bear just Incase but didn‚Äôt really need it. I think people using bears or owls is overkill and maybe only useful until like 25, then the dps from cats or wolves in undeniable.. if your going beast mastery I argue you should definitely go cat or wolf as your pet will be inherently stronger anyways.
---
Bismark? Why does that name ring a bell.
---
Crits and crush aren't the same thing, yes, i agree with you.
---
I did not miss it. the -.04% chance to be crit it was incuded in " Def cap is the minimum you need for not taking crit from bosses". Bosses have a Crit chance exactly at 5.6% (because they are at your lvl+3 (for the math at least) and mobs have 5%+0.2% for each lvl above you). I was talking about the def stat and it's value after reaching the soft cap (soft because i think that's the one he was tanlking about). Yes soft cap for a lvl60 is 440 = 300 + 5\*5.6/0.2 i know the maths.
---
My point when i said "Def cap is the minimum you need for not taking crit from bosses, it's not a max to reach" was "don't think because you reach soft cap def become an useless stat" i hope xcoastyx understand my reply that way not the way you did.
---
Im pretty sure the smell was even worst than gnomeragan
---
WoW was supprisingly playable with insane latency like that, and it really goes to show the quality of the blizzard network team at the time.
---
I used to play SC1 over satellite way back pre-2001, and it was amazingly smooth considering &gt;1s latency in a lock-step simulation with people under 100ms.
---
Am I the gnomy one?
---
And that's admirable as fuck.  Personally I've been fit and fat, and have spent years training/coaching at a gym and have seen amazing progress from people who were "just easing into it".  They might show up two or three times a week, don't post up huge numbers, but they show up.  Sure, they don't make the jaw-dropping progress that people who are laser focused, and it takes them much longer, but is it any less worthwhile?  They're getting out of their chairs, getting their bodies moving, and working up a sweat.  In my opinion, any steps taken toward improving oneself are steps taken in the right direction.  Anything is better than sitting on the couch.
---
But you also can spec prot reckoning/holy and solo PvP/group PvP, and tank, and heal raids without ever respeccing as well. You are one of the best utility classes in group PvP compared to Druid as well. Cleanse, bop, shield, mad armor, auras
---
Fuck no. World chat on pvt servers is absolute cancer.
---
I think it‚Äôs a lot less that they know nothing about classic, and more that they are chronically lazy. Let‚Äôs remember, a lot of these guys don‚Äôt have jobs. Imagine how deflated your self worth would be to quit your career, where you interact with the economy and maintain status as a productive contributor to society, to stream yourself playing video games begging for money on camera.
---
If that doesn‚Äôt scream ‚ÄúI would put less effort into life if I could‚Äù what does?
---
In the same vein, why would they suddenly put effort into ‚Äúcontent creation‚Äù over and above the modicum of effort they‚Äôve exhibited their entire life? 
---
It isn‚Äôt even as though it‚Äôs forbidden information, between using a 1.12 database and applying critical thinking to how most people play/progress, hours of valuable gearing videos could be produced. Instead we get muppets regurgitating the same lists from the Nostalrius forums, with no thought behind it.
---
Mage was like the original alt farming class with aoe farming tho
---
Trade chat was suppose to be for trading, durr. look at the name, thats why its only in the cities, so you could meet ppl straight up and trade. 
---
Blizz didn't suppose to corner people like that, that you could only talk in the cities, people literally cucked themself using trade chat for everything, for no reason really. Just cos it historially happened and was a tradition. 
---
Imagine how novice ppl were in vanilla, they couldn't even organize/ figure out world chat when the possibility was from the very beginning, and everyone was using TRADE chat FOR EVERYTHING. up to like wotlk right? if not further. When blizzard didnt even plan on it, and globals channels availability was always there.
---
Its honestly baffling, aswell as gives a nice insight into a human psychology and the power of the tradition and stereotypes and social conditioning. though the obvious solution was right in front of your face all along. no wonder people do so many ridiculous thing irl aswell.
---
It's called WorldDefense
---
&gt;Which you could have got months ago by raiding instead of wasting time in dungeons.
---
Don't know what you mean here, doesn't make any sense. 
---
40 man raids reset every week, there's only 4 weeks in a month. Some items have a 15% chance to drop, that's 1 chance and a half out of 10. Let's say there are 10 people wanting that piece of gear, it is safe to assume some people will have to wait a very long time before getting it. 
---
Raiding in vanilla is not the same as in retails, it takes time to actually get anything. However you can reset a dungeon as many time as you want and you can pick who comes along making things easier for yourself. If you have no life, you could easily get bis gear in a week or 2. 
---
Even if you're the only one needing a piece of gear, there is no guarantee that you're going to get it. It could take 2 months for that item to drop. 
---
There is no justification for being lazy and hope for others to carry you here. The fact that top guilds are going to take down Ragnaros the first week is not going to change the fact that the time needed to clear the MC would be heavily improved with BiS gear. First week is probably going to take up to 5 hours to clear but next will  only 2 and that's only because they'll have more time to farm bis gear.
---
Do not mess with anything in your bags, and download something like TSM so you can get a feel for the value of items that are in there. You would be surprised at what old unobtainable items are worth today, even stupid stuff like the chest warriors used to start with.  Good chance your sitting on at least a million+ gold worth of items in your banks.
---
First time I have seen this lol
---
Calling it a "gamer station" when you put a laptop on a kitchen table is a stretch.
---
I mean, I have a movie theatre as well in my bathroom when I put my smartphone on the floor in front of my toilet.
---
If your music isn't by Disturbed or Rammstein, your video's going to suck. So when do they have new albums?
---
looks very comfy
---
Im glad you have what you want in life :) Not many can say that.
---
i cant believe im actually getting excited for classic.
---
You couldn't in Vanilla unless it was offered to you.
---
in general, duck the beach
---
That sounds so weird to me. I buy things to use them. As long as it gives you joy, who am I to judge. I just found it very curious. Thanks for replying
---
Have you ever considered that many people who don't have experience working out legitimately don't know that there is possibly a better way of doing things?  Its more than possible that he hadn't considered alternative exercises and was not aware of the pros and cons. Why would giving someone additional information be a bad thing if he ultimately is the one to make the decision?
---
i fear the hype is slowing down for many. with other games being releases they are missing out on sales i really don‚Äôt see how they keep people in the dark like this...
---
Whoosh
---
your dad work at blizz?
---
Alliance is better in *premade* pvp because of paladins.
---
Random world pvp, though? Horde all the way.
---
I'm all for the epeen. But if you can't get what you want for the release, you could always get something cheap and save more. Or even just not buy a gpu and use the integrated graphics untill you can save more. If I can play retail wow like that I'm sure classic will be easy peasy
---
I've been doing the same thing as you, but a slightly different talent build. Personally, I've been ok with using cloth/leather pieces with good stats in the lower armor slots, but making sure to stick to mail in the higher contribution slots. So a good cloth bracers or belt etc. has been fine in terms of damage reduction, but I would never use anything but mail in chest/legs.
---
I'm no expert or supreme min/maxer but my rule of thumb has been to try and stay at or above 33% DR against same level (with devo aura ofc) when I hover over my armor stat. Too much lower and I get chunked too quickly and have to drain way too much mana into heals between pulls.
---
That's what has been working for me on my practice pally on a pserver (lvl 39) right now, but your results may vary.
---
I‚Äôd say top 10 for sure, too 5 depending on gear/skill/consumes. It really depends on how good and nolife the mages and rogues are (because I‚Äôm not sure warriors will dps as high as they do in privateservers with bad threat mechanics).
---
What exactly is kiting? I only played BC to LK as a Druid troll. Planning on making my main a troll hunter. Do I need to know what this kiting is with a range character?
---
That's not the reason there was no world chat back then - Custom chat channels have a rather low cap. ( I think it's around 50, but don't quote me on that )
---
So it's not blizzlike and most certainly won't be in Classic.
---
This is why I would be ok with a later summer release, even though I want it ASAP. Most Americans have already had "summer" weather for awhile; in northern Minnesota we just got 10" of snow on Wednesday.
---
I agree with what has been posted in this thread (they are tremendously different) but I want to add that, more importantly, you won't get any sense of the feel of a class by leveling to 10 - in classic *or* retail.
---
This particular test will be especially unsuccessful because iirc hunters get their pet immediately, have no deadzone or ammo, run on focus instead of mana, and quickly learn spammable shots. In vanilla you'll spend most of the first 10 levels slowly meleeing things to death after your first \~3 shots to pull.
---
I would say the only class which feels somewhat similar at 10 as it does at 60 is frost mage, but even then you're going to be missing some of the more powerful/enjoyable (leveling) tools like frost nova, cone of cold, and their interaction with the shatter talent. Or blizzard+aoe leveling, if that's more your chosen style.
---
Ah Okey, that makes much more sense lol. I though you sat right in the middle there. Looked so uncomfortable!

thanks for protecting the internet
---
Why would Blizzard need anywhere close to the same amount of time? It isn't new content, they have the exact code to go over to make sure everything is right. All we'd be doing in a beta is stress testing and throwing in unknown variables for make a week or two just to make sure it holds.
---
Beautiful!
---
Site is a bit wrong tho, it doesn't take in consideration the new itemization blizzard has said they will do @Gorshun
---
Reinforcements were added in Classic for AV and I thought Blizzard said they‚Äôre going to be there because Classic is sitting on the last patch. Am I mistaken?
---
Knows what‚Äôs super prejudiced? Presuming someones skin color based on the sound of their voice.
---
It will generate profit.. during the content droughts between the last patch of retail and the next expansion.
---
There's just too many variables. As a Vanilla lock, I carried enough shards to spam shadowburn on CD when max DPS was needed. As top raid DPS, I'd also SS myself, and use death itself as a spectacularly effective threat reset. 
---
During TBC, I was the last DPS standing on a Gruul fight because of this (soulshatter had still been on CD when I regained threat. Might have been after the MT went down? I know 'wipewipewipe' had already been called), and we finished him off from 2-3% when I convinced the few remaining raiders (mostly/all druids, for some reason) to threat mitigate and passive kite him away from other raiders if they had pulled aggro, and build threat/attempt to pull aggro with heal spam while he was on someone else. 
---
Grull proceeded to waste a minute or two chasing cats and bears around the room while I chased after him, refreshing dots and weaving in shadowburns and nightfall-proc instant SB's - anything that didn't require me to stop moving. I can't remember anymore if he reached enrage or not, but I don't think there were more than 3 or 4 of us standing when he came down. Never heard vent erupt like that before or since. I got to be a real (virtual) hero that day.
---
Goddamn, I miss the old WoW experience. What were we talking about, again?
---
nice, now you can refund it
---
Actually, yeah, that is odd.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt level as prot until like late 30s or 40s even. You can tank 5 man dungeons later game when you get some gear and experience. Paladin tank is all about game knowledge. Know the fights, ALWAYS get first pull and conc on things, and your BoP is your taunt if you need it. BoP the guy that gets aggro. I tanked a ton once I got some gear at 60, especially UD dungeons.
---
What evidence to you have for druids are better than warlocks at leveling?
---
You'll see CD timer and debuff timers in live as well.
---
The best kind of gamer station ;)
---
Nah, he has a pub. But beer is good, too....
---
&gt; Everyone who says that probably never did high end pve or pvp.
---
I not the highest end pvper I‚Äôm currently sitting around 2300, and I in general find classic pvp to have much more depth. Most the games I‚Äôm in on retail are pretty predictable everyone runs a tank absorb trinket and maledict you play it safe tell dampening sets in enough to get a kill condition, trade cooldowns then someone wins. Even with direct binds to heal each of my teammates I‚Äôm running more hotkeys on my vanilla Paladin. Maybe that‚Äôs just a problem with arenas though? They are just simple because it‚Äôs 3v3 with no consumables or long cds allowed. 
---
For me at least I feel like vanilla pvp leaves me with many more options than retail pvp does, I can use dozens of trinkets, endless consumables, engineering toys, grenades, and I‚Äôm constantly managing my inventory. Retail classes are so pruned currently I actually have extra key bindings available, and on classic I‚Äôm clicking certain trinkets and consumables.
---
I miss that time in my life. I do not want to go back but I do miss it.
---
yep exactly how i did it, started with 1 continent at the top or bottom and just typed in which zones connected to which :&gt;
---
Lucky you. If they die, the opponents cap the flag. So many games dragged on because it turned into a 4v6 grind fest. 6 people on defense, 4 people trying to kill the flag bearer, for an hour. And then you get to do it again. 
---
Never had a FC go afk and not cap because it's been going on for 45 minutes, and they're just up top in bear form with a healer?
---
Specs: 8700k, 1080Ti, 16gb 3200.
---
Don‚Äôt hate me for the Patriots I live in. New England.
---
Save money for a proper chair damn dude.
---
Pointless, especially those two classes. Hunters had a huge class rework that changed their resource back in Cataclysm (A point that I'm still upset about, hunter was my favourite class before that) along with hunters imo, being the class with the most RPG mechanics that were taken out (Pet happiness/loyalty, needing ammunition, etc)
---
meaning?
---
As I said its blizzlike to create custom, global channels. But people rarely utilized it back in the day, and it wasn't standard or "meta" to be on a world/global channel.
---
So by nochanges, you are all in for the global channel I guess
---
In stuck too, played a hunter for 300 days in vanilla, not sure if I want to continue or pursue something else.
---
Top pick seems to be warlock for me atm.  Then I have rig/war cravings tho.
---
And then back to hunter.
---
Played a paladin on private min/max healing with exaggerated healing effects it seems.  Vanilla pally was never as powerful as private server pally.
---
I agree, I‚Äôm worried about after BWL scaling if I plan to advance my vanilla kill list as a hunter.
---
How did you get your UI so small with such a low resolution?
---
Figure you might appreciate [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/52fxo1/ama_league_design_lead_greg_ghostcrawler_street/d7jwm98/) from this AMA on the LoL sub.
---
I can relate. Its all we need brother
---
He ruined League of Legends after.
---
&gt; new itemization blizzard has said they will do
---
??
---
Dunno about that. If I trust the skill and dedication of my raiders (Ie if I came to classic with my retail progression guild) I‚Äôd give the loot to the guy who isn‚Äôt wearing the prebis slot. As you say it‚Äôs a bigger benefit to the raid. 
---
I think rewarding the guy who just can‚Äôt fucking get a break on 5 man drops is fine. It‚Äôs a wholly different situation if said twill wearer is a raid logger.
---
It looks good. But I can't imagine that lighting doesn't absolutely destroy your eyes.
---
I'm pretty sure he's always been there. We summoned him a lot in the bfa prepatch, it's just not that useful unless you're just doing it for fun.
---
It was locked behind exalted Timbermaw so that could by why you don't remember it being available at the start.

Good times man. Really miss the world PvP. Was the GTA of WoW. I just wanna go back.
---
What a wholesome post in a sea of memes and debauchery. I'll go on there right now.
---
Waiting for classic like the rest of us of course!
---
I got straight W's on 20 credit hours in 2005. Every class was withdrawn.
---
Good bye money; hello T0 dungeon set!
---
What Blizzard would do back in the day was offer free character transfers to and from servers that were experiencing problems. Mostly because of dead servers. I'm sure they will do that again.
---
Yeah, I've been eyeing up leveling a paladin but have 0 experience with it. The way I view it, int is essentially just a bandaid, not a cure, to their leveling woes. Armor lowers opponents dps, and strength reduces opponents overall damage done, by killing them quicker. Both of those stats will increase the efficiency of your base intellect. To me, it seems like incorporating bandages while mana is low will be far more efficient than splitting your stat priority (though, the way you are slotting your int pieces makes a lot of sense from a min/max perspective).
---
Early only you‚Äôll have at least 4-5 locks if not more for MC. Hunters are the class where you only bring 2-3.
---
Sounds like you were taking about TBC ;)
---
Great ol' times
---
Damn that is a SWEET setup
---
Those Queue times will be really fun too
---
Why not gnome. Deal with your hardest classes: classes that can kite you.
---
Who was working as the person that runied WoW, before GC?
---
Fucking hell, I scrolled to the headline only, you almost gave me a heart attack.
---
Maybe its related to an other person. Just sayin. Watch out ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
It's still real to me damn it!
---
Who made Classic, TBC and WotLK addons? I mean the Tsar of WoW or whatever his job title was.
---
For leveling I prio strength and spirit for the lower lvls. Once you get to stv I would prio Stam and strength just in case you get into pvp. The armor isn't that important since you can heal any damage you take. Stat prios for a reckoning build would be Stam and iny but, that might not work in classic.
---
Ok, so imagine you have two 20 dps weapons (thats a nice number for easy math, should be blue weapons around level 30) and you are trying to attack an equal level mob with normal weapon skill. No extra hit. Let‚Äôs ignore dual wield specialization for now.
---
So off-hand damage dps is halved. That way you have 30 dps vs 20 with just one dagger.
---
Now let‚Äôs factor in miss chance: 24% for dual, 5% for one hand. 
---
30 dps *  0.76 = 22.8 dps
---
20 dps * 0.95 = 19 dps
---
Yellow attacks are not affected by the extra miss chance. In the dual wield case you get AP scaling on both weapons, instead of just on one, making dual wield scale better. Dual wield specialization makes the damage on the off hand better of course. 
---
(20 dps + 20 dps * 0.75 ) * 0.76 = 35 dps * 0.76 = 26.6 dps
---
Also, you get the extra attacks on the off hands from poisons and disrupting casts and stuff.
---
I don‚Äôt really see what the benefit of one weapon rogue playing would be.
---
How can you play if you have a heart attack when Classic release is announced?
---
That Dyson is a game-changer if you have cats.
---
Tbh I like this setup more than the others I‚Äôve seen. A nice wooden desk and just one monitor (I find multiple monitors less immersive.
---
In most of my guilds, we had one feral offtank/dps for raids. If needed to tank, he would, then dps on fights where not needed for the crit buff. But I would at least keep in mind, you may need to fulfill this type of hybrid role in most guilds and know fights etc. Not to say some more casual guild may let you dps more, but it may be a little rare
---
mousepad????????????????
---
This is the only leak I'll believe.
---
Sure were. Got some sweet memories with that machine. The Warcraft series, Dark age of Camelot (my first MMO when I was like 12), all the RPGs and all the pirated stuff (half of which were viruses) and the Internet feeling like virgin ground with no rules or demands to show your IRL identity.
---
Loved it all.
---
I like the noname beer
---
If they launch with 10 or less servers per region queues will be a thing regardless for the first month or two. Perhaps queue times won't be a bad due to ... sharding *shudders*. 
---
But to be totally fair, there's a special kind of fine in suffering through queues, lag, and downtime. I remember all the WoW xpack launches from TBC onwards due to how crazy and broken things were. Looking back they were fun just due to the game being broken to shit. I hardly remember BfA or Legion's launches do to them going so smoothly. It's good that they went smoothly from a infrastructure point of view but they also don't have any wacky, bizarre memories associated with them.
---
You have heirlooms, its called enchants! I love my 30 sp on a skinning knife
---
I like how he says that he regrets working on raid finer
---
It meant she's getting anal
---
The first computer I ran WoW was so shit that I couldn't even go into major cities. The graphics would immediately glitch out literally the second I stepped into either Ironforge or Stormwind. I couldn't see a thing, I would just have to move my cursor around to see if there was a quest or NPC I could talk to. 
---
It probably was a couple months before I even knew what either of those cities looked like.
---
It's a GAME these days!
---
You‚Äôre 100% correct
---
Haha, nah just a couple of promotions at work. Gone from a warehouseman to a project manager though working that little bit extra.
---
You dont spam them. Are you trolling?
---
I too hate sand.
---
... and thats why I am a PVE care bear. The number of times I arrived in from shopping with nothing but cuts and bruises....
---
Once you get some gear, paladins have so much group utility and survivability. They can bring so much to the table. I also feel you can solo PvP a bit better still as a heal spec compared to priest, but priests are strong if you can outlast play. This is because you can spec reckoning/holy and build reck hits to smash people and outlast them.
---
I like your pussy.
---
I sat at home while my mom went shopping she said she would get me the game so I sat anxiously all day watching shark tale.
---
She gets home and hands me prison simulator instead of wow. The store didnt have wow and she didnt want to come home empty handed, iirc I ended up getting it a day or two later
---
Or maybe giving anal...
---
Grouping should force you into the same shard
---
Cute setting
---
I just leveled both of them to 60 recently and really enjoyed them both. Warlock is probably my preference because they have longevity in fights, I love the pet micro and they have several different, strong playstyles in PvP. While blowing people up as a Shaman was fun, a Warlock can do it very well too.
---
Fwiw, you won't be getting instant groups as a healer. On the server I was on, it was actually easier to get groups as a ranged DPS over a healer at 60. Looking at class polls here, Paladin/Shaman are the 3rd most popular class, so it could be that same situation again.
---
You guys arguing #nochanges are ignorant. There was a global looking for group channel in 1.12 with no 50 player cap. Just like on pservers. Still want to use only /trade to fill groups? Lol..
---
Those were good days..
---
One of the gems from Un‚ÄôGoro gives you a lightning shield effect, and I believe the cloth Helm from Gnomer does as well.
---
Oh, come on. That is so far from what‚Äôs happening here and you know it.
---
You can whisper and send invites to players on any shard. All group members are moved onto the same shard as the group leader.
---
It happened to someone as they were streaming during the BlizzCon demo.
---
Priest
---
Goodness... was thinking the exact same thing and 2 secs later read your post.
---
Well then here I am, telling you why your comments are shitty
---
Lol mana. Dear God.. viper sting
---
Yea, my Shaman did not have good gear, but could still burst and contribute nicely in BGs. A lot of their damage comes from talents.
---
While everyone has some manner of inventory pressure in vanilla, hunters and warlocks both take it to another level.  The fact that the most inventory pressure is on the pet classes is likely not any manner of accident, as pets represent a serious boost to all non-raid content (and were likely intended to be great in all content).  
---
It's not really an accident that power levelers and farmers played hunters to a huge degree.  
---
Both are solid picks of course.
---
That Ret Paladin is underperforming. Also BiS doesn‚Äôt mean anything if you can play.
---
dont neeeed one haha moves fine across the desk.
---
Everyone loves anal until she breaks out the strap-on.
---
You know i dont do anal
---
If you do 3 parts of that set on items that already dont have enchants or effects the other portions you could wear stuff that increases the damage and healing of spells and effects (lots of cloth gear does it.) And enchant it for increased damage from spells and effects. I'd recon you could on a druid get around 200 damage per hit ish that way.
---
A friend of mine had one of those back in the days. Think it was from Microsoft with a red trackball. He used it for over a year and ended up having problems with his thumb. To this day his thumb still makes clicking sounds when he bends it.

(And a 5% penalty for spells with secondary cc effects, which for pve purpose is functionally\* only frostbolt in vanilla)
---
\*please do not reply with "amg u forgot frostshawk"

It's very possible to have a balanced game that also has unique and interesting classes. You don't need to homogenize everything to achieve balance, that's just the route Blizzard took.

You know you can just use [itemization.info](https://itemization.info) right? :)
---
Keeping your target following you at a distance, unable to hit you, usually as a ranged character. So, well,  yep!
---
Our server had a pretty-much-global chat channel, ostensibly for LFG, even back in vanilla.  
---
"No changes" means, you can opt in to some global chat channel if you like, but won't be in it by default.
---
"bend over its ur turn"
---
I'm hoping we get them so I can flex with Zergling ~~and Mini Tyrael tbh.~~ Just looked it up, Tyrael was tbc :(
---
This is garbage firstly, and secondly in vanilla people don't often refer to you by spec but rather names such as SM/Ruin/ or DS/Ruin rather than calling them Affli/Destro or Demo/Destro
---
Wait, if this is all running in the same client, wouldn't it mean that you have to download 60 GB of retail + \~10 GB for Classic? Unless they are launched as completely separate games from the [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) launcher there wouldn't be any way around this, right? I don't intend to play any retail, so I'm hoping we get separate clients, but I doubt they would do this.
---
Remember, this audience includes the people that respond to Barrens chat.
---
A fire mage and a shadow priest got together to make this propaganda.
---
That‚Äôs impressive for sure, but like I said your talking about strength training not training for hypertrophy. 
---
And as someone who works in science not in ‚Äúscience‚Äù I think that‚Äôs ridiculous that you disregard scientific research. That‚Äôs ignorant to say the least.

---
Still undecided üòÖ
---
I was a dwarf priest before, love playing shadow for pvp.
---
I‚Äôm going to play a priest but now I‚Äôm torn between troll and undead. I think I‚Äôm leaning towards troll.
---
Yourself?
---
Not in 1.12
---
Imagine getting "You think you do, but you don't" in your fortune cookie. I would tip 25% for a restaurant which was on top of their meme game.
---
Right next to the dungeon of CEX. ahhh Corby. Never change...
---
You make very valid points, but wanting future content after the inevitable stagnation of Classic and appreciating Classic for what it is are not mutually exclusive. I also wouldn't describe it as losing "investment" as much as disturbing their attachment. People don't necessarily factor in the investment of their character, they organically become attached to their characters due to the level of investment.
---
Excellent, thanks. The question now is does Thorns and the crystal spire and gigacapacitor buff stack... I've got a feeling they don't.
---
Ok this sub is turning into r/Battlestations now

When Rogues get geared, they will kill your Succubus lightning quick without it able to get a Seduce off. Rogues and Warriors are hard as a Warlock.

---
Kiting can be used in PvE as well, and should be when at all available to your class(s). Even melee characters benefit from it at times (warriors and shamans both make use)
---
It‚Äôs (basically, but not entirely) when you slow a mob (or root) while dealing damage to it, and moving away. So you can exit combat (or take down tougher enemies) with more Hp than you would have otherwise.  
---
If your just in it for questing / exploring, you don‚Äôt really need to do this (unless you have a really tough mob) unless you want to be efficient and get to the next fight faster (due to not having to eat every pull)
---
For PvP specifically, it‚Äôs when your keeping away from your target so they can‚Äôt strike you.  A frost mage for example can slow a warrior down and cast until the warrior gets within hitting range, Frost nova him, and get max range again never letting the warrior hit. (Or just keep slowing and running, even) 
---
Kiting is just used to be more efficient in PvE, and something that‚Äôs essentially required for PvP.  It essentially acts as a direct damage reduction source. 
---
Like, you could take 90% less damage in PvE if done right on some (most) mobs with certain classes, verse letting them hit you. So it‚Äôs very good to learn.
---
Thanks for your reply!
---
Hey buddy I think you got the wrong door
---
This has been asked before, but never answered (I think). What UI addon are you using? :)
---
Yeah, strength/stam mail pieces are overall probably the best for palading solo leveling, but a bit of int here and there is pretty good. More mana = more Judgement spam if necessary.
---
And paladin leveling is alright. It's definitely slow as everyone says, but its pretty easy. Can easily solo things 5 levels above you if necessary, and can tank through bigger pulls because you have basically 3 health bars. Its a much more reactive play style than active though.
---
makes for a nice pic though
---
Its a energy drink called Franks, swedish made.
---
Doesn't
---
Blizzard transferred the files to a server that's connected to the internet so that people that are alpha-testing can access them from home. It's the same server that's also used for beta-testing which is why a lot of people thought their initial appearance meant a beta was imminent. Data-miners are able to connect to this server and download the files on it without having an alpha-testing account.
---
By using software to analyze the contents of the files that were first uploaded and looking for differences with the files from the new build that were just uploaded, a list can be generated of each file that was changed, removed, or added.
---
I'm very interested to see what the coefficients will be in Classic for these funny mechanics. I'm going to do some testing on a private server this weekend and see what it looks like.
---
Thank you
---
Vanilla as is.
---
Pretty sure they all stack, though I haven‚Äôt tested it in a while.
---
Yea just get an average American job where you can't afford to gain weight!
---
I see you are a man of culture, as well.
---
I was also thinking of playing shadow priest for vanilla. I came from warlock in vanilla so I figured it might be a nice change, but how viable is shadow in PVE? I enjoy healing but I always want my options open.
---
You think you Chris, but you don't.

lfg was global at some point and also on an opt out system. I honestly miss it lol

Generally you just need Strength and Stam. If you find a great leather piece though don‚Äôt be afraid to toss it on. Triprunner dungarees (sp?) for instance are probably worth using they have like 18 agility with str and stam too.
---
wow i hope that cardboard file under the computer monitor slides out. That's some gr8 engineering
---
Tool is meh
---
If you like balanced its hard to know where to go.

If you like to be on the high side of a faction imbalance then join a server with a popular streamer on his or her faction.

Usually pluses to non stats like adds x healing or x damage is flat values. If it's additive to the stat then it's fed through the normal damage equation. Problem is if you're building this for pvp that takes the targets defenses into account and not every attack on you will result in damage same way in the case of fire and nature resistance.
---
Tauren warrior. Simple, i was 8 and it looked really cool
---
Classic WoW will need a minimum of 16gb of ram to play now. 1gb for wow and 15gb for Chrome
---
Not sure about that, 
---
If you mean all classes were roughly equally desired, when you take in the sum total of the game experience, from leveling and gold farming, to wpvp and instanced PvP and duels, to 5 mans and raids, then possibly. 
---
If you mean every classes dps was roughly comparable and all classes which appeared to have certain roles actually had those roles function? All while facing similar win loss rates vs every other class? Then absolutely not.
---
I am going to wager that we will have the same servers available as we did during Vanilla for the Nostalgia feels and ease of OG players finding their old friends.
---
There were no Oceanic servers?.. My first level 60 was on jubei'thos the first pvp oceanic sever after quitting my level 36 hunter on khaz'goroth(first oceanic server which was pve)....
---
I am on the same boat. Just need to pick between two. I have worries about finding 5 men or raid spot as a hunter compared to warlock.
---
I mean, you only need the ones for Vanilla
---
Do you have a link to the LED's? Thank you friend.
---
I raise you with : [https://imgur.com/a/XvWnlKN](https://imgur.com/a/XvWnlKN)
---
I was strictly talking about pvp. 
---
As far as pve it‚Äôs fairly balanced until melle get their hands on aq and high warlord gear then they outpace others.
---
Boomers are the ones that use a mouse backwards and still use facebook.
---
''I also haven't played WoW in a few years, so it's entirely possible they have solved the problem by now.'' oof
---
Playing a real mmo instead of the casino China focused style of modern WoW.
---
Which is the best?
---
I bet you can recite the system requirements off the top of your head.
---
When was the last time something like this happened with Blizzard? It's been a while.
---
It's all been focused on sponsored corporate eSports events.
---
Not even BlizzCon has the same feeling of passion.
---
Come on Blizzard. Light up that flame again.
---
Not even close but you can solo scarlet monastery by just healing yourself
---
Thanks for the info! I now get the analogy and kiting is the perfect word to explain the strategy.
---
With a player cap of 50.
---
Not really, hunters are great in mc and bwl but struggle a bit in aq and early naxx. Many fights in aq naxx like twin emps and four horsemen are great for hunters. 
---
The hunter scaling issue is mainly because of private server kids. Melle are completely broken and 10x overpowered then they were in retail so hunters on private servers are shit.
---
The computers back then had about the same power as a smart toaster today.  Raid FPS drop was the hardest boss to kill.
---
To be a main tank for a guild, usually expectations mean your THE most reliable, and very knowledgeable, person of the group. 
---
Not every guild, as there will be more casual ones I‚Äôm sure, but expect to have to be on for every raid, and probably be one of the people making sure others are going to be on and doing what they‚Äôre suppose to (checking that they have correct pots, food, regents, ect) this kind of expectedly falls to the main tanks since there often seen as the leader. (Sometimes you‚Äôll get lucky and not have to deal with any of this, all depends on the guild though, and your position in it)
---
But in general, main tanks always have a lot of responsibly outside of just the tanking part. They‚Äôre the leader seen by many eyes. So keep that in mind.
---
Pretty much, PvP at 2200+ and mythic raiding sub world 50 are a completely different game from what 99.999% of people experience. 
---
Progressing in mythic raids before guides come out is serious fun, it‚Äôs real raiding. Developing and optimizing a strategy over a few hundred wipes with 19-24 of your friends who all have a shared interest in killing this boss and all of whom ‚Äúthink‚Äù in world of Warcraft the same way you do is the best.
---
Having to meta game your opponents at 2200 and above is nuts too, you start to do things that they won‚Äôt expect, less reliance on the doctrine of decision making that got you that far‚Äîbecause everyone at that level knows what you ‚Äúshould‚Äù do next, so you have to outplay that. All with modern WoW haste levels seeing gods approach 1s. 
---
I love vanilla, the pace of play, the power creep, lore, familiarity with the world, I even like the pre raid farming, scarcity of gold. 
---
But come the fuck on, high end pve is dramatically better in retail; you can not enjoy the new PvP where it‚Äôs about cd windows, (I‚Äôm not a big fan, tbh) etc. but you are a fool if you think being a high skill Vanilla pvper is more difficult than being a 2200-2500 3v3 player now.
---
You would bring more hunters than necessary because you have the possibility of clearing it despite their hindrance to the raid? No Naxx guild brings more than 2 for good reason. You can have 350 dps hunters or 1200 dps fury warriors. Purposely shafting your clear times for the ‚Äúchallenge‚Äù can be done in more interesting ways.
---
Try current wow
---
Considering it‚Äôs the same engine will give you an overall idea
---
Yeah this is where the real problem is, catch-up mechanics are the killer of most content
---
Cheers bro.
---
Is there a way of trying current wow without paying for each expansion from when I quit? Or can I just sub and logon to my existing expansion WotLK?
---
Do everything you can to avoid servers with big streamers on them, if you are on asmongolds server for instance you are going to have a bad time
---
Depends how serious you want to be. Usually 1 is brought for the shadow dmg buff for locs
---
You can try it via trial option, do not need a sub.
---
You can play on lvl 1-20 characters without subsciption
---
Search for a swing timer addon. It's pretty great to have and will help you minimize the amount of extra attacks wasted.
---
A warlock with half decent kiting skills can effectively engage an entire pack of mobs simultaneously through DoT distribution/refreshing and fear chaining. More, if it's humanoids (seduction), Elementals, or Demons (banish). They have no ammo needs, very little pet maintenance (occasional shard harvesting during normal grinding), and drains/HS + lifetap mean they have almost no downtime, especially with SS to eliminate corpse runs on the occasional whoopsie.
---
I was genuinely surprised when I found out anyone else can even compete on their level, let alone supposedly exceed them, but I guess that faster transit speed for 20 levels has a fairly significant impact. Honestly, I sort of suspect there were just a lot more hunters, so we heard more about/had more examples of their optimal leveling experience.
---
It might also be a theoretical optimum vs practical optimum situation; Maybe the theoretical hunter who has optimized their leveling plan, knows all zone transitions, has friends to mail him ammo, food, and crafted upgrades for when he's near a mailbox, might surpass a similarly optimized Warlock. But that's not solo leveling.
---
When the rubber meets the road, I would not bet against a very talented warlock in a genuine, solo leveling race. Aspect of the Pack seems to be the only true advantage of their one serious competitor. 
---
tl;dr - If my only considerations were speed/ease of solo leveling, and endgame utility, I'd go warlock hands down. I'll probably level another as an alt this time around, but I want to try something new, first.
---
A solid investment
---
I am rolling a hunter in classic. While I've always tanked, I've watched a ton of videos on hunters. May I ask: what is your favorite thing about being a hunter? I'm trying to get hype!
---
Also how was it finding spots in groups?
---
That would be way to many, no?
---
Ok I shall try that, thanks all :)
---
Barbell, rack, plates, bench for less than 1k usd?
---
I doubt that unless you want some really shitty equipment
---
I envy you
---
Thank you.
---
Your posts are all low effort troll posts and you're too stupid to understand huh?
---
This is on a private server lol
---
That's what I was thinking.
---
 That sounds like waaaaay too many servers.
---
I never fit in anywhere
---
Huh? Lol
---
No. I don't know why people are so confused about these things. The "fun" of them was the randomness, the accident of them. As random events they are fondly remembered bits of history. Intentionally implemented, they are the game design version of a "hello fellow kids" meme.
---
Sometimes you really did just have to be there.
---
Undead rogue. Before owning my own account, my cousin let me level an alt on his. I was tired of getting ganked as an Orc Shaman, so instead of just going PvE, I chose a rogue my personal account's first main lol.
---
There are too much unknowns to make a pre-bis list : we still have no idea if Rune of The Guard Captain will be available to Horde, we still don't know how much weapon skill affect +HIT (pservers don't even agree between them).
---
Here's my current list :
---
Head	Crown of Tyranny
---
Neck	Mark of Fordring
---
Shoulder	Wyrmtongue Shoulders
---
Back	Cape of the Black Baron
---
Chest	Savage Gladiator Chain
---
Wrist	Beaststalker's Bindings
---
Mainhand	Warmonger
---
Ranged	Flawless Arcanite Rifle
---
Hands	Devilsaur Gauntlets
---
Waist	Chiselbrand Girdle
---
Legs	Devilsaur Leggings
---
Feet	Windreaver Greaves
---
Finger 1	Blackstone Ring
---
Finger 2	Painweaver Band
---
Trinket 1	Hand of Justice
---
Trinket 2	Blackhand's Breadth
---
Hopefully woman..
---
There are a TON of really bad rogue youtubers, and twitch streamers, mechanically speaking. But they are all *sorta* knowledgeable about the class in general. But like /u/ForeverTerminal said, [perplexity](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3XZx8eX5TSFXyOz_RSknMA) is hands down the best rogue youtuber.

this i guess

Keep it secret ,, keep it safe...
---
That's only for premades. And premades dodge premades, so it's never actually relevant.
---
Lol 350 dps get the fuck outta here. 
---
So we can zoom a zoom zoom through easy content relative to live mythic raiding, with an ideal comp and smash it better and faster than last time. 
---
Or we can still quite comfortably clear it, bring in a more diverse set of classes who will be able to utilize a wider range of the loot that drops, also allowing current classes‚Äîwhich would be impacted if class stacking‚Äîto gear out quicker. 
---
The clear time would change from...2 hours to 2 hours 45 min? 
---
It‚Äôs not even challenge man, it‚Äôs about not needlessly being an arrogant elitist dick over a game that doesn‚Äôt require it. The only people with a hardon for 32 minute bwl clears with 19 warriors are mongoloids that failed trials in real mythic/heroic (expansion dependent) progression guilds on live or never raided the content in 200-06 when it was actually relevant. 
---
I raid to have fun these days, needing 18 other Crul‚ÄôShoruks to drop isn‚Äôt my idea of fun. Just as easily clearing all content with a diverse raid that allows all my buddies to gear up and play together is what I‚Äôm looking for, spending 3 hours pre raid farming consumables for our 15 minute Mc clear isn‚Äôt.
---
Hey, is that a "titty"?
---
Don't fear! 4 huge vanilla streamers will all be rolling on the same server. Esfand is one of them.  Just find out what server that is when they announce it and you'll most likely have a heavily populated server.
---
You knew things were going to go down hill when general chat is complaining about leaving.
---
My brain hurts
---
Yikes, I played vanilla on a 2ghz Athlon 64 3200+ with 1gb of RAM on an ATI Radeon 9800 Pro.
---
Are you serious? Is this your idea of how things go?
---
I need to provide evidence?
---
Do a quick search.
---
Again..it depends on how efficient you are. But if you are equally efficient...druids are fastest for travel time early on...AND are capable of less and less downtime as you level
---
But if you are better at warlock than you are druid...that matters. DUH.
---
Ehhh its always quite simple choice... NEVER play on same realm that streamers play. Unless you are part of his/her community. If Streamer will get bored and leave, realm will die, and it can happen overnight. 
---
I only hope Blizz wont make such problems with release as it use to be back then....
---
/r/hydrohomies approves this statement.
---
Lmao look at this salty huntard who never killed Nefarian before.
---
He already have the bench, although i'm not sure what it's rated for.
---
A rack can be gotten under 300 dollars. Then he only needs to splurge for a decent bar and use the rest on weights. The barbell and bench is really the only thing that needs to be more than cheap.
---
100% agree. Hopefully Classic will be a step in the right direction.
---
It makes you sad that he got his old character back?
---
Cool item but not attainable now and literally only 1 person ever got it
---
By February my rogue buddy that i Met in SFK and i started petitioning for classic servers. People told us we were crazy.. üòÇ

"July 16th" üòÇ
---
Yes, it makes me sad that a botter got their account unbanned.
---
It is among the strongest talents in the tree, probably second to precision, expertise (non-human), and sword spec in that order. Parry is also a deceptively strong stat while leveling so the fact that riposte is a 6-point talent is somewhat mitigated.
---
To answer your specific question, all of these stats are better than crit for leveling - mostly because it doesn't interact with energy in any way. It would be roughly on-par with sword spec were it not for poison procs and the fact that the extra swing is from your MH regardless of which hand procced it. Malice is a deeply powerful talent but is not a huge priority for leveling. My usual path is ss/lr-&gt;precision-&gt;riposte-&gt;4/5 dw spec-&gt;flurry+4/5 sword-&gt;expertise-&gt;assassination through relentless, then finish up 31 in combat. You'll hit adrenaline rush at 51 which is in plenty of time for when boss dps is actually meaningful (50s dungeons).
---
Yeah, I didnt even think of the fact of them quitting and the server dying. 
---
oof.
---
Cool tetris with the co workers
---
Thanks for the photo, do you mind if I send it to your employer and inform them you are posting it online for all to see?
---
I believe it once happened with Swifty, i dont rly remember at which realm he did play, but when he left realm died...
---
I‚Äôm excited for what gear your wearing meaning something again. The whole transmog thing not only confused me (how could you want this?) but also drove me away from the game. 
---
I‚Äôm also excited for a limited, easy to understand amount of items, abilities, mounts, professions, enchantments, materials, etc.
---
We need to stop supporting these both-faction setups. PICK A SIDE! ‚ò†Ô∏è
---
Bro those old school PS2 clicky keyboards were the best I wish I still had one.
---
Question about lock picking. Where are the good lock picking leveling spots? Are there class quests involved? Is so, what level can access them?
---
Best thing to do, is focus on one character at first. In Vanilla, you really need to commit to one character, because you'll use a long time on it.
---
Yeah it does, however I would've gone with a purple light. I think it blends better.
---
Agreed. Never seen this happen before.
---
Do you have a link to your exact chair?
---
Oh wow, so you're not naturally lefty? Do you find that things are still difficult to learn lefty?

You‚Äôre welcome! He really wrote a good review - I‚Äôm glad someone else appreciated it too!
---
My eyes!! They burn!!
---
Just hope a streamer doesn‚Äòt roll on your server, otherwise start over again and still be faster than on the streamers server cause of q time
---
B) if you want to keep your sanity, just face tank the mobs like every warrior that levelled in Vanilla and did absolutely fine.
---
I really hope the Wednesday beta is correct, because I'm at two days now and I'm only 180 and 5 11'. I don't have much left
---
Darkspear it was
---
LMAO this brings back memories
---
If it needs chrome, that's me screwed - I only use Firefox, and then only when contained.
---
Kinda anecdotal though, plenty of us in /r/Trackballs have been using one for years :)
---
What‚Äôs the drama with Esfand?
---
Wait let me get this straight. The history of azeroth being fucked started when the orcs invaded? Night elves fucking with magic had nothing to do with that? You guys didn't lay out the red carpet for the legion? Didnt human expansion through azeroth shit on former troll/tauren/nelf land? And you're mad a stronger people came and forced you out?
---
As far as I know, each time the legion is one step from bringing sargeras into azeroth, it's been orcs and horde help that saves the day.
---
Wasn't it the legion hunting down the draenei that led them to draenor in the first place? The alliance drags everyone through shit but doesn't like to take responsibility. That's where that honor comes in. See hellscream might have drank evil liquid but he realized his struggle and put an axe through it's head. I've still to see the alliance take some blame for all that's happened on azeroth.
---
Bullshit aside, both factions were made to be grey as fuck. If you've read any wow lore you know that's true. So let's bring that human ego down a notch üòâ
---
I well remember - and shared - your pain.
---
It's going to be good to see Azeroth as Elune intended.
---
For me it was bad on the lower back, even with the pillow for the lower back.
---
You won‚Äòt be aoe tanking as a druid like you do with a warrior cause you simply miss the shield, talking of big pulls of 20+ mobs, block matters there
---
Wow... Even for vanilla that looks rough, I can see your pixels. Hope you've come up in the computer hardware world since then! I remember the dark portal as well, madness and then silence. It was so epic!
---
I remember being a clueless 15 year old and spent $500 on 512mb of the fastest ram I could find thinking that was gonna make WoW super smooth. I should of just opted for more ram instead of faster ram...
---
We are looking at a mid to late August launch.
---
Kinda cringy imo.
---
I predict horde will have more.
---
???? Explain yourself
---
Literally what?

/leave world
---
Saying that ‚Äúwarlocks scale better‚Äù isn‚Äôt really a good argument. I see people talk about hunters ‚Äúpoor scaling‚Äù a lot on this sub and it‚Äôs taken out of the only context it belongs in - Naxx raiding.
---
Hunter scaling issues are only relevant in 40 man raiding PROGRESSION past T2 gear levels. It‚Äôs not actually an issue at any other point of the game. (95% of the game...)
---
Hunters scale just fine until your raid is geared out in AQ40 gear and you want to push naxx. Seriously they CAN be the top dps as you progress through MC and BWL. To elaborate on this, when you‚Äôre decked out in AQ gear the other hard scaling dps pulls way ahead of hunters. Thanks to better sets, crit scaling etc.
---
But, when you NEED gear from MC/BWL, and even for a while when you NEED AQ gear, hunters ‚Äúpoor scaling‚Äù actually benefits them.
---
As for warlocks, a lot of people forget the fact that they suffer from serious threat issues, and they actually don‚Äôt become top quality dps until AFTER their guild has given them what they need from BWL/AQ. Essentially making them the opposite of hunters, only reaching peak for 5%? Of the games content.
---
Hunters are op for every 5 man and early raids. People often forget that. There‚Äôs much more to the game than farming AQ and progressing Naxx.
---
I'm predicting horde will have more people just from all the posts I'm seeing here.
---
Im in the same boat. Looking for a 24" 1080p with VESA mounting for my 2nd monitor.
---
Have a 27" 1440p 144hz main.
---
Any ideas for the second monitor?
---
Hey, that'd be a great idea. Ret would fill the same kind of role as Shadow Priests in that situation (as a one-of per raid for the debuffs/buffs)
---
Have we passed the likelihood that mid July is the date? Seems to me beta would be at least two months, right?
---
Honestly man I'm saddened that someone could feel that way. How could you feel so harshly for something so inconsequential. You're talking about an incident that happened 15 years ago to a minor. What is gained by not giving a school teacher his childhood account back? Do you think he's going to recidivate? Clearly no, then why not? Was it a personal afront to you? A child downloaded a botting program, it's not murder or rape. Forgiveness is the way forward not retribution. It's why our justice system here in America is a failure. I'm reminded of a quote: Its so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate, but takes guts to gentle and kind.
---
Relax brother, we're all here to fuck up and fix things together. His account was banned, rightly so. He paid the price. He grew up and understands why what he did was wrong. That's all that should be required.
---
P.S. It's a video game.
---
Yeah, no parry and block puts druid at a disadvantage. I plan on leveling 2 alts simultaneously with a druid by power leveling in instances and I'm interested to see if stacking reflect damage would be worth it. I plan on leveling a mage and shaman, so I'll have heals, stoneskin totem, and blizzard to use along with swipe and reflect damage on top of a bear druids ridiculous armor and health.
---
Thanks for the input. I've added shields and general non druidy items to the list.
---
Half of warriors that didn't choose the right faction don't enjoy the benefits of Windfury though.
---
It doesn't FEEL bad or difficult or slow though. You can kill 2 or 3 mobs at a time. You have escape options. You have the advantage of being able to stealth past mobs to get to objectives. You can solo individual elites. You can pvp alright in your leveling spec.
---
Warrior and paladin FEEL shitty. Their leveling experience is a Con. Rogue's isn't a Con, it's just not noteworthy at all so it isn't a Pro.
---
So when I repeatedly see people on 'What Should I Play?' telling others, or being tricked by others, that leveling is a reason to avoid picking rogue, it's irritating and not a valid reason. They're full of crap and maybe haven't even leveled as combat before. Rogues are not BAD levelers, or Slow levelers. They just aren't special. 
---
Even if we want to level as fast as possible and try to, most of us won't be anywhere near as fast as the guys who make the rankings. They are mostly irrelevant. And if you're a hunter, or rogue or warrior, it doesn't matter. There will always be that guy, regardless of his class, that plays 5h/day more than you. He's your competition. So whether rogue is 7th fastest, or 5th fastest, or whatever doesn't matter. Fuck it.
---
"but I am that guy who speed levels and plays all day, so you're wrong"
---
Well then you already know what class you'll play and aren't on here looking for advice. The people who genuinely need suggestions from strangers on what class to be are not you.
---
End rant.
---
This is probably the closest to it since I bought mine 4 years ago 
---
https://www.dxracer.com/us/en-us/product/1/gaming-chairs/formula-and-racing-series/oh-fh11-ne/
---
&gt;Yeah, no parry and block puts druid at a disadvantage.
---
It's not the damage taken that is the problem. It's the complete lack of aoe threat.
---
I think you're creating an image of something that didn't happen in your head. I'm not saying he's a rapist wtf. All I'm saying is I'm sad that Blizzard is taking a less harsh stance on botters then I thought they would.
---
&gt;Do you think he's going to recidivate? 
---
Honestly, I do. Not sure why you crammed words in my mouth. Botters tend to keep doing it.
---
He broke the rules, he paid SOME of the price then got what he wanted. 
---
This isn't the prison system, it's a video game. He can just make another account. That P.S. is so wildly tonedeaf to the rest of what you typed that I don't know if I'm being trolled or not.
---
I play monk and need this a lot
---
Edit: YES I KNOW MONK IS DEAD TO ME IN SUMMER
---
Prot warrior is a superior raid tank but I don't think you'll have trouble with 5 man's as a druid.
---
I'm thinking of going druid as well, but I'd probably heal. 
---
Torn between druid or pala healer tbh
---
Cervelat?
---
So the guild had server first AQ40 and Naxx, and you dont think they are the best?
---
Alright. Your opinion has been noted.
---
I'm playing for sure. I'm already rolling characters on private servers and leveling 1-20 over and over.
---
Just stop during combat
---
Ah, something I didn't take into consideration!
---
Lol. Elite.
---
Again, needlessly stacking or excluding classes does not make you elite.
---
Those 7 hours your sleeping, people will be getting ahead of you. Just remember that!
---
I think if I roll another hunter come classic I will be going troll for the OP racials, but Taurens always looked awesome!
---
Just not reading a thing I'm writing, eh?
---
Hunter for Life
---
I recently built a new PC (to play some Apex Legends with friends) however I've actually just spent all my time on \*ahem\*  a private server preparing for classic :&gt;
---
I just want a 60 as quickly as possible so I can ez-mode gold farm to make life a little better for my alts, which will be a slower more ‚Äúsmell the roses‚Äù kind of process.

That's cringey as fuck.
---
May 16, they announce the release 2 months later, July 16.
---
&gt;Melle are completely broken and 10x overpowered then they were in retail so hunters on private servers are shit.
---
Not disputing, but what evidence supports this claim? I love hunter so hearing there's a chance they may be better late game then on the PS excites me.
---
If that was ‚Äúblack voice‚Äù he did terrible. Like, so badly, you‚Äôre probably the only person who thinks he was making fun of black people. 
---
Sorry man, I just don‚Äôt agree. Pretty sure race had nothing to do with what they were doing here. More than likely, he was just trying to make a different sounding voice, and he‚Äôs not a paid voice actor. He probably thought he sounded like how stupid acting people (usually jocks) in old tv shows/movies are portrayed.
---
Please don‚Äôt jump to conclusions and take offense when it‚Äôs really a stretch to assume in the first place. It‚Äôs unnecessary. Hopefully you aren‚Äôt really offended by it - as I am quite certain no offense was intended!
---
:-)

Mizkif said something slightly fucked up to a girl streamer irl and Esfand just happened to be recording so Esfand and Mizkif got suspended.

It's nothing Esfand did but he got caught in the crossfire.
---
Crafting Professions will matter again!
---
You can craft items that are usually equal, if not upgrades all throughout leveling. 
---
The focus won‚Äôt just be on the most recent 3-4 patterns.
---
Frost, Madseason, and Countdown to classic are definitely the cream of the crop, imo.
---

Blood Elf Hunter, reason? Legolas
---
You have no clue what you're talking about. Hunters always scaled poorly in vanilla. The difference being that the bar was much lower back then in terms of performance and buff stacking wasn't nearly as widespread/normalized.
---
Melees are always going to scale better in 1.12, simply from the fact that they're melees and don't have hunters' weaknesses. Hunters are stuck scaling from auto/multi/aimed shots and have no weapon upgrades from BWL until 4HM/KT. That can be somewhat offset by decent pet micro (even though pets don't scale one bit) and melee weaving, but that won't put you on equal footing with melees, unless they're underperforming. Melees use more buffs and make better use of faction specific buffs (salvation/windfury) whereas hunters don't really benefit from either of those buffs because of FD/ranged.
---
Hell, hunters scale better on pservers than they did in Vanilla because some buffs/consumes are giving general AP instead of melee-only AP.
---
You're going to kite a lot as a hunter. 1-10 without a pet basically requires you to kite the entire time.
---
Just roll on a PVE server. they‚Äôll all be on pvp servers and honestly with the updated pvp gear coming out earlier than it should I find all the more reason to play a pve server and wait on battlegrounds. I don‚Äôt want to stomp through all the content because I‚Äôm wearing aq40 level pvp gear 6 months early.
---
Gameface bro! Gameface!
---
Sometimes the strategy varies. I think there's a lot of randomness, just looking for good coverage from a variety of hardware configs and stuff like that, but MoP was mostly people who bought the Annual Pass and got a free invite, and I think WoD invites favored longtime players and hardcore raiders.
---
&gt; Cervelat?
---
Cervelat, also cervelas, servelat or zervelat, is a sausage produced in Switzerland, France and parts of Germany. The recipe and preparation of the sausage vary regionally.
---
[Cervelat looks delicious](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cx0OB9bUsAE72ag.jpg) - but sadly Cervelo is just a bicycle.
---
Name checks out
---
Yes, very very weird
---
So you're saying I should fire up the ol' Pentium D that I put together to play original classic WoW and only log in from that when betas are coming up?
---
Playing on a PvE server for classic would bother me more than streamer problems.  To each their own though.
---
You say that like there is any other reason to sub?
---
YESSSSSSSSSS
---
I believe they started working on this during Legion so it's based off of the Legion client. I assume it's going to be like two different games. With no game data from the expansions.
---
Druids ARE pets ;-)
---
I still remember the day I first saw Pat's 1st original PvP video, before Battlegrounds were added. Before seeing it, I had originally rolled an Undead Warrior as an actual first character ever. I reached level 23 or so with him. Then that fateful day came, I think I was about 10? I watched the whole video, immediately created my very own  Tauren Woyer and from then on I became a Warrior by heart.
---
This time, however, I will be rolling an Undead Warrior, in honor of Heavymetal and Klinda. Those two are possibly my biggest idols in WoW like, ever.
---
Man for $33 that game was WORTH IT
---
Monday, September 23rd.
---
&gt;I think you're creating an image of something that didn't happen in your head. I'm not saying he's a rapist wtf. All I'm saying is I'm sad that Blizzard is taking a less harsh stance on botters then I thought they would.
---
It's not lessening your stance on botters. If Blizzard had caved in 2006 then we would be on agreement. Botting has no place in the game. It's 2019. The price has been paid, and clearly Blizzard agrees. 
---
&gt;Honestly, I do. Not sure why you crammed words in my mouth. Botters tend to keep doing it.
---
I'm sorry you can't see how someone can change over 15 years. If he wanted to bot, why on earth would he need this old account to do so? The only reason he wants it (I assume) is to relive the good times he had on that account. 
---
&gt;He broke the rules, he paid SOME of the price then got what he wanted. 
---
Man 15 years. That's paid in full. 
---
&gt;This isn't the prison system, it's a video game. He can just make another account. That P.S. is so wildly tonedeaf to the rest of what you typed that I don't know if I'm being trolled or not.
---
Everything is connected. Thinking that someone needs to continue to be punished for minor issue from 15 years ago is not an isolated sentiment. That's an idea  that many people in my nation subscribe too.  It's why you have people who's lives are in ruins because they got a drug charge as a youth. Forgiveness is the way. Whether it's for botting in a video game or for a real crime.
---
I really do not mean to put words in your mouth. You must understand that from my point of view everything is connected. Callousness in online gaming is directly related to callousness is real life (not saying that at you). From my own experiences, negative thoughts and ideas in one area always influences other areas of my life.
---
guys fucking chill jesus christ
---
My plan revolves around this - level a hunter first and enjoy world pvp and battlegrounds and early raids while leveling an alt priest who will eventually become my main for later raids.
---
Sometime this next week. Maybe Tuesday, maybe Friday, maybe Sunday? They've got the streamers and content creators about to spill the beans so it's going to be soon
---
Two things: 
---
1.) The other people in the zone would probably be in global chat and would no longer use the zone chat, at least not casually. From Vanilla I have distinct memories of rowdy Westfall and STV chat and I'm sure somewhere in there also exist faded memories of rowdy chats from other zones. I do not think that zone chats would be very active with global enabled. This is why I talked about the common bond with others in the zone.
---
2.) People said stuff like your comment about flying mounts and LFG and teleporting to dungeons and LFR and other things. "You can just use your ground mount" or "you can just make your own groups." Well yeah you can justify convenience over immersion 100 times in 100 different ways but I'd rather not start down that path again.
---
That doesn't change the BiS lists. They are always going to be 1.12 stats, as is the ones on the site.
---
Das isch e kl√∂pfer, kei cervolat :-P
---
Sry just kiddin. Thanks for biting!
---
mmm lifesteak
---
Isn‚Äôt there the shaman set bonus to grant a lightning shield? I think its T2? Maybe im mixing it up with something else. But then you would not get the retri aura. Cool concept!
---
Another note, not directly related to grouping with your friend.
---
/1 is not sharded. So "/1 LF1M Hogger, he should be up in a minute or two" will hit everyone, any response and invites will get you all together.
---
Global chat was in vanilla so I guess you're cool then?
---
I hope you'll find that useful  [https://vanillaguides.com/2018/07/30/1-300-lockpicking-guide-for-vanilla-world-of-warcraft-wow-classic/](https://vanillaguides.com/2018/07/30/1-300-lockpicking-guide-for-vanilla-world-of-warcraft-wow-classic/)
---
Where is the doge?
---
Good catch. My mouth is watering!
---
All the people saying no changes, not realizing global chat was a vanilla thing is really funny.
---
Actually i only got the warrior to lvl 15-20. After that i played rogue but now for classic i will roll a dwarf paladin, so excited for it
---
Does that mean the devs are making and testing classic addons themselves? Are these addons made from other devs specifically for retail? Are these addons made by other devs specifically for classic?
---
I'm struggling with these 2 choices myself :( I keep flipping between the two (at least I finally got it down to 2 choices)
---
Currently I am leaning more towards hunter now
---
since I know for sure I enjoy them (having leveled one to 60) and the fact that I feel like the early game will be 10x more enjoyable than end game because of the amount of players and awesomeness of a fresh server
---
they dont really fall off till AQ40/naxx which is so late in the timeline that I dont actually care that much.. also having no aggro dump on a warlock kinda sucks. Besides that I dont have much against warlocks only that I never leveled one in vanilla past lvl 14, so its hard for me to know if I will really enjoy them to 60. 
---
I never did 60 content at all so for all I know I might not enjoy hunter either, but I certainly did enjoy playing one to 60. Deadzone in small dungeon corridors and pet training ability ranks kinda sucked though...
---

Are swords useful in end game pvp (mainly BGs) or it's only daggers?  I'm playing one for the first time, using  swords. The damage is great but I keep thinking about the end game pvp. It feels like using swords is basically  giving up about 50% of the class, since some of the stealth abilities require daggers.
---
Set your battle station up in an abandoned parking garage basement level. Nice!
---
His pinned tweet "Call me crazy, but there‚Äôs something about the journey from 1-30 in particular in vanilla WoW that I‚Äôve always loved." lines up with other random rumors I've been reading that the beta will go up to 30 and will include Tarren Mill v. Southshore.
---
Instead of posting on the post that literally addresses this issue
---
&gt;creates a new post
---
Well your history shows alot of recycled stuff too
---
Lul pathetic,  bad idea too.
---
Never played a private server, speaking as a vanilla raider who killed everything while current up to KT in Naxx. We were solid through bwl, but besides a couple fights in AQ we are not amazing there, and we're God awful in Naxx. We took one, maybe two to Naxx in an entire 40 man raid. While on the other hand we had rogues and warriors for days. 
---
Also, you pretty much need Rhok'delar or the bwl crossbow to be competitive.
---
How little point is there to gear while leveling now? Two expansions in a row I've done nothing but run invasions on my alts (which give no gear) and just run some WQs after hitting level cap to get near raiding ilvl
---
Is there a group of class wallpapers like this? And where can I get them
---
Blizzard's classic won't tolerate the unmoderated sesspool that pservers world chat is. Racist trolls will prob get muted so fast your head will spin.
---
Yes, there is a simple opportunity cost as well though. The problem with having more mana seems to be it requires you to rely on mana more. I'm not saying I understand paladin's well enough to truly understand the opportunity cost here, so don't take what I'm saying as me saying you're wrong. If you take less damage from each hit and kill things quicker, you spend less mana on heals, which equals less overall mana spent on heals, which means more spirit use, and more mana for judgement. I don't have the numbers in front of me, but this type of theoretical math is my jam.
---
It always baffles me how a team of game designers couldn't come up with this stuff back in the day. Pretty much all the classes/specs i've been interested in during my time playing WoW are unfortunately hybrids, so i'm having a hard time picking what to play in Classic. Hopefully we'll get TBC servers some day and then we can all play the roles we want without being super gimped/shunned by raids.
---
I have 2 druids as well.
---
omg did you really edited your comment from ''gay'' to ''cool'' ? hahahahahha
---
Give it a shot. Upload your worst specs to them.
---
Yes sir, when it comes to learn something new.
---
Its Very frustrating at start to say the least.
---
For example learning guitar as lefty.
---
I feel too comfortable with lefthand to try anything with righthand now, it just feels wrong.
---
when it comes to gaming, I don't have any issues anymore but one thing sucks, early access games that don't support editable keybinds.
---
Done! Will you post results when you're done?
---
I intend to do the same with a shaman.
---
I dont see a euro symbol
---
You also cannot use engineer bombs in bear, druid is simply not suited for more than 3 targets, sure you can tank like 5 bt that‚Äòs it probably ,if you wanna hold threat
---
Not saying ferals are bad, i‚Äòm gonna main one
---
I wouldn't mind more aggressive server merges and transfer availability if it took care of dead servers.
---
That beautiful Model M... I can hear it from all the way over there...
---
Yeah. Having people camp graveyards and dungeons for pvp gear that came out at the end of the expansion just doesn‚Äôt sound fun to me. I played PVP server in classic but with the odd rotation of items releasing I just don‚Äôt see it as fun this time around.
---
Obviously you can't maintain gear forever but you could easily maintain the usefulness of basic materials forever. Instead of RandomWeave Cloth being added, add a secondary type of material in the new recipe. Take same concept and apply to leather and metal and enchantments etc. 
---
Thus if you add an expansion you keep core content evergreen and allow lower level players to make money through that system.
---
Honestly this would be a better progression system for raid drops as well, that dragon doesn't drop a pair of pants.. he drops some scales. C'thun doesn't drop a staff he drops tendrils and eyelids and corrupted essence of a God to craft into gear.
---
Ahh well, ideas right?
---
Lvl 19 battlegrounds? That would work with what we know so far.
---
I've heard strength wasn't that important for pallys. So you'd I'm not doing myself too much of a disservice by running the old leather or cloth green/blue instead of white mail piece?
---
The datamined files even indicate that server transfers are one of the only shop features they kept in Classic so while free transfers likely won't be a thing there will be options.
---
Actually it's over 4 months away.
---
It‚Äôs okay you won‚Äôt have to download a cooldown counter when Classic launches.
---
that would mean blizz forcing all streamers to pick 1 realm if they want to stream?
---
how would they enforce it ?the idea is okay. but i can't see it happening without blizz coordinating with classic streamers and agreeing on this.
---
Rammstein‚Äôs new album drops 17 May.

Without knowing anything about the game I rolled Tauren Hunter first.  I played him to about level 45 or so.  He's still sitting there on Dragonmaw with his Herod's shoulder and his cat with no upgraded skills and no clue at all.  If I roll another hunter at some point it may well be a Tauren.
---
I think anyone who can say with a straight face that Aion is better than even BfA, *let alone* Vanilla, is someone you can laugh at and disregard. Why do you even care about convincing him? He's not planning on playing the game; you are. And I assure you 100% that Classic will be a worthy experience for someone who started with WotLK.
---
Instead of providing a reasonable response you abstractly mention a different post, look through my post history, call me pathetic, then offhandedly address my post.
---

Although I just read about duel wield damage. Specifically off-hand damage.
---
Your OH has 19% base chance to miss and 50% less damage than MH.
---
Given how shit that is if I‚Äôm gonna leave out a skill in combat tree, I think Dual Wield Spec might be the best contender to NOT get
---
There is no reasonable response for someone like you. 
---
You know what you did.
---
Enjoy the F tier idea. Would hate to have the brain that thought of that one.
---
Typically when someone makes a claim they're expected to back it up.
---
I could see how you took it that way, let me explain better. If a streamer has a problem with something in game (due to streaming) if they aren't on that server, it's more of a tough shit situation. Not actively forcing, but incentivizing. If that makes more sense?
---
The most memorable moments were jumping shooting a multi shot white damage and keeping distance with cheetah where they can‚Äôt hit you.  Ice traps, also frost traps on sons of flames or whatever from ragnaros before we had dps to kill before he sunk. 
---
And survivability, potions, traps, disables, bandaids, I would sit in front of ironforge for hours dueling over and over, those were the days ;).
---
This is something I worry about also. For me, a large part of the magic of this game was the awe and discovery that was mostly fueled by my ignorance. I remember a time when deadmines was new to me and seemed insurmountable. Just walking around and exploring was enough to keep me entertained. Finally leveling and saving up for a mount made me feel like a badass. 
---
I fear that the knowledge and efficiency that I will play with now might take away from the magic in a sense, but I am still excited. Nostalgia is powerful as well.

---
400gold?
---
That‚Äôs like 400.000 of retail gold
---
Part of why I'm excited to play Classic is the fact that I played on a potato in vanilla days. I can't help thinking if I could be decent back then with 5-10fps I should be actually good ish with my current hardware lol
---
I don‚Äôt get it. You pay 400g to watch the first in line get the item? Explain it for dummies please.
---
But I want to play WoW.
---
Does height play a role possibly? How tall are you? Or I guess more specifically torso length would be the applicable measurement here.
---
Good in theory, but you will also want to be running this by the people who you will be raiding with and let them pick it apart
---
Also believe they will push to September
---
You pay the 400g to skip up the list into second place if the top of the list passes on it.

#NoChanges
---
That's a curiously narrow perspective. Would you make the same statement about any person involved in any form of entertainment? Actors? Artists? Writers?
---
There are other ways to contribute to society than being an auto mechanic or a doctor. If there weren't these streamers would not be successful, would run out of money, and would find another way to spend their time. Your apparent scorn isn't of much use to anyone.
---
paladin or warrior first.
---
I'm thinking paladin since I enjoy paladin and i think healing will be easier to take on at first than tanking and also to aoe farm fairly well to have a character capable of sustaining buying consumables instead of making them for example and later level a warrior for tanking.
---
Or I could just avoid all that and go warrior first but I'm worried about the early endgame gold making and sustainability of a warrior. But the ability to put up a decent fight in wpvp during levelling and sort of the cool factor too is compelling.
---
Does anyone remember whether Shadowmeld broke upon casting Aimed Shot or after it landed/finished casting?
---
Must get kinda chilly in the basement up against those concrete walls.
---
Oh shit this would be awesome. Hopefully they're merciful and give us an open beta but I'm guessing us peons won't be able to play right away
---
It skips 150-175 for horde, is this leveled with lockboxes?

That episode got me into WoW as well. I had friends trying to get me to join, but I resisted. Then I saw that episode with my brother and we got trials.

Same boat. Want to play Warlock. Either Orc or Human.
---
Don‚Äôt like humans but I‚Äôm considering it because I‚Äôve never played alliance, also the other option is gnome and I cannot stand gnomes
---
Bro if i dont get a decent nights rest ill end up hallucinating lol. Learned that a long time ago. Not worth it to sacrafise sleep for more play time. Gotta alwaye get at least some sleep
---
Tons of various things that combine to make melle Gods on Pservers. 
---
Some random things such as talents broken(fury /sit macro), broken proc rates on items(Ironfoe having 15% proc rate), low armor on raid bosses. Countless more examples like those 3 through-out Pservers. 
---
I think though one of the biggest and least aknowledged things is the World buff/flask stacking on Pservers. 
---
On Pservers, World buffs/Flasks are insanely easy to get and use. You can use multiple world buffs in a single night!! Back in real vanilla, world buffs and flasks were extremely extremely limited. They were only used if your guild officers were 100% certain your guild would take down a raid boss for the first time after lots of practice. 
---
World buffs/Flasks are incredibly overpowered on Melle, it is esentially like having 3-5 more pieces of gear. World buffs/flasks also are absolute shit on hunters, not completely terrible but fairly minimal gains, whereas warriors become demi-gods with World buffs/flasks. 
---
On Pservers nearly every raid, for every boss had every single player stacked with world buffs/flasks, all the time. In retail vanilla it won't be even remotely close to that. 
---
Overall, if you want to play hunters, PLAY IT! I played hardcore as hunter in retail vanilla and completed Naxx as a raid logger because all I did was world pvp. Hunters are great in MC/BWL and equal with warlocks in AQ/Naxx. Don't let the Private server neckbeards here tell you otherwise, they are completely clueless. Hunters on horde especially are much better than warlocks due to easy threat management. 
---
Hunters are also the best 1v1 duel/world pvp class in the game, and nobody else comes close outside of Soul Link warlocks.
---
&gt;Its more rock paper scissor
---
Don't forget mushroom!
---
Some drops are very rare and people get desperate. \~ Half the price of an epic mount isn't that unreasonable.
---
&gt; The server architecture right now lags, and LAGS BAD whenever a large event is attempting to take place. You can see this when Streamers like Asmongold try to do a For The Alliance run, and as far as I can tell; they plan on using the same type of client-server software that is used to run the game right now. I get this from the fact that they are hellbent on using 7.3.5-8.0 Client software that will use the same types of servers that BFA currently uses. I am very fearful about this decision away from the Reference client.
---
This is HUGE and there's been very little discussion or communication from Blizzard about this topic. If we're using the modern infrastructure, which completely fails the MMO test, where is the promise that we won't experience this in Classic?
---
This is so much more important that people freaking out over which server is supposedly unplayable because a streamers guild is on it.
---
I still have the Cardboard Orc! Best thing ever. It wasn't available for purchase, but if you're ever in a store and you see them about to toss out a promotional cardboard cutout, ask them and they might just give it to you. I'll be honest, I don't even drink mountain dew
---
It is a bit banged up after a few moves though :(
---
That value is localized so it depends on the time zone setting of your computer. Guessing you're in mountain time?
---
EDIT: 5/19 is the date that has been teased by other content creators so who knows
---
I actually hope it's somewhere there or simply in late August. But I somehow trust you, thought. August 27th it is!
---
Hear me out; find a streamer like shroud that may play for a week or two and go back to their main games. Roll the opposite faction they roll- all the streamer fan boys will roll their faction = good chance at being dominant faction?
---
It's ridiculous. The stat squishes mean there's almost no gain in stats level to level under 100, and the scaling means you get weaker as you  level past 110, while 100-110 was designed to be played with an artifact weapon which you effectively won't have now
---
Personally I'd go with endurance training over IAotH for a lazyhunter spec. He's probably going to be in cheetah most of the time if aspect-switching requires too much input and the hawk proc is prone to hugenormous amounts of waste depending on when it procs.
---
or you could make it like instead of paying money to be bumped up you just get bumped up for being a nice person and helping guild mates with consumables and stuff

Every loot is hunter loot

Your opinion on a video game isn't really worth shit unless you've played it, honestly.
---
Nice post!
---
&gt;  you are a fool if you think being a high skill Vanilla pvper is more difficult than being a 2200-2500 3v3 player now
---
That depends. Vanilla PvP had very little similarities to Arena and especially modern Arena as you describe it.
---
The majority of the time it was PUG vs. PUG BG which was chaotic and sometimes dominated by individuals or small groups or just flat out RNG in the sense that you accidentally had a better composition for the BG or people who had a similar style. Example: The other side had a couple of decent Paladins and Warriors, and your side didn't have Shamans/Priests to dispell their buffs, well good luck. Or your side had a FC and they didn't have anyone who was suited for that role? Look forward to a turtlefest and eventually winning regardless. Most PUG vs. PUG matches were decided by random momentum and one side giving up.
---
Now Premade vs. PUG was a farmfest, where the goal was to win as fast as possible. Anything that had a crushing/demoralizing effect was optimal, such as a frontal hard engage to just roll over the opponents and then cap as many flags as possible, if not all in AB. Not much skill there either.
---
Premade vs. Premade was unfortunately rare... Not because there weren't enough premades (on my server with average pop there were several). But because one side asserted dominance after a few matches and the other one started to queue dodge. But roughly equally skilled premade BGs were very fun and had quite some tactical depth. Battlegrounds are extremely different from Arena, they are basically two different games, especially AB.

What's the point in Improved Voidwalker if you get it so late? Leveling Warlocks should rush to Improved Voidwalker so they aren't pulling aggro off it so easily.

Yep, 100% agreed that 5/5 DWS is the first thing to drop from typical spec for leveling - I wasn't focusing on the OP's imp-sprint question as much there as I avoid wpvp assiduously and mostly use sprint for movement rather than as a cooldown. Relative to how rogues deal damage in raids, leveling is much more weighted towards specials and the frontloaded 100 energy for every fight. You'll still deal majority-white, but DWS is mostly powerful under the assumption that you'll have 100% SnD uptime and be CP-limited.

yeah seriously i was 8 yo back then but watching it now its so ovbvious
---
If you flip the list, you risk the very real possibility that someone who just got a piece of highly desired gear suddenly finds himself right back at the top.
---
THANKS
---
Seems decent. I think your main problems will be to make sure that everyone joining the raid fully understands the system, and to make them actually want to use it. One of the advantages of traditional systems is that everyone is already familiar with them, so you would probably also have to explain to your raiders what exactly makes this system better than the other alternatives. 
---
Also, upvoted for creative post
---
I mean if you wanna keep it real I'd bet it's gonna be very very low.

There aren't bgs until months after release. Probably haven't even touched them yet.

If i were to go druid, if i wanted to DPS say in raids. Should one go feral or Balance?
---
And is engineering still the go to profession for druid? I am guessing always yes on all classes but worth to ask anyway. If not engineering what else to pick for professions?
---
Also how is druid (not healer) in WPvP? Or BGs?

That infobar at the top is likely what was killing your framerate. I remember that addon alone dropped me nearly 30 frames.

Good point.
---
The list flip is from the original order before any boss kills.
---
My problem is that this incentivizes farming gold to get gear faster and makes rich players get gear faster than poor players for, well, no apparent reason.
---
A well-run Vanilla guild is communist. When you get a piece of gear, it wasn't because you needed it. It was because the *guild* needed it *through* you. Part of the ship, part of the crew sorta deal. If your teammate got gear, that means *you* were doing better. Distributing gear equally amongst the guild, or prejudicially in favor of those who will help the guild more in some meaningful manner, is the difference between good leadership and bad leadership, and players who go into raids thinking that they're there to get gear as opposed to progressing with their guildmates are players with warped mentalities.
---
You've essentially created a system in which players can backstab each other to get gear faster by bribing the guild bank "because they want it more". That's going to sow discord and envy throughout the raid, and it also goes against the original philosophy of SK as a loot method that distributes gear equally to an almost mechanical fault. I'd recommend against it.
---
I'm def not looking foward to the anger of content creators having access. I wish I could hug all of you in this SR.
---
That just makes it so everyone else will leave and not raid with you again.
---
You reward people who show up consistently, not reward the guy that just joined with more gold that will quit once his item drops.
---
It's a shit system, mate.
---
The issue is that gamers often have a very narrow definition of "skill". They just mean "mechanical skill" or "mechanics", which includes precision, hand eye coordination, reaction, speed etc. All of the things you listed above have very little to do with mechanical ability and more with preparation, knowledge and decision making.
---
Which race did you play? Did you make good use of it's racial? I'm torn between Nightelf, Dwarf and Tauren. #1 choice is female NE. That sick bow animation and looks &lt;3 But Cow and Dwarf look great as well and those racials seem to be good.
---
Haha. I hear ya. I‚Äôm not going to play human because what‚Äôs the fun in that!!? Gnomes are annoying and I‚Äôm just not a huge fan of night elves.
---
It has always been like that, there's literally no point in arguing when different opinionated tastes clash. When that happens you just talk about a different topic and move on.
---
They just keep getting better and better.
---
What. Are you dumb? How can you enforce that?
---
What would you do if I started the game at the "non approved streamer server" but started streaming and then actually got big. Ban me? Forcefully move my character?
---
This idea is so dumb that I'll just act like you never said it, and hopefully the mods will remove this dumb post soon enough
---
That awkward moment when apt word choice and remaining calm are viewed negatively. You clearly have such an aptitude for understanding the human psyche (or just mine specifically) that you have been able to analyze my baseline emotional state, deduced how I internally responded, then inferred how I crafted my response as a way to convey myself in an inauthentic manner. You may think I'm an idiot, but I don't care, because you're quite rash.

You didn't argue your point against him very well. You effectively just said "Right, but that's just how it is"  
---
For this reason, it will fail. Your healers and tanks will not appreciate the system and they'll find a better one. Your system heavily favors DPS spec classes.  
---
A possible solution is to require a lesser payment from tanks and healers, but you're already getting into deep water with that idea.
---
Your friend shouldn‚Äôt be a friend
---
Well' It's fun to think about at least
---
Sigh, a June release for classic would actually make this even bigger. Two months after that a lot of peoples lives get busy
---
I personally didn't like it either. But my younger brother kind of found his main because he was able to play Pally on Horde side and had the most fun with that class, became a really good healer in raids.
---
Pam gets it
---
I see that now. Derp.
---
This is probably a better approach. A guild contribution points system. You can spend your contribution points to jump up the list. Not the entire list though. 1 position movement upwards cost x amount.

lol. no furniture but the bastard has a god damn curved screen.

"Hunters are almost the best 1v1 duel/world pvp class in the game, and nobody else comes close outside of Soul Link warlocks, who absolutely dumpster hunters and everyone else in 1v1, so badly that even people who play them acknowledge it's not really balanced or fair."
---
FTFY. Thank you for the fond memories of using a hunter pet as an extra Nightfall proc battery, while otherwise ensuring it's persistent irrelevance via fear chaining. I was almost sad for my prey when they'd realize what I was doing and try to duel me without a pet. Almost.

No, I'm sorry that I didn't clearly convey what I was thinking. Absolutely no form of enforcement whatsoever. The idea is that you have a specific server that Blizzard can be open to discussion about, without effecting every server as a whole. You know what I mean? In no way am I implying that Blizzard should be actively punishing streamers, just providing an alternative environment. Is that more clear?
---
I bet you are one of those cool guys who wont play vanilla at all due to the sharding in the starting zones?

I've seen an unhealthy amount of you guys around. No idea how you spread like disease though

Heh, I feel you...but it completed the collection

Sell the other side looks nice! 7/7 for that one
---
I kinda preach this and more info will come I can guarantee you. But for sure the fear is that we can fill  60 servers with massive players and queues then see what we have today in 2 months which is 2-3 servers highly populated and 56 on low cause of streamers leaving etc.
---
But you never know stress tests could be a thing.
---
Probably tough for you to isolate the difference when you've been cursed with both.
---
I have a slightly deeper examination in mind. Have you considered whether or not this guy is a complete loss to you? I imagine you stand there sometimes, looking at him, and thinking "this guy is so below me"  
---
He sounds like he speaks in a dominating way, and I really hope he doesn't talk to you like that. If you're the kind of guy to just "take it", then I think you have an opportunity here to straighten up your spine and tell him he can get fukt.  
---
I'm also going to go out on a limb here and say he's probably a virgin. Also without googling it, aren't those games just microtransaction-heavy weeb games? I really don't know.  
---
Edit: Yeah, they are. Tell him he's a giant weeb and you don't hang out with weebs.

Where do you want me to begin?

1. Not sure why reckoning is in this conversation. Most people are aware that sitting is not going t work, and he didn't mention it.
---
2. Stamina is almost always better than armor because a small increase in armor is only like &lt;1% physical damage reduction.
---
3. You shouldn't need to stack intellect because you should be using blessing of wisdom and pacing your mana consumption.
---
Deathshrimp he went by in the AoE era. AoE2 and Classic WoW are two games he worked on that still have huge followings over a decade later.
---
Logic will tell you 8.2 comes out 3 weeks later 8.2.5 with the raid. Then 2 months to do the content. June is 100% out of the question and July 16th count down website should shut that down
---
Sharding for starting zones is reasonable for server stability and actual playability. Having or not having a specific chat channel won't.
---
Chris is waiting for classic wow
---
Jesus what an overreaction
---
Having to pay for loot sounds like the dumbest fucking idea ever. I assume your guild is extremely casual, but still, your progression is going to be awful.
---
There really is only one way to divide loot, as long as you play to progress and not just to have fun and dick around.
---
If you want to progress, you use a loot council. Loot is such an arbitrary thing in WoW, that if your council or raiders cant handle loot being distributed to maximize the group, those guys are retarded.
---
And if you just play for fun, literally just let everyone roll. Who cares who gets the loot if thats the case. 
---
So, TLDR: Your loot system is extremely stupid and is massively defeated by the two main systems already in the game.
---
&gt;  time frozen forever
---
There is a very easy solution. Just don't increase the player level after 60. The game would be much richer by now if it was a continous progression rather than these huge gaps. Part of it could have been horizontal and part vertical progression as the devs see fit.
---
What patch version is this book?
---
When you realize it was staged
---
I'll be honest, I started in BC, so I had to find the WoW collectors edition on eBay (used). No way was I paying for an unopened Vanilla Collectors.
---
I know it happened and others here have seen it too. My vague memory is that it was things like a druid twink in 10-19 or a premade group with a pocket healer who were there to grief their own team who did it. And it was pretty rare which is why I don't really want to take part in a huge thread about it, if it happens two or three times in your whole WoW career at most it's not that big a deal.
---
Agreed. Show him who‚Äôs the boss of the gym.
---
No changes also means leave it in then
---
 You don‚Äôt do anything.
---
Simply let her play and experience it the way she wants to. There is no point in forcing anyone into a certain play style.
---
Don‚Äôt give her tips (except maybe for a few basic ones). If she doesn‚Äôt have fun playing it, there‚Äôs really not much you can do. But classic is great because it gives you freedom to play however you want to.

Somebody make this man lead game designer for BFA!

A good guild uses a council, cause its the only fucking reasonable thing to do.
---
"Okay, we need more DPS in order to kill boss 6 that we are progressing. This sword is very good for Rogues, lets hand it to the Rogue that will improve the most with it". Its as easy as that. If other people who dont need the items as much cant handle that, they are honestly just stupid morons, and provides more to the group if they just hit the road.
---
There is a reason every single progression minded guild in the world uses Council. And before you say "40 people, hard to divide bla bla bla" No, its not. Its extremely easy.
---
Why are we even arguing such a dumb thing. Either roll if you are casual or use a council if you want progress
---
Your chair is broken
---
They are banning quickhealz tho
---
Just play with her and level with her but don‚Äôt boss her around. Just let her explore and figure things out. She‚Äôll probably play terribly slow compared to how you would play, but let her and follow her pace. Tell her little easter eggs or lore you may know about certain area‚Äôs.
---
Most important: make this HER experience until she‚Äôs gotten into it. 
---
When classic releases then its YOUR time to shine ;)
---
About the classes: explain what the classes are and how they play and then let her pick what appeals to her most.
---
My wife and I are waiting for classic and then she's going to choose. She looked at the class descriptions online one night and was leaning towards hunter. I'm gonna roll something with heals so that we can tag team stuff easy
---
My advice to you would be to play a support role to whatever class she likes. I know I'm going to be having a ton of fun if my wife is stoked on it as well
---
Thank you üòä
---
The horde flavor was great. The alliance flavor was garbage.
---
I hate the Alliance but still, amazing battlestation!
---
That's great advice. I gotta fight the urge to help her!
---
Hi, /u/jacbojiukes
---
I bet you play alliance
---
Same here. Ping sucked but they were oceanic.
---
Allow her to watch the cinematic, as well as the in-game "intro" for whichever race she chooses. Advise her to select upon aesthetics only, do not discuss racial spells. Show her the ropes of basic movement and spell use (she will likely move with ASDF and click spells...perfectly acceptable).
---
Be brief with how the game is played..."the game is about quests" as they say in South Park. Explain what the ! And ? mean, then go!
---
The only reason I was able to game is because my school was chucking out old dells. I managed to break the back to jam a graphics card in it. Took me 5 mins to load after wipes. Guild grudgingly took me along for my tanking.

This puts a priority on gearing classes that are better at farming gold instead of distributing gear in a way that maximizes raid progression.
---
Any loot system that isn't loot council circumvents the primary goal of distributing loot in a matter that maximizes raid progression, so any other loot system could be "picked apart" on the basis of that fact.
---
On Suicide Kings / DKP in general:
---
There is an argument to be made that vanilla WoW raids are so easy that you don't need to maximize loot distribution to progress successfully. If you believe that, then you can consider a system that distributes loot more evenly instead of pumping your main tank / healers / best DPS / whatever. 
---
But then that decision essentially comes down to preference (and some other things like the skill level of your raid team) and personally I tend to side with maximizing raid progression even if it means that guy #40 obtains loot at a bit less frequent rate. 
---
In other words, some raid members gaining loot less frequently than other members is a worthwhile tradeoff if it means that the raid force can clear content faster, more efficiently, and more successfully. Generally those enhancements means that your guild can obtain more raid loot overall which assists with offsetting the downside that some members gain loot less frequently than others.
---
Ditto

Awesome! Nice walls!

Whats the mic and sound editing monitor setup for? You a narrator or singer or something?

At the start.

It has no class restrictions, nor does the eye. And druids can use 2 handed maces.
---
Is that a picture of you getting progressively chubby
---
Let her play and experience it on her own like you did. Trying to help or pull her along can make it feel rushed and put more pressure on something that should be natural and at her own pace.
---
No it's all the Orcs. Humans didn't do anything wrong but minor spats here and there. Humans are right and the Orcs caused pretty much every bad thing to happen. 
---
They BROUGHT the legion and it's their fucking fault. They better pull their weight in defending Azeroth as dumb brainless savages who just exist to step into the meat grinder while the superior Alliance does the ACTUAL heavy lifting. And the Orcs didn't "force us out" they attacked suddenly and won a FEW skirmishes here and there before the Alliance grouped up and curb stomped them ez pz. Human expansion shit on beasts like talking cows and blood thristy savage trolls who are no better than Orcs, so no huge loss. No one cries foul when anyone takes land from the quill boar or kobold. Theyre just animals who can (kinda) speak a language. 
---
You speak of honor but wouldn't know honor if it came up and split your big stupid skull. 
---
But yeah, faction wank aside, both side have done some outright stupid things while doing some great things as well. The Alliance less so than the Horde though so we're still better. :D

you sound like a stuck up pretentious wank when you talk like this.
---
christ just be normal
---
I remember the Alliance Blue flavor being chalky.
---
Is movementg√ºnthers really a saying on english servers? Only ever heard it on german ones
---
This is ~~gold~~ platinum
---
I hope you have a shit bucket prepared in advance.
---
Convince to wait would be the best advice possible. I can't believe all the people hyped about Vanilla starting private servers right now, let alone instant lvl 60 servers.
---
Meh. Bad edit.
---
Between old alliance players wanting to try something new and people wanting to join the side that dominated PVP, this can't be a surprise
---
I would never join a guild with this system.
---
This is about as cringy and sad as things get. The worst part of it is that I reckon you're probably a pedophile.
---
holy shit thats clean
---
I don't know about getting her interested.
---
However if she isn't familiar with the interface and hotkeys I'd suggest you walk her through the steps of making her first quests, e.g. "move pressing this keys, attack pressing this keys, click on the guy with the symbol on top of his head to be offered a quest, this is how you loot, this is how you put on gear". Basically watch her play and tell her what you would do and how to do it. After she makes a few quests with this method now you should be able to play together easily (compared to starting both on different computers, it should improve things a lot).
---
It feels redundant. 400g evenly divided amongst 40 players is 10g. Even though the person who payed 400g should not get any of that money back. So technically it's 400g divided by 39 - so 10g 25 silver. But for ease let's just say 10g flat.
---
In MC there are 10 bosses. If 10 people bought items that would be every other member got 100g back. But since most bosses drop 2 items (if I recall correctly) that would mean everyone would get 200g by the end of the run. Point being, there is not any real loss or cost. Person A who drops 400g on an item would get 190g back by the end of that raid, and then 200g the next raid and thus it never really costed them anything because they passively got it back by just doing the raid they would already do.
---
Of course that assumes every item from every boss gets bid on which likely would not happen (at least every raid), but you get the idea.
---
It might feel sketchy as a member but I feel like it might more sense for the money to go a guild fund that pays for consumables and such? Then it's sort of a tangible benefit for the raids. The raw 10g per person per item is ncie but then hypothetically people would put towards whatever and be stingy with their money whilst saving towards something. This was it saves everyone else time and money for consumables and ensures everyone has them? I don't know, not saying it would workout but just a thought!
---
Either way interesting take on a loot system! I do enjoy the concept of being able to vi for items even if you're not first in line.
---
I would say Mage or Hunter. Not too hard and easy to play for new players! I think she will like the Alliance zones more if she is into fantasy/RPG. Would be awesome if you guys could play together when Classic comes out. Wish you the best and have fun leveling! üòäüëçüèº
---
I want to play priest, going to level as Shadow, but I've read to heal dungeons around Sunken Temple and BRD I it's better to go full healspec?
---
Can I still do quests/farm easily at lvl 60 as healspec?
---
Sidequestion: which build is best to heal dungeons and quest/farm on the side?
---
*\*cries in feral\**
---
What makes horde better in world pvp? On private servers horde is always outnumbered everywhere they go in the world.
---
That's exactly my biggest fear going into classic too. I wanna raid as a Feral DPS on a PvP Servers but there are several problems.
---
1. Feral DPS on Horde side isn't as good as the alliance one.
---
2. but i don't know if Horde will be more dominant in world PvP.
---
3. I don't know if alliance will be as dedicated to raiding/being good in the game in General than Horde.
---
4. Feral looks ugly On Horde side, u can add that to 1. too.
---
I like how you have a little bed set up for the two hours of sleep a night you'll need.
---
No, I never used one of those. Honestly, just to look at the thing, it doesn't seem like something I'd much like.
---
I've been using Kensington Expert Mouse K64325's since no later than 2006. Might have been earlier, I'm having trouble recalling what i started Vanilla on. Gone through two since then if my memory is serving me properly, and #3 is what I'm using now - though it's falling apart at the seams; hence the Elecom.
---
Long ago, it was some weird shit, like Logitech's Trackman Stationary Mouse... sheesh, they're just such tanks it's not a terribly varied history. :)
---
I love the monitor that's tipped vertical/sideways. I may have to try that
---
If you enjoy hybrids, I'd recommend taking a look at resto/ele specs for Shaman. They give up very little healing ability to pick up reasonably powerful elemental abilities (you're still relegated to healing in raids but you can hold your own in solo content/pvp)
---
This pretty much answers my question, thanks for the detailed response. So I should be wearing more stam/strength than Stam/int for solo questing? I can't remember where but I read strength wasn't really that worth it.
---
Why?
---
Not as big of a deal as humans reputation racial imo.
---
Another winner.
---
I've got the one that will handle all of the 1.12 content through AQ40 and the t0.5 set quests.  Super stoked.
---
Right right. Especially for ZG rep. I read the gnome racial is 5% off of your base intellect so it doesn‚Äôt scale with gear. Just want to min max
---
I reckon this went over your head.
---
Once you try it, you can never willingly go back.
---
Man! You forgot Platinum Wow!!!
---
I got into mists beta on an inactive sub and on my active sub haha.
---
It‚Äôs nothing. I think even in Naxx gear it‚Äôs like 0.3% extra crit. Human diplomacy racial is probably more valuable for pve because of all the rep grinds you‚Äôll have to do.
---
People roll gnome mage so much because escape artist is broken in pvp.
---
Tried Aion, vanilla is better. You're friend is full of himself.
---
By "helping" her, do you mean pointing her towards the most efficient specs and stuff? That might not be very healthy. If she doesn't take her gaming seriously, she can get turned off by the metagame. Some people just prefer to deal with games in a laid back fashion, as interactive movies or something.
---
So, first you have to know how serious she can/wants to get, then deal with it from there. Maybe she can be a fellow hardcore raider, maybe she just wants to level a character, one quest a day. There's only so much you can do to influence what she'll do.
---
And once she picks, you've got to go along. Marriage and free will do not go together!
---
generally i'd say pick the race you personally think has the best animation and overall looks the best, seeing you'll be spending a lot of time on your character.
---
My hunter was an Orc. Orcs have increased pet damage and a 25% increased chance to resist stun effects. As a hunter, i found this to be godlike in PvP. The stun resist actually procced quite often. Imagine being a rogue and having a hunter, which already do well vs rogues, resist a 5 combo-point kidney shot. Thats massive. The general consensus is that the orc racial is the best one for hunters in PvP. I'll always play an Orc hunter, but as stated earlier, just play what ever you find the most appealing. Unless you want to min-max, it all comes down to personal preference.
---
Nice one! Is that your full time job?
---
So what monitor do you play games on? The left one?
---
Were starting at lvl 1 for sure. I gotta ease her into it. She's never played wow before. She played diablo with me when D3 launched and played to max level then stopped
---
Lol no
---
I may have been like 10 during Vanilla, but it never occured to me to put it last... #Huntard4Eva
---
modui, moveanything, eliteplayerframe, cooldowns.
---
He means servers located in the region. I also had my first character on Khaz'goroth but we were still getting big delays due to latency.
---
of course
---
Keep this forever
---
They‚Äôre not removing the raid frames.
---
No way will they ever do that.
---
That will turn her off to the whole experience.  Let her explore and have fun even if it seems stupid AF to you.
---
Sword rogues are quite viable. You won't always have the luxury of opening a fight how you want so you don't always get the benefit of Ambush anyways. 
---
I always played mine with daggers but Combat Sword rogues can stand toe to toe in melee.
---
are you that security guard who got hit with a skateboard
---
Just support her playstyle and feed her curiosity. She'll be slow and inefficient - which is how we all started - and you have to sit back and enjoy that particular ride. It lays the foundations for the vanilla's magic of discovery and achievement. DON'T GIVE HER SHORTCUTS. You know all the tricks already, but the journey IS the destination. Relive your first steps in WoW through her, with her.
---
Imagine your character is her character's inexperienced sidekick. Step in with advice or suggestions only when she asks, or MAYBE if she seems to be expecting you to determine the next step. Even then, you should try to craft suggestions that put her back in the driver's seat, and encourage her to re-engage. Be supportive and reflect her enthusiasm about anything she seems into; Does she like herbalism? You'd better dig deep for your inner gardener and get super fucking stoked to tell the story of Azeroth's two greatest flower-pickers. Does she think that chest-piece downgrade is super cute? Now you're having a blast playing World of Fashioncraft!
---
And let her hang it up when she wants to, not when you want to. Forcing it is sure to make her hate it.
---
This is actually one of the cleanest Vanilla UIs I've ever seen.  I'm sure in a raid it'll turn into a tumbling clusterfuck, but overall it's really sharp.
---
Thanks for the feels, OP
---
It definitely scales with gear. Otherwise it would be entirely worthless.
---
Why? It doesn't cause any sort of game imbalance. Those who don't want upright do not have to choose the option.
---
There's the WoW Atlas to the right back, then the original strategy guide just below it, right bottom. Other than the 1st edition of dungeon companion, am I missing any others?
---
Corby?
---
Northamptonshire represent!
---
I am surprised the ink/thermal print hasn't faded on that thing. I recently stumbled across a jar of 20 year old receipts which I forgot about...they were all just blank pieces of paper.
---
poor bait 2/10
---
Hi, /u/GerhmanHerman
---
Can‚Äôt echo this enough. She wants to run a delivery quest to the middle of nowhere for a small amount of exp? Let her.
---
the pre raid 1 list has 9% hit for hunter?
---
I started playing with my wife on a private server a long time ago. She initially didn‚Äôt take anything seriously, but we got her playing hunter and she enjoyed it. It honestly worked best when she played by herself and just asked me what to do when she was lost. A new player needs to explore the world in their own way. The first time experiencing Azeroth is always an experience to remember
---
Retail is right over that way.
---
When they first released it for Halo 3 my friends and I must‚Äôve gone through over a hundred cases of that shit. Good memories.
---
Honestly, whenever they DO finally announce a date, I‚Äôd rather find out through one of these Office clips.
---
But why?
---
I'm looking for a doggo but I can't find one..
---
Ya I plan on taki g lots of the advice in the thread. Stand back, help when asked or see struggling with controls, support but don't instruct, talk about lore not stats...
---
Finally some Alliance pride!
---
Yeah thats one of the ones i've been considering. I figured mana tide totem would be pretty important though? The other spec i've been considering is the 0/30/21 heart of the wild build for druids so I can off-tank adds/certain bosses and also heal in raids just by switching some gear out. I've heard that build is pretty good for solo grinding and pvp too due to all the bonus attack power they get, and they have the 20% intellect boost for healing.
---
Blessed Beer of the Hops Seeker! Lol Perfect
---
The upright orcs also have 1) an entire unlock quest... and 2) completely different lore... and 3) completely different racials.
---
Also, they... uh... weren't part of classic so they... uh... won't be a part of classic.
---
Maybe if instead of splitting gold evenly at the end, they earmark more for the tanks and healers.
---
One extreme might be take total gold collected split into a tank and healer fund, then split the tank and healer fund evenly among those roles.
---
They're not going to implement a new shape of a new model with new art assets into a game that otherwise has *none* of that, after they've declared multiple times in blue posts and Blizzcon that they're going *way* out of their way to salvage and use exclusively existing art assets in Classic. Given that there's no chance whatsoever that the other character models would be upgraded without upgrading the art assets generally, and given that there's no way the art assets generally will be upgraded when Blizzard is, once again, purposefully *trying* to use only the old stuff and datamining their own old backups to figure out "the true art of the time", there's therefore no possible scenario in which they implement a special alternate character model with special alternate, sticks-out-like-a-sore-thumb new art assets, into an otherwise basic character creation screen in a game that doesn't even have the barbershop.
---
0% chance. Ever. It literally will not happen under any conceivable circumstance, so if that's the only thing that's going to get you to play Horde, you might as well roll a Night Elf instead.
---
Upright orcs dont have any unlock questline
---
Because the streamers will have hordes of noobs trying to follow them? Or because of their followers that their chosen faction will be an overwhelming zergfest?  
---
I wouldn't mind being on the opposing faction if I weren't outnumbered by a crazy amount.
---
Night elf hunter, because archers in WC3.
---
A slow 2h weapon is good for a hunter with a crossbow that's 3.2 or slower. Because you can run into melee and get a raptor strike off without clipping an auto attack. It requires a ton of try-harding and is situational but easily a 35-40dps increase.
---
I'm going plain old Engineering and Mining all the way to 60.
---
People will tell you that it doesn't make money but that's just not true at all - several quests need Engineering mats to complete and sell at a premium early in the servers life.
---
Plenty of Hunters will be buying up ammo, PvPers looking for grenades, and raiders buying up Flame Deflectors.  Engineers can sell quite a bit.
---
My last run with Engineering on a fresh pserver earned me 500g by the time I was 60.
---
If cash is really tight just do some extra mining.  Time spent Mining vs Herbing vs Skinning is all relative so why spread it out.
---
You also benefit from goggles early on, and the Green Lens which could give you more +shadow damage than any other preraid helm.
---
i'd go insane with those bare walls
---
buy some art dude
---
9fps? What a luxury !
---
I often think the same...
---
You have to see it this way. At first u think, u are the experienced one, s she should follow you. But u have to turn this around, she is experiencing and you will follow her into whatever she want's to do. In the beginning, stats shouldn't matter. If she asks, give her an answer. If she doesn't, then just be quiet. Sounds stupid but that's how i convinced one of my friends to play vanilla that never played wow before. I was like a pet, i follow and help him, but he is to experience the world.
---
Everyone should/will play as they like,
---
But for info, I'm fooling around on PS to figure out a nice lvling route 1-20 and the hamstring technique do A LOT!
---
On some mobs you can take as lush as 2x less dmg.
---
And also I find it quite fun to do, the leveling is really boring ( charge &gt; rend &gt; auto to death+HS) so hamstring adds some spice =]
---
F‚Äôs in the chat for Chris please
---
Mana tide is nice, but for early content shouldn't be necessary. 
---
I can't speak for druids - never played one, never done any research on them.
---
You can get to 60 without going out of your way.
---
I like to run some dungeons and check ah for gear if I have the gold to spare.
---
I actually don't have much recollection of the day itself but yeah....good observation haha.
---
MC them of the chain down into lava in blackrock mountain
---
I'm surprised how many people recognise the location from this sub!
---
Unless it's Chris Metzen
---
Ok, but where do I find this bar?
---
You can easily do /create world and everyone can /join world. This is how world chat were borm
---
I agree - Though I will say the one place where I think classic will show its age the most are the raids. They'll be fun but not because they're engaging mechanics or design wise.
---
Best value of any game i've ever bought. Easily.

Lmao, you're not wrong to an extent. I mean, it's a little extreme to assume that everyone around me dislikes me, but I get what you're saying. I just write how I think, and don't try to alter that. I'm overly articulate, to a fault sometimes, and some people tend to view that as me trying to have a veil of pseudo-intelligence. Am I a pretentious asshole? Probably, but atleast i acknowledge it.
---
I may be wrong but I seem to recall the first month being free with the game!
---
Alright, so I think warlocks are more inconvenient. Hunters level faster, are better in five man's, you are garanteed to want one in raids for MD, they can avoid content they don't want to do with FD, and they dont really fight for gear if you consider agility mail.
---
I think they are both great at soloing, hunters leveling faster with aspect of Cheetah, and they can avoid PvP with traps and FD and kiting.
---
I think BWL is when warlocks tend to really get going which I consider to be half way through content. After this warlocks get beefier in pvp and their dmg goes up. 
---
Hunters won't really be contenders for top dmg at any point except for certain fights, and warlocks won't be either until later on.
---
Honestly for anyone looking at this still considering what to play please understand that both classes have limitations. You need ammo as a hunter and to feed your pets, but you need soulshards as a warlock and you compete against the best class in the game (mages). 
---
PVP is similar, they both get pretty strong but both end up defending nodes and have to deal with warriors and rogues.
---
Servers with the giant streamers like asmongold or soda Poppin will be like 90% the faction they are playing
---
&gt;they will be prominent in Classic
---
Speak for yourself.
---
I will be playing on the german realms, and streamers are not a problem over here ;D
---
Also why?
---
I'll keep it preserved for generations haha.
---
Funnier to believe that it's true though. Just let yourself dream my friend, dream!
---
Had this http://classicdb.ch/?item=13164 on my druid, helped me clear the plants in DME a bit more reliably when I had low gear
---
Who isn't at this point? Haha
---
Yea was 512 in vanilla.  That's all I had in my scrub PC when I first played.  My first ever PC upgrade I performed was going from 512 to 1g  ram just so that Stormwind wasn't a slideshow for me.  My hard drive was much happier not to have to swap graphics on the fly, lol.
---
It sounds like you're referring to the Mag'har Orc allied race, which has the upright option.
---
Upright regular Orcs are just a customisation option at the barber.
---
Yeah most people have a gig worth of add-ons bloating their folder size xD. Mine is 6 gigs.
---
Yes, but the barbershop required to enable it won't be :)
---
Isn't blackface when you literally paint your face black?
---
&gt; unironically calling Aion and Albion good
---
Albion is strictly a worse Runescape. 
---
Lul
---
Dude..this sub is a microscopic % of the people that will play
---
ok, if you really want to call no changes - I will be with you, but then I want also be 14 again!
---
You can blame Chris when you're in rehab two years from now.
---
My mistake. Nothing to see here. Carry on...
---
I like turtles
---
I wrote a pretty large comparison in here already, so I'll just describe my large experience as a warlock. You do a lot of damage, the class identity is pretty unique. You have to deal with aggro, but if you can get past that and having to compete with mages you get to enjoy a class that has infinite mana, interesting mechanics, fun pets that you can kill off, great pvp viability, a cool mount, and once you get to play in AQ and Naxx you get to really see it come together.
---
Nice argument there. So basically it's not a druid weapon because elitist jerks say it's not and you believe them. 
---
On alliance I'll concede that it's more of a paladin weapon and maybe a human warrior, but on horde who is it better suited for?
---
Classic beta confirmed for next Friday then?
---
You would need to be feral and do research. You would need practice and a willing raid leader. Boomkins don't really make the cut.
---
Engineering is the go to for all classes, especially if you pvp.
---
I hear balance and a number of hybrid specs are quite good in pvp, especially as a flag runner.
---
Lol, I always forget the culture around streaming is way different across the pond. So many LoL streamers moved to NA to capitalize on the streaming and advertising market. Funny how that works.
---
Broke on cast with a slight delay

During the tour of the house I'd imagine this room being presented as "the pussy repeller".

I remember watching my roommate run down the Stair of Destiny when this expansion was first released. One of the most epic moments in gaming.
---
I've seen so many posts regarding gold farming. What is the most efficient? What professions are best? 
---
When you reach 60, and if you're trying to get prepped for PvE, you will have several factions that you need to be revered / exalted with. You're going to farm reputation so much reputation that in the end, you will have enough gold for your epic mount. Don't sweat it
---
Nice! Completely forgot that existed.
---
You just need to up the UI scale. There is a macro that can boost it even more then the settings allow if needed
---
The publish date is October 6th 2006 (this is the second addition of the guide, first one was released Nov 26th 2004) so you could assume it may actually be 1.12.1 since this patch was released on September 26th 2006.
---
Perfect for classic overall, even if it's based on 1.11 or 1.10 it is probably quote accurate. I have a physical copy of the 1st edition (2004) and the 2nd edition (2006). One could look at the changes happening in 1.12.0, 1.11.2, 1.11.1, etc, and see if the changes are noted in this book. Hopefully they were consisent to change everything in the 6 weeks between 1.12.1 release and the publish date, but if they had already printed the physical copies, it is likely it's based on like 1.11.x or god forbid something even earlier. Which makes it less useful for Classic.
---
If I have time I'll reply back if I can line it up to 1.12.1 or earlier.
---
PvE server wholesomeness.
---
IT WAS FAKE THE WHOLE TIME?!?!
---
/s
---
You kind of dont. Get to a point where you raid twice a week and dont really log in otherwise
---
How much did the storm rage and wind runner statues cost?
---
Please dont ever say "Warcraftian" again
---
OP was forgiven. He wasn't IP banned. He got to make another account. He got to play the game. 
---
In real life, people don't get to keep the fruits of their misconduct, no matter how much time has passed. OP botted his way into a raid. He got gear. He shouldn't get to keep the fruits of his misconduct in game either. No matter how much time has passed. 
---
And of course, you can talk about forgiveness. Forgiving OP is insignificant to you - it costs you nothing. It's just words and you get to feel smug. You weren't one of the people who, in good faith, passed on the Tier 1 chest to give to OP, not knowing he was a botter.
---
Adderall chased with coffee. But on a serious note I'm almost in the same situation. I guess looking forward the play style will be more "casual". You may find a guild that has better raid times to fit in with your free time.
---
&gt;My wife agreed to play with me on a private server tonight.
---
Please stop refering to your bed as "the private server".
---
the thing is, I really don't think i'll be committed enough to seriously raid naxx. I might be, but honestly at that point the community will only be a fraction of what it is in the first 6-8 months. And even then, hunters have the same benefits you mentioned minus the mount (which I don't find that cool anyways)
---
Exactly. But you can't predict peoples choices. I dont know which faction and which class I am going to play - might be a last minute thing as well.
---
Red walls and a horde tote. Yea he totally plays Alliance üôÑ own up to your retail playing horde bab
---
&gt;I was single and most certainly had no kids
---
See, changing that paradigm is where you made your first mistake.
---
My GF is playing for the first time ever also, just built her her first ever gaming PC. I think I'll power through to 60 and by the time she reaches STV I'll be able to protect her through that zone and speed her through one of the roughest patches.
---
Oh, we'd had our bloodbath alright earlier in the night, but as the final few minutes drew in, everybody unflagged and waited it out in peace. Well, mostly.
---
Mad respect for your videos, I really like watching them and they always help cheer me up when my mood is down.
---
Professors and interns are forced to do as many peer reviewing as possible on-top of their already extremely busy schedule between actual research tutoring and teaching. So you get a scenario where people are extremely low paid extremely tired and they are forced to participate so alot of garbage gets "passed". Then you have some retard journalists who know absolutely nothing reporting on something that clearly doesn't make sense. The entire process has been corrupted by greedy universities
---
Anyone whos ever worked in the last \~4 years in peer reviewing will tell you this is the case
---
Simple.
---
...it is therefore obvious that it can‚Äôt be before the 17th.
---
There are dozens of these posts a day. Stahhhppp
---
Enhance Shaman.  
---
Druids cannot benefit from "Chance on Hit" weapon effects while in an animal form.  It's just high DPS and some stats.  Probably better to have the mace from BWL?
---
They were a bit pricey, I think Blizz is selling them in there store for 350 a piece?
---
So you don't have a source and your only point of reference is the demo with a whole bunch of post-vanilla additions after several times I've asked you for sources they are keeping current UI changes in.
---
Talking out your ass. Got it.
---
Guess they changed it only slightly.
---
9% for preraid 1 but it's using Carapace Spine Crossbow, which shouldn't be available in p1.
---
8% for preraid 2, and they're using Bloodmail Boots for some reason even though there's Windreaver Greaves that give 2x the agility and still give 1% hit.
---
10% for p2 MC BiS, and that's *with* Accuria, an item that you won't get until months after BWL is out, and at that point you'd have better options.
---
9% for p3 BWL BiS, but that's with DFT, and the odds of you getting DFT are even slimmer than those of getting Accuria.
---
You're way better off going to class-specific resources if you want decent lists.
---
You don‚Äôt, change your expectations.
---
Good times.
---
I said it literally has never happened to me, so no, it has never happened to me and I played from release through Wrath without a break.
---
I'm glad bud :) when Classic comes out the Derp Crew and I are going to stream for as long as we can! Maybe we'll see you in Azeroth!
---
It was a custom ui that I priced together myself pretty sure I uploaded it as kib UI or something lol
---
Jesus H Fuck not this shit again. It should be bannable at this point.
---
Why 400g?
---
1. Weapon DPS does not increase damage in feral form. Feral weapon dps is static and only increases based on attack power
---
2. Chance on hit effects do not proc in feral form
---
3. The only benefit Sulfuras gives to a druid is the 5 fire damage reflection
---
4. It's the best weapon in the game for warriors, paladins, and shamans that is incredibly difficult and expensive to obtain and giving it to a druid who can only use it to auto attack in caster form is an incredibly poor argument for it being a druid weapon and would cause a mutiny in a guild
---
I totally Agree with you ! I told that to him but he was like: Oh Runescape is the same sht as WoW, look those graphics, are terrible, I cannot believe how people still play that game." And I'm like dude wtf is one of the best MMORPG of all time, Albion is just a cheap copy of it... But he negates it with all he has.
---
It may also have something to do with the fact that people over here, who enjoy games...well...play them, instead of watching someone else playing.
---
It is! Been doing it for about a decade. Through college and all. I usually play on the middle one. It's 3440 x 1440 100hz. Perfect for MMOs!
---
From what ive learned, by no means an expert, is that theyre mostly viable as healers. Theres spots for them in raids but theyre not the most favourite pick when it comes to healers.
---
Whats more is that boomkin is useless because theyre always out of mana.
---
Tanking as feral is viable in 5 mans or as an off tank in raids but never as a main tank (thats warriors), also in pvp feral is mmmokay but youll be better off playing a rogue if you want to play pvp as feral.
---
Anyone correct me if im wrong, cus ive never played vanilla, just very excited for it :)
---
I live in EU so sadly we won't regardless, keep being awesome. Your videos with the derp crew is so entertaining.
---
Kargoz has a good guide on lvling priest ! 
---
My plan is: wand spec/spirit tap -&gt; disc -&gt; at 40 go shadow -&gt; around 50+ consider rerolling disc to heal up to 60, depending on what I feel like doing. Brd and Stratholme is gear heaven for us, so I‚Äôm thinking about starting doing those as early and much as possible. 
---
Yes you can farm easily if you plan good. Dire Maul East is easily farmable, there are several guides on all of this on youtube :-)
---
Why is everyone so opposed Office memes? Would you rather have the same for questions being posted?
---
Even then, hunters start bouncing back a little once you hit absurd amounts of agility with naxx gear and the survival talent.
---
Why tho? This sub has been dried up off anything interesting outside the blue posts for several weeks now. Just gotta take what you get now
---
Checked ‚Äûmy‚Äú server, 8 ppl registered :(  This was my last hope.
---
I immediately discount anybody's opinion on a game if they value the graphics above everything else. I don't play MMOs because they look pretty, it's often just a nice bonus.
---
And Runescape is nothing like WoW, they're entirely different games with entirely different design philosophies. The only thing they have in common is that they were both extremely popular at the same time. The only thing they have in common is that they were extremely popular in the same time period.
---
Oomkin benefits from the proc so the can switch to this when they're out of mana and still do some damage.
---
You make it too difficult for yourself. Both classes are good at their jobs and fun to play! Every class has it‚Äôs pro‚Äôs and cons. Test them out and see which one is more fun to play. Even if you don‚Äôt like one of the 2 classes you can make a new one :)
---
Gotta rack up your G.B.P (Good Boy Points) cleaning, helping out with the kids more than usual, conveniently getting Starbucks for the wife, maybe a new console for the kids?
---
Oh maybe. I remember my friend buying me the game for my birthday when I was a kid but not being able to play because of no game time
---
Even though I'd like my girlfriend played games, this is something I want to keep to myself. I cannot share the same feelings and nostalgia with her, the same way I can with my other friends. Vanilla is too important to me lol
---
Okay good bye
---
Use the sticky thread for "What class should I use?" questions.
---
This is epic :)
---
Those vertical Monitors make me rage inside to the max.
---
I very much doubt the balance will be off more than 10% in either direction. In my opinion, imbalance on vanilla servers was caused over time and because there were very few, albeit massive guilds that often attracted whole countries, in EU's case at least. There weren't that many people able to and willing to lead these guilds so they were rare and if the opposing faction was missing counterweight then they were doomed. Many private servers actually claim very close to 50:50 balance in population and I see no reason why this isn't going to be the case on official servers as well.
---
Really, the biggest feature of vanilla is the community.
---
He told me that he tried out WoW Cataclysm in private servers, he told me  it was sht. I said that it was a private server and it was just a little experience of what WoW really is.  
---
So he bought the 20 bucks WoW with the 30 days trial. I told him to buy Legion as well because all the people and the latest content that it is being playing by everyone is here and not Draenor. He refuses to buy it and keep complaining why Draenor was so empty. He used to say that PvP was sht and it was no content to do. 
---
I was like dude come on, probably is the game with more content in the history of MMO's...  
---
He prefers Aura Kingdom and all anime based things, if it has not lolies, the thing is sht for him.
---
Hahaha, I'll try that.
---
I already know that I like playing both up to about 50+ in vanilla, didn't go further before TBC however. Both classes are fun to level up and play in general.
---
Right now however I'm trying to figure out what I want to main first. Guess I could make the other as an alt down the road.
---
Damn man, thats sweet! But well deserved if you‚Äôve been working for it for soo many years. Oh shit thats super wide tho, must be great for racing too !
---
Druids and ele shams scale so well in pvp with gear. 
---
I didn't raid much but the other guy got it right.
---
No doubts about it.
---
That's like saying you want every max level to have to go through MC-Argus just to get to current tier, as fun as that might sound in dairy tale land it would kill the game
---
I suspect that's exactly what they're going to do, but for those who want to progress further there will be Classic Burning Crusade, which will also be frozen in time.
---
You are right, the problem is that everytime I play with my friends WoW and he is in Discord with us, he criticize with none arguments that WoW is garbage...
---
Or another this is what I'm playing wow on post. Cool you have a computer
---
At this point I just want to unsub until its released. Sub is garbage
---
Exactly. I thought every "chance on hit" effect didn't work in forms
---
So instead of frostweave cloth you just have to use rune cloth and hope a raid boss drops the all powerful frostboulder so you can combine them into a robe?
---
Sounds the exact same to me
---
Fuckin aye right.  Play video games when your life allows for it.
---
So enhance shaman is okay but oomkin isn't?
---
What's your argument?
---
Vanillas wording is funny like that. It isn't an item with a "chance on hit" proc, it's a consumable that applies a buff to you.
---
Go away please. Thanks in advance!
---
The big streamers will likely congregate to 2 servers (pve and Pvp) anyways. I know sodapoppin wanted to play a Pvp server and so did Asmon, but Asmon said he'll likely play on a pve server cause he doesn't think it'll be possible to play a Pvp server with a big audience.
---
Almost no tier gear is worth using until tier 3. All healers fight for basically the same gear for shaman/paladin and druids tier 1-2,5 is a pvp set
---
|What can hunters do better than mages? My thoughts about the class...
---
*pet tanking, or constant poking to annoy casters, is neat
---
*feign death dropping aggro has always been fantastic
---
*arguably THE best wpvp gankers, hard countering rogues and easily getting the drop on everyone else from 42 yards away, nearly impossible to flee from
---
*freezing trap and frost trap are pretty good but not amazing cc's
---
*viper sting drains mana from healers and casters, very useful
---
*doesn't scale super well with gear, making them less gear dependant solely because others and the whole raid benefit more from others getting the drops first
---
*becomes a low utility, low dps class by AQ-Naxx?
---
*still fantastic gold farmers, soloers and for all PvP
---
*requires a dedicated bag for ammo
---
|What can mages do better than hunters? My thoughts about the class...
---
*fantastic convenience and utility with free food, free drinks, teleports, portals, int buff, slow fall, and some of the best CC in the game with frost nova and polymorph
---
*ice block and cold snap and ice block lol
---
*always strong in pve dps, very easy soloing and gold farming in aoe
---
*various powerful pvp builds to play with including 3-minute-mage(pom-pyro), deep frost, elemental
---
*vastly overplayed class, awfully ugly raid tiers, compete gear with all casters and healers which is half the raid?
---
*no idea how gear dependant they are, if a lot then having so much competition for drops makes it hard to gear up?
---
|Both seem like excellent options for playing a ton of hours every day, also solo (like when everyone else is working or sleeping).
---
But which one is the best option if I don't want alts, I want to play a ton, I want to gain far more gold than I need (even if I spend a lot of it on enchanting/engineering down the line), and I want to get invited for all the content including obtaining tier 3 pieces?
---
Agreed !
---
42 yards is 38.4 meters
---
If you insist on DPSing as a druid, feral is superior to balance. Engineering is the way to go, especially since you seem to consider PvPing - it's just the quintessential PvP profession.
---
Druid is the king of wPvP in my opinion, you win a lot of matchups, and the ones you struggle with, you can avoid or run away from. It's extremely hard to kill a well played druid in the open world. BGs are fun, in Warsong, you're the best flag carrier available, in AB, you are quite capable of defending bases well. 
---
All of that being said: if you insist on not healing at all in PvP, you're crippling yourself.
---
very true! i know my main and a few alts will be horde, torn on whether to have some of the other alts be ally tho or go full horde
---
I loled
---
Its not the best weapon for anyone. I'm not saying it's specifically a druid weapon. I'm saying it's not specifically an any class weapon and therefore druids have just as much claim on it as any other 2 handed mace user. 
---
Also no-one except maybe ret pallies, if anyone brings on, are going to be using it in raids, so it's a fun off spec item for anyone who can use it.
---
I feel this. However I'm sharing my life with this lady. I wanna share my favorite game too!
---
Druids scale very well. If the priests arent sniping raid healing with flash heals (which they shouldn't be cause it's super inefficient), druids are the best "aoe" heals on alliance. For horde, HT is more efficient than priest or shaman for tank healing (shamans pick up most of the raid healing with chain heal). There are also multiple specs depending on what your raid needs you to do.
---
I mean, that's a possibility. If I were to hazard a guess, it would be that Europe as a whole is far more diverse. This leads to a lot of marketing barriers, whether they be cultural, product aavailability different regions, or simply not speaking the same language (I know a lot of people from Europe speak English alongside their native language, so I don't really know how much of a factor that is). NA is far more homogeneous, which means that the region is far more profitable from a marketing perspective. Plus, let's be real, Americans seem to be far more susceptible to marketing tactics, alongside our extremely consumer driven market. I totally get what you're saying though, because I really don't understand the mindset behind watching someone else play a game all day.
---
Where is this? I want to make this bar my home.
---
I mean.... not even being an elitist jerk... I would never give that weapon to a Druid.  They literally benefit nothing from weapons besides the stats on them.  The on hit will never be used and the weapon damage will never be used.
---
I had an average pc for the time (p4, 512mb ram, 128mb graphics card) and wow barely ran in cities.
---
The upgrade to 1gb ram about March 2005 really helped.
---
No, you're incorrect and arguing in bad faith. Please leave my thread where I am trying to catalog reflect damage gear. Thank you!
---
Wacraftian meet me in stv arena noob
---
And I'll probably get hate for this but a lot of Asmon's and Soda's viewers are morons, if their chat is any indication. 
---
And I say this as a viewer of both. I'd prefer to steer clear of that crowd.
---
If that would have been from gamestop all you would have had is a blank white paper.
---
i thought druids are quite good but i read their hots dont stack, so other healers &gt; more/to many druids
---
I don't view botting as minor, clearly you do and I think that's the disconnect.
---
The thing with prisons vs account bannings is this guy can just buy a new account and still play. You can't just buy those years you lose in prison again. For the record I am 100% pro rehabilitation and the fact that felons can no longer vote after serving their time disgusts me. I'm not sure why you keep bringing prisons up, losing access to your pixels, while a loss of attachment, is extremely different than being locked up and losing your rights.
---
Idk about yours, but I play on Netherwing and they had to employ perks for the alliance for a short while to restore faction balance.
---
I didn't know the weeb meaning but when I google it I laugh so hard. He is literally like that. Anime things are superior than anything else for him. Bet you 1 million that if WoW has been an Anime-based game he currently would be in like Maiev is for Illidan lol.
---
You are being an elitist jerk. Oomkin is a thing in battlegrounds and this is one of if not the best oomkin backup weapon to switch to when you're oom.
---
I was there. And boy was it laggy! So beautiful, too.
---
Unrealistic as this player would never make it to 54 haha
---
Yep. We just scheduled a weeklong family vacation in July, so it'll probably come out a day or two before then.
---
I would always start an xpac a week late. Gave me a nice week off from the game, and when I started the servers were stable and the starting areas were empty :D
---
Dude please stop lol this is just dumb.  This has nothing to do with min maxing,  that is just straight up stupid.
---
Did someone say hazy IPA?
---
I smell a lvl 30 battle back and forth between TM and SS.
---
Priests were always jealous of Druid heals during vanilla
---
That was so funny I spit out cock.
---
Dude is delusional.  I understand not min maxing for fun but Christ...
---
We tried that 2, is a sh\*itty linear RPG with better graphics, no more to offer..  
---
Of course is better BFA than that, and Vanilla... just don't put Aion and Vanilla in the same sentence please, Aion is not worth at all, just a F2P game in the steam library...
---
Thanks for replying ! Hope to see you in Classic, can't wait !

Issue is, if a big streamer is driving the population of a server and they quit, the server will likely die.
---
All downhill from there
---

---
Wow epic
---
man I love that 19th picture so so much. Looks so fucking cool, something about the shaman totems being in there buffing the small room and helping hold down the fort from an army
---
I like this pic more than i should
---
Nice name
---
Play them both, stick with the class you have more fun playing.
---
The quests would have a lot less meaning and reward in BC zones
---
I'm not defending the botting. He got banned and rightly so. From what OP has said the character that he botted with wasn't the character he wanted back. Now of course it's the same account. I think everyone's been selfless only to have it taken for granite. You, me, and everyone has had their good will taken advantage of. The character itself only has value to the owner, it's useless outside of nostalgia. There are no fruits to profit off of. It's worthless. The only reason to keep him from having it is out of spite. It's purely sentimental. No one is hurt and someone is helped by letting OP get his childhood characte back. I don't see a reason why what Blizzard has done is wrong.
---
Does answer also have a member named object?
---
Honestly, you're probably right. I'm probably just overinflating a relatively minor issue. I saw Asmon in one clip talking about playing PvP until it becomes unplayable for him. I'm just curious to see if it will result in over the top griefing he can't overcome or having an army following him everywhere protecting him.
---
Oh god, that latency.
---
Rotations are easy :)
---
Micromanagement becomes normal after some time, you just stop to think about it
---
Mages do more damage later on and are more needed in raids
---
You are right, but also WoW will be WoW again.  
---
Horde vs Alliance, General chat in every level zone will be used, the real World PvP, not just endgame content...  
---
I'm really excited to see that world again.
---
Nice to see creed as the focus of this one, he‚Äôs my favorite character in the office by far üòÇ
---
I hope/wish Kaivax sees this. This is gold!
---

---
Dude this has nothing with being an elitist jerk.  I‚Äôm planning on playing a shadow priest for Christ sake.  But if you‚Äôre giving this item to a boomkin on the off chance he needs to melee when he goes oom, you are a fucking moron.
---

Only at that time people were not viewing it as the final few seconds of vanilla. They were eagerly counting down to burning Crusade and more content.
---
When I was buying my elecom i was thinking about kensigton trackball also but the positioning of buttons seemed unnatural.
---
I'd like to imagine there are just constant wars surrounding the location of a big streamer lol
---
Find out what your guild needs
---
Typical Horde player.  Swung first.
---
both
---
I think you‚Äôd like hunter more going off of your pros and cons list. Playing a character that fits your aesthetic needs would be more rewarding 2 years down the line, you have plenty of time getting used to the rotation, and you would get the gear you want easier. Seems like less stress, which means more fun but hey that‚Äôs my 2 cents!
---
I mean, I even liked Aion for the... month or two I played it. Flying combat was a cool niche at the time. But it's just nothing close to Vanilla.
---
As for seeing me, well... We'll need to be on the same server, eh? But it's possible.
---
I spent so much time in AV....and I‚Äôm going to do it all over again. Easily my most favorite BG.
---
A lot of us built our own PCs back then and I used it with a 16:9 720p display that was 30" so speak for yourself. üòò

---
The sticky thread can help you with choosing.

&gt;in pvp feral is mmmokay but youll be better off playing a rogue if you want to play pvp as feral.
---
You won't be going around in cat form all the time in PvP. You will be shape-shifting a lot to take advantage of the abilities &amp; attributes of each form. Druids are more like a Swiss army knife, you get the most benefit from using the complete range of tools and not relying one one thing all the time.
---
I sent you a DM
---
Maybe because it's TBC and this guy is speaking vanilla.
---
Spyglass! Forgot about that item!

Everytime I saw this happening I would specifically get a group together to steam roll the people trying to do that in AV.

ask the other wow players what they think about that attitude, maybe they don't mind. However if they do mind and find it unbearable (and I mean to a degree they literally can't stand) there's two things I would do, one is making a new discord without him, other choice would be being direct -- hey dude we are making a voice channel called "no trashtalking wow" if you trashtalk wow in it, you're kicked/timed out.-- I know the second choice might sound a bit immature, but hey he's being unbearable and childish, compared to that being a little immature isn't that bad.

I see your virginity is protected and safe. We must stay together during these trying times.
---
You sure sound excited. Then you probably (later that day) realize that the gear design in TBC would remove every single reason to play classic. Then you will say that this can be "fixed". Questions and debates will heat up since that is tremendous amount of work and balancing to make sure that no content is left behind (remember what happened when ToC/IC dungeons came?)and eventually this thread will succumb as all the others.
---
Private servers kept the interest for over 10 years by simply introducing fresh servers, blizz can do  the same.
---
If the success is big enough so the community wont be split to the point of self destruction, then maybe you will get TBC servers. Until then wait for Classic. There is no reason for Franke-game-patch.

Frankly, you should stop talking to this guy. Not only is he apparently stupid and extremely judgmental, he's also an emerging lolicon. He sounds like a full-time garbageman. I don't even know why you're wasting your time.
---
Why not just... EPGP? Works pretty well IMHO. As for how to do loot with pugs present in the raid, an old guild I was in that used the system would just /roll an item, if a pug won, they got it, if any guild member won (or no pug player rolled for it), it was distributed via EPGP as normal.
---
If it's a full pug run, why not GDKP? People just outright bid on the items, highest bid gets the item and the gold goes into a pot. The pot is distributed evenly at the end of the run to all attendees.
---
I'm actually in the exact same position and just made a post about this:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bnhiro/hunter\_vs\_mage\_help\_me\_choose/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bnhiro/hunter_vs_mage_help_me_choose/)

15 years ago cashiers could still do math. Sometimes people will just hit cash button if they know they can make change, so if he paid  ¬£33, the cashier knew he only needed 1p back. If he was quaffing int pots all day, he might have been able to manage change for  ¬£35.

---
It doesn't matter if they're better or not. Every raid is going to want several resto druids due to their toolkit. Just as any other healer class. Both ferals and balance druids had very handy final talent aura that boosted spell and melee/ranged crit respectively and having at least one of each was not a waste of space. Whatever damage you could not do yourself, could offset by the extra damage caused by your party.
---
And anything goes in PvP, they are real menace in any spec due to their unparalleled mobility.

So much fun and excitement. Probably won't be the same this time around but I can't wait for the gates of AQ to open up again when the whole server is there.

I wouldn't say that personally, late Wrath when they introduced dungeon finder is when i noticed things started getting a bit shit.
---
I was thinking a way they could do it, was test different zones every 2 weeks or something, kinda like people testing the shit out of the Barrens after Blizzcon, instead of people just rushing tru it
---
It probably depends what they plan to test for, how good that idea is tho
---
One could argue it started going downhill when cross realm bgs were introduced.
---
I was mid-30s the first time around and I found a guild of older people who raided earlier and called it a night at reasonable times. I think there will be A LOT more guilds like that this time around.
---
This was the driving force that made me write this post, actually. It would be fun to watch a server with that level of world PvP. I'd definitely have a world pvp alt on a server like that.
---
Black voice?  What is black voice?  Are you the same person who would tell a black person they are speaking ‚Äútoo white‚Äù?
---
Going to be maining a tauren enhancement shaman, fite me
---
Yea let her slowroll it for max enjoying
---
Being able to take my time this time around. I felt like the inevitable TBC expansion mad everyone feel like they were on a deadline. Hopefully the phases are stretched a little longer and we‚Äôre not feeling rushed through the experience.
---
Just walk backwards

Upvoted for being a ret paladin in vanilla!
---
Awesome that you are excited. Don't expect any specific server structure untill Blizzard has come out with their official info. The odds of Mega servers happening is fairly small I would say.
---
And everyone needs to realize that they‚Äôll more than likely have to enter the raid late or leave early.
---
I‚Äôve already told my guild mates that I will not be present at the beginning of the raid, so I will be on the bench until they don‚Äôt have enough or someone leaves.
---
What a fun night. My best friend and I waited in line for an hour at GameStop here in L.A. for the midnight release then raced home, downloaded the game and waited at the portal. I haven‚Äôt experienced such excitement for a game since.
---
i can see them downvotes coming but i'm honest with you guys. 
---
a horde/alliance flag, wall painted in that color, an azeroth map on your wall?
---
i mean, come on... we're not kids in 2005 anymore...
---
sorry if someone feels attacked, it's just my opinion.
---
if your hardware runs it and you are enjoying the game, why do you need to decorate your home like you never grew up ...
---
What does movementg√ºnther mean? I've seen some ppl say it in RBG chat when flaming others.
---
Bfa and classic are two completely different games. I would wait untill Classic releases.
---
Maybe he is still working at the Game shop, apparently it is still open after all these years.
---
yes a build with good leveling and world pvp does exist! dont listen to these combat spec noobs, ive lvld a lot of rogues and found this to be the best. once you reach lvl 30 you respec out of combat in favor of the sub tree for hemo https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fZhhVbbVzLbZxMe0MhRo and after getting hemo you want a point in prep, and 2/2 dirty deeds is optional but i like it, then go to combat for the +hit talent. dont try this build before 30 though, its legit the slowest lvling spec in the game before 30, dont. do. it. 
---
use whichever mainhand has the highest top end dmg, ignore stats! you can use a mace or a sword, whichever has more dmg (usually this means slower) and for offhand use a mace/sword that has the fastest attack speed.
---
I did! He‚Äôs definitely up there too. I worry he‚Äôs going to die of paper poisoning soon if we don‚Äôt get a release date.
---
I agree with most things said on this thread that are about letting her explore and lead you. The only caveat I would say is show her how to use the mouse to move. It's only weird for a little bit and is much easier to learn from the beginning then getting used to asdf and trying to switch from there.
---
I remember turning around and being amazed at how huge the portal was on the outlands side!
---
yeah that's a setup. no puberty flags and walls painted in that color, nor an azeroth map. well done.
---
I'd be so sad
---
I just hope it releases before the beginning of fall semester in early August, that's all I want. I want at least a week to grind before I have to change focus to school.
---
"Chance on hit" weapon enchants don't activate for druids because they aren't actually using their weapons while shapeshifted. Chance on hit procs for enemy attacks aren't affected.
---
Omfg this was great. These gifs are keeping me laughing right through my flu like symptoms and stupid mundane work life . . . God why do I choose to have responsibilities? Keep up the good work my man!!!

RP-PvP is the only server I have interest in playing. To get true immersion in this world the threat of being attacked by the enemy at any moment in the open world should and needs to be there.

I plan on rolling a Druid for classic. From what I‚Äôve read, they can do all 3 roles if the player is good but healing they excel at and can compete with any class.
---
In terms of numbers, they tend to get worse as time goes on. In MC and BWL you can get away with R3 Healing Touch spam (for the casting time) and stay reasonably competitive. However, as the other healing classes regen gets better with gear and uprank, youll be stuck with either low rank or upranking to slower heals.
---
I actually record videos for youtube (and use a facecam) so I wouldnt want to put that curse on my audience. Ill let them see the classics, and ill stare at the bullshit lol
---
Man I thought I recognised that fuckin' hat before I saw your name.
---
There was a tweet by the creator of the site linked by OP which suggested the Classic client is now based on an 8.x build--it's quite possible that there is a common core which both clients are based on at this point. It would make sense for adapting both to combat any exploits simultaneously.
---
I was only able to fit 4 on that side of the wall, the other 4 posters are on the opposite side

I'll never forget the feeling of walking through, hearing that crescendo, and seeing that giant-ass level ?? Pit Lord front and center.
---
Are you fucking high? No.
---
Not only would this be way too much work for Blizzard to remake everything, but most people would not want to play such a stitched together abomination of a game.
---
Most people want to play Classic because they liked Vanilla, and they want to play the game essentially how it was back then. Same for fans of TBC.
---
If they release TBC content at all, they should make separate TBC servers after the six Classic phases, and offer character transfers.
---
That last line kinda cancels out the hunter doesn't it
---
They won't be HoT'ing other raiders anyway, especially for horde where Chain Heal reigns supreme.
---
HoTs are for the tanks, or other raiders you *know* are going to be taking consistent damage for the duration of a Rejuvenation. Anything else is a potential waste of mana, especially for Horde where CH will seek out the lowest health in range for the shaman.
---
They have limited usefulness, but druid is also the least played class (and a feral is useful for the buff as well) so it evens out.
---
Thank you so much!
---
Start classic. Pick a class. Whatever peeks your interest the most and go with it.
---
She'll either like it or won't. Don't force it. My wife started playing with me. She's not a traditional gamer by any means. It took her til lvl 10 just to get to grips with the movement and camera controls. She's enjoying it but can only handle like an hour or 2 a day. I dunno if she'll stick long but I agree to play with her at every opportunity and teach her mechanics as they come up. Don't overwhelm her with every detail unless she asks about it. I think this is the only way to build an interest in this activity. Oh and a /follow macro is great when showing her where to go.

Fuckin sick
---
That's actually the only reason why im playing Classic WoW. I hope to get my virginity back lol
---
Little did we know our game would slowly be ripped away from us
---
UD is easily the best PVP race with any class.
---
It's basically a trophy for any one who gets it. You claiming that any class deserves it more than any other class when they all have better options makes you a moron.
---
The glorious days
---
That was really nice. Gonna be an awesome place to adventure from :)
---
I have screen shots of the field of corpses my guild created killing all the Alliance
---
It‚Äôs all about getting a schedule going. Leveling is going to be the worst, but if you start day one and don‚Äôt plan on being server first, you have about 3 months to level. Realistically, you won‚Äôt be able to field 40 competent/geared raiders for the first 3 months of release (unless you are going for server firsts).
---
Then you need to give your family a heads up. If your guild raids twice a week, try to work it out with your family that you‚Äôll be raiding one or both of those days. Your SO should respect that this is a hobby that you love, but you can‚Äôt disrespect your family and invest your life into the game. I‚Äôve already told my wife that I‚Äôll probably be raiding on Fridays, so I will be waking up early on Sundays (she now gets Saturdays) to watch the kids.
---
Additionally, get ready to ride the bench! I will be rolling a healer, so I‚Äôll have reduced bench time due to them probably reserving my spot. However, you‚Äôll probably be riding the bench if you can‚Äôt show up for all the raids and can‚Äôt stay on till 1 AM. The bench isn‚Äôt bad, just make sure to bring tons of consumables and make yourself look good enough to the point where they may reserve that last spot for you in the raids. Once again, fielding 40 competent raiders is close to impossible....
---
Finally, join a guild that has multiple parents. We‚Äôre creating a guild and every single one of the officers has kids and a career. We‚Äôre going to be a moderate raiding guild that will attempt to raid 1-2 times a week. We‚Äôre not looking at getting server firsts, but will be attempting to be in the top 5-10. By just being organized you‚Äôd be surprised how much you can get accomplished in Classic by being slow and steady. Hardcore guilds have problems of drama and too many try-hards, so naturally they disband and reform frequently. You‚Äôd be surprised how many guilds were near the top of their server in Vanilla only raiding once or twice a week and trying to just have a fun time.
---
Do hunters not get invited to Naxx?
---
You mean august 27th, on a tuesday :(
---
little did we know we'd repeatedly confuse 'burnout' with 'muh game changes'
---
Honestly, I see like a 25/75 split this time with more guilds being casual - hardcore.
---
I‚Äôm content doing one raid a week and minor content thought out the week.
---
Oh man...wait until the next episode. We'll see if you still like me haha
---
Glad you've been enjoying the show though, it was a hell of a blast to be able to participate in!
---
Maybe they're going to pull a move from Respawn's Apex Legends playbook when they just randomly dropped the game.
---
There‚Äôs hardly any Alliance warlocks. And Orc‚Äôs resisting the odd stun does not make an entire faction dominant in world pvp.
---
Prbly more for the level grind they're about to jump into.
---
You don‚Äôt know that you‚Äôre playing a TBC server?
---
Christ, the three worst expansions and a Sylvannas doll. You‚Äôre not worthy.
---
Find a guild that raids on your days off or fits your schedule otherwise. Sure, you won't be able to play as much as you used to, but I'm sure you can find a way to cope.
---
Also...three kids and a wife? Sounds like a full party! Start the brainwashing now, and maybe they will all be on board to play with you by the time Classic releases ;)
---
Literally, yes, but the term also refers more broadly to the minstrel shows that used white actors in black face makeup. Those shows drew upon a variety of black stereotypes, like speaking in broken English and being obsessed with watermelon (I think the chicken stereotype came later but could be wrong)
---
Oh it was at its most balanced over *two expansions?* Thanks for narrowing it down.
---
nope
---
Having more content on retail means a much more manageable launch for Classic. Think about it, they‚Äôre implanting sharding because they might *have to*, not necessarily because they want to. They fear a huge chunk of ‚Äútourists‚Äù will flood the game and the server populations will be unstabalized.
---
One way to help this is release it near to a retail patch. The hardcore fans and curious visitors will be flocking to Classic WoW, but 80% of retail players will be occupied with the retail game.
---
Contrast that to releasing Classic in the biggest content drought, having tons of people try it out on day one, and when they get to Stormwind or Westfall, it‚Äôs a monstrously worse experience.
---
Shoving the entire EU on to a single server with a concurrency of 2500 people sounds like horrible time.
---
I've always been a warrior main, hunter alt kinda guy. You can get a lot of resources that way and it's fun.
---
Well I know they bring utility to raids but in the sense of this question I just wanted to know how well they scaled in comparison to Shamans.
---
thats great ^^
---
It's ironic that you're calling him out for vague platitudes when that's all you've given in this thread. 
---
You claimed elsewhere that the game was most balanced during TBC and WotLK. Defend that. What is your argument? What do you say to someone who points out that the balancing changed a few dozen times over that time period?
---
Idiots in glass houses shouldn't start running into walls.
---
I will solve this problem by running PUG groups and reserving the bindings or doing GDKP runs and buying the bindings. I will have that damn Thunderfury on my rogue one way or another.
---
Yo is that a bed for your feet?! Where did you get that my feet get so cold
---
I like IPAs and all, but ya gotta diversify.
---
That's not going to stop you from getting fat unless you control your diet.
---
Warrior AoE threat on large packs is not all that much better than Druid threat. Both classes end up spamming Demo Roar / Demo Shout. Warriors passively reflect damage with their shield which puts put them ahead, but not by much.
---
Druid is clearly superior on up to 6 targets IMO. Tab + Swipe does a lot of threat, and with Swipe crits refunding Rage, you will have enough rage to use Maul as well.
---
Healing touch healed more than greater heal.  Rejuvenate healed more than renew.
---
A child did something dumb. 
---
That's what children do. They do dumb shit. 
---
This particular child didn't even hurt anyone with his dumb shit. He was just s clueless child.
---
Said child is now an adult, and can make adult choices, and will be acting like an adult in-game because that's what *adults* so.
---
I get where you're coming from, but it's unreasonable to hold something innocent someone's done as a child against them. They didn't know better. They were biologically incapable of knowing better.
---
I'm all in for &lt;BOBODDY&gt;
---
No you don‚Äôt understand. I will spend hours ganking the same spots, again and again and again and again, hours. I know all of the juicy places, all of the quests that are long and hard to do, finding a group, etc. It would be a shame if the escort would die just before the end. I will haunt them, destroy them during hours everyday. I‚Äôm going for the max dishonorable kill it‚Äôs going to be so fun!!!!!
---
An orc comes out of the gates and says, "go back, we fucked up".
---
Or maybe they just posted it at 5:19 pm?
---
Funny way to answer a question
---
I think they may want to release Classic near to a BFA expac. Blizz stated that a concern is the ‚Äútourist‚Äù wave destabilizing servers and their long term populations. What better way to handle that wave than doing the Classic release nearer to a time when the tourist wave will be spread out, rather than compressed.
---
I think lots of retail players will try out Classic, but not necessarily on day one. It‚Äôs more likely it will trickle in some players when the content *does* inevitably reach a drought. This will provide a trickle of newcomers *after* the sloppy Zerg of a launch, which would be a first impression that might make a lasting impact on potential players of Classic.
---
Shut the fuck up
---
I think Blizzard could easily auto-recommend you to servers to 50/50 them. Like, have an option to select horde or alli, and if you don‚Äôt care which specific one, it suggests an appropriate PVP server that‚Äôs maybe 45/55, in an attempt to even it out.
---
Not as a forced feature, but it could help out the issue.
---
Taking a week vacation time to binge WoW at all waking hours with periodic sleep in between. I usually do so for every WoW expac so I'm a seasoned veteran at doing so XD
---
Yes I have no life, fuck you.
---
My wife, who was my girlfriend at the time got me to play wow in lay 2006, and as a general rule of thumb, I‚Äôd say be her support. The common trope is that the gf is the healer, but I‚Äôd say if you‚Äôre her healer (or just a support player in general for her) it can be a lot of fun. I love being able heal her mage on my paladin and do group quests as a duo. In general empowering her and letting her learn to love the game like you do is what I‚Äôve enjoyed most playing with my wife.
---
You can use bombs at the start of a pull. Sapper charges as well. Given the cooldowns on those items, I don't think engineering should play a factor in Druid vs. Warrior. It's still useful for Druids.
---
Hopefully most big streamers are alliance. It adds to it when I'm slaying legitimate scumbags and losers behind their ugly toon. I suggest if so everyone also attempts to join their servers as opposing factions to help balance it out and make these freaks have a hard time.
---
Ohh take me back
---
My cat would rip that banner to shreds within the week. Too low to the ground, too tempting.

If not 40 million
---
Hi, Priest (holy/Disc/shadow) or Shaman (resto/ele) for PVE &amp; PVP in term of FUN ? Ok, Priests have mind control, that's a plus, but I would love to read your arguments.
---
Even if it is highly subjective it will still help me choose my main for classic wow.
---
If they had only knew what they were leaving behind.
---
I'm not 100% sure since it's been like 5 years.  
---
But I'm pretty sure there's lockboxes in desolace. In the northwest. Out in the water.
---
Can't wait to do this again! TBC is gonna be amazing
---
Two posts below yours I posted a link to something someone made called the World of Warcraft Classic Compendium. It's specifically designed for new players.
---
They likely pick a certain number of people from certain pools that could be based on things like if your sub is current or not and a range of specs. To get a variety in the sample size.
---
This was how my first (and last) 3 day nonstop marathon of no-sleep wow playing began. Slept all day, picked up several cases of Monsters, went and collected my copy of the game, logged in and joined the festivities at the gate and didn't log out again until I was 70. At which point I passed out for 18 hours and woke to find I now had nothing to do but wait because there were a grand total of 10 other people on the server the same level as me and half of them were alliance. 
---
2/10 do not recommend.
---
Just no-life it every day after work. The wife and kids thing will sort itself out.
---
It‚Äôs a trap!
---
I kind of wanted to level an undead rogue just to gank Asmon lol but it doesn't seem worth it to play horde on his server
---
I don't think it'd be a very good argument.
---
wow started it's decline with cata, imo.
---
&gt; It's basically a trophy for any one who gets it. You claiming that any class deserves it more than any other class when they all have better options makes you a moron.
---
Lol no it's not I just have a brain and can see the logic in it.  Being an elitist is like saying you have to give it to someone who will pull the most dps out of it.  This is a legendary item, any melee class who will use it 100% of the time deserves it,  christ even a hunter would use it more.  But claiming a boomkin would be ok to give it to, on the off chance he is pvping, goes oom, and chooses to melee once or twice before he dies, needs to have a legendary item???
---
Come.
---
The.
---
Fuck.
---
On.
---
Retail player spotting boys.
---
Hmm. You're saying that when people say they don't like the changes the game has done they are really just burned out?
---
It's all relative. As a Hunter, you're the idiot in everyone's eyes, and on top of that you'll be fighting for a few slots only. But it depends if you're good and have reputation/guild that will get you in. In which case you can be who you want.
---
Hi, /u/NarutoShadowClone
---
Are they the most difficult to play well?
---
You know it‚Äôs going to get sweaty when a fan is required
---
I don‚Äôt really care to raid. Standing around while someone explains the fights isn‚Äôt my cup of tea. 
---
Maybe if raiding was more than 90% standing around and 10% actually pushing buttons
---
Lmao that was great!
---
And people like you are the reason they won't play on Pvp servers even though they want to.
---
WoW started it‚Äôs declined the exact moment they started making the content in the same extension obsolete, so, ToC release is when WoW was never the same again.
---
Same, TBC was the best iteration of WoW imo, and I really hope I get to experience that all over again.
---
My intuition is telling me the 1-30 is referencing the days in a month, this narrows it down to June or September.
---
Yes. Thankfully we can still get it during other promotions but poor alliance flavor is canceled til further notice.
---
My cat doesn‚Äôt seem to care about those things. He‚Äôs more interested in slapping my 4 k TV to remind everyone he doesn‚Äôt care for material things.
---
He wants to use SS right after his swing timer, and avoid using SS right before swing timer.  
---
SS can proc xtra attacks via talent/items/shaman totem. SS also reset the swing timer.   
---
So if you use SS 0.5s before your natural swing hits, you effectively waste a white hit, that white hit could proc extra attack. If you swing and then use SS, you get proc chance on both hits, and you don't 'miss' a white hit.  
---
White hit damage makes up about 50-60% of a rogues total damage in vanilla, so it's important to not reset timer on a white hit swing just about to land.  
---
Though with all that said, swing timers for rogues are for absolute min/max and 99%+ of rogues will do fine without.  
---
You got just as much to lose with a swing timer as you have to gain, If you time it wrong you will lose dps, and the window is narrow, rogue swing timers are not as long as warriors f.ex. 1-2sec max(slice'n'dice), so it's hard to time right while playing other mechanics. And latency can completely kill the idea of trying. I know on private servers it was close to impossible to use.
---
To error is hum.
---
I don't like IPA's, what do I drink here? Guess, I'll have the pale ale.
---
My absolutely favorite memories of WoW was during this promotion. I would wake up extra early to get a longer turn on the computer. I‚Äôd put a red for me and a blue for my older sis in the freezer so it would cool down faster. Allllll summer long we drank these almost every day as we were home alone. The parents worked weekdays and the lil sis had daycare. So much fun.
---
Idk what server you‚Äôre on but I‚Äôm always minding my business before getting ganged by a 60 NE

All I can think is how your character looked 60 minutes later in Outland greens that had twice the stats üòÇ

Was monster even a thing back then?
---
If you‚Äôre serious about raiding, plenty of guilds have sign ups already and I‚Äôm sure most of them have set raid times. 
---
But I‚Äôm not going to be playing that hardcore, I want to raid eventually so I hope this isn‚Äôt to much of an issue for me.
---
I am taking 1 week off work to play the beggining. Hope I'll get some decent lvl so I can catch up guild nerds :D

Jesus it wasn't the stoneage lol.

Yes, Monster was introduced in 2002.

No no clickers get kicked, or backpedaling... Or turning your char with keys... /gkick
---
Suppose it‚Äôs only been popular in the uk in recent years
---
Or they could put a 10-15 minute delay on their stream and eliminate almost all of those issues. 
---
If they really want to live stream an MMORPG, they better expect a following. Good and bad.
---
Retail has 30 slotbags as the highest for 3 expensions now. Only a few K each on the ah.
---
weapon skill overrated in vanilla? For a class that have white hit doing
---
50-60% of total damage?(before naxx). Your delusional.  
---
Weapon skill is what makes dagger spec BIS on horde, all the way until the hungering cold from Kel'Thuzad, and who cares at that point.  
---
Can't compare pvp vs pve though, you pick one you wanna excel at, but thinking gnomes will keep up with humans in PvE is utopia.
---
I'm on Akama, it's linked to Dragonmaw and Mug'thol. I rarely see anyone else in Akama. But There's Grim if you know who that is, XD

Oh man I remember this site! Best gear lists!

The shortage of buttons and the lame scroll wheel are the real issues - both things the Elecom seems to remedy. Also, the Elecom's software and DPI seem more gamer-friendly. I'm hoping it's a big step up. The Kingstons have served me well, but their designs are showing their age, at long last.
---
Incorrect on the gear front.  Shaman tier gear has spell damage on it.  The rings etc can be filled in with PvP, and dungeon gear, which isn't optimal but isn't a deal breaker like you're suggesting.
---
Got dang Libru... Oh.
---
Divorce would be the easiest. If she's gone, raid during the week when she has the kids. Enjoy your kids for the weekend, and be ready Tuesday for raid reset. ;)

Yeah, you don't need to post it twice in the comments. It doesn't bump the thread or serve any purpose. In fact, since you put the link in the post text you don't need it in the comments at all. At this point it's just spam.

How do we not have a release date and summer is 1 month away. Come the fuck on...

This is starting to worry me as well. 2 months ago the hype was through the roof, checking the subreddit 15 times per day. Now I'm playing Satisfactory not even as a substitute, and pretty much only get reminded to check this subreddit when a post hits my front page.
---
I guess they are pretty prepared.
---
Chris knows not what he hath unleashed
---
Which one is that?
---
Or people could not be spergs and just respect the fact that they just want to play and enjoy the game like everybody else.
---
But you and I both know that'll never happen.
---
Put their stream on a 10-15 minute delay? Dude what? You clearly don't watch streamers if you think this is an acceptable solution.
---
Happy birthday!

Where does one generally stand to best accomplish this?

Yes please

My girlfriend tried playing retail and got to level 10 on her own, she was having so much fun until some 120 ganked her. I told her she‚Äôs pretty much boned until she reaches cap at 120 to which she replied ‚ÄúI have to level 110 more times? Fuck that‚Äù

Partly agree. 120 levels is overkill, no matter the leveling speed.
---
Maybe it means May 30th? So the 'journey' is the journey to may 30th? 
---
He has another tweet saying;
---
 "My plan is to have:
---
3 Characters
---
0 Regrets"
---
Which also hints 30!
---
Yeah usually man caves like these are not very appealing to women but who cares thats not their purpose ! üòÇüòÇ
---
Off-topic but will WoW classic be runnable on Macs without partioned harddrives?
---
100% yes. They'll scrap everything from retail, except upright Orcs. It totally makes sense.
---
 ^/s
---
That's my exact sentence
---
This would be solid for me. Can we please get a premade release date gif and just edit the date on when it's announced. This is how I want it to be released.
---
Why does SS reset the swing timer? Do other instant attacks like MS, OP, BT and WW reset the swing timer if SS does?
---
I don't even remember what sever I was on at the start.
---
That time you already spend dedicated to hobbies and gaming you just devote to wow for a while. Please don‚Äôt neglect your family over this game
---
and while their back was turned.  No honor smh
---
My brother.
---
I joined his discord and looked around and he was commenting that the 24th thing was blown out of proportion, that it was for an event for his own channel or something.
---
I keep my tinfoil hat on, so I'm hoping the 24th really is beta, and Tips backed tracked in discord to protect himself from breaking blizzards NDA any more explicitly.
---
If you plan on PvE, human is BIS by far. The weapon skill racial is one of the best, if not the best racial in vanilla for PvE.  
---
As for seal fate, don't hold your breath. You will need at the very least, full AQ BIS, + all worldbuffs diremaul, onyx, and songflower from felwood. You also need to get the Book of Eviscerate to upgrade the rank, That book come into the game as naxx is released IIRC.  
---
If you do not have onyx buff and songflower, it's simply subpar.  
---
Now I played as dagger rogue, so I lost more than a sword rogue going seal fate(4 points in the off hand talent). I was 3 pieces on Naxx BIS when i stopped on private, and even at that gear level seal fate was subpar unless I had all the buffs, songflower only last 1 hour, so it's gone fast.  
---
To summerize seal fate can be fun, but it have high swings in performance. the 'normal' combat/ass builds are much more reliable and stable in their dps throughout a raid night.
---
Dude saaame!!
---
That has always been my opinion as well. It has the perfect amount of difficuly for my taste. Not everyone was able to experience the top end raids.
---
I miss my 2.3 fps
---
People tried and they died.
---
/rolleyes in swg
---
There are very few raid guilds with signups that I've seen (only 2 would kind of work for me in our guild recruitment threads) and in my experience guilds that form pre-launch or pre-expac don't always work out.
---
Doesn't need one, it's obvious they make money, where good money is made, there's a woman nearby.
---
Incorrect. You can argue it if you want. If you accuse me of lying you are more than welcome to provide evidence of your accusation. Otherwise...look into it for yourself.
---
It looks very cozy indeed, I prefer much more gaming rooms or corners with a window for the natural light
---
Why do you angle both of your monitors?
---
What they should do, IMO, is release BC and the Wrath and then stop. After that the only content updates should be to recycle the raid progression from vanilla through wrath with new gear tiers and also pvp seasons. That should keep the core customer base engaged for years to come.
---
When WoW was fun..
---
Why is there always someone acting like they're hot shit for playing on a PvP server?
---
that OG name tho
---
Can you explain this to me?  How is it wow related (casual here)
---
Ha, look at this filthy clicker! What a casual.
---
I think it's the North Park location in San Diego, CA
---
Also: if you really want it go back with 50 bucks.  Offer them 35 for it and see what happens
---
I still remember when I got vanilla as well. I had seen it in Costco a few weeks prior and had no idea what it was. It had a front cover on the box that folded open with a gryphon and all sorts of great stuff. I read a bit about it and was completely sold on the idea of an MMO and sold on the world through the art. I literally talked with my best friend about it for a week and s half straight dreaming up what the game might be like. The next time my mom came home from Costco she surprised me with it- which was a huge deal because it was so expensive and she didn‚Äôt ‚Äòget it‚Äô at all and we never had connected over fantasy concepts. I don‚Äôt know if I had ever been so excited. I poured over the instructions and that flooding box all night while my dad helped me install it. It took awhile to get it to work without terrible terrible lag on our computer but when it finally did it somehow completely met the expectations that I had been building. It‚Äôs such a warm childhood memory.
---
Pictured: No one in Naxx gear lmao
---
Its so which ever one im looking at the other is just in the corner of my eye and not distracting. it all depends on what im playing becuase all three screens are used for different games.
---
I was a clicker until badlands I think. I distinctly remember trying to break myself of the habit and get used to keybinds outside uldaman area. So about 40ish levels of clicking around?
---
Exactly, class balance was at it's best too. Plus I much rather prefer the ranked ladder climb in PvP compared to the honor system, which rewards account sharing and no-lifeing to r14
---
I experienced it the first time and I remember thinking wow this is a ONE TIME event in the game's history! I can't believe I will get to experience it again so many years later.
---
Was thinking the exact same thing, then I looked a second time at the picture and noticed the small "ipa" sign above the meny. So that was just the ipa meny, you can see another for water and HNFO (whatever that is).
---
I wouldn't be opposed to stopping at Wrath. I actually really like MoP, so I wouldn't mind going further, but that might just have been the fact it was sandwiched between two awful expansion.
---
Nah. Catch me in classic barrens chat where I belong
---
Lol I agree, was just pulling your chain. :) Plus, you can be much more efficient in game if you're well rested!
---
Not sure about Warrior mechanics.  
---
IIRC (it's been a few years) rogue special attacks triggers/grant a white hit as well, thereby resetting the timer.
---
I think what it boils down to is wanting a Classic WoW Sandbox.  I dont even want it to be an "MMORPG" per se, I want the progression to be finite.
---
holy shit.... TAKE MY MONEY
---
I think that BC was the high point for WoW and while Wrath was good the changes to the game after that were not the original WoW experience.
---
Stuck between hunter, mage and warlock. I have no need to be topping the meters in PvE, but I would like to bring some type of value so I won't have trouble finding a group. 
---
I do want a class that is strong in pvp though, particularly BGs and world. I really like the utility that pet classes bring, but mage also has a ton of utility and convenience. 
---
I typically get altitis really bad but I am trying to break that habit. I would like one class i can focus on with options so I never feel limited in what parts of the game I get to experience.
---
I filled in the form and noticed this at the bottom..."This form was created inside of University of California, Irvine"
---
I don't supposed you could go and knock on Blizzard's door and ask where our blue post is could you?  Hehe, good luck with the research!
---
Jesus bunch of salty dads that are pissed i can do relativley whatever i want as long as the stepson is cared for fed and taken to sports. Get bent
---
It's the tier 2 Paladin set as a robe.
---
It's got a picture of a big silithid on the front.  Im at work but I'll get a link for you or a picture in a few hours
---
Have you explored any custom options? I‚Äôm hesitant to have one made because it could go horribly wrong, but it might be the only option because it doesn‚Äôt seem like they have any plans to release one.
