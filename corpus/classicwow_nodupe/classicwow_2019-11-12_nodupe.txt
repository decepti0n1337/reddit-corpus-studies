Like the other guy said go for Robe of Winter Night.  Its 40 shadow sp vs void's 46 sp.  But it's 12int to void's 14sta. And the on use of void isn't really useful all that much I'd say.  On top of this Winter Night is significantly cheaper than void 12 vs 40 felcloth, 4 essence of water vs 12 essence of fire

---
---
well thats dumb lol... thank you
---
36, exactly. That is when WW axe is still OP for your level AND you get your first instant strike, Whirlwind, to abuse it with. I would highly suggest taking 36-42 a bit slow and mixing in some pvp, it really does feel like a real warrior and you won't feel that strong again until level 60.
---
So if you can achieve the same thing with hardware and software, what makes the software solution inherently worse?
---
We’re a pretty chill guild, we don’t go super hard core or anything. Pots aren’t mandatory anything like that... but we draw a line when we don’t see a very basic skill improving... lol
---
you dont need an addon for this, look in the options, social tab
---
whats the benefit of Thorium Brotherhood rep?
---
If you don't care about spending $ for gold, toss out an extra $15 and make a new account from work (hide your home IP) and buy it that way. Sit on it for a while before you use it. I've considered this but never pulled the trigger.
---
Mandatory, lol.....
---
I did this on p servers. It doesn't work in vanilla because XP is distributed proportionally to how much damage you do to the mob. The best you can do is have a high level tank pull a bunch of mobs as you kill them or have a high level heal just healspam you.
---
Btw i have two 60s I was arguing devils advocate
---
I think they'll hold on of AV, til phase 3. Using WSG as a band-aid in the same way they did DM.

Half the posts on this subreddit can be subreddit can be summarised as follows:

The diremaul 2h Mace is better because you can put a iron counterweight on it and it will effect attack speed in form, bringing bear attack speed from 2.5 to 2.43 meaning more TPS and RPS thus it actually becomes a better option than Warden Staff and also has the upside of being free. 
---
Warden Staff only surpasses the Mace after the +15 agi enchant becomes available, and even then its marginal.
---
Also on threat sensitive fights you should still use the MCP for the on use 50% attack speed bring bear down to a 1.25 AS meaning tons of TPS and RPS and swap to your defensive wep while it is on CD.
---
If this dps war is neither orc nor human perditions blade is bis for him. .
---
Serves you right
---
If you don't take 9 hours to complete a quest or you are remotely good at anything you're not enjoying the game according to Reddit
---
Leave it to beaver

Tbh losing a shadow priest probably made you a favor. Just get a shadow weaver instead. He won't get another guild anyway.

It's bullshit. He's a super nice guy. Goofy as all get out. I've never seen him be mean to anyone.
---
It may not factor into the servers population like you said, but it definitely has an impact on the population of Stormwind on a random Thursday afternoon.
---
It's like 75% + horde. I bailed for heartseeker and now I am on the 75% side, it is much much better.
---
Private server guilds always come across as really arrogant, edgy meme lords. I don't get it.
---
Who do you think is more likely to run the wowpop add on.  Someone who’s hardcore and has multiple level 60’s or a casual who has a level 32.
---
Signing the petition to ban it. It takes away so much from world pvp it’s game breaking for me really.
---
As a Horde, I love you. I like Allis that don’t coward away
---
Yes, I agree it could be deader... if it went offline.
---
right now there are 520 TOTAL horde online, 120 lvl 60. 2 horde guilds are clearing MC (3 on alliance)
---
Compare to another medium server Earthfury with 1200 online / 410 lvl 60 horde at midnight, and 12 guilds clearing MC... and a overpopulated server like Faerlina with 3700 online / 1600 lvl 60
---
AR is the very definition of dead server both in vanilla and now in classic.
---
Must have found someone with the brain hacker debuff on them to buy it at that price
---
Good, people like you don’t belong in the game
---
I wish it would fucking rain we have only seen one in 5 raids. It went to the mage that joined from our old partner guild we joint raided with. Rolls in raids are kinda screwed up when you bring someone in right before a boss 7 bosses in and they get equal chance on loot. Either way our guild is now doing solo raids and starting cepgp this week. I’m looking forward to it.
---
Btfo'd
---
software takes the manual step of a human doing the action and automates it so the human doesn't have to do the action
---
Thanks for the info!
---
I thought you could only get oily blackmouth from pools?
---
Nope. It was all changed out for WoD. 
---
In fact, the old backbone runs far better, as shown repeatedly on pservers where the performance has been significantly better than on Classic.
---
On Dreadmist I can sell them for 20s per fish.
---
You took as much time as i Need to clear cath and armory together. Will record my runs tomorrow and show you if u want - there is no risk . I get 5/6g/ reset cuz of it per Person. Quite nice.
---
We don’t banish any of the mobs. 
---
1 tank grabs all of the adds and another tank grabs Garr. 
---
AOE. Melee pulls out right before the adds die, but Garr is already dead by then. 
---
You need one priest dedicated to nothing but dispelling the add tank. 
---
EZ
---
&gt;may
---
watch only like half the ppl request get their xfers and break up even more guilds xDd
---
yes you should.
---
no there are lots of those transfer servers that are ally favoured, most of them are in fact.
---
Reiterating yourself isn't proof. As to why? Nobody believes you spent thousands of dollars over editing this video.
---
Are you alliance or horde? What race was he?
---
If alliance you should be running swords assuming you're human. Which means it's a safe bet for a fury to go daggers as it doesn't conflict with rogue interest as much.
---
If horde and he isn't orc then he should be running swords since most rogues will be aiming daggers (bc no humans). However I think there are some dagger setups that sim pretty high depending on the gear for fury. 
---
I'm ignoring pvp because raiding is pve and that's the priority. You can't expect others to prioritize essentially a different game just because it's in your interest. However I do sympathize with you. Fury has access to axes and as an orc you should aim for them anyway. Rogues can't. I usually let rogues go first on weapons as a warrior.
---
For harder-core guilds, yes the debuff limit but for those that doesn't care about that limit MS still generally isn't acceptable from my experiences. Of two equally skilled and geared players I've never seen MS come close to competing with fury. Fury DPS is S tier in classic
---
Yea, things start changing when AQ hits. Those casual guilds will start enforcing things a bit more imo....
---
Paladins should not get ring of spellpower if a caster can use it. Ever.
---
Please do
---
Minus the useless crusader enchant mats
---
[removed]
---
Not him, but P2 investments were pretty much free action potion/limited invuln/etc mats/potions, eng mats, etc. Just need to look at what releases in each phase and stock up on the stuff when it's cheap that's going to be useful for that phase.
---
You have a stroke?  Should I call an ambulance?

Blue kodo looks dumb, purple kodo looks sick as fuck

Good to know, thanks.
---
Fuck helpng dps make money ts easy for them.
---
The lowest priced oily blackmouth on my server right now are 35s each. That's a lot for 10 seconds at level 10. You only need ~257 of them to buy your mount.
---
Well yeah they chose the size of the servers themselves - its not like we forced them to choose the size of the servers. They could have just released more servers from the start instead of making so little (or releasing them just after release when people had already made plans on servers with their friends/guild). 
---
Blizzard self imposed their server sizes but they can't handle it? How is this anyone's fault but Blizzard's? 
---
Yes, Revenue =/= disposable income, but disposable income isn't what they should be using for servers/infrastructure/improvements.
---
Buffs in macro's *does not downrank* for some reason, which is why I don't buff lowbies. I can't get these two macros to work:  
---
  
---
 /run a="Arcane Intellect" b={1,4,18,32,47} c="target" d="(Rank " e=CastSpellByName if (UnitLevel(c) ~= nil and UnitIsFriend("player",c)) then for i=5,1,-1 do if (UnitLevel(c) &gt;= b) then e(a..d..i..")") return end end else e(a,1) end  
---
 /run a="Power Word: Fortitude" b={1,2,14,26,38,50} c="target" d="(Rank " e=CastSpellByName if (UnitLevel(c) ~= nil and UnitIsFriend("player",c)) then for i=6,1,-1 do if (UnitLevel(c) &gt;= b) then e(a..d..i..")") return end end else e(a,1) end  
---
So if anyone have downrank macros that work I'd like that very much.
---
And it's better than it's competitors. I agree. I'm just saying that a volunteer run squad like that won't be able to do as well as the original code made from a multi billion dollar company
---
This deserves more upvotes for being the truth.
---
I've leveled a warrior 1-60 on p servers. Let me tell you first hand, There was a massive fucking difference. Night and day doesn't even begin to explain it
---
Spy has a KoS feature built in. Don't need another addon for that.
---
This title brought to you by Powerman 5000.
---
Lol fuck onslaught
---
Will it be active in 6 months tho, that’s a harder thing to gauge.
---
People are really going to be able to take their time since they wont be able to complete stuff because they're constantly getting ganked. Not releasing BGs at the same time (or at least WSG) is dumb
---
As a warlock, so i guess knock off 100g for the free level 40 mount but I did buy the full shadoweave or whatever set while leveling too. But yeah I had enough for the warlock mount (\~650 gold buying mats from ah and then there's i think 400g you have to pay for items) when i dinged.
---
&gt;I played horde in vanilla
---
All I needed to know. Not gonna waste anymore time talking to the biased guy who had it on easy mode from day one.
---
2. And 5. Come together to form the penis.
---
indeed, so no chance thats happening.
---
I am not talking about a hypothetical logical implementation, I am talking specifically about the implementation suggested by the person I was responding to.  Who flatly said "remove it for enemy players".  Meaning no data from enemy players.  Meaning no "what happened to me".
---
Send me their names. I’ll make sure to ruin their lives. Scum alliance.
---
Are you mad your guild lost or something with these "this is spliced" crying? Literally logs were posted.
---
You don't spec arms for raids regardless.  2h != arms
---
And you can actually afford to buy all your spells as you level, afford a mount etc.
---
i lold
---
I also have Ardent Defender.
---
Posts like this remind me why I don't play games too often with my friends
---
You know it’s bad when a group is reporting Eskhanders as “exciting”
---
Lok'tar is orcish. He's on horde.
---
It would depend if those specific new recipes are being used or not. If yes then demand increases, price goes up.If not then demand doesn’t change, price unchanged.

Fake?

---
What level are you?
---
To he fair, it literally says in all caps on the free transfer page "THIS SERVICE MAY BECOME UNAVAILABLE WITHOUT NOTICE"
---
What do you plan to do in classic? 
---
Do you want a guild that's pushing content and raiding seriously? 
---
Or are you more casual and happy to join a more social guild that raids but doesn't care about optimal specs and gear and will have more wipes and go slower and never see naxx or possibly even the end of BWL?
---
At my stage of life I've gone for the later, having a blast making friends and just messing around abit. I know the guild I am in would have no issue taking a ret pally or two along (at least for mc and ony) but then other guilds who are more serious will want you to respec. There's some youtube guys you should probably check out too, i forget the names but there's a channel I saw in particular of a guy who raided naxx on pservers as ret and he had a guide for consumables to make you mid pack DPS. It was basically stacking as much on hit consumes as you can.
---
What do u work at
---
One every few days? So you'd be happy with it taking 2700 days to sell these?

Crucial error: movement speed is normalised.
---
Yeah that guild's going no where. "Why can't we kill this boss we need more DPS guys!" &gt; Gives gear to tank.
---
The other problem I see in guild is "willing to help". It is  always about "you". You made friends by being helpful. In out guild, certain people and I will get help immediately if ask because we actually spend our time helping others. You will get ignored eventually if you talk/help in guild, just like in real life.
---
I mean I feel you to an extent. With skyroam and games like that I could take an hour or two making my guy. So I get it.  You just seem to be a little more extreme :).  I guess the good thing is that you don't have that many options, and besides when she get gear your guy looks a lot different anyway. Good luck buddy. You'll get one soon
---
Yep can confirm, I've gotten a few back to back lotuses in a zone withing 45-50 min, so the spawn rate seems to vary.
---
They might as well, streamers aren't going to have this problem as they are all in the same server with zero plans to transfer.
---
There are no big voices to hold them accountable.
---
Yeah it’s only worth using SS if you get a full duration of it before the mob dies.  If the mob is gonna die before it runs out then it’s probably not worth the mana.
---
Okay, it was only a very loose example. The point was only sell one or two here or there. Just not throwing a ton up in the AH and driving the prices down or whatever. It’s a steady income. Even IF it was 120g every couple days that’s still a decent income regardless of it taking 2700 days to sell.
---
Found the Rogue Main?
---
What, imp wingclip saves entire runs. There's nothing to do BUT spam wingclip and a 5 second snare can buy you bandage time if the opponent is out a blind.
---
At least somebody has a sense of humor!
---
Oh how the turn tables
---
Stay at home dad
---
Stylepoints. 8-)
---
Oh they are.  Saying Alliance should have been happy to stay on their low Alliance population servers.
---
I think just buying some recipes from a dude in BRD. I’m guessing mostly blacksmithing recipes
---
That’s exactly what I thought for years before changing my mind. 
---
However, I just watched the scene again. He hadn’t killed Paul Allen yet. 
---
Now I’ve just changed my mind again.
---
I play alliance now because alliance have by far the easier ony attunement and pally buffs are much better than totems. You have to be trolling.

Although smaller than many guilds, our player base is active. Members frequently run higher-level dungeons at all hours of the day. We have established a collaborative environment where members help each progress. When not raiding, many of our members engage in World PvP or level alts together. We have a lively Discord with conversations ranging from Dungeons and Dragons to oceanography.
---

&gt;Classic feels good because I can use addons to ignore all the features in classic.

Congratulations! We're having our second soon and I'm a little worried I'll be on an extended break from video games. It's all good, but ya know.

Reroll or make new friends

If you PvP as a shaman, the prototypical spec is 30/0/21.
---
The 30/0/21 build, shown below, has a typical rotation like: Lighting Bolt, Chain Lightning, Earth Shock, Nature's Swiftness to Lighting Bolt. That's a 2 sec spell, 1.5 sec spell, instant, big instant. Start off with an Iron Grenade and you'll almost always get the first two spells off during the 3 sec stun, resulting in a massive burst combo. If the opponent's not dead, drop a Fire Totem and keep shocking. This is probably the most common PvP spec you'll see, or something very close to it (like subbing Elemental Mastery for Nature's Swiftness).

We're not proposing anything. The point we're making is that he can't sell these effectively without causing a price crash. That's all it is.
---
Are you somehow unaware that there are many servers?  I can't see how that's possible since you have to choose one to create your character.
---
tfw you hold players hostage on shit servers where they get corpse camped by zergs anytime they try to play. 
---
tfw the zergs are crying that they are allowed to transfer off
---
I came from exclusively pvp servers since vanilla and I rerolled to PvE and it has been INCREDIBLE.  
---
There's been moments where I wonder if pvp was better (no reason, just thinking) and then I get a notification from spy about several alliance entering my quest area and I initially get stressed but then realize it doesn't matter and I can afk when I need to and actually enjoy pve when I want and pvp when I want.
---
As for people saying pvp doesn't happen, I regularly see places under attack on world defense and plenty of pvp flagged enemy players around and this is on windseeker which isnt one of the highest pop servers.
---
Sarcasm I think
---
Good call, that's what I'm doing. Got a 39 druid and 23 pally right now and it'll be months before they both reach 50.
---
Did you think he will be okay you just put on follow and not doing anything? Like the other poster said, BRD is pretty high level so I’m not sure why he even bothered doing that, might as well just run with his mate and keep all the loot to themselves if that’s what they wanted
---
Wow, another really clever response. You're clearly too intelligent for me to debate against. Especially considering you still haven't said a single thing relevant to my comment...
---
As a Ret paladin, I support breaking all DPS meters.
---
That sounds like trickle down economics you damn republican!
---
Yep. At least your gracious in defeat.
---
Proper Resurrection for druid
---
Bank Alts have to be normalized into the data
---
Thats all I can think. I wonder if he wasnt on the building and i just happend to have a grounding if we'd both die.
---
NOOOOOO
---
No:  to become a wrecking ball in pvp as a warrior you need 1) gear 2) people healing you
---
If you have neither of these things, rogue is more fun.  But if you do get good gear and are in a position to often have heals with you then warrior is more fun.
---
I'm more interested in why guards aggro'd me
---
10/10 would open lockboxes again
---
thnx
---
5% of it does
---
Another reason it can't be banned: WE HAD THIS SHIT IN VANILLA. It was called "Drag your Combat Log window out to be a 2nd chatbox and watch for enemy player names loading buffs as they come in range" - Source: I did this in Vanilla and BC before they updated the Combat Log tab to be the modern "What happened to me?" shit that we have now, and in Classic. That didn't exist in Vanilla, it was much more robust and less self-focused.
---
MOM!! THE GUYS IN WOW ARE BEING WEIRD AGAIN

What level are you getting the toons to? You’ll find once you hit 20-30 things get really interesting for each class, they start to show their benefits of different abilities and talents further improve that.
---
You’ll also find out what their weaknesses are and how to play to their strengths.
---
Give them some time, but yes, there will be certain classes that appeal to you in different ways based on their play style. Some will probably appeal more than others.
---
I’d never really played a mage beyond level 10 previously, bored with the limited spells etc. you hit 20-30 and start getting a lot of different spells, blizzard, cone of cold etc and things get really fun. AoE mechanics are a lot of fun, frustrating to get right to begin with, but once you have the basics down, it’s extremely powerful in certain quests where other classes would require a group, it becomes a standard quest for you as if you were just grinding mobs.
---
Rogues will be a lot of fun leading into PvP.
---
oof jesus that made me salivate
---
If you stealth further away you don't show up in the combat log therefore the add-on doesn't see anything. Maybe you have no clue how it works
---
Because the grounding totem got hit i imagine. But they should have aggroed to him first but he was on a building.
---
Pve servers are a completely different game with a lot less freedom and reduced player agency.  It is the price you pay for having an easier time of things in contested zones.  If it is worth it or not is really your choice.
---
Don't do it like this guy!  
---
Don't serpent-sting before auto-shot!
---
Reroll on an RP-PvP server...
---
They are very different. 
---
Warrior is a front liner that is very gear dependent. 
---
Rogue will sneak to the back and take out healers and squishies.
---
6 servers in the last two weeks at 2:1 horde/alliance ratio or higher. Why is stalag always singled out?
---
Can confirm picking fights with bigger players and some lucky pot shots with high nature gear is actually tasty
---
It also brings me a lot of jot
---
Try your servers discord
---
The free transfer announcement clearly states EVERY TIME that the transfers are temporarily available and may close at any time, if you are stretching transfers out, you deserve what you get.
---
They said incendius on the post but did not edit the list for incendius
---
Can we have a daily "is it too late to...." megathread?
---
Haha I love that he switches to English once it’s time to start cursing
---
No way will a pve character ever be able to transfer to a pvp realm. MAYBE pvp to pve, but never pve to pvp.
---
No.
---
They will never allow PVE to PVP transfers
---
I'm in Thunderfury/Alliance
---
stalagg is 80:20
---
I get amused when the nochanges idiots hypocritically suddenly want changes when problems become apparent.

I want things fixed, it I also love seeing people suffer from their own dogma

&gt;Reply
---
I've been stopping at 10 to try a different one out, which is probably too soon, but I wanna really feel the play style before I dig too deep. So far I am enjoying the warlock quite a bit.
---
&gt; I play alliance now because alliance have by far the easier ony attunement
---
Nice parody, I laughed.
---
do you think you're the only level 60 on herod that uses reddit?
---
the announcement said the 12th, was the release day. Pretty sure its just the world bosses being held off till thursday
---
What was your level?
---
To be honest I didnt really notice that name was blizzard's when I posted this. I was more concerned with the GM thing and the message. Never encountered a GM message in WoW before so I didn't know what to expect  really.
---
I advise to not save porn especially these days. You never know what is going to be technically underage and gets removed
---
Yeah :(
---
The problem with pve servers is the price you pay for avoiding ganks is vastly reduced player agency.  Like it or not, pvp adds a lot of unpredictable gameplay which keeps things fresh and interesting.  Removing things like this drastically changes the game.
---
Hahahaha sucked in I left my level 50 mage on felshitter and started new on arugal because it was so dead
---
:thinking:
---
This was about stroking your peen, not your e-peen.
---
Thumbs down. Paying for blizzards screw ups. OUT.
---
On my server, prices of Heavy Stone and Solid Stone are skyrocketing already. They are now 13 and 16s each. They are mats for Dynamite and Grenades used in PVP.
---
There’s some recipes, largely blacksmithing but also at least a couple LW, Tailoring, Alchemy, and Enchanting. At one point in time these were considered good fire resist gear for MC, no idea if that’s still true.
---
Stalag is 2h/1a. 66/33 or so.
---
Gankers would do the same thing dude, unless everyone goes to pve servers.
---
You could roll Alli and transfer your wealth through the neutral AH. At least then you won't have lost everything?
---
It recently changed to just horde because there are tons of alliance there. You had forever to do this.
---
Relatively common, people XP run lower levels for all loot so the player getting ran doesn't have to pay.
---
because they dont actually want a pvp server, but didnt wanna seem soft. so they go to the dominant side to see as little pvp as possible.
---
Why ? It doesn't detect stealthed players.
---
Network with big raiding guilds and strike a deal with leadership. Lot of meat on the bone for all parties involved. Hell come to Stalagg and I'll broker a deal for you and a *modest* percentage...
---
But all the youtubers say it's coming :O 
---
Who are you to be so rational about this?! 
---
How many followers do YOU have?????
---
THEY are showing blizz what we REALLY want!

Hmm I like that idea
---
Lol drama of my own. happened this Thursday @ onyxia. first encounter with LC drama. 
---
background: we have a three hunter raid setup.  I'm the top performing hunter, with #2 very close to me (both average 95% parsing) and #3 not that close (around 60-70).
---
I missed my first MC on tuesday.  During that raid hunter #2 got one piece and hunter #3 got three pieces of gear.  On Onyxia, dragonstalker helm dropped and ofc the head (for bis neck).  I knew for sure helm was mine (best performer, lowest loot recieved, pull and mark all mobs in mc, class leader etc). all while LC was happening we /roll on ony neck.  (our guild /rolls neck for tanks and melee dps)  Hunter #3 wins roll.  He's now up to piece four this week.  Then LC announces "hunters roll on helm" Hunter #3 wins role which puts him to 5 pieces in 1 week.  I'm tilted AF as 5 pieces is more than myself and hunter #2 have received in the last 6 weeks of raiding and we are the top performers.  After a 30 minute walk i decided to gquit.  I felt that decision was way too harsh for missing one raid in a semi-hardcore guild.  I work full time + grad school so I felt like fuck is this really how heavy they weigh attendance? It was the only rational decision I could come up with.

GM and I talk for an hour+ in disc and I decide to come back.  He explained how they made a mistake and didnt think it through enough because they were distracted by a viskag drop.  He also said that he missed that hunter #3 had gotten band of acuria two weeks ago.  They also said that they dont consider onyxia head as a piece (which I disagree with) because to them all that need it will have it in the guild soon if we're doing split raids (two a week, or four a week on certain weeks with resets).  I disagree that they dont count neck lol.  Ultimately I've agreed with 95% of their decisions up to this week and I like the guild but they really fucked up and have little room for error with me atm.
---
They aren't blocking the transfer of the other half of the population. These realms have to be really imbalanced if they decided to do this so more than likely they're only blocking a third of the population and are hoping that enough Horde fuck off so by the end of all this it's a 50-50 realm.
---
And judging by Reddit whining about these exact servers it seems like most of these are at least 7:3 H:A
---
I just send my pet in to pull a ton then howl and triple dot them all. Tap and start draining one. If I get a instant shadow bolt I use it on one and finish it with drain by the time they get back I’ve killed one my pets killed one and the the others are around 15 % I just wand or drain them. What level are you?
---
I don't understand how you got that from my post... I wish they did faction specific transfer from the get-go so Stalagg wouldn't be so imbalanced.
---
little known fact is that how many of a certain mob will spawn depends on the time of day for example in felwood there is a quest to kill wolfs and bears if you do the quest mid day there will very few wolfs around if you do the quest around midnight there will be very bears around. an other is in the hinterlands where how many owlkin things you need like 20 off spawn way less during the night.
---
i don't know why they did it this way in vanilla maybe they wanted you to leave a quest undone come back at a later time to do it?
---
Not gonna lie, this is the cancer mentality that birthed retail.
---
Two kills here. One drop, one win. RNG is a cruel mistress.
---
Submit a ticket and apparently they'll put you back.

I'm positive it's harder in past and present. You can look through the chains on wowhead and see how clearly one is a far bigger pain in the ass than the other with the bullshit in BRD vs simple dungeon runs and a few world elites. The entire spark that started this conversation was how the original post above pointed out how impossible it was for alliance players to even find the fucking npc to continue the quest chain. Why did they have to design the quest with a big fuck you good luck? Why couldn't it be like the horde where they say "hey go find rexxar in desolace" and be done with it? Because if you DID experience alliance properly, you would see how much worse they have it in virtually every regard. Sometimes it's huge things, sometimes it's little things. One thing that I've just these past couple months discovered that I never knew all these years but ABSOLUTELY felt, was the NPC ability called Thrash. It is a windfury like buff that makes the next melee attack proc 2 more on swing. Alliance players start suffering enemies with these abilities in the fucking single digit levels while the earliest enemy horde face that uses it during their questing, is in the late 20s. Alliance have shit stacked against them in far more ways than any horde player can possibly comprehend. When even the fucking developers themselves throughout the years have admitted they play horde and cheer on with their cringy RP "for the horde" bullshit it couldn't be any more obvious what the truth is.
---
Why would they do that? I thought blizzard hated its players. /s
---
Restroratrion?
---
sounds lile a shit show, reroll whitemane we are taking refugees
---
You did the right thing, sacrificing for the guilds progressions.  People notice that shit.  If youre officers dont reward you for this down the line in the next 2 months, gtfo
---
Like what addons? Name a few.
---
Removing the entered stealth detail from the combat log wont affect anyone but you pathetic plebs crying about rogue's downloading your pathetic addon so you can stop hiding in a corner frightened out of your minds. It'll get sorted, blizzard just takes forever to get shit fixed.
---
&gt;as an alliance who xffered off Staalag to Heartseeker
---
All im saying is that Heartseeker is imbalanced enough and we don't need alliance transferring here. 
---
Luckily they switched it to horde only
---
But it tracks it using the combat log. Imagine fighting baron geddon with no way to tell who bomb because that locked under the combat log. Sure you would know he cast the ability but you wouldn’t know who untill the bomb goes off.
---
You hand over the scales so the guild can make onyxia skin cloaks for everyone when BWL launches.
---
And you are showing everyone you are a toxic shit
---
Can't help sorry I'm alliance.
---
Corrupt how?
---
People do use harware solutions to multibox, and yes you can split a single keyboard to broadcast 1 keystroke to 5 computers using HARDWARE ONLY.  In addition, you can switch between broadcasting to all computers or any one of the 5.  Now that being the case, why is the hardware solution somehow better than the software solution in your mind?
---
I would ask the guild master what is the protocol 
---
And there should be a guild bank set up 
---
If tit wasn’t announced  in guild chat then that person may have been scamming .   Most times they will tell you ahead if you would pleas put things in guild bank
---
Your guild has 6 raid groups?!
---
Any chance horde will actually xfer? Probably about as likely as Blizz to unban Blitz
---
Maybe the other guy means it doesn't account for a set bonus like "reduces aimed shot cast by .1 sec" or something, that would require internal changes to the sim
---
this aged poorly
---
&gt; Does using demo shout/roar more than once generate more threat, 
---
It generates threat based on mobs affected iirc. As an example, in BWL back in Vanilla, I spammed battle shout to aggro the mobs while I was tanking a doorway.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
&gt; how do you link dps meters in chat? I have details addon. 
---
There's a report button.
---
Already rerolled to Arugal. Just hurts to leave so much work behind :(
---
ez ignore (not that I needed to)
---
So, I'm not the only one... Really regretting the PvP decision. It's so stupidly annoying, but I'm not re-rolling.
---
Too late. Classic Blizzard.
---
LBRS right before we went and did our Seal
---
Reroll friends
---
Learning every skill is not really a god idea while leveling. I level very few
---
Nice
---
Enjoy ur stay on stalagg...
---
It's so stupid that we can't regret our PvP choice and go to a PVE server.
---
This isn't going to solve anything, the calls for faction population queues have begun, so that's the next thing we're going to be hearing about.
---
You can't complain about queues or population if you want to stay on that server. It's either or, regardless of reason for staying.
---
I wasn't being righteous, I'm being realistic. Everyone's complaining is fucking annoying when they can fucking fix it.

I've been on Heartseeker since it went live.. I do agree we need more horde aka more victims :D
---
There are hundreds of these guy across the barrens and in mythology centaurs are no different so you seem to be the only one that is confused.
---
I suitor strongly encourage you to hang up and call back. This works for flight issues, cell phone stuff, cable company, etc. If you have the time, it will very likely pay off. "There's nothing I can do" is routinely not true.
---
Click the gear icon, set to custom EP, then there's a dropdown to set the phase
---
BGs will not be realm exclusive and even if they were, PvE servers have plenty of people interested in BGs.
---
Oof yeah I feel bad for anyone playing or transferring to felstriker.
---
Entropy isn't exactly perfectly
---
This sounds a lot like my guild. You on Razorgore?
---
I mean, I am 300 LW and I have the head to turn in. I should get the recipe so for me thats not really a reason to handover when I can just make the cloak for guild

No

"This launch has been an absolute catastrophe".
---
Exaggerate much?
---
I laughed out loud and you instantly lost any credibility your post may have had reading any further.
---
Adapt. Overcome.
---
Personally no not really. I was very hyped for classic and I'm already pretty bored and fully raid geared (druid healer). If they stick to 3-6 months per phase I'm all but guaranteed to be gone before AQ drops (that'll be 1-2 years from now at this rate). I enjoy the game a lot but just being real there are at least 5 great games coming out in the next year that I want to play.
---
I leveled about 1/2 to 2/3 of my skills while level. When I hit 60 I decided to learn them all, because I didn't know when better to learn them.
---
Why are they so expensive? They're fuckin *everywhere* in the swamps
---
Imo the trash items not worth the +1 shouldn't count towards it, as they can still be upgrades, but the person who wins it has to pay the cost of the de/vendor.
---
Hahahah this all makes a lot more sense now, honestly understandable mistake
---
Ugh 14 days played and level 57 that's rough. I know why you feel like it stopped to a halt and that's because you're hanging in LFG channel and waiting for groups to form for dungeons.
---
I'm le4vel 53 on my paladin and I'm at 6,5 days played and I feel like I wasted tons of time in the game already by waiting for groups. 52-53 took me 7 hours /played because I did 5× BRD arena run (complete skip and really bad xp) and one run of ST and ZF. After just doing quests now I'm on pace to do 53-54 in 4-5hours for comparison...
---
I realized that waiting for groups to form and travelling is just a huge waste of time and as such I won't even do any more dungeons unless I get the full quest runs or a group made specificaly for farming XP will form.
---
If you want to leave you can always reroll don't punish the rest of the realm because you made a shit decision
---
Actually, we aren't. Read up on your lore.
---
That not how crit works. Spell hit on the other hand
---
etc.
---
Yeah, we will see what happens. I've been monitoring Alli chat and there is moderate interest in world PvP. So I don't suspect you'll have too hard of time finding people to fight in the wild, and I don't think you'll be camped.
---
I got 60 in 9d10h and felt like I was taking my time. Just different styles I guess.
---
Exactly! As it is now, i feel bad killing horde. We need more victims so i can kill with a clear conscience Haha
---
Definitely want to use it for some fights/sections.
---
I usually apply sharpening stones at garr and continue with that.
---
Ayayaya
---
I like being full of dmg and shared healing, winning is a side benefit.
---
Manually set your wow directory not NOT be read only in the file folder properties.
---
Not sure if itll work but its worth a try.
---
Wdym they broke census data so you can't prove any imbalance.  200 iq
---
I'd like to know the % of the faction balance on the servers. Only graphs I can see are the ones posted in September.
---
&gt;/script local i; CastShapeshiftForm(1); Cast BloodRage; Cast Charge(Rank 1); for i = 0,15 do if ( GetPlayerBuffTexture(i) == "Interface\\\\Icons\\\\Ability\_Racial\_BloodRage") then CancelPlayerBuff(i); end;
---
That's a shame
---
I would break everything up into the following below categories. There are pros and cons for each class and each spec. Consider a role you might like and just give it a shot. There are also pros and cons for each faction \[Horde vs Alliance\]. If you have questions feel free to ask!

# Ranged
---
* Warlock \[Has a pet\]

* Hunter \[Has a pet\]
---
* Mage - summons food/water, makes portals
---
* Shaman \[Elemental\]

# Healing
---
* Priest
---
* Druid \[Resto\]
---
* Shaman \[Resto\]
---
* Paladin \[Holy\]

---
* Warrior \[Protection\]

* Druid \[Feral / Bear\]

---
Felcloth, crit isn’t quite as important for a warlock as spell power
---
Coercing people off of the realms that their friends and guilds are on with queues is just gonna result in a mass exodus from the game and it isn’t gonna happen.
---
Tbf tho it's not that dps warrs don't need tier gear, it's that it's just it's for tanks and there's hardly any loot in mc for dps warrs. Still, i'd say rogues get dagger prio, assuming they're dagger spec or have been planning to go it as one drops.
---
That is a fantastic shot.
---
You did good.  The people complaining probably play alliance
---
I do ony with 4-5%
---
Someone with sword would never roll on staff, sword is way better. Staff rolling on sword, however...
---
If only there was some I don't know. Fucking clarity before they pulled shit like this. Also where are all the #nochanges crowd now? Or are we ignoring it because this helps all the assholes who like their 5:1 ratio advantage? Slippery slope, I want to see my heals and interact with billboards while on my mount. Changes are here! Also give Paladins a taunt.
---
No mine are always cheap :(
---
Maybe I'm missing something but why are Priests significant here?
---
And even if it was just a regular ninja I'd never want to group with him.  Decent people dont ninja unless they are just misinformed about actually needing an item
---
Kang the decapatater droped in my ST group and i lost it by 1 point T_T
---
Alliance needs to stay tf away from Heartseeker anyways we are already greatly outnumbered on horde
---
Over 700 spellbinders killed since getting mobinfo2. ~200 before. Zero crusader drops. I did get a freezing band from an entropic horror while farming elemental fire. Sold it for 650g. The only other boe epic I've had drop while solo farming was robes of insight while leveling. I think I got 20g for them after a week of trying. I was like level 52 and there weren't but about 30 level 60s on my server at the time, so no one had any gold yet.
---
I didnt see the name, I'll have to look at op
---
Horde better fucking start moving now.
---
But then I can’t agony?
---
Alliance DPS Warrior on Thunderfury Looking for raiding guild! Love my current guild, but they have too much melee DPS and it's led to me being rotated out of two MC groups despite being signed up a week in advance and in raid group half an hour early both times. I get the problem, but would love to experience some end game content if anyone is recruiting: before too late to join any guild as classic moves onward.
---
Looking for a guild that is late night, after 9 server time, or weekend raiding. Don't care how far into MC guild is: I can farm rep with Hydraxian warlords if need to, and run dungeons if needed (tho I don't know how much help a melee DPS will be in dungeon running).
---
I don't have a lionheart helm: all I have is about 10 pieces pre-bis. Mostly missing UD Strat Cape, Savage Glad Chest and UBRS gear. I know it's kind of a large amount I'm asking for: our server honestly has too many melee DPS. But figured would put this out there just in case. Have a good night.
---
HO HO HO MOTHERFUCKER
---
Crusader enchant still goes for 300g at my server. So far the most valuable ones I got is a mooncloth bag recipe, 40g, shifting cloak pattern 65g, and myrmdon's signet, 175g. Also got a few 16 slot bags that sells at about 20g
---
How long have the transfers been available? I also remember them saying that transfers would be turned off at any time with no warning. Looks like that happened?
---
Zygor is run to this zone, do 2 quests grind rest of level, go here do 2 quests grind rest of level. It doesn't even feel like a guide.
---
What incentive do Horde have to change realms I dont see this helping the balance much in places like Herod and Fairbanks
---
I was confused because of the nasty ogre face!
---
I thought it's common knowledge that 69 always wins no matter what???? Lol
---
Fuck off
---
The Alliance is the equivalent of a lifted pick-up truck with huge, oversized tires.  It looks pretty sweet, but everyone knows they're overcompensating. 
---
Come play Horde.  #teambigD
---
I hope you weren't trying to transfer to heartseeker to just do the same to horde. Would be pretty sad
---
I'm only lvl 40 so I'll probably be playing in 3-4 years. I just don't have a lot of free time.
---
Dumb.
---
This sounds awful and amazing at the same time. Imagine playing a post-apocalyptic zombie/monster game where all of the mobs are controlled by real people.
---
Alternatively, if you end up as the last of your faction on a server Blizz should give you some sort of 'Last Man Standing' buff that turns you into a 40 man raid boss. You could still clear end game content by yourself while striking fear into the hearts of the opposing faction.
---
FWIW, check your ping. I noticed a significant difference (order of magnitude 300 vs 30) in ping difference from my location.
---
A warrior with BOF or FAP and can kill you in 3 globals. You have to win the fight before you're sitting in Melee range spamming 25% wing clip proc rates and praying the Warrior doesn't get a crit.
---
What’s the best way to start this?
---
I want a second account. Have a 60 hunter already. Could this be enough?
---
Can clear garr with 2 tanks and no warlocks, one tank aoe tanks all the adds on the side and the raid nukes garr.  Little risky with only 2 tanks though.
---
On the other hand, Horde are kind of missing out on the feeling being hunted 24/7. Playing Alliance teaches you to look around all the time while killing mobs and if your awareness is good you'll get by just fine.
---
what item?
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEading comprehension ftw
---
Alliance is complete fucked, can't transfer, can't get through queue because horde won't transfer, and can't move because horde is grinding "honor" 24/7
---
for sure, that's fair. At this point, I'd rather just suck it up and get through. I'm so close and really don't have much time to play these days. Plus, I'm still looking forward to max-level where I won't be auto-outclassed but level - I've made peace with what will certainly be some gear disparity here and there. I do like random PvP, just not being ganked. But that's the package with PvP servers lol.
---
That's kind of the nice thing about Classic. It really isn't going anywhere. Take a few weeks off, level an alt, multiple alts, try out the opposite faction on a diff server.
---
Actually lol'd irl. 
---
Then I cried
---
Level 49
---
Honest question, what is it about those party frames you like? They feel so congested and so inefficient.
---
Did this on my shaman level 35. Pull mob. Auto attack it. Tab out to read up on shit. Tab in again and heal myself, tag the next mob and tab out again.
---
Level 60 warrior, Horde on Stalagg.  Looking for a guild with players who are active during the morning/afternoon for dungeons, pvp, raiding, or whatever!  I work in retail so my schedule is irregular but I'd like to find some solid people to run content woth!

There is a Combat Log Config page that has many useful filters. You have messages sources, message types, colors, formatting, settings. 
---
Under sources you could choose a Source&gt;DoneTo&gt;Enemy player. That would show you all actions done to an enemy player within the radius of what the combat log can pick up. You could have a log window that only shows this if you wanted.
---
Yes I actually do have windows setup the i am constantly watching. Different ones setup for different situations.  It is no different that watching the LookingForGroup channel or window  like Details or Recount.
---
It's really not that much more time considering the whole conversation started by saying &lt;22 days played was casual.
---
It's not.
---
I thought all it meant was it won’t “reset” as in it’ll still run away but won’t ever reset or some shit. Okay I’ll give this a shot
---
If they had we wouldn't get our dose of ''THEY LISTENED!''. Gotta keep dangling dat carrot.
---
I meant group wpvp.
---
the value of spell hit and crit changes based of how much of the other stats you have that's basic maths.
---
With 380SP, 1% crit = \~13SP, if you have lot less spellpower, crit will have lower value.
---
This early on spellpower is by far the best, crit and hit only start getting value when you have lot of spellpower in BWL/AQ.
---
i was tryna swap to heartseeker so i could play the game
---
Dude's gotta eat
---
Or they can just restrict addon api's access to combat log.
---
Agreed. They've already all but said they're happening though.
---
You think spell batching means his attack didn’t get processed for 3-4 seconds? Lmao
---
Not pulling more mobs but I had this guy fearing the mobs in a dungeon every time we pulled more then he expected (I assume). The only problem was we were trying to aoe farm.
---
It’s mostly min maxing. Characters take ages to level up so people optimize them and Horde have better racials. People aren’t playing dwarf priests because their tastes changed. The amount of orc warriors in my guild is comical.
---
The best thing I did while leveling a warrior was wait for quests to turn “green” in my quest log before attacking them. At that point you can run through a ton of quest mobs before having to stop and eat.
---
i've heard - anecdotally - they they may have secretly increased the rate - circumstantial tho XD
---
and that's just a...not good thing.
---
Warstomp (2 sec stun) &gt; Hibernate (1.5sec cast) &gt; walk away.
---
TLDR the drama for me? Why is everybody so heated lol
---
forcing alliance players to stay on trash balance servers is not going to be some magical solution to this shit. 
---
you are just asking for a slow bleed over a hemorrhage, still the same end result
---
I’m 5 levels away from 60, I’ve never felt more accomplished. Retail will never feel good to me, the only thing it does for me is the lore.
---
I love warcraft lore but classic is superior.
---
Drain tank all the way. I rarely fear. It’s just causes more of a hassle.
---
The lack of communication is something we have dealt with for ages with Blizzard.  But atleast they are trying and going ahead with faction only transfers like we asked to preventer 90/10 pop servers.  Give them a chance to handle this problem... they clearly are trying to assist people with it that are willing to make a ticket.
---
It's not slander if it's true.
---
It's a given that ''THEY LISTENED!''. It's what they do. Handle things extremely poorly, then do a none apology or the slightest change, then simply wait for the whores to come crawling.
---
you are just asking for a slow bleed over a hemorrhage, still the same end result.
---
I think they look pretty, are simple, and the animation is nice, too.
---
Which is a lot more accurate than the wow realm pop list that was only relevant the first two weeks of the game after it stopped working. Guilds that do end game raids are much more reflective of the overall balance than an add on based on the first two weeks
---
So he's a failed thieving scumbag AND a whiner. A real crass act.
---
True dat, got a lot of tasty fish school nearby
---
A 'good' player, of any class, is better then a carbon copy DPS meter junkie of the same class imho. I played ret before ret was cool back in the days and still got into all the raids because I was a good player and used all your abilities of your class.. you can take that player and drop them in a good alt, and they'd still do alot better.. that's all I meant by it. Find a guild that enjoys you as a player, not just your min/maxed class, and you will enjoy it alot more
---
ah ok, i have found 1 randomly. 
---
i have 'farmed' for them once. and i just check the spawn points and did something else.
---
as it's my main, i can't justify the time for lotus 'farming'. i can flip things on the ah - not great at it, but it's ok.

Warden Staff, Underworld Band, Greater Arcane Elixir recipe, Distilled Wisdom recipe (130 g) and Transmute Undeath to Water recipe (split gold equal since it was a guild grp, 175g per person) 2x Greater fire prot potion recipe roughly 100-110g a pop.

There's a minor and obvious problem involved? Let's think about it afterwards. That way our fans will create ''THEY LISTENED'' posts for us and we can sit back and laugh.

Skullflame shield from DM ogres - Sold for 500g

Myrmidons Signet from Strath trash - Sold for 150g

Robe of the Void - 100g  
---
Sapphiron's Scale Boots - 40g

Other than that, I've gotten some pretty average BoE blues like Needler that just got vendored.
---
It rewards people for doing the bare minimum permissible and doesn't account for the actual maximum value that drop could provide the guild as a whole if it were to go to the right player, that's why. As a playerbase, we're smarter than we were 15 years ago and we've outgrown it.

huh thats interesting. i currently have over 400 pre buff in my raid gear, maybe after buffs the crit would be worth it? these gloves are basically the last thing I \*could\* buy... does seem like the sp would still be better though huh? thanks for the info, that's helpful!
---
You're actually extremely lucky, it's a damn brain hacker. When TBC released I had two in my bank because they just wouldn't sell.
---
One of the most trash BoE epics, change my mind.
---
ill move on and kill another.
---
You can't expect everyone to follow your play style. Just because you want to "take it slow" doesn't mean everyone else needs to do the same so you don't fall behind. That's how online games work, either you put the time in or you make peace with being a casual.
---
For the record: I'm in the "take it slow" team, I just don't whine about it.
---
That tank is so lucky
---
Surely racials do not have that much of an impact? Not enough to, own their own, lead to a 60:40 Horde:Alliance split.
---
They pug 60s.
---
It's fair if everyone's using it.
---
damn that's a good idea
---
They're acting out every NPC interaction IRL
---
*cowers in the corner on my 48 alt*
---
Literally just cleave domos adds and pray.
---
Had a blue mace that I ended up having to vendor because no one would buy it for more than the vendor price
---
Had a truefaith recipe that sold for 80g (seems about normal on this server)
---
That's about it.
---
If I recall correctly the rolls are a truncated 4 digit roll so realistically they all rolled between 9900 and 10,000.
---
It used to take my guild 6 hours to clear this godforsaken place.  Those were the days.
---
But that's a problem that could have been avoided. It's going to waste a lot of time for everyone involved.
---
Immensely.
---
Because people want to feel better about themselves in general so they project their high ability in this game as a high ability in life
---
Ehh. In current phase yes. But pally healers will keep that longer than most if not all caster dps will down the road. I say that as a mage. I dont mind rolling against rallies for it. Given that I'm already rolling vs 8 other mages...
---
I’ve got a tonne of PvP videos from wow beta (2004) on my PC I saved. Many of those videos are large scale group fights between &lt;DiE&gt; &lt;Nurfed&gt; and other massively influential mmo guilds from the turn of the century. 
---
The highlight of many of those videos for me is seeing old spells and effects in place such as chains of ice, and particularly, TURN UNDEAD (paladin undead specific fear) working on forsaken players, priest shackle working on forsaken players etc. 
---
Alliance always outnumbered horde in my experience in real vanilla and it didn’t change until I experienced some of the more popular private servers.
---
my friend has gotten 2 lvl 60s and i am still 58.  we started at the same time.. the difference he streams and i work full time. :p no rush just enjoying the ride.
---
I wish Blizzard would hire better writers.  
---
   
---
Alliance looks boring, weak and uninspiring. They are, simply, not cool.  
---
    
---
While Horde has slightly better PvP racials, Alliance has better PvE racials.  This somehow hasn’t prevented Horde guilds from having most world first progression kills since Vanilla launched.  
---
     
---
Instead of offering faction specific server transfers for the fifteenth year in a row, perhaps Blizzard should examine why one of their factions is the overwhelming favorite of retirees, stay at home moms and people who drive minivans. 
---
Fifteen years ago, after beta ended (I was in phase 2) and Vanilla launched, I immediately noticed that nearly all the young guys I knew from years of Quake, Counter Strike and Unreal Tournament had rolled Horde characters.  Dozens of guys with thousands of hours each playing team shooters with voice chat and high levels of coordination.  Alliance appealed to middle aged women who read Piers Anthony fantasy novels.  
---
And boy did it show when Battlegrounds were added to the game.  And again when several websites started tracking raid boss downs. 
---
Blizzard, make Alliance cool.  Alliance is currently an accountant in a sweater and brown leather shoes.  Exciting as warm milk.  
---
Alliance needs to get ripped and get some aggressive tats. 
---
# MakeAllianceNotForCasuals
---
Yes this addon is cheating in my book.
---
why is paladin superior to shaman?
---
Op hasn't quite figured out supply and demand.  Some say he never will.
---
Zandalar tribe is balanced i think, but more on the alliance side
---
Lmao the name is edgie.

#**&lt;Tribute&gt;**
---
Horde | Whitemane (PvP-PST) | Wed/Thu 8pm-11:30pm PST | Semi-hardcore | Loot council
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
This isn't the greatest guild in the world, no. This is just a &lt;Tribute&gt;. Ohhh, whoah, ah-whoah-oh! :)  
---
Our main goal for **&lt;Tribute&gt;** is to foster a fun gaming community of like-minded and social players who put the needs and success of the team above their own. Our raids are relaxed, but focused - we get shit done. We prioritize loot and invites with the goal of gearing up efficiently, clearing content swiftly, and no drama. We're all adults here and many of us have families and/or demanding careers, so we want to be strategic in getting the most out of our game time. We think having fun with friends is critical to the overall success of the guild, and host "Game Nights" once every 4-6 weeks or so; Game Night normally includes some form of intoxication and free online games like Cards Against Humanity, Jackbox Games, etc.  
---
**Expectations**
---
We'll expect you to bring your best, strive to be knowledgeable about your class, never be afraid to ask questions, accept and give feedback graciously, improve the experience of the team, and be social &amp; have fun. If you like our philosophy and want to be part of our team, then read on. Even if you aren't interested in raiding, social members that fit with our culture are always welcome to join and hang out, level, PvP, and/or farm with us.  
---
**Raid schedule**
---
Our regular raid times are Wednesday and Thursday from 8:00pm-11:30pm PST (ends earlier on farm nights). This means we start pulling at 8:00pm so you'll need to be online, at the instance, with consumes, ready to go by 7:45pm. We will have other guild events such as group farming , PvP, 20-mans, old 40-man content, and/or GDKP runs on Saturdays. Our loot system is described in more detail on our discord.  
---
Interested?
---
Please join our discord at https://discord.gg/yZfrb8S, read things, and chat with us!
---
truth.. this is my first time ever playing alliance and everything is so different in a good way compared to horde.  a lot of fun
---
It’s an old pasta sir, but it checks out.
---
The other person said yes to this question, but then kind of went against that. The correct answer is no, it will not stand in place. Curse of recklessness overrides the fear and it acts as if it isn't feared, and it will run towards you to attack or shoot you or whatever it normally does. The fear debuff stays on, so you can curse of agony rank 1 or whatever as it gets closer, and it will get feared again as long as the fear debuff is still on it.
---
bunch of dicks, nothing more
---
Do /join lookingforgroup all servers have a built in LFG channel so you can find groups for any dungeon / raids / quests
---
What if they\`re spelladin?
---
"RP servers may not be perfect, but at least I don't need to build a wall to keep my players in."
---
I feel like most MC groups should have at least a 3rd or 4th person who CAN tank.
---
Not even an hour faster :) Non-speed clear raids take roughly 40min, and that's without the expensive flasks!
---
You tell whoever got the head during you last ony to pop it before MC.
---
eggplant emoji
---
trust me, you want to go to where the action is.  Ganking farmers, green levelers, or anyone who isn't interested in ranking won't cut it and you'll come up short every week in your bracket.
---
That’s minimum 2.5 hours a day. ANYTHING in your life that you can commit 2.5 hours every single day to that is not a basic necessity is a “dedication.” Doesn’t matter if it’s sports, reading, games, whatever
---
Hence “hardcore.”
---
&gt;But it’s ~~more a combo of~~ loot council ~~rolls~~.
---
FTFY
---
That's on you, man. You're not the only person that wants to shift between servers freely-neely.
---
oh my fucking god stop telling people how the fuck to play. This shit is annoying af. Tue leveling experience is fucking boring as fuck and every single one of you will realize that once you get to 60. If youre not 60 by now, you deserve to get camped. The math was done prior to release.. if you arent 60 yet.. you literally should not be playing an MMO. You casual scrubs are why retail is the way it is because you DEMAMD everyone wait for your slow ass to finish "the best part of the game" which is an entirely objectively based opinion. Get to 60 and tell me that you want to roll ANOTHER character after the first one took you 3 months to cap... guaranteed 99% of you will say "fuck that" and join the rest of us with "fuck the leveling experience". You people are just mad that you are straight trash at this game.
---
25s in my server is one of the cheapest useful herbs, Strangekelp being the cheapest for 17s.
---
I've been in super guilds on retail before and you mostly just end up finding a clique to run with and ignoring the fact that the rest of the guild exists.
---
When you say blundered you mean Blindweed, right? I know it's not hard to get but i was wondering if it will go down in price.
---
I'd guess less than 1% of characters have fishing over level 100
---
You forgot the last pane - people bitching about repetitive topics
---
Happy to remove this post at your request. I see there's a conflict of interest for your team to provide the best user experience whilst simultaneously monetizing it. Our intentions had the best interests of the users at heart. I hope your team can eventually determine other ways to make a satisfactory amount of money to the point where you can provide the broader community with the choice for an optimal experience when using your guides - ideally both at the same time.
---
Got kang to drop and I won the roll, sold it for 80g. Had moonbag recipe that I sold for 60g. And some random stuffs 30-50g
---
Of course, if your using a single hybernate to reset (in which case you should shift dodge it and continue pressure) but if the druid is just auto attacking and hybernating when you shapeshift, like the one above suggested, then you should just eat the hybernate and continue attacking in cat every time it breaks. The stratagey suggested is pretty silly.
---
Good luck getting them to fix it though :/
---
Track humanoids tells you where the players are. Spy doesn't, it just tells you that there's someone nearby. You can't tell if they're running away from you, running towards you, walking on a road, standing still. Tracking does that. You can guess someone's intentions just by looking at their position.
---
And yeah, obviously it doesn't make a difference somewhere like shimmering flats where there's no cover and a clear line of sight in any direction, but there are a ton of zones with cover everywhere and terrain that prevents you from looking in all directions. Tracking is still strong.
---
Drop tailoring for a better profession
---
Wow this is big !! I didn’t know that was coming too
---
Sounds like you and your guildies play for the pixels.  Classic has much more longevity when you play for the people.
---
You'd guess wrong.
---
It will immediately stop running in fear and come at you through its normal aggro style (run at you if melee, start casting if caster mob)
---
The trick is that the fear Debuff stays on it and if you re-cast another curse of any kind other than recklessness, it will begin to run in fear again
---
It might not be a bug, or even a thing. I need some other people to check their own logs and help confirm it first.
---
They should add some option to pledge a transfer, which will only go thu if enough people also pledge and it would pretty much fix a lot of imbalances. Right now people don't want to transfer as if they transfer and not many people follow then they will be outnumbered. With pledge system players would be guaranteed that their transfer request will go thru only if enough people from this faction also request transfer.   
---
I am actually amazed how great this idea of mine is lol.
---
There is nothing to: struggle, grow, learn, get better, or become a team on, in classic. Much less phase 1.
---

---
Way to take a joke seriously.
---
I put 1k gold on your guild thinking you're a fucking idiot lol
---
I'm healing coordinator. I didn't realize who the tanks were on that took Golemagg. Set healers on the maintanks and some on the next tank but none on the guy that took one of the dogs. Everybody followed and the guy died without a single heal. 
---
I also didn't know you had to dispell stuff on gehennas. Put all the priests as tank heals. Everyone died. One priest tells me "Ya know, usually priests dispell on this boss".
---
Get the addon. It's free and takes 20 seconds to setup.
---
That's the fucking stupid part. The allies left to go to heartseeker making that server super imbalanced and amplifying the imbalance on stalagg. Overall blizz needs to step in and adjust the levels somehow. We need more allies back on stalagg and they need less on heartseeker. What a mess, and right before w PvP.
---
They blocked transfers for alliance and alliance is so much more on Heartseeker than Stallag exactly for this reason. Because the majority of Alliance left or was about to.
---
LOL, I've literally had this exact same experience. Loot Council consist of guild master(Doesn't give a shit about loot just wants the guild to function well, loves being the leader) then class officers who all want the best pieces and distribute them to eachother while giving the sub-par trash loot to people that doesn't know any better/first time playing vanilla etc. If anyone whines about loot they are called lootwhores and how raiding is about "The social aspect" whilst taking all the best pieces and reserving top items for themselves. The guild master accepts this because they are after all the people that stay in the guild and become core members, however he doesn't realize that it's not because they are "All in it for the guild" but rather because they get all the good shit and other people leave the guild because they get nothing.
---
Bummer.
---
Would be nice if blizzard would give us the population of each fraction in the server. Maybe us as the player could help balance it if they did. I would rather play on a server that horde isn’t majority or close to 50 50, and I play horde btw.
---
dude you should be at Bay of storms it's waaaaaaaay better.
---
Care to explain how you came to the conclusion that the economy would collapse? I'm open to your take on realm price parity.
---
Make the min bid 1 dkp, and give 20ish each raid - you’ll never DE upgrades again
---
How often do righteous orbs drop per run? (I know the drop rate per mob, asking per dungeon)
---
That macro worked for like a week in Vanilla.
---
No I commented to mock you for not understanding supply and demand.  Now I'm mocking you for poor reading comprehension.  I can see why you're struggling on the ah.
---
is he a real person or just a bot? 
---
also can only horde see what horde type in general chat and some as alliance? what faction is you and the boatman.
---
Most people mention DKP and Loot council but does anyone have experience with Suicide Kings? 
---
Our guild has just started running MC/ONY and we’re using it. So far it’s working ok. No dramas around the system as yet but very early on. 
---
It seems like a fair system because it rewards people for showing up as well as letting people pick and choose what they wish to acquire.
---
We do morph it with some partial loot council (legendary items and tank priorities as well as main spec/off spec priorities).
---
I dont get why people try to camp one location, there are 8 spawn points in Burning Steppes
---
Yes I edited it since clearly it was confusing.
---
Why would you want to go back?  That's like beating cancer then going back to the carpet store.
---
Head over to the CSGO sub, it's trotted out near daily.
---
Try playing a rogue, stunning an orc and come back with your findings.
---
Are you fucking kidding me? What kind of doucebag response is that? I'm going to use your car to uber people around because calling you up for a free ride was too inconvenient. Oh, I also didn't tell you.
---
Lolllllllll that thread is a fucking salt mine
---
Use Google picture in picture. I place a small Netflix screen on top of my wow next to my bobber and it keeps my focus towards the bobber while simultaneously watching movies. Easy way to grind it out bro!
---
It’s worth it at some points in MC. But for the rest of Vanilla raiding you will always want poisons.
---
Fair enough. Care to explain your take on suuply and demand and how the inherent suuply and demand dynamic affects the above?
---
he was very clearly joking
---
People want to play and get the gear they want, they don’t want officers telling them what gear they need. If you’re need to “maximize value” for MC, you’re doing something wrong
---
I'm alliance, I need to transfer to herod to play with friends, started on blameox to avoid air times,  will this ever be possible?
---
Yeah it's got me. Everyone on this sub talks about being too many mages and so on, but I'm spending a fortune on water in dungeons without them. Can't tell you how good LBRS is with three warlocks.
---
"what kept the lights on before your current job, just go back to that"
---
Why would you go back though?  That's like beating cancer then going back to the carpet store.
---
You underestimate how many people will be doing the same thing as you. There will be hundreds of players on every server doing the exact same thing as they all know what will be in demand. The market will be flooded
---
48 is green for level 60 players. For NPCs at least, maybe it's different for players
---
spy does that too, but you need to have track humanoid (hunter/druid), once it sees a player, it puts a mark
---
One of the rare people on Reddit who knows the difference between libel and slander.  Well done
---
No?  If your guild uses loot council, pugs are really hard to accommodate.
---
Not hard to be number 1 when there is about 3 of them.
---
overreacting to phase 2 and "never be able to level again"  
---
that's what they said about STV leveling too, and ya made it past that didn't ya
---
hehe XD
---
I have a horde main on Thunderfury and it's mostly even, with horde slightly more.  However, I made an alliance character on Grobbulus, the RPPVP realm, and it's been tons of fun.  Lots of people, even balance, it's a server that has personality in spades.
---
Except the [Spy](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/spy-classic) which was already mentioned, I use:
---
* [BigDebuffs](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/bigdebuffs) \-  unit frame portraits will be replaced with debuff durations (check the screenshots)
---
* [ClassicAuraDurations](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/classicauradurations) \- shows a lot of durations, most important: your enemy aura durations
---
* [H.H.T.D](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/h-h-t-d) \-  "*healers have to die"*
---
* [OmniBar](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/omnibar) \- shows your enemy CDs (like counterspell, vanish, retaliation, cold snap, etc..)
---
Thats why I hate this game. Especially now that i'm lvl 57 and have completely run out of quests. (except dungeon quest but I dont do dungeons). So probably gonna have to grind mobs for 3 level..
---
It’s a program that shows pixel alterations, which means there’s a big chance that the image is edited by op.
---
DPS being bad is my guess. If you can't do the AoE strat and don't have the locks needed you need to be careful on the pull - MT goes in using Shield Wall and then all the OT's, which will mostly be DPS with a shield, grab their targets and pull them away.
---
Problem is that the DPS refuse to wait at the best of times, forget when people who aren't tanks and aren't specced or geared as tanks are doing the tanking. They explode on everything, shit runs around murdering them all and then the healers, there's a wipe.
---
Saw exactly that wipe a raid for an hour, with the raid leader just about screaming for the DPS not to start until called and being ignored every time. The kicker was that of course it was those DPS that started going "fuck this" and dropping out when literally all that was needed was for them to wait for the fight to get under control before they started.
---
Thankfully my guilds DPS listens. Sometimes.
---
Guilds without enough 60s to do full guild raids aren’t going to loot council lmao
---
How about that shaman solo healing the whole thing.
---
Number of horde transfers: zero.
---
It should be, but some people don't for whatever reason.
---
yeah the editing was a bit much i can't watch this shit
---
its mc like not really a big fucking deal
---
nah cuz u get diminishing returns
---
Yeah 1300hp for 150 spell damage . Worth it
---
Prior to the game coming out the community trended heavily towards private server power gamers that had some very severe opinions about playing the game, it makes sense because they were discussing a 15 year old game that didn’t come out for another year so of course enthusiasts dominated the demographic. Having browsed the subreddit since the game was announced, the change in discussion and opinion compared to now is dramatic. You will still see it on some comments here, like mage, priest, and warrior being the only classes worth playing, Druids are only useful for wsg flag, engineering is the only useful profession, #nochanges for any reason ever, shit like that. Their domination of the early community discussion pushed people towards min maxing, which favored horde. 
---
On release and especially for pvp servers, alliance would start out outnumbered and get dominated in contested leveling zones just due to their slightly smaller population. The difficult leveling due to ganking would cause players to drop off, creating a snowball effect which continually got worse. Blizzard lets the issue continue despite there being several easily implementable solutions like faction queues and targeted realm transfers.
---
lol what, my guild was horde stalagg from the launch
---
This comment has me reconsidering. Will be a shit show, but a lot of fun and won't happen again. Then again I'm 51 soooo......

The other day I ran Scholo twice with guildies, both times an Elemental Mage Staff dropped, along with my supreme power, plus an Epic robe pattern.

RNG has been good to my guild this week. I finally got my baron Cape and windreaver greaves today too.

Yeah, I tried a scripting macro like this with no luck either. I was unable to come up with, or find, a decent solution.
---
...surely they've proved by now they're listening to the community feedback?
---
Heartseeker
---
Because theres only 1 raid (and ony) that usually takes an hour to clear once a week. P1 doesn't have much going on, its the time to work on yourself and your professions/alts
---
before long you'll be swamped with many raids per week
---
we have like 8 mages, and lucky if we have 2 locks show up.
---
how long did it take to get all of those ?
---
I’m honestly surprised, I’m here all the time (basically constantly) and hate frequent reposts but I haven’t seen this one yet. Guess I just need to reddit even more haha.
---
The assertion that the majority of day 1 subs are still playing is absurd. Look at your friends list. Notice how many people have not logged on in months. There was queues after servers were expanded. They went down because people quit. Layers are gona from most servers that used to have queues. It isnt super packed out.
---
Its not a shocking revelation. Blizzard knew they would quit and its why they did the release the way they did.
---
Smoke weed
---
QQ more.
---
Leveled rogue just fine, never grinded and never ran out of quests, idk
---
i give it 10 mins after maintenance before everyones on crying about the queues when people won't even realize honor system still isn't even in the game yet.
---
Hahah thank you for that. I love that show. I started watching all sorts of these old shows at my uncles when he only had an antenna. Hogan's Heroes and Gomer Pyle were amazing.
---
I don't recall that being a thing in vanilla.
---
I fished from like 7 am until 3 PM but it was casual while watching Netflix and working answering emails and such. Also, double the rainbow albacore caught as they are more common and will fill up your bags.
---
&gt; The entire spark that started this conversation was how the original post above pointed out how impossible it was for alliance players to even find the fucking npc to continue the quest chain
---
Yeah and my point was that if you have no outside resources yeah the alliance is harder, people have to figure out how to find that NPC, what to do in BRD with finding the note, doing the escort right, not starting the Windsor follow up right away, etc. Today in classic and for almost everyone after the first wave in vanilla you can look it up if you hit a road block, it's really not that hard. I've played alliance and horde and I think 99.9% of others who have would say that most differences are pretty negligible in the big picture
---
Yeah, I'm reading more of the responses that came in while I was away. Reminds of that saying "If you smell dog shit everywhere you go, look under your own shoe".
---
we have 5min bet and 15 dkp per week in total.
---
Only thinking about what piece they are gonna get and not playing for the people/environment is a good way to burn out
---
Imagine thinking they changed it cause of a reddit post. What a fking moron
---
Most popular faction on the  biggest server with the coolest name?
---
With the big streamers going alliance on another server?
---
Herod was doomed from the start
---
As most people have said level 30 is the breaking point. Staying up to date with your weapon is a must, highly recommend doing Arms until you get to lvl 55+ AND two "end-game" 1 handers.  It doesn't need to be an alt, I did my WW Axe quest at 30 by asking in LFG/Zone chat for help, there are plenty of people who are willing to help you out.  
---
No matter the weapon though knowing how to stance dance and using your skills will be supremely helpful. Pulling 2+ mobs and doing Sweeping into a cleave will make the cleave "bounce" same with whirlwind. If you plan on lvling through dungeoning, I would consider getting 5/5 Axe and then going to Fury tree for 5/5 Cruelty.
---
Of course not, I was just making a generalization
---
You're not wrong, but damn do I miss my dwarf. Stoneform is pretty awesome
---
And people still won’t bid 5 on upgrades? That’s surprising
---
Classic has been out for 77 days, and let's say you play every other night 3-4 hours. That's 5 or 6 days played time so far, which would put you in hardcore professional speed leveling territory, especially as a warrior.
---
bg's will come out in 3 weeks because kids gonna cry that world is overfarmed and unplayable
---
A lvl 60 attacking a lvl 48 is not considered a dishonorable kill?!? I thought the spread was going to be much smaller. Like 60 to 55 or something.
---
Heartseeker is around 20ish percent horde.  Good community though.
---
That demon was like  "i'm here with my Boi!S!S!"
---
just run aoe spellcleave if not gl hitting 60 in time for any guild to need ya
---
Its a @2 year timespan for vanilla, there's going to be slow times with nothing much to do
---
The mana remnants in Immolthar room (DM:W) can be kited forever around the pillars. They'll just turn around and around again.
---
Meanwhile, LoS'ing Zevrim Sacrifice in DM:E sometimes goes through the wall.
---
With DM:N Ogres Dances and ramps exploits, we have a pretty broken Dire Maul.
---
Pretty sure its within 20% of your level - same as with getting experience from monsters
---
this is the dumbest thing I read all day
---
Complexity doesn't equal fun
---
That would decimate raid logging.
---
Several commentators complained they would have no way to play with guildies who got split up. Now there is a way. 
---
Blizzards intention was that nobody on the Alliance could transfer. The people who got through were just lucky that it was bugged for a bit.
---
Nobody knows except Blizzard
---
No, you. Blizzard obviously shares my ideology (the most logical and correct one) judging you  their actions. :)
---
when you have a healer with you
---
No surveys or anything ?
---
He did roll need on them btw, we let him have them

There will never be a serious wall lol.

they are, horde racials are incredibly stupidly overpowered in pvp in vanilla.
---
UD and orcs are just too good.
---
k
---
My YouTube playlist
---
... go on? that's quite vague.
---
I looked at it. It has a delay. Your trap button should light up the instant you press Feign Death. If you were fighting a mob that attacks fast you'd be put in combat.
---
Nice! Now level to 43-45 and go get your carrot on a stick and make those babies zoom.
---
Well not really you can do Naxxramas and AQ without [them. ](https://them.It)
---
[It](https://them.It) was a thing 15 years ago because we knew so few about mechanics and itemization, but now with BiS and engineering, everything is pretty trivialized.
---
Can confirm you are doing 0 work when fishing. Netflix is fine but no work.
---
What why
---
I just hit 43. Made the last of the gold aoeing ZF

You're thinking of runecloth bag, not mooncloth.
---
Nothing is ever "unplayable" and that word gets used way too much in this sub
---
Noones clearing in 40 mins without buffs
---
but horde can say this haha
---
Again, no?  You can clear MC with 30 people.  You can kill Ony with 20.  That still has loot council.
---
Minus my very first character, I’ve basically always played on pvp servers. Most of my best stories come from Wpvp moments
---
Examples from vanilla days 
---
-As a warrior, shooting a ?? (10+ higher level than me) rogue with my bow for the killing blow after he auto attacked my retaliation then sprinted away
---
-getting murdered in Hillsbrad by the infamous gankers Starsky &amp; Hutch
---
-going straight drakedog in a 3v1 on my warlock and barely winning 
---
On a pve server, I would’ve missed so many stories I still remember to this day.
---
&gt; What are you seeking in this post if you’re just going to shit on anyone who took the time to try to help? 
---
No one tried to help. They're posting stuff I already know, particularly that macro that doesn't actually fix the issue.. the delay.
---
&gt;Playing with you must be a joy.
---
Well I raid with some 70 other people and we're the top Horde guild on Golemagg so yeah it's quite alright
---
I'm well aware.
---
62 runs and still going  without a single mh drop.
---
They can put themselves in a better position to kill me again with Spy. Yeah they could use a macro, but most people don't bother putting in that kind of effort.
---
Let's take into account the two most important things - realm pop, and a realm (possibly) having a huge faction imbalance.  
---
If your realm has a low population, or if it has a large faction imbalance, it'll be _way_ easier for a specific group of people to farm expensive items, such as mats or rare BoEs, compared to a realm with a high population or an even faction balance. Especially since layers are being removed soon on these higher population realms and we can expect there to be pretty much double the competiton for everything farmable outside of an instance.     
---
It's all about supply and demand. Suppose there is a global, faction-neutral AH. Those with an advantage (low pop realms, severe faction imbalance) will be able to farm items with extreme ease. These people will have the largest supply of those items.
---
Those on larger realms will be stuck competing for resources &amp; items, while those on low-pop realms will be the ones making all of the gold and controlling the markets. Prices will inflate, and everybody will need to pay more.  
---
Does that seem fair to you?
---
My guild, all dark iron and all firey cores all boes all scales all core leather goes to the guild bank. I have never played in a guild that lets you just take stuff found in MC beyond epic loot.
---
I was surprised too. The game itself appeared to be 100% TCP.  Would test again but no longer have the game.
---
Am I serious about what?
---
You don't have to be to be miserable spending 3 hours to kill 4 bosses lol
---
Won't happen
---
There gave never been transfers from pve to pvp servers and it's unlikely there ever will be.
---
Not in Sulfuras
---
I tried making some big voodoo leather to earn money for a mount but it won't sell, so now I'm 46 with 20g, lol.
---
Kids are already crying about it.
---
Is the system down? No? Then he's doing his goddamn job
---
"My fee for tanking this btw."
---
Yeah, 3-4 weeks is more than enough time with just mass wPVP.  Gets boring fast.
---
Im so glad I rolled horde
---
Favorite line.... "so I wanted to see if he was a decent pally or a bot"
---
Good joke
---
Or because they have other things in their life besides a 15 year old game.
---
First 3×77÷24=9.6 Days 4x77÷24=12.8Days So its from 9.6 till 12.8 Days /played. so your match dont check out. 
---
2nd hardcore speedlevelers ar going for 3days /played. or less
---
3rd. 12days /played was your avrage lvling time in vanilla when people didnt know shit.9days was viewed as fast. today 12days played to hit 60 is pretty slow tbh
---
guys awful.
---
Are you me?
---
It was confirmed by blizzard that when a roll is tied an internal hidden roll takes place until a winner is decided. It is not a truncated decimal.
---
Left was our warriors gloves and right was what dropped. Never seen two stat rolls of the same type and level having different weights.
---
yeah from afk botting AV
---
380 isn't almost BIS atm. I'm at 442 with only the sash of whisperers from MC.
---
dude. the difference is nearly non existent.  you gotta be kidding me... 
---
less than a quarter second delay IF that.  I just worked a 60 orc war in winterspring that tried to gank me.  feign trapped twice. not an issue.   
---
now that 3-4 second shit you experienced in your video. that's an issue.
---
Ah yes, you managed to get 600 stacks of runecloth, but are yet to learn how to take a screenshot.
---
It’s pretty miserable as an ally on skeram
---
Level 36-40 SM gear too!
---
Priesrs are ez mode solo. And in some aspects faster than others by a lot
---
Yes all "of the ____" roll 0-2 different.
---
For example a 29 helm may have the stats of
---
+8
---
Or
---
+9
---
What class!?
---
.
---
Any tips?
---
Did you follow a guide?
---
I'm at 48 and have finished stv, tanaris and most of feralas. I'm feeling disheartened.
---
Slowing down is what you need to do, and I said give the pet a threat lead. We are presenting solutions. There is no way they change vanilla to fit hunters, so you have to work around it.
---
The unit frames are not an addon. That's just turning on raid frames in the settings.
---
Underworld band dropped in a recent dungeon run. Had a warlock in the party who asked if he could take to wear and we told him upgrades take prio over gold and to take it. Dude equipped it on the spot. Think we were in Uldaman. Otherwise had a couple of the lesser BoE blues drop in sfk worth 3-5g.
---
I didn't call them coincidences I said it's crazy how much overlap they have.  Like it's not just the looks it's names, abilities, even more thematic things like personalities.  Super crazy
---
It took me 4 of those to get strength and stamina and now I find out there's a better version??
---
You can also play 2hand fury and be far more effective
---
Where can you see this info?
---
Grobbulus tri-killed house leads as well.
---
I'm definitely feeling the same thing. I'm only level 45 right now and I'm worried the PvP will slow me down so much I will just burn out. We'll see though. For all the frustration I find the dynamics and drama of PvP servers infinitely more compelling than pve. I hope I can make it to 60 in a reasonable amount of time so I can be part of the chaos.
---
You could change the sound of the fish bites to something more recognizable.
---
Why are you not saying what level you are? It’s not weird if you aren’t the right level. If you are too low and they invited you then this isn’t strange at all and they were trying to do you a favor.
---
No one tried to help? More like you’re refusing any help. But you do you my bro. Hope you’re able to work around the bug or whatever.
---
This was a great advertisement. Never heard of this but am installing it as we speak. Thanks!
---
You play a Paladin, not a ret Paladin. In classic you play the class, not the spec. You will be healing in raids.
---
You actually spam hamstring as horde with wf, slam spec is for alliance 2hand fury, just a heads up
---
It's not crazy dude. Maybe you should goodle for DotA, or better said, Defense of the Ancients.
---
Watch yer back
---
Those gloves have a random roll on stats, there from ZF first boss in the cave. Mine rolled attack power.
---
Wisp Spirit is the most important Alliance racial on many servers..
---
You may not have won Brain Hacker, but you Bed Hacker.
---
Alliance clearly has an advantage in PVE and a humongous advantage  in AV as far as PVP goes, although the undead racial is very good outside of that.
---
I played wc3 dota I understand fully why it is this way.
---
At this point if they arn't 60 they shouldn't be in the raid.  This isn't the first week of classic, alts and lowbies need to not be carried.
---
Why is SM:Ruin outdated?
---
It is horrendous.  I have spoken to around 50 alliance to ask what they thought and every single person I've talked to agrees it is at least a 60 40 split toward horde.  Most think it's far worse than that with about half of the people I've polled saying it feels more like 80 20.
---
Good job man. How do you find time? If I had money to keep playing I couldn't really find the time to justify playing.
---
Jesus takes like this make me so mad.
---
Alliance racials are better.
---
Paladins are WAY better.
---
Alliance is WAY better in PvE, and definitely better in PvP. This is objective reality - the evidence is everywhere, from warcraftlogs to eons of PvP ranking.
---
Small dick syndrome
---
Brings a tear to my eye. Simply beautiful.
---
@ 60 its 12 it is a % based on your lvl so a 60 gets honor for 48-60 chars
---
Love how hypocritical people in this sub are. 
---
Everyone bitched and moaned about needing faction xfers and then it happens and they're REEEEEing that blizzard didn't tell them ahead of time...so they couldn't prepare to jump ship sooner. 
---
The main reason why Heartseeker is even a problem is because of Herod Alliance refugees.
---
Why would you transfer away from stalagg?
---
You prob missed the part where he said it wasn't on the automatic restore, but keep spouting non sense that works too
---
what addon is this that shows you the list of items you’ve vendored?
---
This video got me chill, you can't get this kinda contents from retail, I fucking love classic, man.
---
I'm an Alliance myself, but fuck it, FOR THE HORDE!
---
How does this affect them? You wanted to xfer as a group off of a server, now you cant, oh well you are still together. If you're part of the faction that can xfer, you can still xfer as a group
---
Blizzard told people to play on Skeram and then let all the alliance transfer off, all my hours and hours wasted that could have been on a better server.
---
What's so bad about Stalagg?
---
As if there aren't a dozen things you could automate in any IT job if you actually worked instead of playing video games/watching TV. People like OP will eventually be replaced by someone willing to work harder. Population growth and barriers to entry falling away guarantee this in our kids' lifetimes, if not within ours.
---
Death\* comes at you fast.
---
It is my understanding that the death penalty, for slander, is being considered for Horvla. I am not a supporter of the death penalty and take no joy in reporting this.
---
ok go play alliance on it
---
I’m on dreadmist as alliance and I’ll have the option to move to earthbinder. Shall I do it? I’ve been hearing good things about the realm. Dreadmist feels massively horde favoured and with phase 2 coming along I don’t wanna be around
---
YKTV is recruiting for there second raid team raid times are Wednesday 730-11 and Sunday 730-11 
---
All applicants will be taken. But are in dire need of warlocks hunters preists and shaman. 
---
We also will be doing world pvp. 
---
If you are interested please message me on discord @ Kilmanjaro#8654. 
---
We are a fun guild with an active discord with a plethera of guildies willing to do content for BiS. Gold farming etc. Please if your interested message me on discord.
---
&gt; they would rather play as 7 on a different server 
---
"friends", lol.
---
Ehhh yeah but tbh they can be fun leveling solo. I dont agree
---
You wont have problem finding dungeon groups. Your healing and mana sustain usually helps reduce downtime in dungeons and leads to finishing quickly. You pair well with every class. 
---
In world questing you can take on a lot of mobs at once because of spirit tap. You don't have aoe but most classes dont. Opposing players of your level range mess with you in world pvp because spriests usually win 1v1 easily as they get their best abilities early.
---
Honestly priests are very fun. And every class is boring 2-3 button spam when you come down to it.
---
Grobbulus is overpoblated, seems a good realm but with a little toxiticy, im in Deviate Deligth and is like a Minor versión, not many people but the comunity is awesome
---
It wasn't lucky when they didn't announce it was faction specific for that long.
---
Problem was just blizzard being blizzard.
---
Ah that's fucking cool dide
---
I too get things like this when I /reload
---
well ackshually it was false capitalist propaganda, not the realities of communist life, that led to people wanting to leave the soviet bloc  so these dumb alliance should be grateful to papa blizzard for giving them the opportunity to return to the meatgrinder
---
Bad meme usage boomer
---
They aren't our warrior DPS though. Zarcy is prot and Doughty was in Kalimdor looking for Rexxar.
---
Y'all are soft. For the horde
---
Because a lot of melee single target gets increased with more mobs there.
---
I had healing gloves drop with a modifer of +49 to healing in ST. Wasnt in atlas loot and no one i talkwd to even seen that before. So doesnt surprise me that this can vary
---
It’s 10pm Server Time.  Do YOU know where your guild bank is?
---
Giving this belt to a ret pala is just wrong
---
I leveled fishing while playing mtga.
---
Pretty sure this is just satire
---
You must have not noticed the /s. It's a joke about paranoia.
---
Make a shitton of flasks
---
Ok boomer
---
“Look I rolled a crazy number on a rare item!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!”
---
Oh wow. That's a lot of Ubers. Haha. How cool. I would soooooooo use that to get from content to content, jumping between instance locations.
---
This is a multiboxer's true purpose. Thanks for the idea.
---
Right? The whole sTrEaMeRs BaD thing is insane on this sub.
---
Don't. Every Alliance on Whitemane knows Hyperial sucks ass and is a total goober.
---
Good, get bent. Deserved it for trying to leave
---
What
---
Are you sure those aren’t the 3 gems that are used to summon 3 black drakes in the badlands for a quest?
---
Wooo grobb mob! I absolutely love how many Alliance are into wpvp on this server. Brings a tear to my eye!
---
You don't need to pvp that much.
---
You only need 150 1v1 kills a week to max rating points per week.  That's about 21 full honor kills a day(no shared kills, no lowbies).  Could be reached in a couple hours a day.  You get a max of 15,000 Rating points a week, then a 10% weekly decay.  
---
If you get 15,000 first week you'll be up to mid lvl rank 5 week 1.  Then week 2 if you get another 15,000, you'll be sitting at 27,000 rating points.  
---
If there was no decay, you'd be able to make to rank 8 @30,000 RP, but rank 7 at 25,000.
---
(15,000+15,000) *0.9 = 27,000
---

---
What time? Level 15 takes about 4 hours. If you really haven’t had 4 hours to spend on relaxing/hobby since the end of August then you really, really have some problems with your life and need to seek help.
---
I'm not saying you're wrong but everything I can find says 10lvls lower at lvl60. Can you link me the right info?
---
We have four of us doing it. Grorth, Blizbee, Will and Myself :D
---
We're on a roleplay server :3
---
And I hope the weekly threads about this garbage addon will make it happen.
---
For sure, I would say 3 dedicated tanks and 1 flex dps/tank.
---
It’s your attitude. Maybe instead of cowering, you could appreciate that you have actual peoplt to kill. Fucking all the allis that transferred off ruined pvp for the server
---
Cringe.
---
5Head addon. Gonna look into this.
---
Brought tears to my processor, too. The bad kind.
---
I know a solid 50% of people on my friends list and guild roster bounced. I wouldn't be surprised at the 75% number at all.
---
Why don't they just delete a few of the imbalanced servers, take whichever faction that is outnumbering the other add them to a sever which needs that faction?  Don't let people choose, force them where they need to go.
---
Fel is an off hand, the crit proc is what you’re after. So it would still be handy as sword spec but I’d go and get a heart seeker and go full dagger. You always have the swords in the bank to swap back. That’s what I’d do until I got my Bis daggers from MC. I have both del rends and I’d rather be a dagger rogue
---
Curiously why use SotC over SoR?
---
Nope.
---
Spy detects any buffs or aura effects.
---
It can't be 50/50 - PvP server population leans to the H side, around 40/60 split. This leads to inherent imbalance, which then quickly snowballs once you allow server transfers. That's what happened back in Vanilla and is happening now.
---
Only in Classic there's very little reason for a serious PvP guild to transfer to a disadvantaged server. I've experienced it back in the day - a group of people who wanted instant BG queues transferred to our server and quickly put the fear of Jeff back into the horde. Now with cross-realm BGs there's no point in doing so.
---
Neat!
---
Jesus Christ just let people pay your bullshit price to switch wherever they want.
---
Dat luck...
---
Yeah, well maybe the horde on 70% Horde 30% Alliance servers should have thought of that BEFORE they camped every fucking alliance player in a 7v1 (or even worse, I’ve been 10v1ed too many times to count) if they wanted a true pvp experience, especially BEFORE phase 2 has even dropped. 
---
The alliance on the imbalanced servers will grow sick and tired of being camped in an outnumbered fight with literally NO chance to win and a large % of those alliance will transfer off/roll on a new server when they see how bad it gets in phase two. 
---
Why? Because being 10v1ed is not PVP. It does not take any skill set/strategic thought. There’s no room to outplay anybody because it’s a goddamn 10v1, or 5v1, or whatever variant that still is the same outcome: the horde outnumbering the alliance in a completely uneven fight and then camping their corpses for ages. Once the outnumbered alliance realize they can’t even play the fucking game because of how the Horde thing PVP is supposed to be, they’ll reroll/transfer. Personally, I’m on Alliance Fairbanks. We’re most likely a 65H/35A server, or even worse with the horde largely outnumbering the alliance. If all PVP is to the horde is literally picking fights where the enemy has no chance to win, there’s literally no point to playing on a PVP server. Especially cause you have 5 level 60 hordes attacking level 48-55 alliance. You might as well just go elsewhere and wait for battlegrounds because that’s an ACTUAL PVP experience with an even fight/has room for either team to outplay /outskill the other.
---
Then what’s gonna happen? These unbalanced servers will be 90% Horde 10% Alliance because all the Alliance quit/got sick of what people think WPVP is supposed to be. 
---
Horde: Shockedpikachu.face
---
If all world pvp is, is getting as many people as you can to severely outnumber and 10v1 the opposing faction- then there’s literally no point to WPVP. It’s just stupid at that point. And sadly, this is the case on MANY servers, especially ones where Alliance is grossly outnumbered; so it truly won’t surprise me when the Alliance quit/reroll. Finally, then the horde might realize they truly made it worse for themselves in the long run because they had their fun camping 2-3 peoples corpses in a 10v1 in the short term. 
---
Personally? I’m sick and tired of it, and I have 100% considered rerolling. My holy priest is level 53. I’ll gladly make an alt on a different server and still be able to PvP with battlegrounds. But, most likely case is I’ll make an alt on a different server and just wait for server transfers to open up on Fairbanks. The horde are literally just pests.
---
&gt;mage, priest, and warrior being the only classes worth playing...
---
Yeah, that sort of thing bothers me a bit. I'd love to see some numbers of a raid with only those classes, and then one that's more balanced. I feel like the more balanced raid that has things like WF totem, pally buffs, Warlocks that can summon, hunters that can mark and call DPS targets (not needed as much as classic does have raid markers), and rogues that can sap or disable the traps in UBRS, will have lower DPS overall perhaps but will still meet with success because they be more creative with how they handle things.
---
And not all of WoW endgame is 40 man raids. There are some fantastic dungeons, 10man raids, 20man raids, world bosses, and yes, even pvp. When you aren't up against the buff and debuff caps and the fights are shorter, some of the other specs can really shine. In enhance at level 45, I can out DPS mages and warlocks in Uldaman. Of course they might just suck as mages and warlocks, but that doesn't change the fact that I was doing well.
---
We get it... We just don't care.
---
Lol, I think you inspired folk on Deviate Delight too. They tried.. And we slew them.
---
I'm not home right now so I can't check. What severs and what faction is able to do transfers right now?
---
Aww not only are you a snowflake, but a triggered one.
---
A ret pally shouldn't even be in the raid. Might as well bring in a fresh lvl 55 whatever and carry them, cause that's what you're doing for the rest pally, carrying the fuck out of their shit dps ass.
---
Lol
---
Faction change is rough for guilds or friend groups. Odds are good that at least one person is a shaman or paladin, and then what do you do? Convert a paladin into a shaman? What about their gear?
---
I DEMAND MORE SKELETONS
---
There is a point if you want to make sure to have high playerbase to play with for the forseeable future. (If you play in the dominant factio)
---
Nobody in my guild wanted to take it, there was an actual debate on who would get it force looted to them.
---
It really is the future.
---
fuck off
---
\*cries in herod\*
---
Y-you too...
---
What's crazy about it then?
---
Yeah I'm hopeful too.  Pretty depressing running through neutral towns since I transferred to heartseeker with initial round.  I feel like the alliance on this server only engage when they have 2-3+ numbers, otherwise they don't want the fight.
---
Many of the indepth laptop reviews by tech websites do thermal testing as part of the review. When you find the laptop you're interested in Google reviews for that model and read a few in depth reviews that cover thermals. User reviews on shopping sites or ok to look for read flags if you see many many buyers complaining about heat or throttle
---
&gt; Any differences between what my UI shows and the video of the vanilla hunter you showed is probably just UI or general latency issues. 
---
No, it's spell batching.
---
I’ve seen a lot of people in pugs that really don’t understand vanilla threat. Some people really don’t get that it’s not retail, the tanks don’t just have threat naturally due to magical buffs that you always have up.
---
I won’t sugar coat it, it’s gonna be rough at times, especially if you are on the lower end of an unbalanced server, but that’s well known to be the case.  Most people aren’t focusing on the one time nature of the P2 circumstances, and I think that could make it a bit more positive.
---
Night Witches represent!!
---
Yep, on point. There's no point in worrying. The most active people on media are those who have all the time in the world to play, or are shirking their responsibilities.
---
Go at your pace and enjoy the adventure. Your guild may be killing MC bosses but if you're in the right guild that won't matter too much.
---
Interesting statistics.
---
But if you've got any experience playing AB, you're already looking at all of the roads around you. Sure, Spy might give you an advantage if, say, a rogue was swimming unstealthed around bs, farm or st to close in on the flag. In this case without spy you probably wouldn't have been looking at the water. Or maybe it'll help if you're not looking above you at bs or gm and someone slow falls down from lm or bs.
---
But imo it's not an insane advantage. The enemies are still coming at you and they'll still beat you whether you know they're coming or not. And someone experienced will 100% spot someone in AB, since there are usually only 2-3 ways you can approach a point, rogue or not. If a rogue really wants to be sneaky, they'll have to stealth outside the view distance of the point, because an experienced player will see them coming anyway.
---
Also the post I replied to says it's going to ruin flag def for stealth. Why ? Spy does not tell you someone is defending, unless they're sitting unstealthed, in which case it's on them.
---
I will agree on one thing : it sucks that non-stealth classes are now instantly detected by Spy even if they were sitting quietly behind a building to catch attackers off-guard. But the problem is not Spy, it's the combat log. On retail, enemies don't appear on the combat log unless they do something. You can't just approach a flag and instantly see who's defending unless they were casting stuff or getting healed by passive abilities. And I agree that they should change it so it works that way in classic.
---
Herod was doomed, but there is still no way for a player to gauge the server balance unless they don't play for a few weeks after launch and then pick by third party census data.
---
I picked Skeram at launch and found out the server pop was 70-30%ish. When the first round of transfers opened, it went 80-20. I stuck it out even then until the main cities were dead and the big guilds I remembered seeing from level 1-60 disappeared. I can only imagine how bad it is now. I feel bad contributing to the same issue on Heartseeker but I do enjoy playing the game I'm paying for.
---
This is the second most useful add on after auto dismount. 
---
As someone who haven’t played classic dungeons before it will be a big help for myself. Thanks a lot.
---
Gtfo, commie!
---
not an issue on fairbanks. never had it lag longer than a quarter second, never not been able to get the trap off. 
---
Sucks that it's such an issue on your server.
---
Man, too bad it doesnt matter since I doubt we're on the same server. Talk about a loaded bet.
---
Im confused. Are we talking about the same thing? I'm not sure if I'm misunderstanding you or if it's the other way around.
---
Let me attempt to address it from your pov. I'll address your first concern. I hypothesize that, undercutting items in the AH to a ridiculously low level , would result in a collapse of the AH economy because it would result in everyone being able to afford everything they wanted and thereby stagnate the AH with little to no activity resulting in an asymptotic activity level or purchasing. Ie flatlining the economy. The resultant effect of this, would lead to high levels of stocking. Re:farming, but very low levels of purchasing because evrrything has already been bought by those who have taken advantage of the undercutting epidemic.
---
The proposition I had put forward, was a bottom up method of dealing with undercutting, thereby bolstering competition. The consumer would buy items from the second cheapest vendor, eg if something was selling for 1g and something was selling for 2g, the person undercutting might be encouraged to stabilize his prices to 2g, because complementary administrative costs would have doubled, since he would have to put his stuff back up on the AH to get a sale. This would Hedge the problem of undercutting.
---
Secondly,in addressing your hi lo population servers in the context of pvp and pve server demographics, the prices on ally AH are mutually exclusive to horde AH and vice versa. Furthermore, the prices on one server are also mutually exclusive to another sever. Neither of these share an interaction with one another. They are free to set their own price levels. If a disadvantageous faction is overruled by a high population faction, they are free to set the costs of lotuses to whatever they want, 100g per, just  for the sake of hyperbole, whilst the other faction sells it for 1g. The problem I am addressing is like I said before, the price spread. Using the example of the lotuses, what's the point of depreciating the cost of 100g/u to let's say 70g for the sake of illustration ? That's a near 33% decrease. And this kind of drop in prices isn't felt on the same search page. There's often 3-5 pages of undercutting going on before u get to either of the extremes.
---
I hope I have answered your concern
---
Quests are fastest way x)
---
&gt; You're going out and putting yourself into PvP situations without PvP talents
---
Again, you clearly do not understand how rogues work.  Any of our talent trees are viable for PvP and stealth talents are not required for PvP at all.  They would not help in this situation either because stealth speed doesn't matter when someone is aware you are there, nor does stealth level.  When you have an addon that inherently makes our stealth opportunities objectively harder/worse, it makes the entire stealth ability worse.  Talents or not.
---
&gt;If you were sub, that add-on and perception and all the AOE spam in the world won't take you out of stealth
---
This is disingenuous and wrong.  The addon alerts you when you otherwise wouldn't know if you didn't see the rogue, therefore you have all of the ability and foresight to prevent that rogue from ever getting the opener on you.  You can also alert your 14 other allies in your raid so they are also on high alert, making it impossible and incredibly risky for that rogue to ever do anything to you or your raid.
---
Now if spy didn't exist, that party member would have to use his eyes and skill to make that callout, and that would be okay because that's how it should work anyways.
---
On one hand, yes, you’re doing nothing wrong if you decide to efficiently level and progress through the game. On the other hand, that’s the kind of mindset that people complain ruined retail. 
---
I’m personally somewhere in between and I’m really enjoying it. I have a 58 rogue and a 43 mage. When I level I like to level efficiently, but I also really like the ‘help each other out’ mentality that you see amongst players when they need help in a quest or are being ganked. I’ve also spent a lot of time trying out professions I’ve never tried before. I gotta say I really enjoy drinking a beer and fishing.
---
&gt; If you never want to pvp, why not go to a pve server?
---
Because you can enfore 95% one faction server on pvp, but you cannot on pve. If the realm is 60-40 on pve it is likely won’t change. But on pvp it will be one faction only. So you will have the highest number of available players to play with, even when people will start playing classic as much. Considering later raids might actually need 40 people, it is good to have a big playerbase
---
It isn't though. Playing on a PVE server removes the possibility of being corpse camped from the equation. You clearly have no semblance of a logical mind. If this guy is so triggered by the odd corpse camping then clearly PVP server is not for him. If he wants to stick it out for the other benefits a PVP server provides (generally higher pop, ability to kill rivals in farming area's) he can do that too.

It is always strange that there are some people commenting to topics who can’t comprehend there are different people with different problems. Just because a thousand people complained yesterday about something does not mean a thousand different people will not complain about the opposite tomorrow.
---
Awww dude that sucks. What server? H/a?
---
You are right my man
---
Time to go fury prot!
---
I play Alliance on Grobb and I'm confident, in all the pvp events I've participated in, that the Alliance guilds are a lot more organized. Faction balance is pretty even, but I feel like the Alliance RP harder about PvP.
---
We hit all the major cities at the exact same time, which would be hard for either faction to deal with. Especially because it doesn't seem like the Horde had any strong indication we were coming.
---
Does anyone have sources on server balance all around? All I have to go on are peoples testimonies here. 
---
And here everyone says their server is horde skewed. Will the help? If horde transfer to horde dominated servers?
---
Tool.
---
Lol  congrats. However, I thought this was the normal orc mount. Wouldn’t bat an eye at seeing this in game haha
---
Better solution is to just not show specific abilities from the opposing faction on the log. There's precedent for it. As OP mentioned, vanish doesn't show up.
---
&gt; Any of our talent trees are viable for PvP
---
Ridiculous. Go tell that to the god of vanilla PvP, Happyminti: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvQoYMq8_Ng
---
Tell me how many times he's PvPing as combat swords in that video. You are clueless and I'm done talking to you.
---
Why would you not just be on a PVE realm is my point. You can be on a high playerbase PVE realm anytime. There's plenty of them. Shit on retail, PVE realms are higher pop than most pvp realms. Well they were, guess its different now with BFA and pvp realms being gone but yeah
---
Nej :)
---
QS doesn't show enchants. It has it's own unique glow.
---
You can see debuffs on raid frames, though.. so this argument isn’t very good.
---
Yeah how dare what few allies remain on a pvp server engage in pvp. They should know they're grossly outnumbered and never engage and just play the game at the pleasure of the horde /s
---
I don’t understand how some of these fairly even servers at launch are now horrifically unbalanced. Do not roll on a PvP server if you don’t and tot PvP!
---
I can't believe they fucked it up again.  What an absolute shit show this whole Classic thing has been from top to bottom.
---
&gt;I felt that decision was way too harsh for missing one raid in a semi-hardcore guild. I work full time + grad school so I felt like fuck is this really how heavy they weigh attendance?
---
My main fear with raiding. Clinical rotations at school are very time consuming and they change every 4-6 weeks so my schedule is never consistent. Hate the idea of trying to settle in with a guild only to be given nothing because I can't be around perfectly.

No layering mate, streamed most of my farming. Was servers 2nd 60, so I could grab some of them while people were leveling.
---
yeah what server
---
Sometimes the officers do a little cleanup and kick everyone who is offline for more than X days could really just be an accident and you only have to wisper someone to be invited back.
---
Otherwise plenty of good guilds are looking for people for their second or third raidgroup, some even for the main raid dont give up
---
The military is largely a waste of my tax dollars.
---
Or.. you know, dont complain about pvp when you actively push for it. Which is my point. Alliance like to act as if theyre completely innocent when they are not.

Deadmines, too.

You should probably join a guild with more respect for their players' lives

If you are human, dual wield swords, if you are orc, dual wield axes. If you’re neither, best weapons you can find +edge master hand guards.

Sounds like a shit guild

Those only give you a very small percentage of the playerbase, and it offers nothing of value except the weighting of players that visit reddit/use an addon or whatever else.

everyone targets you immediately in any engagement, so you need survival.

druids can escape movement reductions but can't stop counterspell/sheep/cc

shamans  (the worst pvp healer) have earthbind totem... they just die and all shamans should be elemental in pvp

paladins have divine shield

they cannot be counterspelled

they cannot be sheeped

they cannot be killed

they get 12 seconds of clearcasting on their warrior who they are also removing ALL cc's from. And as a warrior, you only need 12 seconds of hitting to kill 3+ people

man, I never had this back in the day, I went to NZ for 3 months back then and my guild was emailing me every couple of days.

That's some serious organizing. Good work guys, even if you're alliance scum.

Oo what quest add on are they using
---
The team that went Undercity wiped twice and needed backup before killing sylvannas so it wasn’t as one sided as it seems
---
I play on pve realm or I mean I don’t really play classic anymore but have it on pve. According to some stats it is 55% alliance and this server likely won’t become 100% alliance anytime soon. This server already have way lower raiding population than the bigger realms. 1 year from now I can’t expect to come back and join to a hardcore guild because there likely won’t be many. Meanwhile on a pvp server there could be twice as much people in one faction which means more players to play with.
---
I honestly thought they did my dude
---
Well, apparently everything is cringe nowadays, I think.

Kinda sad, Leeroy Jenkins was a legend, but if he released the video today, people might call him cringe too.

I know this gonna get downvoted to hell, but I just want to say, he really did a great job.
---
I hope you have a great life, man.
---
They probably never like you in the first place and just needed a reason to get rid of you.
---
That's really cool, and honestly one of the most impressive things I've heard of in general. Even on big servers I've played on, it seemed hard enough for people to organize a regular (and successful) city raid. The most that seemed to happen was successful groups that hit the capital cities one after another. Most big endeavors seemed to fall apart. 
---
Sounds like you really do got something special there.
---
It’s a buff from Marshal Windsor during the jailbreak quest for attunement to Ony. They must have had an alt do that quest and then immediately come into the raid. Pretty smart
---

what? all of this is just a consequence of them not listening to the community. and now, far too late, when most of the damage has been done, they finally do the right thing.
---
plz don't try to sell me that as "listening to community feedback".
---
Somebody needs to police the world.
---
I snuck in a quick log on at lunch while at work had a look saw a bunch on whispered one fo the officers but got the " you where meant to be here and you where not so". I just didn't have the will to fight it.
---
Alliance are really organized. I also think Horde is less "hardcore" so there are still a lot of us leveling.
---
Bet you won't add garrosh to that list though will ya?
---
I’m annoyed as hell that Kromkrush has like a 49/51 split alliance to horde and now the fucking xfers made it 40/60 horde.
---
Hopefully more ally will transfer over!
---
Go dagger spec. Get a bonescraper or distracting dagger. Use Felstriker in MH.
---
I had some really good times with them, maybe I cant read people like I used too.
---
Definitely not fake! Lol wow
---
LF free boost?
---
Enjoy that cake (day). And yeah, Blizzard should have said from the start that only horde can tranfer.
---
We've been waiting since the middle of August to fix this problem and they have failed over and over and over again. It's breathtaking incompetence.
---
Early 50s start to get rough again. But if your fury, it's tradition that you spend your entire time 50-60 farming Savage Gladiator Chain.
---
Find a new guild because that is just going to get worse.
---
Yes you are right it's me fakeqt from twitch.
---
It is real... he streams.
---
Felstrike is not an “off hand”. It has a much higher top end than heartseeker and should go in the MH until he gets Perditions.
---
God it annoys me that people that bad get the legendaries lol
---
It’s very close to a 50/50 split. I play alliance on earthfury and absolutely love it
---
Casual (joking) but for real ur behind on ur brilliant shard tribute and u know raid times are mandatory attendance and your still only a trial member even though you've been in a few months.  Guess different experiences different folks.
---
What this guy said. Server transfers might eventually be a thing for classic, but they will never open up PvE to PvP.  Leveling on PvP servers is a much different experience, and bypassing that would open up floodgates of vitriol.
---
What class/spec do you play?
---

---
I don't know what server you mean is 55%, but thats fine. That doesn't mean anything though. One PVE realm being lower pop than one PVP realm is irrelevant to my point. Theres no statistics that could say PvP realms will retain players and PVE servers wont.
---
why so specific?
---
How high are you?
---
Yeah, the game pretty much decided it for you
---
This is true. I was in the TB raid, which went to Org afterward and cleaned that up. It wasn't until both TB and Org raids got to UC that we were able to clear it all. And it was pretty close almost wiping it to Varimathas and his *crazy* aoe.
---
Yeah it's a bad requirement
---
Pm me, y’all can join up with us on Stalagg if you want. Can’t promise a raid spot but we have 20-35 players on at any given time.
---
What was that busta pussa?
---
Except when you have good enough gear and it outscales MM.
---
On a scale of 1-420, id say 200iq
---
The problem is when they listen, it's pretty much too late, and they cause problems that persists for years or even decades. The population imbalance issue was readily apparent in Vanilla. They should have implemented faction based Queues as well as other population balance functions over a decade ago.
---
The same is true with a lot of what they have done. For example, only listing 5 pvp servers for both North and South America was just such a disgusting oversight. What's worse is that when people here voiced their opinion of how this was OBVIOUSLY a TERRIBLE idea and nowhere near enough, you had a bunch of Blizzard nuthuggers here telling you that they have all the data and information you don't and that if they only choose to open 5 servers they must have good reason to believe that even if there was a big initial population that it would die down very quickly. Well, you have several of those initial 5 servers still on layers and still with queues DAYS before they plan on removing layers. This was obvious to anyone with half a brain. 
---
I also have problems with the hidden hotfixes/changes they make to the game that they refuse to even comment on.
---
I respect the hustle.

I was playing for the people. Then those people including the guild master started logging in less and less. Most of the people who were still logging in found raiding guilds. So I started playing with the people who are freshly 60 and getting them gear which is alright but they are decidedly more casual than the people who started playing at launch.
---
Shit happens.
---
Why would you do Rend without melee?
---
Yeah look, I get that the reaction to a lot of the feedback seems to come very slow, but (without any proper knowledge at all) I'd have to assume it's not fucking quick to implement all of reddit's brain farts.
---
There would also be a heap of other factors we're not privy to influencing their decisions.
---
I mean if they had their time over would they launch with more servers from the start in a more controlled fashion? bloody likely. But they didn't, and hindsight is 20/20, and they're actively taking steps to address almost every major issue I've seen pop up on here in what seems to me to be a reasonable time frame.
---
I just don't see why it has to be such a heated us vs them all the time.
---
Better than min-maxing theorycrafting shit.
---
This seems to be the general consensus! Except someone suggested Aftermath instead of Cata which doesn't seem too bad either.
---
For PVP people seem to spec heavily into Destro - am I missing out on something big time? I really enjoy Aff builds so that's why I'm going ahead with that for now. If its a small difference then I would prefer playing with Aff, but if it makes a big one then I might consider trying it out
---
I felt like Kromkrush was fairly even while leveling, but clearly after the first xfer we had a ton of ally leave.
---
It’d be great if Blizzard just sucked it up and produced actual numbers for every server and told people that if you xfer to an unbalanced server you’ll get 1 free month.
---
This
---
Post a screenshot!
---
Some of us have done this thing, and more than once.  In Vanilla it was an absolutely soul-sucking endeavor, especially if you actually cared about your own legitimacy and didn't get others to play your account while you were sleeping.  Being an idiot and thinking integrity mattered more than results caused me to do just that; I quit one of my two jobs and did nothing but run groups at every waking moment just to achieve it.
---
\[Back in my day..\]([https://i.imgur.com/HVOGBue.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/HVOGBue.jpg))
---
One thing I found that gave a slight edge to the grind was not adhering to exclusivity to my own guild, and instead ran groups based on synergy/personality/ability--guild tags meant nothing and anyone thinking to push this round might consider doing the same.  The availability and lack of downtime trying to coordinate within your guild is a nice advantage despite often facing backlash and being called elitist etc.  You have to be selfish to a degree to pull this bullshit off.
---
Here's where it's bittersweet.  Losing didn't cost you anything but a bit of honor and perhaps some ego damage.  A lot of retail players are going to find this to be a huge relief, as anyone who pulled off the RBG version of rank 14 will tell you that due to MMR, hours of effort can be completely destroyed from a single loss.  When I pushed the second time I forced myself into the mind set of being more interested in causing my opponents to lose rating than my own personal gain.  It worked, and it was funny  \[Imgur\]([https://i.imgur.com/y6ZtCN4.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/y6ZtCN4.jpg))
---
Then it broke, because we kept going, and became a team that was a liability to play against because our MMR was so convoluted, to the point there were often 200-500 point variances between MMR and personal MMR **at the end of a season: \[Imgur\](**[**https://i.imgur.com/0G4Mru4.jpg**](https://i.imgur.com/0G4Mru4.jpg)**)**
---
So please understand this isn't some vacant boast but a caveat to those thinking the vanilla grind will be as stressful as the MMR based systems.  The only thing it will take is time, ungodly amounts of it, and effort.  Never let a loss in the vanilla grind deter you from queueing or cause morale to take a hit--remind your teammates of this because the mindset still lingers of just how devastating a single loss could be as seen in the retail module.  
---
Personally I'm looking forward to the level of play that wasn't present 15 years ago when limitations like PC specs and broadband were considerable variables.  On the other hand, this has become so streamlined that the process has basically been reduced to an equation and a handful of addons.  Same planet/different world sort of thing, but it'll be interesting nonetheless.
---
Shoutout to all you original rank 14's who did it properly and honestly.  You know who you are and I salute you!
---
Gotcha. I was just curious if you were a tank class with some competition.
---
Either way, hang in there. I’m sorry that happened to you.
---
Everything happens for a reason.
---
&gt; if they wanted a true pvp experience, especially BEFORE phase 2 has even dropped.
---
Who said the gankers wanted a “true pvp experience”? Maybe they just wanted a 100% horde server so they hindered the alliance.
---
Effective immediately, without delay.
---
I honestly always love when Alliance organizes shit to kill Horde. I'm a horde and I don't like it to engage first because I don't want to abuse superior numbers and shit. But when Alliance is the superior factor it is way more fun.
---
The only reasons I didn't join an alliance dominated server was because
---
1. I didn't know what was what 1 week after launch
---
2. I want to PvE and when you are the minority, there aren't a lot of guilds to choose from.
---
I dont understand this mentality at all. If an item is an upgrade for a class that can use it and they equip it, then why do people get so bent out of shape over it? It's like this really stupid rule. If  Scarlet Kris drops, you best believe I'm gonna need it and equip it as a dagger rogue lol.
---
Blizzard won’t produce the numbers. One reason we’re in this mess.
---
Rumors start floating that you are outnumbered and entire guilds start xferring.
---
Yea, look at him, also managed to edit in the name tag of every single player in the background.
---
What a garbage tool lmao. It literally invalidates itself in its own analysis.
---
Damn shame. It's shaman pre-raid bis. I remember spending 160g on mine, third week of release
---
And they couldn't have done it without warlocks.
---
Shit guild ! End of
---
Then what is the point of pvp realm? Why not just open free transfer to pve realm instead?
---
I think it depends a bit when you level as well. Many things you find while leveling sells much better now than they did at launch, especially with single layer.
---
I think if you got 100g+ when you ding, that is probably the average. Some people are gonna have 300g and others are gonna have just 40-50g
---
Barely hi value at that, dude threw away his rep for like 15g
---
ok boomer
---
Apart from the auto selection, in what ways is it better to Atlas?
---
Maybe find someone who wants to go PVP to PVE and swap gold? At least the both of you wouldn’t start over broke.
---
"dont rush" - it's  been 3 fuckin months. These people will be sitting before Naxx launches and be like don't rush to 60 guys
---
Let's do the math on that.
---
From bullshit googling (correct me if I'm wrong pls... I have never used a floppy disk) 
---
Floppy disks hold about 1.5mb each. If the videos are 480p .mp4 files, each minute of video is about 12mb. Assuming he's got 30 min of video, that will take 240 floppy disks. He better get to work in those
---
Shit guild.  
---
There will be others.
---
Push my bush.
---
Oh I 100% agree. But we don't have that "Everyone Need on BoEs" Problem that seem to plague the american servers here. The guy shouting "everyone greed" probably thought the item was BoE.
---
Yeah, let this guy grind you 4v1 for honor until you eventually quit.
---
Can someone explain?
---
&gt;selfish
---
big true
---
Don’t have to deal with that, just vanish ezpz
---
Well, you don’t have to defend TB. The elevator is plenty of defense against a raid.
---
Alliance, won't name guild though don't want to start anything
---
Probably the best reason. Why would anyone kick their top dps when people are stopping the game constantly and you need new recruits every month?
---
40 mins without buffs? Lol bullshit.
---
Wow 1 guy, 3000 view video, anecdotal evidence LMAO.  Combat swords is extremely viable.  Imp kick and sprint are both extremely useful in PvP.  Combat rogue just takes a bit more strategy.  You don't know shit.
---
Great to hear this. I always do the same.
---
Fair enough. Good luck moving forward.

Try farming Greater Rock Elementals in Badlands. I have been farming the Lesser and normal ones since lvl 36. I am now lvl 39 with almost 160 gold. The rocks they drop vendor for a lot and elemental earth sells well.
---
Aw, RP pvp servers look like so much fun. I'm on Heartseeker, I love it, great alliance community overall, but you RP guys really know how to have fun in this game! It's so hard to organize city raids on non-RP realms, there's no incentive.
---
Thanks, I'll
---
Still got layering, but at least when P2 hits tonight I won't have a 5 hour queue..
---
Enjoy.
---
*shrug*
---
Incendius is doing great. Still listed as layered last I looked.
---
The concept that there are only dishonorable horde players is wildly overplayed on this sub. I'm Skeram horde. Only attack alliance who are out of combat and at least green. Meanwhile, I was chain camped by 4 alliance today. Ended up logging cuz fuck that.
---
Things go both ways, on any server and any faction. It's just people playing a video game. Some are good and some are shitty. Welcome to life.
---
Yeah there's a lot of guilds that came over from Emerald Dream. And we didn't fuck around with our wpvp on ED.
---
Blizzard loves saying things really late, it's annoying but no need to don the tinfoil hat here
---
Not on official servers
---
Best move I ever made was to abandon my 60 warrior there and reroll on ashbringer!
---
Kromcrush was great and then all of the alliance just dipped. Frustrating to say the least.
---
Bro there's tons of other people you could play with, don't get upset because some assholes didn't treat you with the respect you deserve. Move on, MC is entry level anyway. You'll find another guild just talk to some people. Those other people were not your friends.
---
My main was a hunter back then, I spent a lot of time getting ready.  I won't say I was top ups but I was in the top 10
---
Aim to have around 10000 gold. You'll get absolutely nowhere near but aim for the stars my dude:) I believe.
---
You welcome, that's my plan :)
---
Idk if you realize this, but server transfers were a thing in vanilla. I get what you're saying, but it's just not a realistic expectation
---
addicted mate
---
Never use Barman Shanker in a raid.
---
THIS would have been awesome if we had it from day 1. Then the pops would have naturally distributed themselves better across the servers which would have avoided the alliance exodus which would have prevented the current imbalance issues. If they implement it now, I fear it would be too little too late.
---
If you want to go Arms for raiding, that's fine, you j
---
Just have to be realistic and set your expectations appropriately with the quality of guild that will take you.
---
battleshout is better
---
nobody said without buffs just without the expensive flask
---
Not counting in the Asian servers...
---
Thank you my dude, as soon as I can ill be back, just have to get my Reno finished off then move back in and setup again
---
That’s a pretty sick shot you snagged.
---
2H Fury &gt; Arms. Why purposely gimp yourself?
---
HC guilds kick underperformers all the time. What are you even talking about. Everyone has to carry their own weight.
---
We hadn't had loot drama. What we did have was a bit of unequal contribution drama. 
---
Basically we were at rag and more than half the people had not even basic pots. That means, no fire protection, no agi, no strength, no magic resistance, nothing. And then like 5-10 people had like every pot in existence.
---
We wiped 5 times so these 5-10 people spend like 80 gold on it. I got pissed af because I hate it when people don't contribute to the fight. It got resolved really well though and aside from the point that half the guild is now scared of me, we came out stronger.
---
We are a DKP guild and I took the responsibility to determine minimum required pot usage for the next Rag fight (as to not lose 20 DKP) as well as pot usage for a 20 DKP bonus. A ton of people shot for the bonus and we absolutely destroyed rag. We oneshot him within 2:30 minutes with 5 or so deaths and people spend less on the pots than they spend on rep costs the last time around.
---
it's actually insane how every single comment about being outnumbered as alliance has these idiots that are like BUT IT'S LIKE THAT ON ONE SINGLE FUCKING SERVER FOR HORDE TOO!
---
that shouldn't be a problem if you follow a good rotation.
---
wPVP is garbage. I don't know why anyone cares that much about it. 
---
Nine times out of ten wpvp is a fight you can't win anyway.
---
This addon gives you a heads up so you can maybe have enough reaction time to even the playing field. 
---
If you wanted as close to balance pvp content as possible, go to retail. 
---
Baring that, just do what literally everyone else in wpvp does and wait for your target to fight a mob or two. Then it'll be easy.
---
Definitely my favorite racial lol.
---
You forgot level 44: Kang with crusader. It must be done
---
Ah see that’s why you roll mage.
---
Sell stacks directly to guilds.
---
can't use that inside a dungeon
---
waaaaaah there's like 3 of us for every alliance and I had to deal with getting ganked ONCE. WAAAAAAAAAH. you are an actual fucking baby
---
They won't.  Blizzard screwed themselves on this one because the servers are too overpopulated for p2 PvP, but they can't fix the population problem because of the faction imbalance.  People are going to be very unhappy come thursday when everything lags out and the game is unplayable.
---
Ehh warrior can dps so it's not wasted
---
There isn't an imbalance on Grob.
---
Still hunting for my book at 268 total bosskills in DM D:
---
Stick all your melee on Garr and just use casters to dps adds so you don’t need to worry about them exploding. Have one or two fury warriors with a shield spread amongst the casters and healers to taunt any adds that break out of banish early so they don’t run around 1-shotting healers. You can also have a priest assigned to dispelling the slow from these warriors too to make it even easier. 
---
If your tanks have decent gear you don’t need many locks. Just 3 tanks and 1-2 dps warriors as mentioned above. 
---
Once you’ve killed 4 adds, the damage burden on offtanks is minimal so refocus all dps on Garr. Then finish off the adds. 
---
This isn’t the fastest tactic for speed clears but it is pretty foolproof.
---
It's quite hard to get to the quest person solo though. I've got the same problem where i don't want to do LBRS but i can't get to Valean solo, even as a warlock.

I must have the spatial awareness of a hunter cosplaying as Illidan, I didnt know there even was a Q&amp;A thread!
---
Man, you're so smart!  
---
This whole post is about me.  Mainspec healer who switched to shadow for the week to help other guildies farm mats while prepping for pvp this coming week (familiarizing myself with mechanics).  
---
Sunday night rolls around and I ask guild leader if I should spec back to holy to help guild.  They tell me to stay shadow and it's all good.  I say np and if it turns out we fall short on heals, I offer to hearth back and respec.
---
During the raid I win a roll for a chest and pass it to guildie.  Would have been a nice vest for me to pvp in outside of Truefaith, but the other guy had neither.
---
We get to domo fight and I win a (minor upgrade) healing ring with a 98 roll.  Guild leader who says I was fine staying shadow tells me all loot is MS&gt;OS and my roll is void.
---
I gquit and hearth.  Get called a cheater for being given the hide of the wild.  Grabbed hide of wild out of bank and traded it back (unequipped).
---
P.S. the part about the Eye of Shadow?  Majority of our guild team farmed that for me and another person.  Guild leader does very minimal to help guild while other officers put in work.
---
Apparently the guild leader feels so guilty he takes to reddit to butcher the story to gain reassurances from strangers about his poor integrity.
---
Questie
---
This is what is known as a hyperbolic example. See the quotation marks around that statement?
---
Hold up. There's an auto dismount addon?
---
&gt; Add-ons like spy weren't as widely used in vanilla so their their functionality changes "vanilla" pvp today.
---
The problem with #nochanges is that there's either literally no changes to be made to the client or addons associated with it.
---
Or there's #somechanges
---
"It wasn't widely used" is not a great argument to make if your overall stance is #nochanges.
---
It existed, therefore it falls under #nochanges. 
---
Sites like wowhead and icyveins didn't exist in Vanilla either. The wealth of player knowledge in this game makes it so that Classic is a "known game". 
---
It's a little late to complain about things "not widely used".

---
Sounds pretty standard
---
The problem with the Classic Community is that there's so many sub groups of people, that no one will agree on anything and large groups of people will be upset if any changes are made to the game. 
---
Just to be clear, Blizzard isn't going to do ***anything*** to the game except patch any exploits that fundamentally break the game entirely (like phasing in an instance to kill a boss again). 
---
Reason being is that you have too many groups of players that all want different things. Doing something for one, will piss off the others.
---
1) The NoChanges Crowd. 
---
2) The SomeChanges Crowd.
---
3) The AnyChanges Crowd. 
---
4) The Expansionist Crowd.
---
5) The NoExpansionButNewContentOnly Crowd.
---
Some of them overlap with others, but you have too many competing groups that all want different things. 
---
&gt; minor QOL changes can be added without creating the retail experience.
---
The NoChanges Crowd would disagree with you, and may end up quitting the game or not playing as much because of that. 
---
*snap* there goes a % of your player base. Gone. 
---
Or if you're Blizzard, you just do nothing and everyone continues to play.
---
I think as soon as you cast any spells/abilities it dismounts you. It's called autodismount.
---
It is funny for me. I sit quite high in terms of having to say stuff in the guild. But I would never do loot council tasks. We have a much more maintenance needing DKP system, but I would hate it to award people stuff myself. I have friends in the guild and they are not necessarily contributing as much as other people who I never spoke with.
---
Instead I made clear rules on what gives what DKP. And when I give out the bonusses I can just work down my list. The friends I have I can either tell "You don't get it because of X" or "As I expected of you, you get the bonus".
---
Yeah, I wasnt refering to everyone playing Classic but this sub in particular.
---
Someone had an ultrawide :D
---
ok yeah, if its pve whatever. who cares
---
Had this happen with 5 warriors and a Rogue. One warrior won all 3.
---
The fuck you taking about 15 people??? Are you playing on the same server??? I'm logged in right now at 1 am and there still like 30-40 people between bank and AH. Prime time double that. You either don't play on Stalagg or you're lying.
---
Best part is this dude claims he is going to run the whitemane honor bracket omegalul
---
Blizzard kind of forgot to finish the paladin class before the Vanilla launch, so it's not a surprise that this isn't working properly.
---
Oh really? Transferred one char during first free transfers when one  of the friends suggested we all transfer there to play together since we started on different server on launch.
---
As a horde player i like to hear that there's a lot of alliance on this server, and we'll meet soon :)
---
Shard tribute? Like a membership due?
---
Don’t forget wetlands glaring sun screenshot and it’s evil twin, wetlands glaring sun phone shot.
---
So they say
---
They are the same person, silly!
---
Afaik every point gives some degree of protection but that's mostly based on me not ever reading anything to the contrary.   Either way 35 is pretty negligible
---
Very long but way too little substance or concrete information.
---
Yeah this. I’m on stalagg alliance and if you can’t excel in wPvP with 9 fucking people, those players aren’t worth playing with anyways. Sounds like they want a PvE experience.
---
I would make new friends, personally. Just tonight I saw Grizzly recruiting, among 3-4 other great guilds that plan to do pvp. Join one of them and enjoy an actual challenge and some form of accomplishment, not raidlogging and flightmaster camping an 85:15 server.
---
It’s actually really balanced, the thing is the alliance has more guilds that focus on Zerg raids while Horde tends to prefer small group pvp.
---
Or maybe it was just a bug and not intended?
---
Yeah, like anyone expected the servers would be 8:1 horde to alliance.
---
Crickets
---
We'll take the 5%. We need everyone we can muster.
---
You cannot really dps. You can either take dps or tank talents. And without those talents your damage in cat will be ... pretty bad.
---
Name em if they're trash. Deserve to get called out for that shit
---
Ok
---
Only detects when you activate stealth or leave stealth. Basically you are useless because they do not detect you when you are stealth but for some reason you think they do - You should git gud and stop whining about something that doesn't exist. If it were how you said it was, This mod would be against the game rules, as there is stealth detection items/buffs and trinkets so this would be considered a CHEAT. You don't count how long I'm casting my spells for you have an addon to track that so you know when you should interrupt. Literally the same thing with this addon, I have an addon to detect when you go into stealth or out of it and I know that I should pre-fire some rank 1 spells while i try to bait you into getting close to me.
---
*wetlands glaring sun screen shot* and it’s disabled sister *wetlands glaring sun phone shot*
---
Meh I got all the dungeons memorized I am good.  I am personally not a fan of this because dungeons are something that are supposed to be explored especially first timers, shouldn't have a completed map first time in a dungeon.
---
This true? It wasn't my experience in vanilla
---
Here's the deal. 
---
Any weird interactions with the game, any "why did the guards aggro me?" questions can be summed up simply as, welcome to classic and no it won't be changed. 
---
If you want to see those things fixed / addressed, classic is not your game.
---
Speaking from an Alliance perspective, Horde pops on heartseeker are beginning to be very healthy. Its nice to see BRM be contested again.
---
I have not done a whole lot of dungeon runs maybe that?
---
My guild did a split Onyxia this week because we have enough 60s to do 2 now. I wound up being the only warlock in the group I went with but I already have the T2 helm. We spammed and spammed but couldn't find a warlock because it was late in the week and other groups were also forming.
---
You can probably guess what Onyxia dropped.
---
Not sure what's going on there.
---
There were days were alliance controlled BRM and my group would have to corpse run just go get to an instance in there. Now it seems like the past week every instance iv gone too (minus strat) alliance have been having to corpse run to the instance.
---
My hope is that it's just a bit of raid logging, time people are playing compared to mine, and just general attitude towards pvp at the moment. Even how it currently feels it's not bad but just a small tilt toward horde when the big battles start in a few days. Im still chased down pretty regularly so it's by no means lopsided.
---
Soon is an optimistic way of saying in half a year
---
you have the opportunity to transfer to heartseeker to get access to all the allies you could ever want. you won't because you're a shit horde mob player that needs all that AND better racials to be competitive lol. have fun on your pve server because I know your clown ass isn't transferring to where there's a challenge
---
Doesnt show on my Bonereavers Edge either :(
---
Dodger needs to make new account to post on reddit big kek.
---
Keep the auction House Prince in your sight, i can be Mode worth after reset, near weekend. I got ist Sold for 40s each on Venoxis Eu. Dont sell everything at one time. I think every Item thats easy to Farm is very hard to say that the price will Go Up in time
---
I spend about 400g a week to raid that alone is 8 hours. Buffs take about an hour. Raid takes sub 1 hour. It blows honestly, don't do it.
---
Lol, we are gonna make a big change that will effect the entire server’s stability.
---
*server goes down*
---
Nope wasn’t us it was them Russians.
---
Leatrix plus does this and way more.
---
Honestly,  since none of my friends are still playing, Wish I had the option to transfer there lol. I couldn't stand starting from scratch again lol
---
Dont see the issue... this game was rated for young teenagers anyway.
---
Comparing something that helps you quest to something that negatively affects 1 class is ignorant.
---
Its better than a corrupt loot council.
---
I have always been an advocate for LC (In retail) where you actually need to spread your gear correctly to progress, and never had any problems in like 6 years of raiding.
---
Queue classic, and its a shit show. Everyone wants loot, and our council is corrupt.
---
For a game such as classic, you shouldnt try hard with loot. Gear your tanks a bit (Since thats all you need) and then let everyone roll.
---
Meanwhile in my guild I had discussions with officers who didn't want bonus DKP for their rightfully owned bonus because they are officers. I told them like "You fulfilled the requirements set on the list for bonus DKP that everyone can see. You get that bonus DKP if you want it or not. If you don't want bonus DKP, don't fulfill the requirements"
---
Uhm my guy. That was true for launch. This is 1.12 regardless of what content is in the game. Yeah pallys werent totally balanced but they were at least working properly by then
---
Something else being bad doesn't make this not bad. Spy and add-ons like it need to go as they provide too much of an advantage to the people using the add-on so much so that other players have no option other than be at a huge disadvantage or use the add-on as well.
---
Tank chest though!
---
You sure have high expectations of your friends. A reasonable person, like OP, might see that asking over 3/4 of the group to come back to an unfun situation isn't really fair and would look for other options rather than take things so personally. Insinuating that they would pull the same thing IRL is completely unfounded and incredibly pedantic.
---
Yes but it doesn't show a frame for my party members. Only shows a frame for myself.
---
Download Questie it’s an plugin.
---
Yeah, paladins in beta were OP against undead PCs, with exorcism and turn undead. Will of the Forsaken seemed pretty fair when paladins could completely dominate Forsaken players 1v1.
---
Then pallies got nerfed, crusader strike was removed, and exorcism/turn undead no longer applied in PvP. I was a very sad pally. This time around, I rolled a priest to fuck up the undead players with mind control (in beta, they were immune).
---
No...flood of Alliance *off* Stalagg. Which caused Blizz HQ to say "oh shit!" and hit the panic button.
---
Gehennas
---
I’ve enjoyed seeing those near Undercity. It’s a game that features living zombies as a playable class. How do.. you think they would’ve died?
---
Funny cuz Reddit has literally been complaining about lack of faction specific transfers for about 8 weeks non stop
---
Also burn your vanish randomly because you're not the a****** using the a****** add-on before you ever see the person randomly using the a****** add-on. Brilliant.
---
Cries in rogue
---
where are these?
---
Lol that is a high af min bid. We can earn like 230 dkp per week and min bid is 20.
---
Had a Krol Blade drop the other day that I sold for 300g.
---
I played a ton back in vanilla and the only other epic BoE i've gotten was Lei of Lilies.
---
I was under the impression that everyone wants exalted with Argent dawn for the shoulder enchant.
---
deadwind pass
---
Onyxia attunement maybe.
---
yea but there is a difference between Skeletor cartoon skeletons and actually seeing a graphic depiction of hanging
---
How do you manage the queue? I might be interested in doing something like this on my server by multiboxing but not sure how to get it going
---
Yeah if you are a super progress guild that only cares about getting world firsts or server firsts that makes sense. If you want to have fun, it does not.
---
Where is the fun in officers telling me that the item is good or better on someone else? DKP is way more fun.
---
Yeah I saw it after publishing ^^
---
This isn’t considered graphic trust me I’ve worked in content moderation before.
---
Well it's their own fault for transfering away as alliance.
---
Mages scale better with gear, especially when Fire becomes viable. They’ll be top DPS by AQ/Naxx. 
---
They have the best matchup in the game into Spriests, and generally good matchups into every warlock spec that isn’t SL - but no one beats SL locks 1v1, and mages are amongst the only class that can even try to challenge a Shadow priest. And the best thing about it is that both Spriest and SL-locks are unviable for organized PvP.
---
Sir, they’re both cartoon depictions. Are you well?
---
We sometimes bring an enh shaman. He is always dominating the end of the DPS just barely above the tanks. But he is a buffbot. He literally does not amount to more. He knows it. We told him that he has low priority on being taken to the raid.
---
&gt;It’s mostly min maxing.
---
Wouldn't that make alliance the best faction then?
---
All the people pushing for first 60 and first MC were ally when classic launched
---
How is it graphic?
---
*I’d *they
---
Sadly true. As an ele sham myself, I second resto and end up healing often. When we need more Dps and fewer heals,  I get to be the one to switch specs!
---
Lol should of done your research first, nonetheless it's still BiS OH for your Hunter.
---
Most people are kind and understand when you tell them your new but some dont. You'll make mistakes but dont let people get you down.
---
Thrash mh... oh damage is reduced so the extra proc from thrash is wasted on oh.
---
Either show the debuff or even better, don't make it a debuff.
---
Yeah in a game about war and genocide a few hanging bodies is too far.  Brb gonna go genocide some murlocs
---
Hey now, my warlock is always great
---
F
---
I know. This isn't a comment on how boomkins work but surprise that some one who is claiming to be the number 1 balance druid doesn't understand how moonkin form works or that the first balance spell they get is nature.
---
Heartseeker will easily be one of the best servers for horde wpvp, they are doing great chap
---
Fuck that. Any guild that does that is a shit guild. End of.
---
This is coming from someone that mained a tank in vanilla/tbc and later in pservers.
---
No you pop a free action potion and take a dump on their fuckin chest, fuck ‘em
---
The lack of structure is agonizing to watch
---
If you don’t know how to download and install addobd, DM me. A few are must haves like quest or that he just mentioned
---
It's 50/50, but the largest horde guild is very pve, so the alliance are way more organized.
---
Looks like the streamers can't hide anymore.  I love it.
---
Any issues with people not paying? Y’all just blacklist them and move on?
---
Even op said he does not want to play on his current realm lol.
---
Leveling to 60 is easy on PvE, everyone would just level quickly to 60 on a PvE server then hop to PvP. Nothing about honor, even, just it's too easy to make it to 60 on a PvE server without being ganked constantly. Everyone on a PvP server should earn it. 
---
People still PvE on a PvP server, everything is just more challenging there.
---
No part of me is complaining lol, the transfers aren't happening
---
Combat rogue is very viable in pvp.  You don't know shit.
---
If they're a gnome mage, yes
---
Most inglourious, in my opinion.
---
You just need some invis and swiftness potions. Look for the warlock video in soloing omak I think and it will show you how to get there.
---
On 60 when you get Sulfuras.
---
All of classic wow world pvp has almost nothing to do with skill
---
If you remove layering and everyone tries to log in at once, that technically could cause a DoS
---
I play on Incendius and it’s definitely doing good, always see plenty of other players.
---
Damn this is actually so awesome. I play horde but 100% wish I was playing with you guys.
---
Honor has literally nothing to do with being good at PvP.
---
why would you need black lotus tho, its not mandatory. for flasks? just ignore it lol
---
That paladin is so bad wtf. How did he even get hand of rag LOL?
---
Are people selling it now or something? I don’t see how in the world someone that bad can get hand of rag.
---
Like the first thing he did when he attacked the rogue was freaking seal of the crusader ahahahaha
---
Hahaha extra gross!
---
So is my enchanted Barbarous Blade
---
Send the rainbow to your fish bank. It's a rep turn in for phase 5
---
We've been open for a couple months now, so the majority of our users knows that we just go down the list in order. When there's multiple people going to one place, we'll summon all of those people at once, even if they're further down the list. For the most part it works really well, on busy days we'll only get a long line three times or so, otherwise we can keep up easily.
---
This in mind, there have been times in the past where we couldn't keep up with demand. That is in particular when we've had to raise our price, because the wait time was getting insane, as well as farming so many soulshards in the morning.
---
I would consider maybe doing some key locations, and not offering ten locations like we do to cut down on that wait time. Org and Undercity are our most commonly requested/used locations, with Org being over 100 summons daily and Undercity being 60+, the third location i'd actually suggest being Kargath- since it's a 7+ minute flight from Undercity and close to so many things, including Blackrock Mountain, it follows as the third most popular location with one of the most benefits with the time saved.
---
Um, it's an actual thing. You really think all servers have the same ISP? This depends on the location of the data centres. For example, the company I work for has 4 data centres in Germany and only 2 use the same ISP.
---
Its too early to write a whole answer and I'm also on my phone, but try googling it.
---
U guys rock! Love this game🖤
---
You are literally in a thread advocating rushing to 60. Also if you have spent more than 2 minutes here you have absolutely seen many similar comments.
---
I’m assuming with this attitude he has never watched a show or movie either.
---
Have you considered not spending all of your free time bleeding from your vagina?
---
Now yes but if you hold the squid for July it should be better.
---
You might be able to stand it, considering we have an absolutely amazing community on our server, with a huge amount of qualities guilds to choose from with splendid people in them.
---
i play grobb horde, it's really casual and people just like to mess around. most spend their time leveling. alliance are definitely more aggressive and coordinated, i tend not to pick any fights but i get constantly ganked lol (lvl 38 rn)
---
Orc stun resist alone is better than anything alliance has.
---
Link this post to every idiot who claims it is:
---
1) Whoever rolls first wins a tied roll
---
2) Whoever is first alphabetically wins a tied roll
---
Are you a legitimate soccer mom from 2005 still complaining to this day about video games with non-christian values?
---
If not, you're just drawing from that wellspring of outrage as a joke. Either way, /golfclap
---
yep, i transferred more than once during vanilla.
---
Shut up nerd.
---
Ive been in loot council many times and I'm n my guild's loot council now. Never have I seen people so purple-hungry. Literally every week, people have issues even when we've clearly lined out our loot rules.
---
Every time a weapon or trinket drops, I have to pray no one drops guild or loses it in discord. This is the strangest phenomena compared to literally every other expansion.
---
I need to join these groups &gt;.&gt;
---
yeah not a second or two
---
That doesnt make sense at all. Why would horde players decide to stick to horde then if by your logic they wouldnt roll the same faction that they did before?
---
You can also do this with autohotkey if someone has it and does not want to install anything extra.
---
Everyone that buys gold are scum.
---
Only if you have a fap on hand and recklessness is not on cd, otherwise goodnight sweet prince
---
Nice response :)
---
You don't lose durability from pvp deaths
---
This guy knows where the party is at.
---
And are you part of the over or underpopulated faction?
---
One of us!
---
or you know, blizz could just stop boycotting their own game just because some pathetic asshats can't have it that we like the old game more
---

---
Must have been one happy tank.
---
Can’t you just do that in retail anyway? (Never played retail past Burning Crusade$
---
Why does one need twitch app?
---
As a mage, I pretty much ignore every class EXCEPT for rogues.   I open up on those fuckers every single time... fuck rogues
---
So yea, go for it.
---
Thanks
---
Fix what? It is working as intended.
---
You should really, I mean *really* start educating yourself on the subject you are trying to discuss. For instance sheep is not limited to 12 seconds in classic, this change was introduced with TBC for arenas.
---
You can get sheeped for 45 seconds. The mage can teleport to Darnassus and come back, deal some stuff at the AH and you're still sheeped. Diminishing return doesn't proc here because you are not chaining sheeps.
---
I hope you're a troll
---
In principal the buying and selling of goods would be fine (going past the idea of "do you own your virual wow gold here" just taking it as true for argument sake)... if not for people stealing accounts or disrupting the game with excesive farming. The source of this gold is "dirty" or leads to gameplay issues.
---
&gt;really good group of people...  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;...Missed 1 raid just 1 and I am gkicked and booted from discord, no explanation or anything
---
These two do not quite add up. Sounds like that sooner or later you would've faced issues in that type of guild. So rather being sad, be happy that you got out early. There is tons of great guilds out there. I am sure you can find new one. And remember if there were some players you liked to play with, nothing stops you from doing dungeons and other activities outside of raids with them.
---
I've only been playing for around 2 months but I've gotten two Meadow rings, one of agility (+5) and one crappier one with +3 int/+2 stam or something. Supposedly the agility ring is worth 80-120g and the other one is 20-35g but I haven't had luck selling.  
---
Also, I got a Prospector Axe from SFK the other day. Went to lower the price on AH today since it wasn't selling and I accidentally put it into AH for 17s instead of 17g. An AH bot bought it within 5 seconds... I'm only level 32 so that pissed me off quite a bit.
---
Clearly this wasn't enough for them to switch so far
---
Demonshear is the way to go, top dmg + weapon specc is just better.
---
ps: just curious with what gear you are going as I think there are a alot of variants for preraid BiS PvP-Gear.
---
This reminds me of some of the best times I’ve had in this game. When I first heard it I had no idea what the lyrics meant. Later when I did read the lyrics, it was even better.
---
I never thought that. People really out here stealing people’s hard earned gold? That’s worse than dirty. I’m 20g away from my first mount and if I had it stolen I’d legitimately cry
---
That was awesome AF man.... I'm also gonna use this thread to ask you which add on u are using that shows your cool downs and buffs that way... I'm a mage and I'm gonna need such an add on for pvp. Which shows my ice barrier cool down etc.
---
Also is 3 points in ruthlessness worth it or is it better to just put 1 for a possible proc

---
I love the realm, feels balanced on both sides!
---
But in the end, the noisy wheel gets the grease. Seriously, bug them enough and you'll get what you called for.
---
I hope there was a rogue who was asked to go, but declined.
---
So now alliance can't server transfer?
---
Cowards use Warlocks. Surviving/Stopping the run to the city is half the fun.
---
If you want to be "competetive" it sadly is kinda mandatory, because you miss out alot in comparison to people using it. Its kinda like gladius for arena, its doable without, but much much easier with.
---
&gt; the evidence is everywhere
---
He said without providing any source whatsoever. If it's 'everywhere' at least link it.
---
I'd like to say I'd lose with grace, but chances are I'd fling my keyboard at my monitor. In-game I'm like /cheer, real life I'd be like aspfijdgoi;ahdgo;ijsgpasdiofjpjgspgjasdpgjio
---
warlocks are fun
---
Oh wow, imagine scrolling reddit and finding your sunday afternoon Onyxia raid. Cool video from your perspective, Casp!
---
I think it only combat flags you, which is a red flag for guards - but as to whetheter you both would have died if he was on the ground - can't tell. Would need some volunteer testing!
---
But definitely report if you see some rooftop/ cagetop camping as those are bannable.

---
Its good because its bad for everything.
---
But there are also a lot of guilds who don't clear MC + Ony in 3h or haven't even cleared MC yet.
---
My guild just did MC for the first time since release this Sunday and we got to Shazzrah before the raid timeframe was over. And everyone was totally happy with that.
---
This time around there are **a lot** of dads and moms in Classic and people with time consuming jobs. 
---
I know that a huge part of the community couldn't even imagine not clearing MC in 3 hours and that's totally fine, but there's also a big other part of the community which doesn't need BWL for a long time.
---
And a pre raid bis hunter item
---
True. But being able to do it with fewer people only proves how easy it is and doing speed runs provides a *little* bit of challenge, but still...
---
&gt;If you can find a healing buddy I think warriors shine and I love getting them in my groups as a  pally.
---
This is the true answer. Warriors excel when they have a healer.
---
Discussing the game is worse than a screenshot that offers nothing to anyone except the person that posted it?
---
Someone learned to animate for this. Respect.
---
Heh that's fine. Just messing around with the talent tree. Thanks for the heads up anyway.
---
I mean I’m new but I’ve had no trouble at all healing instances. 
---
Do shamans reallly fall off? I’m 50 now.
---
Allow horde only transfers and allow alliance to skip queue.
---
Edgelord gloves sound like Masturbatory aides.
---
Paid server transfers to any server is the stupidest idea anyone could think of. People are complaining imbalance now, it will be not only faction imbalance but literally dead servers if they do that. At least for now we avoid the latter. Also with these faction only transfers imbalance “should” be less
---
While it’s a “jack of all trades” people don’t want that. 
---
They want that dedicated healer or dedicated “tank” or dedicated “dps”
---
No I meant a real challenge. Not the imagined "unnecessarily tedious in every single aspect of the game" challenge.
---
i understand people like addons... but it causes problems, like this.. and pretty soon it turns in to some game breaking thing where if you dont have it, you're disadvantaged
---
If you called it "underperforming on all 3 levels" it would be more representative of this build.
---
Damn that’s skeezy as fuck dude. Can you even report that since your doing something against blizzards rules? Like a calling the cops on someone that stole your coke kinda thing? Lol
---
Do other AoE abilities apply debuffs?
---
ye you will have fun and also 4hours+ MC.
---
*Laughs in PVE Realm*
---
Consider this:
---
https://sixtyupgrades.com/character/krwUDEV57NQHzYNbvWLCUE/set/os8bFqjvEicpGzGtngptzQ
---
It's your sash and most of the bis items according to sixtyupgrades. It puts spell power at 337. I'm interested in how you pop 442.
---
you’re the biggest vagina. shut the fuck up
---
All the data I've seen says "just fine".
---
Yea, I was just tryin to be nice and give you an out. You're wrong and please never speak again.
---
I use it because it makes it easier to manage and keep all my addons up to date.
---
“Friends”
---
So your “friends” transfers over, and now they have the option to come back, but chooses to stay there anyway. Your “friends” ditched you without a second thought my dude.
---
Obviously. I’m curious what guild though. Show me where on the doll grizzly touched you.
---
I respect ! Been so bored being arms 2h I went arms dual. Now I’m on a female undead toon at lvl 9 that I intent to make deep prot. I think a lot of people are starting to see the beauty of being a real tank. Could you recommend my talent leveling path for fee prot? Ty!!!
---
Just from my own experience, anything less than 60 resist is pointless. At around 120+ is when you regularly get resists, and 150+ becomes reliable.
---
"Uhhh shit guys like all the Alliance are transferring, none of the Horde are!" 
---
"I have an idea...".
---
Good job being a team player 👍👍
---
What? it's probably not the twitch the streaming platform app you had in mind?...
---
It's hilarious that you would include that last sentence, honestly.
---
Hahahahahaah
---
you've already answered your own question
---
&gt;Dreadmist feels massively horde favoured and with phase 2 coming along I don’t wanna be around
---
Transfer asap
---
Depending on your level and friends on the server, make sure you play on pve if your frustration level is low
---
I am well aware of that. And I do love both of those roles. Unfortunately neither seems to be really viable in vanilla.
---
Shamans fall off??? They're insane and required for all of classic. I believe he was pointing it out because most people bring 2 healers
---
I wanna move an alt to a second account so I can use my main to gear it up via stealth runs. Should have used my other account to start, ah well.
---
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/506996103 2:09:00
---
For Dungeons it’s generally not an option because Searing Pain causes increased threat.
---
For PvP it’s good in a full Destruction build.
---
Spy itself didn't but addons with the same functionality did
---
I don't agree with what he said but you're trying to apply his logic to both sides when that makes 0 sense. His logic makes sense contextually because is has to do with age ranges, he's just making huge assumptions about what people chose alliance in Vanilla and the player base age range.
---
I love dong these surveys ! but I want the results NOOOAAAAWWWWWW
---
I don't know what you're getting at, then. If you want a challenging WoW game, retail's right there. Mythic raids blow AQ40 and Naxx out of the water in terms of complexity and difficulty.
---
&gt; If a rogue really wants to be sneaky, they'll have to stealth outside the view distance of the point, because an experienced player will see them coming anyway. 
---
Yup. Pretty much have to stealth as soon as you go out the gates. If you're guarding a flag then you spend all your time staring at the roads, and people will say in chat when someone is approaching a flag.
---
&gt; You can't just approach a flag and instantly see who's defending unless they were casting stuff or getting healed by passive abilities. 
---
That's how spy works. They need to actually do something. It doesn't automatically find every player in range.
---
When the private server died and only had 400 players, salad bakers kept going really strong with dedicated raiders every week with a sleeping guild aswell. Those guys are so nice and are very skilled and it was super fun to be apart of it for a while
---
Yeah well you're both delusional idiots.
---
Its easy just use 2 Invisible pots
---
O ok, I misread the tone of his post completely. 
---
I can be socially deaf sometimes.
---
But spy doesn't tell you where they actually are..
---
That's not what I said.  I said it's not unique to spriest.
---
Correct, it doesn't. You can check by getting a weakaura or addon that shows your current movement speed and test with boots on and off while cheetah is on.
---
Love to see how the GM's will react to this.. hmm there doesn't seem to be a section in the wiki on how to handle slander.
---
Could be Zandalar Tribe.
---
Searing pain is way under rated in pvp and i use it often in pve, i wouldnt recommend going fire till everyones out of their mc fire resist outfits though
---
No DDoS has ever been aimed at Blizzard servers btw, it's always aimed at ISP's and nothing to do with the WoW servers.
---
It’s not ez win whenever you realise you compete with your own faction for honor
---
Suppression 2 pts is enough. If you spec SM for PvP, should really take 5/5 Fel Conc for pvp. There will be many fights where you need to Drain Life, and it can be a win or lose if its not pushed back.
---
Spendind the 1200 gold they go for on my server is not something im gonna do lol
---
Paladins already underperform in 2 levels. The thought was to try to improve those two by weakening their good role,and to truly accept the whole hybrid class theme, but yeah, that doesnt get us anywhere.
---
I hate you.
---
Its all about positioning, you can play perfectly but if you’re in a shitty spot you’re gonna have a bad time, be aware of the npcs around you and dot one up and pull them somewhere safe before you fear, if theyre about to run to someone else just use rank 1 curse of recklessness for like 100 mana then another rank 1 curse (or agony) to let them be feared again (usually opposite direction)
---
Eh I mean honestly though... other than fixing problems for players that they could have resolved themselves (by not INSISTING on all playing on one of like three realms for example) what problems have their really been? Some valid complaints for lag in regards to extremely large raids I guess but that's about the only one I'm aware of.
---
That's not what I was saying thiccboi.
---
You're talking about stuff you know absolutely nothing about.
---
Go learn the WoW API and how to code LUA and then come back and talk about it.
---
Till then keep making dumb suggestions.
---
It doesn't.
---
Unless you can basically global the mage before they even react, they’re going to beat you. Easily.
---
Warrior vs frost mage is possible the most unbalanced matchup in WoW history. 
---
Even if you have engineering and they don’t, you STILL can’t win.
---
Definitely start with a few essential addons. Questie, an addon for item's vendor prices, and an item that sells grey loot to the vendor automatically. Those 3 are big.
---
Only need 5 pts in redoubt to tank
---
We had this in vanilla.. it's an authentic experience.
---
I dont know why you would want this. That defense talent isn't doing you much good if you aren't raid tanking - and who wants a prot pally tank that doesn't even have improved righteous fury? And when will you be tanking with seal of command? I realize this sounds dickish but also recognize that you're asking for thoughts on a build that's so blatantly bad.
---
We worked hard to illustrate the service beyond words :D 
---
Hopefully the simplicity will still explain not only how to use our services, but that we're only open 3-9pm server time.
---
Now, I'm not saying that staff of dominance is a hunter weapon but I *am* saying that should a hunter come into possession of one, it would provide him with:
---
- 555 mana
---
- 160 health
---
- 1.4 mana per second
---
- 1% chance to crit for Mend Pet
---
- 40 more healing to Mend Pet (8 per tick)
---
- 40 more damage to serpent sting (8 per tick)
---
- 17 more damage to each Arcane Shot
---
- 13 more damage to volley
---
So... yeaaahh
---
&gt; There was NOTHING compared to this that was allowed in Vanilla.  
---
Yes there was. And all PvPers used it.
---
It wouldnt have been a problem if the policy had been enacted from the very start and with the first waves of free transfers.
---
You don't really need any consumables in Classic. The bosses don't hit especially hard and there are no enrage timers (soft or hard) to worry about.
---
It's a great strength of the game actually, it's very casual friendly unlike retail where you have to grind your ass off AND be exceptional at the game if you want to do the hardest content in the game. It's ludicrous.
---
&gt; we are all in good spirit
---
Of course you are, Priests have high spirit.
---
Here's the full video of it happening! https://www.twitch.tv/videos/507171105
---
POV from GOOF, who personally killed all in under an hour without dying!
---
Or not because the mage just paces and if necessary blocks to survive the 30 seconds and then you’re a free kill again. If you killed a mage, they were a bad mage or way under your level and you globalled them.
---
They targeted an ISP not the server, also if you know wjere the server is located you could guess that they're using the best ISP in the area.
---
The only really underrepresented classes are druid and hunter from what I've seen. You only really need 1 druid and a couple hunters (or maybe 1?) for tranq shot.
---
Other than that especially this early on all classes are represented in minmaxed raids decently. (even hunters at this point)
---
And when is that?
---
That's now how layering works at all lmao. They literally said since before launch that the server cap goes down when layering goes away and queues may return.
---
If he was on the ground, the guards would have aggroed him.
---
It becomes a weird interaction when he's on the roof because the guards can't see him, you automatically become the aggressor if you perform an action back (like absorbing a spell with grounding).
---
I've had somewhat the same happen as a rogue. Shaman was on roof, flame shocked me, I ran into a house. He jumped down and I attacked him thinking he'd have the aggressor flag with the guards, but instead the guards attacked me.
---
No u
---
You have perdition's blade and corehound tooth. One of the best daggers in the game until mid AQ40. You might even outgear him. Ret paladins are extremely gear reliant and don't actually start critting super hard until you clear bwl.
---
Never ascribe to malice that which may be adequately explained by incompetence.
---
So I play Horde on Anathema, which I haven't verified myself but many people say on my server that it is the lowest pop server.
---
Right now Black Lotus' are 20-30G per pop, Arcanite bars about 38. 
---
Tomorrow we get like 5 different servers getting horde-only free transfers to our server. What is your guy's take on the liklihood of players moving here? This place feels pretty empty to be honest, and the ally outnumber us about 70/ 30 split.  All the horde guild leaders actually had a big meeting a few days ago to try to form an inter-guild pact to help eachother  farm stuff for raids, as the wold is about to become very hostile to us when we become farmable for honor. 
---
Anyway given your knowledge and the context i'm providing, you still  figure these are  good investment?
---
No! If you wanted serious PvE you could join faction having paladins. True Horde player doesn't make excuses, so you probably one of thouse ex Alliance retail players, who faction changed to the Horde in recent years.
---
Pre 1.12 wow was alliance dominated anyway wasn't it?
---
That's half the fun on raid days IMO.
---
Yeah but then often the player gets banned for breaching TOS. It’s not worth it.
---
Wow. Just wow. That arrogance combined with that much ignorance is quite something.
---
Ok, boomer.
---
As a melee it's pretty nice. The only downside is if you weaken yourself but otherwise it works in your favor most of the time. Same for the net, it only sucks when I root myself, otherwise I get a catch or it will charge me to the target lol.
---
Explain please
---
What’s the addon that sells grey loot called please?
---
If you're raiding, you're just spamming Shadow Bolt which suppression does not work. Leveling and PvP, 2/5 is enough.
---
Yea, that sounds cool. I personally would add Silithus, Camp Mojache and/or Light's Hope Chapel
---
And, is Questie through Twitch? I’ve got my others from there but when I search for Questie in “Get more addons”, it says it’s not found.
---
Yep, the same. You can search, download and update addons for wow and other games with the Twitch desktop app. It has other features as well like watching streams, but that's basically the only thing I use it for.
---
Classic wow btw
---
&gt;The amount of orc warriors in my guild is comical
---
To be fair, how much of that is due to their racials and how much of that is due to them just being a really badass race for warriors? Kinda like how everyone picks undead for rogue even if orc rogues are better from a minmax standpoint.
---
However if you do want consumables, for a warr, mighty rage potions, major health potions, elixir of giants are some good ones to bring for yourself, at least from an alchemist point of view, not sure about other proffs.
---
Because it's part of collection of complaints people have about classic that get solved in retail that ultimately damage classic. Spy is a solution to a problem which you should really just deal with as part of the game. Much like the absence of a group finder.
---
Does it show where you and your party are on the map?
---
&gt; but I'm not rerolling
---
Thank you.
---
i think that's what happened to this guy, it was too hard for him to farm enough shards so he raised prices a bit :)
---
he is usually open most of the peak playing hours, sometimes during the day too. offers summons to most of the popular alliance spots that are a little bit out of the way  (sm, gadgetzan, DM, winterspring, and prob a few others i cant remember)
---
I got 10 downvoted in this thread for mentioning this as well lmao
---
Then roll alliance next time.
---
4%
---
Who's back? Are we supposed to put on our mind-reading hat today?  
---
It's too meta for me if I have to look through your post history to understand the context of your thread.
---
Magerpain or Docdizzle
---
props man. looks great. ride it in style
---
Sounds about right, got on an abbandoned bank alt 2 weeks ago to check the server out. Saturday night, Ironforge had about 40 people. Went to Stormwind, same deal. I dont regret it. Theres no future for Alliance on that server.
---
I’m a shit head because I mentioned it’s not Gandalf? That makes no sense.
---
WoW is based off WC3, though. No surprise there's overlap.
---
Nope, Zarcy(the tank) got all of them. Gotta get those tank epics.
---
I agree, fuck every single on of them. They are literally the problem here.
---
Imagine trying this hard for fake internet points then having it blow up in your face.
---
Only after 50 I started dropping mobs fast and topping the meters as fury.
---
Glad I'm a healer tbh, people never blame you for some reason in dungeons because they usually don't know you're there as long as you dispel quickly
---
WTB 20 ZKEYS 3 ECTOS EACH
---
Wait, wrong mid-2000s game...
---
Getting some guildies through Onyxia attunement
---
Good luck. When I’m gonna spam BRD, LBRS, UBRS to 60.
---
Yeah actually, we're far from dead and I'd say it feels very alive; I will admit I've started to notice the same names more, but I can't tell if that's just due to getting more involved with the server community, or if it's due to population decrease, finally recognizing massive amounts of peoples names, etc. Anecdotally I'd argue quite alive but VERY outnumbered.
---
An important thing as a warrior is to avoid fighting mobs that are above your level, even if they're yellow. Green is the ideal area unless you're in one of the power spikes warrior gets with new skills and weapon upgrades.
---
&gt;required for all of classic
---
They aren't required. 1/2 of the playerbase doesn't bring them
---
Nice.
---
As a priest with only 1 item from MC I can also easily solo heal it. Especially if your DPS is good, the bosses just melt.
---
&gt; I would make new friends, personally.
---
I love that, lol.
---
If you start playing WoW with (what it seems to be) rl friends and make it all the way to 60, you don't just go "Well fuck'em, I'll just make new friends on the internet!" That is not how friendship works :)
---
Good fucking quit then, you dumbasses transferring ruined the servers in the first place. Little bitches should have went PVE.
---
Maybe op actually cares about raiding though and wants to do their best. In that case using consumables is nice.
---
Damn dude why are you attacking me like this
---
I mean I guess for orbs it's a huge reason people want to go. I think reserving the first orb is fair.. that's 40-60g depending on your server. Some tanks I see asking for ALL the orbs, which could be up to 4 (rare I admit). At that point it's getting a little greedy.
---
But still if a tank wants to make that a condition I'm not going to bitch, I just keep looking. Well to be honest I just take a friend or guildy but same difference.
---
&gt; In PVE we have 40 people to coordinate and if just one person fucks up, it can ruin 40 people's time.
---
Are raids in Classic really that unforgiving and hard to read just by using the normal UI? I know some bosses in Naxramas is very unforgiving, but its also an end-content raid, it should be very hard to do.
---
And maybe raids became harder just **because** addons made them easier to run. If everyone uses DBM, raids needs to be made harder for them to offer a challenge.
---
Yeah because letting them leave is totally not making the problem worse?
---
Im far less interested in pvp as i was when i was younger. But i still enjoy it.
---
And the corpse runs are still worth is comparable to how much flavour it adds to the game!
---
Do you have any idea does Itemrack has some kind of support to deposit/withdraw set from bank? I do have DPS set which I don't use too much. Would be great if I could just get it from bank with single click.
---
Epic Mount is in my bags :) I keep the normal for the memories
---
So what you're saying is that it does what?
---
From the top of my mind this is what i use.
---
Elixir of the mongoose
---
Elixir of giants or juju power
---
Winterfall firewater or juju might
---
Gift of arthas
---
Elixit of fortitude
---
Rumsey rum black label or gordok green grog
---
Stamina food or the +10 str food from argent dawn.
---
Elixir of superior defense.
---
Free action potion sfor gehennas
---
Greater stoneshield potion(mostly needed if u fury tank)
---
Also the elixir of brute force looks nice but it doesnt stack with fort buff or elixir of giants so its pretty useless in raids.
---
Fuck you, quit then you little bitches. You all transferred making the problem worse. It's your own damn fault.
---
I keep my nomod or mod:alt inside the parenthesis (ie: [mod:alt,@player])
---
Also, your first example isn't working because you've grouped your mod to work with @target. Make sure to keep mod:alt with @player to self-cast.
---
When you get your sweeping strikes+WW combo on lock during SM, and the armory gear plus WW axe.
---
You're never a wrecking ball, though. It's punching bag all the way though as a tank lol.
---
Good job soldiers. Gather your strength for the battle has only begun
---
Ah great! I love articles on why something is better for you written by the seller of a product thats related, without mentioning sources for anything they claim proven.
---
 As a priest I think Tri works really well - but you need decent gear to pick up slack. I can heal raids comfortably even with 21 points in shadow. I might have to pop a few extra mana pota but the raid content is easy right now.
---
 Being disc/holy is pretty awful in PvP because you have no offensive capability and you dont have an interupt other than fear. Tri is really nice PvP support spec.
---
Sharpened claws isn't bugged, so it's LotP and predatory strikes that requires a /cancelaura at the time being
---
Hundreds of runs each, lol, they should probably make their lifes about something other than WoW.
---
Elixir of the mongoose to go with the str elixir as well id you have the money.
---
What do you mean? Holy paladin not viable in classic?
---
I saw LF1M Tank Gnomeregan last boss at the weekend, I wondered what they did to piss off the last tank (but not enough to tank for them myself).
---
mate u are a warrior u don't get a seat in this discussion
---
While the other reply here is certainly correct for some circumstances, in particular those when you have a decently geared, knowledgeable and good raid who's got bosses on farm, I'd argue that consumables are important to "fill in the gaps" if some of the above criteria are not fully met. 
---
For a tank, you basically have 2 things to keep in mind - balancing mitigation and threat. [This page](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/warrior-tank-consumables-classic-wow) gives a pretty OK overview of useful buffs, but checking in on the Fight Club discord might be useful as well. 
---
For stacking, things that stack on top of all the regular raid buffs (to my knowledge) are: Blasted Lands buffs (via quests), Well Fed (food), alcohol buff (+15 sta from fishing, +10 sta from DM, easy to get), Winterspring consumables, Felwood consumables and the myriad of world buffs. I'm probably forgetting something, but you should find [this](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-world-buff-consumables#blasted-lands-consumables) pretty exhaustive. On top of that, our warriors usually keep some form of Rage potions and some higher rank Stoneshield potions at hand. 
---
What you realistically will use, though, is probably some food and alcohol and maybe keep those Rage/Stoneshield potions at hand in case you need rage for snap threat or Stoneshield if something goes badly awry and you need some extra mitigation from armor. But check out those links for a more exhaustive description.
---
&gt;Alliance attempted a raid on org last night. Didn't make it past the front gate lmao. Then we counter raided stormwind
---
Imagine bragging about attacking the second most populated alliance city after org gets attacked
---
I’ve been streaming most of my farming :)
---
But I get no cash when I do this. So I can’t buy them. The gold I get from normal herbs is spent on consumables (another investment)
---
No, I mean holy paladin is the ONLY viable soec in classic.
---
Don't see what those points in prot are doing. You won't be tanking shit anyway so might as well invest them in ret and be a weird dps heal hybrid.
---
Still fucking awful though
---
It doesnt matter if it was a shit system. It's a vanilla system so it goes in.
---
It's basically a better, more clean version of the Star Wars Galaxies Force Ranking System. However, I agree that xp based grinds that decay and force participation promote shitty and abusive behaviour.
---
Star Wars Galaxies fight clubs were horrendous. Due to the games design you could literally just farm your friends over and over for XP to go up the ranks.
---
It sucks hard until 30ish. Around 40 you get enough of your kit to feel actually good.
---
It's know as the most gear dependant class in the game for a reason tho. It's a whole lot of standing an auto attacking/missing until you get like some pre-raid BiS. After you get some hit and better gear you generate more threat from doing more damage and it snowballs the better gear you get.
---
You little bitches should have all went PVE. You decided to play on PVP servers, couldn't handle it and ruined two servers now in the process.
---
While I agree with this as a fellow AH goblin, it is worth noting that so many people got the same items/consumables stocked up that the supply will probably be much bigger than demand initially. It's always worth thinking outside the box. There's just too many people nowadays using AH addons and trying to make gold.

Eh they should have kept fears and +undead dmg working on forsaken players.Undead (and Horde in general) already have insanely good racials in PVP, hence gthe huge discrepancy between alli and horde on PvP servers.I'm all for evening up the balance a little.
---
Make friends in the right places...
---
yup, what this guy said
---
And yet the MT in my guild uses Quel Serrar and is not hit capped at all as an Orc. And I have begged for them to take gear checking into consideration.
---
You're being given a bunch of really shitty advice about addons.
---
It's your first time. You want to explore, look around and make mistakes. You don't want to be guided on rails to exactly what you should be doing for the best xp/hour - leave that for when you're levelling your fourth alt to 60 because your raid guilds need shamans or something.
---
So, read the quest text. Enjoy the world. Try all the things and do more of what you find fun. You're a hunter - tame some different pets. Explore the world. Enjoy.
---
I’m on pve server and the only time I got engaged in pvp is when I got charged from nowhere by a warrior 5 level above me. I don’t even remember why I got pvp enabled, some shit with helping some rando in a span of 5 min. Anyway, that warrior got himself killed. Hope he now knows that hunters not an easy frag even 5 level lower...
---
There could be people hoarding a lot when the price is this low.
---
You could probably gather ton of them if you had herbalism.
---
It’s hard to say what will happen with the free transfer. And if the price will go up, but I believe so, since casual people will struggle in t2 raids and above
---
Why not set up hotkeys for your skills though?
---
awesome work !
---
Haha haha haha yeah sure.  
---
Blizz doesn't ban people who buy gold, **AT MOST** you get a mail from Blizz telling you that what you're doing is hurting baby pandas or whatnot.  
---
Do you know what does get you banned, tho? Supporting Hong Kong autonomy.
---
Just go to kayla's youtube channel he has ton of priest macros on his macro video
---
I've never transferred, do you get an option to revert the transfer after completing it? If that's the case, I stand corrected.
---
If not, it's either wait and hope for another transfer, or 2x rerolls on the new one.
---
Its ok but drop the defense points and put those in illumination. +defense is kind of an outdated stat. Any tank that tries to even get close to cap just wont output the threat necessary.
---
Hands down one of the very best pieces od fantasy ever written... up until TLK. Afterwards it gets awful.
---
They are hypocritical bitches. Mages can sell water and ports, enchanters charge 20g for a button click, rogues get tips for LP, herbs and alchemy are skyrocketing, hunters and locks selling blackstone for 20g and elven rings for fkin 75g. Everybody is making money in the way they can. Tanks literally have no methods outside of charging a run, res orbs, or taking trash blues and grns.
---
o.O
---
What he said \^
---
I am lvl 54 and mostly need Blackrock mountain and lvl 55+ zones heavily contested by lvl 60s for grinding gold/mats. Enemy will kill you fir their grinding spot, when all you need are few mobs for quest (Felwoid satires) and ally lvl 60s won't help, because you compete for their mobs too.
---
What unitframe addon is that for your target and your healthbar? :)
---
Remember to save those Rainbow fins for the war effort btw.
---
Of course the horde is getting wooshed by this.
---
Thats exactly what I'm doing is Fel/Distracting combo :D I still have like 4-5 daggers in bank
---
     Do you know what does get you banned, tho? Supporting Hong Kong autonomy.     
---
Big true
---
&gt;I want to see people struggle, grow, learn, get better, become a team.
---
Imagine having this much fetishism for Molten Core of all the raids in the history of WoW, lol.
---
These people became a team. That's why they managed to have enough coordination to speed clear MC.
---
Garr has a soft enrage in that if he's not killed after 5-6 minutes, he starts to sacrifice the minions (they explode)  randomly.
---
Meaning, minions can explode from two events:
---
* Once they are killed by players.
---
* Randomly explode (from sacrifice) 5-6 minutes into the fight.
---
Nowadays, guilds kill Garr before the soft enrage.
---
You can’t contest nodes, you can’t contest quest npcs, you can’t contest grinding areas.... so yeah a lot less freedom and player agency.
---
Rainbow fins are war effort turn in for the alliance fyi.
---
&gt; They deserve to lose subscriptions over this. 
---
Cancel your subscription then :) Bye!
---
Paladin prio!
---
I'm finding some conflicting information about it. I definitely remember him doing that when soloing MC around wotlk or so, and there's even an emote associated with it. But it seems that it's actually based on a time, acting as a soft enrage mechanic.
---
Imagine being a druid complaining about being fully geared, you do that in about 2-3 weeks as a druid. 
---
Friend made a druid alt, got it to 60, went to MC and got 4\8 t1. Both ony groups he was the only druid and would have gotten t2 head if it dropped.
---
Roll a mage, and see how slowly it gears in comparison.
---
They may break, but every functionality in those addons can be made differently.
---
Now, that's a pretty damn good reply.
---
I like your info bar on top, what add-on is that
---
Aye, I was just looking through various sources and it seems that this is indeed the case.
---
Seems like poor planning on the guild part
---
Mage blade is bis for holy, but hand of Edward the odd is bis for paladin aoe cashfarm.
---
Hey man quick question, as we have some issues with copying the sheet. When we copy it and put it into our existing sheet we are no longer able to select class or role on the roster. Any idea why?
---
You should take imp S&amp;D. For PVE it will give you the biggest dps increase. In PVP it is not the best tho
---
I'm a levelling alliance warrior, it's a slaughter rn.
---
Just wow!
---
Please more
---
I do the same and I think it is a lot more fun than drain-tanking one mob (which is incredibly boring).
---
Curse of Recklessness, Succubus out (+10% damage) and Soul Link are the key to juggle 5 or more. ;)
---
Sell them to big guilds at a good rate slightly below market. Nuff said. Plenty of guilds would probably be stocking up and able to cop a stack or two
---
Aye please do, and all of them. Don't want to waste sappers on only a handful of players.
---
I fucking hate you. Why have you done this.
---
But you'll farm DM til you die I suppose.
---
Yes, I used to play a shred spec during wotlk at (relatively) high rating in arena (2k1) so I am confident I'll be able to land shreds on my targets. To me, that's not impossible, it just takes a bit more practice.
---
Considering many $60 AAA titles don't have 60 hours of gameplay in them, it's not that bad.
---
So wait. My +8 spellpower libram enchant occupies some invisible buffslot that can overwrite, in the event that I stack buffs that high, some other buff that might be more "important"?
---
&gt;I love dong
---
Good for you little buddy
---
No no, being capped on defense isn't necessary.
---
You need to focus on threat more. Since you want your DPS to get the weapons from the raid you will want to get QS, especially as a human.
---
Screenshots would be nice :)
---
Wow! Great Word
---
I use DismountMe, and it works great.
---
https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info25201-DismountMe.html
---
Wow what an awesome shot - looks epic !
---
And gz for the mount!
---
epic mount quest is totally long and arduous tho
---
Yes, though I don't think it is an actual concern for casters as much as it is for melee.
---
Take this man to the top!
---
1. dunno, don't think so
---
2. not likely
---
3. dunno
---
4. this week sometime, exactly dunno
---
5.dunno, don't think so
---
6. you bet, everyone gets penalized lolz
---
Not having the time is not the same as being bad!
---
Why are you guys all so mean?
---
For the Alliance!
---
People asked for this and they implemented it. Yes it could have been sooner but this is also a good moment (just before the pvp system launches). At some point you can stop complaining you know.
---
Awesome. Please say you made room for a LCD to be put in the gate, so you can show a video of the portal animation.
---
Lol future bass and slander do not mix, brother.
---
They still heavily outnumbered Horde, at least on Light's Hope. But I feel like that's partly because there were so many tryhard guilds there having played for years together over a lot of pservers.
---
Today is that day. Honor system goes live tomorrow.
---
Brought to you by the same type of raider that wonders why they can't get a raid slot!
---
is this satire
---
Someone needs to tell Monica to keep her guild drama to herself.
---
Your link is locked. 483 cannot be correct though, are you counting some kind of buff accidentally?
---
Nope
---
Hey man, we're mainly focused on raiding but have plans to do regular social events alongside PvP, everyone here is friendly as we're looking for players with the same mindset (we're all adults now with commitments so lets get the content done as efficiently as possible with minimal stress).   
---
Currently 10/10 MC and 1/1 Ony, we'd be happy to tag you in when you have the timeslot free.  
---
Give me a message on here if you're interested in a chat if you think it might suit you, otherwise good luck in your search
---
Because every other server aside from that one 70 percent horde. It still sucks but at least that is playable.
---
my backforong gnomish net says hello with the extra charge, my goblin rocket helmet also :DD
---
Well again I used to play a shred spec in wotlk and managed to hit 2k1 without much effort (feral was my reroll at that time). People seem to be focused on "well anyone competent will face you" but 1v1 is one thing, but certainly not the only scenario I'll be in.
---
It's more of a jack off all trades build.
---
Oh wow that's underhanded so much
---
fire hardened armor and rage potion = fuck you mage
---
(https://ironforge.pro/players/Dreadmist/Xain)[I'm 400 and something with this gear, think around 420 but can't remember exactly. I can get more if I equip the DM trinket instead of the crit one. ]
---
I actually experienced this too, but it only seems to happen in dungeons. It happened in the first room in Scholomance, the patrol just kept walking and pulled 2-3 groups when he decided to come.
---
It's most likely a bug with pathing mobs though, since the open world doesn't have as many compared to dungeons. In the open world they're mostly just going slowly into random directions.
---
Well that's just wrong when it comes to private servers.
---
For Classic, I figure it's the fact that people think Horde is better. They are correct when it comes to small scale PvP, but face a premade and Alliance should win.
---
Maybe the retail players who are 99% Horde played a factor as well, rolling the same faction in Classic as they are in retail.
---
DKs stay and their are an instant point loss. People back in the day competed for DK highscores, and there is no way to remove it. 
---
The point loss is not static, it depends on how much honor you have. And YES, DKs are raid-wide! If some asshat in your raid group decides to kill a civilian, everyone takes the penalty. Not every NPC counts as civilian though, they are marked so you know it before you attack.
---
wat
---
I think it is 45% Alliance and 55% Horde.
---
... years old. Boomers
---
Just use any disc priest from all the classic-websites.
---
They all work.
---
Afaik you cant put high ranking hots or shields on lower leveled players
---
Questie. Leatrix. Atlasloot. Bagnon. Auctioneer. Gathermate if you are gatherer.
---
i think 1 resist is 0.2% chance to miss.. I dont know if there are any softcaps
---
bit you will never forget the moment when you foubd your first epic in vanilla. at least I didn't. From a randrom troll in the hinterlands. Wall of the Deads, still in my Bank.
---
yes
---
It's bis for mitigation, not threat.
---
TPS is the most important thing right now, not mitigation
---
Stalagg was never balanced. Go look back at the census taken a week after launch. There were very few 50/50 servers, with Grobbulus being the one right ik the middle.
---
Is retail gold is only good for cosmetics.
---
In classic its your gear, your consumables your enchants etc. Gold is a major part of the progression.
---
You could have learned a new language by now...but you didnt.
---
Props for the work you put in! I’ll definitely have a look.
---
Here some advices for going public:
---
-	Point out the differences/benefits over already existing/similar addons (e.g. atlas)
---
-	Show some screenshots (maps, options, etc.) so people can get a first glance of what your addon is like.
---
Bagnon, Leatrix, Itemrack, Questie, Quartz, Deadly Boss Mods (Classic), Classic Aura Durations, Classic Enemy Cast Bars, Auctionator/Auctioneer
---
You mind sharing your spec? really interested in seeing it
---
yes those 'dps warriors' should be treated exactly like this ( at low level dungeons ofc)
---
Sorry relevance? QoL as it turns out, is shorthand for destruction of the persistent world. Of course, you would do it differently and you can foresee all the outcomes of your proposals, just like everyone did fifteen years ago.
---
Ian Malcolm wants a word.
---
Now I spammed your message to others so it looks like we're bots, we might get banned dude =(
---
Sunrazor from one of the undeads near lights hope, Got a few hundred for it. But ofc that was back in 2005-ish, I have yet to see a BoE purple while solo grinding or questing in classic, I've seen hurricane and skullflame shield while in dungeons.
---
Hurricane before ambassador in BRD and shield from an abomanation near the end of UD strat, I won neither ofc.
---
Got Shadowfang last weekend
---
I had a gnome mage do this to me yesterday.
---
Didn't realise I could report him.
---
In the past month I've gotten eye of shadow, foror's compendium of dragonslaying, krol blade, jeweled amulet of cainwynn, recipe: flask of supreme power, crusader enchant and my shadow reflector recipe
---
Huh? I was an officer in a guild that cleared everything 14 years ago without consumables and plan to do the same thing this time around. The difference is that it will be even easier now because we're not noibs anymore.
---
Noggenfogger gang
---
Nobody has yet :)
---
Thanks for that.
---
I'm assuming that's including a +30sp enchant? You do have several MC items including the most hostly contested weapon that drops. I can still only count it up to 406.
---
But if you take a different class you wouldn't have that innervate anyway so IMO it is fair to compare the DPS with self innervate.
---
I just wanted to say that theres tons of private server players that know what they are doing. and classic is easier than them. So if u think u are above average after hitting 60 now u will be very suprised at honor system start.
---
Lmao, I wish I could upvote this twice.
---
You should say your faction aswell
---
Not sure how it works on Horde but Alliance have to breath on it after mind controlling a dragon, and it's not easy to solo nor is it easy to find a group without them being on the quest or being friends.
---
That's completely fine man, I guessed from the way you worded your post that you weren't at level cap (and there's no rush to get it).
---
I'll PM you my ingame name but I'm in work at the moment
---
Why are you only listing negative things as instructions to beat someone else? Doesn't seem very logical to me.
---
The server is 50/50 faction wise, but Alliance is a lot more organized and friendly with eachother than the Horde guilds.
---
Great, then you don't have to download it...
---
Is this "nomod" an addon?
---
If you’re playing a meme spec you might as well try and be useful in some way
---
Ret paladins can perform decently if you *really* put the effort in. Will never top the charts, but I pull 400dps on bosses in MC.
---
The main thing is they need to bring every single buff, every single potion, and a flask to every raid. And then, only then, are they mediocre. 
---
I have 26 buffs when in raids.
---
Yeah, it's gonna be rough for a lot of us.
---
There's a map addon for atlasloot.
---
No. MS is a priority debuff and takes a valuable slot. With bad gear, it actually does more DPS than 1h fury. However, not being able to use MS will diminish your DPS significantly.
---
If i farm it enough at some point i can afford it lol

no one says anthing about "tauren" - hunter?  really? :D
---
Devilsaur leathers went down to 4.5-5g. Instead of farming devilsaurs, I find farming something else, selling it and buying leathers instead is kinda faster.
---
Yeah, you take fights when you vastly outnumber people or when they are clearly not ready to fight.
---
I've had this happen in SM Armory. I shot my gun at the patrolling caster NPC who casts Fireballs. After shooting I immediately ran around the corner to block LoS. She just kept on walking to the next pack of mobs and when she got there, she decided it was time to attack. Of course she also brought the other pack with her.
---
If "Killing flowers" gave me the sama about IRL as it does ingame then i would do that as well.
---
Imagine the smell there
---
Bullshit. You can buy wow tokens for real money in retail, then you can sell wow tokens on AH for gold.
---
Interesting. Please test if MV allows you to take boats and zeppelins without actually being on board!
---
That this build is terrible goes without saying, but what are you trying to achieve with this? What's your goal? Like what content do you want to do and what type do you want to do it as?
---
ok jackass
---
No, learn alchemy + herb or mining + engi
---
You need 1 person with skinning per raid and 1 leatherworker for each specialization (3). This combination is too popular for new players and won't make much gold in the future.
---
Wow we have a sherlock here? I didn't really complain it was more like a mention. And People here are very helpful. Besides you really. So gtfo pls you POS
---
I never have any laggs. I just disconnect. My games just stops working smh. However when I restart the game it works instantly again. When I stay inside thé game it will continue not doing anything for 2-3mins before DC.
---
Me everytime I get ganked in STV.
---
Yes. There is such an obsession with different kinds of efficiency. F.ex: gold/hr, exp/hr and of course the never ending chase for bis's.
---
A lot of people treat it more like a business career than the beautiful world that it is.
---
A lot of hours. But also hard to say, since I sometimes go afk and do other stuff and come bk when its about to spawn
---
at this point i'm pretty sure you don't even have to know what spell batching/netcode/latency/jitter is in order to know that the servers are broken as shit and world pvp will be the equivalent of some fucking photo album on imgur if they don't actually do something about it.
---
Farmed them
---
The other classes dont really want it. So if you have a ret pala being useless in your raid might as well give him Sulfuras.
---
When I showed my GF the South Park episode I was a little shock to learn that oftentimes I sit even worse than that guy. I don't have back problems tho
---
Upvoted 'cause 32:9 🤩
---
It's still an investment, my guy. He just invested time instead of money.
---
If they get the openener you are dead.
---
If you get the openener there is a small chance you win.
---
If no one fights no one dies.
---
You can gamble that the mage isn't going to attack you but that is a risk I would not take. Dodging all fights untill level 60 gives you no experience in pvp and you will get a hard time later on. You cannot play a PvP server without ever having to pvp.
---
what was this book again? i remember seeing it on some show.
---
Yes in order to Keep other Gold selling down. 
---
It is like legalizing drugs in order to destroy the black market. 
---
Blizzard is smarter than most countries
---
Let's test that the.
---
State the locations of the mecha chickens in classic.
---
I think the zones are Tanaris, Hinterlands and feralas? But where in the zones are the chickens.
---
Also i am unsure about feralas or if it is a 4th one.
---
They were pretty decent in tbc/wotlk at some points.
---
&gt;Do DKs go down over time?
---
The count? Don't think so.
---
&gt;the DK system going to be ultimately retired like it was in retail (and it was scrapped before the release of TBC if I recall correctly)?
---
No due to #nochanges. It was removed with TBC as the honor system got overhauled.
---
&gt;What's its impact overall on your honor? Is it a 1:1 ratio?
---
A lot more than that. You will really feel every DK that happens. 
---
&gt;When is the honor system getting released exactly? I've heard it's this Thursday.
---
Thursday yes, worldwide. First ranks should then come with the resets (Tuesday/Wednesday)
---
&gt;Is there any way to remove your DKs?
---
Don't think so.
---
&gt;ven how difficult it is to avoid DKs when trying to invade somewhere like say Darnassus or Stormwind, will EVERYONE be penalized for DKs when someone pulls non-hostile targets, or just the guy who pulled/killed the non-hostile target?
---
Everyone in the raid or if you collaborated with the person getting the kill (healing). I wish it was just with killing blows, but it's a credit thing. 
---
Now, I got a faint memory that *civilians* (the NPCs that give DKs) do not aggro on themselves (they need to be attacked) and they may be resistant to AoE, but I can't remember much. 
---
DKs are a disgrace.
---
first of all the linken quest for the prebis offhand
---
the nifty stop watch quest in badlands
---
the luffa in LHC
---
the quest to kill thaurissan without killing the princess (gives a really nice ring)
---
MC and ony attunements
---
Grobbulus.
---
It's still good for grinding, but pretty useless in raids.
---
Show her the Karazhan Crypts
---
It's a weird combination imo because a bad spec has to try really hard to be at the level of a casual player playing a comparable good dps spec.
---
Mage here. 
---
Mages counter warriors, so they are gona test their "skill" on you. 
---
Shamans counter mages, so they will test their "skill" on mages.  Legit nothing I can do (unless I one shot the shaman). Between 6 sec interrupt, a grounding totem, the same burst as an AP mage, and healing.
---
God im not the only grandpa fooling around here
---
Sniper OP
---
I have found only one crappy blue off hand while soloing. Still have my epic mount with farming other things though.
---
Thanks, I'm glad I don't participate in invading enemy faction territories then, cause I would still like to go to BGs. I have no PvP skills, so a DK situation would hit me hard :p
---
I wish that would exists on my server .. I would like throw gold in your face everyday to get to BRD etc.
---
Join your server discord. Most of them have a guild recruitment channel
---
no one cares my dude
---
How did they fuck it up now?
---
7 have the option to go back
---
2 have no option to do anything whatsoever barring starting a new character and abandoning their current one.
---
Honestly, if they'd rather leave him hanging they're not good friends.
---
If you are planning to raid, you should get: aggro meter, decursive, healcom, dbm.
---
I didn't know you could do it through twitch. I use the minion 3 app and it has same effect though
---
Accurate
---
Ye imagine being proud of winning 1vs1 as rogue in 2019..... This video is a joke.
---
In dungeons. Seriously. Do dungeons, meet people, get to know them, do more dungeons with them, become friends, join their guild. Now you're in a guild with friends you enjoy playing with.
---
 Im on mobile at work so its tricky to link you, bssically take Inner Focus/Meditation, Holy Nova/faster heals and Silence.
---
This is the answer.
---
Currently I'm herb &amp; miner. Let others sink their gold into crafting proffessions &amp; wasting time on farming recipes. Someone will need to buy mats anyway.
---
Not enough dead wolves.
---
Change “gnome” with “undead” and you’ll get the same perception from alliance’s perspective. All undeads are bound to be gankers in the future. 95% times I am being ganked it is an undead.
---
Same happened to my group yesterday, both dal'rends, only 1 warrior in group, and he had them. A Paladin got the Main Hand.
---
TY sir !
---
Shit you guys have two????
---
Most people just do tailoring to 300 to craft themselves the gear they need and drop if for a better money making profession.

Something irrelevant to this post, I've got a HP laptop - i3 3110M 2.4ghz, 4g ram, intel HD 4000 graphics

Do you think i will run wow classic at low-medium graphics and decent frames? Anyone with same specs and feedback?
---
feralas yeti cave
---
hinterlands island in the lake near the slimes
---
tanaris dunes/mountains near the zone border in the south east
---
cheating though because i did them a few weeks ago. wouldn't have remembered the tanaris one otherwise
---
So Horde Transfers are still available for Heartseeker but Alliance isnt?
---
Be honest, how many of those did you farm on that morning when the they rolled back the servers evers 3 minutes for 90 minutes?
---
My raidleader...
---
To be special capped, sure. Your rage gen will not be near enough with 6% hit however. Miss chance for white hits while dual wielding is 24% afaik. White hits are still your primary source of damage even excluding rage gen, and your WF attacks will miss like crazy with 6% hit.
---
Sure you can utilize the heroic strike /stopcasting to alleviate this, but it's generally not your average warrior will pull off with great success, and it's still entirely luck based to get this effect on WF procs.
---
At the end of the day 2 handed is simply the better option, DW gets a fighting chance with BWL/AQ40 gear for warriors as you can easily cozy up to 13-15 % hit and have a very steady rage flow without bending over backwards sacrificing other stats for hit.
---
2-handed fury with WF using BT and WW on cooldown and fishing for WF with hamstring inbetween is going to outperform any dual wielder, get a BRE and you'll blow everyone out of the water.
---
What everyone else said, its poo.
---
YOU LIKE TO YELL I LIKE TO YELL TOO YO DAWG I HEARD YOU LIKE YELLING ME TOO BRO LETS BE YELLING BROS
---
Well to be honest, I really dont care about ranks this time around. I dont have the time to grind them out so I will definitely raid enemy territory. World PvP is insanely fun, way more than BGs imo, and as I dont care about ranks, I can collect DKs.
---
This should read.

Fair enough. Apparently this was changed in [patch 1.9.0](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.9.0), which was when the Gates of Ahn'Qiraj started.

---
2-3 mobs. dot 2, drain one. after its dead, send pet on mob 2 and dot mob 3. dots are the majority of your damage, if you dont spend all your mana shadowbolting. can keep that up for \~3-4 minutes until your pet is dry and you have 10% life and no mana. 
---
you will not drop life or go oom by killing only 1 mob at a time, but its also slower and waste of mana because the mob is dead with your dots having 50% or more time left.
---
Except spell cleave only became a thing in classic with the undertuned dungeons and mob tagging doesn't exist in classic, nor was it ever viable on pserver freshes. Every tryhard warrior on pserver freshes was leveling by questing.
---
Afaik there arent very good mh axes until BWL, so I dont think it's a dps loss.
---
Yea, the only thing you have is the Dunning-Kruger.
---
Overall most Paladin talents are weak, so this might work just fine.
---
Do you think it will run wow classic at low-medium graphics and decent fps? Anyone with same specs and feedback?
---
It's always nice to get reassurance that you're not a *complete* weirdo and you have kin in this world.
---
I'm not strictly against the DK situation, but it does indeed sound like it could do with some serious re-thinking. I certainly hope civilian NPCs are resistant to AoEs, cause otherwise it's going to be a nightmare when the *invaded* faction can use AoEs but the *invading* faction can't.
---
One change that I'm on the fence about is how it's going to change wPvP. My brother (who plays on a PvP server) tells me stories about how horde clear out alliance towns and then hold it for hours on end. For the most part this won't affect me, but there HAVE been times when alliance come to horde towns and clear out a number of NPCs. It's annoying but it does certainly offer an *interesting* change of pace.
---
But then, the game offers no real alternatives to what could be done with civilians (I mean they could make an item that would allow you to 'bind' civilians, so they can't be used for quest purposes, but would avoid the DK situation. It would be one way of keeping DKs in case someone decided to just go nuts with civilian NPCs, but also a way to avoid DKs while giving the other faction the power to 'unbind' a bound NPC in the event of them recapturing the territory).
---
It is the truth. If you cant deal with it so be it.
---
I'm just here to say that baking salad is a crime.
---
It should always be toasted
---
&gt; You can enter BGs either way. DKs dont prevent you from that.
---
I know, but I mean I'd like to reap the rewards without the added difficulty of DKs :p
---
Beutiful!
---
Its repeatable to its used every damn raid
---
What makes you think that?
---
Can't see my spellpower enchant on Staff of Dominance
---
It already glows purple
---
this makes me want to play daggers
---
I have viskag and brutality blade but man daggers pvp looks so much more fun
---
My cat started playing WoW and has already outleveled me, should I euthanize her for putting so much pressure on me?
---
Well, I will get my gear through PvE so I dont really need the rank stuff. I'd rather raid the alliance than grind for hours on end, there is enough grind in this game as is - no need for another one, I am not 14 anymore...unfortunately :P
---
Check out SWGEmu if you wanna relive some of those memories :)
---
If you're gonna offhand a sword use mirahs song at least, dal rend oh blows if it isn't paired
---
I'm amazed and a little glad that I still see people asking when the summoning stones will be fixed, or yell at the paladin to taunt.
---
Don't worry when phase2 hits I'll just reroll and play on an alt
---
Good. I once lost that carapache to an idiot low IQ druid who either thought he could sell it on AH or craft something with it. Little did he know that it's exclusively a mail/plate craft material and its BoP.
---
I hope the shame haunts him for eternity.
---
It's not the client, it's the serverside with so many Security checks that you cannot parallelize everything 100%. So throwing more computers at it won't help. It's basic CS.
---
Yeah I was being as positive as I could with enchants and the best +shadow wrath wand available. Either way there are some numbers off.
---
That’s gotta be a dope place to be as Alliance though, constant activity
---
I recently rolled there as well. 26 so far
---
1. no
---
2. no one knows this
---
3. if you are ranking and you get a dk it's like losing 10+ hours of work
---
4. thursday
---
5. no
---
6. yes, don't join groups with people you don't know if you don't want dks
---
Passives = not affected by talents. Somthing that makes your blocking better won't end up effecting the passive +24 points.
---
Why is there an up-side-down exclamation mark? Is this Madrid? Are we Spanish now? Do I get a free siesta and sombrero?
---
I think it's pretty funny how now everyone and their guild seems to be happy to transfer off busy realms, but at the start of Classic, everyone was like "OH YEAH, FREE TRANSFER? HOW AM I GOING TO GET MY WHOLE 10 MAN GUILD TO TRANSFER? YOU SHOULD'VE ADDED MORE REALMS FROM THE START, F U BLIZZ!"
---
I feel attacked and I don't like it

&lt;Stroll&gt; is looking to recruit some RP interested players. We are a small guild but have collaboration with some of the bigger RP guilds. We host regular casual events, at some point the goal is to have a raid full of RPers. We like to help out new players aswell, all in all a very casual and relaxed environment! If you like to meet up IC let me know and we will work it out! :)
---
It will run
---
Is the ubrs key needed to enter bwl?
---
PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD UPLOAD THESE TO YOUTUBE!!!!

I mean, whoever wants it, and wants people to help them pay for it.... Isn't a "team player" either, are they?
---

That's 483 for pre raid bis

Did you buy your epic wolf too? I bought mine and I want the raptor but idk if I should waste the gold on it since I already have my epic
---
Alliance has racists? Since when? I play consistent with my fiancée and everyone has been very kind and no bullshit to be found in trade/LFG chat.
---
How our people counting such ludicrously high numbers? With an enchanted mageblade + mana cord and mostly pre-bis I'm at 346 unbuffed according to Deja classic stats.
---
Im raiding as ele. One of very few on firemaw(Eu). Content is so easy in the first phases so guilds arent really "tryharding" yet. If you do find a guild that lets u go ele be aware that loot aint all that easy to get. Theres only deep earth shoulders and t1 gloves and maybe t2 that will be easily obtainable. Aurastone and staff will most likely get prioritized to restos and mage/locks, and the other SP pieces are super contested.. Its also super consumable heavy, so u better grind those demonic runes and stock up on major mana pots.
---
On the bright side, elem gets better every phase, allthough it wont peak until you get ZG/AQ20 gear.
---
Pretty greedy too, in my opinion. In that case, you practically reserve all orbs in what, 90 % of runs? Strat live does not generally have a lot of gear loot to offer, so I can see why people think reserving two orbs is pushing it.
---
We tried the same on our server but as soon as we had 300 people in orgirmmar the servers died. Not fun trying to pvp in a slideshow.
---
Thanks :)
---
Imagine being stupid enough to still think this.

Fucked to use simple logic to avoid a scenario so unnecessary that a child could have figured it out?
---
Fucked to understand that this was and is always going to happen?
---
What sort of sheltered world have you been living in up until now?
---
One mage used a major Mana pot on 4H so they gkicked him. You didn't hear about his famous guild?
---
damn, all that drama for a lvl 23 dagger XD I was thinking maybe deathcharger's reins or something else really epic but not, lvl 23 dagger XD
---
Some people are pathetic (not you OP)
---
And here i dont even bother since every zone has several people doing circles all day plus couple just camp spawn points. Fucking sucks
---
Same for you, the problem is the lack of parallelization and not hurrdurr blizzard can't code. I can code a shitty serverside code with no security/authentication protocols and you can run 400vs400.
---
You don't pay the enchanter 20g for the button click you'll pay that enchanter for farming his ass of for that recipe and not unlearning his profession for a more profitable gathering profession once he enchanted his gear. I'll pay my enchanters 10g minimum for every endgame relevant enchant. A crusader or +healing on weapon? Much more. 
---
Same for rogues. Always pay your service people well. Then you don't have to spend hours looking for them when you need their help. 
---
Goes for real life too. Yes shes a maid. Yes its not the most glorious job. But someone needs to do it and the least you can do is being polite to them and make sure their compensated for their work.
---
&gt; turd burglar
---
XD XD XD XD
---
&gt; And given what you said you’d be a complete asshole in that situation to hog the Innervate for yourself just to be slightly less of a joke.
---
The funny thing is that locks work in much the same way, but the important distinction is that it is up to healers whether they want to give lock their mana. Also I think the conversion rate is much better, since one big heal can fill lock's entire mana pool.
---
Works, sure, but its far from optimal. The core things you miss is mortal strike, without this you cannot kill a healer unless you crit the shit out of them and they dont fake you. With mortal strike you just wear them down eventually.
---
You also lose piercing howl and improved hamstring which are huge in PvP, especially imp hamstring.
---
But you can definitely get by as fury in a bigger group where other people can make up for what you lack.
---
Define normal...
---
You probably shouldn't include professions in your example when tanks can get those just fine.
---
Rolled NE for priest just for the shadowmeld/MC combo!
---
my brother did it back in vanilla, and I believe he'll do it again in classic once he gets to level 60. What he did was he got another account, levelled the character to about 30, and then bought gold.  He bought it on his CC, so was protected. He did it about 10-12 times in Vanilla, tBC, Wrath, and never had an issue.  He then did some enchants for characters on his main and gave good tips, bought stuff on the AH for inflated prices which his main account had posted, and never had an issue. 
---
I had a right go at him at one point in vanilla, because I didnt agree with him!
---
they should be doing faction-specific login queues to maintain a ratio of at minimum 40% for the weakest faction.
---
That would also discourage people from creating the imbalance in the first place
---
Put that monitor higher!
---
I thought after 40 it was kind of fun, but with 60 and decent gear its great. Just.. painful until you get to that point
---
use felstriker / bonescraper then when you get perds go perds / fs then go perds / cht
---
Congrats you are now a bear tank. 👍🏽
---
What's the best place to farm Golden Pearls without fishing?

inglorious basterds
---
It’s too early to raid as anything else but combat, and if you’re combat you take a weapon specialization. So no sense in not using the same type in both hands. Not to mention rend’s is only bis because of the set bonus. If you’re not using both there are better weapons.
---
Your options are keep both rends, main hand fel and get a super fast off hand dagger for more instant poison procs, or off hand fel for something that’s 1.8 speed with more dps and take a reduction in poison damage.
---
Oh im sorry but none of them speaks orcish. Theyre my friends from Zandalar

We've got an arms warrior in my guild who insists he does good damage, it's like he doesn't understand everyone else can look at the damage meter....
---
Can anyone share experiences with 2h fury for pvp?
---
server is 80% horde...
---
Regardless of what a lot of people will tell you bear tanks are great tanks. Maul is the best single-target threat generator in game. You can pull and Line of Sight mobs using Feral Faerie Fire. You want to usually use Enrage before the pull and if you want you can Regrowth or Rejuv yourself, shift into Bear for 10 instant rage (If you specced Furor) then start tanking. Obviously multi-target you want to swipe, but sometimes you want to make sure you alternate targets and use Maul. This ensures you maintain aggro. Use Demo roar when you have multiple mobs and remember Challengeing Roar for AoE Taunt. Don't forget about Feral Charge either.. helps with Interrupts and getting to mobs faster when they are plowing the healer.
---
You will do fine. Tank dungeons your level not below. Bears when you hit 40 and get Dire bear are VERY tanky..
---
Didn't think his comment would need an /s but here we go
---
I didn't think it was possible to want backpacks more than I already do... Awesome artwork my dude.
---
&gt; PvE to PvP is bullshit and should not be allowed
---
I fail to see why. Can you elaborate?
---
it should be going into snd for pve not remorseless attacks
---
I am going to hit 34 when I have a really good blue slow 2hand and test again.
---
Man, this isn't working for me. Deleted my 60 priest, logged on my other account and tried to create a new toon with the same name as the 60 priest, but it says the name is unavailable. Did you do anything differently? Im waiting for a few hours to see if things change now
---
ISP is just a company, you target the company you damage the servers that company hosts.
---
Some ret pallys I know respec to raid and then to farm when they know that they'll have time to make it profitable, but if you just want to make gold I'd recommend just doing repeat dungeon runs with a competent group. Strat live is quite profitable between boss loot, orbs, and 50s-1+g vendor trash if you find a good group
---
What’s the SM portion stand for again?
---
Guilds pick up a fuckton of mats in a single MC clear. The idea that members should be submitting fees on top of that is a racket and no one should join a guild with such a silly requirement.
---
No good raid is going in by the elevator
---
If you want to go the long way, yes, just as you can enter MC through BRD if you feel like it. Once P3 is out you will have to complete a quest that requires you to interact with the orb behind the last boss in UBRS. After that you can simply teleport inside by tapping the orb in the corridor next to LBRS/UBRS portal.
---
You need to add another 3 pages of mrglbrgl. You can never agro just one.
---
Dont do recruiting channels. Run dungeons and make friends. Good players and chill people are always being recruited. If a guild spams lfg for members they probably arent good. 
---
Afaik all the best guilds on my server use closed invites of friends or dungeon standouts
---
Druids are great at classic PvP, in WSG you are simply the best flag carrier there is. You can shift form from cat to bear and are harder to kill than others. Also you can sneak into bases and grab flags. 
---
in AB, you can guard bases, prevent flags being capped, sneak around to cap other flags. 
---
In AV, you can cap towers, tank the mini bosses and stealth to get GYs deep in enemy territory. 
---
Druids are brilliant fun in PVP. 
---
Regarding professions, I dont think its really necessary to go eng for pvp, unless its all you are going to do and you are aiming for rank 14.  I got two characters to rank 12, playing a hunter and shammy, and neither had engineering.
---
also understanding your opponents abilities, spec, and cooldowns
---
Elvui, you can edit everything just everything
---
What are you even talking about? Felstriker has a higher damage range than the shanker.
---
&gt; I didnt agree with him! 
---
Bringing your real life time into the game, disproportionate with how much time other people might have? No problem.
---
Bringing your real life friends into the game, disproportionate with how many friends other people might have? No problem.
---
Bringing your real life money into the game, disproportionate with how much money other people might have? Immoral!
---
I saw someone mentioning roots. What do I do if he dots me up and applying Roots vs my catform? It will be super expensive shifting out of all roots.
---
No, but you need to enter UBRS in order to get attuned for BWL.
---
How edgy. It nearly convinced me that you're a real though guy.
---
You don’t ever wanna hit full energy or quasi full energy. If you’re about to be a gcd away from a second skill’s worth of energy and can’t get the backstab in, best bet is to use sinister strike instead.
---
They started classic with both items and talents reworked. Items and talents are waaaaay better than they were when MC was the endgame content in vanilla. We are basically playing with catch up mechanisms online for the first few phases.
---
Just as a quick example the mageblade from MC did not have 40 spellpower before item rework.
---
Shadow Mastery (2nd last talent in the Affliction tree)
---
Yeah, need details! :)
---
Barney is planning his revenge as we speak
---
It’s ok, the new meta is to lie about stream sniping. They are thinking ahead.
---
I just read that in Meatloaf's voice.
---
Back in the day, he would have made a great commercial for Kul' Turans.
---
Iv noticed that trend with scholo. That once a certain item drops your cursed with being 2 or 3 more. Its one of reasons i stopped doing that dungeon
---
Masterchef pure marketing cookbook.
---
totally agree. We had a right fight over it...and in my immature days, I used to threaten him that I'd report him! haha
---
Sounds like that was a....*broken alliance*.
---
2 Mindflay spots but no shadow word pain?
---
Thousands of gold? It goes for 250g on my server
---
by virtue of being the only one who is boomkin
---
well the moment that made me make that post he was at 16 energy so I don't think it's cap related
---
You see, if this rule is there from day one then why not. But faction imbalances were there in vanilla too.
---
Changing this now out of the blue would kill the gaming experience for those playes in a way that has not been expected. We already have faction specific server transfers to help the issue.
---
They dont want to take you because Arms is dogshit on single target, AND takes up a debuff-slot with Mortal Strike.
---
This so much. Got into my current guild because of friends, and the people in the guild were their friends so ofc we got along; I invited a couple of my friends and so on. Now I'm in a guild in my preferred role, with an active discord, and people I enjoy playing with. Its smaller than my previous guild but we are literally always doing things 
---
Our main tank is also that guy that tries hard with 1000 consumables without being a neckbeard about it. He just sees it as the MTs responsiblity to be the most prepared guy in the room. 
---
Honestly this guild took my classic experience to 11
---
How rich are you people
---
But you miss out on the ID and gear.
---
You're server has few people buying gold then it seems, forrors goes for 400-600g on my server.
---
Thousands of gold was more so aimed at collectively saving thousands of gold for multiple people saving themselves from buying this shit weapon.
---
If you're top 3 with 350, then your guild has bigger problems than you being Arms...
---
I might be able to help you but it’s 4 am here and I’m too tired to do a play by play. xD Maybe tomorrow.
---
who cares item is trash
---
probably nothing. Many tanks quit if they dont get the drops they want.
---
Ah, yeah. I knew about the catch up stuff. That's a side effect of the version they are emulating to be honest and it's still technically vanilla/pre TBC. Same with items having later patch stats. That's still all vanilla and not beyond it afaik.
---
Personally, I dont see any of those examples as even close to what removing the pvp honor system would be. A perfect 1:1 vanilla emulation patch by patch wasnt ever really going to happen, it doesnt mean huge sweeping changes should suddenly be okay. Imo anyway.
---
Mommy people are playing the game the way they want, how dare they. 
---
Thats all I read from that post. I leveled my warrior tanking but if people dont want to they shouldn't need to just to please you.
---
That tank's name? Albert Einstein
---
&gt;rogues get tips for LP
---
Do you have any idea how ridiculous it is to compare this with any gold making method? That 1g tip won't get you far, people don't have a lot of loot boxes, and rogues who can pick locks are everywhere.
---
Leatrix is better.
---
I like NDui, it works out of the box without any further configuration, and it has many useful things built-in such as omnicc, chat class colors and timestamps, auto junk-vendor and more.
---
I'm lucky to get a spot as a resto druid in a raid, let alone a boomkin. They were super fun in TBC but just not viable in classic imo
---
Don’t worry. I spammed you back ;)
---
Every class can stun you but only three classes can fear you. If you take blacksmithing as a 2nd profession you'll get a 30sec fear immunity trinket you can use against lock/priest/warrior as well as the pvp fear breaking trinket. WoTF is good but resisting one in three stuns can be game breaking. There's nothing like a rogue suddenly unstealthing behind you and just standing there trying to work out why his rupture button isn't working.
---
Okay I'm mad
---
Nobody is talking about Honour being removed. We are talking about one of the BGs being introduced a bit earlier.
---
Sheep are dumb animals.
---
You can dual wield death bringer top which has the highest 1H damage of all available 1 handers ATM.
---
They look better than any other disgusting race in the world
---
its real? it looks like it could fall apart, why would anyone make a single volume so large
---
&gt; How likely is it for me to get picked up for mc as An ele shaman assuming My character is ready
---
&gt; 
---
MC has been out for quite a while, there is no reason you shouldn't get picked up.
---
I used to play mage, but now I play a warrior.
---
:(
---
1. Tauren Druid (stealth class, offtank, healing, pvp, bgs)
---
2. Troll hunter (pet class, dps)
---
3. Undead mage (caster)
---
4. Orc warrior (main tank)
---
It’s just a bit of conversation mate, you can relax you know.
---
&gt; ye you will have fun and also 4hours+ MC.
---
sarcasm?
---
reroll on their server and have them boost you
---
If you can get them while still lvling, they are definitely worth it imo, on lvl 60 I wouldn’t buy them
---
This is the dumbest theory I've ever read about any subject, ever (sorry)
---
Pretty much the stuff I take to every raid. Also FR jujus if you're horde. (I heard they stack with totem but not with the paladin aura)
---
And reckbomb Horde scum in wpvp
---
If you are a hunter or druid you have the chance to gear up fast in raids. If not have fun with your devilsaur set for the next months
---
You get honor from players up to 12 levels lower. For max level players that is 48.
---
Awesome choice! Bear tanks are so fun and don’t let people tell you they’re not good
---
or you just press one of your raidmarker macros :P
---
&gt; No min/max or old vanilla guild will take you with them. For most old players (including myself), shamans are healers. The other specs are useless.
---
&gt; This has changed in recent years and there are some guilds taking enhancers or ele shamans into raids. Most guilds are lacking shamans and the totems are already worth the lack of DPS.
---
The exact opposite. Min/max guilds will take you because they recognise the game isn't as hard and know exactly how much dps you need to do to kill the boss.
---
Commence lag.
---
Me
---
Always wanted to heal so now I do.
---
"We" being who? I havent seen any mention of BGs in the comment I replied to and your initial reply. Semantics at this point either way to be honest.
---
If you are serious about pvp you definitely need engineering. For example reflectors are a must. Depending on your spec you can consider BS immune fear trinket and Enchant tanking trinket. You can get enchant trinket and then drop Enchant for engineering for example and I think it's the same for the BS trinket.
---
Alchemy is a useless profession since it doesn't bring you any benefits and you can always make your consumables craft by you guild alchemist or friends.
---
Also engineering is kinda cheap to up.
---
About potions yes they are a must if you want to grind pvp ladder like you can't be a competitive FC without FaP potions for sure.
---
If you are casual just enjoy the game and do whatever professions you like and don't use consumables in bg.
---
Also since he's elemental he doesn't get the extra flurry uptime provided by windfury crits.
---
I had a hunter twink using nightblade for fun. Who cares about 20 agi  when you get to trigger everyone in your BG instead.
---
They use the Tram?
---
I don't play Hunter - so someone correct me if this messes with your pet dynamic. If you're in a dungeon and the party wants to jump off a ledge to get from one place to another - dismiss your pet first. Otherwise, it'll take the shortest path to get to you, which normally involves running through the entire dungeon (and pulling any enemies with it)
---
It does though because apparently when an enemy comes into your range, you can see them "gain" all their buffs on the combat log, which Spy can pick up to detect them.
---
I've noticed countless times Spy detecting a player on a flight path. To me that's undeniable proof. On a flight path, you're not casting or doing anything. You could be gaining health passively like with Fel Armor during tbc, but I don't know of any such spells in vanilla, and it's different classes each time. So Spy really does detect someone without any activity other than them moving around.
---
FAP AND GO
---
I play my main from back in Vanilla which is a Priest, but TBH, although i love priest, i'm getting bored. I'd love to play something else, not sure what though.
---
I'm only level 46 and can only do about 2hrs a night due to family duties so can't really start to invest in something else
---
\#FuckMages
---
why does no one name and shame these days?
---
to prevent someone in a similar position also wasting their time can you kindly share the Realm and Guild name?
---
I uploaded a screenshot on Curseforge, thank you!
---
Man I remember cata pre patch and every pala spec was broken af. Especially shockadin... Ahhhh dude that was so fun leveling
---
If you people claim to know so much about world of warcraft then why can nobody answer these simple questions of mine:
---
What colour is Sylvanas's titty milk?
---
What do Jaina's toes taste like?
---
Which race has the biggest penis?
---
I'm also on Benediction horde :)
---
The whole comment chain is about BGs being released early.
---
But okay, its just "semantics" xd
---
It's about 45/55 ally/horde on Earthshaker. Really like the realm even though I'm "forced" to play horde.
---
If you are scaling your game in windowed mode a lot, elvui is not for you. Breaks at every sizing. Bartender works nice. I've added WeakAuras flashing icons for crucial things like lacking buffs or counterattack skills when available.
---
&gt;so that the server doesn't get super unbalanced
---
That horse has already bolted, retired and has been made into glue. Servers in question are already very heavily imbalanced, so Bliz is trying to prevent an almost complete loss of one faction. While trying really hard to pretend that no such problem exists.
---
You will never know
---
Raina! 
---
When BWL comes out talk to Vael!
---
Devilsaur is BIS for rogues until you have nightslayer gloves and bloodfang pants.  
---
Nightslayer pants + gloves are better than devilsaur but are more like a sidegrade damage wise, you just get more stam and trade hit for crit (worth it, just not by a lot).
---
Did your friends give you a heads up that they were transferring? When I was on Whitemane, transfers were opened temporarily and my entire guild ended up transferring after a number of group polls and in-game discussions. 
---
If your friends gave you the heads up and you decided to stay, that's on you. If they all transferred and just figured you'd sort it out, you need new friends.
---
In hearthglen

TIL an hour and a half per day is 'incredibly obtainable'. I feel old now.

Horde on overpopulated servers: HAHAHA RED IS DEAD FUCK OFF IF YOU DONT LIKE BEING CAMPED FOR HOURS EVERY SINGLE DAY!

Also Horde on overpopulated servers: Where did everybody go? Guys come back I need you to farm honor! Come be a glorified NPC!

this is a YOU issue not a ME issue
---
CYKA
---
This is true I must say as an undead Player. 
---
Though it is more so that gankers  are bound to pick undead
---
Posture.
---
Not quite though is it?
---
Because Blizzard is not selling Gold. They are selling Tokens, on which People can spend their own earned Gold. 
---
That way they even reduce the Gold in the economy because they still take the auction house cut for the Tokens bought. 
---
It is more like:
---
"Because some People get high - let's sell tickets you can purchase for 15$ which you can turn in for 13$ worth of cocaine. But at least ist legal" or smth along those lines. :D
---
That takes the Need of goldfarmers to farm Gold because People will pretty much just "legally" buy the Gold from other Players. And in return Blizzard reduces Gold in the economy. 
---
Such smart
---
If that's the one with shadow damage I think its pre raid bis or at least was
---
is earthshaker a decent realm now? 
---
i transfered my 60er priest there to play with a different group of friends after my first group quit. the server felt so dead, ah was slow and my 2nd group quit too. the guilds at that time were so scuffed, horrible recruitment etc. so i just abandoned the char and rerolled horde to play with my current group.
---
i miss healing a bit now since i switched to warlock and would play it as alt if the realm is alright now.
---
talk about over regulation, at a certain point you have to be thinking its just a set of rules so only a select few can thrive
---
It's insanely unrealistic for you to do it solo.
---
That's fucked I'll need to go there at 60
---
1) Sylvanas never got to the stage of producing milk
---
2) Blueberries
---
3) Gnomes duh
---
The only thing I would pay for is HoJ or Briarwood. Both of them take way to long to get unless you are doing guild runs. other than that id just grind the rest. For raid gear its a different story considering the only thing I would buy would be a weapon but at the same time no one sells weapons so.
---
I personally despise ElvUI, I gave it a spin this time around and spent 2-3 hours trying to set it up and make it nice, minimalistic and generally useful, but ended up getting rid of it. Now using:
---
Bartender, Shadowed Unit Frames, Grid2 (+HealComm), Quartz, ClassicCastBars,  OmniCC, TellMeWhen, Titanbar with plugins, Details!, ClassicThreatMeter, Bagnon, Prat3(or whatever version it is nowadays), BigWigs, Fishing Buddy, VendorPrices, Auctionator, Questie. 
---
Modified to make the UI as unobtrusive and minimalistic as possible while maintaining good functionality. Happy to provide info if you have questions about some particular addon.
---
 He probably is using only flash heals which is not as mana efficient as slower heals. If he knows he can get an innervate he does not care about efficiency and can healsnipe everyone gets no overheal and at the same time tops the meters. Does it make sense? No. Will he be number one? Yes.
---
I don't think your comparison holds at all. I could log onto OSRS a year after I last logged off, and I could expect to see maybe 10-15% inflation and some new content updates, but apart from that, it would be mostly the same core game.
---
I'm not under the delusion that my account is eternal (nothing is), but the fact that Jagex have at least established a track record of being able to preserve and maintain their game without butchering it for 6-7 years now is a very good indicator of game longevity. On the other hand, Retail WoW completely refreshes itself every expansion pack (every 2 years?) such that you might as well not have had an account leading up to it. A fresh player buying a level boost is given basically equal standing as longtime veterans (in terms of gear and access to new content) once the new expansion goes live. That's the polar opposite of OSRS. The OSRS community will repudiate any casual-friendly updates that make the game easier or "faster".
---
No idea, but it’s where my friends are.
---
I spent 350g on my devilsaur set at 53 and 55 respectivly, to buy it now with how cheap it is is 110% worth it even if you replace within a week or two.
---
there is also another delusional part of the community that thinks blizz does not do anything wrong ever and if something bad happens, it is because they listened to the community.
---
you cant really win with these special people, just shake your head and move on.
---
I PvP as Fury all the time and it works great. Everyone is always meh towards it but I slapped the shit out of a 60 Druid and 60 Rogue just last night in a 2v1 so I see no problem with it.
---
I have had the devilsaur set since week 2 and have still not replaced it despite raiding every week. Was well worth the gold.
---
I've been playing since launch with only main - 53 right now, hope to get to 60 in a week or two.
---
Might as well be on the same faction lol.
---
Such guilds are more in the e-peening league. I enjoy handing out 10-50g a week to know that we can buy couple ingots every week for the eyes we farm. The more hammers we have, the longer the e-peen.
---
And that comment is a reply to talk about BGs.
---
And no, the difference between the subject of our discussion being "lets introduced one BG earlier" or "lets fucking remove the Honour system" is not semantics. 
---
Its actually baffling how this sub is actually a fucking trashcan compared to the ingame community.
---
Just Leatrix plus doing all the things... I downloaded LetMeCast the other day, not realising I can just do this in Leatrix. Will have to check it out
---
Keep in mind that, while leveling, the skill you trained last is probably the best. Same goes for shocks, if you just trained Frost Shock it actually does a lot more damage than Earth Shock for a few levels.
---
definitely at level 31 when I got carried through my whirlwindaxe-q and finally got that sweet axe :D
---
No, as he said - quest xp turns into gold at 60, so questing for gold is quite profitable, but can only be done once.
---
based on the fact that 300 resistance is 75% protection against a level 60, 1 resistance point is about 0.25% chance to resist. Some effects are non-resistible and will only have a chance to have their damage reduced, though, in which case the damage will also be reduced by the same amount(on average).
---
So 35 shadow resistance should give you a 8.75% chance to resist a shadow based spell.
---
I thought it was Gloom weed myself, so let's go with that. 
---
In Hilsbrad you are tasked to go to this human settlement + a mine to kill several named NPC's in a long quest chain. How many named NPC's were there in total?
---
I don't have a full answer for you but I tested it once for myself with two shields. They had similar base block value but one had a ton of +block on equip, amounting to nearly double the block value of the other shield. 
---
I was mostly interested if it affected the dmg of shield slam. Think I did like ten shield slams each and both had similar damage averages. So at least it seems it doesn't affect that.
---
&gt;Mograine
---
Ha, I started on Auberdine, but even if I was over excited by Classic, I've stopped to play. I don't know if it's me or my memory but what I remind was by far much slower to pex. Strange!
---
Imo it depends on what you want and how much time you want to invest in your ui. If you want a simplistic, clean and functional ui I suggest elvui/tukui or other addon packs.
---
If you want to have a highly customized ui, maybe something more visually appealing, i would mainly use weakauras2 to create the ui. Maybe use elvui  or bartender/bagnon as a base you can build up on.
---
You can go all out wit weakauras2 and be very creative and get something like this.

---
ye ,and  it is the same with the casual retails. the truth is in the middle, it is not as good nor as bad as people claim for both versions of wow. the downside is that it ruins any decent discussion since people either dont have a clue or think they are absolutely right which makes any attempt of discussion pointless.
---
My interest is mainly PvE (raids and dungeons) so i won't get to reckbomb much :)
---
That‘s why you build your own group (with or without reserving) as a tank or never join a group if there is some one hunter/warrior/rogue that can roll on your stuff.
---
Undead super ugly,
---
Tauren = ugly fat cows,
---
Trolls : Just tooth.
---
I think orcs are best in this comparison
---
Because you're a little bitch that can't farm them alone, so you don't have the right to them. YOU also chose to play a tank, nobody fucking forced you, so do your job like everyone, and split loot with everyone.
---
Because he wanted to do an actual BRD run?
---
Dps difference usually is marginal on single items, but if you use subpar gear in all slots you’ll quickly notice. Devilsaur is the best investment a fresh 60 can make.
---
Ya i got the Cad armor last night after 15 runs, and 1 dropped for me and 1 dropped for the druid.....like what are the chances
---
Improved Righteous fury might be needed to have any Threat
---
Go play PVE servers then you stupid fucks. You ruined these servers by being little bitches who can't handle PVP/
---
That's in the combat log which spy uses to know someone is nearby.
---
Any of you play vanilla? You’ll be fine
---
Get to 60 before doping that
---
~~nerfed~~ fixed
---
How prophetic. Never been attacked by an alliance alone unless it was a rogue.
---
What is the best tanking weapon atm then?
---
dumb question. what happens if your rank drops then. ive heard it can happen which is weird to me but what if im a rank 14 and i drop down to a rank 10? can i no longer wear the tabbars i got or use the mount i got?
---
Had a rogue attack me he was 60 I was 39 gouge him cause he didnt 1 shot or stun start running away he mounts chances me as he gets to me stealth turn around sap him /laugh and walk away never saw him again
---
"yeah that 34 Undead Mage was totally asking to get killed. I'm not a bad guy..... right?"
---
They won’t do shit.
---
They’ll tell you to use the item restoration tool. You won’t find the item there because it’s not sold or deleted. 
---
In vanilla they mailed you the item if something bugged. That service is no longer there.
---
Plenty of fury warriors take 4/5 imp bshout in order to grab piercing howl. It has a lot of utility, even in pve.
---
&gt; 1) Combat you are engaged in.
---
&gt; 2) Combat one or multiple of your party/raid members are engaged in.
---
yeah lets make and update a graph and do a connectivity check on every line in the combat log, the servers will handle it np
---
It’s not hard at all... helps to join a guild that role plays. Basically just pretend to be your character and get in their head.
---
I never said that was semantics....do you struggle with reading comprehension or something. Jesus christ.
---
Also, yes..this entire comment chain between 2 people represents the entire community. Nice leap in logic there. You have been the aggressor  here, not me...
---
Imagine being this triggered by reddit comments lmao.
---
the last hallway between spider tank boss and thermaplugg is a struggle, someone always bodypulls the whole instance
---
I used LUIv3 for years and loved it but it's pretty resource heavy if I remember rightly. Use elvui now and it's just easy in the sense that if you don't like something you can change it
---
Which server?
---
Play whatever you have fun playing.
---
You picked the wrong faction deal with the consequences or reroll pve.
---
yep, so leveling might be quite the challenge since today :p
---
I plan to sell them and buy Zulian Tiger or raptor. If it drops and I dont win
---
druids can do everything, god dammit
---
This isn't completely true. The green level is dynamic, depending on your level. For instance, it's something like 5 levels at level 10 and 8 levels at level 45 or so, not always 12 levels.
---
And there is a lot of extensions for it. The one i use and love is benikiUI.
---
No 2x 35 for transmute
---
You're actually better at making money than you are at making gold.
---
Can you farm 200k retail gold in 2-3 hours?
---
You can definitely make $20 USD in 2-3 hours, and that's at minimum US wage.
---
In classic you can't officially buy gold, but it's a similar story if you turn to a gold buyer.
---
Vanilla I was a night elf hunter and druid. Switched to horde half way through BC.
---
Classic, I rolled an orc shaman. Played shaman, but tauren and it was never a vanilla shaman.
---
I sort of regret my choice. 60 now, but barely touched him because people are not going to invite me to groups unless I am resto. I don't heal. 
---
So I went ahead and started rolling an alt to save me the time of not getting into groups.
---
Do you! I started leveling a mage for the first time in 14 years. I’m having a blast! I normally main a bear so it’s a complete 180.  Sometimes change is needed. 😬
---
Aside from performing better, in what ways is a porsche better than my minivan
---
Implying warlocks care about being the bad guy 😛
---
I work from 7am - 3 pm, so none
---
"Rolling for OS."
---
I don't think the game even gives that information to the API.
---
I don't recall any addon existing with that function in any patch before blizzard implemented into the base game.
---
Did she see the "you've looted xxxxxx" notification in chat panel? Tried disabling addons?
---
All casual games are like this. For example mentioning kids/wife is super common in the HotS subreddit.
---
It's funny because Freeze Mage vs. (Control) Warrior is also a lopsided matchup in Hearthstone, only that it's vastly in the Warrior's favor.
---
The faction I'm playing on has no lionheart helm yet, but opposing side does. Should I expect to pay epic mount money to buy it from opposing faction? How would it even work? Would we need to buy and sell on neutral AH at some off time?
---
Sylvanas is your fault. Learn to raise your fucking children so they don't become spoilt death night lich kings jeeez.
---
I don't remember poisoning any dog :D 
---
But sorry for the question if you are playing alliance xD.
---
Very late into vanilla when it already didn't matter
---
Dunno. I've made 1500 gold give or take doing tinkerer + herbs with no rotgrip. so probably less than 300 more than 150.
---
Meeting stone**
---
I know, was just speechless
---
That's one of the many options Leatrix has.
---
Ret and prot pallys counter rogues, more news at 6
---
I bought some thorium and an arcane crystal to transmute and make a nice little 10g profit. Then I accidentally sold the arcanite for 66silver. Instead of 66 gold. Should I just delete my character?
---
Ok Boomer
---
I have a theory that at this point people do it just for the reactions in the comments..
---
There is a nice UI called LortUI it just turns the original wow interface into a black one. At curse you can not find the classic version since the developer doesn’t work on it anymore. At the same page, in the comment section, you can find the link for the classic version made by another dev. It works fine with dominos/bartender and other addons. 
---
Other interface i love is ELvUI with BenikiUI. It’s a complete UI and y can change and configurate everything.
---
I don't know *how* to rush to 60. Last night I explored the emo barrows in fel wood and got 1 bar / hr fighting through there...
---
Bugmen rise up.
---
What class has pink color scheme in raid UI since you are horde and paladins have pink color?
---
It might help to know basically no one RPs all the time. Dungeon runs and raids are often not RPed, guild talk may or may not be depending on the group. It’s usually more planned events and small random encounters. Just like improv, you just roll with it and react in character
---
RIP fat guy
---
Are you not 60 yet in game? You can see it's 48 + for green mobs if you are. The second link you posted goes up to wrath or cata levels so I'm assuming they changed things there and it's not accurate to classic
---
Faction change ? Why. Would just offer you a transfer to a server where horde need helps
---
depends. Lets say op is playing a mage, id be pissed if we just had someone log in on a raid night every few weeks and roll for the same shit as 9 other people that play more and contribute to things outside the raid.
---
Pvp server. And competition if you see my streams
---
wow ui addon are you using for the bottom bar?
---
Just so we’re on the same page, I was more or less bragging on your accomplishment. Can’t tell you how many hours I’ve spent with your node locations paused in P1 of your lotus farm videos. Thanks!
---
I would say the only fight you really need it for is Ragnaros, but then you might want to be resistance capped with buffs (315, I think?). Since you're offtanking it might not be that crucial, though, as you'll only be tanking for short periods of time when the MT gets yeeted across the room, and the extra bearform HP might alleviate the extra burst.
---
I also want to know haha
---
Shoot till oom and afk or feign and drink only 2 ways
---
Lets duel :)
---
See, thats why I always manually check if the item was actually transferred to my bag or if it is still in the corpse of the mob.
---
Shit happens, make it a habit to always check and go on.
---
I hope this is just a bad joke
---
Im a rogue and im using spy aswell, its excellent :D
---
Yeah its totally doable, my guild ran with 1 pally heals and 1 pally tank, 8 dps.
---
Nope, NA alliance on Blaumeaux.
---
Yeah, hard now with more limited time to play, I have the same issue as you, probably 1-2 hours a night. 
---
I hope it works out for ya!
---
Its a good thing theres more to pvp than damage.
---
Usually if i wait until the stun in gone i am almost dead and bleeding. If i just blink out of it i have no way to stay in his deadzone and do stuff. If i stay still for a little bit i get either charged or mauled in melee. I don't think spamming Fireblast and Cone is the way to go?
---
Yea well good luck finding a reasonable group willing to take a rando fresh 60 to pug.
---
He could just be stupid
---
Maraudon or dire maul, even though you don’t have mining or herbalism, both farms are still very profitable and you can sell the blackstone ring from maraudon or get lucky and get a tome from DM.
---
When bgs come out, i will not try to play them like a 1v1 duel so theres that.
---
How is "Head of Alexi Barov" an alliance quest when as a Horde player, its pvp against an alliance base in Western Plaguelands?
---
Tip for mobile users in general:
---
Reddit is Fun is better than the official app
---
Interesting comparison. 
---
Frostbrand and Windfury are both inconsistent, in that they have a chance per hit to proc. While WF has a 20% chance to proc on hit, I'm not entirely sure about FB; I've seen people mention that slower weapons have a higher chance to proc, and that the weapon speed should be multiplied by 15 to yield the proc chance (so for a 3.0 speed weapon, you'd have (3x15) = 45% chance to proc on hit. 
---
Damage variation between the different weapon Imbues has been tested before, here're [Melderon's findings](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mkM9osebqWXWKdJhr8CkhcWa7tcK0ZMlmNdzr7h9KBA/edit#slide=id.p22). I didn't bother watching the video even though I probably should, there might be more detailed info about the conducted tests there - but he found no significant difference between the weapon Imbues when looking at different weapon speeds, and further claims to find no discernible trends. 
---
Also, relating to your hypothesis regarding WF and daggers, there's the question of which specs actually would be using a dagger? Mostly Ele or Resto shamans with extremely poor AP levels, I'd say these both benefit a lot more from either FT or FB, which both scale with +sp (15% and 25% respectively). 
---
As pointed out, it may be difficult to get a fair comparison given the last-level-trained differences between Imbues.
---
Bofa
---
Your best bet is maraudon. DM E is really good with mining, but not very good without it.
---
Didn’t start til early TBC but *always* played Alliance DPS classes - rogue was my first, but also mained warlock and hunter at various points between TBC and BFA, and always had a mage alt. 
---
Now I’m maining a horde warrior and plan on tanking at 60.
---
I don't think so! Look at the height of the guards at the steps, then back at the horse and it's rider. Proportions compared to the actual building look good to me! (pretty big building).
---
Could maybe be scaled up *slightly* but you'd be nitpicking
---
It can be reversed
---
Whoa.
---
Yeah I thought the same! Ty :)
---
Engineering would be a good choice. You will always have to drink after 2-3 pulls anyways. Best just get highest quality water and bring mages so you all drink together.
---
According to this survey, people are split 50/50 on whether p2 should be released or not, so I guess the timing is very good.
---
No, it's not *literally that* since taurens are taurens and wolves are wolves.
---
What are FAP prices going for on your server ?
---
We didnt. All the ally transferred off to heartseeker and pagle
---
Played shaman in classic back then, now a huntard and warlock. Obv. Horde as before... I don't like the alliance.
---
You know you can make a character on Stalagg and check out the city yourself?
---
A shield and fucking tank
---
Happens to me all the time, not sure if it's an addon. If I'm start an action, then click on a mob, it shows the mob doing that action.
---
I'd say raiding with people who don't move out of the fire is a bad idea in general. Multiboxers can move out of the fire too.
---
you get either 11 or 12 of the stats, so 12/12 is ideal version.
---
Not a protein paladin, but I have done dungeons with plenty. Your options are judgement of wisdom if the fight will last a bit, and knowing when you don't need to drop full consecrates. Ie, get a threat meter and if you are way ahead of your dps, you can just auto until the thing dies. But in general, every 2-3 pulls sounds right. That will probably just be a reality of paladin tanking and one of its main weaknesses.
---
How do you spend that much?
---
If you need me, I'll be walking around in searing gorge at level 48 getting wrecked.
---
Good tanking sets have like 330 defence, very far from 440.
---
Love this. Laughing at the fact the artist has got the dwarves doing all the bitch grunt work whilst the humans just standing around chatting.
---
Some guys pvpd in gadgetzan and they both die one to the enemy one to guards. I resurrect the guy from my faction and guards attack me. Why?
---
ill get you 1 orb, thats it. the rest are going round robin with yourself excluded
---
in the miracle that 6 drop you can get a 2nd one. they dont drop nearly often enough for any tank to demand all of them
---
Yeah I should probably start leveling that. Tailoring kinda slowed it down.
---
I was confused but I also never saw bags open lol
---
It sounds as if he is asking if some addon shows what loot the boss drops when you kill him, not what the boss's full loot tables are. 
---
And to my recollection, no, but it could perhaps be linked by the ML or someone else checking out the corpse. If there is an addon like this (which automatically reports it when you inspect a boss corpse, or which can do it at the click of a button) I'd also like to know. I'm getting this same feeling in some of our raids, and there's no talk about it on Discord (other than "We've got item X, start the bidding!").
---
What a new idea, wow
---
This is exactly why I had no interesting in taking the eye when it dropped. Is the paladin a PvP? Doesn't appear that way. Is he a mouth breathing imbecile according to the posts? Come on... Holding the hand of rag just makes people froth at the mouth and no matter what you do you're bad and an idiot.
---
The rogues gear is AMAZING..
---
First time I've seen a black Chinese dude
---
We have an officer who has been in a hospital for a month now.
---
Your guild is trash. You find a better guild.
---
No, they need to reduce the player counts by three in that case.
---
Signup for list.
---
THANKS F... GOD!!
---
you get a gold? im lucky if someone gives me 10s
---
https://youtu.be/MuTshid9m6E
---
Please don't state things as fact,  when you don't know.
---
Never created a human character...
---
Had this happen in DMN. Won item,  had space, didn't notice it wasnt in my bag until I zoned
---
No one has so many bags at the beginning...
---
and T2 legs for priest bis for whole game. A lot of items are bis for a loooong time. And even usable (not better) in whole naxx.
---
to get to beast and drak?
---
even if no one needs the items its free money
---
Some people just get really weird when they get a kid. Always a group of people in every gaming sub circle jerking about them being parents that also play games.
---
Devilsaur specifically is super worth. Hell I'm a tank and wear that shit.
---
I **love** your work. For the last 15 years,  whenever I play I try to imagine what the area *actually* looks like. I think the Tauren and Night Elf starting areas would be really cool to see in full scale. The tangling leaves and roots of Aldrassil/Shadowglen, the moonwells and wisp lights, with the spider cave wayyyy off in the distance. Looking out of the cozy settlement of Camp Narache over the sweeping plains of Red Cloud Mesa with the colossal brambles wrapping over the mountains in the distance.
---
What I love about your Shadowglen poster is that it's not how I pictured it at all and it's neat to see what others experience when they're in the same zone. Wailing Caverns and Road to Brill are my favorites of yours I think, because they really give that atmosphere and scale the game lacks. Seeing WC in this light makes it feel a lot more like an adventure I want to go on rather than another instance.
---
I'm about to start my own UBRS run as a tank and i have no clue what kind of setups people run in there.. ive seen people do it 6 man and some 10 man so what should i be looking for? is it a place where you can fuck up easily as a tank or will i be OK without knowing anything?
---
My characters name is ThreeTwoTwo and there is a guy named omniknight on my server who is a paladin.
---
Maraudon or the usual farming places in mornings.
---
You melees should stop moving around like headless chickens while fighting and stay close to the "melee out" spot. Awful....
---
Sometimes when another player tries to loot it, it interrupts the automatic transfer to the winner. The winner must therefore loot it from corpse manually.
---
It's a bug. Gotta be observant and work around it.
---
This has to be a troll account lol
---
This guy commented on my post that mob tag leveling IS NOT POSSIBLE IN CLASSIC even though there are simple to find videos on it as well as streamers doing it. I go to his post history to see what kind of person im dealing with that can't look up info himself,  to find this post. Either successful troll or 13 years old.
---
If you are using a bag addon make sure all of them are open. Every once in a while I accidentally close one and find a bunch of items I’ve been missing
---
Then maybe they should stop using a fucking 2hander to tank. Healer going oom halfway through a pull because "I do more damage like this" fuck you.
---
Lol who's complaining? Why did my answer offend you... I'm literally just answering a personal question.
---
Kills to level
---
Facepulls, wall angels and some stretches would be ideal.  All that will just cost you five bucks off of Amazon for the band and ten mins
---
Shite meme
---
The same can be said for any speedrun. It's not faster to spend thousands of hours playing SMB1 to get that 4:55 run, but people still want to do it. It's about being able to say you're the fastest in the world at doing something.
---
Oh my gosh! Gloom weed! I haven’t leveled an undead since vanilla but that brings me back! The abomination that patrols between brill and deathknell area? Dang man
---
So, welcome to the grind. I hope you have a seal, it makes everything smoother when making groups. 
---
For you, there are 2 runs: jed/rend runs and fill runs. 
---
Jed/rend runs are usually 7 people, sometimes less. 1 tank, 1 healer, 5 dps. As a mDPS, you want true strike shoulders, fap tend, etc. as a caster, you hope for a trinket from Jed. 
---
Full UBRS continues, you want a full 10 people raid here. 1 more offtank, . 1 more healer, rest dps. Ideally you have 2 mages at least for poly morph and 1 Hunter for kiting.. Final boss drops great items for a tank and any melee
---
Jed/rend runs are usually 7 people, sometimes less. 1 tank, 1 healer, 5 dps. As a mDPS, you want true strike shoulders, dal rend, etc. as a caster, you hope for a trinket from Jed. 
---
Are you certain you want to keep these professions? Enchanting won't make you any gold if you don't have rare formulas that get you nice fees, and tailoring is useless until ZG for the most part. I would suggest dropping one of them for mining and spamming DM E.
---
You're in a video game subreddit.
---
It was the first thing that came to mind after i thought a bit.
---
Maby you can awnser that Named NPC question tho?
---
He's a clicker
---
Heartseeker is very far from dead stop trying to lie
---
You might as well get used to it, now that pvp starts this will be common place.
---
Also when you roll a warrior, you should accept the fact that you're going to get shit on, since your class is trash.
---
It should show it as long as it's up to date and other raid members have updated their raid frames as well (all addons should be using the same module for heal comms, but it's been changed recently so it really needs to be up to date).
---
Then blames the tank for not holding aggro.
---
Well gehennas is probably the worst of the worst when it comes to prices, so don't use this server as guidance to investing.
---
ty
---
It's the stereotype effect. Not all rogues and gnomes are pieces of human shit, but the class / race attracts those personalities.
---
People didn't give two shits about flasks except for their tanks back in the day
---
You can clear naxx without dps/healer flasks np
---
The offhand is the bane of my existence. I've had many many tanks ninja it.

I feel this comment was more to QQ over shamans haha.
---
Although i feel for you, glad i rolled UD mage.
---
More like finding a well paying career, but one that you do not want.
---
It's not FREE exp, it's good exp per hour, big difference.
---
So 3 months of phase 1 and less than 2 months of phase 2?
---
Then you should just set up situations where you can generate an immense amount of rage.  I found that in SM lib and arm you can pull 6-7 guys and just spam swipe on gcd and deal obscene amounts of damage.  Going to pulls of like 3 feels so rage starved.  Maybe things will change at higher levels.
---
This. lortiui, I've been lazy and haven't updated it in forever...

Damn that's rough...

You're still gonna die to a fap if you don't know what you're doing.

Hurricane off a gorilla on the big island east of the bloodsail buccaneers area stv. Vanilla, on my paladin while solo grinding.
---
Where's my floating healing text
---
thats exactly where i m right now. Fresh level 40, its okay for me to be ganked here and there from a lvl 50+. But realy afraid for Phase 2 feeling like i will be camped 24/7 from high level guys :(
---
???????
---
What rep?
---
Is this why the horde group up in a raid group outside low lvl dungeons and gank lowbies all the time? Its always 30+ ?? lvls VS 5 low lvls.
---
He wasn't ret/prot? No way a rogue should beat a properly specd paladin.
---
A flask was never a requirement in vanilla.
---
Yeah I agree they should keep it and that there should be a period where wpvp is the only option for honor. How long that period should last though is debatable imo because the game has been figured out and I expect there's gonna be a lot more farming happening than in vanilla..
---
Yeah I think your 'location' whilst in a dungeon doesn't move.
---
Hence why Questie will show all the quests inside a dungeon as being on one spot. Since all locations inside the dungeon just point to that spot.
---
Devilsaur leather per minute is lower than "silk cloth farm in SM until you buy a leather from AH" per minute.
---
Un'goro is just a waste of time if there are no devilsaurs alive.
---
As an undead rogue God I love this
---
Here is a link to wowhead with all the information and blueposts as sources.
---
https://www.wowhead.com/news=295960/classic-phase-2-arrives-november-12th
---
I simply Googled "WoW phase 2" and this was the second link that came up. Took me all of 10 seconds. This is one of those things that takes less time to Google then it does to type up a reddit post...
---
Pretty decent is putting it mildly.
---
At the prices you mention Devilsaur is definitely worth it... however at 350g for the set (which was the price on my server until just a few days ago), no way.
---
I also bought Tarnished Elven Rings (20g each), Blackstone Ring (15g), HoJ boost (100g - took 49 runs), and I think all of them was well worth the money.
---
Also cashed out 350g for Krol Blade, rather than competing with the entire server for a 4% drop rate Dal Rend.
---
One of the best 1v1 classes beats one of the worst, more news at 11.
---
Last time we got census data, pretty much every PvP server was more Horde. Like 60-40 in Horde's favor.
---
2 in is pots + swift pocket watch trinket from Badlands quest, took a few min to get to quest giver in LBRS solo as a Warrior.
---
Hand of rag is prettybmuch defaulted to ret palas and enhance shamans.
---
For other classes it's just not worth as it will be replaced much sooner.
---
Well I remember for sure the first time I tried to exit this Abbey...
---
&gt; Everybody is making money in the way they can. Tanks literally have no methods 
---
You may not know, but a tank can be an enchanter or alchemist and make money with his profession, like everyone else does. Money won with portals and lockpicking doesn't matter at all in comparison to normal farming (and no one ask money for water).
---
230+ at ding
---
Yeah no, it doesn't happen. You wish it would, but it doesn't.
---
Me, a druid of culture. 
---
"ah I pulled while my healer was oom"
---
*Casts Innervate*
---
Nothing wrong with this moment :) #forthehorde
---
30/21 is still viable for occasional dungeon tanking and makes raid healing a lot easier. I'm one of our MT healers and this spec works perfectly fine :)
---
You're not even close to as low as OP...
---
One free Action Portion is 4g 90 in your Server?
---
I put both my legs on the desk actually, my back dosnt hurt, i think its damaged at this point
---
It's 10000% about faction loyalty and people coming from retail. I love PvP and thus wanted to roll alliance, but I was out of country when the game came out and when I got back ally friends were on horde so here I am. But yes in premades alliance has a an absolutely massive advantage between humans and paladins.
---
Holy shit, this is gorgeous.
---
Ruhe in Frieden mein Brudi
---
&gt;Then maybe they should stop using a fucking 2hander to tank.
---
Then you can't hold aggro from overeager DPS.
---
The funny part is didn’t the guy try scamming him out of loot?
---
desolace is a good option
---
Gear and buffs and consumables. Most newer guilds would probably take the adds out one at a time. My guild is about to use their same strategy but only because we’ve been clearing MC for a couple of months and have gear and are looking to get faster kills.
---
Took them 15 years, but they are adding them in retail finally. Also other back customization options according to the BlizzCon panel.
---
In vanilla and retail I was always a human hunter, ever since classic I decided to try an undead rogue and I’ve never looked back
---
Why did you just type all this out lol I don't care.
---
Bravo
---
People that care about speed running or rankings.
---
There are some bag addons that will bug out until you “clean” your bags. Then they show up, might try that.
---
All that try.
---
I mean, you just invented a DKP system.
---
I found a guild like that but sadly the guild died even before anyone reached 60... Most people haven't been on 1 month+. Everyday I login I am the only one literally at lvl 47. There is only 1 member higher level than me at 48 lol but he hasn't shown up in ages either.
---
Most still have layering
---
Played a human prot pally and troll holy priest in Vanilla. Only the priest ever got to raid for obvious reasons. Mained the prot pally from BC onward after it became viable.
---
In Classic, am maining an undead warrior. Learning to Stance Dance Revolution.
---
What's your definition of free exp, then?
---
Having a mage AOE shit down while you sit there and watch is as free as it gets.
---
When geared only Patch, 4HM and final 2 need a Flask (mainly from tanks and casters).
---
On sulfuron which is still layered, it’s 900 golds. So it’s probably not linked to the population and more on the type of population I would guess
---
daríng today, are we?
---
&gt;!
---
Nomod means no modifier like alt ctrl or shift
---
because BG queues in P3 will be an absolute nightmare
---
&gt;QS = just looks, it actually sucks
---
It\`s actually OK. Lots of white dmg means lots of aggro. And you aren't gonna be def-capped with current gear.
---
I’m a fury warrior who focuses solely on PVE. If you take howl over 5/5 BS, it’s a giant mistake.
---
You’re basically saying no to an additional 58AP bonus which is another 29 strength, equivalent to another strength boosting consumable (ROIDS, EoS, Juju Power).
---
Don’t take piercing howl.
---
This is absolutely delightful 😍
---
And for levelling you basically multi box and see mobs melting before your little chicken army.
---
&gt; Dal rends are a huge dps loss 
---
Vs what? It's not like other non orc warriors don't have them as bis.
---
Alliance is still better in PvE, not to say that horde doesn't have it's niches in certain fights though like Viscidous.
---
I think that's more like tipping your server $.03. make sure they know you didn't forget, but definitely you shorted them on purpose. $1 could have just meant you though it was. A $5 or $10, or you are broke or mathed wrong and ran out of money.
---
When I was a kid I hated gold buying and any p2w mechanic. The outer layer was this whole morality shield (there was even this socialist undertone to it, like the online community was supposed to be pure of the rich man's power) but inside I wanted the only way to get power in-game to be by spending time, which I had loads of, especially on vacation. So nowadays when I see the antigold crusaders coming out all I can think is that they have more time than money and thus they want to gatekeep.
---
Never had good BoE drops that I could sell. However I have been extremely lucky with my BiS items from dungeons. Got pretty much everything in just a few runs. The only thing I got unlucky with is my ranged weapon. And as a hunter that's a pretty big bummer.
---
&gt;Do note, none of these specs become viable until AQ when you have enough crit chance on your gear.
---
But why? At lower gear levels,
---
\- Poison damage is still very relevant, favoring speedy weapons
---
\- Gear with +dagger skill is available, so Weapon Expertise (or being human) isn't mandatory
---
\- Finisher damage is relatively high
---
\- Weapon damage is relatively low, so Backstab's +210 static damage is more impactful
---
\- Improved Backstab is more efficient at lower crit rates
---
Daggers in general (and SF Daggers especially) should be /more/ competitive at lower gear levels. In pre-raid gear, especially when sporting [Distracting Dagger](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18392/distracting-dagger), a [30/21/0](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/30532310205105-32030500200501) build\* easily has 5% higher *sustained* DPS\*\* than Combat Swords.
---
As long as +dagger skill is readily available, Combat Swords has Sword Specialization (3-4% "white" DPS) going for it, and SF Daggers has higher poison and yellow damage (higher DPE courtesy of Improved Backstab, higher CP generation as soon as base crit is &gt;= 20%).
---
Of course, sustained DPS doesn't matter at all in those high end, sub 30-second MC parses, so you'll never find a spec w/o Adrenaline Rush there.
---
\*) this has 3/3 Imp. Evis, 2/5 Lethality, and 2/2 Imp. SS, so switching to a Mace/Fist Weapon/Sword still yields *very* decent DPS, essentially Combat Swords minus Weapon Expertise
---
\*\*) simmed for 40 DPS weapons, 1000 AP, 20% crit, 10% hit including talents
---
&gt; if you don't have CC
---
That's a different problem.
---
...to shreds you say...
---
I'm pretty sure you're not alliance bro
---
Meh, 80% of our officer rarely even do dungeons because we are all full pre raid BiS.
---
My understanding was, and is, that it does not x-talk - if they did, there'd be no reason to have both. 
---
But if your whole guild uses Details!, I don't see any reason why you'd have to use both.  
---
The only situation where you'd need it would be in 5 man pugs basically, which seems a bit silly because people either have their shit together or they don't have a threat meter and wouldn't pay any attention to it even if they did have one. I've started using my Details! only for displaying DPS or Healing done (it still collects information about threat generated and can x-talk with other Details! people), and instead have ClassicThreat show threat. 
---
In my case there's no sense of showing both threat meters - since I'm healing, there's not much else I can do except wait with my first big-ish heal until the tank has dealt out a few blows, I'll just have to heal him before he dies. If I proceed like that and delay the cast of my first big heal for a bit and still draw aggro, that's not anything a threat meter can help me with.
---
So raiding with a multiboxer was fine up until Rag had 2%. And even then, that multiboxer survived on multiple characters longer than you survived, so what's your excuse?
---
rip gold
---
Ignore skull, the DPS will down it fast enough, tank the rest.
---
Ye I'm sure you got away alive by doing that...
---
Plenty of pvp servers are just perfect. It's good that you are happy about your choice but you're not some mastermind :P
---
I refilled my orc rogue to go if because initially I wanted the stun resist, but the trend I've seen is there are many many more spriests and warlocks in classic on alliance side then ever rolled on vanilla, that raises wotf value a significant amount. Both are super strong racials though for sure.
---
they said classic servers had somewhere like a 3-5k cap
---
they also said new servers at medium would be more than a full vanilla server
---
so, classic servers should have about 7-10k as a cap one would asume
---
Thanks! Do you know if it is just the healers that need to have the up to date addon or all raid members (including tanks/dps that are receiving the heal)?
---
Ahhhh, yes I do, but I do remember that now from my alliance days.
---
&gt; I love it though that I'm being downvoted for a totally neutral statement. A lot of pissed kids and nolifers in this sub after all :)
---
No, you're being downvoted because you used the tired, shitty excuse that everyone loves to throw around when people talk about clearing content:
---
&gt; This time around there are a lot of dads and moms in Classic and people with time consuming jobs.
---
I work every single day, Monday to Saturday, yet I still find the time to clear MC + Ony in 2:30-3hours every week.
---
Howl of terror is 15 second fear fyi.
---
That pally wasnt even ret, no wonder he got worked.
---
You're not wrong!
---
Yeah it's because you can easily replace it in a raid and a defensive proc isn't very useful in general. In general it might just have a bad rep because it's associated with noobs.
---
[Here](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/character/eu/firemaw/windforce)'s a tank from progress that uses it, presumably it's not much worse than a brutality blade. They seem to be a human so daggers is not worth it i guess. If you check a specific log you can see their gear if you select them and go to the general tab.
---
You really don't care about hitting a certain point in defense thought from what I know, it's just a stat like any other.
---
Monkeynews is making one for ranking so that's a use for it i guess :D It's advantage is that it's not a raid drop so you could consider it a preraid item, you just need to kill ony once.
---
Would be the 4th time restarting. A good bit demoralizing lol
---
Got my leaf Sunday, all the demons were already despawned last night. They're removing layering on our server tonight. 
---
This should be interesting.
---
I dont even have time for Netflix anymore. I might cancel my subscription tbh.
---
Why?  
---
People seem to act like nonconsensual pvp is a downside because it stops you from "doing what you want".  Except it isn't, it vastly enriches your playtime.
---
You wanna make leveling even more boring than it needs to be?  Level on a PVE server.  Sure you'll get to 60 quicker, but the achievement will be shallow.
---
Yes and no - I'm playing a priest, but back in the days I played a pvp-focused shadow priest and now I'm going with discipline and dungeons. Not sure yet if I stay disc/holy at 60 or change up to holy/disc. Anyway - same class, but very different experience and I like it very much :)
---
That other 50% of the playerbase has freaking paladins, arguebly the best healers in the game with an insane buff that allows dps to go much harder than their horde side (because who would put air tranq above WF).
---
As long as you keep mobs off your healer and attempt to hold off the dps you're doing fine. Dps face tanking a mob for a few seconds isnt usually going to matter
---
Please don't knk shame the dude playing a naked night elf.
---
He loves it, getting swarmed by a gaggle of buff orcs getting rough with him. He probably looks forward to that more than the raid itself.
---
Can you do red cloud Mesa ? Or mulgore ?
---
Flame/frost/shadow reflector, arcanite dragonling and discombobulator ray from engineering, Skull of Impending Doom and Nifty Stopwatch from badlands quests, Goblin Rocket Helm from goblin engineering (boe), Glimmering Mithril Insignia from blacksmithing, Magic Dust from dust devils in Westfall.
---
Just do dungeons ?
---
Well, Fight Club guide (written by nerds who are behind most of today's tank theorycrafting) places QS as 2nd best tank weapon, right after Brutality blade.
---
Well. 
---
That is an epic Moment tbh.
---
As soon as you hit 60 a whole raid of Horde gathered just to kill you to prevent you from destroying everyone.
---
Or you just got owned.
---
IDK
---
I recently bought the T1 bracers for Paladin (Lawbringer's) from AH for 120g. I think I got a pretty good deal but does anyone know what the usual going rate for BOE epic raid armor is?
---
You being a gnome warlock even if you try your fullest to be bad you wont succeed. You are too cute to be really evil
---
w-why would you stack melee/caster in their seperate raids.
---
Sounds like a guild I wouldn't play with.
---
He meant to say they are required for people without fear ward.
---
It's like buying a ferrari and trading it in for a robin reliant.
---
Layered is the opposite of the goal though?
---
Stun them and let nature take it's course
---
Every time I see a group missing a tank or healer half way through an instance already, you know that 9 out of 10 times the group is pure garbage.
---
True though if they have imp cs they can just follow up with sheep to wait out the CD of cs and use that time to buff up since in open world they might now have been ready.
---
Damn, there are a lot of Gehannas allys in the chat :)
---
I really should try to have a look at WA2 - the coding nature of it just leaves me hesitant. It seems to be one of the most powerful addons as far as UIs go, for sure.
---
Which is a stupid argument because you save a ton of timw by clearong MC within 3 hours.
---
For the Horde!
---
The early tiers have wacky stats and a lot of them are just pvp gear because of stamina. Around 80-300 is the price on my server.
---
Are the map files already in the game itself and do you have a github to contribute to the addon?
---
Tidal Charm.
---
Yeah, fuck those people for wanting to be able to actually play the game.  What a bunch of bitches.
---
most of the shit in holy and kings is the baseline 
---
lasting judgement and lay on hands tallents are worth it if you do a lot of raid healing 
---
judge light or wiz on bosses and we lay on hands the gar adds tank for the 2min buff 
---
you can be a slightly more hybrid build if you want for a while and dont raid much , id probally go holy / prot so i can tank or heal dungeons while getting my preraid bis
---
the most difficult part of the quest is spamming in say/yell that people cant help
---
No you did fine. Reddit just has a reading comprehension problem sometimes
---
There’s like two servers that are 80% horde. Stop being a baby about a 65-35 server.
---
Yeah with 30 boomkins I think
---
&gt;This time around there are a lot of dads and moms in Classic and people with time consuming jobs.
---
Last I checked if you are already 60 and in MC, a time consuming job isn't going to triple your MC time. You don't need good gear to get sub 2 hours, let alone sub 3 hours. The whole job thing is just an excuse for being bad.
---
I'm still using this, and it works 🤔
---
Just the healers.
---
Thank you! Another question; can you train blacksmithing up to make the Glimmering Mithril Insignia then drop it, like with engineering? I haven't gotten my goblin engineering up yet after making the gnomish trinkets and dropping gnomish, so if it is would it even be worth getting blacksmithing to 225 for a 30 sec fear immunity?
---
spawntimer has been changed since vanilla, its not 3h anymore
---
more like 10-30mins
---
Can't take credit for the template, but seems to have been created recently. Good edit though!
---
Started using PallyPower last night. It actually seems to work well for the most part, but weirdly doesn't buff Blessing of Light so that has to be done manually. Anyone else using with everything working?
---
 Repair bill. I do the same.
---
Hi, im a gnome mage.
---
And today im coming out of my selfimpozed 2 month exile in zul'farrak. 
---
A million dead trolls to my name and enough gold to buy a country ill take you all on! BRING IT!
---
For this run? They over-prepared, but it's still a good practice.
---
Using the guild I ran on a pserver as reference, we'd clear MC BWL and Ony the same night, then AQ the other. We'd kill Onyxia with world buffs either in their last 10 minutes or just expiring and we weren't cream of the crop players.
---
World buffs get a lot more worthwhile when you can push your limits and still have enough raid content to utilize them.
---
Where the losers begin. 
---
Lok’tar nubs!
---
Ah yea right, forgot about that. But as you said at this point you can just fear and leg it
---
Back in the day I used to use Armory a lot to spy on other players' specs and gear. Will we ever get Armory for Classic?
---
Meanwhile I did &gt;50 runs on my rogue and never saw the MH drop!!
---
There's usually the World channel, which is just for chatting.
---
Chick wearing lingerie going on an adventure?  Nice.
---
ive done 2 runs of mc as feral druid (PUG) once at lvl 57 and second time at 59. i have most of the pre raid bis items but they didnt even care as they just needed my buff.  did 6/10 i think after we wiped for some unknown reasons and headed for ony but unfortunately i hadnt done my quests yet
---
Aww aren't you a lovely person!
---
Dead on. I hate seeing that shitty excuse. People act like you need to grind 12 hours a day for Classic Phase 1 lmao.
---
At worst you're the flask home, at best lots of people on AH buy your flasks too, but it's better than leaving like 400 lotus in bank
---
There's no apostrophe needed when pluralizing
---
open with r1 frostbolt as his first cast will mostly be grounding totem. fake cast/cast scorch into earth shock. poly. open with big frostbolt. nova/bomb/bolt/CoC, lock his heal, don't get yourself locked in frost, lock his chain lightning.  just have Omnibar for monitoring earth shock cd, there you have it. real counter for mages are druids.
---
You can also solo the next part of the quest by kiting him around the cave - pull him from below, fear when he gets to you and run upstairs, jump down when he's close, repeat. If your fear resists you have to spam heal yourself, so keep your mana high.
---
Yeah. I thought I hated LFG/LFR, but I don’t. I don’t have 2 hours to find a group and get everyone in. I only have 2 hours to play, period.
---
P2 none. P3 is the first that adds new stuff (BWL, Thorium Brotherhood)
---
Don’t forget the alliance players who get ganked twice were omfg my server is 90-10!!!
---
&gt; Besides, if a tank cannot hold aggro with 1h+shield then they cannot hold aggro with a 2h
---
Not really. Charge-sweeping strikes-whirlwind does much more dmg (and thus more snap aggro) on a trash pack with a 2h. After that you, of course, switch to defensive, demo and start tab-sundering.
---
Yeah really... OK boomer is the perfect answer.
---
Someone has no idea how it works :)
---
"1 quick run" that turned into 50 dreadful runs because shit didn't drop, or the other rogue won it, or the hunter ninjaed it... Not to mention all the time you spent getting into groups, looking for tanks, waiting for people to fly in from zones far away, wiping, "brb quick bio" breaks etc. From a time investment perspective I'm pretty sure it's usually faster and also much more reliable to just farm the gold...
---
&gt;I love it though that I'm being downvoted for a totally neutral statement. A lot of pissed kids and nolifers in this sub after all :)
---
I'd be mad too if I was in 4 hour MC runs too boomer
---
I believe one spawns when you kill one. I'm hoping with phase two and no more layers the price will go up.
---
I mean i knew it varied some with greens, just not with boss drop blues.
---
Ahhh... vanilla human mage nostalgia!
---
"The Enclave" made the news in the U.S....
---
YO TAUNT
---
Ok.  Can you explain How so?
---
what is SoL?
---
If backpacks would be mainstream everybody would ask for hiding their backpack option, because everybody wants to look like medieval warrior, not the pack mule. Sure it does work for leather wearing classes, like monk, or some hunters, but not fir all.
---
I think they said no. Considering that they haven't added APIs for any of their recent games, that department is probably understaffed now.
---
It's actually quite balanced, but it's well-known at this point that the Alliance organize for large world PVP raids more so than the Horde.
---
In part, yes. Holy paladin has a 5/5 talent that refunds a spell's mana cost if it crits. But his flash heal is also pretty efficient and with blessing of wisdom he gets to heal more without much gear. 
---
Priests can also be really efficient but they need to downrank a lot more
---
In actual Vanilla whats regarded now as Phase 1 lasted for 4 months and a bit. In Classic this is reduces to +-2.5 months, or even less if you count the early DM release.
---
The PVP system in Vanilla came in patch 1.4, May 5 2005, Patch 1.5 (Battlegrounds) came the 7th of June 2005, so basicly a month later.
---
Seeing that P2 hardly has any content and the PVP portion of P2 only lasted 1 month in 2005 i don't find it weird that ppl expect that P2 in Classic will have a very short lifespan and that atleast BG's might be pulled forward. 
---
P2 hardly brings any new content at this point (only 2 worldbosses and the PVP system), i don't see that lasting very long, especially not if the servers turn into one big camp fest at FP's and zone choke points, that might cost them a lot of customers.
---
Auctionator for the item information. I photo edited the comparison, unfortunately no idea if there is an addon that lets you pull up multiple tooltips like that.
---
Fake cast first sheep, ez
---
Youve seen nothing yet, today emerges the thousands of mages that has been solofarming dungeons since week1. 
---
For every Free action potion you got stockpiled the mage has a dozen Limited invulnerability potions plus dozen other fancy engineering consumables and still with enough gold over to buy his own island :P
---
BWL attunement requires a UBRS run.  You get a "this item begins a quest" item off of an elite mob in BRM (outside the entrance to BRS) and that item requires you to click on the orb behind the last boss of UBRS (general Drakkisath).  It's an easier attunement than MC in my opinion - since  UBRS takes less than an hour to run.
---
Indeed.. Just WoW
---
&gt; Psychological projection is a defence mechanism in which the human ego defends itself against unconscious impulses or qualities (both positive and negative) by denying their existence in themselves while attributing them to others.
---
But nah, we all prolly just NEETs.
---
Easy to do when all the Horde cities have back doors that lead to the faction leaders, unlike Alliance cities which only have one way in.
---
I detect sarcasm.
---
Keep a KoS list. Put all lowbies you camp on it, and see what happens. What you will see is that 99% of them never make it to 60. Want more control over server balance, do this for a month, and you will definitely see results.
---
Depends I guess. You can probably do it on a PVE server but on a PVP one you can only have a character in one faction per server.
---
What are the macros in the top right corner for? Instant bank alt mails or something?

Its a reference to inglorious basterds

Sheesh 49 is a lot, you might be hard pressed to upgrade that for awhile.

Meanwhile I'm half way through revered, haven't worn the trinket since hitting honored, and still cant get the Cad chest/barons Cape.  Looks like I'm getting into naxx for free.

In the future he makes Garrosh warchief. I know this because in the future I'm an undead rogue.

Yeah, normal people don't get offended by a differing opinion about a video game. It's a dead giveaway. Take care dude, good luck with the applications.

And trading and LFG too, for some reason.

I know Phase 2 is about to drop but any idea for when Phase 3 might be coming out? I want to level my alt twinks but am wondering if I'll even have time before the next phase comes out.
---
Haven’t tried this app yet, but if it doesn’t clutter up my interface &gt; addons folder with 25 sub folders like atlas, it’s a huge win. 
---
Last I checked, atlas add on is an obnoxious number of sub folders with cross dependencies for certain functionality. It’s too much.
---
They should allow/force Horde -&gt; Alliance faction transfers as well.   Even if every server was evenly distributed,  there are just too many Horde.
---
Yeah Im on pve, not good enough at pvp to deal with world pvp constantly.
---
Lok'tar
---
I'd prefer that Blizzard only allow Horde to transfer off Stalagg and only allow Alliance to transfer to it. I play Alliance on Stalagg with a buddy and his girlfriend, and it's rough. The Alliance AH is a sorry sight, and it's hard to find help for quests at times.
---
Glad that my main character is on Bloodsail Buccaneers when I'm online by myself.
---
Lol all these servers were close to 50-50. Why’d all the alliance leave?  Why are they complaining when most of them still aren’t that imbalanced?  40-60?  I’m alliance by the way. Retail made the faction embarrassing.
---
Int gear is important for prot palas. Seal of wisdom, the use of downranked spells if you have enough threat already.
---
This is the right answer.
---
Play what you want. I was subtlety and I had a blast.
---
it increases your skill level cap from 225 to 300.  It's necessary to max out cooking (artisan level).
---
I personally think noggenfogger is a banter server :)
---
LookingForGroup is garbage on my server. People use it as a General channel.
---
You might not want to hear it, but you are the reason rdf and flying was added.
---
Im was farming Maraudon the last couple Days also being a Warlock and i had many stacks farmed but i sold them right away cause on my server they are at 45s each. The Herb im holding onto P2 is my stranglekelp for FAPs. I hope they will skyrocket in prices
---
Paladin T1 is mostly for pvp, it has awful stats for PVE healing. Similarly, druid is also very cheap because there's very few of them in most raids. Other class pieces can go for way more, if you can even find any on the auction.
---
You can't do that on the same account so you will need a trusted friend to give the gold to and make the purchase for you.
---
It kinda does though.  No one is gonna want to run with a dude who is this bad.
---
Not saying high rank means high skill, but if you're this bad your pre-mades are losing to PuGs lmao
---
Well sure, I'm not trying to say my guild is good. I'm just saying 350 dps ain't going to break a guild. Even in a shitty one. We're clearing raids every week with most people averaging 250. Answering this guy's question, yes you can raid as arms
---
***laughs in orcish***
---
"Classic wow will be dead after a month."
---
We just have 2 raid tiers. Infrequent raiders get low priority on being taken to the raid.
---
As a bunch of RL and in game pals who play very casually, did our first UBRS run last night and smashed it, i also managed to ding 60 the same evening.   
---
nothing hardcore, as we're moving onto MC and stuff soon when we recruit a few more fresh faces, but it just solidifies what classic has been for me so far. Just a bunch of folks, having a good time together, even 15 years later  
---
Pewjitsu are an alliance guild on Mirage Raceway EU and always have room for more friendly folk.
---
It doesn't tell them where you are, if they get the drop on you maybe you should be deleting a rogue
---
There are plenty of idiots on the internet.
---
It shouldnt be to hard to find a new guild and get back in the game. Keep at it and you will find a new place :)
---
I'm half joking half serious. I had a lot of fun in STV by gathering large groups of level 30s to counter gank the 60s that would go around killing us low level newbies.
---
I had the KoS list and did get some revenge kills on other level 30s that thought people don't hold grudges.
---
Eventually I hit 40 and I quit playing because of the Hong Kong stuff.
---
Ah ok. Thought that was the case but wasn't 100% sure. Kinda sucks but I guess I'll try to see if a guildie will help me out.
---
Nice write up, makes sense! I hope BGs get here asap
---
I’ve also had this problem. Pretty sure it’s due to cross dependencies with other adding modules and/or conflicts with other addons.  As cool as atlas loot is, there’s just so much other junk in the atlas suite now it’s a mess imo.
---
Whipper root tuber, separate CD health pot
---
No, but you’d get the Ignorance Award for not understanding that the world ~doesn’t~ all speak English as a first language and sometimes people use translators. Translators don’t look for punctuation, because the intended meaning is still understandable.
---
How many years I have waited for some expensive games to get cheap, 
---
and now after classic release those games become almost free
---
#ukdrillas thinks otherwise.
---
Do you want a link to the full article on Psychological projection?
---
If there is anything obvious here, it's the fact that you are indeed doing exactly that.
---
How important to you is winning a fight in PVP?
---
You can successfully PvP rogues &amp; warriors without engineering. Bear, stun (bash, charge, stomp), heal vs rogues. Bear, stun/root, kite, moonfire/insect swarm vs warriors. You’ll kite warriors in caster form enough to grenade them, but it’s not necessary.
---
Good hunters, you really need the 4 piece PvP set for its +15% speed buff, otherwise you run out of mana shapeshifting out of their slows. Grenades helps a lot against hunters, but they’ll still be a hard class until you get the PvP set.
---
The blacksmith glimmering trinket &amp; restorative potions when the trinket is on cooldown is the only reliable way to tackle warlocks &amp; shadow priests. Blacksmithing is what prepping for, to replace my gathering profession.
---
Dude, I played exclusively on a PvP server for vanilla and tbc. Didn’t play wotlk. Came back for cata+ playing RPPvP. And every other game I’ve only played on PvP servers. 
---
I love PvP, and I am experienced to say the least. 
---
My experience in classic hasn’t been “classic”. 
---
I’ve not one single time during my journey to level 60, playing alts, or bullshitting around had a “fair” encounter, where either party could win, based on level and situation. Such as not being in combat when it starts. 
---
It’s been gank after gank, die while fighting a mob, attacked on way to instance, etc, etc. 
---
Vanilla onwards, I can remember so many fun and fulfilling PvP encounters while in the open world when leveling, sometimes they would turn into huge brawls.
---
This hasn’t been a classic experience. And I don’t blame the game. I blame what the playerbase has become 15 years later.
---
Scarlet Monastery Graveyard and Library. Do a couple of runs of those, then you can pick up a few older quests from zones you haven't done yet.
---
Stonetalon Mountains, Wetlands, Duskwood. It might feel like it's backwards but I find it's easier to "bite the bullet" now and do some old quests for a bit than to feel like you're always trying to catch up to the zones.
---
If not those, have you tried Desolace?
---
Atleast eu does
---
What? It was in vanilla. The question now is wether it will be in classic as well.
---
Does it take a lot of time to level my mining in order to mine the ores in dm?
---
Divide them up on different characters and transfer to multiple servers!
---
It's fun but you won't get many backstabs since mobs generally look at you in combat. But when you get a new dagger/fight lower lvl mobs and ambush crits for like 60% of their health, it will be a blast.
---
49/51 faction split on grob
---
There is a damn clear difference between somebody in full pre-bis and partly greens + a little dungeon gear. Especially if that's not an exception but a majority of the raid.
---
And the time you need to farm your pre-bis **is** going to triple with a kid and a time consuming job.
---
Has nothing to do with how good or bad you are.
---
You forgot /s
---
Yeah mining sucks to level. Expect to spend most of the day on it, especially 250-270 since thorium is somewhat hard to come by.
---
Did you respond to the wrong person or something? I have 21 days played since I hit 60, what are you ranting about?
---
&gt; Barring additional info, nothing they did was necessarily wrong.
---
Yes they did. It's not like he just disappeared. He told them he'd be out of commission for a few weeks. It'd be one thing to lose the raid spot, but to be kicked is just ridiculous.

I think this might have been a rend group, based on them being 6 in the dungeon and 1 healer. I would never solo heal after rend, but most rend runs I really don't see why I should bring unneeded competition for briarwood. (Unneded because it can be solo healed without any stress).
---
But Horde doesn't outnumber Alliance on Grob.
---
I did the math wrong,
---
Faps are 5g a per 5 on my server atm, which will go up as pvp hits.
---
20 Oily = 5 Free Action Potions
---
That would 120g in total from his oilys not 500
---
yes, and halfway through the dagger and sheild WF is actually doing more damage than the 2 hand staff, despite being 2 item levels lower. I am however 1 level higher.
---
New player here, hello! 
---
I leveled a Rogue to 22 - really enjoyed it, but I kinda hit a point where I feel like pure DPS just isn’t for me. It constantly makes me feel like I have to perform well - and I just can’t. Also, in PvP I fear that I’ll just be a lolkill on sight, despite being a rogue. Purely because I’m at an age I’m not as fast anymore lol. I’d rather have a more chill experience.
---
Now, I really enjoy playing a supportive role. More so than being in the spotlights myself. I came to the the conclusion that it now boils down to 3 classes; the swift Druid, the supportive Priest &amp; the versatile Shaman.
---
Which of those offers the most laid back play style? I’m mainly aiming towards the PvP field with capture the flag &amp; raids - well, I guess I just want to focus on everything haha! 
---
TL;DR
---
New player looking for a laid back supportive class, doesn’t want to be a DPS show-off.
---
Thanks lads!!
---
I'm completely oblivious as to why Engineer is relevant to any of this.
---
Lol sure dude... you don't even realize how obvious of a NEET you are acting like this. Like even the immediate claim of "projection" is a classic NEET move man. You have no defense so you're going to deflect. It's sad. But good luck out there dude, this is enough of my time wasted on you.
---
No it can't ;)
---
No homo
---
You don't lose if you farm 50s.
---
How do people stand the badges around the minimap like that, yeesh it drives me nuts lol
---
BRM is just a mad house. As ally on Grob, every time I go to BRM horde are camping all the instance portals with raids. Corpse running is just how you into BRM. Doesn't seem to matter what side you are on.
---
The problem is that you have alliance transferring off slightly unbalanced servers because they feel outnumbered when they really are not. Kromcrush was probably around 49/51 for a while there, but had mass exodus of alliance guilds last transfer cycle.
---
Congratulations, you're part of the problem.
---
I can't get enough of that lighting. So extremely atmospheric. Good job!
---
Unless he's on a different server the frog guy should know you can't make both alliance and horde on the same server.
---
Other than that thats pretty wholesome
---
If in vanilla I never experienced the mafia, does it mean I was part of it? I remember excel spreadsheets and spawn timers and a lot of pvp. But not like stealth classes camping it.
---
when u kite u should strafe/spin away and not give them your back
---
yea, my fave if when im standing in IF and someone just slams one into the trade window without saying anything
---
You might be able to see if there are any other people in your situation. You could give 100gold to their new alt and they could do the same, give 100gold to your new alt. Obviously you’d need to trust someone but check out your realms discord. This is probably against some fine printed TOS but you’d both save money as neutral AH cuts are yucky
---
P.S. might be worth checking to see how deposits work in the neutral AH... maybe recipes or something don’t have such a high deposit or AH cut... just my two cents, good luck
---
Time to /gquit and find a new home.
---
Do you use some kind of add on for managing th3 queues, or is it just manual work?
---
I suggest you run scarlet monastery until you get a few levels, there's a decent questline with a strong weapon reward.
---
Please note that the neutral AH has quite the large cut. If I remember correctly it's 5% for your faction's AH and 25% for the neutral one. Meaning for each gold you'll transfer you loose 25 silver.
---
Yes, the difference is sub 1 hour run to sub 2 hour run lmao... 2 times longer IS a damn clear difference. Not sub 1 hour and sub 4 hours. That's just a bad guild which is making a million mistakes. Our first MC clear after a few weeks of release when we all had shit gear and some people below 60 was nowhere near that long.
---
It's gone since today, check wowhead.
---
Attempting to make the faction imbalance worse on destination and home servers.
---
Black rock mountain
---
What woulf the most efficient honorfarming as rogue be? Group up with 2 other rogues, kill as much as possible at one spot and before u get overrun move to another area?
---
How much would that cost
---
1-Your rotation is bash/faery fire for single target, swipe for aoe.  
---
2-Pre heal yourself with heal over times because it generates threat.  
---
3-Get a threat meter and during pulls tab target between bashes to see which mobs need threat.  I basically just spread evenly unless i see a melee going ham, not all threat shows up on the meter i mostly use it to make sure im spreading evenly.
---
4-Get macros for autoattack and a few other good ones, a quick druid macro google will show you them all, they help ALOT.
---
For the people who randomly put up high throughput items in the AH way below competition; why?
---
For instance my servers market is starved for mooncloth bags, was only 5 at the AH at, all between 22-23g. Then some dude suddenly put 4 more out there for 19g each. Why use the auction house at all if you don't care about the easy 9g you threw away for no reason? You'd earn more by selling the mats individually, the mooncloth alone goes for the same price as what you want for the bag...
---
Another scenario was a dude who posted runecloth bags for 50% of what others were posting for. I just bought them all and sold them for 1g more each in less than 2 hours. But that's besides the point, I want to know why you are using the auction house when you don't care about gold, it's much faster to just vendor the items at that point.
---
I'm not saying everyone should min-max and undercut by 1c, 2h auction time. But there's a big difference between that and throwing away several gold.
---
What am I looking at ? 
---
I swear to god 80% of posts on this subreddit are random screenshots combine with  random captions and I have no clue what should I understand.
---
So for those who already has the QoL stuff resolved through other add-ons DismountMe is the way to go.
---
&gt;Those raids aren't going anywhere anytime soon.
---
elvui with the scale turned up quite a bit. I play without my glasses on a humongous monitor at 1440, so if I use the native scale all the buttons are fucking tiny. I have a couple additional add-ons for added functionality but that's the primary one.

in this its about medium now is a full vanilla server
---
i cant promise these link go to the source, because im at work and only see a few parts of the sites,
---
but if you still dont believe me you can goole it yourselfe
---
I understand that. It's in my experience that people are 'loyal' to their faction, no matter the server.
---
It has to be satire, no one could actually miss the point that blatantly.
---
Have you been to the Karazhan crypts? :3
---
You can go 31/20 and tank very well with the gear. As long as you get RF you can tank whatever. Holy shock is good for pulls in stuff like brd otherwise exorcism. Holy shock is good for pvp as a quick heal or you can crit it on an enemy with divine favor.
---
Works fine for me. There is different versions though, be sure to check if that makes a difference
---
Can confirm this was definitely not the case. You can clear it for sure, but we used flasks on most encounters.
---
IIRC stormwind cathedral is where a cpl start also maybe southshore
---
MalGanis EU Horde :-)
---
Pick up fishing, that way you can do both!
---
They tried leaving it open and panicked when alliance fled worsening faction imbalances on both home/destination servers.
---
&gt; At some point you can stop complaining you know.
---
You must be new here...
---
Didn't try that but you could do it yourself. List a crap item with your ally char and buy it with horde char. Calculate the neutral AH cut before doing it.
---
If you can buy a random item that your other character posted on same faction AH, cross faction AH thing should work too.
---
I’m alliance on Flamelash - any advice on whether I should hop off, and if so; where to and why?
---
i guess u mean Lord Incendious... i was thinking on getting the mats and just try to make my way to there by some kind of shortcut to craft it ... but if its impossible to not pull it to use the forge... this doesnt have sense, ill try to ask any BS that go there and pay for the job ... ty for your answer
---
&gt; **Do you remember the first time you created a human character and started leveling** 
---
Yeah it was only three months ago
---
It might happen, but after transfer are closed...cause Blizz ;)
---
Then why is the quest marked as Warrior, Paladin? 
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=3321/did-you-lose-this
---
I'm in the same spot in my raid every week. Only one warrior per party needs imp bshout if you aren't mixing up groups.
---
What level do I need to be to mine the ores in dm? 275 i guess?
---
The basic anti-venom you learn on early levels of first aid (claims to cure poisons up to level 25) seems to work on every poison in the game. Including poisons from dungeon bosses, and max rank viper sting from hunters. Is it a bug?
---
Grats dude!
---
I need help looking for my optimal gold farm for my epic mount. I’m a 60 ele/resto shaman with my highest alt being a level 11 mage I’m wondering what my best gold farm is? I have mining and engineering at 260 each on my main but mining doesn’t sell well on AH. Should i grind my 60 or level my mage to a good bank alt level for enchanting?
---
Our other warrior was trying to find rexxar and wasn't in the instance for this moment
---
I agree , I feel like I really earned it.
---
The mage said that he got blasted earlier and instead of swimming back to his spot he stayed there.  Maybe he didn't swim back because it would involve too much focus on a single room vs his whole squad of frostbolting mages.  Either way, no leaving the melee spot was a big no-no.
---
finish ashenvale/duskwood, and start desolace
---
Druid and priest most likely, although i’ve never played horde. I have had a 60 priest and druid back in original vanilla and loved them both. If you want to play capture the flag the druid is the best flag carrier in the game. Druids are a great support class bc they can tank, heal and dps (although not as good as their non-hybrid counterparts). But they have a ton of survivability and versatility. And i loved being able to do quests that others couldn’t solo bc of stealth, roots, heals, bear etc. plus the movement speed bonuses in cheetah form / seal form are great quality of life boosts. Druid is the most under represented class in the game too so less competition for loot in many cases.
---
Priests same boat and you can dps if you want as shadow which is a pretty sick pvp spec that is reasonable in pve as well. Both are great i don’t think you can go wrong.
---
As i said, Read the tooltip "Has no effect if the mob is already attacking you"
---
The truth hurts.
---
Kid, you're the definition of cringe
---
no it doesn't, the alliance will just quit wow entirely instead of switching to a different server
---
Ooh juicy!
---
Too many attempted to flee worsening the situation for home &amp; destination servers.
---
&gt; Choosing a PvP server was a mistake as a middle aged guy this time around. I just didn’t want to piss off young me.
---
Am middle aged guy, rolled PvE for EXACTLY this reason.  I don't have time for that shit anymore.
---
Im fully aware of the huntard meme as I've always played a hunter main, but i only see that in low lvl dungeons in retail. Not had any issues with other hunters in classic. The only time i fuck up as a hunter is when my pet strays too far from me and pulls but I just always have it stealth to combat that in smaller areas. Never get any complaints personally. I screw up way less then some of the people in my guild seem to. 
---
I too have been trying to up my game as a DPS. As for the whole "hunters are not viable" BS. I did a BR dungeon last night at lvl 53, with a bunch of 60's and got 2nd in overall DPS. Mage was fist ofc but only by about 2K dmg or so... skill and your use of abilities in rotation plays just as big of a parts as class balance and gear.
---
Great story OP, I cant wait to try and get my bow too.
---
Yes but you can and should get a pair of gloves with +5 mining enchant to avoid having to grind those last 5 levels. If you were a mail/plate class you could also get goblin mining helmet, but alas no cloth version exists.
---
I've yet to play alliance. Forever horde.
---
Slark is the name of a hero in the video game called Dota 2 as is in the title. Slark is a murloc looking dude since the game was a mod created in Warcraft 3 and used Blizzard assets.
---
Be vary vary wary of this. Not only are there people sitting at the neutral AH waiting for this exact thing, there are bots that specifically do this. Honestly I highly doubt you will be able to get it before someone else snipes it.
---
He didn't say 53 is his only character. He said "main." That actually does imply that he has alts.
---
I also play League of Legends which is 100% owned by Tencent, I just don't spend any money on the game anymore since they were bought out. I haven't bought any CoD since MW2. Specially more recently I've tried to inform myself were the products I buy are made and actively try to not purchase stuff made in China.
---
I know it's not much but it's what I deem is my responsibility to my freedom. You can criticize that I don't do enough, but it's much more than I see anyone doing where I'm from.
---
To be honest I didn't know Blizzard was partly owned by Tencent until the incident, but it definitely made me act more consciously.
---
Leatrix has it all in one addon and is toggleable in a window in game, there's no reason to have multiple addons when one suffices.
---
Kromcrush was more balanced than some of the other servers but it was never close to 50/50 in the open world. 
---
I left after waiting in short queues only to get overrun by horde in every zone I tried to level in.
---
I only have a few hours to play during the week and they happened to be at prime time and I couldn't do anything outside of instances so I left.
---
Depends kinda depends on the level of your DPS but around 41,42,43. If you have a shaman (or other off healer) it a little easier to do lower.

Grind it shitdawg.  You are the l33tdawg of WoW.  Get cancer maybe?????????
---
Sorry but this is not true at all. Engineering is pretty much mandatory if you plan on doing any form of PvP for an extended amount of time. It isn't even about min maxing, it is about losing out on a metric shit ton of things that can help you win a fight. 
---
There is a reason why PvP guilds require one of your professions to be engineering.
---
If OP is in anyway shape or form planning on doing a large amount of PvP and wants to be competitive it is worth doing engineering.
---
Or have coordinated people who can sapper in at once, decimating raids.
---
an entire guild of kyles and chads
---
You're misunderstanding. He's going to put a grey item up, nothing of value
---
He may mean Stalagg. 
---
HS was balanced 1-59 until droves of 60 allis arrived to skew the high end and slow horde leveling.
---
And the Gigaflux Reactivator has that buff that is cool for any class. I made sure to pick one up on my druid when I started farming Manual Crowd Pummelers. As a lowbie I would totally offer to come tank if I could roll on it.
---
Ahh my assumption was he was selling an item for cheaper on the one side to then sell on the other. I guess you could do it that way too.
---
Yep it's weird not seeing horde capital cities about to burst from over population.
---
Hopefully that means fast bg queues. I like pvp but have irl obligations and of rather not deal with open world pvp.
---
Just to say, as Alliance on grobb every zone I'm in there is some horde ganking lowbies.
---
And in Ashenvale in particular everybody ganks you on sight (except druids). So whilst it's hard to know how similar our experiences are, it's definitely a presence on the alliance side too.
---
Alliance Herod has the same thing
---
This is so cool.  Adds a real unique flavor to the server.
---
Thanks for recording. Was almost as much fun watching it the second time around!
---
Nah man fair enough, I suppose most people don’t practice what they preach enough and you’re right that you gotta do what you gotta do, good on you brother 👍🏻
---
this is true, as a rogue who also has both of these is funny how OP they are at this point in the game
---
Honestly, I'd just stick with healing raids and groups. Most still scuff at the idea of a paladin tank.
---
If you go with a 20/31/0 build you'll just end up screwing over your raid team by underperforming in 'long-duration' fights or fights that 'go side ways' quickly; requiring intensive healing.
---
31/20/0 will just gimp you on dungeon tanking due to the lack of BoSanc; you're all shtick is 'aoe tanking'. If you can't do that [effectively] what makes you stand out against a druid or warrior tanking....other than you lack a taunt and survival CDs that don't drop threat.
---
Warrior's pull it off because they're 'key' tanking abilities are built into the class (Taunt, Shield Wall, Shield Block [I count that as a short-CD survival ability]).
---
Kind of correct, SW:P does more damage by itself but Corruption is better in the long run since it's proccing Nightfall for Warlocks. Improved Corruption doesn't give anything apart from making the spell instant cast, and Shadow Mastery increases the damage dealt by Affliction spells by 10%.
---
I loosely followed classicwow.live’s free guide to know what zones I should be in at what levels. I wasn’t “rushing to 60”, since I still leveled herbalism and alchemy to 300 while leveling and did some dungeon quest runs (mainly to get some sick swords).
---
I never said a new player with absolutely no idea how to play would be hitting 60 by now, but any player who was concerned with hitting 60 before phase 2 has had ample time to make sure that they hit level 60.
---
Sacrificing leveling time to progress other elements that won’t give you experience is exactly how it’s presented, a sacrifice. It’s an explicit choice made knowing you’re taking away from time to level - and that’s okay! It’s just important to recognize that if your priority was to get to 60 pre-phase2, that was obtainable.
---
Yea I got that from the other comment. Been a long morning don't know why I didn't think of doing it that way tbh.
---
Is there any way to show the player's position on them?
---
It fluctuates, but it's far better than it was at launch. I just sold a bunch on light leather for 5x the vendor price. It adds up, although mining may be better giving engineering will be very popular. I didn't choose mining because I found high level nodes hard to find even before layering was removed.
---
Oh showing what the gold would be IF I vendored the items. The addon is called farmlog.
---
Black lotus, not purple.
---
Man that sucks, I’d rock the Demonshear then
---
+120 horde vs. ~40-50 alliance  
---
Cool vid bud
---
I know... RDR2 PC, The Outer Worlds, Borderlands 3. But I got my warrior to 60 and now I’m leveling a mage.
---
You shouldn't vendor trinkets as they are pretty unique in classic. Trinkets with effects like that are usually considered like having a talent point ability.
---
Hitting different cities at once would help reduce server lag. We can't get near Stormwind or Ironforge on our server without the server chugging with 2 raid groups. Getting 5 second delays on abilities and items going off really makes it hard to do anything. We are also on an alliance dominated server though, but that might change with the horde only transfers opened up.
---
Darnassus is annoying to go to so we haven't tried it yet. But the alliance numbers should be pretty low there to avoid the lag.
---
Rag is hard the first time. He isn't just a pushover for most guilds. We did rag with 35 and a few sub 60. Was a fun fight but not extremely easy.
---
Last i went in, I was the only melee as the tank, and it dropped the whole deathbone set one piece after the other. Only the boots haven't dropped. I got everything and people were calling me lucky.
---
blizz 2019 is a gem i swear
---
7. It seems to be true what is beign told about zentaurs
---
I think you should attempt to duel with everyone your level regardless of class, whenever you feel like it. So you can practice at getting good at it, see each class' strength and weaknesses, etc. After all, we are at war and we rolled on a PvP server to experience that. I mean, it's not even about minding your own business, it's just part of the game.
---
Oh gotcha. I’ve seen overcrowding as a problem also, personally. Aka , layered servers. 
---
I play on one. Hate it.
---
Then why do you want people to transfer there lol.
---
Sucks that mass pvp is so laggy
---
Dont need luck for that, there are countless of MC pugs on my server that are happy for any player to join. Never had a gearcheck so far
---
Really struggling for gold. Level 36 (very soon to be 37) Tauren BM hunter....I have 5 gold....its so bad. I want so start the grind for gold. I have mining/engineerig which I cant drop since I require it for Ammo. What should I do? Where should I start grinding for gold?
---
Sword spec wins.
---
To be fair I’ve boughten every Pokemon game except Lets Go and this game is looking like a dumpster fire; pokemon cut, moves cut, increased limitations, a cheap version of mega evolution, terrible graphics compared to other Switch offerings. 
---
I’ll probably get it on deep sale tomorrow eventually, but fuck man GameFreak is just so lazy when it comes to this game and they’re not even trying to hide it.
---
Then you must have problems with your vision.
---
My main is a 60 prot warrior, so no real way to grind gold either. I'm leveling a mage to grind gold
---
I find it strange that so many of your friends used fake profile pictures. Not entirely sure I believe this to be honest.
---
When you pull with charge instead of a bow.
---
Honestly I'm not sure about that one - I know in my personal experience that horde players are *far* more likely to engage in organised ganking/griefing  than alliance, likely due to people being interested in that rolling horde for the better racials as well as not needing to fight shammies. 
---
Certainly I've noticed a massive increase on PvP servers of people forming gank groups to the point of denying entire areas compared to vanilla, though this might just be a consequence of increased player numbers on servers. Looked pretty unfun for alliance though.
---
Maybe, just maybe, this is a fake post.
---
Almost had his life back instead.
---
This guy gets it. It’s about sending a message.
---
But.. there's nothing to dispel on Gehennas.  The only thing that goes out is a healing debuff curse.. which priests can't dispel.  You just stand there and heal for Gehennas and run out of the fire if necessary.
---
Neutral ah is 15% cut, on my pvp server i sold a tough jerkey to myself (2accts) for 350g, used the gold from that to buy flurry axe and aotdw on alliance for around 100 each, sold on horde for 320 aotdw and 275 for flurry
---
RemindMe!
---
Are you sure about not all dark iron going to the GB? Because at least on mine it does. 
---
Well not completely. To be exact the guild smith keeps them all because he crafts tank items with them.
---
It's almost as if the Classic team is trying to fix the issue without the Retail team knowing about it. 
---
"Hey you guys aren't trying to *fix* faction balance right?"
---
"UHH no way dude!" \*Flicks off low faction transfer behind their backs\*
---
Cheap, I see them for 40g+ on mine.
---
I don’t think there’s an ICD, I think I’ve had near 100% uptime on those emp runs. But I could be mistaken.
---
everyone can get the buff, and its both, an aura and a 10min buff you can carry into raids.
---
During jailbreak, marshal windsor opens this one specific room with like 10 elite mobs inside of it you have to kill, and once they're dead he starts equipping his gear. If you stand next to him at exactly this moment, you get the 10min version of the buff. Afterwards, the buff is only available as an aura when you are close to him (like 10yards range).
---
Considering this is a 10min buff and requires someone to start &amp; clear to jailbreak, I doubt anyone ever tried stacking it in multiple brd instances.
---
Fantastic work.
---
Thank you so much for your great feedback mate!! You name some insane points I hadn’t even thought about. They can also go stealth, right? That’d be sick! Thank you so much for taking my question serious and putting time in writing a response. It’s greatly appreciated my dude!
---
You can’t buy auctions from your own account, get a buddy or alt account to help you.
---
I'm pretty sure it does.
---
I’m gonna pretend like this isn’t just a salt mine of a post. There are times when people need gold faster than it would take for an item to sell. For example, if it is going to take 12 hours for a mooncloth bag to sell at 23g, but you can sell it in 20 minutes for 19g, why would you not make that sale if you need gold? Coupled with that is the value of money right now, if tomorrow your server’s biggest holder of X commodity posts it all and crashes the value, wouldn’t you regret not at least taking some money for your items? 
---
The auction house is not a national economy. The value of the items has no floor, aside from vendor price. To assume that someone is wrong for posting their item substantially cheaper than yours is just foolish. Your runecloth bag example was an occasion where it worked in your favor, but I have a feeling the guy who sold all those bags was probably pretty happy too.
---
This kind of things is what makes me regret not going to grub XD
---
is there a max file size maybe?
---
As a shaman your best farming is going to be rich thorium and patches of elemental water in Azshara.
---
This works far better at night.
---
not a single valuable boe (&gt;10g) dropped so far for me.
---
The old menu is so much easier to navigate too imo
---
Using your 1st example I think those people just aren't paying attention to the auction house and have no clue how to undercut properly and yes they are just losing out on gold that they could be making. But when somebody undercuts by 50% or more usually that means they want gold instantly and are willing to wait for the items to sell on the auction house, just look at how fast you swooped up those bags
---
This guy has 0 self awareness
---
For accuracy though, the videos should be in .avi format, no codecs, but 256 colors and at most like 160p.
---
When was nonconsensual pvp ever "fair"?  If you're looking for "fair" fights play a moba, there's no such thing as a fair fight in vanilla wow.
---
feral druids are annoying as shit with the shapeshift; but that 6 sec interupt with high dmg, spammable purge and grounding totem on shamans? fuck them.
---
Hounds in MC, where Luci is, I believe apply a pretty bad Bleed. - We had our MT die because the healers thought healing was done. :P
---
They are, the guy responding has no idea how this works.
---
I read it as lawyer morty.
---
Very good point Re: Copper! although I'd argue that 1 copper is 0.01% of gold, which is extremely immaterial to any gains posted on the AH. I'd even argue that an increase in 1 copper stabilizes the AH and has a lower ceiling for price padding, since people don't want to sell their items too dearly for the sake of not finding a buyer.
---
&gt;Buyers wont buy above it
---
I'd love to continue this discussion, but frankly, I just remembered that I'm on reddit, posting on a video game subreddit and the people here are incapable of not being offensive, respectful or simply not making ad hominem remarks. On that note. I concede.
---
Just keep doing quests and save money. Dont buy skills or items you dont absolutely need.
---
Problem is they stealth did this.
---
A server back in vanilla was roughly 3000 people,  a layer( or an unaltered server) has a capacity of roughly 3000 people.
---
You are :)
---
It's worse
---
I run 30/21/0 and it's great. Holy Shock sucks, and you don't need anything past Sanctuary for tanking 5-man content.
---
The only requirement to make it work is good gear sets for both holy and prot. But you just switch gear and roll!  I use this to raid heal, tank dungeons, and AoE farm (again: each has its own gear set).
---
Couple tips/preferences on talent selection:
---
* Holy: I pick up divine intellect, spiritual focus, the entire 3rd row less 1 LoH point, illumination, divine favor, spell crit and imp BoW.  
---
* Prot: Redoubt &gt; Imp Shield, precision, improved bop, improved HoJ, Kings, and ANTICIPATION (i choose this over armor for more blocking output for aoe farming).
---
After I started levelling a rogue, it's like all classes got some utility and defensive options, and when it came to warriors they were just handed the scraps
---
There are so many good new games right now. The backlog is vast.
---
i would be interested how does feral in later content/AQ dps wise?
---
yes but not with Phase 1 gear
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmGcM3CvxRo
---
Please correct me if I'm wrong but dont they only spawn once in a zone every hour or so?   
---
If you need 5-7 rogues/druids to stealth camp that, with success, thats like 20g an hour per toon. And both factions? Doesnt seem very profitable if I understand it correctly, again please correct me
---
Mages can’t Evo a healer lmao.
---
Gotteeem
---
Hey man!! You and another reply seem to be both on the druid side, and name extremely fun aspects. Honestly, I really want you to know I’m super grateful for your reply. It’ll be weird ‘ditching’ my rogue, but I just hit that stale point (already). It’s like you mentioned really nicely, nobody expects them to outshine anybody. So I can still headbang to music whilst rocking in game!
---
Super geared rogue vs Ret pally who pretty much only has HoR.
---
Is this suppose to be satire? Of course you would win with 2 of the BiS daggers until AQ 40 vs a guy who looks like hes in full blues and also a RET PALLY. One of the worst pvp classes
---
I like how nobody has noticed he missed the guy's name once in the picture.
---
Some technical details give hints at what competitors could do better. All we know is the Classic and Retail server pop is higher than it was in Vanilla.
---
There are 2 Barov brothers
---
Alexi who is undead/horde and Walden who is Human/alliance
---
they send their faction to kill the other
---
Absolutely awesome
---
We used flasks EXTREMELY rarely. I guess it just depends on the guild. We didn't even use titans most of the time.
---
"Skills" isn't the word I'd use to describe it, what they did isn't exactly difficult so much as just time consuming (buff runs) and knowing that its possible through the hundreds of times they have likely practiced it.
---
I had leveled a hunter without professions with max focus on xp (6d played) and  had arround 200g at 60, 110 after I have learned all skills. (ammo, pet food is expensive af)
---
At least you still have the will to live, right?
---
Shit. thanks my dude

Speak for yourself!

It can’t. There aren’t enough BLs for everyone.

What is wrong on saving DKP and getting a 5% weapon?  It just means you likely got barely any other loot while the frequent people already bought 5+ epics.
---
There up to almost 150g on Faerlina, been going up 5-10g a day now for about a week
---
I’m a level 45 paladin. How did you regain mana during the fight? I thought you were screwed when your mana dropped low early, but you hung in their easily.
---
How do alliance druids benefit? I've never heard this before.
---
No, so you can filter tags you don't want to see.  
---
At the very least, Art and Cosplay flairs should be mandatory, so people can filter them out. /r/wow is cancer without filters, it's basically facebook. Really don't want this to become /r/wow AND not have art/cosplay flairs.
---
So you want people to get farmed with you.

There's a class discord for warriors, [https://discord.gg/b2yRMt](https://discord.gg/b2yRMt)

There's also one called Fight Club but I don't have the discord link for that.
---
.....so find a different guild? What's the problem?
---
PSA - if you don't have enough douses, send a runner to grab another douse mid-raid after that person uses their douse.
---
Might be the wrong boss then. There was one with multiple tanks and priests on healing duty.
---
Fake
---
It's definitely ElvUi (says so in bottom left corner), and I'm seeing some other addons as well. However, I believe the unit frame setup has been made manually, so I'm also interested in hearing about it.
---
I don't really like ElvUi since it changes so much of the interface besides the main screen (menus, character sheets, etc.) but maybe it's possible to recreate to a large extent using Luna/SUF.
---
Currently only three on the AH and the cheapest is 165G.
---
Probably Lucifron (first boss)
---
“Biggest server in the world” lol wat? Russian Flamegor is the most populated in EU, and in the world it’s definitely Faerlina

Created a pair of devilsaur gauntlets...wasnt in my bag after creating...after logging out and in it was back in my bag

I watch his streams and Advertise is hilarious. I think this makes WoW more interesting and funny.

This is a change

Get over yourself and this less efficient nonsense.

I'm on horde side and it seems dead at most hours

/s ??
---
Why not make a decent video with minimal obnoxious editing and somewhat appropriate music? A 31 minute video isn't the format for this meme shit, or at the very least cut it the fuck out after a couple of minutes. I wanted to see how a speed run looked in Classic, but I guess pretending to be retarded is cool.
---
You should double-check if it is actually less expensive to make your own bullets or if you should be buying them from the vendor. I am not sure it is better to make them. And don't argue that you are mining the materials to make them, as you could just as easily sell the ore/bars and use that gold to buy ammo.
---
I've tanked DM and Scholo as a warrior, yet to do full Strat runs. Scholo is relatively easy, it's just about getting to know the packs and pathing. DM North hits pretty hard, but East and West is very doable without a lot of gear.
---
I seriously doubt you got the boot just for this unless it was a cutting edge guild. They likely thought you were an underperformer or disliked you in some other way and used it as an excuse.
---
Alliance is still superior in pve because of salv.  Pally blessings overall are actually a lot better (if less fun) than windfury when you take them all into account.
---
I used to pop a FAP, Cat form to flag, hit sprint run out and then use my cheetah from there once outside. Once outside form-shift to break any slows would usually get me back to our base.
---
It was a technical limitation of Vanilla. Removing it would be an oversight as already easy content would be further trivialised. 
---
If they sought to remove it everything would have to be rebalanced, including class balance for PVP
---
Is there any real reason to transfer from Stalagg?  Especially at my level (49) where I can currently find tons of dungeon group?
---
Or maybe it's not fake and his friend just made a joke?
---
In your guild, sure.

---
The devs have no idea what they re doing rofl. Plenty things needed fixing
---
Wrong. When P2 launches and you are part of a serious pvp guild you will have a field day. Everyone else not so much.
---
At 60, your hunting lvl50 honor boars!  Anything less is not worth your time.
---
lol that's the Bloodelf who ports you to Molten Core. OP is dead, you can't see his body.
---
oh
---
In your guild sure, for the guilds I was in and my friends, it was normal.
---
Numbers wise I believe Strat live side has the lowest level bosses.
---
Int/stam all the way, damage is an afterthought. Get full necropile set and enchant it with stamina/hp, mix with some T1 pieces if you have em (no matter if they have +healing, the stats on them are good enough).
---
I think you are not getting it. You are literally set back by not going for 60 immediately.
---
You will not gain anything from doing brd angerforge spam at that level. Literally nothing.
---
All your dungeons will be slower, you will miss out gear &amp; ids, you will be ganked very easily.
---
You will lose literally time by doing BRD angerforge.
---
What is your point. MC in retail still exists, go and do MC there if all you care about is getting the gear somewhen.
---
ok, so basicly i was talking about server cap at classic launch and now its way lower
---
The hardest part about rhokdolar is getting the demons and not having people interrupt it.
---
I'd die to have this sized as a phone background. Probably wishful thinking though.
---
I dont think you know what freedom means... very suprised  I have to explain something so obvious tbh.
---
I didn't know you cared so much &lt;3
---
I asked for a video because someone did the research regarding the classic version of mob tagging. I gave info regarding specifically what they noted. I thought to ask... Because that's what you do when you know less than someone else or if you do not have all the info. Further, I currently don't have the internet to browse around every YouTube video at the moment.
---
I don't recommend you ever get into academia, or, well, anything that uses brain power, from what I see
---
orc stun resist is a huge factor, and it was broken at launch and fixed much later.  So initially there were hardly any orcs as most would go tauren or undead instead as they had better racials before the orc stun resist got fixed.
---
That's about when I started STV. Although I would run SM til maybe 34 just to make the questing a little less harsh.
---
Not always, you can work the flanks and get many 1v1s and you get honor for kills that people you buff or heal get too.
---
You seem to be taking it personally, I didn't mean to upset you. Do your addons as you like but if someone asks why Leatrix is better I have to be honest. Have fun in WoW :-)
---
I'm really sad I rolled on a normal PVP server with RL friend's that have all quit the game, thus missin my chance to play on Grobb from the beginning.  It look's so damn fun.
---
you sound salty
---
I'm a horde who came from Skeram myself but it was during the first round of transfers
---
DKP solves that
---
i was hoping to transfer my horde characters from  incendius to heartseeker  but it does not give me the option to switch over =/
---
This is what I needed most, thank you!
---
Q1: yes
---
Q2/3:its split between the folks doing dmg to the target
---
FYI: dont kill civs!  DHK will wreck you!
---
Adding to that, upload to warcraftmovies with high compression, then downloaded/converted and uploaded again to youtube going thru an additional compression cycle.
---
about inns and how long the extra exp bonus last
---
Does the extra exp you get timed?
---
or is it only go away when you get exp?
---
You can always reset the fight with a sheep, gain some distance and wait out some CDs. Remember, charge and intercept have a 25 yd range, if you're properly talented you can blast away from 36. Don't walk backwards, learn to strafe sideways while maintaining direction at the target. This way you can run at full speed and just kite the poor sod to death.
---
There's little reason to bother with deadzone with warriors. As long as you stay away out of the charge range, they're toast.  Even if they pop all of the consumables - you'll probably have enough time to sheep them again and /wave as you get back out of range.
---
Why would they change it from all people to Horde only After transfers start?! They really are winging this as they go and have no idea what's going on.
---
Someone high up must have seen a YouTube video and changed their mind last minute haha

I just spent the 20g i was out there for 2k kills. Its easier to just get the gold.
---
Woah I wouldn't have ever guessed. I have both t2 pieces, are they worth wearing too?
---
You're a tool.
---
There's a lot of advantages that horde has over alliance, but racials are the largest.  There's a reason why PVE servers mostly see alliance as the largest faction and PVP servers mostly see horde as the largest.  People when deciding where to go think "yeah but that sexy stun resist, or will of the forsaken...".  Wheras human and night elf racials are garbage in pvp, and gnome/dwarf racials are useful but not as OP as orc or undead.
---
No, it's trivial. Done it several times. Heck, you can solo the first boss alone, let alone just arrive at the quest giver.
---
Well put.
---
Wow classic scarlet monetary or wow classic scarlet monetary quests
---
Submissions like this and shitty art posts are awful and shouldn't be encouraged. Shame the OPs of garbage posts so they don't post again. 2 MONTHS IN AND WE DID UBRS GUYS!!
---
Technically T1 head is better because it has same stats and a bit of spell dmg while T2 is all healing, but if you don't have it T2 is still fine. Best pants are the MP5 ones I think, might need to check again to make sure though.
---
Maybe but I'm not posting on the internet
---
Is there a YouTube video of this?
---
If you live in Southern California and would like to play on Whitemane, we are a guild that does IRL events every now and then. We know about 30 of us from IRL so it's a very tight community.
---
You get scaling exp with level, although not proportionally. The exp builds until it's 1.5 levels worth of exp (or +.75 levels). That exp bonus doesn't go away.
---
They should just use queues to balance the factions. If there's 1000 horde and 500 alliance they should have a queue for horde that softcaps horde at 500. That way the server feels more balanced, and the dominant has queues to encourage transfers.
---
Actually discombobulator ray isnt that great since its bugged. Shares a cooldown with gernades and doesnt dismount players.
---
Translation:  my faction is uncoordinated and incapable of a fair fight so I spend my time shooting fish in a barrel and trolling about it.
---
btw, 48 is the lowest level mobs thats are still green at 60
---
It only gets used up when you get XP from killing mobs. Quest XP won't touch it.
---
You can only store a finite amount though, about 1.5 levels worth if I remember right.  And it takes ~2 weeks to build that up.
---
You got Frostbrand at 28, Flametongue at 26, Rockbiter at 24 and probably had a horrible weapon for Windfury (30). 
---
All in all this doesn't say much.
---
I’ve got nothing to be salty about.  I just have an ever burning hatred for the trash can hordlettes.
---
You must not browse r/gaming very often.
---
You cannot do it with 2 chars on the same account. Unless you have 2 subbed accounts, you will need help from a friend.
---
Is this the same guild?

For anyone who has leveled a warrior using any of the various leveling guides our there, is there one that you found to be well suited for leveling a Warrior? In-game or out-of-game either way is fine. Free or paid for, whatever. Just looking for a reliable pathfinder to make it the least worst it can be and so I don't have to think much about where to go or what to do next.
---
Undead mage in vanilla. Always wanted a paladin but never wanted to play alliance. I'm a paladin now and it feels completely wrong to not be horde. But my admiration for the paladin class is stonger than my obsession with horde.
---
Its all cumulative though. How you get good at any game is seat time. If you have a life that is filled with commitment you have less seat time, which translates into it taking longer to accomplish a specific goal.
---
Also not everyone is going to want to devote every waking hour outside of life on a game, if you do then thats great for you; everyones priorities are different, doesnt necessarily make them good or bad at a game.
---
Yeah, nothing says 'nice' like rampant racism.
---
lol it still does it.
---
Mage can have fun in chaos. Pick a weak enemy, blast him.
---
or
---
Hunter. Act like a real hunter. Hide &amp; ambush. Ofc rogues like ambushing people waiting for an ambush. Circle of life.
---
The war is over folks alliance won, you can go home to your dwarf children now (I assume we all adopted dwarf kids after the last horde raid on IF right??)
---
yeah you're p salty
---
This!
---
Hunter is awesome in AV. You can reach your enemies and they cant reach you. Unless its another hunter.
---
Good for you!
---
I fear that they are loathe to do faction ratio queues, simply because PSs did them.
---
Imagine typing this way. Definitely a horde.
---
&gt;**lock his heal**, don't get yourself locked in frost, **lock his chain lightning.**
---
If the fight lasts that long, you're dead or he's bad.
---
[Horde's reaction](https://media.giphy.com/media/X7x7d91ifZcSQ/giphy.gif)
---
I mean as others have said.. just use DKP. If you're rolling in a guild run you're doing it wrong.
---
Show up, earn points, then spend them. Also solves all the bullshit of "why did X get 5 items this raid?!".. because X hasn't had anything drop for 2 months but has been to every raid anyway so has a ton of points.
---
Don't worry about honor in a raid setup, it's absolutely terrible. Raid pvp is mainly for fun or world boss ownership
---
I was waiting for this info. Too bad I already leveled it thru dungeons &amp; world questing in 50.
---
My goal is to have a hunter, warrior, and priest level 60. DPS/Tank/healer. My hunter is 60, warrior is 33, and priest is 15. I think this will give me a better view of the game because I see the games perspective from all the different roles.
---
What's the discord? Might make a reroll manageable xD
---
/console chatBubbles
---
What addon produces this tooltip information (Vendor Auction Disenchant?)
---
wow that's really nice, thanks
---
Delete toon, make new one with the original name. Restore toon and it is asked for a new name. I did that with an alt mage to test.
---
"Did a few MCs" sounds like you didn't have much tenure. If you're gone for 3 weeks that means they need to find someone to replace you for those weeks. If that person is willing to show up consistently and perform it makes sense they would give away your spot. You've basically proven yourself unreliable. Would I kick someone who told me ahead of time they would be taking time off? No. but I would certainly demote them down to trial raider and make them re-prove their loyalty and devotion towards the cause. When it comes to raid leading you need to look out for the guild and what's best for the group as a whole and in the process if a few individuals get burned then so be it. Maybe join a more casual guild that doesn't mind members missing raid nights. Tho I'm sure their runs won't be as fast or smooth. This is the price you pay for convenience.
---
what a weird fuckin thread
---
Will? I couldn't be bothered. You're a grown fuckin adult, fuck em, find a guild who aren't so fuckin stupid
---
Yea, when my demon breaks within 5 seconds several times in row, I know it's just time to call it.
---
Why does Kirtonos not get one? Pop is between 35-65 / 40-60. Has been since launch, and only gotten closer to 30 from Alliance transferring with the old system. We desperately need Horde only transfers and somehow less Horde heavy servers got them....
---
Oh Nice, now I have to look for that macro, Cheers !
---
DM East is slightly lower then the rest, with DM North and West being notably harder and roughly on par with scholo and strat.
---
I'd rather the moment be like this instead of 8 guildies lining up and saluting me tbh.
---
Multiple people have said their group just got split... Reading comprehension ftw.
---
*looks at the undead sitting down by the fence*
---
Something's not quite right...
---
Sometimes i fantasy what it's like to be lucky and get a rare item.
---
Typical dude, ''hugh hugh just got this item worth 700g, guess i have my epic mount, cool..''
---
FUCK YOU PIECE OF FUCKING SHIT.
---
I don't doubt you're enjoying the game at all. You don't have to install Leatrix. I'm simply trying to show you what it does so you can read through it and decide if it does have something you need or not.
---
If you don't want to install it simply because this is somehow too much for your pride to handle, then don't let me slow you down buddy.
---
They do be like that
---
Priest players would disagree with you.
---
on europe we are stranglely seeing the exact same thing on Zandalar RPPVP, Alliance is much more organized and geared - even tho its a close 5050 split.
---
I had a similar experience where I spent 3 weeks building relationships with a guild I joined and then they kicked me randomly one night. Not one officer or the GM would respond to me on discord to explain what happened to give me any context. I felt really shitty for a few days then just joined a diff guild that treated me with more respect.
---
People can be real assholes in this game sometimes which is kind of surprising considering it seems like most of us are grown ass adults.
---
yay more horde to heartseeker. Maybe I can finally not feel bad about pvping on a pvp server.
---
Mage and paladin can quite easily aoe farm SM and kill the bosses.  If you are capable of healing almost any level 60 can at some rate with your help.
---
Didn't seem to work.
---
What server is that? We have 2 resto druids in our guild and recruiting no more. I have improved MOTW and it’s awesome!
---
Short answer: Yes but it's worse. And if you aim for R13/R14 its just stupid.
---
My sincerest of good luck to everyone who doesn't have Rhok yet. You will be hunters forged by a TRUE challenge. We, who didn't have much competition or rivalry going on whilst doing it, were just lucky to have been one of the first. It was still an epic feeling, don't get me wrong. But if you can do it, you can be even more proud is what I wanna say.
---
I rocked Thunderstrike for ages and it procs really often making it amazing for 5mans and trash in general. Maybe its not that good compared to other raid 2h, but it beats A LOT of preraid 2h in terms of damage
---
To be clear, this doesn't affect me personally nor my guild, but i'm annoyed that it fucks up others.  Can't even imagine what i'd do if we were split like this.
---
No, but early BGs will be announced in a month.
---
Can you pvp as DW fury?  Sure.
---
DW Fury has a couple issues which hurt it vs even 2H fury and even moreso vs arms.
---
First, Dw needs more hit than using a 2her.  You can get by with less, but since so much of DWs damage advantage is tied up in ability to hit the target more times, increasing your miss chance hurts.  You can get more hit, but that often comes at the expense of wearing leather/mail, which hurts your ability to live.
---
Fury in general is less "burst" than Arms while also missing out on the MS debuff.  Burst is important for a warrior in pvp since hey don't have the best ability to just stick on someone unless they have a healer, even then you are more likely to get in range to hit someone 1-2 and they try to get away again.  Outside of ideal situations you are not likely to just stick on them enough to Fury's damage advantage to come through.  Missing out on the MS debuff is also huge because it means the target is simply easily to keep alive.
---
You can pvp as DW fury, and with a decent group you would still be a death machine.  Arms simply has more advantages for pvp, while also having less weaknesses.
---
Slayy35 wants to be elite so bad, listen to him tell a random stranger how great he is, and how bad you are!  Listen to him!!!!  I would rather be in a guild with people that take longer to MC that are not unbearable to be around.  Listening to 35 people like this guy would make me want to blow my brains out.
---
This is gorgeous. I'd love to have this on the wall of my gaming/DnD room.
---
Yup. Good riddance. Find a decent one now.
---
What a stupid thing to say.
---
what's crazy is that it's clearly not and idiots like you are in here putting people down when you're the one that is in fact wrong. look at his other comments in this thread where he explains his reasoning if you don't believe he's genuine
---
Much like being a forum mod I am pretty sure WoW GM attracts 95% assholes who just want to tell people what to do and talk without ever having to take it.
---
Sounds like you dodged a bullet, game still in early phases.
---
Lvl 51 Horde on Grob and the overwhelming majority of my experience is Alliance being chill and leaving me to my business
---
Allaince gets carried by paladins as a whole. Apart from that there is no reason to go alli.  Imagine paladins on horde haha.
---
I was using this  [https://classicdb.ch/?item=2236](https://classicdb.ch/?item=2236)  well up into my thirties and with windfury you're basically deleting mobs.
---
I don't remember how it was in vanilla, but couldn't a warr charge you if he's out of fight, and then use intercept? Thats a way he could have 2 charges
---
Ik it’s off-topic but what’s your combat text addon name? :)
---
There is so much little details and love in there ! I love it all
---
How much ping on Grobbulus if I'm from NA?
---
Cat.
---
I tried transfering last night before I went to sleep, I woke up this morning and im still on the same server (horde) and the "shop" thing on my menu is gone wtf am I supposed to do? Was really excited about changing...
---
You're correct, but thing change when you control the *entire* supply of black lotus. If members of your "mafia" are the only people collecting lotus, then you can control the price.
---
They wouldn't be a nightmare to balance because everyone would roll undead
---
One spawn per zone, with a bit of a range on the timer. They can spawn as quickly as ~50 minutes after the previous one was picked. Each zone has around 10 potential spawn locations.
---
Nice!!!
---
You would have been on a meat grinder, just you would've been grinding the Horde. With Horde leaving your server, it'll balance out a bit on your server and will balance out other servers like Heartseeker a bit. 
---
If Alliance had transferred from Stalagg &amp; Pals, it would only have made things worse on the other already Alliance skewed servers.
---
I dont know if I would ever join one of these raids now with the potential for dishonorable kills
---
Bags are too big  XD
---
Is there any sort of penalty for using an off hand weapon as a mainhand?
---
I remember in BC we got a unique bear mount for killing all the opposing faction leaders, do you get something similar in vanilla?
---
Similar situation happened in one of my groups and the guy opened a ticket and was able to get the carapace transferred to the guy who could use it. Instead of flaming the guy out you should’ve asked if he could correct his mistake.
---
I mained priest with a warrior as primary alt back in vanilla.
---
Wanted to go the hybrid route this time so I went druid and am really enjoying it so far, just hit 50 last night. 
---
The difference between playing a pure class and hybrid is pretty different, but I think the versatility and fun outweighs the negatives. I'm going HotW/NS so being able to tank and heal dungeons is awesome. Late raiding I'll most likely go a full resto spec, I prefer healing.
---
Please can someone give me specific directions to get from the teleporter in Gnomeregan, to the lift? I wanna port there from BB and then leave via the lift to explore the zone outside. I’m an undead rogue.
---
He was perfectly call the whole time.  You just refuse to admit you’re not as good as you think you are
---
I've got a level 19 druid and a level 30 mage both alliance
---
or just... dont do that?
---
Just because you have less information doesnt mean this stuff is completely impossible. Thats ridiculous to think that way... Blizzard made all these raids and no doubt tests them THEMSELVES with the same damn game they give you.. If youre unable to beat the shit without something, they would be like, "Ok, we cant beat this without X, Y, Z, so put these in here.." But THEY managed to do these vanilla raids without all these addons.. How is it possible? So why cant you? It's not that it's "Impossible".. It's just "too hard" is what youre saying. It's too hard and you want the game to be easy.
---
How do world bosses work on pve? Just first to tag it, first to get it, no one gets a chance to contest?
---
get a second account for 1 month and than let him sell the greys on the ah. this way you can buy them and the second account can trade the gold to you alliance alt
---
Aahh gotcha. That would be the mafia part - now it makes sense, thanks :)
---
Laughs in city tram.
---
No idea why, but I feel like Allies on HS are only winning fights because they outnumber Horde 10 to 1. Most Allies I've seen on HS are braindead keyboard turners and it's absolutely hilarious to see them try to win anything 1v1.
---
Don't know about other realms but on mine you very rarely see people looking for groups below brd
---
The price of lotus currently is mostly driven by speculators. There are lots of people buying up lotus to just sit on them. That's not to say that they won't get more expensive (the probably will), but the price point at the moment is not created by people who are actually using flasks.
---
I thought that was in Ashenvale though.
---
Hello, do you pick improved rigtheous fury? Im very interested in doing the same as you
---
They mentioned that they are experimenting more with the back slot items. They even showed wings and such at the panel. Currently officially it’s the RAF that has the backpack only option but I’m certain Shadowlands will add different sources for it as well.
---
So is this the only feature that differs from Atlas? I’m pretty sure that’s what they are asking...
---
Only thing I can say is try to find a guild that plays the game the same way you do. 
---
MMO's have become a lot more clique based.
---
What would you rather have on the subreddit? Pictures of people rolling 69?
---
I love these posts, Gratz to the OP
---
Unless you are leveling solo, it isn't even that good.
---
To activate you have to get the killing blow, not simply get the experience/honor.  In dungeons/raids you are less likely to actually have the killing blow, so it is less likely to activate.
---
Even for PvP it isn't that great since you have to be the one getting the kills.
---
&gt; Yes, the mechanic is called threat and the only to see it is with an add-on.
---
In retail I think the game is designed with these types of addons in mind, since we've had them for so long. But classic wasn't, probably, otherwise blizzard would've made threat-bars a baseline feature. So I think classic content would be doable without addons, it would just take more skill and take longer, which isn't something everyone wants no a days. But if it was like that from the start I think we'd adjust to it.
---
Ashenvale is much brighter than that. The purple hue to the cinematic makes me think more of Teldrassil, but to be fair it could be either.
---
Armor scroll doesnt stack with superior defence elixir in classic. It did on private servers though.
---
Any guild that boots over 1 missed raid when it was told to them and not just a ghosting... is a shit guild. Cut your losses and move on man.
---
source?
---
1. Have you done every quest in a 50+ zone?
---
2. Have you done all of the dungeon quests for 50+ instances for the guaranteed blue items to vendor?
---
3. Have you considered farming level 50 mobs like in blasted lands or dellwood for cloth?
---
Yeah that'd explain it almost everyone is at 60 right now due to phase 2 being about to drop they'll soon return to alts making it easy for you to find groups. Am I allowed to ask how you are looking for players
---
Here, this should be the BIS setup.
---
https://sixtyupgrades.com/set/h4JsYoCJDeoJxaKcw9oUNH
---
I'd love some hard facts to back this claim up. As far as I am aware, the only difference is that you will find pieces with higher +healing, same as you'd find pieces with greater single element damage. But something giving +30 healing vs +30 damage/healing would give the same amount to healing.
---
Yeah been trying to find a guild most of them seem like a cesspool but I guess it's just a case of getting lucky
---
O K Z O O M R
---
Ah tru. Have you tried using raid frames instead of those player frames? Personally I think it looks alot better.
---
Axe of the deep woods + flurry axe. Having to gear for 3% less hit and you get more damage on glancing blows put the swords behind this combo for Orcs. Unless you have edgemasters ofc
---
Vs holy/powerweaving putting sw:p on the boss yes. But not full shadow. Its still a lot more dmg.
---
Usually just through general channels
---
"It's stupid in the same way it was vanilla, so it's fine"
---
there shouldnt even be a debuff limit imo
---
&gt; It's just that we were 36 players and some of them weren't even lvl 60 or geared. So it took some time and they were messy kills.
---
I'm not sure this counts as the typical raid group, then. You're kind of an outlier. And, in the context of this thread's greater discussion, it would make even less sense to boot someone for missing a few weeks for RL stuff when you can't field a full 40.
---
When you can explain me the "illustrated point" of the meme, without using the words "killing" und "jews", I might get it.
---
Yeah but after the first 1000 kills it was more about not letting them win
---
Before OP deleted the question they mentioned they'd made all the gnomish items, hadn't realised discombobulator rays shared the grenade CD but I'm banking (perhaps too optimistically) that blizz will fix it.
---
Well done to Grob Alliance! Very happy to be on a PvP realm where Alliance is a meaningful threat instead of one of the many where Horde has hunted them to extinction.
---
Even when you factor in Nightfall procs?
---
The prot talents are all picked wrong. Remove them and just go 21/0/30 and be done with it. You don't need prot talents to tank 5 mans, consec is enough, and you're not gonna tank anything else so...
---
You got downvoted but you’re absolutely correct. None of my tanks are hit capped and I have to watch the threat meter carefully.
---
Engineering is incredibly helpful yes but it is not mandatory in any way. I’d of course highly recommend engineering but I made it to R12 without it back in the day - though competition is going to be more fierce this go around I believe.
---
lvl40 arms talent Mortal strike. This is **HUGE** when you get it and makes a world of difference.
---
i cant tell if this is true or not
---
I just want to thank everyone who made such a fuss about this addon lately.  Went and downloaded it last night, had fun using it to clown on a NE hunter trying to mess with people in xroads last night!
---
So why wasn't these technical details hidden before the Cataclysm fiasco?
---
Like i said....bad druids get slept. Unless u dont dot me u cant hibernate....n if ur not dotting ur not gonna be doing dmg and I could easily out dmg ur healing and wont be burning mana nearly as fast. All in all yea druid 1v1 is lame over all and I'm not engaging unless they do first...or until honor comes out. But druid is by far one of the classes most people play incredibly wrong pvp wise
---
I'd suggest joining the lfg channel (/join lfg) and doing it there 2
---
Look at me, im sweating in Classic
---
Shit guild -&gt; you don't want to be in that guild.
---
Kicking was the best thing they could do for you.
---
Its like getting dumped. It was never going to work out if that was their attitude, they did you a favor.
---
It occurred to me a couple days ago that it's not the boss fights that define the difficulty of a dungeon, it's really the trash.  DM trash is pretty easy compared to both sides of strat, LBRS, even the end of BRD.
---
Garr periodically purges a buff off of you.  Noggenfogger adds a dummy buff that can be pushed off in place of a real buff afaik. Similar deal to why you get warlocks to cast Water Breathing on you
---
There should be faction specific queues then.
---
I wish the editor had thought the same thing.
---
It's pretty damn important.
---
I doubt you knew that either if it took you that long to reply.
---
Out of The teleporter, you turn right twice.
---
He should change venue to uk
---
&gt;but I feel like the Alliance RP harder about PvP.
---
If you are alliance, how would you know the level of RP on the horde side? Horde has to suffer from the non RP zerg of End Boss, while alliance has the non RP zerg of Conclave.  
---
Non RP zerg guilds sacking cities is no measure of RP.
---
Animaniacs reference.
---
Have updoots.
---
Could have saved about 200g if you went for zeal over krol
---
Ah yes that is what I meant. Good to know, thanks.
---
Everyone has their own reasons for picking their faction.  I wanted to experience horde in classic as I had multiple alliance 60s in vanilla.
---
I believe its a WA Myosin has.  Not for sure though.
---
That's what I think too.
---
Because I stole it from the Retail subreddit.
---
most likely, sir.
---
Try interface&gt;display&gt;player chat bubbles.
---
Have you told them you're back now and see if they'll reinvite?
---
If they have a warning that would kind of defeat the purpose
---
Reddit hyperbole knows no bounds, obviously.
---
Assuming you can put together a group with no other miners.
---
Your failure at a half-intelligent rebuttal just proved even further that you're clueless and have no idea what you're talking about :)
---
You don't need to be a good player to get sub 3 hour raids, a job or family isn't going to make you bad at the game.
---
Now keep blaming non-factors for being bad at a video game :)
---
Do you have this in a printable size? I definitely would like to frame this.
---
Join a new guild. There's better out there.
---
Or... get back to that world pvp faster for ranking better!!
---
You might find me spamming trade chat in Orgrimmar offering to open lockboxes from atop the mailbox
---
Sounds like you're a coward for not rerolling Alliance
---
Do you have some sort of mental illness that requires people to reply instantly in an online debate or their comments are invalidated?
---
It's pretty dumb of you to reply to my comment with nothing but distrust, instead of arguing your case?
---
Come on over to heartseeker you beautiful hordanians. We could use some more dungeon battles and zone wars.
---
Prices for devilsaur leather on the AH are dropping fast, only 7g each now.
---
Not really worth it anymore.
---
And your stuck in combat the whole time unable to mount away
---
Fury warrior is pretty good, I gold farm there often. If you happen to be horde side on Herod you are welcome to tag along for feee to get your cap.
---
&gt; Mate.. I said this before.. ADDONS WERE IN VANILLA. People used them in raids back then as well. They are not new. I played vanilla. I used addons. Many of them.
---
I didnt say they werent, I didnt say they didnt, I didnt say they are, I didnt say you didnt, and I didnt say you didnt.
---
I said the people who MADE THE GAME, created it AND TESTED IT.. after agreeing that what they give you is enough to beat the raids with AS THE GAME STANDS. If they didnt think it was beatable, they would make it easier, like you said, or give you those little crappy tools that monitor threat and track everything.
---
&gt; Let me put it like this. If I ask you to develop a game and it's only allowed to have one button, but I get to make one that has ten buttons... who do you think can make the more complex and challenging game?
---
That depends.. Does the computer click those buttons for you?
---
I honestly wouldn't be concerned about your faction gains as long as you're doing quests.  Whenever you get rep for one alliance faction, you get a small amount (10-25%?) for the other factions too.  Honored is not too tough to get to.
---
More like making a dwarf and exploring Coldridge Valley, but the sentiment is the same. Sometimes I run around there with my higher-level character just to get back that nostalgic feeling.
---
Which ones?
---
It'll depend greatly on luck imo. But 300g or so should be doable.
---
I was broke at 40 after buying my mount and important skills. Just hit 50 last night and after buying my important skills have ~150g. So at 60 I should have between 300-400g. I haven't had much luck with BoEs and I vendor most things except mats and items worth 5+g.
---
Will of the forsaken was created when they took away their undead status.
---
Are they not linking the item in chat and saying roll at the same time? That sounds like a confusing mess if they just say roll without linking the item.
---
they certainly stack with the paladin aura. can confirm firsthand as a tank =)
---
Wasn't in phase 1 gear, this is.
---
Yeah. I am 39 and my pet is 38.
---
So, you basically say, everyone deserves proper compensation for their time, except if a tank spends an hour in a dungeon carrying shitter dps they don't deserve to be compensated? Gotcha.
---
Old days, I was playing RTCW with my friends, with dial-up connection. I was having lag problems. Someone said pull the phone cable from modem and try again. And I did...
---
Which faction?  As horde the boats with 2-3 rogues and a druid healer are quite good.  Wait for dishonorable debuff to fall off of people and kill them before the boats leave.  Constant stream of new people mean you don't get many decayed kills.  Rez point is super close if you get overrun.  Water below means the druid can escape easily and being on the docks means hunters/mages cannot kite very well.  
---
Watch it though there are 3-4 civilians near where the docks meet the land.  
---
I don't have much experience on alliance, but I always remember them farming in the entrance to undercity trying to catch flagged people coming off the zepplin, same idea new people all the time and a lot of paths to evade if you get zerged.  
---
Farming spots are ok, but you diminish your honor by killing the same people.  Dungeon/raid zone ins are good, but you are likely to get zerged.  Scholo/Strat/DM are isolated enough that the risks of getting zerged is far less then BRM camping.
---
Never heard of either of those 2 guilds
---
Everlook EU, it's one of the biggest german pve servers and it feels like there is 1 druid for every 100 raiders over here. Every MC raid I've been in had 0-2 druids, I see more lvl 60 druids running around with tier 1 than without its kinda crazy.
---
It matters 100% after bgs are released.  You are still competing for honor against the entire server, not the crossrealm.  So if you are struggling to rank up because there are 15,000 horde each week trying verse 5,000, which do you think you have better odds in ranking up quickly?
---
Yes you are
---
Punish the people on the minority faction who are already being absolutely wrecked every day. Force them to suck it up or reroll. Great job, Blizzard.
---
What race are you?
---
If you can get quel serrar get it, that’s one of the bis weapons for tanks
---
I won't be dotting you at all, just hibernating. 
---
Genuine question - would you be able to put out sufficient dps if you're having to switch form every other global? Assuming you have 6k mana and I have 3.8k hp, you open on me - I try to hibernate so you shift (5316 mana). You then get one Claw attack and have to shift again (4632). Repeat another six times and you're oom but I can warstomp and regrowth+rejuv or NS+HT10 at any point (puts me on 4785-6000 mana).
---
I'd love to see something like this but Kharanos themed :)
---
And you are basing that on what exactly?
---
Except you literally don't need that for a game as easy as WoW Classic. The raid mechanics are a joke, your PVE rotations are a joke so there's no excuse other than just not being good at the game. Which is fine, I just don't want to see stupid excuses.
---
Did they only change to blue when alliance could get Shamans???
---
Thank, exactly what I am thinking.
---
But these people can’t live with the fact that not everyone has to clear everything in record times. They also don’t like it when you have fun enjoying the slow pace of the game.
---
I’m in IT, dawg. Being groomed for a director position at a $1b+ company. Dunno what smaller places are like, but the work never ends if you’re proactive and good at IT in a large org. At the very least, OP should be doing professional dev instead of watching Netflix on the job.
---
So you're replacing one addon for 2 addons? (probably a lot more addons if we go indepth of what an addon like VuhDo Classic does)
---
How does that help?
---
We've got 2 in our guild.
---
Undead lul
---
Nobody uses general channel except barrens for example. Since LFG channel is overwhelmed with level 60 dungeons, it's good to sit in barrens and wait for a WC group to pop up for example. Dunno how this works for allies. Stay in Westfall maybe?
---
and you don't anywhere else?
---
Back in vanilla (and classic) lotus had ridged 8 hour respawn times so it was pointless to really camp the spawn points. On private servers it more flexible with them perpetually spawning every 8 hours so you could camp the spawn points. Rather than having the 8 hours cool down start only when it’s been picked.
---
Well he deleted it. So I guess he agrees ;)
---
Yeah, I'm not sure everyone had the same experience in vanilla but I remember it being the same. Alliance dominated most battlegrounds and were generally more organized, at least on the battleground my servers were in.
---
Big fan, btw! Love your content.
---
That guy is saying the classic passive aggressive nonsense where The discussion doesn’t go your way so you go after the person.
---
Leave that shitty Druid to beav it in his turtle ass raid group.  Broke ass boomers probably don’t buy consumables or pull mobs quick enough.
---
If I had to choose one it would probably be fishing, but yes you want both maxed to get full value.
---
Have look through the top 50 horde guilds on warcraftlogs and tell me how many full-time ele shamans you see (not a resto doing damage on ragg).
---
I noticed that there can be bugs if you do assignments in combat, like the icon will update to the proper blessing, but the spell cast is a different one.  
---
I try to just use it as a monitor and cast buffs on players manually.
---
It prevents you from using the armor scroll if you have superior defense active. I think you're mistaken.
---
This is a great first start.  If you're looking for input for future updates.  You should try to add map markers and a legend on the side for bosses, quest mobs, and other useful information.  The book spawn points in Dire Maul for example.
---
Quel’serrar with edgemaster’s, or perdition’s blade with mugger’s belt or aged core leather gloves.
---
Perds being the better of the two but also hardest to obtain
---
So the person who is doing the killing outside of the group has to be able to get experience from the mobs. For example a level 60 can't kill a level 10 mob outside of a group and get a lvl 8 player full xp. A level 60 however can kill a level 48 mob outside of a group and give whatever level player hit the mob full xp. If that same mob was level 47 it would not work.  
---
Basically whoever is doing the killing has to be a level where the mob would give experience if it wasn't tagged by another player. I also found this wasn't working in instances by dropping group like old school wow was. It only worked in the open world.
---
Its got nothing to do with brigading or witch hunts it's simply about warning people about malicious intentions so they do waste their time. Without it this post is completely pointless. One of the guilds on the realm is dodgy ? How informative.
---
I agree with your second point though. It is something that could be easily abused (like the in-game report system)
---
Who cares. It helps my point. Point being: get paid. People try to get money in whatever way in the econ. No profession needs to charge 20g for one enchant, but they do. I can charge 1st orb or boes or 20g then. If not find another tank. I always laugh when people rage at me in whispers then 40 mins later are still spamming for a tank.
---
Did he ask for your opinion on weather buffs are required or not or did he ask for a consumable list?
---
You have to be somewhat close in levels.
---
Damn that Sounds awesome :P
---
Literally 20-40 People taking time out of their day (prolly like 20mins depending where in Azshara it was) just to come and gank you :P
---
40*20 = 800min = 13+ hours you have just taken away from those People. That is a lot of Money when you think average income 15$ = 270$ just to gank you xD
---
There's is alrdy a dungeon Map add on?  I think I downloaded Atlas and I don't think it works.  
---
 I got atlas loot and that works good.
---
I usually keep it to the left of my character and my target to the right. But I dragged them out of the way for this screenshot.
---
We clear MC in 1hour 15 minutes and we are not your tryhard bunch (they clear it in 30 minutes)
---
It never seemed to happen to me until I reached ~53 and now it feels like a coin toss every time.
---
censusplusclassic addon
---
eg: https://imgur.com/a/eXYCWSV
---
&gt; The devs didn't think to design threat bars so the game was intended to be played without them?
---
I mean, they would've surely looked at other games at the time like Everquest and Dark Age of Camelot, which both have threats in them (as far as I know, could be a different situation).
---
They made threat into a mechanic and made a choice not to make it visible to the players. That has to be a deliberate choice. Then when people started using addons, they might as well thought that threat got so trivialized that they just went the other way and made it almost an non-issue.
---
I played Lord of the Rings Online, a couple of years ago, and they didn't even allow addons, only cosmetic skins. Don't know how it is now, but it worked back then for many years.
---
I honestly think it would be fun if a client of WoW Classic came out that didn't allow addons, it would bring a whole new level of thinking and skill into the game - then again, I like difficult games.
---
Buuut wait, wouldn't a troll hunter be more for PvE and an orc for PvP?
---
They stated that they will not be touching loot. They did this before classic release.
---
As much as blizz is fucking up these days, at least they're sticking to their word for once.
---
Pride
---
You're so full shit and putting words in my mouth, pathetic.
---
A) Sub 2-3 hours is not even close to record time lmao (record time is 28 minutes).
---
B) I don't care how you enjoy the game just don't LIE about why you're not performing and giving bad excuses, it's pathetic. 
---
C) I don't care at what pace you clear raids, once again, I care when you're posting bullshit reasons.
---
Point is make money. Don't like a tank charging or asking for orb/BoEs? Wait as long as possible for a tank who is most likely fresh and not geared. Idgaf how you waste your time. My time is more valuable than running shit dps for free.
---
Hah, only one of us is running away. Why don’t you go run to your safe-space with your other fellow cowards
---
Seeing as you're elemental, when frostbrand crits it will do a ton of damage due to elemental fury.  These crits will likely skew the numbers in its favor.
---
Marginally worse for the server, much better for the players leaving.
---
Mage are the new hunter
---
You aren’t lying, I play a rogue and live off hitting the backs of these back peddlers lol
---
ic, whell im more thinking phase 2 pvp for now. wich if im not mistaken is just open world? or is it not?
---
This has been a topic has been a bit of a discussion amongst my friends and guildmates, A lot of them claim Elegant Leggings of Healing is better than Senior Designer’s Pantaloons when it comes to general and raid healing. They are very knowledgeable people, but no other resource out there I’ve seen talks about these.  I argue the additional intellect and spirit is more important than the +22 healing power, plus over healing is bound to happen, so it’s more worthwhile to have the extra mana. As a new player, I can’t really say if there claims are valid or not. What say you?
---
:) Thank you for the information! I'll keep that in mind as I look for one.
---
Not sure why you were downvoted, this is true, on the stalagg discord, there are horde players who love the imbalance, because they have zero chance of winning a fair fight.
---
Watching streamers meltdown and reroll on pve servers is gonna run me out of popcorn.
---
That's gorgeous. It has such a perfect cool early-morning look to it.
---
Insert salty skeram horde here?
---
Sorry for the late reply, most DPS addons (Recount did this first so its real old technology) already communicate between eachother, the deal is everyone in the raid needs to use the same DPS meter to get a correct reading.
---
Kinda remember it like this aswell, at least for trying to bid/buy stuff from same faction.
---
Never tried it with crossfaction, but I assume its accountwise and doesnt work either.
---
You miss retail?
---
What's the channel/times they run?
---
Are you saying you want to play undead?
---
It generates a small amount, maybe 200 or so.
---
Blacksmithing and you can pick locks.

What's the channel/time they run?

He didnt understand the concept of the backpack visual being on the cape slot.

They threw you a party!
---
&gt; Prior to the game coming out the community trended heavily towards private server power gamers that had some very severe opinions about playing the game, it makes sense because they were discussing a 15 year old game that didn’t come out for another year, so of course enthusiasts dominated the demographic. Having browsed the subreddit since the game was announced, the change in discussion and opinion compared to now is dramatic. You will still see it on some comments here, like mage, priest, and warrior being the only classes worth playing, Druids are only useful for wsg flag, engineering is the only useful profession, #nochanges for any reason ever, shit like that. Their domination of the early community discussion pushed people towards min maxing, which favored horde. 
---
In what way does it favor the Horde? The majority of the hardcore PVP/PVE guilds are Alliance and for a good reason, Paladins are absurdly overpowered. Most of the content available from hardcore players on Youtube is dominated by alliance representation for an obvious reason, hardcore players are more likely to choose Alliance.
---
Horde is simply the more fashionable faction to pick right now. The Undead Male effect is in full swing right now.
---
I would go to Desolace and farm all the creatures just north of your troll village there (the name escapes me at the moment), they fill the area just east of that mountain range. The basilisks drop the best vendor trash in the territory and the thunder lizards/buzzards/hyenas aren't bad either.
---
If they are too low level for you there is a spot full of the beasts to the E/SE outside of the valley that has the undead in it.
---
I would do nothing but grind those mobs until you hit 40. You may not have made up the 85g that you need (plus spells- but only buy the ones that are necessary for you at that time, don't waste gold buying ALL the spells) but you will be a lot closer.
---
Check AH prices on the 'white' drops and see if any of them are worth keeping so you can sell. I am not a miner but I believe there is a lot of iron deposits in the area which may help out your income too.
---
Damn dude, you should seriously work on your anger. Just look through your comments in the past hours and how upset you got over how someone else plays a video game.
---
I'd rather have 10 hour MC runs than being as pissed as you are. Get well soon.
---
Imagine if it did work like that, though. Would be bonkers for AV
---
Get your story straight, the villain was more likely Adolph Hitler and OP is Albert Einstein.
---
Unfortunately, R14 isn't merit based for the most part, especially back in Vanilla.  People actually got R14 AV spamming back then.  They wouldn't even touch the top RP bracket on Classic, which will likely be filled by premades running 10 mans once WSG releases, and doubly so for AB.
---
Just add Chench. He comes on at 2 server and logs off at 11 server.
---
Playing Horde is playing in a safe space.
---
I haven’t logged in today yet, but I was under the assumption it was coming today or on Thursday.
---
Hmm, I figured that would only work for chat, so I never messed with it. and I'm actually talking about the info on the borders of the panel, not the actual chat font size. 
---
It shows like FPS, MS, bag space, etc.
---
They were supposed to be. There was talk of a blue post days ago that said it was going to be faction specific. Seems like blizz just fucked up and didn’t lock it right away for some crazy reason. The information was out there though.
---
I mean, I'm lucky to make 2g from the lock box anyway, so yeah, I don't have a problem with not tipping well for boxes. 
---
I normally wait for the loot before I tip, so I can assess how much it was worth, and then tip 25% of that. Except one time this rogue got mad because I didn't tip in my original trade window, so I just didn't tip that guy at all.
---
There was a bug that allowed alliance to transfer for a little while yesterday. It was fixed quickly, but some made it through
---
Frost mages have become super-FOTM in classic ('muh spellcleave!')
---
There seems to be relatively few locks around, which is a shame
---
When you sacrifice so much gear for FR a lot of the time your tanks will have very low stamina. On our first ragnaros kills we also struggled with tanks just getting bursted down by regular hits even with 4 healers on them. A flask of the titans did wonders for us, just on the MT. The OT was fine without one since they barely tanked due to resisting the knockbacks.
---
Dudes name is Summonn, just W him and where you want to go
---
The only time i saw a mage asking money for water, people laughed at him.
---
Also, nothing stop a tank to be enchanter and alchemist to make money. Being a tank isn't what stop them to make money. They don't need to charge reserve to have money, they do it just because they are a minority. Not because it's the only way for them to get money.
---
The problem is mobs (be they physical or virtual) are notoriously bad at handing out a measured punishment. 
---
Bandwagons like this can be literally just as vicious towards some dude that tried to steal a shitty blue as they would be towards an actual child molester. It's not actually about the punishment anymore, but the glee of uniting against a "bad guy".  
---
I know people here won't like this, but if you went out of your way to make a character on his realm just to send him hate, you're not actually good guys, in fact, I'd think you're really, really weird for doing that and not any less of an asshole than this guy was for what he did. 
---
I mean the mere fact that pedophiles came to mind for you as a comparison to some guy trying to steal an item in a video game is very telling. We don't actually know anything about this person, he did something wrong, but I don't think he deserves randos sending him hate mail.
---
Can you farm ZF while playing another game
---
So smart, but you didn't even reply meaningfully.
---
I do this in ubrs too. Pull 2 rooms together at the start, mad rage and that rage allows me to keep aggro on both packs sooo with prehots and maulswipetab
---
A macro cannot react to a combat event as far as I know.
---
make sure it's a really trustworthy guildie.  we have had several stories  sob stories on this reddit from people who got screwed by 'trusted friends'
---
No it wouldn't be. 
---
TBH since Vanilla and to this day, I have never jumped on the "you have to use this class with this race because of this racial" player anyways. So yes, first and foremost make what you want to make. You'll be happier.
---
yeah this was just if you didn't want to do dungeons because they can get so boring
---
i like how everyone in this post is assuming that OP is tell the truth 100% and no leaving any important details out
---
&gt;Should I tank in Instances where I over level it, to learn more tanking or should it be fine to jump into instances such as SM GY/Lib for 2-3 run to learn more tanking?
---
Does not compute. You ARE over level for SM GY/Lib. You can easily tank Armory at level 37, and you'll probably be ok in Cath.
---
is that I always hear Alliance whining and crying about big meanie Hordie beating on them and running away to low pop servers so they don’t get attacked despite rolling on a pvp server?
---
Unfortunately you have to stay BS to use the trinket.
---
You can win but its a tough fight with no margin for error.
---
I just use the website, everything else has fucked me one way or the other
---
A passive aggressive malding boomer is telling me I should work on my anger hahahhahaha
---
Have fun with your terrible guild :) I'm sure you're perfectly calm replying to each and every one of my comments with your pathetic passive aggressiveness :DD
---
If i dont have it by friday, i will continue to complain!
---
Organizing PvP fights?  Or legitimately wintrading HKs between factions?  Because if it's the latter you should report and hope they're dumb enough to have said something in game.
---
I transferred from biggles to anethema... I regret it. Alli outnumber horde 2/1 it feels. Low pop so AH prices are goofy but most night have no problem finding a group. Last night we found a PUG for BRD within 30 mins
---
It's not about how much total damage they deal, the mark adds a static amount of DPS, and not a whole lot of it. Need to do the math on that, but I'm guessing around 20-ish per hunter. Healing priest using sw:p is like 60 DPS.
---
Not from my experience playing vanilla. Because of a lack of knowledge of the game, flasks were pretty much mandatory for progressing through BWL, and always mandatory for AQ and Naxx.
---
So you don't even have a valid argument but just repeat what you already said?
---
Damn seems like you just **have to be** right.
---
Calm down dude, I get it, you're elite and everyone knows now. Go on with your life :)
---
Shaman.  Throwing chain lightning and chain heals is  tons of fun.
---
We're down to 1 layer now, that change went in around 12hrs ago, but still no keyring :(
---
This is why we have server imbalance. People fussing over the smallest of disadvantage.
---
about 1 in 20,000
---
I drink every 4 or 5 pulls and try to time it with an oom healer. I'll fill up faster and pull with regrowth ff behind a wall while they finish drinking.
---
No I would play Alliance if I decide on Warrior
---
At level 50 horde is it worth doing the quest to gain access thru north Felwood?
---
I'd be interesting to see a video of you attempting the action and what server you're playing on so we can identify how the issue manifests, idiot.
---
Haha yea, that would be ridiculous
---
Yup, threat cap much higher and 10% more stats, which will scale forever as gear gets better and better.
---
I was hoping it was a console command or something. But that's true, I could just fight naked and flex on some gnome mages.
---
It has probably been answered before but I just started playing Classic, are BG's available now or will they be phased in?  If they are to be phased in, is there a timetable as to when they will be?  Thank you!  I miss Alterac Valley and Warsong!
---
I will complain with you!

We had 0 warlocks. Spammed for a PUG warlock, got a lvl 58, he forgot his key, nemesis helm dropped, DE'd.
---
Is that a question or a statement? Is it dumb for me to not trust you, some random person on the internet? I dont think so.
---
They can play whatever they want if their guild is fine with it.
---
But there is no reason to besides the one I explained.
---
Was it really that hard for them to take ANY preemptive measures to ensure servers aren't 70-30 faction imbalance?
---
Surely they could've never taken any steps to prevent that. Right? Completely free of all blame. Players should celebrate them slapping a band aid on a severed limb! 
---
Look guys it's all fixed, our 70-30 balanced realms are now 69-31. Thanks blizz!
---
same with pagle, horde is very outnumbered.
---
Dun Morogh or Trisfal Glades
---
Of course I'm repeating what I said, because everyone who has any knowledge of MC knows that there is no good excuse for going over 3 hours unless you're terrible at the game (like you). 
---
Imagine still arguing because you don't want to admit you're bad at a video game looooool
---
Yeah it might come with the Thursday update. I’m pretty sure I remember reading that was the case somewhere.
---
Yeah, we get it. This is like the 6th or 7th post about it.
---
&gt;I mean what mage doesn't almost always start with sheep anyways in an open world duel
---
Probably any new vanilla wow mage players

Thumbnail made me think this was gonna be some Boomie POV pvp. I'm happy for you but just a tad disappointed.
---
This is why we have server imbalance.
---
People percieve the smallest of disadvantage, get scared, and then demand service/jump ship.
---
only a hardcore guild progressing through naxx would do that.
---
so yeah, in a way its good that you are no longer in that guild

Well I’m not going to look the recipes up just to answer yes or no. Instead I gave them the tools to answer their own question and any similar question after that. Imo more “meaningful” then just saying yes or no.

50 seems a bit low, but you’ll want to do that chain eventually. It’s not too bad.

Smileys and "hahahahaha" won't cover how insecure and angry you are.

Also, you can't really attack me for being passive aggressive when you literally have to throw insults, because you can't accept another ones opinion.

That change is happening right now with the current maint
---
Why do I see on warcraft logs that on different realms they do significant more than others?
---
Mining is a complete bitch to level so GL.
---
I truly do not think we can help you there. Buying in game snacks and drinks to make yourself look different as whole basis on choosing that, I think is pretty redundant of itself. I mean you should know it is orc, troll and tauren for shaman, including both male and female genders, so you technically have 6 choices for a race as a shaman.
---
Honestly I feel like this is a design flaw more so than something you can bandaid.
---
Paladin: Heal set, Tank set, Dps set (ap), Dps set (spell), PvP heal set, PvP Dps set, various other unique style/rp items or sets.
---
Engineer: atleast 1-2 bags full of different soulbound engi trinkets or gadgets.
---
Every class: \~2-3 bags for special unique trinkets, pets, questrewards or other vanity items which you cant obtain ever again if you would destroy or sell them so you hold onto them.
---
That leaves a little free space for things like basic consumables or some crafting materials which you always want to have accessible and not want to wait 1h for them to arrive per mail from your bank alt. 
---
Just using the "return to sender" option from my bank alt is not always an option because you might not want to return everything at once, or you might play multiple alts already which both are spamming your bank alts full.
---

Not sure if Freudian Slip or referencing the film.

I'm not going to spend 20 minutes dissecting the meme and why Inglorious Bastards is the perfect movie to be used for memes as opposed to something like Schindler's List.

Undead lyfe
---
I don't know the exact ratio, but it doesn't take a genius to log on alliance and horde. Go to the capital city and see the massive difference. We need more Horde, if not for pvp for group making.
---
I actually mopped up ungoro (tons of quests)&gt;felwood (perfect at 52)&gt;WPL(53/54)&gt;winter spring(54/55)&gt;EPL(56+) in between all of this starting at 55 do BRD as it has a lot of your bis healing shit. Then do all the high level dungeons between questing post 57 like strat live/UD, BRD, UBRS/LBRS and DM has some good loots too. 
---
That’s an ugly looking response to your question but the point is there’s plenty of questing zones to go to and dungeons to run with worthwhile gear. If you get burnt out of one do the other 50-60 is the home stretch.GL :D 
---
PS: IMO it gets tough to heal those high level dungeons as shadow past 55. Not impossible just a pain in the ass.
---
Actually gnomes have the second largest mount size after tauren
---
Idk, all X Y and Zs friends play horde and are on server A. They lock out horde now on that server. You just alienated three people from playing. Idk how you fix it exactly..
---
Consumables are pre prep. Only class buffs would be more fun
---
&gt; has to pay the cost of the de/vendor
---
Good idea.
---
Either way, if people don't roll on the first roll, they certainly won't count against the +1 if someone takes them for PvP or whatever other reason. That said, 3 people rolled on the wand, IDK why. It's not such a shit wand, I'd like to get my hands on it for the FR alone and also since I'd actually use it as a healing Priest, but I wouldn't blow my roll on the first boss on it, either.
---
Int isn't a top stat because you may be able to cast an extra heal or two once you stack enough, but if your healing power is high enough you can get 2 downranked heals for the same or higher healing done due to healing coefficients. Int is an upside, but not a priority. Spirit and Mp5 hold more weight than int because it allows for more heals regardless of your total mana pool. Most fights aren't long so +healing is king, but if you're not in a guild that easily downs every boss very quickly/going OOM it's better to look at mp5/spirit and eat the reduced +healing until you find a balance that works. Generally, +healing will be king though and mp5/spirit nice to have/second priority with int coming in third. That being said, I've been using Senior designer's myself.
---
Why do you want to transfer out? I love Bigglesworth, Horde and Alliance are both full of plenty of good folk.
---
neither
---
oof that's a lot of cathedral
---
Spy addon is literally a goddamn wallhack, so yes
---
Why did they not open things like Heartseeker (A) to Stalagg (A)?  Heartseeker is like 82/18 A/H while Stalagg is 25/75 A/H

I am a lvl 39 Warlock, which dungeons are good for me right now? Can I go Uldaman or is it too early?
---
I love this kind of content.  Do more for different cities and destinations.
---
Just follow [Jame's Alliance Leveling Guide - Chapter I (30-41) [old version]](http://www.wow-pro.com/leveling_guides/jame039s_alliance_leveling_guide_chapter_i_3041_old_version)  
---
It explain how to get them.
---
Honestly I barely ever eviscerate as daggers. Maybe once a raid lol
---
I didn't know this. So like each unique player can only give you honor four times each day?
---
Skeram was like 60/40 horde/alliance, totally playable, before all the allies jumped ship at the first available transfer. So the alliance ran from that, but I should transfer to a 80/20 server like heartseeker? There's no winning in this situation.
---
that's a good point! Forgot that there are no capital cities for both factions like it is in retail 
---
I generally like alliance cities more
---
Mine is casual as shit and we're doing it in 3-4 hours now. And that's with a lengthy backroom break after Garr, and overall a pretty slow raid pace.
---
&gt;Sorry but this is not true at all. Engineering is pretty much mandatory if you plan on doing any form of PvP for an extended amount of time.
---
And yet, I managed Rank 14 in Vanilla without it.  It's not necessary.
---
It's a bit of a hassle but worth doing for Domo and Rag, especially if you are only missing a couple douses.
---
Certainly helped me to get from 39 to half way to 41 pretty quick!

Stalagg Alliance player who is sticking with it here. Let me show you just how bad the launch experience was for alliance players.
---
[https://imgur.com/a/ZH3wHnK](https://imgur.com/a/ZH3wHnK)
---
That is censusplus data taken at primetime of stalagg a week after release. It shows a 63/37 split. At the time this was the worst major US pvp server faction ratio. While there were on average 60% more horde players at any one time than alliance players it was still manageable even if it was already resembling a horde pve server. Then transfers opened up. The first wave actually didnt hurt us too bad, it was mostly only soft people, and there seemed to be the opinion that the servers available to take transfers were dead.

---
That is the data after the first wave. The ratio shifted from 63/37 to 67/33, almost a perfect 2:1 ratio
---
Then the second wave happened and it REALLY hurt. People who were trying to tough it out started seeing the effects of overwhelming faction dominance. Farming out in the world during primetime was impossible, every dungeon run required corpse runs, mats that cant be obtained in instances start becoming extremely expensive, finding groups outside of primetime becomes hard, world chat slows down to a crawl during the day. People who are otherwise fine with playing the underdog being to leave.
---
As far as PvP goes world PvP on servers this one sided is largely a lie. From the very beginning being outnumbered by 60% discouraged alliance to even try to PvP outside of organized groups because of fear of the 1v1 turning into a 1v2 or 1v3 and then getting corpse camped. The problem has only gotten worse. For example my guild actually gotten about 20 people together for some BRM pvp on an offnight where we would try to hold the thorium point side door. It actually worked out for about 10 minutes before enough horde accumulated, not by organization, but by sheer foot traffic, to zerg us down 40 to 20. We settled for the passage between BRM and Kargath which worked out much better.
---
Not all is lost. Alliance actually has most of the top guilds on the server and we control the mountain on some occasions, but im not looking forward to not being able to take flight paths starting thursday.
---
cake day
---
Spicy!
---
I like glue too!  What are your favorite recipes?
---
Can a player escape a PvP fight by using the unstuck option (which teleports them to graveyard)?
---
You're taking this all too seriously mate, this is a videogame, play what you like not what "your guild is ok with"... This is not Apes, if you're not a wanker and can help the group out you get a spot.
---
Noob hunter here. Do pets gain loyalty through time spent with you? Swear I saw my pet level in loyalty as I was roaming around in UC. But I'm not certain because it was around the time I discovered UC I think so uncertain if it was just really close to going up a tier (Still low level on this alt.)
---
Second question is do they gain XP from PvP kills?
---
Well with our servers that's a tough cookie, being the only RP server.
---
But honestly in the long run I feel this will have to happen. Like a year from now this is going to become an issue.
---
You deleted your very wrong reply to me, which was "combat log was not like you say hurr Durr" . I spent a lot of time making fun of you for that. 
---
You didn't know what you were talking about in your reply and you're still full of shit now that you've deleted it.
---
The reason you're losing PvP 1v1 is because you refuse to learn your class, not some add-on. Your complete lack of research while confidently telling me I'm wrong tells me all I need to know about you skills in pvp.
---
Learn to play noob, and spy won't wreck your day anymore
---
It’s not too late
---
I still havent heard a good reason why this is a bad thing. 
---
"But new people cant come in and compete for weapons"
---
Um... good?
---
&gt;Did he ask for your opinion on weather buffs are required or not or did he ask for a consumable list?
---
Snowy and cold. All week, brrr.
---
Too early for Uldaman since the endboss is around 48 or something. You are in perfect levelrange for SM Cathedral tho.
---
If you are trying to go pure threat generation, yes the higher the dps on a faster weapon will be better.  Higher dps is better because it will do more damage since tank abilities are largely not weapon dmg based, and faster is better for more heroic strike rage dumping.
---
That being said the difference in using Perds and Quelserrar is not some night and night difference.
---
Thank you for this, and to the people who posted the Atlas links.  I didn't know such a thing existed!
---
Thing is getting to level 26 really should only take like 24 hrs of game time probably less. That means your friend plays like 2 hrs a week or is extremely inefficient
---
You call your guild a static?  Well, unlike XIV, there’s lots of math in classic.  The short answer is Quel'Serrar unless you’re an Orc.
---
Ok boomer 
---
Go pop a bubble and continue to not do dps
---
Damn 350! That is a lot for the set, What server?
---
Buy them all
---
I mean, you're not wrong on the surface, but one of the things I was looking forward to in coming back was revisiting zones that I haven't seen for over a decade.
---
I will accept you into my pet stables, just lemme know your favorite food so I can keep you at max happiness
---
If you want max rank i dont hope you have a dayjob
---
/unstuck with no HS will just kill you, so you may as well die and you'll be ported to the GY anyway.
---
SM cath and RFD. I think the last boss in Ulda is 47 so you may want to wait a level or two.
---
I think is has a timer (like "Exit Game"), so no.

Yeah. The aesthetics are totally different. If you tend to prefer alliance probably go warrior. Horde is just so different, you know?
---
Yes, please transfer off of stalag if you're horde. Thank you!

If you have to ask a question like this, you shouldn't even be thinking about max rank.

Rank 14 is full on, no life, play all day every day for months on end mode.
---
They aren't skilled, just very practiced and prepared...
---
?
---
Rank14 has nothing to do with skill, and everything to do with grinding battlegrounds 12 hours a day.
---
Form official there's only three - WorldDefence, LookingForGroup and LookingForGuild  
---
You could see them in Chat-Settings-Global Channels.  
---
People also create and use some custom channels, like LFG and world. But it's very server-specific.  
---
Just ask in /Trade
---
Oh poor you.
---
Hunter DPS is competitive in this phase, especially early in the phase before a lot of Rag/Ony weapons have been divied out to melees. But come AQ we fall off hard because most of us are still using Rhok Delar (xbow of smiting is a low drop rate) and otherwise don't scale as hard as other classes.
---
Reral.
---
Hunter at the top of the dps chart?! What a pleasant surprise.
---
I agree with some of that. Getting rid of the addon so nobody can use it is fine with me. 
---
Could’ve done without the ‘git gud’ but whatever man.
---
Didn't know it before, but I red somewhere that it shares your info with other people using that addon. Well I don't like to be spied without my EXPLICIT consent.
---
Thunder Bluff guy is no joke. Nice job
---
I think the question stands though. If you start late how far will you kick it?
---
Soon they will have Agi enchant

[Jame's Alliance Leveling Guide - Chapter I (30-41) [old version]](http://www.wow-pro.com/leveling_guides/jame039s_alliance_leveling_guide_chapter_i_3041_old_version)
---
No lies y’all! The pictures are inside jokes we have. I’ve known these cats since middle school.
---
Ty
---
Max rank is a few month no life commitment, literally.
---
Do i personally need a scepter in order to take part in a Mara princess run? or can i just use a portal that is opened by somebody else in my group?
---
You won't be getting max rank unless you can devote 50-80 hours a week to WoW.
---
In which case you have more than enough time to research this topic and develop your own strategies.
---
Good one. You seem real smart.
---
It's a West coast NA server. I get 60-80 depending on the zone. On East Coast, I tend to get 20 or so. Not that bad imo!
---
&gt; And the corpse runs are still worth is comparable to how much flavour it adds to the game!
---
lol I was actually thinking about how even the music/sound during a corpse run triggers my nostalgia - like I can visualize my lvl 16 dwarf ghost running through ashenvale lost af while trying to figure out where the world pvp raid I was looking for was XD
---
You shouldn't be celebrating your faction imbalance.  You are going to miss out on all of Phase2 because of it.
---
You can do the beginning of Uldaman, but you won't be dealing any damage towards the end. I'd suggest SM Cath and Razorfen Downs
---
Yes, that's exactly how they gain loyalty :) through happiness via food and from being out and about with you
---
Why would you use claw with edgemaster's?
---
Youre close! Looks like people have addons that help aggregate the populations. [check this out](https://www.wowhead.com/news=295075/classic-wow-realm-population-report-data-aggregated-through-community). You are I are in the same boat pretty much as I am on Pagle (US)
---
Gehennas is the worst server in the World. Have fun in Phase 2 on this shitshow server Lmao
---
&gt;I would certainly demote them down to trial raider and make them re-prove their loyalty and devotion towards the cause.
---
It's an internet elf game, not a revolution. &gt;_&gt;
---
Like rank 10
---
The curse debuff is what I'm talking about, like curse of elements of shadow. They reduce spell resistance to their school by 70\~, which makes an incredible difference for partial resists and things like that.
---
The 10% damage bonus side of the debuff is nice too.
---
Lol I bet it’s a bunch of leather and mail.
---
the high IQ move is to stockpile black lotuses and flasks until you actually need them.  or yeh ur gonna be paying ridiculous amounts of gold for them later
---
Horde players who have earned bad reputations will transfer.
---
Wait, why are you twinking a class that is not level X9?
---
Furthermore, when you begin healing all you need is intelligence until +healing gear drops so really it's not a big deal. You can scrub together a full eagle / int set from the AH for like 50G max
---
So i'm horde on Kromcrush, should i go Heart seeker or Arcanite reaper??
---
Awesome. Thanks for the info.
---
Imagine being rude and offensive towards someone being grown up, having real-file responsibilities due to them playing a 15-years old video game at their own pace and commitment and not spending every minute of their life on the same video-game
---
Considering you made it personal twice before i did i fully support your statement.
---
assuming the game keeps running, it does not matter at all when you start, as long as you play continuously ONCE you start.   on private servers people got rank 14 that started a year or more late.  
---
However there is a factor, the more people are ranking, the easier it is to get into a high percentile , so if you expect the amount of active pvpers to drop, it;s better to start early
---
Operation no leader.
---
Yeah sounds pretty shitty but the fact you let them know ahead of time and they still booted you makes them the shitters. Do your stuff and find another one man, np.
---
Yeah the second charge was probably Intercept

---
You do realize that the damage would spiral completely out of control without this measure?
---
I was curious about not giving honor points when dying. Not a fair way, I understand
---
I've met people through grouping for quests or dungeons mostly. If chat is active while doing it, the experiences are memorable. Look for a social leveling alliance maybe...
---
One thing I do on my priest is when I see a horde corpse I /who him to check if the player is logged in. If so, ressurect.
---
Some people remember that and are more inclined to invite or help you in the future. It's in the small things. As a mage you could hand out free water some time
---
Mostly addon settings. Would get rid of most if i knew how to
---
I recommend you spec holy once you reach 50ish, nothing before that.
---
What servers were balanced and then had a faction specific mass Exodus? Do you have any numbers to support that? Because I doubt it happened. 
---
Both factions needing to corpse run to BRM on peak hours does not mean a server is balanced. I'm on one of the worst balanced realms in the minority faction but we still control BRM when we coordinate a group. That doesn't mean we aren't massively outnumbered on average.
---
Noob here. I got the first mate’s hat (pirate hat) for 10g at the AH. I really wanna wear it but I’ve been told I should hold on to it and sell it later for way more. Is that true? How long should I wait and how much could I get?
---
I’m a warlock so it’s not like I need the gold for a mount...but idk.
---
I grinded out a level killing mobs in Badlands and just looting everything. I was a skinner tho so got extra gold income via that.
---
What you can do is check the price of cloth/mats on AH and see if making something out of them makes a profit by selling to a vendor. So I think if you can buy silk cloth for less than 2 silver each, you can make them into bandages and make a profit.
---
Is there any site/source for datamined NPC stats? I ask because I was looking for how much spell penetration it takes for mobs in NPC to have their fire resist negated, but I can't find mob information anywhere.
---
&gt; "It's stupid in the same way it was vanilla, so it's fine"
---
Not what I said, ment to say or even implied. I am only saying that it is working as intended.
---
&gt; there shouldnt even be a debuff limit imo 
---
Why not? Imposing a limit adds a requirement for more communication and teamwork. Classic raids are already extremely easy as it is. No need to make it easier.
---
Lol "sweaty" is a nice way to describe it.
---
In my mind a more realistic fighter would be one wearing a backpack with a bunch of their gear, or having their equipment in easy reach all over them. Then you get a mount and carry your items in it saddle bags and such.
---
Yep.
---
The price of lotus has literally nothing to do with demand of flasks and everything to do with price speculation.
---
You can wait. But I would recommend doing casual pvp at first, like 10-15 hours maybe a week if you got time. This goes a VERY long way at the first couple of ranks, and then just gradually increase your played time for the higher ranks
---
They don't obstruct any view yet, but yeah i also rather get rid of them
---
3rd running of Rend, we had the MH and OH drop.  Warrior won the OH, lost the MH by 3 points.  I won the MH.  37 Runs, 3 more MH drops, 5 OH drops and I have my full set.  Didn't see an OH drop from run 25-37.
---
Run 25 had the OH drop.  Had a Fury Warrior in the group beat me for the roll.  He gets the item then says "Oh, I thought this was the MH, I don't even need this."
---
Can a macro register an eventhandler for something like RegisterEvent("COMBAT_LOG_EVENT_UNFILTERED")?
---
A macro cannot continue to work in the background like that, can it?
---
&gt; ~~Low~~No flask users: Hunters
---
Fixed.  There's zero reason for a Hunter to use a flask.  If 1200 more health on a Hunter is the difference between success and failure, you've got bigger problems in your raid than whether someone has flasked or not!
---
Focus on 41.
---
I call Friday
---
You need very little pre-BIS gear for Mara. I just started farming this weekend and while I personally have almost full pre BIS, it’s pretty chill. You should be prioritizing pre-BIS at 60 anyway before just gold farming!
---
Buy a really dope weapon that you cant use yet.
---
It is funny because you are actually absurdly wrong.
---
Can you explain exactly what fights you needed flasks for and why?
---
The only people who you could possibly make an argument for is tanks.
---
Keep in mind, it does have a 54% drop chance, so there still is the chance that, if you find the rare spawn, he won't actually drop it.
---
That would suck.
---
Ripoff? Lmao.
---
Nothing taken from WC3 is inherently unique to Blizz products. It's stuff they ripped off from others
---
Warrior
---
the faction ratio, is probably the most balanced in all of classic.
---
what causes your correct observation, seems to be that almost all of the large pre-established PvP guilds that existed before grobbulus launched, went the same faction (alliance). this leaves a server with a balanced population but alliance dominant city raiding. 
---
meanwhile, the horde community is still finding its footing. loosely compared, it seems to be like a premade vs. a pug.
---
you may notice i said 'seemed' a lot. this is cuz I don't play on grobbulus. but i have been following it closely. and i will roll on there next. i will roll horde. i think that's an interesting rp narrative right there, underdog faction that has the numbers to fight back but just needs to unite? sign me up.
---
The buttons use SecureActionButtonTemplate, which has restrictions on what can happen to them in combat.  For example, you can't move them in script, show/hide them, resize them, or change what spell the button is assigned to.  It has to wait until you are out of combat to actually change the assigned spell.
---
not classic related...
---
You don't pvp much. That's not how it works for pvp. It's not the same as pve.
---
I got 3 of them while lvling from aroound 25-30 with some breaks for questing. They all just sit in my bank.
---
rich thorium vein was always mineable more than 2 times on vanilla, now it's 2-5 times even tho layering is gone. It should be 4-6 times

---
These are all the possible consumes you can get as well as what does and does not stack. 
---
The **Consumable Buffs** list will have most of the standard consumes you will bring with Elixirs being the most basic. Id say bring the 3 major elixirs + gift of arthas and then whatever else feels feasable on your end to farm up. 
---
Also just bring free action potions. Way to many tanks skip out on these and theres a ton of spots in MC they are useful (Gehennas, Molten Destroyers, Lava packs)
---
Lol, outside of Rise and Reign, I’ve never heard of any of those guilds and I can’t find any of them except for Pretty Good on legacy players. And Pretty Good is listed for 3 MC raids and 1 BWL, all in like August, so perhaps it was them testing or preparing. 
---
I’d love to be proven wrong, honestly. Someone please link me something that says these guilds are not miserable liars so I can feel better about the world.
---
The best way to make gold at that level is mob grinding.   When you quest don't take the road to avoid mobs while getting to your quest.  Kill everything on your way.   The downside to this is bag space, especially as a hunter.  Id also recommended making a bank toon, leveling it to lvl 5, and grab enchanting.   There's no skill needed to disenchant items.   Send all boes to your bank  and DE them and sell mats. Enchanting items don't require a deposit to post in the AH
---
As far as i understand hi missed raid during his planned renovation that was also gutted . Even if he missed a raid after his 3 week permission, kicking him is dick move unless you play super hardcore guild that wants to be first world for everything and even in that case at the moment there is so few content.
---
Yeah, we don't really have rules at the moment, I didn't think we'd need them. I assumed people would know what to roll for and that they wouldn't be so greedy as to roll on stuff their class shouldn't roll over others...
---
As I said, it was our first run, so we're all learning, not only how we want to run the guild and raids, but also, what kind of people we're playing with, so it's all good.
---
Yeah was just gonna say, make a a goal to upgrade every piece of gear
---
I tried soloing it lol it didn’t go well. I joined a group that were doing a full run and completed it with them cause I felt bad bailing.
---
Nah. Basically youre trading the comfort of having a high pop ah and easy to find high level groups/raids for more wpvp, which sounds cool except that wpvp isnt balanced and the whole meme of "youll have all these people to kill!" isnt really telling you the whole story because if youre outnumbered 4 to 1, it doesnt matter how good you are or even if youre geared and they arent.
---
I played on Gorefiend Alliance, we were outnumbered, but it was nowhere near as bad as what I experienced on Skeram.
---
Yeah, things slow down after 40, I hit a wall too. What I did was focus on getting to level 55, then started to farm my pre raid bis gear. The last 5 levels kinda got themselves done.
---
I'd rather they not.
---
Alternatively,  I've leveled my warrior in classic with a rogue friend and we burn through quest mobs and content.   VERY little downtime as the rogue can melt mobs while I tank them.   Having a healer join us is the icing on the cake for clearing content quickly.
---
Arcane bombs? Thats not why people think enginnering is amazing.
---
I suppose having less people use Eng would be better for us pvpers. 
---
So, yea! It sucks.
---
I'd go Quel'serar for now, just make sure you have good %hit from your gear and you should be fine. I've had no problems holding threat with Quel. I believe Ekshandar's will be more threat generation, but if you've already got Quel then you might as well use it. Plus it looks better. 
---
Some very important upgrades for you will be Onyxia Tooth Pendant and Band of Acuria for the %hit on them. Those 2 + Voone's Vice grips should get you to 9% if you're running at least pre-raid BiS in your other slots (Tarnished Elven Ring, Satyr's Bow, Brigam's Girdle puts you at 8%, with Wristguards of True Flight from Majordomo you're at 9%). If you're not at 9% right now, that's perfectly fine - I'm personally only at 7% myself as a dwarf and I have no problems. 9% is obviously the goal, but the world won't end if you can't quite make it there immediately.
---
Time is money, friend.
---
No, it’s not to far.  You forget the most important thing about WoW Classic.  The sense that this a real world.  
---
This is medieval, it’s dark and gloomy and death hangs near in some places, while bright and full of hope in others.
---
If you think this is bad, check out Tirisfal Glade, or BRDs.  You are suppose to feel uncomfortable in these places, and recognize it as evil.  It generally turns into a desire to make it right. Or for the forsaken, a reminder of what they’ve overcome
---
how so?
---
is 6 stam and 20ap worth more than 0.75% crit?
---
No one is answering you so I will: you can start ranking at any time and take it as slow as you want. However, you need to understand that there is honor decay that increases as you rank up and, at a certain point, it will require that you pretty much play 12 hours a day (or more) everyday to continue ranking up. This starts around rank 11 typically but depending on the number of other people also climbing ranks on your server, could start sooner.
---
That my dear friend is half false. Once you get the blue pvp gear, considering op said rank 10 is his go to rank, you can stop, i dont quite remember but i think that once you obtain the gear you can always wear it, no matter the rank
---
Talking to the dude who said they were 30g not you
---
There isn't a numbers imbalance on Grob, just a motivation imbalance. This was a surprise attack that the leaders of all the major guilds planned in advance. If the Horde want to stand around and pout instead of mounting a defense so be it.
---
Both are good, but to add on to their argument.  That extra healing could help them down rank their heals further which stretches out their mana pool which is what you're trying to do with int/spirit.
---
please make a youtube channel and post those.
---
Those were his adds that exploded on you when you killed him in Wrath. I farmed MC in retail for the bindings, Garr never dropped them until Legion.
---
Just stick to draintanking. Dot up with only the dots that are going to expire just as the mob dies, anything more is wasted mana. Focus on one mob at a time, as it's life is getting low start moving to your next target and begin to dot and drainlife as the other target dies. Always keep an eye on your life, mana, and your pets mana. Lifetap and Dark Pact off the Succubus to keep yourself topped off and the sustain is nearly endless. Once your health and mana is low and nothing left to tap off your pet stop to bandage/eat/drink then get at it again. Don't even use fear while draintanking until you pull 3+ and begin to get overwhelmed. Heathstone stone always being up gives you a good oh shit way out I'm these situations.
---
40 runs to get Dalrends for me, i feel ya
---
my guild have atleast 80runs, still only one MH dropped
---
Look at Dungeons with good gear you you can improve your character. Make an alt for class variation
---
Let's be honest. He probably wasn't that good or for whatever other reason they didn't want him in the guild even before this. This was just the reason to do it. Bad leaders who can't confront people... name a more classic character trait amongst wow guild leaders/officers.
---
You have to do the whole questline for the Seal of Ascension. Which is the key to UBRS. Sure, you don't have to do it if you don't want the key.
---
I can't imagine a sever with lotus thay cheap has many guids that will bother flasking
---
ZT is 47% horde, don't ruin it.
---
Like 10 people dead before that bomb even hits, yet let's focus on the mage standing in the wrong spot. The wipe is definitely not because of the MS warrior.

Both unbuffed  ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
I played from Vanilla to WotLK, my main was a Mage and main alt was a Hunter so I was always DPS. With Classic I decided to completely change it up and go as a Warrior (Tank). I am only lvl 32 because of adulting but I am really enjoying the change in strategy and being in the fight in dungeons, but boy is solo questing tough most of the time!
---
I mean if reduced threat is that big then why not use tranquil air?
---
There is no easy solution, just grind away. All parts of a journey usually isn't enjoyable but you need to persevere. I find that the levels 41-47 are the toughest to grind through after that you can see the light in the tunnels end and a lot of fun stuff starts opening up.
---
Get 43 and you can spam ZF for levels, dungeon grinding is slower but for some playing in a group setting helps them with leveling fatigue.
---
&gt;You're probably something like 55/45 which is considered relatively ideal.
---
Nooo, no no not at all. We're about 75/25 if not worse than that.
---
And let me rephrase that; it is not unplayable but yes it is a problem. I can rely on my guild to form groups etc but I can definitely see people struggling out there. We are low pop on Horde Hydraxian, compared to the Alliance medium pop.
---
I remember coming off the deeprun tram and some mofo mindcontrolled me then put me back on it.
---
I agree it shouldn't be 50/50.  I think +/-10% either way is fine.
---
I generally disagree with the turn of event, more specifically with people arguing, during the raid and after the rolls, on who should be allowed to roll on what, unless it's an obvious BiS.
---
We're not a Loot Council guild and don't want to be one. ie.: the Melee DPS bow (Striker's Mark) also dropped. It's clearly not a Hunter bow, but people kept repeating it's BiS for Rogues (which it is), so a Warrior (who it's also BiS for) didn't roll on it, because he didn't want people to yell at him on Discord.
---
I don't disagree that the Ring of Spell Power benefits Casters more than Healers, that said, our guild's main focus is PvP, so PvE BiS lists are somewhat irrelevant. I'm not going to PvP in +Healing gear alone, just like Warriors aren't going to PvP in full Leather suits...

I just heard the first chord of the elwynn forest music as soon as I looked at it. I'll never forget my first Warlock ever. 2007, Zangarmarsh server, named Kreonn. Rolling a lock now in classic by the same name :) I love classic and I love this community
---
&gt;On release and especially for pvp servers, alliance would start out outnumbered and get dominated in contested leveling zones just due to their slightly smaller population. The difficult leveling due to ganking would cause players to drop off, creating a snowball effect which continually got worse.
---
I don't understand this though. Are they that fragile? I played on Illidan against DiE from day 1 of Vanilla. Were they fucking ruthless? Yes. Did they gank the shit out of people? Absolutely. Were we outnumbered? You bet. This made the game FUN, not unplayble. I think people are just more fragile these days because they aren't used to games that don't coddle them. They run into unexpected challenges and give up instead of fighting through.
---
I stayed shadow through 60, so the usual questing with 1 or 2 runs in each dungeon. Then farmed my tail off to get epic riding and truefaith crafted. At that point I went holy and worked on preraid bis. 
---
My gold making stopped instantly when swapping to holy. Obviously make a little here or there, but just enough to break even. I recommend staying shadow for a while unless you have to switch for raid. My gold situation sucks so much I am leveling a warlock as my farmer. Its 55, so getting there, but worry what the removal of layers will do to my plans for him.
---
It is working ffs. Everybody is telling you that fd/trap work and that's true.
---
Just explain me how I manage to fd/trap as will against players. It can't just be you. 
---
When this sequence doesn't work, this is due to spell batching, as almost everybody told you. And this is a mechanic which is part of the game.
---
I'm pretty sure you're fding while opp is landing a hit on you, or you're simply doing it while doted.
---
Faction imbalance isn't always about numbers.  Trust me when I tell you I have seen this before and the outcome is always the same.
---
That would possibly be one of the worst things to happen to classic and would guarantee a mass exodus.
---
&gt;rdition's blade and corehound tooth. One of the best daggers in the game until mid AQ40. You might even outgear him. Ret paladins are extremely gear reliant and don't actually start critting super hard until you clear bwl.
---
Yeah, my paladin wearing "Zero mana gear" -- is basically all blues, and has 30% crit with Mongoose.  
---
I am not my guild's official ret paladin, I just have 3 BIS pieces.  
---
Ret DPS is all about keeping consecrate up. (I.E. lightforge for spellpower proc and mana)... but it is -not- good PvP gear, and you basically want to wear all warrior gear for ret PvP. It isn't that his skill is bad... it's that his itemization is bad. You can have the best reaction time in the world (not saying he does) but there's nothing to react to if you don't crit. All you'll do is beat resto shamans in the mana war. =/
---
Yeah, the +1 usually resets for Rag so people don't just drop once they get something.
---
sooo... no evidence?
---
&gt;  I guess it's possible they are trying to reduce the overall Pop. of high Pop. servers.
---
Exactly this. These servers have too many people on them and queues are going to get bad when layers are removed today.
---
Honor is fixed.  The ranking is proportional.  I believe only 0.1% of the population can hold Rank 14 at any time.  So for a faction size of 10,000 you will have 10 players.  Now, this is determined by the number of active pvpers.  If you have 1000 players fighting on a 10k server, only 1 will make R14.
---
Each week there is a reset and you get your new rank.  The honor gains are compared against everyone on your faction for the past week then people are assigned into various brackets to receive Rank Points.
---
So while having more players sounds nice, meaning you'll have a higher amount of people in each bracket, it also means your competition is that much more intense, especially if the other faction is a minority or hiding.
---
What happened to the ClassicCodex addon? It used to be here, but now I get a 404: https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/classiccodex
---
Just find a new guild wtf dude
---
Sick math
---
This is great. I love the style.
---
Bu-bu-but my streams!
---
It's popular from Fortnite streamers calling try-hard players "sweaty players" or just "sweats" for short.
---
It's a great comparison.
---
&gt;Would just offer you a transfer to a server where horde ~~need helps~~ is massively outnumbered
---
There is literally zero reason to ever take a server transfer to a lopsided faction. It is a lose - lose. You would just be torpedoing any chance of you having a good gaming experience.
---
You know your not allowed to post this stuff on this reddit right ?
---
I used to go to northshire on my troll rogue, take off all my gear, and walk around like an npc near the kobolds with my pvp flag on. New players would think I was some sort of special boss and attack me, I would turn and just right click them and just keep pacing. Sometimes they would get their friends and try to band together to kill me, only to be slaughtered. Good times.
---
Its percentage based so this is wrong.
---
They said week of Nov 12th and then later announced pvp system going live thursday.
---
&gt; Faction imbalance isn't always about numbers. Trust me when I tell you I have seen this before and the outcome is always the same.
---
2h windfury and profit
---
Zeps are between Org, UC, and Grom'gol in Classic.
---
Felcloth pieces for PVE. Especially gloves.
---
You can't get dungeon coords in classic
---
Mained dwarf priest in vanilla, with dwarf rogue and hunter as alts. I did get a tauren shaman to 30+ in vanilla.  
---
In classic my main is tauren druid.
---
It says right in the comments it doesn't work. But the person links the proper add-on. Thanks!
---
Just don't level up to 49, right now you are an honorless target for lvl 60s. xd
---
if only it WAS in the MIDDLE of nowhere... maybe it had some use...  unfortunately it is FAR NORTH of nowhere...
---
If you haven't completed show me your work, you can't be gnomish yet??
---
Thank you for the info! Now the last thing I would be curious about is what makes someone an "active pvper"? Just killing a single player each week?
---
It’s not, people will say it is because that is what they did.  They want to believe that it is useful as a result.  For certain classes it is very valuable though do you want to break stealth to throw a bomb?  Is rocket helmet stun which breaks on damage better than using any opener a rogue has?  Situationally it might be though in more than 9/10 situations it isn’t.
---
Healing and tank classes I think it is helpful.  If you are a mage you have bombs built in, they are called spells.
---
You won't be a good healer without illumination. Period. You need that as a paladin if you want to heal.
---
Imp devo aura is not worth the 5 points. You also are not taking Precision in the prot tree. Why?
---
You also take SoC for some reason. As others have pointed out, it's not great without more talents in ret.
---
I guess my question is, what do you plan on doing with this build?
---
So I dont know what you are on about with your last point. But let me show you an example:
---
Now people will only buy the second cheapest item. Runecloth is 1.30g on the auctiob house. People buy for 1.31g. This is fine and dandy, but now the 1.30 auction runs out. Thus 1.31g is the cheapest option. 
---
Because 1.31 is now the cheapest, people will buy for 1.32g and nobody sets it in for 1.31g anymore.  This will be an endless spirale of runecloth gradually becoming more expensive. What happens next is one of two possibilities.
---
1. 3 months later Runecloth is 3.5g per stack and nobody buys it anymore. People who have no need for their runecloth vendor it, because nobody buys runecloth because it is too expensive.
---
2. Someone just puts in a single piece of runecloth for 1 copper. Now the price can become cheaper again because the cheapest option is 1 copper.
---
&gt; enchanters charge 20g for a button click
---
I thought this attitude died a decade ago. This is like bitching about paying a professional photographer because all they do is press a button. You're paying for the training and equipment, or in the case of WoW, the time spent leveling the profession and the finding rare patterns. 
---
Also, there's nothing that is stopping tanks from being enchanters, herbalists or alchemists.
---
Yeah as I said some about half done and just respond to your comment as to why I would hold farm instead of going for pre-bis. I have the robe of the void and all gel cloth stuff already crafted. 
---
Thanks for the reply. Now to find a group to get the Mara scepter I guess. Thanks for the reply.
---
God damn Rudy, and Shkreli and their reserve list buyouts.
---
Seriously. Fuck obnoxious ten year olds.
---
I just pop my fear immunty trinket and warlocks becomes target dummies heh
---
Anyone care to explain what this is actually about? If I had to take a guess sounds like blizz is trying to block whichever faction is underpopulated to avoid a faction on a server just being completely dead, but feel free to correct me.
---
OK BOOMER
---
Except anyone over 14yo should know that, is not only the very most basics of economy but it's also really logical. Answering if the new recipes are going to be worth it for the playerbase is harder to do and it was what he was looking for an answer. Not everybody knows what craft items are actually worth it for most classes and to what extent. If you don't know these things either then just don't reply.
---
as a child who never got to even reach 60 when vanilla was out, getting in MC for my first time on classic had my hands sweating
---
Claw does not benefit from edgemasters.
---
omw to the store to buy a monster
---
Has there been any confirmation of keyring coming out with honor or is that still just speculation?
---
I would blink out of the first charge stun, and try and kite him until his FAP is done, then reapply your frost CC. Also don't be afraid to use cold snap to reset your frost cooldowns to keep him pinned
---
You can also just get a healer and 2man the 3 bosses! I got luck with a group needing a 5th lol.
---
transfer to win anything? I'm on the same outnumbered server I've always been and always will be. you just say stupid shit that makes no sense. you are an actual idiot and you would do well to realize this and gain some self awareness. your life will be better
---
It is not worth it to me to download a different addon just for that. If that is the only distinguishing feature, I wont need it.
---
You never noticed missing your attacks or your spells being fully resisted in pvp?
---
You assume that everyone takes the same perspective on the game. Some, in fact a lot of people give very few shits about clearing MC etc as quickly as humanly possible.
---
Some people like to ay the game because its fun. Wven if the mechanics are simple it still takes time and repetition to memorize the rotations, learn the cycles of boss mechanics etc.
---
You only get that with seat time. Clearing MC fast relies on all of those prerequisites, some pwople just dont want or cant devote that much cumulative time. Doesnt make them bad just not at the same pace as you.
---
You need to calm your tits. Master arbiter of how people can and should spend their time.
---
Linken's Boomerang is trash tier, its extremly low chance on lvl 60 targets. Try it out yourself.
---
They can’t be that good of friends if they’re willing to abandon 2 of their buddies because they aren’t neets that were able to be home at 2pm on the dot on a workday, either.
---
Lol jeez calm down man. If they know that and are too lazy to look it up then why should I?
---
Agreed
---
Why? I understand having the classic experience but i feel like that kinda shit is the QOL type of stuff games grow from. Idk, to each their own i guess
---
I see. Weird that blizzard would offer such a transfer though, why not offer xfer to a more balanced server.
---
I'm so happy I didn't roll on a trash streamer server.
---
He dueled one of my hunter guildies and told him that it's impossible to win if he gives it 100%. Was super cocky. He then proceeds to lose 3 times in a row to a hunter with blue weapons. Big yikes.
---
You can start any time, people only hold max rank for a week at a time (because then they stop and decay back down).
---
You rank up by being in the top x% of your faction, so anyone starting at any time can rank up as long as they're consistently doing enough PvP to earn ranks up.
---
got eem
---
I’m aware of how viable shadow is and actually mandatory to bring to raid for shadow vuln but that’s it. Thinking that you can guarantee yourself a rebuff slot is a stretch and will be near impossible come BWL, for sure in AQ
---
so?
---
Then it’s not classic.  Just leave it the way it easy and if you get tired of it go to retail
---
As far as I know all aoe is done with debuffs under the hood
---
I see you with that ¡
---
Do you have a link to an article?
---
A lot of people would rather they not.
---
I'm just cynical.
---
I understand the math, but it's not an unworkable number IMO and would still be tight enough of a restriction to be painful.   The idea is for it to be just painful enough that people are ultimately incentivized to switch while still having as little impact as we can get away with.
---
I'm sorry what?  I spend.. a repair bills worth lol.
---
If he organizes and leads groups, he doesn't have to be good. That's like 70% of the effort.
---
Whatever you do, make sure youre having fun. It sounds dumb but a ton of people play a class, get to 30 and realize they dont like it, thats when you have to just stop and play a new one. Dont commit to the class because "well ive spent so much time with it already" better to do it at 30 than rerolling at 60.  
---
Again, focus on having fun. If you arent having fun, fix it.
---
Yeah, I MTed in Vanilla and people always just gave me flasks and potions and all sorts of free shit. You really don't need that many tank flasks.
---
Supreme Power and Distilled Wisdom are the killers.
---
Not true at all. Felwood on Skeram can be a warzone, I've been ganked there more often than STVietnam.
---
Does anyone have a theory on AH price fluctuations related to time of the day/ day of the week?
---
Example: I just started selling my precious hand picked herbs to afford a level 40 mount. I put them on AH yesterday (monday) early noon and prices were really good. Sold a good bunch of em, but still have a load left. When i checked the prices today (tuesday morning) they have nearly halved compared to yesterday for almost all the herbs ive been selling. For now i'm going to wait till the prices increase again.  
---
So I wonder if the price decrease is just random, or if there is a kind of rule of thumb price fluctuation on the AH. Would be nice to know for further business :)
---
Yes that may be true. I just looked at what classes profit most and least from flasks.
---
They said it would come with the first content patch, which is assumed to be P2 (since dire maul early release wasn't planned originally).
---
I think OP is asking whether they can get the highest rank they can achieve for their skill level and time available if they start PvP'ing a month into phase 2, not whether they can get R14.
---
Full time job and you manage to pull stuff like this off. Man I look up to you! Happy gaming
---
well at least with the lag you have a whole 20 secs to take a screen grab before anything updates.
---
this is great to know. I'd like to get it early enough....although 38-39 is a little low haha!  
---
I have a large guild, so will be no probs getting the 1st mob killed. 
---
thanks for the reply though, good to know I should be able to get it done early, for when I go to start running ZF!
---
Weekly, 20%.
---
ive gone cross-eyed trying to read the AH with Elvui
---
Lol that was my thought about Alliance. I've almost never been ganked or attempted by an equal level Alli. They're always several levels above
---
Had that happen - were waiting for the chicken in Tanaris to spawn with a grp. If you haven't done those quests - it's an escort quest with a looong respawn timer if someone completes it, but a much shorter one if you wipe. A Tauren war runs in, ignores our emotes, grabs it before everyone in the group hands in the quest and runs away. He wipes (it's a really hard quest to solo at the prescribed level, let alone for a warrior), the chicken respawns and he comes in with a buddy. We stack everyone and pets onto the chicken, bait PvP flags and kill his buddy. The warrior wipes again. The chicken respawns, this time warrior has more friends who try to bait PvP flags on us. Joke's on them, they get murdered, we hand in our quests and begin the escort in peace.
---
I then run into them +2 lvl 60s trying to intercept, but by that time the escort was done and the PvP flags were off.
---
Tldr: An opposing faction war tried to fuck with our chicken. Wiped twice, got killed once and had to wait ~15 mins for it to respawn. Shouldn't have fucked with our chicken.
---
I started on grob last week, abandoning my horde priest. It is fantastic.
---
Get fucked. Your shitty little ass tried to transfer but Blizz said “nahhh.” Enjoy your server little dip
---
Oh god gag me with a spoon.
---
Yes.i belive u can add that.smart ideea!
---
Ion said that the keyring will come out with the first content patch.  Since DM was a surprise, and technically a content patch, many of us suspected the keyring would be included with DM.  As far as confirmation goes, I don't think we have any... lets just hope the implementation of the honor system counts as a content patch.
---
alright let's take it back to 8 debuff slots then, is that enough communication and teamwork for ya?
---
why not 4? 2? 1?
---
&gt; amazing faction balance
---
&gt; has been medium pop for awhile 
---
Doesn't sound like a very big problem, tbh.
---
for me personally it was [this \(deep dive with skarm\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faV-uY7ZYrE&amp;t=3096s) for tanks
---
Wait. Why specifically Taurens?
---
That feel is alive on grob for sure!
---
If you’re talking about PvE the elvish ring is definitely better.
---
I would say anything around 100g per item is worth it.  Especially if it is an item that you can equip early on like devilsaur.  It’s going to make the final grind easier.
---
TB boss is cake but could be harder to get to if its defended. UC seems easy enough to get to but varamithras tricks people with his aoe. And when you're lagging balls it's very difficult to heal. Especial when the one pvp vendor guy fears everyone out of line of sight.
---
20ish is right on, its a decent debuff with 4-5 (or more) hunters, not worth a slot with less
---
It's a game. Just wear it if you like it
---
Hydraxian waterlords was left our on transfers aswell. But our balance is also not so great.
---
Arcane blast? You’re still on retail servers my dude
---
Didn't say it was a good one you said there were none.
---
enhancement is a noob bait.
---
Elemental shaman does the same oneshots but with no RNG involved, go big elemental shaman it's like a super bursty heal tank at the same time.
---
What are you talking about? Maybe you misunderstood what I said.
---
They should have offered faction specific free character transfers in early September when they started free transfers. These transfers should have been offered only to the dominate faction. This would alleviate the imbalance of the imbalance, crowded servers from launch.
---
That does not limit the ability of anyone trying to create new characters on whichever realm they want to today, or ever.
---
nice, so there's no lack of alliance there, so i can safely make my horde alt there with good faction balance?
---
Ohh our guild will most certainly provide flasks for tanks on hard encounters. 
---
We are a fairness based guild. The only time we would not provide flasks is when everyone needs flasks. 
---
Or when we maybe make a system where people either have to use a flask for bonus DKP or classes that dont need a flask, get to donate one for bonus dko
---
I have no solid data on this but anecdotally, and in  line with expectations, I’ve found that off peak times have higher prices but lower liquidity and vice versa in peak times
---
Doesn't appear to be in the game yet after server restarts.
---
It's worth pointing out that the AMA said launch servers in vanilla had 3000 concurrent login caps but it was implied those numbers were higher (probably not much maybe 5k?) by the end of vanilla.
---
This dude is a self proclaimed "best paladin on Whitemane" and is an incredibly toxic and childish cunt. I'm really happy this dudes true colors are recorded.
---
Dead server with no Horde. Nice.
---
Can you add boss names or smth:)?
---
The demons do a little smack talk before they despawn but feels like it's only a second or 2. I had like 4 or 5 people reset it on me.
---
No what would be awesome is if Blizzard just got it right the first time.  They should never have been in this position.  What a load of sht.
---
Will melee dps (rogues) need any elemental resist for later phases?
---
Also going to do ony and mc for the first time ever, what pots and stuff will I need?
---
Wait what are you searching for? What did this guy find? I can’t make it out in the gif.
---
I just rerolled an alliance hunter and haven't really ever played alliance before. Does anyone have any good grind spots for 25-40 for making money? I don't mind killing mobs over and over but just trying to find a good spot to make some money. Or really any other money making tips for rerolling alliance. 
---
I had an UD rogue (herb/alch) that i was able to get a mount fairly easily by farming shellfish but you can't do that on alliance unfortunately. My hunter also costs a fair bit more with food for pets, ammo, etc. Also going skinning/lw doesn't really help as i don't think there's much to make money outside of just selling skins. Any help would be appreciated.
---
dude, no one here is calling themselves elite. you're just way below average.
---
especially considering it didn't happen. not very nice to the brave germans who lost their lives in ww2 to spread lies about them.
---
1h/shield &gt; 2h for paladins. Righteous Fury is the buff the other poster is talking about, and it increases threat caused by holy spells. As a paladin tanking, you'll want to go into the holy tree to grab Consecration first, which you can nab at level 20. After that, hit up the prot tree. Your playstyle will largely be pulling multiple mobs at once and using Consecration (and maybe ret aura) to help you hold threat. The 1h/shield will help mitigate that damage a lot better.
---
As someone on Faerlina: please god no. 
---
Make better choices or reroll. Don't ruin the one good server because you're lazy
---
It depends when the procs were normalized, I guess. I could definitely be mis-remembering, but my understanding was that super slow weapons actually proc'd a higher percentage of the time, due to lockouts or something along those lines.
---
It's been over 10 years since I looked at the math though, so you could absolutely be right.
---
You might be thinking of improved shadow bolt which increases all shadow damage. The corruption talent just makes it instant cast.
---
My best guess would be that since Mind Vision applies a 'buff' to the target, the game assumed that you contributed.
---
Talking of annoying, is the train set in game yet?
---
Dont remind me =(
---
Not many, I'd be willing to bet.
---
Blizzard limiting transfers to one faction isn't going to do much in the long run except piss off Alliance players.
---
Horde players have no incentive to transfer.  They've established their guilds, friends list, and inner circle now. No reason for them to give it up and move.
---
The problem will be made worse by Alliance players quitting or rerolling to get away from it all.
---
Same, but no warrior would ever get a 2nd, especially when flurry axe exists, and there are other warriors who would use it for MH.
---
back in vanilla ever non warrior (myself included) who hit rank 14 would buy the rank 14 2 handed sword to just put in trade with warriors and palys
---
Interesting, to me it seems off times are always cheaper. For essences/enchanting Mats/arcane crystals/pots the prices always seem lower in the morning and the highest at peak hours. I always make auctions in the evening and bid/buy stuff in the mornings.
---
More people are active and buy stuff on evenings so prices are higher, and they are cheaper in the morning because people undercut the priče while there is less demand.
---
Nature resistance for some fights in AQ
---
BSH/BSH is a really good preraid setup if you can't afford BoEs.  Anni/BSH is good, too, especially if your guild will help fund it.
---
This was the case, my friends and I rolled Horde for vanilla because they were underdogs and that's kind of our style.
---
I got freaked by the mail, thinking someone did a COD and want to scam me lolz.....
---
Stop clickbait: 172 gold in 10 hours
---
But playing as a supporting role heal&gt;ele&gt;enhancer.
---
Why do you care so much? I've found quite a few good channels this way.
---
Hold up - Keyring wasnt released today?
---
I agree with that move completely. I know their primary concern is the removal of layers as well. If  blizz intentionally omitted my server from the list based on their data that's fine. I just personally think there is no reason to not have our server available as well to help spread the population out. We are one of 3 servers on US east on medium, and those other medium pop realms have been opened up. Just seems like they may have overlooked us by accident.
---
Also to note, windfury doesn't affect feral druids. But paladin blessings obviously do. It's kind of unfortunate, but really throws a stick in what you would expect / want for a melee dps group on Horde.
---
Let me know how to improve!
---
That’s nothing lol
---
Your ending point is a counter argument for spy. 
---
Not sure if your for or against.
---
Im at work....WTF!?!!?!!!
---
I'm 45 and I don't even know what hypnotic blades are!
---
Yeah. I was telling OP to tell people to go fuck themselves if they are triggered over him reserving an orb. Obviously that triggered a lot of people
---
bruh this dude is past boomer, he's already on his retirement fund
---
I thought you were talking about the literal Hydraxian Waterlords in Azshara and was thoroughly confused until I actually read the content of your post.
---
But yeah, I'm assuming the server choice of their faction-restricted transfers were decided based internal metrics neither you nor I have access to. It's hard to gauge this accurately just via the observations of one or a few people.
---
Yeah, well, not literally literally. Although wolves are Canidae IIRC.
---
Talking about heartseeker specifically.
---
There is, admittedly, going to be a period when BWL is getting cleared and then getting farmed where horde warriors are going to do insane amounts of damage, and will be uncontested for a while even while still gearing from AQ. But eventually the blessings outpace windfury.
---
If you don’t need elven you’re don’t really need black stone either.
---
Christ, can you people give some context when posting shit like this? How am I supposed to know this is or isn't a vanilla menu or something?
---
The mana cost ain't something you will ever notice. And the hitrating only makes sure you won't have to cast curse 2 times, since you should not be dps right away anyways it basically makes no difference.
---
Dagger from last boss of SM library. You didn't farm dungeons 30-40?

Ya this vid was really bad. If you have felcloth glove recipe you'd probably be up to 400+g from those runes and felcloth

I mean the top dps warrior did 2700 dmg on lucifron with a 2 hander. Arms is bad, not 2 handing
---
Well you see I worry they refrain from transfers because we are the only RP realm. But in my opinion that would suck.
---
What is the faction split like on the server?
---
If you have someone who can help you get the WW Axe at 30, then that's a pretty big moment. 
---
Level 40 with MS is pretty big too, if your gear is up to date your kill times are actually pretty good for awhile.

Then you get to early/mid 50s and it

He killed 660 mobs and got around 170 gold 
---
Started at 310 gold get to 355 gold by just raw gold from mobs
---
36 fel cloth 1 g each  
---
260 runecloth  
---
Random greens  
---
patterens
---
Thats quite amazing honestly.
---
Covenants all have back pieces you can get, they showed some of them at the panel.
---
I pretty much just hit 60 on Sunday and was using that guide. According to the guide I'm like level 56, but still hit 60. It's decent, but there might be better guides out there? /played is like 9 days something, but I have spent a ton of time AFK to beat the queue after work. I'll typically log in to WoW from work (when able) at like 15-1600 before the queue (or once there is one) so I can be queued up to be able to get into the server after dinner some time. Probably at least a day or two AFK I'd guess.
---
The rumor is that the new client was literally incapable of forcing factions to once specific faction. They had to add new lines of code to make this possible (this was datamined a few days ago)
---
Arms got nerfed late vamilla and fury buffed. 
---
Arms is not netter dps than fury, ever. Its garbage damage.
---
You are just wrong.
---
Arms is shit after weap normalization nerf and will never be a good dps spec. Period.
---
It's never too late to re roll.
---
Too bad that's not wow classic in the slightest. Like at all. They're worlds apart tech wise.
---
Interesting, I've been rolling with a staff all this time. I might need to look into such a setup.
---
to be a humorless twart in 2019
---
&gt; Yet as a druid first off we cant realy use potions  
---
if you want to use potions in forms, you need to make a macro that cancels forms, uses potion, then flips to form.
---
(a.k.a dust macro, because your character just makes a dust cloud and never shows in human form)
---
There are some drawbacks, 
---
1. thanks to batching, even though visually you never appear in caster form, you **might** still take damage as if you were in caster form depending on the batch timing.
---
2. You need a macro for each potion + form combo you wish to make instant.
---
3. your macro needs to cancel aura's otherwise you lose leader of the pack, predatory strikes when using a dust macro.
---
4. if you don't watch your mana like a hawk, you can get stuck in caster form without the mana to shift back.
---
The elitest say you "must" have engineering. I would say that more time you spend in caster forms (e.g. OOMkin, or restro druid) the more valuable enginering is.  And the more time you spend in bear and cat forms, the less oppurtunity you have to maximise your use of engineering since switching forms eats a ton of mana every shift.  The more time you spend in WPvP the more valuable engineering is because you can pick your target, and the exact right trinket for the fight your about to start.
---
Grenades are very nice, however if you watch streamers, seems like only about 1/3 of them actually stun their targets,  they simply have bad placement (target changes path, timing is off, etc),and they  get resisted all the time. 
---
But when they do land they are very nice.
---
I must have been being dense. Will try again later.
---
Nice I,ll remember it
---
Yaaah.. tanks want that too.
---
Pretty good against most classes, especially Mages. But prepared to get utterly destroyed by Warlocks.
---
They're letting horde go from heavy horde servers to heavy alliance servers. It solves both problems this way.
---
Realistically very few people will actually do it so it will have little effect imo, but at least it won't make things worse like it has been
---
For leveling you might value int+stamina more than spell damage, it's mostly about options as you get closer to 60.
---
Okey time for another rewatch.
---
False.
---
But layering is the only way to make the game work by today’s standards.... they should have just had old school Server sizes lll
---
It's more than that, but you already know that.
---
Sorry I can’t help but what’s this about farming shellfish for mount money, please?
---
Why, because you say so? The only ones who would be butt hurt about faction ratio queues would be players who cannot hack it without having overwhelming numbers. There would be no “mass exodus”, that is straight up fear mongering.
---
My advice: Go on a site like icy-veins and look up "best" feral builds for raiding... I bet you there's a build out there that's a "hybrid" tank/DPS build with enough talents to make you a sturdy enough off-tank but still pump out some good DPS... Also, you should have two feral sets: a stamina set and an agility set
---
To the ally that's transferred off stalagg, literally all the rest of the ally are laughing at you.
---
Best horde against the weakest alliance?
---
They won't.
---
They've formed their guilds, friends lists, and inner circles. They have no incentive to transfer off.  The only thing it's going to do is tick off more Alliance and still make the problem worse with Alliance either quitting or rerolling.
---
It's a good sentiment by Blizzard, but it won't make a difference.
---
Ah, that is just an 'alt' (or alternate character).
---
My pally alt is holy and only heals dungeons to level. I basically always assemble groups, but I think it's fun. :)
---
Consecration used to do that way back in the day. It would even persist when you left the area but they changed that to balance a fight in ZG with pally tanks.
---
that will never happen lol and thank god
---
Lol, no .... it isn't.
---
SO when ranking comes out will these stop or fuck it cuz RP
---
Mongoose elixirs are cheap and really really good for DPS, that should be the first thing on your list for sure.
---
I wish the real world was as enjoyable and had as much purpose as azeroth.
---
And to whoever deleted their comment, stating a level 40 couldn't be affected by the raid consumable market, I'd encourage you to look at the materials in free action potions and elixir of greater agility. My level 32 druid is already able to collect materials for both of those, and by level 40 you'd definitely be getting into some of the better herbs.
---
I'd say it's not worth grinding these mobs unless you want Demonic Runes.
---
Switched to more damage output around level 30 and it worked so far for levelling, but always nice to see a different perspective.
---
As a lock im ok with it,  we still have a ton of utility to bring to groups.
---
Not a bug brother
---
You fucking mango.
---
Take a look at guidelime.
---
Hahaha, DiE! Do you have that old "HEAL GRAYRAGE!!" video?
---
Also litterally all the alliance that stayed in stalagg are laughing at those who left and how bad you are.
---
It's more that guilds are requiring people to show up to MC with all these buffs.  There's really no reason to, at least in this phase, when you're raiding one day a week anyway.
---
How much damage are you going to do with a skull equipped?
---
Ok clownsama420 xD
---
Imagine still being in denial that people can be bad at a video game, jesus christ. Please don't talk about competence at ANY level lmao.
---
No me, they were 68 when I passed through.
---
Feral was barely a playable spec until the tree was revamped in patch 1.8.
---
God damn Grobbulus sounds amazing.
---
Won one of these a few weeks ago. Still trying to sell it.
---
Best offer I've gotten is to trade for an Arcanite Bar. Probably should have taken it.
---
That SNL skit is hilarious
---
DiE was notorious for being ruthless. We also had Serenity Now on Illidan, who are fucking famous for ganking a god damn funeral. Ruthless. You're exaggerating. Be less fragile.
---
I'm someone who would benefit from that (Alliance minority on a giant server), but I'm uncomfortable with the idea that someone playing horde, who pays the same amount of subscription as me, gets a worse experience of the game because they wanted to be an orc. 
---
You can't hit players with a stick to reroll, lose their name, or leave their friends (yes, players know people outside their guild) just because you didn't think of issues on launch.
---
Are you saying the pet can get xp without attacking the mob?
---
medium classic is a vanilla high.  it's better to encourage new players to reroll on the server if you want higher pop, instead of letting people transfer in with their bags full of mats and and guilds full of gear
---
Yeah, for the one in Burning Steppes, I quickly learned that showing off by fighting on the road was a bad idea. Make that shit private. A couple players from opposing faction sat and watched respectfully but a warrior of my own faction came charging in. Like wtf.
---
Suit yourself. Some people don't want to waste a shit ton of time in the game and not get some money for it. Tanking is by far the toughest role and requires the most knowledge about fights and pathing and pulling. Highest repair cost. If you aren't at least reserving an orb you are fuckin yourself. I'm fine if shitter DPS wanna wait 30 mins to find a tank.
---
So you're saying the Alliance are seeking heart in the Horde on... Heartseeker.
---
I bought an elven ring for 20g and 30g respectively. Just be patient, hunters rather get some money then taking it and vendoring it. Especially if you are outside dungeon
---
There is a copyright issue since AtlasLoot dev is not affiliated with Atlas dev (who owns rights to the maps) so he didn't want to include it but made it available as a plugin.
---
tfw im on skeram and almost rolled grobb.  at this point i'd paid transfer
---
What, they don’t have WiFi in the hospital? /s
---
It's not so much a mafia as it is individual NEETs camping spawn points all day
---
Why not play an ele shaman? They can heal and DPS.
---
Some flaws and bugs? You mean fundamental flaws that are split up groups of people and causing some to quit all-together? Yup, no reason to get outraged about "some flaws and bugs"
---
I love the work, but...why is an Orc paired with Dwarves and a Human in The Stockades? My immersion is ruined!
---
Oooooh
---
Well it’s extremely good for all non orc tanks cause it procs a lot (makes up for the misses) but I’m not entirely sure as to why it’s bis for Tauren specifically. Orcs just have better axe options. And I haven’t seen many troll warrior tanks
---
Wow, is this at 3am or something? Where is everyone?? Dead server
---
Where are you getting that information?  Last I saw, the server pop numbers were ~2 months old.
---
The unfortunate thing is that the two most heavily skewed servers(stalagg and skeram) have been at 1 layer with no queue for more than a month now.  I dont think there is going to be any queue to force the horde's hand on those servers.
---
I'm glad you're glad I didn't roll on a trash-tier streamer server.
---
Wow...
---
Suspenseful and exciting?
---
You don't.  The real warriors demo shout a nearby mob
---
While I do agree to a good extent. Some classes are really hard to level compared to others. And the levels between 30 - 50 can be quite a slog, especially if you are only doing small bursts of play time. Someone will level incredibly slowly during that range without some time to get a few quests or dungeons done, and I'm guessing it won't be that fun.
---
Actually there is AI technology that can remaster those videos and greatly improve definition.  In about ten years I bet it will be more mainstream
---
Shall we tell him?
---
I just know we funneled the first 3 to our Tauren tanks. Our MT has Quelserrar now though
---
Slow ranged weapons and pets that that's eat anything will lower your bills, can also feed it mage food.
---
You might be able to sell it for a lot to some poor sap that doesn't realize it can't be made.
---
No bullying fren.
---
If I wanted handouts and things for free nonstop as well as not put any effort or work into a game...that's what Id do too
---
Lmao, xferred off Skeram during the first wave. I regretted my decision at first, but anymore. HS is easily one of the best servers for horde pvp. The only people that are opposed are betas that roll on a pvp server and don’t wan to pvp.
---
Yes but leave it to the WonDeRfUl CoMmUnIty to help yo--oh wait they're just range tagging the mobs you're trying to get, in their own group of course:)
---
\^\^bullshit
---
The worst effected servers(skeram and stalagg)  haven't had a queue in more than a month.
---
Not true, has nothing to do with the GPU or it's limitations in this case.  This is entirely about the CPU and the game being single threaded.  The GPU settings are not changing any FPS, since he gave a range of DPS we can assume that its not from a implied cap, thus the explanation is a CPU limitation.
---
   /raidinfo
---
the speed isn't necessarily what matters for main hand, it's the top end weapon damage that matters. if 2 weapons had the same dps but different speeds the slower would have more top end damage. explain over flame boyz
---
I don’t intend on attempting it on my rogue until like 44 or 45 and I’ll likely only run ZF once or twice
---
Has it occurred to you that maybe they weren't targetting the server?
---
Be happy you're in that situation man. We started as group of 5: 1 guy barely plays and is lvl 20ish. 1   nolifed to 40 and never logged on again. 3rd Guy rushed to 60, is full BiS and went back to Runescape while waiting for next phases. Me and the last buddy play regularly but it now took us 2 weeks to find a moment where we could both play long enough at the same time to do a Mara run.
---
Yes OP, find a guild that will allow you to take a break when things in life come up...you know.. a CASUAL guild.
---
And then because of spell batching they get of the cast anyways.
---
I, a prot warrior, was dueling a mage yesterday while we were waiting for raid to form. I have imp shield bash which silences the target. So he starts to cast poly while I'm in melee range to I wait a bit in case he cancels. I shield bash at the end and it goes off. I end up sitting there as a sheep and he's just running away while silenced. Which was funny, but not the best in terms of PVP experience.
---
seems to be around 55:45 A:H but Horde seem to be waaaaaaaaaaaay more PvP inclined. Alliance are mostly farming SM Armory.
---
People played 2H fury all the time in Vanilla. I used this personally: https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/02305021302-55000104405012051
---
You don't need 5/5 Imp Battle Shout if another warrior in your group has it, and dropping a point off Dual Wield Spec sucks, but its not the end of the world. Improved Intercept is sick and the combination of that and Piercing Howl makes up for Improved Hamstring which is too random IMO.
---
And yes, it really sucks to lose the MS debuff but you do get Flurry to partially make up for that and the fact that Bloodthirst will hit for less than MS.
---
You can also be the Nightfall guy in your raid group, drop Dual Wield Spec altogether and try something like this:https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/02305021302-55000104025012251 Improved Berserker Rage is actually a pretty awesome talent that few people ever learn to appreciate due to its placement but you could also take 2H weapon spec with those points.
---
Lmao fortnite
---
Anyone know if it's possible to get to the bar in BRD solo without stealth? 60 hunter so I can feign death at least.
---
The servers aren't nearly as balanced as people act like they are. It's one faction fleeing because they are actually outnumbered in nearly every situation. It's constant and frankly makes the game much less fun.
---
The user saying Kromcrush was 51-49? Having played Alliance, after I left the server checked both factions population in certain zones I can 100% tell you it was not 50-50. Not even close. 
---
On even stacked servers you see morons say ItS bAlAnAcEd because they were ganked several times as the dominant faction. It literally doesn't compare to the constant inability to play the game during peak hours that the smaller faction faces.
---
Did honor get implemented today? I'm in game and not seeing it but cant find anything saying it's in. Do I need to take to an NPC to enable it or did it get delayed?
---
This has been a thing for all of classic. Thats why you read the chat to see if it says "received loot" or else you have to go manually pick it up
---
It's releasing first patch as far as we know which is on the 14th.
---
Holy Paladin with Healbot and Pallypower. Does anyone have any tips on making them look pretty? Right now there is just so much shit on my screen I can barely see during raids. Is it time to get a UI addon?
---
Arms is terrible in raids.
---
Nah they must grow on their own
---
Rank 13/14 are such a punishing grind. No-life status doesn't cut it as an explanation. 
---
You need a full team of people devoted almost around the clock to helping just ONE person make sure they're the highest ranked in your faction. It really does require pretty much 18+ hours of play a day.
---
Blizzard.
---
I’m starting to regear slowly away from int stats and towards spell power stats. I do have an advantage of leveling with a pally 95% of the time so I have less to worry about. Sort of curious to see if more spell damage means I can do the same work with less mana. More man I’m seeing means more downtime.
---
This is the universal warrior PvP conundrum. Fire first or die.
---
&gt; Cant you just post a picture of the loot?
---
no, because the entire purpose of his post is social media promotion of his youtube channel
---
It’s pretty close to 50/50 but there’s an enthusiasm gap horde side for large scale PvP. The biggest guild for them is PvE focused, while our largest guilds are PvP and WPvP focused.
---
It's a button under the raid tab in the raid window man.
---
I'm not exaggerating.. that's actually what soutshore looked like :-/
---
Can't sap or vanish.
---
At the last "official" update, we are SUPER close to 50/50, I think it was 51% alliance. I honestly feel like it is OVERRUN with Horde and they are much more organized for World PVP, but I think that is just poor confirmation bias as I'm still in the 50s and getting picked on constantly. I think as far as large scale wpvp Alliance (see above) are great about organizing tons of town raids, but out questing horde do a better job of roaming in small packs and making life hell for alliance while leveling.  
---
TL:DR; It's perfect balance, if a bit brutal because its so active, and tons of fun.
---
I imagine he finds many holes in his chain mail undergarments. Damned holy farts.
---
Most mages get off on killing Wars without being touched. It’s their mind set for some reason.
---
Because they don’t care about faction balance. It’s entirely player choice.
---
Are you good and have the ability to compensate for someone having a slight advantage over you?
---
If yes then do what ever professions
---
Are you mediocre and will blame not having the absolute max stats as the reason why you lost?
---
If yes then go engi, and find a different reason why you lost
---
Imagine not getting to play with your friends because you missed the cut off
---
Freakin boring.
---
It wasnt hard,  It was just pure incompetence, apathy, or both from the dev team.  The launch was so poorly handled that those are the only two reasonable explanations in my mind.  Doesnt suprise me to be honest though.  There's a reason I hadn't given this company any of my money for more than a decade until classic launched.  They are completely disconnected from their consumer base and make no efforts to reconnect.
---
i am on 257 runs right now, no foror i have seen every class book about 3 times now,
---
If you come to grob - JOIN THE HORDE!   this server is awesome but we need more horde!
---
&gt; I will kill *just* the gnomes and leave (or even save/sheep heal!) their non-gnome party members. 
---
I love this.
---
"Fuck **you** in particular, gnome."
---
Why have people adopted the idea that servers have to be 50/50 to be enjoyable or playable? Do y’all really think vanilla servers were that way?
---
Fucking beautiful, fuck layering never return
---
Simple solution: transfer if you dobt like your server balance to one where you do
---
You have fucking green parses dude. Your best dps on magmadar is 275.
---
This is clear evidence that arms is shit.
---
Imagine only doing 275 dps wirh a god dam BRE. I do 900 dps with OEB on that fight. Almost 4x your damage.
---
You dont deserve that weapon, you dont even know how to use it.
---
I miss Ironforge so much.
---
Interesting
---
The world is ridiculously overfarmed. There isn't a single thing vaguely worth farming that doesn't have 6 people running around doing it at any given point, even at like 6am server time. Things like the Black Lotus, where a single "win" is worth nearly a hundred gold? Forget it.
---
He doesn't do top damage lol fucking green parses.
---
Do it the true vanilla way and spam /train or use piccolos flute a hundred times
---
Some people like wondering if they won't be able to take the boat today.
---
No dude. That's not what I was doing at all. I am a min-maxer, and have played that way for many years, in many games including DnD, WoW, MtG, etc. I have competed professionally in MTG in multiple state-wide events.
---
You are just using the words incorrectly.
---
I think letting people sign up with their friends and then opening up transfers if things get bad is a perfectly good approach.
---
Its always been worthless :p
---
&gt; I'm pretty sure consecration always did apply a debuff in vanilla and even later on. Other horde players can probably confirm from PvPing.
---
It has always been buggy with the display of that icon. Sometimes it will show it but most of the time it will not.
---
Literally pointed out the troubles with queues and the economy for phase 2 launch months ago.  Got called every name in the book about it.  Could have been fighting for this cause for months on here but as always, Reddit is reactive instead of proactive.  I will sit back and eat my popcorn while watching this Reddit melt to the ground when ques and economy woes continue to mount.
---
These people ain't seen shit yet on some of these realms... Think first day was bad? Wait till those layers come off the realms still in queues today....  Same for Lotus pricing, BWL will give you a taste, AQ will devistate the herb economy.   It won't just be flasks either, players will turn to elixirs when flasks are hundreds of gold each, they will be the next thing to explode.
---
AR feels about 60/40 alli. That could just be because they routinely camp brm and light's hope though.
---
It's an artificially generated problem that requires an artificially generated solution.
---
Is the bwl attunment quest available in phase 1?
---
Onyxia is on a five day reset timer so it's not always tuesday. Also, EU resets on wednesday (Molten Core)
---
If it's like vanilla, they will make server groups that aim for as close to 50/50 as possible. PvE servers are a much needed source of ~~cannon fodder~~ alliance players.
---
This is true, but the OP specifically stated in his title that he is 3-6 levels behind which is totally fine for what I said and why I suggested it.
---
I play on Stalagg and heard that a couple of guilds got split up from this. Hopefully they are able to reverse it and fix things :/
---
Difference being that they are now stuck on 1 layer like the rest of us
---
Strawman.  No one is saying they all need to be exactly 50/50 .  Anywhere in the range of 40:60 to 60:40 is fine.  The problem is that a majority of pvp realms fall well outside of that range.
---
Play what you want, don’t be discouraged. Let people know you are new/returning to the game and don’t remember all of the mechanics (be upfront once the dungeon starts otherwise you’ll encounter toxic people and/or be kicked before it starts). There are a lot, and I mean a lot, of guides on YouTube to help you learn. As for classes, if you’re social and can make friends/find an active guild that you’re active in and learn the class, any class is good. If you’re less social/can’t put in as much learning time, mages/priests/shaman/paladins/warriors are group friendly. Druids are good too but are jacks of all trades, masters of none (and good for solo experience). Warlocks/hunters are also great for solo experience. Rogues are great for solo pvp experiences. But really it’s all about being social so play what you want and make friends!
---
I think that level range of 35-55 is the most peaceful time leveling except if you're in STV. Once you get out of Hillsbrad, Shimmering flats, STV is the only other zone with a lot of fuckery about.  Everyone just tryin to level and recognizes the risk/reward of ganking or just going about your business.  
---
Once you get close to 60 it changes again as you're trying to do quests/farm and you might be interfering with the 60's agenda so they start to have incentive to kill you
---
If you mean PVP/Honor that gets added on Thursday, but yeah it’s going to be chaos.  Hillsbrad and STV are going to be insane.
---
No. Phase 3
---
Yikes, the guy is pretty calm but now you just look like an idiot who didn't get his way lmfao, sad dude
---
Unfortunately, vertical sync is disabled already, and I doubt it's any power saving feature since temperatures remain pretty much the same. :/
---
Thanks for the idea, satan!
---
This is evil but if you play it off as a gift? Then why would it be bannable ;)
---
Crossrealm was in 1.12, so 'nochanges'?
---
Also, it solves the problem of over or under populated factions and servers.  Crossrealm provides a near constant supply of players and can also limit the potential for players to queue dodge with premades.
---
I don't know which way Blizzard will go.  Crossrealm bgs were introduced mainly to combat server imbalances as old servers could only field enough players for a single AV at a time.  With our new mega servers, I'm not certain we would have that issue but it would be helpful if or when populations do decline.
---
And as a final note, it also decouples faction performance on a server from win ratios.  If a horde group dominates all of your server's battles, odds are they won't face heavy opposition and you'll be less likely to queue.  With cross realm, you have a lower chance of facing them and they have a higher chance of facing other groups just as good.
---
Horde presence outside of BRM... were always outnumbered there
---
I hope they find a way to somehow fix the overcrowded servers. Its really not fun if you can't farm anything until 0400.
---
“Hey what server are you guys that I’ve been playing with for 15 years going to? Oh cool... wait it won’t let me play on horde side and nobody is willing to move cause you all got the names you want? Cool guess I’m not playing guys sorry”
---
Yeah take the first perd and CHT, and let all the dagger rogues fucking hate your guts. Sure perd is really good for tanks, but the content is also not hard and tanks don’t need perd/CHT to hold aggro. That just looks like greed and loot funneling idiots
---
Thats not what I said at all lol, only that average clear time is in no way indicative of skill, unless you are using the exact same clearing method for all runs as a control.
---
Otherwise youre comparing apples to oranges. Without a control, avg time is simply that, it provides no insight into raid group preferences, whether they like to pace it out and take breaks etc.
---
Maybe try joining their guild temporarily to gain some perspective 1st hand instead of flexing on reddit.
---
I'll just pop into Maura and farm there instead.
---
Probably not. Herod is literally a top 3 overpopulated server. They need 1000’s to transfer off currently.
---
PVE players tend to not be such big fans of even BG PVP. Sure they might dip their toe in and out, but a few weeks into BGs being out there will be a hell of a lot more horde wanting PVP than alliance across a whole battlegroup.
---
Wars should never touch a mage or most classes 1v1.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8LsKYNbqQs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8LsKYNbqQs)
---
Also this. So sexy
---
There are dozens upon dozens of posts about this.  People are raging and I agree.  
---
Faction balance is critical to the game's long term sustainability (you want sub numbers to grow, make the game balanced/fair).
---
Seems low for a 3600, I get higher on my 1600
---
Idk why people put so much effort into hiding player names.
---
Get out of here with your strawman bullshit.
---
Do you really think most servers were 60:40? lol. They weren’t. It was fine.
---
ya but its not bad on solo kills, and u move around find new ppls
---
i guess i started to play wow mid to late vanilla so people sort of considered mc a chore, the gear is not great , and no one really gave a shit about it
---
mid vanilla gear they realised how to stat gear and it gets a lot better but most of the gear in mc other than bindings and mage blade and a few melee things is pretty meh
---
Yeah I was contemplating having hunters or mages at every level bracket to just chain tag someone up but decided it wasn't worth the effort just to boost my friends faster.
---
Eazy to have city planners when you don't pay the bill.
---
Hail Satan!!
---
Hell yeah.  Reminds me of Nostalrius during its peak.
---
It’s all fun and games until they hit return on all 1000
---
Lol, you should look up his comment history. He insulted me three times per sentence in several comments without me ever insulting him.
---
I don't think I can win this fight. This is my resignation.

It was delayed until Thursday.
---
Because priests want you to take your clothes off.
---
my girlfriend is  priest, no bigger joy from a grown man then walking to her pc and mindcontrolling people off the boat
---
Sorry, I was sleeping. Yea it’s Elv UI, I tweaked the frames a lot though to get it where I like it. I still haven’t done the raid frames though because I haven’t raided yet. I don’t use many addons besides Elv. I’ll see if I can find a way to post my exact profile for it somewhere.
---
I never really understood the point of this kind of theorizing. Things like this will never see the light of day.
---
If you check his logs, hes actually losing to half his raid even with BRE. His parses are utter garbage.
---
Lol uneventful boatrides happen all the time on a pvp server. Most of the time they just kill you and you resurrect automatically when you go across the ocean. Even if they kill you again the graveyard is literally 5 seconds away and then  theres rachet guards protecting you. The only time its gay is when a priest mind controls you off but when it happened to me i thought it was hilarious
---
On the other note i have chained freezing traps on someone and the boat left without them. Non-pvp people are such babies. Its all in good fun
---
Ohh, that makes a lot of sense. Since the Ryzen "excels" on multi-threaded tasks, there is no thing to solve this, because the single threaded work of Ryzen isn't that good, right?
---
i transfered to mal'ganis in vanilla and mal'ganis was one of the largest servers in NA...
---
Unless my memory is faulty you could never move between pve and pvp?
---
Dont give misinformation.
---
Pretty sure vanilla was a huge success and the factions weren’t balanced. You act like the entire server is going to show up to world pvp and if the numbers aren’t even the fight won’t be fair.
---
I play on Herod, which is horde dominated, and I see alliance raids owning world pvp frequently.
---
&gt; Blizzard kind of forgot to finish the paladin class before the Vanilla launch
---
Its not so much that as they completely scrapped the beta paladin and gave us buffbots instead.
---
Perfect faction balance, highest pop, the only server with fun events going on, and a super engaging community on both sides.
---
By all means please continue to lol and do not come here!!
---
I miss TBC.
---
You can also google loot tables, or the locations of quest objectives, or vein/herb/fishing locations, but those are all popular addons too. The whole point is being able to have it in game.
---
2h fury is way better.
---
We use the same system, loot council but the tanks will either all roll if wr need it or pass it to another tank if its a bigger upgrade for then. For example t2 helm drops but mt and ot has t1, other ot has blue helm so it went to him. Works for us right now :)

I play with an ATI 270x and a phenom quad core and get around the same FPS in busy cities so something is definitely not quite right, got cool'n'quiet disabled? Or maybe a slow mode button on your motherboard?
---
I mean, you'll be a month behind everyone else. Other than that, it doesn't really matter when you start.
---
Similar situation [on Firemaw](https://imgur.com/xSELwsN)
---
Sendinput is the method through the windows api class. Your argument is only valid if thru aren't physically pressing the keys to perform the action.  Sending the action to multiple windows isn't automation. I do write code, so i actually know this is how it happens. Now shoo and stop pretending you know anything about coding.
---
People always seem to forget or not know.  WoW thrived for the first two years on mostly people leveling alts.  The servers didn't have anywhere near the populations they do now, and raiding was fairly hard and rare on most servers.
---
This same dynamic is somewhat playing out again, though the higher population servers make it much easier to get involved in end game content.  I've leveled a couple of characters on different servers up to the 30's and 40's (in case my current one died out, which it hasn't), and there are always people leveling.
---
It would be tricky, you would have to get really really lucky or use invisibility potions along the way? Stream it if you pull it off.
---
Didn't want to offend someone I don't know and give away his characters name to public without permission
---
When was this? What server? It's still one day, there's no way this is happening every day. We had raiding parties back on Illidan too, this shit happens. It's part of what makes the game fun. If it's that bad, there are other zones to level in. Hilsbrad is notorious for having pvp shenanigans going on, just like STV. If you need to level somewhere else for a bit go do it, or post in global and bring in people to fight back. That's what is great about pvp servers. If you can't handle that sort of thing you should have rolled pve.
---
Fascinating! I’m on Skeram which is mostly horde and alliance, though grossly outnumbered, own the best farming spots at all times. I wonder what specifically causes that to happen?
---
I did \~35-46 in STV.
---
Jury's out on the high 50's; I'll see when I see.
---
Not in eu :(
---
https://nostalri.us/eu
---
Oh god I feel you...
---
Use mail addon to open all mail. Vendor and profit
---
Most bank alts are probably using an addon like postal to automate there mailbox
---
Yeah you're totally right man, that term *never* existed before Fortnite...
---
I didn't say it'd be either or. For the people who are on the fence they can choose this option. When someone transfers on their own it could remove an enrollment slot.
---
If they are using an addon they can very easily just return it all to sender.
---
Yup, limited resources is going to be one of the bigger changes between vanilla and classic
---
&gt;You can't hit players with a stick to reroll, lose their name, or leave their friends (yes, players know people outside their guild) just because you didn't think of issues on launch.
---
Umm.. I think you can.. source: Classic WoW launch and queues circa August 26th, 2019. 
---
My friend group was forced onto 4 different servers in order to play the game the first 2 weeks of release. This was with non-faction-specific queues.
---
No reason the same concept can't be applied in order to force faction balance while in game. If people would rather wait in a queue then xfer then they're making the same choice as those on launch day had to make.
---
At least the faction balance in game would be preserved. That's what's most important.
---
He probably took the 1st onslaught belt and BRE too
---
What's heartseeker, 80% alliance?
---
Back in the day people weren't as good about attunements and raid prep so we did guild runs of non-raids to prepare people and since they were guild runs we awarded DKP. Your MT is probably in the top 3 most involved members of your guild so they tend to get a lot of DKP this way.
---
Then there was also the fact that bidding on tank gear as a DPS warrior didn't do you much good. If you bid up tank gear you had less to spend on that Brutality Blade, Quick Strike Ring or Vis'Kag where you would need to compete with the Rogues.
---
I personally would just start running dungeons that you need your BiS from, so your killing two birds with one stone, as you level you are going for your BiS in the same time, that’s the way I did it. Had got a few pieces of BiS before I even hit 60
---
To be honest without Blizzard releasing actual stats on your servers pop, you do not know the faction split.
---
At one point census addon was semi working, but the addon was broken by blizzard on purpose to hide that info from us.
---
The data we pooled early into the games life is likely incredibly innaccurate so it would be very wrong to assume the numbers for pop are anything like that very old chart said.
---
I do not think many pvp servers are put of the 60 40 range, which is perfectly fine. Its pce swrvers that are like 90 10, that eould suffer as a pvp realm because thats actual imbalance.
---
Maybe I'll get it before the end of phase 2. On the bright side I can go straight from MC to getting my bow.
---
ToS is very liberal on what constitutes griefing. Since this is cruel and unusual, it'd be up to the GM's discretion.
---
They literally made the game a piece of shit on purpose because they listened to retards. "Hey I have a good suggestion for the game" "No we literally want the game to be bad on purpose"
---
Might want to bind tea If your using it so much
---
You can solo omokk?
---
thsi dude is a fuckin pro
---
&gt; Most guilds do not clear Ony and MC in 3 hours.
---
At this point you're just refusing to admit that your raid team does a massive amount of fuck ups. Nothing wrong with that, but Molten Core and Onyxia wipes are 99% down to tactics, not gear. These are the two raids in the entire history of WoW that are least gear dependant.
---
So if you're slower it means you're wiping. And if you're wiping it means you fail at tactics (i.e. your melee are standing in the fire, or your mages aren't decursing). It's that simple.
---
That rule is so dumb for a video game subreddit lmao.
---
You think you need additional resources, but you don't.
---
Yah but hell of a laugh :)
---
Yeah, let me just assume unlikely scenarios instead of going with the most likely one (that they're bad). Good one.
---
Imagine your friends being dicks because they won't transfer back to play with you.
---
The biggest thing I'm going to miss is the cross faction co-operation or indifference.  Everyone will be a loot pinata.
---
I ran, as horde, into Morgan's Vigil in Burning Steppes last night because I'm a dumbass who thought there were horde quest givers there.  At least 15 alliance were just standing there.  And I had a moment of confusion because I just saw red then realized my error and ran.  No one attacked.  Whether they were just as confused as I was or just afk, it was more an amusement on their end.  On Thursday, if I did the same, they would kill me the second I stepped foot into the camp.
---
Currently, we ignore each other while questing because it takes time to fight.  It delays our path to 60.  Sure it's fun but there is literally no reward unless you are competing for quest drops.  On Thursday, killing that gnome while he is questing becomes more tempting because it gets me closer to my rank goals.
---
I played Vanilla from launch night back when Horde was dramatically outnumbered. Horde didn't gain favor until TBC. On my server we played against two of the most infamously ruthless guilds that existed at the time, DiE and Serenity Now. I've been there, it was totally fine and it made the game fun. People are just more fragile now due to the way games have evolved over the years.
---
Don't get me wrong, I never left my original full server nor do I have the desire to, but I understand why some would want to go to one, considering most horde play with a huge faction majority on their realm as well.
---
Oh not at home, so I will check when I get there.
---
Thanks though.
---
&gt; People would rather sit in queues than be on a dead server 
---
Yeah, this isn't true whatsoever. More casual players that don't have 2 hours per evening to queue up and play their game don't give a shiny shit that their new server has less people on it.
---
As soon as they opened transfers from my server to low pop ones, the queues got better by the day. No idea what you're on about.
---
You can't use poisons with sharpening stones.
---
Well generally alot of the people on HS are people who fled horde dominate servers, so likely a good number are those who don't like / aren't good at PvP.  
---
Another bigger factor is I don't know anyone who has been respeccing, we've just been sitting in raid spec, because we're basically on a PvE server, actually running into someone is a surprise throughout the week. I was doing my wintersaber grind at work on my surface in raid spec, so congrats if you beat me in WPvP. Looking forward to P2 :)
---
Yeah If you did it from a toon specifically made for this and then deleted I’d say go for ittt
---
it's a lot better, if you don't know, don't talk.
---
5 characters, 5 windows, 1 action being sent to all 5 windows. Not automation because the action happens. Automation would be a script telling the window to act like a keypress happened when no human pressed the key. Its doing the same thing a hardware solution would, but localizing it to 1 machine, because computers now are more than capable of running multiple instances of games like wow.
---
PvP and world bosses are phase 2, so phase 2 is not today.
---
&gt;  Except it isn't, it vastly enriches your playtime.
---
How so? Since you're specifically saying non-consensual PvP isn't ever fair, how does a rogue 40 levels higher than you camping your corpse makes leveling less tedious? How about a squad of multiboxers sitting on you?
---
And your answer is...?
---
So curious how these are made. Like a mix of 3d using ingame assets but also illustrated backgrounds. Its fascinating.
---
If no lifers were catered, then blizzard would release the next raid as soon as the final boss was killed by a world first.
---
Probably depends on your class.  It's near impossible for me to find lvl 60 dungeon groups as a rogue unless I start them with guildies.
---
Oh really, but on Mograine Instill layered when I joined a group
---
Runn tum Tiber surprise, major mana pots if needed
---
Yeah, I know. You can use either a poison or a sharpening stone, but if you go with poison, don't use the one that dots.
---
Transferring doesn't put you on a balanced server, it puts you on a hugely unbalanced server not in your favor.
---
Until you posted your video, it was very reasonable to believe it was a macro issue. You had no reason to insult people trying to help you. 
---
after i posted my video, you STILL claim the problem is universal despite me being able to do it on my very first attempt. 
---
it's not universal. that's the first bit of info that will assist you.
---
communicate on the forums with that info. point out what server your on. hell, link my video of it working on a diff high pop server. 
---
might assist blizz in identifying the real cause.
---
Come join us brother.
---
The fear of missing out on weapons is to high.
---
Man, that friendliness and strong sense of community is incredible in wow classic, almost the opposite of retail. I love the slow pace too, like I have time to really immerse in the rpg element of a mmorpg. :D
---
There's some guilds that have druids topping the healing meters by an insane margin. Not sure what cheese they're eating.
---
hahah Blood and thunder!
---
For me it is the other way round. The older i become the more boring PvE stuff gets for me. I would honestly like to play the game as a pure PvP game. Years ago i only played the game for raids, which i do not care about anymore right now..
---
A sense of pride and accomplishment
---
The only time I remember needing to flask was to get past patchwerk.  It was a DPS race vs the enrage mechanic, like valestraz on crack.
---
Although to be fair, though my guild was raiding Nax in classic, never cleared AQ40, and only killed twin emps 4-5 times, so we weren't all geared out in AQ40 gear like some other raiding guilds.
---
Yet you include no proof whatsoever. Use specific server subreddits
---
in the future instead of posting go into the dungeon and see if your toushy gets owned
---
hahahaha yess!
---
People said the same about MC pre classic. Didn't age well.
---
Players choose what faction to play and what server to play on. Some people choose to play with their friends too and that influences what server they go to.
---
:3
---
Why is phase 2 going to end the classic when PVP and honor system has been the best part of vanilla anyway?
---
If you don’t need the hit at all why wouldn’t you just take pain weaver for slightly less AP than black stone but a full 1% crit.
---
Go back to retail.
---
The yellow hit cap is the same whether you're dual wielding or using a 2h.  The 9% yellow hit cap isn't because of dual wielding, its because raid bosses are level 63 so you need 3% more hit to accomdate that.  You will get more white misses with dual wield, but its no more than you would in pve against a level 60 mob.  
---
The primary reasons to go 2h in pvp are:
---
1) You can effectively use mortal strike which has 1:1 scaling with weapon damage making 2h far and away the better choice
---
2) Even if you dont go Arms, 2H damage is incredibly bursty and burst is what kills in pvp
---
3) You can use the dead zone to your advantage against melee classes by kiting out of range between your slow attacks
---
I know, it was just meant to be, that's the issue I think.
---
Best bet is just to swap the macro out for non raids. Hell I move a bunch of shit around on my warrior on raid nights
---
Loyalty is both time and xp-gated. Each rank of loyalty requires the equivalent of 5% XP gained at current level, plus a certain amount of time at content/happy.
---
At lower levels you'll probably see your pet ding loyalty levels randomly as you meet the time/loyalty requirement because it's quite easy to gain 5% XP of a level (25% of a level to reach rank 6 loyalty). 
---
At 60 you'll probably see your pet ding with experience as gaining 25% will take quite a bit longer, and the general amount of bank standing / non-xp gaining activities you perform.
---
it's missing about 50 Blackrock spies with scopes spying on everyone 
---
from about 20 feet away
---
&gt;  a LOT of people came in and tried to help you define the problem.
---
My ass, most comments are useless or outright trolling because they didn't read the OP.
---
&gt;and you full on insulted them outright.
---
Because only an idiot comes in with a solution without actually reading what the problem is.
---
&gt;People only started being mean to you after you acted like a fucking 15 year old kid
---
Wrong
---
Stay salty bro
---
You'll be just fine. Your party will probably have to kill all the giants on the way to princess instead of skipping the first couple pairs. Add 5 mins to the run. 
---
Princess will be fine as long as your melee have half a brain and don't stay in the fart.
---
does having 315 (as opposed to just 310) skinning increase your chance of getting Pristine Hide of the Beast?
---
Mate do it it’s super comfy
---
Because those are the bosses of the dungeon :P
---
Could juse use edgemaster’s for the dagger too...
---
thank you! :3
---
&gt;1.	⁠Resource competition is awful on the high pop servers.  You want to kill a world boss?  Good luck on Herod, Stalagg, or Skeram.  Heartseeker will be a haven for those Horde guilds competing with the heavy hitters for these limited resources.
---
Heart seeker is 80/20 in favor alliance. Any horde guild would be better off staying put. They won’t be able to farm mats effectively in the open world and world bosses would be a pipe dream.
---
me at any slight inconvenience
---
WYRP going to be big players in wpvp going forward 
---
Yeah Earthshaker is sweet
---
Already said I do stuff like that in the post, I'm generally wondering if there is a reason.
---
thank you :D
---
PLAYER chat bubbles are handy, but I can do without the BS spam from warlock pets.
---
&gt; It depends what other gear you have. 
---
There is no fixed answer, OP is just trying to make a direct comparison between two pieces of gear that are incomparable because the use is situational.
---
No there was confusion about layers ending being the same as phase 2 starting
---
Ty for this journal entry
---
They said Nov 12 would be the removal of the last layers with the phase 2 content being the 14th.
---
That's the only option for classic, i think.
---
This happened with Oldschool Runescape too.
---
No, skinning skill only impacts whether or not you are successful in performing the skinning action.
---
Seems baffling to me honestly. Flash Heal is simply faster and you cant outplay that.
---
I transferred my priest there originally and none of my friends followed, had to reroll back.
---
Get Quel. 
---
Taking perditions blade from a rogue this early in the game is a huge dick move, and hopefully your guild wouldn’t allow it.
---
zug zug
---
Thx!
---
/r/shitpussiesdo
---
Why did you tell him?
---
It would be pretty much impossible to level pets below you by a big margin if this wasn't the case. As far as I gather, pet xp is handled interestingly. The monster itself MUST be not grey to YOU, BUT the actual xp the pet gets is not necessarily the same as you, but rather a function of its level vs the monster's. Thus, if the monster is green to you but orange+ to your pet the xp should be noticeably different. However if they monster is grey to you it doesn't matter the level difference between your pet and the monster it's still 0 xp.
---
I still think there's a great arguement for hunters being one of the best overall classes to play. If topping the meters is the only game you want to play then you should plan to have a warrior alt by AQ, but otherwise hunter is amazing.
---
Hunters have the least loot competition of any dps class, they have a fun rotation, they are great for a lot of unique roles in raids like pulling and kiting, and their PvE gear and Spec are pretty dang good in PvP too.
---
Plus they don't scale from world buffs and flasks mostly so you don't have to play that game as much to pull your weight.
---
You should let all your neighbors know that anything you haven't nailed down or locked up they are free to take, then?  I mean, if they CAN they should just go ahead and do so, right?
---
Equals, on your terms. Some people can't play video games all day like you. What's equal? Maybe wow should impose a weekly gameplay limit for us 50+ hour work week people with families lol
---
"Just" lmao that's all the content.
---
Shit guild tbh
---
Tank isn't a profession. It is a class. When a tank requests anything, it is no different than a healer requesting the same thing, or a dps requesting the same thing. 
---
You keep comparing the financial advantages of professions against classes. A tank can easily get herbalism and alchemy money. A tank can skin. A tank can mine. 
---
If you think anything else you described here is exclusive to tanks, you're just incorrect.
---
Yeah you are exaggerating a good bit. I am here a fair amount and I have not seen it posted.
---
Can't vendor arrows though.
---
Leatrix Maps... because otherwise you are just having an inferior map experience.

I'm going to be away from my desktop for a couple of weeks, in order to copy over all my addon settings would I just put of copy of the WTF folder from my desktop to my laptop?

Netherwind Horde side s/o!!!

nice

I am priest but I use grid2. Pretty clean.
---
The program is a 'script' that is sending the keypress to the other windows. Are you being serious right now?
---
If you want to plug in 5 keyboards and press 5 inputs go for it.
---
1 press = 1 action.
---
If you want to be a dedicated healer then resto druid (instant heal, brez, roots) or preist (fear, sheilds, enemy/friendly decurses) are really solid. 
---
If you want to also do other things shaman is probably the best. It's better at raid healing and DPS support through WF. It's also disgusting in a ely/resto hybrid where you can do good healing as well as help burst down a FC/pocket healer. It's not as good as being a pocket healer and if you want to hybrid you have to pay the hybrid tax. 
---
Hybrid tax will also apply to druids (if you want to play FC/hybrid spec), but much less so in PvP where their travel forum and ability to escape CC is more valuable than having longevity in fights.
---
He's talking about the weapon buffs, not the shocks.
---
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh that makes way more sense.
---
Apparently I haven't been paying attention lol
---
You just unveiled your ignorance of the honor rank system
---
Pet aggro range in general seems odd, I'm genuinely not sure what determines it unless there is a dice roll on potential aggro times. I've had gray mobs go after me or my pet when I get too close, and then other things they literally walked through my pet and nothing happened.
---
It's because warrior are such freekills when leveling. Especially for mages. You just die in a frostnova and can't do anything about it. Against some other classes warriors have a shot every 30mins but mages... Show no aggression and hope he lets you be is your best bet as a warrior.
---
I love dinging new lvls when I discover new areas.
---
Melee Hunter is exclusively used in pve as far as I'm aware
---
Yep, that's my understanding too.   That's the only option I've been able to find related to chat bubbles.
---
I dont like inferior experiences, thanks :-)
---
Yep, exactly. Would they be for a weekly 10 hour game time limit too? Doubt it.
---
&gt; Coldridge Valley 
---
will come too, soon :3
---
Better than my friends. They leveled slightly faster than me, so we never played together, and then we still hit 60 on the same mother fucking day.... but they still don't understand why I was butthurt about it.
---
Ok lets start with the basics. You're aware a 'program' is just a script executing, correct?
---
Can’t believe I was offline for this.
---
Even that doesn't really mean too much. I have 750g but no epic mount. That number is going to drop to 0 this weekend(i hope atleast)
---
Yes
---
There is an add-on that adds an 'open all' button to your mailbox.
---
Are you 60? If so I think you are still using the old version of blizzard. My blizzard base at 60 was ticking for 160, unless you are doing that on purpose?
---
Farming the whelplings in the wetlands for small flame sacs is good money.  The lowest % chance to drop seems to be 9% on two of the kinds of whelps (lost and red), 17% drop on crimson, and 23% for the flamesnorting.  They sell for around 1g per flame sac on horde side Faerlina.  Mobs range from 23-27, so kill them now if you want to earn good XP while farming gold.
---
Ya well that's the sad part.  Real life for some of these people doesn't exist past this game.  Those are the people I would rather not play with.
---
I remember the buff not mattering at all because you would be stunned, silenced,  kicked,  etc the whole time anyway.
---
As Horde on Arcanite Reaper, I'd totally encourage transferring. I'd say we're mildly outnumbered, in the 45-55 or 40-60 range, but every time I encounter the Alliance in WPvP they get wrecked... until they come back with 2-3friends.
---
The Horde over here are outnumbered, but what we don't have in numbers we make up for in skill. There's also a pretty solid community of guilds working on PvE/PvP content together. 
---
(We're not a super high-pop server, so dungeon groups do take more time to form. the LFG/LookingForGroup chats are always poppin' though)
---
Help us take over Azeroth Thursday! LOK'TAR!
---
yes! [Prints](https://society6.com/imadreamwalker)
---
Thank you!
---
Fair enough. Shoot them at sheep and squirrels.
---
Hes got the helm off rag as well.  Probably a lot more considering he's their guild leader.
---
PvP noob here, out of the 3 cities which one was the toughest to gain control over/which faction leader was toughest to kill
---
It shouldn't for the simple reason that the unlimited MV does not work from across the ocean. So if you're in Kalimdor, you can't MV another player in the Eastern Kingdoms. So my guess is it would work on the boat on the same continent, but would cut out immediately once they switch continents.
---
Targeting low level players with shit gear.
---
Is this the honor of a wow pvp player ?
---
Can they burst?
---
What about the guildies, the connections, the community?  That was all the rage at launch right?  Now just fuck all that and transfer?
---
Level 1. 
---
First part: kill an elite that's around lvl 50. If you get guildie help, it's super ez, have him kill the elite, you go and loot the mcguffin.
---
Second part: get up to the top of Jintha'Alor and interact with the shrine. You can just stealth up there as a druid. While there is a tight timing where you can interact with the shrine without aggroing anything, I guess this depends on your level and aggro range, so if you can get your guildie to distract the mobs for a few seconds, that's better.
---
pvp wow is the bottom of the barrel of pvp anyway, never understood this mentality
---
You can pre-cast, but who knows.
---
Undeniably the best server.
---
they gave us DM early because it was a simple switch to open the dungeon. 
---
P2 was always keyring. 
---
And P2 date was moved 2 days to 11/14 due to the wpvp lag issue.
---
Ya know what, I'm gonna revise it to include racials and things like that. For new players and all. Thanks!
---
Also tank, can confirm. Had 306 fire resist on Rag.
---
What positives reasons are there for faction queues for people who are already comfortable on their server and have established connections?
---
Basically what happens is you either never get to play because no alliance are playing or you try and transfer off but lose any connections you made and your guilds get fractured and fall apart. And even if you manage to move over, you'll be on a ridiculously lopsided server and your game experience will be shit.
---
It is a lose-lose situation for people who *did nothing wrong*.
---
If faction queues happen, people will just quit since either way their game experience is ruined.

Before BGs in vanilla the top groups of PvPers were very much spending tons of time HK trading on my server back then.
---
Definitely not the Spanish Inquisition!
---
Yeah, fucking hate those warriors with BRE getting a salvation proc and deleting anyone who isn't in full plate. Horde has FAPs so palas are basically defunct, where's the alliance windfury elixir?
---
Well, considering the bulk of my time spent in vanilla was long past the content they're adding in phase 2, I've never really been concerned about any of this... In fact, BGs and the honor system are (or can be, for us non-grinders) a blast that absolutely adds to the end game content in a big way, not to mention the additional raids
---
If rage starved use axe of deep woods, if rage is plenty go for flurry axe
---
How many tanks is average to carry?
---
I joined a guild and I'm their fourth tank.
---
I raid with them and have fun, but I feel like dead weight. I still am like 8th (lmao) on the DPS charts but want to do more. 
---
Should I be rolling a two one handed fury tank set up for when I'm just kind of a back up then switch to a shield when I need to taunt? I'm one trinket away from being pre-raid BiS (gonna get it tonight, the quest chain from LBRS-UBRS trink).
---
NOOOOOOOOOO
---
That's objectively not true.  What are you talking about?
---
Everyone needs everything to some extent because everything(some exceptions) has a gold value, either vendor or AH. You should only need if you need it more than everyone else and because a BoE can be sold by anyone in the group for the same amount of money it really should be greeded or needed by everyone.
---
If it's a BoP then the value of using it is far greater than the vendor value and it makes sense for only someone that can use it to need on it.
---
It had an OG date of 11/12 but a blue post moved it to 11/14 due to trying to fix wpvp/lag.
---
Goddamn. I'm Horde but this is amazing. Respect.
---
Time and XP.  In total, it takes 25% of a level and 2 hours, 45 minutes to get to maximum loyalty for a freshly tamed pet.
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Loyalty
---
And no, XP from pvp wasn't added until cata, IIRC.
---
I still think you'll do better playing smart in large pvp areas.
---
120k gold based on lotus price on my server
---
Nr 15min or map max
---
I’d use flurry for faster autos and faster heroic strike spam, plus the extra attack proc for rage generation.
---
&gt; you do not know the faction split
---
Sure, but how is that relevant to the discussion at all?  Even without exact data, it can easily be estimated, and that's good enough to know that faction balance is a significant problem for a number of servers.  It doesn't really matter if my server is exactly 70/30 or "only" 65/35 when its clearly in that ballpark.  The point still stands that anything Blizzard *could have* done to prevent it getting to that point would have been nice.
---
And it'll be lovely
---
Expect Qs 11/14
---
And why do they choose one faction over the other? That's what I'm asking you.
---
Generally speaking, it's not as much a question of your tank level related to the instance, assuming the mobs are at a level where you can actually hit them reliably. What matters is what level your dps are and whether their DPS can pull agro from your much lower level threat generation.
---
So taking SM-GY as an example, a level 30 tank can handle it easily ... but will struggle if he brings along his level 40 mage friend unless said mage holds himself back.
---
It's generally a good idea for the tank to be either highest level in the group, or at most 2 or 3 levels below the highest DPS.
---
Butch a savages!
---
Wouldn't it be the other way around? Wouldn't flurry axe get more rage through more attacks?
---
I think the 'optimal' levelling is to go Fury up to 40 then respec into Arms for Mortal Strike.
---
Then around 50 or so I think you can just pick whichever spec you prefer. Fury/Arms/Prot
---
You can tank pretty much all pre-raid content in any spec IMO. You'll just have an easier time of it if you are Prot.
---
I'd just open all and go poop.
---
I've never had trouble finding groups, and that's silly to say the capitals are empty during the evenings.
---
There are plenty of Horde here, it's a big server, just not quite enough to secure Orgrimmar's gates when you consider the lvl 60 ratio is far worse than the leveing one.
---
I was farmimg devilsaur til the price crashed and....yeah mosh is no joke
---
You can easily kill fire ele patrols at the start, they only cast spells but as they're rather low level they will mostly miss.
---
Starfire crit + moonfire is 80% of most players hp.
---
But that has no relevance to what I said. The queues will be the same regardless of whether Ally get put at the front or not it will just be the horde waiting to get in.
---
Not the guy you're talking to but I thought Ashenvale because she appears to be a scout of sorts and I don't know if they have any reason to be scouting so deep in their own territory at the time of Vanilla in the timeline.
---
this is the dumbest shit ive ever heard
---
the problem this gen is intel can OC to 5 Ghz (or if you drop enough money, they can self OC to 5Ghz) and cause it to be better in single threaded games.
---
i had no issues with borderlands 3 as a result, shit optimization can be solved by having 5 Ghz on all cores.
---
https://i.imgur.com/w1iU9uh.png
---
Everyone knows that. But I'm on a pvp server and I also tank on the side. It's not reasonable to spend 100g to swap back and forth everytime. I answered the guy's question. If you don't want to spend 100g for a couple hours of raiding. You can still do reasonable dps with arms.
---
No way BGs come out more than 1-2 weeks early. People would be in a fucking frenzy ragging at blizz again....
---
Shit storm...  yes.  One of them good old Shit Storms.....
---
Arugal, this was the first two weeks of launch.
---
Waa this expensive on Fairbanks early on
---
I believe you can use it but it wont increase your armor value.
---
Sounds to me that if i kill a lvl 60 my Pet gains crazy amout of xp?
---
They are trying to make every server Horde imbalanced... lame.  Let the alliance transfer off and let the Horde remaining languish with nobody to kill.
---
Isn't it just basically: Kill a mob outside UBRS, run UBRS, boom attuned?
---
Agreed, Im just saying that if you're going to flask that probably makes the most sense. At the very least it's a free major Mana pot at the start of every fight which saves your potion cooldown for a flexible choice between health, Mana, and maybe a restorative potion which can help.
---
Yeah the real play seems to just be offloading the goods during initial panic buying after the announcement. I put in about 40g into fap mats and stone the night before blizzcon then sold a ton of it right after the announcement for a few hours and made like 250 and still have a bunch of the mats left over to sell for p3.  The price spikes so much from unprepared people rushing to invest.
---
How do you speedrun without optimizing?
---
There isn't one single thing that happened to turn classic into retail. It was a series of little changes that, over time, drastically changed the game. If they changed map coordinates in dungeons, or made any other change, it would just turn into a slippery slope. The only way to move forward is by keeping everything the same.
---
Yeah, but the problem is that its simply slower and MC fights right now are so fast priests can spam Flash Heal because they dont care about efficiency atm.
---
&gt;It was 8 in vanilla to begin. so it's not THAT slippery, my friend. If 16 slots provides all this communication and teamwork, wouldn't 8 provide *even more?*
---
That doesn't follow. Less is not more.
---
&gt; is just poor design, and also doesn't exactly make sense from a holistic point of view.
---
According to you.
---
Have you felt this way running BRD and hearing the slaves cries and they starve underneath you? Are you from the Chinese government?
---
Could you please elaborate on engineering items? I’m already a 285 goblin engineer with gnomish trinkets. Should I put the battle chicken in my 2nd trinket slot and are grenades worth using during the fight?
---
Invis pots? Or are there dogs in the first pack that can see you?
---
Unfortunately these mobs will be farmed 24/7 on any medium to high population server especially with the removal of layers.
---
Alternatively, try caster mobs like in azshara like the other guy recommended, or try killing imp packs in burning steppes.
---
&gt;It had an OG date of 11/12 but a blue post moved it to 11/14 due to trying to fix wpvp/lag.
---
This is correct.
---
I actually didn't flame in out, and he did make a ticket about it but GM wouldnt assist.
---
Where is redcar tho?
---
You can do mayb 2/3 the dps of fury at best. Even worse on single target.
---
If you cant afford to farm 100g per week, you dont have the time for a rank grind anyway.
---
100g per week is a joke.
---
If your priest is Holy spec and has decent gear, you can actually heal instances being a good few levels below the rest of your party. So dungeon healing is a quite good method for leveling, barring major level differences between the group. Ideally, if XP grinding is your goal, you want the whole party to be within two or three levels of each other. The moment you add in much higher level characters in the group, the XP will sink drastically.
---
Only thing I noticed that's REALLY important: If your priest is over three or four levels below the content, you risk body pulling adds from far. So always make sure your group clears threats in side rooms or patrols if they wish to keep you safe.
---
&gt; If you gonna have twice the pop
---
Blizzard never thought that the pops would say like this. They legit expected half the people to quit at 15.
---
Every realm has those things
---
Nice I was planning on doing feral pvp but would rather be oomkin. My best friend is rogue so we plan on doing a lot of two man wpvp/bgs.
---
Depends if you are a pvp minded player on a pvp server, or a beta pve player on a pvp server
---
One of the many reasons I didn't roll caster dps
---
Incorrect, you can look up my gear here if you really want to:  [https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/Lg3tG2vjCxKR69dq](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/Lg3tG2vjCxKR69dq) 
---
Not to say I don't want Onslaught belt, but we are giving them to our dps warriors first. In fact, all dps warrior gear is prioritized to them because there is so little of it. You can see our BRE on the warrior Ryuuya in those logs, if you're curious. I'm definitely a little jealous with pvp coming out - I don't even have an OEB yet, still rocking a Demonshear for my 2her, but it's all good - I'll get some pvp gear eventually. 
---
Read my response to the guy you replied to if you'd like to stop making assumptions about me and learn the truth.
---
dude my friend reach rank 14 just playing a few hours on weeekends. take your time leveling and start to pvp in a month or two!
---
As someone who runs a guild I would suggest you contact an officer on discord and explain your situation.  It could very well be that there was a miscommunication among the officer core and they did not realize that you were only temporarily gone for 3 weeks.
---
It could also be that they are trying to progress through MC and build a consistent raid roster and they have doubts about your ability to play consistently.   If you want to find a good guild it may be better to look to join one after you finish your remodel where you're in a place to show your new guild that you will be a consistent player.  After you build that good will, a guild is much more likely to let a 3 week planned absence slide.
---
Or you need to join a more casual guild that does not really care about week to week attendance of members.
---
At least they are trying to make the situation better. Fuck all the players who play on the dominating side of unbalanced servers. You are ruining the game for shit tons of people
---
Are you tanking as furry or prot? If tanking as furry I'd would just use both axes most of the time. Only equip the shield when needed. Having said that, I personally like the flurry axe 
---
I say give them both equal play time and decide which one you like best.
---
That's fine - but its not like you're going on reddit trying to move the goalposts to try and justify why you aren't 60 and that *it's okay that I'm not 60.* 
---
It is okay, but if people feel the need to sit and lord over people who are 60, it's like, cmon.
---
Keyring changes code for action bar/binds and i other such things (like were the game checks when you open a door). 
---
Its not that simple dude 🤣
---
Can't wait for it...suck at PVP, but damn, do I love it.
---
Sweet, I'll get right on it! Thanks Knaxx :).
---
Guess its harder to find a group than to heal to dungeon
---
Wow that’s bullshit you should totally transfer off your server and teach these sweaty no life’s a lesson
---
Shields are fucking useless until you're tanking UBRS, Scholo, Strat and other 58+ dungeons. Even then, they're only useful on certain bosses that actually chunk damage off tanks.
---
Awesome!
---
My guild had a group that all wanted it.  I think I was the only lvl 45, but the highest levels we had were 48 and 49.  Its not to bad until you get into the main area up top with the lvl 50 wolves.  Once you're up there, you will not be able to rez without pulling something, unless you have people clearing the area for you.  Alot of effort for something that I only used once.
---
If you're happy playing that way, it's fine. Why do people feel the need to tell everyone else they are playing incorrectly?
---
It's almost always the slow levelers telling the fast levelers that they are doing it WRONG.
---
Here’s the thing, if they do decide to come out with something to add on to classic they would take on to consideration what the meta is right now and try to balance it. Like ok sure, dungeons would
---
Be cool.. but what if they mess with the talent points or add in too OP items...?
---
Does one need sleep when one has no life?
---
Yeah that's the quest, I actually forgot how easy it was lol. Maybe it is in the game and I completely forgot about it
---
What combat text addon are you using?
---
The whole subreddit seems split between Classic+ and heading towards retail but not doing certain things so that argument doesnt work. Either we move forward a certain direction and add shit that doesnt ruin the game experience but adds to it im sure we are all for it. Again fucking tell me how seeing the map thats already in game but my fucking character displayed on it going to fucking turn this into retail. YES i fucking understand if you add too much its not classic anymore its something different. Thats what most of us want. We want the old classic with new shit that doesnt detract from the classic experience. OSRS has new zones, islands, raids n shit that RS3 doesnt have nor never will. People fucking love it. No one except the vocal minority that care too much about shit that doesnt matter care for some reason. Makes no fucking sense how you guys can spin being able to see where youre at inside a dungeon = the game turning into retail. The mental gymnastics you guys pull is hilarious.
---
I’m not sure where you see OP has perds already. He’s saying he has 3 weapons options he could go for, which I feel is safe to assume he has none and is wondering which is best.
---
You also get rep and firewater.
---
It's a meme post.
---
Ahh, I thought he instantly wiped everything not one at a time.. thanks!
---
I like how literally every comment other than the ones on-topic are useless shitposts
---
It really triggers those memories, even tho I have more about Silvermoon area, but still. :)
---
To me vanilla was the best version of this game, and I rather just leave it as is
---
"Actual Classic" is called Vanilla, just FYI.
---
Every mob you farm and resource you mine / herb is uncontested at all times?
---
The damage on ranged weapons is insane in vanilla. Once you get Ash you just start one-shotting people. The issue with hunter scaling is that you never replace your BWL weapon until you down KT in Naxx.
---
I will as soon as it actually starts
---
How is this 120g/h?
---
You are misinformed. They are related, and layered servers will have more queues when layers are removed
---
If you wanna talk about original timeline then phase 2 wouldn't start for almost 6 months after release. Phase 3 a couple months after that
---
its pretty easy to imagin
---
PVE the main reason the majority of people play this game
---
The tourist mass die off scare tactic was a huge miss on Blizzards part.
---
Servers are bursting at the seams are barely functional during peak hours.
---
Classic.wowhead.com
---
I think you have to be in a group.  In vanilla when you joined bg, you werent automatically put in a group.  You had to form a raid within the BG.  This is how healers got honor.
---
I mean, I enjoy it? It seems like lots of other people do, too? You still get to build a character in an rpg, which is a pretty personal experience as far as games go, and get a lot of variable/random flavor when you play with them at max level, due to the nature of pvp in general. Personally, I never understood why people felt the need to lambaste the pvp in wow - if you don't like it, fine, but I've always enjoyed it.
---
Or, just maybe, they could use the money we pay monthly to fund a server infrastructure actually intended to host an MMO. Instead of one made for World of Instances.
---
Not before BWL came out though.
---
Depends on your class a little, but either herb or mining works.
---
Everyone's attacking you and sweaty existed before fortnite but fortnite has mega popularized it.
---
Double rainbow that I had to make space for. It's like 20/250
---
This will all disappear in Shadowlands
---
The ones that our 18 man ally trash farming group for MC absolutely smashed as we simply came in?  They literally lived for about 45 seconds.   We killed them all and continued into the instance.  I don't know if they came back after as we were busy inside.   I think one of our rogues went down as the only casualty.
---
I'm sorry but the horde on Heartseeker have been exceptionally unorganized.   As someone who plays both sides, they are embarrassing and it's not even about numbers, the ones that have been at BRM are looking for 5 man kills headed to BRD, they scatter the second a raid comes through.   They aren't looking for PvP, those guys have been looking to grief levelers.
---
As an ally player on Heartseeker, I hope more horde transfer in.
---
He used repentance towards the end
---
Definitely agree. I would rather only pvp with horde on my server. Back in vanilla I used to see all the same enemies in wsg, and in open world and it was really cool. Especially the shit talking on forums.
---
holy fuck
---
There is no "right answer". If you purely level from dungeons, holy is fine and you will have a few QoL over healing in ret. If you both quest and heal, then yeah, might want to stay ret.
---
No, not at all. I am simply bringing up the fact that the current state of what it is like to play this game right now, will be gone. 
---
There are solutions to this, if there is enough demand (i.e. opening a new server starting at phase 1). It is not my intention to trigger your defenses, I too will enjoy phase 2 and 3 and 4, etc... I am simply bringing up the idea that this progression of adding new things goes against the core ideology that got us here.
---
This is such a false statement it hurts to read
---
I'm on fairbanks which is apparently a horde dominated server but I'm glad the alliance put up a good fight here.  They seem to do more organized ganking than horde.  Camping BRM and DM frequently.  But hopefully it events out.
---
Honestly Stalagg Alliance is amazing for pvp. Horde are such dogshit and it's super fun to be able to wpvp in every zone and camp Washed Up members
---
The were offering free moves to try and lower server pop. 
---
But you are correct on lowering server cap. 
---
So.. if server cap is lowered (lets say 10000 and pop is 12000) and you are 10001 to try and log on, I’m betting you will be in a Q to log on. 
---
Thats what I got from there explanation.
---
Can you only skin him if you get the dagger from him?
---
Someone must take the mantle of leadership...
---
You can save your passive aggressive nonsense. He was absolutely right. Even Pugs clear MC faster than what you stated and like a quarter of the players is either mentally or physically not even there except for the loot. 
---
If you need this long, its not a gear problem, its incompetence in front of the monitor on an astronomical level.
---
Aren't HS horde the players who actually are strong individuals fighting the power? Everybody who transfers to weaker side deserves all the glory. Would do the same if I already wasn't an Ally on the Gandling
---
It's hard to say with this little information.
---
Maybe they were already on the fence about kicking him and this just gave the push. Or maybe they are just super try hard. .
---
The dungeons were never programmed like that for Vanilla so the functionality simply isn't there.
---
It could be added, since Classic is just running on the same architecture of BfA but ya know how that will go....\#nochanges
---
"Finally I hit 60, now I'll be the one doing the ganking" -Gets run over by a horde of horde.
---
You don't have to be in tank gear to be the 4th tank on trash or almost all bosses. In many cases you only need 1 tank with a sword and board on.
---
I've tried to send a mail for 10+ minutes at OG bank. The server still has not processed it. At this rate I'll get disconnected for being AFK before the instruction goes through.
---
So ye, that's the situation.
---
Explain to me how a horde guild is going to kill Azuregos on heart seeker.
---
I am playing on an Rp server. Thanks for your judgement and contribution to a fruitful discussion. May your real life be filled with as much enthusiasm and rush to judgment as your reddit one.
---
Streamer combat text
---
Yeah, that’s why EU PvP realms have 3x the population of normal realms and NA PvP realms have 2x.
---
They also have ranks.
---
Eh -   
---
for us we require 1G donation pre- mount 5G post mount.   
---
Why?   
---
So that we have ample gold reserves to help lowbies get bags and eventually their mount. We also have a system where you can take out a loan to pay for your mount but you pay a little bit of interest back with the thought being that it allows us to help the next person get their mount a little easier.  
---
You get a LOT of benefit from being in a guild with all the resources at your disposal - its good to have some skin in the game
---
Tips and guidance please ;)
---
I could totally fish at work.  CAD operator FTW.  Most of my department watches netflix/youtube while we work
---
So where's the screenshot of him ninjaing?
---
This is actually a blessing even though it doesn't feel that way. What if you got sick or hurt, gkick with no chance for rebuttal. Even worse you let them know what was up and they clearly didn't care. Find a better guild and put them on blast. If they did this then i'm sure there'll be loot and other drama down the road, guilds like this tend to explode.
---
That's about the only fair point you could make to not want to play here so fair enough. But it's gone down about 3 times in the past 2 months, all for only a few minutes each time. Well worth it imo.
---
And hopefully the DDOSers continue to go to jail
---
Where are the dwarfs in northshire abbey?
---
Take it down a notch, my dude. No need to overreact.
---
When the PvPers can't use consumables Willy nilly because there are too many players to material spawns on the server, things will begin to balance out. Remember that we're running like 3-5x the amount of players per server compared to vanilla days where server pop counts capped at like 3-5000
---
I recall rogues killing Keeshan ENDLESSLY in redridge. And never early, either. They always wait until he's on the last stretch of road and otherwise in the clear for finishing... and then Ambush-dead.
---
As far as I know you can’t macro that many emotes in one macro. I would make a bunch of separate macros and click them all when the time comes.
---
Its always the alliance that leave. Scared to pvp on a pvp server.
---
It's insane that you would keep talking without even verifying this in game. As I already said, what you're talking about is the TBC combat system. Not classic.
---
What do you need to understand your mistake here? Should I upload a video?
---
I am too, I just am concerned that this experiment of Warcraft classic will turn into the retail machine of “we need to keep the treadmill going to keep subs and sell expansion packs!” And therefore lose sight of what it really is supposed to be.
---
wah horde don't have 70% of the pop how can we win if we dont zerg :((
---
Would like to know as well. The font is great.
---
Wow that I did not know b4 but the dancing and farting is absolutely necessary I guess two macros will do hopefully I can be fast enough
---
whaoh guys calm your tits  
---
not all people like to be on their toes all the time  
---
i had that experience on retail, but now with 50 hrs/week job, 3 kids and their mother, i want to play the game at my own pace
---
the server i play on in high/full 24/7, even queues sometimes. so yea there is audience for normal servers
---
"I didnt see it in the open world so it didn't exist."
---
&gt; If I could do it over, I’d go herbs instead of mining
---
Is there a reason you aren't dropping mining for herbalism? It doesn't take long to level up once you're 60 and can walk past most mobs.
---
I'll help **anyone** doing them. They're such hell even without pvpness.
---
I refuse to save A-Me in Ungoro because *screw any mechanical animal*.
---
You are aware by definition something compiled into an executable is a program. Scripts require a scripting engine. Programatically the word script is trying to define multiple actions that a human could perform, but instead a script in an application performs those actions.. You are picking and choosing  pieces of definitions and applying it to whatever term you want. I'll give you that they are similar but not the same.
---
 Multi boxers arent running a compiled script though, so this is a total red herring point. They are pressing a button and a program allows for 5 windows to accept that action. The action was performed by human therfore its not automated or a script.
---
It's dumb when you bring no valid point to support this notion, while at the same time straight up ignoring all the points that you had to concede.
---
Rage is dependent on damage done and nothing else.
---
I completely agree and I cannot wait to play some BGs. I am just worried about where this train is going.
---
I would do herb and farm swifthistle. They will only see an increase in price.
---
&gt;I'm under the impression they were removed yesterday but I haven't seen a firm confirmation on time. 
---
Layers weren't removed last night.
---
This also depends on the armor level of what you're fighting.  Flame or frost will be better against turtles a such, wf and rb will be better vs clothies.
---
(Insert clip of my guild wiping 86 people with 30) wont be an issue to deal with you guys mate :) I look forward to it
---
You don't see any difference between someone moving servers because of queues when under level 10-20-30 and doing it after 1-2 months at 60 of community/reputation building and all the making of friends/enemies that entails?
---
Me. I did not want to play a class I played in WOW. Although I did end up going Horde both times.
---
Vanilla highest level characters: Hunter, Warrior, Warlock.
---
Classic highest level characters: Priest, Druid, Shaman.
---
What class are you?
---
most just unplayable.  Try to mount a defensive raid against a 100 man army coming into undercity, and we all just gave up because we couldn't get on our mounts or cast any spells there from the lag.
---
Best server. Horde here, appreciate the alliance love for PvP and making our server known.
---
this is a question i ask about 90% of subs on reddit
---
And my point still stands as well, fury prot is a viable option. You’ve clearly shown this is possible and works well. But if you take perd/CHT before your rogues, be prepared to be hated and seen as loot funneling. Because let’s be honest here, you doing MC in 2 hours with your elite uncapped threat and my guild doing it in 2 hours 15 minutes with our “capped threat” isnt much of a difference. And garnering the hate of a class for 15 minutes saved is greedy af
---
 *repetition to be expected from a community that has been playing this game for a decade and a half*
---
And some of those keep you from drinking.  My priest tells people like that to fuck off.
---
What you’re saying is “Just solve the problem”. 
---
Sounds good, let me get on that
---
I would like someone mathy to run some numbers I'm treating this blade like a preraid BIS so as a warlock I can either run +14 sd or +19 shadow damge at a 85.71% conversion rate to shadow bolt thats 16.2 damage per shadow bolt.
---
Everytime this thing procs its a flat 100 damage for me can crit for 200 im not runnin ruin, lets say no crit for ever.
---
That means if this thing procs 1 in 6 times i cast a shadow bolt im on par with a Sd weapon
---
Correct me if im wrong.
---
I havent been able to run a sample and this is where I am asking for help if anyone who has a blade can run the proc rate with a decent sample size. There is going to be alot of RNG involved but the general feel I have with this blade is its probably behind a SP weapon but not by a big margin this thing has a FEEL of a decent proc rate. The THIS BLADE IS TRASH I cannot agree with I can agree with "its worse" but by how much?
---
Not a bug. The faction based transfers are a new thing. Prior to this, there was no limitation of certain factions transferring out if they are severely outnumbered.
---
Yep. People wanna make money in the game. So I will continue to charge, or reserve orbs or BoE/BoP trash. If somebody needs a tank that badly, they can reroll and level to 60. Or they can just pass on everything that is not an upgrade.
---
*You Died*
---
Normal sight in Mirage Raceway at most hours, except very early of very late. I haven´t logged in today but I left my main in IF just to check how it will be with no layering
---
Well at least post the clip. Also I play horde on a different server lol.
---
Right? Why would I risk having fun downing all major cities if I can lose my PVP ranking?! Gear is more important!
---
I had a GM who was lovely, but wanted everyone to be happy. So he allowed an officer to step outside of their role. That officer left with half the guild later and the GM was quick to forgive. The GM later stepped down and joined the same guild as his girlfriend who was GM.
---
We used to be friends and the rift that started to form hurt. I tried to keep the friendship going, but he didn't care enough. So I had to let go.
---
Nah, your fine as is.   30-45 is the best range for leveling as a warrior.  Before and after that its just kind of tough.  Make sure you keep an up to date sword and board with you, save yourself the trouble of waiting for every dungeon to find a tank and just fill the role.   
---
Power through to 60 and tank till you have enough prebis to raid as dps.  Then make the full time DPS swap and start raiding.  You will not regret tanking dungeons to speed life and the grind up.
---
5 days and 7 hours to reach 60 is VERY fast
---
A) I had lag
---
B) they reduced draw distance and run less server side checks so less server strain.
---
From what I heard, the UC raid wiped twice before the tb and org raid had to reinforce it. 
---
Hell, they almost wiped again due to Valimathras' aoe
---
Looked like a thorium grenade to me. And he was using SoR not SoC.
---
Why because affliction locks are now usable in raids? What needs rebalanced, people just end up avoiding the builds with a lot of status effects.
---
If coordinated BG group joins result in groups of opposing factions joining the same BG, it boils down to:
---
1. Get 20 players, 10 from each faction.
---
2. Coordinate group joins for WSG
---
3. Alternate wins.
---
4. Profit.

 **\*** Chicken cannot be controlled - it will FOLLOW you around and attack anything within its agro range.
---
is this replacing "OK boomer"? just want to make sure I'm keeping up
---
Sure.
---
Personal experience tells me otherwise.
---
Nope. I'm crushing shamans in duels and there's basically nothing they can do to touch me regardless of which pet I use. Which is not the case in every matchup might I add.
---
Both choices made by Blizzard. WC3 Night Elves were pure savagery. They were the most popular race at basically all levels of play.

Bruh, your just making me want to play Grob
---
Im rattlegore so i have a free character transfer but i have to represent the Rattle Gang
---
That's because 95% of the server have had their layering removed weeks ago. Only a few servers were today.
---
if you want some decent money then find a group that will do jump runs in DM east... That is if you are 275 mining or a herbalist. 
---
It's flat profit is pretty decent, but its upward potential for the books is amazing.
---
Reroll my son, it's never too late
---
Shouldn't it have also bolstered Flametongue, if that's the case?
---
You'll be better off in another guild. We all have our stories of bad leaders who treat their members like garbage. Better to find out now that they suck than to find out after committing more time and energy to them.
---
I think we know, right? They haven't said anything about making changes to content once all the original vanilla stuff's been rolled out. I really wouldn't be worried until there's smoke about anything beyond, what is the last phase again? Seven?
---
The calls started coming in about a raiding heading toward TB.  Then another call about a big raid outside Org and I thought, "which city are they hitting tonight?".  I flew to TB to help defend it, but I arrived too late.  I thought the elevators would help us slow them down, but there were too many.  So I flew back to Org and got an amazing overhead view of the force attacking there.  
---
I made it to the throne room and got into our hastily gathered raid and we tried to put up some kind of defense.  A few seconds later I learned the definition of "Steamrolled", as the alliance swarmed in.  I was able to kill a few, but we couldn't prevent them from downing Thrall.
---
So, screw it, I thought I might as well do some questing (I'm still only 58).  I grabbed a Zep over to the undercity and found it under attack as well.  I thought, "well since the main force of Hurricane was in Org we should be able to repel these guys".  I joined the raid and headed to the throne room.  By now the TB alliance raid had joined with the Undercity raid and they were over 200 strong.  Our 40+ were no match.  Steamrolled twice in less than an hour.
---
Ouch, I have to use a doll to show where the alliance hurt me.  GG you guys.  Party up and celebrate your win, but know this, we will remember.  We will be coming for you.  We are learning well and will deliver our vengeance in time.
---
I am planning on alting an Orc Hunter soon, but I have a small question that you guys may help. Whats the advantages of getting a pet at lvl 10 and sticking to it and gain loyalty, over switching for new pets every time you have the chance to tame for exemple a rare beast?
---
Explain to me how. When the ranking system considers all players on your server, not all players within your faction. Alliance and horde compete with every other player who gains any honor that week on the whole server. I actually got R13 in vanilla. I think I know how it works.
---
They're not.
---
Look at all those people who think they do but they don't.
---
So you experienced lag comparable to this clip on lightbringer or northdale?
---
Are you sure about that? I thought they made it pretty clear the amount of layers had nothing to do with the population cap on the server
---
I just don't see why it wasn't included on release.
---
In all honesty, from this comment... I would wager you are a waste of MY tax dollars.
---
There are 2 reasons for wf, even though dps might be lower. First, burst is great for pvp situations. Second, it's way more fun to have a wf proc than any of the others. Fun and optimal dps do not always align.
---
That’s pretty depressing lol.  I’d like to see your gamer throw a tantrum at work because he didn’t get his promotion right away haha.
---
It's a mutual relationship.
---
I've too learned not to invest in a guild. A guild could die any day.
---
There are some lotus spawns in elite areas that are hard for non rogues to farm.
---
IIRC average /played for 60 is around 9-11 days.
---
It is not normal on any server for your own faction to not be able to secure the gates immediately outside your major city. =/ 
---
That just sounds depressing and demoralizing. 
---
Are you sure your post isn't a case of misery loves company?
---
you have zul'farrak, mauraudon, sunken temple, felwood, azshara and soon the plagueland to level up in.
---
Yeah, about 2.5 hours for MC, and then 15min for Onyxia (of which 10 were trash)
---
&gt;  they should have just had old school Server sizes lll
---
Judging by the sharp dropoff of players after the first month, original 3k playercap servers would lead to lots of them being dead and requiring merges with other servers.
---
Someone posted a meme before the maintenance.  
---
Do you get all of your information from pictures on the internet?
---
If you're a hunter you can solo DM North Tribute and sell the loot from the chest. I did a 20-minute run yesterday, got Rod of Ogre Magi, Tarnished Elven Ring, and Ogre Forged Hauberk in my chest. By the time I had sold all three (about 30 more min to wait and run through) I got 170g.
---
I mean the horde players on Heartseeker didn't "dodge" anything so, what?
---
Also hard to blame the Ally players when faced with an 80/20 one way or the other, they chose the one that allows them to play the game
---
total online is irrelevant the lag is from the exponential increase in processing to handle hundreds of people in 1 area.  If a pserver did it with the same number of people they did what the guy above is saying because stuff like that is the only way to cut down on this.
---
I'm not missing the point, you are. I'm not comparing class to profession, you are. I am comparing money to money. Point is, people try to make their money any way possible. I am going to make my money as well, since tanking is the least profitable class out of all. You do realize classes like mages are charging 5-10g a run for SM runs right now to power level alts?
---
I think warrior into spriest is actually worse if they manage to mind control the recklessness. Warriors without reck can't even do damage in that matchup.
---
I transferred off in early September and the census addons are broken - so I can't speak to how it is now.  But it was a nightmare when I was there.  Once I leveled into contested zones, I quite literally could not quest.  No, I'm not being hyperbolic and metaphorical - I couldn't quest.  Not only were all quest NPCs camped, but they were almost exclusively camped *by Horde*.
---
At the time I was there, nearly all of the Alliance I had spoken to had taken to leveling exclusively through dungeons, because open world questing simply wasn't viable.  That wasn't for me.  Questing in the zones was part of my vanilla WoW experience.  So I finally said fuck it and left.
---
Maybe it's better now.  I don't know why it would be, but maybe it is.
---
Did you say comparable or NO hiccups?
---
Wrong. They compete with all players on their server. LOL. You guys really didn't know this? Omg too funny. Almost no horde are getting beyond like R11 with these ratios until phase 5/6 when you can run sands in silithus while you sit in your queues.
---
Extra cost is worth to get Krol at 51 imo
---
[Unsurprising.](https://puu.sh/EDJVg/75c9f00254.png)

I think  2003-2004 aesthetic would have hated them. Now however with games that prominently feature backpacks, a lot more games with a "Survival" aspect, I would love them and others would as well.
---
only the top guilds will use flasks for their dps
---
flasks will mainly be for tanks and healers mostly
---
The hardest part about Tribute runs are the things that happen less than 5% of the time. Warlock's banishing you, feign death not working, your pet not aggroing mobs its supposed to aggro etc.
---
Congratulations, you got the gold medal for mental gymnastics you were so keen to award. 
---
Just for you, quotes from Ion:
---
&gt;We are trying to manage long term healthy populations on these servers around a unique sort of game launch. 
---
&gt;and we want to make sure because of how important community is in Classic in particular, that we have healthy server populations.
---
&gt;And the reason why we're doing that is so that down the line and not too far down the line, once the initial rush has passed, we are left with long-term stable, healthy communities that can support raid guilds and PvP across both factions and folks that are going to progress into Blackwing Lair and Ahn'Qiraj and Naxxramas and all the rest.
---
Unless you're Swifty and have pretty much all the best raid gear so you get to rank 13 as Fury, fucking up motherfuckers all along the way.
---
I'm convinced this sub is being astroturf by blizzard.  So many thinly veiled blizzdrone posts recently.
---
I think you just listed the differences. Trust me, I'm aware. I first changed servers at level 9. I then do it again at 60. I am fully aware of the differences of doing it at different levels. 
---
At the end of the day, both times I transferred were so that I could better enjoy the game. Once so I could get last queues and just get logged in.. and again when I was done with a toxic server environment. 
---
I'm not saying they are the same. I'm saying it *needs* to happen in order to restore balance and that is more important. It works, because at the end of the day players will need to make decisions that are best for them. I know, because I've done it.
---
&gt; Why does no one consider cho'rush blade?
---
i think because people run a full trib and forget it exists
---
If you quit the game because of this you are a bitch plain and simple. Most likely all Alliance players, they whine the most out of anyone
---
Thanks man!! What a name lol. 
---
Anyway i can’t find it on curse or twitch do you have a link? Maybe github, etc..
---
just like devilsaurs
---
So you will never give your guild anything unless they give to you first? Doesn't sound like a mutual relationship to me. Sometimes you have to give before you get as well.
---
I've yet to see groups specifically ask for pally-tank, but I have seen them saying like "(even prot pally)".
---
Though, I have also had groups ask if I can tank (instead of DPS) after joining the group and them "LF Tank" for a few minutes. - Sadly, I do not have nearly enough spell damage to tank as Ret; looking at the threat generation.
---
Comparable
---
Sorry you feel that way. I dont see how many video posts wouldn't be that in one way or another though!
---
There could be good members in the guild that do. Stay in touch with the ones you liked. As far as the leaders of the guild go, who cares about them, they aren't worth your time if they will kick you over that.
---
I wouldn’t agree with the poster above. If you’re rage starved it’s mostly likely due to missing/etc. Flurry axe is faster wep speed which is more consistent rage gen due to misses and parries being a smaller dps loss.
---
isn't grobb an RP server? RP servers always favor alliance
---
Did you make sure numlock was on before you bound the keys?
---
I´ve been killed by that elevator more times than the ones I want to admit ... last time the elevator monster decided to take a bite on me I was actually typing to the group that I was in Undercity to grab a quest for the dungeon we were running and BAAAAM it killed my toon. The party chat started to ask if there was a raid on the city ... "yeah God damn Aliance killing low levels" ... /shrug
---
I am pretty sure the train is going to the same place Vanilla WoW went. I am still trying to figure out your logic with your posts.  It seems as though you are concerned that Classic WoW is going to turn into....Classic WoW.  It kind of feels like you are just trolling us.
---
Ahh now I see why I'm getting downvoted so much
---
Elemental shamans get a guaranteed double crit due to batching.
---
The raids are already easy. With more debuff slots they would become trivial
---
it's Blizzard's fault ultimately. Not sure how you can blame Skeram horde for what happened
---
I have a 2600 and capped to 144fps because no reason to go over that with vertical sync. My entire PC runs quiet with nothing ramping up ever during game sessions. There is something else causing this, not a AMD 3600 processor not being enough for classic wow.
---
On fairbanks as alliance. You guys do a decent job with the BRM camping too. Just confirmation bias given the threat levels to us.   
---
The best data we can get says it's about 65.8% horde to 34.2% alliance.  incomplete data, sure, but that's the snapshot they were able to get from combat logs. I'll tell you this though. it's been hell leveling compared to vanilla. So many horde everywhere. The only thing that kept me going is rogues that forget that as a hunter I can take them out even if they got a few levels on me. Made for some redemption moments after getting thoroughly spawn camped by 60's.    
---
I REALLY hope some of the horde take off... but i'm not holding my breath.  no incentive.
---
What requirement do i need to push to my guild to get them ready for BWL, i know we need to have  [Onyxia Scale Cloak](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=19093/onyxia-scale-cloak)  but are there any other things?
---
Are you telling me that blizzard haven't reduced draw distance? i mean for godsake it's even reduced in dungeons? something that private servers never had. Mobs actually RESET in classic dungeons if you pull them to far away from their original position? I dont know why you are trying to defend this lag when they SHOULD and MUST be able to host servers that dont lag in world pvp? And with that statement i mean it's fine that lags occurs but it looking like this when you are 200v200?  [https://streamable.com/i14fd](https://streamable.com/i14fd) What's the fucking point ?
---
Only the super important information like wow layering status.
---
Level 26 noob mage here. Finished Silverpine Forest and Barrens. Should I level Ashenvale or Hillsbarad?
---
one question, why do you inflict this to yourself and others ? My purpose is not to be mean or anything, I suppose you already know paladin tank is crap until BC, you're going to have a very hard time doing your job, and people getting with you in groups will also have a hard time, can't dps as much as they would like to, and generally have to play around your pally's shortcomings
---
There is literally no + side of being a palatank pre-BC, for yourself and others, so why ?
---
Again, I'm genuinely not trying to antagonise you, it's just something I can't understand. Like I wouldn't go into a raid as an arms warrior, because I know it's detrimental to everybody, so this I don't understand.
---
What if Blizz just said fuck it and allowed faction transfer for very imbalanced servers?
---
we asked for it the first time it happened, they continued to do it multiple times after that. While it's good they finally listened, not having to tell them how to run the game in the first place would be great
---
Humans make mistakes, they don't move as one stacked unit, they don't all react at the same time, maybe they use the wrong ability or something distracts them. 
---
A program won't do any of the above.
---
POR LA HORDA
---
Some of this is better than Blizzard art. 👍👍👍
---
This actually looks like the winner
---
Please do! Looks great!
---
You could even PUG the current raids while looking for a guild longer term for the next phases if you need the time to choose.
---
Feral druid with pvp gear will have a good chunk of Int. Plus theres a shifting trinket in BWL thats awesome.
---
Basically whatever cc's a classes pvp trinket removes are usually the ones that classes toolkit cant counter
---
I dinged at thrall but didn't intend to just happened.  I saw a few others post the same thing though and figured nobody really cares about some random dinging 60 especially a month after release.
---
It's amazing how bad some players who instigate fights are, thanks for showing him who's the daddy. You make your fellow Whitemane Hordies proud.
---
&gt; Yes, according to me. Fuckin' duh. This has always been a matter of opinion. 
---
 No it isn't. The discussion started with wether or not Consecration took up debuff slots.
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dv2z3b/psa\_consecration\_appears\_to\_take\_up\_a\_debuff\_slot/f7bmium?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dv2z3b/psa_consecration_appears_to_take_up_a_debuff_slot/f7bmium?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)
---
See how I point out an objective truth and you want to start discussing if it is good/bad? This was never about opinion. You just want it to be.
---
&gt;Sure it does, according to you. You argued that fewer debuff slots  fostered communication and teamwork since you have to coordinate which  buffs to allow. Well, restricting the debuff slots to 8, like in actual  vanilla, will surely *further increase* the communication and teamwork required, since you're working under even tighter constraints?
---
No. Only an idiot would draw that conclusion. The concept of a limit fosters communication and teamwork. Nothing has been said about what lowering or increasing the limit would do.
---
You're too eager to jump into a debate when literall all I did was point out that Consecration takes up a debuff slot. That is the last I will say on the matter.
---
they just want to play the game they pay for. Don't blame them for Blizzard's extreme ineptitude. They have to choose between 80/20 in their favor of 80/20 against them. It's an easy choice unless you're dumb
---
Holy Paladin - Green Lens of Healing or Judgement Crown?
---
its 1000g/hr if you charge 100g per person!
---
YAY CLICKBAIT
---
Yep, I like to read these threads with some popcorn while I enjoy leveling and gearing up on my nice, stable, healthy population PvE server
---
I keep saying this exact thing but some people really want their anecdotes to be reality.  As a 15-year Hunter main, I wish it were, but sadly it's just not the case.  I can top Shazz because of our strat (no melee on boss and the casters are neutered a bit there when dispell on him is too slow), but otherwise, if I top the meters on basically any other fight, it means others have screwed up in some way.
---
It’s not hilarious
---
Having used the razer naga for a long, long time, go with the Corsair Scimitar instead. It looks better imo, but mechanically it has lasted me 4xs longer than any Naga I've owned.
---
Found the no life that banks lowbies for hours on end , lmao.
---
Because, as we all know, the only reason to ever build a computer is because a new game has insane hardware requirements
---
multiboxing is 5 characters controlled by ONE HUMAN.  are you serious dude?  lmao imagine thinking multiboxing is better than having humans controlling individual characters LOL
---
So set up an ambush at those flight paths?
---
Arms isn't as strong in raiding as fury.   While I always recommend playing what you wish to play, keep in mind not all guilds will accept you for it.  Make your own choices, enjoy them, just understand people are intolerable assholes who live to just be dickheads who think you should bend to their will.
---
heheh heh that was actually funny
---
I got my leaf on Sunday at my first ever molten core raid. I’m looking forward to trying this quest, though I’m a bit nervous about people ganking me or attacking the demons and messing things up. I’m hoping to do my first Onyxia raid tomorrow. Do you need the sinew from Onyxia before doing the quest, or just to get the bow?
---
I wonder how they accomplished that.
---
They definitely meant to have it faction locked from the beginning and fucked up the launch lol
---
lol no dude. we didn't ask them to announce both factions could switch, so both factions plan switches, then they start switching, then in the middle of that they stealth change it to one faction so half your guild transferred and half didn't
---
how you can think that's ideal is beyond crazy
---
Most guilds are stockpiling lotuses/flasks right now since they're not needed in MC.

plz stop talking to me psychopath Im sorry you drank the koolaid and take america world police very seriously
---
Different guilds have different loot-based systems. Some will argue that if the guild is a fully benevolent and has every member completely in its trust, then loot council is the best system.
---
I sometimes think of loot council as analogous to one player playing a traditional JRPG, where gear drops and you simply look at your character roster, and make straightforward decisions on who gets what. The burly fighter/tank gets the sword. The fragile healer in the back gets the robes, blah blah.
---
And it would be this simple, if not for the human element that introduces all kinds of politics, perception of effort and the "I deserve it because". Therefore DKP systems were invented to make some attempt to impartially measure an individual's progress.
---
Every system has their pros and cons, when I compare all the guilds I've been a part of, from DKP systems to loot council, to just straightfoward /roll guilds...which was the best system? For groups comprised of complete strangers in a pug raid, probably just the /roll system for mainspec. For guilds there's everything in between.
---
Mine does a EPGP with loot council kicking in for weapons. IMO it's a nice hybrid mix, not to say it hasn't caused controversy within amongst some members who didn't understand the system, but it's what I'm happy with. Different strokes for different folks.
---
Will do!
---
This is the correct answer. I found it much more comfortable than the Naga.
---
300 (your skill) + 25 (the rod) = 325.  To get to 425, you'll need to use Aquadynamic Fish Attractors (+100 fishing for 5 minutes).
---
Also, note that there are only a few (6) locations where patches of elemental water appear, only 1 patch is spawned at any given time, and the respawn time for an individual patch is &gt;= 1hr.   So basically, this means that you may swim around to all the locations and find none spawned, or you may get lucky and find 3 or 4 in succession.  Fishing for essences is a gamble and (in my opinion) is best viewed as a bonus rather than something to be relied on.

This is probably the worst 19/16/16 build you could have come up with. Just awful talent choices with the points used.

12 programmable and exchangeable side buttons, good build quality but a bit expensive: roccat nyth.
---
Classic has 100s of changes already, blizzard could have just told them to fuck off like they did with all the other changes
---
I'm a mage. I agree it's a complete waste. The officers are pretty set on pushing for a 30minute clear though. Not sure what else to do about it. I want to be in a guild capable of clearing Naxx but I don't know if it's worth dealing with this much effort to clear MC.
---
We do. So many that I ain't even gonna bother finding a source. Check the official forums.
---
Thursday is the day.
---
the best quest in the history of WoW imo.  I completed it \~3 weeks ago and felt great.  the best feeling was being proud of my 13 y/o self for doing it so long ago - I was a total noob.  I believe I even had to have a hunter help me with one of them lol but still proud that my young self pulled this off in a time of very little information &amp; little mechanical skill
---
pretty sure I lobbed the shadowforge key straight into the lava after getting it. I'd rather have the bag/bank slot. Sorry Mr. Ghost.
---
&gt; Have look through the top 50 horde guilds on warcraftlogs and tell me how many full-time ele shamans you see (not a resto doing damage on ragg).
---
I never said ele is optimal...
---
Was going to say the same thing. On my layered horde dominated server, from 2-7am last night I couldn't farm at felwood satyrs, epl water eles, timbermaw or get any mining nodes in BS. Eventually got some space at Winterspring blue dragons with a bunch of hunters having a NAP. I don't even try farm in the world in peak time. It's going to be a very different experience to vanilla once layers are gone, it's just so damn busy.
---
Defender of the Timbermaw trinket.
---
There is a difference between BiS and having BiS. The black stone ring is still incredibly strong if you don’t need what the AGI from tarnished currently offers, which for all intents and purposes would mostly be directed at warrior since they don’t get any ap from agi. Regardless, the difference is pretty minuscule and blackstone only wins when you hit a certain crit threshold.
---
I really don't want those high pop server, layer abusing asshats to come over to NW and jack up our AH though.
---
The real difficulty of the hunter epic quest is killing the demons without having someone come by and try to help you.
---
HAAAHAHAHAHAHA
---
I've checked, but no mention of the keyring from the ones I saw.
---
I want this as a twitch emote.
---
Yeah, exactly. They really had no clue what the hell they were thinking. Their servers can't handle WPvP at all and layering didn't fix anything. Obviously sharding sucks I'm just saying that it's what's going to happen unless some major server changes happen..
---
The guild master was an utter twat. They were aiming to be the best guild.
---
I had friends disband our guild and join that one, and the GM denied my request for being a social. That rejection was very hard to take. I became numb to living.
---
Not really. There were multiple server downs a week. To say otherwise is a lie.
---
Hell even on the newest server they launched (months before classic) it seemed the server would go down like clockwork every 4 hours almost like they stopped giving a fuck.
---
Ah yes the good and reliable "ad hominem fallacy'
---
Thank you for showing your colors.
---
way more horde than alliance on gehennas...check the pvp videos on youtube
---
Only if you're actually raiding and putting together full resistance sets.
---
When you build a rig for the first time in over a decade because a game is announced, it isn't too much of a stretch that you built that rig *for* the game that was announced.
---
huge true, not false
---
Stocking raid consumables is pretty big. Having everyone flasked up for the first few weeks will help a lot.
---
Ok seriously:

It's a cheapo knockoff MMO mouse, sub $30. It has an alt fire key, sensitivity adjusting buttons, a thumb shelf, weighted, and 12 programmable keys on the side. I've been using it on PServers for over a year now, zero issues. It's a fraction the price of competitors like razer or logitech, and a bunch of their MMO mice don't have thumb shelves which is just bad design IMO.
---
I think the following will happen:
---
- Blizzard is hosting 20 servers on the last phase or expansion for Classic.
---
- New Server starts on Phase 1 (Total 21 servers)
---
- Population reduces on older servers due to population being spread to 21 servers.
---
- Older servers eventually merge (Total back to 20 servers)
---
And the never ending cycle of new servers and old servers continue... with manageable costs to Blizzard as they were always hosting the same amount of servers.
---
the mistake you made was thinking I wanted to talk to you or have a discussion/argument.  blocked
---
they aren't transferring people because of the alliance horde ratio, they're doing it because of the population of the server. Does you server have a queue most the time?
---
&gt; 3x the population
---
&gt; minority
---
But can you run Crysis?
---
Imagine thinking being good isn't fun, and being bad is fun.
---
Yep it does, pretty easy to set up too
---
I've tried that but the big gap between the XP &amp; top bars drives me crazy, and I can't find a way to fix it and make it look good
---

---
&gt; Blizzards intention was that nobody on the Alliance could transfer.
---
an announcement ahead of time would have made their intention work a little better
---
As a warr at 49 you have a couple options. 
---
Precision targeting taunting and sundering as prot. Healers will love you but you’ll do no damage.
---
Tanking as arms in battle stance. Being the initiator and getting hit with no shield will gen high rage and if you can lead dps you’ll hold aggro with sweeping strikes, whirlwind, and cleave.
---
Healed a 52 arms warr tank through brd. When he charge pulled - 350 dps. When someone else pulled, cced, kited etc. 40 dps.
---
&gt; As all those raid loggers
---
Raid loggers are people who log in for the raid, log out after, and you don't see them till next raid. 
---
The people you are referring to are parsers
---
Sunder armor.  Don't miss an opportunity at revenge.  Cleave, once you draw the mobs away from cc'ed mobs.  Demoralizing shout will help early.  Shield bash works to gain threat as well as interrupting the target.  Taunt if you have to but save it for when needed.  Tell your dps to not be idiots and let you establish aggro first 
---
You are getting to the point in the game where prot spec starts becoming a little more necessary.  Not absolutley yet but some points in threat generation would help.
---
I don't use twitter and fuck you for leaving that as the only (visible) option.
---
"Normal" is the name of the server type.
---
It will sell, but nobody knows for how much. Many people are hoarding their twinj items for p3, so that may flood the market.
---
Yeah arcane is kind of bad for PvP. You also miss out on ice barrier which helps a crap ton.
---
I have a good shot at topping Garr too since I can have a ton of uptime on both my pet and my shots but yeah, that's pretty much my experience. Either way I feel like a valuable dps on every fight if not the top and I can still compete with the other hunters which is fun
---
So bad we're top 5 on the faction on a full server despite taking meme specs and no consumables.
---
To be fair layering did alleviate the main problem it was initially targeting: overcrowded starting realms/ massively contested limited spawns with an expected diminishing player base. Layering was never supposed to be the answer for world pvp.
---
You posted on an open forum, if you believe your agenda should only be heard and not discussed, then you are mentally ill.  That's not how any of this works.
---
how do you know they're sending you to a server where the population isn't skewed? aren't they just sending you to lower pop servers?
---
Upvoting for my thicc moonkin boy. 🦉 🦉
---
Then you can wait in excitement. :D
---
I'm on mobile, so can't start looking, sorry.
---
Guilds are... More than just raid fodder. 
---
Its not like a single member of a guild not raiding is going to make your guild "lower on the rankings" or some shit.
---
You ended up better off not being a part of that, honestly
---
You're right, it wouldn't. Removed from post I was confused.
---
Love this build so much lol
---
If youre going to make an empty baseless threat at least get your terms right.  
---
Its Libel when its written.
---
I think when inputting your keybinds use the actual number pad on keyboard, then bind your side mouse buttons to the corresponding num pad #. That way it displays N1,N2 , etc, yet pressing your mouse button will still activate it.
---
sounds solid in theory, but good luck getting a group of people to wait at a flight path for an undisclosed amount of time in hopes of maybe countering a group of gankers, who would likely just move to another path.  
---
Again, I hope I'm wrong, but the mindset of people doing pvp for gear appears to be doing so with the least possible resistance, to the point where my server had people trying to organize cross faction kill trading raids. I'm sure there will be some fun pvp moments, but the ones actually farming for ranks are likely going to be cheesing the system any way they can.
---
Only farming dungeons and raiding now so well see how much phase 2 rapes me then might have to respec again lol
---
No, they just find a new place to work every 6 months
---
It's a global imbalance, there is only a single pvp server where alliance outnumber horde...
---
Solution implies that there is an issue
---
bro why did you kill saurfang, hes just an old orc ;-;
---
Usually if they have a decent connection, yes.
---
Hi, are you dense?
---
My post was always about my opinion. Then you replied to my post, hence joining the discussion about my opinion. 
---
&gt; Nothing has been said about what lowering or increasing the limit would do.
---
Except that that is the implication since they *could* have shipped it without a debuff limit, since they have the technology. So by shipping it with a limit, they are in a sense lowering the limit to 16. 
---
&gt; "Only an idiot would draw that conclusion. The concept of a limit fosters communication and teamwork. Nothing has been said about what lowering or increasing the limit would do."
---
Well there could be a limit of 100, and it would hardly matter. There could be a limit of 25, and it would sort of matter. There absolutely is a sliding scale of how much it matters and how tightly you'd have to control what debuffs go up and honestly you could make the case that 8 is superior to 16 since it would require more care to be taken. I am arguing the opposite, that it's a stupid thing to have to worry about and the game is better with no limit. It's fine if you disagree but stop acting like I'm ridiculous for bringing my opinion into it.
---
I accept that you dislike that I replied to your post about the debuff limit with my opinion.  But when I said "there shouldnt even be a debuff limit imo," **you really shouldn't reply with your own opinion in turn if you don't want to have a conversation about our opinions.**
---
Haha! As a noobie to the game, i started in mid september and this is my first toon, i can understand that. Thanks for all the advise much appreciated.
---
4 extra buttons ia more than enough, and more is a bonus. Make sure the buttons are programmable.
---
Yeah but Blizz not having an answer for WPvP means it didn't matter whether layering did what it was supposed to do or not..And the layering certainly could've been disabled like 6 weeks ago lol
---
Warden staff before mount?
---
It's quite easy to just disregard my experience and assume what I want is a handout. I'd like to find at least one other person to assist with an elite quest. Perhaps someone else also looking to kill the guy for Dark Storms. I said all hours of the day on two seperate characters.
---
probably any ones that are immune to poisons.  Elementals are usually immune to poisons, and lots of bosses in there are elementals.
---
then maybe postpone the transfer? or make a proper announcement ahead of time. Nothing you said cancels out the fact they're just kinda winging things as they go
---
You'll end up getting poly'd if you wait til end of cast since it's 1.5 sec, the latency delay is usually around 60-70% so you'll end up bashing him on arcane and still eat the poly most of the time.
---
Warriors can remove fear with enrage and deathwish...
---
MT gets all T1 and +defense gear for min bid price.
---
I recommend the Razer Naga
---
&gt; Then we'll see how much people love being the massively dominant faction
---
literally everyone hates this. Just slightly less than they hate being the massively dominated faction. You are delusional
---
Does kirtonos have a queue? They aren't offering server switches to servers with bad ratios, they're offering them to over populated servers
---
Found the guy that plays warrior
---
Ashenvale! It's gorgeous and has ton to do. Personally one of my favorite zones. Hillsbrad, especially this week with the release of phase 2, will be flooded with PVP.
---
Varimathras aoe is super op when the server is cripplingly laggy
---
Not sure who a mass exodus would occur. Once server were balance faction wise, the free transfer wouldn't be available anymore.
---
So exodus would occur only until faction aren't balance, and doing so it will also balance another server factions.
---
Oh wow, what an angry gamer. Imagine being this riled up over a keyring, holy smokes.
---
After a good dungeon run ask someone who you think was fun to play with if their guild is recruiting/active/who to talk to if you're interested. Personally I avoid the ones who talk about how big they are and invite people without having run with them.
---
What about Goblin Rocket Helmet and Death ray? I am a warrior myself so I trying to work out how best to kill mages, I usually get destroyed but I am also not great at PVP
---
Haha me too, I've been loving Rogue PvP and this spec is super fun
---
I keep saying this. Otherwise the majority of pvp players would stay flagged from level 1 to 60 and while in capital cities. But it's just not the case.
---
I use "/click actionbar#button#" and assign it to the correct items.
---
I do not have access to my macros right now but they are along the lines of:
---
`/click [nomod] BT4Button43`
---
I started looking at dreamweave equipment, bonuses are a little lower put they apply to all spells, so it seems more versatile.  Not sure though.
---
Give in. Join us. Grob Mob.
---
It looks more like 200 horde vs 45 alliance :))
---
Okay i see what youre saying. Thanks for the info!
---
Onslaught is fury prio unless you’re doing &lt;40min MC, where it becomes fury prot prio
---
Yeah. This happens. It's not a bug. The mobs 'resist' the vanish. Incoming spells and contact with the mobs also breaks the vanish stealth. 
---
Classic isn't retail.
---
Will PvP happen on a pve server?
---
Can confirm. I set mine up in about 3 minutes so I could log into the client from work and enter the queue on launch day.
---
The money excuse doesnt hold up when you consider that private servers were able to offer an exponentially better user experience running off of nothing but donations.  Blizzard could easily fix this.  They choose not to.
---
Thanks so much for sharing this
---
This reads as: I'm a badass, and so can you!
---
Congrats on your bow! 
---
Hate to say it, but we will still be trash in Naxx. I'm already getting outpaced by the melee and mages in my guild and I'm regularly parsing within the top 90th percentile. Hunters simply just don't scale.
---
I disagree. Getting defensive it seems like someone's attacking you isn't "triggered". 
---
If you were pointing out that his raid time was really long and that he should clear faster, I don't think that's a bad thing. If you're calling out his reasoning ("we're casuals so we don't have time to spend less time on this"), I think that's fine. But I think you're being a dickhead about it. And I don't know what you're expecting, but some random dude online isn't going to admit he's wrong, and he's a baddy, and he's a casual piece of shit, so sorry for ever doubting what you're saying, even if you indelibly prove it. Probably he's just going to reply condescendingly and move on. 
---
If you want what you say to be taken seriously, phrase it in a way that folks will be receptive to. If you don't phrase it that way, it'll just seem like you're using your ability at the game to feel superior to others and they'll act the way the other guy did.
---
They were less than 30g on NW-pvp last week, and there were at least 10 at once on AH.
---
That's my friend , we may have done it in the wrong order lol 😂
---
I mean you act like it hasn't caused problems, it definitely has - but it's better than not being able to play at all
---
DK?
---
Shouldnt really tank adds since u can kill before submerge
---
Aggro is the issue. Need to clear all
---
There's two sets of lifts in thunder bluff, plus from the main one there is a direct path with no guards that takes you straight to the leader. You don't even need to run through town or the central totem.
---
wtf your draw distance is like 3x mine what is going on??  i can only see players/mobs up to about 50yds or something
---
Well he specifically said it was a speedrun, so you stack one raid with 20 melee if you can
---
This was the solution I came up with myself as well. They're ranged and are decently easy to take out. Good grinding place for golden pearls and knock out some pet xp at the same time. Def a good place
---
Razor hex. 7 side buttons. I also have the naga but too many buttons and I am unable to hit only one at time. Too close together. Hex is best.
---
You don’t have to want to PVP to acknowledge that the enemy faction being able to kill you adds an element of danger to the world. Azeroth is a predictable theme park without it
---
Why am I doing this?
---
It's pretty simple: it's loads of fun!
---
Also, I've only had good comments coming from people that grouped up with me. I agree that prot paladins are a meme spec if we are talking about raids, but they're quite viable in dungeons, if not preferred to warriors in some encounters. I'm also pretty geared, so I'm not the random paly with questing greens that's trying to pass as a tank (Stockade Pauldrons, Skullflame Shield, Boots of Avoidance, eshkandar's collar, Force of Will, Naglering, Essence of the Pure Flame, etc etc).
---
And anyways, due to the shortage of tanks, it's way easier for me to find a group and it lessens "dungeon queue time". 
---
Additionally, in most endgame dungeons, the trash packs are groups of 3-5 mobs, where paladin tanks shine. When's the last time you've seen a warrior tank do 400+ dps sustained in a dungeon?
---
\+15 agility to weapon and +25 agility to 2-hand weapon. These enchants will make a lot of money when they drop during P3 or P4. Not sure when they release.
---
I don’t get on reddit very often. I literally replied as soon as I got on then, as well as now. If you truly wanted to know you’d look it up :) I already know so I don’t want to waste the time researching it again. Have a good day!
---
You were in a guild not worth your time. Their needs don't fit yours, clearly. Don't fret - there's other great guilds out there that have different perspectives closer aligned to yours.
---
Seconded. Any competent guild looking for raiders will have a well designed post up on their server's Discord listing their guild motto, raid times, positions available, and links to well defined guild rules, attendance, and loot policies. That's what I look for anyway.
---
I haven't heard of that. Everyone in a guild like this is down with running the raid this way. If they weren't they would go and join one of the myriad of other guilds that clear MC in one night without hours of prep.
---
For future reference, our group's healer has been consistently 7-10 levels below us and the current content since Uldaman (now in Strat). We've had no issues, assuming we pull carefully and are cautious of her aggro range. Assuming everyone else is effectively leveled and geared, it really hasn't hindered us at all.
---
I transferred my ally to Heartseeker and honestly stopped playing her because the faction imbalance is so bad. The ratio is at least 10:1, I’m a hardcore PvP player and couldn’t even bring myself to gank horde because of how unfair it seemed.
---
I'm alliance. Almost level 50 now and never thought once i was too outnumbered out in the world. I wish alliance on other servers didnt have to make a fuss about that. I didnt even know it was 60-40 untill you told me. The pvp has been allot of fun and by no means feels like one side has an advantage. Finding groups can take awhile outside of peak hours however. So I would really hope blizz let's some people transfer here as long as alliance and horde both come.
---
But the rattle gang! D:
---
I see you too are a friend of the grummels
---
#GrobMob
---
Yes, that one.
---
What even is his AOE? ive never been on the receiving end of it.
---
Druids weren't even a planned class. They were supposed to have runemasters instead
---
You can start the quest and kill the demons with just the leaf. There are technically 3 quests that all start once you get the leaf: 1 to kill the demons, 1 for the sinew from Onyxia, and 1 for the BoE sinew from the dragonkin in winterspring that provides the epic quiver. Only the Ony sinew and demon kills are needed for the bow and staff.
---
There's no realistic way to reach mount gold in 3ish levels if you have 5 gold right now.  You'd need to either get some miracle boe drops (not reliable) or do something like grind fishing until you have the gold (which means you aren't leveling).
---
Realistically, saving gold for your mount is something you keep in mind from level 1 and focus on in the teens and early 20s.
---
If you want to keep leveling at a decent pace, you'll have to accept that you probably won't have a mount at 40.

Just paste it into the macro-cache.txt file **inside** the character folder of the character you want these on. If you have existing macros just paste after the "END"
---
3-5g/run charges. 3 mage/wl 4 healer 5 melee
---
there is a horde advantage here but not huge by any means. Alliance make up for it trust me.
---
I survived and avoided being in a toxic environment.
---
Can't wait to read this 80-90's fantasy novel!! Love it!
---
Yea, thats what i did, shockadin with the spell power trinkets. If remember correctly I would stack the judgment to 5 stacks, stun, light up like a candle with the trinket (and maybe another CD?), and judge + shock then execute. When i got to R13 gear I could take handle pretty much any 1v2 agaisnt rogues/warriors if they werent high end raid/pvp geared.
---
have you tried any of the presets? they look good
---
Careful. He's a gamer. We don't want an azeroth joker on our hands.
---
That's a super common situation.  They goofed at the launch.  Most of my guild reserved their names on Herod two weeks early, and then had to pick up and move to Skeram on launch day.  
---
And yes, anyone (Horde or otherwise) who tells Alliance players that want to leave a bad situation that they shouldn't because it would be better for more people if they didn't, should be willing to move to a server that needs them to balance the population of another server, because 'the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few', right?  
---
Heartseeker needs more Horde to be more balanced, Stalagg and Skeram need less Horde to be more balanced.  It sucks to stay Alliance on Stalagg/Skeram, it's comfortable for Horde to stay on Stalagg/Skeram.  It's uncomfortable for Horde to move to Heartseeker, but Alliance don't have the option to transfer now, so ball's in the Horde's court.
---
I am playing Elemental Devastation Enh/Ele hybrid and it is a lot of fun but probably not *good*.
---
Information regarding server balance is either outdated or incomplete. My suspicion is that it’s mildly leaning towards Alliance now.
---
I agree with you here. Having these insanely highly populated servers it feels too cluttered and it DOESN'T have a sense of community. 
---
Everyone is replaceable, you the player dont matter. Resources are scarce and world pvp is way more chaotic than it used to be. 
---
This doesnt even remotely feel like vanilla did.
---
Ram usage/total?
---
Are you on an SSD or HDD? How old?
---
pvp servers are the normal servers
---
It def takes getting used too... 12 buttons is a lot and I've fat fingered some for sure. The keys are slanted slightly, kinda making a W shape profile if you look at it from above. That helps tell which column of keys you're on, and rows are pretty easy to tell since it's either top-middle-bottom. I started out using mainly column 1 and 4, and then eventually started using 2 and 3 once I was more comfortable with it.
---
@turbodiesel of biggleworth Ill give you 50g to let me kill you.  PST
---
Only if you flag yourself for it. On PVP servers, Hillsbrad is a 24/7 meat grinder.
---
I too hope those kinds of people stay put but luckily they are not the majority of players out there.
---
You do sound like your whining and no one wants to read another rant about reserving items. If you don’t like it don’t join their group
---
Genius
---
Planning on doing this. Pumping everything into skullflameshield to level and make gold without getting farmed. Currently level 53. Any additional advice for me :) ?
---
You think many people would transfer for one month free? I'm a Horde on Kromcrush and I wouldn't leave for 6 free months.
---
Mine was rolls with loot council as an override for big upgrades, such as weapons for melee or finishing set bonuses.
---
You show up, you get a chance at loot, but it wasn't completely RNG.
---
How to enable scrolling text? What's the best addon for it? Thanks!

EPL has 19 possible spawn locations.  Silithus has 9, WS and BS have 10

This guy gets rejected
---
Just be good looking
---
This is still happening. I know exactly what you are talking about. it seems as though the majority of "warriors" in the comments are not target swapping very quickly and thus don't notice it. This has been annoying me and I'm glad I'm not the only one. Wondering if Bliz is aware.
---
Blackrock. Blackrock will be more of a bloodbath than it already is.

It should be gone today, thats what the blue post said they were doing.

Theyre giving today/tomorrow without the honor system to get things smoothed out without layers and give people a chance to xfer after seeing the shitshow its going to be with no layers.

I built my PC about only a month ago, and everything is new, so that's why I was wondering. I'm running it on an SSD. These are benchmarks I did just yesterday:  [https://www.userbenchmark.com/UserRun/21639426](https://www.userbenchmark.com/UserRun/21639426) 
---
Ram usage is about 5gb/16gb when in-game, can't check it on IF right now, since I'm not logged in and there is a long queue.
---
WHOLESOME 100
---
I mean the farmers.
---
SM Cath, RFD. A bit too early for Uldaman. You can do Ulda around level 43/44.
---
I'm more annoyed that people like you are unable to read. But good going throwing your point out of the window and going full ad hominem.
---
Yeah charge is battle stance and can only be cast out of combat. Intercept is in combat and has a long cooldown berserker stance charge.
---
Obviously situational tactics will apply, but the following order is what I've found to work well for mob packs ranging from 3-5 for general dungeon pulls.  Speaking as a Warrior who leveled as Arms and is currently 31/5/15 Arms/Prot and enjoys tanking 5 man content:
---
Berserker Rage &gt; Battle Stance &gt; Charge &gt; shift to Berserker Stance and pop Bloodrage while charging &gt; Whirlwind &gt; Defensive Stance &gt; Demo Shout &gt; Battle Shout &gt; Sunder-tab-sunder-tab-sunder-tab... &gt; Revenge when available
---
Once you have established threat and have the rage to use, start working shield block in there, too.
---
Loyalty is really fast to get, we're talking a couple of hours max to go from 1-6. Once your level 10 pet is loyalty level 6 feel free to swap around with different types of animal. You'll definitely want to do it a few times to get new ranks of bite/claw/dash/prowl etc anyway.
---
I agree. Ganking is a fun part of the game since it makes the world dangerous. But corpse camping is just...low class.
---
Where do people get their information? It's been stated for days that P2 (honor system and keyring) got pushed to the 14th.  Literally read any type of reliable WOW news source and you can find this out for yourself !!!
---
Enhancement tree is generally considered the best for leveling
---
Wtf is a seal?
---
Any
---
It does through talents. 
---
Say you’re a dagger combat rogue thinking of switching to seal. You take seal and forget you get 5% crit while daggers are in your hands in combat dagger spec. As soon as you go SoF you lose it going from 30% to 25%. 
---
All the other crit stacking talents are taken always because it’s 5% baseline crit. Who doesn’t want 5% baseline crit.
---
I never had a point, mate.
---
From what I've seen, Porches require about 4 parking spaces.
---
I think it is really dumb, but how do you balance raids with out it since all the raids were tuned to account for debuffs falling off and being overwritten by people doing dps.
---
Yes, and that has nothing to do with your weapon choice.
---
its a lose-lose because there is no upside to transferring to an alliance-dominated server as horde.
---
Like can you actually give a reason to do that?
---
Ya, I fucking love these people. We've got an elemental shaman, and he's all shocked that no one wants him to dps in raid and he can't have cloth gear over mages and locks...
---
It's just not possible to camp black lotus the same way you can camp devilsaur.  There will be a lot of black lotus farmers and a lot of pvp over them, but there can't be that level of organization.
---
I’ve had poor experience with guilds that loot funnel people for no other reason then they want loot. Content is not hard right now, you don’t need to go as hard as possible to easily and efficiently clear content. What is important is creating a positive environment for the long haul, in which raiders have fun. And usually a lot of that fun is being rewarding with... yes shiny epics... later on with content getting harder things will change and loot will be going to where it will increase the guilds progress. But right now I’m phase 1 and 2, all the min/maxers who want gear at the huge disadvantage of others can royally fuck off
---
Yo man, you seem knowledgeable and your answers are to the point but not snobby, I like that shit. Question for you; Do you receive DK's for killing an opposing-faction player that is say, 10+ levels below you? Or are all players, "fair game?"
---
An important trick to learn is to force reckoning procs. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq1q7FOnk1c) video is a pretty good showcase, although that specific spot can be a pain when gankers arrive.
---
And try to get Uther's Strength, Demon-Forged Breastplate (with absorption enchant), Flurry Axe. But you might already have those.
---
Except they did lmao, otherwise they wouldn't have been able to turn off layering
---
dude didnt you watch his streams
---
Pass the favour on and tell a hunter you like the time you tamed him. That way they can be in the zone when he spawns next. All hunters in my guild did this and we got 4 consecutive BTs without anyone having to do a long ass 8h camp (except the first guy heh)
---
In 40 people atleast 1 person cares, even in a casual guild. Spk from exp. I really think anyone doing mc more than 3 hrs is crazy. How can you call someone tryhard for completing a small dungeon in over half the amount of time. I dont want to commit 3+ hrs of my life to 1 raid in a week. That sounds horrible and tryhard.
---
🦀 jmods won't respond to this thread 🦀
---
Who recommends hamstring? You? Reducing a mobs armor really does make a difference. If you proc overpower, you stop sundering. You just keep sundering while mob is above 75 hp, or you get overpower.
---
If you play correctly, you will pool rage at the end of one mob and have plenty of rage to put 3-4 sunders on the next mob.
---
The optimal leveling rotation is simmed and proven and it uses sunder armor not hamstringg
---
Im not going tp sit here arhuing with you. Sunder is better than hamstring for leveling. Reducing armor makes a difference. You are just fucking wrong..
---
I can post a detailed simulation proving this. You just made this shit up.
---
We are saving them for our own use, lol.  Will sell them slowly but want to keep the price high.

Yes, that is exactly what OP was driving at in his comment

Idk what it’s called but I had the EXACT same text in wotlk and it was carbonite.
---
Arugal still has layers.
---
Just downloaded this (latest version) and well... It looks nothing like this and it also doesn't track anything. Whenever I do anything I get a LUA error about trying to use a nil value 'farms'. :(
---
Once I got the carapace, it took me another 5-6 hours to get the chest piece, but that's because I already had all the other materials except for the blood. 
---
Frayed Stitching took about 5 Strat UD runs total. 99.9% of groups don't care if you need on it, cuz it drops all the time and isn't used for much. 
---
Blue Chromatic Scales came with time, I ran UBRS enough that I had plenty. I needed on a few, but most of them just came from me and/or guildies winning them. 
---
Chromatic Carapace took 47 runs of Rend, but most of those were actually full UBRS runs because I was farming other gear (Deflector took 27 full runs, for example). 
---
Blood of the Heroes took \~5 hours, with two guildies helping me and me spamming both WPL and EPL zone chats asking for anyone to tell me if they found some. I got several whispers that sped this up. This was a terrible grind honestly, in real time it was pretty short, but for some reason it felt extremely long. Maybe it's because I skipped lunch and I was getting hangry, I'm not sure, but I absolutely hated this part with a passion.
---
I was thinking the same thing; would love the action, but I can't imagine trying to level up with so many organized hit squads running around lol

It's basically a meme saying that OSRS membership is 11 dollars and we still can't get taken care of in regards to customer support, bugs, and many other issues.

That's surprising, I play on a large server, so the market must be large and there's a ton of hunters farming trib. The price is usually 35-40 gold.
---
I know a guy in my guild that paid 80g for a treants bane, the epic axe from the chest.
---
You seem confused.  I genuinely think its hilarious when people who rant and rave tell others to "grow up," as if the adult thing to do is whinge and throw out curse words.
---
As a melee class (warrior), is there any reason to not always have my weapon buffed with a sharpening stone/weight stone?
---
If so, why are there so few of these on the AH and why are they so much?  Does 50s sound right for a Solid Weightstone?  I wouldn't think 1 rock and a peice of runecloth would fetch so much.
---
Feel free to say that, but I raided ele/resto in vanilla. We were not tryhards, and we downed a lot of content. The only thing I didn't get to raid in vanilla was Naxx.
---
The number if bad mages I killed as a warrior with no fap surprised me. I am not even a good warrior but half the time they would nova and stand in melee range. Like why would you let me get free hits rooted. Oh well.
---
My plan is to solo the sceptre at 60.    
---
For orange side bring 2x greater nature pots and pop 1 before fighting noxxious and wait for the CD before engaging then you can pop another mid combat.
---
Haven’t looked into Vyletongue for purple side but I’m sure he’s doable as a lock.
---
You dont need to flask the raid but 150% flask your tanks. Broodlord is one of the hardest hitting bosses period and absolutely brutal to wipe on since you have to redo supression. Chromag you want to go super hard on as well since you have a finite amount of attempts before you run out of sand.
---
It hurts
---
&gt; Honestly there isn't a single mob of any value that isn't camped anymore, even at like 7-8 AM.
---
this is why i moved to a really small server
---
Bearing in my P2 is about to drop, as a level 51 horde warrior, where would be a safe ish place to quest inbetween dungeons?
---
I guess Un'goro is totally out of the question for now.

I hate the new Logitech software.
---
This is some serious BS only letting players reverse transfers when Blizzard makes mistakes.
---
Looks like you only need honored and friendly for those, respectively.
---
SW:P is always more damage per second than corruption.  You would need like a 800 spell power warlock versus like an ungeared shadow priest to bridge the gap.  Nightfall is like 0-3 procs per rag kill, less often on other bosses, and only gives 1 second reduction on shadow bolt's cast (GCD time is 1.5 seconds).

Definantly. Healed as druid at 41. The notion that the healer needs to be of dps lvl to even be considered in a group is a bit illfully placed. While given a bad healer is a bad healer, if you know what ur doing you'll have no problems healing a dungeon under lvled. Even brd can be healed at 51. But gear is definantly important come the high end dungeons when ur under lvled and your group isnt 60s just rushing thru something for a prebis

What can we say except 110 ap is less than 8 dps for hunters.  And you need like more than 4 hunters to make it better than a base spell power corruption debuff.

Quit cher bitchin, the tram is a massive liability and Darnassus is always empty. But I guess to a puny horde mind they'd look impenetrable.
---
Also, the Horde's the mage portals are better placed for defense than the Alliance's.
---
realms were only "overcrowded" because of layering.  whether they layered or not, launch had the same people in start zones fighting for resources
---
transfers because of layering to fix now overcrowded realms and dead realms hasn't worked at all, and the imbalance problems it caused even made it worse
---
yeah I just started using Dominos
---
You've probably outleveled Stonetalon's early quests, but it might be worth checking to see if there are any green quests that you can still take. Greens are fast and easy and still worth your time. You may want to check the quest list on Wowhead. Ashenvale is probably a better bet, and Hillsbrad is the normal go-to right now, but you will face PVP in Hillsbrad.
---
Because they haven’t heard of it, why would they have a clue?
---
That's wild bro. Your PC is way past mine and I get 100+ fps in Classic, maybe 60-80 on retail.
---
To avoid constantly switching specs just stay arms till like 50 tbh, then from there pick your preferred and final spec.
---
In the current raids , you dont take enough damage or get enough rage to spam HS with a weapon as fast as flurry axe. This makes deep woods preferable for a tank in raids.
---
If you tanked in raids, you would know this. But instead your just making shit up.
---
If you grind to friendly with pirates, can you chill around them and heal them while other people try to fight them?  I saw a fellow hordesman killing a timbermaw in Azshara yesterday and I nearly popped a LHW on the furby because that mofo is my friend-- I cancelled it the last second and healed my horde comrade and then cried for my friend.  It got me wondering though if this was an avenue to bother either your own faction or the scummy alliance players.
---
I've never actually made a human character.
---
This, right here. I don't understand how people don't realize this.
---
&gt;You mean players on the stacked faction who would be stuck in the queue? They and their "established connections" can choose to move via the available transfers.
---
This has been proven over and over again to never work. You can't move huge communities without them falling apart and to ask players to take that risk or just not be able to play is unacceptable.
---
&gt;It should not BE comfortable for the stacked faction. They need incentive to take the transfer, otherwise they will not budge.
---
Fuck this bullshit. I didn't fucking choose to be on an unbalanced server, fuck that don't punish totally innocent ***paying customers***.
---
&gt;The point is to create a non-lopsided group of servers. That is the ENTIRE point.
---
And if blizzard can do that without ruining my gaming experience, I'm all for it. Otherwise, they need to just give it up because in the 15 years since vanilla came out their only fix for it was sharding and even now mythic raiding might as well be a horde-only endeavor. 
---
&gt;It is only "lose-lose" if you cannot hack it without being on a ludicrously stacked side.
---
Going from one ludicrously stacked side to a stacked side the other way is a lose-lose.
---
&gt;I doubt that very much. If anyone is quitting it is the minority faction on servers because of the severe imbalance.
---
And I agree blizzard should not do faction-specific transfers and just let the underdogs transfer off to other servers.
---
Oh I didnt realize your statement was only in context to weapon damage dealt per swing I guess. I have both axes and I use flurry axe when I tank. You might get more rage let hit with Deep Woods, but if you miss an auto then you're waiting longer for the rebound swing. I'd rather be swinging faster and with a chance for an additional swing to proc.
---
I've never really understood these TBH. You don't need a ton of extra buttons. Just use the side buttons as modifiers (ctrl/shift) and you instantly whatever 12 keys you've bound for default action bar plus everything else that's handy.
---
Ok. Thanks.
---
Level 24 Warlock ATM. What should my rotation be when leveling? I tend to sic my Voidwalker on one enemy and DoT them with Immolate, Corruption, and Curse of Agony. Then, I take another enemy and only put immolate and corruption on them, and then wand them to death. Should I be using immolate at all?
---
No not literal wings. They are cosmetic pieces that are part of the armor that look like wings.
---
If you never get new pets, you'll never learn new attacks/abilities besides the default Growl ranks and defenses.  
---
You need to train pets that know moves that you can teach other ones.
---
Yeah super healthy, 9 horde guilds compared to 40 ally.
---
&gt; I cant rememer getting in a balanced world pvp fight as far as I can recall.
---
Why on earth would you want such a horrible thing?
---
Yes and no. It requires a client patch because it modifies the UI and some other interctions. Not quite as simple as the enablement of a dungeon hub which technically was in the game since the launch of classic.
---
I have seen 0 BoE epic world drops (Over 30 days played and over 12k kills recorded on world mobs, I farm ALOT). Except I have gotten 2 Forrors Compendium of Dragon Slaying to drop from DME in 100 runs. Both from the hydrospawn boss. It dropped for me last night, I offered to pay out my 2 party members 200g each to pass ( goes for about 600g on my server) they declined. I won the roll. I then proceeded to get 5 arcane crystals and 2 blue sapphires in 4 total runs of DME.
---
3% mount speed is trash, change my mind
---
There's so few on the AH because most people just make those while leveling anyway, and then after that they become useless. The only two level 60 ones that you'll want are Dense and Elemental, so anything lower than that really doesn't get sold very often. 
---
If you're blacksmithing, then yeah use those like candy while leveling. If you're not, then I wouldn't worry about it too much. They're not worth the money you spend, as you noticed yourself. 
---
Once you get 60, Dense/Elemental become the top two, but Elemental will be expensive for probably the duration of classic. I'm currently selling them at 4g each on my server. I don't know what Dense Sharpening Stones go for, but I'd be surprised if it's more than 20-30s considering Dense stone is normally 10-15s. So you can see the price difference between the two. That said, Elemental also outperforms Dense by a massive margin, so for established raiders Elemental is really the only choice if you want to min/max. People only use them for raids tho, don't waste them on dungeons or questing.

You should take a step back and consider how vast not only the PC parts market is, but also how many uses a PC has outside of playing videogames.
---
Also, how big of a commitment is building a PC for you? I have to assume it's a pretty big deal since you're so taken aback. Is it monetary or technical limitations in your case?
---
But even on crowded areas? I have no trouble getting +300fps outside crowded areas, but on places like IF it gets 50-60fps.

It's in the normal options menu. You check scrolling combat text and tick what types of numbers you want to see.

Has nothing to do with being Alliance or Horde lmao. And inb4 "butthurt alliance," you don't know which faction I main.

And there it is, you just proved you don’t know shit about anything. 
---
Meanwhile I’m actually MTing the current raids and know what I’m talking about.
---
You are incredibly incredibly talented. Do you work for blizzard yet?
---
&gt; We thought we were rebels by picking alliance
---
I don't really think anyone though they were rebels for choosing the tropes that had existed for like 50 years in the mainstream/popular consciousness at the time of release.  
---
I think people chose alliance back then *because* the races felt familiar to them. Tauren, UD, orc were all either antagonists or relatively new races from a fantasy perspective, imo, at least to a player-base as wide as WoW that didn't necessarily just consist of hardcore fantasy fans.

dude same. was gonna go on grobb the crew wanted whitemane and here i am solo

2h fury is the best single target dps until phase 3 where dual wield fury overtakes it
---
Are you saying Gnomes are Jews?
---
Macro a send pet and immolate together, dots then engage second with dots -&gt; fear then immolate pet them then 3rd target dots  -&gt; fear repeat until you need to wand them to death
---
1.12 is when cross-realm bgs were added so idk what to tell ya
---
All this goes with a faction queue. Without faction queue they are next to no point.
---
Main reason would be to avoid massive queue.
---
Heck if Blizzard care enough about this they could give more incentive to do a transfer (bop mount for example).
---
This is a moot point though isn't it? You're only competing against the players of the same faction and realm, so everyone has the same limitations.
---
https://youtu.be/rGxaTdzbBR0?t=166 I go over it in this video at the end.

Also get the wand from deadmines it’s pretty good
---
Fire resistance is primarily for tanks. For everyone else it's kinda nice for certain fights (Baron Geddon) but not really required like it is for tanks on Ragnaros.

That said, if you find something with good nature resistance, I'd hold onto that as well for later phases.

Nice. They fixed hunter feigned death

I just reread their "Keyring in the first patch" blue post and I don't see the context you're talking about. I read it as "this is coming in a hotfix patch" but then it never did.
---
They could also just come out and say "oh yeah keyring will/won't be out on Thursday too". That would be nice

I enjoy using immolate but from a Mana efficiency perspective it's not the best. Depends on how you're doing Mana wise.

Not to rag on you, specifically, but this kind of answer drives me crazy.
---
"two mid 50s guildies" &lt;-- That's the actual answer. A single 38/39 warrior and "a few others" were tag alongs.

When you land at a flight point, you are an Honorless Target for 30 seconds. Flight point camping might still happen because you can kill them when they respawn, but it might not be as effective as people think. However, ganking in areas regularly visited by 48+ players will absolutely be popular I bet
---
Did you even read my post?  
---
I know how much rage you get from tanking MC bosses both dual wield and with a shield because I have done it. You don't have enough rage to use flurry axe main hand over deep woods. Its a fact.  
---
Post logs proving otherwise, or just go away because we all know you are full of shit.
---
I honestly couldn’t care if more horde come. Despite gaining 200+ people last night alone. I’m perfectly fine the way it is.
---
I'd think ALL bosses, because the sharpening stones will outperform any poison. 
---
That said, if you don't want to spend the several gold per stone, then really just elementals. Baron Geddon, Garr, and Ragnaros are the only elementals I believe.

I love the quick line up for a photo.. 10/10

Mind flay does not debuff bosses.  Are you using a full group of hunters?  If not, there shouldn't be any hunter's mark and there should be two shadow word: pain if you really care about optimizing your "viable raids."

Have fun being a trash tank and pretending to know things on the internet
---
I’m also on an RP server, I don’t think that our experiences are going to change much at all
---
I suppose we have had different experiences. I had ran tons of dungeons with a melee cleave group the way 60 doing giant AOE pulls. Warrior used a two hand to tank the entire time and only used the shield on bosses like Rend once we got there, and we had no problems. AOE threat was great with an Arms build too, but I suppose this is a fury discussion so maybe it's a little different.
---
Could be we had great damage too with everyone an engineer and using dynamite, so things died before the damage became too much.
---
Mind Flay 100% applies a debuff on bosses.

Why would alliance trade with goblins, they’re our boys Alliance scum. FTH

Huh they're changing game mechanics now that weren't there in vanilla. The slipper slope of changes begins
---
Literally you. 
---
Keep projecting there mate. You got exposed.
---
Hahaha funny
---
I feel like it can be the opposite sometimes lore wise, especially in vanilla. There are a lot of niche, out of the way quests, that are really easy to miss if you don't have them marked to pick up that provide good lore and items/experience to boot. I do agree that it makes it pretty mindless in finding where you need to go for the quests though. Especially some of the interesting ones like the treasure map quest in Tanaris.
---
From what I have seen these big zero raids are the only thing alliance is good at on Grob. Not trying to take the achievement away from anyone this is still an impressive feat of organization!
---
But open world skirmishes are a much different story, and the Horde Grob Mob ain't going anywhere because a few 100 people like to rush Org for a screenshot and then leave once a week. This is anything but oppressive.
---
Doesn't have to matter, it just is what it is.
---
This isn't about me. This is about the OP who said he hadn't built a PC in OVER A DECADE. So it was probably a big deal for him. Big enough that it took the announcement of WoW Classic for him to invest in a new one. Such a huge investment for a game that could run on a toaster. 
---
I'm not even sure what point you're trying to make, here, bud. Do you even have one?
---
I believe you get banned on twitch for streaming yourself stream sniping other twitch streamers - but that's about it yeah.
---
I mean more on the lines of how loot/gear is distributed, raid spots etc. Ive seen a lot of stories where people have missed out on loot that supposedly should have been theres
---
All your talk and you are the one that's wrong bud. You compete against your own faction for standing, next time do some googling before you talk ya fool.
---
Noob question: can you get Elven Tarnished Rings at regular Dire Maul North runs (outside of Tribute runs)?
---
Only ran it once and the tribute loot was some random food item or something.
---
I think you touched on it yourself, there will be less raiding guilds as time goes on, or guilds at different stages of progression, so the demand will shrink. I think most of the places where black lotuses are crazily priced are on servers where prospectors know there's a hardcore raid guild that will need them in future, and might eventually run out of stock and/or buy up the AH when they need them. 
---
On my server, lotuses are similar, but what we're doing is trying to stockpile any flasks when the price of flasks dip. For some reason Titan's Flask had dropped to 45g last week, so we bought some at that price while they were down, but we're not really rushing to stockpile any Lotuses or Flasks. 
---
Also, is the plural of Black Lotus Black Lotii? I wasn't sure.
---
Nah.
---
interguild politics is something you wont really be able to know until you are in the guild and raiding.

&gt; Maybe if blizzard lowered everyone’s view distance substantially it would accommodate for lag.

Lol no was a joke 15 years ago I was in a guild like that.

Any overview in the comments? I can’t open it on my phone for some reason
---
You know what typically happens to the top dogs right? They get neutered.
---
Do you use Shift 1-0? Do you use control 1-0?
---
My elvui uses the s-1 as the symbol for shift 1 so maybe you can get a ui addon to help out.
---
In classic maybe but things will not shift in retail and it irritates me because it was this cycle of the better raiders are on horde so raiders go horde, and those players tend to be the longer lasting subscribers and players. So eventually it gets stacked to the way it is now. 
---
But honestly at some point socially like you said it became weak to be alliance and strong to be horde with all their 3 pixel minotaurs and orcs. I personally love high fantasy which is why I play night elves and orcs and Minotaur are too...basic i guess to me, boring even.
---
Don't use your voidwalker except for quests and scripted events.  Switch to imp or succubus.  Pet attack-&gt;Agony-&gt;Corrupt-&gt;Fear and back pet off, pull another and repeat while first is running.  First mob will be almost dead when fear breaks, send pet back and wand on it til dead.  If DoTs aren't almost killing it, add immolate.  If you aren't already drain tank spec'd, respect at 38.  Check out [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ccxosl/dives_drain_tanking_guide_for_warlock_leveling_in/](Dive's drain tanking) guide, the tldr is Drain life outpaces wands 38+ and you'll almost never need to eat/drink again.
---
To me it's simple, I just do random dungeons with people until I find people I enjoy playing with.
---
Can check to fill in raids for guilds to check if you enjoy how they are doing things.
---
Can you use the default blizz UI with domninos or do you have to just make your own bar setup?
---
Not if your goal is the largest number of happy paying customers. 
---
If it’s a 60/40 faction split on a busy server, and let’s say that the 40% side is touching the queue. 
---
So a full third of the playerbase on the 60% side is in queue. ‘Reroll or transfer’ doesn’t work, people aren’t going to leave their friends. A lot of those people will just quit the game.
---
Meanwhile, negative PvP experiences aka getting ganked are still going to be happening in large numbers. 
---
I don’t imagine that the net number of players killed goes down when factions are more balanced. 
---
So you have a similar number of negative PvP experiences, and now like 20% of your players can’t play the game and are likely to quit.
---
Fuck the Horde, but no we are absolutely not going to use a MAGA parody, ironically used or otherwise, as our rallying cry. We're not Worgen, mate. We have standards.
---
DKP? is it bad that i dont even know what that is.. lol
---
No  however you can set a focus target, and show a focus window. Pretty sure focus window is available in default settings.
---
Read about focus targetting here: https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Focus_target

&gt; Haven’t experienced reduce draw distance in classic.
---
Well, I have.
---
Inbetween dungeons...?
---
Forcing people to use social media platforms is disgusting.
---
They have official forums, they should point to that. Not some third-party parasite.
---
Guilds can be very toxic. I've seen raid leaders rage more than once and get very militant in their approach. The game, although competitive, is supposed to be enjoyable.
---
Find a guild with friendly leadership who aren't bothered by wiping a few times.
---
Run pugs. Eventually you will run into cool people. Add them as friends. Talk to them. That’s how I found my guild who I’ve been playing with for over 10 years now.
---
If you pooled all the horde pvp players and all the alliance pvp players and distributed them equally, every server would be imbalanced to horde advantage. The horde are the many and the need is to not have a dead server. That's just how it is. 
---
Leaving a server and staying on a server are not the same thing and shouldn't be compared equally. I've grown attached to my character whose had the same name this whole time. I've made friends while running instances. I've found a raiding guild that I really enjoy playing with. I have a number of friends in real life who I get to play with as well. Staying requires little sacrifice when compared to the alternative. "Comfortable" is a very cute word that completely undermines the reality of what you're asking people to give up.
---
Lower pop and the opposite faction has &gt;50% pop.
---
But you're going from a server you know you don't like to a server with a currently unknown outcome for most people who transfer. Can't be THAT bad.
---
I use the corsair ironclaw or whatever it is. Used to have the corsair mouse with the keypad at the thumb, but i was always pressing the buttons when i didnt want to. Like pressing a button for an ability when i was flying. Which led to an unexpected death.
---
Server communities are important, and the guilds are important as well. 
---
You can't just throw that away lightly, and you can't pretend that these situations aren't putting some people (including me) between a rock and a hard place.
---
I'd transfer if the server community for Skeram wasn't something I enjoyed. I've made a name for myself on the server, and the friends I made outside of the guild I'm running will be lost unless I go the extra mile to preserve their contact information, and that would mostly be a waste of time, because we'd never be able to play together on those characters.
---
Don't listen to that guy. Generalizing all guilds who use DKP as guilds to avoid is terrible advice.
---
Guilds who let everyone roll on items with no consideration to attendence, performance, etc. are doomed to fail.
---
As long as DKP is transparent there's really no problems with it. Some guilds will do a modified DKP with Loot Council for exceedingly rare drops like Legendary items, weapons, etc.
---
Imag8ne people not enjoying the things you enjoy. My memories of Illidan are what drove me to play on a PVE server this time around. Ain’t got time, nor did I enjoy that shit. 
---
Or does not enjoying being ganked make me a coddled baby now?
---
Except it's not. You need fellow faction mates to get any groups going. World pvp might be dead but not groups for raids, instances, and battleground queues (once p3 hits). Literally only one aspect of it sucks.
---
You’re right, it’s great!
---
Purge too.. Warlocks lose a lot if you purge their shit.  No more demon armor (weapons hit 10-20% harder), get rid of VW shield or nightfall, 3 separate ways to mitigate fear (earth shock, grounding, tremor) plus PVP insignia.  
---
Warlocks are by no means an easy matchup but it's far from a shaman's worst nightmare.
---
So instead of bringing the guards back to their pre-tbc power lvl they instead opt to retail-ify them? 
---
yikes
---
Personally Im all about the purples unless the alternative is significantly better. Those look about equal to me.
---
On the other hand you did put a lot of work into engineering. Might as well use it.
---
DKP is fine if it's managed correctly. Sounds like Alex got a shit guild, so it's not really DKP that was the issue.
---
I tried this.  It was dependent on doing damage to the mob and potentially even tanking it.  Tagged a bunch of mobs and had a friend kill them and most gave me double digit exp rather than the expected hundreds.
---
Get enough people any system can be flooded lol
---
Its the same as finding your dream job, networking while building up your resume
---
I had no idea Onyxia was so short! Interesting
---
Most people just use mods for WA2 from wago.io/classic-weakauras
---
If you try, don't feign death too close to the fire elementals. They pulsate a fire aura that does damage. It knocks my Rogue out of stealth and i imagine it would knock you out of FD.
---
Need so bad
---
Until I rolled my alt, I had not played a Warrior in Classic WoW.  So, after hitting 60 with my Paladin (the class I’ve mained since Vanilla) I leveled a Warrior with the goal of dungeon grinding to learn to tank.  I’m currently mid 30’s and have been enjoying it immensely, but what I learned is that tanking on a Warrior isn’t hard once you’ve spent a couple minutes setting up some macros.  Yes, DPS are impatient and sometimes pull aggro, and yes, sometimes healers are absolutely abysmal, but now having seen what several rough pulls look like from a Warrior’s perspective I can soundly say there are a lot of very incompetent tanks.
---
Absolutely wrong. You struggle to pvp because there is no one to kill. We HARDLY struggle even when we’re out numbered (plenty to kill) and we can easily move locations to find more, you can’t. Sorry but you couldn’t be further from the truth mate.
---
Blizzard: "Here's a list of 5 patches we have planned! Also, the keyring will come in the first patch."
---
Blizzard some time later: "Hey guys, we've decided to pull Dire Maul out of the first patch and release it earlier"
---
Players: "But where's the keyring?!?!"
---
Come on man
---
Don't listen to that guy. He's giving you stupid advice.
---
&gt;it's impossible to win if he gives it 100%
---
That's a pretty amusing statement when he plays a spec that's reliant on Seal of Casino

Is there a place to find pug raids? Nature of my schedule doesn't usually allow me to attend regularly scheduled raids. Have time to play but it doesn't usually coincide with my guild raid times
---
Im loving the steelseries Rival 500.  The button layout is way better than other MMO mice ive seen
---
The things you want to look for are. Leadership, loot rules, activuty, raid times and clear speed. I think leaderships is he most important, if you have a good leaders everything else falls in line. 
---
The more concrete things you can look at are loot rules, you want to find a guild that has loot rules you are okay with and make sure they follow them. I prefer loot council. Then you want to look at the activity, how often people are on and how many show up for raids, preferably you want the guild to field a full raid, but who also has spots open for your class. Final thing to look at would be speed of clearing, you don't need the fastest guild, but it seems preferable to be able to finish MC and Ony in one night.  You also will want to find a guild that can fit your schedule.
---
Even on crowded areas?
---
Im not warlock pro but as a hunter, if see a warlock with his voidwalker out, I dont actively seek to fight them. There is just too much that can go wrong. You can instant sac the void, fear, dot, blast away. You can keep the void, deathcoil, dot, fear, blast away. Having that big shield gives you way more options for how to play it
---
I did that with a druid in vanilla. I enjoyed it a lot
---
The tooltip is wrong. It does have an effect. If you would have had aggro ripped from you when the taunt debuff is up, you actually keep aggro. So if you taunt the mob, and 1 second in a rogue manages to out aggro you, you'll STILL hold aggro for the next 2 seconds.
---
Well the only good alliance is a dead alliance.
---
Probably because not everyone can come to a third party website to defend attacks on their honor.
---
Did they do anything to the safespotting in Winterspring or is that going to be the griefing spot now?
---
I deleted all my keys weeks ago.
---
&gt;How did he even get hand of rag LOL?
---
Unless you want it for the "prestige" HoRag is actually a lot worse than other less rare items like BRE.
---
That's how you read this? Do you have proof that the guards are weaker than they were in vanilla 1.12?
---
Is there someone in charge of tracking the DKP? or is it usually just the guild leader?
---
commence destruction come world pvp day
---
I play on faerlina, 9/10 times its pvp free
---
I play on Faerlina with perfect faction balance so not sure why you're acting like I play on one of these scuffed servers. Glad you're doing well over there tho!
---
Yep. Pretty risky if you are not GM or officer or really tight with guild members.
---
Just look in LookingForGroup chat and trade chat when you're on, that's about the only place you'll find pug raids. Generally speaking everyone will prefer guild raids, so this will probably normally be with guilds that are still building their roster, which means the quality of the runs can vary as well.
---
It's a catch-22.  the open world experience, farming and questing right now can be pretty terrible.   The end game and dungeon content though is pretty good because you can find groups.  
---
If they could do layering and only put world bosses in one of them, or something, maybe open world content wouldn't be so bad.  No clue.
---
when someone talks you are supposed to respond especially if what they are saying is in response to what you have said. It is the most basic of social contracts not responding is the most basic form of assholery. We have insults like asshole specifically for people who can't be bothered with basic societal norms because they feel they are too important for them. You sir are in the wrong and should rethink your actions.
---
It's like non of you read anything about anything ever..
---
Is the DKP usually posted in the guild information? or are you supposed to keep track of it yourself?
---
The only thing that worries me is the stability of the servers. From what I've seen and experienced, most the private servers were able to handle large amounts of players pvping in the same area at a given time. You get 100 people in BRM and its unplayable currently. 
---
Without bgs and honor farming it's definitely worth solo or even small groups to pvp so it might not be that bad but from what I've seen on classic it doesnt look promising.
---
World bosses are going to be a clown fiesta.
---
You can farm Onyxia 2 times a week, pretty much every hunter has a sinew in their bank if they dont have the leaf yet..
---
What addon?
---
Since the beginning, they made a few changes to reduce GM workload(like loot trading in raids).
---
What consumables are you using in a 3h raid that cost 40g? As a hunter I'm using about 15g per MC clear (3 mongoose, 1/2 GFPP - maybe 1 rune). Tend to make about 20g profit from the week's raiding from boss gold - it pays for itself.
---
 How can you see your servers alliance to horde population?
---
Logitech G602, love mine to pieces.
---
It was more like 8-12 hours, but you didn't have to be in the whole thing. You got tons of honor and AV rep and it felt epic.
---
Like i said, u need to be within the level to get EXP of the mob for it to work. A level 20 cant tag for a level 5. But a level 9 can tag for a level 5. 
---
Because a level 9 still gets exp from a level 5 mob, because of that it still gives the full EXP to the guy that tags the mob.
---
So the way to do this is having a bunch of chars at lower levels and relogging all the time, to help the 1 guy that tag the mobs.
---
Why didn't you switch at the first indication of long queues?
---
I was able to play the minute I subscribed because I just switched server instead of waiting those ridiculous queues.
---
The only real consequence would have been losing your reserved names. You decided to stick to it, which is fine, but you made that choice.
---
Layering should already be gone. P2 dropped this morning.
---
The problem is people who complain about bad players. 
---
OP
---
Your the problem
---
If you think there won't be PvE server fights for ranks you're crazy.
---
If you don't get a reply, move on. Unless you just enjoy being petty over a video game.
---
I main tank/off tank all raids. I main tank whenever free for guildies to get BiS. I help for PvP trinket in gurubashi runs. And I craft any cooking or BSmithing anybody needs. So, I think I am doing alright.
---
What is loot council? Is that like DKP?
---
Maybe there was a reason, and he isn't posting it because it paints him or her in a bad light?  There is literally nothing to draw from but a few lines of text posted anonymously
---
 Do you’re saying they are using virtual machines to run wow classic.. 
---
That’s the dumbest thing I’ve read today.
---
Controlled banter, please.  Fucking around in MC is manageable, but if you keep those same habits into bwl and beyond, more wipes and frustrations occur.

Low lvl healing is  very boring imo.
---
Well I have time to fish, 
---
I usually do that when I'm not tanking or healing dungeons
---
Night time I do feralas night snapper fishing but I need to find a fishing for daily trips also so thanks
---
Alliance exodus? All the major servers seem to be horde dominate....
---
You have to walk through a city to get to the tram, and then you have to load in. Super easy to wipe a raid as they do. All it takes is one person in trade giving the warning. Because, you know. You have to walk through a damn city to get there. 
---
Darn port literally puts you into the same room as Tyrande. Thunder bluff port puts you into a cave on a rise, IF port is 100% a better position.
---
We should take all the Classic WoW memes, and put them in a classicwowmemes reddit!
---
I mean it’s literally the most accurate data we have available but nice try
---
It gets more intense later from what I've seen. Spamming hots on everyone different levels of heals different types of heals. What level are you?
---
You could just say LFM full on rogues or LF rdps.  
---
You have options to avoid that.
---
okay ? 
---
when bgs are out ele's are going to sit in the back and pump into people with 2k+ crits .. how's that going to change ? it is really easy to peel melee off an ele not only they can frost shock kite but their self-heal + shield makes them easy to keep alive.
---
That's pretty much the core of it for PvE. Get into raids, make a pvp set and then melt faces on your off nights. Pvp healing is a lot more fun.
---
The massive server sizes already breached #nochanges. They have to do something about it
---
DKP is a point system where you get points for showing up to raid and other things. Loot council is when the guild leaders just decide who gets loot.
---
You're new to the game and late to reaching 60; you are going to end up joining some shitter guilds before you figure out how to raid and what type of guild/raid environment you want.
---
Just join whatever guild will take you on raids and see how it goes without getting too attached at first.
---
Gehennas! I see myself!

As the person that [posted a solution](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d89jks/solution_to_the_gadgetzan_roof_issue_the_same/) to the Gadgetzan problem a month ago, i'm very happy to see that Blizzard found a different solution that is even less invasive to #nochanges than my idea was!
---
Not everybody will be happy about this change, especially because it's a *change*. Think about it this way: If something breaks ToS and every single person that abuses it is under the proper conditions to deserve a temporary ban, why should it exist? If you're against this, give me a reason
---
Cant wait for this I love having extra blacksmith keys to open stuff
---
Priests gets interesting later on with downranking and other small micromechanics, along with healing actually getting more involved 
---
Don't play a paladin if you find the idea of spamming the same heal and jump cancelling boring
---
Yeah my bad, didn't include post the actual link, edited.
---
Focus target isn't in classic, sadly.
---
Just let me faction change my warrior to alliance. Then I can escape the zergfest but still see my guild somewhat.
---
Dont guild hop.  Choose wisely.  Choose based on dungeon pug experience.  I think 3 months is the a solid amount of time to understand what the guild is about, to have a personal impact on others, and people wont think that youre just a guild hopper
---
“Work”
---
Ok the last few census websites i saw were old data, this is news to me, thanks!
---
Yep its a problem. My guess is people would have found a way to bitch or moan regardless. Especially if their server wasn't included. It is Reddit.
---
My guild uses an add-on to track it called Monolith DKP
---
You have Auctioneer and someone typed in guild chat "?[Guardian Stone]". If you link an item with a question mark, anyone with Auctioneer sends the user a whisper automatically with the last sale price they personally saw for that item.
---
Get Auctionator, it's much better.
---
just step forward a cm.  maaybe put a stop cast line in important spells, like an interrupt.
---
Yep,Phase 2,1 layer.

Watching the creep down the charts is kind of depressing! I'm usually 85+ on percentiles and that used to put me on top or top 3 of the actual dps meter for the first few MC clears...a few weeks later top 5...now it's looking a bit sad and getting worse.
---
Curse the warriors and rogues for getting their barbarous blades and daggers.
---
Just like real life
---
Catcalling men always say women are inviting it.  That’s the point.
---
To add on to this, once you find a guild that is picking up pugs to fill the roster they will often save your name and ask you to join future raid too. Though, the expectation is that you will eventually join their guild.
---
pls don't tell people this T.T
---
no lol only like 40% had layering removed, and they were the smaller pop servers...
---
Auctionator doesn't do this, only Auctioneer.
---
Dishonorable kills. So storming a city is pretty much impossible because you will end up killing NPCs. And one kill could literally reset your honor from 8 weeks of grinding 10 hours a day
---
Yeah, can you imagine if wow was run by a company that was completely beholden to Chinese corporate... oh fuck.
---
I have exp blizz enforcing this on mor ethan one occasion. One question I had was what if RL states rules and someone else is ML? or the ML changes during the raid I assume the actual master looter would have to re-state loot rules for this to be enforced?
---
Yeah we use Monolith aswell. Really clear. No complains from any members. What this guy said is a guild problem not a DKP problem
---
Dota 2, Warcraft 3, And WoW are my holy trinity of video games.
---
Yoo leave some pussy for the rest of us
---
And reddit is hardcore.  With a 55/45 "hardcore" split, I could easily see how populations overall should trend towards 50/50.
---
Servers with 80/20 faction splits are a result of piss poor management by Blizzard.
---
okay...but that isn't what we are talking about here. Try to stay on topic?
---
Nelves have fast ghost walk, saves time corpse walking
---

---
quick and easy with least amount of hassle would be to set up default interface to show raid style plates to your liking then get Clique addon to bind your primary heals to mouse buttons. then make mouseover macros for whatever skills are left. then its just a matter of learning where your heals are bound. its easy especially with druid.
---
I would absolutely try get them done before honour system comes in! Get the demons killed and you'll just be a handin away from the bow when you get a sinew.
---
The default on auctioneer is less. Not much less tho. Like 10-15% or something.
---
better? ... well you'll be downranking heal... but 95% of your cast in a MC clear will still be the same heal ( dispell excluded).
---
not that other classes have it much better.
---
Racial balance has seesawed over the years, and often the best PvP faction has been opposite the best PvE faction. When racial parity was reached, the main factor in faction balance became natural network effects: the bigger faction got bigger as more people just wanted to play where their friends were playing.
---
Life long Horde player here. Not even mad. This is amazing. This is also why I love pvp servers
---
Check out the cleavage. Right front row.
---
Fuck I wish you were on our server, we would kill for more hunters, especially people who are actively supporting other players. Also a real life break is totally normal for our group.
---
What if the Alliance just came back to Stalagg? You rolled a PvP server, might as well own your choice.
---
Yeah, Census plus was broken for a while, but it is fixed now.
---
Does that work even in Say or General? 😁
---
Better yet, just take a small step in any direction and it will cancel your cast.
---
Or maybe, the person missed the tell and you should send another?  Or they sit around waiting to see if you just are busy and haven't responded yet?
---
Treat people like you want to be treated.  It's not that hard to not be a dick and save someone a little time.  You're the one seeking out responses.

Baron Fire Res on Tanks?

My guild just started MC and Baron Geddon was tough for us tanks to survive. I'm currently at 42 fire res for this fight and about 6K hp fully buffed. Is this ok to tank Baron, any tips/tricks for tanking Baron?
---
Will be using greater fire prot potions next fight, any other consumables recommendations are appreciated. My gear is listed here: [https://sixtyupgrades.com/character/qogXFZNr4TUMPCGnJ72bhb/set/fUmrLPxf4DHh54cgDBr7cN](https://sixtyupgrades.com/character/qogXFZNr4TUMPCGnJ72bhb/set/fUmrLPxf4DHh54cgDBr7cN).
---
My fav are the mages who nova, cone of cold, then run around spamming arcane explosion.
---
And again, 1/3 of hardcore players havent even dinged 60.  What about the rest of the casuals/less hardcore folks that arent on reddit?  This number is higher.  
---
Phase 2 was rushed.
---
I mean it is pretty obvious what I mean if you were actually reading the conversation. It was about crafting Sulfuras. I am not donating mats or grinding gold/mats to a guild bank unless I know I can get something back. By showing up and tanking for raids I get gear, helping out guildies I get help from them in return. There is a difference in between that and donating 500g worth of mats to a guild bank where you have no control of how jt will be used.

---
What does JROCBABY mean?
---
That's the reason I switched from Netherwind. Got a 32horde druid but it was impossible to find a sm group as tank or healer unless I played at peak server times. But I like playing at night and now on Herod there's sm groups going at 3am.
---
Still causes a delay to your next cast
---
On most Servers it looks like that. Its really annoying, I'm really thinking about transfering to a low-pop server.
---
You are full of crap. Last night alone, my guild has 2 full groups in DM. I am not sure what you are trying to do, but its a disservice to our great community.  We have 9 guilds full clearing MC every week on the horde side and a few pugs. This might not seem like a lot compared to massive servers like Herod, but if you want to run stuff and get geared the option is there. 
---
Ally are not camping org,lol.
---
They’ll be kicking themselves down the line, the finite resources of Vanilla make farming even on lower pop servers frustrating. I couldn’t imagine farming in the open world on any of the High pop realms.
---
Then stop playing it and they will have to fix it.
---
Zeal is 58 and it is, near as makes no difference, the slightest of margins better than Krol overall, however your relying on RNG for procs too so it depends if you want consistency or not.
---
Oh my bad. I didn't know we were using this sub as a blog now
---
As a Horde player on Grobb, it's definitely mostly due to alliance organization.  There is a post on the Grobb subreddit stating that they had been planning this attack since the 7th.  That being said, the alliance have at least 4 super massive guilds that are all very interested in world pvp.  The Horde only have one guild that I'm aware of with more than 2 MC raid clears every week.  They are called Final Boss and are mostly a pve based guild.  In addition to that, a lot of Horde players dont want to group up with final boss players because they're still salty about what was going on in their discord before classic launch.  So while the server population is split fairly evenly, there are a lot more lvl 60s alliance side, and a lot more of the kind of guilds that are pushing 4 MC clears every week.  Horde side is made up of smaller rp guilds and there seems to be more focus on pve than pvp.  A lot of the complaints I hear from other Horde players is that there is no incentive to pvp right now, so I'm hoping things change when the honor system releases on Thursday.
---
Seal Fate is a rogue talent that causes our critical strikes to give a combo point.
---
Daily reminder that you're a retard and classic is being turned into bfa lite one hotfix at a time.
---
Honestly you should have been in a guild while leveling to establish relationships or see if they are even a guild you enjoy. 
---
Now you are just hoping to tag along an established guild or find one that’s building a raid group.
---
Nothing is being ruined, it's making it better
---
"We've got two in our guild" and how long have we all been killing ony?
---
This conversation is about it being realistic to expect anyone to dual-wield them, it's not. It's a lot smarter if a second one drops to give it to someone else as a main-hand.
---
I barely read this to.
---
Some good and logical points, but by transferring to a server like this you are committing to being with that guild for the foreseeable future, which comes with a lot of risks. Who knows what other options you'll have if the guild doesn't end up working out for you in a few weeks/months?

WoW Classic

Fixed a bug that caused creatures such as Solenor the Slayer to misbehave when pursuing the player. Groups of creatures that commit to combat as a group will now all continue to pursue whenever any one of them are struck by a player attack or ability."
---
Huh, I legit used the tactic of hitting one mob in a group and kiting back until the others dropped combat when soloing my warrior. Never knew it was a bug.
---
I thought it scaled upto about 30?
---
good guild by now are done with 5 man...
---
Playing a Priest while leveling is a very dull but smooth experience.
---
Raid healing as a Priest isn't the most exciting experience in the world but playing Whack-A-Mole with Dispell and downranked Flash Heal or playing games of chicken with precasted Greater Heal on the tanks is definitely more involvement than pressing Frostbolt or Shadowbolt repeatedly.
---
I find PvP to be fun as both DPS and/or Healer Priest so if you can make it through to 60 I think it becomes much more enjoyable to play. The only times I've been bored are when most of my group outgears the dungeon but the tank still wants to pull unnecessarily safely.
---
Any warlocks present can randomly banish the adds on the tank to slightly reduce incoming damage after the aggro has been established.

My i5-3550, GT 1030, Samsung 850 Evo, and 12GB of memory handle Classic at 60+ FPS on a 1280x1024 business monitor with a built-in USB hub. Frame rates are capped at 60 because I felt it unnecessary to go higher when I'm already playing at max settings.
---
Would also like to know.
---
Since you are a new player, i may suggest you to stay away from majority of those top speed guilds, you will be on constant pressure playing with them
---
From the available snapshot of data from combat logs, grob appears to be nearly 50/50 population wise. 
---
most likely, a lot of horde were raiding, and even if they weren't, hard to organize and repel 5 guilds worth of raid parties at any given city.

All the reasons I picked the class, as well as never having to deal with threat issues. If I wanted to be some ignite bitch or warrior#27 competing for gear then yeah it would be fun to top damage, but I want to chill with the lads and enjoy raids with a unique role...while getting easy gear, wearing full tier sets and crushing solo content. 
---
It's not as if any class is hard to play, but the hunter rotation and keeping a very fragile pet safe from aoe on bosses is a lot more satisfying to do right than pressing 35 frostbolts in a row!

I can assure you that the high pop well balanced servers do not want any transfers coming into them at this time. The only thing that can happen is more overcrowding and messed up balanced from all these scuffed servers. Reroll your character if you want to play on a good server
---
Shaman have three distinct specs. You can be a healer, caster DPS, or melee DPS. Many people prefer leveling as a melee DPS because you are better able to kill things when you're solo questing and you don't have to sit and drink as often.
---
Only works with people in your guild as far as I can tell.  You can whisper individual guildies to avoid getting multiple tells if you know of someone with a lot of scans.
---
At least wow has customer support. Might be a slow response time but they are usually very helpful in my experience.
---
You only get Jagex support if you're a streamer or your sob story hits the front page of the osrs subreddit
---
As of yesterday only 3 EST servers were still layered. 
---
Incendius, Herod, and Faerlina.

I'm on Incendius and it should he a proper shit-show trying to mine thorium tonight.

Dont worry about it.  Some humans have not gained the wisdom to know that its ok for others to enjoy different walks of life.  Some people see the world in black and white, good vs evil... thats just how they were raised, and its tough to breakdown your mental processes that hinder your growth and understanding of how we should treat eachother.  Some humans want everyone to think like they do, act and play like they do, because to them, there is no other choice.  And thats not the kind of world i want to live in, let alone game in and spend my free time in.  The world is a much more beautiful place when others dont try to control your thoughts, and instead help and nurture the aspirations of the fellow man

I picked Grobbulus because I used to play Emerald Dream back in the day. I remade my same character, and it’s honestly been everything I’d hoped for.

You’re missing my point, which is that I feel this game is great. Each phase represents a slice of a whole and I am concerned that the experience contained within each (phase 1 being the first) being something that is fleeting. My concern being, will we get to experience the phase 1 slice ever again? Who knows, but I’m trying to begin a conversation about that specific idea. If you still don’t get what I’m trying to convey, clearly there is a language barrier here, or you genuinely don’t care.

When AV first came out, you could login and play for 12 hours, logout, sleep, go to work, come home, log back in, and the same AV would still be running.
---
Things of note:
---
- 35% of players surveyed have not reached lvl 60 yet. 20% have yet to reach 51+. Considering visitors to this sub are likely to be more active than the average player, this is a surprisingly high figure. 
---
- Just over half of players at lvl60 have their epic mount. Lot of people struggling with that gold grind.
---
- 945 people here have 2 characters to level 60. Jesus fellas, chill out!
---
- 80% of people rolled on a PvP server ... yet only 9% say their guild's main purpose is PvP. Probably doesnt mean much since organized PvP doesnt exist yet, and you dont really need a guild to PvP, but I thought this was interesting ... as in the old days, guilds are still being used almost solely for PvE/social purposes.
---
- Only 14.5% had a negative opinion of Dire Maul's early release. Now that everyone has seen it for what it is - just another lvl 60 dungeon, not a tier above them - it seems the backlash has settled.
---
- Very split on phase 2 release. This is kind of surprising, considering phase 2 doesn't add any major PvE content (world bosses are going to be a smaller factor in the game than people think as they are just once a week and likely be dominated by 2-3 guilds ... they will frequently be killed before most players even learn that they have spawned)
---
- 50% have killed Ony, 45% have cleared MC. That's a LOT ... like a LOOOOT. Considering only 65% have reached lvl 60, that means 75-80% of ALL players at lvl 60 have cleared all end game content within 2 months.... keep in mind that after 5 months in Vanilla that figure was 0%.
---
- 80% rolled on a PvP server ... but of the few things coming in phase 2, only 55% are most interested in the release of the PvP system. This is odd.
---
Wow, you just made my day.
---
I don't know about NA but in EU the majority of the servers were still layered a few days ago.
---
We have over a decade of evidence, people don't transfer off high pop servers to go elsewhere.  People are actually willing to pay to go to high pop servers and it makes sense.  Why sit on a smaller pop server which might die and make everything harder?
---
Everyone complaining about this shit is ignoring the 14 years of evidence which says the players simply won't transfer away from big servers.
---
The issue is that hunters scale linearly, we get a lot of attack power and..... not much else. We are also extremely limited on what weapons we can use in the endgame. 
---
Rhok, and then just Ashjurethul until Kel Thuzad. Not much going for us there. 
---
If Aimed Shot and Arcane Shot didn't share cooldowns, it would be better, and if we had steady shot it would be even moreso. 
---
We can be bad in Classic, because come BC and Wrath, we are amazing throughout both of those expacs.
---
Yikes.
---
ok well im still waiting you dumbass. and as far as "testing in game myself" ive mained mage for 15 years and was warlord in vanilla.

It matters because you have a floor of 15 kills to get any honor.  Then if you distribute 50 players vs 150, random distribution due to luck/skill/server hiccups means that from week to week, you can have huge variances in how you rank.  The pvp system is high dependent on consistency.  If you fluctuate between top 1% and top 5% because of the variance inherent in a low sample size, you'll never make R13.
---
Battlegrounds will make this all moot as you can grind that from R0 to R14 without leaving the city.
---
When you have to hunt for pvp kills, you are going to have a longer time to rank up due to simple randomness.  Contrast that to the opposite faction who can get honor whenever they choose.  Their variance will be smoothed out because of the supply.  Which will directly influence your honor grind as any 1v1 could be rapidly lopsided depending on how fast they gear vs you.
---
Look at a dice roll.  The smaller the faction you are hunting in relation to you, the fewer sides you get.  You will get long strings of the same number.  With a larger die, you can still get strings but they are fewer and rarer.
---
PvP ranks are dictated by percentages.  The smaller the pool of killed players, the more swing you'll have in your outcome.  If you get 50 kills and your buddy gets 45, all equal, you gained 5% more honor than he did.  This is an easy variance for a week.  But the problem shows up when you look at the buckets of honor.  If everyone else got 50 kills, your buddy is now much lower in the rankings while you are in the top percentile.  And because of decay, you'll gain ranks faster than him, simply because he missed 5 kills.  If we change to 100 and 95, your difference is 2.5%.
---
The situation isn't all doom and gloom but those who are seriously looking at a run for R13 and R14 have put in a lot of thought into whether a small opposite faction will be viable for reaching R14 before phase 3.
---
Slippery slope is a logical fallacy meaning that it invalidates a logical claim made using such an argument, but as a sort of probabilistic argument, as in, if we allow any changes, it will increase the likelihood of changes in the future, it’s not invalid. If you say it will *necessarily* lead to changes in the future, that would be incorrect.
---
Extra effort on your low effort. Well done.
---
I'd argue that most tanks won't be using 8 pieces of might, which will make this the overall BiS chestpiece. It's the only chestpiece that's on both the threat and mitigation BiS lists, at number 3 and number 2 respectively, and it's tied with Breastplate of Might for fire resistance set, which makes it by far the best all-purpose chest piece. 
---
The reason you won't see many 8 piece Might sets is just because of the T2 pieces. Most tanks will be using Onslaught Girdle at a minimum over the Belt of Might, for the hit chance. At that point you're free to replace some other pieces, and most are going to immediately replace the Bracers with Wristguards of Trueflight for additional hit chance, and finally the chest piece for the extra offensive stats over Might. Since the 5 set bonus isn't very good, then tanks are still free to also replace Helm/Legs with T2 options, which really only leaves tanks with the 3 piece set from Shoulders, Feet, and Gloves, all of which don't really have any competition at all for their slots.
---
This shit post is to spicy for my taste.
---
well.. in my current situation i don't need anything from the dungeons so i like grinding at my own pace in a beautiful zone. i will dip into a dungeon once in a while though.
---
Okay - so you rather have fucked caster gear for 6 more months? They didn’t even start at 1.0 game launch. They started at 1.12. It’s going to be a faster time like. I took less than 10 days played to hit 60. Have a wife/kid/ long commute. Out the time in.
---
A simple “told ya so” would have sufficed, dang bro
---
What about horde WF totem?
---
This is the real killer app.  Can this addon do this?
---
Then there's me who kited a dragon on top of a group of horde doing the chicken escort. Sadly, it didn't do any AoE, so it ignored them.
---
If enough transfer, both servers go 50/50. That is solving the problem.
---
can you post the logs?

Nope. So it really should work, but maybe there's some factor involved we don't yet know about...
---
Author appears to have given up trying to fix it and just abandoned it.
---
I’ve never played Alliance :( but I’ve always lowkey wanted a Human, or maybe Night Elf. Sucks how you can’t roll 2 factions on a PvP server in classic.
---
Cool my point still stands.
---
Imagine sitting on your realm 2 years down the line. Either faction balance will be abysmal or the realm will be more or less dead. Streamer servers won't have that issue. Additionally, none of the streamer guilds are actually good enough to be competetive in the open world. Asmons guild won't be getting the world boss kills.
---
I had one try and blizzard me. He managed to pull a few extra friend to help me out. 
---
Havent seen the arcane explosion spam yet. Sounds fun though.
---
You're not understanding me. Mages spam one button, moonkins spam one button. If you're 'okay' with that kind of rotation WHY do moonkin at all since you could play a mage or lock and spam 1 button and do more damage
---
You can probably find a guide to explain this all in detail on YouTube but I’ll give you a few quick tips. Your +healing is what makes down ranking spells viable. Any spell learned at level 20 or higher gets the full +healing bonus,  spells under level 20 have a reduced benefit. As a resto shaman I am mainly spamming rank 1 chain heal in raids, which is learned at level 20. I only use Max rank chain heal in a heavy damage but short fight. Even when tank healing I only use rank 5 or 6 for my main heal, I only use rank 9 as an oh shit heal with nature’s swiftness. Max rank spells heal for a lot but cost a lot, most of the time your raid members will only need healed for a 1000 hp or less so use a down ranked heal. Hope this helped!
---
Nice?
---
Meh... other than raiding cities Horde has had a lot of raids camping black rock mountain and taking over smaller alliance cities. I will admit Alliance seems more organized but.... the Horde has a lot of numbers and players willing to fight as well. It's about 50/50 everytime you go to Blackrock as to who owns it at the moment.
---
Been playing Vanilla WoW for 5 years now, never had problems with loot council over the "why'd he get it, I think I deserve it more"
---
Guilds that gear officers when they are putting in the most work and are the top performers is fine, that's what the system is for.
---
Guilds that gear bad players because theyre buddies or part of some in-crowd are the ones ya gotta avoid, but just notice that early and find a good guild not a sketchy one.

The one I use with that font as the default is called NiceDamage.

Sure, I was just mentioning it because he said he has seen none. RNG is RNG.
---
It happens to all of us do not fret friend.
---
That's a lot of assumptions being made that certain variables will tip in your favor for negligible benefit.

I don't see how a percentage based system would be likely to skew in any direction based on which side of the outnumbered faction you are on.

Try your server's Discord

Why? They run in Amazon cloud and all servers are virtual in these days. There's nothing wrong about it being virtual, they just aren't allocating enough resources for it.
---
&gt; It's very simple to dissect a dps meter and figure out optimization techniques.
---
You can do the same for healers if you understand the class, the fight, group/raid makeup, etc. There are absolutely ways to optimize and things people do that are not.
---
what's this tooltip addon?
---
I ran in with a Hunter who had already completed the run and we could get all the way to the chest without killing anything.  
---
Only issue was right before the big ramp up there was one guard/mob where we had to time it and drink an invisibility potion to get past.  Guessing that might be the guard you guys killed maybe.

That’s how I came on my Rod.

Your link you provided doesn't work for me, so not sure what gear you have. 42 fire res seems low, but I know a lot of people have different opinions on how much fire res is necessary to tank in MC, and since I'm not raiding yet in Classic I'm trying to remember stuff from tanking back in the vanilla retail days. So might be fuzzy on the details or forgetting stuff.
---
What I used to have when my guild was first clearing MC was essentially three gear sets (not full sets, but three programmed sets in a gear addon). One was full physical tanking, one was full fire res (for the Rag fight), and one was a mix of both, for fights like Baron Geddon or Onyxia. The mix set was stuff like the drac deflector, any Might pieces, some better pieces from the dark iron set, Onyxia necklaces, and an + stamina Emberplate Armguards (I ran BRD so much I carried multiple Emberplate Armguards).
---
I was Alliance then, so I had the paladin aura to help, but if I'm remembering correctly even my mixed-set still had more than 42 fire res unbuffed. 6k health should be plenty high.
---
Definantly join "lookingforgroup" and "world" chat channels.. Depending on ur server the World channel might not be as highly used but def the lfg channel
---
Loot council is GM and officers, deciding who to give the item to, to most utilize the benefit of the raid. Someone who had 5 piece t1 may get a tier piece over someone new who has none, because the raider is proven, a top dps/healer/main tank, and the tier set piece bonus being completed is more valuable than a trial member who just hit 60 given their BiS.
---
Yep, trading one set of harmful chemicals for other harmful chemicals is a legit, and modern approach to solve everything.  Always present (in)correct solutions looking for problems!

---
Still not insane in the membrane? Casual.
---
You shouldn't need any FR to tank Geddon. Are you sure you're dying because you're taking too many hits and not because your healers are losing too much mana to his debuff or your raid is in some form of general chaos that's stopping your healers from doing their jobs?
---
No clue what this other guy is talking about, thrash blade is absolutely not better than sword of zeal. Whether its worth it to you is another question -- with good armor and thrash you can do fine dps, but if you want to be trying to do as much dps as you can, you want zeal krol or dalrends, and at 240g id take zeal.

Consider that we are on patch 1.12 where all the nerfs of raids have already been applied. I think this is why end game content is so easy. Also people know what they are doing this time around.
---
People are constantly doing it.  If you’re casually questing in HL you should have no trouble finding a group.
---
Can you chain sap/poly/mind control until Honorless Target wears off?
---
yea thats what i asked, waiting to hear back from him thanks.
---
If you want loot, start your own guild or raids and loot council it to yourself. 
---
Or else you're gonna need to find a PUG that free rolls everything
---
I disagree with other comments here to an extent. I was parsing 95-99 percentile as resto before I switched to feral when our raid got more geared, and naturally, needed less healers. 
---
Your spell use depends largely on the boss fight length, your gear, your spec, and the other healers ability. During the time I healed, it was in the first 10 days to 45 days of release, so I didn’t have perfect gear for much of it. Because of this I went moonglow. I believe I ran 24/0/27. 
---
My spell usage consisted of such - 
---
Rejuvenation - rank 4/8 
---
- Don’t use rejuvenate very often, only if you HAVE to be moving to avoid damage and you have to stay actively healing. I often use rank 4 to top off melee or ranged whilst having to move around 
---
Regrowth - Rank 4 or 5/Max 
---
- I suggest almost never using this if your gear isn’t polished or your raid is slow, the only time it’s necessary imo, is if a tank NEEDS a fast heal to save them. In situations that aren’t obviously dire, or if you just need to mitigate healing requirements for incoming damage, just use rank 4 for the HoT. 
---
Healing touch - rank 4/8 ( max rank ONLY for nature’s swiftness oh shit macro ) 
---
- This will be 90% of your healing. Spam rank 4 like a motherfucker. Rank 8 is only really for pre-casting when a tank is about to take a LOT of damage, like Ragnaros hammer. 
---
If you manage to get better gear, or if your raid kills stuff fast, like sub 90 seconds, your spell usage / spec will be very different. Though, that probably won’t be a concern for you for a while. Hope this helps.
---
Ah, I see. Is there any way to combine the two battlenet accounts? Or nvm, Ill google instead of taking up your time ;)
---
Rogues have no counter in 1v1. There is no 1v1 situation that a rogue can not theoretically deal with.
---
Blizzard had to literally remove the Rogues full capacity to stun lock in order to make their dueling tournament fair.
---
You can get by with 5 Manning rend runs pretty easily as long as you kill summoners first and just take it pack by pack. It's a very easy instance. Past rend you absolutely need more people. A normal 5 man setup is the fastest for me when I do rend runs
---
huh, now that you say it...I actually remember that from back in the day but holy crap I haven't heard anyone I've played with bring it up. Thanks
---
I've had the same pig since lvl 10 I just tamed other pets to teach him high lvl bite and charge.

Shadow priest...if u just wanna own in pvp in general
---
The starting zones on my realm and many others still have a few players going around, obviously not as much as launch because everyone was new then. Lately I’ve been noticing the capital cities have been super populated, sometimes to the point of even being laggy. I’m glad this game isn’t dead and I hope it stays alive for a good while.
---
oh ok so i really shouldnt be expecting much loot from a guild that operates like this if im just joining then huh lol
---
can confirm whitemane PST was layered until the maintenance this morning as well
---
Lmao, respecced for a meme
---
For Alliance side, there's also the Winterspring Frostsaber. It requires a LOT of killing in the Winterfall Village, which means that you're basically guaranteed exalted with Timbermaw by the time you're done Winterspring Frostsaber.
---
I've been chipping away at the mount rep when I can, saving the beads until I'm revered with Timbermaw.
---
&gt;80% rolled on a PvP server ... but of the few things coming in phase 2, only 55% are most interested in the release of the PvP system. This is odd.
---
I don't want to scare Ally off our server while there are still free transfers. I would much rather have the PvP system release alongside battlegrounds to mitigate the effects of the upcoming P2 shitstorm.
---
I think the main takeaway is that the very high selection rate for PvP servers was not actually an indicator of what people are playing Classic for. It was easy to assume that a huge number of players were most looking forward to PvP based on that 80% figure ... but if only 55% are interested in the PvP system's release, especially for such a small patch, then there are far fewer players here for the PvP than I had thought.
---
Is there somewhere I can buy this in a large(ish) print? I LOVE this
---
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
---
Got the +40 shadow wrath one for 90 gold off the AH. I'm starting to value stamina more than pure SP though. You cant dps if you're dead.
---
If they use DKP join ASAP because they usually don't let you accrue any for your PuG time.
---
*second max xp record
---
I guess I could also activate a third account, if I don't mind the cost...
---
Do they have less servers or is there simply just more EU players?
---
People generally prefer faster weapons because they are less punishing/risky, but on average AotDW will generate more rage because it's gonna do more damage.
---
I do fine :)
---
I feel like they used to sell really well during Classic. I wonder if Blizz's current pet diarrhea in retail has kind of killed people's attitude towards them.
---
I know it has for me. I used to collect them, but when they just flooded the game with them I lost interest.
---
&gt;Problem is blizzard hasn't even made transfers to our server available. 
---
Yes they did. I came here from thalnos as soon as it was available to transfer
---
Frost bolt is the mage icon.
---
I was part of the UC raid. There was 3 things that I noticed kept hurting us badly. 
---
Varimathas would do a mass shadowbolt volley that hit for 1-2k.
---
One of the PvP vendors in the room would do a whirlwind that hit for around 1.5k
---
And a mass fear, which I'm not sure which npc was casting that.
---
lol nice rag dps tho
---
It's actually been a fantastic server to play on so far.
---
What? Ret pallies were insane in WotLK. Not even just the pre patch when they were literally raid bosses. Ret was a very solid PvP spec in LK.
---
You do utterly terribly. 275 dps ... I think I could do 275 dps without pressing a single button.
---
55 is lowest
---
“Pfft to all this hunter is unviable in naxx blahblahblah” lol see you on the naxx dps meters huntard, then again maybe not
---
To me that honestly isnt surprising. I played a full PvP server from late vanilla to end of WotLK and to me it always felt pvp is an afterthought to the majority of players and even Blizzard.
---
&gt; Meanwhile I’m actually MTing the current raids and know what I’m talking about.
---
Can you show us your logs so I can see you chain casting heroic strike since you're just swimming in rage?
---
I dont think a gfpp is too useful, it would be gone so fast as a tank.
---
Honestly it just sounds like your healers need to step it up.
---
I like the way my guild does it. Allow bidding. If it isnt all that wanted, someone gets it for cheap. Nobody willing to even bid 1 boss worth of dkp on it? Ok, anyone who wants it can roll. If it gers disenchanted aftee that, then it wasnt an upgrade for anyone, anyway.
---
I mean yeah if you want oneshots, but you still do tons of damage with no crits.
---
Guilds that shard items that are upgrades because it's not the item everyone is saving for is more likely to wipe in AQ and naxx
---
Is layering removed from normal wow bfa?
---
Dual wield tanking is really not good advice unless you are over leveled or overgeared for the content. Shields mitigate a significant amount of damage, and your healers manapool is the main limiting factor if your are doing difficult content.
---
yep. i am also having the same issue. please let me know if you figure anything out
---
Maybe its because my server is huge (Fairbanks) but MC Cores are only 8-10g but 40 DIO sells for like 20-30g maybe? 
---
If its the same for you, you could have mined half as much or by selling it and buy cores.
---
its equal but the playerbase is much different.  Ally dominate the server tbh and the horde do nothing what so ever.
---
I can not fucking wait for Thai damn key ring!!!!
---
The logs are accurate and they even show you wearing BRE for the fight. You did 275 DPS on Mag with a BRE. Facts.
---
Just because you top DPS with sweeping strikes on a cleave boss in a raid full of garbage players doesnt mean anything. Your DPS is terrible and single target DPS matters much more than cleave.
---
If I did a 35% parse with a BRE, I would legit quit the game. That is so terribly bad.
---
There's literally no reason a tank would run strat live other than orbs though
---
I know the feeling! It's the worst.
---
BRD - Arena/Anger/Golem at 52. Full runs at 54.
---
Once you get around 57/58ish, you can get into any dungeon. You won't be able to 5-man UBRS without good gear but that's the only exception, people usually try to 10m the latter half of UBRS anyways (But you can 5man it with a good geared group)
---
If you're healing, you can sneak in a bit early level-wise. Usually a level or two lower, maybe even more if the group is carrying you since their incoming damage will inversely be lower. 
---
Dire Maul / BRD are kinda on the low-end, so those may be good ones to start off with. BRD in particular is pretty straight forward and will teach good dungeon habits (line of sight, skipping trash, focusing healers / aoe trash, etc)
---
Go shadow, stay shadow. Healing is super easy and boring.
---
Who casts in melee range lol.
---
Yeah like I said it was weird. They didnt tell me anything til I got into Blackrock mountain. And that's already a lot of my time just to get there.
---
Yeah I don't think it's unfair to suggest it could lead to similar small changes like this, but I've seen the argument a million times on this sub that if Blizzard starts making even the smallest of changes it's going to inevitably lead to their precious warrior getting nerfed a bit.
---
How much crit does Seal Fate require?
---
Nice. Thanks for the clarification
---
They transferred from 40/60 servers to a 80/20 server. 100% their fault lol.

its just automatically added onto your interface, no special quest or anything to get one.
---
Not all guilds are like that.  Count yourself lucky that you found out this early and just find a better group.
---
Yeah it’s really cool how people are recreating the iconic battle ground brawl that was Tarren Mill vs Southshore.
---
Is there anything else that they’ll be taking from BFA to put in classic?
---
Good job, filthy alliance.
---

---
You just got charged, and novaed, he fapped. You are in melee range.
---
&gt;   Cleave, once you draw the mobs away from cc'ed mobs.
---
This is going to put you on the fast track to rage starvation. Dropping one sunder each on two targets is a controllable, faster way to generate more threat for less rage
---
Dont need flasks for current content though.
---
Sounds like a crap guild. You're better off without them. One raid missed is no big, and not talking to people? You can do better.
---
I wanted to because a real life friend was horde.
---
Brother really didn’t want to roll horde again so we are alliance.
---
Sorry man,  level 23 and already smashing everyone I can.
---
Not at first, usually, at least. The guild only gets so many drops per week from the raid. It is critical that the gear earned by the guild is kept within the guild. A new person isn't as invested yet and nothing says they won't leave as quick as they came. Participate on guild dungeon runs even if you don't need much or anything, help with garming, etc to show that you are willing to invest in the guild and they will in turn invest in you.
---
This isn't 100% the case, incendius has been 2 layers til the end and it's only 80-90g versus servers like skeram with smaller population (but a larger competitive raiding population) where BL is over 100g consistently 
---
I agree it usually is correlating to server pop, but even more so I think it's correlating to the amount of guilds on that server/faction pushing speedruns and top parses
---
You can perform a simple test before transferring to see if you have a taste for it or not.   If you have an acquaintance that has a car, meet-up with them in a large empty parking lot.  Now, place 3-4 random items around the parking lot, this can be anything; empty cans etc, to simulate objects for you to obtain.   
---
Now you start walking around the parking lot picking up these objectives.  While you're doing this, have your friend drive the car around at around 10-15 MPH and when they get close to you open up the car door so that it hits you.  Rinse and repeat until you say you've had enough.
---
Are you standing in the Inferno? With that kind of Fire Res, you'll need to move out of the AoE if you want to survive. Other than that you should be fine. 
---
Greater fire protection potions are a nice buffer, but if you're standing in the inferno that's basically nothing, so won't really prevent a wipe. 
---
Also, as the OT, I actually don't stack with the MT on Baron. My damage isn't going to make or break the fight, so I'm basically standing with the ranged and just always being ready to pick up Baron if the MT goes down for whatever reason.
---
I thought that was a newish bug when sometimes you wouldn't actually loose agro.
---
dont bother with these guys... bunch of pseudo intellectuals who want to act like they are the one who holds the key to true knowledge...

Exactly... I'll wait here while you look up the definition to exodus
---
\&gt; Do you remember the first time you created a human character and started leveling?
---
No. Definitely not. No.
---
What are the best T1 pieces for priests that are worth actually getting from MC? Like chest is garbage since I can get the truefaith and head is garbage too since we can get T2 helmet from ony so which ones will give you a nice set bonus or be worth using to go in to BWL when it launches as optimal as possible?
---
No that's not because.  My server was the same if not busier on both of the layers on Whitemane for alliance.  Can only imagine what it's like for horde where 65% of the classic population is.
---
Yessir
---
No one will go there with dk :/
---
Consider each of the \[ xxx \] blocks to be a "condition". The first block that the condition is filled for will be used. You current implementation will not ever cast Rank 1 on mouseover.  
---
You need modifiers on all of the conditions. You will pass the 255 character limit using 3 ranks.

I thought about doing that, but my original timeline had me collecting until November 24.
---
I play my warrior with a shield equipped. Get at least one whisper or invite to a 5man every few days. Play literally any other class, no invites. I think the answer is clear.
---
Are you saying they can't be?
---
Basement dwellers' power trip =gm
---
I think no one, including Blizz, had an idea of what to do. Other than sharding. Which Classic players had 0 wish to see implemented (for valid reasons).
---
No matter what they did or didn't do, people were gonna bitch.
---
Do you play in "fullscreen windowed"?
---
So loot council. The only negative I find with not spreading loot out is retaining members. Of course there will be frustrated players who gquit, or cause drama because they didn't get the loot this week again like they think they deserved. (Mcconnell)
---
But what I hate the most is the fully geared raider who doesnt raid anymore, or wants to hear his alt now because they're completely in BiS, or it's not fun because they get no loot rewards. It's just a chore to them. You get them geared out and then they dont raid anymore.
---
If younspresd it out, those geared players stick around for that last piece, and frustrated loot minded players dont get frustrated and leave
---
I'll add ....
---
Healing touch rank 3-4 should be your normal heals. With lots of +healing, you usually spam rank 3, with less +healing, you usually spam rank 4. I'm not sure where +250 healing falls in that, so try out both. Just spam and if your target gets maxed out (by someone else), cancel your cast (by moving slightly) and recast.
---
Healing touch 6-7 is your "dps they took a big hit" button, for when you don't expect them to take another hit in the next 3 seconds.
---
Nature's swiftness to max rank healing touch is your "oh crap tank is about to die" button.
---
Max rank regrowth is your "oh crap" button when nature's swiftness is on cooldown. Follow up with a max rank healing tough, but chances are, if the tank is in that bad of shape, another healer (or two) will have tossed their "oh crap" heal as well.
---
Unlike the other guy, I don't downrank regrowth, I always cast max rank regrowth (or rejuv), as it's my "oh crap" button.
---
They might not be that hardcore so, because i work full time and just play when my kid goes to sleep, so it's like 2\~3 hours/day max and dinged 60 like 10 days ago
---
Sword rogue here
---
I finally got my Dal MH after tons of runs so I too considered Sword of Zeal. It runs for about 140g on my server (Krol Blade around 300g)
---
I could not find any consensus on Sword of Zeal being better. Spreadsheets had it ranging from about the same to slightly better on average, not many seemed to think it was substantially better in any way
---
My take is keep saving for your epic mount and keep farming UBRS. If you somehow get super bad luck and nothings dropping, you can always watch for a Krol Blade on sale
---
I've heard you can't set a focus in classic.
---
She was lookin kinda dumb
---
CTMod
---
can you link your spec?
---
Like the other guy said, top tier you have HP (titans) for tanks, and supreme power (spellpower) for caster dps.  Then you have wisdom (mana) for healers, and the phys dps may also go for titans but since they have nothing else for phys dps (no AP/str/agil flasks) if you aren't dying then you probably wouldn't bother.
---
Shadow priest may go wisdom instead of supreme power, because they are mana whores.
---
Later on you may need the resistance flask, but I'm not too familiar with that raiding.
---
Def useful for that extra threat gain but theres def better options out there. I saved my money skipping this set for my tanking gear...but as for certain other classes/specs, esp rogues this set is definantly worth it imo
---
Yes have you ua3d census addon before, its complete shite. Its innaccurate, alow, and neber has similar data to anyone you compile it with.
---
I remember getting shackled for the first time and being like "Wtf 45 seconds?"
---
Its hard for tanks to get raid spots, I would play a healer. Warlock is also a class that is hard pressed for good players in raid.
---
As if you can’t counter us enough, nice try though
---
15 min queue rn :D
---
Stalagg is much worse than 60/40. And when it was 60/40, Heartseeker was much better than 80/20
---
Lol. This thread is wild. I left for a day.
---
I'm a level 57 resto shaman. Hoping to build up a set for raiding so that I can join my friends.
---
Im passed this, and found another BRD group obviously. I've been talked to about this from various redditors that this is a common thing. But they way this particular group went about it was super weird.
---
Thanks for the replies however! Lots of advice.
---
Fantastic post. Thank you for sharing this.
---
HAHA. Already moving the goalposts away xD
---
Earlier you said:
---
&gt;yes upload a vid of repeated resetting
---
Now magically it is:
---
&gt;resetting by eating and drinking back to full.
---
Sensing that you were wrong? ;)
---
its not just that. Horde really doesnt react to these things while ally try their hardest to defend the cities. It has more to do with the playerbase on horde being so passive and not giving a fuck tbh. I dont think there is a single solid pvp guild on horde lmfao. I hate the server
---
Yeah, I play fullscreen windowed, I don't know much about techincal stuff, so I really don't know what else could be limiting the framerate, sorry. What should I be looking for?
---
So then please explain exactly what is happening here. 
---
Describe the reasons for this occurring and give OP possible examples of other bugs that are similar so he can avoid them in the future.
---
Same thoughts, he probably never trained it to save on gold. Who knows?
---
Settle down, future domestic terrorist.

This comment is the embodiment of the world of warcraft community

You all sound like a bunch of pedophiles and drop outs hooked on heroin

Sorry if this bothers you friend. I will continue to play the game and have fun. 
---
Honestly your right I am pretty terrible, any arms warrior who’s not terrible would probably do better then me, point of the thread; arms warrior can raid.
---
I raid with pvp spec too xD I’m not even trying my full potential ; I’ve used mortal strike in fights and no one gives a fuck. Cause it’s not worth it. Who cares? We clear MC. A lot. Every time. 
---
I’m ready for phase 2 , come pvp me and I’ll show you that side of the game too.
---
Says to check his logs. I do. Then says they arent right and that his recount screenshots show tge truth. Okay buddy.
---
You are bottom barrel player who plays in a shitty guild and is delusional about his dos because he did okay damage on a cleave boss w sweeping strikes.
---
Not normal at all
---
Jaffa Kree!

IDK didn't paladins in the beta literally not have talents?
---
i have 3 60s at this point. those below shall remain below. forever.
---
It's not that simple.  See the sources below.  The amount of honor you get is dictated more by where your ranking lies.  It is not a linear relationship.  So getting into the top bucket of honor matters substantially.  Each bucket has a maximum number of players.  0.2% receive the maximum honor.  It is highly unlikely that you will be able to reach R14 without being in the top bucket due to decay.  There isn't a hard cap on how many players can be R14 in one given week.  But due to the nature of the system, there is a finite number of players who can be and it isn't big.

I'm not home so I couldn't tell you, but fullscreen windowed means the windows compositor is still handling actually drawing the game to your frame buffer.
---
Is your monitor 60hz?
---
Awesome, thanks!!!
---
I was.  I was 22 the mobs were like 19-20 elites.
---
Play what you like, not what others want you to play
---
I'm the guy who ninja'd a BiS Rogue weapon from whiny me-me-me self important warrior after declaring, before the raid, that only Rogues will roll on Vis'kag, and Warriors roll Deathbringer.  The Vis'kag went to the rogue who beat me on the roll.  I ain't giving non-BiS weapon to a plate rogue that'll vendor it.
---
Blizzard could relocate to China and denounce freedom and it still wouldn't hurt their WoW subs like this terrible idea would.
---
Considering we have lots of threads asking about populations and whether it is worth rolling or transferring for specific servers, it matters a lot for some folks.
---
Yea was trying to be funny :)  Thanks for answering!
---
https://ironforge.pro/ is an armory and population census app that parses all the data from Warcraftlogs. It has all time and last 2 weeks currently. Obviously the armory is only gonna be peoples MC gear that's in their logs.
---
This is an anime JRPG now

How do we know it's Thursday? I can't find anything stating blizzard will release phase 2 on Thursday.  Only thing that I've heard is that it's coming the week of the 12th and that was announced at blizzcon. But not the date/time in which that it will be released.
---
kinda reminds me this lame high school parties
---
I'll reroll this week... Not really liking Incendius.
---
What're you using? Havent gotten Slaghide Monkey/ Tiger/ Bear/ Defense to drop yet, and quick draw are fine but im not sure those + warstrife are enough to give up 2% but
---
Which server? Try checking the discord it the subreddit for your server.
---
I gotta end up missing a raid or 2 with holidays coming up. If I'm extra unlucky I might just buy a leaf and call it a day lol. How much you guys normally selling for?
---
Some next level multitasking you got there.
---
Rattlegore!  I did play Brigandine back in the day, &lt;3 that game - an ex girlfriend chose the name for a FFXIV character I made, and ironically it was Dryst, same as Tyrant Dryst in Brigandine.  Happy coincidence really
---
Inflated in what way? In terms of supply yeah but demand is probs about to increase since no layers meaning less resources in non-instanced areas.
---
It is much much better.
---
Earthfury Represent!
---
Considering what a cancer classic pvp ranking is and how long time it takes to regain lost rank, yeah I'd stay far away from it.
---
You do not need to prowl... all pets have the same aggro range regardless of the level i'm almost 100% sure.
---
heh and here i am thinking its a chore to rep up in Draenor for pathfinder lol
---
&lt;3
---
Try dropping that one in the Barrens sometime, it'll keep you entertained throughout the mindless zhevra grind.
---
I would say find a guild that acts as seriously as you do
---
Warrior still gets dodge ac and crit from the agi. All things considered i think they're just about equal value and i usually keep both equipped on my warrior unless i need a resistance ring or the naglering thorns, and I'm not in really looking to get a second tarnished any time soon
---
That discord and the whitemane reddit are extra toxic zzzz
---
Doesn't matter when you start, and you don't have to play absurdly long hours to climb until rank 10+
---
Any good guilds alliance side that raid?
---
This is weird for me because I always assume the sweaty pvp tryhards were horde and I always get judged by friends for being alliance but then we have situations like this, the first Rag down being alliance, the streamers being alliance, etc.
---
Yeah incendius is the worst of both worlds, tons of competition for gathering but none of the perks of high pop like highly inflated prices (perk for me lol) 
---
I think it's due to incendius' lack of competitive pve guilds. As you said, it's one of the 3 largest servers in terms of population for EST zoned servers, yet there's ONE guild in the top 25 for MC speed clears from incendius, and it's alliance.
---
Two horde guilds have transferred to Arcanite Reaper almost entirely and I'm certain they're still waiting on more to transfer over.
---
I logged in the other day and saw a ton of 60s I've never seen before.
---
I approve.
---
Honestly not much like 200-250g at least that’s what every other guild sells them for. We’ve done 7 clears and 5 leafs have dropped and 2 eyes. Honestly I’d wait if you are part of a guild eventually you’ll get it
---
Haha awesome. My toon is named Vayn, short for Lord Vaynard. I also have an alt named Esmeree. I played the heck out of Brigandine
---
Most of the world really doesn't need nor want your balancing. Silly burgers.
---
Or turn general chat off because the last thing I want to hear while relaxing is politics and religion
---
We're about to hit the point of having more than 40 people wanting to raid, been running with 30-35 for a month.  We're planning to give DKP for people on standby, and committing to rotating people in week to week, or even boss to boss if people are willing to skip certain bosses.
---
My bad, I’m a Priest spec’d 31/20. Thanks for the input
---
Thanks a lot!
---
I use Shadowpanther.net as the source of item evaluation, and all Zeal, Dal and Krol are basically all the same.
---
I was just worried that Dal will never drop, ha.
---
But yeah, it might be better to save!
---
This is real content right here
---
When you hit 60, I'll see you out there on the battlefield.  Get wrecked Alliance scum!
---
No layers today; bend over son.
---
ゴゴゴゴゴゴゴゴゴゴゴゴ
---
So I'm seeing a lot of good comments here, but I think there are somethings you need to consider first.  
---
What are you playing this game for?   If you want to experience the raids and clear content then "raiding guild" might be perfect for you, but historically those guild do end up with fairly large amounts of drama and sometimes those players have less patience with newer players.
---
I don't see a server, faction, or class in your post and those things can be important when related to this advice.
---
That being said, there are plenty of more social geared guilds whose goal is playing with low to no drama people while also working on clearing content.  They might not be clearing Naxx in week 1 but they will probably be significantly more interested in helping you understand your class and the raiding itself while hopefully looking at the person behind the keyboard.
---

No changes. Farm the gold if you can't farm the herb
---
Is the barman’s shanker rebuff going to actually take off good debuffs in raid?
---
Or is it not high priority enough to do that?
---
wow just in time for me to never need keys
---
The guards in Gadgetzan, Booty Bay, and Everlook now have a significantly longer range on their ranged attacks.
---
Developers’ note: We’re seeing some players attack others by abusing line-of-sight rules in Gadgetzan. This disruption is against our Terms of Service (as it was in 2006) and we’re taking action against players who exploit this game mechanic. While this new range differs slightly from orginal WoW 1.12, it better enforces the authentically intended consequence of PvPing in a goblin city by challenging the attacker to fight, die, or escape the guards.
---
The Discombobulator Ray will now correctly dismount mounted enemy players.
---
Abilities that provide a damage increase to the next auto attack (e.g. Heroic Strike and Raptor Strike) will now properly break crowd control effects if the ability was queued before the crowd control was applied.
---
Corrected an issue that prevented pets from attacking a target who entered stealth after the Attack command is used.
---
Corrected an issue with the Gnomish Cloaking Device that caused it to incorrectly drop the player from combat when used.
---
Being good will not help you secure a world boss when you the enemy faction has 4 or 5 times your numbers.
---
I lold
---
Sounds like loot rule were stated before raid so no not a ninja
---
sounds fun. i suggest you try as you think will work and dont look too much into guides and stuff unless youre stuck.
---
nobody cares about your guilds drama
---
Oh, you don't need them, but they're honestly amazing to have.
---
First of all, I've only got like 8 easily useable buttons bound to my main action bar. 1-4, Q, E, R, F. All of those are already macro'd with at least shift, some with ctrl. But then on top of that, I now have another 12 buttons (some of which are also macro'd).
---
I mean, hunters are especially keybind intensive for sure, but even on my priest I'm using literally all of them as well. Also, for things like kiting, having a ton of abilities on your mouse so you don't have to take your fingers off the movement keys is seriously so much better than the alternative.
---
Demand will not go up that sharply, but supply will be cut effectively by 50%. The auction houses were not layered, so the only things I can see going up in value are pvp consumables like limited invulnerability potion and FAP since wpvp will surely drive up demand in those consumes. 
---
So when I say inflated, I mean supply has been inflated. That prices have been smaller than what they would have been on a single layer because of it. I imagine prices near across the board go up 10-25% in the coming week. And that's being conservative.
---
ok
---
The impatience of wanting my sexy flower bow is tearing me apart. That's lower cost than I thought though, after getting my epic mount early I'm just kinda leaving gold sitting around. I'll see how my luck goes this weekend (seen a lot of eye drops personally), but thanks for the info!
---
That's healing in a nutshell for every healing spec. It does get slightly more interesting at 60 with downranking.
---
This 100%. I still have some things to farm and grabbed the chest from the 7. Definately worse but comperable. I'll arena farm later when I'm bored
---
&gt; pve minded betas playing on a pvp server

That's fair.  I try to reclaim the topics by bringing up vaping.  A buddy of mine is fond of promising 1g in chat to whoever can type out the lyrics to Ice Ice Baby the fastest, though this might not work any more now that people are on to leveling alts and 1g isn't as big a motivator.

Nice think I will do bracers boots and shoulders or replace shoulders with belt I just want the 3 set bonus and then I should be fine with my other gear
---
I think I have you beat, I killed a single whelpling in Swamp of sorrows and got a pet.
---
It was legit, "Ohh damn I accidentally pulled one, might as well kill it"
---
You said "to full". Obviously in 15 seconds of sheep you won't always get back from 0 to 100.
---
No I still stand by what I said, again I’ll post another thread to prove it, I’ve got top damage done (no not dps) multiple times on multiple bosses. You can comment on that thread too if you want :)

Is there an add on that will show my healing on other targets in floating combat text? 
---
I want to see my op priest heals appear and enabling ‘floating combat text’ alone does not show heals
---
As a healer I can not agree that dual wield tanking is not good advice. However, I do agree that a shield does defiantly add a significant amount of mitigation. Dual wield tanking can really help a tank with rage and threat generation. Also there is more damage output which means mobs die faster and less mana is used by the healer. I am not saying one way should be favored over the other but dual wield tanking is defiantly a viable way to go, and you don't need to be over geared or over leveled to do it.
---
Don't go shadow priest like me.
---
Raid groups won't invite you because they don't want more than 1 shadow priest if any.
---
Dungeon groups won't invite you because they read on the internet "shadow priest bad PvE" and assume it applies to dungeons too.
---
I think it is just a dumb argument in general with classic. Oh no, we made a tiny change! That's the first step towards a game that has had over a decade of contwnt including 7 expansions!  I mean, come on.
---
Thank you VERY MUCH for your info, I think you probably just saved me hours of frustration.  So do you know a pvp server that is not as bad for alliance?
---
Move anything works fine in classic.
---
Went Ele at 40. The only issue is the need for water. So, when I log on, I ask a mage for water and tip them a gold. I'm now set for hours and getting 100 water for 1g is much cheaper than the 20-40s per 5 stack.
---
If you are against playing ele, maybe try out 1h with Shield. It's slow, but the extra armor helps, and you won't need as much water. Use Rockbiter/Flametongue, since they are the most consistent. Use Lightning Shield, Searing Totem for chip damage.
---
:'( sigh oh well. Thanks for the clarification.
---
Maybe he should have said that in party chat so the group could adapt.
---
I own this one best mouse I've ever touched
---
An epic mount will help you get to places faster, farm faster and have less downtime, so my suggestion is to go for that first.
---
and just like that youve admitted defeat
---
Thank you Casper :D  TRUTH
---
Counter argument, can u guys mob harder on getting bug fixes before Thursday. Srsly it's been months since blizzard has even acknowledged their existence and these bugs exist for most classes that are both frustrating and game breaking in some cases which people will start to learn about and abuse in pvp come Thursday.
---
I know you can do it reddit mob 👍
---
whats wrong with feign death?
---
I wouldnt join a guild that does spam invites. Join the guilds discord and listen in on a raid, if they dont like that you're listening to their raid then thats a bad sign usually.
---
But you do
---
Yep I noticed that too. If you don’t panic and run away for a second or two and THEN vanish, seems like it sticks easier.
---
The problem is I panic sometimes and hit it as soon as I see “resist.” Then I die anyways T^T
---
To this day I still think about when I was in my 40’s week 1-2ish of classic release when I was standing by the BS in Gadgetzan. The guards let out an “All jail xxx for becoming exalted with the Thorium Brotherhood”. 
---
Keeping your post about your tiresome achievement, I have no idea how this player managed to accomplish this so early on into release. This was on the Aragul server(OCE).
---
They don't care - they're the typical blast and forget spammers. They don't even read the replies.
---
I actually use the default raid frames, you can customize them a bit in the interface settings. I also use show my heal addon so I can see how much my heals hit. I know grid is popular and so is healbot but I wasn’t a fan of either of those, there are some others ones but I haven’t tried them out.
---
K sorry lol
---
I don’t understand why people are expecting more than that to have reached 60.. if you got it at launch you would likely need to spend 2 hours every single day playing to get 60, assuming you make it in 7 days.
---
am rogue - doesnt matter xd
---
Gonna level any other classes to 60?
---
Mistake?^^
---
Druid is unkillable for many classes in 1o1 if geared and played well, just no burst if u are not balance..
---
&gt;I then did the reset method of bringing an alt on and resetting the instance on them, and my rogue had a 10s stealth cooldown upon logging back in.
---
I noticed this on my druid too, if I log out stealthed in Cat form, I'm immediately given a 10 second cooldown. 
---
Maybe it's something to stop abusing logging in/out safely in areas.
---
Thanks man. Glad you agree
---
I think it makes a lot of sense.
---
PVP adds a dynamic world around you with interesting situations where you fuck people up and get fucked up sometimes in fun or hilarious ways.
---
You can roll on a PVP server and get the whole WOW experience with a mainly PVE focus, and PVP is always there waiting and *sometimes* it finds you which adds some spice.
---
Even if you are 99% interested in PVE, rolling on a PVE server simply lacks a certain element of flavor that is integral to the experience of playing in a dynamic dangerous open world.
---
It makes sense that PVE players would still want that experience even if it's not their main focus.
---
Grow up.
---
They will mostly stop.  Though the more coordinated guilds can separate into a “ranking raid” who avoid DHK’s and a “tanking raid” who don’t care if their pvp rating tanks to handle most of the NPCs.  This requires a lot of discipline obviously and it won’t be a widespread phenomenon.
---
Yeah this is my unpopular opinion here: A couple of these pieces are fine, but people loading up exclusively on greens with no stats are BiS items for speed run MC farms. On the other hand, you're setting yourself up to be dead quickly in progressive content.

To deal with the 255 character limit, I would remove the conditions for the rank you cast the least, which I assume is rank 1

So it would look like

Yep, I find it pretty sketchy and hard to believe..

You shouldn't jump to cancel your spellcasts.

Really wish it didn't lag so much, but the visuals made up for it, fuuuck that was cool.
---
Yeah I was like what? I can never sell them for more than 29 on Grobb. Any idea why the price would be so different? Everyone still needs crusader.
---
Yeah fuck that guild.  They did you a favor.
---
Queue-dodging
---
You mean the [Keymaster](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=3842/brombar-higgleby#comments)? Pretty sure he served no purpose.
---
Bingo. 
---
It's very useful for a druid with swiftmend. You can time it so the hot is just about to tick off, then BOOM, use it up and heal them. You get almost double the HOT heals off this.
---
They ran out of other shit to sell.
---
This could be, but as I said, it also happened to me from taking fall damage. Although it does seem to be pretty consistently 10 seconds using the logout method.
---
Check the advanced settings to make sure you don't have "Limit maximum frames" enabled. I think it is enabled by default.
---
Great, didnt know it worked for classic ty
---
Razorgore is really nice, it's seems pretty balanced and you'll always encounter the opposite faction. As a horde I can't move more than a few meters before encountering some ally, BRM is a warzone as well, especially on raid nights.
---
At 45 you will generally struggle to hold AoE aggro, especially if there's something like a mage spamming AoE in the group.
---
The best thing to do is identify when you are having trouble with certain pulls (e.g. big groups, or taunt immune enemies), then tell your party to hold off on DPS for a few seconds (5-10) before attacking.
---
No retail isn't a game that cares about community. They make money on mounts and macrotransactions.
---
You could probably do some raids but probably not all bosses and would be difficult to find 40+ druids to join to begin with. You would be lacking dispels, buffs and other utilities the other classes bring. And it would be really be difficult to gear out 3 specs .
---
From what I hear, (didn't play vanilla) joining a guild just to poach members was a somewhat common practice. Fuckem get his ass outa the guild.
---
Yeah that guy clearly has no idea what he's talking about lol
---
In this case? They did nothing wrong, just killed someone of the opposite faction infront of the entrance to MC, happens all the time!
---
Worst case scenario? Some guy does something stupid or selfish and it gets screenshot and shared on classicwow.
---
People recognize the name and the server, people start to let OP know they have made sure the person got kicked from their guild. Justice you say, after all he ninjad the Edgemaster gloves!
---
Meanwhile, the post goes viral, somehow someone finds his reddit account.. they go down the rabbit hole and boom they find some personal information, name and country.
---
His facebook account is found, his partner and family is found. Hey this guy has a family, lets send threatning messages to them exclaiming how their father/husband/son molests children! You know, to really get him for that ninja looting incident! 
---
Boom, we ruined his life! Because there are some really vindicative and terrible people out there with a fucked up idea of justice.
---
He said they're isn't any very good mh axe available atm. Just read the comment first we're not talking about dalrend or anything here but best MH axe available
---
I don't begrudge anyone for playing on a pve server. If you don't like the pvp life it's good that they provided an option for you to not have to experience it as they always have in wow. I don't criticize folks for playing on pve servers. I criticize folks who rolled on pvp servers and then complain that they're getting killed. They had the same option you picked. If you play on a pve server because you don't like getting ganked, good for you. If you roll on a pvp server and then complain about pvp and expect it to change, you're kind of a baby. Since this doesn't apply to you, no, I'm not saying anything about you.

Because there was never cross realm battlegrounds when I played vanilla.
---
How much rep do you lose for killing one of those furbolgs in azhara? Anyone know?
---
I solo heal it as a druid all the time with random shit pugs. Just dont aggro on the drop-down to rend fight and everything else is easy. I can decurse which makes it nice if the mages aren't on it, other than that just dont get kicked.
---
If properly defended the Thunder Bluff elevator is the most defensible chokepoint in the game.  It’s rarely ever defended though.
---
They pop up occassionally on RP realms, if you dont mind that sort of thing. Clearung content sucks though, vying for all the same loot...
---
Resto shaman is pretty easy for party invites and seems extremely desired from reading PUG raid group LFMs.
---
Absolutely agree, it’s a joke that Blizzard apologists on this sub will defend this shitfest of a launch.
---
CLEAR COMMS
---
Because you never get invited anywhere that needs a key, right?
---
Serious question - is it unfair that we tell the rogues that if they win daggers they can't get swords until the other rogues (that don't have daggers) get swords? We're just trying to spread loot out instead of having everyone be greedy with their rolls.
---
This picture and series of pictures are AMAZING. I hope there is somewhere to support and purchase a print for at home on my wall
---
Wait, we can loot trade BOP stuff in raids? Can we in dungeons too?
---
Silithus has 10. I had no idea EPL had that many though.
---
Use this! @ 400 Healing Power you should be using Rank 4. Otherwise use Rank 10 Healing Touch.
---
What about menethil? Also if they kill you you will get a respawn as well. And if they kill you multiple times the honor will decrease that means it’s not worth for them if they are serious honor farming and are forced to leave
---
That’s the thing - I’m ds/ruin in raid, so it’s mostly shadowbolt damage. Still looking like felcloth wins out, at least for now - but I do think I’ll get em and test it out before too long anyways!
---
You can drop the help and nodead if you want to decrease character spaces.  Those two conditionals mean you must have a living friendly target to start casting.  But due to putting @player, it will default to healing yourself.  You could drop the @player but you must target yourself to cast then.
---
Insane in BC and Wrath, good in Cata. They are very good DPS in all tiers of content in BC and Wrath. 
---
In BC, BM just reigns supreme. 
---
Wrath BM was still very good in the initial content, then Survival took over for Ulduar and Trial of the Crusader, then in ICC MM took over because of ArP. 
---
In Cata Survival and BM were very good in the initial content, then in Firelands MM took over and they were pretty good, then hunters fell off really hard in Dragonsoul.
---
Fair enough, I’d personally would rather try to collude with my faction than deal with super unbalanced wpvp but I see your point.
---
The dps should have just sat there doing nothing, over pulling agro. Go at the tanks threat pace. If you start wiping because of oom, well then suggest things to the tank. 
---
I would wager if the dps slow played it, the run would have been smoother. Except for the double pack pull, slower would have had no chance unless your group had a ton of cc, a hunter or warlock to pet offtank...etc.
---
275 dos on magmadar but he swears his recount logs are better. Your a joke

i just want to let you guys know that it dropped after 272 runs in a dusty tome by lethtendris

We do have guild guidelines to follow and part of them is that any action that is grievous or harmful to the guild will be dealt with appropriately by officers

Yes!  Please popularize this!  My druid alt is lvl 24 and ready for some SM boosting.  I haven't seen  anybody advertising boosts on my realm... but thenagain I spend 90% of my time alone in DME lol
---
Nothing in that post says anything about a keyring
---
No I don’t do alts, never was my thing
---
Hadn’t heard of it. I’ll give it a search
---
Yes, I have personally picked a black lotus less than an hour after picking the previous one in the same zone, on the same layer.
---
I think it’s people who go for pure sp over any other stat. A big mistake imo, you still need int and stam in order to actually do the damage after all! Then again, with perfect positioning and a lot of mana pots I could see it working out.
---
I assume you mean your 2 week resignation. Please continue to show up for 2 weeks and put forth 10% effort since you know you are leaving and have no fear of reprimand.
---
Perfect, thanks.
---
For sure, I'm seein 65 for Gloves and 110 for Pants on Sulfuras rn, which is a very high-pop, balanced, and active server.
---
This is real peak performance right here
---
In my opinion it's just a shitty meme ganking/dueling spec no matter what your gear looks like. But if you want to run it, aim for 25% or higher.
---
Those are buffs, yet people keep calling raids nerfed. Thats an important distinction.
---
Thats an oddity rather than a rule. Loot council is a the best system for everyone.
---
Probably for like 2-3 seconds just to gain some distance. I’ve also noticed that the closer you are to them the chances of vanish not working goes up pretty high so yeah try to not vanish right away

Is that the symbol from the cloysta of trails from final fantasy?

I’m mainly a PvP player (or was when I previously played WoW) but I recently started raiding and I’m quite enjoying it.

If I don’t do much PvP in phase 2 and wait for phase 3, will I struggle in bgs?

#nochanges
---
Well sometimes you and the guild are just not the right fit. I'm okay with loot. I understand how luck works and I know if I raid with a guild long enough, I will eventually get the loot. As long as the loot rules are somewhat reasonable, I can accept that.
---
But as a punctual person myself, I can't really stand raid starting one hour and one and a half hour later than the announced time. Or have a lot of people forget their consumables and repairs and have to run out all the time. Or have the raid leader overfilling the raid and then booting people off to make room for late raiders.
---
&gt;Good guilds seldom advertise.
---
This is my problem, i've tried even going to third party websites/discords to find a decent guild for Bigglesworth - Horde for me and my buddy but at this point we are just a guildless duo sham/rogue at lvl 50 that are gonna get absolutely destroyed with phase 2 release :P   
---
I was hoping that by the time we hit 60 and start doing 'endgame' content and runs we may get a decent offer for a cool group, but with us deciding to reroll toons together we missed the original hype/speed of people grouping up for content and unfortunately a lot of those 'cliques' seem to have already been formed.
---
Then post that when I post my recount logs, it’ll be okay. Why are you still here? Why are you so invested?
---
I did ungoro, wpl, St, and brd
---
I'm iffy on the innervate. I innervate myself most of the time in raids. I'm always top 3 healing so I think it's not unreasonable. No one has said anything yet, so hopefully, it's not a big deal. In the extreme case that a priest is OOM and I somehow still have mana, I'll innervate them.
---
You don't have to have done everything there is to do to still want honor. 
---
And it is pretty casual to hit 60 in 3 months. No one is saying it's super casual but it's around or below average.
---
Hi! I'm new to classic and am wondering what server to play on. I'm thinking of going alliance on any EU realm. I'd like it to be an active server where I can PvE but with possibilities for PvP. Does anyone have any good suggestions, and/or tips for a newbie. 
---
If you know any addons that are good to know about I'd appreciate that as well (though I have been reading up about this point, thought maybe there's a gem or two I've missed). 
---
Have a great day!
---
Cloudkeepers are hands down the best. Think of them as having 1% Crit 40 attack power and 200 hp. I agree with you on the Battleborns though having some extra stamina can always help. But I left that open for the viewer to decide what they like best between those pieces.
---
The only spec that counters a rogue this well geared is Reck. This Paladin is not Reck. Even if he knew what he was doing he would likely lose every fight.
---
I respectfully disagree. There’s a reason all the full servers have stayed overpopulated. Most people don’t care enough about the queue to transfer, otherwise we would have seen the lower pop realms fill up faster. What they don’t like is being the minority faction on their server, that’s when you see the most transfers. The solution doesn’t lie in faction specific transfers, it’s a problem inherent to the overall system in the game.
---
Yeah I mean there's pros and cons for staying/leaving, but there's at least a reason for some guilds to leave servers. For some horde guilds that are really solid they will still get bullied out by the even more solid guilds on the server, and the option for collusion might not even be open.
---
May have, I don't tend to be very aggressive most of the time though.
---
 
---
&gt;I never said he was.
---
\&gt;Sure you did,
---
But he literally didn't.
---
Ah, I didn't realize they smoothed out the RP you get every week over a series of break points. That's good to know.
---
I remember getting R8 in vanilla. I'd like to get to R10 in classic, but that might take too much commitment for me.
---
Darnassus and Thunder Bluff are the Chinese ghost cities of Warcraft.  Sure they *exist*, but is anyone actually aware of that?
---
The worst part is the Stitchings. Other than that, the blood is done in like an hour. You can solo it if you get naked, loot the pool, run away and die. The scales are cheap AF, not even a gold. The stitchings require full Strat UD runs so that sucks. Luckily had 10 in my bank ready for whenever carapace would eventually drop. Got it done in an hour after it dropped.
---
We want vanilla, we want vanilla.
---
Just make sure it’s vanilla with all the bugs fixed, QoL improvements, heirlooms, flying mounts.
---
This is the first I've heard of the term "tourist", so...
---
I thought I was already running auctionator, but I do not get that much info, I’ll have to check.
---
Thank you
---
I put everyone on ignore that does that to me. Even a guildy who did it a few weeks back, f them.
---
BRD
---
Keep in mind that commitment includes buffs and consumables.  The time commitment is only a small part.  If your guild requires a flask for runs, can you afford that on top of your other expenses?  If your raid leader wants you online an hour before the pull so they can get full DM and Onyxia buffs, can you accommodate that?
---
You should get attuned asap and start doing PUGs.  Get some experience and maybe some loot.  I know one PUG on my server started at himself looking for 39 others to raid.  First night cleared to domo but didnt have the waters.  Within 3 weeks they cleared Rag.  Now that is a guild that built itself organically. 
---
You can also always inquire with the more serious guilds but many are not recruiting anymore and others are looking to get well geared people and not new people.  Not always the case though.  We just closed our doors to new people once the second raid started getting a bench.
---
shut the fuck up and post better memes then idiot
---
Very helpful thank you sir
---
R10 is achievable.  I think you only need to sprint for a few weeks to really reach it.  You may be able to hit it with a moderate amount of pvp over a longer period of time.  You basically need to figure out how much RP you are gaining and losing in a week.  If you are neutral, you are capped at that point.  Otherwise, you can keep gaining ranks, even if it might take a month to go from R9 to R10.
---
Its either 25 or 50 for all the ones in the cave between felwood/WS/MG, I'm imagining the same for killing an azshara.
---
Also, WTF are the timbermaw guarding out there?  giant gate to nuthin.
---
Go for green level mobs and quests, do dungeons to get ahead, it will help a ton.
---
Join Gehennas. Top tier playerbase there.
---
Also they were unarmed fighters
---
A proper bustling metropolis.
---
Wow this is amazing! I was guessing at my pvp set. I have most of phase 1-2 sorted already. Been lucky to  be one of the main resto shamans in the raid. 
---
Bring on phase 2!
---
&gt;It's all percentage based but honor is bucket based
---
What's the distinction between a bracket of percentages and a bucket?
---
I have no idea, but hopefully someone else knows!
---
You're technically right, which is the best kind of right to be.
---
I tried to have fun in this game. Fuck me right?! xD
---
No. Just gotta re-learn the PVP Rhythm come phase 3 instead of 2.
---
I prefer not using a shield... but then I get melted (even with full plate) and the healer has to drink every pull.
---
I also parrot the idea of ele being the way to go 40ish+ but to give you some new anecdotal advice, I have absolutely no idea what it is, but windfury ALWAYS seems to get dodged/parry'd/missed or whatever i have no idea why it seems like it happens so much more often with windfury on but i truly think its overrated.  
---
 **big slow 2h?** Use rockbiter, Wayyy more melee attack power and consistent damage unreliant on procs but still does massive damage when your crits proc because its crit'ing scaled up from that rockbiter melee atk power.   
---
**fast 1h+shield setup? (this is where i am as ele spec using a dagger and shield)**  use flametongue, Potentially try windfury here because twice as many attacks is twice as many chances for that big windfury chunk. BUT again my anecdotal evidence is; windfury always misses, flametongue is an extra damage proc that seems to double your white hit damage and also has the benefit of not caring about armor the way the rest of your damage does. 
---
Basically dont play meme-hancement with meme-fury weapon because you're at the point in the game where it has fallen off.
---
**I decided to start the Alliance series earlier and go with both in parallel. Hope you like the Alliance beginning. It's basic, but I think this is the charm for all beginnings.**

I use Grid, using smallish boxes &amp; put everything underneath my feet, so that if a fire lands on me, I see it right away, because my eyes are already there.
---
It doesn't matter much right now, but eventually it becomes critical to know when to interrupt your healing and move.
---
Eventually you'll also learn to CC &amp; heal at the same time too. Particularly useful in ZG, AQ, and even BWL.
---
My suggestion, if you have time, heal a few bosses of a 5 man dungeon run with your guild as your practice run. You should be overgeared, but you have only 1 rez &amp; no backup, so basically have to pull it off in one go.
---
how the hell can you be hardcore and not 60 yet when there are actual hardcore players clearing MC under 2 hours and in 5/8 .. i just don't get it.
---
S P A G H E T T I  C O D E
---
Wait...  Thursday?
---
Is there a reason as to why guilds would not want new people? Is there a reason why i usually only see guilds have 1 main raid group and 1 off-raid group? I would think the more raid groups a guild could have the better
---
As Moonglow Resto, I’m always at the top of the healing meters.
---
His purpose is waiting for the gatekeeper.
---
If theres a caster, put the mob down the list of prioritization to build threat on. Magic damage doesnt matter if it hits you or a dps, it's still the same amount to heal. 
---
If you have a skull target you can throw 1 global, preferably a shield slam on it in the start and build threat on all other mobs and once it starts hitting a dps you can taunt it for "free" threat, it should die before you lose aggro again, or in worst case scenario just concussion blow it.
---
You should also use berserker rage as much as you can, especially in the start of a pull so you gain a lot more rage from taking damage.
---
But honestly, as a prot warrior the way to build threat is to do sunder/revenge/shield slam 1 mob at a time
---
Peak hours Thunderfury has about 10-15 lvl 60s waiting on the docks there. Not to mention it's a short hop from IF for backup to say hi.
---
Should I go for quests that are green, but 5-6 levels below me?
---
I've seen screenshots of people being warned about it, one guy posted some here because he claimed he hadn't been ganking (then admitted he had been up there and others from his faction had ganked).
---
It's not an instant ban thing, but if you are exploiting it and it's reported a GM will usually throw you a warning.
---
A legitimate question. Quickly mods remove this post!
---
Sure, enjoy your competitive dps while you can but dont trickyourself into thinking come aq40 and naxx you will be above any half awake rogue mage lock or warr
---
You're responding to the wrong person. 
---
I am saying that we are making do with who rolled on the server.
---
Did they already fix the Onyxia fireball stack strategy?
---
There's this really awesome ability that Wareiors have. It is designed for AoE and reduces the damage you take by about 20%. Thunder Clap. If you are not utilizing crowd control T Clap is wonderful for 5 target threat gain
---
Maybe so, but that’s entirely separate from the term “honor bracket.” The term “bracket” is completely blind to the method by which players within said bracket gain honor.
---
I'd actually advise against the mount first, but this is all really just personal opinions. As a tank, I assume you are going to be tanking MC but haven't yet 10/10 cleared it? If so, that should be your number 1 priority and everything else comes afterwards.
---
Lionheart helm is very good, but its really a rich folks item for tanking (you can get by with t1 helm and t2 helm is better, whereas dps use lionheart for a looong time). 
---
With all that in mind, I'd recommend the axe of deep woods as this will significantly increase the amount of threat you generate which is absolutely necessary if you plan to raid tank. If your threat is lacking you will hold your entire raid back. Use the rest of your gold to finish up your fire resist set if you are going to be tanking rag.
---
spy is a helpful tool that will help us
---
Yeah there are Zerg guilds with like 4 raid teams who won’t need to collude with their own faction. Like on my server the big Zerg guild controls onyxia head on raid nights and refuses to collaborate.
---
Yup. Been a great server for me. Nice balance too.
---
I don't think P2 was rushed because I don't think the overall content in P2 is all that much, honestly.  
---
With DM getting bumped up a massive chunk of what was coming in P2 is already out, I don't think people realize how zero layers and populations 10 times what we had in vanilla mean that 99.9% of players will never see Azuregos/Kazzak, especially if they spawn at 2 am server time.  
---
Honestly it just adds honor.
---
Well as for BB and Ony sword, we give rogues priority on them because warriors greatly prefer Deathbringer (axe from ony, orc racial etc.) and they have the option of 2 handers. And I see warriors with just axe of deep woods + flurry axe regularly doing 800+ dps from the top guilds with only pre-raid bis. Plus our rogues would throw a shit fit if we allowed fury warriors to roll on BB / Vishkag. If we were alliance I'd definitely allow it, but since all dps warriors should be orc, and axes are so much better for them, it just made sense.
---
Hi, I have some questions about dishonorable kills. 
---
Before I start grinding honor, I want to rack up an absolutely ludicrous amount of DK's so people will go WTF when they inspect me. If I waste my first week on this, can I start grinding honor for real in week 2 and onwards? Can I even do it week 1 if I start by farming DK's? Finally, what is the most convenient horde civilian to farm? As a hunter, my dream is to leave my pet and myself on shadowmeld, with my pet on aggressive. It will be absolutely amazing.
---
It does have pre bis head for melee dps and truefaith plans and a couple other decent pieces. Not even a thing worth mentioning for tanks.
---
Not even close to the actual ratios. My server was 67/33 when the wowhead report was published and I'm sure it's gotten worse since then.
---
Here I am level 53, with one key.  Still hyped though :)
---
Sounds like someone didn't get their broken tooth lmao
---
The issue here is that 90% of your story isn't actually interesting, and it's so painfully obvious that this guy should have been kicked.  This is like reading "Hey guys, my gf of 9 days has started telling me about how she really wants to date someone else and pawned my gifts for money, so I dumped her.  Did I do the right thing?"

No shit you did the right thing.  Are you somehow having doubts about that?  What insight are you even looking for?  Frankly, did you really need to share the story, let alone in the form of a 500+ word post?
---
Says the guy who's able to put no more than 2 words together for a reply... And in such a civilized manner too:)
---
What add-on are you using to show the dungeon lockout count and timer at the top?
---
But if you look at pserver logs from guilds that have naxx on farm, hunters aren't doing too hot there either.
---
I think you forgot to reply to somebody else.
---
By this logic literally everything is a pain to invest in.
---
The guy said in his previous server he made his own guild so he could get the loot and talks about tailoring groups around his own DPS. Watch the video don't just look at some logs on what he is doing now.
---
Why be in a guild with losers like that anyways.
---
It's not nochanges. It wasn't suppose to work like how it was. It's not supposed to be a vanish. So now it's fixed. But because people liked the way it worked while broken they don't want it "fixed" they want it to stay broken.
---
Bucket is used because while it is a bracket of percentages, the honor gained is different.  Think of the bucket as the slope of your honor increase inside the bracket.
---
My old guild used to host druid &amp; rogue only dungeons where we'd spend most of the time sneaking our way to various bosses and murdering them. It was super fun and different.
---
Not sure about full on raids...? dunno.
---
If humans were massive, tainted with fel magic, and had wolf teeth/ were gigantic native minotaur/ undead zombies/ not green, tall and creepy cousins of the orc, sure I would love to play alliance :)
---
Not even back then it was around 2-4 hours now it takes less than 20-30 minutes at peak hours, if not that and it’s somewhat dead it will go down to 10 -15 minutes
---
playing shadow is hard and fun ?
---
It becomes really hard to manage,  you need good officers to manage loot for each raid and good tanks.  Those dont grow on trees.  We have one guild that runs 3 raids but apparently the culture there is pretty toxic.  You also need enough for that third raid.  It sucks for those people that have to sit on a bench.  Eventually we will probably run 3 raids but will sell extra slots and not actually have 3 full raids.
---
Epic Mount is Best in Slot for at least twelve months, until at least the end of Phase 6. This should be a no brainer
---
We were just starting to move out from ogrimmar, but heard there was a raid heading in so we decided to wait a minute before leaving.

I’ve been in raids where lead screams CLEAR COMMS during MC trash.
---
It’s places a line in your screen with times along it (15 seconds, 30 seconds, 1 minute etc). When you cast a spell with a cool down it put the icon on the line and slowly moves it along. It’s another way to visualize how long spells are on cooldown and how some work with each other.   
---
Personally I don’t think there are enough spells with cool downs in classic to warrant this but I am not an expert on all 9 classes

right, so for those who dont get it, which i dont understand. All of the buttons on this keyboard say "Esc" which is a famous shortening of the keyboard function...escape. implying that the creator of this meme found himself/herself in a situation that they wanted to...escape from.

Keep a raid spot open for a pug druid and let him buy excess loot your regular druid doesn't want?

You sound jealous.  Also, you might want to choose a career outside of the food services to afford the things you want in life if your living off tips.  It seems your a bit sour about the fact someone made different choices than you.

I've been looking for something like this! Confirmed it still works. So glad i read the comments on this thread lol.
---
Join the Discord called Fight Club. I cant link it but it's a warrior guide Discord for classic.
---
The people over there are elitist douche bags who hate all life and the mods are the worst in the Discord community.
---
But the information they have there is top notch for DPS and Tank warriors.
---
Just do yourself a favor and dont ask questions or engage in their chat channels. Just snag all the info and study it.
---
If the mage is running away from the warrior, he's doing that to prevent the warrior from dropping combat after 6 secs and charging.  Same is done to keep a rogue from stealthing.
---
No you cant if with census addon not working, and the website not being a good way to get a player base # reliably. This is all ballpark, feeling, oriented data and isnt going to be accurate.
---
 How many times have you heard a person say, my server feels like theres more faction than my faction &gt;;( its like 60:40 so imba. This isnt how you find statistics.
---
Ours arent for sale so that would be ok.  Honestly you will run out of stuff to spend the gold on if you could lose thousands of gold on BL.
---
Because its funny to watch you try to justify your bottom barrel play.
---
Probably one of the worst parsing warriors on your server with the best weapon in the game, and says to check out his logs. 
---
Its actually hilarious.
---
While gear can make a difference, it doesnt change that Paladins naturally counter rogues based on moveset; Its the same as saying mages naturally counter warriors.
---
I have a hard time believing that. I got brainwashed by all the enh pvp vids. I couldn’t get past level 46 as enh. It wasn’t fun and was taking forever. Friend made me the turtle caster set with LW, so I switched to ele. I was killing things much faster and reliably. I wish I would have switched right at 40. Even if you have to drink every 2-3 mobs, you’re killing them SOOOO much quicker. Enhancement is absolute trash joke of a spec.
---
Edit: Epstein didn’t kill himself

Btw super affordable.
---
oh ok ty for the info!
---
sir this is a wendy's
---
isnt it just cheaper to get wow tokens nowdays anyways?
---
lol
---
Switch to ele it's more fun and you can heal dungeons.
---
Its one of the best balanced servers, but it looks like one side is more organized.
---
I feel like gear would be a big issue. It will take your raid way longer to get raid geares
---
ZT seems pretty perfect.
---
What level did you get it?
---
yes i can confirm this, our guild already have 4 warrior one druid tank, i was in tanking spec dps mc.....bottom of dps chart, felt silly lol
---
There is no Dana there is only Zuul
---
It's not even prime time yet. I'm curious what stormwind will look like for head drop tonight
---
Right, my thought is I spend the majority of my time in dungeons anyways currently, which will only increase once I start raiding. That's why I'm considering the gear options.
---
Anything that heals.
---
I was pretty surprised the servers didn’t crash too. We went in through the side entrance, so maybe that had something to do with it.
---
Fair enough.
---
Nope, it's 144hz. Game is running 300+ fps in non-crowded zones (questing, dungeons, etc.).
---
Shadow Priests are just annoying in dungeons. They can shackle undead and mind control mobs, which is nice, but CC is rarely used. Their damage is nothing crazy but is very high aggro for the numbers it pulls due to mind blast, and if you forego mind blast your dps suffers. Their vampiric embrace makes their threat insanely high, but It’s also one of their main utility points that help justify their lower dps. They also have no aoe and have to resort to multi dotting, which may not be effective if the mobs are killed too soon. 
---
Shadow priests aren’t bad, but as a tank they are definitely the last class I would take for dps for those reasons. I just have to work twice as hard for little return and it’s easier to pick a class with a threat dump or a warlock that can summon and provide aoe damage.
---
So one thing my guild has been doing forever is to screenshot these conversations for record keeping.   Discord is great, but having copies of nasty malicious messages is important.
---
Also you might want to checkout your server's discord, mine has a guild leader section with a player watchlist, they take screenshot proof of bad behavior and essentially give the other GMs on the realm a heads up to watch out for these people.
---
alliance already dead??
---
I thought that's the same with all heals...Play a priest at the moment. Find it the most exciting in scholomance and stratholme because I actually get to cc. Fear ward is also fun to have in Onyxia raid, for a few dungeon bosses and one of MC boss. Mind control can get useful occasionally.
---
If we are really talking about boring heals, I played a shaman heal in WOTLK...There is no downranking. No mana issue. For all raids I just drop totem, spam chain heal and press heroism when asked..and still always end up being one of the top 3 heal.
---
The Illidan story-line was dope af. I definitely started out as a NE myself, back in the day. Honestly probably would have stayed that way but my buddies decided to reroll horde and I jumped on with them and never looked back.
---
Yeah id target one and just absorb hits from the others, kiting back and the two id ignore would drop off after certain range
---
it's confirmation bias.  Both you and /u/Jarymaneleveledup are way more likely to notice the players who take it seriously when it adversely affects you.  If your'e getting camped/ganked or your city is getting raided, that sticks out way more to you than the time you strolled by 5 guys of your faction camping 2 dudes.  You just ride on by.
---
I use the addon ShowMeMyHeal. It shows the the numbers on your screen, but it only shows it in the center of the screen, not in a 3d sense over the players head. Might get annoying as a priest with renews/group healing but I play a paladin so I only ever have 1 heal going out a time so I wouldn't know. I just like using it so that I know when my heals crit and I get that nice mana return back.
---
Anybody from Herod transfer to Heartseeker and having exceptionally long transfer time?
---
Estimate is an hour and I've been waiting longer than 24 now.
---
Am druid, can confirm. Only druid on my raid team. I'm on team B and our A team only has one as well.
---
Cant complain though, easy gear :D
---
I had a druid thank me last night for inviting him to dps. Said he's had to tank every dungeon run up until then (ST). You poor bastards just wanna kill some stuff like everyone else.
---
It is not just mageblade. Preraid bis has like 200+ more spellpower than in vanilla.
---
Sounds like you've been in one shitty loot council, stayed in it for far, far too long after the leadership was shown to be greedy and incompetent, then falsely attributed those characteristics to all Loot Councils. I've been in Loot Council guilds in retail for years, and am now in one in Classic, and I've never had a single guild run their loot council anything like you've described.
---
This is what i do as well and been working great, i just add Thunder clap before i start sunder tab for the sake of mitigation, i also cast SS (regular Arm spec) first then do WW with 2H and switch to 1h/s after, i dont know of its the optimal way but has been working great! Marking your targets can help with prioritizing sunder tabs!
---
Or the tank could use the 1 ability that's basically required to actually tank instead since they'd be waiting till mobs are dead to not pull threat off the tank while the healer would likely be pulling threat constantly. Maybe read what's actually said before posting?
---
I like your style.
---
Bugs out every time I log in but /reload fixes that.
---
it's somewhat a mixture of both obviously but the more problem is low pop servers. of course some classes find groups easier than others
---
Weird, I thought we could not use our mount within Ironforge back in the days...
---
No that is because, whitemane was still layered, many other servers were not though. Most servers won't be affected by this change today because they were already down to 1 layer
---
Yea but for raids warriors overloaded, unless you get into a new guild for a spot
---
If you're not #1 and innervating yourself then you probably shouldn't be innervating yourself, just my 2 copper. I raided a little as a resto druid on p servers but quit because it was beyond boring. 1 button healing got to me. 
---
The thing is that priests main stat is spirit. They have the most to gain by being allowed to regen mana. If you are a true team player then when you start doing progression raids through BWL/AQyou need to innervate the priests because that's what's best for the raids. For now you could innervate the tank and it wouldn't matter. Food for thought brotha
---
What is the most in-demand class now for raids?
---
I see A LOT of mages, warriors.
---
Not so many warlocks and druids.
---
you're wrong buddy
---
There is a piece from brd with 2% crit which is easier to get. I think its the 7 dwarf fight.
---
I want to farm, and even going to like c-list farming spots, they're just camped at 9 AM. 9 fucking AM. So what, instance farming or fight over every single mob is how you make money? It's ridiculous.
---
I thought it has been a bannable offense to abuse los to kill players since last month ..
---
Heard that excuse for years on EVE mate. Try a new one
---
You straight turned that passive aggressive criticism into a glancing blow
---
There is no reason to ever transfer to an outnumbered server. It will ruin your gaming experience.
---
A giant gate to Classic+
---
Again, Rag died to greens, not prebis.  Buffs and consumes have more to do with the current meta of raiding than the gear.
---
I think people rolled on pvp servers expecting them to be friendlier than they are. You have to understand, I come from a UO background. It was a far more punishing game than wow ever was, but it's also what I and a lot of other hardcore folks prefer. I'm not even good at games but it's what I like. I've always enjoyed games with an element of fear and uncertainty paired with dramatic consequences when you lose. That's just me. In UO if you died you had to run back to your corpse to get all of your items, if you didn't they could be taken by any other player and you're left with nothing. For the first years of the game you could be killed any time outside of cities, there were no safe areas. Games are far more forgiving these days, that's what makes games like Dark Souls such a big deal. They're relentless on the players and there is still a crowd out there who enjoys that. I guess a lot of people don't and that's why pve servers exist, and that's why people who roll pvp without knowing what they're getting into are surprised when they aren't as cozy as they're used to. Sorry if you took it as a personal insult, but I can't imagine you're griping about the state of pvp servers as a pve server player. I've seen a ton of griping about pvp servers lately and I think its based on the nature of players these days. They want an easier experience. If you want that too, good for you bud, but don't take the challenge away from those of us who enjoy it.
---
shadow damage dots are affected by shadow and all spell damage.  You must download an addon like extended character stats so you can see your total spell damage gained from your gear for shadow and fire.
---
You compete against your own faction.
---
Instead of a stick, might be nice to try a carrot. There are any number of small rewards that could convince Horde/guilds to move to a lower pop server. 
---
* Free game time
---
* Bonus exp while leveling
---
* Bonus rep gains
---
* Cosmetic anything 
---
If you want Horde to go through the trouble of uprooting themselves, their guild, their friends, you'll get a better response by incentivizing them to do so compared to penalizing them for not making the move.
---
New player here... that 2nd orb looking thing looks like something I recently got from a quest and sold... or destroyed... I don’t remember...
---
What is it and how screwed am I? It looks important lol
---
Druid. Least played class, most in demand in general.
---
Shamans if you're horde.
---
That’s reassuring. Hope so!
---
You can't make everyone happy. Reddit is not a single person or entity. What will make one camp happy, will anger another. The people are speaking up will always be the people who are unhappy; because no one comes to a forum to make a post saying everything is fine.  
---
As someone who transferred when they first opened I have no regrets. I recommend any who does not want to wait in a queue or anyone who wants an experience closer to 2005 than a private server to go ahead and transfer. You won't regret it. 
---
In terms of shit showing up on this board good moderation will fix a lot of the 'noise' but moderators are only human too.  There is a reason we don't have a direct connection to Blizzard team through Reddit like the /r/pathofexile or /r/warframe guys do.
---
There's a teens/early 20's definition of hardcore and theres mans definition of hardcore.
---
“Probably”
---
If I tried to steal something from someone I would deserve it.
---
I wouldn't say it was that short for me... but the forming part took &gt;1 hour while the raid it's self was very short. 
---
My guild is still trying to figure out what works for us in MC. 8/10 so far with a 3 hour raid.

People in vanilla used consumes raids too. They were not braindead like everyone here assumes for some reason. You think somebody wiping 80 days on Rag didnt think of maybe bringing an elixir and some food xd?
---
Whether or not they're necessary doesn't mean they aren't being consumed.  People like to parse high, people use them to increase clear times, people use them as a health buffer because they have 6 world buffs and don't wanna risk losing them.
---
The fact is, they're being used, there is a finite supply and a higher demand than the supply can handle, and demand will only increase.  Supply has to increase.
---
I think you’re right, it’s the first time they’ve tried this and I think it’s a test to see how it goes. Honestly I don’t know how to fix the issue without causing other problems. I wish they’d remove the right to choose your server but then you’d lose the option to roll with your friends/guild.
---
Broken Blade represent!
---
They could turn off layering anytime. There are queues to so many servers right now, at like 2pm on a tuesday. That probably wasnt part of the plan.
---
I was hoping someone would remember the old ways.
---
Is aoe leveling with a mage better tan normal questing?
---
Ele is way better, I didn’t make the switch until 52 and I regretted not doing it earlier. You can kill 3-4 mobs before drinking, use elemental mastery on cd and make sure you are using chain lightning and instantly earth shock so both crit. Find a mage to make you some water, if not, worst case you spend a bit more gold on water but it’s well worth it.
---
You can  go half and half, not having shadow form but still have silence and mind flay. Your DPS should be fine and healing BRD shouldn't be hard at all with 20 or so points in holy.
---
You can still heal Sunkemn Temple, Mara, and the first half of BRD with ease while shadow. Just make sure to have lots of intelligence
---
It's the truth, you dougnut...
---
I healed the first half of BRD as a 55 Spriest with quest gear and a few crafted rares. It was definitely at the high end of my healing capacity. ST you should be fine with an at-level group.
---
Wasn't there a point in time, circa 2002 where hardcore became emo?
---
I just don't see what the issue is with Honor being released before literally every single person is level 60.  Like, you aren't level 60, you pay the price. It's not that big of a price.
---
Unfortunately I don’t have herbing, but I’ve never heard of those trolls as a farm so might look into that.
---
100% agree brain dead as fuck so happy to switch things up, just didn’t think dm would be worth it without herbing
---
Yea banter in dungeons is fine but raid time banter with 40 people very quickly gets out of control. Leaders aren't being assholes they are trying to herd 40 cats into a cohesive unit.
---
remember kids; Blizzard will not give 2 fucks if this guy scams you, and will do absolutely nothing to help you.
---
All the former huntards are now magetards.
---
Its universal across all servers. My guild has more druids than hunters which is kinda crazy.
---
I really hope every single server shits the bed during phase 2 so their ops team can freak out on our behalf.
---
Hyooge
---
Make sure you have dibs on that seat next semester when you're retaking the class.
---
No lag?
---
So did most of us. The problem was, the only posts we saw were the people getting messaged by GM's for being on top of the Gadgetzan arena. That didn't stop people from being just SLIGHTLY out of range of the guards in certain locations and being able to freely kill with zero repercussions. The big one is in Winterspring where you buy the patterns from Qia. You could outrange the guards at level 60 and kill the opposing faction trying to camp the patterns and it wouldn't pull aggro. This post finally addresses that issue. 
---
I know I saw a few posts on here, even posted my own where I brought it up and a lot of people had the "well it's not against TOS because you're just outside of the guards range!" despite knowing it was not the intended reaction of the guards.
---
can u link me something? Blue post for example
---
Hmm if they can change for what was authentically intended, does that mean they will fix all the bugs since bugs were obviously not intended in the game (and were eventually fixed after this patch version)
---
Nice. Now get 300 Blacksmithing (choose Axesmith) so you can profit from crafting Nightfall as soon as it's released.
---
Ikr? Mine is def not laggy but this is smooth as butter.
---
Oh shit, different people have different opinions. What a world we live in...
---
Spawns were adjusted though. If you played on day 1 you would know spawn timers definitely adjust 
---
I'm not sure if it's based on the number of people in the area, the time the mob dies after spawn or what, but it definitely varies
---
I have 0 regrets about rolling a hunter. The leveling process was amazing and fast, you care less about gear than any other class while leveling, you have no competition for the only thing you do care about: your ranged  weapon, really cool extra content in the pet system, and you do fantastically in the first tier of raids (both ony and mc have range exclusive moments). Plus I lucked out and might guild has only 1 other hunter raiding besides me right now, so I'm rolling in loot! We have a ton of mages and warrior though
---
Is it feasible for characters to gain any Cenarion Circle rep at this stage of the game?  Or will that only come with AQ and the fleshing out of Silithus quests?
---
I've been checking the AH regularly for a herb satchel, which tailors can buy the pattern for at Friendly.  But never seen one yet, so I'm wondering.
---
Yeah I got disconnected as Alliance, it’s not like lag is faction exclusive
---
Have you made sure you are using an up to date version? When I first downloaded it did not show g2 in UBRS (which was a known issue) but since I got the newest version (from curse forged) it's been fine.
---
Never come across that raid problem of 3 people not showing thought, sorry.
---
Like other people said, it's a very safe alternative.  If you're having trouble killing mobs your level I'd definitely do green quests.  Most of the quests I did while leveling up were green and not yellow.  However, you're taking a pretty big XP loss (over a long period of time) by killing green mobs and not yellow.  You really want to be killing mobs your level, it's actually crazy how much the XP difference winds up being.
---
I feel bad for whoever's money you're wasting.
---
That's not a loot council problem, that's a guild problem. You can spread out the loot distribution even easier with a loot council, it's just up to them to do it.
---
Oh you don't have to tell me that, it's clear as day even from horde-side.
---
Earth bind kiting doesn’t work in retail how it did on private servers.
---
Totally agree I’ve had some
---
Good scraps on HS with Horde and the skill level is above average. Kinda makes me miss being the under dog on a realm.
---
Tribute is significantly harder. I've done 53 of them according to deadly boss mod. I feel like I have it down like clockwork, and I still die every 2-3 runs. I'll get unlucky, or I'll get careless and get myself killed. That isnt counting the 2 times i had to go to town and repair the first day learning it.
---
What server were you on? Most US servers were already down to one layer, it's possible yours in unaffected
---
I mean... What is the difference between that and them hoarding mats for Phase 2 and phase 3 before the recipes or content they are for is released?
---
Lol in classic thuderbluff getting raided might actually be an improvement
---
What level was the guy that helped u? 
---
It's not about ur level its about the guys level that helped u. If the mobs were 19-20 the guy helping u would have to be level 24 max, if he is higher then 24 u wouldnt get full exp.
---
However at 20 it changes to 6 levels. So on the 20 mobs he could be 26 and u would still get full exp
---
Mathematically, the bulk of players' -mains- will def be 40+ unless they are doing the 'lvl 3 chars at the same time' strat.
---
40 can be est about 5 days played, and we're at what, 2 months? 60 days, about 2 hrs a day.  I'd say most people actively playing will be doing at least that.
---
Not pickin an argument, just wanted to point that out.
---
Does this also increase the distance mobs appear from you?
---
insane amounts of lag. literally a 3-4 second delay inside of ironforge. blizzard needs to fix their shit
---
Earth bind kiting doesn’t work on classic like it did on private servers.
---
As far as I know yea, dk's no impact on future honor, just a huge negative for that week
---
I think civilians mostly have long respawns so you might have to find some friends and do a circuit killing a bunch
---
I prefer to charge in using a sword and board.  If I have a lot of rage and am in bezerk stance a whirlwind and cleave is great as well. 
---
I'm far from an expert but with experimenting I have typically relied on the following:
---
- mark priority target with skull (binding to F1 helps)  mark further as needed.
---
- pull with bow or charge with shield/1h equipped, depending on situation
---
- demo shout, possible thunderclap, switch to defensive stance
---
- stack sunder on each mob, one at a time, use cleaves if there's an abundance of rage
---
- intim any mob that breaks off, unless it's low health
---
Next time use please correct datum format witch is:
---
DD/MM/YYYY
---
Murica
---
That's the truth. I am at 5/8 T1 and my T2 helm. Only raided three times so far.
---
The dire mail wasn't planned to be a single patch, so yeah, not the first real patch.
---
I would pay To read a wow comic book drawn by you
---
Well the other thing is that even if PVP is your focus you are likely still going to need to be in a pve guild to get the best gear for pvp
---
You can war stomp in boomkin form?? Amazing
---
you misunderstand me, it's not camera zoom i'm on about, i'm on about the drawing of players and mobs.  I have the game running at entirely max settings but i can only see npcs and players up to around 50 yards away like its day 1 on ely...
---
You did though; you displaced the goalposts once you realized you were wrong. Sheeps will last 15+ seconds, enough to bandage+drink. You can also just sheep again on top of it if you need more drinking. 
---
It sounds like you don't know your class. :D
---
None of the other ones were defended, what’s your point?
---
Boomer
---
Woah, you know Ben too?
---
On wowhead it says P5.  I didn't think it required exalted tho.
---
LOL you did not hold of shit dude :D  we killed all your bosses!  and you had no chanse even tho the server was lagging so hard!
---
thanks my man
---
Why even show up? If you don't need to pay attention, you might as well stay home where you have ample deskspace and a mouse.
---
Once you have pvp trinket for fear break or if you're undead you can just block if u fail to fake and cast poly when the lockout is over
---
Was fun raiding you guys \^\_\^ keep pretending you "held us off". Top kek.
---
what server are you on, if it's a crazy busy city it might make sense, but even then your gear should be performing better
---
I don't think that works out, because otherwise when comparing ranged weapons, then you would get the most advantage of hitting enemies that have hunter's mark a higher number of times and pick the faster bow when comparing similar dps weapons.  
---
I'm still riding that a Hunter's mark debuff is going to boost the raid DPS by the number of hunters multiplied by 8dps and not 20 dps.  If you got some other tests or combat logs analysis out there I am willing to look at it.  Can we agree on that in the end, Hunter's mark is not used in raid encounters?
---
EM and NS are both expected to heal in group PvP and it's considered a support spec. It's actually one of the most complex roles in the game IMO.
---
It's simple. Get a healbot or reroll, because Warriors are garbage by themselves.
---
Magni was the only defended boss and you guys wiped on him
---
Those greens didnt exist 15 years ago.
---
I'm horde on Wesfall, FML.
---
At least it's not pvp server.
---
Except all the tanks I’ve run with I guess?
---
You're in denial...
---
It makes a difference in that one is wrong and one is right.  Nothing more, nothing less.
---
This is honestly bullshit. People have real lives. Most of us are in our late 20s or 30s. That means we have SOs, kids, careers, houses, etc. 
---
If it were my guild, I'd delay your promotion to raider / core raider, which is our highest normal raiding rank until you showed better attendance, but I'd never kick. And even if you are gone for a month, I'd just demote you to friends / family rank, and you could apply again and start a trial if you needed to.
---
Are you saying they aren't going to release phases via patches? Because ok. I guess I'm wrong. But that would mean there are no planned patches and none have occurred to date.
---
Was fun wiping you
---
no they aren't
---
???? " This guy only said 2 words, he needs to grow up" ????

Hes an asshole and deserves to get kicked.  Be strong and tough in these situations.  If others want to leave, emphasize recruitment and let them know you dont fuck around

You can definitely get some, because the wolf and bears quest in wpl gives it.

High salt content in your diet fellah?
---
You're trying to compare dealing with pedophiles to dealing with people taking video game items they shouldn't? Are you serious?
---
I had no idea it even happened as a horde. It can be hard to tell what's going on, would have helped with my 60 if I had known.
---
I just dont understand you. The only time hunter as a class is top parsing dps meters amongst good players is BM hunters in TBC. In vanilla they cannot compete after mc and bwl.
---
Lol why so salty? 
---
When did i say hunters don't drop off in later phases? 
---
Touchy, touchy. Cheer up.
---
right, but that doesn't disagree with or detract from the point i was making in my previous post
---
Im a NE hunter currently speccd as BM for leveling but planned to swap to marksman. I don’t think I have any best in slot items tbh.. lol
---
Well, yeah.
---
If you *just* grind it gets boring, but it can be a great way to break up the monotony of endlessly running the same dungeon purely for the sake of leveling your pet.
---
Same with the Alliance that toughed it out on Stalagg.
---
They also designed it and tested it to have macros and addons, isn’t that funny?
---
&gt; what I learned is that tanking on a Warrior isn’t hard once you’ve spent a couple minutes setting up some macros. 
---
Macros are useless when you're rage starved constantly.  Especially &lt; lvl 30
---
Ah the mythical boomkin. I never knew they existed as players.
---
This^ 100% 
---
The gear and talents are nutty now, and the content truly wasn’t designed with this in mind at the time. We’re steamrolling this stuff by old standards.

Rag kills pre submerge weren’t a thing, or rarely were a thing. That’s the “hard” part too, so 🤷🏼‍♂️

Guards have LoS like any other npc/mob. If you stand outside of their LoS they won't attack you.

This fix apparently changes that.

I use the Steelseries Rival 500 MMO mouse.
---
[https://steelseries.com/gaming-mice/rival-500](https://steelseries.com/gaming-mice/rival-500)
---
The big difference, compared to a lot of other MMO mice, the multiple thumb buttons are more natural, easier to hit correctly every time. Plus additional buttons are on the top, next to your fingers, so you don't need your thumb for everything. The button layout on the Steelseries is way more natural in actual use than other MMO mice, where they try to pack 12 similar sized buttons under the thumb.
---
The server crashed you did not hold shit stop talking shit man :D
---
&gt;Your WS is calculated every week during the Tuesday server patch.  
---
&gt;The person with the most CP's for the week on your side will have a WS of 1. The next highest CP score will have a WS of 2. And so on...
---
Sounds like Honor brackets are determined by comparing you to other players in your faction.
---
I was in DM the other night.  Sprinted to the other side of the dungeon (we already cleared it) before I popped vanish.  Mob chase me down all that way before I could get to entrance to escape.  This happened 4 times before I finally handed in the quest.  
---
It genuinely isnt working.  Its also broken in BRD (ie. group wipes, you've run a long distance away, pop vanish, but still in combat and mobs chase you down while stealthed).
---
can’t wait for the alliance to come out of the woodworks and fuck the hell out of horde camping instances
---
bro im fucking level 33 dont talk about late
---
The fact that people think this is a story that anybody would bother to make up is beyond sad. But you all carry on.
---
I'm about as nochanges as can be, but I think that resolving exploits may have to be the exception. For instance, I worry about BG's because terrain exploits which were relatively uncommon in 2005, have the potential to become meta if they're not addressed.
---
I think it's an inevitable necessity that these sorts of changes will occur, and it's okay as long as they're made in the least invasive way possible. If it meant giving guards a new ability, or allowing them to teleport, that would have been entirely unacceptable. However, it's hard to imagine anyone will be noticeably affected by a slight increase in shooting range, aside from those who purposefully exploit terrain.
---
You don't have the necessary rep with the goblins for them to defend you but the Gnome must have. You need friendly+ to get help from guards.
---
Warlocks are probably highest demand. They've got great utility, they're good for any/all fights, and they're extremely useful for certain pulls/bosses in MC. Most groups want at least 4-5 Warlocks, and it feels like everyone rolled mage instead, so I know a lot of guilds are recruiting them.
---
"I need to login through my phone to sit in queue. We should make other servers be forced to transfer to this server."
---
The server crashed for everyone but apparently this is only a horde problem
---
Very helpful, We did Screenshot this conversation for future reference.
---
There are a lot more than just that
---
Runescape reference
---
Yea sure. Even more importantly, it has the Of Love and Family questline, so everyone's more or less bound to go there sooner or later.
---
Anywho, you are right about the Unforgiven. At this point he almost just belongs to Strat UD as much in my mind, even if it requires a slight detour, because I feel like UD is generally just more worth your while, at least if excluding the orbs.
---
this is more of an issue around application design than it is in server resources...
---
Assuming you are using macros to power shift it's probably an issue with the macro. Feral druid in my guild was having the same issue until he reworked his power shift macros.
---
Aw are you going to be ok? Heh you’re all so dramatic over a story you for some reason don’t want to believe.

For the easiest MC run you want warlocks and warriors and 2 to 4 mages, and shamans for windfury for each melee group. There's a large abundance of mages, but there's never ever quite enough warriors, and I think warlocks are actually kinda scarce

What server has a 2 hour que time? I play on Herod and it’s at most an hour during peak time and raid days. More often than not, there’s no que.

And you guys are just talking about 2 different people. Ya there’s plenty of people that could give two shots about their server population and just want to ply the game. There’s also plenty of people that give a shit about their servers health and longevity
---
Kurinnaxx alliance, we've got at least 5 guilds with backlogs of heads, and at least two are trying to turn it in at 5:30–5:45 pretty much every day.

Killing Azuregos is going to come down to who’s guild gets there on time/first, and if you can defend against the opp faction.

His loot table is better so it’ll be hotly camped and contested. I’m already seeing “AzureSlave” and “Kazzakslave” names in GenChat

LOL, seriously? Yes, obv we can assume anyone who is either on the Reddit or Discord is much more serious than people who are not.

The comment section of the forum post is already starting up with "this is hurting the game! my friends and I loved doing this in vanilla!"

A cohesive story not just series of unrelated drawing.
---
Jesus, that's unreal!
---
I'm on Firemaw (which is Full), this only happens on crowded areas where I point on crowds and have the camera zoomed out (so it has to render as many ppl as possible).
---
My friends like PvE, so I’ve always played both. Not a problem you have I imagine.
---
Level 24 warlock. Should I be multi-dotting mobs with voidwalker at this point, or be using succubus and single-targeting them down one by one?
---
Ironically my guild has too many druids (3 healers and 2 feral/offtanks).in our raids haha.
---
wouldn't be too bad - majority of healing is HT, and one druid can't rejuv the whole raid.  One or two could spec for crit regrowth for massive dmg spikes.  The only thing you'd be lacking is a renew on the tanks in general, and 6+ healers with NS, innervate, brez would probably do decent.
---
You mean you stood around and rubber banded into the enemy and eventually they left?
---
Thunder Clap can only be used in Battle Stance, as the other poster said, it does little to no damage, and you actively REDUCE the amount of rage you're gaining by using it. I know people like it in retail, because it has AoE threat gen, but in Classic there are other alternatives that I think will server most tanks better. Thunder Clap definitely has it's place, but it's not something I use every single pull. And even if I do use it, I at least wait for Berserker's Rage to fall off, so it's several GCD's into my pull.
---
Horde? On alliance there's still a bunch of hunters.
---
Some do, but it doesnt work very well. While it's nice that these skeletal mages keep respawning, this insane ghoul still takes a full 10 minutes. Not so bad when 5 or less people are there because you can group for the kill, but when 46 people are there you might as well just log out
---
missing NSFW tag. Reminds me of those horror videos of failing elevators in high rises.
---
Just said he doesn't know anything about it. Hmn.
---
Can they fix this for Moonglade too?
---
Hrrm hrrm you guys didn’t hold us? We ran IF&gt;Daranassus&gt;Stormwind than back to IF then almost everyone got DC in the raid I was a in!Keep lying to yourself bro.
---
Are you arms? Do you have sweeping strikes? If so:  
---
Charge &gt; White Hit &gt; Sweeping Strikes &gt; Zerker Stance &gt; Whirlwind &gt; Def stance &gt; sunder spam
---
That tends to hold everything pretty good. Weave in a tclap if you can afford to before the switch to zerker. Throw some demo/battle shouts out as you begin weaving your sunders.
---
Finally.
---
Everyone who abused it knew it was wrong and against TOS, but they did it anyway because Blizzard never TRUELY talked about their spot specifically. Once the top of the arena got shut down, they just found other spots and claimed "well THIS one is okay!"
---
Blizzard finally addressing the whole issue. Camping Qia for the runecloth bag pattern on my tailor was absolute torture.
---
Spell power greens weren't a thing when classic released.
---
&gt; Can we agree on that in the end, Hunter's mark is not used in raid encounters?
---
Already agreed with you there lol, we just disagree on how many hunters you'd need to make it viable.
---
I pm'd you a link to a hunter damage sim, you can check it yourself there
---
Sunder and taunt are gained by a quest

What? I thought I was going to have to grind to revered? You positive? I guess the recipes just aren't on sale yet until a later phase?

I am out for the +15 agility to weapon. But if you're saying I don't have to grind to you revered(and you're right) god bless you.
---
Guild's Token boomie, had to hit 60 before tonight's MC. We out here!
---
Alliance side here, best part of earthfury honestly is its a large enough server to find groups for whatever you want, and small enough that you start to get know everyone on both sides.
---
Its the perfect server imo, you might have to pay a little more on the ah with smaller overall supply, but its worth it imo.
---
I believe the changing IP from travelling suspensions are only short
---
Yeah honestly if you're a noob and want easy PVP you should roll Horde anyways.
---
Horde basically run PVP with a handicap. They have higher populations which means less fear of being ganked due to balance issues with numbers routinely in your favor *and* you also have ez-mode pvp racials.
---
There would be a huge backlash with all of those incentives because they were not available to all people equally.
---
Additionally, they do absolutely nothing to address the faction imbalance on the server in the meantime while the transfers are playing out which I'm still not convinced they wouldn't.
---
Limiting the number of server slots per faction instantly fixes the in game disparity.
---
Pick any three as long as it includes corruption.  9 times out of 10 CoA-&gt;Siphon-&gt;Corruption as these can all be instant, so you can run a bit closer to your second target while you DoT up your first.  When Amp Curse is up I'd drop it to just CoA+Corruption, as Siphon is only good because it helps you tank, and Amp CoA helps kill quickly.  Add immolate only if your targets aren't at &lt;10% when fear fades.

Question: where did you get these stock style maps from? Because some of the latter expac in-dungeon maps (scholomance comes to mind) don't match up with their classic versions.
---
Arms does not always mean MS spec. There's arms raiding specs without MS.
---
Thanks a lot for the thoughtful reply. Definitely makes a lot of sense. I hadn't considered closely the PvP aspect, but as that's something I really enjoy I may have to go with the epic mount.
---
One more question. The lucky drop from Mag in MC, is that Eskhandar's Right Claw you're talking about? I'm orc, so giving up the +5 axes bonus is a pretty tough sell.
---

A dude created a tool that combs warcraftlogs and estimates faction balance that way, so it's disingenuous to suggest we have no data and it's all "feeling".  Is it perfect?  Of course not.  But with the number of people playing and the number of logs being uploaded - especially for the big servers like Herod, Skeram, Faerlina, etc. - its going to be at least directionally accurate.  
---
The fact is we DO have statistics to work from, so don't claim we don't.  And if you know anything about statistics, a huge part of working with data is filling in gaps using reasonable assumptions.  It's ridiculous to suggest we can't draw conclusions without perfect data coming straight from Blizzard.  If that were true, scientific study as we know it would cease to exist.

This is the way to go.
---
You can't just join a well established guild that has MC on farm and expect to get a spot in the raid. 
---
Instead look for guilds that are still  using PUGs to fill and need another 10-15 players to form their core raiding group.  Start showing up on time and make sure you are prepared with all of your consumables, as well as paying attention and listening to the raid leader.  
---
If things go well, stick around and you will become a core member of the raiding group.  If things are going bad, raid leader sucks, players are not listening or everything seems hostile and unfun, then scout out a different guild that is still forming their core group.
---
Having a good Raid Leader makes everything more enjoyable.  Some people have that gift to get everyone on the same page with just a few words.  Others have to scream and yell at everyone and accomplish nothing but drama.
---
No, this guy is a rogue. A warrior won the roll in his pug, and this guy then parroted that this isn't good for warriors and refused to loot it to the warrior who won.
---
This guy knows what he's on about, +1
---
Flying mount.
---
Do you get 144fps even on crowded areas like shown in picture though (and pointing at the crowd with the camera)? IF/SW basically.
---
Hands down the axes, they're the only viable options from that list. 
---
Epic mount - almost useless for a prot warrior, we can't go quest, we don't go to the open world, and if I'm running a dungeon it's either for guildies (so I demand my summon) or it's in BRM, so it's not very far. While I really, REALLY want my epic mount, it's something I've been putting off for a long time just because it has minimal gain and the price never changes. The longer the game goes on, the easier this will be to obtain, so there's no point in rushing to it. 
---
Lionheart Helm - if you were a DPS, this would never get replaced, in which case I'd say buy it now, especially since it's so cheap (it's \~1100-1150g on my server). As a tank, your T2 from Onyxia is better, and the gear from subsequent phases only continues to pull ahead, so I would say this isn't a priority. 
---
Axes - Still not the BEST choice in my opinion for a tank, but pretty solid since they'll last for a while and free up Deathbringer for your DPS Warriors (who I promise will appreciate it). 
---
If you want my personal opinion? Top thing to do as a tank with money is get Myrmidon's Signet. You'll use that ring until Phase 4/5 at least unless you get Exalted with AV, so I think it's well worth the 200g.
---
Has nobody cast curse of tongues on you yet?
---
It was not.
---
Yeah, that's what we were making fun of.   The guy literally said "can't make everyone happy" which implies different people have different likes/dislikes.
---
How are the side buttons on it? It looks like they aren't angled enough so it'd be easy to hit the wrong buttons or is it fine?
---
Im talking about "who casts in melee range" how is that not clear?
---
Yah, i kind of wish I rolled on a rp-pvp server.   The toxic people avoided those servers.
---
? I’m on literally every night and there’s rarely alliance in org, let alone “dominating it.” 
---
I get you’re in an over saturated server, with easily 10 times the usual players due to multi layer and heavy horde skew so you just don’t get how WoW classic should actually be, but you don’t need to exaggerate.
---
finally. i can finally wait a qia with 15 people macroing for her recipes to upsell in AH in peace.
---
Yeah. My 32 Druid is already almost friendly with them. A lot of the druid quests give this rep. 
---
My 60 warrior only has like 700 towards Friendly, but I think there's ways to gain more, I just don't know off the top of my head what they are.
---
&gt; after declaring, before the raid, that only Rogues will roll on Vis'kag
---
The warrior broke the loot rules by rolling at all.
---
Yep you were correct! Someone just helped me out in the Thunderfury discord.
---
These macro's don't have the problem :

---
/cast !Dire Bear Form
---
Depends on. what level you are, but was it the red orb from scholomance quests? You need it to see the undead around scholomance, which is useful for a couple quests and to repair near the instance (otherwise you have to travel to the bulwark or something).  
---
If you don't care about that (or if it's not that key) then don't worry about it.
---
Agreed. The faction balance is really good on Faerlina. Maybe a bit more horde but it’s pretty even. Plus the streamers make up a very small part of the population.
---
It's sad. I have a 60 warrior and I'm leveling a mage now. Turns out leveling isn't hard, being a warrior is.
---
Any particular reason the survey didn't ask what realm you're on?
---
There's more likely to be a huge backlash with artificially inflated que times or other penalties that don't target all people equally...
---
Your solution might work on a fresh server but not one with established guilds and communities.
---
Why not bring a random Druid to heal? 50-100g on T2 helm drop, or even be friendly and give it to them. We run multiple Ony groups and always try and make sure that someone could use every T2 helm. Also try splitting up people that have and don’t have, so we don’t have one group with 8 mages needing it, and another with 3 T2 helms already.
---
Grenades lips and faps are important Druid pvp items.
---
Obligatory nostalrius did it with a fraction of the budget and team.
---
There is no key in classic with that icon, you should be fine =)
---
I remember 4 manning Azuregos back in Vanilla with my alt mage, a warlock / voidwalker tank, a priest healer, and a DPS warrior.  
---
Getting the tag is basically going to mean GG like you said unless PVP happens.

That explains a lot actually.

The trinket is not amazing or OP, but it is cool and you can be happy that there are very few people that will have it!

Boomkin form gives as much bonus armor as Dire Bear form....... Boomkin tank IS possible
---
Go elememe. Far superior. Drinks less as well.
---
You are correct friend.
---
It's just this large scale domino effect which leaves many casual minded players as collateral damage - The players who are purely playing for fun are always the ones to suffer the rough end of the stick - biggest problem with that is, they simply stop playing, and the hardcore players just reroll on a different server.
---
it's just a vicious circle.
---
Yeah, level squish totally indicates that Thrall will be the Warchief. Especially since he literally established a leading council and said he wouldn't lead the Horde again. The squish is 100% not happening because the current leveling is shit. /s
---
Well any decent warrior on a pvp realm should have some plate pieces.
---
God go read this thread again. 
---
In the example in question, the warrior is in melee range and just popped FAP. You are saying to sheep him. How are you getting out of melee range?
---
Are you ESL or something
---
K.
---
last time I checked Bronzebeard was still alive and you guys were escaping to trams :3
---
But the cenarion/gadgetzan guards still don't have enough range to prevent my devilsaurs from being ninjaskinned by horde
---
Just think people cleared all the content not wearing the most optimal items for their classes 🧐
---
Go into your options under the social tab, and check "block guild invites" and "block chat channel invites".
---
I'm 100% aware of the new stats.  APES cleared MC with a ton of sub 60s and in green gear.  I don't know how much better their gear was compared to vanilla 60s who had been grinding MC for a while.  My point is that gear is only a minor aspect.  It contributes but the fact that APES did not craft Fire Resist gear prior to Rag speaks volumes.
---
That is wise! Thank you very much!
---
And here I am, more Ony kills than I can count... and only seen 1 priest helm. 
---
We shard Druid gear like it’s going out of style...
---
Memestrike. Stunt on them hoes
---
I did the grind too. Sat there for a good few hours, gave up a few times and came back until I finally got it. 
---
The macro is pretty easy if you want it, you just need to bind "interact with target". After that, you don't even really need a macro, just have her selected, hit interact with, check for the pattern, close the window and repeat.
---
The real problem is the pattern is mixed in with 5 other random spawns and who knows what the timer is. I bought so many of the other patterns before FINALLY getting it.
---
The Mag drop wouldn't affect him unless he's drowning in hit gear. Most orcs don't actively gear for that though, so would require a pretty big shift in gear priorities, which isn't always plausible. 
---
Only "lucky" drop that he could get would be Deathbringer, from Onyxia, but I've never seen that drop after killing her for 6-7 weeks now, nor have I ever seen anyone wielding it, and all the DPS warriors will want the same thing from her, so buying Axe of the Deep Woods now would help them out by moving him down the priority list for Deathbringer.
---
i was in the same situation, i got fed up with rends, its hard enough for rogues to get into a group and if you do get in one  you have to hope the sword drops and you win the roll ... after about 20 runs of no luck i decided to buy the sword of zeal. it usually went for 200g ish on my server and Krol is going for 400-500g 
---
Going a faster on my mount will not save me that much time so i made the choice of getting myself a better sword (was running trash/myrah's)
---
I got lucky and ended buying a Krol blade for 240g from  someone posted in trade chat that they had one for sale .
---
i dont regret the decision. i'm not in any rush of getting my epic mount, its not going to change my life drastically to run faster when im mounted.
---
Wondering who you're trying to convince here. Them, or you?
---
Yea, I don't think that does anything really.
---
I noticed in the chat group invite title that it stated $-&gt;gold ratio. I mentioned the rate to a friend on Discord and his reply was that it was a scam. Reason being that IGN is selling for a much higher price. 
---
So if it is a scam... then they wouldn't care in the least how much they're being undercut.
---
I literally Just Death ray'd crit someone for 4K in gadgetzen while 3 guards were there next to me and they did nothing
---
Great advice, I had a lot of the same thoughts about the epic mount (hence the post). 
---
Seriously, thanks for the tips. I hadn't even considered the Myrmidon's Signet, but my rings are by far the worst pieces of my current setup. Sounds like a slam dunk... I'll check out prices on my server later this evening.

you cant drink while in combat. the sheep will pop once you leave combat. you cant repeatedly sheep because it's less effective everytime, after the 3rd it literally dont work at all. dont say this is TBC because it's the way it is in classic. holy fuck youre inbred. HAHAHAHAHA :ddedd &lt; dont talk like that either you dumb fuckin inbred. WHERES THE VIDEO?

I can be tough to aoe lvl on high pop servers. The good areas are well known and usually crowded in my experience
---
Are  you familiar with with a supply and demand graph and what the intersection represents?
---
The only thing getting fucked in this video is the server.
---
You won't pull more than 1-2 mobs, so single target.
---
I've been doing pretty well as dps warrior might have been lucky though but can still tank 5 mans with some tanking gear if you gear yourself up with both.
---
It's faster, but only if there's no competition for mobs in a certain selection of very specific grinding spots. I leveled a mage on one of the lowest population servers, checked grinding spots every time I was nearby (mostly during non-peak hours) and they were always camped. Your mileage may vary.
---
You forgot to mention Déjà Vu.
---
No need to get abusive just because you said something stupid.
---
You literally said you don't know why people say hunter dps sucks, then talked about Ony.
---
People saying hunter dps sucks.........IN NAXX.
---
No one has said hunter dps sucks in Ony and if they have they are stupid.
---
&gt; We also get slightly more then 1dps from 14 ap because of the 15% speed from our quivers
---
Then why did you put forth this as a fact if you contradict it?  
---
&gt;ap gives dps not damage, doesn't matter how fast you hit ap increases dps exactly the same amount
---
That was not what happened. He changed his story after the fact. There was no statement made about viskag before the boss was killed.
---
Yah unzipped me doc!
---
Does it work with dots? If so then this would be great for a lock.
---
Pretty full T1 also, that backstab is gonna be HUGE.
---
BFA should have ended with Nzoth consuming Azeroth’s world soul, enslaving everyone on the planet, and the last ditch effort to save the planet is for Chromie to send you back to the beginning to change it for the better...
---
yea and there are dead servers already. I'll admit I was heavily against layering. But I'll admit I was wrong. I knew we would need something like it, but my doubt was that it would actually get removed by phase 2. I'm happily wrong about this one
---
Hm interesting. But I don’t see any players running around either
---
In best scenario, where you know what to do and where to do - it's faster.  
---
On average, focused quest runs are better.
---
Jesus christ, sort out your gamma value
---
Try aptechka, not very modifiable, but the default is fine for me
---
Oh sweet summer child, the Arms warriors haven't even come out to play yet, we have been laying in wait, DPSing as fury so that we can get the PVP gear needed for this phase of content.  We will be respeccing Thursday ..... Let me fix your quote here:
---
The advantage ~~and survivability~~  you get with ~~plate~~ Mortal Strike/Overpower/Execute and a slow, slow 2h weapon is what makes a warrior a warrior. 
---
Prepare for a deep dickin'
---
Sincerely,
---
Arms warriors.
---
dps warriors have alot room in raids and can also tank 5man and 10man easily so that is probably best bet
---
;) we've had a lot of them drop (4-6 smth) but priests in our guild still needs them, this was an 11 man onxyia kill though and the priests with us already had it
---
what new servers have opened recently? they created a few more in the first week when the mass rush to get in was happening but haven't since
---
\+1
---
Dude where are you standing to get that screenshot? Great view.
---
My memory might fool me, but iirc a bunch of stats didn't even exist in the beginning, like attack power items and such. Especially the greens "of shadow. wrath" etc, only the animals like monkey, eagle, bear
---
Unlikely, epic mount price is like a third of the total materials required, it wouldn't increase the farming speed by anywhere near 50%. Of course, the benefit would be actually having an epic mount for the future.
---
The trick is to go elemental and delete mobs and players with EleM spellbatching
---
Apparently 50-60g.
---
No, not too late.
---
You wanted the best and you got the best. The hottest band in the world... KISS!!!
---
Shocker, raid BiS is not always viable in PvP.  Surprising no one, ever.  Healer BiS gear is so weighted towards +healing, it's insane.  You can gain 1k health and sometimes 2k mana by wearing a set more optimized for pvp.
---
Except Skeram isn't even an 80/20 after all the dodgers left lmao
---
I know, I've run one myself with slam, flurry and sweeping strikes. It was pretty great in MC with worldbuffs and naxx gear.
---
Im Horde EU also, struggle to find groups half the time on this supposedly full server. Is it still layered?
---
If something is at my house, that means it's real and has actual value. A lawn chair had to be built somewhere, shipped to a store, bought by me and I put it there. If I landscape my front yard, and someone else wants to copy that IDEA, they can. an IDEA costs me nothing when they choose to replicate it. If a musician wants to make money selling merch and tickets to concerts, or get ad revenue from live streams, that's real things they sell that other people can't. That's their product.
---
dire maul came out when it was supposed to, everything else in phase 2 was delayed because of layers
---
Jesus. Is there a link for any of this or just hearsay?
---
Low level areas are still pretty busy. Lots of players level multiple characters. Join them and have fun!
---
You want as much spellpower as possible.
---
Get convection and clearcasting, with elemental mastery.
---
The only ways to make your spells more efficient is to make them stronger with stacking spellpower. The fewer casts per mob you need the more mana efficient you become and faster you kill things.
---
Also, use a shield.
---
the real Guild Wars
---
paladin tanks aren't bad until you get to raids and the vast majority of paladin tanks are tanking to gear up in dungeons and will never step foot into a raid as prot. that said I'm 20/31 prot and am my guilds top healer when I'm in healing mode and tank just fine in the raid encounters they ask me to. it's extremely fun, versatile, and the flexibility provides a lot of value to the raid. I guarantee you im not holding anybody back
---
We need to get rid of rule 7. Memes are just as much apart of the classic experience as anything.
---
I realise that, I’m just mentioning speed as something to look at,
---
Aside of those mentioned quests there are no repeatable quests so the amount of rep is fixed. The cultists in silithus give 1 rep per kill but don't drop letters which is the main source of later rep progression.
---
Do what I did. Suck it up until 60, then immediately say "fuck it" and roll a warlock instead.
---
That's pve bis. If you gank them farming and they aren't in pvp spec and gear to get faster kill times that's what happens.
---
roger that thanks!
---
No way! The guild im in has plenty of people who’ve never played a mmo at all and everyone is kind and helpful! You’ll probably get ganked more now that phase 2 is coming but I’d still say it’s worth the experience and plenty of fun
---
There’s two answers, especially since it’s phase 2 week.
---
If you play on a pve server, no.
---
If you play on a pvp server, yes.
---
I do hope you join tho. It’s a hell of a game and experience!
---
Now this. This is a shit, shit-post.
---
Is that not a setting in atlas?
---
We are probably more than 2 months ahead on playerbase and content cleared by players though, plus the amount of 60s now would be higher than the amount of 60s in original vanilla at the 3 month point.
---
Only 1 druid spec uses tier sooooo you're talking about like 6 people getting tier 1
---
City raids won't be so common due to dishonorable kills. What the real phase 2 will be is 24/7 flight point camping.
---
Just like the Infernal changes.  No awareness of what the definition of griefing and hurting your own faction was.
---
The way the game is suppose to be played.
---
I’m on Earthfury.   Healthy, even population.
---
Lol why are you getting downvoted??? All you're asking off is clear confirmation
---
I rolled whitemane to be on the same server as a friend and he still plays but is thinking of quitting. Horde dominate pvp and there is no organized pvp on alliance side that I've seen during my play hours (I work during prime time, play late nights). I'm going to  make a horde alt on grob tonight and see how it goes. Been meaning to level a healer anyway and pvp healing is really fun.
---
uh oh
---
That’s ridiculously lame...
---
The same quest for defensive stance, correct?
---
I don't actually know the problem in Moonglade, what happens there?
---
No, it is never too late. PvE or PvP doesn't matter. You won't get ganked for a good 20-30 levels and then after that you probably will on a PvP server, but you're missing out on the fun once your 60, then you can go gank others for revenge.
---
Wow according to that in the last week 75% of Herod is alliance players!!!! This information is beyond worthless as is all realm data since they broke the census app.
---
Did he put them on his shoulders?
---
Would be nice if they decreased the spawn timers of the patterns if they did it for the dinosaurs in Un'Goro.
---
Yeah but heaven forbid you wipe
---
Such an underrated capital city.
---
Why are people farming this rep. The exalted reward is absolutely terrible from what I remember.
---
Bottom line is that your realm is full and you have queues but you are saying low pop realms should be forced to join your realm and also have (even longer) queues. Glad you aren't the one making decisions.
---
Blizzard following up with an in-game mail, warning us that if this continues we will be penalized:  [https://imgur.com/a/eDmjVjI](https://imgur.com/a/eDmjVjI)
---
Details about the situation:
---
We are not exploiting any mechanics and will not be revealing how we get up there. But there were no hacks/cheats/exploits or anything. Anyone can do it through a combination of wall jumps and fears. Esfand has, multiple times used zones like this where you get feared into/up onto to exploit pvp situations and kill players on his stream, though no action has never been taken against him. Streamer benefits at its finest.
---
I agree. The name reservation messed up the “randomness”. People started planning and making coalitions and stuff which messed up the server balance and player distribution across servers. My server for instance is completely dead. And I’m not gonna redo levelling again so yeah. Cancel sub and move on.
---
No problem, I ran into the same problem not too long ago, and I immediately got Myrmidon's Signet when I had the chance. Prices have actually dropped since then (saw one for only 150g the other day), but even at 225g it was worth the money. I just checked, and until Phase 5 this is your BiS ring. Phase 5 is when Signet Ring of the Dragonflight releases, which is the only time you'd replace Myrmidon's Signet. 
---
If you've got leftover money (and I think you would, based on your 600g) then next two options I'd look at are Axe of the Deep Woods, and/or Shifting Cloak. The Shifting Cloak is a high threat cloak, and it's not quite as good as the Ragnaros one, but it's a pretty solid option you could use for all of Phase 1 and Phase 2. Same for Axe of the Deep Woods. Flurry Axe would be last on my priority list - if your guild isn't currently raiding for gear, then your DPS won't be threat capped yet, so going Fury at this point is just trying to make your healers angry. No point in going Fury until both you and the DPS are starting to get some gear.
---
You can experience it on a PVE server.
---
Nice ref link xd
---
You have to fill the group with of level players for the xp/h to be worth is as it's based on average group level. It's possible for the average level to result in no kill XP.
---
G/h from drops is about the same between Cath and Arm if you kill and loot everything, Arm is faster so can end up in lock-out if you're going faster than a 12m run.
---
Arms warriors be like: 
---
“Hey, just wait until 40. We get mortal strike.”
---
*gets owned*
---
“Well, just wait until 50...”
---
“Ok. 60 is IT. You are dead then. Can’t stop us with all of our abilities.”
---
“Okay, wait until we are COMPLETELY geared up in epics and everything”
---
Well, yeah dude. We all will be in epics lol.
---
If you have to wait for gear alone to be good then you sound like you just blow at the game and should delete it. Lol
---
That's just hijinks.
---
Same on Skeram, and flasks aren't even necessary yet.
---
Prices will be insane once harder raids are out, and I'm guessing some of the R14 groups will be using them in BGs too.
---
Do the trolls in STV that roam in packs of 3 count as the ones you can kite one away from the rest?
---
can u port cords plz? thx
---
10am est
---
Yeah market speculation that turns out to not actually be demand has never happened in the real world lmao.
---
Mostly questing is quicker, especially questing supported by AoE if you can pull it off. Super experienced mages will be able to AoE way more thus for them efficiency may be shifted more toward some farms.
---
Quest, do dungeon quests if possible till SM levels - then do some SM from GY to Cath but nothing overly excessive and after that exp boost you can continue leveling (SM helps close the gap that is somewhat present at such levels).
---
PS
---
a character cannot transfer off a server with mail in their mailbox.
---
People purposely flood known ninja-looters mailbox so they couldn't change their name and ditch to a different server.
---
Nobody is wearing leather in PVP, don't be ridiculous. You only need 5% for PVP combat, which is easily reached with non-leather pieces. There's two plate pieces with hit, Blackstone ring, tarnished elven ring, rune of the guard captain, blackcrow, and saytr's bow. That's not even all of them. If warriors are wearing leather in PVP, they are simply fools.
---
Imagine needing keys
---
I like to think for the past 15 years he's been waiting to hand out quests, getting maybe a few adventurers a day and reminiscing about the old days when he'd get hundreds at a time. And now...they're all back
---
If you are a noob, it can be hard to separate random raging from good advice.
---
I saw so many threads early about tanks and healers complaining how DPS are gogogo maniacs causing wipes, but looking at how they describe the fights and what they were doing: they were the problem.
---
This warrior probably went back and complained to his friends how the shitty DPS kept pulling aggro and the healer couldn't keep them up.
---
Because people are morons.
---

---
I was an officer in two occasions. You're not immune. You just get a heads up that things are going to shit.
---
I agree with this. Actually, are you me?
---
There's already massive changes to classic compared to vanilla. I understand not wanting certain changes, but when it comes to something like this it just makes sense to have
---
Multidotting is deceptively slow, because of downtime.  Unless you need the advantage tagging enemies, I wouldn't do it.
---
Can you imagine defending that with retail knockback abilities? Though I guess with flying they just skip the elevator now.
---
&gt; Only 14.5% have a negative opinion of Dire Maul's early release. Now that everyone has seen it for what it is - just another lvl 60 dungeon, not a tier above them - it seems the backlash has settled.
---
&gt; People are very split on the timing of phase 2 release. This is kind of surprising, considering phase 2 doesn't add much including no major PvE content, yet a lot of people still think its too soon. Wonder if thats mostly due to a general concern about the pacing of the phases.
---
I think these two are linked.  I am one that didn't like the release of DM but okay with the instance.  It's a pacing thing, like mentioned in the second quote.  The game is going through phases rather quickly but it's not entirely surprising since players tend to burn through anything new very quickly.  And we cannot forget that there is a high population of pServer players with years of experience in anything Vanilla. *Side note, I truly believe that the call for phase 3 will be loud since phase 2 is just going to be gank-city and people will want instanced PvP options.*
---
&gt; 35% of players surveyed have not reached lvl 60 yet. 20% have yet to reach 51+. Considering visitors to this sub are likely to be more active than the average player, this is a surprisingly high figure.
---
Linked to the above, I think there is a great deal of more casual players that are taking their time so any acceleration of the phase release is going to be looked at negatively.
---
Snitching implies that there was illegal action going on.  "Whining" or "being a bitch" would be better ways to describe it.
---
The weekly "get ride of spy classic, I'm a rogue / druid post".
---
is that why there's so many fucking devilsaurs? I thought it was weird I was constantly getting chased
---
If you have to say it...
---
I hate both factions equally.
---
Did you expect nothing to change?
---
&gt;Why not bring a random Druid to heal? 
---
No idea, I'm just a raider so I don't really take part in the compositions... But at a guess I'd say that the leadership wants to keep the run guild-only to prevent any possible issues (We've forgotten to put ML on multiple times and had a ninja incident). 
---
&gt;50-100g on T2 helm drop, or even be friendly and give it to them
---
Yeah we usually run with 25-30 for Onyxia, so there's no problem with adding another druid.
---
I guess maybe it's just hard finding Druids in general so they don't bother.
---
&gt;We run multiple Ony groups and always try and make sure that someone could use every T2 helm
---
We're usually fine, but depending on previous drops it can be hard.
---
We've had double stormrage and double warlock helms drop at last once, it's getting to the point where the newest warlocks/druids have better gear than the warriors/mages/rogues that have been around since the start.
---
There was a giant thing about it on our server's trade/LFG chat, but there's no video if that's what you're asking.
---
doesnt zoning on the boats trigger honorless target?
---
"Gotta apply that rend because I specced into it"
---
You are being an idiot.

Nobody is buying these rare pets the same way they were in vanilla. Now the pets sell for like 200g - 300g max.
---
If you want to get an epic BoE go farm the Tar Lurkers and Tar Lords in ungoro late at night. Like go farm them from Midnight to 3am and after 3 - 4 days of that I bet you'll have some BoE epic to sell. This is what Chinese gold farmers used to do back in 2005. You could do a /who of ungoro and there was always Chinese hunters farming devilsaurs and BoE epics. There were rumors that they had figured out the timing of Epic BoE drops and could determine exactly when one would spawn as a drop.
---
Different classes scale differently with gear.
---
Used Razer Naga for YEARS have had several different models and noticed in the last 3 years they have become rather cheaply made. My last naga lasted less than a year.
---
Made the switch to a g600... about half the price... but is considerably better built. Would absolutely recommend to anyone looking for a quality mouse without breaking the bank for a corsair or something of that nature.
---
see this I understand, my retail guild I am "out to lunch" it has gone through 2 name changes, and a number of officers but im still there and I haven't logged on in literally years (until this morning at work).  I honestly never cared for loot I just wanted to go back and experience a few of the things I never got to with a good group of people.  Trial is a good place to start with most new people.  Thanks for the post man
---
I mean, that sounds like justice to me.
---
I don’t like to see it either, but then I hear them bitching in general chat about getting ganked. 
---
I’m like, “Bitch, a 60 killed you and you’re level 59. You aren’t getting ganked. You just suck at this game.”
---
They are perfect tbh this is hands down the best mouse ever made you will not regret it
---
I think that was a thing back in the day.
---
Well sounds like you and your guild were exploiting terrain and were warned about it. Seems reasonable.
---
Hilarious. Can I join your Guild?
---
I got it at 39. I had a 60 kill the lady at the top of altar of zul, then I spirit ran up each level to the top of job althor, at that time, there was a full group clearing the sacrificer at the top so I got the mallet. It was perfect timing and as a healer and a lowbie, having the mallet got me thru my 40s very quckly
---
all the Alliance\* :\^)
---
My bad, i'm trying to edit it to add you
---
Grizzle is the fear bomb.
---
Your first use of “there” is wrong.
---
Diminishing returns on kills will prevent this but that does seem like a nuisance.
---
The 15% is a buff, you can buff the damage from ap. I guess more correctly weapon speed has no affect on the dps ap gives
---
I believe honor has diminishing returns to prevent these kind of farms
---
Go ele. It's much better and you got better chance to find a dungeon as a healer than a melee shaman dps imho
---
Not to side with a streamer here, but you can also not do any cheats/hacks/exploits to get under stormwind, or up the walls in WSG, and it was still treated as an exploit and people got banned.  Just because you can do something in the game, doesn't mean you should.  Blizz has said they will stop people from using terrain and los exploits for griefing and ganking purposes.  They just updated the game code to fix the goblin guards, they are not above punishing people for creative uses of game mechanics.
---
Long live the Scourge!
---
Literally best class in solo pvp.
---
So that limits the uses to dire maul key, brd key, strat key, sm key, scholo key, did I miss any?
---
One of those things we should push for in Classic Plus! :)))
---
this sub is not hardcore at all. you can tell simply by the nature of most of the discourse. the actual nolifers dont chat about the shit you see on this subreddit all the time
---
I can't say for sure, I just Ghost Wolfed away any time I aggroed them.
---
You're eating more often as arms since Fury has Blood Craze, so I don't see what you're coming at here.
---
Anger Management also doesn't hold a candle to Enrage/Flurry for speed.
---
My guild gave me our first Leaf drop, being the class leader, I felt it was a good decision.  So I could help the other hunters when they get theirs.  Then we did an Ony run the next day.  The guild master put the Sinew on free roll and so I ended up losing the Sinew.  So now I have to find a PuG run for Ony next week because our guild runs Ony on a day when I'm at work. :/
---
If you’re neutral the guards won’t help you.
---
No, the poster above is saying that i'm a "cunt" for giving a summary when OP is looking for an answer. 
---
Seeing as you don't have a clue and can't answer OP's question at all, it would seem to me that saying, "Welcome to Classic. This shit has bugs and it doesn't always make sense so don't worry so much about it." is a pretty solid response. 
---
Unless you ***do*** know what's happening here and can elaborate further. Seeing as you gave up your chance to do so I'm going to guess you have no clue either. 
---
Hey, another fun fact. If you res someone that got killed by a neutral guard, you will also be attacked. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Welcome to Classic. Some shit is broken.
---
*BLEEP BLOOP BLEEP* "I require optimal gear to even have a chance at game." *BLEEP BLOOP BLEEP*
---
Same thing. They line of sight the guards. Low level Horde Druids were getting murdered by lvl60 Alliance Druids.  
---
The LOS is horrible to the point they're killing players inside the huts, in view of the guards.
---
I occasionally (rarely!) kill other Druids in moonglade.  Usually I aggro a guard but it's trivially easy for a druid to jump off the hills into the lake and escape the guards.  I never even come close to dying from them.
---
Mage?
---
Healer here, if I'm fighting, tank and dps ain't doing their job. Fight till they drop.
---
I remember them :&gt; They would migrate together, not allowed to mount. Had to be in form.
---
They stated in the blue post you got this from that re does matter when they protect you
---
So you were safespotting, and since it was against a streamer it should be ok?
---
That about right?
---
Impossible.
---
I've only corpse camped twice, once was a warlock that started fighting me right as I pulled a group of mobs, the other was a rogue that attempted to gank me when he was 5 levels higher than me. I killed them once off res then left them be
---
That's a yikes from me buddy.
---
Ok îll look it up
---
Is Battle for Darrowshire fixed? Really sucks having a pre-BIS slot locked behind a bug quest....
---
Our guild needs mages and warriors lol. Despite being the most played classes, they get more raid spots, and once you filter down to people who will make raid consistently, perform, and bring consumables, it kind of makes sense we need more of those guys simply because the raid holds more.
---
Fighting is meant as arguing in this context
---
Raid logging is a sign of nothing to do aka slow times, calm down karen
---
Aren't you Honorless the moment you rezone?
---
I posted the profiles in a prior comment reply. Thanks for the props.
---
Just tested it. It does not
---
You don't take durability to PvP deaths
---
You were running 4 man Rends? My friends and I were thinking about trying this but haven't had the chance yet.
---
Yup, I tank and dps as a druid so it gets expensive. Stoneshield, FAP, or Resto pot on all tank fight bosses and Major mana and dark rune on all cat fight bosses. I also keep Jujus going, including Ember on Geddon and Rag. I switch food buffs a lot, going from +Stam to +Agi to Fire Chili. I use Ele Sharpening Stones, even on my trash weapon, and I put Iron Counterweights on all of my Manual Crowd Pummelers each week.
---
The one thing I don't use consistently anymore is Flask of the Titans, but I am saving those for big PVP and BWL progression at this point.
---
This is all without mentioning the 100g in respecs. Luckily, I picked up herbing a while back and changed up my Mara farming route to where I dont even kill Princess anymore, so I can kind of get away with staying in raid spec during the week. With PVP dropping though, the weekly respecs are definitely coming back.
---
It's up buddy.

I'd already been thinking of grabbing one, for the price even if i hate it I wouldn't be upset about it. Current mouse just has 4 extra on the top 2 on each side so it's really easy to hit them, it works fine everything i actually need is mapped but having all those extras would still be handy.
---
To compensate for the tank not doing their job, the dps should have also not do their job.
---
You're supposed to stand there and let the healer take aggro from everything, then wipe. Duh.
---
You linked me this spread sheet.  Look at these two conditions and see that Hunter's Mark is ~8dps.  Have Thorium Headed Arrow (+17.5 DPS)	 equipped with no Hunter's Mark debuff and write the dps number down.  Now change the Hunter's Mark to on and change your arrows to Feathered Arrow (+9.5 DPS)
---
No need to swap to Goblin. Any engineer can make Iron Grenades (and Thorium too, if you're rich), which has the 3 sec stun.
---
All the good Goblin stuff, you can just buy from a Goblin, as they're usable by all engineers. The Big One &amp; the Rocket Boots &amp; the Rocket Helm, they can be used by all engineers, so have a friend make them for you.
---
And some undead with no skin at all...
---
Isnt Maraudon also better with mining?
---
In future expansions it did.
---
We did not exploit any terrain. We received the warning about an hour after the moving happened and after Esfand contacted the GM. Anyone can get up here, it's not a difficult spot. The issue was that we were holding the gate down and preventing them from entering MC, making Esfand look horribly bad on stream from constantly getting his raid wiped and himself dying to us just as many times.
---
Escape artist removes fear in this guy's dreams
---
XD invite me to
---
im not taking sides, just pointing out your original comment is flawed. i am 60 and dont care when any phase comes out
---
Not for that character it won't help, that's true. But someone else might read it and be benefited. Or maybe he'll make an alt.
---
I mean you can shadow priest tank Ony
---
All I see is a bunch of people safe spotting and exploiting terrain which is against ToS and a bannable offense... would just consider yourself lucky that all they did was move you.
---
People get up there [all the time](https://youtu.be/2yZYGbVNA-s?t=8) on other servers without being ported.
---
Not only is layering terrible and the increased max size hilariously misguided, but can we also talk about how laughable faction population is? The Horde basically owns Blackrock Mountain on Smolderweb. At first it was kind of amusing dying three times before I get into BRD. Now, it's getting fucking ridiculous.
---
Had queue on morgraine
---
That, and also diminishing returns. It'll happen, and I'm pretty sure this "bug" isn't a bug and worked this way in vanilla, too.
---
Welp, there's your mount money right there.
---
Honestly you'll probably do better because unless you're ranking high, PvE is the way to go for gear.
---
Oh yeah, that happens a lot unfortunately.
---
I’m only level 32 atm, so thankfully I don’t think I have anything to worry about
---
I keep reading that certain geae can last multiple phases as bis. Is there a guide that shows this for all phases through naxx?
---
&gt; Anyone can do it through a combination of wall jumps and fears.
---
That's exploiting mechanics.
---
TY
---
It's funny that this sub painted pro-layering as the "Blizzard apologists" before classic was released, and now we have the opposite. Must just be a funny term for disagreement.
---
you are not helping your side by referring to people who don't enjoy PVP as "pussies"
---
Idk why that would be a good thing. I just remade my characters. Just wish I didnt have to
---
That's why guilds organize events where you go through killing each of the 40 opposing faction members. At higher honor this kill trading generates a lot of honor.
---
So reporting an exploit and blizzard actually doing something about it is privilege....
---
If it sucks at 45 I seriously suggest you re-roll. Sunk cost fallacy
---
&gt;I can hardly stand to be on reddit
---
level 40 :D
---
Doing your dps rotation is also exploiting mechanics
---
Bro do you get off whining about this a whole week after you were told you can't have something?  Go back to retail seriously.  You and your guild have got an issue, and making stuff up to try and validate your impotent claim.
---
My guild is doing it on aitesh about 7pm horde side. Were doing it b4 we go to MC tonight. Id assume tuesday afternoons might be your best bet. But that may just be the server im on.
---
I’m sure this has been asked but how would you go about grinding 60 gold at level 40? I’ve been farming Jaguars in swamp of sorrow and the stone elementals in the badlands but I was curious if there’s a better place to go. I’m a rogue if that matters at all.
---
Did the server lag to shit or did that get fixed with layering being over?
---
I hope you are trolling
---
half my group went back to their FPS games after level 30-40. 
---
half my group has been 60 for over a month now and full BiS
---
and there's me level 50, still weeks from 60.
---
Completely biased opinion, but I think it's cause lots of the Alliance 15 years ago were teenagers or young -- this is not the case now as they're all adults. But that skews correct for the average streamer age (20-35ish).
---
I remember playing on my Alliance alt in vanilla and feeling old  (at 25 no less).
---
Good to know. Cheers.
---
Yes, thank you, I couldn't remember their name.
---
Anyone can easily get on top of the arena in gad but it’s still very bannable to kill people from up there. If you need to do “a combination of wall jumps and fears” to get to a spot then assume you’re not allowed to pvp from there. Sure Esfand reporting it probably got a quicker response than if Joe Schmoe did but he had every right to report you for yes exploiting and blizz has every right to move you. Be glad they didn’t hand out bans.
---
Pretty sure it's not included in TBC as well.
---
nothing at all...
---
FOR THE BURNING LEGION!!!
---
What? why are you changing arrows
---
I have it open right now with basically pre-bis gear selected
---
hunters mark on 599.9 dps
---
hunters mark off 580
---
Last Thursday
---
Incendius is a bit odd, its the only server that was still layered as of this morning but hasnt had any available transfers recently.
---
Raid BiS and Pre-raid BiS aren't necessarily the same.
---
4-man!?!? How long did it take?
---
"Hobby dev" that provides a better service than Blizz.
---
What's it like to have your head so far up Blizzards arsehole?
---
Can you break this down for me rq?
---
Why is Ironforge so full? I never see these picks in other Alliance capitals (k I know darnassus is shit but what about Stormwind?)
---
Transfer
---
the amount of rage you get is based on the amount of damage you do. DW has higher damage thus more rage.
---
Faster weapons allow for more HS
---
Why would it go back to longer queues? Also I just reamde my characters and currently playing one I havent leveled yet incase I'm ever allowed to transfer my others back.
---
&gt;We are not exploiting any mechanics and will not be revealing how we get up there.
---
That sounds pretty damn fishy to me dude.
---
The honor isn't the entire point. The instant respawning on the boat is a problem.
---
You didn't wait for last Thursday, so that doesn't count.
---
No my name lists as it does here. And yeah, you can contest other casters with equal gear on shorter boss fights :) Counting on getting the staff on friday!
---
When you have to use fears to get to an area you normally couldn’t, whether it’s going through walls to up slopes you can jump, that’s an exploitative location.
---
When you have to use “inventive” jumps to get to a hard to get area in order for their to be *ANY* sort of meaningful retaliation, that’s exploitative. That’s the exact reasoning getting on top of the cage in Gadgetzan is an exploit.
---
Not really.
---
the amount of rage loss is exactly the same during a fight. Its a single hit that hurts less.
---
Exploitation is a definition you should look up before you make a fool of yourself with a comment like this.
---
It's really simple. When I'm farming for nodes or killing quest mobs I want layers. When I'm not doing those things I want everyone on the same layer so I can gank them. Ezpz blizz, get right on that.
---
You know what you're doing, otherwise you wouldn't be there. 
---
But this is a good post and follow up to show that this is again not allowed.
---
Netflix, hire this guy and let him produce a series.
---
A better solution for faction balance is not faction-specific transfers, but faction-specific queues to log in.
---
\*BLEEP BLOOP BLEEP\* "I REQUIRE OPTIMAL GEAR TO BE GOOD AT GAME." \*BLEEP BLOOP BLEEP\*

If you’re on a PvP realm I don’t really see the point to go out of your way to get it. All it takes is one person to decide to gank you and it’s gone.
---
No rich thorium for those sexy arcane crystals tho.
---
OK BOOMER!!! 
---
Grats ;)
---
Definitely
---
Exactly. This is good evidence to report others who abuse this, too. 
---
If you're "not exploiting any mechanics" then why where you there? Why did you pick THAT spot exactly?
---
what bug? i did that quest weeks ago without issue
---
wait 30 days
---
But if your pet kills something and you dont participate then you dont get anything from it. I think that's the confusion.
---
Next question, does engaging nut not killing a flight master in a capital city and dragging it 5 zones away count as a bad thing? I feel like shutting down org for a few hours tonight.
---
Do quests. Quests are great gold per hour.
---
But it's not a safe spot though
---
So for the last week this guy, has been whining about this, fussing at people in trade/world/LFG channels telling him he's wrong, and now tries to take it to reddit in an attempt at spiteful retribution for being told he can't have something, after being told the loot rules on the weapons and being mad that I didn't cave into PM's and begging to let this one warrior in particular roll when the item did drop.  This bro was 2h Spec, and the loot rules as well included MS &gt; OS.  Let it go and get a hobby or go back to retail
---
Dispells could be done with the restro potions I believe, at least for Luci. 
---
For magmadar, maybe switching between tanks during the frenzy? Maybe pop a greater stoneshield pot. 
---
Gehennas should be a cake walk. 
---
Garr would be kind of tough.  No banish but literally anyone in the group could go bear form to handle the ads.  The pull itself is the tricky part. 
---
Baron shouldn't be that hard, but with all dps being melee I assume, you need to establish a good place to position the fight so that the bomb target can run to a safe spot.  The fight would take a bit longer as well with all dps running away from baron during his AOE. 
---
Shazz is normally an easy fight, but with melee needing to be out of range, this one might be one of the hardest fights for an all Druid team.  DPS needs to switch to ranged attacks, making the fight last a long time. 
---
Golemagg should be pretty easy.
---
Sulfuron, not sure what druids have to prevent any healing from the mobs.  Do druids have an interrupt or counterspell ability? If not, this might be the end of the Druid dream team.  Maybe stun grenades or something? I have no idea.
---
Majordomo would be pretty difficult.  Once again I have no idea how this would work. 
---
Ragnoros could be done. 
---
So with all that said, Sulfuron and Majordomo would be the biggest obstacle for a successful all Druid raid team.  Interested in hearing anyones suggestions for those two fights
---
I would think any balance changes would have to be a part of Classic+ or 1.13 if they ever go with that.
---
However, TBC is a lot more likely. So Classic will probably stagnate after naxx until they bring TBC.
---
Personally, I'd much rather see Classic+ and 1.13. But I know it's only just a dream.
---
I go HotW and spam rank 4 so I never run out of mana specifically so I can give innervate to others. I'm usually in the middle of the healing charts but if the fight goes long enough I can top it even without innervate on myself.
---
Yes. The one for priests is on the discord. It shows all best in slots for every phase. Find the one for your class.

i'm almost positive if they attack you pet they should still attack him. Is it possible he was vanishing or did the guards not even move at all?
---
Still see it all the time. Ez reports.
---
Last night, one of you Chewbaccas was huffing and puffing after me in Ironforge while I was aimlessly running around on my mount. Then I realized it was *my* Chewbacca that I just added to our raid team. I said, "Oh, God, what have I done?"
---
So cheap? You must be much more rich than I.
---
In DM North, why do the warlock packs take aggro from Call Pet a mile away and out of LOS?
---
the only shame is that the GM did not ban you for abusing  a safespot
---
My guild is going for under 60min clear on MC tonight I am a feral Druid powershifting on horde this is the craziest guild I’ve been in and The GM is a professional handles things quite well
---
i mean they've already made an assload of changes to the game compared to vanilla, how much slippery would the slope need to get for these people?
---
I did. That's what I said. I got to 45 and it sucked, so I rerolled. I'm now at 52 on a new character on a different server. It sucks just as bad here
---
&gt;I can hard
---
That blocks more important chat msgs than just invites, this addon only blocks invites.
---
How is this special treatment? They were exploiting the terrain, and Blizzard made moves to correct it and warn them.
---
Somehow that's "Special treatment"?... okay buddy.
---
Just keep questing and leveling normally.  You earn so much more gold after level 40 that you'll easily have it by the time you hit 42 or 43.
---
I would recommend this coming Thursday. Though I can't tell you what to do!
---
He said snitching because what he was doing was illegal/against the rules.  He knows what he was doing was wrong.
---
Please don't join the Discord called Fight Club. You can't link it because I deleted all the invite links.
---
We are elitist douche bags, but that's the fun part. We hate all people who don't bother reading that it's not a new player discord and try to ask new player questions.
---
The information, like the joke levels, is top notch, but not for idiots.
---
Blizz seems to disagree, hence the warning. 
---
Also, no right-minded person would look at this clip, and in good faith argue that this behavior isn't safespotting. It clearly and demonstrably is.
---
It is, if you can't be reached by another player using standard game mechanics it is considered safe spotting.
---
I remember people getting 3 day bans in MoP for using gliders to land on statues and kill other players from unreachable spots by conventional means.
---
Also, it would have been nice if the Warlock was able to tank Arugal while breaking los on all of his casts once aggro was on him. It's really not difficult to do in that room as you later demonstrated, and he could have held aggro with dots pretty easily.

Is there any way to set alerts for posts that contain certain words such as 'Gandling' so I dont miss out next time. Gutted I didn't get a chance to participate in such glory.

So I tank and my wife heals, when I start a group and ask for 3 DPS, I can 10-15 responses in a matter of minutes.  I try to to respond to them all, but I’m focused first on picked the classes and levels I want.

You might be getting ignored because you’re getting drowned out by the crowd, try giving your class/spec and level, cause as a tank starting a group that what’s I’m looking at when making decisions

yea but mats for sapper charges

&gt; Edit: the individual downvotes each time you reply are also telling of your personality

I'm not the one downvoting you, shitnugget.
---
No, people don't save it like that considering they clear MC in under 1 hr anyway
---
Unless your goal is specifically to get your mount asap, don't grind. The increase to your leveling speed it gives is not worth the time spend grinding inefficient XP. And the higher your level, the more gold you get from quests/drops.
---
Welcome to the Vanilla experience.
---
You guys are trying to pick a choose what gets changed lol.
---
Not so much "in demand" but there are so few of them, gear just gets thrown out if you don't have enough.

Not abusive at all. This is world pvp. We died many times. The only abuse is Esfand using his power and privilege to interfere with the legitimacy of world pvp.
---
Thicccccc bones
---
Stop! You’re hurting me through his ignorance!!!!
---
He literally followed me from the Booty Bay bank to the Dock shooting my pet the whole time. Guards were unphased. The only time he attacked ME was right when I boarded the ship, then the guards attacked. He insta vanished once the guards caught him, and opened on me again once I hit Ratchet.
---
Oi!  r/uwotm8

GG lurkman--the one who didnt get censored.

Don't come cry here when you get told to stop abusing something, wish you would have gotten temporary ban instead of a warning.
---
Dumbasses.
---
That should be fixed. If you're in a neutral town where guards are clearly supposed to interfere during a skirmish, they should always interfere. This blue post really proves that imo
---
You don’t have to cry, dude. Just stop being bad. It’s not hard.
---
Right it’s really not that deep. Which is why you made an entire post complaining about something you should really care about. So again, stop posting more cringy stuff, and go be an angsty teenager without embarrassing yourself online.

Yeah who would have thought:)

If you are mean to the DPS I will leave.

---
\#solidarity
---
Ok boomer.
---
Hmmm ... that's a good question. I'm personally leaning towards the +crit gloves as they not only provide more crit for those Ruin damage numbers, but you also likely have the talent that buffs Shadow damage on SB crits which helps not only your damage, but the damage of your Warlock/Shadow Priest colleagues as well. On top of that, it's a straight addition to crit chance that buffs your existing Shadow damage, including all the +Shadow gear you already have.
---
I'm no expert here, but it kinda seems worth it.
---
Not viable because of what druids can dispel and potion cd's :(
---
I don’t have to post logs to know that the faster weapon with a chance to proc an additional attack is the better tanking option for rage generation and for using heroic strike. 
---
People responding here have already decided I’m wrong, for no reason, so no matter what they’d pick apart a log and find an issue with something.
---
Late response, but mind sharing what you do in Azshara? Fellow herb/alch shaman here.
---
My guild has been clearing MC every week for a month now and no tanks have ever used major stoneshield pots.  Why are you wasting gold?
---
Another dumb move  on Blizzard/ World of Warcraft's part.
---
Together we will conquer incompetence
---
that's a more reasonable take
---
On my server, arcane crystals go for 45g, thorium for 6-8g a stack, mithril is maybe 2.5g a stack.  Just the thorium will more than allow you to purchase sapper mats, the crystals are all profit.
---
It’s unfortunate that this is a thing. No life neckbeards that want to feel powerful so they become stalkers
---
Shitty* Dps. That’s the point of the post.
---
Hmmm, how does that work with Ratchet?
---
As an alliance, I was getting attacked in Ratchet before doing many quests to get rep with any of the goblin factions, yet when I was attacked, the guards would come to my defense.
---
fun fact, can still gank at WS fp on both sides.
---
Good people, good organization. Really, that's it. The biggest portion of raiding is just organizing 40+ people into a coherent body working together. You manage that, you're a raid guild. Done.
---
And if the people themselves are good, and have a good system for handling loot, etc, it'll keep on ticking. Some of these megaguilds with hundreds of people are gonna implode because...no quality control. If nobody knows each other, the guild is basically just a private LFG channel. If people like and work with each other, and have a good system to avoid loot drama, then the guild will probably last.
---
Hell yeah brother, message Dannybrown on Herod-H for an invite.
---
Did they DDoS your print screen key, too? These internet hackers are getting good.
---
I recall reading somewhere that agro radius due to level differential maxes at 45 yards. Dont remember where, though.
---
Yeah, those will be insane.
---
Who is a fucking pve addon affecting? Spy affects real players, not 15 year old bosses with no mechanics. Im guessing if you played a rogue or any other stealther you wouldnt enjoy being spotted while stealthed. I play a warrior and i feel really bad for all rogues who cant get an opener because of spy. How is this addon fair? Might aswell remove stealth then, i cant belive people are actually defending this addon, do you rely so heavily on it?
---
You druids are an elitist bunch
---
I would say in the general sense that nobody has to spec prot to tank dungeons, and that in dungeons they should use the weapon/shield setup that matches their spec. there are a few specific dungeon encounters where even the non-prot warriors will need the extra mitigation from the shield armor &amp; being able to press shield block though--big damage fights like Drakk or Baron
---
Before the 40s druid tanks need a decent head start, or rage from the last fight to hold on a pack of mobs. Due largely to shit rage generation. If dps go ham out of the gate you won't have enough rage to both hold skull, and tab to maul the extras. Once you lose threat, rage becomes worse.
---
Haha wp
---
You are exceptionally rude.
---
No, because you’ve already proven you’re just going to be biased against it and be an ass. I never said I was
---
chain casting heroic strike or just overflowing with rage constantly.
---
However; if you aren’t using rage pots or threat gear and managing your rage well I’m not surprised to hear you never use heroic strike.
---
hahhaha kill me
---
Listen to this guy.
---
I think it only makes sense if Alliance get a fast pass into the server during the 2-3 hr queues.
---
I'm not sure - could be an additional bug (maybe that was fixed on Nov 8? Dunno)
---
Thanks for this. Think I pretty much got it. That’s what I have been doing but just wanted to make sure
---
I’ve never lost nor have I died. I have camped a NE Druid for 2 and a half hours though. Was super fun. Just watched some football and continuously sentenced him to another long walk back to his corpse. I love them because they are so much faster with that wisp form. You know, that racial that people love because they die a lot? Makes me not wait as long to kill em again lol
---
So you spent hours instead of farming for 10 mins to buy it off the ah?
---
I think that has to do with some quality setting. I set my laptop to minimum everything and things dont show up as fast as on my PC which I use pretty average settings.

It's not "Rogue gear" it's physical DPS gear. Extra armor won't help a DPS Warrior deal more damage in PVE.
---
But yeah it also makes them squishier which is why they won't be using that gear for PVP. That's when plate becomes relevant again.
---
That's awesome!  It's such a game changer getting that first mount!
---
Is this actually a thing? Spamming sunder is the Dummy's Guide to Acceptable Tanking. It's the easiest thing you can do to hold threat.
---
where do you keep getting this shit from? whitemane has had open server transfers on and off for a long time now - if I really wanted to go I'd go
---
Good point!
---
Then you're not managing your mana well. You're not a mage in mail. You can wear shields for a reason. You should be pulling with spells, shocking when needed, and meleeing between for getting outside of the 5sr. There's no need to shock if the mob is low health, unless you're on the edge of dying. Conserve your mana.
---
I’m from &lt;Mutiny&gt; on HS. we try our damndest out there. I will say that we already see some new horde guilds that xfered over this last 24 hours. 
---
Also I’m not sure if it’s true or not, but to us it kind of looks like quite a few alli may have transferred off within that first hour transfers were open for all. Does it seem that way to you?
---
Yeah the greens got buffed too is the part this guy is missing.
---
That is just to prevent hunters from (literal) afk farming by using their pets on aggressive mode.
---
Anyone playing both factions on different PvP servers?  I really want a NE but cant bring myself to start over with nothing
---
With supply going down, demand will absolutely go up. Might not be immediate, but it will happen. That's assuming the available resources were being farmed previously.
---
Well this is at level 60 that this was happening. And it was the healer pulling aggro, because all the DPS was doing exactly what he said. He was just bad honestly.
---
Uh huh. And you graduated top of your class. And you have a six pack. And you have 3 girlfriends. And you most definitely aren’t a 12 year old sitting in his parents house making posts in a wow sub about how awesome and super duper cool you are. 
---
It’s actually kinda pathetic.
---
try beefing up with some consumables. armor scroll and armor elixir are cheap. pop a stoneshield potion on boss fights (stoneshield is 50% as much armor as a shield / greater stoneshield is 100% as much)
---
horde guilds who participated in that event were :   &lt;Hellion&gt; &lt;SC&gt; &lt;Hungry For More&gt; &lt;Inner Sanctum&gt; &lt;Deja Vu&gt; &lt;Plebs&gt; &lt;The Italian Job&gt; &lt;Memento &gt;

All because they fucked up the launch so hard.

Remember how they originally only had like 5 NA servers? LOL

Yeah we all expected sustainable, healthy servers that don't feel like clustered messes.

Cool story bro.
---
Can you give a blue post on this?  I have so many (9) epics my guild keeps funneling because no one will find a druid or hunter to join our guild or buy our epics.

Right, I’m the one who made a post complaining about how you were constantly losing your rolls to warriors, and that they’ll rue the day they took your BiS when pvp comes out. You’re not crying at all, it’s obviously me. 
---
Caught me red handed there bud.

Yeah I'm not super sure what that particular key is to be honest. Sorry!

I agree in theory that abnormally high pop servers should continue to be layered into phase 2 because that just makes sense.

However can you imagine uproar from the community, most of whom likely arnt even on aforementioned servers. The vitriol would be immense 
---
 "you said no more layers in p2, lying blizz strikes again I'm sunsubbing" 
---
Like umm wot?!
---
Why? What are they used for? They're 45g on my PvE server. Why would the price go up after free transfers?
---
Depending on what level this happened at too. Early on around the SM runs or so, if your druid tank wasn't having the easiest time maintaining aggro, very likely at level 30 he has 3/3 points into Predatory Strikes due to its "catch all" attack power increase and super likely he's 0/5 in Feral Instinct which helps threat gen, due to him being much more of a levelling spec than a tanking one.
---
5/5 Feral Instinct and 2/2 Primal Fury go very well hand-in-hand(you don't absolutely have to, though), but 2/2 Primal Fury is nearly indispensable for Bear tanking, particularly later on when you have actually have gear to scale up your crit rating.
---
But early on around a Feral druid's 30's, yeah persistent threat on multi-targets can be a problem and all the more so if he's in truth specced for cat form's 2/2 Blood Frenzy(which majority of druids would be). Feral Fairie Fire at level 31 is a boon, but in order to more or less guarantee threat on the primary target, I pull with Starfire, followed by moonfire, then shift into Bear.
---
But anyways if he doesn't have a lot of +agil on his gear, then he won't be landing very many Maul/Swipe crits which would have further help cemented aggro. It can be a problem for sure early on.
---
I had 8 real life friends excited to play upon release and now only 2 of us play. It will keep dropping off.
---
You are still able to use it. You just no have to plan before you randomly attempt to stealth up on some low level questing.
---
Damn bro. Maybe it's you.
---
The Orcish word for ‘run away and make up an excuse’ is ‘honor’. I think it’s French in origin.
---
I brought this up way back in 2017 right after Blizzard announced Classic. Nostalrius had this problem (it peaked at ~13k concurrent players, about 5x a real Vanilla server's max population), and they not only had to implement dynamic spawns on Black Lotus, but add brand new spawns on them. They had to do this with minerals and other herbs, too.
---
Obviously, a similar solution on these servers violates #nochanges, but their populations violate #nochanges, but I don't recall Black Lotus ever costing triple digit gold a unit back in 2006, either.
---
Holy paladins are always in demand.
---
That’s ridiculous. I clearly have an eight pack. Typical dumbass warrior. Smh
---
I think you're misunderstanding what they're arguing. they're not saying fast weapons aren't better for HS dumping. obviously that's true. they're saying that it's unlikely that you have enough to rage to be HS dumping in a phase where boss damage is low and you don't have a bunch of incidental crit on your gear. if doing an HS delays you from hitting shield slam immediately every time the cooldown is up then it's not optimal to HS yet
---
Note to self. Log in before 1PM. my time and stay logged in the rest of the night until I go to bed.
---
Holy shit, yeah that rule is...how does anything even get past those filters?
---
NOT HOW I WANT IT INTENDED
---
I've always found the starting areas to lack enough lore to make sense of why I even exist. I think orcs come close.
---
I believe horde is the dominant faction on incendius.
---
Yeah it’s p5 and you only need friendly which is super easy.
---
Please Please do
---
Nah you said that, not me. Yes people who dont show guild pressence, are pussies imo on a pvp server.
---
   Its one if the most important parts of server community, and spreading both your character, and guilds name around the server.
---
Again all my opinion, I did not at one point say if you dont like pvp youre a pussy.
---
Massively better. People back then were not idiots. They had go use fire gear because their raids had insanely worse gear and rag did not last 2min with a pug.
---
&gt;	You must be pouring sweat from typing all that. Take a breather there, big fella.
---
I’m responding to just you, and you are responding to everyone else in this thread. But I’m the one drenched in sweat for typing? Yet another instance of your self awareness.
---
I think they may have screwed it up. I know at a low level I was protected as Alliance in Ratchet, unless I somehow did enough quests to get friendly that is.
---
Pretty easy to get rage to hit 1 hamstring after intercept buddy.
---
This looks like art from a Miyazaki film
---
Haha let’s leave that part out
---
When the universe was created?
---
The horde on Gandling eu are so pathetic, they outnumber alliance 2:1 and they still fail constantly.
---
My mates and i tried this at grom gol the other night and it seems like they have hard leash at about 100 yards. Boo
---
This post is clearly saying that it's unintentional.
---
Honestly, the way I look at it is simple. If you PVP in the city walls, expect guard aggro.
---
Outside city walls, if you're close enough to the guards, I could see it but don't expect protection outside.
---
Although I don't necessarily disagree with you I haven't played WoW in a long long time and my RL friends who have also played a bunch of retail hyped up classic and I was always a fan of the classic experience...
---
So I subscribed. One friend got to 60 before I was 40 and the other stayed at lvl 13 and has never logged since. The server, faction, and guild were all decided by them since I just wanted to play the game with them again. 
---
Fast forward to today the guild is disbanded my lvl 13 buddy still hasn't logged back in and I just dinged 54 yesterday. I may never play with them.
---
I found a very accommodating guild that is helpful and supportive. I look forward to raiding with them when I hit 60. 
---
Then I appear to have taken reddit at face value and not looked closer at the gear used.  I assumed the raid jumped in without farming prebis. Apparently green wrath means in quest greens.
---
But I am correct that you didn't stack fire resist with gear but through buffs.
---
But why male models?
---
The best part of killing low lvl players is that they might come and write a novel about it on reddit.
---
Maybe not though. Even servers without transfers are having issues with this. 
---
I've been doing the winterspring frostsaber farm on a relatively-low-pop server (no queues, basically) and winterfall village is crawling with people 24x7. I've been, over the past weeks, at every hour of the day, on weekdays and weekends, and there are never fewer than 6 people there vying for spawns. It's essentially fully-camped from midnight to midnight. 
---
Not only can I not transfer, but I'm on a *less populated server* and I can't imagine how bad this farm would be on Skeram/Stalagg/etc. 
---
So, no, you can't just transfer "anytime" to magically solve this problem. Shitty comment and you're not even right!

Every minute you can use it as a mana free taunt. Kings feels better than Sanc anyway imo since you’re lacking Holy shield and with defense gear you really won’t be getting crit that much.
---
Isn't the "low effort memes" part very passive to interpretation?
---
Every. Thread.
---
I think your wrong and somehow extrapolated
---
, having shitty statistics mean we can fabricate "feeling" numbers to create statistics that look "accurate enough". Big argument point.
---
\&gt; I feel like people who roll on PvE are primarily disinterested in the kind of open world PvP encounters that I enjoy. 
---
Maybe, but I know a lot of people who rolled PvE because they don't want to be corpse camped constantly and/or know they are not good at PvP.
---
I already had two friends stop playing the game because I rolled PvP and they got corpse camped by 60s at around level 20-30. They just kind of went "I don't get why this is fun?" and stopped playing.
---
Dynamic encounters would be a balanced mix of groups fighting each other with ebbs and flows, but with the factions being so imbalanced on many servers, it doesn't feel dynamic, just feels like a slaughter.
---
Damn so far in 3 runs I got outrolled and no hunter took my 500g offer
---
I am not rewarding the endless spamming to buy-out the patterns for gold.
---
As the game goes on the population will dwindle a bit no doubt, hope you aren't left on a sparsely populated server.
---
Please stop treating this subreddit like it's your personal classic WoW themed Facebook.
---
What you described definitely is world PvP. 
---
Get to 60, get geared, then start what you consider to be world PvP, I guess.
---
That's what I'm thinking. I need to go get a low level alt and test it.
---
You're the SAME guy? sheesh get over it my guy lol
---
Ya dude, you are exploiting ur keyboard right now
---
Proud of our guild leader
---
Y'all  know they gonna need that cookie.
---
Can’t get banned, but you can be impeached.
---
I play on horde and i kill all the alliance i see because they have to pay the "alliance tax".
---
Hey guys, I have a great idea! Let’s not let our majority player base play the game to appease a vocal minority!
---
its not a bug. This is how the boats worked on private servers too. 
---
Otherwise there is no way for a player to get back to their bodies without having to wait till the next round the boat comes back, and guess what? Theyll die again if a group or guild is camping the boat. They will NEVER get to the other side, so blizz made it so you respawn when the boat shifts zone. It makes sense this way
---
I forget. If you skip the warrior quest to get defensive stance, can you learn it through your class trainer later on? 
---
I was running SM library the other night with a warrior 'tank'. Never saw him taunt a single time. Never saw any sunders. It was basically 4 dps and one stressed healer. (Everyone else knew what they were doing so we were fine but obviously a good tank speeds everything up)
---
I thought he was just bad or unwilling to try to keep threat but now I'm wondering now if he even did the quest chain.
---
Awh you said it before me. Have my upvote friend.
---
Imagine playing a PvP server and running to Reddit complaining about it. You want to know what’s fun? Making you mad without minimal effort. If I have ganked you so many timers, you run to reddit to complain about it, then I’ve done my job. And it feels great. Post like these just reaffirm my ganking efforts are working, and it feels great.
---
Lol yeeeaaah... streamer envy is real.
---
Yes, it is the level 10 warrior quest.

People still used fire pots back then. Gear makes a far bigger difference. So do the 1.12 talents and general knowledge.
---
I look at it this way. My guild was the first horde guild on my server to clear bwl. Around the same time we could ALMOST kill rag before sons. My guild now is more casual, but they have solid players. We killed rag before the sons the first time we cleared MC. My old guild would have had significantly more raid gear, yet we couldnt do the same.
---
Yeah until trying to get to the instance becomes a 45 minute ordeal

Are you under the impression that every server has transfers?

People can attack you on top of the cage in Gadgetzan... but if you back up you can easily LoS.
---
Same with this spot. If you back up you will LoS people on the ground without them having a way to access you with being feared and jumping up wall glitches in the hex of walls etc.
---
The goal is to piss you off. There is nothing they want more than you to respond to it.
---
it’s really fun dude
---
Who will banish the elemenetals at garr? Who will sheep major domo's bitches?
---
its a pipe dream just like your meme class
---
Out of curiosity, did the tank ever respond to the advice? I've noticed a lot of players won't talk, don't talk, or are apparently really inept at communicating.
---
Weak.
---
Are crystals a frequent drop chance from Rich Thorium?
---
Not against a Paladin in full Rank 13 plate with Devo up...
---
It's not fun, but it's my duty as a warrior of the Alliance to clear these lands of the filthy hordes who think they can can Azeroth THEIR home
---
Being Hit capped isn’t as important for the Main tank, as Heroic strike won’t generate as much threat in the grander scheme of things as the sunder spamming. But off tanks and Feral tanks (because Maul is a larger part of their threat) really need to hit that 9% threshold
---
i scam disgusting mages by asking for a layer invite while they are porting someone else and i take their portal for free. mages NEED to be stopped and we must spread awareness of their goblin gold hoarding ways
---
Looks a lot like woltk keyring.
---
Yea lol we had in this raid 3 1/2 groups only, thats like 1guild .and world bosses will we saught after by several guilds
---
You are talking about the hardcore players that knew the raid intimately and had been running it on Private Servers. I don't think it's the comparison you should be using. Majority of guilds who cleared MC are not doing it in greens, they're doing it in pre-bis. 
---
Why they are doing it so easy is a fair discussion, but the really hardcore ones is not the correct comparison to original WoW for obvious reasons.
---
These posts
---
Nop. And between real id (which you can literally right-click the other faction and the add button is still there) and discord its impossible to stop anyway.
---
&gt;who can't get an opener because of spy
---
How does spy prevent them from getting an opener? You still can't see them. It does not allow you to see through stealth, all it does is raise your anxiety that a gank could be coming at any moment. Sure, you may be more prepared, but this does not prevent rogues from opening on you. 
---
I would be willing to put money down that even with Spy, you've been killed from rogues stealthing in and ganking you.
---
&gt;Do you rely so heavily on it?
---
No, not really. After I got carbonite I pretty much uninstalled it until the controversy came back up and I was reminded of the KOS list. It seems you do though as to quote you here:
---
&gt;I play a warrior and feel really bad for allthe rogues who cant get an opener because of spy.
---
Again, while this makes no sense, clearly you are benefiting from it, too. Unless you're just saying you feel bad for rogues. Which rogues on here are actually talking about how much fun they have with it. Stealth nearby, watch the anxiety raise as the enemy blows cd's to try and find them.
---
But being shitty, especially at high level, they don’t seem to care about your fun.
---
Just remembered I have atlas loot as well, that is a portion of it, but most of it is the auctionator package.
---
Level 21 Druid here. Should i farm deadmines for Smite's mighty hammer?
---
Outside of city limits technically. I think that's fair.
---
Server is packed with the horde at lv 55-60. About 5 hordes to 2 allies in any high level zone. Entrance to BRM and thorium point horde controlled mostly
---
Read about the history of nationalism it’s just facts.  Rich people have been using the poor as fodder for their interests for a millennia now.
---

Wait, what if I put it in your terms then? You've been a joke, from conception to execution.

Thank you for being one of the few people who haven‘t been toxic about this. I‘d love to do that, it‘s just.. not cool for casuals anymore, I guess?

It's against old tos.  New tos basically says we can do whatever we want for whatever reason with no warning.
---
As much as I hate the debuff limit because it wasn't intended but a limit, this.  If you get more debuffs it means more DPS so health would need to be adjusted.  As shitty and stupid as it is, the limit has to stay.  Although it does bring up the point that things are piss easy as it is, and likely will be across every tier.  So would it actually matter at this point?  What, you kill bosses a minute sooner than you would have?
---
Also for disc priests, presumably.
---
Some guild did that back in vanilla (not a main city iirc) and held it for ransom until a gm intervened and reset it. To google!
---
Ur a nutcase
---
they have it figured out, it's the players that prefer to play on an overpopulated server ratehr transfer somewere else
---
Not to be discouraging but you probably shouldn't expect much loot no matter what loot system they use.  Any fresh raider in our guild is on a probationary period for the first few weeks and can only get what veterans don't need.  After that we actually have our classes figure out who gets what and just use loot council for the higher ticket items (weps, trinkets, etc.)
---
The best you could hope for is if you get a guild that does open rolls and you get crazy lucky but those guilds tend to fall apart fast.  Gearing in raids takes a long time so consider whatever guild you do end up joining to be a decent investment of your time so make sure it's a good fit.
---
It's the same net effect. Buffing players is the same as needing bosses
---
Alot of top tier raiding guilds in classic wont just take anybody on raids. So you may have to have Pre-bis everything and wait until you get lucky and a few people dont show for raid-time. 
---
Some guilds even make you send screenshots of your raid achievements from retail. So you may have to earn your stripes before you just hop into a top tier raiding group.
---
Will this work on hunters using eyes of the beast to kill lowbies while standing outside the city? That's the most frequent abuse I see on my server.
---
[This is what my menu is like trying to add an indicator.](https://i.imgur.com/ccDniRf.png)
---
Don’t buy into the hand of Ed. It’s niche as fuck. Unless you have more money than you know what to do with (and it looks like you don’t) get the mount. Instant hearth is pretty funny though
---
oh please.  i play alliance on grobbulus and theres plenty of revenge lowbie ganking from us too.  anyone who thinks otherwise is completely delusional.
---
Posts like these are the reason you should kill low level players
---
There's definitely different types of corpse camping. One time my group of 3 was leaving Ulda to wait for a tank in the safety of Lock Modan. Our mage was lagging behind and got jumped by 3 horde who were hiding behind the summoning stone, apparently just waiting for a chance to 3v1 one of us. Me and our priest quickly turned around and managed to kill all 3 of them. Our plans of waiting at the inn changed as we killed them each about 5 more times until we found a tank. 
---
But 4 guys sitting on a lone player just trying to level is a different kind of camping. That's the kind I consider to be tasteless.
---
git gud
---
The thing you need to remember is that you don't own your account. Blizzard does. If blizzard wants to ban you because they feel like it and give you no reason or warning... They can. 
---
So if you are getting paranoid about something, then make a decision and stick with it. Is it worth the risk of losing your account/being temporarily, or permanently banned or not?
---
I see, you too, are a man of culture.
---
i forgot all about this addon! thank you for sharing, i'm so exciting to install it
---
I always assumed this prohibited things like Horde &lt;&gt; Alliance translators. Did people actually get banned for colluding with the opposite faction?
---
pipe dream.  nobody has incentive to join.. 1000% competition on gear, longer and more painful raiding just for a meme.  won't happen.
---
why?  i play both factions and while ally definitely has more organization for wpvp my general experience has been better on horde.
---
But your chance of not seeing it in 100 runs isn’t 5% either. 
---
I didn’t see hoj for maybe 50 runs, and then it dropped during a guild run.
---
Currently leveling my shaman (42) and looking into profession investment at end-game a little more. I currently have SKIN/HERB, but now I have my mount I'm thinking of what to dump skinning for as it's outliving its use.
---
Is enchanting still profitable at this point with things like jump runs, or has the monopoly dried up with people already having recipes? That just leaves me with Alchemy I figure?
---
I'm looking to play ele/resto at cap - Should I respec towards that now or still autoattack my way to 50-60?
---
See the video posted above by the Mutiny guild, taking on multiple alliance guilds at once.
---
It's not nearly as hopeless as you make it out to be.
---
Heartseaker is full of the weakest and most cowardly alliance from stalagg
---
Are there other ways one can do it?
---
How is it a douche move? You're going to find plenty of high levels and enemy reinforcements are close by.
---
Grats. What an accomplishment. You defeated all three players.
---
Attacking players from places that are meant to be inaccessible to them is considered an exploit or safespotting. There’s nothing wrong with being where guards can’t see you or reach you, but if you got there by climbing using wall glitches it's bannable because the other player can't retaliate without using the same methods.
---
Ah tes, the multishot machine.
---
what's funny is Herod also has a healthy queue (that's gonna get worse in the next couple hours) but only the horde can leave... alliance can either deal with it or restart at level 1
---
being a dick doesn't always work out as easy as you put it.
---
Thats why i have friends and guildmates to do stuff with :)
---
Probably not. I remember seeing this when I was playing BC/WotLK
---
The guards aggro to the hunter and pet, they kill the pet and then if the hunter is far enough away, they just drop aggro as if he escaped.
---
Not sure what you can do to fix that :(
---
Your top horde guilds are trash at the game man. Your top horde guild would be #24 horde on stalagg. Enjoy your dead af server.

grobb is pretty close to 50/50 actually.  alliance has several big zerg guilds who are very pro-wpvp.  hordes only zerg guild avoids pvp at all costs.
---
Has no charm..well. It is extremely clean, not cluttered, keeps TONS of room for visuals. I actually saved this and am going to check it out later after work.
---
"What"? - As I realise this isn't /r/Arugal and our IF unlayered tonight is going to be fucking packed
---
Looks like a typical prime time layer from Arugal prior to the patch (have not logged in since)
---
Note to self, old mate can't take a joke
---
I'm really loving earthfury honestly.
---
But Alliance on servers like Fairbanks and Herod had lots of opportunities to transfer off since release, prior to these new faction limitations.
---
I'm talking about the runecloth bag.
---
I gave away the other recipes to guild mates who needed it since they were basically worthless on my server.
---
Honestly I expect one of two things. Either I'll be one of those people that quits and rejoins intermittently or paid transfers to a server of my choice will become available. Either way I don't really foresee it becoming an issue.
---
With Great power comes great responsibility.
---
im new to this game entirely and have been enjoying it very much so i must ask, what's the likeliness of this being fixed?
---
What’s the fun if there’s no surprise butt sex tho?
---
Leveling with my friend who basically new to WoW. Trying yo show him all the side goodies he has as a mage, and urging him to make use of them.
---
So far he really likes big fireball crits, and porting to any city in game.
---
He kinda feels like conjur water is a mixed blessing/curse in groups. And refuses to carry soft feathers for slow fall, feels its a bit overwhelming .
---
Also Im a lock, he likes my cookies :). Adorable comic, I love it. Gonna link it to him :D

Very true! Won't get worse, just won't get better either.

Duh? That's outside the cities.

What happens?

Bro you know I always give 6 stacks to my hydro homies when they trade me one :)

Fucking zoomer clowns always bitching

Herbalism/mining not close.
---
Also the military saving lives is a literal oxymoron bro what are you trying to prove?  That my life is less valuable because I don’t kill the people my government wants me to?  Lol
---
There is nothing to figure out other than a bunch of people who want to play on servers that are well over capacity, and then bitch and moan about how the server that is over capacity can't handle all the fucking people during PVP battles, and how there aren't nearly enough resources to go around for them.
---
This just proves that Orgrimmar is impregnable. They can't even come through the gates.
---
Thanks. All bosses dead in each alliance city and this was one good screenshot I got!
---
which i think it is, i just don't like this server is all.
---
Attacking players from places that are meant to be inaccessible to them is considered an exploit. There’s nothing wrong with being where guards can’t see you or reach you, but if you got there by climbing using wall glitches it is bannable.
---
Safespotting falls under this definition and what was shown in this clip falls under safespotting. Has nothing to do with the presence of guards only that other players would have to replicate the exploits to reach said location. Hence why using zeppelin or boat cabin to avoid guards is perfectly acceptable because the other players can access the location. Same with attack horde in the drag or alliance in the tram. There are guards present but assuming it is accessible by the other player then it is not safespotting.

This is an LoS bug. If the monster never sees you after you start the combat it will just continue on until it can social other monsters.

Just hang out of los for like .1 seconds so he sees you and goes "oh the flame shock came from that guy"

that's not a bug

I'm curious what other chat messages it blocks.
---
You're missing a very clear sentence at the end of the developers note:
---
&gt;it better enforces the authentically intended consequence of PvPing in a goblin city by challenging the attacker to fight, die, or escape the guards.
---
The intended actions of pvping inside of a neutral city with armed guards is "you will be attacked. You can either kill them all, die, or escape"
---
Avoiding aggro inside the city is not intentional. Anything outside the city walls doesn't count obviously.
---
To bad they share the cooldown with mana crystals so they are useless
---
You mean the company that has repeatedly given people on these servers the choice to transfer off to servers that aren’t over populated?
---
Seems like the company has a fix in place but the players continue to complain because it’s not the fix they want.
---
They likely assumed that you’d be staying to help when gearing you. I’m sure they could’ve waited but the sting of seeing someone with good gear that you’ve passed on is surely understandable no? 
---
I don’t know the circumstances, but it’s tough in both regards. The gear is for active raiders to help gear more active raiders. But I’m not sure a GKick was necessary, especially if you planned on coming back! 
---
Anyway, keep your head up and find a better guild! You definitely have the gear for it.
---
Heartseeker never had transfers off the realm available.
---
What is even funnier is that the Horde brainletts on Herod won't transfer to another server because they think a server that has a much larger population than vanilla had is a dead server.
---
It seems that Reddit don’t take kindly to non-human folk.
---
Eh not really important unless you are very concerned about exactly when you or someone else leaves/joins a chat channel.
---
Indeed, CPU 7 is getting maxed out when in IF (crowded spots). I am getting around 110-120fps now that there's less people (also I've disabled Auctioneer).
---
Your server is your community. It’s your guild, it’s friendly and familiar faces, it’s rivals and enemies. I’d stay on Grobb even if I knew I had to wait in queue for an hour every day forever, and clearly lots of players feel the same. 
---
Also, the servers you tranfser to are low pop, and don’t project to last for a long time.
---
Yeah and it seems like no one cares about yours either. Don’t post stupid shit if you don’t want people to disagree with you
---
well to be honest it hasnt been that long...
---
wait, its been out for 3 months... damn time goes fast while playing it lol
---
I keep trying to install chronometer is that not compatible anymore?
---
No I totally believe that The battle for hillsbrad is the reason classic is around. Everyone wanted to see if you could recreate it on an old engine. 
---
Just like all good things from classic wow come from BFA
---
I don’t think this is blizzlike. Yes, I know it worked like that on PS. Do you have a blue source it’s a bug?
---
There is definitely a command somewhere that does it.  My friend plays on medium settings and I play with everything maxed and he can see herbs/ore/mobs/chests about twice as far as I can.  Ive tried turning my settings down to match him but it doesnt make a difference.
---
No lie!  The defender goes down like a sack of potato's if anything so much glances at it o-o  High Warlord..  Wow your friend reeeeeally liked killing allies, that's awesome, totally something I look up to
---
I thought I was the only skeptical on this. My doubts only increased when they didn’t release it with DM - even taking into consideration that it’s pretty much proven that DM was rushed from their intended plan (printed materials of Blizzcon to get a “preview of DM” or similar).
---
They stated before that the reason the keyring wasn’t included from the get go was that they had to basically redo the code on the Classic client. They know it’s a dearly wanted feature, I am sure if they had it ready they would have announced it.
---
I just wand and afk
---
I put weapon damage on mine while leveling enchanting and actually had a fellow druid whisper me asking wtf I was doing. Had a nice laugh when I told him it was just for a skill up lol.
---
i thought your post was completely reasonable.  you are asking the community for a sanity check.  this is the rational and healthy behavior of a conscientious person.  for some reason, people like mortenuit hate that.
---
it feels like some people have taken on the responsibility of making sure nobody posts about anything ever.  any post that does come up, they will find something wrong with it.  'ever heard of google?' is a favorite reply among this group.  this particular person is complaining that your post was too long.  if you had kept it short, he would complain that there is no context.
---
this person comes across as miserable, and the goal of his response could simply be to spread more misery.
---
Maybe I should start being saltier about this as well. I‘ve tried to be nice so far. Except to obvious douchebags.
---
Yes if you are a skeleton you can transform into a kitty etc. Can't mount though.
---
Druids getting no love.  Afaik the pred strikes/lotp aura issue still exists when power shifting and we still get mana burned in form. 
---
If either of these got fixed lmk just been fishing for a week
---
Is this allowed? I know dropping in custom models is bannable.
---
Feel the breeze whipping across your .. um.. femurs?? 🤣🤣🤣
---
It was definitely actionable in vanilla.
---
Man it sounds like you’re really mad.  Did you get 2v1’d or something, champ?
---
Sociopaths
---
Maybe he's from Europe? In which case that would make sense for him.
---
You don't need to buy gear off the ah for a level 12 also you can't aoe at 12
---
Clearly I am being either misunderstood or nobody cares. I'm not going to argue with you about it anymore so let's just leave it at that.
---
Tons of people played vanilla my dude
---
That's not fair. I can also level cooking and sometimes herbalism.
---
Underrated comment of the day. Thank you for the laugh
---
I like warrior in plate, you are an easy target to literally every single ranged class since you do zero damage
---
Lol before i went resto i would get comments everytime i went boomkin form. Had one guy make me pose for a screenshot because he hadn't saw one before.
---
Come to Heartseaker! We have Legitimate human hearts to seek and destroy.
---
there are no more layers
---
Epic mount never gets replaced and is always "BIS" in a way. It will last you as long as you play and will provide more value than any minor gear upgrade could ever do.
---
Drama will be in any guild. Certain people just clash. 
---
But with good leadership Drama is negligible. 
---
What you want is a guild that clears and clears efficiently. If they are struggling and need more gear to clear it's probably a bad sign.
---
Welcome to the internet!
---
Keep it in the bank and only take it when you need it
---
a. join a pvp guild that will help and protect you if needed, aka get friends. thats what you suppose to do.
---
b. its a faction war, why would they let their future competition level freely? it doesnt make any sense. ofc they kill you, they'd be happy if you quit the game. you are their competition. server is a community.
---
c. To feel the power discrapency. the point of gearing up is to feel powerful in comparison. what the point of gearing if you cant oneshot some "fly" later? 
---
d. for RP reason. cos they generaly hate "alliance" etc. 
---
e. to start a fight. (look a.) you suppose to call friends if you are getting camped. ppl frequently kill lowbies just to provoke and start a wpvp battle with 60s, that'll come help you. 
---
f. don't overstate the problem, its not like you are always getting killed everywhere. learn where you can go, and where is dangerious. use saver leveling pathes and zones, avoid dangerous zones and points. of if you are leveling in searing gorge its extremely dangerous cos 60s dungeons and raid in this zone.
---
g. dungeon grind.
---
e. get addon spy it shows enemies around. will help you avoid them.

---
Back then we just typed /e &amp; said whatever we wanted to horde/alliance it’s not that complicated...
---
Yeah... I was in the horde raid, and felt very bummed out. The actual travel there was sick, 120+ people all on mounts just rushing through zones, but as soon as the fighting started it grew soooo boring. Just sitting and waiting basically, I was able to get many 3 corruptions to hit, 6 out of my 9 sapper charges whiffed cause the people on my screen were already dead 30 seconds prior...
---
Just a massive bummer of a raid, not something I'm likely to do again with how bad the lag was.
---
he is now
---
I did, they're barely adding pressure atm. I already disabled Auctioneer, which did add quite a lot of pressure (it improved from 55 avg to 70fps).
---
The original Dota 1 Slark was an actual murloc.
---
You were warned
---
you want “of the eagle” gotta stack dat int and stam. I didn’t really start till 24-26 when your talents really help you out.
---
This is beautiful!!
---
Why are liberals so cheap? The +20 fire resist helm and leg enchant seems so much better than +100hp especially during this raiding period
---
Hold on, is it Friday now?
---
so relatable, they took down every single one of my memes...  and even though i know they are all gonna get taken down i just keep posting knowing at least it will make a few people smile before it gets massacred by the moderators
---
"We love moonkins on alliance" - Paladins
---
Talking to someone on the opposite faction and making deals with them, are two totally different things. they were asking about making the deal, not if it was against the rules to talk to them lol
---
I thought it was 15 :/
---
Still, 12 keys on hand is better than 12 bag slots taken up!
---
Sick album cover dude
---
They gave all those things but the warnings. I think overall people are mad that a company like Blizzard has been so poor in terms of planning these things al. Servers being with little to no warning, non-faction specific transfers then having faction specified without warning. Overall I think they have done a decent job, but they have definitely failed in placed I feel they shouldn't have.
---
Thanks a lot! Tbh, I decided to go for the epic mount first. Plus, those auctions got cancelled before the expiration time, so yeah :)
---
Still, it was nice to hear all the replies!
---
Pop a lip if they fap.
---
Menethil would be great if it wasn't for the fact that geared 60s on the way to Onyxia gather at the docks there. I literally helped to steamroll a 5 man horde group that thought it was a good idea to camp that boat last night. The best part was when our priest MC'd their healer and just waited for the boat to leave so he could throw them off the boat in the middle of the Fatigue zone.
---
So what I'm saying is, please do camp the Menethil boat. It's free honor for me.
---
Yes i will start AoE at lvl 20ish, I just asking this ahead of time
---
Anybody that comments being against you on this topic is surely the player that you’re talking about who can’t dps the proper way and deserves to be replaced.
---
I do exactly what you stated in your OP and use my leverage as the tank to get exactly what I want, works every time.

What?
---
Why would i have random people in my guild discord and letting them "listen in on the raid"?
---
Who does that lmao.
---
Okay i will look out for those stats ty
---
As a pala healer I appreciate you and your soul stones! Stay wholesome cookie boi!
---
Gz on the mount, there’ll be cheaper zeals anyways.
---
Really nothing will change since now half the people(a layers worth) can’t login.
---
Shadow Priests not able to use Savory Deviate Delight or Noggenfogger while remaining in Shadowform, is this intended?
---
It's on their list of known bugs too lol
---
&gt; If you are a noob, it can be hard to separate random raging from good advice.
---
Ok but if what you're doing isn't working you've got nothing to lose by trying new things out.  If you've been given terrible advice that may not work as well you've lost nothing.
---
Darn it!
---
It sounds like they’re pvping in their pve gear. They don’t plan to get hit in their pve gear so the armor value isn’t relevant. It’s like how rogues are better with swords in pve but better with daggers for pvp.
---
If you are arms prot hybrid you don't use sunders.
---
Revenge &gt; MS &gt; sunder
---
Haha you never know with blizzard. I ganked a warrior on the boat to ratchet and then he decided he would attack me in ratchet after he got back. I just waited there for guards to kill him as I got attacked and laughed. 
---
The guards never came and I died and the cow warrior flew away on his wyvern from the FP
---
Alliance won't need Spy Addon. The clapping of those cheeks will give you away anyway.
---
Er.Td.
---
I decided to roll on Grobb after all these comments and watching vids today.  Porye the Undead Rogue - FOR THE HORDE.
---
Ahh, the douchebags of classic.
