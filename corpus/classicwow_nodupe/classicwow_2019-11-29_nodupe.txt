I can't say for your server, but there's definitely groups forming all the time for level 60 dungeons on my server. UBRS/Strath/DM are the ones I see advertised the most.
---
 
---
That being said, right now is a bit of an off time to be doing dungeons due to:
---

---
- Honor being 1-2 weeks old, so lots of players are farming honor instead of items  
---
- Battlegrounds are 2 weeks away, lots of players are starting twinks or gearing up for PvP  
---
- World bosses can take hundreds of 60's away from dungeons
---
---
---
Yea the bug wasn’t about charging melee. The bug was them “sometimes not charging the furthest person away”.
---
Thanks for your reply /u/KidColfax !
---
Keep those for BRE. Save DKP for viskagg and Brutality blade. 2h is not good for alliance
---
[deleted]
---
All them alliance shamans running around
---
They need to be there for the kill.
---
Yep, Alliance here. Brm is quite shitty I'll admit, but you see way too much other Alliance out and about for this server to have something as bad as a 20-80 split
---
I always do this when lazy fuckers are trying to ghost follow me back to an instance portal
---
They wouldn't charge ranged at all. You didn't even want casters stacking on them cause it wasn't necessary and caused needless damage to them. They are suppose to charge the farthest person always. Someone might be slightly farther away than the others.
---
Wouldn’t that just be some honor farming bot for while he’s afk?
---
Not unless he's constantly rage capped and has a ludicrously high heroic strike uptime, not likely as deep prot if you're playing properly.
---
You can use the claw for lvl 62 mobs and under but for bosses and lvl 63 trash stick to axes.
---
My husband and I play on a PVE realm and we are having a blast. First time we  play a mmorpg together. I don't want this to ever end.
---
I do think it’s late, at least for alliance on Blaumeux but I have heard that the newer servers aren’t bad. By “late” I mean, you will never ever find groups for certain dungeons unless you run it with friends/your guild or your run it with some douche reserving items. That’s a big part of why I love hunter. The three dungeons I mentioned give BiS items and it’s so hard to find groups for them on my server so if I couldn’t solo these dungeons, I wouldn’t be having a good time playing Classic right now.
---
I’m only missing 1 non raid item (Baron cape from Strath UD) and I’ve just given up on it. You can’t solo it and I haven’t seen a group that didn’t have the cape on reserve in over a month now. 
---
As for PvP, hunters are pretty awesome imo. I never feel like I lose a fight just because I’m a hunter. If I lose a fight, it’s always because I did something stupid. I’m not exactly sure how it changes as more content releases but I’m sure I’ll be fine. You will be as long as you practice!
---
An undead*
---
Well we're all older now. Kids, work, etc.
---
They already moved up the release of battlegrounds because of complaints, did you know?
---
who is this btw? Steezy here
---
no changes is already void with the massive server populations
---
[removed]
---
I get that. I'm not asking why. I am sharing my personal observations about max level for OP
---
Im loving shadow pvp, but I guess different strokes. Anyways, you can farm mara as deep holy spec easily.
---
Because i wanted to?
---
There's been a chat delay since launch
---
That's PvE
---
Yeah, its unfortunate but at the same time the pop caps are a lot higher for the server than they used to be, so it kind of evens out in a sense.
---
&gt; N O C H A N G E S
---
Have you seen the server population sizes? They're 4-5 times the size of vanilla wow servers. Changes have already been made
---
Horde racials are better in pvp in classic too but I still obtain a positive winrate on all maps except seething shore and AB in retail. Also different metas effect it differently too. We will see Classic WSG but at the end of the day, Alliance will get in more games than horde per timeframe.
---
It always worked. Some races just can't fit through.
---
I’m not getting groups at all on Blaumeux, alliance. I’ve given up on getting the Baron Cape from Strath UD. At least I’m a hunter who can solo most of my other BiS!
---
This happened to me I found I could hit the I'm stuck button once the boat with my corpse was in bb . I got razzed instantly on the boat
---
*bubbles for 8 seconds of pure immunity while continuing to heal and attack, while you can do absolutely nothing to even attempt to stop it, all the while having a stupidly short cooldown*
---
We noticed a change tanking it for sure. Melee kept getting threat after Wrath. Got it under control now, we just wait a second or two, but was a definite change a couple weeks ago
---
My MP5 gear is worthless in PVP
---
&gt; it's brutal and demanding as a good mmorpg should be im"nolife"o
---
FTFY
---
Orc stealth animation is a ridiculous tiptoeing and Female Undead do a front flip when they Eviscerate.
---
Thanks for the reply. How is the experience on Hydraxian? Are there enough people around?
---
How different is it to a normal PvE server? Are there people interested in casual BGs?
---
Best of luck - I realised after raid that as nice as it would be to have I probably shouldn’t sign a soul contract. I wanted to crank the game; be the MT but instead I get to experience content with a casual yet highly skilled group.
---
Take the binding and roll the dice on MC dropping the second in a reasonable time, then when you have TF enjoy raiding full time. I enjoy Classic WoW but can’t let it dictate me again.
---
I’m jealous, still would take it but I know I shouldn’t.
---
Can confirm. ZT citizen here, and its a shitshow. Youre lucky if you can take a boat or a Zeppelin without the entire other factions rogues popping out.
---
tbh they should, pre-raid bis is kind of terrible for daggers. The Dal'rend combo is by far the highest priority items Rogues can get outside a raid, and playing daggers without an MC dagger will just feel yucky.
---
If you want to PVP before Lobo is available, just go swords 21/3/27, and seeing as you've got swords anyway, go swords in raid until a dagger drops.
---
His dad made wow
---
Knew his name would come up in this thread, haha.
---
I just did scholo for Necropile set and it was easily enough for AoE farming. For raids you can get Winter's chill to fit into your AoE spec without losing too much and I legit don't care about raid gear and I feel bad that we're literally holding onto druid gear to D/E later because we just have 3 druids across our 2 raids and we have 2 of them 8/8 and the other 6/8. 
---
I know I have kind of an addictive personality so I planned things out and  took PTO and levelled and farmed really hard. Now I log in just 3 times a week (2 times to flip items, 1 time to do 2 raids back to back.) With how slow content is coming out there is no FOMO so I play 4 hours a week and really have no need/desire to play more, and my progression is only going to be gated by future releases by Blizz
---
10/10
---
Except they will charge and start attacking another warrior for dominance while that warrior gets healed by their priest and their rogues gank you. Then the warrior will die and ask wtf are you doing, why didn't you heal me?
---
Unless you’re going to BRM or Menethil
---
A fellow Arugal player
---
I'm horde on bene too, just hit 56 and having a real hard time not getting ganked :( going to have to stick to dungeons until 60
---
Yeah if he was right, there would have been all this world pvp happening before the honor patch.  Most people are in it for the grind.
---
Horde players have no honor.
---
Every time.  Its nice, as that's the only herb I stop for in zones that spawn it (gotta chance that swiftthistle).  Apparently I'm much more likely to see spy light up than the node on my minimap.
---
This is tbc prepatch, end of vanilla, thats why Vurtne had water elemental
---
Windows Activate
---
That was fast, I've just sent in a ticket. Unfortunately I won't be able to play today it seems.
---
You got a Hand of Rag in your pocket or you just happy to ~~see~~ heal me?
---
Cuz then you die on the boat or in rachet...
---
Is Pineapple high in salt? Because my doctor said I need to cut back on it.
---
This happened to you one time. Imagine it happening every time you get on it.
---
Great read, preference is what it comes down to. Also did you forget to mention the stam buff? Stam is king in pvp!
---
Name him "edgelord"
---
Actually 12 seconds PAL.
---
Yeah man, that's the way to do it, especially if you have alts. You gotta brute force them to 40+ so the rested xp is actually worth it. I did the same thing at launch so I could get meaningful rested xp during my 60 hour work weeks. And the spec is no biggy as winter's chill, just give up crit damage and run 4/5 shatter and you're good. It's more just the fact that boreal mantle/banthok sash/archmage robes completely outclass their respective slots, so you could get them at essentially no cost to your mages you're supporting. I'm a mage lead in a loot council guild, I totally understand the mindset of getting better gear to people with loftier goals than just farming lol.
---
As a troll rogue on. Incedius, I feel it’s fake news.
---
Why are you using Bloodrobe? Just get something with *shadowdamage. That will have way more of an impact than any other stat
---
It's because the run back for horde cities is atrocious. Ally rogues would be using the same Strat.
---
"hahaha we were only pretending to endlessly whine LOL OWNED U"
---
No it isnt
---
Little followup, just had to transfer an item cross faction and it went fine after I ensured there was nobody else near the 5 auctioneers. Also transfered a lower value "bait" item first just in case.
---
I found for the most part while leveling as shadow, you can heal dungeons straight up with vampiric embrace and the occasional renew
---
world war z zug zug zombies going to eat molten core brain
---
Am also on Felstriker.  Can confirm the Alliance are just as bad as Horde when they have the numbers.
---
Pay attention to the 5 sec rule. (mana regenerates from spirit every 2 sec, but only if it's been 5 sec since the last time you cast something that cost mana) If you can wait a little longer between each heal, you will get more ticks of spirit regen. 
---
Bunching up your  casts also helps with this (casting renew and then casting a heal, means that the entire duration of the heal will be time you can't regen in. Casting a heal and then a renew means that you could potentially get in ticks while you were casting the heal, if you weren't casting anything before. It is not a bad idea to get an addon like fivesecondrule or similar that visualizes when you will get spirit ticks, no matter spec.
---
Downranking is much better when you have gear with +healing. The thing that makes downranking good is that any rank that still has the full cast duration will scale just as much as the max rank, but for less mana. Until you have a decent ammount of+healing gear, downranking is subject to very spesific interactions, and not something i would worry about.
---
Cancel casting is very useful, and something you might as well practice before you start raiding. It means you always have a a heal casting, but you might cancel it if you see that the target doesn't need it. This way you got healing ready "in the pipe" for when the tank takes damage, and you can maximize your time regening for when he isn't .
---
Speak up to the DPS if they regularly take damage. Inform them that the dungeon goes just as fast if you don't have to stop for drinks every pull, and their aggro issue is causing you to spend unnecessary mana. Consider taking it in /w,  so they don't feel like they are being shamed.
---
Oh ok I gotcha
---
Raid logging is definitely a thing. There's not much incentive to continue running dungeons when you're level 60 with full pre-raid BIS, which doesn't take more than 2-3 weeks for committed players. My friends and I all got our BIS some time last month and have hopped back on to Dota because there isn't much else to do in WoW. They don't care about PvP at all so they probably won't do more than raid log until BWL comes out. I'm slowly leveling an alt and planning to do some battlegrounds when it comes out
---
I'd rather just buy gold lol
---
It literally is far worse than several pservers, that's what's so disappointing.
---
Just as easy to farm bad alliance players as board in the forest
---
But alliance squeal more about it
---
same topic from the same people on ~5 servers that are totally one sided. on every other pvp server this happens to both sides. On Kurinnaxx the alliance camps LHC, Thorium Point and Everlook 24/7 and the horde is usually in control of BRM. There is almost always a few alliance druids and rogues on the path between Badlands and Searing Gorge as well. conversely there's usually a pack of Horde riding the boats at Menethil throwing alliance players into the water with MC. Shit happens, if you are on stalagg/skeram we get it it sucks but for the rest of us its fine.
---
Ask people in game. It’s an mmo.
---
Yup. Just go through andorhal/bulwark and you're there. Way quicker as well.
---
I'm a rogue on Kromcrush horde. 
---
Every day, and i mean every bc im on, there's two rogues in our stuff doing that. One in Karg, one in Org. It's the game lol.
---
I rolled alliance to be an underdog. It's way more satisfying to kill cocky horde players than alliance who are usually running away not even wanting to fight.
---
If almost every PvP server have more horde player, how come it's blizzard fault ? 
---
I agree to blame blizzard for a lots of things, but faction is your choice
---
this aint it chief
---
No they don't. Even the biggest private servers were not "taken down by Blizzard".
---
Nostalrius willingly closed down after legal threats, they didn't have to, they could have just moved the server but they chose to shut down to try and appeal to blizzard.
---
BGs are coming soon :)
---
Retail is just the standard version of WOW, as opposed to Classic.
---
that was the norm on servers in vanilla/tbc/wotlk as well, there was practically no servers with 50/50 balance the odds of that even happening are insane.
---
Locks are so op right now i dont see what youre complaining about... other than the faction imbalanced id say you have it better than most
---
on 5 out of dozens of servers. Its not a real problem. Everyone on these servers could quit and the rest of the game is unaffected. You aren't that important
---
[oh.](https://i.imgur.com/NTv5LIV.mp4)
---
How are they OP?
---
That's what you think you look like. [This](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/738/025/db0.jpg) is what it actually looks like, with added salt.
---
They are just attacking when guards aren’t near, not abusing mechanics.
---
Iron grenades, free action potions, flasks, mana potions, hell maybe a few sets of green whelpling armor.
---
Kurinnaxx is 55/45 and both sides are constantly ganking each other all over world. BRM is a warzone, alliance controls thorium point 24/7 so flying into it is suicide, Horde cannot quest in Un'goro without being killed by roving druid death squads, shit happens to both factions.
---
What limited vendor items are worth reselling?
---
This guy called it!
---
I've been there twice to run to ZF for farming. Both times I died instantly on FP and was followed and killed multiple times on my way to ZF as well.
---
Thats if your body is there i dont think it works if your spirit is there
---
nobody cares that you are unsubbing.
---
I legit slept all three days after lasik, my eyes hurt so badly
---
Horde Rogue so your opinion on this should automatically be discarded  
---
of course we give up when facing pure numbers alone. Horde outnumber us 60/40 so going around in large groups is essentially providing horde with free honor - Why would we want that? At least in IF we are safe and dont need to face the numbers.
---
Frank is an arugal celebrity he's in IF 24/7, believe he has a steam as well. 
---
Now he's fighting against horde and alliance colluding and honor trading in brm as well
---
My windows on my laptop literally will not let me activate it.  I can relate to OP.
---
Ive noticed for some reason alliance is always holding BRD while horde always sits on the BRS balcony. And allies always have TP tbf its hard for us to get to BRM past the death squad there or the ones roaming between kargath and the mountain.
---
What's your point? lol
---
Yep I'm missing 15k honor from yesterday that I farmed from 3pm-9pm PST.
---
I like to hang out with you every now and then. Corrupted, 60 gnome warlock here.
---
Preach brother. These moonfires require empowerment.
---
It's pretty common people on reddit can't spot photoshop. I guess because most people view it on their phones and its harder to spot on a small screen. Was super obvious for me on my PC monitor.
---
but the huge difference you didnt mention is instead of a 2500 person server, some servers have 15k ppl. totally changes the dynamic
---
Man I feel bad for you for sending all your gold to people who didn't understand you are new :(
---
You heart is in the right place. Good on you
---
We're not having cross faction Battlegrounds.
---
Err I meant cross realm.
---
I spy CPT in your raid. I raided with him a lot on private servers!
---
Wish I had a squad of friends to play with.
---
Haha who is fucking stupid enough to join Olympus
---
It is literally the main reason they have subs atm.
---
It's doable with a life I hit 60 in about 17 hours /played so I'm by no means a tryhard compared to the hours and efficiency some people manage but I got to 60 right before phase 2 dropped, they have pve servers for people not trying to be as competitive but if you play a pvp server you are versus players and thus competing with them, getting to 60 is a part of that competition. 
---
There are pve servers without it, plenty of other games, and retail. I hope it gets better for you and you can enjoy classic though!
---
i dont know im playing a rogue and i did my burst after first wrath last week and then popped vanish to reset threat and then still had ragnaros hit me over other melees after 2nd wrath
---
Come to darnassus fire department on pyrewood alliance. We're looking for social players as well as raiders
---
&gt; I made a comment based on the OP's implication that this is a Horde only activity. 
---
You read it that way because you are sensitive.
---
No they wouldn't. Not because they don't want to, but they can't get enough people, and even if they did, they would get punished for it by horde raids coming for revenge, nothing that won't happen to the horde.
---
Players do what the game allows them to do. Of course alliance would do this if the game allowed them to but it is a lot easier for horde (on most servers) to do this and not get severely punished for it.
---
My interpretation is that it’s used in two ways
---
* Edgelords who are telling other players to quit WoW Classic and create a character in the modern retail WoW since it’s easier. Usually in PvP, while someone is being ganked (similar usage to ‘u suck’ or ‘git gud’).
---
* People mocking the people above.
---
Notably, the Horde use it because Horde/Alliance cross-speak is garbled but there are gibberish strings you can copy/paste that will read as somewhat legible to the enemy.
---
If the Horde says “a c ‚ c ÇÈ ‚ f 30” then the Alliance will read “g o t o re t a il”
---
1g or so? Wow.
---
That’s true I also only sub for classic I just don’t think blizzard realise that there is a large population of people who sub like it. I think their main focus is retail even though many would like more focus on classic.
---
Fear. Soul link
---
It's actually almost always way worse on TBC servers, AoE silence is mad strong and once they get Paladins there's no reason to play ally if you intend to PvP.
---
Same, missing like 40-50k honor. Really dumb when trying to push top ranks. I have no idea if my hours of play are worth anything.
---
Are you (and everyone else with similar issues) trying to buy mats and post pots immediately after? If so your not likely to get much because AH balances out fast. 
---
Some pots have 20-30s profit margins or higher - other pots solely rely on good deals. Its hard when you can barely stock yet I had 2 AH Loads of pots (40 of each) prepared ahead of time I could afford to buy herbs throughout the week instead of 1 day at a time. 
---
With enough liquid gold (without losing money from incomplete inventory) I log in once or twice a day to buy - the cheaper I get my mats the higher the profit margin.
---
This is generic, you have to find what works but my main is a Prot Warrior and I refuse to sell tanking or farm inefficient. Just via alchemy on a lvl 40 alt with zero gathering and 50g seed money from my broke-ass main I have created wealth - my methods haven’t changed I just reinvested everything into materials over 2 weeks everyday.
---
I have 150g atm - I make about 400g in sales on a good day and half on a bad day with 10-20% profit margin. I don’t farm and I use TSM Grouping and Operations which is so basic anyone can work it including my friend who doesn’t play WoW.
---
TLDR: Have good AH scans, buy cheap herbs over days / weeks. Reinvest everything - its tedious and for a few weeks you’ll be broke, profits are small but compounding. Once you have 40+ of every potion your listing you end up with a TSM automated listing of 200+ potions at a time - 1 listing a day being 200-400g.
---
Indeed, you only ever shield a druid or warrior tank, if they are about to die and you need time to cast a big heal.
---
On pallies though, you spam that shield!
---
Greetings from gehennas horde!
---
Fairbanks ally I had no lag for chat, or my wand attack animation. Horde on bleamex or w.e, sometimes the chat is like a second behind sometimes it's 30 seconds and my wand animations don't go Everytime even tho I can see the wand damage hitting.
---
That day won’t come because queues won’t be too bad even with the unbalance.
---
As a hunter main I used the money I made farming DM to make a warrior and I've loved it. It only works in world PvP with another person or two, but it feels like a very natural alt for a hunter. 
---
My warrior was essentially fully BiS when it hit 60 because basically every piece of gear can either be bought, solo farmed on the hunter, or obtained from quests. A day after hitting 60 my warrior was stronger DPS in MC than my near full raid BiS hunter.
---
Finally someone who knows how computers work.
---
I wouldn't waste pots and other consumables inside a BG. Certainly not a flask.   That's especially so with AV.    And BTW, there are vendors who sell pots, bandages, food, drink that can only be used inside the BG, but at very low prices.
---
We have a couple of ally rogues doing the exact same thing in Kargath all day on Firemaw. I think you'd have to be a little funny in the head to do that.
---
Frank is beloved. Dude will get kills anywhere in the city, even right in front of the ah.
---
Name of my black lab that passed away. Sorry my pets name isn't some stupid meme.
---
Rogue, planning on doing BRD pickpocket runs to make gold at 60. I know you need max pickpocket and lockpicking (for the gate). What's the quickest way to level those? Should i try to level them while I'm still leveling my character, or just powerlevel them once I hit 60?
---
Thanks pal
---
So not like dire mauls chest?
---
Oh yes I like this, I hope this becomes a thing.
---
Get your mount, you will make a ton more money after 40. Your 100g feels hard earned now, but you will have another 100g in no time now.
---
What a pile of horseshit. Factions are ganking each other everywhere. If the faction imbalance is too high it doesn't matter who it is, either one will take full advantage of it.
---
It means "you're not tough enough for old school classic, go back to BFA carebear"
---
To be fair IRL waterfalls are loud as fuuuuck
---
you literally just proved his point lol
---
I'm gonna get downvoted to the abyss but... you're horde and that's just lame. For the Alliance!
---
Bfa?
---
This is an insult to the brave Horde battling an unwinnable war on Heartseeker. Fight on brothers...
---
Well, you could have saved some time because I already wrote this up there Billy Bob.
---
A C T I V A T E W I N D O W S
---
I'll roll whatever fits really. Swords is far superior to dagger here on horde, so I will very slowly transition into swords, AFTER all the non dagger rogues has gotten their swords. So by the time BWL is on farm, I'll probably have a viskag+brutality blade while the sword rogues rock maladath + CTS. And after that we'll see. I picked daggers first due to the power in PVP as I'm currently ranking, hell I might get rank14 so weapons won't be an issue then lol
---
YouTube: leveling a hunter wow classic
---
Nice I get this haha thank you for the breakdown, zeitgeist revealed haha
---
Yeah man, having a blast on Tetris99 so far!!!!
---
THE MERRIMENT CEASES HENCE!
---
wish you were on my server for the free honor every 24 hours
---
When you tab out or move to your second monitor the game defaults to a locked 30fps.
---
I have a 165hz ips, 8700k @ 5ghz, and a water cooled 1080ti.
---
I have zero issues with FPS.
---
Whatever you think buddy, I don't have to explain myself to you.
---
He kills priests too.
---
Source: he's permanently on my shit list after our winterfall village encounters.
---
You could like force server change and cap to 1:1 ratio.
---
There isnt a thing that Blizz couldnt do if they wanted (as far as WoW Classic goes..).
---
The BGs will change everything.
---
your lack of intelligence has shown in this post.
---
missing 9k honor from yesterday
---
I've had some success in the caves/tunnels in South winterspring (same spot you farm elite demons for Eye). The arcane crystal drop rate is atrocious, I've seen figures around 3%, but I was able to farm 60 or so ore this morning in an hour.
---
Main spec refers to the item benefitting the player in the spec that they MAINly play. It doesn’t mean you can call yourself a dagger rogue and expect daggers to be thrown at you over other people who also could use it for their main spec.
---
If everyone has it then it will be an even playing field. If it's an even playing field then it's a non-issue.
---
Did you not see the numbers for classic? they know where there money is. they're lazy and shitty not stupid.
---
Explore the towns a little and you'll have it memorized in no time :)
---
Battle for Azeroth, the latest expansion for "normal" wow
---
yeah true that, I was already horde but I rerolled to belf rogue for that sweet sweet arcane torrent that was ridiculous. Shadowstep into a clothy, ambush, pop that, silence and gain back 30 energy back then just unload on their ass with impunity. Those were the days.
---
not only that me and all my bros rolled orc warriors on every server and we camp at the tauren starting zone and mock newbie warriors, this guy is done for!
---
The thing with disenchant mats is they don't have a listing fee. So a lot of times people will put them up for way higher then they will actually sell for.
---
The general rule I follow is if its armor I disenchant if its a weapon i just vender it.
---
Pre-emptive earthbind, grounding totem, magma totem (r1), poison clensing totem. That helps a *bit*. Baiting interrupts is a huge skill but lord knows I'm not good enough to do it. For taurens at least though, hearthstone and any healing spell have identical cast animations/colours.
---
Beyond that though, pvp trinkets/items are huge. Goblin rocket helm. gnomatic net projector, stun/slow/snare clense trinket, R3 pvp trinket. Lots of realistically achievable items that can CC a single person who sticks onto you enough to escape.
---
Alliance don’t pvp. They get gabled by superior horde players then log into Reddit to write a manifesto
---
Or they could just, keep and tune sharding. One wonders if it cant be, that they actually did know whats gonna happen.
---
Sometimes community isnt smarter than Blizz..
---
And Ive already seen few times when Blizz listened to community and it turned in complete shitshow thanks to that.
---
that's the exact opposite of what you're doing.
---
focus fire.
---
The minority are the loggers actually.
---
Bro I don’t think you really read what I put I wasn’t arguing with them just pointing out how blizzard isn’t really prioritising classic when they should be. 
---
Wait I reread your comment now and I misunderstood you
---
All these people act like they can't get portals from mages.
---
Lmao!!! Another post about horde ganking and ratios!!!!!
---
the dudes literally always there
---
Ahh thank you! Haha sorry for the aloofness
---
I usually just find a guildie that's also in Ironforge and trade them everything I need and then have them trade it back.
---
Can confirm, its just as bad for horde on HS. I cant sit in org if I'm flagged, and kargath has at least 5 rogues at all times.
---
Really hoping bg's help the issue. I'd like to play the game again.
---
I shall fight the encroaching horde if they attack my brethren. But only if there is honour
---
even easier, go into WPL from the path in hinterlands which runs right beside the alliance town. Then double back down the river, up the path to alterac, thru chillwind, then bulwark and boom you're there.
---
alliance good folk, horde cringe edgelords confirmed
---
You made a post because of that? Wtf?
---
Spy just to make reddit cry
---
I did that a bit. He probably watches videos on YouTube or browses Reddit and just gets some honor farming done too.
---
what chat delay?
---
Where are you guys playing? I’m ally on bene and brd is stuffed full of horde at all times.
---
I do this exact same thing. It’s a blast.
---
Thats The Spirit of Wow classic 👍🏼
---
Everyone else covered spell choice.  Biggest thing though is to put two points into Healing Focus in holy to get the 70% spell pushback protection.  That means you can successfully heal even when you have a mob on you.  5/5 Divine Fury is also very useful as you level up and heal spell cast times get longer.  You don't need to go any further into the Holy tree though to be effective, the rest is efficiency more than anything else.
---
Not if you smoke weed
---
Why not dalrends? And yes, BRE will still be best for pvp and good for 2h fury in pve, though still not as good as 1h fury with viskag/brut I believe
---
we had both bindings on our raid leader when he was only lvl 58
---
The 80H:20A ratio on their server as a non-stealth pvp class makes a lot of sense.
---
Free action potions, mystery meat, fadeleaf will probably go up in price too
---
I played a ton up until Lich King, but then the game got too complex for me. Trinkets this, valor that, coins here, points there. I stopped playing for a long time.
---
But now with Classic I feel back at home, I like to play a warrior and run around and bash stuff. By myself mostly.  I play to relax.... retail is too involved for me anymore.
---
And we all know Asmon is the paragon of Whit and friendliness. Asmon can't win without ratting somewhat out for what also does.
---
If you’re dying while having 80 coordinated people, your guild is shit. That’s a YOU problem.
---
That's just server balance issues. I'm on a balanced one and stealth helps but isn't critical.
---
You didnt mention BRD or UnGoro where you cant turn in more than 1 quest before getting ganked and having to run 10min across the map to get back. Fuck Ali
---
You keep saying this, without any data to back it up.  Obviously, if enough people from enogh servers are commenting about it, it's more widespread than 5 servers.
---
Kromcrush represent!! Martian - Dwarf hunter
---
So what you are saying is, pay to win is just fine?
---
Who does your website? That is awesome.
---
lmao
---
I kinda said that
---
17 hours to 60? Must not have rolled a warrior. I stopped playing Classic at Level 40 because no one wanted a warrior in groups (only zoomer mages), and solo grinding in Tanaris as a warrior is painful.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Tried to get back into it, but now the zones are empty so it's like why bother?
---
Your reading comprehension is poor and/or you are a total noob who doesn't know about invis pots.
---
Great look.
---
Try reading what I wrote instead of being outraged after the first word.
---
&gt; Of course alliance would do this if the game allowed them to but it is a lot easier for horde (on most servers) to do this and not get severely punished for it.
---
I'm writing exactly what you're saying, but sure, I'll let you think that's a pile of horseshit if you want.
---
Because you could use more than 1 warrior, and not risk wiping.  The dps of 1 warrior wont matter.  The locks can still banish after you establish threat too.  You are getting pummeled for no reason.
---
I find the concept of speed an interesting concept, considering the raids that would do this kind of crap waste hours getting all the world buffs too.  Its kind of a contradiction.
---
And yet, they're still dont even know that you can't spam demo shout for aoe threat.
---
Ahhh so I shouldn't have vendored every mystery meat I've found since playing classic. Noted
---
Your best pvp spell is purge, use it.

It's probably too late to invest. From my experience on private servers prices are usually higher or at least as high the month before content comes out than they are when it releases due to a combination of last minute speculation and people buying what they will need in advance. If you want to speculate and invest you need to think long term and invest in things that raise in value when AQ or Naxx releases.
---
I see pots sometimes selling for less than the cost of the mats on my server.
---
That's great, thanks. It's good to get confirmation. Cheers!

Try getting near Thrall. It's impossible to hear anything else

I’m a priest and plan on not doing this.

---
Why would anyone farm honor? Seems like an obvious enough answer.
---
I understand your frustration, but people on this sub are generally casuals and idiots.
---
They aren't worth listening to and telling them anything is useless because they won't believe anything that they don't want to happen regardless of any evidence.
---
For example, the idiots around here think there won't be queues times for horde side battle grounds.
---
It is likely that some of these morons will have stopped reading this comment to tell me about cross server battle grounds or something else as stupid. They will totally ignore the fact that across all servers, horde greatly outnumber alliance. They will discount any evidence such as censuses or logs.
---
I'm sorry the imbecils lied to you.
---
What's the best channel in-game to look for guilds, or say you're looking for one? How would you join that channel even?
---
There's a discord out there, but the recruitment posts I saw were days apart, with no replies. Forums even?
---
*Edit: am on an EU alliance server.*
---
Happening everywhere. Worried this is an extension of the 3am reset causing all honor until 7am to be lost basically meaning all honor between like 4pm and 7am next day is worthless. The display error thing is a complete lie for the 3am to 7am bug.
---
&gt;I have no idea if my hours of play are worth anything.
---
We've been asking ourself this question for 15 years now lol.
---
About the lotro LFG tool specifically, your description reminded me of the LFG tool WoW had in the TBC expansion. 
---
how it functioned is people could list themselves onto the tool for up to 3 dungeons and other people could use the tool to pull up the list of people looking for dungeons, you'd whisper them "hey you want to group up?" and then you'd manually build the group up and fly to the dungeon. 
---
from what i've read very few people used this tool in retail TBC and mostly stuck to chat channels still, which i'm quite surprised about. most people dislike the modern LFD tool introduced in Wrath because it automatically transports you to the dungeon and automatically sets the group up for you which ruins the adventurous feel for some people when they can level up from like 10 -&gt; 100 just by standing in their capital city and spamming dungeons. 
---
the TBC LFG tool on the other hand doesn't automate anything and just sets up a useful list for you to pull people from and manually set the group together. i actually think its perfect and is completely within vanilla's spirit, which makes me puzzled on why people say that nobody wanted to use it.
---
Reminds me I'm somewhat jealous of shadowmeld for pvp shenanigans.
---
I get that, but there may be an audience for watching people do mundane tasks. Hell, there’s Mario streamers that have spend multiple days worth of streaming working on one level.
---
Honor spy might not be totally accurate. 
---
That being said I think I’m missing honor but haven’t been tracking it closely enough to be certain, pretty sure some is missing but can’t say how much.
---
Except it isn't but keep telling yourself that.
---
If you are affected by this bug please open a ticket and post on the forum thread [here.](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/honor-not-being-calculated-3-8-am/371752)

Premades will flash. I guarantee it.

How are people shop good at this? I can only keep it up for a few seconds max.
---
Send em to Heartseeker where the Alli only PVP in areas 20 levels lower than them and in packs of 5 or more because their neckbearded asses finished all the content already.  The are lifeless wastes of the blubbery husks they embody!  If you're mad, I'm talking directly to you.  I have spoken.  You fucking Skin-Beard
---
Oh boo hoo. Try climbing as a healer when you’re always first target in group pvp
---
I'm a WL and I pretty much have nothing much left anymore. The only stuff I need are these super rare drops like Spellpower Ring, ManaCord, Spellpower Trinket from MC. 
---
I got my Mageblade, Choker, Kazzak Pants and T2 Head.
---
It's the same on Fairbanks. Sometimes you'll get lucky but most often you'll still get gang banged even at the witching hour.
---
In general people advertise for guilds in the "LookingForGroup" channel.
---
That being said, I'd say run some instances/quests with random people, if they left you with a good impression, ask them a bit more about their guild and if it's what you're looking for ask to join.

There’s no magical addon default setting that’s fucking the market on the item you’re selling. It’s literally just other players. Yes, people really undercut that much. If you play on a big server it’s actually crazy. Recipe: LIP sunk from 50+ to 7 in a matter of hours. Essence of Air falls 5-10g from around 1-3pm every day on my server, when most people log and start undercutting each other).
---
&gt;i think it night have a couple thints wrong
---
Sure, that's understandable.
---
&gt;the calculations heavily overvalue weapon skill past 7
---
Would be interested to know what kind of overvaluing it seems to be doing. It seems to apply the glancing blow formula correctly (going from 85% average glancing damage at 5 weapon skill to 95% average glancing damage at 8 weapon skill). I think all it does past 8 is to give the appropriate 0.1% hit per weapon skill, up to 15. It could end up overvaluing hit a bit past 6% because it doesn't seem to be accounting for HS queue cancelling. It might be accurate for a player who doesn't do HS queue cancelling.
---
&gt;One example is that with both distracting dagger and core gloves, it still thinks muggers belt is better than onslaught girdle
---
You should double check that claim. It seems incorrect. I'm seeing a 10 dps loss.
---
Anathema checking in. These racist horde memes need to stop. All I want is 50/50 split
---
Doesnt matter. It's all we know. My point is advertise is worse in almost everyway
---
Are you trying to be the top rated warrior of all time? If no, then Tauren will be fine.
---
Well it is griefing, but griefing is not against the rules of the game.

What is each potion/flask in there?

After copping devilsaurs and that hit trinket shit started getting good. Also used only axes cause I rolled orc

You might want to look up "willingly" lol. Sure, there wasn't a verdict yet that *forced* them to shut down, but let's be realistic. How far would those people come in a lawsuit against ACTIVISION BLIZZARD?
---
You don't get why Alliance on a PVE server would refuse duels? And why they somehow parse lower on their casters than horde dps even with Paladins and better racials for PVE on my server? 🤔🤔🤔
---
eh fucking gaming corporations, fuck this business
---
Thanks Jerry, appreciate the communication.
---
Im on number 11. Send help pls...
---
Well I think you cannot really invest right now. My guess is, a lot of people are stacked with items maybe twink gear and will flush the market as soon as bgs go online, so prices will go down. Right now is pretty much a bubble. If you have stuff, try and sell it now.
---
But you could still invest for p3 stuff, I guess
---
Missing 10k honor, quitting if this continues.
---
How pretentious do you have to be to blame market prices on *ignorant addon users*. What in the literal fuck?
---
Flexing on him with dem banana shoulders
---
Lhc camped on thunderfury too
---
The terrible design choice being more people wanting to play Horde on PVP servers?
---
Once they catch the gold selling account they'll just ban him. There's no reason for a known gold seller to buy random garbage for way more than it's worth. I was even banned for this when selling a twink item to a gold seller, obviously buying gold.
---
Farmed 160 hks yesterday, now it says I have 15 hks.  Between this and not being able to farm honor between 3-7am this is ridiculous. Ive wasted so much time farming honor and getting nothing for it. Im glad I didnt put much effort in yesterday because the 3-7am bug has been so demoralizing to my gametime.
---
But you weren't just having fun though, you were doing it for recognition. Gotcha.
---
&gt;classic is packaged as a benefit of having a retail wow subscription.
---
Then there are people like me. Quit almost a decade ago during Cata and now came back this year for classic. I don't have the current retail addon, so that subscription is a wet fart for me. Lots of people basically just pay for classic.
---
Believe me! I’ve never made any false statements that you’re aware of!

That's the wow market for you, buddy.

This is a good tip for life in general.

If your priests are spamming flash heal on boss fights you need to replace them.
---
Edit: Vanilla raiding is nothing like Mists.... Thats comparing apples to chocolate
---
Missing half my kills from today. Also, when did honor calculation randomly change to early evening eastern time? Two days in a row I've logged in at 8 Eastern and honor already calculated to "yesterday's kills".
---
Whatever happened on Tuesday's maintenance totally fucked things up.
---
Pretty sure it's meant as an illustration, not a screenshot.
---
It's times like these I love having a second account so I can whisper these kind of people asking why.
---
My friends all quit too. That's why I'm migrating in addition to getting slaughtered. if you want to reroll to horde PvE come along. Don't have to level together ofc but can share in each others pain.
---
Righteous orbs go for 20g on my server and 35 on yours? What the hell
---
Blamo has.1 nelf rogue in ogr do this all day
---
Same server, there's literally always an alliance rogue doing the same thing in Kargath and Orgrimmar. I get it's to farm honor, but it sounds dreadfully boring to do that for hours every day.
---
Fuck magic
---
Don't pretend horde is in any way dominating Gehennas world pvp. Last night it took me over 30 minutes to run from Camp Mojache to Dire Maul as horde.
---
Rag has no aggro for ranged attackers at all.  Just bomb immediately.
---
guess he's just an idiot then
---
Can you accept battleground queue while dead?
---
No one has too. Just buy portals or if you are engineering use your teleporter.
---
boring
---
I got my epic mount, im basically raid logging for now, i only have a few upgrades out of dungeons which i'll get before p3. Its honestly kinda nice to have some time off for holidays
---
I don't doubt I've missed the timing, I don't think there will be any big waves until the next tier of content, but I do think the amount of casuals far outweighs the amount of tryhards so that'd be the bigger market
---
Dude you could have your damn server on Mars. The server isn't the one being sued, the administrators are/were being sued for breach of copyright.

Ah another horde on incendius I feel your pain. I can’t tell if horde is outnumbered or filled with pve heroes
---
I’ve had really fun experiences on Kromcrush as a Horde player for the most part. Assholes still exist, sure, but I only have enough time to play a few hours a week and haven’t dedicated any time anywhere else. It’d be cool to see a sticky post that highlights some experiences of people on different servers.
---
then play shadow
---
because the alliance players are totally "trolling" and not actually mad, at all, right...
---
Yes.
---
Same
---
If you could just send all those rage potions this way that would’ve great... c:
---
Don’t have the gold to respec twice each week for raids, and the money I do have is going toward gear I need to make. Got a mage up to lv18 to eventually be my gold farmer but that’s on hold for now.
---
You got plenty of time. There is no reason to rush anything in classic. MC is in farm status for pretty much everyone and the honor system implementation is keeping the neck beards busy. Just have fun with it. It’s always a good time to start and join the nostalgia trip!
---
my point is it's not a "learning over time" thing, people were just bad
---
the scientific process behind "we want to kill rag -&gt; rag and many mc bosses are immune to fire -&gt; we should NOT enchant our weapons with fiery weapon" isn't something that takes an entire expansion to figure out unless you're a bad player
---
I can't access google from work by search for the youtube video of Hydra solo farming Mara as holy. It's viable. 
---
He also did a video of himself doing Mara wearing no gear (as shadow, mind you) but that goes to show how it can be done.
---
I'm missing actual honorable kills that I farmed.  Completely gone from my Yesterday, Today, and This Week on my honor page. Not talking about honorspy. Literally all the honor I farmed yesterday is just gone.
---
My favorite NBA team.
---
no
---
those people have clearly never been to Australia
---
&gt; A slur is a slur don't use them here.
---
yea thats the wrong line of thinking he is talking about
---
Aha. Assumed so but someone was telling me otherwise. Doesn't work in combat either from what I remember?
---
Is that why all horde capitals have backdoors while none of the alliance capitals have one? And don't say the tram because that requires you to literally get through the single front entrance.
---
I mean, it's plus damage *and* healing.
---
HOW CAN THERE BE SO LITTLE TO DO IN COMBAT AS A RET PALLY
---
And no one cares because they just wait for GMs to finally mention something before stopping, knowing they won't get banned.
---
I think you're hitting a soft spot on some of these redditors haha
---
Paladin FTW!
---
Shamans want a lot of mp5 and +healing for resto
---
Which would really suck for someone who is trying to get their friends to play or wants a 2nd account.
---
I can’t remember the website to look at populations but it’s like 65-45 ally on incedius.
---
Goin on your own premise that the game is broken as it is. Because the situation on your server =every server.
---
So would that be spirit and intellect?
---
Do it with weakaura
---
Is there any numbers to support the 70-30 server ratio? Aside from “ to everybody knows that, bro.”
---
So tell me, why didn't Blizzard just sue light's hope or elysium and get them shut down? They were both super popular servers with 50k+ active players.
---
Every post you make is just further showing your ignorance on this subject.
---

---
You can auto unstuck to your corpse or spirit healer.
---
over 30 minutes oh my dear goodness that must be immensely terrible for you I can’t believe you had to go through that awful experience
---
As I stated in the first comment that you clearly didn't read: "What the stats are good for is making sure that the realm you're rolling on has a healthy population of players clearing end game content", the website shows how many clears endgame content and logs it. If at any point and time, 1/40 players in your raid group has connected their account to Warcraftlogs and enabled logging for classic, all 40 players will get logged through that player. So my guesstimate of the amount of players logging only being 40% is as I said, EXTREMELY GENEROUS. odds are, the website shows the mass majority of level 60 players clearing end game content as of now.
---
If you care how active the server you're rolling on is, odds are that you have a goal of clearing end game content. Knowing how many players clear end game content on said realm would then be the only relevant factor to you along with faction balance. If both horde and alliance have a similar amount of players logging raids, it would also not be too far fetched to say that the overall population is also similar.  
---
I'm not comparing apples and oranges, infact, I'm not even COMPARING anything. I'm simply reading the data for what it is and making a conclusion about it.

If you're gonna respond, please do it in a more constructive manner. You typing "uh oh apple pineapple uh oh" isn't getting us anywhere.

You can travel from the elven area to the north

---
All this time I was wondering if there are more of us alliance on reddit  but you got a point there, what you said maybe true... alliance are just whiny. I am ashame
---
If anything... AQ has the biggest build up? Half of azeroth has silithid related quests where you try to understand where they come from / who or what is controlling them (I think?)
---
I never read any quests but even I noticed that lol
---
It's a hex value, created upon character creation. Hex is 0-9 and A-F. So just treat A-F like 10-15 and you can figure out whose is higher or lower. 
---
If this WA is the same one I'm thinking of, it sorts them from smallest to largest anyway, so in this case just read from the top.
---
Yeah its not a faction specific thing.  Players act the same for the most part.  Just so happens that horde have the numbers on most servers this time around.  I'm alliance on skeram which is super horde favored and I don't get mad at the horde because I know if the tables were flipped and alliance outnumbered horde, we'd be doing the same thing.
---
Yeah but clicking unstuck takes 10 secs and summons u to a spirit healer = max distance is 10 sec or more if u run to corpse :p
---
Easiest way is to find an Alliance mage 50+ and ask for a portal to Darnassus, this may cost you between 25s-1g, but will save you a lot of time. From Darnassus take the portal near the bank, and from there you can catch the boat to Auberdine. 
---
The slightly more difficult way is to go to Ironforge, travel through Loch Modan, head through Wetlands and reach Menethil Harbor. The boat there will take you to Auberdine. 
---
When you are in Auberdine, and you can run down to Ashenvale, and from there you can access a tunnel that takes you to Stonetalon.
---
Menethil Harbor in wetlands, take the right boat.  Then hoof it out to Stonetalon from there.
---
Getting zerged by literally 12 against 4 is really fun.
---
Unfortunately no, I'm having the same problem as listed in this thread  [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dxlx7w/how\_long\_for\_realm\_transfer/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dxlx7w/how_long_for_realm_transfer/)
---
[We tried nothing and we're all outta ideas!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOTyUfOHgas)
---
Make a character on a server.
---
Do a series of /who during your timezone.
---
Then you'll have some data to back your decision.
---
Quick update: After some testing it pains me to say, like some of you have already mentioned, the trinket is nothing special and far from a game changer for any class in pvp or pve. 
---
The heal support it provides will only trigger when you are below 40% life and will stop once you reach that threshold. However, this seems random and inconsistent. There were times where I was at 10% life or below and instead of healing it would just keep casting it's lightning attack over and over until the 30second timer.
---
 In fairness, the lightning blasts are fast and pretty damaging, usually hitting from 245-295, but any good player in PvP can just kill it immediately and carry on the fight without much of a scratch. Time will tell how effective it will be in BG's but I'm not expecting much.
---
 For PvE it's pointless unless maybe you are farming a difficult mob and need a little extra dps boost once every 10 minutes? I dunno. And forget about using it in raids unless you're doing it for the meme's. 
---
In conclusion,  the timbermaw trinket is nothing more than a gimmick novelty item. If you do decide to waste countless hours farming for it like I did, don't do so with high expectations... you will be thoroughly dissapointed.
---
Hey just a quick question 
---
As a rogue the pickpocket open macro is as followed
---
#showcast
---
/cast Pickpocket
---
/cast [opener]
---
Right?
---
Really shows just how horrible people are at this game.
---
This is the situation on Skeram at the moment.  All of the casuals transferred or quit and the remaining alliance players are on average more skilled and determined as result.
---
Theres literally no good servers to play on atm so..
---
K3 merged with k1-2 is old as fuck, and anything ely related is garbage.
---
Can confirm, I have water retention issues due to the salinity of all the alliance tears I’ve been drinking. But as they say “you should drink a gallon of water everyday!”
---
Sure
---
Yeah now that I've got a good amount of runs under my belt I'm starting to feel a bit more confident that I could handle princess as holy/disc but that extra 15% from shadowform was a big help when just starting out trying solo runs
---
https://wowclassicpopulation.com/activity
---
Pick a server that's pvp. You'll see almost every pvp server has 2-3 times the number of alliance on concurrently.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=19120
---
I think he meant “my” raids or was referring to a guild. It wouldn’t make any sense if he meant the xpac. Flash heal does get used a lot for raid healing.
---
Can't really trust those websites that show population anymore tbh.  Blizz apparently broke the function the census addons need to work a couple months ago.  [This website](https://ironforge.pro/servers?region=us&amp;filter=true) says horde outnumber ally 60/40 but I saw another site a little while back showing the alliance outnumber horde.
---
Kirtnos always horde rogues, too bad for them I'm a druid. I enjoy watching them vanish into faerie fire.
---
you don't see a bunch of orcs and undeads having RP sex in razorhill inn, either
---
so alliance = enjoys RP sex and whines about getting ganked
---
Nice fucking game.
---
cus they are goblin guards
---
Well I have no idea about vanilla servers tbh. WotLK on the other hand is a blast.
---
Most players either got their dungeon gear and starting raidlogging, or doing pvp, or leveling alts. And those few who still need gear well they really do not want to dungeons while theres mass murder everywhere close to dungeons.. well if you are on a pvp server that is.
---
They still get the tier gear and use it in pvp
---
Yeah, lets beat the 10 Horde camping the entrance with our 5 man party.
---
ez
---
Niceuu
---
That's a whole different level of masochism :P
---
15 hks in the same week gets you scout/private title.
---
Hello fellow Kromcrusher. I've literally stopped playing since P2. It isn't fun for me anymore as alliance.
---
9 Minutes?! O_O
---
What camera did you use?
---
It’s supposed to be in place before the server gets super imbalanced.
---
Who's the tank?
---
So, as Alliance, you really have two options to cross continents.
---
1. As you already know, Booty Bay to Ratchet.
---
2. Wetland's Menethil Harbor can take you to either Theramore in Dustwallow Marsh or to Auberdine in Darkshore.
---

While the faction imbalance is definately a factor. The biggest issue by far is the overall number of players on any given server. World pvp can be tolerable when you can fit in some other activities between engaging in pvp. In its current state on high pop servers the 50-60ish level zones have populations relative to space that could be comparable to some battlegrounds.  As much as there is a faction imbalance the issues persist exactly the same way that you experience it on the opposite side. You dont want to believe it because the essence of pvp is to create an adversarial mindset. It it may be one sided. It is still a game of who has the biggest group.
---
Virtually no quests or story. Just a big empty zone for the most part.
---
The raid and loot tracking is awesome. I use a spreadsheet for it, but i would love something like this. Well done.
---
Fun is a weird way of describing it. If you want to interact with any of the NPCs that aren't chasing PvPers you should prepare to die. Logging in at the inn and running to the Alliance FP is usually 2 corpseruns even with honorless buff.
---
Also shadow is dope don't get me wrong I have fun with it but healers in PvP can be a big help and I don't mind healing
---
The furbolg does indeed stay summoned once swapped out. I could experiment more with this for sure.
---
They will tell you top ask a guard.
---
&gt;you're going to want BRE
---
BRE is more proc dependant, and even less likely to be effective when you're cc'd, as you say. Also BRE doesn't have as much stamina. It's situationally better, not an outright winner. Also it's better against clothies, but less consistent against clothies that can cc you... 
---
&gt;You're also never using HoJ.
---
Even if this were the case, which it isn't, you'd still have 5% vs 0%, as opposed to 7% vs 2%. So sword specialization still wins in my opinion. 
---
&gt;mace stun is king
---
Mace stun can be nice, but nothing beats the feeling of seeing multiple sword spec procs take an opponent 100-0 before you can even say "Greatsword of the Brotherhood".
---
I still remember the first time I dueled with the trinket our front of Org. Warrior charged me and cleaved the furbolg down with a one hit kill. It was all down hill from there.
---
Well at least you have one more rep exalted, only 20 more to go
---
Horde is legit useless on incendius. They let alliance sit on zeppelins and in the courtyard of undercity all day and refuse to PvP.
---
Alliance does not take it from behind.
---
I already have Archmage and then run 4/5 necropile for AoE (Archmage is essentially 0 time, I just skilled up tailoring one week while I was raiding on main.) I have Sash from helping our OT grind Savage Gladiator Chest (he made me dps AND heal... The fucker.) Mantle from Stilgis would give me like 30 more dps but our guild is fairly time efficient and part of my deal is I don't have to tryhard since I'm doing the guild a favor (I play hearthstone during B raid and sell enchants on my bank alt lol. I don't have to be on voice comms, I don't have to decurse on boss fights, I just have to keep winter's chill up on trash and bosses and not die)
---
When we transition from 32 mans to 25 mans (probably in the next 2 weeks, just need to recruit more good druids and 1 more hunter who knows what they're doing) I will have to pull more weight but the way I look at it is that every hour that I spend on grinding gear is 50-60 gold less than I can grow by flipping  and eventually I will get tossed gear from MC once everyone else gets gear. (I make about 25% margin buying raid consumes when they are cheap on weekends and then buying out the cheap ones and jacking up the price on Tuesday. I do feel bad when I see guildies buying them from me because they're overpriced so I refund them my margin.) so it's not just missing out on 50-60 gold but 50-60 gold compounded weekly. My goal is to fill my bank alt's bank and bags with flasks of supreme power. I'm still only 60% there and when I do finish my goal I can finally raidlog in peace!
---
How do three sticks tied together with a slight green glow look more bad ass than a giant bloody notched sword?
---
All bout that gang shit, smash that movement key boys!
---
Indeed!
---
&gt; It’s all about perspective I guess.
---
No its not, you're just a bold faced liar. We can't even get groups for BRD on alliance because no one wants to step foot anywhere near burning steppes or thorium point. I tried to do it 2 days ago and there were multiple full raid groups of horde literally running up and down the entire path from thorium point to brd corpse camping the few alliance that tried to get in there..
---
Anyway, I don't know who you're trying to convince, 100% of people on incendius know you're full of shit and everyone who doesn't play on incendius couldn't care less about our server, so I don't see what you plan to accomplish with this nonsense
---
Black lotus are for naxx and some parts of AQ. They will never drop below 90g again.
---
PVP consumes will rise with BG release. In open world zergs consumables besides sappers (which are 3-4g each) are near worthless. Either you have a bigger group or you don't.
---
Even easier, roll on PvE and never corpse run again!
---
The tragedy here is that I'm not new, and I knew better than to pop that chest open without linking the items and rolling.  It was at the end of the night, and I'd had a few stout brews....
---
On the servers where there would not be an imbalance you wouldn't notice anything of this solution, so I don't really understand your view here.
---
Only people that would complain about this solution would be the side that would have to deal with the qeues. 
---
The same side/faction that is creating corpserun queus for the imbalanced faction. And probably not getting the most interactive wars on their pvp seever aswell.
---
You can , turn off questie and dont look up answers. See how long it takes then
---
Nice job. Using logic, you forced this poster into admitting that the thing he said is accurate to himself as well! Checkmate!!
---
Holy sht what server is this?
---
Get in the habit of picking pockets and opening those boxes, also can just look up a guide of spots and power it at 60 if you prefer though or fall behind and it doesn't take too long
---
Not sure why you’re complaining about Everlook, those guards have more blood on their hands than a trauma doctor in Afghanistan. There are some sports where maybe only one guard will attack, but no one form my experience, is excused from the swift thwack of a bruiser club.
---
On arugal our one's name is frank. We love frank. his body has basically become part of the furniture in ironforge
---
Maybe you see alliance in those two spots because literally every other square inch of the entire map is patrolled by roving bands of horde that 40v1 alliance?
---
Is it? should be viewable for everyone.
---
Well dps wise tombstone breastplate beats it with 4 attack power.
---
Does a spirit tap proc actually gain you more mana than if you just didn't cast mind blast? I've wondered about this a lot. Maybe it's dependent on the 5 second rule. But mind blast takes a lot of mana and the spirit from spirit tap only increases Regen after 5 seconds without casting
---
This is true, but it assumes a lot of information, such as the chance to get dust and the average amount of dust given.
---
Same bro. Same.
---
I like the pvp I am quite a hardcore player. I'd just like it to be more back and forth and interactive. And blizzard to reroll the damage they have done with offering free non facrion based realm changes on full servers.
---
Frank is love. Frank is life.
---
I HAVE FINISHED FARMING
---
Grobbulus doesn’t get to complain, they chased off the most dominant PvP guild on the server(which happened to be Alliance) over a ghost costume. Bed made, lie in it.
---
Woah buddy this is reddit, I'm gonna need to you take that reasonable opinion and.... repost it elsewhere.
---
Magic be dashed!
---
He used “irregardless” so I’m taking it with a grain of salt. I think OP is right, but you can’t trust people who say “irregardless”
---
As a fresh 60 holy paladin with points in prot upto sanctuary what are my best gold farming options. 
---
I can AOE farm lashers which seems okay but unless i login at 7am it takes me about 40 minutes to get to the entrance because of all the horde camping the way there. This really puts me off it if i only have a couple hours to play because half my time is used up just getting to the entrance.
---
Is there anything i can do for gold when i only have a couple hour session available to me or should i just commit to loging out inside dire maul.
---
Idk that’s just been my experience so far but we could be playing at different times of the day so that could change things a lot also
---
I am a holy priest and I paid for my epic mount mainly with fishing.
---
Yeah well im not really a wrath fan so
---
Yeah excuse me as I just swim to the other continent.
---
Alliance _has no way_ to get to Kalimdor safely without a Hearthstone or a teleport/portal.
---
Alliance tears are sooooo tasty
---
To bad we dont have the actual moonwalk from vanilla/bc/wotlk(?)... I somehow miss it!
---
&gt; Mirah's Song
---
Back in retail...maybe LK times we had a rogue who literally just spent his days killing our AH npc in SW. Basically got so bad you would just live in IF cause they would usually be dead.
---
Hated that rogue.
---
False. How is this upvoted?
---
BRD, LBRS, DM:E
---
You can play whatever you want, but orcs are objectively better than tauren.
---
sorry, what I meant to say was FUCK THE HORDE REEEEEEEEE
---
But we are tho? Yeah theres some ally on the road between mojache and diremaul but its really easy to pass by up north with like 1 or 2 deaths. Ally has it way way worse.
---
That’s insane. So you’re farming gold and buying the crystals on AH?
---
What happens if you don't give it back after you're done? Seems really risky as the item holder and probably better just to resell
---
I love the rain. I turn it up.
---
“O K BO O M ER”
---
 - Alliance
---
Bro on my horde dominated server it is still the horde whining lmao.
---
there's one on every server...
---
the other day I saw one on Patchwerk who teamed up with an ally tank. ally tank stood ad the edge of the gulch (that the right word?) and cried for help, anyone who helped got killed by the rogue who then vanished or jumped down. I was watching for about an hour after he first fooled me too. Ally tank barely moved and never had anyone in target, only spammed a couple of different emotes.
---
I mean, Horde does have the better PvP racials
---
People who are going to tryhard in Premades from day one most certainly already have enough stuff stockpiled, and casuals won't bother about consumables
---
Its funny watching all these memes being attributed to one faction instead of the playerbase as a whole while the posters completely fail to realize that this crying about base locations, guard locations, this advantage and that advantage is EXACTLY why Retail is what it is now.
---
On behalf of all other healers using appropriate heals with people like you in groups who dont understand healing synergy/meters/logs... a big middle finger goes your way.   Unless you're just solely tank healing with it, then you only got a bad habit, and are not necessarily an asshole :-P
---
Not that I don't agree that most of the epics are better anyways.  Dumb BiS lists focus too much on raw potential healing, ignoring all the less obvious factors.  Like how a dispel of a damage debuff for a 250 mp insta cast should obviously be better than healing it for 500mp + the cast time,  but BiS sim says otherwise cuz... meters!   (well, not really... the meters do have the truth, but it's ignored by "logscore" and most people).
---
lol yeah, they have no other way. other than the ways you just mentioned, which are totally legitimate. 
---
also there are multiple boats, and only one of them is typically horde camped. 
---
look i’m not trying to argue that it doesn’t suck, or is not a huge inconvenience. i’m just disagreeing with the idea that it’s *griefing*.
---
You're barely making money that way and looks like a lot of time wasted compared to other methods.
---
Go tank Strat live for first orb. That's like 30g/hour without counting the vendored gear.
---
&gt; you play like others 
---
Other don't beeline to the herb. There is only 1 black lotus in the entire map. Normal players have to run around the map. Meanwhile here he only have to run straight to one specific place. In additional with 10 account he can very well has extra alt that can summon him directly there.
---
Disc Priest is definitely better than that. Laughable to put it on par with Resto and Balance Druid who should be lower anyway.
---
It was removed for no flair. Should be back up now
---
Lol if your alliance I would say horde figured out how to ruin that too
---
you have 0 idea what youre talking about.
---
For the Horde!
---
You’re nice guy! Never change. But you already made it right, accidents happens.
---
Ya I’m not exactly looking for better ways to do it as I’m not going to do it again lol
---
Yea...and don’t try leveling in Un’Goro, WPL, EPL, Searing Gorge...etc.
---
Might as well. Go out with a bang!
---
4 eyes, no bindings, 2 mage blades
---
if you have balance/resto lower than an A then your server has no good balance/restos
---
Only alliance get salty about this and refuse to acknowledge that both sides do the same shit
---
Lol the alliance that are on HS are traitors to stalagg. Left us with 80/20 split
---
Alliance in a nutshell: 😵😭😡
---
I don't care
---
Uh huh, you're making things up about a server's faction balance and I have the issues. Sure thing champ, good luck with that
---
Alliance go on the walls of gadz kite the guards and kill anything that breathes
---
Why play on that server? Come to earthfury
---
As I play my 42 mage, it makes me want to take a cheese grater to my face thinking about how much of a pain in the ass leveling my main (paladin) was in comparison to my mags.
---
&gt; Disc belongs with holy. It’s not THAT much better. You can get focused and blown up.
---
I’m pretty tanks and have great heals and offensive support plus surprising burst damage. Disc is great in the hands of a good player but not great for a more mediocre player.
---
Paladins, it’s why alliance premades will dominate all BGs.
---
doesnt effect 95% of players*
---
That destroys group/guild play which is the whole point of an MMO. Things as fundamental as raiding become impossible.
---
You are fake news. Troll rogues don't exist, Horde rogues are 70/30 Forsaken/orcs
---
Blizzard have done no damage, the constant player complaints and threats to quit are causing the real damage. 
---
All of these things were known well in advance of Classic ever being released, as soon as I saw the phased content and how P2/P3 were the inclusions of honor/BG's, I knew it would be a shitstorm of epic proportions in that interim period, and that's the thing I looked forward to most. Not MC/BWL/AQ/ZG/Naxx, just the pure slaughter between factions in areas that are quiet. And so far it's been everything I've wanted. 
---
This sort of wPvP is exactly what I missed most in the period between honor/BGs, people will scream that it's low skill or a gank fest or that 'it's not how they remember it', they'll scream that I must be on the horde side camping BRM, anything to justify the fact that they can't get to their safe and cozy instance. 
---
The problem is now that people are coming to Classic with a misguided sense of what to expect, and are asking Blizzard to change the game after they begged for the original experience. I don't want Blizzard to change the PvP by enforcing faction locks, fighting against overwhelming odds can be a nightmare but overcoming them is what truly makes it a great experience.
---
not A there are many
---
Brew
---
Stabyo
---
diddyo or whatever
---
there are 2 or 3 others who are always there as well
---
i think brew took a top 10 placement doing that last week
---
Trying to connect the dots between ok boomer and a post about getting ganked.  
---
People have been drinking again.
---
You guys act like there aren't dozens of rogues that do this in IF all day every day.
---
servers are big a few hundred commenters from each server can easily shift narrative
---
On my server the top alliance honor gainers every week are rogues doing the same thing in Kargath. 
---
Literally 12+ hours a day killing someone afk in the Inn every ~2mins
---
Oh my! ^_~
---
you dont see them til its too late
---
Looks just like the picture! Hope it was delicious, happy thanksgiving.
---
that makes a lot of sense, i was under the impression that the talisman itself was a reward and not apart of getting thunderfury
---
While leveling it can also save you a ton of time and rage when you have to kill enemies that heal themselves.
---
Jesus bro settle down
---
You can just respec to shadow when you want to farm dm:e.
---
1v1s are and sometimes when its moderately equal group vs group
---
Yeah our guild kills ony 2 to 3 times per reset and we haven't seen either weapon once.
---
this is based on what ? solo play because it very innacurate if you where to be in a premade or any high lvl vanilla pvp
---
Can we get some more Horde on Westfall (US)
---
We're at like 30/70 due to the realm transfer. Doing end-game content kinda sucks right now, we just don't have enough people
---
I can understand not getting honor if you're dead.
---
But if I have dots on a rogue and he vanishes before the killing tick, I SHOULD GET THE HONOR. What the hell is that?
---
Can you explain to me the benefits of clique over healbot? One thing that healbot has that I like is if you try healing a player when they're out of range, nothing happens. But if you do the same with clique, your healing spell is now "selected" and you have to hit escape before continuing. Not that big of a deal, but in the middle of an intense fight it can get in the way
---
Well let's be honest here. Asshole are evenly spread among all alliance race, mostly human and gnome I guess but there's no toxic race. On the horde, otherwise, 95% of orc, troll and taurens are nice players and 99.999992786502% of forsaken are gigantics, unbreable, coward, toxic, dishonoring, untitled asshole
---
Troll rogue ? NOT SCIENTIFICALLY POSSIBLE !
---
Why is that everyone defending the current state of the game is a horde player that has a 3:1 ratio of horde to alliance players.
---
I died 5 times just trying to catch the Nat Pagle fish the other night lol
---
This is on a 50:50 server though
---
Antimage is trash tbh. Ez kill.
---
Well my experience with it is from the wrath days, so perhaps I should keep my comments to myself. Maybe others know better.
---
I wish you the best of luck regardless.
---
Getting 5 man gear was defenitly more fun for me than raiding; ive cleared scholo like 40 times now till wand dropped at peast once; i still like the dung and going there for rep
---
Is it the little itty bitty one??
---
How many?
---
Dont. This is the absolute worst thing you can do.
---
Thx, will try that one. I kept getting killed in STV
---
Not at all. Plenty of people are desperate for tanks for strat live and would be happy to let the tank take the first two.  They are mostly there for loot. And it’s not a tanks job to run strat live for other people for nothing. They don’t owe anyone else anything for free. Every group needs a tank and tanks are in short supply. As a mage I’d happily let the tank take the first two, they deserve gold for their time. They can’t go dungeon farm and make 50g+ per hour like other classes can.
---
She could be an Aussie night elf that grew up in the barrens.
---
They better fix this before BGs, meanwhile I'm not going to bother farming.
---
Not always, I was hacking in wotlk and they could only restore gear to some of my characters and even then some was missing.
---
Well if it removes sheep I would call for a nerf, but since it doesnt its all good. You probably wanted to write sleep :)
---
He's not wrong.
---
Spot on
---
Thx, sounds better than what I was trying. Forgot about menethil.
---
Whats his name?
---
Thanks
---
Link logs
---
just to be clear many times have i rode the blimps from org to strangle and theirs like 10 rogues and feral druids hiding stealth below deck waiting for people to enter contested areas
---
its not an alliance problem  its an assholes on both sides problem
---
Found the horde player that has a 3:1 player advantage.
---
Thank you, reminds me I wanted to make a Nelf as well.
---
Hmm i agree not to mention that loot pool is also filled with not so good items; the whole rng is the reason why i dont appraise those binding posts and rng shit
---
So you’re telling me a guy like this will suddenly flip and begin playing the game for fun once he hits rank 14? Yeah, no.
---
Horde are the only ones who have ever fought unfair fights.
---
Literally every single time in the history of the game that a 60 camped lowbies or team up on one person or sit inside towns killing people as they land, it was *always* the horde griefing unsuspecting alliance players. Alliance players *never* do anything like that.
---
Source: Played alliance in every single expac and have never made a horde character.
---
Well, there’s a whole lot of other crap they have screwed up on top of fixing these problems too. Sharding and cross realm play completely removes the feeling of being on a particular server and the real beauty of the mmo experience, like recognizing people on your server. Acquiring gear and the rate you acquire epics, the random gambling aspect, there are a lot of issues with retail that aren’t fixing anything and have been long running iterative improvements to nowhere.
---
Applies to alliance in their own way as well.
---
No the didn't lol
---
&gt;and not use fiery enchant on ragnaros
---
It was proably the only decent DPS enchant that they could get at that point.
---
At least it’s not “Brostradamus” or “Bassnectar” that’s camping you.
---
Vanilla mist serves were alliance tilted weren't they?
---
nobody is doing quests now anyways
---
WoW was originally never supposed to have expansion packs and everything was supposed to be patch based.
---
But then they realized they could just charge full price for an expansion pack and make the entire rest of the game obsolete, and people would pay for it.
---
Correct.
---
Ah yes, all the alliance races. Night elf, human, dwarf, and lady.
---
People do the dumbest, more boring and lamest shit if you attach even the smallest reward for it.
---
Just not sure what to do tbh. People are making it to seem I’m for sure going to get caught
---
Anyone have a macro to switch between finding minerals and herbs?
---
Well it depends on ONE thing... is he actually tank specced! If he is fury or ms he can still farm pretty well , sure not like mages can, but thats the system. But grab a healer and go farm and you are also good to go.
---
it only shows 50 people max
---
Don’t do that, horrible idea.
---
Most of the game yes. I play on 120ms and I can't notice it at all. Very rarely do you have to respond quickly outside pvp.
---
So long as you're ok with a small disadvantage in pvp maybe it isn't an issue.
---
&gt;or they're more zealous than the Scarlet Crusade
---
This is how it feels to me. The tone of this Reddit feels overall much more reasonable than it was pre-launch, but it's still hard to go through a thread that's actually discussing game mechanics without finding complaints about the differences between this and vanilla. From servers being too big, to layering, to the balance patch we're on, to bugs that exist in this version and not vanilla, etc.
---
Google their rotation? Hunters autoing and mages frostbolting should have killed it faster.
---
in classic wow, yeah. itsd onna be more noticeable in pvp but still playable
---
Yes. Us oceanic players had around that or higher for a lot of vanilla. In some cases (and pvp) you may need to spam your keys before casts finshing though but it's fine
---
How about "We want to kill Rag before someone else snatches world 1st from us - &gt; we only have Fiery weapon which we used while leveling - &gt; Let's go already, we'll waste more time farming Crusader recipe, mats and swapping enchants"
---
Hahahaha no, I'm not him, but I do know him. He's a nice dude. Not a lil bitch like someone I know....
---
Yeah, why didn’t those alliance stay on their unbalanced server and take continued assfuckings?!
---
Our guild has at least a quarter old school vanilla guildies!! There have to be more guilds like us
---
&gt; Correct, its your definition of a play (minimal pvp AKA pve) versus the play session those other players are going for (wracking up HKs on a pvp server). 
---
But playing Horde on Horde dominated PvP server is literally playing on a glorified PvE server for the dominant faction. If you were actually as interested in PvP as you claim to be and if you actually liked the PvP experience you'd roll Alliance on a Horde dominated PvP server and experience constant, gruelling PvP. Instead you just want easy mode PvE with opt-in PvP.
---
That is Vael
---
im seeing not to now.  I've canceled the credit card i used as my first step, but now im afraid of getting banned, and dont know what to do.  people are making it seem like i will

Well it's their loss.  You are missing out if you don't get up, come on and get down with the thiccness
---
I truly feel bad for you guys. Heavily uneven servers fucking suck.
---
Join me on Old Blanchy!
---
&gt; While the faction imbalance is definately a factor. The biggest issue by far is the overall number of players on any given server
---
I don't know that this argument really makes sense. Servers that are balanced in their ratios tend to work simply because they are balanced, and I don't see why scaling that up wouldn't still work. A server that's extremely imbalanced, but lower population, would still have similar issues, just on a lower scale.
---
Had a rogue on kurinaxx called "organ freeman", who enjoyed waiting for us to get low health and then gank. Must be pretty boring sitting while invisible waiting to gank low lvl players...

Everything in MC is tauntable. Same on pservers, so probably Rag was tauntable back in 1.12 too.
---
What’s wrong with night elf rogues?
---
You might get lucky, there was someone here not long ago talking about being banned in classic for mailing gold from one account he owns to another account he owns as it flagged like a gold selling transaction. They seem to be pretty good on banning gold selling these days but who knows, i wouldn't write blizz though I'd just wait and see and if you get banned chalk it up as a learning experience to check TOS before doing things like this in the future.
---
\*sad midget noises\*
---
definitely learned a lesson here.  I wonder how long it would take to ban or if ill be wondering for weeks if its coming lol
---
Back in tbc i exploited a bug where i glitched into karazhan and soloed chess event for epics. This included wall jumping, running under the map and abusing the hell out of the game. This trick definately counts as exploiting and if cought, id be perm banned. But I didn’t get cought, I just stuck to my business and didn’t mention it ingame. The moral of the story is that you can get away with stuff. Blizz has probably increased their competence in detecting bannable offenses since then, but I think you’re fine.
---
Lol this entire post is embarrassing.
---
“I’m farming honor for a reward and only a reward. If I don’t get that reward I’m wasting my time”
---
Maybe you should, oh I don’t fucking know, maybe enjoy PvP and do it cuz you enjoy it?

These fucking people PvPing and don’t even enjoy it. Attach a reward to it and people find the lamest ways to abuse and farm it. Smh

 Thanks for the offer though. Ive been trying to get people over here. I don't get lots of okay time. It took me almost 3 months to hit 60 which isn't the slowest either but yeah it's a longass time imo. If they had paid transfers but even then we don't know eachother and might not have the same schedule lol.
---
It’s good, however the csc is better.
---
Your paladin or shaman would get a specific set of default gear chosen by blizzard based on your spec. I'm not saying it would happen but that's the only plausible way for it to work.
---
you masturbate 6 times a day and you only have expired mustard in your fridge.
---
No use in worrying about it now, it’s done.
---
15% concentrated power of zug
---
Nice grind with lot of gold if youd be alone in winterspring... also most reps are simply gold sinks; farm gold and u do lot of reps to exalted; this one however even grants u rep!
---
yet never lost a 1v1? lets 1v1 come now
---
You 100% can do princess runs as holy.
---
"Is that girl a boy, too?"
---
And here I am. 34 runs, still no cloak. Only seen it 3 times and lost it every time naturally. :)
---
Good luck with the bow!
---
RemindMe! 12 hours
---
That's what I'm saying. Just steal a key from work. Simple.
---
It is dependent on whether the account that mailed you gets associated with gold selling and banned. Then they will likely ban all the accounts it mailed. Without a guild bank it's much easier to link a botting account to a gold selling account to an account that buys gold. I wouldn't worry about it, just buy a level 60 if you get banned.
---
&gt; Blizzard have done no damage, the constant player complaints and threats to quit are causing the real damage.
---
How exactly does this logic work? Party A fucks up/does something wrong, party B complains about party A fucking up; it's party B's fault for complaining...?
---
It is not harassment for some random people in Asmon's guild to camp someone. It would only be harassment if Asmon specifically told them to do it as well as follow that person around to different zones and camp him. IE: What Advertise does.
---
Sister guild; this cross faction planning should be straight up bannable
---
Then you got Horde camping where you teleport in at Moonglade, too....
---
That's what I've heard but I didn't really pay attention to other servers back then so I dunno for sure.  My server was pretty even though so it was a good experience.
---
I didn't HoJ drop until my 101st kill.
---
Got it today at 167 kills. Biggest fucking relief having that shit done.
---
I wish you more fortune than me. Most seem to get it around 50-60 kills.
---
yep,thats the guy
---
What's the worst levelling stretch on the way to 60?
---
ha, im done with buying shit.  Learned a valuable lesson and regretting it
---
Same. First ingots last week (1 per raid group) after a combined 16 runs.
---
No bindings, no eye, no BRE, no OEBs (across groups).
---
bro maybe his enjoyment comes from the satisfaction of seeing his rank go up or getting cool rewards or whatever. there’s nothing wrong with that dude don’t shit on him just cuz he doesn’t enjoy the game for the same reasons as you
---
I've literally spent close to an hour to get to dm north entrance so I've experienced worst
---
May i ask what faction are you all in?
---
No server that matters has alliance doing this lol
---
What a fun way to recruit! Best of luck :)
---
If you manage to kill someone, that's decent honor.
---
If you're in a 20-man raid for PvP, as most Horde players are, you need to kill 20 Allies to get as much honor. And you probably can barely find 20 Allies on your server.
---
70-30 must be on Argul
---
You got downvoted but the times where the extra threat reduction is worth it are few and far between.
---
As a tank I have never once had any trouble finding a group in this situation. It's simple supply and demand.
---
so you just want TBC ...
---
Ok. Fair enough. But for droods it's cheaper.
---
He went AFK? Why not not simpley get a rezz from the spirit healer? Is your buddy stupid or something?
---
And even if you have no interest in being "recruited" still feel free to come and have fun with us!
---
If it is not time based, it doesn't happen at all. We kill Garr first and have never had a single explosion on an add we weren't killing.
---
It is likely that it occurs after a period of time AND only when Garr is below 50% HP.
---
There is no playing field when everyone is flying, there is no field, everyone is just up in the air and it destroys the feeling of being in world with other people.
---
Me. With a troll rogue who is my first and only max level character. I just can't seem to click with anything else when I try making alts
---
It's only really noticable if you have strong melee DPS that can pull threat off the tank.  We had a DPS warrior die at around 30%,, get brezzed, and pulled threat again almost instantly during the execute phase, even using the taunt swap rotation and fully resisted knockbacks.
---
It really does
---
good riddance Horrigan sympathizer
---
I'm an U N D E A D R O G U E but the only thing I yell after a kill is "ZUG ZUG".
---
I have no idea if the specifics are correct, but Rag threat has been weird as fuck and not consistent with the mechanics that I'm familiar with.
---
I hear you.  I [made a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d2ung9/demo_shout_threat/) early in classic about Demo shout, and so many people argued with me that I was wrong.
---
Alliance warlock salty at the race that has a built in fearbreak, seems about right.
---
Its great for pvp (as arms) and subpar for human pve.
---
Can you provide any evidence by means of videos/images and logs to support this claim or should we all just take your word for it?
---
1400 BLs for 3000 gold seems incredibly cheap lol
---
a few LBRS runs and you’ll be there. Pickup the Onyxia attunement chain as well.
---
Gor’shak farm
---
Depends on what level you are at and what class.
---
Some questlines for warriors/rogues may give weapons they want to pick up to speed things up or you'll want to do the mara quest to get thrash blade
---
Then there's some like the linkens later on  for casters that gives an offhand you can use up until mc drops something
---
I mean then yeah you had a non tank tanking a dungeon and it flopped, that’s pretty irrelevant to what I’m talking about.
---
Are they?
---
Classic.live was one resource I used for walkthrough on leveling. It is nice to have for efficiency. 
---
People always need tanks and healers but you wanna play what you enjoy. You’ll have a much better time playing the game solo or group if you enjoy the gameplay. 
---
Sulfuras is pretty balanced EST server. I have enjoyed the community. Nice experience so far as someone who is new to WoW
---
What’s the update do?
---
Level 30 Warlock Quest that gives a buffed version of Robes of Arcana
---
&gt; Who's asking for changing honor system?
---
It's the honor system causing the problems. Phase 1 you had a bit of grumbling but everything was fine. 
---
It's the *incentive* that causes people to camp flight points, not the pvp. 
---
A great example that I've talked about a few times is when Blizzard offered Alliance players on retail a Heroic piece of gear to go get 25 kills in war mode. Alliance, despite being the less popular faction and despite being the less accomplished faction in basically every aspect of the game, absolutely DOMINATED war mode that week because every Alliance player was running around in groups actively looking to PvP. 
---
When you have people actively looking to PvP, if you don't want to PvP, you're going to have a bad time. Period. 
---
Here's the issue with world pvp. 
---
Honor system comes out on a 50/50 server:
---
Well, one faction is going to wind up holding BRM. The other faction is still going to get completely locked out and farmed. It's what happens in large-scale battles. 'Don't worry, the Horde holds BRM now and you can't raid tonight, but the Alliance sometimes holds it on the weekend' isn't good enough. Now a shit ton of Alliance players are less inclined to log on because of that bad experience. Tomorrow night it's 55/45 and Alliance get clobbered again. Then people start quitting the game because they can't play the way they want to. They tried to do a dungeon two nights in a row and they couldn't, time for a break. Then people start to cry about faction imbalance. That isn't the issue. The issue is that the honor system creates winners and losers in the open world. It's like a game of AV. Sure, it's 40v40. But once you start to lose, people go afk or peace out. But on servers, there is no 'next game' and the leavers don't get replaced. Every single PvP server will devolve into pure faction dominance by one faction so long as there are incentives to PvP. 
---
&gt;Find me someone who said realms would be 70-30 balance or worse
---
Well we actually had this data off-hand. There are probably a handful of 70-30 realms, but we knew about them a week or two in. Crying about faction imbalance now is silly when you knew about the balance at level 20. 
---
And for all of the realms that *feel* like 70-30, they're probably a lot closer than you think. 55-45 *feels* like 80-20 very quickly. 
---
&gt;and every single 50+ dungeon run requires a 1 hour corpse run to get to even on non peak hours.
---
If I dug up someone saying that, would it honestly change your mind? 
---
&gt;Stupid. No one expects to get to BRM without dying on a PvP realm ever. But a 70-30 or worse realm means that one faction dies for an hour 99% of the time getting to BRM, and the other faction dies once or twice max, very infrequently. That's a huge difference
---
People expect to be able to get to BRM without dying more than once, or at least not consistently dying, yes. Two deaths every run to BRM would be unnacceptable if it was consistent. But that desire is at odds with the honor system, which ensures that players farming honor will be waiting to gank them 100% of the time. 
---
&gt;So I need to form a raid group anytime I want to PvP?
---
Yup. If I form a raid group and you don't, I will beat you. If you don't want to lose, you also have to form a raid. That's the reality of world pvp, and it's what you opted in to. 
---
&gt;Yeah, I see nothing stopping me doing that. Very easy to get a raid group to play with me every day and night.
---
That's great then! Glad I've helped you resolve your issue :D
---
&gt;It's the problem of 5x vanilla population combined with faction imbalance that we complain about.
---
It's the honor system providing massive incentives to gank players that's the problem. Faction balance isn't doing anything. Extra warm bodies sitting around don't go and fight in PvP. Look at retail warmode. Absolutely DOMINATED by Horde despite what most classic players would consider a very even faction balance. Retail war-mode is a total no-go zone for Alliance whenever there's any even relatively new content. That teeny tiny player imbalance translates into absolutely massive advantages in world PvP.
---
There's absolutely 0 chance of classic+.  I don't even indertand why people want it...  Blizzard isn't the same company that made tbc.  Do you really want the current dog shit iteration of blizz to develop classic+?   I have a better chance of living on mars, than they do to make a game, classic+, better than tbc.
---
I thought it was healing = healing ONLy
---
+spell dmg = both healing and spells
---
Well I feel it's literally the opposite on my server so ya.  Ally swarms choke pointing all the way to instances expect it and respect it.  Will be fixed by the 10th
---
Super hard to get into LBRS runs it seems.  I'll definitely try to get myself into a guild and make it happen tho!
---
I think combat drops after 6 seconds, and improved gouge only last 5.5 seconds. So your opponent has time to react before stealth.
---
Wow, you asked that. How incredible. Im so amazed. It might look like im on a high horse from where you are standing down in the mud, but actually im firmly planted on the ground. 
---
Btw, what is that sound? Its like a whistling sound. Just deeper and much more windy. Like a metal object traveling at high speed towards you.. oh yes of course! Its the ban hammer incoming :)
---
“Haha gnome bad pls upvote”
---
Not familiar with that, I'll look it up
---
It used to take up to 24 hours for a transfer and you had to stay logged out. They’ve streamlined it in retail, but this could be a classic server/lack of manpower situation.
---
You don't even need to pirate it.
---
Microsoft offers Windows 10 for free with all the desktop customization disabled because they make tons of money selling your info that they stole with all the spyware they built into the OS.
---
Hell, windows 10 even comes pre-packaged with bonzi buddy already installed and impossible to remove.
---
Don't bother, this guy is trolling
---
there were weeks if not months of attempts on ragnaros before they got him down though
---
Play anything but alliance on a pvp server.
---
lol i have never been in an argument on the internet, and today is definitely not the day that I am going to do so.  Have a good day
---
No doubt about it. He talks about the ‘chore’ of ‘farming’ honor. Acts like it’s another treadmill he has to slug through like farming mats or farming rep. Super sad and embarrassing
---
For other dungeon, it may not be right. But for strat live, there is not a single piece of item that a prot warrior can use. Therefore create a huge shortage of tank for this particular dungeon, it is not worth the tank repair bill unless they get something out of the dungeon.
---
Yup same thing, don’t know if it will end up being calculated or not
---
yeah so the hunter did way more than the pala who is getting all the credit lol
---
What a deeply ironic comment. How little self awareness do you posses? 
---
&gt; As a longtime player who played both factions
---
Recognize that your experience means shit in the face of much larger server populations and faction imbalance. Classic low pop servers are larger than any Vanilla high pop server. You didn't experience this in Vanilla. Every FP and Zone wasn't camped. Population size just wouldn't allow for it. 
---
&gt;I remember alliance being the stronger faction in my server when I played vanilla/TBC/wotlk and those guys were damn proud of being ganker griefers.
---
That is just server dependent and your subjective experience.
---
&gt;The allies on /r/classicwow should really consider playing Hello Kitty Adventure Island instead of WARcraft.
---
The Allies still logging in are playing Dark Souls.
---
Most Horde are playing Hello Kitty Adventure. 
---
Severe server populations and faction imbalance have compromised Vanilla and if you were one of the people talking all that good shit about nochanges you'd be a fucking hypocrite to endorse this state of affairs. 
---
Best believe a lot of Horde are in for a rude awakening vs Alliance premades though.
---
There’s no rush like being what appears to be a squishy clothy who gets attached by 4 people and stays alive for long enough for reinforcements to show up and fold every one of those cloth targeting bastards in half
---
You guys have to keep re sitting? I just spam W and it works
---
On Bigglesworth I got jumped by a group of 5+ rogues near the forge in IF. I wasn't even mad..it was so ridiculous it was funny.
---
They've said they are open to it.
---
The problem with TBC is it puts a time line on when the game is ending and it continues us on this treadmill of everyone knowing what comes next so everyones rushing and preparing for it.
---
There's also no reason that if they did classic+ they couldn't add in things like retuned kara for level 60 and other popular raids/dungeons from previous xpacs.
---
Personally I love TBC, but i also want to see classic+ just to see something new. The current stuff they put out can be ok at times, some of the legion raids were solid it's just all the design choices around how you run those that are fucked up. I don't see why they couldn't make interesting raids/dungeons still and if they already have the set principals of not changing the way the core systems work and just adding new content within those systems it could turn out ok. And hey if they release some classic+ stuff and it's terrible and people start leaving they can always just drop TBC servers then.
---
Seriously getting that angry over being called out on your sociopathic behavior?  Sounds like you need to get a grip buddy.
---
Ah, thanks brotha
---
"letting it work itself out" is how heartseeker happened lol
---
alliance sick of being camped by the horde majority heard heartseeker had an alliance majority and transferred away, leaving their original server's alliance even worse off
---
there's a small vocal majority that enjoys or doesn't mind being a minority but most people want to be able to level, farm and get to instances without being ran over by 5 man groups constantly and will pick a server where their faction is dominate to ensure this
---
&gt;Boat camping isn’t new. FP camping isn’t new. 
---
Angwe was a legend for camping Menethil boat. THE most infamous player on his server. Today? Everyone and their grandma are doing it.
---
this is amazing! WoW inspired vaporwave!!!
---
Go farm your pre bis in dungeons, it's very high exp/hr AND you get the best gear possible outside of raids. Two birds with one stone. Also don't forget to pick up all the dungeon quests for even more exp and gear.
---
idk if i was the first to find that one, but i'm definitely glad we have it
---
so you plan to only ever do bgs with a team of 10 of you non shitter friends? thats a good way to not rank up very quickly
---
Lmao I just sell portals.
---
Because DalRends just refuses to drop for some of us, that's why.
---
Regardless, everything else you said is on point.
---
You mean wafflebitch (changed name but those on Kromcrush will get it )
---
Is this actually the reason?
---
You are very looking from the view that everyone was on WoW forums, played on private servers and knew exactly that this was gonna happen.
---
You didn't even know yourself cmon man. 
---
You are just a player on a dominant faction thinking of your own gain. Saying stuff here so it won't change because you can't stand to fight against even odds. Not thinking about other normal players.
---
There is no overcoming with this populations. I really find these sort of comments the most weird narcistic delusional ones in this pvp discussions.
---
How fast do you have to tap w? I can get it for a few seconds but then it just breaks. I try to be as consistent as possible but still it just breaks.
---
U can see that it says wailing dude ...
---
Yeah, when I face a group while pvping usually the other 'team' won't focus me on the first tousle. Then when we face them again when they *immediately* focus me and try and smack my gooch as hard as they can, I feel flattered because they noticed I was a big part of the reason why they lost last time.
---
Still though, ow.
---
You have 0 downtime with Stam stacking anyway, you have more survivability and you're a juggernaut in PvP. Spirit is trash for Locks at every stage of the game.
---
Too late. We did argue and I won. Aww was i your first? Dont worry, you'll last longer next time:) and i did enjoy it. Good job!
---
Yo same for my priest
---
You're literally trading a shadow bolt for much more damage in the SAME fight. Like i don't see how people don't understand lmao. Not to mention if you have nightfall having the corruption up on the off target has a chance to give you an instant shadow bolt + the damage its doing for hardly any mana
---
haha yeah, it actually makes me cringe when I'm next to a waterfall lol
---
Go find some other goldbuyer to white knight.
---
He’s at the IF AhH/Bank every single day without fail it’s honestly impressive. All praise, Frank.
---
Die close to a ledge. When you res, jump into the water.
---
Option 2 is to take res sickness.
---
Option 3 is to release faster and get to the boat before it leaves.
---
Option 4 is to log out and "res" at graveyard without sickness.
---
Option 5, my favorite one, is to "latch" onto the bottom of the boat by swimming close to it so horde can't kill you.
---
Dps warriors don't care if it's plate mail or leather.
---
Druids are fucking awesome, no question.
---
Im just glad i was your first.
---
20-30 is fine for me between finishing Westfall/Darkshore, Loch Modan, Redridge, Ashenvale, Duskwood, Wetlands for ally at least.
---
IMO there is a really bad dead zone early 40s after you finish Feralas/Tanaris but are too low to start Un'goro or felwood.
---
The people in the know guessed alot of that, and not everyone was lurking on the classic reddit from day 1.  I wasn't.  Most of the initial reports of PvP servers seemed to paint a good picture.  Honor wasn't originally expected to be desynced from the release of BG's.
---
The information might have been there if someone was truly digging for it, but that's the thing; people won't look for that they have no cause to believe matters.  That is why it's a systemic problem instead of one of personal responsibility; the trends painted a picture where deep analysis was not needed, and actively encouraged the choice people wouldn't want later on.
---
And frankly, even excluding all that, the idea that you have to want PvP servers as they or PvE no exceptions is a false dichotomy.  I liked my PvP server until honor dropped, even with the occasional gank.  Wanting to change things to be more like that is the question at hand here, and whether they would be more happy on a PvE server than what PvP servers are now doesn't matter in that respect.
---
Still useful for clickable frames and KoS lists.
---
Are we watching the same video? Has honorless buff the entire time am I missing something?
---
And probably 4-5 priests on average of those 6-10.  Idk about a raid running 6 healers though.  8 is cutting things a bit close.
---
i was killing folks yesterday and not getting honor or HKs until I rejoined my party.
---
Blizzard limited the range of the combat log to 50 yards.
---
From my memory it was every boss in MC (no memories of Domo at least) and only the drakes were tauntable in BWL, but my memory could be wrong.
---
You're not going to see Classic+.
---
Not only is TBC a guaranteed hit, it also requires little to no investment. A tiny Classic+ patch would take more time, cost more and bring in much less revenue than simply doing TBC.
---
Gnome?
---
I bought 100g back in vanilla as a kid. It was inexpensive, never got banned and I had the time of my life with that amount of gold lol. Haven’t done it since though. Not worth the risk.
---
I should clarify 20-30 for horde
---
It is a fun story, but a long one. The simplest way to put it is that a vocal minority in the Grobb community who had harassed said guild from week 1 of Classic didn’t like a costume that the GM wore to a Halloween RP event because two random toons played by people outside of the guild rolled in and made it look like something other than what it was. Outrage ensued, accusations were slung around, a literal congressman got involved and that was the end of the guild. And no the Alliance on Grobbulus get stomped all over the server because The Enclave was the most successful PvP guild on the server prior to the nonsense.
---
You aren’t allowed to see enemy buffs without a mage casting Detect Magic.
---
Old Blanchy represent!
---
I don't hold up pservers as a source on it, but it's still interesting. I definitely don't remember any boss in MC being tauntable, but it's possible it changed (by 1.12 I was running AQ and Naxx and probably never ran the final version of MC) or that I just remember wrong.
---
Professions? Hebalism is the strongest for gold income since it drives a huge part of the raiding economy.  Look into duoing jump runs with a warrior.
---
6 healers is totally do-able if your raid is pushing decent dps. Kill times are super quick
---
well thats why the ranking system should be changed.
---
Ya good advice.  I just feel like im not going to relax while playing any more, since i may log in tomorrow, or a week or a month from now and be banned for a stupid mistake
---
That doesnt stop addons from actually showing enemy buffs.
---
Dat Mathril
---
Looks good but fuck that zone. Nothing like having to run around an entire zone to get up a cliff. Least favorite zone until I had to farm blood of heroes in EPL.
---
What are you even trying to say?
---
There’s no way they would force every item to also store disenchant results on the server. That’s an insane amount of completely useless data.
---
Hi, /u/mody_bird_s
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e392eo/for_rogues_how_much_better_is_agility_than/). 
---
&gt; Yeah, but it has to be crafted after the 3rd use lol
---
It's 6 uses before you have to recraft it. I just made a second one so I get 12 charges before I have to go back to town.
---
Willfully ignorant is using Ratchet's level 20 quests as examples of blatantly biased quests in the mid 40's.
---
Since "Blatantly favoring one faction" will be biased and anyone will claim any quest in a contested zone favors one side, it's a completely useless metric. 
---
World first 60 contenders on both Pservers and classic skewed Alliance for a reason. It has an easier levelling time to 60.
---
Swifty has shown me that Prot can actually be somewhat viable in pvp tbh
---
Gotta farm something.
---
The reason why it doesnt work is because some people (for example the people who make posts similar to OP) want to do things other than pvp the whole time they are in a zone. If there are more people than there will be more pvp at any given time. It isnt more intricate than that.
---
Fuck off troll
---
Nah they will find a group, I think we missunderstood here.
---
Again, you're confusing **you** doing big dick damage and shooting up the charts with working as a team to end the whole fight quicker. 
---
If you spread your damage, mobs sill stay up longer. Tank will take more damage, Heals sill have to heal more, Dps will have to dps longer, everyone will have to drink more, etc etc.  
---
&gt; Like i don't see how people don't understand lmao 
---
So you're saying a whole reddit thread full of min/maxers and tryhards with years of experience at this (of which I'm nowhere near as knowledgeable as) are disagreeing with you, and you think they're in the wrong?
---
ok mate. have fun.
---
They wont ban you if you legitimately own both accounts. If they do, contact support and sort it out.
---
I actually started leaving lv 50's and their 100 honor alone.  Then I look over my shoulder and see that the next 5 other Horde didn't have the same thought as me lol.
---
No problem
---
LHC isn’t bad anymore.. I’ve actually been running  stray exclusively cuz it’s easy to get into. .. kargath/Anthony in bum.. expect an hour before you even get int an instance
---
Why is releasing BGs early not good enough? That will allow them to see the impact that has on the current problems while keeping the nochanges crowd happy. 
---
Just because things have been rough for 2 weeks doesn't mean drastic changes are required
---
Unless you're on a PvE server, 50-60 because world PvP makes questing incredibly difficult.
---
You rolled PVP server or you're /pvp on. 
---
Suit. Your. Self.
---
You might get caught and not banned. But I’d guess they’d catch you pretty soon or not at all.
---
There.... there face.

Fly to kargath and don’t run along the edge of the cauldron. For alliance Morgan’s vigil avoids the worst part but still is a PvP hotspot get over it. I’m not a great gamer I’m a priest so I’ve realized that if I get jumped by a rogue I’m dead and have adapted to it. Dying 5 times is a flaw in the game, dying 14 times is a flaw in your approach to the game, being such a sarcastic ass is a flaw in your upbringing.
---
This looks insanely boring, I can't imagine walking around hoping to find someone to kill for hours on end...
---
Let's agree to disagree.  All sub 30 minute MC parses are running 9-10 healers currently.  Does that qualify for "decent dps"? :P
---
Not really infinitely, of course.
---
Yeah, ranking up is all that matters
---
They're just the only alliance rogue that doesn't get any useful racial.
---
Glad you like it man! I've made 3 of these so far!
---
in dungeons and raids, people will blow you of for forget how important you are most of the time. I have yet to not be thanked by at least one person when i heal in WPvP, and vanilla was no different.  I may never get my armor sets, but the people always make it worth it
---
What the fuck happened?
---
Yeah just rapid tap W people lol you can do it lying down, kneeling, dancing, hearthing.
---
Could it have been changed at some point? I seem to remember desperately trying to run away and get out of combat when my BG queue popped. On the other hand arena queues have been used to escape ganks..

It's dull AF but fishing/cooking is solid right now since Winter Squid is available. I can wake up early before work and fish for like an hour during Nightfin time and make probably 50g in that hour.

I think at this point, the thread is largely dead, since it was removed for violating rule 3 (since I named the person directly).  But I would like to thank those who saw it for their outpouring of support, and even those who didn't.  This thread got enough traction quickly enough that he was found, and has more or less been blacklisted on the server hes now stuck on.  Couldn't have happened to a better guy.  Buddy... you earned it.  
---
I can still see the original, so I'll repost it as a comment so folks can read a gently modified version of the original post that hopefully does not violate the rule.
---
\------------------
---
Let me start off by saying, I wanted this one to have a happy ending.
---
It started about 2 weeks ago in our guild's Molten Core run. Our guild leader, against all reason and logic, was in love with playing a Retribution Paladin, and since he wasn't shy about sidelining himself to Heal, or Cleanse anytime the raid needed it, we weren't going to bitch about it too much. But it was always known from day 1 of the guild that the Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros legendary hammer was his holy grail, and after 15 years of playing a Ret pally, he finally had a shot at getting one when it mattered. So when the Eye of Sulfuras dropped, it was a really exciting and proud moment for the guild.
---
Now, while he was the guild leader, we were still governed by a body of officers, and a Co-GM, with whom, it was understood that they were equals in authority and power, despite only 1 of them being able to hold the in-game title of guild master. We knew our strengths and weaknesses, and felt it best to have a system of checks and balances in the decision making process for the guild as a whole. Well, the guild leader took it upon himself to pull everything he needed from the guild bank. Totally fine, as its a guild craft item. But we didn't have the Sulfuron ingots on hand to cover it, as we had gotten a poor drop percentage on them. Only 3 across our 2 months of clearing MC. So he started asking other guilds if he could buy from their stock. As they were going for about 800G on the auction house, some guilds were willing to part with them for half of that as a gesture of good will. Since we didn't have much money in the guild bank to begin with, since those funds were used to help supplement tank repair bills, he started asking members for loans to cover the cost of ingots. All told, to my knowledge, about 900G was borrowed from various members.
---
The base hammer also takes 48 Arcanite bars to craft, which he did not have. Guildmates pitched in, and donated some, but that still left him needing 6 Sulfuron ingots, and 37 arcanite bars. Again, without talking to the officers he struck a deal with a guild leader he was friendly with. Now, since our leader essentially had the reputation of the guild as collateral, the other guild leader was willing to help. He sold us the 6 Sulfuron ingots for 900G, and offered to buy them back from us for 450G apiece, as they dropped. A highly generous gesture on his part. In continuation with this gesture of generosity, he loaned our guild leader 37 Arcanite bars from his Thunderfury stockpile he'd been saving. The only caveat being, he wanted them returned by the time phase 3 drops. Again, completely fair, and even generous. So, materials in hand, and not fully realizing what had all transpired for him to come up with the materials in less than a day, we set off into BRD to craft the Hammer.
---
I could elaborate on the crafting of it, but its boring. A 1 minute cast time, followed by a 10 second apply of the eye, and you have the legendary hammer. But now that the whirlwind excitement of getting it crafted was over, we started thinking more about how it was, exactly, that he had gathered the materials and what we were on the hook for, and how he hadn't involved the officer core in taking out a loan from another guild. A loan we were responsible for, with no say in the matter. As these shenanigans were unfolding, he was trying to bring a buddy back into the guild, who had left guild after being demoted from officer for throwing a hissy fit in raid one night. The officers had all decided that guy could rejoin, as long as he apologized to the guild. He wouldn't, so we didn't want him back. The guild leader wanted him back bad enough that he was trying to pull rank and override the officers. He was soundly shut down by officers and guild members alike. I mention it only because it bugged our guild leader that we were 'going against him'. As more people began to question what had just happened, our guild leader started feeling the pressure. People were losing faith, trust was broken, and he didn't like being doubted or questioned. In a move that may have been interpreted as a show of humble remorse, but was most definitely a pity party, he stepped down as guild leader.
---
Now the question on all of the officer's minds was "Is he going to stay in guild? Is he going to repay the debt? Is he going to continue raiding with us?". After giving him a day of radio silence to decompress and process, I reached out to him, and he reassured me that he wasn't going anywhere, he would repay the debt, and he would continue raiding with the guild.
---
10 days later and 1 Arcanite bar repaid on the loan, two of his characters in guild, which were offline at the time, left guild. I messaged him on discord. Nothing. I message him 5 minutes later. Bot auto-reply says I'm blocked. One of his alts remains in the guild. I report my findings in the officer chat to let them know whats happening. It looks like the former guild leader has just taken a free transfer off of our high population server with 2 of his characters. Some time passes, and one of our officers reports that he received a private message from them saying that he 'was quitting the game, too much drama, he deleted his characters'. Now, don't get me wrong, I've seen people nope out of a game before. If they go all in and delete a max level character, let alone 2 of them, they delete EVERY friggin' character they have on the server. Unfortunately for him, we're not as stupid as he thinks we are. What we already knew is later confirmed, through others he'd been in touch with, that he transferred off to another server.
---
If you're still reading, and disappointed in how boring the story is, pretend Thanos just snapped his fingers.
---
But instead of half the guild vanishing to dust, and the other half sulking, nothing happened. Nothing bad anyways. The officers spoke with the other guild leader regarding the loan. Explained how the former leader transferred away, and that we were going to make sure he got his materials back because one person's shitty decisions weren't going to drag down the rest of the guild.
---
Right now, I need an army. I don't want to talk to him. I have nothing to say to him. I have a bunch of other people to care about who are choosing stay, fight, and deal with this problem. That's why I need you, Reddit.
---
TL;DR/Summary
---
My name is \[CENSORED\]. I'm Co-GM of \[ALSO CENSORED\] on the \[THIS TOO\] WoW Classic server. Our former guild leader, a human female Paladin by the name of \[AND THIS\] took guild bank materials, borrowed gold and materials from members, and borrowed a bunch of late game materials from another guild to craft his Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros. He then transferred servers with his rogue alt and left us, his former friends and guildmates, with a mountain of debt and nothing to show for it. I don't know if the character has been renamed, but if you have a GEARED paladin with a Sulfuras looking to join your guild, \[SEND THEM A MUFFIN BASKET\]. Thanks for your time.
---
Yeah but the wow community is heavily fragmented as is. Even the classic+ supporters don't agree on what classic+ should include. Osrs style classic + would eat itself alive the moment transmog, flying, or lfd came up

When you're in a main city hub there is actually a Guild Recruitment chat. You can join it the same way as any other global channel, by clicking into your chat settings and just opting into it there. 
---
That said though, it doesn't see much use. You'll see the most recruitment messages in General and LFG chats.
---
Oh, sweet summer child.
---
Sadly this will not happen. People *LOVE* getting healed but most will end up letting you die, or at the very least charging into a new group and leaving you to be combo'ed by a rogue.
---
Id be fine with B.C. and wrath on separate servers.
---
Now kiss
---
I have 4 alchemy transmute alts at lvl 35. The first one i thought was gonna be a lvl 60 alt but Kindof lost interest and started rolling more.
---
westfall roll a warrior i got a pocket priest for you only lvl 10 atm.
---
Sure feels like 75%....
---
I’m on incendius, I’ll have to keep an eye out for you.
---
&gt; I’ve seen some pvp builds go for Wyvern + Scatter
---
wut
---
Get to 48-50 by doing ZF runs, then switch to Mara and work on getting your ring. After that, BRD Arena/Anger/Golem farm (52 recommended).
---
Well, some guilds don't allow sword Rogues to roll on raid daggers. 
---
Personally, I think Rogues should raid with the weapons they want to stick with. I play daggers, without any MC daggers yet. A few days ago we pulled a Rogue off the bench to fill a spot in our MC clear. He was swords and was hoping Perds would drop. I was a little irritated, especially because he has both Dal Rends swords. 
---
Want to get Perds? Raid as daggers spec. That's my opinion.
---
You can trade items between two accounts you own with zero consequences. It’s not against the ToS.
---
Update your settings in auctioneer to use the enchantrix histogram values instead of the default prices. This way it uses the median prices from recent scans to provide a recommendation.
---
this was amazing
---
Right but they have different logins so they look like different accounts.
---
Ironically the best solution to the honorless target buff is killing them thus wasting the buff in ghost mode. Then you're free to corpse camp their honorable respawn.
---
Give us BwL then slow down. We will have 2 good raids and infinite pvp with rewards. BWL will also be a progression raid for many guilds
---
Might only do that if you die ON the ship or zep, not sure though.
---
Do you play Horde side? Resto Shaman will guarantee you guild membership and to get into raids. Priest usually as well.
---
I assume Priest and Paladin will also guarantee raid invites on alliance side.
---
Holy shit I love that tabard!!
---
How then is everyone clearing Ragnaros so easily?
---
Wow you’re a complete dick huh?
---
I dunno, 15 years later with 4 32 slot bags and I still never have bag space
---
Spotted the horde player
---
&gt;they aren't smart enough to avoid those situations like we can help out with that
---
It's not like I can walk 10 feet without bumping into one of you. You're literally everywhere and swarm the whole world.
---
Another great tip, thank you! Now I know why this other guy always swam faster than me! I thought it was some kind of racial advantage.
---
DPS in full MC gear can't out-threat a Warrior in blue gear and a shield. Fury/prot is a waste at this point.
---
i wish that still existed it was super fun doing and watching it happen
---
Yeah... You're a moron.
---
Go to Heartseeker
---
delet
---
Do Maraudon. It's shitty xp/hr excluding the quests but it's safe.
---
Items that got the bonus from a random roll (like "of the Monkey" and similar) say "+44 Healing Spells."  Items that always come with that bonus say "Increases healing done by spells and effects by up to 44."
---
Both effects are identical.
---
Not bored at all. I don't play every day for one. With anything you need to take breaks. I have an alt, working out different specs, farming for rare items, pvping with friends. Farming prep for raids. Etc....
---
And yet it's probably the case for about 90% of players.
---
Even better view !! Love the live reaction! We’re Epic Failure Guild. We should organise a bigger one of this line up
---
Yeah most people would. Doesn't mean you'll see one drop any time soon. If you can find a way to make Rag shit out BREs whenever you want, let us know.
---
LORD MAGINA DOTH RAMPAGE
---
You play alliance my dude
---
Not everyone has a paladin holding their hand giving 30% threat reduction lmao
---
As a mage I consistently get threat off my tank , not to mention the locks (no threat reduction in lock talents), fury warriors, rogues
---
Not to mention, it isn't a complete waste because higher dps with the same level of mitigation can only mean faster kills
---
I truly don't understand the point of view you just offered it has no base in logic
---
Tryin to say that going that route will net you about 10 bgs a week if you're lucky and all 9 other people are playing at your times. It's far better to be flexible and queue with the occasional random or even solo queue while waiting.
---
&gt; pay-to-win
---
Yes, he is PAYING money to WIN on resource gathering.
---
Ya kind of annoyed too. A bunch of people from my guild made an ally guild on a pvp server. I said...i dunno about doing that but they didn't want to play on a pve server so i reluctantly went. The guild got big in the first couple weeks then i stopped playing for about a month due to RL and retail mythic raiding.
---
Turns out everyone in the guild did the same thing. Ive been playing on and off for the past week have not seen a single person log in. I checked the roster and aside from myself and 3 others, the last time people logged were a month ago.
---
I'm only 33 at the moment so I'm getting ganked constantly. Hell even a 30 rogue had no problem stun locking me to death and of course escape artist doesn't help. And everyone waits till they either have backup or until you are low hp from fighting a mob. 
---
Some made earlier did it then he came back a couple mins later and chased me. I said fuck it and turned and dotted him up he got to 50% quick then just turned and blinked away.
---
My fuck it point was earlier some Hunter a couple levels lower chases me down. I was just trying to get back to turn in quests and log. His stupid pet is gaining on me so i fear it. He's been shooting me the whole time. I turn and dot him up and almost kill him and of course a priest shows up out of nowhere and heals him to full and I'm just fucked by then.
---
At this point i feel i invested too much time even getting to 33 that id rather just quit than re-level a new toon on a PvE server.
---
Right, I meant for 1v1
---
&gt;2.) It depends... what server, what faction, etc. decide tank, healer, ranged, or melee dps, then go from there. Play what you want, there will always be room in a 40-man raid.
---
This is such garabage advice on a pretty straight forward question. In a raid people currently need healers. Every single guild I see is recruiting healers. And basically not a single guild is looking for rogues. One rogue left our guild today because he can't actually come to our raid times and I'm stoked about this. Because this way we don't have to bench as many rogues. 
---
And literally not a single guild is looking for tanks. I've had several druids by now ask me to join the guild and subsequently the raid. I told them they can join the raid if they specc resto or moonkin, else they can't. Just like people believing they can get a raidspot as enhancement shaman. Maybe if we are below 40 people, then yeah sure why not. But every guild runs on their non farm runs with more then 40 people who want to be part of the raid.
---
100%. Its stupid xp. I started full rested at 56 and hit 60 in two play sessions.
---
thanks for the reply, but the problem is that no one seems to have the mallet bc they want to find other people with the mallet, lol. So I thought I would do the quest myself.
---
40-44 is super shit.
---
Looks delicious! I can confirm as of today that Fel Eggs and Ham is really good as well.
---
Gonna be the first Instagram model/photographer/influencer of Azeroth
---
The real classic experience is the video quality
---
Requires some bombs and taking advantage of wall leashing, but yeah
---
Haha what? Prime raid time is a drought for tanks. 
---
I charge people 20g to tank a dungeon and  consistently make 60-80 a day. 
---
Thats not even taking into account vendoring greens/blues and greys from the runs. 
---
Longest I’ve had to wait for an invite is 5-10min 😂
---
You're right I'd much rather sit in org twiddling my thumbs thinking to myself man I wish Joey would log on so we have our 10 man team, too bad his mom is visiting him guess I'll just wait for tomorrow. Solo queues or forming a team with randoms can be fun too yes you occasionally get "shutters" but at least you can constantly be getting into games.
---
A ton. Also our guild usually just runs excess healers as bad DPS just so we have more healers aviable if we need them.
---
lol
---
"The enemy of my enemy is my friend"
---
Also, the horde accepted them when the alliance rejected them.
---
Yeah I did Mara with my guild but was shocked how bad the xp was compared to everywhere else. What’s up with that?
---
There's already too many Alliance in Pagle, now we're gonna have a billion more Gnomes!
---
Kurinnaxx is pretty even from what I remember but that was a few week of honor and I had to head to a pve server
---
Yes dagger rogues and dagger furies should have prio over sword rogues.  People will get geared faster and its better for the guild overall when loot is spread out accordingly.  Sword rogues who roll on daggers should be staying on daggers until the real sword rogues get all the loot they need.
---
But they're not camping graveyards, anyone who gets res sickness is not worth any honor for 10 minutes. They want honor, not to just kill people over and over.
---
&gt;you need to replace them
---
Why? If you're at a point where your healers need to use heal and greater heal for mana conservation then you need to replace your DPS
---
It’s not exactly a quest...
---
Go to hinterlands and find and kill qiaga. A level 50 elite at the top of a pyramid towards the  south of the map towards the center. 
---
All in party will receive mallet drop. Then take mallet and go to the ruins towards the southeast and go all the way to the top. I would recommend a party of three or so if sub level 50 and at-least someone else to heal at 50.  We mounted up and just rushed to the top, there are so many so you’re bound to die but once you get to the top there will be some elites that you should kill then use the mallet at the altar and voila. 
---
If you are only going to run gahzilla once then I do not recommend obtaining the mallet... it may be difficult to find people willing to and you will take a couple deaths for sure. 
---
I found it cool to do since I am new to the game and all but it got less and less cool each time I died so.
---
If you're trying to do the last boss you'll probably want it for the imps.
---
not where I play, your fault for rolling on one of the five servers this happens regularly on.
---
Man im so glad i rolled a night elf, ive seen ... hordes of horde coming my way where i just shadowmeld and they dont turn my way !
---
Because the difficulty has barely changed.
---
How did you transfer ? Did they release paid server transfers to any realm ?
---
logs
---
"/who molten druid" on raid night  was cut short. Over 50 druids. Assuming 3 druids per raid on average that's 17 raids. 
---
  
---
There were no 17 MC guilds per side on \*any\* server in 2005. Not even close.
---
Well lets say you are a mage. You get 30 Spellpower on that thing and it is your BiS until almost level 60. 
---
But aside from this, yeah sorta. Similar stuff is for example to have white shoes enchanted with run speed.
---
Priest T1 is not just plus healing, it is damage and healing.
---
2 pts in parry are a waste.  As i the additional pt in beast slaying.    Improved hunters mark is total trash.  Idk why ppl put pts in that.   Ohh man 5 atk power!!!   I'ma fuck you up now...
---
Your second spec is just a pve spec, except instead of 5 pts in pet health you take 3.3 and get improved revive pet.
---
Also, why are you providing an image instead of wowhead links?  lol  Use this, 
---

---
Nothing to do with alliance vs horde; The moment I realized what my fellow hordes are doing to alliance is the moment I dropped my swords (actually staff, but doesn't sound that good) and left the game, if there is only honorless honor and no Mak'gora then I can just spit on that PvP.
---
Few days later alliance moved to another server. Now there is no Mak'gora and no honorless honor, the whole place is only a ghost town not worth any remembrance.
---
I don't think battlegrounds will help. You assume people are just bored when infact there are a lot of people who are simply dicks that want to grief other people.
---
I'm not going to tell you to activate windows like everyone else here but point out that you can play wow using linux.  Has worked well for me for years.
---
fak replied to wrong comment xd
---
What. As an Alliance player on Bigglesworth that's clearly not true. From my own eexperiences nd if any websites/censuses are to be believed it's quite horde favoured. Taking anywhere from 30-35 minutes to get to BRD. Impossible to do anything in any high level contested zone. It's a bad experience.
---
Those censuses have it at slightly under 60/40, which is anything but a "pretty even split"
---
I'm more interested in the choice of name for your owl lmao.
---
A little touchy? Did you pose the same query to the OP with respect to Horde?
---
Imo it's a bad idea to write blizzard about it.
---
They proved to be quite severe against people breaking the rules, so you would probably get a temporary ban.
---
It won't change anything about your mistake, because the issue is not the gold you received in game, it's  money you give to those selling gold, encouraging their business.
---
Jst a question : why did you wanted that gold?  Epic mount? Piece of gear? Satisfaction? Other?
---
Huh? Wow head has almost 10k baron kills, how is that a small sample size?
---
Level up my professions
---
If you want it easy, play mage. Mages are the easiest class to level in a decent pace. They are also the pretty much easiest class to play during raids. And they even have some of the lowest consumable requirements.
---
I just rerolled on a PVE server and left my somewhat geared 60 behind me. Pretty rough feeling to lose that progress but I seriously just couldn't deal with it anymore.
---
This one is obvious, but definitely THE most important... enemy cast bars
---
Yes you arent stop parading your ignorance
---
People rolled PvP servers so that they can gank lowbies. When they are the ones getting ganked, they quit the game. 
---
That, or they vastly underestimated how much a PvP server = camp server. I expected this and went PvE and have been enjoying the game. Idk man, no one forced anyone to join a PvP server. People act like this is Blizzard’s problem when PvP is entirely opt-in. It’s baffling to me how they manage to convince themselves it’s blizzard’s fault and not their own for picking a PvP server..
---
You could farm sfk for twink gear just gotta run from south shore which shouldn’t be patrolled too heavily by gank squads and I think there is a vendor nearby. If you have engi you could also use repair bots to empty bags
---
Horde are much better for 1v1s and shit like that
---
Nope, dot them up and keep bouncing back and forth
---
My pleasure ^_^
---
I kill once, emote /sorry the whole time, and walk away crying
---
Mine is pretty well known. It requires a decent amount of gear and skill so it is still 40g per hour. I've recently seen one APE guy make a video tutorial about it.
---
Thunderfury
---
its not just honorspy being inaccurate, while that has happened before. The honor tab is reporting that ive only got 100 honorable kills this week when i know for a fact that i got 300 from yesterday alone.
---
Yeah but with all of the extra money alliance have paved roads and dont live in mud huts
---
Um sorry but druids belong a solid step below ele or resto shamans.
---
Can I make a whole new battle.net account to play on another account at the same time as my current one?
---
Pagle 4 Lyfe
---
The guys entire life for the past month has been dedicated to killing, camping, and harassing asmongold. How is this a loose interpretation of harassment?
---
Which is poor design
---
Nah it only shows my kills from today. The kills are completely gone from yesterday.
---
nice. not as fun as it was back in the 40s, but still pretty nice.
---
Why not just transfer to heartseeker? They're dealing with the same problem.
---
Ya idk, I’ve had pretty good results so far, don’t even have very good gear. Pre-BiS rogue with some BOE epics. Have to have preparation up for double cold blood evis, double sprint can also help but normally with two blinds allowing me restealths it’s not a problem.
---
Blaumeux?
---
Happened to me a few days ago.  My “yesterday” tab was showing what I had done 2 days prior, and my “today” tab was showing correctly for that day.  So everything I had done the prior reset day was missing.  It finally did catch up the next reset and everything was properly accounted for.
---
Rattlegore is pretty populated and well balanced. Pull up
---
wait is this what ppl are talking about? those estimated honors are not the real amount youll get, they dont factor in diminished returns at all.
---
Tesla truck
---
It absolutely is a solution — They still get to play, just not all at the same time. You may not like it, but it would balance the server over time. Sure, it should have been in place months ago before issues started but there’s no time like the present...
---
Otherwise, please propose a better solution than faction queues combined with over pop transfers to more/all under pop servers.
---
If you can't dance, you can't do Heigan.
---
I got in BC for the hell of it. It only heals when you're under 30-40% health, and even then you'd be lucky if it ever casts two heals in a row. Still I'm sure I won a decent number of arena battles because of it. Gives around 1200-2000 in healing at most if you summon it at the right time and it survives.
---
Yeah its a double problem compared to vanilla. Firstly you have too many people. Secondly you have much less of a case of people trickling into the game over time and levelling at different rates, spending more time raiding and doing dungeons, etc etc. 
---
Instead you have a ton of people who have already hit 60, target farmed their pre-bis the guide told them to, spend 1 day a week farming MC and other than that they are bored so their focus goes entirely on grinding honour at all costs which means constantly ganking people. 
---
You didn't have masses of people playing with this mindset back in the day.
---
 When a reward system is set in place it's to be expected that you receive the  rewards. Is it so unrealistic that I gain motivation and enjoyment from Pvp because of the prospect of rewards? Competition and grinding for the sake of standing/ranking is something many people love doing even if it's "not fun" or "hard" sometimes. I also made no mention of it being a chore, i've had a blast playing. But is it insane to be demoralized that my honor isn't being tracked, while others who play at certain times unaffected by these bugs are. Also I play Alliance on a horde dominated server and only solo/duo pvp and achived standing 41 so I don't know why you immediately assume how I play the game.
---
You can, but if you are a dot class you just juggle them like the boss, but even easier because they have no range attack. Honestly the only hard part about the imps is that they pull the room.
---
Why are they bots. “ the pet names are Chinese!!!”
---
Nope, dot them up and keep bouncing back and forth. As a warlock I can say no mandatory pack requires aoe
---
A bug being fixed makes you doubt that more bugs will be fixed?
---
Bad is bad and good is good I strive to be in the latter
---
People have to come down for content: farming, questing, using meeting stones, etc... Naysayers act like people do *nothing but* fly around...
---
There is a  addon called slidebar something that gives you a pop out menu and you can use this instead of the minimap buttons. Gotta go into each addon and hope there is a way to turn off its button

Doesn't work for non-clickers seeing as X is such an X-cellent keybind.
---
Different sure but still against tos.
---
We found one guys
---
An actual idiot
---
You are 100% right to do that.
---
I’m council, and an orc warrior. The prio is Sword Rogues &gt; DW fury/furyprot warriors with Edgies already (not me) &gt; Hunters &gt; offspec. That’s how it should and will always be for us.
---
You horde, or?
---
I laughed way too hard at this
---
After hunters for the show off for sure.
---
I’m starting to get that now that I’m seeing these posts regularly. I really hope for some sort of blue post because I’ve been working on ranking but haven’t been paying close enough attention to notice if I am missing honor
---
Who said Alliance aren't as active? On my server, Firemaw EU, they're more organized and more active than Horde.
---
You're right, it's actually great if the enemy doesn't respond properly. Best time to use it is against a melee at close range. Then you move away from it and let the melee chase you before he notices what's happening.
---
Your context is for claim
---
They are in boe greens,
---
They are appropriate level in a leveling area killing mobs. 
---
They have Chinese pet names. 
---
They are all hunters.
---
Blizzard doesnt care

idk about you, but when i did a transfer, i just kept looking at the original server, so i waited a couple of days and then actually 'logged in' to the server i had transferred to and there was my char!
---
I did not receive any notifications saying it was complete AND it looked like it was still in progress. So, if you are looking at what I was, then try logging into the server (create a char screen) and see if it came through.
---
1) lasts 20 seconds, not 30 seconds. Most you can get is 8 lightning attacks out of him - for an average of ~2150 damage if he does nothing but shoots lightning.
---
2) Any summon is a big deal in PVP. distracting your enemy for 1-2 seconds is the difference between winning or losing. This guy is one of the better summons out there, similar HP to barov servants but the fact that he stays at range means that melees dont have an easy time taking him out. What more could you ask from a trinket?
---
3) I'm alliance, and he takes out grounding totems, which is a big fuck you to shamans. Love it.
---
4) He has a Defensive AI, and unlike other summons won't break polymorph(and I expect other breakable CC like Blinds) actively, or attack the enemy before you get damaged. So summoning him at a right time is important.
---
All things considered, it's one of the stronger trinkets in my arsenal and sees it's fair share of use.
---
Not to mention people levelling alts. 
---
The idea that "no one is questing" just because he isn't is silly.
---
some have options to get rid of them, idk if all of them do, check each of their settings - it may be hidden
---
Entrapment is amazing on frost trap, can proc on multiple people, multiple times.
---
If you can dodge a ball...
---
This is a known issue. Horde have an edge in all racial talents/abilities, as well as monstrous guards to protect them. They have every possible advantage, and this is why the majority of WPvP players roll horde, because they are too weak-minded to fight without every possible advantage.
---
Welcome back :)

New headset since mine just broke :P

Friend sent me [this](https://youtu.be/ctn-tKXx4Sw). Possibly a worst case but still wouldn't want to play horde or ally on a server like that.
---
Check out this page. It mentions notable quest rewards from each zone, as well as links to those quests.

Good
---
I'm confused. What does pvp stand for? Isn't it something about players versus players?
---
Nope. Haven’t touched the game for years never mind private servers.
---
If you think that those aren't bots I'm actually genuinely concerned for your health because you've lost your grip on reality
---
It feels like 2006 again.  *sniff*
---
That's smart I will try that next time
---
QQ bro. Same shit happens to the horde. LH gets over run, BRM gets contested, alliance have TP in control a lot. Difference is we group up as Horde and give Alliance a run for their money and they instantly bubble hearth as soon as they're even numbered and die once.
---
I’m enjoying it myself as a noob to WOW
---
You would have to look at the game from the perspective of the given patch, not through the lens of 1.12.

Maybe they're resetting honor for people that are just gankies lowbies at spawn points? We can only hope so at least.
---
Yojamba?
---
So what you're saying is you need to be entertained by a person before you even consider the clear evidence you're watching with your own eyes?
---
where did you find "Grains of paradise" ? been looking all over for some. 
---
haven't done Online yet cause I wanted see them before I buy them
---
You’re playing a 15 year old games in which if I had to guess, you’ve already put 500+ hours into... what the hell do you expect?
---
But why does it matter?
---
Impossible. It takes like 4-5 seconds to drop combat after casting an offensive spell on another player. That's not "insta-mount".
---
Yeah dude it’s been super great
---
I love that he backpedals.
---
Orc hardiness should be nerfed 10% resist. 25% is just idiotic.
---
As a human rogue, I would literally give up all my racial traits if orcs (which apparently are the majority Horde demographic) -- weren't able to reliably ignore ALL MY CLASS DEFINING ABILITIES.
---
We did 23 Guildies, 17 Randoms 10/10+ 1/1 in about 3 1/2 hours. I was amazed how well the PUGs played and executed my coordinations.
---
Later I invited a lot to join my guild! :-)
---
Read my other comment. The price drops really fast.
---
I'm not sure what you're saying.
---
Yes, they're all troll hunters. They all have chinese pet names. They all move and fight the same way. They all loot the same way. 
---
They're obviously bots this point isn't even up for debate
---
Sweet summer child
---
The lava reminds me of that sound cats make when they're purring and rub the side of the cheek on something. Think about it
---
thankfully imo.
---
nothing worse than seeing a pally item drop as a horde when the boss only drops 1 - 3 pieces of gear
---
Oh you sweet summer child, you realize comment history exists...right.
---
If you don't understand why they're bots then why are you here?
---
You just admitted yourself, you're unqualified to discuss this and yet here you are.
---
We have over 30 minutes chat delay on our server, can't talk to people and buy portals. Its a real shitshow atm \^\^
---
I see people doing it for a long time. I’m guessing they keybind it to a mouse wheel or something so their finger doesn’t get tired from repeated pressing
---
No magic dispel makes druid feel like hot trash.  Surprised you've got Horde flair. Mages make up such a high percentage of the population that being unable to cleanse poly and roots is debilitating.
---
That doesn't sound like they're abusing anything, if they're killing you on the ground there's no abuse happening.
---
Let me go ahead and save you a ton of mental effort on your part.
---
They're bots.
---
don't listen to these drongos.

Thank you so much
---
Stop hiding in the bushes and slay him you coward!
---
Its like 55/45 and i get ganked constantly i just dont bitch about it on reddit
---
My guild refused to transfer, I tried to convince them.
---
What's your proof?
---
And the daily cringe award goes to /u/mallogo
---
I got 2 inside 20 kills and haven’t seen one since in like 200. Rng is rng
---
You're so blind, it's killing me. They're repeating the same set of actions for every kill, refusing to swap off of mobs that are stolen from them, and playing for a dozen hours at a time.
---
This is the most standard bot behavior you can find.
---
You can avoid this cycle of repeated killings by logging off in the intended zone and wait with logging in until after the boat has left that zone. Then your body will have been teleported to the nearest graveyard where you can ress.
---
I doubt 75% of people who comment have ever played warlock, or played it decently well. You don't even make sense, a mob staying up a shadow bolt longer worth of time vs (multi dotting) the other mob going down 3 shadow bolts quicker(low damage estimate of the dots) worth of time will mean your tank takes less damage lmao.
---
Yikes
---
Unless the people running the server come to America to be sued, it doesn't matter. Pservers continue to exist and laugh at C&amp;D letters from Blizzard to this day. Nost wanted to action change, so they honored the threat to leverage a meeting and make a media event. This lead to Classic, and was worth it.
---
But they didn't have to shut down at all.
---
I've honestly probably seen a bot before I just didn't notice them. That's why this video is nice, it indisputably proves it.
---
Yet somehow people are still arguing with me. Why do people think this is up for debate?
---
I was buying ele earth like a fuckin mad man when they were 40-80 silver each. Now they are 1g 60s and will only increase until AQ. Probably still worth buying them if you want a long term investment. 
---
But yeah if you’re at the point where you are asking reddit for investing advice you’re way behind the curve.
---
Yup, been farming the same 2 horde bots in Shimmering Flats now for 30 kills. I'm lvl 31. Somehow they still give me 61 honor per kill. Dunno if its an interface bug or not, guess i'll se tomorrow. Firemaw EU
---
Hahaha yeah.... pretty much how it goes. Worth every second of it tho.
---
Especially in a town. It's like 10 seconds to your corpse... The problem is that you might have to walk 5 times to it
---
are you being dumb on purpose?
---
Going to get the quad too?
---
Same shit sued not happen on horde lmao
---
I wish there existed an accurate way to get the numbers. I'd bet money it's somewhere between 65/35 and 60/40. Still only a slight discrepancy between your thoughts but regardless of the actual numbers it feels a lot worse in the open world. It's tough for me to ride the menethil boat anymore unless it's super early in the morning. Don't take this as "bitching on Reddit" though. Instead of just whining I've taken to raid logging and rolled an alt on a pve server to pass time. 🙂
---
Go to Raven Hill as ally, put detect invis on, kill Unseen ghosts in the houses. Lvl 50. Only horde that go there are the lvl 29-35 twinks.
---
You don't get honor from killing am opponent that is lower than 48 if you are level 60.
---
If you are just now buying twink gear you’re way behind. I doubt it will go up in value much more than it already is. There are so many people with bank alts filled with gear that will dump when BGs hit.
---
Blizzard couldn't do shit though. That's what you don't understand. Sending a letter is free, but Romania and Russia don't protect American IP. Pservers rent server structure in countries that don't protect IP *all the time*. Nost had options besides shutting down.
---
People that are "reluctantly" playing classic because blizzard takes down all the private servers and morons that don't understand how the world works.
---
A level 48 is uncontroversially a lowbie to a level 60.
---
blizz will never shut these servers off dude...  You are crazy!
---
Step 1 drop windfury for your group.
---
Step 2 let the real melee classes to their work.
---
What naming rules... Almost no one follows them, and Blizzard doesn't seem to enforce the rule.
---
Did mine a couple weeks ago. Was supposed to take 1.5 hours. Ended up taking a day and a half. Please say you’re horde. We need more horde on Earthfury!
---
I had the same problem, got my epic mount now.
---
I did mara herbs run, go in from Orange side, gather all the ghost mushroom that you see while moving towards the purple side.
---
It requires 1 lesser invisibility potion, there is one spot u cant get past without aggro, you can also jump down towards the exit with the whole dungeon in ur ass, go out, loose aggro and go in to farm the last mushroom.
---
It will get you 6 mushroom per run, one run took me 13 minutes, you have to get out and move to the Orange side again if you dont use potions.
---
The mushrooms go for 1,30g on my server. 
---
Sell them on raid nights or in stacks of 3.
---
Or you can go fishing, psst aszhara elemental Pools. Google it, worth it. 
---
Or mara princess run, it aint hard, and also some mushrooms and blindweed on the way.
---
Just make sure you have minor speed enchant on ur boots. 
---
Tinker you can take straight up, just keep ur distance and dot with a smite here and there. 
---
Princess is just dot and run, when she gets close shield and wait for her to cast the cloud aoe spell, you can get a smite or 2 in there and start moving again. Super easy, just takes a while, dont rush it
---
Tinker boss and princess, both drop blues, each run atleast 4 to 8g, get an alt or a friend te reset and each run should rake around 12 minutes. 
---
Here its vendor gold, with the mushrooms or fishing it is auction house gold, can sit for a while. 
---
Hope this helps, its long and boring but if you do the fishing in the off hours where it is not camped and mara during peak hours when u dont wanna get ganked. 
---
And farm a little honor with the 49ish that run mara, cruell but hej, pvp server :)
---
&gt;Blizzard just refunds everything from the hacked party's account.
---
Proof? They don't.
---
8k armor and still manage 300 +heal in pvp gear. Yeah my heals hit like less than half as hard, but rogues getting 25 white hit crits makes them beneath contempt. It's like tanking and healing combined, with a BoP for the mages and a Sac to break poly/sap/engihelm, trying to keep things hitting you so your dps can maul them. God I can't wait for more pieces of t2... esp since I'll be needing something to look forward to, getting Nef helm way after some 'real' clothies is going to be just as bad as Mageblade is now
---
lost 36k according to honor spy, bleu
---
The MC attunement came after MC released as you originally had to run through BRD as a raid to get to MC. There was no teleport/attunement to it.
---
This is a known issue. Honor between 3am and 8am is not recorded. Ive been having messages all week with GM's who finally admitted the problem.
---
How do you type on it is my only question.
---
That is fucking hilarious.  Get to it boys, I need to buy some gold for my mount.
---
Spirit of Aquamentas is better than Fire Runed Grimoire for most caster classes. I didn't wanna farm ST till I got the right OH so I just took a Staff of Dominance on my mage 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
---
Whatever happened to those ST class quests?
---
3-8am is not currently counted towards your weekly rank or honor total. Its a known bug. You PVP'd during the off hours.
---
Agreed. When honor rolled out back in vanilla guilds were very split up on levels. We didn't have thousands of bis geared players ready to camp the instant honor was farmable.
---
That sucks. I should say at least twice though. Ran into 5 different gank groups on my way in today and regretted not just taking the back door. still only 6 deaths though, so alliance really have it bad. It's just usually exactly 2 deaths for me.
---
I'm looking at the talent trees from TBC and I doubt it's what I'm speaking about. Not only it's adding +10 levels worth of talent points,  but from what I've heard it didn't actually solve the problems these specs have.
---
I'll never get it, FML.
---
Does it matter if they're tank specced if the healer is geared and they hold aggro?
---
Druid tanks have a set of boots that are decent, so it's not impossible to find a tank.
---
 But as a druid tank that already has to boots, I've never had a problem charging all the orbs for a run  haha
---
y they will force us to shittest exp ever, tbc
---
Lol
---
&gt;people are coming to Classic with a misguided sense of what to expect, and are asking Blizzard to change the game after they begged for the original experience
---
Did you even play vanilla? We didn't have 10k+ people online at the same time in 2005. Get your shit straight, this is NOT the original experience
---
When he says " protest that you piece of **** " I feel that same victory when I get my hands on you slippery mages.
---
Exhibit B
---
That is the weird things, rogues are either dick or kindest person ever. Some of best in game friend are rogue or mage.
---
zeppelin guards didn't shoot you off, blizzard just added that to prevent roof camping.
---
And now the zeppelin guards pull out their guns and shoot you down :D
---
At least you get to appreciate it during all those quintessence runs.
---
I play ally there as well. I’ve had no problems during my leveling journey so far.
---
More likely they looked to Everquest with more d2 influences.
---
The gift of not participating in black friday
---
Where to get Debufftimer, I have yet to find an addon that works at showing enemy debuffs.
---
That's why they call them Normal servers.
---
You're concerned for history health because he is unsure if thoae wow characters are bots? Dude...
---
Just flip raid consumes... No need to long term invest; some people don't plan well so you charge them a premium. 
---
(They're not bad as long term investments too because a lot of guilds won't require Flask of Supreme Power for casters cause MC is roflstomp but they will be nearly mandatory for Naxx progression raids, for example. You will just get more throughput flipping them. If you play Atiesh Horde find a different hustle though 😂😂😂)
---
Yes across all servers (I think.. not 100% confirmed). It's based on server time. 
---
I play on Yojamba (OCE), and because of time difference to where I am, it's a major issue :(
---
And you don't even know which of the four I am ;)
---
right back at you mate, everytime i go to dm its always camped by alliance not horde, not once, ive seen horde raids in feralas, always alliance, i die 5 to 6 times and im a rogue, imagine ppl who cant stealth, and the disparaty of our comments is what I call player preception, you literally just proved my point, thks for that
---
Then he chose the wrong system to rank up in.
---
what does this even mean? any other profession is more valuable than enchanting for the individual player. it takes me exactly 2 minutes to type "LF enchanter [LITERALLY ANY ENCHANT I WANT]" and it costs me 1-2g each time. This is not retail, you enchant maybe 3-5 gear pieces per slot from the moment u hit 60 until naxx. If you want to make money pick a gathering profession or alchemy, or even better, both.
---
This man knows what's up! Ornygator's just preparing for Heigan well in advance.
---
&gt;was thunderfury a rare sight or did most people have it by the time BC was rolling around?
---
Most serious progression guilds had 1-2 thunderfuries by the time BC came out, and most players were not in serious progression guilds.
---
Watch  this be so you  cant farm the bots  they refuse to ban.
---
All of my honour and kills all vanished today 100% of it
---
Befriend a healer in the guild and run some DME jump runs, repairs bills sorted.
---
Dungeon wise- LBRD until 58 then scholo or strat. I dinged 60 on my lock tonight by doing that. I’m Alliance on Skeram, no options outside of dungeons, it’s all a gank fest.
---
Personally, if I ever grouped with someone and found them asking to take items for their repair bill, that would be my final run with them.
---
That's why I was able to quest yesterday then😁 liking it😂
---
No, that is actually really helpful to know how to make them spawn
---
This isn't real pvp. Real pvp isn't a 1v1 scenario. Real pvp is where you need your 5 point kidney shot stun to stop the orc warrior from killing your priest healer and it's resisted  so your priest dies and then so do you because now you're outnumbered.
---
Bleed kiting a warrior 1v1 is not real pvp. That is a duel, and that does not account for 90% of the pvp you will come across in Classic.
---
Sadly moonwalking was taken out, one of the swaggiest things :(
---
No, it's more so the unaccounted kills. those 100+ also vanished today, and the 25 from yesterday got reduced to 12 somehow. Something buggy going on.
---
If you are wiping so much that you don't make money from just the gold looted, then you're doing something wrong.
---
I think you're being greedy, but feel free to ask whatever price you want to tank.
---
Ccc to track slow and cc timers
---
As far as I know +4 xbow skill will do nothing.  However, there's a bracer that also gives +2 xbow skill.  With +5 crossbow skill you only need 3% hit to hit a lvl 63 boss.
---
I have both of these, the bone bow, and the carapace xbow.  The shatterstone and the bone bow both have a 2.9 atk speed, and since I ama a troll I have +5 bow skill, which makes them the same.
---
That said, I don't even need the 3% hit, and use the much slower carapace xbow.
---
A tank can't farm... LOL
---
No clue
---
Doing God’s work with your staunch principles. Keep up the downvoting!
---
Spirit tap works for the 5 seconds after casting mind blast. Spirit tap increases your spirit by 100% and allows 50% of your mana regeneration to continue while casting (as in the 5 seconds after casting mind blast). It’s really situationally dependent but I found in most situations if I can snipe a killing blow with a spell it is a pretty solid net mana positive.
---
Hope you don't get diahrrea, or those 20 minutes might not be enough!
---
I laughed at this way more than I am comfortable to admit
---
And that's when you invest in a second account for bank alts. A "bank account" of sorts.
---
which race is the best hunter? Are taurens good hunters?
---
I'm literally listening to "Eh, Eh" by Lady Gaga and it matches hilariously well.
---
they definitely knew +weapon damage existed

"VidÉo"

Gnomes look like children though.   
---
FBI, that guy right there. Check it out.
---
Sure, I thought you meant "spawn points" as in where new characters are created.
---
Maybe warmode isn’t that bad after all Classic has become heaven for toxic players!
---
Holy Priest here with herbalism. I do Maraudon (sometimes enter through orange for extra Ghosties) and DM lashers. Herbing makes both far more profitable.

spirit tap lets you regen mana while inside the 5 second rule at a 50% rate.  but yes wanding is ideal.
---
Race dependent. VERY hard as Gnome.
---
I swear the horde has the dumbest names just proves my theory about them
---
I was 5 15 years ago and since then I have less time to play but clearly got more efficient (not hard to be better than 5yo you) and since then I learned to cook my OWN hotpockets. There are plenty of pve servers if you aren't having fun I hope you do though.
---
Oh boy oh boy! You tabard rocks too! Cannot tell why tho... *winks*
---
I understand that. Also, if it was on a per server basis it would encourage people to play on servers closer to their time zone. Less chinese on a west coast server? Sounds like a win-win to me.
---
Cancer

I healed UBRS in mostly zf gear and a couple brd pieces as shadow.. going holy really isn't necessary until the 40man raids.
---
Eksdee
---
Booty bay boats are safer than alliance. And u wont get stuck in endless loop.
---
I'm rank 1 but literally not farming honor at all it shouldn't be that hard to reach r10 in the future when running wsg premades, it might take a while but I'll get there.
---
It is, taking more dmg is more rage which is more threat too.
---
From what I've seen and heard skarm is definitely not a chill person at all. I play alliance on his server and have lots of friends who play horde on Fairbanks also, and all my horde friends say that him and his guild consistently exhibit some of the most toxic behavior of anyone they run into, and all my alliance friends dislike him because he actively tries to make the game as unplayable as possible for us by camping the entirety of searing gorge and brm with 100+ people on a 66/33 horde server then bragging about it and explicitly saying that his goal is to grief alliance.
---
Id understand if the top are doing it but literally everyone is, like bitch 98% of you won't get rank 14 so stop griefing
---
Just wait for a group to ask for a tank a dozen times in LFG then approach them, they will probably give you their first born, atleast on my server they would.
---
These guys are being goofy If you need some extra gold for repairs ask away you wear plate you have aggro you will die more your repairs will be more farming as prot is shit and constantly respecing Is going to cost you more in the long run. Take some of them greens and get that paper booboo
---
You look like a bunch of fucking idiots.
---
It only does it if your body's on the zep.  Got ganked on the zep and tried running back to the spirit healer when I saw the zep leave, as soon as the zep changed continents I respawned on it.
---
I am the only DW fury in my guild. It’s kind of a very nice peace of mind that Deathbringer is prio to me and me alone. If only it would drop...
---
Completely agree.
---
Like i'm on the easy side of it, but I see how PvP is impacting people, so to say these other complaints aren't real complaints with a witty slogan that completely mischaracterises the issue... Goes both ways, people complaining about people playing the game is fucking stupid thing to complain about it.
---
They will be introduced in a later phase.
---
man I wish turkey and bread was real
---
At the time of release, Naxx was intended to be in EPL, the instance portal was intended to be in Stratholme. In fact you can still see the portal behind the gates where the undead swarm from after beating Ramstein.
---
They never used that portal in the end because they realised having raid portals inside instances (like BRD -&gt; MC and UBRS -&gt; BWL) is redundant due to the alternate ways inside, not to mention how awkward it is to use those portals.
---
Where is a good place to get the crystals? Even before phase 2 I could hardly find any rich nodes.
---
You can set any rules you wish but I think you should do that when you are looking for people, not after you found them. “LFM &lt;dungeon_name&gt;,  blue and green gear you don’t need goes to tank” - this is how it typically looks like on my server, wording may vary as I am playing on a russian server but the idea is pretty straighforward. As a healer I don’t join any of these groups as I find it unfair, but there are many other players happy to do so.
---
Looks like the barren wastelands of westfall!
---
Wish I had time to play...
---
I had a few 2/3 wlocks as dps dungeon runs. Sometimes I wanna ask for water money, sometimes I wanna just quit. (Pretty rarely) But on occasion you'd get some locks that just spam life tap, refuse to drink/eat/bandage and start insulting you if you tell them to at least eat/drink while I'm oom as a healer.
---
Most are fine and don't expect you to heal them more than the tanks and some are quite smart in how they life tap and are a joy to heal. But on occasion I feel like deleting the game.
---
Tldr: what's next? Ask for water cost.
---
The Onyxia fix also seemed to make her melee people while she's flying around if you're close and get fireball agro
---
For one class or all eight?
---
Did that on a beasts of northrend wipe because no one took it seriously never a dull moment with hammer.
---
This clip makes me want to be a hunter. A good hunter like this.
---
You are actually using the word incorrectly, this is what I think the guy above your message is trying to say. He is correct in saying regardless as that is what you should have used. There are very few ways to use irregardless correctly however maybe he should have explained that instead of just correcting you without an explanation.
---
No id say thats pretty average tbh
---
Being listed as "nonstandard" in an online dictionary isn't the same as being a word in most dictionaries.
---
phase 5
---
OP's guildie is a dumb fuck. If you release spirit as soon as you die after you enter the new continent, you can easily make it to the boat with time in reserve.
---
Rank 14 = giving up at life
---
Everyone is doing as they have to compete with the people on their faction. Most people aren’t going for rank 14, but just to get rank 10 you HAVE to farm honour efficiently to get in the top brackets.
---
You don’t really seem to understand the intricacies of the pvp rank system, which probably explains why you are so salty (as you think people are griefing) when in reality they are trapped in a poorly designed system that forces people to farm honour instead of pvping for fun.
---
I've got sidebar, I don't know how, I didn't install it explicitly, i guess it came bundled with something else.
---
Cheers though, I will have a look at their options and see what I can find.
---
Depends on the class. For a hunter it's 0-10. For a priest it's 30-40. Both in solo play, obviously.
---
Needs to respec to farm? What if he is deep prot for raiding. After awhile its raid then spend 50g to respec to farm gold to repair buy consumables and an extra 100 to respec prot then back to a spec worth using to farm. Not everyone has the time for all of that

Listening Levan Polka while watching

Who cares , its classic the fights are not challenging working or bugged :P

Fights are lasting less than 60 seconds. With anything else other than flash heal, I would emd each fight with 60% mana, which is wasteful. 
---
Most boss fights I'm just casting smite.
---
You can extremely easily avoid this, off the top of my head, in 4 completely different ways. This is entirely on OP's guildie who is not bright.
---
I wanna write some helpful stuff, but it's just so hard to help someone as helpless as OP.
---
Yep, been doing Mara Goblin + Princess runs in Holy raid spec and with semi-decent gear it takes me about 11-12 minutes per run. Definitely not the best gold per hour farm in game but it helps to pay the bills
---
Heartseeker is a lost cause, like Skeram and Stalagg.  Earthfury is still semi-balanced.
---
He's right. I agree you should play what you want to play but if you're that worried about pvp racials you should really be a dwarf priest or a horde priest.
---
Because some bosses use the GUID for certain abilities (See the main post). So if you created your character earlier than someone else you are more likely to be targetted.
---
Blizzard bans in waves.
---
And a queue would give the horde an incentive to xer off the server.  It literally solves both problems....
---
The sitting one is human only AFAIK
---
Those were over pretty quick for me. An SM Cath run, a couple of RFD runs and Ulda runs and before I knew I was 45, and could go into ZF. Warrior tank though, and I think I understand why that bracket would be bad for shaman.
---
Yeah, stupid autocorrect.
---
Mage alt is one of the fastest 60s and has great QoL with teleports.
---
Warlocks and hunters are really fast to level (faster than mage if you quest) and Warlocks have free epic mount. Both classes are S tier at gold farming, head and shoulders above all other classes at gold farming at 60 because they can solo instanced bosses rather easily.
---
If your alt is just to funnel gold to your main, you can't beat hunter, lock, or mage.
---
fyi that's bracket 13, not 2.
---
Probably dme jump runs
---
Like a record baby?
---
What do you do about eruptions are the end? Won't they kill the add tank and potentially let firesworns loose into the raid?
---

2H Fury is pretty trash for Alliance in PVE. Weapon skill also doesn't matter that much in PVP. Spinal Reaper in PVP is amazing for any race Warrior. The Proc on an HK is pretty insane. True, BRE is better, but I wouldn't pass on a chance for SR
---
Horde is gay
---
Warlock complaining. This is where we stand atm..
---
Asking the important questions.
---
Yeah it wasn't great at everything indeed. Like the RNG procs on crafting and the enchanting etc. The grind was unreal like your PVE gear at 50.. and the AP for pvp gear damnn.. but unlike WoW you got insane amount of PvP point for killing a high rank enemy. That was also well thought out. anyway the game is dead now lol
---
Tauren Warriors are the best looking in raid gear, so yes, play a Tauren.
---
I feel like this is a big thing that isn’t being acknowledged by the majority of players. A lot of people are coming back to classic wow from like retail or vanilla and haven’t played on the private servers so their idea of what pvp servers are like is completely outdated compared to the population that’s been playing on private servers for the past ten years has been doing.
---
lol he isn't salty because of a lack of understanding dude, he's salty because he cant run his dungeon.
---
The mass bot problem only exist cause of people buying gold. :(
---
True, but most tanks don't have shield slam
---
By your own rationale, they should turn off honor from 0730-1630. 
---
GO. 
---
TO. 
---
WORK/SCHOOL. 
---
Not everyone works day shift/lives in a time zone that 0300-0800est is the night

Look into a Weakaura reminder for your cooldown. It helped me a lot with mooncloth.
---
I got robbed of quite a few kills the past week.

---
Not all, but most. Id say about 60% of servers are Horde favoured, 5% are close to balanced and 35% are Alliance favoured.
---
If you just look at PVP servers its probably worse.
---
Once you master what your hunter can do you can win most fair encounters, and u can also level insanely fast if your determined, and plan accordingly.
---
can somebody tell me why melee attack and damage are highlighted white but not power, a few lvls ago they all three were green. i also feel like im doin less dmg(might not be true)
---
You guys really need to read up on weapon normalization, god damn you’re all clueless, lol. 
---
But enjoy your shitty ass weapon :) I did.
---
I love how most wow players who post long shit have a PhD in English literature.
---
Nah... not on my server.
---
Yes. Classic doesn't work like retail.
---
I'm concerned for anyone's health who sees something with their own eyes and thinks it isn't real  
---
That's what mental hospitals are for. Get help
---
Why are you using old numbers that clearly don’t take normalization into account?
---
No, it's an advantage for sure, but nothing you couldn't do with a few friends as well. He doesn't get anything just for his money he still would have to put in work.
---
Then you literally fit perfectly into the qualifier I made in my post for when flash heal is fine, why are you upset?
---
Did you release first or no?
---
What are you doing in dungeons that you aren't making at least 10-20g per run just from picking up vendor trash and greeding on everything? 
---
Yes, thinking yourself more entitled to greed gear is a dick move. You can't do the dungeon without them and it should be more than profitable enough to come out well ahead on gold if you aren't wiping lots of times per run.
---
Source for the increased melee range?
---
This is news to me, which server? US?
---
Yeah I get home at midnight lmao
---
Then I might have a new job incoming where I’ll work 6 pm to 6 am but only 3 days a week.
---
That's funny, because crackpots like you downvoted the fuck out of me when I tried to warn people that phase 2 would be an epic disaster.
---
But now you knew all along....  Right.  You even knew before we knew the server populations would be several fold higher than vanilla.  
---
total bs
---
ps:  Classic is nothing like vanilla. If you even played vanilla in any serious way, then you would know you are talking out of your ass.
---
there were bots in 2006 guys.  a lot of them
---
Download more ram while you’re at it.
---
once you get your blue swords through quest rewards, respec and go combat swords.. that will benefit you the most. daggers are great late game, but you need gear.. for now swords will be the way to go and the easiest way to lvl
---
Wow-professions.com has a guide on leveling lockpicking. I skimmed it and when I’m in questing in a relevant zone I just go and do the lockpicking portion at the same time.
---
No, listen, you Rez at the graveyard which is the closest to your body. Hope that helps.
---
Find the center point and try to spin as closely as possible - can get em going quite fast.
---
In my experience, it's fairly equal. Brm can be either horde or ally controlled at times etc. But there is a slight favor for horde in terms of numbers, maybe 40-60 or 45-55.
---
This small imbalance quickly snowballs into more and more ally not logging in, which imbalances things even more.
---
Personally, most dungeon entrances etc are horde controlled and as ally you will be gangfucked multiple times trying to get to dm/zf/brm etc
---
But this is just my personal experience, might not be accurate
---
You hve Onyxia buff that gives you 140 AP.
---
1 strengh = 2 AP, 14 AP is 1 weapon dps.
---
tbh it takes a ton of time to play at a high level especially late game
---
Pretty big words coming from someone who hates black people
---
Even if that was true, PVP balancing is objectively an opinion.
---
If you can't identify a bot the best thing to do is probably just shut up when it comes to conversations about them
---
Reminded me of the infamous /sit /stand macro in vanilla.
---
Why is *none* wearing pants - are you telling me that it is not an appropriate way to celebrate your first tabard design?
---
Set My mind to 39. You cant change that. Answer My question or dont. But dont tell me shit like that when i clearly made up My mind
---
Clipped. 
---
In fact with rhok´delar it is easier to hold steady dps in fights. You can have xbow from BWL , but if you are clipping there, you will have maybe even less dps than with Rhok. You don´t have to be so careful about autos with rhok. But even with clipping, its not that different dps. All and all good bow for lazy hunters :D
---
Just like the last post. This "proof" is all anecdotal, we have absolutely no proof this problem even exists.
---
I have around 10 hardcore nolifers in my guild, who PvP 18 hours a day, from around 12 PM to 6AM every single day. I've asked them if they've noticed anything about this and they havent. They even showed me their honor gains, for every single one of them, so thats at least 10 people who have not lost a single honor over +10 days of grinding in that particular time span.
---
So I'd say that this problem does not exist, and if it does, its really really rare.
---
Mods, close this thread please
---
My guild likes to form up raid groups and raid BRM, we usually manage to hold it for an hour or so before a raid group twice our size shows up
---
hahaha
---
No.
---
&gt; The reason we, and these dictionaries above, define irregardless is very simple: it meets our criteria for inclusion. This word has been used by a large number of people (millions) for a long time (over two hundred years) with a specific and identifiable meaning ("regardless"). The fact that it is unnecessary, as there is already a word in English with the same meaning (regardless) is not terribly important; it is not a dictionary's job to assess whether a word is necessary before defining it. The fact that the word is generally viewed as nonstandard, or as illustrative of poor education, is likewise not important; dictionaries define the breadth of the language, and not simply the elegant parts at the top.
---
So get over it.
---
Because blizzard moved the daily 3am reset to 8am and theres probably some old code still using the 3am.
---
I log in once a week.
---
Super hard content
---
He really isn't though.
---
Irregardless is redundant, but still a word.
---
Get over it.
---
you mean like playing the game since day 1 and being griefed with no intervention from GMs?
---
Don't know why you are getting down voted... You're right. We control it on my server too, just organize big guilds to pop it at 13 so you can get it again at 19.
---
Best Profession to go with engineering once you are done with mining? Enchanting? Alchemy?
---
So for the people that can play mostly at night will have to find a server half way around the world with high latency?
---
Gehennas discord has plenty of dank memes.
---
The voice of an angel truly
---
And, as I said in another comment, that is fine. Just dont stream it on Twitch. lol.
---
It's counting for the vast majority of people. I have never heard of anyone on my server having this issue.
---
You are 100% correct. So is the guy arguing against flying mounts. It's not even close. 
---
Not sure, but it seems like dude was just arguing to argue or out of some misplaced need to win an argument. The internet is such a strange and fascinating place.
---
I do believe that's a naked baby.
---
cool thx, never was much of one for googling stuff unless i just have to. But dont have much time to play anymore so i think will be looking stuff up alot more
---
Nothing keeps the guy from asking a mage a port to darna if he wants to go to another continent
---
Okay, thanks.
---
Its weird i dont want to get all the loot. A fair roll is a fair roll.
---
Just thinking doing MC with the same guys will Help gearing cause no or fewer not so geared people are with me.
---
This is your best bet, go for this. That lag/click sucks, but I'm sure you won't do the same thing again!
---
Is there any way to track weapon on-hit procs? Details treats Wraith scythe, demon forged breastplate and skullflame shield all as one effect. Recount only separates them by HOT/Instant
---
I wake up at 6pm and go to bed at 8am.. so.. no
---
lol wut. How would you even cleanse poly off yourself?  I'm talking about dispelling the people you play with.
---
The link posted by u/Yo112358 is pretty great. A lot of the "notable quest rewards" don't seem at all very notable, but if you go through them quickly you'll find some interesting ones that you will want to complete. The first one mentioned under Blasted Lands also awards a 16-slot bag (not shown there), Un'Goro linken quest line is good, In Dreams and later the Last Barov under WPL are the ones I'd pick out from that list. Plus the MC and Onyxia attunements, of course. 
---
Grinding somewhere out of the way is probably a wise decision though, but I understand that some quest lines are ones that you will get started on early, as they are quite long. All those linked above are long, save MC attunement.
---
It didn't charge the first month basically.
---
You're either a troll, or just really dense without any form of self awareness. You thinking it's a bot is just as much as an opinion as pvp balancing. I invite you to level as alliance in a horse dominated faction (or vice versa). You'll change your mind pretty quick. 
---
Not sure what your first comment about black people is about, but it makes it pretty clear you think that using kindergarten level of responses would make you win an argument.
---
I was mistaken in that case :(
---
i'd guess it wouldn't be too bad because there will be enough games going that they will cycle quickly
---
Ah, you mean world FIRST Rag? back then? Hardcore community wasn't yet a thing. It matured by 1.12, though. Or so I heard.
---
Happened a lot with blood queen as well on hc :P
---
The issue is it makes the fight way easier, as aggro isn t an issue.
---
But i can't dance and i can't walk.
---
The only thing about me is the way that i talk.
---
Black friday is only an American commercial-holiday tho
---
Ok so regarding your 3rd point....we should not be sacrificing a nearly complete auto shot for an off cooldown aimed shot. I feel given that, it's mostly logical common sense application
---
started with priest and it felt like easy mode game. added a new account, warlock and i leveled it to 60 in 5 days with priest behind. pure grind felt awesome, relaxing, etc. and that was the moment when ive knew i can do it. it took me a week until lvl 30 to realise that i want to lvl new accounts but with 1-2 60s in party exp is nerfed. Started a new team and that was it, 7.
---
Enchanting is kinda useless and Alchemy will cost a ton without herbalism.
---
If you can make a ton of gold, go with Alchemy. Otherwise, stick to mining or herbalism.
---
The new album for "And My Axe"
---
Very true but to increase profits the crafting is essential. I only picked up Alchemy to farm Arcanite - then needed a way to pay for it so I gave this method a go..
---
In two weeks I grew from 50g to 200g - then 200 - 500 then 500 to 1000 and as I invest more my earnings ramp up and effort goes down. Its not for everyone but it works for me.
---
&gt; what I've heard it didn't actually solve the problems these specs have.
---
It did, more or less.  Blizzard still had it's stupid hybrid tax, but it was nowhere as bad, and the unique buffs the specs brought usually more or less compensated for the reduced dps they provided.
---
wpvp wise it seems to be equal with a slight tendency towards alliance. world bosses are controlled by horde tho (personally saw 4 worldbosses and horde literally dominated)
---
For everyone else replying to this all aggro, there's no way he was being serious. Chill out
---
Ok Boomer.
---
We are banking around 2 epics per raid at most. Maybe the top 10 guilds on any given server are trashing 80% of MC epics at this point, but I suspect you may be deluded by your own anecdotal experience.
---
That’s why I specifically said “but” - yes, the mage who stands on the roof is abusing game mechanics and it’s against tos and reportable so I report him, BUT that’s not what we’re talking about here.
---
OK, I'll take your advice over what the doctors said.
---
The annoying part are the 10+ man ganksquads, small groups are fun to play as and against but getting zerged by a huge group is such a snoozefest. It's literally pointless too because you get like 10 honor per kill... Yet every time I go WPL/Felwood/Winterspring there's a good chance there will be several of these roaming around (I am Alliance btw). Idk if it's a thing on other servers too
---
Yeah it's still who scans, there's not really any other data that you can gather so position is available. Although "out in the world" doesn't necessary mean they are doing wpvp but it's an interesting idea to compare those values between faction as well. The only thing I've really done with that is look up how many people are in instances. It can vary a lot (depending on time the scan is done) but I've gotten values between 10% and north of 33% being in instances (no differentiation between dungeon and raids done). Not at home so can't say what the highest value I've ever seen there is.
---
The number is lower than 5500 per scan, as you can only scan one faction per run at a time, but put together I see more than 5000 on my realm (venoxis-de/eu) during most populated time (which is sunday evening, btw.) where it has queue. Highest I've seen is \~5600ish with an error of +-300 due to runtime (\~20min both scans done concurrently). You can scan your own (pvp) realm only with two accounts or realms you don't play on by just creating, scanning and deleting chars with a single account in sequence to get both sides.
---
The character sheet is one of the least informative about your actual stats.
---
Download an add-on for detailed character sheets.
---
To address your question, the green stats are stats that have direct increases from gear or buffs.
---
Lets gooo Stalagg
---
Corsair Scimitar MMO mouse. Not only for gaming but any software. It’s a really nice mouse. Otherwise if you can afford a nice monitor, I’d recommend one. Max 27”.
---
Definitely not the case
---
*Right click*.
---
The warsong leggings only require reputation with Silverwing Sentinels, which transaltes to roughly 200 WSG wins to get to exalted. IT's quite the grind, but totally worth it.
---
Those leggings have 21 Str, 21 Stam, 25 Spelldmg, 1% crit, 1% hit. Even, if you don't like pvp, as a ret paladin, you should at least get those leggings and rank 7 or 10 along with it. Rank 7 allows you to use gloves + boots, which is also an ok combo, shoulders + boots are better, but gloves + boots are still better than anything you can get besides flameguard + chromatic boots (which should be warrior priority and you probably waste the hit on those)
---
its still probably the beast alliance server on EU rn
---
Guilty
---
There was a paladin sitting at the flight master in everlook today on his mount for like... 15 minutes. This is completely unusual because depending on which faction is occupying everlook at any given time, being within 50 yards of the city itself is a surefire way to get camped. He had no AFK tag, no other alliance showed up, and people kept running by targetting him and then leaving. I was wondering why nobody was taking the free honor and figured I'd do it myself, only to get close enough to open, and then chicken out.
---
Sometimes the best defense is mystery. I've been jumped by too many double druid double rogue + 1 visible character parties to mess with that guy. I bet that satyr has 4 stealthies with him and I feel for you cowering in that bush.
---
Goblin rocket boots don't require engineering to use!
---
So just find an engineer buddy and ask him to craft them for you, providing mats. Or buy them off the AH for a but more gold.
---
They sometimes blow up so you will need to get a new pair every now and then.
---
They are still superior to the gnomish version because of a shorter cool down and a greater speed boost (70% Vs 50%).
---
They didn t charge ranged players. Now they do.
---
Weird that they've got Chinese names. We've got a legit Chinese guild on Bigglesworth and I've never seen any of those guys with non-roman characters.
---
The problem is that Horde on ZT concentrates more in bigger raids (in my experience), which allows them to take over places easier and with more coordination. Alliance players are more split in smaller groups or solo, which is much better for honor gain. Also zergfests are just plain unfun too imo.
---
He's obviously outplaying him with his elite movement skills.
---
Faction caps, because at the moment the horde are the only ones able to transfer off and they have no incentive to do so.
---
By "at this point" I meant after AQ release.
---
You could have all the gnomes in different raids with one of your guildies to stop cheating if you want. 
---
And maybe a smaller prize for the top 25/50/100 too? Some people might stop if they realise they aren't getting top 3. Maybe some of the horde vendor pets? 
---
Great idea anyway! Sounds like ye have a really fun guild! GL HF!
---
Definitely join a guild, I don't see why people wouldn't. Look around for a bit to try and find one with a loot system that fits you (be it DKP, Loot council or something else), similar minded people that you get along with, make some friends, and try to raid to have fun. If you picked a loot system that you can live with, it's probably one that will ensure that loot will come to you at some point - in the meantime, enjoy the raid and try to out-DPS those with better gear. Be one of the team! 
---
On the note of loot systems - our guild recently swapped from DKP to Loot council, and even though I really like a DKP system this LC system seems quite fair - every player makes a loot priority list of 5-10 items they want/need in descending order and add it to a google doc for the class leader (and officers) to be OK:d, and then those docs are shared among everyone of that class. Previous DKP, raid attendance and performance were also factored in if tiebreaks were needed. If you and another player have Item X on the same priority level and you're in a raid where it drops, you just /roll. If you are the only one with it on the highest priority, you get it. 
---
DKP on the other hand is based on attendance for which you're awarded DKpoints, with which you bid (possibly against other players) on items that drop. It basically ensures that sooner or later you'll get an item you want, since whenever you lose a bid war someone else will probably be paying a considerable sum of DKP.
---
Blizzard doesn't ban any mail. It has to originate from a suspicious account.
---
Just ask the thousands of people buying gold in a daily basis. It wouldn't be an industry this big if Blizz was efficient in combating it.
---
Yeh, what you are saying is since he is paying for 10 accounts its not unfair. That is essentially pay to win.
---
With 10 accounts you trivialize a ton of content and makes farming for rare materials or money, a non existent issue. Like looking for black lotus.
---
I've seen a couple bots, but I don't really think it's that big of a deal. Probably new software developed for Classic and it will take some time for cheat detection to catch up and we'll see a wave of bans and then the cycle will start over. For as long as there's people wanting to buy gold. Unless we get WoW tokens in classic. I'd love to see the reactions to that.
---
It's definitely not as big a deal as the shitshow that is unbalanced PvP realms. No one is quitting the game because they cant sell rugged leather for 2g a stack.
---
There are like 2 zones that take flying into account... And you could easily get around that by putting a teleporter there, or a fp.
---
Or just make flying mounts last for 1 minute duration with a 20 min cd.
---
Spy, rank14losa, omicc and some kind of enemy cast bar. Bonus for a decent name plate addon
---
That's not true - the class balance was way more even, and itemization was good the whole way through, but the pve content itself was nerfed heavily partway through that expansion. Heroics became a joke because they were used as catch up later on. The raids themselves were also heavily nerfed, and kara had loot added. It used to be endgame dungeons -&gt; kara - &gt; HC p-&gt; real raids in terms of gear.
---
That is fantastic, it means there is a place for these nerds.
---
Spinal is worse for pve than OEB, Earthshaker, Runeblade or Shahram. It's better than common pre-raid 2h weapons (demonshear, malowns etc.). If you are arms, Spinal Reaper is possibly better than Earthshaker due to mace spec being useless in pve.
---
The human racial is a massive factor, which beats the large dps discrepancy. Similarily Ashkandi and BRE are better for humans in pve than Dark Edge of Insanity.
---
Remember that you not only lose 3% hit by using an axe, but also glancing blow damage. 40% of your white attacks will be glancing blows and they deal 65% dmg with an axe, but 85% dmg with a sword or mace.
---
What else do you want? Armies marching in columns? Numbers are all you need for overwhelming advantage. Alliance does the same thing.
---
it blows my mind that this is a response from a company this size
---
Have a great day!
---
here is another spot to view old comments declaring 3-4 orbs a run average. https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12811/righteous-orb#comments
---
Have you considered that everything you're talking about is anecdotal and NOT the universal experience of all players on all servers?
---
My warrior alt is easily able to find raid spots. But our server is oversaturated with healers.
---
&gt; Farming is awful as a healer too and you don't see us asking for extra stuff to make up for it
---
Well actually in my experience healers get all Dark Runes dropped in scholomance.
---
You can disable this from happening
---
Yah, pretty much.  In that example, I forgot to mention the procs of clipping.   You gained an auto atk for waiting 25 ms.  But had you clipped, then you would have gained an incredibly small chance to get another aimd shot off at the boss.  What chance,
---
auto shot 300 dmg 
---
aimed shot 900 dmg
---
atk speed 2.52 sec
---
Aimed shot cd 6 sec
---
0.025 sec / 6 sec * 100 = 0.4167%
---
0.42% chance to get another aimed shot.  So, at 900 dmg, that's on average a damage gain of 3.75 dps.  Basically nothing.
---
2h fury is fine for alliance.
---
In a world of min max bs it's not "ideal" but you will be able to do competitive dps with more investment to rotation and monitoring your swings.
---
Nick isn't very clever, is he? They just told him they can't add honor manually, and his first request is to have it added manually.
---
Not toooooo bright.
---
I know that feel. As a healer I hate warlocks simply because I can’t immediately identify whether they are being attacked or just lifetapping. While I am drinking they are standing with 40% mana doing nothing, and then the battle starts and hell yeah, NOW it’s a great time to start lifetapping!
---
I leveled alchemy to 300 for less than 100g.  Will break even on arcanite transmutes alone in just over a month.
---
liar.  there are not hundreds of posts of different players confirming they've lost hks and honor during the morning period.  the thanksgiving change in honor updates times also resulted in an additional influx of posts from daytime players stating they'e lost honor.
---
and calling bs on your obvious lie of "hey even showed me their honor gains, for every single one of them, so thats at least 10 people who have not lost a single honor over +10 days".  what a liar.
---
50-60
---
It takes so long and quests start becoming scarce and very stretched out between zones. And you get a ton of dungeon quests but it's difficult to join them because people will prefer a 60.
---
Any hunters found a better gold farm than DM Tribute farm?
---
IF you want to disenchant greens just make a lvl 5 alt with engineering.
---
Because I don't like pet simulator classes or casters in Vanilla?
---
&gt;For a hunter it's 0-10.
---
1-10 isn't bad for anyone.
---
Sorry, but do you have a source that said server is anything other than perfect 50:50 split? Blizzard stopped reporting their numbers and until then we must assume every server is 50:50. Otherwise you'll need to provide sources.
---
Un'goro, WPL, Felwood, Hinterlands
---
Thrash is a terrible offhand.
---
I got from the dwarf's belly to between its chest and chin and I can't figure out the next step.
---
Lol, what a bull shitter... you are bs lying. 
---
See, I can also make a useless comment that makes no sense, you arent unique anymore.
---
Blizzard says that is what happened. They never got around to actually finishing the zone, mainly because of the poor ground design. At they felt it was poor, and therefor never did more to the zone and released the game.
---
Blizzards own words.
---
For real, dungeons PRINT money as long as you're not failing massively.  You can make a lot just chain running and getting what comes naturally.
---
phase 4 actually, they were patch 1.8
---
A lot of bots on horde get to 40s range then just camp the shellfish crates off of the Desolace docks. They will just open the same crate over and over again with a hydro staff equipped for underwater breathing, and they always have a boar for some reason. They just open the crate and kill the mob if it spawns, I guess they just have a delete item set up for anything that’s not a blue or shellfish. If you don’t know, 5x shellfish = 55silver and stack up to 20, so that’s 2g10s a stack for free. Now imagine if you went to bed with 5x16 slotters, came back the next morning and had all slots filled with 20 stacks. That’s 76 slots worth 2g10s a piece + 4 slots of random blues worth various amounts on the AH. That’s easily 200-300g a night for doing night but setting up a very simple bot. I always whisper them when I see them “are you a bot? Reply if not or I will report you” it would be usually 2 set up at first but now there’s 5-7 each night. This is a ton of gold being dumped into the economy.

Old Blanchy is the best server
---
Wow Classic has two types of people.
---
Those who thought they did and they really did.
---
And those who thought they did but they didn't.
---
Lotta people who thought they did but they don't lately.
---
I love the idea that the game needs to be patched because of an independent add on but all the massive bugs and other obvious imbalances and flaws are totally fine because not enough neckbeards are complaining
---
More viewers = more subs, it's proportional.  
---
Also, more viewers = more ad money.
---
LF mage tank
---
i think calling him beefybits is more crazy
---
Place totems, pull with lightning bolt, use your favor your shock, right-click, grab a glass of water and come back in 10s
---
So it'll take you a little over a month to get 100g?
---
I get around 30g per hour mining in Burning Steppes (not counting Arcane Crystals and Blood of the Mountain finds).
---
There's no comparison.
---
You';re Horde, you don't need healers.
---
What class and spec? I'm assuming warrior but could be any melee
---
Anything that's not an axe-wielding Orc will call for 3 % more hit from gear, and Orcs get Blood Fury for an extra damage cooldown (and some horrible people use it while tanking despite the -50% healing received debuff, WTF). That is their advantage, and 3% hit is quite a lot.
---
However, you should pick what you want and what you enjoy to play. Taurens have extra HP from their racial and a quite underrated AoE stun - this one is pretty gold and can save your / your team's bacon in many dungeon settings as well as in the open world. Plus, Taurens look awesome! I rolled Troll for Berserking, but sometimes I still miss my vanilla character, which was Tauren. That's what I get for trying to min/max!
---
Did someone say ?
---
I was getting 40-100 honor per kill all day in brm.
---
No. No he really doesn't.
---
What Queues?
---
Wasn’t that just the ingame estimate?
---
If it wasnt a change from vanilla I would agree. The GM grind is so hardcore its terrifying.
---
I never even knew you could right click to add to trade...I've always thought that drag and drop is the only option. Needless to say, I've never accidentally used a consumable instead of trading.
---
There is not
---
Blizzard, please just give access to classic api so we can have some reliable information already.
---
Isn't it bannable to alter Game Files?
---
Considering I've been pvping since honor was released, I've gotten on average 13k honor per 200 kills so I don't think the estimate is the issue. Nor do the 500 kills even show up for Tuesday, it says 6.
---
Your neck beard must be massive.
---
Nothing quite like having a rogue focus you because you're healing just to be able to smack them with a reck bomb
---
Its rhetorical. I'm pointing out that the idea that raiding only takes a maximum 2 hours a week to be complete and utter bollocks.
---
Either BRD aoe/xp runs or LBRS because you need the gear from them anyway. If you can't dedicate so much time in one session, some remote unknown grinding spot out of PvP's way.
---
It's called immersion
---
PcP doesn't imply anything. Do you even know what PvP stands for?
---
Half of the dudes show up after the fight is over. So i just adjusted to click the dudes themselves.
---
I can tell it's not real because the thing has a green face and a white hand.
---
Said no one ever
---
Yeah I have characters on several EU servers that's listed as full and I have never seen any chat delay
---
When I said he tries to kill afk people I meant he usually get killed before, and , as I said, he always hide in the same spots, so people find him pretty easily. He NEVER leaves, and he waste time. He is just rank 5. If you farm honor that way, well I'm gonna wonder what's your problem.
---
Stop calling PLAYER VERSUS PLAYER encounters, "not PvP."
---
4 bindings in 5 runes
---
2 left 2 right
---
Nobody cares about actually raiding a city, it's about never being safe inside a city/settlement.
---
About to hit 48 on my last class then i got all classes at 48, been at nagas in feralas myself since 42. where'd did u grind after that?
---
&gt; Lol, what a bull shitter... you are bs lying.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; See, I can also make a useless comment that makes no sense, you arent unique anymore.
---
fail take.  OP's link now has several hundred posts of players stating they've lost hks and honor.
---
you've also dodged half the bug forum now being honor related issues. delete your account, kid.
---
Just a little FYI:  You should be replying to the person who replied to you, not the whole thread.  The people can’t see your responses this way.
---
Heartseeker is unbalanced, because the morons at blizzard offered unrestricted free xfers off servers that were already unbalanced.  So, obviously the fucking alliance xfered off, which made the problem worse.  
---
The pagle server is alliance dominated because of the name, and the fact it's a pve server.
---
Scarlet Monastery at level 21? 
---
Credibility lost!
---
Its really not. I just did 8/10 MC in 2 hrs. And that includes being really sloppy and slow and tons of mistakes and 1 wipe and people not knowing their rotations. A lot of guilds are clearing MC sub 2 hrs full clear
---
It's AV quest reward. Will be in game when Av comes out.
---
or properly knew about.
---
100% there will be AV bots
---
Horde guards in hillsbrad also have double the HP compared to their alliance counterpart and Orgrimmar has more than twice the amount of city guards compared to Stormwind, valley of strength alone has as many guards as the entirety of SW combined.
---
The devs admitted that they all played horde in classic and as a result, with very few exceptions, every aspect of the game is easier for the horde.
---
Blizzard fucked up, AND you fucked up. You both fucked up.
---
No need for LBRS to get ony attuned. Starting quest is https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=4182/dragonkin-menace
---
The other Culkin.
---
We've had 2 geddon bidings, 1 eye of rag and 7-8 ingots with just our main raid group.
---
According to [ironforge.pro](https://ironforge.pro) Heartseeker is 76.9:23.1 A:H. 
---
I don't see how Alliance having transferred away from there made anything worse, if those numbers are anywhere near correct.
---
How much can I expect Blackvenom blade to sell for?
---
Not exactly. It was about the loot because about what else could a loot system rule be. But it wasnt about the game giving items scarcely and that people were unable to get gear.
---
It was because people didnt get gear because of guild rules. Not the game systems and rng.
---
&gt;And yes, I have no life.
---
Correction: *"And yes, I play horde"*
---
official numbers vs discord numbers vs HOW IT REALLY FEELS in the game means nothing. Your pvp rank means nothing. Only thing that matter is your 1-2h BG queue :)
---
True. Did Crusader even exist back then?
---
Okay. So when I logged off Tuesday night, I had 488 kills. Wed I got near 300. Regardless of the honors it should still show my kills. I have 6 kills yesterday being shown, and 705 honor from those 6 kills. My weekly is 186 kills. Its apparent something is screwed up.
---
can you link it
---
good username, trash post
---
You know a player gives you honor until the fourth kill right? Maybe you killed only the same ppl over and over again giving you always 0
---
That wasnt the case. I barely killed the same person 3 times. Regardless, the kills would still be shown and the honor adjusted, instead of no kills recording and no honor given.
---
well in rag fights, u use more eviscerate than S&amp;D 5 points since theres downtime when u go in and out
---
theres plenty of DPS warriors to choose from, not that many tanks / healers or other classes the guy above you mentioned.
---
They are in low demand since supply is so high, you can pick whoevery ou want.   
---
He never mentioned that a good warrior isn't in demand.
---
Sure bud. You seemed to think it was relevant by mentioning it in the video.
---
Look up some 'evidence' on alliance walking to BRD.
---
This has nothing to do with guard mechanics, by default horde cities and encampments have substantially more guards in place and have higher (up to double) HP compared to their alliance counterparts of the same lvl.
---
Can you mind control somebody, and have them click a mage portal to Orgrimmar?
---
All losing gnomes should be saceificed by melting in lava for better MC drops
---
Okay, let me get this straight.
---
The first guy says that raiding takes at most 2 hours.  The second guy correctly tells him he is full of shit.  Then you chime in, and say the 1st guy is right, because it took you OVER 2 hours to do MC and Onyxia.  
---
rofl
---
WTF are you talking about, it's literally the only game that you could compare to Classic wow and it's next steps
---
These photos are great, you must have a really good camera!
---
I can attest to it. I'm one of the unlucky ones that gets to go flying every time wrath is cast. And I'm a rogue so I basically do nothing, it sucks.
---
2004 quality must be achieved!
---
She's done that since the beginning of classic.
---
What are the rules regarding flight points?
---
This is actually so broken.
---
Imagine alliance being able to teleport to SM.
---
&gt; If a tank asked this before a run started, would you think it was reasonable or that they were being a dick?
---
I'll put you in ignore list and leave group.
---
You’re right, my mistake. When I said “seen” I meant “heard” because yeah it’s not possible
---
This is the problem, people keep ignoring the fact there were many patches throughout vanilla and we are playing on one of the final ones. Talents, items, skills were all different back then warlocks didn't even have death coil until later in classic.
---
This is a single person raid setup not a streamer setup although he may also stream.
---
We're doing mc under the hour and onyxia in about 15 min. Add the time it takes to travel and to gather worldbuffs, maybe we're looking at 2 1/2 hours, but the time actually spent inside the raid is never more than 2 hours no
---
keep up with the times bruh  
---
plenty of people selling spots, some groups do 5x cath &amp; 5x armory in 1 hour.
---
AV bots? I can't recall experiencing that (ok I'll admit that I didn't spend that much time in AV back in the days).
---
What's the purpose of them if all they do is run to the middle and wait to die? Aren't they just helping the opposite faction by giving them honor?
---
Omg I forgot about this..... yess
---
ZF can be done until 51/52. Organized groups can do BRD spellcleave at 48/49 but the average pug will just wipe.
---
Sorry but i'm going to completely ignore the topic of your post and throw here a question that has been haunting me for a couple of days, I'm a total noob on the alliance as i have always played horde, I've started a gnome and i leveled to 20 by doing all of dun morogh, loch modan and the early quests of lakeshire, and well i only have level 25 quests now and i'm just fresh at level 20, i checked menethil harbor and i feel it would be much better to start there at around level 23-24, so any recommendations of any zone i might have skipped?? Or should i just go to darkshore, complete the later quests of the zone and transition to ashenvale? I'm scared it might be to contested by hordes.
---
Dont listen to this guy, you're not always gonna full cycle.
---
&gt;All require you to scan
---
TSM with desktop client does not. Literally updates prices every hour by itself.
---
Twist: You're multi boxing all 4!
---
Neverwing
---
Where's part 3? Did it work out? Don't leave us hanging.
---
He does also stream but yes he’s both lol.
---
These specs do fine in dungeons, it's just raids that's the problem.
---
He is a steamer, this is his setup. Its not a setup for streaming obviously lol. Who would need multiple keyboards to stream?
---
Speedsteel rapier is a good offhand, jsut use it until you get mirahs song.
---
The gnome army, 200,000 units are ready with a million more on the way
---
A good example is feralas, its pretty much impossible to run trough Camp Mojache without aggroing about 10 to 20 guards, but you could have a raid play football in feathermoon without aggroing a single guard just because there are so few.
---
Right now, our guild is using 5 holy and 1 shadow priest - the other healslots are filled by 3-4 shamans and 1 druid
---
Yeah but if it’s from a known good seller account it doesn’t matter. Blizzard can track gold very easily.
---
You sure this ain't a crazy mfer multiboxing?
---
Um that's some issues you have there hun. Might wanna go talk to someone about them...
---
you can enter dm at 10, buy/loot for few runs and get to 15 in no time.
---
you can enter stockades at 15 which is far more efficient. paladins can do the whole place in 3-4 pulls/5-7min
---
I fucking loving it tbf
---
I played an evening of retail with my gf. We haven’t gone back.
---
I played an evening of Classic and were going back every night to quest a bit more. It’s such a different and better game for having actual challenge in the world. It actually has meaning.
---
I would stay stuff like this is world PVP is people do it once, maybe twice. But repeatedly doing it and attacking players at flight paths... that's pure griefing.
---
Depends on the time/crowd. I’d get an azure sash off the AH also for extra movement speed while swimming it should stack with seal form. When I was fresh 40 on my Druid (60 feral tank fully decked w/ hide of beast BP + warden staff and all tank gear from MC now) I farmed my mount gold here. I averaged about 17-22g/hr when I was alone here. Farmed up a good 350g (had Netflix going on my 2nd screen) and bought my mount with some pocket change. This was early game maybe 2 weeks post launch before everyone knew about it. You gotta turn the shell fish into the troll on the docks, he won’t have a ! or ? above his head. He gives you some blood belly fish each turn in that is lvl 35 food grade but can be eaten at level 25. Good for 29 twinks to fast heal or just good level food, it doesn’t sell for much but it can fetch a little extra cash, maybe it’ll sell okay on the AH though. Also, you can get Big Iron Fishing Rod (only way to get it) which is +20 fishing, I believe fishing pole. Sells good on the B.B./gadget AH, sells okay on the horde AH. Only way ally can get it (without farming it right outside a horde town), the horde get a +25 skill pole off a quest but it’s horde exclusive quest I think. Also note, this quest chain is horde exclusive I don’t think ally have an equivalent. Last note, If a crab man spawns just seal and swim away, it’ll de spawn if it came from a cage. No need to kill it, but they can drop green/blue and rarely an epic (super rare) so you can roll the dice for the kill or just swim to the next cage. I chose to just swim around, a good trick if a crabman is near the cage is to just entangle root it, loot cage, swim off.
---
Can do some areas of brd around 50 not a full run but a full group of 50 can still farm some do in there, just gl getting there XD
---
actually that might be pretty handy
---
I don't think that's a bot. It's just how leveling looks like in this game for a bystander. If it's a bot, why did he jump in 0:16? That doesn't look like something a bot would do.
---
How dare a raid group run to MC together for safety. What assholes man.
---
Lmao. Asmongold built his platform on being a toxic elitist, and now that it's clear that hes garbage at anything regarding classic, he just starts screeching.
---
\+ all factions exalted (including frostsabres, timbermaw, ravenholdt, shen'dralar, ect.), rank 14 and 200k gold banked in preparation for gdkp runs in tbc and onwards.
---
Problem is that healers get about 0 reward from PvP. All the Gear you get is DPS Gear aside from R14 Heal weps, so why would someone do PvP when hes only interested in healing or why should somebody whos interested in Healing and DPS rank as healer.
---
Getting the world buffs for ony every week is the definition of tryhard.  Either way, the point is that this is not the norm.   Most guilds doing mc are quite bad to mediocre.
---
Not everyone has a normal day. I'm on night shift, so on weekends, 3-8am is primetime for me.
---
Stop being behaving like an angry little boy and move on. You’re making a fool of yourself.
---
Logitech has it on most of their products IIRC
---
Jesus Christ allmighty. You are very good at avoiding the topic.
---
Do you know what weapon speed [normalization](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Normalization) is? 
---
Read up on it, the page even uses Barman as the go to example, it was once a good dagger, but it fucking blows now.
---
It trivializes open world content. I don't hate Outland at all, and never said nor implied that.
---
And have civilians standing next to them to discourage anyone from coming close.
---
What is this called?
---
Automation is against ts.
---
Just run in the ocean so you die from fatigue
---
Unlike the original good space jam movie?
---
We dont get worldbuffs for ony? We do it with 20 people without consumes and pvp spec. Mc we get worldbuffs because the time it takes to gather worldbuffs is so small compared to the difference it makes in the raid.
---
We used to do this in the past at a yearly lan event with about 1000 attendees, maybe 250 in the race. Loads of fun
---
Botting has always been rampant, but not to this level of extreme.
---
1 button press = 1 action. So yes, you can't use programmes to do stuff for you that is essentially botting.
---
The sub min 30 parses are essentially speedruns that dont matter for 99.9% of the people. They run ten healers because they are chuging pots non stop never stopping and often have full melee dps needing more heals. For a normal casual guild doing MC in 90min less healers is perfectly fine imho.
---
Well when I try roaming around the world at the high lvl zone there are always horde death squads of 7+ people at everywhere I go. Just from my experience it's hard to find solo players and when I do I immediately get jumped on by 3+ people right after so
---
And what do you mean the norm? Sounds like you're talking about pugs mate
---
Do bots respond if you whisper them?
---
I've experienced a 1-2 bots through classic so far than I'm 100% certain were bots, but I had this one experience while fishing in Azshara where I saw a human paladin who was also fishing and his movement was so weird. I started following him around, and his movement was the most mechanical I've seen - it definitely didn't look like how a human would move around a character. Especially the way he he would stop after getting a fish on the hook, turn around (using the keyboard to spin around) and then throw out the line again after a few seconds - every single time. So I decided to whisper him and see what would happen. I didn't get an answer (as expected) so I reported him as a bot. But to my surprise, after approximately half an hour or maybe more he responded. My initial whisper what something like "Hey, what are you fishing here?" and after these 30+ minutes he all of the sudden responded "Crabs" (which is weird cause... crabs? I mean, it was in the area where you catch Winter Squids and Stonescale Eel so why would he care about crabs?). And to make the surprise even bigger, I receive another whisper from him telling me that his wife had played his character and she wasn't good at the game (at this point I hadn't said anything other than my question regarding what he was fishing in Azshara). 
---
I don't know. If he hadn't responded there would have been no doubt in my mind that it was a fishing bot, however, due to the response I guess I decided he was human after all lol.
---
I don't know how bots work. Is it possible that this was in fact a bot running on some computer, and then the guy responsible for the bot came around at one point to check how it was going, then noticed that he had a whisper from 30+ mins ago and responded to me to look like it wasn't a bot at all? I mean, why would he just randomly start telling me that his wife had been fishing on his character?
---
I'm just guessing here.
---
Ah its a 3.4 stealarrowcrossbow
---
buy few cath/armory boosts, get to 30ish fast, grind graveyard to earn more gold for more boosts.  
---
silk cloth vendors for 35s, greens from 20s to 1g(weapon), earn 10g easy.   
---
log in, do few runs, and just log out at sm.   
---
hearth, sell and use taxi service (2-3g) to get back to sm straight away.      
---
as for brd grind, the first ring of jail area has plenty of elites that are level 49-51...which is suitable for group that consists of level \~50.
---
This community man. You are all taking this video game way too seriously, considering that there is absolutely no competitive aspect to it.
---
Relax, realize that a non-confirmed issue that "maybe" makes you not earn honor in the wee hours of the night (When you should be sleeping) is not the entire world. Accept and move on friend.
---
Irregardless isn't a word.
---
That's not the survival talent tree image. Is this a Retail list?
---
i mean scrolling your mouse isn't really pressing a button :P
---
This
---
the areas where guards can gank in IF are out of the way, if anyone goes for alliance between bank and AH they are going to die if not by guards then by the players there. Maybe they can take one or two down with them first. I find it hard to believe anywhere of importance in IF is 'never safe'. same with SW.
---
Instead of killing the adds first, focus boss and let them die to cleave.
---
If you log, the log will stop tracking when the boss dies even if you still have adds netting you higher parse.
---
Luckily this thread doesnt have to do with automation.
---
AuctionFaster has a buyout version of what I'm talking about called "chain buy", but not a bidding version.
---
very immersive to have your came constantly narrated by 'i can't do that yet' and 'not enough energy' mhm
---
You're still performing the action though, that's the part that is key.
---
Back in WotLK me and a few friends would always sit in a separate ventrilo channel, with ghosts in the main raid channel. We'd just meme around on voice chat all night. One of the many memes was whenever a dragon would constantly have to be turned during fights and we'd just go "DRAGON FLIPPIN'".
---
My favourite one though, is this meme about our main tank/raid leader, who would have a lot of background static. At one night where it was particularly bad, someone joked about it sounding like a motor, so this grew to the point where the story was that he was actually raiding while riding a motorcycle (yugioh style), and staying connected by just driving circles around the house of a random person who didn't put a password on their wifi. We could only imagine this person being very distressed.
---
Going beyond 55/45 should warrant a cap, anything beyond that is an insane amount of difference.
---
If the Internet can whine and complain about the pronunciation of "gif" against the creator's wishes, then we get to tell the dictionary to bugger off with an incorrect word. It's "regardless", get over it.
---
But it’s so frustrating when you are forced to heal  a team full of Neanderthals
---
Still dont buy it until proof. I started raising at tbc launch and people were not troglodytes then at that was months apart from your experience.
---
I dont buy it that a human being would wipe for 80 days on rag and not try out slice and dice.
---
They are fucking everywhere
---
Switzerland, Germany, England, Austria, France, Spain it's all really big.
---
Horse have many more numbers and camp searing gorge fps brd. I'd roll elsewhere, ashbringer is a good ally choice atm
---
You are very badass
---
Auto-bidding sounds like automation, no? 
---
Titles can't be edited.
---
Doesn't matter, you're the one that posted this shite.
---
early january BWL ? thats high hopes... :D
---
Sounds good, doesnt work
---
Not to mention you get more of the other loot for raiders
---
Was pvp back in the day but no time or desire for it.went pve and it was the best decision i could have made
---
You would have the same result just buying elemental fire on offdays and selling it tue-thu.
---
Can he not be doing both?
---
Venting and asking for a Change?
---
Can you not be venting as you are asking for a Change? I think they pretty much go Hand in Hand. You are venting and at the same time asking for a Change to not have the Need to vent anymore. 
---
All good tho I didn't expect you to understand because in your simple mind People can always only do one Thing. Vent or ask for changes :D
---
Probably plays a pally... Koekoek
---
Westfall for sure.
---
&gt; My joke 
---
dafuq? you were making bullshit claims, got called out on it, and now we're watching you backpedal hiding behind another bs "it was just a joke" excuse while you dodge hundreds of posters stating they've lost time/hks/honor.
---
and lol at other posters below calling you out as well.  delete your account kid.
---
On your server do the following.

---
/x Hey, anyone knows what  Blackvenom blade sells for atm?
---
Traitor!
---
We get Battlegroups from the start so your thinking needs to be Battlegroup faction balance rather than just server.
---
Wow i didn't actually know you needed that many arcanite bars!
---
&gt; Other than acceptance, the other reason for me balance should be done is in the case Classic+ does not happen ; because at this point, Classic will have to rely on one of the reasons many plays PvE games : experimentation and diversification. I might be thinking about gaming differently, but I'm part of the people that want to try as many things as possible, going from Prot Warrior to Smite Priest while passing by Elemental Shaman and Feral Druid.
---
&gt; By balance, I don't think it should either reach "perfect balance" or completely rework talent trees. I'm mostly speaking about "simple" changes, like minor tweaks on how skills works (like allowing Moonkin Druids to use Innervate), minor tweaks in the talent trees by changing numbers/position of talents, or even add one or two new talents to fix some major problems some specs have.
---
Check out the [off-meta](https://discord.gg/3JXSamG) discord plenty of insightful people in there accomplishing some truly amazing things.
---
&gt; It feels like that guy has brain-damage   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; You are all taking this video game way too seriously   
---
&gt; Accept and move on friend. 
---
How many people are in your head?
---
Yes it is
---
It is hardware wise.
---
But after that he gets 2.5g a day just for one click of a button. It is obviously not much, but it takes zero work. And if you do have a stockpile of cash to play with and buy crystals when ah prices are low and sell around tue-thu you can make your cooldown be worth more than ten gold.
---
Then why did you say:
---
&gt;He is simply talking about a guildie leaving. He never once complained about the Situation himself I think.
---
Yup, you are right! I was wrong! Couldn't find anything when I was on my phone, but went back and looked at the Nightmares Asylum Ragnaros video from way back and there are clearly taunt debuffs on him. My memory was off!
---
it pays itself back, even better than running a normal group too.    
---
the booster gets gold from looting, running people thru (20-30g per hour per person) and any blue boe's.
---
&gt;but nothing you couldn't do with a few friends as well. 
---
Which mean normal players have to divide the profit 
---
&gt;He doesn't get anything just for his money 
---
Being able to do something solo that would otherwise require friends, a lot of friends.
---
More than worth it. Shoulders are one of the weakest pieces mitigation-wise too.
---
It's getting real old having to take the booty bay boat because horde have been camping the other one for 3 weeks now on ZT....and even then there are usually 3 or 4 lvl 60s camping in Ratchet...thankfully I have stealth so it's not the worst, but even then there is usually a hunter wanker freeze trapping the flight master to corpse camp... I'm lvl 47 btw, not even worth honor.
---
Yes. Because clearly you can't do it yourself.
---
as someone who usually does this, i felt like shit last week and got shouted at by my raidleader.
---
worst of it was: i was standing in SoS for 30 minutes before raid started and checked my bags like 5 times, i just got my cache of mau'ri thing mixed up and thought it was that. 
---
rule in our guild is you have to pug it if you forget it one week, lootbenched if you do it again, somehow the pug went okay atleast.
---
Levelling a pally, just hit 6, should I go seal of the crusader into judgement into seal of righteousness or just stick with SoR?
---
Ouch you got me! Ahahah
---
Okay, that makes sense. Thanks for the answer.
---
The % drop numbers you see on various sites represent the chance of each item dropping at all, not their respective chances of ppearing in their specific slots, otherwise those numbers wouldnt match up.
---
She always drops 2 t2 helmets, bag, head and 2 other non-tier epics (out of 8 possible items including the sinew, although I initially thought the sinew was on a seperate slot). Aprox chances as listed on wowhead:
---
* grimoire, ring, drape &amp; collar: each \~30%
---
* vis'kag, deathbringer &amp; shard: each \~8%
---
* sinew: \~60%
---
That sums up to roughly 200% with error margins for exactly 2 loot slots which checks out perfectly.
---
&gt; I think there are just a few tweaks that need to be made for a hypothetical classic+. Prot pallies need a taunt and pally and druid tanks need an interupt (put it far down the talent tree to keep DPS from getting it).
---
&gt; Resto druids could use a Rez but not as necessary I think.
---
&gt; Some less screwy itemization maybe, though by AQ/Naxx they mostly had that figured out as well.
---
&gt; They could probably go a long way in classic plus by rolling some of the stuff from cata just tweaking stuff that references deathwing. I enjoyed TBC, but I'd love to keep it on azeroth this time.
---
Prot paladin don't need a taunt, they can leap-frog threat. Resto druids don't need a rez, there's the engi rez trinket.
---
It's the [attack table](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Attack_table) basicly. With every melee hit, a single roll decides the outcome.
---
&gt; Every melee attack *[...]* has a chance to miss, to be dodged, to be parried, to be blocked, to be a glancing blow, to be a critical *[in that order]*, and to be a crushing blow. Anything left over is an ordinary hit.
---
Yes I am, don't be jealous
---
The first raids are easy enough that it doesn't really matter, but sure, spread it out a bit. Crafted / quest items are great too.
---
Great now we can get to the important task of arguing over word choice. 
---
I was hoping for that.
---
I said recognition was part of it, not all of it.  Stop being deliberately obtuse.
---
Did you try Thunderclap? Was it insane damages? :P
---
what the fuck are you even talking about?
---
Most people, they stream off one pc and game on another using a capture card like an elgato.
---
you'll be a fresh lvl 1 gnome,so no flight points available.
---
I've been looking at that Corsair mouse. Could you compare it at all to the Razer Naga?
---
I think we killed him a few times tonight.
---
terrible.  half the bug forum is occupied by missing honor posts.
---
FIX YO GAME blizzard.
---
I’ve heard a lot of different things about hit rating. Can someone clarify, if I’m a NE rogue and have +5% from talents and +5 weapon skill from talents, how much more hit should I be looking to get from gear? Is there a cap or should I get as much as possible?
---
The one transmute pays for itself.   Saving gold on consumables,  profits on flasks and elixirs are how to make gold.  
---
I was just challenging the assumption that leveling alchemy without herbalism would be expensive
---
The only reason to get enchanting on a main is if you want to be able to dench BoP gear from 5 mans for your group. It's not crazy profits right now and it'a hard to get pubs to pass you all blue gear, but mats prices should go up as time goes on.
---
Not really though.
---
&gt; I just made a tribute Run on my Hunter and took the Buffs.
---
&gt; The Buff "Fengus Ferocity" states, that I get 200AP. But the 200 AP only seem to be melee AP.
---
&gt; So I looked it up and found on Wowhead that it is indeed only melee AP. (https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=22817/fengus-ferocity)
---
&gt; On another site however it states that it should be melee and ranged AP. (https://classicdb.ch/?spell=22817)
---
&gt; Does anybody know it for sure? Or could it be a bug?
---
&gt; If not, why are both worldbuffs(Ony/DM) without ranged AP?
---
It's a subtle hint you should play a melee hunter :)
---
Immune to enslave and fairly resistant to fear it seems. Are you killing by spamming dot/fear or some other method?
---
Fire resistance isn't about taking 70% less fire damage, it's about having a 70% chance to take no fire damage.
---
Just reserve orbs in strat live runs
---
Are you afraid of the nature, brother/sister?
---
&gt; you DONT have a taunt with a shaman.
---
&gt; Yes you have a high treat ability, but its not a taunt.
---
&gt; You might be able to tank if your group is prepared for it, as in let you build treat first, but due to the lack of taunt, im not conident in it...
---
I've raid tanked as a shaman with my guild t'ill Naxx, its more than possible.
---
This isn't new.  Wow has always had a botting problem.
---
They like to make you think that they can detect them but they really can't.  All they do is ban the ones people report and try to break them when they have the chance in patches.
---
&gt; shield slam
---
Assuming you're tanking 5-man dungeons in deep prot.
---
he never said full brd runs? Do you even play classic? You realized that at any given point there people searching for brd arena xp farm right?
---
I have several ideas for the  losing gnomes after the race. Mostly involving them fighting each other, they're so cute when they get all angry and fierce.
---
But what do you say when your holy palas get prioritised on ret dps gear over actual ms rets by your council? 
---
Our ret who has been raiding with the guild since start and didnt get a single piece yet and passed on several upgrades ragequitted completely and deleted his character after hearing that the first sulfuras is reserved for our main dedicated holy pala who already has oeb, crown and both t2 pieces.
---
Yeah but you have to mine, screw that noise.
---
I see dead bodies on the streets of Stormwind all the time. I witnessed two rogues chain killing people in SW flypoint for several minutes before someone realised and called for help. Guards actually do FUCK ALL.
---
yeh, trying to cast doubt to protect themselves.
---
My brother got a new desk chair last year for Christmas. He isn't very happy with it since you can't adjust the back slope thingy to be stuck at like 45 degrees. It always moves back and Forwards with him.
---
I'll get him a new chair today. An actual gaming chair with all Features and even a foot rest! 
---
He is gonna be so excited :D Maybe he will finally reach 60 with his new chair xD
---
We just started doing this as well although we have 2 groups of 25. This also makes the fight more interesting as it used to be way too easy.
---
Just gotta be in voice with your group and get ranged to peel for you. You should be able to survive if locks/mages are doing their jobs with cc/slows
---
Like how does someone think turning themself in will make the punishment less severe? In almost every case the ones punishing don't owe you shit and only care that you broke the rules.
---
Apparently, there is a soft cap on crit where you need more than the 9% hit (as non-orc/human/edgemaster owner) in order to crit more. I think it’s 36% or so, after which you need more hit in order to be able to crit - but this is only relevant with max gear and worldbuffs.
---
On razorgore the factions are rather balanced and the boatfarmers get pushed back regularly.
---
Azshara and Hinterlands turtles. Some yetis in Azshara, I think. I’ll try Un’Goro next at 50.
---
Horde is so much for noobs they actually believe that back entrances matter fuck all.
---
Most of it is ERP or just being really friendly.
---
War stomp for Taurens has a 30% chance to open a locked chest.
---
&gt;good tanks (fury) 
---
No. Fury/prot hybrid build is good for tanking raidbosses when your guild is full of great DDs who push 1000+ DPS and that's about it.  
---
Deep prot is easier to play and more than enough for any current content for an average guild.  
---
Arms is good for tanking large groups of trash (BRD, LBRS, Stratholme) due to Sweeping strikes.
---
Yeah still not interested. You want new content? Fine. You want convenience and quality of life and the like? A game exists with that
---
Pah, wouldn't have happened if you had the Carrot on a stick!
---
/s
---
Please go back to playing your paint drying sim. Shoo shoo.
---
It's been fun to start from scratch here in Classic once more.
---
Making new friends and facing challenges together is the essence of adventure! - though, classic is a little light on the challenge part after a certain point, but hey, at least there is a lot of wiggle-room to joke around and have fun.
---
I think a ton of players thought phase 1 was what a PvP server would be like. Once they realized players will try to kill you when honor is released they lost their minds.
---
Holy priest here, when I’m healing in a dungeon, if I pull aggro and a mob breaks off from the pack, do I run him back to the tank or stand there, bubble, renew and wait for the tank to come get him?
---
It’s because it’s the board I use at home and all my keys are bound specifically for it. 
---
And given I have about half an inch of space in each direction on a plane tray table, the mouse really doesn’t matter.
---
lol - if that floats your boat. 
---
You'll never eliminate its usage or convince people to stop using it though. Words become prevalent, then normal. Whinging about words has been around for a very very long time.
---
Think you are underestimating the human factor, unless you have a dedicated group that levels with you along the entire process.
---
I couldn't find a group that would let me into ZF until 46, and same with BRD until 54, and I was a holy spec healing priest, people were pretty picky with levels. 
---
Stockades feels like it's more effort than it's worth tbh, if you have a wand, you can just stand in a gnoll camp and tab + wand attack while watching netflix, it requires way less effort than  anything else, and is surprisingly fast at those levels, especially if you dedicate an hour or longer, since you save so much money not running anywhere (they respawn before you need to move). 
---
Also, class really has major  importance if you are going  to level through dungeons. If you are priest, mage, lock or a tank, you should probably just spam spell-cleave in the big 3. But since you don't include Scholo/strat, I'm guessing this guide is specifically for cleaving in a dedicated group.
---
Why not? It's actively encouraged in ours and it works a treat. You still need to save your DKP for hot ticket items, there's no point in one class outbidding each other on tier gear unless you're really greedy and can't stand the idea of a fellow class member winning rolls on items. 
---
Hell, we're gonna be funneling hunter T2 to one guy first in BWL, that's technically collusion, but you're hurting the raid if you don't do it.
---
The dictionaries justification is that the word is used by lots of people. You can believe what you want to, but people are going to keep using it anyway. 
---
Gl with your quest though.
---
Warlock scale incredibly well
---
Add people complaining about people complaining to the list then we gucci
---
There's another issue now where honor was updated at 4:30pm and the server crashed. Then at 4:30 the next day honor updated again and all the HK and honor from that 24 hours was lost.
---
ooo freedom call
---
Its alliance dominated and a pve realm. Ez mode
---
Ah thanks. I never used them before just seemed like it’d be nice
---
Not really. Look at the forums. If we got half the crap people want added to classic, it would basically be retail set at level 60. If that is what you want i got news for you. The next expansion has it! Classic is supposed to get us away from the convenience and quality of life and homogenization
---
SGC is approx. 0.8% drop per arena run.
---
AV bots were worse in MoP and I think WoD as well. They acted as a hivemind and all moved together. It was like fighting a 20 man multi boxer that could perform perfect rotation and interrupts.
---
16-20. You don't have new skills, your farming areas are very limited and leveling boost that you get from level 10 skills is already exhausted.
---
Let's say about 3h of raiding. Raid prep like travel time and getting water count as well.
---
Do u not get instance locked?
---
It became a billion dollar company by having slave interns chained to their desks who only know how to ctrl-c and ctrl-v.
---
Fade, otherwise usually move to tank
---
Just an FYI, onyxia is female
---
Whose idea of good stuff though? That is the problem
---
Yeah mby
---
Hold right click with one hand and mash left click with your other. Flawless results (unless gnome)
---
Thats the best thing about the banana shoulders. You're essentially permanently using the /flex emote without actually having to type it. Paladins are all about efficiency.

saw a rank 4 guy with 90 kills total, im pretty sure as well its a visual bug :D

Is your guildie rp walking to the boat? Because you have enough time from the moment you die.

Engineering is **MASSIVELY SUPER MEGA INCREDIBLY OVERPOWERED**. it is super duper mega mandatory as a warrior.

**GET IT**
---
You need 10-11 heals, so 3-5 shaman\paladin, 3-5 priests and 2 druids.
---
AtlasLootClassic, show who drops what in dungeons.
---
Auctioneer, shows ah prices on items and also rewamps AH interface. Use the "Post" tab for selling on AH after installing.

Bagnon, Combines your bags into one bag and you can move the window around. Does the same to your bank.
---
ClassicAuraDurations, durations on debuffs etc.
---
ClassicCastbars, castbars for allies/enemies vital for counterspell etc
---
Dismounter, dismounts you if you're doing an action that requires you to no be mounted.

Extended Character Status, shows actual stats on your character. Like spell crit chance or + spell power.
---
InFlight Taxi Timer, shows a timer when flying.
---
Real Mob Health, Shows actual hp value of mobs.
---
Vendor Price, shows vendor price of items. Also works on quest rewards so you can always choose the most valuable reward to vendor.
---
What's Training?, not really relevant for you anymore. Shows upcoming spells and also their price.
---
We started split raiding Ony a month ago. Sometimes raids with less than 20 people. It's a breeze. Only this week we had some wipes because of strange aggro drops on the edge of phase 3. I thought they would fix it, not make it worse tbh.
---
Yea I try to but I never get shown the same respect, a druid 5 levels higher than me with 8% health runs past and I let him be cause I wanted to kill a fire ele, he heals up then comes and kills me. I show no mercy anymore
---
wow its getting worse then, in before Blizzard call it a "display error" again lol
---
As a healer I strongy disagree. I would take a fury prot or even a straight up fury warrior over prot from the close to preraid BiS gear level and higher.
---
Oh god I thought I was the only one doing this. Seeing others doing it makes me feel less of a weirdo.
---
I really miss all the Skeletons tbh I want them back!
---
Would it be allowed if I built a mechanical android and sat it in my chain to farm honor when im asleep?
---
Grand Marshal 3PO
---
Theres a thread on the official servers about it, they changed the honor reset from classic, the time between the old reset and the new one now is a no mans land of Honor.
---
Wait until more content releases. Farming MC, BWL and both AQs while progressing in Naxx is gonna be pretty time-consuming.
---
theres a lvl 60 rogue bot just farming ogres in burning steppes for like a week on mograine, I go there almost everyday for pvp and run into and kill him several times, he's still not banned
---
Oh no 4 whole abilities
---
yea just like cops are murderers for killing a serial killer :) #logic
---
/join LookingForGuild
---
Considering I am already hit capped, which one is more valuable as a dps warrior:
---
%1 extra hit + 8 str + %2 crit
---
Vs
---
90 attack power
---
The average player was so incredibly bad its hard to even comprehend.
---
I was 12 years old, and I could hold my own against most players, and I had no idea what addons were, I clicked all my spells, I back-paddled, etc etc etc, and I WAS ALLOWED TO RAID, in a guild. As a 12 yo kid who barely spoke any english outside of basic phrases.
---
The community was horrendous. We were so bad that I actually wonder what would happen if they would put the un-nerfed, "impossible" variant of Cthun into the game. I bet he would be an easy kill as well somehow, despite people caliing him mathematically impossibly back in the day.
---
How else do you think they make so many Chinese!
---
He is the largest presence in World of Warcraft, whether you like it or not. If you wanna check demographics he is the best place to verify them.
---
Depends. If by the time you build the android they are recognized as people, you'll be banned for account sharing. If not - for botting. However if you are able to legally adopt it, you should be in the clear as WoW ToS allow account sharing between a parent/legal guardian and their minor children/wards.
---
Thus I would advise you to not bother building an automaton and instead find it in your heart to adopt not one, but 2 Senegalese orphans. You could do so much to change their lives for the better. Teach them love, WoW and g o t o re t a il.
---
My guild is selling priest staffs, every priest in g 1-2 has it. ANd all the alts of main raiders... ...
---
Could be. I think I never saw an arms tank gathering my entire prebis honestly.
---
NO
---
I mean he's kind of fat so probably. The other kids are mean to him.
---
You can skip them with an invis potion.
---
cool and understood, thanks

You can gift subs to people that aren’t in chat..

Onyxia too
---
Is noticing correlation personal offense?
---
Ask the groups who are reserving orbs, and looking for healers. To have one. Normally works for me. But i  mainly made all my gold flipping Dark Runes in the AH. Tues/Wens they skyrocket and i make big profits.
---
Tabard with crying bears maybe?
---
Eating after every mob and resetting after 5   6  pf them would usualy last me 5 to 8 runns. With 1 bar per run, tha makes it atleast 5 bars per session. Takes 45 mins casually so i go there for a quick boost every chance i get. 2 frost mages could do with alot more freezes and can take bigger groups. Did not try that yet but  you could probably do more of them in 1 run before you reset.  Atlease double is needed as the 1100 to 1300 xp is split in 2.
---
this sub is full of Fathers with 20 kids that can barely play 10 minutes each week. They couldn't even get to me because they would've to sit through a 1h queue on my server.

There's a "world server" and "char server".

Say that when the same hunter Ninjas HoJ from brd.
---
Just some quick maths. If the bonus damage from crusader is better than the SoR judgment burst you should do it.
---
Usually when you fight higher level mobs or your weapon is outdated Crusader is better.

---
Hi, admin of Fight Club here. Seems like you've made the one crucial mistake here, and thats COMPLETELY missing the point of the sheet. I'll attempt to explain below
---
*  The sheet will only give you results for what you put in. As such, the sheet overvalues fast weapons, as it can only sim single target DPS. Furthermore, it also assumes you use heroic strike perfectly, which further overvalues fast weapons. 
---
* In a similar vein, the sheet cannot simulate cleave. This means that high base damage weapons are undervalued in this current stage, as they do not gain some of their large benefits - namely larger whirlwind/cleaves, as auto attack and "On next attack" abilities are not normalised, allowing slower weapons to gain a large advantage on cleave during this stage of the game, as you do not have the rage to keep 100% Cleave uptime with a faster weapon.
---
* **Daggers** should not be simmed or taken into consideration during MC, as they have extremely weak cleave. Rage generation is also too low to take advantage of their main strength. 
---
&gt; This is based on the Fight Club discord's dps spreadsheet for fury warriors, using best in slot armor for phase 2, with consumables, without world buffs. 
---
It should be somewhat obvious that conditions here are flawed - World buffed DPS is the most important to compare, due to actually being able to compete while wbuffed. In addition, "Best in slot" armor for p2 entirely depends on your currently equipped weapon.
---
TL;DR this list is very flawed.
---
Do it, get a logitech gaming mouse it has a button that switches between free spinning wheel which you want and a 1 movement = 1 scroll option. Its super satisfying I use the wheel as a fidget spinner when im being impatient
---
Server?
---
Blizzard have addressed the "not enough realms" issue.
---
Newman: Why not just open up more servers?
---
Hazzikostas: We are fairly sure — we can't know for sure without being fortune tellers, but most of them align — there will be a fairly steep drop off compared to that day one interest, and we want to make sure because of how important community is in Classic in particular, that we have healthy server populations.
---
That's why we're not jumping to, hey, let's just open up dozens and dozens of servers. We have the ability to do that. This isn't about limiting costs or available hardware or anything like that. We could do that easily if we wanted to, actually much more easily than having complicated tech like layering.
---
But where we would that leave us down the line is with underpopulated servers that we have to start looking at merging or offering transfers from them to other servers to get back down in population. That's tremendously disruptive to communities and something we really, really, really want to avoid.
---
Some people suggested Blizzard just opened more servers from the start then merge it once people start to leave countering the argument about forced renames after merging with the idea of sharing the namebase between some of them. They don't understand it's essentially the same layers (except you were able to jump between them and share the AH). Delayering is equal to server merging. One server at launch with 5 layers is the same as 5 servers at launch with 1 layer, except for less issues (easier to delayer than merge servers).
---
The only problem could be the dynamic layer size slowly being enlarged from 3k to roughly 6k as the layer amount was decreased. I don't understand why Blizzard won't lower it back to 3-3.5k like it was back then and force a queue on others (with free transfers etc.) since they can easily rebuke all whine with "we warned you these servers are overcrowded" and "#nochanges for server size". Still, when I asked about what people actually meant by "Blizzard drastically increased server cap and that's the reason for all our woes" I got answers from "current server cap is 5x" to "current server cap is 10x", lol, while it's only 2x roughly.
---
Uhm, it's xrealm?
---
Kurinnaxx is great. 
---
Seems like the population evened out a lot from early estimates of being massively horde.
---
Horde are still the bigger faction for sure but it’s nothing like the horror stories I’m reading from other servers.
---
Overall population seems pretty solid as well.
---
Sat the whole evening failing on the ghost waves in vanilla, sat so long my mother came and gave me my dinner at the PC so I could finish the mount quest.. The pug fell apart and I was gutted. In comes 4 other paladins to help me and we oneshotted the waves. I think that is my best memory from vanilla
---
Guy from blizzard team calculated that with vest gear possible, 100%uptime  without making mistakes you couldnt done it. i belive mostly becoz of many many bugs.
---
To be fair, if I was botting, I would be at or near my screen and just doing other stuff, like browsing the internet or watching netflix. Especially if you bot with your main you will probably be careful (fish botting or something...fishing is boring, but if you let the bot script fish for you, you will be 300 at no time investment yourself)
---
Yeah but in that time a horde mage will drop down upon you with the fire and fury of a thousands suns.
---
Blizzcon 2020.
---
Yea i know it’s only 2 BGs, and yes there might be more worrying to do. But since classic has been released they have changed a few things to suit better to the current meta, so i think they will keep doing that until it’s playable.
---
Anyone know if the honor is completely gone or is it just a UI bug? Lost about 30k honor :/

Everyone I know counts them the other way around.
---
Hots are good on tanks but will usually just result in overhealing since most of the time you will have assigned healers on the tank. Hots are really good on fights when there is a lot of raid damage going out like on almost every boss in mc besides maybe garr. So just focus throwing hots on melee id say
---
Honestly, I'd put money on it. Classic progress is already quite fast, they don't need 2 years to see it out. Announcement at Blizzcon for release sometime in 2021 makes perfect sense.
---
oh shit didn't think of that, they took out fullscreen support... perhaps look at the advanced options and switch DirectX version to 9 if it is still supported, then fullscreen mode will come back.
---
DX11+ though and you are out of luck afaik right now.
---
From their weekly standing (if you know the overall pool size), or from rank points gained. Bracket 2 gives from 11k to 12k points.
---
It'd beyond me why they are delaying a keyring of all things... Whoever plans the phases should be fucking fired.
---
And tsm literally gives you a serverscan every 30min to 1 hour through their client. So there is no need to scan yourself, is what i'm saying.
---
What would be the best set to go for PVP?
---
Dude I've been serving for the horde my whole life, in september I leveled an undead mage up to 50 and realized that well, the sensation of been here, done that started to settle as a whole, and i realized that maybe i should give the alliance a shot, to see their perspective, i would say that they have a lot more of fetch quest than the horde but maybe it's just a sensation i'm having lol. Btw thanks for all the replys guys!
---
I know f all about paladins, thank you!

I'm a rogue , i did Ragaros 4-5 times with my guild.

Last 3 down , i died REALLY fast , i never took his AOE but he sometimes targets me and melee me for 3-4k.

I never go in "too fast" after his AOE , and i'm never close to him (i'm never the closest melee)  
---
I read about Ragna, i watched videos, i ask guildies , no idea what to do to make it stop ... please help
---
I like to pvp.. not everyone grinded out 2 level 60s in phase 1 tho. They are killing everyone who lands at flights point even if it is totally an unfair fight.
---
I kinda hate how the classic community is so full of people who don't think about the other player. Which will make classic way less popular and destroy the playerbase/community.
---
You can say what you want but there should be balance. Even if it is a too big population. Both factions have to be able to take over and protecr busy zones for their faction.
---
yeah, we nearly had issues on Phase 3...lost a 3rd of the raid to DB, but got back on track.
---
I think he means, even with this bug Ragnaros is still very easy. Future raid bosses might not be that easy, and bugs can have a bigger impact
---
Let's play the good and fun game of my mana bar lasts longer then yours. Hah, classic paladins.
---
It's north of Camp Mojache, an elven ruin with a single NPC standing there.
---
The stairs down take you to DM East.
---
“Phases aren’t a patch, it will be done on a patch” that was on some blue post I believe.
---
Innervate a priest, combat ress a healer/tank and throw out a heal here and there. If you guys are using loads of buffs, avoid hots.
---
I like the skin dry/crusty
---
To be honest, the amount of whining from players, I'm surprised its not being released before Xmas :D 
---
We seen a blue post saying Early next year, so we believe that'll be Jan. Maybe not, but better to be prepared and have the Ony cloaks for the raiders IF/When it is released..... although it may take a few weeks progression till we're downing Nef.
---
WE RIDIN SPINNAZ
---
It's a reasonable assumption tbh, that's why you're getting all the downvotes. I just don't understand how you can say you make it to brm with constantly 3 deaths Max while playing on the smaller faction on a severely imbalanced server. I could understand if you were a rogue maybe, but using invis pots isn't enough as they have a 10 minute cool down.
---
Have done mara princess/goblin runs as disc/holy. Quicker as shadow
---
You can respec every week to shadow if you farm for a few hours a week enough to respec back and forth.
---
Did this to get my epic mount.
---
Maybe this is an unpopulated opinion but they probably have 10,000 tickets like this that are identical.  It seems unreasonable to expect them to personally type that same information 10,000 times.  Sure they may have typed the wrong name in, but having a form response for a widespread problem seems completely reasonable to me.
---
How did you notice the knockback bugg? Dont melee move away when its coming?
---
yeah i know
---
holy shit that sounds like nightmare.
---
"(ALEX WAS RIGHT)" Right about what? that Classic would fail? Because bots are back and have always been around? well, it hasn't failed, so I don't know what the catchphrase is for.
---
Not really, it's supposed to shame you into activating Windows.
---
Fucking trash company. Blizzard quality is gone years ago. Fresh when?
---
And she gives epic head
---
Maybe, if I knew the long hair on night elves in static I wouldn't have gone with that. But it's fine because I hide the ears with goblin rocket helms (since the only part I dislike is the ears) and that in turn hides the hair too.
---
Can you help me get it working? Most recent ubuntu/wine-stable just segfaults on starting wow/wowclassic...
---
&gt;Because Blizz don't need to change the game to pander to you
---
You mean like they did in Vanilla when they added elite guards to Horde zeppelins when the ganking was the other way around? :-)
---
Wasnt it the case where once bugs where fixed it was downed fast and then just for good mesure they nerfed it to the ground ?
---
kind of.  
---
brd has a vendor and lots more easier/bigger pulls.
---
You need to get that combat adrenaline pumping before you lifetap. It's like a reagent.
---
SM at 43-44 is poor XP you are better off in ZF, and if the guide needs you to buy runs then it's not that great a guide really
---
Damn i'd hate to lose 0.75 kills what a shame
---
i could have mentioned 1 run of gnomeregen too, but gnomeregen and ST are both shitholes
---
Dw fury pve
---
Something lot of people in the WoW community tend to do somehow. Super annoying.

Don't worry it will be all over soon, when WSG/AV release.
---
Thank you very much

Clean and simple.
---
I have 310 dagger skill 
---
If i get them core leather gloves
---
And get 315 dagger skill
---
Does it do anything?
---
\&gt;patch goes out, still no keyring
---
I think the best way to answer questions like this is by using the DPS spreadsheets that are around. It's really hard to say without knowing the rest of your gear.
---
You should be able to find them on the Fight Club warrior discord.
---
Hey, I've grinded my rogues 1-60 in vanilla and then 1-70 in tbc.
---
What you need to get, is that you are your mainhand weapon and that everything else is insignificant. Spend gold to buy MH upgrades from the ah whenever you can.
---
For your MH you're looking only at damage per hit, not dps, thus slower weapons are the norm. So daggers are actually plain stupid, sorry. Aside from that, weapon type doesn't matter. Racial bonus matters at lvl 60 because then you'll fight mobs of higher level than yours. You don't do that while leveling.
---
You obliterate some weak armored humanoids below your level in just a few hits and move on. Don't try to be fancy stealthing around. Just empty your energy with sinister strikes and ideally a mob is dead at that point so energy can reg while you loot and walk to the next.
---
While you have energy, you kind of deal double damage, because your MH swings regularly for white damage and SS is an instant strike in between for pretty much the same damage (that's why it's about damage per hit).
---
For offhand you want it as fast as possible to apply poisons faster, but it's not that important as it was in tbc. No combat potency in classic.
---
Spec wise, 2/2 sinister strike so it costs 40, then get riposte for some almost free bonus damage whenever you get to use it.
---
For dps beyond a few seconds, keep up slice and dice as much as you can. For example in a dungeon group, you start SS into snd.
---
I’ll watch your video tonight! I’m having problems as a lvl 48 to skip the hydra. Is it possible without using invisibility potions?
---
Hydraxion Waterlords represent!
---
Depends how good you are at abusing heroic strike.
---
&gt; stop playing or get used to it
---
You got what you wanted, most people I know just log in for raid and don't complain here. :)
---
okay?
---
The quality is too high for a 2004 phone.

Guess we will see

Vendoring silk for 35 slik. Scrub guide confirm. Get on that slik bandage life
---
- written from a damp basement
---
Yup, but most people rather find a tank immediatly than spend 10-20 minutes searching for one
---
This isn't news most big companies use templates in order to have a consistent response to queries. 
---
This fool however didn't even bother changing the name, which is unforgivable in the world of customer service. People have been laid off for less at my workplace but Blizzard is not really in a position to negotiate quality of service when they fired half their staff and pay peanuts to the rest.
---
Seen some people do it, though it's most likely a visual glitch on my side, like people riding sideways (admin!!)
---
Has an MMO dev company done that before? It would work so well with Classic.
---
You are probably one of those mindless idiots, in a team, farming lowlvls over and over... when you kill the same guys you only get 75%, then 50%, then 25%, then nothing...
---
plenty of people from eu play on na servers, definitely not going to be high enough ping for the race at least
---
I still cry at night from having sold this for 150g.. Im a fucking idiot, and I realized when it sold INSTANTLY..
---
Why is this? I wanted to roll fire at lvl 49 because then I can wield my Eye of Flame. Could you elaborate?
---
In general cast Fade to try to drop aggro and have the mob run back. 
---
But if the mob is nearly dead, shielding yourself is probably enough. The DPS can finish it off.
---
If the mob is no where near dying and Fade didn't drop aggro, then shield yourself and run towards the tank. Helps them grab aggro back and sometimes they might not have noticed. Having a priest appear next to them is odd enough for them to notice that they lost aggro on a mob.
---
Guess firing most of the support staff wasn't a bright idea after all. Too bad we are the ones suffering for it...
---
Would be a perfect fit with some ska punk in the background
---
That's why you play orc female.
---
Snipe heals on MT, get 1# effective healing, a bloated sense of self-worth and all the epics you could ever want.
---
This just seems all wrong 41 at ZF? good luck doing any damage
---
To ad to 4) Nightfin soup specifically is pretty cheap on ah and gives a good bit of mp5. Though I only use food buff for long fights like rag and ony
---
aside from that there is dark runes and demonic runes for a life tap like effect
---
On 5) i like healbot cause it frees up my keyboard for other things, though that may be because half my binds are totems as i am a shaman
---
A general advice is to have details addon with healing and overhealing to see how you are doing compared to other druids in the raid, as well as seeing which spells they use
---
Would it be possible to add a toggle for only counting vendor price? It used to do that until a recent update
---
I don't have TSM, I have auctionator, I tried setting the ahminquality thing to 3 and even 4
---
If people are quitting because they're being killed, PvP server was the wrong choice anyway.
---
I don't

I keep Z, X, C, R default functions. Come at me.

Designated shitting streets don't constitute nature

When I made my first character I briefly looked at all the races and knew I'm gonna be undead and after reading all the class descriptions I knew warlock was the only option :D
---
I feel like im apart of the small minority who spams randomize until it looks alright
---
If I remember correctly every point of weapon skill above 310 only gives you 0,04 % crit/hit but does not: 
---
* affect your hit chance like the first 10 points from 300 to 310
---
* reduce the damage reduction of glancing blows
---
You don't have to store it, just put a date on it, if it dropped befor that date it can't be a Nexus.

I'm using this spec.

[https://classicdb.ch/?talent=#ce0M0xbZgVohthtc](https://classicdb.ch/?talent=#ce0M0xbZgVohthtc)
---
I do tribute runs with it and also raid. 6% less mana is not that much since you can compensate with mana pots/runes and most boss fights usually end in 1:30
---
Hit is overrated, most of the time 7% is enough.
---
Improved wing clip is what usually wins you fights, but i plan on going there once BG's are out.
---
Love how the GM requests you to submit a bug report, you know, as if he has no idea how to forward a ticket to his co-workers
---
Yeah, but just worse xp overall, especially when you get around 55. Lbrs pulls aren't hard either, and I'd say much easier than some late brd pulls.
---
Send video of result plz
---
We keep 1-2 mages per side in P2 - if there are more than a regular 3-4 whelps at a time they instantly switch from Ony to AoEing the whelps down. Slower, but safer.
---
Personally I knew that this was gonna happen but my old guild wanted to go PvP and we're horde on a horde dominated server so it's really not that much of a problem for me.
---
The only true frustration is that it's fucking boring to not have opponents and when I cross the path of an ally, I imagine that he has been ganked a million times before and I don't even want to fight him. 
---
I just don't understand how people find this fun.
---
Hey, good on you. Everyone talks about buying gold is bad but you, an absolute madlad, went out and actually did it. Like an investigative journalist you went out and did the unimaginable on your own accord. You bet everything to bring insight to something absolutely no sane person would knowingly do. Just write a book, publish it online. Tell blizzard you have a book and it was all planned

See you in 2 weeks when you come back and cry about freedomed druid flag carriers. :D

It's a fix for pvpgriefing.

That's honestly a good point. If I had a tank in a rando group ask to need on some unwanted pieces of gear at some point in the dungeon I wouldn't personally mind I was just commenting as a fellow warrior I get it and farming as prot really is a shitty time and sometimes it's hard to get jump run or orb groups ya know
---
A mage surviving my 2,5k execute by getting a heal on the same spellbatch.
---
So does getting 600g in the mail. Both are suspicious.
---
RP servers gonna get weird.
---
Agreed, DM should be a 55+ dungeon.
---
^^fite ^^me
---
Lol, have an upvote you!
---
Touché.
---
You have to check the server you want to play on yourself to answer question number two.
---
Tanks are probably rare everywhere, but that ends the moment you are looking for a raid spot.
---
My server is absolutely oversaturated with healers, but apparently that isn't the same everywhere (and raids differ from normal dungeons as well).
---
Same here ;)
---
I think Blizzard is the only MMO two with a ticket system / phone system and in game GMs where you can communicate directly with staff.  I get that some people say its bad but I wonder what it is they're expecting?
---
We also don't know how the name got that way. They could have been responding to multiple tickets and got the names mixed up on two tickets. People make mistakes. 
---
Or who knows the OP could even have a character with that name and they're just pretending they don't for the sake of making this post. /shrug
---
But there really isn't anything unusual going on here besides a human made a mistake with a name.  I guess it just doesn't seem like a big deal to me :)
---
[This reminds me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oju6cjG3vJM)
---
Sure, I'm just saying that the AH way is far less suspicious than the first.
---
Yea, us, not those fired support people. Perspective, amirite?
---
Trying to make sure you're not a threat when they kill someone who actually gives honor. Also, lazyness, just killing everything is easier than remembering who gives honor and who doesn't.
---
Even 55/45 is 20% more horde, it makes a huge difference.
---
Kill it with fire.
---
so this game is fucking garbage then and blizzard fucked up royally
---
Literally has had the same fate.
---
It now means the same as figuratively or is used for emphasis

I'm organizing a duel tournament in my guild next week. Anything special should prepare for ?

If you're trying to appeal to the Joana market, Joana's paths are soloable. Admittedly some parts are hard due to hunter, but nonetheless solable/small sections skippable.
---
What, you don't like design flaws of  2004? Sorry, the game is what it is!
---
Was actually similar in vanilla, at least on big servers.
---
You're too stubborn or dumb to admit it makes no sense.
---
How bout I make up a word? The word is "irred". It means *the exact same* as the word red, but you're going to start using it anyways..... right?
---
NO, because that would be MORONIC.
---
&gt; The biggest issue by far is the overall number of players on any given server. 
---
Hmm what's your opinion on average number of players online on servers during the past couple of weeks and how is it corresponding to classic. While it's definitely "more" I would like to know your opinion on how much more is it.
---
All eight of course
---
How long does crafting take?
---
While your point stands, this actually isnt the case in OSRS anymore, since people abused it by repeatedly logging to get a low PID. Now, your PID changes frequently even while still logged in.
---
more like g O TO be D
---
Big brain detected. Disenchanting armour pieces has a 20% chance to give essences instead of dust. So if you disenchant some pieces, only get dust and stop you don't know how statistics work and should maybe learn some math instead of crying. It's literally the average disenchantment value if you disenchant enough shit to flatten out the randomness.
---
I dunno, I was done with the place at 55. Just start with arena prison, than anger golem, and do your attunement and save the princess. Worst case scenario you're out at 57.
---
For how ca how long have you been working on it? Is it only killa and beads? Can you gain rep in some other way as well? Turn in runecloth?
---
Good job!
---
Did you have HOJ &amp; SGC at 55?
---
Probably the best server period, unless you dislike overpopulated servers.
---
&gt;2.5g a day
---
912g per year.
---
**PER YEAR.**
---
Just take up mining, go mine around Burning Steppes for a week, and be done with that 900g.
---
Noticed this the other day.
---
Nothing major but because I was on my alt it was noticed easily.
---
3 HK's in the morning at Gurubashi Arena and they were not visible
---
Hanzo dropped on my main last week and the price on AH is around 10G, might aswell use it then. thanks for info
---
&gt; because they have ownership in china, they're a big company now and a  lot of the heart of the dev team is gone so it's down to numbers now. 
---
Blizzard is literally entierly american based. Every decision at Blizzard is made by americans.  
---
&gt; if they can cut spending somewhere and only have it as a minor impact on  us they'll likely do it. a bunch of neckbeards in their basement had  servers that dealt with lag better than blizzard did (literally, watch  the big events on the private servers). 
---
I know that. What does this have to do with China ? Why are you contradicting yourself within the same comment ?
---
I wonder where "12k people online at the same time" number is coming from. Could you please provide your source for it or is it purely theoretical?
---
&gt;They are trying so hard to make it big, but it's not working.
---
Pshero :))
---
Consolation prizes for warriors.
---
Where is the gnome? Racist!
---
Holy priest, zero defenses (unless you count a fear that gets resisted), no blinks, no charge to get me just a little closer each time like some other classes. So yeah. That is what its like.
---
And you're a douchebag for calling people liars, when you dont have a clue what their experience is like on their server. *Douchebag*.
---
yeah making public groups on firemaw in the evening is impossible
---
&gt;  far too many people on the servers 
---
Could you please be more specific, what's your estimation?
---
What ?
---
It's not like it wasn't foreseeable that horde would be at a massive numbers advantage. Given that war mode in retail is a horde only buff, it was pretty clear that many alliance players would be afraid to play on PvP servers, because they actually knew what was going to happen. If you can't handle being outnumbered and ganked, you shouldn't have picked alliance on a pvp server. It was 100% clear that this was going to happen.
---
... and no, I'm not playing horde on pvp. You can stop with your copy/pasted responses now.
---
Dumb
---
gotta pay artists to make more shop shit for shadowlands
---
I got the carapace as well. Please do say more. Is there 8 spawn points or 100 cuz the wiki can't decide.
---
Oh really? Is your brilliant idea to go to MV instead? Like no one else ever thought if that, you 200 iq genius? 
---
Yeah. MV can be *even worse*. Because when you land and get instaganked right at the typhon rider, you then get to run from the GY right next to the horde FP (lucky them) SE a long-ass way just to get to your corpse, so you can begin running NE again. So those corpseruns for the first... 5-6 deaths are very hard to stomach. 
---
And seeing as how most people go run down from TP, *at least* you have the benefit of large numbers of other allies running the same path, so occasionally horde will already be skulling some other ally when you res, so you can get a little further while they're distracted. Running from MV, not so much.
---
You think everyone else are idiots, and they havent thought if and tried every imaginable way to get there as soon as possible? You PoS.
---
Oh. But I just took it to have more +Int for Lasher farming :P
---
Well, if you can't understand simple comparisons, there's little left to be said.
---
Which server do you have in mind to transfer from and to transfer to? 
---
I am not sure there are PVP servers where alliance is dominant, at least in EU. So if you transfer people from one server with dominant horde to another server with dominant horde that hardly solves the problem.
---
Seems to be you whining over people whining
---
agreed. no one like st or gnomeregen unless you're a no life virgin weeb.
---
I agree, it's unlikely the boss code literally sorts by ID. It's more likely that the boss code uses a common library function to get X random players in certain conditions, and that library function is doing weird things.
---
Also, it's not a GUID, why do people keep using that.
---
For raids yes, for general purpose on the class not. The paladin can use that weapon for tanking and its quite useful for PvP. It's also the BIS for paladins until Nefs mace. 
---
In the end it depends on your type of raid. If you put the raid first it makes sense to restrict it to mages/warlocks. But if you want to reward the players for participation and allow for other stuff besides raiding you're letting the paladins in on it. I personally think its harder to keep good players happy then to clear content until Naxx so I rather give out a mageblade to a very good paladin instead of subpar mage that I can replace within 5 minutes if he leaves the guild.
---
idd, not falling for fake scam sales is the best thing gift you can give yourself
---
Don't worry, they will send it to oru developers, then those oru developers will make a fix.
---
Now I know - see you soon
---
No, we're obviously on different servers. And yours is a lot better. You scumbag.
---
If you played alliance you'd know that LFG would crucify you for referring to Deadmines as DM.
---
Ik you’re joking but it’s good to diversify to sell stuff. Cover the different markets. Some people will buy the herbs, others will buy various types of pots and flasks.
---
Broke out into laugher after reading ‘and who is beefybits’ 😂😂😂😂
---
A tip is ZG, lots of stuff you can hoard beforehand+ it’s pretty good in time
---
I'm not stupid, I'm dumb.
---
So subtracting the 16 ap from the 8 str, it comes down to 2% crit, 1% hit vs 74 ap. 
---
Gut feeling says you want the crit and hit, but 74ap is a lot. Would also advice getting second opinions from fight club discord
---
Orcs are more popular for classes that can be an Orc.
---
Pretty much most mages &amp; rogues are UD though, and these 2 classes are very common.
---
Jokes on them because they spent 30 minutes walking you really far, whereas you're just going to spend 5 minutes walking to a spirit rezzer
---
Stop playing
---
15$/mo
---
Nah, I am not joking.
---
or dislike lag and delayed chat, 6-9pm every day the last 3-5 days has the chat been delayed from 5-10min sometimes more
---
yeah I was being sarcastic since the horde thought 30 minutes was a lot
---
That strategy does not fare well against a priest.
---
Warlock can solo many elite quests that even Hunters with BST spec have trouble with. Pretty much all the tough elite bosses are not fear immune so you can chain fear them all with dots ticking.
---
And you're proud of this? Lol
---
Ah, the age-old DM/VC debacle!
---
Escalate the ticket, and reward the honour manually. Like they did before.
---
But you would have the same profit just buying the herbs and reselling those without alchemy.
---
Wat
---
I feel the same, every other year seems to be the perfect alignment between retail and classic. My waifu and I have an agreement - if they announce TBC/Wrath/progression servers were both cutting back work wise and getting on it for a few years to relive our youth
---
You can do the first boss at 49 and all the trash gives around her gives around 70k xp.
---
The whine of the day is you whining about whining
---
Yup, that too
---
we're not talking about diminishing returns. honor kills (in addition to honor) are being completely wiped.
---
keep up.
---
yes it's so cool the game is dying.
---
Honorspy
---
&gt;I am very competitive and I do believe a lot of the younger generation are too soft.
---
They are, I still love the orcs from wc2, however ganking people over and over in an mmo is a different thing than an rts.
---
There is one for classic as well, it just needs to be configured. I am using one.
---
Is it on Curse? I cant find it other than as a direct download.
---
This morning I had a level 60 druid kitted in epics camp and kill me (level 51) about 6 times. I don't understand the mentality of people that constantly gank and camp players vastly below their level.  I don't have much time to play with a baby, so something like this was very frustrating. All I want to do is get to 60, but the grind makes me want to quit.
---
lost you at 3head, post with real English and not twitch speak if you want a response.
---
&gt;When you have millions of accounts, each capable of holding up to 50 characters, with who knows how many tables needing to reference that ID as a foreign key, this will add up fast so you take any optimization you can get.
---
This is false. Yes, you may have to store something like a million (or 10) of these IDs per server, but the impact of that data compared to all the data required to store the character contents is negligible. Just the reputation list will dwarf the size of the ID, never mind inventory.
---
And performance of an index on a string in a modern database, especially if unique, is practically identical to an integer.
---
thats a very good idea.
---
I'm not a saint either, but at least i help the lowbies finish their mobs before i farm them for honor. Which led to one of the memorable wow experiences for me. The dude dinged 60 from the mob he killed, before i farmed him. More honor for me i guess.. 🤷
---
Yes but to a degree. I rolled undead lock but i know orc is objectively superior, but choose undead because its still damn good and looks much cooler in my opinion.  But if i were to roll a warrior or rogue your better bet id go orc.
---
I was actually just leaving to go get it 😢
---
Okay
---
Honestly not worth the time, look on ah for greens ones, if you get a pair with atleast 19 you are good.
---
Asuming wowhead is correct it's 12 runs per bracerdrop, then you need avg 23 bracers for one of shadow = 276 runs.
---
Did you put moar DoTs ?
---
Going as arms is not that bad actually because you will get those sweet 2h weapons that will improve your dps compared to not getting anything vs rogues and warrs
---
We found the Flight Path camper.
---
Just my Friday rant, that's all
---
Pkay
---
&gt; exactly shadow damage bracers is around 0.5%.
---
Oooof
---
&gt;The fir resistance is irrelevant anyway.
---
I've already got greens of +20 Shadow, so really I'm just after any additional stat that may drop.
---
Yeah, killing Azuregos is straight up morally questionable in all honesty. It's the only boss I can think of where the entire reason we're there is to steal his stuff. He's just chilling, protecting ancient artifacts from falling into mortal hands, and we want them.

Not being a dad with 20 kids and 10 minutes game time each week or the 1h server queue part?

Getting rid of the daily quests associated with that faction would be a good thing. They should perhaps have the once per day limitation removed. Meanwhile you can still get the dragon mount for looks, it just never leaves the ground.
---
He’s also the same prick that enforces ninja looting and is heavily toxic and you’re dick riding him.

what a piece of bullcrap

I like to think that 'Beefybits' isn't any one player bit just how this GM refers to people, in the same way that others would use 'mate' or 'bro'.
---
No, my dick doesn’t look nice, but girls still make the bald man cry
---
I would do a questions session on discord to allow people to ask specific questions about items/rules. There are almost always specific niche situations or items that standard rules don't cover.
---
Also might want to do it somewhere isolated (westfall) if you don't want interference/clutter from randoms.
---
If you need to make a judgment call during the tournament (which you will 100%), make sure to be transparent and have a co-judge or two to avoid guild drama.
---
&gt; it's either that or don't play the game... 
---
Or do the smart thing and. You only need to get there once and then you can stay until you gear is broken.
---
Can I ask what server?
---
&gt; And does it really trivialize anything more than normal mounts and roads? Sure you can afk traverse the world but at that point you probably have 80-90% of fp anyway.
---
it removes player interactions. Those interactions can be positive or negative, but by getting rid of all of them, they threw out the baby with the bathwater.
---
I am buying all gold and accounts from wow players..?=
---
Well ofc it is up to you to determine what is worth and what is not.
---
95% of an expansion is spent at max level though!
---
Works well. If there's a bunch of whelps, tank just pops a cooldown or two and picks them up, nearby melees jump in and mages follow. They lose maybe 2 Frostbolts worth of casting, if that, and tank and melees don't run any high risk of death for extended periods of time.

Gehennas

But at least the CEO and shareholders get megabucks right?....
---
Yeah, it crazy how lucky we got :P (horde side) Pop seems to be like 51 horde 49 alliance. Also really full but no queue's or insane lag
---
So I'm trying to do my robe quest as a warlock, and I'm at a part where I have to kill some fire elementals in Arathi Highlands. The place is always camped by lvl 50-60 people and I rarely get any kills. I've only killed a total of 5 so far, but no luck in loot. Is this the ONLY place that I can farm them?
---
Not worth it imo, do like the other poster stated and get greens of the shadow wrath or the sublime wristguards from dmN
---
What you are saying is true. But PvP Sets are not itemized well for healers. Stats suck tbh. Pallyset is for Ret Statwise, Priestset is for Shadow, even gives you bonus on Mindblast not being interrupted, Shaman is for enhancers. All Healers are better off wearing T1 in PvP rather then PvP sets, but why try to rank if there is no reward and you get better PvP gear from PvE. If you dont plan on playing a 2nd spec there ist 0 reward to rank up, if you already know you wont have the time for r14, everything below that is just useless or has equivaltens/better items in MC&amp;BWL.
---
&gt;"being attackable 100% of the time" and "being attacked 100% of the time in a minority faction" are the same thing.
---
Yeah, and that's exactly the problem, they should'nt be the same. Being in a minority faction is irrelevant as you have no reliable information do know if you pick the minority or majority faction on each realm.
---
If you think the current state of the game is normal, meaning only one faction has fun on a realm, and the other one gives up, then sure man have fun at the game. 
---
But don't be surprised if the game turns out to be a dead game in 6 month. At least you're right, seems it's more important than having a fun game for everyone.
---
Someone is camping your corpse? Get good. A group of people is camping your corpse? Gang up.
---
Also: Inflationary use of the word 'harassment' devalues the term.
---
I'm willing to debate. Let me get my queue cards. You start.
---
But löl, gehennas as horde isn't that bad. Just farm in hinterlands or something until you can start spamming brd
---
Even with the low view distance that is a sad server, never seen Org that empty even at 5 in the morning :(
---
I appreciate the effort you put into figuring that out.
---
Why would you play that song instead of letting us hear the chaos on comms?
---
Believe me, i'd love to. Within my 2hrs of play, i need to find a group and complete the dungeons. I work 2 jobs so that doesn't help. 
---
I can only dungeon at night, after 10pm when my partner goes to bed with the little one (little one already passed out by then) it's hard to do dungeons before my partner goes to bed as i help change nappy while shes brushes her teeth and gets ready. 
---
I wish i had the time like i did back when i was 16ish, oh them days of 14hr wow sessions...
---
He is too short, did not make it in the picture :P
---
Is pagle Eu or Us id love to Join
---
It's all subjective and yet you feel comfortable giving casual judgments that apply to all situations? In my mind there's no qualitative difference between 3 camps and 8 camps. It's pvp on a pvp server
---
Gosh, fired for a keyring
---
I think it's stupid that the classes are so terribly balanced in PVP.
---
Mage, Warlock, Shadow Priest, Rogue, Shaman all just pure easy mode classes in PVP, it's fucking dumb.
---
But it's effecting us on PvE servers as well...
---
Netherlizard?
---
Stop putting words in my mouth just because youre frustrated because the game isnt how you expect it to be.  The current state of the game is exactly how many predicted, regardless of hoe I think it should be
---
I never click anything in the trade-window, always drag-drop!
---
The cookbook is aimed at people who don't have much experience cooking at all but love the game's lore, my roommate bought it too and he told me he was surprised to see how easy most of these recipes are. Most of them don't even require that many weird, unique or different ingredients in his opinion. I've had the chance to try some of the dishes, I was pleasantly surprised :)
---
This is a bad move imho. The confusion it creates, especially with less experienced players, is not worth it. Also, there is no reason to immediately use shield. Takes a lot of mana and you don't want to waste it on yourself.
---
Holy fuck the stupidity
---
Levling always hits a wall around 40, and again around 50  
---
Gotta get to 60 to know if you like a class, and you wont fully see a playstyle til 40-50 if youre testing them out
---
On my server there are far more Alliance players. Dont look at this just one way. It takes me atleast 10 death runs every time im doing brd.
---
Yeah, I did something similar with my druid main - leveled as feral and kept some healer gear in my bags.
---
Thanks for the links! The wowhead guide for enhancement actually mentions some nice alternative talents that I think will work well for duo leveling.
---
I think I'm looking at something like [this](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/shaman/-5005202105023051-552053), with the points in resto being highly theoretical, since I might well respec before then. Seem sensible?
---
After lvl 40 warlock wins out, but until then Hunter, for 2 big reasons:
---
1. Aspect of the Cheetah
---
2. Warlock's prime leveling spec, draintanking with succubus, does not really take off until then (when you have dark pact)
---
Wait.. that's illegal.
---
40/60 sounds like a stretch tbh, these numbers aren't confirmed anywhere either afaik
---
Theres a drop down menu in the launcher where you can swap to retail.
---
Is there an xp range in dungeons? Or can you park a character at the entrance and then have another 60 just do the dungeon?
---
Or would the boosted characters have to follow him?
---
No, they haven't had an actual client patch. Everything they've done has been a server change, like enabling world bosses, dire maul, PvP system.
---
Farmed 15 k honor the other day and lost It due to the honor bug
---
The down side for Horde is much less honor. If you group up with 4 decent PVPers, you bet your honor/hour gonna outweigh any hordes on that server. Pick stranglers, as they all think they are safe.
---
These comments remind me of comic book guy from the simpsons being extremely picky about the models in his nudie magazines.
---
Calling someone an idiot and then ignoring the whole part where even if you kill people with them giving 0 honor still counting as an HK. Smooth
---
You shoot shazzrah in MC and onyxia in phase 2
---
Well i chose a Pvp server as that's the only thing i will be doing at 60. I have no interest in Raids (mainly as i won't have the time). Not going to lie, it all stems from being jealous that i'm not 60 yet. 
---
I wont mind getting ganked at 60 because, well, i'll be 60. 
---
Back in Vanilla i was on a Pvp server (Drak'Thul, cant believe i remember the name) so i do understand how it all works. I'm just annoyed that i'm not 60 yet (my own fault, no one elses).
---
It took a looong time for that simple bug and Activision didn't even address it
---
Racials &gt; Aesthetics
---
Oddly specific but ok.
---
I mean that's essentially the same thing tho..
---
I probably spend far too long on the character creation screen. I’m hella picky about the way my characters look for some reason.
---
It's pretty easy.  Keep the useful players happy.
---
&gt;Do you dispute that current servers have higher pop caps? Upwards of 10-15k+?
---
Yes, of course. After all, what Blizzard say contradicts this statement and census data contradicts this statement as well. 
---
&gt;Have you seen screenshots or testimonies on release day of queues of 15,000?
---
Yes, I have seen it. A queue of 15000 players means 15000 players are over the server cap: it doesn't mean the server cap itself is 15000. However, server cap back then (at launch) was roughly 15000 indeed. 
---
You understand server cap is directly proportional to the amount of layers on the server which was reduced then removed completely, leaving each server with 1 "layer", right?
---
Blizzard has stated 1 layer was roughly equal to 1 "vanilla server cap" at launch, they have also stated vanilla server cap was around 3000 (2.5k at launch, 3.5k around naxx).
---
They confirmed they slightly enlarge 1 layer cap when they removed layers.
---
Current situation with 1 layer par server (delayered) is something like 5500-6000 players cap before queue kicks in. Most servers have concurrent online of 3500-4000 players. Nowhere close to 15000 boogeyman.
---
haha, weird to use language so jokingly in such a serious matter doe dont you think?
---
Horde bg queue times will be 30+ minutes.  
---
Big downside there...
---
Girls is a weird name for a hand.
---
The 13% range speed increase from a quiver also scales the cast time of Aimed Shot.
---
To transfer where though? I don't see any PVP servers at least in EU where Horde isn't dominant.
---
&gt;sick flips
---
i've seen them, yet i've never done them myself. How to? If it's "only" a crit on evis i shouldve seen it by now...
---
yeah, just got a logitech mx anywhere 2s, works great. scroll maybe once every 4-6 seconds and im spamming auto attacks while that's happening, so i guess my problem is solved
---
Tagged you as beefybits , you are welcome, beefybits

In a week we are reading a new topic where he was dragging a stack of flask when the trade was canceled and he accidentally deleted them.
---
I definitely know better than that.  HoJ is not "just a shitty blue" though.  It's a well known excellent trinket that is frequently farmed for by melee classes.  While it has AP on it, the hunter DM trinket (which you can basically buy off AH) is more than twice as good (for us).
---
create a macro and put it somewhere on your bars you have hotkeyed
---
Watch netflix or youtube or something on a 2nd monitor if you have one while hitting that key every other minute.
---
Give up after and hour or two of no response or get lucky and get invited.
---
There is nothing wrong with an incremental GUID, they are still unique but offer much better performance.
---
By up to 100'000 % rofl! This "guide" is bullshit !
---
You have to stay within range but it’s pretty big. It also depends on the layout of the instance. SFK for example is stacked on top of itself and isn’t that big of an instance. I had my buddy hang out in the courtyard while I killed the final boss for him.
---
no, but its not like that takes more than 15minutes max and if it does its some serious mismanagement.
---
This small indie company has no money to hire GMs, what are you talking about.
---
No you just bind one spell normally and then use the same bind for a clique shortcut. It means that you use the normal spell unless you press the key with your mouse over a health bar. 
---
A quick exemple, pressing E makes me holy nova, pressing E on a health bar makes me GHeal. And then i also add downranks on the same key with alt and so on but that's another story.
---
Lol you’re stupid.
---
If the group is still progressing through MC, you should bring a hell of a lot more mana potions than when the raid is on farm. 20 major mana potions should cover you for an evening.
---
Firemaw horde here, if you want to level or do anything in the open world, be prepared to get ganked every 3-5min buy a group of alliances
---
Oh, well thanks for telling me. I guess i underestimated macros and it's really preferences. I didn't bother diving into them since it's pretty opaque imo.
---
Bro they don't look at bug reports at all
---
It feels like there is only a matter of time before more people quit wow, faction inbalance on servers to get worse, where Blizz will have to give faction specific transfers on servers. Because it’s only going to get worse.
---
Similar thing on my server, it’s just that horde player tend to be more pvp oriented since the race are more  pvp oriented. On my server thorium point is hord camped 90% of the time. There is the occasional Ally raid that unlock it for 5 minutes
---
What holy server have you found where Alliance leads in numbers? Heartseeker?
---
This works unless you're on a pvp server and the dominating faction is also the opposing faction (controlling those elementals basically all day). If you're in that situation, it can take a long and frustrating amount of time.
---
Some people get their highs from goals, not from the journey. I farmed Gold for 18h just to gift an epic mount to a good friend. Did I enjoy the farming? No, just the lets play on the second screen was good. Did I enjoy the moment my friend finally got his epic mount and lost his shit over getting it from me? Hell yeah.
---
No it isn't. What sort of elitist bubble do you people live in? Most people don't fucking play like that.
---
This caused me to rage quit last night, I have leatrix plus and I was doing ZF farm, some level 30 something warrior whispered me "Inv" then left the group, I bucked it on my epic mount towards the exit and got to the hut before TP'd to fucking Kargath.
---
KARGATH.
---
I'm with you, I like BEM, and I think it had a pretty cool progression through the zone when you're levelling (i.e. no flying).
---
Going down into the valley with the orges, through the mountain to the night elfy bit, the demon pit with the cannons, and the big plateau near Netherstorm with the elementals and consortium. Cool theme, cool zone in my opinion.
---
I'm just curious, but what makes you think this was a simple bug? Have you worked on their code?
---
Sounds like jagex
---
people need to be thankful for what they have instead of what they dont have.
---
By allowing them to become less useful? Or by making 4-5 other players less happy by doing so?
---
If the best way to keep your guilds healers happy is by funnelling them dps/OS gear, then they're not really dedicated healers.
---
Nice crits, may I suggest the shaman blue addon. Don’t wanna look like a paladin right
---
Yep apparently it's happening to many/all players and you aren't getting it back, sorry :(
---
and a rose by any other name would smell as sweet   
---
not to mention my client definitely has had to update classic at least once, i remember seeing the \~150mb download and thinking "oh i wonder if this is keyring"
---
Countless posts just like this one if you scroll down. Based on someone posting a GM ticket response, there's no way for them to manually add in kills/honor. 
---
Suggest you submit a ticket anyway, as well as a bug report. Happened to quite many it seems.
---
I sell greater fire protection potions on my level 5 bank alt because GFPs have a level requirement so my bank alt can’t used them accidentally.
---
I think this list implies being carried.
---
[These are the only reliable numbers anyone has, based off census data.](https://ironforge.pro/servers?region=eu&amp;filter=true)
---
I think its hard to predict BG queues. But, knowing LoL queues, anything over 5 min is already long. But those matches take longer. How long does a BG match take? 15 min?
---
Where is the human?
---
Fair points, so it's pretty situational; but more or less warlock and tag multiple mobs and Hunter is more single target?
---
Ya that’s why it is what it is most alliance won’t even fucken pvp on a pvp server I wish I was alliance y’all get to pvp in any city you go to horde rotate around the map just to run into more horde
---
That math is confusing me
---
Didn't you know, he's one of the original game developers who reverse engineered WoW on a perfect copy of vanilla with his super private server.
---
This is why I quit WoW, assholes like you. It'll eventually all just be assholes like you talking shit to each other, at least theres a place for all the losers to hangout.
---
Wow thats amazing
---
🦀🦀🦀JAGEX IS POWERLESS AGAINST WOW REDDIT🦀🦀🦀
---
Back pedal into click your portrait to shield yourself true combo he didn’t want none
---
The GUID targeting is probably a fail-safe used if all-else goes wrongs with the boss scripting.
---
I'm never gonna farm sgc (limited play time) . HoJ I had it on my second angerforge kill.
---
You're damage is the just based on your weapon and your attack power.  
---
Stats will give attack power based on which class you are playing. 
---
1str = 2 ap for Warrior / Paladin
---
1str =1 ap and 1 agility = 1 ap for Rogue
---
1agility = 2 range AP for Hunter.
---
Agility will also give an increase chance to crit and dodge (values depend on level)
---
Therefore, as a warrior you want str gear. If a piece of gear has 4 str and the alternative has 9 AP - you're better off with the AP since (4x2) &lt; (9). 
---
Most warriors prioritize Str and Stam, however, there is a school of thought to get more Agility (crits give more rage) and more Spirit (less downtime as health regens faster).  I personally like Str &gt; Spirit &gt; Agil &gt; Stam. 
---
Green numbers are always from buffs / gear. As stated by others, you probably had onyxia buff.
---
Blizzard is to blame here. There were to few servers (both PvP and PvE) to begin with. Layering was a mistake. Population size was a mistake.
---
They should just post numbers for all realms and open free (or paid) transfers to other PvP and maybe new PvE realms.
---
Communication from Blizzard is really bad.
---
But nevertheless, who thought it would be a good idea (who previously played the game) to start on a PvP realm without being able to reach 60 in a week and clear MC/Ony regularly by week 3? Were they really expecting to not be farmed by overgeared people? That it would be fair?
---
I have a horse brother too
---
isn't this the reason we were all excited for classic? I'm confused
---
It depends on a lot of factors:
---
* How much total crit do you have in both scenarios
---
* Do you use full world buffs and consumables (which can get you critcapped)
---
* Are you DW or 2H
---
* Are you horde or alliance
---
I do that too. Spam randomize until I see something I like, adjust maybe one or two things, and then spend half an hour agonizing over the name.
---
That's what I do sometimes. Then change beard and done. Or in the case of female trolls I change the face to the happy looking one.
---
lol, i was eating my kitkat dude !
---
is it meant for battlegrounds or something? i'm doing horrible as holy in world pvp
---
Thank you :)
---
ill take a look at the addon, though i kinda like beeing pink again :X
---
&gt;**Due to faction imbalance, there is no downside to Horde playing on PvP servers** 
---
Yes, of course, it was very well expected and obvious even before launch: this is exactly why most people keen to play alliance rolled on PVE servers and other people who rolled alliance on PVP despite all warnings had it coming. Why are you trying to put it like some epiphany? Water is wet, fire is hot, duh.
---
Bubbleoseven
---
This is not entirely correct: 5 weapon skill does not give you 3% hit. It reduces the amount of hit you need **against a level 63 target** by 3%
---
There isn't. Most people specifically choose PVP servers to be dicks and screw with the other faction, not just for "the danger" or whatever horseshit they spout out about why PVP servers are better. It's 100% a people problem and has no fix because people use "PVP server" as an excuse to grief since it's allowed. 
---
You want to look at what led to war mode in retail?  Exactly this. Everything people bitch about now exists entirely because of people:. War mode, LFG, LFR, personal loot, class homogenization; you name it and you can pinpoint why it became a thing thanks to people's behavior.
---
There are no new developments at this time.
---
i was a druid in vanilla and i had the worst luck ever. To the point that they (jokingly)  said they invited me so that no druid gear would drop and they had more chance on theirs.  
---
Now i'm a priest and at level 56 i already won my T1 pants and T1 gloves in my first pug MC.
---
Turn on auto self cast (:
---
+1 to that. Was on everyday before Honor, now I log on only for raids. Slowly running out of money for mana pots, can't go anywhere for gold.
---
Don't think BGs will fix this either. They'll help a bit, but the servers populations are still far too large.
---
Why the fuck does this matter again? If Alliance can gain more Honor per hour than the horde, it doesn't benefit them at all. Maybe you don't know this, but the Alliance are competing with other Alliance for Honor; not for the horde. A target-rich environment makes it harder for Alliance to rank because the upper brackets are more competitive.
---
Who besides pugs arent clearing raids sub 2hrs?
---
generally get as much stamina and spellpower as possible, but as Xari said 5/8 T1 is really good.
---
well, his name is Beefybits from henceforth!
---
Did they really so? I accidentally sold one very important item and was told that it's not possible to manually restore items if it's sold too long ago. But I clearly remember that happening quite often long ago in retail, so I guess they just gotten very lazy with their support.
---
dungeon tanking vs raid tanking:
---
dungeon tanking= the idea here is that you want to mitigate damage from party members, not all the damage but taking the big hits and not letting people drop below 50-75% at any given time.
---
always use things like nova or snares to avoid damage while landing threat building skills on targets of interest. pool rage for things like disarm if you don't have the time/can't get agro/does tons of damage.
---
always face mobs, position so you can grab mobs that run off,  stagger and/or group accordingly  for what you are killing. line of sight is the best tanking mechanic which includes mitigating damage by taunting something that will cast and running around a corner during said cast.
---
1-2 mobs open with instant damage as dps focuses one mob down. either use revenge/heroic/shield slam on second target.
---
3-6 mobs open with demo shout, before anyone hits anything you will get a chunk of rage from being hit, using this rage sunder and revenge the highest melee damage mobs saving revenge for anything that turns to hit something else as a trigger key, if revenge or shield slam isn't cutting it then drop a taunt. if you are confident you can equip 2h weapons mid fight to land a bigger heroic strike/cleave on a target keeping in mind your healers mana and the damage you will eat. if you have a shaman this is very useful as 2h weapons doing more damage will generate far more threat.
---
on large groups it is ideal to use line of sight, leeway, any sort of snare skill to mitigate group and self damage taken. healer mana is the biggest factor in dungeons since you can keep going if there is enough mana in the pool.
---
raid tanking= objective here is that you eat all the possible damage while generating more threat per second then the dps in your group.
---
move mob to designated spot, get rage, sundering at about 20 rage.(storing extra rage is important to fish for shield blocks and revenge procs) shield block rage is important due to back to back critical/crushing hits. revenge generates the most threat at the cost by a long shot while shield slam does great work it does require a good pool of rage to use. most raid pull agro issues are solved with a rage pot. this is not ideal because they get expensive if you are blowing pots every pull so dps can link meters. 
---
while most tanks will simply dump rage and still maintain agro or spam shieldblock and do just fine. some bosses hit hard enough to nearly global a tank in 1-2 seconds even with 6k hp. knowing this you can sit on shieldblock for those times where healers need that extra second or 2 for their heal to land. alternatively training healers to all stagger their healers in sync works great as well.
---
&gt;But they can and they did.
---
Source on them adding missing honor? I too have screenshots but am currently very "fuck it, don't care", but if they're adding it back i'll open a ticket.
---
shaman with a sword? wow much
---
More like the good players found they have something better to be doing with their time. Whether they're MMO focused or competitive focused. The only people left are no-lifers who generally have limited ability.
---
Thank you for the tips! I'm probably gonna take the enh points first, but I'll keep these in mind for higher levels. We'll see how the wPvP situation looks by then. :D
---
I have been killed by Allience on Firemaw the last 2 times i tried to get into Molten Core, lost Onyxia + Dire maul buffs which does not feel great
---
They def use to be able to restore whatever they wanted whenever. During BC raid progression in kara half my guild had to restore their luffa trinkets.
---
Definitely Jump runs. Try to get 1 or 2 mates to do them. If you are fast you can do like 4-5 runs per hour and thats at least 8 rich thorium, even more if you are lucky because there is a chance to have 3 per run. No way you will mine more in the open world during one hour.
---
This is why I think DK should also be applied to killing players below a X amount of levels to you. Prob won’t stop everyone but will slow it down
---
I have to have my character looking perfect but I don't reroll afterwards
---
Yeah, i figured
---
That just makes Alliance players quit the game. Not a solution.
---
Yes, the "best guilds" had everything figured out, but that was the top 1 or 2%. The majority of folks didn't fit into that category. Random PUGs now might have 30-40% of the group being as knowledgeable as the top guild leaders back then. Many casual players today are every bit as good as the alternates in the top guilds from 15 years ago. My guild is far from "hard core" and will not be challenging for any world firsts (or seconds, or thirds, or 11ths, or 23rds), yet most of us come in with all the buffs, world buffs, food buffs, pots, etc, and are hit-capped, and know the right rotations, specs, strategies, etc. The "we" in the phrase "we're smarter than we were 15 years ago" means the population in general, not the officers in world first guilds.
---
Blessingofmite
---
Yeah, that's what I'm scared of too. I think especially horde rogues will keep ganking outdoors. Most servers are horde-dominated so horde will have queue, and rogues make more honor outdoor than any other class, maybe even more than what they'd do in bgs. It's still going to be camped even after bgs are out.
---
Yes I think its BM - but mostly because of the risk of needing on something some else actually needs. That and everyone there needs gold for one reason or another.
---
You have tons of ways to farm gold. 
---
You are a prot warrior - just tank live strat for first orb. It's effectively the same thing, but more accepted. 
---
Do DME jump runs since you are herb miner.  Just find a healer/mage (bonus points if enchanting) and split the profits. 
---
If all your mining / herbing is going to guild.  Have them buy it from you at 50% off (black friday sale).  Or have your guild fund repairs since you are donating so much. (sounds like they are taking advantage of you)
---
Spend an hour or two running around herbing and you'll make 50-100 gold. Especially herb mining combo. 
---
I'm a holy paladin, I wear plate too. I can't kill shit (well I can because I have alternative sets of gear).  When you die as a tank, I die. And I have to buy mana pots / water / consumes, just like you do.  
---
Also build a farming/dps set of gear if grinding is how you want to farm things. Even prot spec you'll be able to kill.
---
False. All MC bosses are immune.
---
it's perfectly reasonable really.
---
it was my fault I forgot, I would have wasted atleast like 4 minutes with summons and getting them to do that for 20 people if i had summons and like 15 minutes (we were at ony entrance when i forgot, surprise) for 20 people if i had to run.
---
if someone is silly enough to waste a collective 40 minutes at bare minimum to 5 hours collectively of your raid, generally you want to stomp that out pretty quick. 
---
i forgot it, my fault, no-one elses yet they would have suffered for me forgetting.
---
You forgot the last one:
---
People whinning about the whinner, we see them every day as well.
---
Rest of leveling? At 48 you can grab Warden Staff and that's BiS forever
---
That´s lame, back when I was a GM at the end of classic we just needed to use %n instead of the name in the template answer and the answer would already include the correct name. We also couldn´t change kills or honour though, so the answer would have been the same back then XD
---
Mate, right click your raptor so you get an extra bag space for more materials!
---
Um, it does matter if it gives 0 honor. If you are only looking at kill charts then there lies the problem, as I said
---
ST is tons of fun and it's amazing xp/$$
---
Deadmines @ lvl 10 ?
---
This list is only for healers i guess cos dps/tank cant hit anything..
---
I'm currently leveling a warrior solo. 1-30 is the bad part, warrior has alsmost no instant abilities and you just wait for the mob to die. At 30 you get sweeping strikes, at 36 whirlwind and at 40 mortal strike. This is where it gets interesting. If you manage to keep him decently geared, which shouldn't be a problem when you run dungeons together, he will just slice through mobs lower than his level. All you have to do is top him off now and again and he never has to stop killing stuff.
---
I would go full resto and just smash things.
---
To be used in a raid.   They aren't profit, they are farming our consumables.
---
    &gt;  you still have to allow people to enter their own name. 
---
Isn't something we have now? Seems it does not work well for an RP server. What I propose is a race specific random name generator at character creation screen, which allows infinite amount of attempts before your actually are satisfied with the name and create a character. This is something people have been using for quite long, just with the third party name generators. Also, a significant amount of good names which I see on RP realms look like they have been created via such tool.
---
This gives me Windows 96 vibes
---
He doesn’t only attack mages. Also if he loses in a 1v1, he shit talks you and tells you how bad you are (on his alliance account). I can’t tell if it’s sad or funny.
---
This suggests Elemental Mastery is more desireable than Nature's Swiftness.
---
*hacked*
---
Thats my problem, how it would work? I pay X amount to the rusher plus blues? or all loot? hm
---
The person I was replying to said  
---
&gt; Farming is awful as a healer too and you don't see us asking for extra stuff to make up for it.  
---
Getting dark runes while others pass is exactly that.
---
Because they don't need or want to fight constantly. My guild farms EPL in small raid groups, so it's easy enough to get consistent honor when they're unorganised, but as soon as they've had enough and just want to get to Strat, you better believe they'll come in hard with 20+ players and wipe us. Know what we don't do? Make Reddit posts. We acknowledge they've won the fight and wait patiently until it's safe to rez, then fight back.
---
The fact that you think "give up and stop playing for a few weeks" is the appropriate reaction is precisely why there's so many Alliance players bitching and moaning and allowing the Horde to dominate their servers. You all just give up. Faction balance is *not* as important as having organised and skilled players. See: every video of APES absolutely wrecking raids several times larger than they are. Yes, there's extreme cases where the server is 70/30 and it's significantly harder but that ain't what OP's talking about.
---
Uro developers.
---
If RP isn't a problem, you can consider the RP-PvP server. It's considered balanced

Gutgore/Distracting combat daggers for raids with T2 helm.
---
16-12-23/14-14-23/21-8-22/16-8-27 depending on your playstyle and how much %hit and crit you have. If you re hit capped and have 24+% crit go with the last spec.
---
Swords are just for noobstomping in pvp and suck vs good players (hemo) and combat daggers beat combat swords in dps in raids if you know what you re doing and have the buffs you should have.
---
Of course they get their own entrance.
---
Are you really moaning about firemaw Lol, every time I’ve been to BRM recently I’ve been relentlessly hunted by raids of alliance players... don’t see me coming on here and whining. The alliance are much more organised on our realm which evens it up and the balance isn’t way off 50/50 unlike some realms
---
thats why you play a dwarven paladin and simply shrug off whatever their rouge does
---
ST is trash
---
Thank mr obvious
---
Ok then, but I hate orcs too. Freakin 90% stun resist :d
---
We had a druid in our guild while working on C'thun who couldn't move and heal at the same time. Never had to learn movement or positioning, so he never learned. 
---
And on C'thun you gotta move because of the laser. However, he couldn't, so he didn't. Our strat literally became to put this druid to spam heals, blow all his mana before the laser, which is when he'd die without attempting to move, then we'd battle res him. 
---
It enraged me, but guild master's friend or something.
---
Upvoting in hopes it'll reach the top and help people understand why "Alliance" is important in the title.
---
Funny, when I asked this I got responses saying I deserve it for *camping FP in a raid* .
---
His goal was to make you mad. 
---
He succeeded.
---
welcome back :) lovely to have you back !
---
Bobmastic
---
The corsair one has bigger buttons and feels more solid than the naga imo. 5 years of using them and I only had to replace one because of a faulty left click which was probably just because of frequency of use.
---
not on my server, anyone boosting wants ~2-5g a run depending on what you're doing.
---
cheapest i've seen long term boosters ZF is 2.5g/run and SM cath is 2g a run.
---
I'd would absolutely love, LOVE to level a warlock. But the first 20 levels of warlock leveling feel a little dry compared to other classes which sort of plateau around the leveling teens mark, which is a big problem I have atm. Are there any Bomb ass warlocks that can sell me the amazing power of their class's past the inital leveling process? I want to be evil from now on
---
Absolutely they matter.  
---
I try to make my character as ugly as possible.
---
How are you critting 100%
---
It happens either way, I tried. I think your bodies position is what matters, not your spirits position, so it wouldn't bring you back like I thought.
---
You should stack the boss and his adds for cleave damage. At the very least stack the 2 adds. You wasted a lot of time by having to kill all 3 individually.
---
The single target damaged also seemed quite low, why was this?
---
World of Roguecraft was actually a valid critique in the first one. 
---
By the third, though, it was just keyboard turners fighting against a super-skilled rogue using all his cooldowns and all possible consumables (usually twice).
---
Right, but it's irrelevant to the point that the OP is talking about.. if they had X number of hks and then later it shows that they had X-Y amount then there's an issue.
---
Everyone has something better to be doing with their time other than playing wow. Wtf are you on about ?
---
As long as people have fun on this game what else do you care for
---
I have no idea where you're getting this 40 minute number out of man. You would have got a port to org from a mage, got a summon from a lock and been back in under 2 mins. I know, because we've had this pop up once or twice in our guild Ony Runs.   
---
I don't know why you think thats normal, but a guild master that shouts at you for holding people up for less than 2 mins is not someone I'd ever want to play with. I didn't realise this happened with other guilds, which makes me wonder how low people's expectations of civility are compared to that of my guild.
---
Is there any way to legally use a macro or addon to reel in your bobber while fishing without having to click it?
---
I roll against mages all the time for my dark runes. What other class needs dark runes?
---
Warlocks can Life Tab, and oomkins don't exist.
---
Golemagg-EU is okeyish if you want to play on a pvp realm. Horde outnumbers alliance but alliance is more organized and has more decent guilds. It may be a good server on the long run once the pve contents becomes a bit harder (ie, cant be pugged by green geared starters) which the alliance can take advantage of.
---
A haha okay, keep making loses and leave all profits for me then
---
Or he is bright realizing this is their game and they can literally change anything about it that they want.  He responded by saying I have proof of the error and expect it to be corrected.  This is a standard response you should use when you're told no by a company unwilling to fix their mistake.  You'd be amazed how far you get, in general, if you push past the first no/it's impossible.  
---
Nothing is impossible for them.  They just don't want to do it.  It's very different.  I'd read this more as "As a support ticket copy and paster specialist, I'm not able to manually change honor values" than a "It's impossible for us to fix this mistake".  
---
Also if I put in a support request to a company and they refer me to another area of their company, this just indicates a bad support structure.  If you believe my ticket should go in as a bug report, then how about.... submit it as a bug report.  Why am I having to do all the leg work for your product?
---
Neither are that bad if you're not a pleb and or are not running with plebs.

Ball cleveage shorts should be a thing.  
---
I feel like society is ready.  
---
I can imagine all sorts of cool outfits that show off my ball cleveage, for the office, for the pool, weddings and any sort of occasion.  
---
Wearing ball cleavage shorts will allow us men to use our assets to flirt with women who are in power in hopes of gaining some unfair advantage over those who are less endowed.  
---
There would be "wonder shorts" which push the balls up front and accentuate the cleavage. Like diamonds on a pedestal.  
---
There would be a little hole in the shorts to let the ball cleavage poke through
---
Healer
---
OK thanks but I'm lonely. I wanted someone to talk to.
---
“Oru”.
---
I remember this in Vanilla. On our server there was a rogue who would just live there and yank lowbies forever.
---
Maybe on 9:1 servers but this is not that, horde has advantage here sure but it's not like it's a sinking ship. migration was implemented to even out the servers in the 1st place, people didnt just quit the game before because of faction imbalance. Explain to me why it's any different now
---
There are way too many people on the servers
---
Some people play this game exclusively to be assholes, it's nothing new. Still, these people would corpsecamp and gank even during Phase 1 which was rarely the case.
---
In fact, I think it's in reverse: people who use the only way game offers for them right now to get points they want to get, are called assholes because of that.
---
You say you don't go in too fast but that's almost certainly what's happening. Wait for Rag to re-engage on a tank if you keep getting attacked by Rag. Just because you've seen the Wrath warning in DBM flash up doesn't necessarily mean the tanks are back in position.
---
The only other thing it could be is you're pulling aggro. Grab a threat meter and see for yourself.
---
Add engineering shield into the mix and you're an aoe tanking **GOD**
---
Good. Maybe punish these corpse campers some more.
---
You prob wont make it to the zombies at level 35 though
---
so the lvl 37 didnt want to fight the 42? oh no how dare he not fight
---
"They can't" means that company policy is to not restore it. Of course Blizzard technically *can*, Blizzard *can* do whatever they want.
---
Someone said Don Rodrigo's band is 1 of your BiS until Naxx on 95+ res bosses, can anyone confirm/deny?
---
What you are doing right now is not intended and will be patched soon when the masses realise how broken this macro is in conjunction with hand of justice trinket https://youtu.be/eBcQHl5xjTw
---
When your job is to respond the messages you get and fuck that up be happy that they didnt fire you.
---
40 minutes because 20x 2 minutes. 
---
but i changed it to 4 because you'd have to get people who are currently running in to start to come out and get another two people to summon you. adding another 2 mins.
---
That's probably how most companies over X amount of customers handle this. I mean it sucks that they can't restore the HKs but it's not that big of a deal in my eyes.
---
In my case i choose a quest reward, with plenty of free space in my bags and just did not reviece the item. Its not like i could farm the item again, the quest was complete. So i just kept reopening the ticket.
---
Are those dreamless sleep potions first?
---
God forbid people want to bend over backwards to defend blizzard. Yes I know how the system works from everything we've learned before (rather supposed to work, like having 10% dr instead of 25% dr but they added changes for w.e reason). But when someone gets 125 kills or whatever one day, and then the next day it shows that they only got 25 kills the previous day. It's clearly an issue. Yes it's still an issue even if the kills potentially might've for some reason moved to the next day because that indicates there are some issues in their implementation that they haven't been able to fix, including ones we haven't noticed.
---
eh....i'm not saying anything about him not wanting to fight. I was eating food myself and just wanted to get a quest done, so i'm glad he ran off.
---
Don't shit on employees who are not responsible for any of this shit. Customer support is most of the time the bottom of the chain and has no speak in any of the decisions made.
---
1shotting kazzak was patched out nearly immediately right? if they haven't fixed reckoning by now, i don't see them doing it anytime soon
---
Assuming you use a Barbaric Battle Axe with 3.6 speed.
---
* 335 Attack power / 14  = 23.9 DPS
---
* Bonus DPS from ap \* 3.6 (your attack speed) =  + 86 dmg per swing
---
* Base weapon dmg: 34 - 52 plus the 86 bonus dmg from your AP  = 120 - 138 (add rounding errors to get to your 139)
---
I have this mouse, I have mouse-wheel down bound to "Interact on Mouseover".  
---
Just rip the mousewheel and mouse my mouse over mobs to loot, especially useful when soloing dungeons.
---
Talk about being deliberately obtuse
---
This happens to me so much it’s actually dumb, I find it will put them at 1% and then the batched heal saves them....
---
Yeah, totally doesnt take me 4-5 corpseruns to get anywhere from a fp as a horde on flamelash. Oh wait it does. Venture has gank squads on the move all the time, dire maul and strath are both often controlled by alliance. Also, getting to brm is a fun experience since the pass from kargath to brm is where rage and a few other rogues just lie in waiting. Thorium is a no go often aswell due to damn rogues. I dont believe not-60 horde gets to do anything for free when a 60 horde doesnt get either.
---
Corpse camping between 3-8 AM is illegal now.
---
Good luck getting into lbrs any lower than 57-58
---
It's actually a very busy server, despite how the Screenshot makes it look :P
---
Bean is a great  pvp hunter and streamer.
---
You must be new to the internet if your not used to being called homo or gay.
---
Flamelash-EU
---
Just hit teleport to graveyard. They wasted their own time.
---
ST is hard and complete crap for XP. 10-20k xp per hour depending on how often you wipe.
---
BRD Arena from 52 ( good healer ) - 54, preferably with Anger if you can get a group with mostly 54+. 30k xp/hour.
---
LBRS from 56 (good healer) - 58 ( tank/dps ). 50k xp/hour
---
So when you camp a FP, or a zone, and keep killing people - guess what, they are honorless.  Again, kills don't matter, honor does. This isn't some fps or moba where you can flaunt how many kills you are getting.
---
Very casual player that Just got his lock to lvl 53. on a PVE server What did you guys do, run BRD non-stop to get some gear or did you keep questing?
---
I will probably quest in Un'goro til level 54 but wanted to know what people generally did.
---
The addon HonorPerHonor(HPH) tracks all your honor gain for the week, and more cool stuff with honordecay included, if that is what you mean?

https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/characterstatsclassic
---
Hahah yup I see this and think great! That’s the window I’ll play in then
---
Play on kurinaxx horde and the alliance do not seem to be massively outnumbered by any means, i think its like 57% horde but the alliance seem quite tight nit and well organized for the most part
---
Well, obviously they CAN add honor. They can probably do what ever they want, but they might have no records of your HKs so anybody could say they had 1000 HKs and they wouldn't be able to prove it. Or they just decided not to.
---
Early next year most likely means the first quarter, not the first month. I wouldn't get your hopes up for January.
---
There is no time limit in classic.
---
Yeah they never offered universal transfers off high pop, already overpopulated servers. That's not "vanilla" that's them trying to fix a non-issue (too many people overall for 1 layer) that they created, and creating a far larger issue.
---
Spoken like someone who's only played on 2.4.3 pservers. 
---
Classes continually got buffed through the expansion, and most are noticeably stronger due to talent and spell changes at 2.4.3 compared to 2.0.1. Additionally, there was a massive gear rework in 2.1 that significantly improved itemization
---
urgh. bah. yuck. etc.
---
Alliance on the mega servers should coordinate to hold AQ hostage. Have the largest guilds sign on to not do rep turn ins if the servers don't become more balanced.
---
It is possible to quest just fine up to level 48.
---
Ashbringer feels slightly alliance heavy or at least close to 50/50. Its a great and active server, only has queues on some populair raid prime times

Except it wouldn't be 40 mins ? Because people aren't doing it one at a time. One portal would get popped by a mage and summons would immediately start going out. So more like 6-10 mins max. But also, thats assuming 20 people don't remember their necklace, when it's more likely just 1 or 2 people. So in the reality it takes no time at all. It just seems to me like you're trying to justify that raid leader making you feel shitty. When from what you said he just seems like a tryhard asshole.

glitch in the matrix, maybe wow isn't real and we are all playing a simulation?? :O

congratulations. I just blew your tiny fragile mind..

What up doc
---
People who treat first level support like shit are garbage.
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one that uses it as a fidget spinner. That's how I learned there's a specific scroll speed that makes you DC from Destiny 2 servers
---
Its pretty empty ye, but there is some endgame content:  
---
\- Fishing 330+ (Bay of Storms - only zone in the world that has is)  
---
\- Azuregos  
---
\- Felcloth/Demonic runes farm  
---
\- Aqual Quintessences  
---
\- Probably gathering stuff but Im not sure what nodes spawn here
---
MCP is still better when you use the active.
---
Not even honorspy does that
---
News flash: We are all homo... sapiens.
---
I tanked a full run at 55 as a druid. Just start your own group if finding one is an issue.
---
How about Midget

You can just hop up onto a root/any other reset spot and not waste an invis pot.

Yesterday was a major U.S. holiday and 100% of schools are off Thursday, Friday in addition to the weekend.  Also, many people who work banker's hours are off on a 4 day weekend too - that is why so many people were online on a friday morning.

2 months ago this sub was non-stop positive posts, but the honeymoon is over, now
---
Building on this, why does classicwow receive second grade communication to the already questionable retail level of communication? Did we not see the largest net gain in subscribers? There certainly must be money flowing in, they've already earned 6 months of sub revenue from me, without even having retail installed.
---
Time will change this, but it should be a lesson that Blizzard is not our saviour for classic +, they can't even handle classic. We just get snide comments like "that's not a patch, that's a hotfix, and that was an update"...looking at you keyring.
---
All we can pray for is classic at B- service levels and hopefully TBC at some point.
---
Technically he'd be just as likely to get the bindings the week after that, but somehow knowing this doesn't make situations like that any easier.
---
If it was given to the wrong person it's the fault of the loot master, isn't it? I could imagine they agreed to not help with mistakes made by the players. Which is reasonable in my eyes.
---
I sold a 19 BIS weapon for 250g yesterday out of SFK- I think the prices will actually go down after WSG launches because of a flooded market.
---
I hope I’m not wrong because I hate leaving money on the table but was happy with 250g for doing nothing.
---
Hunter has been decent. Scatter, trap, flare, dot, snares, tracking, speed boost.

Pendulum of Doom, yum.

Demon Lands looks right.  I can kind of make out the D and the n in the first word.

Im not sure how's on your server but in Flamelash(Horde) it better to fish for Nightfins, I still prefer fishing in Azshara tho.
---
Lower/Raise subscription costs linearly to the faction imbalance on your main server.
---
60:40 H:A server -&gt; subs for horde players get 50% more expensive, subs for alliance 50% cheaper. In any scenario blizz would earn more money this way unless every server was exactly 50:50 balanced.
---
U memba star wars?
---
Yeah, and the size is just right. It's big but not overcrowded. I occasionally see queues show up, but I don't think I ever waited longer than a minute or two.
---
That’s called a sunk cost fallacy. I rerolled last week at 55, no regrets. Rather start from scratch than grind mobs in a dark corner for 1hr a day.
---
Cheapest dense fossil ever, can't wait!
---
Some Un'goro (linken quest chain), WPL at 55ish for In Dreams quest line and Blasted lands for the long Fallen Hero quest line - but lots and lots of BRD between 52-55 as healer. Upgraded to LBRS and DME, then did some strat runs at 57 and then the rest of the dungeons. Tried to save a bunch of quests until hitting 60, when they award gold instead of XP.
---
Exception is of course if you pay for multiple subscriptions.
---
Or use AH botting addons (one click = perform thousands of searches).
---
Not even remotely. I enjoy watching and listening to people advocate for idiocy; let them say "gif" with a hard g on the basis that *other* words have a hard g while also ignoring every soft g word in existence, and let them claim "irregardless" is perfectly fine because lots of other people do it. Makes no difference to me, I either go about my day or have a laugh at their expense.
---
No way undead is more popular, every dungeon group i've run has at least 3 orcs in it, even now, thinking about my core, we probably have at least 20 orcs. Undead is popular tho, i'll admit that. In my guild we have 1 troll and 2 tauren so the difference between Orcs and Undeads isnt that big.
---
There is.. it's harder to rank no? The spots get filled up
---
No, those #!@% keep paying anyway, no matter how much or little we insult them
---
I love it
---
Gehennas is a solid choice if busy is what you looking for.
---
Big plus if you are scandinavian.
---
Cant just stick to one area like with horde, you have to do multiple races 10-20 areas, pick at least 2 of loch, westfall, darkshore. and repeat for every level range.
---
Pretty sure alt + left click is what you are looking for.
---
It's not hard as a warrior could have hard levels if he's a bit undergeared, but for the norms that apply to hunters, it's their hardest levels. A bit akin to how 1-20 are a druid's hardest levels. In both cases they miss their tools that make leveling easier until the cutoff level.
---
Sorry, I was unclear. I meant that they don’t need to patch the game for anything else than the key ring, so the first “patch” could be tbc.
---
It will grow on you.
---
I also enjoy 3 hour long dungeons looking at moldy stone walls.
---
Naw that was American Thanksgiving.

Just run out at 4 secs...

My bad then. Must've missed the recent change when that shit movie was considered anything else than one of the worst films ever made. Kinda given that a sequel would be terrible as well if not just "bad".

Fearknot

if i wanted anything else i would have joined a casual guild. this sort of thing is pretty normal.
---
Yea man those 3 charges are gonna last you all the way to 60
---
Changes nothing. If your guild has almost all pre-bis, everyone is attuned, there is nothing you can do now for the people.
---
Those legs lasted me all the way until I got Angerforge's pre-bis legs. Amazing stuff for a quest reward.
---
The right move is to run to the tank like anyone else should.
---
Can you please tell me more about that fishing area? where is it, what can you fish there?
---
It's coming. Stay tuned. I'll link you the blue post once it's out.
---
I prefer simple apologies.
---
Yeah, but we are talking about 40 people attempting a thing over and over over 80 days.
---
this is the one
---
Hmm. Do you think I'll need full resto if all I need is to top him up between pulls? It's mostly 'cause I'm looking at Improved Weapon Totems in the Enhancement tree, which I think could be pretty good with a warrior + melee shaman.
---
Well it's 1 action per button press, per account. That's why they allow multiboxers. AH searching is just syntax and filtering which is why Addons can do it. It's not botting.
---
Designed by the paladin tier set designers I see
---
I'm leveling a Warlock at the moment. I'm nearly 60 and I'm struggling to bind enough spells to easy-to-reach keys. Does anyone have any suggestions about how to reduce the number of spells through macros or addons?
---
For instance: I found a macro that creates a Soulstone on left click, and uses it on right click. Therefore cleverly merging to potential binds into one.
---
More druid helms and caster offhand to vendor
---
Nothing but a big piece of shit, broken up into shit nuggets.
---
if u look up the data its like 40% UD 30% orcs
---
Most people I know use either ItemRack or WeakAuras.
---
Aha yeah it can make some games lag out from the scroll speed, in FPS games I mainly just changes weapons very quickly
---
The problem is that if you're in a loot council guild, chances are 80% of the people will also be there with enchants and consumes performing well and not wiping the raid.
---
That's where the step 3.5, which you forgot to mention, enters the picture: suck that officer cock.
---
There’s data for this? Do you have a link?
---
buff back spy so mofo multiboxers get caught more easily
---
The knockback does not have a 3 person limit... all of this is bs....
---
What are you talking about? I've never seen horde on those boats.

WoR wipes the aggro of everyone in the room if anyone is hit (not resisting) by WoR.
---
If you use a traditional strat and a melee forgot to get out before WoR, it resets the tank aggro. If your tank doesn't know this or has no rage pooled before WoR, he loses aggro to melees.
---
so it goes like this most times,
---
1. tanks will go deep prot when their gear is pretty trash when they've just hit 60 and are mostly in blues/preraid bis (the idea behind this build is to mitigate as much damage as possible to compensate for the lack of gear)
---
2. they switch to fury-prot hybrid after they have a few epics which makes it easier for their threat gen, this is needed once the raiders next to you start gearing out as dps since they produce way higher threat
---
I love ur passion about statistics dude! Keep it up
---
Are you sure about that? I can't seem to find any sources. From what I could tell in-game, this doesn't seem to be the case.
---
Phase 1 on Herod was great
---
was thinking about whether or not to do this myself. I tried a pvp server until level 20 and even then redridge was just getting camped by several higher levels all day long. I just hope it will be rewarding and exciting enough to be on PvE.
---
nah man we're not talking a little bit of difference due to DR, literally all of it went poof.  I lost &gt;10k.
---
I expect you to immediately move your goalpost and update your statement with something like "of course I meant" but how about Pyrewood Village,  Nethergarde Keep,  Hydraxian Waterlords. Pagle, Atiesh and so on?

That's really smart thank you
---
It's sad to see people actively destroying language, then defending it's destruction by saying "language is always evolving" or some such garbage.
---
Yeah, it evolves. What they're doing is *devolving* it, not evolving it.
---
Inb4 obligatory "ok boomer" I'm not even 30
---
If you resisted all WoRs and melee resisted/got out of range, this is indeed the current behaviour.
---
If anyone takes the KB, all threat is wiped.
---
I'm willing to bet those ~500 HK's probably came from camping level 48's getting off of flight paths anyways lol.
---
Bald and naked. lmao.
---
Yes it's super good to level it does 40 dmg per proc.
---
Well, I'm alliance as well on Lucifron which is way more inbalanced. Of course 50:50 is ideal but I don't get the whining at all - most players need to get a grip, seriously. 
---
If I need to get to a dungeon I consciously choose to
---
1. either accept some deaths on the way while fighting back often enough still killing one of them although I'm outnumbered
---
2. take a longer route and avoid fights
---
3. go together with my group/raid killing each and every horde player on our way until a bigger fish finds and gets us
---
I honestly enjoy the phase 2 chaos as it is right now - probably even more than most horde players do. I'm still doing all my PvE stuff and can PvP anywhere whenever I choose to.
---
&gt;Horde can level up and go to their dungeons unmolested because the world is dominated by the Horde due to the faction imbalance. 
---
This especially and the whole post is very one-sided. Big horde raids are camping BRM, DM Entrance and e.g. WPL to kill smaller grps. Our smaller but still big alliance pvp-grps and raids avoid those but roam different areas such as EPL, Feralas, Winterspring or Felwood to kill even smaller grps or solos. Both faction's lowlevels 48+ are getting killed constantly.
---
And of course horde will experience longer queue times even with x-realm bgs, cause there is more horde overall.
---
I honestly wish there were no x-realm bgs to punish all alliance fraidy-cats with long queue times who fled via transfers to Heartseeker and made the situation worse for both factions, even though it'd be worse for faction imbalance in the open world.
---
That's totally different then. If it's an ingame error not caused by the user the support should restore it.
---
Can I stack the rocket boots with my rogue sprint?
---
We dont get one on the EU client :(
---
What should you respond to each person separately when a lead programmers told you that that problem can't be fixed lol. I'm not defending blizzard support but there are more serious issues that player have and needs to be solved that stupid questions which answers can be found on forums and blue posts.
---
Alliance is (slightly) dominant in classic as well. Since horde being better in wpvp was expected and obvious, most alliance rolled on pve servers this time though.
---
&gt; that in of itself is completely insane to think that anyone who doesn't blitz content first few weeks of it's release, aquire end game gear and farm professions and consumables to get every possible advantage 'Had it coming'
---
Expecting no-lifers, after doing all the 'necessary' stuff, to just grief people when they get bored is insane? After following this sub before release and reading all PvP/PvE related posts?
---
Yeah I love all the "we clear mc in one hour" people neglecting the fact that they spent the better part of an hour (or more) getting dm and songflower buffs first.
---
Trinketmanu
---
You mean the PvE servers where there’s no forced pvp? That’s not moving the goal posts, that’s just completely irrelevant servers.
---
Hey! I see your question was already answered, so I would like to latch onto it:
---
Was it ever confirmed if +hit affects dual wielding or not? Because the link posted here states that there is insufficient data to confirm. The rogue discord has a crit calculation file that also shows no additional hits with more than +6% hit.
---
At the same time, the FAQ states "more hit is always beneficial".
---
The Necrosis addon is nice to use. It can get buggy after an update but I still enjoy. It has funny RP emotes when when summoning demons/people. It's also good for nightfall proc sounds and displays fear and banish immunity of your targets.
---
Nothing bad is going to happen to you, Blizz doesn't enforce that on the receiving end plus they crave subscriptions and banning can cause players to terminate theirs.
---
Brolaf
---
I have it on my paladin alt, its good 😃
---
That sucks that THAT'S your normal experience man. You don't have to be a casual guild to clear all the content every week AND be respectful/civil to other players.
---
Perhaps this relates to the lost honor too, as it only happened after being disconnected without logging off? 
---
I refuse to believe this issue cannot be fixed. I've been playing MMOs for 15 years now, and most other games I've tried have fixed this. A disconnect should not lose anything done hours before it happens.
---
jesus fucking christ i'd somehow managed to repress that memory
---
Y U DO DIS
---
I've done it in as little as 90 minutes.
---
World PvP in my opinion is very overrated. The novelty wears off quite early, and it just becomes annoying. At end game, you travel the world to get to dungeons and raids, and bumping into gankers is just an annoyance. If you are in the mood for PvP, you can do battlegrounds. I've never felt like I was missing out by being on a PvE server
---
There is no rational way to read the OPs post and not come to my original conclusion. Turning to personal attacks when your point is disproven is uncalled for.
---
I tanked first rings on druid as low as lvl 54. My first full run including saving princess Moira Bronzebeard was at lvl 56. With a help of my guildie lvl 60 Hunter ofc ^^
---
Na priv servers sucked cuz they started getting shut down or rerolled fresh servers every year but they were atleast fun. I have no desire to log into this game in its present state. I'm sure those on the dominant factions of pvp or on pve servers are having fun so sure let's show appreciation for blizzard, shuting down nost and making classic unplayable for entire factions on most the pvp servers, gj raking in those dollers.
---
This happens to both sides. I play horde on Herod, which is supposedly 62% horde yet BRM is almost always controlled by alliance. I'm talking a minimum of 100 alliance players there most of the time. Sometimes horde take it back, but the majority of the times I've gone down there I've had to corpse walk for fifteen minutes.
---
&gt; Yeah, but we are talking about 40 people attempting a thing over and over over 80 days.
---
My understanding was that 80 days is from the release of MC with the expacc so they had to level?
---
Also if u look up FinalbossTV his guild had 750 wipes on Argus mythic. Not trying to throw shade but some people just smash their faces against the wall until it breaks.
---
I mean it is a hard fight but there most be something fundamentally wrong with your gameplay or your strat if you need 750 pulls to kill an endboss 4 months into the raid tier at 500 world.
---
You need to find some better groups bc I've pushed 35-40k xp in ST.  It's not hard at all.  There is nothing hard about ST.  I've done runs in 90 minutes.
---
I just started an alt rogue and used it on a dagger to start. I had it put on the level 1 starting dagger which is not bound so I was able to sell it to other people starting a new char. I then put it on both black water cutlasses. It’s not as devastating at level 18 as it was up to level 10 or so but it still makes a major difference. Sometimes you’ll get lucky with procs and just global a mob. I can’t wait to equip both my cruel’s that are already enchanted in my bank waiting for level 19. I would also pickup engineering. The tank dummy’s are quite useful.
---
this is nto that bug.  I pvp'd from noon to 10 pm on and off and lost it all.
---
If you get a couple million people to use it over a sustained period of time, sure, let's put it in the dictionary. Because that would make it a word.
---
Don't you need a hunter to counter casters?

I was a bit off its 28% UD 25% orc
---
Yes, very very good
---
I was going to suggest some enhance/resto mix to get those buffs. But I think most knowledgeable people say the talent points for those totems arent worth it. At some point he will be literally able to mow down 4-5 mobs at once (more with WF), at that point it's not just topping off. If I group with a healer on my decently geared warrior twink I literally never have to stop when something to kill is around.
---
I've had so many sapper charges used on just me leveling from 46-59
---
I spammed BRD from lv 49-55
---
Thank you. Also it seems prices are little inflated on my server. How much did it costed you per enchant?
---
No maraudon or sunken temple? Also surely you can do LBRS towards 57?
---
And if Blizzard had done the countdown to the server closing like they usually do then that in itself would have prevented a lot of these issues anyway.
---
I'm 59 and 4 bubbles away from 60. I haven't logged in for weeks now. It's not enjoyable to play run simulator doing corpse runs all night.
---
Hey everyone, I plan on leveling a lock once I get home in a few weeks.  Any necessary macros or addons a Lock should be using for both leveling and endgame? Thanks
---
yeah no, its not griefing.
---
nope, I'm on a pve server so just raid v raid at TM all gone.
---
idk what ur talking about bud, me and my streamer friends get helped instantly. guess you just need a decent sized following lol anyways smell ya later idiot XD

---
I never got to heal in Vanilla but I absolutely loved pvp healing in BC as disc. I was basically a tank that generated aggro through healing. If you left me alone you were never going to kill my teammate, if you tried to kill me I got to play pillar hump all day. except for enhancement shamans...fuck enhancement shamans.
---
You don't need full runs to get 8-10 levels from BRD rings around arena and prison block. Just 2+ Mages for AoE exp farm.

&gt; ' 
---
just as many people preached the resurgence of Classic's community spirit being revived as well as hundreds of posts and replies discussing the numerous outcomes that PVP could have resulted in. And not everyone reads reddit. If the experience that phase 1 I had was to believed in regards to how PVP would be conducted, I still didn't believe it would be this bad as well as apparently numerous other people.
---
I remember being in a vent server with like half a dozen other guys I met on some private server or another.
---
I think I was 14 at the time and the oldest guy was 16 or 17, youngest was 11 or 12.
---
People were spamming meatspin and lemonparty in world chat and we were having a laugh about it.
---
One guy made the mistake of mentioning it doesn't bother him and  that he didn't understand why people found it so horrible so we collectively egged him into watching it for some amount of time with it coming through his speakers so we'd know if he stopped watching. 
---
After about 3 minutes of this we hear his mom come in asking "Hey do you have any clothes that need to be---WHAT ARE YOU WATCHING OH GOD"
---
His mother starts scolding him for watching "gay" porn and the dude starts panicking while the rest of us are just busting up laughing at the perfection of the situation and he desperately tries to tell his mom that he was dared to watch it by a bunch of people he'd met in-game.
---
So she finally calms down enough to consider that and he desperately starts asking her to ask us herself if she doesn't believe him.
---
She asks the rest of us "So, did you boys dare him to watch this?"
---
Naturally, we went dead fucking silent. Not a damned peep.
---
Nearly a minute passed in complete silence and one of the older guys says, firmly, confidently, the most perfect thing anyone could say in that situation:
---
"I'm sorry ma'am but your son is gay"
---
I don't remember any of their names or anything else about them, but man, I don't think I'll ever forget them and I hope they're all looking back on that day fondly too.
---
It depends on what bracket you're talking about. The 10-19 bracket is going to play out very differently from the 60 bracket.
---
But staying alive for like 8 minutes is sooo satisfying haha. Especially when reinforcements show up and fold that bastard in half.
---
Just read this was supposed to be humour. Sorry dude haha.
---
You can simply shift out of poly dude. Same with roots and slows.
---
Yep I was quite excited when my guildmaster posed the challenge of us 10 manning Ony! After a 2 wipes (one with the damn dragonkin respawning on us) and nearly 30 major mana pots and 30 demonic runes later... We down her on the 3rd attempt!!
---
16 minute fight as 10 man and the parse for my priest is in top 10 priest Ony parses for my server. Was super fun!
---
Ye, probably. I will check it out. Thanks!
---
Where's the best place to check out stats for servers in regards to faction, race, class distribution etc? I can only seem to find data from September.
---
A server crash is the key part there.
---
Yeah but I can choose how many I craft, similar strategy but less versatile.
---
Ha nice try dude almost made me realize this game is doomed #nochanges unless its garbage batching and NOTHING else. #classicplus #Onywasbuggedforlikeamonth
---
Good for them. Hope every last one gets out.
---
We've been doing this after we cleared MC
---
It wasn't calculated properly in beta either. They've had hundreds if not thousands of bug reports just from beta on this exact topic.
---
People don't get it. After naxx releases and things cool down, those 5 people will also be fired. They have invested in the ultimate money making tool. A game that just takes money with no development.
---
With that logic, anything is right as long as enough people believes it. A la flat earthers, etc. 
---
But that's not how objective facts/truth works. Creating/using a completely unnecessary, confusing, redundant word is STUPID. And it should be pointed out at every opportunity that it is stupid. And we shouldn't encourage stupidity.
---
Rogues and warriors are chum change when I have my succubus out.
---
You must mean "superior" numerically, because I cant see how skill is needed for all the ganking that goes when trying to get to BRD.
---
What days did he spawn on ?
---
Oh, yeah that's true. Fuck, I feel like that's something they'd do too and then as someone said before make you feel like you've been lawyered..
---
I've heard [ironforge.pro](https://ironforge.pro) is the place to go.
---
hm ok thats actually not so much
---
Jokerd?
---
Today listing / stocking mats and crafting took 40 minutes, I made roughly 30-40g for this time..
---
Everything seems to scale up depending on the investment so i’m making more and working less every day.
---
This !  
---
im a tank as well, and i dont see reason to claim items.  
---
If you are doing it good, you make profit after a run
---
Quests give gold at level 60? Didn't know that.  Might change my plan
---
You clearly didnt read or understand my post. "Just look at the armor, and stam", exactly what i already answered.
---
T1 has more Armor and around the same Stam
---
PvP Blue is great if you dont raid or play a DPS spec. But ranking below 10 (which is where most people will end up maxing out because of time issues) gives you nothing thats better than what you can already get. And most people who have the time to Rank to ~10 are already raiding since week 2/3 and have a better chunk of the T1.
---
you can ask it, but be prepared to get No as an answer.
---
"Yo I like to be tank so ppl suck my dick to get me in dungeons but I can't spellcleave farm, is it OK to be a dick and roll need for gold everyone needs to repair the armor?"
---
Finding a joke lazy and unfunny doesn’t mean someone can’t take a joke. It just means your sense of humor is shit.
---
Except you have just said "servers" without any specification. Ok so it's "PVP servers" now after you updated? What about Heartstriker then?
---
Yea I don’t understand what’s so hard about this to get.
---
Melee Hunter is not a meme mmkay.
---
Damn that sucks if this is true. I was pvping with my friend last night and he was going on about how his sheet for yesterday showed he got nothing when he had something like 200 hks and roughly 25k honor. Hopefully he doesnt get shafted.
---
Honestly i have no idea
---
In my opinion extra hit doesnt hurt
---
man i get so annoyed at my self when i see these posts. i’m just so lazy to make any gold with my prof. i have alchemy to 300 and have a good amount of recipes but i get lazy to actually try to make gold off of it. i also have herbalism which helps a lot with the profit margin. but honestly i just rather go do Mara Tinker/Princess runs and just get the blindweed and the Ghost Mushrooms and i get about 30-40g an hour. and i’m able to make whatever pot i need. grinding the AH is just so boring for me.
---
Yes
---
I was wrong then, i thought the ratio would be like that but with Orcs on top
---
I was always wondering: Does drain life generate more aggro since technically you are healing yourself?
---
Haven't delved deeply into PvP myself, but it definitely seems like horde has the better racials for PvP.
---
An additional stun? Yes please.
---
Stun resist? A bit random, but still amazing.
---
And then there's will of the forsaken. Man, that feels so powerful.
---
Though, I suppose improved stealth detection is also useful and I can't deny that shadowmeld is a neat utility, though those don't really help much in a straight up duel...
---
Correct me if I'm wrong though. I haven't done much PvP.
---
orc warriors are hardly the best
---
undead have will of the forsaken, and the tauren are the best pve warrior tanks
---
Ah yeah, in that case I think I'll start enh and then respec to full resto once he gets some AoE abilities. First respec is cheap, after all.
---
I also have a druid main I can use to help with the whirlwind axe quest, once we get that far. :D
---
Except the exploit you are using allows you to actually get +1 extra attack to your reckoning bombs. So if you get a proc and then use this macro on your next swing, it actually attacks 3 times instead.
---
This is very clearly an exploit.
---
It wasn’t bad kinda depends on the market but enchanters try to sell it with there mats for 25g a piece which is crazy expensive I buy the mats and just find someone leveling enchanting to do it for free. From the AH small radiant shards are around 2g a piece you need 4 and essence of fire is around 1g you only need one so total is around 9g-12g depending on our current market price and tip.
---
Hindsight I wouldn’t have wasted it on the blackwater cutlasses because they will be replaced in like 5 levels I would have just went with a gray level 14 weapon that I could sell after I use them. There was a guide to it I read and the cruels should last to well past 29 with fiery so I feel it’s worth it on them. Don’t get me wrong it’s super fun having it, but is seems like the proc rate is now we’re near consistent sometimes you’ll rip 4 procs out on a mob and destroy it and sometimes you’ll go through a whole fight without a proc.
---
Heartstriker is literally the 1 fucking pvp server that is alliance dominated. Like I said in the original post.
---
You can’t outnumber me 5:1 here to win mate. Go back to BRM and kill some level 54s in your raid group.
---
member chewbacca?
---
Sure, but the question is who has access to that value. A GM will not be able to manipulate the database where honor is stored and is limited to the tools Blizzard provides him. If there is no "set Honor to X"-command, then the GM can do nothing.
---
Maybe he means it’s confusing? If you know what you’re doing it’s not hard at all.
---
12g on Golemagg
---
Respecing to Ele was easier than leveling a Priest... This run is pretty good I used to look for Warriors all the time and we compete on the veins sometimes.
---
Which was knows well in advance that it would be like this.
---
Warrior/Hpally/Mage/Rogue or Lock/Rduid or Priest.  
---
Warrior with freedom is crazy. Another healer to do things the paladin can’t. Mage for great control and damage, and same thing with the rogue or lock.
---
Reroll feral druid
---
The main reason we wipe in MC - Shamman forgot his totem somewhere - Wild Core hound appear
---
Horde are camping graveyards too
---
They didn't offer universal transfers but they did offer transfers off high pop servers it did cause big disparities in population size. I was actually part of the great Warsong migration myself. They actually did the transfers off Warsong to fix the issue of too many players on one layer. Its a vanilla experience through and through and one players wanted since the idea of classic started. The easy server swaps and lack of community it's really interesting to see the arguments to break up communities a few months after launch.
---
except for pvp, which is the core of the game. if you dont like pvp then yes you are screwed.
---
This is the kind of quality content I come here for.
---
Is this copy pasta or did I just witness true brilliance in the wild...
---
So? Still bad design
---
They aren’t mutually exclusively and it’s very subjective
---
I linked EU realms tho so if u US it might be different
---
It's not "only know how to" it's "is only allowed to use"
---
That is fair. Definately there should be balance. However regardless of balance if there are equal numbers there will still be roaming deathballs. The two big groups will meet one will win then the losing group will respawn and keep farming smaller groups at worst elsewhere. At best they will move to a different zone but this only fixes the problem in that zone while making it worse in the next zone. People will still farm honor regardless. I understand the feeling of being ganked in rotation. But it is only a reduction in total numbers that will fix the issue however. Balance is icing on the cake but wont deliver the fix you desire if it is done without overall number reduction.
---
Don't try and enlighten the mongrels.  It's simple business that comes natural to some people.  Others can see the margins.  
---
I'm sitting at 1200g, with 2000g in BiS BOEs on my main character, and about 800g in potions.  Yet people still cry about Alchemy being shit everyday.
---
Of course these idiots see the price of materials and potions at similar price levels.  What they don't see is the fluctuation in prices over 7 day span.  GFFP might cost 4g to make and sell for 4g10s **RIGHT NOW**.  I snagged the materials for 3g on Sunday night, and plan to sell them for 5g per potion on Tuesday night.
---
Yes I flip the herbs too.  But you can sell even more herbs at the flipped price converting them to a variety of potions.  My goal is to have 9 alts with Xmute, generating free cash everyday so I don't even have to flip things. 
---
Also finally snagged Greater Arcane Elixir recipe the other night for 25g after check for it nonstop the past 2 months.  Seen them at 800+ gold and finally some noob found one and listed it cheap.
---
Saw it, pretty nice tbh.
---
That’s how I got it too lmao
---
Good luck finding that 1v1 though, regardless of which faction you play on :P
---
Ah. Well. I’m going to accept that there are more possibilities for that there, but still take it with a grain of salt.
---
I'm on Herod. Alliance guilds are dying.
---
He’s implying that there isn’t a reason for him to farm honor because the game might glitch again and he could lose out on even more honor than he already has, and blizzard won’t do anything about it.
---
Your comment was stupid, delete it.
---
I’d you wanted to be 60 you’d be 60.
---
Sounds like he's talking about 60. Pretty safe assumption.
---
Arms is a pure PvP build. You basically have two options:
---
1. Either stay with the dps-spec Fury/Arms (only difference between 2h-fury and dw-fury are the points in dw specialization). You can still easily tank each dungeon and off-tank mc.
---
2. Go Fury/Prot. You'll find respective builds on wowhead and elsewhere. What you lose by this is basically Deep Wounds and Anger Management which makes stance-dancing a lot more difficult, but also means you will improve on that. What you gain is 15% threat (+ more threat by reduced sunder armor rage-cost) in addition to some mitigation and Last Stand.
---
Yes, as does siphon life
---
It matters to me a lot. Playing classic I actually realised how much more I like the old character models compared to the retail ones. Like I wouldn’t use the retail version of my classic character’s hairstyle because all the human hairstyles on retail have been altered to have this high-res, feathered anime look to them. I prefer the blocky but stylised primitiveness of classic. 
---
Also Night Elves look 10x better on classic than retail.
---
You should have fun doing pvp, rewards or not.
---
Many go for Last stand, 1/3 imp shield block and 5/5 defiance which uses 17 points in prot. The rest can be used as you like but from what i see most go deep fury. In my guild MT and OT uses a build like this for MC and Onyxia and lets them solo as well. You can either DW tank or slap on a shield if needed.
---
Since it's aimed at alliance pvp servers, where not being instanced means getting instakilled by horde, it's that effective, also, humor
---
Hey mate, don’t even bother with this idiot. He’s running the same narrative in every anti horde thread on here, it’s almost like he’s being paid. 
---
He’s obviously playing horde and is scared that all the complaining is going to take away his 2:1 advantage in every situation.
---
I specced disc/PI to farm lashers in DM:E. I have to alternate PI and IF on successive pulls. The gold isn't great but it beats running to my corpse every two minutes out in WPVP. 
---
More time farming and less time running to your corpse. If you are a herbalist then even better because I pass over lots of dreamfoil and groomsblood nodes. Unfortunately no herbalist.
---
i think part to blame is the shitty guides on wowhead that tell you that hoj is an option for hunters (crazy i know) pre raid bis and no one calling these shit guides out
---
This doesn't work. I got ganked on the Undercity to STV Zep by a rogue whilst the Zep was in STV. By the time I got to the Zep tower in Grom'gol the Zep had gone and it was back in Tirisful with my corpse. I tried to press unstuck and it teleported me back to STV graveyard ;/
---
? It's fundamentally different
---
Yes, they do. I think some basic kill-X-mobs quest in EPL gave \~3.8 gold or something of the like upon completion. Not a fortune, but it does add up nicely.
---
well after Blizz caved with the early released of DM and Phase 2, and also pulling forward the release of the BGs, I dont think BWL will be more than 6 weeks away from BGs going live.

They don't have to determine if it's a bug.. just forward it to the team responsible for handling that.  The user shouldn't be responsible for interdepartmental communication.  Even if you don't forward it, if it's a known bug just say it's being worked out and hope they have a solution soon.  
---
In this case the support script but everything back on the user "PvP more and submit a bug report" was their response.  That is a horrible response as far as customer service goes.
---
&gt; If everybody knows it, they are making sweeping and incorrect statements making it sounds 100% one-sided.
---
Because the vast majority of servers, the ones virtually every single person you're talking to, are horde dominated.  Sure it's not 100%, instead only 90% or so.  So why are you even bothering to bring it up?
---
I work in tech support, and what you do is this. You type Hi, name, and then paste in your canned message. Takes you one more second, and saves you the embarrassment.
---
ret paladins are not useful.  it's pretty obvious what i was trying to say.  they'd be better off as holy instead of being selfish.

If they ban you there may also be legal grounds to go to court and maybe change the classification of androids by the Supreme Court

Thing is, I love this game so much and I fully understand why both factions do what they do. I have no problem what so ever with the PVP mechanic and it's combat it's all parts of what I love, but when it makes new players and people who simply missed the boat getting to max level it's become impossible to do any content in a reliable time frame unless you either have massive player support or willing to die tens of times getting into a instance on BOTH faction (I know someone here is willing to jump in about horde v ally, it doesn't actually matter anymore who's side you are on) it's just a miserable experience even for people who want to grind honor. Here's to the hope that BG's actually help the issue because I don't really want my 300+ hours just sitting dead on a server since doing anything except dedicated PVP contect will just get you murdered.
---
Rag is still bugged right now lol
---
Im almost all raid BiS with 5k+ gold.
---
There are no valuable resources here... Please move along... I swear...

Is there any high level food I can make with Cooking that restores mana rather than health? My googling has been failing me, or it doesn't exist. There is Goldthorne Tea, but that's low level. I'd love not to have to keep buying water for leveling. My Cooking is 300.

Some people actually make 100k per year driving a tractor trailer across the country.  Hitting the maximum number of hours possible in a given day, everyday, every week.
---
Some people make 100k per year managing numbers on a spreadsheet.
---
There are multiple ways to skin a cat.
---
&gt;They want honor, not to just kill people over and over.
---
Some actually just want to kill you repeatedly until you quit. Honor is just a bonus.
---
I'll be damned, so there might be a reason to keep questing.  Cool.
---
Yeah, I agree it's annoying but it has been like this forever.  If you make major UI changes just log off and back on to 'save'.  You shouldn't have to, but it will prevent you a lot of anguish in the future.
---
Sorry to have offended you like this. I could bore you with my reasons, but think I'll refrain from doing so.
---
Firemaw is an EU server.
---
Even the very unbalanced iterations of pservers have never been like this open world. There was literally zero precedent suggesting this would be the state of things on a PVP server.
---
This is pretty much how I levelled my mate who started playing 6 weeks after launch.
---
Two things: slice and dice

Windows 10 is the entire reason I'm learning how to use linux. I refuse to migrate from 7 to 10.

&gt;The difference between deep prot and fury/prot is not mitigation
---
Of course it is, that's why when people take fury mixed with prot they don't buy talents like increased defence rating etc
---
Running out of quests?  There are so many i still have to do.  hard to imagine.
---
I literally have never even seen an alliance player out in the world at all.
---
I only get out of Ironforge once per week though.

Yeah how ever could they dip into their 19 billion dollar net work and fix an algorithm on a 15 year old game? Cmon guys

Can you not read? He is talking about dispelling allies.
---
Rage reduction on sunder sucks, dont go fury/prot its shit for dps and shit for dungeon tanking cuz u cant stance dance w/ rage. Fury/prot is for geared MT in raids where ur dps do so much threat that u cant hold aggro as prot. Regular fury isgreat for dps and offtanking. u got the right spec, just stick with it
---
Uh, the overwhelming majority of players DIDNT wait for the PvE queue, and if they did the PvE realms would still have 60 minute lines to get in today.
---
Fbi open up
---
Sort of except you weren't injured so it is definitively not the same as punching someone. But a trolls reason to troll is to illicit a reaction. If you ignore them they go away.
---
Cross-realms with all the other realms dominated by Horde. 
---
Yep, no downside again. /s
---
In concept sure, but it does the exact same to the game.
---
&gt;Do top balcony trolls.
---
&gt;Do rest of dungeon bosses.
---
&gt;Profit?
---
it rly will depend if the account that sold u the gold gets caught or not. if by some chance it gets flagged, u will probb also get the hammer.
---
dont however snitch on yourself, no matter how guilty u feel :) just dont do it again, no1 should encourage gold selling m8. if u r taking shortcuts in a game u probb have the same thought process in rl, and thats not how life (should) work :D
---
But camping flight paths or boats are fine when the server pops are low. I don't think anyone would mind that. 
---
The problem is that every single boat, every single FP and every single zone has 40 man raids waiting to corpsecamp a lvl 48 because of the massive population. 
---
If the servers were capped at lets say 3500, it wouldn't be nearly as bad.
---
When I first started playing (back in the beginning of Wrath) this was my situation. I hated being on a PvP server, but that is where my buddies were, until they quit and left me alone. I learned from this. I only want to PvP when I am in the mood to PvP, hence I have joined nothing but PVE servers since then. It's easier to find new on-line friends to play with on the server you want to be in than it is to live with a PvP server when you aren't a big fan of that gamestyle (and yes, getting ganked a dozen times on the way to a dungeon is a part of that gamestyle)
---

Reckoning is still very much a thing in classic. It is just more mechanically intensive.

Are you getting it from Twitch?
---
have you not read this sub AT ALL? i swear to god
---
Agreed, if you can get the crescent key you can sneak into DM via the east ent northeast of the horde camp in feralas. It's a circular stone structure with a quest giver on top and door to dm below. Run in, strip, die, release to DM spirit healer and death run to the instance your trying to get to. Straight up depressing this is what the game has come to but ya...
---
This is missing friendly magic dispel though, which is essentially mandatory for clearing sheeps and other cc. I like ele as secondary heals though
---
Sensitive is a personal attack? Yikes lol.
---
This all day, close thread .
---
Vanilla server concurrent online cap at launch was 2.5k then slowly enlarged to 3k (and to 3.5k according to some devs): the source here is Blizzard.
---
I am more interested in your current estimation of online players on server at any given moment and the source of it.
---
Fuck Alexensual, fuck everything about him, don't push his content please.
---
1.  It depends on whether there are other druid healers and what they assign to you.  If you are the only druid, you will probably be on raid healing, so go nuts on your hots.  You can only have one of each hot active on a player.  Two druids can't give the tank a Rejuvenation each.  Only one will be up. If you are just starting, then you won't be on the MT. Your gear isn't good enough.  Healing others, you can use Touch or you can use hots, depending on whether the damage is periodic or just over and done. 
---
2. Healing adds to the total and is split by the ticks.  So 400 healing breaks down to +40 a tick if ten total ticks. 
---
3. I believe it's only for the party, not the raid.  So if you have heavy damage on your group but stacked together, it's good. 
---
4. Dark or Demonic Runes.  Not druid specific but having more mana available on a different cool down from your mana pots is huge.  Also greater fire protection potions for Rag.
---
5. Whatever mods your raid leader wants.
---
Drain life does not generate additional threat.
---
I've tried telling the raidleader that, but they want to do it this way. We usually clear MC in 3-4h but faster pace would be Nice 👍🏼
---
I don't believe diminishing returns are *consistently* being shown on the default Blizzard honour estimation when you kill someone.
---
I've seen it work, then I've killed someone 4 times in a row, with full honour being estimated each time which is obviously wrong because I killed them consecutively 4 times in a row in one day.
---
I recently discovered and started using honour spy. And I noticed the default ui didn't track a diminishing return while Honor spy did.
---
It's at least a visual bug occurring, but it could also be more, and based on theor track record, is more.
---
We did server first horde rag on my server and we would never do something this way. First of all, people send out multiple reminders in gchat (O's and non-O's alike) to bring quint and the neck 30-60 mins before raid starts. Also, if someone did screw up they would just get a port and summon back. If you are late, then you can run in while we are clearing. If you miss the boss, that's on you and there's an attendance policy already to handle this stuff.
---
What? It's the only contested zone horde don't straight up "own", and it's pretty back and forth. If we bring 4 people 15 horde show up withing 5-10 min
---
What's SGC?
---
It does not unless it's bugged, it counts as a drain effect and only does 1 type of threat.
---
if u spec into holy nova u should have no problems doing lasher runs, and with herbalism ull get a pretty decent gold income there.
---
You.
---
It sure was somethin! The healing comp was me H priest with over 200 hps over duration of fight, a resto shaman who used a flask of wisdom and had over 8k mana, and a resto druid to feed me innervates. Nearly all of my heals were down ranked for max efficiency and I have over 700 plus healing. I can link a log in the morning if u wish but am laying in bed now. This is 3 or 4 weeks ago and still hasn't been done on the server. Who knows maybe it was first classic 10 man?
---
They still had a choice. 
---
They chose the short-term advantage of not waiting a few minutes to log in, over the long-term advantage of not being ganked/camped all the time.
---
Everyone had a choice. No one was FORCED onto a pvp server.
---
Yea, could take priest instead of drood i guess
---
As a rogue I appreciate this info
---
I've told The raidleader about that, probably try it out in The future.
---
i also thought about tanking as a feral druid as a twink
---
is it really that much better for holding AE Aggro?
---
They seem very keen to keep going with TBC. Hopefully Blizzard doesn't pull the plug.
---
You are 100% wrong.
---
All you need to do is record a video, have it go viral and/or some notable streamers pick up on it, and post it on reddit.
---
It'll be hotfixed within 24 hours.
---
Bug reports do nothing.  Widespread bad publicity gets instant attention.
---
Or just do a few DMN tributes and get Unyielding Maul rather than spend $$$ on a minor improvement.
---
Someone never got to watch Space Jam as a child.
---
Yes, downloaded it from the Twitch client
---
This.. the atmosphere has gotten even more toxic than in 2004. I would never want to roll pvp with this streaming going on. The streamers could care less for others, and will do anything for hits. Then you add  all of the people with the emotional intelligence of a 14 yr old following the streamers, and forget it  It's like a Jr. High cult.. no thanks I don't want to be their victim.
---
Priests can mind vision.
---
&gt; Is the Subtlety spec viable for raiding? I saw a PvE talent buid on the warcrafttavern website but i don't know if it's worth it (i want to do PvP and PvE aswell, that's why i'm considering using a Subtlety build).
---
&gt; The website says the Hemorrhage is useful for the raid because it increases the (physical) raid damage.
---
im not familiar with the site, i'll check it out when i get home. Are you looking to tank or dps as a rogue?
---
I am currently playing a sm ruin warlock and want to go pvp but also pve with him. What would be the best sm/ruin build that is a bit pvp focused for battlegrounds but still not useless in dungeons?
---
Haven't they had free transfers for months?
---
Finding peacebloom so close together must be great.
---
More rogue heads for sure.
---
Just the damage, not the healing. The healing comes directly from the damage.
---
In addition, skills like mortal strike that reduce your healing, don’t actually reduce the drain life healing from what I’ve seen.
---
It gives 20 to damage and healing, but only because of the +damage part. +healing is irrelevant.
---

That was private server wonkiness.
---
Its might easier to do that for ally, they have lot more tagets than horde.   
---
Imagine roaming around for 20 mins not finding anything and than you finally see 1 Ally but he's 55. If you want to stay competitive with your rank you don't really have a choice here. The honor rewards in solo kills even on lower lvls are too huge to pass. It rewards around 100 honor compared to meat grinder kills which rewards in single digits  
---
I feel sorry for everyone who ones to do something productive in open world. I wish BGs were out.  
---
So yeah Im one of those assholes who kill everyone on sigh, and Im sorry.
---
Druids cannot use dynamite in bear form.
---
If you're an "average player" in a low population guild, who has no friends, and thinks that PVP "has no purpose" just because you won't hit R12, then I have to question why you're even playing the game in the first place, let alone on a PVP server.
---
Haha :D
---
Yeah but it’s only to specific servers and those servers are basically dead because no one wants to go to them
---
&gt;Garr is supposed to self detonate adds as he drops in health at a certain threshold, literally does the emote now, people overtly argue with me this never existed. Yet its on websites and its literally a live emote right now as I type this.
---
i thought i was going insane when i said this and the other officers in my guild told me it was never like that, thank you for proving me right
---
And here we see shit players engaging in misguided discussion
---
It would probably end up being another EULA argument and various US courts have been notoriously noncommittal when dealing with those. As per their ToS and EULA, Blizzard is free to modify those documents at any time, allowing them to include clauses banning automatons. I don't think the Supreme Court would dare interfere with something as serious as interpreting who gets to be a person and have rights, those decisions tend to lie with the lawmakers.
---
On a side note, if your ~~sex doll~~ android friend were to obtain full human rights, that would most likely give an ironclad argument for Blizzard to uphold their ban for account sharing.
---
So I still maintain my suggestion of adopting 2 Senegalese orphans. The 3 of you will be able to set up efficient non-stop honor grind, while they will get much needed English practice in BG chat, which would help their integration.
---
Maybe start resurrescting on the edge of ur rez zone instead of on top of your corpse so you make some progress then.
---
So in big open world PvP both factions plant low level players to give the enemy DKs? Or the low levels can attack the high levels with no repercussions? That will never work
---
The majority of the devs hate classic. It's just showing them how much of a failure the direction retail wow has taken is.

I have one question regarding this table.
---
According to  [https://classic.wowhead.com/news=292085/hit-cap-in-classic-wow-clarifications?webhook](https://classic.wowhead.com/news=292085/hit-cap-in-classic-wow-clarifications?webhook) the yellow miss change is 9 % as a gap &gt; 10 points between the attacker's weapon skill and the enemy's defense skill adds 1 % to miss. Having +5 weapon skill closes this gap and reduces the hit chance to 8 %.
---
How do you get the 6 % or has there been an update I did not find?
---
Shapeshift macro
---
Writing a ticket for that reason is also dog shit.
---
Hey! Haha yeah sorry, it's not the easiest subject so I had difficulty explaining myself. But you got it! 
---
Wow gamepedia says the following: Important note: Prior to version 1.8, dual wield's miss chance had a hard cap of 19%, meaning that all dual-wield auto-attacks had a minimum 19% miss chance regardless of how much +hit% gear was equipped. In version 1.8, this hard cap was removed
---
So exactly, my question was, can we reduce that miss chance or not. You say I can check that on warcraftlogs. Can you let me know where to look? Not sure where to start
---
This is it boys.  This is why we play the game!
---
WPvP is fine, was fun in phase 1.  It's not the open world pvp in itself that's bad, it's shit like the honor system that's a train wreck.
---
You seem to have a fundamental misunderstanding of what happens, the head always disappears 30 minutes before the buff can go out again.
---
Oh wow, what a revelation! I never knew you could do that! Thank you for enlightening my poor soul.
---
How did they survive two waves of Sons of Flame?
---
Maybe he's Horde and has to share every kill with 20 people.
---
That depends on if you have geared and competent healer as well.
---
Waow BRILLIANT. Such an incredible story. I can't believe you both did something in the game.
---
2nd sentence
---
&gt; It's completely feasible. It's just harder. You don't have a taunt so if someone pulls, it's harder to get aggro back. But with Earthshock and rockbiter, it's completely feasible. Your group can't be dumb and go balls to the wall dpsing the wrong target. you'll also need a moment to hit each mob to generate a little threat. Chain lightning is great for this. I would recommend a very fast 1 hander for tanking. That way a miss costs you less and you can switch targets that much more to generate threat on them. Daggers are especially good for this. You're going to need to be at least a little min/max-y so that you can survive properly.
---
&gt; You also dont' have the emergency cooldowns that warriors and druids have. Reincarnate won't work because your threat will be so low after you die. I believe death wipes threat at this point in the patches.
---
there's been some heavy theorycrafting on the matter with some people on private servers making their way up t'ill Naxx as a shaman tank, there's a neat write up on https://barrens.chat/ about the subject.
---
So? Devs agree and told everyone clearly that they will not change it just because it's bad and imbalanced.
---

---
Feel free to log on and kill me in Hillsbrad next week! 
---
There are a few hordies whom I love seeing on the battlefield. Pollz trolls me a bit though and leaves me sapped.
---
Pretty nutty tbh
---
It is 100% because they are pirates. During the Halloween event if you were fortunate enough to be turned into a pirate you would swim faster as well.
---
No it's the threat that gets cleared no matter if you're in range or not. If everyone moves out (except the tank) only the tank will get hit. If 4 people or more are in range, only 3 people will get hit (the 3 which created their character the earliest out of all the people in range).
---
Generally the fact that it only hits 3 people isn't really that big of a deal because usually there isn't three people in range of ragnaros anyway. However, knowing that only three people get hit (instead of ALL the melee) this means if you know which 3 people will get hit (which is easy as its based on the GUID) you can just shield those three people before wrath and thus increase your melee dps significantly as you can guarantee that most of the melee dps doesn't need to take a break and that the tank will never get yeeted.
---
The biggest problem is the wonky threat-reset which means that he will sometimes turn around and just outright kill a melee that should be low on the threatmeters, because the tank had his threat completely reset.
---
I would like to correct you on this:
---
the decay is applied to you current RP and it then adds the new RP.
---
so in your example it's 4000\*0.8 + 6000, which results in 9200 RP.
---
Whoops, my bad
---
Oh, I just assumed you must be doing something wrong since the distances we have to travel are the same. Horde is more numerous but alliance groups up, everyone ends up corpserunning but thats why we rolled on a pvp server. Flamelash is fine.
---
Orc priests?  Now your just making shit up,
---
That’s exactly what I was saying but people are retarded I guess. No surprise with all the brain dead horde in this thread. Barrens is not a contested zone. Ratchet being neutral is 100% irrelevant because we’re talking about ganking on the boat. Horde aren’t flagged 100% of the trip like alliance are in wetlands to theramore.
---
It's just your typical SM/Ruin build but the one where you take curse of exhaustion and 3 points into the improved talent.
---
It's kind of crazy to me that it's acceptable for tanks to reserve items everyone can use, but it seems like it's not acceptable to let people roll on those and to ask for vendor blues instead. An Orb goes for 3 to 4 times the amount of gold than vendor trash would get me. Seems like the "good manners" thing to do is reserve more value than I would get with blues...?
---
Hrm, don't see getting good, or quotations in there.  Maybe, learn how to read.
---
the question here is rather if you are sure it wasn't the same ID, because i think a lot of people misunderstand how DM tribute works.
---
once you have defeated the king, all the ogres bar the last set before i believe his name is captain kromkrush and a set of ogres somewhat near the entrance as well as guard slipkik turn non-hostile, **but these few stay hostile until you have the king buff** which is received from talking to the mizzy the crafty dude at the end of the instance, all of them will have red names as if they were hostile, **but the majority won't attack you but appear hostile**. there's a quick way to see if they attack you or not by hovering over their model to see if your cursor turns into a sword or not. additionally if you: enter with ANYTHING, relog, die, ANYTHING and you don't have the king buff, this same thing happens. so if you enter with your alt it looks like you are inside a different dungeon, but is in fact the same ID.
---
someone already said this but you will likely need one/two invis pots (lesser invis + invis pot, share the regular 2 min pot cd) to get through some of the mobs that are still hostile, depending on what class you play, the situation changes. **the scorpions/insects are always hostile even with king buff.**
---
The whole point of activision buying blizzard was to cash in on the "blizzard quality" idea, it's the product blizzard cultivated and sold to them. They will convert it into profit and leave the company a husk, then go buy a new company that has gained a following.

No no no, you're supposed to be mad and outraged at Blizzard because they didn't give you what you wanted. Get with the times.

I guess thats karma for you for ganking 300+ lvl 50's lol

Isnt there some meme-pve server you can roll on to prevent stuff like this? You were probably one of the purists yelling #nochanges and are now crying. Blizzard are already threatening to suspend ppl that uses MC/mc-caps to pvp-flag people. You think you do but you dont.
---
Yeah I have a lot of respect for the alliance here on Razorgore. Outnumbered but certainly not outgunned.
---
Nice comments about druids not being able to use oils or nades in bear form, no shit?
---
Obviously you can nade in casterform prepull, pop an oil of immolation then go bear.
---
You should pre-hot yourself anyway for bigger pulls since the selfhealing gives threat.
---
Yeah vanilla has shit game design
---
We all knew this.
---
Hate retail and love classic.
---
Could we hear your guided take?
---
Triggered horde are triggered.
---
so the increased aggro from defiance and shiled slam is not producing more ae aggro in the end?
---
i never was skilled as a prot warrior so a absolutely have no experiance in this :)
---
&gt;" AoE tanking with a warrior is an art form "
---
well said:)  
---
aoe tanking requires pretty much actions\^\^
---
i mostly start the pulls like this:
---
charge --&gt; Thunderclap --&gt; Berserker Stance --&gt; Berserker Rage --&gt; Whirlwind --&gt; Def Stance --&gt; Bloodrage --&gt; demo Shout --&gt; an then spamming cleave + revenge tabbing through the mobs
---
mostly it works really good this way and the dps rarely pull aggro even if i do not mark anything :)
---
but the damage income on me is insane \^\^ 
---
in some dungeons my heal needs to drink after every pull so i am thinking we might be faster if i would be specced into prot?
---
and i hate bow pulls because DPS won't wait a second to let me aquire aggro :D
---
sometimes spamming demo shout also works good on pulls with many mobs.
---
Is people are losing HKs, that’s one thing. But if people think they are losing honor because their estimated honor is more than what actually goes into their weekly total, then it’s probably working as intended. You receive less honor each time you kill the same person.
---
Vengeance depends on your final crit chance. If you can get to around 20% crit, then it's pretty good.
---
What seal rotation? You use and judge command. If oyu feel the fights going to be a long one, you can judge light or wisdom to help you sustain. 
---
Why choose the 39 bracket? I'm not a big fan of it, your lvl 30 talent isbasically worthless at that level, while other classes get strong abilities and paladin power level falls off quite noticeably towards the late 30s. I'd rather recommend the lvl 29 bracket, as that's where paladins are at the height of their power and 29 also isn't as heavily dominated by engineering as 39.
---
I second this as the best worst way to get there
---
At least most everyone lost their honor gain which should not set you back too far in Terms of brackets
---
You look like a party ready for an epic quest to find the mythical Print Screen button
---
I actually don't think that special case of not undoing players actions is "subpar support", I think it is how it should be. As a player I have to think before doing something. If I knew that I could always write a ticket after fucking up I wouldn't have to worry about anything anymore.
---
Yes of course, there's always that extra flat 5% hp. People like to say it doesn't matter, but it definitely does.
---
Kinda blows my mind the amount of people that consider PvP a ‘waste of time’ because they’re not getting rewarded for it. If the only reason you ‘farm’ your honor is for rewards, then why even bother? Do something you enjoy doing.
---
I should mention that I'm a Gnome so I can get out of slows every 60 sec. And since I'm alliance, all my enemies have WotF. So if I was undead and could easily fear juggle anyone, I'd agree. But for those fear immune melee I need to slow them and kite during their immunity.
---
If you're going to bitch about faction balance then pick a server that is more balanced or favours your faction. My server is 50:50.
---
Does any rogue-players have a link/guide where I can read up end-game stuff such as what to do in/for raids, what are hit/crits chances and why/how much I need, etc etc?
---
First time playing WoW and I’m almost level 60(level 56 at the moment) and I’m clueless about endgame stuff.
---
Its great. Get it on a slow weapon since the proc is ppm based instead of %.
---
Big picture yes.  But in the realm of what is going to get things fixed, dissatisfied customers are the only things that matter :(
---
I don't think it's efficient though. If you're referring to the jail area, the pulls are quite hard at 52 even, and the area has shitloads of patrols. As a healer you can afford to be a bit lower, but if you got a level 50 tank for that it's going to be a very, very slow run. At that point, you're better off doing Mara or ST which will go much more fluid (though you can't do last boss of ST yet as a 50 tank).
---
Bro after reading you play 16-18 hours a day, please consider playing less. That shit will fuck you up and is not healthy, rank 14 aint worth it man!
---
&gt;my aggro management is awful
---
That's a skill you learn. Slowly you'll intuitively be managing it with VW (or a tank) without feeling it.
---
It actually feels good to be able to squeeze out as much DPS while knowing not to pull threat.
---
&gt;soul-shard farming seems annoying as a mechanic as a spell-casting class.
---
Most of your damage while leveling comes from DoTs. You can simply Drain Soul every other mob and keep your supply flowing.
---
P.S. You can keep a Felcloth bag in your bag filled with shards to avoid the pre-raid grind. Refill the used shards through dungeons / farming gold.
---
I did 55-60 in BRD once p2 dropped. Haha
---
The fact that the same thing happened in the last 15 years.
---
You think Blizzard would just say "oh yeah, every single PvE server has a queue, no new servers for u lol get fucked"?
---
I mean you don't need LBRS to lvl up 60. BRD was my option untill lvl 59.
---
Depends on the queue. If its 60 minutes, there is no reason, why they would not roam.
---
Last night I was healing our 5 man wpvp 1 pally 2 mage 1 lock 1 rogue. We usually hsve a warr mixed in too but it went well
---
Yea I got a warlock to 10 recently, so boring. Rolled a warrior, got him to lvl30, having a blast all the way
---
Besides dungeons (ST or BRD):
---
Ungoro at 54, out at 55, Feralas next - skipped plaguelands completely for later (gold for quests)
---
 [Actually, it is.](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/is-irregardless-a-real-word-heh-heh) 
---
I think the issue for most is that it wasn't a word for a long time and change is hard to accept.
---
It's the same reason that "literally" literally doesn't always mean literally anymore. So many folks used it incorrectly that the incorrect use is now a correct use in the modern vernacular.
---
It's the same reason bootylicious made its way into the Oxford English dictionary.
---
Goldbuyers are what ruins mmos.  You create more bots, dilute the social experience, rob yourself of experience, its a lose lose.  Thanks for maling the genre worse
---
Didn’t notice you weren’t the op
---
I've been on the paladin side of that. Levelling as a priest with a rogue friend on a pvp server, I'd flag and wait to be attacked then he'd jump in.
---
The only one bitching right now is you xD
---
Of course I am going to reroll on a new Server xD Listen to yourself you dumbass.
---
I am not bitching I just stated the way it is. Of course it is easy for you to be happy when your faction is literally Camping all flight Points.
---
Haha just hilarious how stupid you are :D 
---
Where do you even get that info from there is literally no certain info on faction Balance. Every Website gives completely opposite Information xD
---
They'd offer transfers to PvP servers knowing their recent shenanigans.
---
Yeah we often have one dude dying so far up that noone can reach to ressurect, and then everyone portals back to Orgrimmar while they corpse run
---
lol, imagine being this guy.
---
That’s true I don’t like brd very much in general looks pretty boring and is so long. I feel like the overall xp per hour is just terrible in comparison to other dungeons
---
How is farming as a warlock? one of the biggest draws to other glass cannon classes is the viability of AOE farming (usually as a mage), are there enough farming spots supported by their mechanics which makes warlocks the top dog for generating gold?
---
Tho I feel somewhat sorry for you, as you invested time to farm and this is taken away from you, I think that too many people feel entitled nowadays. Yeah sure it's sad, but I would never had thought of opening a thread just to complain how a company has "robbed" me. For this means you don't really enjoy the game anyway and more have a problem of compensating by being good in a video game.
---
Ok you lost your honor, now say "damit" and start from scratch
---
US
---
You're my hero! Thanks so much
---
Not getting ganked anymore on my lvl 50 because "honor" isn't working *is* progress, thanks.
---
At level 20, go to westfall for the Defias chain that takes you into the deadmines and sets you up for the stockade quests. When rested, a run of a single instance of appropriate level is easily a third to half a level in XP, possibly even more. I have an alt (on horde side) parked at Xroads just to do WC runs and it's taken him from 17 - 21 in exactly four runs.
---
Well If there's a more hardcore game then this is all surely fine. The fact that I can't play the game doesn't matter, I should just be grateful I Also don't demote back to level 1 from 60. Great.
---
It is, but it also won't be available until phase 5 from what I've read
---
Bg's ll be cross realm so doesn't really matter what server are you on.
---
If queues ll make horde quit, then i can't wait. So many alliance players are only raid loging or quit cuz of the mess in the world.
---
You do know honor has diminishing returns right?
---
Im out roaming everyday. If youre not in a 10man yourself on either side youre getting jumped. Constant pvp at searing gorge, brm, epl.
---
I really don't have a idea what this is good for. Nothing I guess, but I like that you set yourself a goal and achieved it.
---
Take tank 2 or 3 mages and a healer. Start clearing 8-shaoe route around prison block and Arena. When you finish go to arena, then head out and reset instance. Repeat.
---
From this description I'm pretty sure you are not playing warrior (100% certainty) / hunter (80% certainty) / rogue (60% certainty) / paladin (100% certainty) / druid (100% certainty)
---
&gt;For most bosses, is it as simple as spamming Rank 4/5 Healing Touch on my assigned group? When dungeon healing, putting a regrowth then a rejuv on tank means I can take a back seat for a few seconds, and the 5 second rule kicks in, but watching streams, regrowth doesn't often get used. Are there situations where HoTs are far more appropriate than others (Baron Geddon for example)?
---
I almost never use regrowth in PVE.  Some other druids will disagree with me on this, but I tend to use rank 4/rank 7 healing touch and rejuv.  When I'm deep resto I use swiftmend as well.
---
Regrowth is extremely mana intensive.. you can get out lots of healing with it, but I do ~1 hour MCs and I'd rather save mana to keep the group moving.
---
&gt;In a similar vein, does + healing affect HoT ticks? I can't seem to find a consistent answer on this
---
&gt;Does Tranquility ever have a purpose, or should I blow it off?
---
Don't spend any talents on it, but it can be useful.  I have my raid frames organized by group, if my group ever is all at half life or so I pop tranquility.  That's a rare occurrence though.
---
&gt;Other than mana pots, are there any druid specific consumables I could/should bring to make it easier for myself?
---
Dark Runes/Demonic Runes and Major Mana Potions are the only consumables I use.  You can flask, but it's not really necessary at this stage of the game.
---
&gt;Again, similar to previous post, what add-ons do people recommend? I've been told "Heal Com" is a necessity?
---
If your guild requires it, use it.  Deadly Boss Mods is also useful.. tells you what to do during fights.
---
Awesome video. Two questions. Addon or setting that shows the amount about to be healed in green in raid frames. And the “ability is ready now!” Addon (which I have a different version of but I feel like doesn’t do the trick as much) thanks!
---
yeah well thats ur problem bud. #nochanges
---
K
---
Absolutely, i delete my char at least 3 times before i'm happy, taking the portrait into consideration as well. All depending on what class i'm rolling too.
---
Ya I’m starting to see that now
---
" Gives you a 100% chance to gain an extra attack after being the victim of a critical strike. "
---
Resetting the swing timer on a swing that's nearly finished hardly counts as an extra attack, so i'd say actually getting the extra attack is the correctly written behaviour
---
The Supreme Court was pivotal in the civil rights movement and they are a legal body which can interpret the constitution to include intelligent machines. Setting the precedence in the court would then help lobby Congress to include constructs in the bill of rights
---
Already did ST at 51, don't think I'll go back, groups were too hard to put together.  BRD next but not sure what part I can do a 54...
---
Might be true. When I'm out and about and randomly see a 4v4 or similar alliance always mops the floor. Even saw an alliance raid mop another horde raid otw to Ony. The teamwork of alliance is pretty amazing.
---
There wil always be complaints about everything regarding to PvP.
---
I love anti-horde shitposting, it's so hilarious seeing people like you get so fucking mad about words
---
Been killed by this exploit a few times. Really needs to be fixed.
---
Ret Paladin in Classic LOL.
---
Don't see why it has to be one over the other. They couldn't have done it without one another.
---
same, tanked on druid at 55
---
I'm no genius, but I think I figured out what's \*actually\* happening here  
---
I was playing from around midnight until 10AM, In that time I racked up about 150 honourable kills.  
---
At around 9am the server updated the honour for yesterday. Only 50 of my kills counted into 'yesterday' but on 'today' it still shows 100 HKs.  
---
I believe that the 'day' is stopping at 3am, but it's not being calculated until 9am, so you don't actually see those 3-8am kills until the following day, aka tomorrow.
---
One of the few changes in Cata that I enjoyed was that there was a questline in Azshara where he's missing. Turns out he was choosing to stay dead because adventurers kept murdering him and he was in a relationship with a spirit healer.
---
We exclusively get warrior and shaman helmet, every week same combination. Zero druid helmets and zero warlock in 6 weeks.
---
&gt; I’m playing 16-18 hour days here
---
You should take a hard look at your current life situation. Being a shut-in whose life consists of only sleep and WoW is very unhealthy, both physically and socially.
---
This has always infuriated me.
---
Hahahaha
---
People never quite expect a holy paladin in plate, for whatever reason.
---
I can only imagine the looks on peoples faces when I hit them with the crit holy shock/hammer of wrath combo.
---
I’m sure you Alliance will still find something to bitch about.
---
This is why I plan on rolling a female undead rogue at some point, those evic flips are awesome, plus I see to many undead males. This is coming from an alliance main since vanilla.
---
Idiot.
---
I understand your reasoning and it could well be true. However I reckon they wanted BGs out pre Christmas to quiet down people moaning for content and give them something to do over Christmas when a lot of people will be off work.
---
BGs are a lot more substantial than DM and world PvP and I'd think they can ride them for a fair while. Also if they smash their way through releasing all the vanilla content they'll run out of stuff for people to do a lot sooner which shortens the Classic lifespan.
---
This is why nelf priests exist, ladies and gentlemen.  You may not get fear ward, but shadowmeld MC is a very potent laugh machine.
---
Which english european PVE realm has the most horde players?
---
I'm assuming Honorspy takes that into account?
---
&gt;If someone enters a important password for a service, it’s on them to remember it.
---
What?
---
&gt;Somehow humans make mistakes. And most company’s will try to make their customer happy and solve issues, even if it’s on the customer.
---
I kind of agree, but you won't get a new phone if you destroyed yours willingly. Blizzard probably wants happy customers and it's shitty that they let go of so many supporters, but I don't think that restoring items willingly sold by players is something they should deal with. There are actual fuck-ups happening they should take care of. You have to set priorities. Once they start restoring sold items for one person, they'd have to do it for everyone.
---
realm transfers from alliance-heavy to alliance-light servers for alliance players.
---
50:50 unless you got sOuRcEs
---
Run BRD a couple times once you pick up all the quests.  Since you're on a PvE server, you still have access to all the quests so just carry on as normal.
---
BRD can be a very lengthy dungeon run, and I don't advise it unless you LOVE the place.
---
&gt; I enjoy my 9-5 job but if I stopped getting paid, I’d be pissed and quit.
---
If this is an apt analogy for your WoW playing, you should quit right now.
---
But greedisgood is something we learned from Wc3!
---
Not sure, but were they a Tauren?
---
Tauren's have larger models and so have slightly larger melee range.
---
Also it's good to understand what 'Leeway' is and how it works. [Video explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3GH5cWPFOE).  
---
I'm not sure, but you might be able to trigger Leeway whilst frozen if you're spamming your movement buttons.
---
are you trolling or do you genuinely think this is a good response to a bug report
---
_Thanks for the F Shack_, signed Dirty Mike and the Boys.
---
I don't remember but basically you just buy a bunch of greens that give +shadow damage. I also had Dreamweave Vest and Dreamweave Gloves which gives 18 spell damage each.
---
Interesting, thanks! So I definitely need to get more +shadow damage gear. Do you by chance remember what gear you had?
---
And btw it says “+ UP TO ___ shadow damage.” What’s up with that? Like my staff says +up to 17 shadow damage. Does that mean sometimes it gives me less?
---
And yep I drain life too
---
Good to hear, hope it will continue.
---
PvP on a PvP server
---
I make $70k+ a year and pay my bills and my girlfriends plus have 3-4 months vacation to play wow all day.  How about you suck my nuts dumbass.  I’m literally the embodiment of capitalism you ignorant tool.
---
Is that firemaw?
---
Might seek out the Rogue discord, I assume there is one. I am in warrior, hunter, and lock discords and they have a lot of the info
---
With a curse of shadows they stop breaking fear all the time. 
---
Just fear and dot and nuke.
---
Am I the only one who read the parts where they acknowledged the problem, admitted they're working on it, explained that they cannot (or choose not to) simply add HKs as the subscriber is asking, and then suggests an additional method of resolution in order to elevate his issue (bug reports)?
---
This is what you think most people dream of?
---
Again you miss the point. They don't need you to submit it as a bug. The GM is suggesting that they submit as a bug so it attracts more attention faster.
---
Rumor is honor between 3am to 7am server falls into a blackhole and is never calculated.
---
Alchemy is not a big money-maker on my server. Potion prices are very close to the ingredient prices, so you mainly have to use transmutes to make money, which gives it something like a 30-40g income every 2 days or so at best.
---
Maybe, but horde also have a much nicer time in wpvp overall so they have less to really complain about.
---
Every time though I see an alliance complain I always see a massive comment chain below of it some horde typing HEARTSEEKER in all caps and complaining about something too.  Horde are still bitching en masse, they're just bitching that their woes aren't taken seriously by alliance.
---
I ended up buying a gaming mouse with like 20 keys on the side bc i wanted all of my curses to be a mouseclick away. Logitech has one for 30 bucks and it’s awesome
---
read the video description - I think it's more so the point that he enjoys world pvp in a more fair, enjoyable fight. 20v1 isnt fun for anyone, no matter what faction you are. I play horde and we pretty  much own our server, but i agree it's fucking boring
---
Was talking something else, however, yeah, the wrong name is really an embarrassment.
---
lol you’re a walking meme
---
I accidentally disenchanted an item I was trying to enchant and they restored it
---
&gt; doe
---
Sorry what does a female deer have to do with this?
---
Definetely, not like Alliance players all group up in 40 man raids
---
Rogues aren't especially good in premades, so they'll likely still be camping flightpaths half the time anyway.
---
I bet that’s what it was. We were running through mobs so fast that often my curse of agony was only on them for a few seconds each. Shoulda just been spamming SB and AOE
---
So you had a chance to leave, you decided to start a fight, get baited, then cry on reddit?  Mods delete this please.
---
Nope
---
Ah. Funny feature.
---
I'll have to run it once, see how I like it!
---
When you get paid to do a job and dont do it
---
No. It just means no one transfers at all.
---
Both your original comment and your edit are incorrect. The /startattack /stopattack macro causes both HoJ AND Reckoning to deliver 1 more attack than intended. So with reckoning, if you get crit once it will cause your next attack to swing **3 times** instead of twice. If you get crit twice, you will swing 4 times instead of 3, etc.
---
This stacks with HoJ. If you get crit once and proc HoJ, you will swing once normally, twice from reckoning, and twice from HoJ for a total of 5 attacks.
---
Can you link the talent calculator for this please?
---
That doesn’t make it any better dude.
---
So ... your name is gnomestomper? j/k
---
Jeez, so many useless comments in here. You guys don't know this guy, you don't know if he works seasonally and has a lot of free time, if he was in circumstances which didn't let him work/study/do something else. I don't remember him asking for life advice either. Also, stuff like "lul those kills came from camping karma bitch xdddd" is straight up childish.
---
Op, not much you can do besides identifying the the bugged window and avoid farming in it, maybe get some gold/ consumes in that window. It sucks but, like anything that gets blown out of proportion on this sub, it will get fixed eventually. Happy grinding!
---
Careful. And I'm being serious here, if you ask for this to be escalated you'll be given an official warning and be threatened with "further action" against your account.
---
Alliance has the best pvp racials and the 2 op healers dwarf priest/pala... but sure
---
I'm not sure where the alliance graveyard is, but that is where horde's is.  But i feel like we may share graveyards?
---
This is the new meta, people whining about whiners. The forums have lots of these posts lol.
---
we are all blizzard's beefybits and they are our crunchycircuitbits since its all fucking bots auto responding to tickets it seems xD
---
You have no idea what this persons situation is. Try being a keyboard warrior less.
---
An AHK macro that repeats a keypress when held down will perform for you "one button press" which will yeld one action in game. So my opinion is it should be OK, but I'm no legal expert and probably this could be argued against also.
---
You dont even know the right ratios of people and all you claim is 10:1
---
Thank you
---
You're missing the point too.  
---
The point is that the user submitted a complaint and the response was we can't do anything you have to do "More PvP and submit bug report"  It's an insane response from a company.  
---
Again, if a GM has to suggest you submit it as a bug it should instead automatically generate a bug report.  This is not he user's problem.  You're acting like the user is sitting there like they need the honor and they should be acting on their own interest to get it.  NO.  The user doesn't need the honor, they need the game to work.  They don't need to submit a bug report, they don't need to put in a ticket, they don't need to 'pvp more', they also don't need to pay monthly for a game where they get no support and instead are told to do more of the activity that isn't work and to do more work for the company to 'attract attention faster' on an issue that is clearly already known and should be handled internally by the company.  Again the onus is absolutely NOT on the user.  The response entirely throws it back on the user, which is unacceptable for a paid service.  It's insane you are defending this..
---
The horde version is still being made it’s far more complicated :p
---
Sorry about him.
---
Why did I read that in the Navy seal copypasta voice
---
My recollection from vanilla was the horde dominated BGs but it’s been a long time so maybe I’m wrong lol
---
I’d have to log in to check exactly what they are, but I have a pet attack cast corruption with one click macro that I like and !shoot is nice for your wand because you can spam it even during global CD and it will start shooting the first instant it’s available
---
No, because holding is not pressing once per action.
---
I'm ready for queues to be a little longer on horde but not too bad, since faction balance is nearly 50/50 between horde and alliance. 
---
We all already know AV is ally dominated.
---
We already know that half the PvP servers are horde dominated, the other half are 50/50 or ally dominated. 
---
We already know that a vocal minority complains on Reddit. 
---
We already know that wpvp and frustration isnt faction specific. 
---
We already know that both factions camp, control fps, and roam in raids equally. 
---
TL:DR - we already know that both factions are plagued woth morons and whiners. We also know that mathematically there is zero reason to think that queues will be ridiculously longer for horde due to overall population. 
---
OP, thanks for the stupid thread of the day.
---
Up to means it depends on the spell used. Some spells get 100% of your bonus spelldmg, some less. Ea I think corruption gets 100%, while your shadow bolt gets 85%. 
---
So you always get the number you see on the item, but it affects different spells differently :)
---
the fact that non-warriors (at least on horde side) have to wait ages until they find a tank is consolation prize enough...
---
I can upload 20 movies with the same but reverse pov. Stop crying horde and alliance both indulge in this current wpvp honorgrind nonsence
---
Warlocks are insane in PvP.
---
At first you'll suck for sure, but that's because the learning curve is steep. You have so many tools that you need to learn them and keep them all in your mind.
---
I'd always go for warlock over druid.
---
This comment section is filled with butthurt toddlers who cry when getting ganked on a pvp server. Just fuck off honestly.
---
I don't know how I can get you to read what I wrote and understand it so I'm not going to discuss this anymore. I've explained how it works but you're trying to paint some scenario that isn't real just so you can be outraged.
---
Exactly. Here is a full list of the spell coefficients of a warlock:
---
Shadowbolt - 3/3.5 - 85.71%
---
Soul Fire - 3.5/3.5 - 100%
---
Searing Pain - 1.5/3.5 - 42.85%
---
Immolate Direct: (2/3.5)\*(2/3.5) / (2/3.5 + 15/15) = 18.65%
---
Immolate DoT: (15/15)\*(15/15) / (2/3.5 + 15/15) = 63.63% - 12.72% per tick (5)
---
Conflagrate - 1.5/3.5 - 42.85%
---
Rain of Fire - 3.5/3.5/3 - 33% - 8.25% per tick (4)
---
Hellfire - 3.5/3.5/3 - 33% - 2.2% per tick (15)
---
Corruption - 15/15 - 100% - 16.66% per tick (6)
---
Curse of Agony - 15/15 - 100% - 8.33 per tick (12)
---
Curse of Doom - 15/15 - 100%
---
Drain Soul - 15/15 - 100% - 20% per tick (5)
---
Siphon Life - 15/15/2 - 50% - 5% per tick (10)
---
Drain Life - 3.5/3.5/2 - 50% - 10% per tick (5)
---
Death Coil - 1.5/3.5/2 - 21.42%
---
Shadowburn - 1.5/3.5 - 42.85%
---
Wholesome.
---
If he is happy why are people shitting on him. He isnt ruining his life, he has a plan and he is doing it. So yea I think most people dream of having a plan and actually following through with it.
---
Enh up to 40 and then switch to ele and build it into a 31/0/20 build.
---
You obviously aren't even reading my responses.  So I don't know why I bothered.  Stop defending shitty customer support.
---
I don’t think you have heard him sing. Guy has an awesome voice.
---
Being able to do anything you want for 4 months and still do well financially I assume
---
got a link to the one you bought?
---
You do you but that isn't most people's dream, and likely not your family's dream either.
---
Wow, thanks for the nightmare fuel.
---
You didn't read what I said.
---
There is no sure data on Server faction Balance.
---
You can check Wowhead which says 50:50 (Using Census) and then check Wowpopulation (also using Census to collect data) which says 70:30...
---
We cannot tell for sure what the faction Balance is we can only make good guesses. While it might be true that your Server is 50:50 or very Close to it. It probably isn't.
---
Cannot tell.
---
And just because your Server is sort of balanced that doesn't still make the Problem any better for any other Server that is 70:30 or whatever.
---
You are like a rich Person going around laughing at poor People as if they Chose to be poor and never earn a lot of Money xD
---
I Chose a Server which is PVP because I love PVP in retail as I loved in in Classic.
---
Nowadays Version of PVP in Classic doesn't even come Close. I could not have anticipated such imbalance. I was taking into account that there is more Players on a Server but the imbalance just hits randomly. Nothing any Player can do.
---
You judging People on that and telling them they just don't like PVP is simply wrong and stupid sorry.
---
You are looking down from your perfect perspective while the others have to deal with their shit. AND your shit you are giving them because you are playing on a great Server.
---
So full of bullshit you should really stop writing because all you Sound like is like a dick who is really unaware of what is going on anywhere outside of your Server :P
---
And again wowhead data is bullshit data. The simple fact that you think that this is Close to true data at all already Shows me how Little I should Interpret into what you are  writing because it doesn't seem you have a clue at all
---
Unrelated to them mattering fuck all.
---
The program will interpret button presses, which will give one action. So yes. Our point of view is different. I guess that is what you mean?
---
Shocker, the depressed guy that plays WoW for 16-18 hours a day is a dick to other people.
---
Wow classic is a meme bro, maybe spend those hours on a  real game like Fortnight.
---
"the insane" title I believe
---
Unfortunately that's how Vanilla was, and that's how Classic will be. Everyone knew this going in, they were making as few changes to the game as possible. For better or worse, that's just how it is, and for every person telling Blizzard to "fix" something, there's ten more telling them to keep it the same.
---
Don't think it's possible in this classic meta. You really are not that in demand, there are a lot of warriors who can tank dungeons without dying and will greed not need on everything. People are not that desperate
---
Think what you want but I've read it and you're clearly not following along. Take care
---
Does anyone have any decent PVP/PVE hybrid spec?
---
Soul Link/Nightfall is great for PVP but I guess no one will take me raiding with this. Is there any halfway viable spec for going on an occasional raid but being able to survive The PVP massacre? Soul Link/Shadowburn maybe?
---
My yesterday tab has been wrong since the patch. That being said, my honor has been correct every week.

All these campers getting their honored wiped, karma.

Imagine tanking your own life for video game accomplishments. Mega yikes.

If you read his other comment you would see he does all that. Its fummy how if someone is better than you he has no life and if he is worse then he is a casual. Grow the fuck up and stop assuming shit
---
Well you cant use it at 20 so thats a problem...
---
But it procs way more than 3% according to my recount
---
This is actually pretty reasonable, considering a day does have a cutoff of 12AM. So it sounds like it's not a big, just people not understanding how calculations are done.
---
Blizzard's PoV, not my own. That's just how it is.

Do you still work for Blizzard?
---
(I think probably not, but needs to be asked.)
---
I'm from the east coast and play on a west coast server, and have lately mostly been playing in the mornings. Later in the day its impossible to quest so I've been dungeon grinding
---
Thats the way its always been on psersers.
---
Your rage generation has to be insane if you are not able to dump your rage before dancing. Bloodthirst + HS/Cleave dump your rage really fast. Also getting rage for ww takes like 1 second since you use berserker rage anyway.
---
As dps I still charge and delay my berserker stance until first Bloodthirst which also takes like max. 1 second to get the rage for that. So I basically lose 3% Crit on my first 3 hits or something. 20% weaker crits is probably the biggest loss. Ofc it's worse for dps compared to the dedicated dps build, but not "shit" at all.

I’m sitting at the same standing as I finished last week according to honorspy but that’s beside the point :(.

Why are you defending them?  Can you answer that?  The response is bullshit and you know it.

Thank you!  I live in OKC btw.  I assume you’re from OK?

Its pretty easy to get xp groups at 56

Bold of you to assume Alliance can even step on Tirisfal's grounds and stay alive :P
---
I believe so yes.

I don't dislike going to work every monday, and i wouldn't dislike being able to do something else either. It doesn't matter, really.

As long as you have your priorities straight, do whatever you want with your free time lol

A Hunter PvP question:
---
How should I open fights? Obviously I want to be at range and the aggressor. But when everybody is mounted most of the time, is there anything I can do to actually force a fight at range?
---
The alternative would be to just run into them and Scatter-Trapping, but being 2 ccs down isn't great against most classes.
---
I actually ragequit WoW for about a year back in vanilla over a similar interaction with Blizzard customer support.  I was having a horrible time with lvl 60 pvp because I didn’t raid, so I was outmatched in gear, and I didn’t have a guild that wanted to pvp, so I would join solo and our pug would get rolled by premade.  So anyways, I finally won an Arathi Basin game after several fruitless hours, and I didn’t get my marks.  This was a known bug at the time (I had run into this before) and the CS rep says “you have previously gotten a refund for this bug.  We have a policy of only doing this once”.  No amount if arguing with him would change his mind.  I was soooo frustrated.  At a certain point I even used profanity (not directly at him, more like “this is a shitty policy”) and all he said in response was to threaten that using profanity with him could cause my account to be suspended.  Wrong answer.  I was so fucking frustrated and angry I quit immediately and didn’t come back until right before BC.  A lot of people probably think “big deal, they don’t care”.  But I was away from the game for about a year.  Which means they list out on about 180 dollars of revenue.  I don’t think that is trivial money...
---
I think the issue here is that you're using the word "max" a lot. It is very possible for a raid to take an hour to come together and then for the clear or fail itself to take longer than 2 hours.
---
Can do btw do farms from 52 to 60 as well
---
It's very obvious this is done to troll people and not because it's a legitimate word. 
---
Pandering to idiots and trolling "intellectuals" (theres at least a solid argument why you shouldn't use irregardless) isn't very becoming of an organization like Merriam.
---
So using irregardless still makes you look like an idiot.
---
Heartseeker being imbalanced means there's somewhere for the Horde to go. They don't want to go there because it's imbalanced. I don't blame them. 
---
So you give them a choice: go to Heartseeker or don't play.
---
This is just the no lifer tax. Go to sleep ya fucking sweats

---
Haste effects in Classic are not calculated by something like `WeaponSpeed-(WeaponSpeed*Haste)`, it's with `WeaponSpeed/(1+Haste)` because you're getting x% more attacks in some timeframe.  
---
In this case, with a 13% quiver, Rhok will have a speed of `2.9/1.13=2.566`
---
Be ready for ally complaining about still getting ganked in the world because there is queues.
---
Again - how the players act is not blizzards fault. Classic is classic. You chose a PvP server, either reroll or quit bitching.
---
You’re on the internet psycho analyzing a stranger.  You’re a fucking loser.
---
Im trying to sound edgy. How did i do?
---
There's a set of quests that starts with 'The Greenwarden' in Menethil that's your level. That should get you closer to the next wave of quests.
---
My raid healing gear is worthless in pvp, it’s super glass cannon. You have to get a totally different set with better stamina starting if you really want to survive. Which tends to be dps gear.
---
Casual I think PVE is the right choice. Why have to worry about being ganked all the time. Class? whatever you like to play.
---
Sentinel Hill in Westfall
---
BG's are released and after a few days, r/classicwow is absolutely filled with posts by 1 particular faction complaining that they always get stomped.  
---
In late December it will be announced that phase 3 will launch in January.  The day phase 3 launches, r/classicwow will become r/thunderfuryspam.
---
Just spirithealer rezz you get poped back to the graveyard your ghost spawned at
---
If you are SL at all, you've pretty much full-committed to pvp. The best PVE/PVP hybrid spec IMO is SM-Ruin. You get to keep the pet for pvp, and you get nightfall and hard hitting dots.
---
Yes you will be fine.  You may need to Eat/Drink a bit more while you are solo but you'll melt things and have a good build for 5 mans.   I leveled more Affliction/Demo, but as soon as I had the points to go 0/21/21 I switched to DS/ruin, then filled out the affliction talents on the final levels. 
---
Even though you are DS build you can still use the void walker while solo.  I found the 30% extra threat  from improved Void and Sacrifice shield was very helpful with the demo talents you need to "waste" on the way to getting DS.   When better geared just sac it for HP regen when not grouped.
---
Wrong, it's two people with the lowest GUIDs. Me and another rogue are the only ones to get knocked back and we get it 100% of the time.
---
Thanks :)
---
Yea but 35 to 40k is trash when you can get 80k in st and 80 to 100k in brd
---
Yup I got three and none are 60 👍
---
WTS foilhat
---
Yea people are correct you should clip but because rhok is on the edge it actually won’t make a huge difference in dps either way you do it. Not clipping is much more important with slower weapons and will result in much higher dps.
---
thank you!  
---
the healing addon is called "healcomm", its awesome :)
---
the combat log addon is called "mik's scrolling battle text"
---
jamflex bad

Don't put DoTs on trash. Only on bosses.
---
Spam SBs on trash.
---
Cringe
---
I don’t even bother with world buffs, maybe when BWL comes out.
---
As another healer I suspect the only reason I’m rank 4 is because I have very pvp agressive guildies who drag me around with them.
---
It’s hard out by myself in the world even if I enjoy wpvp. Looking forward to bgs for honor gain whenever.
---
Thank you :D
---
I definitely won't since I don't expect myself visiting any BG ever. I haven't paid a lot of attention to reputation rewards though but I am sure I won't rank there.
---
I guess the saying ”don’t play with shitters” applies here. Most experienced players have probably played both dps and healing classes and know how to use the scoreboard to assess performance of the team and players.
---
&gt; Classic was a cash grab
---
Is that why it took a few years to develop, has a small niche userbase and no microtransactions of any kind? Because it's a "cash grab" ?
---
Pick a PvE server for casual play. The RP servers can be pretty chill from what I hear but I have no experience playing on them.
---
As for a class suggestion pick something that looks fun, you'll be alright. (I'd avoid warriors though)
---
No mcp is better and with no agi enchant weapon from dmn is better too
---
The restored it so I wouldn't worry about it. Tho thy did say they would only restore one item every x (30???) Days.

Things I won't need in combat, ie summoning, I leave unbound to a key on the far right action bar to be clicked.
---
Also I've heard of people binding their mouse wheel to certain actions. I haven't personally tried it.
---
Warden isn't even an upgrade right now because you can't enchant it and you can put counter weight on maul
---
yeah but it looks like a bunch of alliance noobs came horde this time around which is frustrating
---
The GM can escalate the issue. Of course, it's company policy not to do that - just like it might be company policy that GM's don't have access to certain values. But it all comes down to Blizzard deciding that fixing things like this isn't worth it. The problem isn't the GM (obviously), it's Blizzard.
---
Kill them, and catch them on the respawn for that sweet, sweet honor.
---
It's better than letting them get a 30 second head start away from your camping spot.
---
They'll just hire a couple hundred DBA's earning 80k plus each to write custom SQL statements for each character :P
---
I never understood the AV bridge meme.  Horde have a building which dismounts you and then forces players through a small door to then head directly up a path which both guard towers can easily overlook and attack from.
---
Have bought my lionheart helm mats this way, youre also able to get lucky with twink drops. 25g usually for weapons.
---
Most of the PVE community at this point is pretty decked out in On/MC gear so fury tanking is OK if the healer is comfortable with it and they can hold threat (which, let's be real, if you're charging first orb/first 2 orbs as a DPS warrior you will probably be geared and therefore have the highest DPS in the group much of the time.) 
---
I get what you're saying though, last night we did a guild run in LBRS for a fresh 60 shaman healer for Ony attunement and our tank (usually we're top 2 on the charts for DPS on our classes in raids) had to put on a shield, which I teased him about, and I had to switch to single target instead of aoeing the packs to accommodate the healer. Most fresh 60s aren't going to throw down for a tank, though.
---
you're not supposed to be in range to get knocked regardless, if you get knocked by wrath as melee DPS it's your fault
---
Like calling someone kemosabe lol
---
&gt; Where's the green +140 coming from? Even when I'm naked, I still have that +140 for power. 
---
You get a bit str per level.
---
But you are a warrior - maybe your battle shout? I think its around 140 at level60.
---
rage reduction on sunder is amazing, far stronger than rage reduction on heroic strike
---
There are alliance players too.
---
Yes wpvp honor system 
---
SUPER CEREAL OK?
---
According to Microsoft yes, but you can go download the win10 media creation tool to this day and upgrade with a license, I did it a month ago, champ. Definitely still works.
---
There is weather and there is feels like weather. It matters if its 40 degrees C if you cant breathe outside?
---
People also don’t wake up and say, “Thank god I have to work 80 hours this week, or work on a weekend.”  
---
If you work 80 hour weeks for 7-8 months a year, then you are actually working more hours than normal. 
---
I would much rather work 40 hour weeks and have every single afternoon, weekend, and weeks of vacation than murder myself for 8 months a year then hide in my room playing video games for 18 hours a day in between.  
---
I’m with others, sorry. It doesn’t sound healthy or enjoyable at all.
---
What are some good ways to 'boost' a mage while leveling?
---
Right now, I'm thinking of getting 100 mana on a chest piece, minor speed on some boots and +7 int on some bracers... Is there anything else I can throw into the mix besides those 3 enchants?  Obviously theres SP to weapon but I'm not spending the 100+g on mats for that.
---
The other thing, are there any "bis until 60" items I could grab along the way? Was thinking about getting a Staff of Jordan (w/ SP), anything else that might be worth it?
---
Ony was fixed for like a week or two but it looks like its bugged again.
---
“All of this is BS” is exactly what everyone said when Vanilla tanks where eating Demo Shout was busted.
---
The melee knockback does have a limit, but there is also a mana user knockback that is different and can chain onto melee if you stack ret paladins in your melee group.
---
If the servers weren't 5x the size of vanilla servers it'd be fine, no one could see that coming. also once BGs come out it'll be fine as well
---
2h queue is not an issue ? :)
---
Blame Blizzard, they designed the system to be this way originally and they chose to reimplement it without BG's at launch.
---
To each their own I'd be so bored on a pve server
---
Ha nice one. 
---
I love the "I have ankh, but I'm lying in the lava" at the end :D
---
If you say so.
---
Rp is likely to be best for casual, pvp servers u know, pve is generally for raiders who want to lvl in peace and rp is for people who generally care less about raiding and more about having fun with friends. Pve is also likely to be fine but i love pvp so im not sure which specific realms to choose.
---
Casual leveling id say warlock or priest, warlocks got lots of tools to make solo or grouping super fun and priests can solo most things (a bit slowly) but can get into any group no problem. If u are alliance paladins are solid at quest/solo and can also heal any group. Mage is good for lvling but i doubt ur interested in aoe grinding. Although in groups anyone can be an amazing mage. Press frostbolt for single target and press arcane explosions for multi, profit.
---
Mercy as the least dominant faction will get you killed.
---
I don't want to be a multi-boxer hard core player but I do want to casually level two characters at the same time on two accounts; what's the best way to do this?
---
Most multi boxing tutorials are to get set up so you can have like 5 elemental shamans all casting the same thing at once but what I want to do is to basically have a priest on /follow and be able to cast a few spells to help my main character without having to Alt_tab to a new window or move over to my 2nd laptop to hit the key. 
---
Basically I just want to have key bindings for two accounts/characters on one keyboard/screen. Is the only way to do this to dive head first into multi boxing or is there some sort of more simple addon I could use?
---
I guess mad cause bad?
---
Stockades is the best boosting dungeon in the game for it's bracket it's not useless at all.
---
There will always be complaints about anything* FTFY
---
Tbh, questing is great Bellow 48 for me, the only issue I've had is a level 45 shaman who was camping lower levels for honour
---
Teleport to graveyard wasn’t in classic.
---
I assumed the discord and the spreadsheet was already famous, No disrespect intended. I've added a link now.
---
Your analysis isn't wrong. The list is flawed, and it isn't trying to help people compete, so it could be said to be missing the point of the sheet entirely.
---
I just wanted to help some players that are bad like me avoid buying a sword of zeal or something equally misguided, for everyday raiding. If they're good players trying to compete for a top parse, then they should go beyond just looking at a list on Reddit, no disagreements there.
---
It’s for bragging rights.  It takes a ton of time to get the reputation needed for the hat and you need to sacrifice the use of any goblin city until you regrind their rep to do so.
---
Yeah, I’m the loser. Not the grown adult playing a 15 year old video game for 18 hours a day lmaaaaaao

People having no sympathy because he "probably got it camping a flightpath"
---
Do you really think honor grinders want to farm honor this way? Its boring as fuck but you cant blame us because if we dont do it we cant possibly keep up with those who do.
---
Might be...I'm on Herod and tank warriors are plentiful here, even if most of them dont tank in raids
---
So if i start a boycott bgs and dont queue in bgs more than necesarry to ruin their pvp experience will create more fun for Blizzard ? :)
---
I have a job that I really enjoy, so while I am not thanking God on Monday mornings, I am pleased that I have a great paying job that is challenging. I have plenty time to pursue my hobbies, but I happen to be of the opinion that doing anything 16-18 hours a day, for days on end, sounds pretty miserable, and doesn't foster good relational or physical health. It seems hard to balance when you have something taking up so much time and energy.  If your opinion differs that is fine, I just wanted to point out that far from 'most people' would consider what you are doing a dream.
---
Omegylul

If he has the job I’m thinking he does I would kill to have it.
---
How much would I be hindered on an RP realm of I wanted to try a bit of raiding nd PvP (BGs and maybe some organised wPvP)?
---
Can confirm - doing it as we speak
---
OK! Liked that one! 1 week after BG factions QQ about imbalance! Any 1 gonna risk and say its BS? Come on people! Don't be afraid!!
---
For MC you just need the 17 talents in prot, mostly LS, 1 in the shield talent, and 5 in the threat talent. Apart from that, youre mostly missing utility stuff (which I find nice to have if you dungeon run) like stun on half your revenges, single target long stun, extra defense (pretty rare stat if you make a balanced mitigation/threat set). Also note that shield bash is a very nice threat talent and the 31 fury likely doesnt compare until you gear up a good bit.
---
The one bit of advice I can offer is to not be a dumby about shield use. So many people think you can DW or 2h tank every bit of content. This may be true, but it will depend on your gear and it will depend on your healer. Going without a shield in greens and blues might mean youre not a tank, just some DPS that pulled aggro and will get splatted, or you will drain your healers mana every pull. Or even if you have good gear, you still take more damage than someone with a shield, and with a new healer, youll still burn their mana. Then again, even if you and the healer are geared, some pulls its just smarter to shield up because no amount of gear makes it efficient (this is probably more true in 5 mans where you can only have so much healing tossed your way).
---
lol cata version
---
As a TBC player vanilla is great because I feel like its really similar but Ive never done this content.  
---
Its like my favorite game with new content, amazing!
---
Fel puppy is a must. Try to get dots rolling early; this is primarily an attrition battle. If you're struggling with the high damage, it's not a bad idea to try for a full bandage when you can get a fear off. Searing pain is a good spammable even if you're not specced into it since you won't get kicked on shadow with it.
---
It's not a bad idea to run in the world with spell stone equipped. It has a pretty big shield, gets you out of freezes instantly, and last I checked it can even clear improved CS silence.
---
I also recommend you have two macros - one for dispel self, one for dispel target. I probably dispel myself the most against mages, they lose a lot of their reliable damage if you aren't frozen.
---
&gt; I'm thinking of getting 100 mana on a chest piece
---
waste, just get the lesser magic wand  
---
&gt; +7 int on some bracers  
---
waste, wand  
---
&gt; putting Fiery on a staff be worth it  
---
absolutely not, bc wand

&gt; Was thinking about getting a Staff of Jordan (w/ SP)

i dont know what youre smoking, AV is horde favored. people were just bad back then, it's going to be 90-10 horde winning
---
There are so few customization options in WoW that I figured out exactly what I like a long time ago and have always made all my characters the same dude. The aesthetic 100% matters for me in every game. I've remade max level characters with hundreds of hours of work put into them on several games over the years because I wasn't completely happy with how they looked.
---
So the same thing. Holding one button gives multiple clicks. I still think it's not unreasonable. If it would be then using scroll wheels would not be allowed.
---
Devilsaur leather.
---
How hard is it to track these metrics though? You’d think there would be weeks-long data storage.
---
Ok.. So far that bin true.. But give us some dates! When AQ40? ZG?
---
Raptors are made with Alchemy ?! Huh, didn't knew that.
---
With TSM, you can buy all your mats and craft them in like 10 min. Alchemy is great for passive income. Obviously depends on your server prices.
---
This thread makes me feel like a genius.
---
Well you surely knew that the game was designed that way since 15 years ago? How exactly is that Blizzard's fault now when the product people asked for was Vanilla wow?
---
nochanges except starting at 1.12 and buffing horde guards (??)
---
This is why I don't think it's bad manners, people are literally begging to pay me to tank at times. Taking some garbage no one wants seems better than taking advantage of this.
---
you're doing sunder on ~50% of globals all through a fight. If a fight lasts a minute that's 40 globals so 20 sunders or 60 rage.If 30 seconds than that's still 10 sunders or 30 rage.
---
Regardless of that, the first maybe 5 globals are super important for threat, so consider the situation where your first slam gets parried and you dodge the first 2 boss attacks and you're rage starved. This happens from time to time and you might lose aggro. So sunder is super useful.
---
If you're doing fury prot though, you gain offhand damage/rage by having heroic strike always in use. 3 points in heroic strike may make this more likely to happen. So that's why might prefer heroic strike over sunder armour, but in a dungeon or as a deep prot raid tank you'd most likely prefer sunder to heroic strike.
---
Go AOE farm the elite dragons in Winterspring for a chance at the Mature Blue Dragon Sinew and split the profit, it currently goes for 1k to 1.5k on my server and people are always buying it
---
Sell it for 1k and that's 200g for everyone, best you can do with a full group TBH.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18704/mature-blue-dragon-sinew
---
Are you saying that EVERY generic response has this horrid grammar?
---
So you would continue playing if every Tuesday with reset all your gear / gold / reputation was deleted?
---
There is quite a lot of drama about raid spots, looting and such on PvE. Maybe RP is better for casual experience.
---
There’s a bunch of undead/Tauren/troll only guilds on grobb though.
---
Probably not much, id go rppvp if ur looking for organized pvp, and there will likely be people raiding, just fewer options for guilds that do and likely not very fast/efficient runs (although u can certainly clear mc no prob)
---
Only if OP is horde.
---
They were not wrong. At the highest point my realm had about 15'000 players. I myself was at position 7000-something in queue in the first few days. Now total concurrent players is always lower. So a lot of people did stop playing again.
---
Obviously in hindsight you can tell how many realms it should have had at start. But they seemed to not have managed realm populations at all past september. When they were going to delayer my realm, it did have a stable population for over a month and simply should not have been remove the 2 layers à 3000 players each, allow the single layer/realm now have 6000, we're done here treatment that it received.
---
Why were the layers capped at 3000 players when multiple layers were around? I don't know but maybe that was a sane limit of players vs. world size and resource limitations. Why was this just thrown out of the window? They knew it would cause problems that were never present in vanilla, yet went ahead with it.
---
There's one realm to transfer to that we can take. But that realm is already screaming as well. There's no options provided by Blizzard, no communication past the "we're moving BGs ahead in schedule" which may or may not lessen the problem.
---
I really like them to provide (several!) transfers, provide new realms and reduce the realm population cap to sane, more vanilla like numbers. And communicate all that, ahead of time, with clear timelines to give people a chance to seriously plan, discuss with their friends, guilds and socials. But that seems not to be on the table, alas. I see less people daily on my realm and often I don't know if they just stopped playing or transferred away. All I see is problems not being addressed by the only entity that can.
---
Ohhh! So you think he's bullshitting?

&gt; Classic was a cash grab 
---
Classic exists as a sticky product, its meant to be a gateway for Vanilla fans into their new products, or for people who enjoy their other products to get more diversely invested in their suite of offerings.
---
So while I don't think it is a cash grab per say, Blizzard still produced Classic to generate revenue. Its not like it is fan service.
---
this guy lives for quite a bit out there, hes awesome, horde love him
---
&gt;Classic was a cash grab

Ah yes, exactly what I was forgetting... a good wand.

I'm Ally, but this is objectively false.  Horde racials are leaps and bounds above Ally racials in PvP, and totem utility is about on par with Paladin blessings.  As for PvE, Windfury and racials heavily favor Horde once again.
---
Very cool content. I hope for more.
---
seen you a few times, &lt;3
---
I don't have any precise datas but I AOE ginded Murlocs in SoS for a couple levels with my Mage. I dropped 0 golden pearls for the three first levels, and then 4 during 43-44. Had 3 almost back to back in half an hour or so.      
---
I don't know how many clams I dropped but I'm pretty sure it was less than 650.  
---
You're just unlucky.
---
Why do you need to claim I'm *furious*, when I'm just telling someone they're wrong?
---
Are you projecting your own anger, from being told you're wrong?
---
I like how you ignored all my questions though. That usually means you don't have any rational answers, and you've lost the argument.
---
I don't mind that meanings change. I mind that one word has *two separate meanings*. This defeats the purpose of language, *successful communication*. And I don't accept it. 
---
If you ordered two pizzas and someone brought you five instead (and wanted to make you pay for five), you wouldn't just accept that right? It's the same principle. Accuracy matters.

You’re fine, everybody’s used to it.

it's possible to make 500+g an hour multiboxing strat live

Vs undead in a 1v1, try to use the felhunter. 
---
Try to get a curse of tongues off 1st and keep corruption up always. 
---
-dont get locked out of shadow,  try to get them to lock you out of fire.
---
-try to get a fear off early so when wotf is up you can chain fears. 
---
-try to force them to ice block early. 
---
-try to lock them out of frost with the dog
---
-dont worry about dispelling sheeps, the dog has super high resists. 
---
-use dog to eat novas/eat imp cs/dispel offensively 
---
-you want a lot of stam to survive their opening combos. Should be easy after that.
---
-they can dispel curses but it costs a Gcd and as a warlock time is on your side. Keep curse of tongues/shadow up. Agony is not going to tick for much.
---
Mages...
---
There's no such food.  
---
Best cooked food restore 2k mana, nothing close to 4k mages water.

You need to buy either Argent Down mana biscuits or wait for BGs.
---
IKR, these third shift dudes be aggressive!
---
If it works for you, I don't think it's dumb. I personally put all my pet attacks/macros on my mouse though. Wheel up/down for attack/follow, then use my mouse buttons on the side with and without shift modifiers for certain abilities, like VW Sacrifice. Mouse vs keyboard helps me mentally separate my abilities from my pets.
---
I've found LBRS to be much better then BRD after 56

Started a lock earlier today after having a 18 undead warlock and not enjoying it too much, but so far this one seems to be going well. What general tips can you guys offer? I know the whole thing about life tap and never being at full health, but don’t really know the class in general.
---
P.S. I didn’t buy a single Grimoire on my 18 lock because I didn’t know what they were, roast me if you wish
---
:)
---
I would recomend finding AH greens around the 10-12 level range and enchanting those. From my experience the first 10 levels will fly by no matter what and the mobs are designed to be easy. You will want to replace most of your gear immediately anyways because it’s all white / grey until level 10.
---
Firey probably wouldn’t be worth it on a mage. I’m not an enchanter so I don’t know what would be, but a staff is just a stat stuck on mages and doesn’t get used often for combat. Make sure you send yourself every wand you can craft though. They are usually major upgrades when you can equip them.
---
If you are allowing bids, then bid higher or talk to the raid to change the system.  Bidding just allows whoever wants it the most to win it.  And if you want to maximize gear by getting your other BiS and the mageblade, maybe you are the one being greedy.
---
&gt;Sure its bis for pallies but it is a way better upgrade for mages and locks 
---
"Laughs in Staff of Dominance"

That sucks but I never look to join a group till I’m close for fear of being waited on.

Same happened to me on festergut HC where one pally survived and managed to get that last 1%.
---
It really is. And what worse is you got downvoted while buzz killington got upvoted. People are so excited to judge and demean others and play the moral high ground it's sad af.
---
All characters look ugly unless you manage to get a full tier / PVP set. 
---
I'm about that Savory Deviate Delight 24/7.
---
I would say if you can bind pet attack and follow to mouse buttons you should (or at least don’t make it a two button press). You’re going to be using these commands ALOT
---
And of course, they refer to meatbags as 'organics'. Unacceptable.
---
I wasnt offering a solution
---
 I was asking a question.
---
Anyone who plays WoW (or any other video game) for 16-18 hours a day is an addict. Should all alcohol/drug/gambling addicts just be left alone to live their lives? Is it being sanctimonious to tell an addict they have a problem?
---
Yea alchemy has been a great passive money maker. The profit margins aren't huge but you can gain a lot of gold by selling in bulk. I'll usually spend 100g worth of mats and resale them for a 30-40g profit. Especially with TSM, you can buy your mats and craft everything in under 10 min.
---
If you want to go to BRM and there’s a raid group waiting to farm you at the flight point, you’re going to have a bad time. 
---
That’s something that would happen regardless of server population. 
---
Sure, server pop means that this happens in most areas rather than just the big ticket ones. But as if you’re going to look to go to BRM or take the boat to onyxia and get clapped, and then say ‘well I guess I’m going to change my plans and go farm in winterspring.’ 
---
People were happy in phase 1, and phase 2 made many people unhappy. Did phase 2 make the servers big? No. Did phase 2 make factions imbalanced? No. So it isn’t either of those things. It’s the honour system.

Are you thinking of the Shadowweave set? Most pieces are around 38-43 iirc, and all strictly +shadow damage.
---
What’s up on rag he used to do a spell hand of rag now he does lava burst which does the same thing but I think they have different ranges
---
I've found the same thing to be true. I'm on a fairly balanced PVP server and my lvl 36 rogue is doing decent in STV/Arathi. Ganks are common, but not nearly as bad as my main had it/has it now.
---
RPPvP realms have just as much PvP as PvP realms, but with the factions a little more balanced. You will not have a chill and laid back experience. I'd recommend PvE.
---
Believe he's referring to Shadowweave set

If they arent bothering anyone then yes they should be left alone to do what they want. How about you worry about you and let OP worry about OP. And yes it is sanctimonious

Lol that is weird, you are correct. They say you can't get the free upgrade anymore, but yet here they explain how on their own website.  [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/windows-7-to-windows-10-upgrade-manual](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/windows-7-to-windows-10-upgrade-manual) Good to know since i still have my old "dump" pc i use from time to time. Guess its getting a free upgrade next week!

Honestly no idea. We could only see the history of owned items I think, but not the gold history. There was a somewhat complicated system for gold recovery, and only some GMs could do it

Were you trying to imply through the usage of quotation marks that this isn't world pvp?

Nope, left many years ago
---
Was in a small raid doing this and I would sheep/detect and even with seeing the honorless debuff people would kill anyway. I would explain to them how it works, they'd kill anyways. It's amazing what people aren't willing to learn.  Nice post btw.
---
Herbalism is the true money maker here.
---
If potions and flasks are overpriced, people will buy mats and provide a small tip for alchemists. Rarely will you make a respectable profit on alchemy.
---
But go farm the mats for flasks and keep an alt or two full of them for the expected price spike when BWL releases.
---
Mad cause bad? You know its all RNG right?

It doesn’t have to be random to be a GUID, can you wrap your little .NET brain around that?

I aoe grinded for about 2-3 levels at swamp of sorrow murlocs and got 6 pearls. Sold 2 for over 70g each.

Retrowow, instant 60 with BGs, pvp zones and more. Although you still have to grind for good gear, it’s relatively easy to get the blue PvP set
---
I just started an Alliance toon on Grob... was that a bad idea?
---
If ur sundering on 50% of globals ur doing it wrong. Every warrior should sunder first global so u have 5 stacks instantly and once that is the case max threat is revenge/slam/hstrike (assuming deep prot, all of these gen more threat than sunder) long boss kill maybe u sunder 5-10 timez Max If ur super rage-flooded to dump and slam/revenge on cd with hs qued. Otherwise it should be first global sunder, then cast to refresh maybe 2-3 times in a slow kill. hstrike is way better for raids. In aoe mob tanking tab-sundering is decent so u get some benefit there.

First off I gotta say Warlocks are hands down free the most amazing, best, most fun and unique class in all of Classic. I'm so thankful I chose such an amazing class.  
---
I have a question for any raiding warlocks that do well/parse high/actually do high DPS on ony. What is your strat? I've done Ony a few times now as top caster DPS but my strat is semi-scuffed. I'm trying to figure something out with the threat drops. I had the idea of running in for a wing buffet in p3. It is a 50/50 between buffet and her flame breath I think. I got the idea from one of our warriors who does it. I think breath does around 2.2k damage? So very survivable if you get bad luck. Could even use a GFPP if you wanna waste 6g or so lol.   
---
Also, any raiding warlocks that do well/parse high on Domo? it is my only weak fight ( [https://i.imgur.com/299RtYR.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/299RtYR.jpg)  73 lol ) and I just can't seem to get it. I'm SM/Ruin, DoT the non-poly'd mobs after I get curse + corr on the first target, and then single target DPS. Each mob just dies too quick, I can never get more than like 2 shadowbolts in.
---
OK! Your money's at jan/feb! Don't think people complaining will make blizz push it faster? Think Blizz will actually slow down and release april? Toss your chips in!

I think the rampant world pvp deathball griefing is why Blizzard is moving up BGs, and has virtually nothing to due with a streamer saying he was bored.

Sell for 40g ea on my server so people
---
Imagine thinking space jam was shit.
---
Spell batching isn’t an exploit it’s a core feature of the game.  
---
It won’t be “fixed”. It’s a game design choice by the developers
---
the Insane title wasnt added til wrath
---
That would imply the Alliance are players and not resource nodes to farm. Player would imply playing the game. Sitting dead in Morgin's Vigil because you need to turn in a quest for your Onyxia chain is not "playing", it is "waiting".
---
What is going on with Blizzard? Seriously? Why is it that they decide to release classic like this and make basically everything about it worse than just playing on a private server? 
---
Remember back when calling into blizzard or opening a ticket would get you real, thought out responses? Now we get this shit, no responses on all of the issues with the game, a class that is almost entirely bugged out when it comes to pvp and they actively will not support loot issues (which is probably the thing that pisses me off the most)
---
Because its a completely different mechanic.
---
This made Onyxia actual cancer if you were doing less than 40 man raids.
---
That's exactly what I did - then get fiery enchant on Vanq. and Greater Striking on the Phanton for sick glow a e s t h e t i c
---
Yup now i can do this shit with 0 deaths every time. Loving it. Now i just need some dam good RNG lol was there 3 hours yesterday and only 1 crystal
---
Ah ok, my bad. So with 13% quiver, carapace gets down to 2.92, which is less than the 3s if aimed shot.     The rotation is the same imo, it might also help since you might want to wait a bit before aimed shot, which brings you closer to the 10s multishot rotation. It is a bit harder though. 
---
My crossbow is 3.1 now and i use aimed on cd, gonna see if it works with carapace.
---
Have a good weekend.
---
I accidently made a robe of the void on my mage (wanted toake it for a friend but I did not check that it is bop instead of boe) instantly opened a ticket if they could destroy the robe and give me the mats back

I am on my 4th ticket now and I got 3 copy paste answers so far

Last one told me they can't do it because it has been longer than a week
---
Alchemy and herbalism - not a coincidence.
---
I like a macro that whispers your summon target and says in say to click the portal
---
&gt;BRE's proc has a very high proc chance and with 1 stack of the buff it outdamages every other weapon in the game
---
That's just plainly untrue, and fairly easy to disprove as well. Even if you consider a 13% proc chance "really high", it only outdamages Ashkandi with 1 proc against clothies. Warriors going from 4500 armor to 3800 armor don't take that much more damage, given the exponentially diminishing returns on damage mitigation for high amounts of armor. 
---
&gt;You never use HoJ in PvP, it's a PvE item
---
You're endlessly praising a 13% proc chance that offers 10% extra damage to your swing, but consider a 2% proc chance for 100% extra damage and rage "completely useless". Sorry, but you're not even consistent with your own conclusions, so I'm not going to entertain your derisive responses any longer. Hope your baseless theorycrafting works out for you.
---
How would they get dismounted?
---
Intim/Scatter seems nice in solo PvP, but I like Entrapment a bit too much right now, even if I don't know how to use it.
---
If they are still capable of supporting themselves and aren't harming anyone in the process they absolutely should be.
---
Yes, I actually prefer questing over dungeon running
---
...but there is
---
I mean... yeah it's kinda weird but that is indeed the "good manners" option.
---
There's a general sentiment that gear you wear belongs to your class, gold belongs to everyone. Vendor blues are always gold, so should be shared. Items that you can wear, or become items you can wear, could kiiiiiinda be argued that they aren't just gold. That + tank priviledge.
---
The other way of looking at it, if you absorb loot trash no one gets any gold except you. Healers are in a similar spot, they only really make money off dungeon runs. They tend to subsist off vendor scraps. Trading a reliable 3-5g per run for a 1/5 chance of a 30g item probably doesn't appeal to most. Primarily from a jealousy factor.
---
you have two options:  
---
SM/Ruin, the pvp and pve spec are the same (just about, doesn't matter anyway). same as DS/Ruin for PvE, much better in PvP than DS/Ruin. This spec is good, perfectly viable in PvP and what you should be in PvE if you aren't DS(I don't like DS personally). I PvPd a ton as this spec p1 and did just fine. Really well, actually. I spent most of my time farming devilsaur in un'goro and won 2v1s constantly, geared rogues, good mages, etc. Not to toot my own horn but most of these kills that are 10+ were from my SM/Ruin days in un'goro, just to give you an idea that the spec IS good for pvp:  [https://i.imgur.com/8qb9JpS.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/8qb9JpS.jpg) 
---
That said, any serious lock pvper is gonna be either SL/Nightfall (with 5/5 fel conc, 3pc t1 is kinda essential and 5pc t1 just makes it incredibly OP) or SL/Sburn (not as good atm but still great for pvp). Basically you just gotta bite the bullet and take the respect cost every week. Go SM/Ruin for raid and then switch after to SL. My guild has 4 raid teams and we have so many hardcore pvpers/rank pushers that we actually took 2 of our raids and changed their schedule to raid on a Monday night, then the very next night on a Tuesday, so then we don't raid again for like 13 days, saving a ton of gold on respec costs for the pvpers raiding.

Dude... 18 fucking hours a day. It doesn’t take a genius to realize how unhealthy that is.
---
&gt;I want the game to stay broken for my own selfish benefit.
---
At least you admit to it!
---
Dungeons I understand, but it’s just part of the game. If you don’t see the point in raiding to get better gear, then I don’t think this is the game for you
---
There's another spot in western central winterspring with 2 icecap and a silversage right in a nice clump like this
---
Yeah you're better off going to play a solo games with interesting dungeons you clear once and you're done. Maybe try to look into games inspired by D&amp;D since i'd guess you like the wow aesthetics. Try classsic like baldur gates/neverwinter nights or more recent one like Divinity original sin/pillars of eternity.
---
I was wondering whether once BGs are released that wPvP on a RP-PvP server would be more for fun than an honour grind. Would there still be people ganking and camping for no reason?
---
Would an RP or PvE realm be what i'm looking for?
---
But when aren't they?
---
You know blizzard is an American company right?
---
You'll get owned by geared up twinks on lower levels. Gear is one of the most important things in the game and MMOs are built around it.
---
Intellect is a completely useless stat for Warlock which depends on Life Tap and and the sucking pet's mana for sustain. Stam is good but 10 stam is completely negligible when you consider how much more time you will be saving with 21 shadow damage as well as how much more efficient and how much higher your DPS will be. 
---
This is of course assuming you're going for a drain tanking build.
---
Very nice, 56 is the lowest you would attempt this at I suppose? Any ideas for pre 56 but still above ZF solo range?

35g each?! On my server they're going for 3-5 gold each, they're insanely easy to farm since the change to their spawn.

https://i.imgur.com/EMEX1s6.png
---
Which kind? Gameplay or factions? Because factions were pretty even back in the day on the server I played, no one was really concerned with what was the "BiS race" until much later. With the way things are now, of course the hordes (lol) of players rolling Classic toons would continue to play their dominate faction from Retail.
---
I attached pet attack to moving my mouse roller button forward, and pet return to pulling the wheel backwards. Best decision I ever made.
---
This works in retail too but you just sit in SW/ORG and random dungeon queue to 150 or whatever the fucking cap is now
---
BRD can be farmed for xp successfully at 50. The open area by the entrance and the ring are mostly 48s. You can't do all that many bosses at 50, but you can certainly level there.
---
Bananaboi
---
That has nothing to do with what I said.
---
What do you expect a GM to do exactly? He told you there is no way to add kills / honor and that they are investigating the problem?? What more can he do?
---
From what I gathered reading Reddit: consider picking a server that has a similar population to those of vanilla servers.
---
Current high pop servers are... Well... Overcrowded. That's probably the biggest reason players suffer most due to faction imbalance.
---
But world PvP is not pvp
---
So as a Hunter I won Brutality Blade but passed it along to a Warrior. It was a pug, but I'm kind of regretting my decision this morning. It is BiS, but ultimately a stat stick. Am I stupid or no?
---
Except a guildie of mine had the same issue and in his ticket he was told his honor would be fixed to the correct amount
---
hehehe very nice

Exhaustion can be situationally good in BGs though for chasing stragglers in AB or buying some time for your FC in WSG. Overall it’s not a great investment for 4 talent points, but it’s better than the alternatives
---
I'd say you'll be alright 2H tanking up to Sunken Temple. So up to around level 50 or so.
---
But I'd still keep a 1hander and shield on you. You'll need it for bosses and some people just don't accept 2H tanking as a thing. It's usually easier to just switch than argue (at least for me).
---
You can tank all 5man dungeons (and UBRS) in any spec.
---
Nah, it's doable by both factions.
---
In order to get the hat (friendly) and/or the outfit (neutral), you have to kill Booty Bay Bruisers and tank your reputation with the Steamwheedle Cartel. Once you're neutral, you get the outfit. Once you're friendly, you have to kill Baron Revilgaz and Fleet Master Seahorn and then you get the hat.
---
In order to regain your reputation with the Cartel, you have to do some of the following (in order from fastest to slowest) betray the Bloodsails (kill your new friends), kill the opposition (Venture Co / Southsea Freebooters), or do some various quests.
---
I don’t get it, he only has 329 gold.
---
And servers with 4-5x the population.
---
I would say WPvP is more fun on RPPvP realms than anywhere else, because of the sort of inherently RP spirit of a lot of large-scale WPvP like city raids, and because of their moderately better faction balance (which I always thought comes from the RP half attracting more Alliance players, and the PvP half attracting more Horde players). That said, BGs are dramatically more efficient for earning Honor than WPvP, so the two aren't really comparable activities. You can do both, but you'd be doing them for different reasons.
---
People gank and camp for reasons that have nothing to do with Honor. 60's on both sides will camp grey targets which confer no Honor; 5-person groups will camp the same target for the fourth time in a day and get like 2 Honor each for 20 minutes of work. This'll probably diminish once the novelty of Honor dies down and BG's are out, but it'll never go away.
---
Generally, you can expect to lose a large amount of time to corpse running on an RPPvP realm, just the same as any other PvP realm. If your looking for a more casual experience to accommodate limited play time, I would avoid it.
---
#nochanges is just plain stupid, and I think most people realize that. There's a lot of confusion around which changes need to be made, so people generally take a conservative stance, but taking the statement literally is not only dumb but also impossible. 
---
Changes have been made, and will continue to be made. We just need to worry about whether or not they're good for the game.
---
I mean this video is from Classic servers.
---
How does it not work?

No I was simply explaining thats what I did as a warrior. you can still do arena/anger/golem runs as you'll likely want the belt off the ogre and the pants off argelmech.

Why assume that I assumed. You know what they say.
---
Back in the days GM once became visible for me and we talked for God knows how long and he did all his tricks. Your comment popped that memory up for some reason.
---
How common stuff like that was? Hard to imagine there would ever be time for fucking around like that
---
Because the bugs are being investigated. What else do you need to know? It takes time to figure this stuff out, develop a fix, test it, and you don't want to tell people it's ready until you know it's 100% good for production.
---
Add the fact that it's a holiday week and the slower turnaround time makes sense. I swear, it's like nobody on that thread screeching has ever written a line of code in their life. What, do you think Omar and the boys are just whacking off at their desk? 
---
Be patient. I don't understand why people insist on blue posts 0.5 seconds after a bug is found. They're only going to tell you what you already know. If you're anxious, call your mother and have her comfort you, that's not Blizzard's job.
---
The reason for shield is to prevent pushback if I’m getting wailed on. It lets me continue to heal the tank or top them off before I run back. but yes, depend on how much mana I’m going through.
---
NP. I am a fat sweaty pvp nerd/hardcore raider so I like to think I know a bit about stuff like this and I really love helping other warlocks who may not know, because I was that warlock not long ago and someone helped me out a ton. best of luck, any other questions ask away whenever!
---
Depends I guess. You might like modern MMOs better. Old style mmos like wow are giant time sinks that stretch out into the horizon. You decide how far you go, and generally the more dedicated you are the stronger it makes you. Outside pvp (for wow at least) pure patience is the skill that wins this game.
---
Modern MMOs are usually smaller in terms of the grind they will let you do, and their activities are more varied. People like me hate being pigeon holed by games and told what to do, but if that doesn't bother you you'll find the grind much more palatable.  For these MMOs, the number of days you've done your 1-2 hours of dailies is what determines your power level. Also generally speaking their dungeon mechanics are more likely to be mechanical skilled (recognizing queues, timed input checks, understanding class rotation) based from what I hear.
---
Ha, Dreadmist Alliance? #represent
---
This is what I liked about battlegrounds in vanilla. Played shadow priest. Did mostly hang in the back and heal and dot to keep my mana from getting full. If I saw an enemy out of formation I just melted his or her face.
---
Gee, why don't I just give my rogue 200g as well?
---
Fiery weapon is cheaper and not significantly worse than crusader while leveling.
---

Omg I remember those videos. “Did you hear it, listen again! He says ‘I love you Satan, you are my saviour yes you are’” *insert reversed track of non understandable voices*
---
Utterly embarrassing GM response.
---
You did a nice thing. The warrior is going to get much more utility from it than you.
---
It is 'BiS' but some things which are BiS are only very slightly better than alternatives.
---
I don't think you'd be getting much more out of Brutality Blade + another 1hander than you would with a Barbarous Blade from DM:N.
---
Dude, on light bringer I was literally revered when I finally won a game and got my xbow. And the same backdoor shortcut is available that was there on p servers.
---
If anything, alliance will be the ones on here complaining, because horde will win so often that alliance won't even try any more. They will sit around yelling at the 10 people who actually want to pvp.
---
is there? haven't seen one recently

If you have 1-2 guildmates online at 10am, you ARE in a low pop guild. If you don't have a *single* friend online at 10am when you like to play, guess what, you don't have many friends. Fuck off.
---
I basically live inside dungeons because I hate questing, I ain't even mad.
---
Better hurry because in two weeks hunters can easily get an equally good quiver from Alterac Valley.
---
Oh ok, thanks, I'll look into it!
---
It’s a play style thing. I found warlocks fun to play from level 1 on. I absolutely love my lock and despite being an altoholic in vanilla I have no desire to roll any alts at the moment beyond maybe getting a mage to 35 for alchemy to make potions for my lock. 
---
If you’re not liking it, idk why you’re hell bent on making yourself like it. Sounds like you enjoy whatever other class you were playing more
---
"Wow you stupid idiot, you should have read all the forum threads and watched all the YouTube analysis about exactly what was going to happen in phase 2 without any doubt whatsoever so that you would have known to roll Horde and not Alliance so you wouldn't run into these problems. Honestly, it's just on you for not doing your research instead of wanting to have 'fun' or whatever. Fucking casual, l2p."
---
Not every server was even
---
This doesn't explain the mid-week kills in this time frame not being calculated in your total honor points for standing.  It is absolutely a bug, it is impacting people's total honor, and it is not just a visual error.
---
i wonder if his raid gear disappeared if he’d make that comment
---
Only one I really know of is sagefish delight which restores both hp and Mana, but it doesn't restore all that much.
---
my guild got our second eye in three weeks last night. The reason it's rare is because very few actually want to gather the mats for crafting it
---
You're a good guy and won't miss out on too much, meanwhile the warrior will get a large boost from a raid level weapon.
---
Still bad
---
So you ignored any context from the video and commented anyway? Nice one.
---
even though this post is a joke you can get any class to 60 in &lt;3 days playtime using a mage to carry alts in these exact dungeons
---
He farmed enough gold to buy the Runecloth to get exalted with the other 3 factions and bought epic mounts from each. Thousands and thousands of gold.
---
No, I believe that, the millenials grew up with video game RPG's (focused on stats, numbers, XP, etc etc) whereas GenX geeks grew up with pen and paper roleplaying.
---
Uhhh, most interns are not paid. If they are it's not much.
---
Pop it , hot, shift, profit.
---
 Not complicated
---
I get what you're saying, but I think you fail to realize that RAG was not bugged like this in vanilla.. so it is a #change.
---
Should I switch to prot you think around 51? Or just stick it out arms till 60
---
No it means people you play with mostly have jobs. Congratulations on failing to think again.
---
Bubblebear since you have that theme going in your other two names.
---
Bearadin might be a stretch.
---
perfect.

[21-8-22](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/325020125001-3203-45020303030011) - can go imp poisons over remorseless and imp exp armor but i like those more both for 1v1 vs priests and shield warriors/feral druid in bear etc and remorseless is super good in BGs which are dropping december 10.
---
[16-8-27](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/305020105-3203-55005303030012) - spec i m playing rn when not raiding. its probably the best one if you know the class well and are well geared (MC daggers, 25+% crit, hit capped etc, 4+k HP, imho ofc).
---
No Ulda?!?!
---
16-18 hours a day is definitely addicted, I was very addicted before I reached 60 and got most of my BIS gear and will probably will be again with BGs but if someone watches films or TV shows for the same time per day nobody says anything. There is huge double standards out there and gamers get the most shit for doing what is essentially a hobbie. I'd definitely rather work hard for 8 months then have 4 solid months off, gives you the options to do a lot of stuff.
---
Yea I forgot having to farm something makes it not better.... And you can link something where someone says x is better but the math is clear counter weight maul is better then warden staff with no enchant.  The math has been done. Mcp is also 100% necessary if your in even a remotely good guild.
---
At this point I'm not sure they can do much. As usual, the morons at blizzard took too long. We'd be better off with them resetting all of classic and setting a limit on what kind of difference there can be (aka, stop letting horde characters be created on realms when the difference gets beyond 60/40)
---
i always try to get on live chat to avoid these shitty responses
---
He started a fight to draw out the Horde raid group and prove a point. If you don't think 40v1 is silly as fuck I don't know what to tell you.
---
Yes, very viable.
---
The DPS was probably just new to the game
---
I'm tempted. How's the situation for new players there
---
This argument holds no water.  Shorter boss fights mean less healing and skipped mechanics.  Higher skill means less healing because less derps are standing in fire and cleaves and buttpulling extra packs.  There is less to heal in a skilled run vs a pug.  I guess my ultimate point is you can do it with less but its just worse and slower and suboptimal.  Kind of like you can 10 man MC in naxx gear or kill ony with all druids but its going to take longer.
---
Can you do BRD at levl 50... ?
---
how hard is it to look at the prices on other popular servers? may want to wait until BG's come out btw
---
&gt;25% AP boost 
---
Is there a way to raise all the steamweadle rep without tanking  bloodsail? I was told the pirates at lost rigger cove
---
Was looking for this comment and I agree. Deleted data is deleted. They aren’t going to go through and manually update everyone’s accounts. It sucks but support is support and they are told what they can and can’t do with regards to people’s accounts. The copy and pasted template should show how many people are reporting issues. Of course they aren’t going to manually type out a personal message to everyone. The bug reports in game would get routed to the correct technical support team rather than just T1 customer support. People lost honor and that’s what they’re rightfully pissed about. Stop hassling customer support I doubt there’s anything they’re really allowed to do to replace your honor.
---
So you really think +3.5 damage per tick of corruption &gt; 100 hp and 255 mana on a PvP server?
---

DME jump farm can net you around 30-40gph if you have a herbalist and a miner, but it's more of a 3-man/2-man sort of group content. Comes with a shot at the 750g Foror's book, and the lashers that drop additional herbs/essences/possible epics.
---
For a full five-man though, I almost want to suggest either Tyr's hand in EPL, or seeing if people will pay for jed/rend runs where they're guaranteed the drop they want?
---
You do realize you can say it both ways
---
51 is good. I never tanked in Vanilla so it was good to get comfortable with Prot at that point. Just make sure you have your tactical mastery and get comfortable stance dancing around 25 rage. It becomes less necessary as you progress but it’s always good to have it available.
---
I’m still new to warlock myself, but with a little practice you can juggle 2-4 mobs at once. Dot one up, put the voidwalker on it, dot another and fear it. Between your pet and fears, you can tackle anything including elites. Also, something something something, grimoire. =)
---
Apples to oranges but okay
---
Because you haven't been hacked it means they cant have a problem and the problem couldn't possibly affect new accounts differently than your 15 year old account (they've probably never migrated accounts through their 10 different iterations of the game or the bringing back of osrs), Hmm... If people with that type of thinking have any say in IT security, no wonder shit like this is so common
---
This joke turned shit, gz
---
So are you doing it on purpose or is it out of your control - I don't get it honestly, sorry.
---
Couldn't tell you mate - all I know is both wowhead and atlasloot have it listed as a p5 addition: https://classic.wowhead.com/item=21563/don-rodrigos-band#comments
---
Maybe it's due to the fact that it wasn't in the original AV loot table (first added in 1.9) and Blizz felt spell pen was too powerful for the earlier content patches? Just my guess.
---
It is indeed weird that the poster above you chose such a word for this serious topic. I would also want to hear an answer to the question you posed.
---
If you're mainly tanking I'd say stick in Arms still.
---
Charge -&gt; Bloodrage -&gt; Sweeping Strikes -&gt; Berzerker Stance -&gt; Whirlwind -&gt; Defensive Stance -&gt; Demo Shout
---
That's the best tanking opener Warriors have IMO and requires Arms spec.
---
So i got this drop for myself too, and i was thinking of selling it, what price should i set ? any ideas ?
---
I just played back through BGII. That game is just amazing
---
As a healer you’re fine for a long time. I’d echo the other poster in that once you get to around ST, you don’t have to switch Prot but I’d definitely atleast have a shield on you so that if your healer is struggling to keep you up you can switch mid-run. At the level of Gnomer though you’re completely fine (that instance is a nightmare for other reasons). Not sure why your DPS party member was invested in that question though.
---
This is where the MMO part comes in. If you’re playing a MMO as a single player game, then you’re doing it wrong. The best part about Classic/TBC was the community. You only interact with the people on your server, so after a while people start recognizing each other and reputations get built.
---
Part of that MMO thing is also helping out other players, and building up the social aspect of your game. That’s the part that truly makes MMOs fun.
---
This thread is best enjoyed while sorting by controversial
---
Whatever works for you is what works, but I recommend shift+scroll as attack and follow
---
It occurs with all "next cast spell" abilities.  Priest's inner focus does this as well, chaining a heal plus an instant right as the heal goes off for two free spells.  You really don't want this fixed as it has a lot of benefits for PvE.
---
I'm the opposite.  I basically have 1 option for each setting that i almost always use because it's just the best one.  Main thing that varies is hair color.
---
Yeah, but they dont wait. In a normal run you wait for your healers to drink regen mana a bit. In a speed run the dps just gogo and healers are under more strani because they cant all drink.
---
This community is 90% whine posts and its fact, just look at the front page, now you go read those definitions since you clesrly dont comprehend them
---
Server size, sure I can see that being blizzards fault. But we all knew how the honor system worked. This is not new. I was ganked continuously in 2005. Which is why I play on PVE.
---
theres a powershift macro where u can use consumables and pop back into bear in like 0.01 seconds
---
Thanks for the input!
---
100-200g, although I’m not sure if anyone is actually buying them for that price.
---
My Alliance guild with over 100 active members is transferring to Earthfury this weekend.
---
Thanks for thorough reply. 
---
It's sure a tough decision!
---
I think I'm learning PvE, but then again I don't want to miss out. Maybe I will roll rogue on RP PvP so so I'm able to play around unwanted PvP on my terms.
---
It also depends on what PvP is like after Bags are released.
---
Nice counter argument, in hillarious english too
---
The mind literally implodes at the thought.
---
I bought a laptop with a ryzen 5 3500U/vega 8 graphics. It was less than 500 CAD and runs classic with no issues.
---
You may be able to go cheaper but likely are looking at second hand or slightly aged equipment.
---
No problem! Good luck! Tanking is a thankless task but you’ll be a better player for it.
---
Ahh yes, as we all know, jobs must always be done at 10am. No way OP could have a job where that isn't the case, no sir. You're retarded.
---
Melee is standing to close to boss. Get them to stand half way out/in and tanks as close as possible
---
It also always happens when I haven't played for a few months and try to log back into an account... Wouldn't be surprised if an internal employee was involved
---
I grinded nagas from lvl 43-49 on my druid, and 44-46 on my priest and have gotten 1 golden pearl. My friend grinded 44-50 and got zero. The drop rate is abysmal...
---
I haven’t been using whirlwind so this will help out for sure
---
&gt;alcor's sunrazor
---
well it dropped for me today, i was thinking of selling it, and TSM shows some price around 700-800g, what price should i set for it ?
---
Nah this is defeatist and dumb. Too many people taking comfort in reddit. They lose ingame and go here to feel vindicated for not adapting because they want to compare their server experience to someone on faerilina who probably cant play the game, because its so bad on that server itself. My server was very balanced and populated but not crazy overpopulated and this is what happened. Now the alliance rankers who actually play the game have had to leave the open world to defend IF because ally won't leave a fuckin town.
---
Both servers are play on have queues, nice try. You guys are the vocal minority, get that.
---
Maybe classic is too classic for you my friend :) 
---
I would recommend trying out other expansions on private servers. 
---
I think the lack of much content in endgame is the main reason I only raid-log since I reached 60 with 2 of my characters and in the meantime I play on a wrath of the lich king server.

---
One thing I missed which is worth mentioning, try to avoid healing yourself until the tank regains aggro (even a renew).
---
You need to get to 110% of whoever has top threat to steal aggro. So every point of threat counts if the tank doesn't have taunt available to take aggro back instantly.
---
Of course if you're going to die do whatever you can to not die. Groups wipe when healers die, everyone else is expendable.  
---
But if you can wait, it's great to wait till the tank has aggro back before you patch yourself up.
---
Cool go yell that at the devs in 2004. Or play retail. Classic's design is 15 years old and you chose to play it.
---
Check wowhead

Rogue warrior priest and 2 mages and or holy pally. Rogue warrior mage is insane dps add in a holy pally + priest it is unstoppable.
---
Thats how support is. We can literally do basically anything with your account (generally speaking) but we arent allowed to.
---
If you keep spamming, you will eventually find someone who is not following protocol, either cause they are feeling nice, or because they are new. 
---
Stop hating on the ones who actually does what they are ordered, for example this poor service rep.
---
Insane that people actually down vote this, we will see in a year I guess. But people do quit games after the hype is over. And so will people playing classic as well do. Leading to more people swapping to high pop servers and some will die out slowly. If not a year let's say 4 years, and I want my character to the long lasting servers
---
It is drain damage, not damage and healing. You heal the damage you do.
---
Like how Life Tap is not damage, it is conversion.
---
Hahahah i love when i see this mentally challenged response.   
---
So i can gather up 10 my friends and come complain behind your door loudly 24/7 and then when you complain about us we like "LOOOL LMAO HE IS COMPLAINING"   
---
Does this argument hold water in your mind? Because big yikes if it does.
---
FIX: You can stop the hearth by inviting someone to a group even if they cancel the invite you shouldn't get hearthed.
---
Blizzard broke their game. Batching is a design choice but this is an unintended consequence
---
You're locked to that raid, you can't go do it now until reset.
---
Rank 3, 4,and max rank Healing touch. Rank 3 to not get healing sniped, rank 4 is the normal spam, max rank with Swift mend.
---
I only used max revuj on tanks at the start of the fight.
---
Max rank regrowth on tanks and DPS if taking consistent damage.
---
Pretty much spam healing touch r 3+4 and have hots on tanks.
---
It's because the tank is getting out of melee range of Rag.
---
Rag will hit the highest threat target within Melee range, so it doesn't matter how much threat the tank has if they aren't in melee range of the boss.
---
This is why groups generally have the melee go out for a moment when the tank gets knocked back, so they're not getting slapped around.
---
You’re locked to that ID, which means you only can raid with someone who hasnt done mc this weak,or the ones you’re locked with
---
Fantastic.  Cheers
---
If you want to test everything yourself you need to set up your own server.
---
They’ve gone from making the best game possible, to making the most profit possible, as many successful
---
Gaming companies I’m sure eventually do.
---
I mean.. depends on the area. CS interns are definitely paid a lot (although not as much in game Dev cause they can). But not American, but think it's illegal to have an unpaid internship if the company benefits from it, although it might depend on the state.
---
The complaints will shift to "remove the backdoor horde can use to avoid the bridge" as soon as AV is out
---
You are not allowed to do it. Different story. If you keep whining you'll eventually find a new/bad/kind rep who will break protocol for you. Does not make it right.
---
Blood Fury: Increases attack power by 25% for 15 sec

I high mate?
---
Alright so the most telling thing about this picture is his health and mana. I’m making a mage to literally get this type of play money eventually. I assume he did the ZF thing but I thought you needed more mana and health for the pulls. And anyone shed light on this for me please? Maybe has a different set in the bank? Maybe it wasn’t ZF at all? I mean I see he doesn’t have AI on but still
---
Why did you even say this? Worthless ass comments
---
So this is what the horde who aren't corpse camping are doing.
---
You're night elf looks similar to mine lol
---
So if a new group makes a Mc raid who hasn’t done it, I can go with them?
---
Somehow when I log into my account on battlenet it says I'm bouncybear. I have never chosen this name but it's been given to me.
---
Yea but someones already done the job so why bother haha
---
Any chance you could link your preferred sm/ruin build?
---
Also for pvp do you only use your voidwalker when running this spec?
---
I know if this macro, I want to use it. I have never seen confirmation that this isn't against blizzard rules.
---
He can still clear the bosses he hasn't killed, he just needs to be the leader and let anyone know who is joining that the first 3 bosses are down.  
---
He also needs to do this before anyone else in the raid clears it.    
---
But you can still clear the rest of the raid, though most people won't join an already started MC run.
---
Go to duskwood baby, good zone until 30
---
You’re saved until next week. Your only option is keep going on your current raid ID, so you could grab as many ppl that were in your group yesterday and pug the rest if you can find enough people who don’t mind skipping 3 bosses.
---
This!
---
Requires level 35 so you can use it in sm but not 20 lol
---
When she was bugged the fireball threat mechanic was based off of guid as well.
---
This is super anecdotal. Last week there was ally camping both all of BRM starting with a raid waiting just off the sides behind the gate when coming from SG. Another set of 5 rogues in SG outside of the pass to kargath. More groups in BS just off the flightpath and the whole way toward BRM.
---
It's a tossup, I don't think I've made it into BRD once without dying to a camp along the way as Horde. Though both sides tend to camp different parts of the mountain simultaneously, so I guess that's fine.
---
I was expecting a metal statue not some rubberised shite. I'm selling mine.
---
Over 10 years ago. Boycotting them for exactly this reason.
---
They are a shit company. Expect nothing or set yourself up for disappointment.
---
Pve servers
---
germany too
---
I had two of em drop in back-to-back runs, I was dumbstruck lmao
---
you're pretty boned. Technically you can put together your own pug/group and go in and finish it, but anybody else in that pug can do the same thing.
---
I’m noob
---
Noone gets to play between 12 midnight and 5pm. Sounds perfect to me!
---
Go do your gathering professions and chill out till bgs come unless your honor farming.
---
For the laughs lol
---
I tried but they make you get a subscription
---
I don't get it, will you or will you not have all the pre-BIS gear from BRD?
---
Orc casting animations exist for only shamans and warlocks. Orc females are just. so. darn. good!
---
Honestly you sound exactly like the type of person Guild Wars 2 was built for. It has horizontal profession meaning it’s not about grinding gear but about experiencing all the different content out there. Really great game and it has no subscription fee. Seriously I would try it if I were you it’s really easy to get into and really fun.
---
Yes of course having to farm Gnomer makes it not better.  You need to have multiple MCP per run.  Who's trying to run gnomer over and over and over and over and over? You can make 400g for Warden staff in a few days.  But you'd rather constantly run gnomer. lol
---
Yes the math has been done, which is why every single website calls Warden staff BIS.  I don't even know how you think this is debatable lol

Having unlimited work/overtime at $35+/hr is a dream almost every grown man with a family I’ve met would be happy to have.
---
I'm not usually one for this, but...
---
The entitlement OP displays both in this post and his response to the ticket is astounding. The GM clearly stated it's something that has been reported and they're aware of the issue, even if it is a copied response (news flash: most GM responses are copy-paste). (S)He also said they have no way to verify the amount of missing kills you report or the honor lost as a result. This is entirely understandable and you should have a little patience and understanding instead of getting "disgruntled". This post and your comments in the ticket look like nothing more than Blizzard Hate bandwagoning to get yourself some Karma. I'd almost consider it brigading, but that's up to the mods on this sub.
---
Your mood is your decision. Choose to be positive about it. It sucks you lost some honor, but stop being such a Karen and fucking get over it.
---
Sounds about right, especially for us MDPS trying to get HoJ. Luckily, rogues can solo angerforge jumping up and down a ledge (YouTube angerforge solo runs if you haven't been enlightened), but it still took about 2 weeks straight to see it drop. I have vowed never to step foot into BRD again on my main.
---
Probably a warrior as well..
---
You don't need the imps. Find a seed from the pods to spawn a Thornling to aoe the imps at the end of the encounter. Give it a single pws and it will live.
---
Maybe just smash 5 man dungeons? I recall doing this in vanilla when my friends and I had blues / tier 1 level gear and the runs were very fast due to the coordination of the team. At the very least it yields a lot of vendor trash, cloth, etc with minimal repair costs expected.
---
Think....jfc lol
---
The chat is shit....so the game is turning to shit... so did china buy out blizzard and start fucking up the game....
---
I'm pretty sure that's not correct.
---
Being able to do enough to not do when I want to is the whole point of capitalism.  You work as much as you need to or want to and you’re rewarded as such.
---
There is any way to know if ppl on your PUG have an ID of  a MC unfinished?
---
Well, if you have limited time to play, you also won’t be able to keep up your skills enough in an esport style game to be high MMR.
---
Wouldnt base it on those items. Did u check thorium brotherhood rep-rewards?
---
Honestly, I'd say something or charge them. I bring bandages and roasted quail with me wherever I go. If we wipe I bandage myself up. Saves us time and water for the healers. Everyone should do what they can to spread the load.
---
The threat reset always happens to everyone yes. The ideal strategy to save your melee is to taunt immediately after wrath goes out followed by dumping a Shield Slam+Heroic and Revenge+Heroic into him.
---
During execute phase you're best off just taunt cycling. Taunt, Mocking Blow, Taunt, AoE taunt, Taunt. That gives your warriors 21 seconds to kill him.
---
Also, could you send me a link to where you pulled this info? That would be amazing, cheers mate.
---
LMAO, its nowhere near this bad, nor is the list any good.
---
Are Elemental shaman going to be good in the later phases of the game?
---
Ok! So.. No fixes EVER or very delayed fixes? Like 2-3 months?
---
&gt; Can you do this with a preist/war?
---
Yep; in fact it's the standard pairing. 2-man is much harder than 3 though - you'll both want to have pretty decent gear, and you'll want the tank to hold both satyr bosses on the corner of pillars so the priest can heal while still being out of LoS. Optimally, 2-man DME uses a fury tank with most any priest; shadow *might* be able to heal and DPS enough to down bosses faster, but I've only done it as disc.
---
There's a bunch of videos on the subject though, I recommend giving them a look to get a good idea of the strats.
---
Totally agree with you, I’m disappointed BGs are due out in just over a week. I’d hoped to get a few alts to 60 before then.
---
This is not a bug. It's a feature to allow alliance players to play the game in full color mode once per day.
---
I have noticed this as well. MT gets punted, OT goes in and gets hit, then I go back in and have aggro once I'm in range. It's almost like the ability doesn't wipe aggro from the dps who don't get hit. Or maybe that's how it was intended to be. I played a hunter in vanilla, so I never had to deal with this.
---
Also, can Rag actually be taunted? I suggested the OT taunt, but they said he was immune to taunt.
---
Yes some fire damage
---
Long queues? Alright.. I'm game. Not gonna call BS.
---
What about the "AV Version"? Think there wont be the Shortcut for horde?
---
Looking to do a meme fire lock build. Not looking to raid with it much, but want to make use of the AoE stun talents in group content. Anyone have a good item list to shoot for? Despite plenty of ret pal or moonkin bis lists, there doesnt seem to be one for fire lock.
---
Only played allied back in the day.
---
What is this backdoor? Isn’t there base kinda on a hill?
---
Pretty hard achievement to get, not gonna lie
---
What his azz taste like
---
Well populated, yes. Balanced, hell no. It’s easily 60% horde most likely 70%.
---
You're fine with sword + dagger until you spec into swords which I didn't do until after 60. If you have the extra gold, fiery is only going to help.
---
Outside of hair style and hair color I honestly don’t really care what my character looks like on character creation. We’re playing classic. Everyone looks like garbage tbh.
---
Your top Sm/ruin should use corruption for nightfall proc, agony is trash.  Amplified agony for Ony P2 is good but that's it.
---
There is not a single plate piece out of any dungeon for dps warriors that compared with mail and leather pieces.
---
Low pop just means more gold making opportunities.
---
Prolly because you cant comprehend that tanks will **NEVER** have trouble finding a group. Even if they charge. 
---
So you got to do some mental gymnastics to keep believing your right :)
---
Rp pve has a great attitude among players, way less tryhard than what u read here about pvp players atleast! Ofcourse there are still ppl getting horny over raidlogs, but the majority is very chill
---
Better to use sword if you have the sword talent, otherwise i dont think it matters.
---
Cadaverous and SGC are much rarer and more contested as well. Most warriors probably start out with either this or the slightly inferior Deathdealer Breastplate.
---
Maybe I've exaggerated my thoughts, you're right that there is probably no massive overarching security problem but there is something weird going on I've been able to bypass some of their security features and have seen some fishy things on their account administration side when I was trying to recover the accounts to even realize they were banned, but I have not had any other accounts compromised, I used a unique password that I had no reason to type in anywhere else and I only ever accessed the account through jagexs mobile app and web portal link from the mobile app... I have a decent understanding of web security as I work with it everyday and if really like to know what is going on but jagex support refuses to even reply if you enquire into anything on a banned account
---
I think what he means is that the contraction would've is a combination of the words "would" and "have" - not "would" and "of." Should've, could've, would've are all contractions of the root word and "have". "Would of" doesn't really mean anything, logically.
---
asking the real questions
---
Warden staff only becomes better when you can enchant it none of those sites are correct.  And no farming is again necessary if you are in a good guild you know I'm sure your right I don't have sub 40 min nd clear and day 10 rag kill .....
---
Shield goes a lot further than prot spec in dungeons.
---
Some pulls can be rough as 2w/2h in brd+ if your healer is the same lvl or undergeared.  I can heal my friend fury prot 2w but I have some decent gear.
---
I prefer the journey of WOW more than the end content, grinding and farming are so boring for me. At the launch I was leveling alone but one IRL friend join and i create an alt to play with him, later my brother join too and i made another alt. My first toon is 60 and the others are still in race, for a personal view its more awesome to play with them at leveling now.
---
Spoiler alert: it's not a serious guide.
---
Okay, I know about the risks of incrementing values but I don't think that it applies to character GUIDs in this case. If you know what you are doing incremental IDs are not really a problem. Thanks for the clarification though.
---
The latter, but with delays getting worse as time goes on. I suspect they've kept their resources focused on retail rather than supporting a game that doesn't require actual updates, but I would say all bets are off if blizzard starts talking about "BC Classic" or any other form of post-vanilla content.

Lol epic profits

I wake up happy to work every day during work season.  I’m just sad the grass stops growing and it gets cold or I would work year round. 
---
Waking up when the sun comes up, start working all day outside, finish as the sun goes down and go ride my motorcycle with my club.  I’d love to do that year round but unfortunately winter is an occurrence rather regularly.
---
Its 3$ and its worth it.

Mama biscuits

Its either the tank is getting knocked back or the melee are pulling aggro. Besides that just run out during fire
---
People are gonna get mad about WSG being only cordinated premades instead of classic pvp fun
---
People are gonna get mad AV is just a honorfarm by running to the enemy boss instead of actual fights are the capture points.
---
Tldr; battlegrounds less fun with BiS-mentality players
---

---
Can you get the scepter solo or do you need a group?
---
Bring a group and kill them? Why is pvping on a pvp server such a strange idea to you?
---
It also reduces healing you receive by 50% for 30 seconds. 
---
Orcs don’t pop blood fury when sitting in melee range during BGs please
---
You would still setup as a multiboxer, just don't bind the same keys to the same things.  For example you could make 1-5 your attacks on your main, and then 6-0 would be heals on your priest.
---
It would be more convenient than alt tabbing to swap inputs all the time.
---
What WOTLK server do you play on?
---
this was hilarious, happened to me while levelling an alt too :P
---
"they're just following orders, bro"
---
Shoulda rolled an obviously better server, anyone who stuck to one of the Zerg servers is a damn fool
---
Lmao Jesus Christ I've now provided you 3 sources telling you Warden is BiS.  How arrogant can you get?
---
Do you get any cool dialogue with the ship captains and whatnot?
---
No no no, that's crazy talk. What's actually happening is Blizzard is bitter Classic is successful, so they're intentionally fucking it up to stick it to the players. /S if  it wasn't obvious. Some of the takes in this thread are absurd.
---
Moving slow, but I finally dinged 40 on my Paladin. 
---
As I climb tho and as AoE is becoming more important, is it super vital to respec and pick up consecrate for when I dps in dungeons? 
---
I've received no complaints so far tbh most people don't seem to mind that my damage done lags behind in return for having my utility, and generally not doing too much dumb shit during a run lol 
---
I just enjoy where my toon is at right now for soloing, but would like to be able to contribute more in dungeons - or can it wait until 50?
---
Yeah this pvp is a pretty trash experience

That info is a pinned message in the Tank Chat channel.
---
Yes it matters a lot to me. I go to great lengths to make my characters as ugly as humanly possible. Current main is a male dwarf with a massive horn of a nose, grey, receding hair and a shabby grey beard.
---
I'm just leveling toons to 20 and rerolling so I don't have to be in a contested zone
---
This is a standard issue. There’s a bug. Blizzard has acknowledged the bug and they’re working on a fix. 
---
Even if they had millions of GMs, the best thing to do is to have a canned response that acknowledges the bug, informs the player that they’re working on a fix, and apologizes. 
---
If they write custom replies to the issues, then you will get different messages coming out from different GMs and players become very, very unhappy.
---
As a priest I wondered this when I got to 60 but it had cost so much to get tailoring to max that I stuck with it and Truefaith came along a lot faster than I expected, because you get gold so much faster in the last few levels, assuming you started making a couple of mooncloth before you get 60. I think I had just two or so by 60. I lived in BRD until I had all the BIS pieces I wanted from it and with that gold from vendoring soulbound blues and cloth that I would turn into bolts and sell on the AH (or just raw cloth stacks, whatever sells better on your server), I was able to save up a pretty penny. Once I was done with that I moved to the plaguelands and and did the low-hanging fruit easy solo quests, ran Strat Live a bunch and also did the In Dreams quest-line as well as the quests in Strat itself. I know that seems like a lot but if you’re aiming to PVE endgame stuff there’s a good chance you’re doing a lot of that anyway. Quests at this point will probably give 4-5 gold per quest. While doing all that you’ll probably be able to craft a couple more mooncloth yourself, and the Strat Live runs will get you the Righteous Orbs, you’ll probably get 1 every 2 runs on average. And by the time you’ve done 8 runs there’s even a small chance the pattern itself drops from the final
---
Boss (although for me it did not).
---
By that point you’ve probably saved up good money, have half the mooncloth, and all the righteous orbs. So you can buy the golden pearls (25ish gold on my server, each) and the last of the Mooncloth, plus the pattern if you didn’t have it drop. 
---
My main piece of advice if you that route though is not to buy things as you go along, you’ll be tempted to to feel like you’re making progress. I used to accumulate the gold and check the AH each time I log in then only buy if I saw something drop to a deal. A righteous orb for 35, a pearl for 20, or the pattern in the low 100s (considered a deal by my server prices). You don’t want to be caught in that situation with no cash on hand because you’ve been buying one piece at a time.
---
But to answer your question it wouldn’t be foolish to skip all that, for me it just felt like a lot of stuff I was doing anyway. But no you’re right, Robes of the Exalted is absolutely a great alternative, I just think the MP5 from TV is a lot more useful in long raid fights, although I’m no raid expert by any means. And bear in mind that Strat UD is a bit harder than Live, and Robes of the Exalted doesn’t exactly drop every other run either.
---
Yes it is.
---
This perspective gets downvoted to hell all of the time, but nobody ever does a good job of explaining why. 
---
The reason warriors end up wearing lots of leather and mail is two things: a majority of warriors will end up dpsing as fury in raids as opposed to tanking, and there is no bonus in classic wow for wearing all of the same or the highest armor that you can.
---
In raids, you should almost never take any damage from attacks from enemies, so armor is a near worthless stat. More armor is the only advantage that plate armor has over leather and mail, so all dps warriors just go with whatever armor they can find that gives as much hit, crit, agility, and strength as they can find. Most of this happens to be mail and leather, so a properly geared raiding DPS warrior usually ends up roughly equal parts mail, leather, and plate.
---
This is one CSR in one interaction.

Nope AB is scheduled to be P4 along with ZG :)

Thanks heaps for the info man. You're a legend.

What else is new
---
RP PVP is a good option, if you want a chill place not so crowed but with people to hit dungeons and raids Deviate Deligth is a good option.
---
Grobbulus. Healthy population (but 10 minutes queues max at absolute prime time), great faction balance, great server community. I would never consider another server.
---
Why do you stack btw? Does it spread the damage more?
---
No its literally alliance favored. Youre a fool to think otherwise.
---
It's funny, I was getting the Thorium Point FP, running through as a level 46 I believe. Didn't get attacked once. Came back 2 levels higher though, oh man
---
The servers crashed Wednesday night. This caused the world boss timers to reset, and also causes honor to begin resetting around 5 PM server. This also affects the 3-8am honor bug where you didn't gain honor during that time frame... the honor bug now functions during the day time instead and results in most people losing their entire honor gains for the day.
---
So I have the same issue. But i actually think my “this week” tab is correct. The today and yesterday are bugging out but the net total for “this week” seems to be correct
---
It embarrasses me to see this because I have said so much in defense of Blizz and the WoW sub fee. In Vanilla/BC I needed issues resolved a couple of times and recall it being so painless and the service was excellent. I tell people, THAT is what you are paying a sub for, it's the Blizzard quality service. Now it just feels sarcastic to say that.
---
People aren’t, and never were, using literally wrong if they are intentionally and clearly using it in a hyperbolic  over the top way....that’s a normal part of language. If they overuse it you may find it naturally annoying, like overusing sarcasm; but it doesn’t fall under “so many folks used it incorrectly that the incorrect use is now correct.” 
---
I never understood this hang up reddit/people has with literally. Would I ever use literally like that in a college essay? No, but it’s not and never has been wrong to use as it’s opposite literal( dictionary meaning.
---
I found out at level 1 that if you do this as a troll you look like you’re floating in a T-pose hahah

Keep running your mouth.  You’re probably fat irl.
---
Not very, iirc the rule was that you could only do it in cases where you had to restore the items to someone, so you would teleport the player to somewhere empty, do the thing,say your lines and leave, but ho early we loved that too. Also sometimes you forgot to turn on the invisibility and they saw you...
---
Scratchnsniff
---
The community just isn't the same anymore unfortunately. I'm not having too great of a time like back then, maybe it's just me.
---
I did the same, then just unsubbed. My raiding guild went from 60+ online at any time to like 4.
---
I'm specifically responding to the comment "horde is for noobs".
---
You'll on average get way more accurate and researched info from discords than Reddit unfortunately.
---
A lot of people on Reddit will give their opinion even if they aren't the ones actively engaging with the mechanic. (Classic case of "I'm a healer, but my tank does X")
---
I still typically have a melee or two die on Rag, but that's loads better than a month ago when literally 100% of melee would be dead on the ground by the time Rag was dead.

If companies started refunded shit due to user retardation pretty much all companies would be bankrupt by now.

---
OP didn't get exactly what he wanted so Blizzard must be shit.
---
More people are concerned with playing what theyre familiar with than racials.
---
Mine is 100% wrong, it's missing the honor and HK's in "this week" as well. Everyone in the top bracket on my server is saying the same thing, it's a widespread issue.
---
Saving for later
---
Last MC run, my miss % on Shaz, Sulf, and Gole was 24, 29, and 34%.  I have Ban’thok and Star of Mystaria on along with most BIS gear (Im at 394 SP unbuffed with Star on).  
---
The following night we cleared Domo and Rag and I parsed 2nd highest in the raid group and my miss % was down to 13% in both those fights.
---
Is it pretty much RNG on missing or not?  I’m wondering, will it make a difference one or another if I remove Star and replace with Anastari for the spell dmg?  I usually stack shadow power and greater arcane pots during MC anyway.  Should I keep the Star on even though I missed a crazy amount on the last 3 bosses?
---
How many can you do bud ?  I bet 0.
---
With rested exp, I got my hunter from 58 to 60 in a couple hours in Stratholme.
---
True, if you decide to give the game another run maybe try tanking at least during early dungeons youd be able to find groups
---
Let’s have a challenge.  Who can do more ??
---
Hang on, that's exactly what most players would do. If BRM was inaccessible because a raid is locking it down you just go elsewhere or try and gather enough players to fight it. Why would that be an unusual reaction? Are you defending the monstrous server pop caps here? Seems to me there's nothing redeeming about them at all, simply too many people for a pretty small world
---
&gt; If you know what you are doing incremental IDs are not really a problem.
---
Precisely; I should have tried to emphasize that in my original post, I think.
---
Pretty sure I have this exact laptop that I’m currently running classic on.  I believe I bought it around 8 years ago.  It’s an Acer
---
Yeah honestly, 57% horde for a pvp server is actually pretty good.
---
I get ganked plenty but there’s also a ton of roaming alliance just out in the world.
---
TLDR?
---
Solo ally in desolace...
---
Level 60 warlock here in pretty much pre-paid bis.
---
Quite a few bits of "of shadow wrath" gear so lacking in stats but high in damage  
---
Anyone else in a similar position having issues some farming DM east? Seen loads of videos online of warlock soloing DM east with ease but I always feel I'm walking a fine line. One small screw up and I'm boned usually resulting in death.
---
These warlock videos have them at over 4k health and I'm sitting at less than 3k.
---
I have managed to solo the first 3 bosses but it's always touch and go. If I get sacrificed with anything less than full health I'm dead.
---
Maraudon is less potential gph for a solo farm but much more reliable currently
---
Swap earlier. Works best once you know your next target. If you know your group is killing skull too fast, swap to x etc.
---
Yea I wish I never went to college but that debt was sure enough to teach me to never do something so stupid again and now I own everything I have.

I really like it.

Good Job man

i did brd from 55-60 and got everything i needed.. however i am a tank druid.. so yeah not much i need
---
Axesmith and Armorsmith are the two meaningfully useful options in Classic. Basically go with whichever your realm has fewer of, whichever’s high demand recipes (Nightfall/Annihilator vs Lionheart Helm/those leg plates whose name is escaping me atm) you’re more likely to get, or whichever your guild needs. Hammersmith makes Sulfuron Hammer, but if that was going to be your job, you wouldn’t be here asking this question.
---
LOL 
---
There’s no way you actually took the time to upload this. I’m fucking dying right now.
---
&gt;"pugs should only play agaonst pugs, give premades a different queue where they only go up against eachother"
---
I don't think it's a bad idea actually, or at least make best pre-made vs best pre-made giving more honor. If it could be less about queue dodging and more about skill to rank up in BG that would be really cool.
---
There was basically zero PvP in phase 1, you were effectively in a pve server, which is what you obviously prefer
---
I saw a squad of 10 alliance entering through the main gates of orgrimmar. they killed the 2-4 guards there and then it was empty.
---
They also tried going for Saurfang, which did not end well for them, but that was their own fault. Lots of open area to go around him.
---
I made a crit cap calculator for dual wielding since I couldn't find one anywhere else.  You can plug in your current hit and weapon skill to show crit caps. If you're interested,  I'll send you the link.
---
Honest question: Is alchemy at all usefull in classic? Is it only good for making money and is it even good at that?
---
Afaik you dont get any "selfbuffs" from alchemy such as BOP gear. This means you could just buy all pots and be just as strong as an alchemist, correct?
---
Umm ... Mod Jed? Mod Reach?
---
Probably not my just my shit accounts, maybe accounts that aren't played much and appear "abandoned", there is literally no way to know without investigation from jagex but they don't reply.... Most security breaches in IT are inside jobs
---
They did this at launch, no one changed servers because because no one wants to be on a dead server
---
Made a dwarf rogue. There’s no way for them to look cool, so I made him look as disgusting as possible
---
When i wasn't wearing my.glasses your head looked like the letter M
---
I went to the effort to learn how to solo it on my Hunter and haven't even seen Gorosh yet. I'm gonna just stick with my Ogre Forged Hauberk till I get R9.
---
I'm planning to level a warlock alt once I'm done getting my pre raid bis on my paladin. I'm pretty much planning to just raidlog him til the week of the 10th
---
How bad will the road to 60 be? It took me about a month of real world time to hit 60 on my paladin.
---
We wiped horde guilds going to raid, fought over gurubashi and there was plenty of pvp over world resources.  It was basically all of the fun pvp on my server with none of the aids.
---
Then go with your t1 if you think its better.
---
220 more armor, nearly 50% more than t1 is a big Deal for me and also more stamina, both stats which are the most important for pvp.
---
And this is also only the blue one. So saying you dont get decent gear as a healer from pvp is total BS
---
Uhm yes. How often do you live because of 100 hp? HP is iust a resource, same as mana. Increasing the cap only matters if you use ALL of it. Increasing your efficiency is ALWAYS impactful. 100 HP is an extra auto attack. 21 shadowdamage is an extra 15 damage every 2.5 seconds with all three dots and drain life.
---
Except the cast left handed 🤢
---
Your buddy sounds a luttle presumptious wkth the "I wasted my time getting those honor kills". Like dude, its a video game. That should be FUN it shouldnt feel like a chore.
---
I did this back in TBC and spent the next two expansions hating myself for it. It’s so much more a grind back than to become a bloodstain admiral
---
&gt; usually
---
How often do you find you need to contact GMs?
---
Lmao same!
---
What else is there to do besides raiding right now lol
---
You’re locked from doing the first three bosses. 
---
Good news is that it’s pretty easy to find pugs that have gone past that near the end of the rest cycle (sun/mon). Bad news is you’ll have to join them meaning that you may have to skip a few extra bosses.
---
Is the guild linked to original on Al'Akir?
---
As much of an argument as anyone else has brought. Good job
---
Does anyone know of an add on that I could see what my current character is wearing gear wise and my alts? Similar to the bagon function where I can see what my alts have in their inventory and bank?
---
Male or female?
---
complete set is 95g total on my server.  it's all about that black dragonscale now
---
qq more. dont play a on pvp server if you cant handle getting killed.
---
That's not fun, I don't think that's fun. You can't have fun doing that.  STOP HAVING FUN, YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED.
---
Damn, lay off man, it's the life he dreams of, who are you to judge?
---
Okay?
---
Isn't it hard as priest since one ennervate on you kinda means a wipe? You have to be perfect with your LoS which is not always doable..
---
Wow you wiped them going to raid, you probably made them take an additional hour to get started. Broken and unplayable, should’ve been alliance-only queues /s
---
&gt; it's illegal to have an unpaid internship if the company benefits from it

Not many nerds I know would want that. They are either working in IT/programming/graphic design or have enough money to not need to work much to begin with (but they do for the fun of it). If you making a living playing video games and that us your dream job, more than happy for you and your family.
---
Druids charge costs rage, warriors charge gives rage

I think the only limit I have is that I would play the races with weapon racials if I played warrior/human.

Yeah, I'm not sure about the XP rate though, could be 2x or 3x.

Lol everyone here fell for it

4 words. G o b a c k t o r e t a i l

That’s like saying “robbing banks is the most efficient way to get more money so it’s their fault that I’m robbing the bank because I need more money and you can’t blame me because everyone wants more money I found this way to do it and it’s your fault not mine”
---
Solution to what problem? I ain't got no problems.
---
Not really.. delayed them by 5-10 minutes and stole their world buff.  But we also got wiped.. it was just about fun and ego.  None of the 12 hour a day camping bs.
---
But not as many buyers
---
When there's a 40:1 ratio in favor of their gank squad.
---
They would be going to another stalagg, but alliance dominated lol.
---
When they're Alliance.
---
Immobilization is for frost trap and kiting, it also affect fire trap. As you pointed out it's somewhat irrelevant for freezing trap but you could break the freezing trap and they may have been rooted.
---
NOT A BUG. This is a feature to allow alliance players to play the game in full color mode once per day.
---
I assure you if there were enough 60s in P1 the same shenanigans would’ve happened.
---
When you say join them and skip bosses, what do you mean?  Like I go in after 3 or just go and not get loot

Do you have a job? Because that's how hierarchy in the workplace functions. It's not a fucking democracy where everyone gets to vote on the best solution or just do whatever they want... Your boss tells you what to do and their boss tells them what to do all the way up the chain of command. I'm really upset that I have to explain this to someone in 2019.
---
Do you understand how numbers work?
---
There are way to many Horde in one place, and way too many Alliance in another place.
---
If the too many Horde go to where there are too many Alliance, you now have an even number of Horde and Alliance.

See how that works?

Park your character in BRD and just run that to 60... if your trying to quest your doing it wrong at this point, adapt and overcome
---
Right. Twitch never plays favorites and bans people without cause. It's never happened. Ever.
---
I'm just asking you to provide evidence for your claims. Advertise made a long video specifically to defend himself against this accusation. If you have something to counter that other than "NUH UH! HE DID IT!" please share.
---
Maybe you should get your lips off of Asmon's ass.
---
Same +damage with a ton more stats.  Sure you lose the damage buff from your offhand but the stats matter a lot.  The difference between the two is not massive and a mage passing on the staff in hopes of the mageblade is being dumb.
---
Umm... You realize these items are digital pixels and don't actually exist irl, right?

That's good stuff! Looks like the 60g is a good price

It’s like you hit the reply button with reading only one words out of two: I told that if I were to connect at 10am, I would probably have 0 person to play with (At 9pm on friday night I have more) 
---
Then PvP has no purpose than being fun for me and if it isn’t then I simply don’t participate like many others because there’s just no point. 
---
And it’s not a big deal: in phase 1 it was ok and as soon as BG are there it will mostly be ok too. In the end my point is just to tell alliance has almost no interest to fight back because it’s not like there’s something to win.
---
Horde can hop up the hill behind the ally base and get right in, avoiding the bridge chokepoint and most of the alliance guards.
---
I would of gone with. “Hey this guy just randomly sent me 600 gold.” (If I was going to contact them.)
---
iirc this behavior was in vanilla, in that case it was well known in advance. I could be wrong though.
---
Having only one pummeler is not even worth the effort lmao

Warriors perform amazingly in MC with almost fully BoE loot.
---
I wear 3 pieces of crafted black dragonscale, 2 pieces of devilsaur, 3 pieces that you can buy from hunters doing diremaul tribute, 2 axes I bought from the AH, and the Lionheart helm. The rest of my gear is all from quests besides hand of Justice which I farmed while leveling. I routinely get the absolute top dps on boss fights in a well geared guild against other warriors and rogues with epic raid weapons. 
---
You don't need drops from MC to perform amazingly right now, all you need to do is make gold doing literally anything in the game and you can be amazing.
---
I understand it’s a shot post but If you add strat/scholo/brs in at 54, this is how I leveled as a holy priest from 1-60.
---
LBRS patterns depend on the price on your server. DME is rng dependent, but the best 3 man farm if you get crystals.

How easily can your group 5 man UBRS? You can sell gear from there like TS shoulders/DR swords. Though, I suggest just farming your own pre-bis gear and getting into MC &amp; Ony so that you can eventually host Ony pugs and sell the head for fat gold or even scum it up with an MC pug. Rare patterns and selling BoPs is the best gold you can get.
---
You won't get banned for using a script that is wholly accessible in game. I wouldn't be surprised if it gets disabled because it uses a function that didn't exist in 1.12 but they're not gonna ban people for using it.
---
You see much ppl rolling and waering this because barely any of the pieces are BiS. Gotta wear the ugly leather healing shoulders and salamnder pants feelsbadman
---
This is what I'm wondering about. People have been playing classic for 15 ish years does anyone know if someone has put out a spreadsheet with the avg gph per / most profitable dungeon.
---
They very well may not be, thanks for your input though!
---
The shadow wrath items are typically BiS for raiding, and not for soloing content. You’ll want gear with significant intellect and stamina, with some +damage on the side. You need fire damage (for rain of fire) so you just want general spell damage, not just +shadow.
---
Same as PvP. It’ll be hilarious if people go into PvP wearing these items, they’ll be two-shot wherever they go. But at least their corruption will tick hard
---
I made a human warlock with a skin a bit to light for my tastings.. I'm so mad right now
---
People who play wow should already know what Macros are by now...
---
I did it with a 60 rogue
---
The only reason I ever make a character is because I thought of a name lol
---
Yes. It's called a customer service macro. Someone playing wow should absolutely know what a macro is.
---
So many Karens here.
---
Comment for saving
---
It's really not tho, Unyielding maw is currently better with counter weights the staff can't use and only gets better with elemental sharpening stones
---
We do this when we're short on friend online.
---
Tradeskill Master. It's an AH/Professions add-on. Steep learning curve but there's a ton of guides on it.
---
What lvl should I be to go to STV
---
Took 105 runs before I even see HoJ drop. In those 105 runs we got Gorosh 3 times. Warriors have the worst pre bis grind of all classes, and by pre bis I also include Lionheart helm in that grind.
---
Here are the keys to my Delorean.  Tell Doc I said "hi."
---
I think they nerfed the effective level of luffa since too many people were asking for it restored.
---
Ooo nice
---
Dont
---
That looks kinda crappy, now I feel better about not being able to get one.
---
Thanks for the suggestion but none of is skin.
---
Ah yea lets start rewarding people for fucking up! 
---
He missed it during getting the pattern
---
He missed it during the mats collection
---
He missed it during crafting.
---
At some point you gotta realize whos the problem...
---
Haha
---
That's not how it worked back then. He's outright locked to one raid ID and cannot enter another raid ID, and if he's raid lead and people zone into MC with his raid they'll immediately be locked to his raid ID.
---
i mean if you play the lock like you played ur paly itll take you less time. warlocks are pretty fast levelers also you can funnel gold and gear to em
---
Don’t play on a PvP server
---
Whenever I try that clear error text line in my macros I get a scary message pop up saying the macro I just made could be bannable.
---
&gt;*"And noone else will do!"
---
I'm actually not entirely sure how this would work. I imagine if person 1 created a raid group and entered MC with the saved ID and then person 2 tried to create a raid and go in it would deny the 2nd person. However it makes me question if person one only had 20 people in their raid group, could person 2 enter with their own 20 person raid to the same raid id and effectively have 2 20 man raids in the same instance at the same time.
---
I doubt it works this way but it would be interesting to say the least.
---
Warrior, ele/rsham, holy/disc priest, warlock last one can be whatever, with rogue being least desireable.  
---
The most important thing to remember is that what horde has, which alliance dont is shaman and shaman is vastly superior to paladin because of how useful they are.  Any team comp you make should bring a shaman.
---
Have my agreement and my upvote.
---
That said, consider using the singular “they” instead of the more clunky “(S)he” when speaking about someone of an unknown gender.
---
I doubt it.  In phase 1 people often just passed each other by when farming.. if you're herbing and there's no reason to kill, you get less of it.  Now everything is an instant gank fest.
---
*Laughs in Ungoro Crater*
---
LBRS has a ton of weapons that drop and is fairly easy/quick with a good group. Really good gold plus UBRS key.
---
Damn, thank you, I never would have thought of that lol
---
Maybe if you're rested, but you definitely don't get 1 level a run non-rested in DM
---
If you want to play on a pvp server you have to deal with it. That’s part of playing on a pvp server. If you transfer to a pve server you won’t be able to transfer back. 
---
How is that fair? Leveling on above server just to move over and gank those leveling on a pvp? 
---
Seems more like you should level pve and just que for bg’s when those come out. Also some pve servers already have pvp events. I would check those out once you hit 60. 
---
But complaining that you can’t play on a pvp server because you are getting killed is like saying you want a trophy just for being on the team.
---
Yes. I've actually rolled characters for vanilla enough times(beta, regular, private servers, and now classic) that I have standardized looks I use to make one character of each class(two of each race, 1 of each gender within that race).
---
yeah keep the star lol. youre misses will just be worse
---
I know this works in retail but I don't know if it works in classic
---
Instead of /target, try /targetenemy
---
I feel you lmao. I frequently grind the elite mobs outside zf in tanaris for gold and would often see level 50s stroll by going towards the dungeon, and I used to just /greet and continue doing what I was doing. That changed when every undead mage decided to camp me for 5+ deaths on their way to the instance on my 67/33 server. Now while leveling mining in arathi and 1k needles I drain the mana of any horde mage I see aoe farming + concussive shot so they die to the mobs. And then if I'm bored shadowmeld and one shot them with an aimed shot when they spawn for good measure. The thirsty desperate mentality of people farming honor has turned me into a monster.
---
mine is probs wrong to then. yeah this sucks.
---
Sounds like you want a PVE server then, with opt-in PvP flags.
---
I do 3g a person for any wing of SM open roll. 2g a person and I get all loot except anything BiS that may drop from bosses.
---
Idk why I'm gonna have to keep doing this but I want you to look up **feral tank bis wow classic.**  Every single source tells you its Warden staff.  
---

---
I mean I learned a ton in college and I make more now than half my mates who graduated so it is what it is and I learned from my mistake.  I’ll still be debt free by 35.
---
Save mana phase 1 and go ham on phase 2. Phase 3 chill for a bit before burning her down and you'll usually get decently high on the charts. Ony isn't really a parse fight though it's more of a test to see who doesn't mess up.
---
Majordomo is just an awkward fight, our guild aoes the first round of adds and that can help but the spell reflects during healers just drop your dps if you aren't careful
---
When is Blizzard going to allow me to transfer off Skeram? My friends keeping me there have already quit and I would love to be able to play this game again.
---
WoW was the exact moment where I saw a new breed of MMO gaming come around who didn't play for the fun and played to engage in the Skinner box.
---
So this is the right game for him.
---
Can you elaborate on what is wrong with the response?  It says they know about the problem, and the GMs don’t know the solution yet.  What else do you want them to do?
---
What loot issues won’t they support?  You can trade master loot mistakes and there is an item restoration service.  Its a system that has worked just fine in retail for many years.  Which class is entirely broken compared to vanilla?
---
\-&gt; PvE server
---
I don't know man, internet tough guy comments are pretty fun to read.
---
I work 8 months of the year and do little stuff during winter too.  This just happens to be my obsession for right now.
---
If your tank's holding them at the corners it does make life a lot easier, but I also carry a handful of jungle remedies for those occasions when the last boss decides to be a dick and enervate me during the add transition. They're about 30s on my server, so it's easily worthwhile.
---
For $99 you wanted a metal statue the same size (~10" tall) ? What
---
That’s barely PvP, you were playing PvE+5min to rex a raid
---
One cat 50 msk, two cat 75 msk!
---
It's not a reward though... A reward would.mean he gained something additional for making a mistake. This is just a break. Cut people some slack every now and then and you'll likely be a happier person, too.
---
Yeah I literally don't care what your websites say lmao... 3% attack speed is better than any extra stats warden gives you. Thanks for playing, but you're wrong, now stop spouting dumb BS that's wrong
---
The real shot show, I would get on at 6am just to be able to quest for an hour without dying lol
---
Disagree on lots of mages being fire spec, there definitely are some but most are still frost. Do agree on CoT though, it helps to get it out early to slow down a Poly/Bolt/Nova combo. Can throw an Agony up on after that point against most mages
---
I think people are over reacting...
---
This is part of the *classic no changes* experience, for better or worse. I think Blizzard understood the headache that Phase 2 has been causing for a lot of players, which they're answering with Battlegrounds coming before Phase 3.
---
I would suggest dungeon-grinding or waiting for December 10th, which will probably clear up the world quite a bit.
---
The Priest can just pop a restorative potion as soon as its applied.
---
What is seen can not be unseen. Meatspin and goatse, those were the days
---
Vanilla servers were fully functional with 2k and less, but popular pservers have painted a narrative that anything less than that is *dEaD*.
---
It’s the truth. You’re whining about the whiners, and now you’re whining about people telling you that you’re whining about the whiners. You’re about to go full meta when you whine about me in a couple minutes.
---
There is likely something out there but not that I know of in particular. Personally I like this approach with a group because it feels quick and the effort required is quite low. It's surprising how much easier dungeons can be when you've got a coordinated group, chillin on comms, etc. It allows bigger pulls, easier target focus, smoother CC and so on. Hell if it's a group of friends you could even agree to split any big BOE drops, all around an even enough gold earn for all folks in the party.
---
Find me a single source. Just one.  One source that says anything but Warden Staff.  I'll wait.
---
ty it works!
---
Personally ive made more money on a low pop server than a high pop.
---
It feels good to know there are people that understand. Took me 360+ runs to get Savage Glad to drop and 164 for HoJ. Never again... lol
---
By restoring he gets his time and mats back, which are at the moment rightfully gone. So yea its a reward; he ends up with more then he deserves.
---
But ye, looking forward to your next pathetic argument.
---
Not sure how not wanting to get ganked over and over while trying to run a few quests is like getting a participation trophy but I have to say it’s spoken like a 60 who doesn’t want to lose their low level consumable
---
I can almost guarantee people would be annoyed by this change as soon as a new raiding tier comes out and you can't find a group for older content for your alt.
---
I want to maximize my DPS for PVE - Question is regarding which trinket combo is optimal. I have a few epics, and mainly BiS gear... 
---
Trinkets:
---
1) Eye of Beast +Briarwood reed ( 2% Crit + 29spell dmg)
---
2) Briarwood Reed + Royal Seal (29 spell dmg + 23 spell dmg)
---
Currently I am SM-Ruin spec w/ +5% crit chance from destro tree. Which is the way to go?
---
You're married to the instance you killed 3 bosses in.  If you join someone elses raid it won't let you zone in.  If you're the raid leader, then when everyone zones in they'll be saved to your MC with 3 bosses down.  
---
Also note that if anyone else who is saved to that raid ID has gone in and killed anything else - you will be saved to whatever progress they made too.
---
Once you kill a boss in a raid, you're saved to that raid ID until the reset.  You can bring people who aren't saved to an ID with you to yours.
---
This is what I’m doing. Living in dungeons until 60.
---
Blizzard always sends an automated response at first. You just have to reply that your issue has not been solved and then you'll get a real person.
---
Tbh this aint even that bad. I had a response with smilies and borderline UwU's on a bugged quest in Legion that stopped me from completing a quest to unlock one of my artifact weapons.
---
Ok beefybits
---
STVietnam
---
Tons of people play rust, a game with persistence and varying degrees of progression wipes weekly.
---
Point is, if the gameplay is fun, people would.
---
He’s paying for a service that’s not being provided...
---
Have to be invited to groups for this to be useful, some of us can't seem to make that dream a reality.
---
He already said lady.
---
I'm almost afraid for it to drop.
---
If transfers open up more, it will be one way, PvP &gt; PvE.  They are not going to allow PvE &gt; PvP.  Just because of how much easier it is to level on PvE server that there would be floods of 60s on PvP servers.
---
Hitting 60 on a PvP server post Phase 2 is an accomplishment you should be proud of.  I'm 57 and still headed towards 60.  I've just accepted the dunking from 60s as part of the game.  It has made me more willing to gank lowbies as a result though, so it makes everyone less safe.
---
He said exactly that
---
I think a lot of people just haven't seen it written out having only heard it spoken aloud and assume it "would of." It has to be one of the most common bone apple teas, I see it all the time.
---
Lmao
---
We are on an alliance majority server and we camp the boat just fine. It gives us a free res, if a too big raid comes we just get off and get back 5 mins later.
---
&gt;  the greatest weapon Alliance on my server have is to not participate at all. 
---
There you have it everyone, the Alliance's secret weapon, **giving up**. No wonder your faction is such a pushover, you guys give up at the 1st sign of adversity.
---
Sounds like you want a PVE server.
---
P servers had no trouble doing it. Why does Blizz?
---
This is the problem.  There was another issue from 3am to 8am that every one is referring to.  But now the honor is getting messed up for everyone.
---
Yessssss great! I loved it!!!
---
&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3
---
You ever look at the helmet and think “yellow kkk”?
---
No?
---
I think it looks cool
---
The latter, but also tank threat I'd assume.
---
Fighting Onyxia as a Rogue. When phase 2 is starting, do any of you use Rupture just before she takes to the air?
---
In a high damage group, you'll be lucky to get one shadow bolt out after casting your 4 DoTs on a regular elite mob. Check what sources your damage is coming from on the dmg meter addon you're using, you'll find curse of agony to be a complete waste. 
---
Also make sure you're only drinking if the group actually allows for that. Most groups clear trash at a pace where only life tap gives you a chance to keep up, and groups running that well don't need a lot of healing, so make the  healers mana bar your own.   
---
I've finished dungeons with more healing taken than the tank, and 99.9% of that healing was life tap, not overagro.
---
Not exactly.  But sure, let's go with that.
---
Hahaha yet here you are in the highly blizzard specific ClassicWoW subreddit.
---
Will you keep your reputation with bloodsail?
---
Also if you have a mage in your group, have them use detect magic, then you can actually see the honorless buff
---
This sums it up right here.
---
On my server the flame sacs sell for about 1g and the chili goes for only 60s at best. Good indication of how useful people feel it is.
---
Yeah that happened to me on Grobbulus
---
&gt;You need fire damage (for rain of fire)
---
[https://i.imgur.com/Xg2uV8X.png](https://i.imgur.com/Xg2uV8X.png)
---
\+31 fire damage (hypnotic blade, scorching sash, inquisitors shawl) resulted in a meager +2 damage on each RoF tick. 
---
You are looking at a mere 1,2% damage increase. On an extremely mana-intensive spell.  For comparison, that kind of spell power increases each shadowbolt by 26 dmg.   
---
Do \*not\* stack +fire for rain of fire. The return is negligible - and Hellfire is even worse.
---
Is there any place that sells blank figurines like this that you can paint ala Warhammer 40k?
---
Would be kinda fun painting Ony and Rag.
---
Yeah as far as Horde you start with Warr + Shaman + Lock and go from there. I think having a Shadow Priest is super good if your Shaman is Resto or have a holy Priest and an Ele Shaman. This naturally leaves a Druid as your other heals.
---
As a warrior, I agree. The fact that they have 7 different AoE's they can use on command is BS. As far as overall game balancing goes, you shouldn't be able to have them across multiple specs without having to go deep into it. Being able to run up into a crowd and select a "I win" button to mash at random, is ridiculous.
---
 &gt;Should ANY class be able to solo farm at level dungeon elites?
---
No. Even on my warlock I feel kinda dirty being able to solo an elite 2-3 levels above me. Being able to clear an at level instance with AoE is just silly. There is no way you can argue that it fits into legitimate game balancing.
---
The pservers didn't paint that narrative, the players did. When Nostalrius relaunched, the realm had around 10k players, Elysium had 12k and Zethkur had 3k. 88% of the players opted for the high pop realms.
---
I raid on a warlock.. but int/Stan means almost nothing and +damage is WAAAY more important for a raid and for PvP (1 int = .02 spell power) the 1H gives you a lot more flexibility and you can actually use PvP offhands. With AV coming out, you can get an offhand that offers +34 spell power.
---
For perspective, the difference in the +damage is pretty massive as +30 spell damage enchant goes for ~400gold on my server. 
---
Also, Paladins get a +31 healing mace. Caster DPS use witch blade (+14 damage) or locks can use blade of the new moon (+19 shadow damage). Mageblade is a MUCH bigger upgrade for DPS than it is for paladins so it should be prio for DPS.
---
Indian Interns!
---
I'm glad this is the top post, proves that Classic WoW sub is not yet a shithole.
---
Just run out to fatigue water.
---
You gain less reputation than you lose. You can only be friends with one faction at a time because of it.
---
There was an indirect workaround (you could gain rep for party kills without losing it from the other side?), but I think it was a bug that got patched early on.
---
Yea, alchemy is really useful! And its very good at making money ofc. I make 2000-2500 gold a day and i profit 20-33% of that. Really just depends on the day, and what time of potion sells the most. For reference, my best selling potion is greater fire protects, i sell about 100ish of those a day and on raid day ill sell 200ish. But that's just me, because i have a large capital that i can work it, and i also know alchemist pricing strategy and how to play the auction house. Realistically, most alchemist i see loose money, which is  unfortunate, as this profession gives big bucks.
---
You don't any buffs nor gear for being an alchemist. You could just pay the pots, but you'll be paying more than if you bought the materials alone and crafted them yourself. Although if you only want alchemy for yourself, and not to make money, the best option would be to buy the materials and get a guild buddy to make them for you.
---
I'm on grobbulus, last time I checked we are +/- 4% of each other.
---
It still takes me, as a horde, 7 to 10 death runs to get to bed or around 30 to 45 minutes of gameplay.
---
It isnt a faction balance issue, it's a population issue.
---
This is massively changed.
---
I dunno man. I've been seeing rogues blind pet, and rogue fear pet. I can't count on the succi as though it's an auto win....

Dear diary, today I woke up and brushed my teeth then...
---
Did a full level with my horde char there lvl 53-54 just with questing. Plus loads of herbs and farmed Demonic Runes there for Robe of the Void
---
The flipside:
---
Warrior + healer isn't a x2 powerboost. More like x6.
---
Find a healer buddy.

My bad then, I deleted.

Bananadin

Level 22 bud.
---
We will get the upgraded dungeon gear quests eventually, though! I dont like raiding either, so that beastmaster set is gonna be my best option for staying competitive. Although once people are stomping around in Naxx gear it wont be so competitive anymore haha.
---
The +mace skill does not matter in PVP, spinal should be fine in PVP , I would prefer earthshaker personally for the 18 percent chance to stun.
---
from behind
---
You need burst to secure kills in PvP as a Hunter regardless of the class. Damage output over 10 seconds is obviously different from damage over 10 minutes
---
you will see it drop, you just won’t win the roll
---
Source: Lost Ban’Thok Sash 6 times now
---
If you're a horde warrior you need a priest for dispels and a shaman for windfury. The remaining two slots can be whatever class you want really.
---
i dont think you know what "random" means op
---
This is how it works on retail currently.  But is not how it works in classic.  You are locked to the MC you ran.  You can continue with this raid lockout IF no one from the original group has already done the same.  
---
If you as raid lead make a group you will be able to continue but any bosses already killed will not re-spawn.  
---
If someone from the original group has already used the ID to clear the instance then you will be locking everyone in a new group that you form to a cleared raid.
---
&gt;  if the warrior was soloing they'd be fine killing a mob solo 
---
Bold assumption.
---
I second this. GW2 is exactly what you're looking for. Once you're max level and have whatever gear set works for you, you are done. You can do pretty much all content in the game as efficiently as people who do it day in/day out.
---
Looks like tons of fun, LOL

---
It's actually all about management juggling, which is easier for hunters imo. For example, ppl have this generalization locks can dot, wand, fear, multiple adds. In reality you're life tapping every few spells, and lifedrain tanking health back. It's a Mana health battle. Huntters, with better aggro pets, can just steamroll one at a time as you ask.
---
Do you play on an RP PvE server, if so which one?
---
doesnt matter the fight is piss easy anyway
---
I wish they were up to jagex level CS
---
Completely understand. Do you think all the horde will do that? It's completely unreasonable in practice. Do you really think horde want to transfer to a server and he stopped at the same level they're stomping on their current server hoping that more people show up? IF they ever do? Goodness gracious.
---
For my experience first time playing retail was great (legión) and the two first weeks feel like a new wow to me. After that seeing the City without people, there wasnt anyone to talk or quest.. I quit after the first month.
---
But hell classic is life, I really enjoy my time here not rushing to 60
---
It'll be early January 100%. Go look at vanilla release, bgs came out 5 weeks before BWL. January will be when 5 weeks hits since bgs in classic, so there's no way in hell BWL is coming later than January. Nothing so far has been kept to a proper schedule, everything has been rushed. Safe to assume they will rush BWL.
---
Burst is still dependent on how much of a damage boost your items give you. Hunter gets less of a damage boost from items, and thus less burst, in AQ40. Not sure how to make that more clear
---
...no I absolutely didn't, you're just too incredibly dumb to get my point 😄 The fact that stream sniping being comparable to genocide even enters your brain proves that you are in fact projecting, mein Führer.
---
What I did, was highlight your dumb ass logic. He can stream snipe all he wants, and twitch has the right to ban him when he does. Again, get out of his butthole and stop being such a loser.
---
Just got to 60 as warrior, got devilsaur set yesterday and Im aiming at Lionheart rn. Whats the best way to farm the mats? I suppose I should be looking for Thorium mines as a miner, what are the best routes for you guys? I also have a 32 alt druid, should I level alch on him for arcanites? Thanks!
---
Exactly.  Take it from a former warrior who chose an easy class this time - just make a mage.
---
Ahh, the streamer "I miss when leveling was part of the game" guide.
---
Yo got one for horde
---
So then there's no evidence other than you claiming there is.
---
And you noticed I copied what you said and how stupid it sounded? Hmm.
---
It's like you're so close to a little bit of self-reflection but can't take that next step.
---
My body is stuck, and I believe it takes you back to the nearest graveyard. And then sickres i guess xD
---
Alliance literally spend their whole time triggered
---
Ok, Beezwhatevernickname
---
Damn, you was faster.
---
ooooh a real badass mhmm.. ?
---
Seriously though... why is there so much hate for Horde all over Reddit?  Is it just because more Alliance are on reddit or something?
---
I am on Kironos that is Horde heavy (I think), and I play Horde.  Though, in the mid 50's I am constantly being hunted by Alliance death squads.  I am not saying Horde don't do the same thing... but it gets a little old seeing people non stop talking about Horde gank squads when it happens boths ways lol.
---
That's the point of my post though. Classic is life.
---
I have God of War and Spiderman sitting unopened on-top of my PS4 because Classic WAS LIFE, if I loaded up any other game I felt like that was time that should be put into Classic.
---
I was doing benediction quest line and I was about to die so I had my friend run in and the cleaner killed me. Now I can't restart the quest as the quest giver has despawned. Did I do it right?
---
I've been hated by them since wrath. Only recently started going for the insane title. A few years too late, but whatever
---
You found a perfectly ripe banana at the store? Grats!
---
No more getting stoned and posting on Reddit for me.
---
K.
---
Bloodsail admirals at least get a hat. Can you wear respect on your head? I didn’t think so.
---
yeah, my actual set for raiding is far less attractive.
---
Need more rage
---
Ya I too hate instantly finding groups to run dungeons with and not competing for any gear.
---
You think horde won't make premades too?  There are going to be less complaints than there is now about the wpvp (for good reason).  But both sides are going to get stomped by premades frequently.
---
Classic at this stage is just toxic, on a PvP server. You only have to wake up in  the morning, check Reddit and see dozens of crybabies posting 'I Am CaMpED'
---
Sure

Send away

Im thankfull for any help!

Hoj is overvalued, but that's just me

I mean ally ganked me the whole time I quested from a week before phase 2 hit so idk what you're talking about, same shit happens on both sides 
---
*inc paragraph about server imbalance making it significantly worse and crying*
---
Yes, you should throw a rupture and then start firing your ranged weapon. You should also be able to hit her with melee abilities when she's directly overhead, to refresh ruptures or build combo points.
---
This is for Ally. Get to 20 on your own (Darkshore and Westfall are fastest for 10-20). 
---
Deadmines until 22 (get some nice gear).
---
Stockades until 31.
---
SM Lib until 36.
---
SM Arm until 38.
---
SM Cath until 44.
---
ZF (only to stairs) until 52.
---
BRD dungeon area until 54.
---
LBRS orc area (up to ogres) until 60.
---
This assumes you are joining same level, non-boosted runs. For instance, Stockades is better xp/hour than Deadmines so if you can buy boosted runs at level 17, for instance, its faster doing that. It also means getting gear from Deadmines is unnecessary. Similarly, skip SM Lib/Arm and go straight to Cath runs if you are buying boosted runs.
---
I can only hope to be an uninformed dunce like you someday.
---
Right but what you’re missing is the part where the “less of a damage boost” affects PvE far, far more *relatively speaking* than PvP
---
Ehh ignored him I think your was post was worthwhile. There’s pros and cons to this game let’s not pretend it’s perfect.
---
Vanish was always bugged in vanilla too though
---
Me too friend. I also generally randomize my name as well, however in classic I'm just reusing names I had on retail from the randomizer.
---
This is kind of what they try to do in overwatch.  If you are grouped up with people you will either go up against other people grouped up or people at a higher rating than you.  Of course with WoW there are no ratings so harder to implement.
---
Imagine wasting half your life on spamming dungeona non stop on purple experience.
---
BiS gear really doesnt matter for paladins. Flash heal gets a 40% coefficient from +healing and blessing of light adds a flat healing bonus to flash and holy light. Early on int is insanely good for paladins since they dont have enough crit to have completely infinite mana while healing.
---
They do? Only comment I ever saw from Blizzard was that it was an idea but they weren't sure yet.
---
You could always play retail, I heard class balance is their number 1 goal.
---
I did the grind to r13 back in the day and can’t fathom why people would even bother or think they’re gonna get rank 14 through world PvP. You guys are legit hardcore grinding for ranks that level 27 druids get in warsong gulch. I’d take a closer look at everything that goes into the honor system calculation before you blow an aneurysm playing 20 hours a day trying to get the coveted rank of master seargent 😂😂😂😂.
---
What is the world coming too man. Why do people like you insist on spreading info you really dont know anything about? Just shut your mouth
---
That's an amazing hint!
---
Comment for saving.
---
yeah, as a dps you're probably stuck in BRD sans guildy carries, but starting at 55 as healer I was able to join pub groups running LBRS, Strat Live/Undead, UBRS
---
It's part of the game man. PvP servers were designed for Horde to fight Alliance and vice versa.  Why do you think I joined a PvP server? To PvE? Lol nah.
---
At this point I’m used to it.
---
The first ticket will always get a form response that doesn’t address the issue.
---
The second ticket onwards has a chance if you get a good customer service rep.
---
Good to know for next time. Pissed me off having to ride the boat and fly all the way back lol. I forgot this was a thing back in classic.
---
There is a reason Rust is not nearly as popular as World of Warcraft.
---
Why?
---
75% of pvpers don't care. 75% of current wpvp'ers are just there to grief the opposite faction
---
Wow I respect your opinion but I realllllly disagree with you. I think it's one of the coolest looking combinations.
---
Always go spell dmg since it scales imo
---
I’m picky about how my characters look, if I am going to spend hours and hours looking at them I want them to look good
---
Azshara is the best zone. If you do the “fallen hero of the horde” questline from blasted lands, it will have you running all over the azshara coast and visiting the islands and ruins there for hours with a 5 man group killing elite named bosses. Its a destination zone for a ton of high level quests.
---
&gt;Why were the layers capped at 3000 players when multiple layers were around? 
---
It was at start when people were more or less clumped to the same zones. They have mentioned it specifically they will lower the amount of layers + enlarge layer sizes. Right now population is spreaded out levels-wise all over the Azeroth so they can handle it.
---
My idea why the overall server cap is around 6000 is because people are much more incentivized to dungeons and not open world. Much more people raid now than before compared to classic. Much more people do the dungeon farm instead of the open world farm, I think they have based the cap around that. Still, only several realms have this cap filled, most realms have concurrent online around 3k which can peak to 4k during usual RT which doesn't create any open world overpopulation as well.
---
What really tilts me, it's people complaining about their own imaginary 10k or 15k populations which are nowhere close to reality.
---
Maybe Blizzard don't care as much as they should. If people drop the game because it's unplayable for them this way, it becomes a self-fulfillment prophecy of Blizzard expecting Classic not to be as popular: and realms will stop being overpopulated. Then, of course, we will have people complaining about dead realms but that's whole another story.
---
I choose my toon according what's like he'll look like with the Mythic pve gear. female models of blood elves and tauren looks good af \^\_\^
---
Just keep pushing man. You’ll get through sooner or later.
---
Just curious because I recently bought gold in Classic and am worried.  How do you know they don't ban?  What do they do if you are caught?  I bought about 800 gold or so and im panicking thinking ill get banned or they will roll me back in like a month or so when i do get caught.  The person sent it to me over the in game mail, kinda dumb
---
You have a 15 year old game you know everything about and STILL you chose to suck? I don’t know what to say to you man
---
If the target is going to die in the duration of your taunt, that’s a wasted taunt.
---
Anyone who has ever said that 5% extra HP doesn’t matter is 95% flat out wrong. What an absolutely idiotic thing to say.
---
Mages turn to wet noodles when the fight progresses, but the warrior gets stronger and stronger. I like that aspect of warrior:)
---
Nick is not gruntled by this response
---
Yeah man, mages really struggle with all of those things too...
---
But dude its ***THE HOLIDAYS***! That makes everything happy fairy land where we all get what we want because that's how the world works!
---
I started playing on Shazzrah and got to lvl 3 but I feel like I'm so lost
---
There's a huge exp penalty if they're lower level than you. The only real benefit of rushing dungeons with lowbies would be to complete quests or grab gear.
---
Kookykamala woulda been so much better
---
Point is, i’m working hard in WoW to earn honor and I’m also playing the game because I enjoy doing it. If you take away the aspect for of earning honor while other players are still earning, that would make the game less fun for anyone.
---
Sorry you have such an issue with being wrong but you’ve lost this one bud. Stop replying.
---
Living like an Irish potato field peasant is hardly the life most of us dream of.
---
How do you know how he got his kills?
---
Sitting people out won't correct that fact that mistakes happen.
---
But to each their own, if you're fine with such extreme measures for such a trivial thing, then have it your way my dude
---
Wrong. Horde can win AV faster, every time.
---
If the tank has the boss standing with its back to a pillar, the healer can position so they are LoS of the tank but not LoS of the boss. This means they never get hit with ennervate as long as nobody moves.
---
After that it becomes a matter of being able to handle the imps without aggroing the rest of the packs in the area.
---
My opinion is Blizzard shouldn't forcefully fix something which community brought upon themselves willingly. The proper idea might be faction-based transfers but they have implemented it too late and allowed alliance exodus.
---
Nobody knows since there's no queue times on Skeram atm
---
Depends mostly on how many warlocks you raid with and what their crit rate is. You basically want ISB to have 100% uptime between all raid members, so if your fellow warlockbros have high crit and ensure ISB being up, go for sheer spell damage IMHO. That being said, crit is never wasted if you have Ruin.
---
Look at the salt this post made loool
---
How are you not 60 yet
---
This would be better if he got the levels right
---
I just feel that it could be actually epic to have the best premade BGs against each other for R14 instead of the queue dodging farming that will likely happend.
---
This is wrong. The XP penalty (which isn’t that high) is conpletely offset by the fact that a competent carry can clear the entire dungeon in 10-15 mins
---
But it only sounded stupid when you said it, because you were actually brown-nosing while I wasn't. 😂
---
Also, what's your proof that Twitch doesn't have proof that he stream sniped? Hm?
---
Check mate. ♥
---
A - the fact that it is just plain copy/pasted. We can get into a debate on whether that's good or bad but in my mind, it's terrible customer service.
---
B - They got the name completely wrong which is just disgraceful.
---
They will not support any loot issues. Ninjas, bugs, you name it. We had the melee trinket drop  in BRD, my friend won the roll, the item disappeared. He didnt' get it in his bags, the body did not hold the item. it was gone. He opened botha ticket and live chat and was told "too bad" pretty much, appealed it a couple of times and got a warning. Similarly, if someone ninjas things in dungeons, raids, etc. Blizzard simply do not care unlike the many years master loot existed in retail where they would intervene.
---
Hunters are broken in PvP, feign does not work correctly like it did in vanilla. Rogues are broken, cheap shot and vanish both do not work correctly (even after the hotfix).
---
A lot of classes can solo elites, basically anything with a root/slow/fear can solo elites, as a Druid I can solo literally anything as long as it's not immune to roots, sometimes I can get 4-5 starfires off on a mob before the roots break, it's insanely broken.
---
By 'mana user knockback' you mean the fireballs? Yeah no shit thats why range spreads out.
---
Deadmines at level 10? Lol.
---
15 through the automated process iirc.
---
If you are able to, transfer to earthfury. It was an overflow server for queue relief so it’s full of semi casuals who only play in the evenings and has even been nicknamed the dad server.
---
If you're going to rock a sword n board then reck build is something you could consider. Don't do it if you plan on wielding a 2H though because it's too many wasted talent points in the prot tree.
---
Add their shitty spell batching to that too.
---
I'd probly assume the GM are sick of these petty shit lol.
---
To no one's surprise Advertise was blatantly stream sniping today. I guess he learned nothing from getting banned.
---
You most certainly did and didn’t even know it. Any tank not using shield slam is probably arms.
---
Pre-sons rag kills were a regular thing once BWL gear was available. Became even more common when we got all the buffed blue items people got to start Classic with. Everyone keeps forgetting that the gear people had to work with in MC during vanilla was garbage. Almost everything was pure str/agi/int/stam/spi gear. The tier 0 stuff like Valor was some of the best stuff you could get. There was basically no +dam/healing or hit gear. Even the loot from MC itself was shitty then and the stuff you are getting now is the buffed versions. Now mix all that awesome loot we get to start with this time with the fact that you are working with the nerfed version of MC that we got just before BC was released. Almost all the boss, especially Rag, have considerably smaller health pools. Knowledge of the mechanics are a big part of MC being much easier this time, but better gear and nerfed boss health plays a much larger part.

Meta
---
Same with my 53 disc priest. I’ve already got a macro that begs mages for lvl 45 water.
---
I use Band names that feel like they fit the class/race.
---
I have a Orc Warrior named Meshuggah,  Sounds very orcish.
---
I have an undead rogue named, Kidneythief ( There is a band Kidney Theives)
---
I have an undead mage named: Deftones
---
I still sit at the creation screen for way too long picking a name. A great name makes me really want to play that character.
---
It's tough finding people to do stuff like that during the day when I can play.
---
Diablo wipes out progress in leagues to... Know what the key difference is? You know going in to it.
---
 A better analogy I guess is: would you continue to play if you were the only person in your guild to have everything wiped out every week, and have to futilely watch on the sidelines as everyone else's character progresses.
---
What addon should I use to see which abilities are being cast by an enemy?
---
OP should heroic strike IRL to dump some of this rage..
---
You need to be able to hit the button like 5 times a second. 
---
I am always that guy in raid that is /lay and spams this in circles lol.
---
The comment you originally replied to was literally about PvE scaling relative to PvP scaling
---
Double it and you have the amount of deaths it takes allowance to get to BRM.
---
That would induce lag but you could have your character run forward until you stopped spamming it and then it would snap you back into place?
---
Her brother gives way better head
---
I really don't understand either. I have played both factions over multiple versions of the game, retail, private servs and Classic, and the alliance have always been the meme faction for me. Of course there's that one orc warrior charging on sight every single time, but it never even came close to the alliance's cowardly behavior. a bunch of gnome mages farming lowbies on a beach, or locking down an entire city (all its exit points), or straight up multiboxing near flight master and 5x frostbolt when someone lands. The ganks, running away every time there's a potential fair fight coming but ganking EVERYTHING that's 7+ levels lower or alone against 3+. I don't understand why suddenly they act like it's the opposite lol
---
Benediction?
---
I don't really agree with that, the rest of the dungeon is easily 57-58 but not 60.  Emp is 59 so a 57 tank should do just fine (and has, in my experience), and the trash from the bar to emp is not very difficult either.
---
Well, you are not wrong.
---
What lol? Dying in a room in ironforge room in a 1v1 isn’t a 1v1? Sorry you nor I had all cds up and were standing in a duel area rofl. That’s not how 1v1s work in classic mate. No one gives a fuck about duels Antimage.
---
I have done it for 45 seconds+ 
---
I just can vibrate my arm very fast lol. No macros. I can click 12.4 times a second on a mouse.
---
My biggest problem is repairing. I wish you could rep in BRD. I would never leave again.

Hi, /u/Poncho90

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e3i9f4/unplayable_piece_of_s_gz_blizz/). 
---
Pretty much. the rule of thumb on my warlock is as long as I can fear it I can kill it.
---
Imagine briefing your faction for weeks, then being surprised when they don't participate in wpvp.
---
PEANUT BUTTER JELLY TIME. PEANUT BUTTER JELLY PEANUT BUTTER JELLY...
---
You have the highest single target DPS as a hybrid class who can tank... As a mage, Warrior is by far the best group content class in the game. The envy goes both ways man. 
---
Sure we can AoE to level and spend half the time played vs a warrior to get to 60 but 60 is where the game starts for many, and if you're playing long term you will have much more time spent at 60 than not. Mages do have the QoL of portals but if you have a non-shit guild you can always just ask a homie for a portal.
---
Mages aren't even the best class to farm gold with, they are easily outclassed by lock and hunter cause it's easier to farm instance bosses. Each class has their own strengths, even Druid. Why is it so bad that mages can AoE?
---
This sub is like 90% alliance crying about pvp but sure
---
Dunno.   The thieves all stole them.
---
&gt;TBC is not relevant, is it?
---
It absolutely is relevant, and it's a good showcase of how statements like this
---
&gt; a stun that may or may not end up being useful. 
---
Are not indicative of the reality of serious PvP. A stun will never not be useful, at worst it keeps your target still for 3 seconds (essentially a root that prevents targets from dodging / parrying) which is pretty fucking good for any melee class already, at best it interrupts a cast, gets you a kill you couldn't normally get, forces a blink, cancels out a rogue's evasion allowing your next MS to connect despite it, etc. Stuns are king.
---
&gt; As for the dps argument, Idk why you're trying to twist words. 
---
I'm not twisting words, you're just failing to grasp why weapon DPS is irrelevant. Ashkandi could have 20 DPS over Sulfuras, but if they had the same damage range, most of the time Sulfuras would probably be just as good, because you almost never get to hit your swing timer perfectly. You'll switch weapons, you'll get slowed and be out of range temporarily, you'll charge a different target, you'll turn your character slightly too much and get "facing the wrong way", etc. There is no universe where you pick a weapon based on DPS over its other attributes.
---
And even if you DID manage to stick to the target like glue for 30 seconds, the extra DPS (not weapon damage) that Ashkandi has over Sulfuras amounts to about half a Fireball proc, completely disregarding the fact that Sulfuras will give you bigger yellow attacks (the majority of your damage in PvP) on average.
---
&gt; But 3.5 seconds isn't at all a bad time. It's decidedly better than the BRE swing timer, for instance. 
---
Actually technically speaking, anything above or below 3.3 is strictly speaking a worse swing timer, since that's what 2H attacks get normalized AP gains from. But as explained, pure DPS is not the reality of PvP anyway - going for a slower weapon has the massive advantage of stronger yellow attacks, even when their AP gain is normalized, and yellow attacks are more important than white in PvP.
---
And misses 3 times and dies
---
the reason it's off limits is, cause mc is easy asf and the faster you go through the better.
---
having a mb on a paladin does basically nothing in the current content while more damage = faster clears
---
This video should explain it better than I can:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YBIivTJEdQ
---
Hard to believe they never updated it. Especially considering how the inferior Red Dragonscale Protector looks.
---
Gw2 came to mind while reading his post
---
Try it out op
---
Both are easily replaceable, and it basically is going to come down to what you have at the moment you complete the quest.  I'm assuming you don't have the carapace spine crossbow or barberous blade yet.  Just keep farming those and whichever you don't get by December 10, choose the reward accordingly.
---
Takes three times as long for alliance.
---
Yeah, you have no idea.  Just shut up and enjoy a playable game.  
---
I was helping a rogue and warrior friend with hoj/arena runs last night.  The rogue and I got killed a few times getting in to BRM.  The warrior took an hour to get in.  Time yourself getting to brm and kindly never Bitch about a couple ganks again.
---
I have 300 FA, but every between-mob cannibalize that replaced a bandage or food saved me a bit of money. It adds up.
---
What kind of switches do you have? I'd hate to be sitting around you with some really clacky switches haha.
---
DME jump runs, Winterspring, and Eastern Plaguelands for the crystals/thorium. Not worth leveling enchanting just for that, as it's expensive and you can buy the transmute off someone else. There are guides for specific routes if you look it up, it's quite a grind no matter what.
---
Let me guess, horde rogue on Skeram?
---
&gt; Isn't it usually shaman warrior to abuse windfury?
---
If you've got one, it might be more effective. I'm not horde, so I work with what I've got.
---
&gt;you can pick up lasher packs if you bring a mage
---
You can pick them up with a priest in 2-man, the only requirement is that you bring a set of int gear so you can reach 6K mana, which is enough to aoe them down.
---
I was able to get the accounts back but when I did they had been banned for a major macro exploit so I assume someone used my account to bot on
---
Please please please everyone start selling the frostmaul giant ekos. 
---
I hate farming those. I will pay you every week reeEEE
---
I've been getting a powerlevel recently in SM Arms. Some things to note:
---
Average level of group matters. If you are a 60 running a 15 through Deadmines, your average level is very high so there is a severe experience penalty. However, if you are a 60 running *four* 15s through Deadmines, the average level is much lower and so your experience penalty is lessened. Find others to carry with.
---
Yuck.
---
Will of the forsaken, war stomp and blood fury are apparently so bad they aren't even worth mentioning.
---
Hunters, paladins, priests, all solo at level elites. 
---
Mages can only do that if they spend 80% of the time running and there's a massive area for them to run around in. If anything warriors should be better than mages at soloing at level elites.
---
&gt;ignoring the fact that most servers are horde dominated
---
&gt; not competing for any gear. 
---
... as a warrior? Oh boy.
---
Of course they don't.  They need to be forced.  Faction q.
---
Which ledge resets the aggro? We normally clear the 3 lashers group so we have more place to manoeuver
---
Look up the many many videos of DME solo runs to see the kiting for the last boss jumping between the ledge and the rock.  No need to tank him at all, ever.  With the dispel for the poison it should be really easy for you two.  
---
The only thing you should need to get down is timing for the person who is not kiting to go to the cave opening before the imps spawn to kill them before they agro all the trash (which you do not need to kill since Satyr's wont agro plants).  If they get out of the cave and hit the floor, the plants are coming for you.
---
Just like a frozen mob will attack you if you’re close enough, if tank gets knocked back, stationary raid will switch to the highest threat close enough to hit.
---
Domo and Ony the trick is to hellfire. Kinda silly but there ya go
---
Blizzard support has always been trash.
---
Do you use Healbot or similar? You need to use custom raidframes to heall efficiently because the game interface is useless for healing.
---
https://youtu.be/Q6VzJXIIjFI
---
Depending how open world content looks after battlegrounds are released I am considering unsubbing, as are several of my guild mates.  
---
I don't think Blizzard fully grasps that the huge swell in subs from Classic was because people wanted a vanilla experience, if they botch that all those people that didn't want to play retail aren't suddenly gonna be like well time to get my personal loot on and cool this necklacs needs XP and requires constant grinding.
---
how do i make my battleshout last 3 mins instead of 2?
---
Yes, but that would mean a boss who drops 2 items at max should have a total sum of 200%, but they do not.
---
They add up to 400% or something around that.
---
Thanks for the advice. As for the lashers group, we usually clear them before we try to kill the boss
---
Literally never run it from my PC so pretty unlikely
---
Dwarven Hand Cannon for dwarves is solid and not that expensive on most servers
---
warlock is imo easily the strongest solo elite class and it's not even close.
---
you can fear for infinity and lifetap/drain life for infinite resources while having one of the best defensive cooldowns.
---
i soloed borelgore who has like 50k hp and 3 shots you while i saw 5 man groups struggle to take him down.
---
It's the circle of life.
---
I like how he is now completely ignoring this thread.
---
Just because it didn’t happen in vanilla (due to server pop reasons and general naivety of how the honor system works) doesn’t make it griefing. 
---
Griefing is solely enjoyment from other player’s bad experiences. If you are rushing high warlord, there *is no other way to compete* then by camping high traffic zones and dominating. 
---
It is simply game theory. If you don’t engage in these tactics, you will be passed by someone else who is. 
---
Blizzard should have released WSG with phase 2 to mitigate this. End of story.
---
All of these pre-bis guides put shadow wrath and Felcloth gear as the best, and my loot council seems to follow this idea. It makes sense to me on the one hand, but on the other hand I consistently run out of mana during certain fights and have to life tap a ton. Is the added Intellect or Stamina on Felheart not worth losing a bit of spell damage to avoid the GCD usage and the drain on the healers?
---
Not sure his argument, but hit % is vital because if you miss a maul you’re boned
---
nope
---
Does the TOS wording limit it to account sharing between self aware entities?
---
As alliance on stalagg, this is the only realistic way to level..
---
Nah, streamers get the version where they tag elites and have a raid kill it.
---
pvp trinket fucks this up tho
---
Hit is just as important as anything. I say to take the beat of both worlds and work in as much hit as you feel comfortable. I feel like maul misses 90% of the time any damn way you go anyway.
---
Bummer. The one hour corpse run to BRD really wears you down. I didn’t know it would be this bad or I would’ve never elected for a pvp server but my friends had already rolled chars here.
---
....because they drop multiple items.
---
Exactly, I am on Incendius which is pretty fairly balanced and it's the same shit just sometimes Alliance happens to have the 40-man death blob griefing horde.  Doesn't solve the massive gameplay issues caused by this behavior just because sometimes you get to be the hammer instead of the nail.
---
How do you prevent the imps spawn from bringing in the other packs? I saw a video that said it was LoS from the boss, but we put him directly behind a pillar with no LoS and we still got 2/3 of the lasher packs. Do we just need to aggro the imps before they are within aggro range of their Lasher friends?
---
SS only creates more threat than revenge if it crits. Revenge baseline is higher than SS. HS deals more threat if it crits as well.
---
I’m not a fan of sundering with 5 stacks and find myself using HS more during rage dumps. I think the points into HS would be more valuable.
---
Shadow priest just has enough sustained damage and the ability to nullify ice barrier that the mage just doesn’t have enough damage without luck.
---
You have an example of this?
---
Haha there you go.
---
&gt;both rp realms (EU)
---
Look at it this way. The more you miss, the less threat you generate. 
---
The less threat you gen the most you lose control of the boss. 
---
I honestly, and thsi is as a raid bear tank, used Unforgiven mask ( 2 hit. ) devilsaur set. ( 2 hit. ) and the bracers that had hit from UBRS ( 1 hit. ) 
---
Its not 9%, but 5% is better than no %. 
---
The rest of my slots are mitigation. mark of tyranny/smoknig heart combo. Ataeli shoulders of monkey from ST. etc. I sit about 68-70% DR in bear with 5% hit. So far, its worked fine in MC.
---
Core Hound Tooth
---
I've leveled from 52 when Phase 2 hit to 57, mostly through quests.  I'll be hitting EPL tonight and this weekend once I clear the dungeon quests out of my log.  So yeah, I'm in world, giving as good as I get.
---
Actually an engineering office, but what difference does it make. The statement is still accurate.
---
I didn't say it wasn't possible, I'm saying that's what a lot of players do, or they choose to leave, or corpse run, or whatever. I'd counter that pvp incentives catalysed the overpopulated servers into a level of chaos the vanilla world was never meant for. I don't really care to be honest, I'm just happy to be playing the game. But the biggest difference between now and vanilla is the server cap, followed closely by people not being quite as noob.
---
Depends on the piece, boots, probably. Maaaaybe bracers. Those are the two that come to mind. Worth the consideration that tapping scales with sp. Unless you're doing 30sec kills your gonna tap anyway so you will still get benefit there
---
Too far

I just solo farm dungeons for gold. Scholo for example drops tons of runecloth/lockboxes/boes/recipes/runes. You don't even have to kill any bosses either. Just clear the trash, and then go back and clear respawns over, and over. With a group of 5 you'll go way faster than I have to soloing it.
---
I expect less people from alliance side to be interested in BGs than from horde side. We will see of course, that's just my impression.
---
Thankss
---
It is only because you can get away with having 5% hit on a dwarf. Having used both I liked the crossbow better.
---
What do you mean? Shit like this happened all through vanilla.     Usually they just give out a free month sub or something say sorry fix it and move on
---
Get some addon to see other incoming heals to not overheal. Spam Flash Heal. Use a larger and a smaller rank depending on the situation.
---
But sometimes you just wont get to heal a lot even if you play perfectly.
---
What if I enjoy doing it? Let people play as they wish lmao
---
I guess what I mean is the profit margins don't feel meaningful when it's on a pot selling for 80s. But making the right variety of pots in bulk can net large gains.
---
Crit always if you have imp shadowbolt. That debuff needs to be up at all times if your tank doesn't have threat issues
---
That’s an exploit and will get you banned. There was a post about it the other day. Plus it’s just shitty so don’t do it
---
Probably because I tend to get constantly marginalized .
---
Quest giver despawns for a period of time after every failed attempt.
---
Playing the game "efficiently* is called being unemployed and having no friends.  Time invested is what leads to success, don't pretend to be on another level just because all you do is play WoW.
---
Part of my logic in saying they screwed up winning the lottery is that they released phase II ahead of the classic timeline and now they are having to accelerate BG’s to hopefully lessen the impact of that first bad decision. To some degree I sympathize with them because it’s kind of like pushing jello up a hill. It’s impossible to stay ahead and satisfy everyone. I can only comment on my personal experience trying to level.
---
I think we can all agree: WSG being released with p2 would have mitigated the vast majority of this. 
---
Simply because it would become the most efficient honor farm, thus reducing incentive to camp high traffic world zones.
---
It's only on what I'm now calling "over populated" servers. Lol. Coming from what you'd call a *dead* server though we were the second last set to come off layering. Feel I'm one of the few lucky ones. Blessed be elune.
---
&gt; 10k+ players playing simultaneously 
---
I wonder where have you taken this data. Is it just your subjective impression or you have a source?
---
Clearing rag since week 2? Lol calm down
---
This happened to me the first week but then they showed up again after a couple of days - don’t know if it’s the same bug or whatnot. Guess we’ll see if the blue fellas wake up
---
Fury tank is literally best for dungeon. Theres no need for stance dance. HS everything and its fine.
---
Offensive casters are typically after Banthok Sash and/or Ring from Arena  
---
Physical DPS are after HOJ from Anger
---
5% with surefooted's 3% = 8% + 5 Guns skill which wouldnt make them miss 63 mobs? Isnt 1 skill point 0.04 hit and crit chance?
---
Force heal my life taps or I’ll die.
---
Mages have one role, DPS and our tier isn't good for it... Oh may not like resto but your tier is excellent for resto at least.
---
You overlooked the most important alliance pvp racial: 
---
Paladins.
---
I know. Now up to 700 runs since I started dualboxing, and still no chestpiece.
---
I rerolled on Mirage Raceway PvE as alliance and people are super chill and friendly
---
Because you excluded them? Why else.
---
You should only really use the max rank rejuv anyway.
---
/petattack
---
This sounds plausible.. Not calling BS on it! Wish we had a counter of how many QQ posts are made each day.
---
This is a pic of a guy getting paid minimum just doing his job, and some kid or middle aged dude who acts like a kid being a whiny little bitch.
---
They still can, addons can talk with each other.
---
I rerolled on Mirage Raceway from and ubalanced PvP server and its been amazing.
---
If you extend this logic over 14 item slots it stops being 100hp. 
---
Not saying take 1 Stam 1 Intel over 30 spellpower for example, but there is certainly an argument to be made for taking the stats in this case.
---
Always and forever!
---
I haven't played Classic yet, but I'm thinking of starting by rolling a Hunter. However I heard the class has many bugs. Is this still true or have the bugs been fixed?
---
Is SM easy to get to on high pop bad balance PvP servers?  My preconception is not.
---
6% not 5
---
Gah I made a last second edit, "at level dungeons" like ZF GY farming. 
---
&gt; guess as a warrior, you will just have to live with your instant group finding and insane gear scaling, then wipe your tears with the wide variety of incredible endgame weapons you get.
---
Either yer a premier hybrid dps that spends longer than any other dps LFG. So wtf are you talking about instant groups.
---
Or yer a tank that is just like every other warrior, collecting dps gear for raids because only two tanks get set gear.
---
Congrats @14phbitch. 
---
Feels great when you finally get it eh :D
---
I did it back in vanilla with my priest. He’s still hated by all the goblins.
---
I’m really tempted to do it again in classic!
---
Jokes on you, my mage is only lvl 24 and is in Hillsbrad with rez sickness
---
No we tested it out 5% flat widout surefooted 2 Dwarf Hunters on 3 diffrent night we both had 0% miss on the whole raid.
---
Not sure if it is a bug but it might be the same with Trolls and bows. Can't test that out unfortunatly.
---
Hahahahahhah that’s a whole new level of insecurity
---
LMAO
---
No, people are definitely camping graveyards. Graveyards and flight points both. Honor? No. But you're dead anyways. 
---
I think if you're intentionally spawn camping people for reasons that are not honor for an extended length of time, it should be considered griefing. Same if exploits are involved. I mean, sure, safespotting in Gadgetzan \*shouldnt\* be done, but in practice, it's nearly constant.
---
No worries! I play priest to make people hate how much they depend on me.
---
Yer set gear is at least the correct spec. As druid duder points out, hybrid classes get fuckered pretty hard by teir gear.
---
Warlock really struggles with hit and doesn't become relevant until AQ and Naxx on the DPS meters.  ZG helps a ton as well with bloodvine, CoC, and the rings.
---
There's 0 proof he stream sniped on twitch.
---
how much would they sell for each and what would the drop chance look like?
---
Wow classic endgame is extremely grindy for everything: dungeons for preraid bis gear, raids for raid gear, more dungeons or open world for gold for raid consumables and don't even get me started at pvp ranks. If you find grind boring, I am afraid wow classic endgame isn't for you. Still, a certain and solid part of wow classic experience is leveling and I hope you had fun doing that.
---
Since you are subbed anyway, I seriously suggest you trying retail wow: it is definitely less grindy and more entertaining + rewarding with way less effort applied. Most people on this sub find it a bad thing (this is why we wanted classic) but you might find your fun.
---
50/50
---
Ya competition with rogues and other warriors must be tough, whew.
---
I imagine MC must be tough too, having to roll against like 2 other tanks, oh my, good thing mages only have to roll against 10 other mages and potentially like 25 different casters.
---
These guards are clearly coming to gratz you, don't move.
---
I play a prot warrior level 59.  Ive been running brd since level 50 and after a while you hate it so much you think about rerolling
---
Roll need on gear you already own to save money on repairs.
---
This isn’t a leveling guide. This is just a list of dungeons and the acceptable levels you can run them.
---
Teeth on the other hand will
---
50/50 what? be permabanned or nothing?
---
i just started pvp on my mage alt this week, my lifetime HKs are showing the HK's missing from the 'this week'  section, so they are tracking those. the only valid fix would be to give everyone full honor for every one of those missing HKs.
---
You made it right. That chest piece has no place on a warrior anyways imo.
---
It’s like a rogue getting salty that he lost Druid gear.
---
Wow that sucks. That is the only item that drops when I do arena on my rogue. I've seen the sash drop 3 times in a row.
---
dw will still be better for raiding
---
Ahahaha. Hahaha. 
---
Have you checked the dps pre-bis and bis lists for dps warriors?
---
It's literally half leather, half mail.
---
Warlocks level way faster than paladins. I mean, it still takes a while because Classic, but overall paladins tend to be one of the slowest leveling classes and locks one of the fastest.
---
&gt; there is also the fact that the dungeon weapons for heals are so much better than the dd ones.
---
Yeah uhhh not for pallys.. Hammer of Grace just has +31 healing which is very good but MageBlade offer +9 more healing and 1% crit AND 12 int which translates to more mana and crit. 
---
Bottom line is mageblade is just way better for holy pallys
---
Not just base AP. Base MELEE AP. Might as well be blank for orc hunters, warlocks, and non-enh shamans. Also self-mortal strike so you basically die if you activate it in melee range.
---
Now I know what am I gonna watch (funny how one has to go for movies older than himself to avoid the mandatory racial and cultural diversification of actors).
---
\*gasp* I thought it was a bronze or metal cast!
---
Now we just need someone to upload a model and you can 3D print and paint your own.
---
okay, and how do you know this?
---
When I get killed on tp and revive I'll still have the debuff, and the moment you attack it will refresh. I get killed twice when I land in searing, both times I give no honor to the 10 ppl ganking me. Best way is cc, or just stop being an idiot and kill players somewhere else.
---
No, its not.. you die a ton on the way.
---
Me healbot shows incoming heals for all my ranks of flash heal, heal, etc. But I did notice that my lower rank renews don't show the incoming heal.
---
Are only your hots affected by this?
---
Lol, am on a pve server so its ok. Had forgotten about menethil harbor so jaunted up and boated over to Theramore and ran up the coast, glad I got that outa my system.
---
I work for a company that is based in India. We have this same issue with ALL of the Indian tech support. Always half assed and always too lazy to do their job. Irritating as hell.
---
Warrior tier 1 and 2 are largely trash too, tbf.
---
Fuck doing the whole instance.. The troggs are great xp though, grind that area.
---
well thats not on out server... he would be dead already...  Dont think ill ever see him alive lol
---
Also on Incendius, horde are 60/40 there, I suppose there wouldn't be an issue when you have numerical superiority in virtually every engagement and all you need to do is show up for free honour.
---
Granted when alliance actually form we can get about 10-15 minutes of actual engaging PvP before horde can call reinforcements.  Literally had a 28-man raid come to break up our 5-man group that was roaming in EPL the other day.
---
The problem is blizzard ties incentives to this kind of toxic behavior.  I don't blame horde for taking advantage of the situation, but it certainly doesn't make the game more playable for alliance when blizzard rewards this kind of shithead nolife gameplay.
---
But there is no such thing as #nochanges, the game is already vastly different than it was originally, it makes no sense at all to use it. There's also nothing drastic being mentioned. BG's early is a good step, but it's going to depend on how they pair servers. It's still not going to address the gross imbalance on many servers. For instance on a heavily horde favored server, it would be expected that alliance are going to benefit from the shorter que times. Everyone seems to think that enough of the horde will be queing BG's but never do I see anyone consider the opposite faction. With the que times that should be expected for each faction, what percent of each faction do you think will be in que's? It should be common sense that the faction with the shortest que times will have the largest fraction of it's playerbase doing BG's. While the other faction will have some fraction discouraged and stick to WPVP instead of BG's. That can only and will make the imbalance worse, not better.
---
Deadmines till the harder redridge quests then stocks
---
The final stretch from the wooden retaining wall to the instance portal is the worst of it by far; even in P1, the interior area frequently had 60+ people afk in it.
---
I made a long post about this already here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dir5uo/do\_you\_think\_todays\_classic\_guilds\_can\_kill\_the/f3z9s9g?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dir5uo/do_you_think_todays_classic_guilds_can_kill_the/f3z9s9g?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) 
---
As someone who was at the top back then, and played on the last pserver, I'm not so sure the original C'Thun would be killable with current knowledge. The fight wasn't hard so much as it was broken. Tentacles would spawn inside walls making them untankable. Eyes would spawn inside walls lasering people regardless of their positioning. Sometimes the portal would oneshot anyone who got ported. Deaths were unavoidable so the fight essentially had a RNG timer and we were not even close to making it back then. We were so far off, even after months of attempts, that I don't even think tripling our raids DPS would have gotten us there. But, a lot of this is just my memory so I could be wrong or maybe all it would take is some good RNG based on wall spawns and who died to the portal.
---
It’s because all the green gear is a meme scam and people fall for it. Basically all the BiS guides ignore realities of raiding (that sometimes people suck or have bad luck or take unanticipated damage) and people suffer for it. The ideal set up is like a healthy mix of raid and dungeon drops to ensure a high base level of combat efficiency while also ensuring survivability. Also, purples are good because when you look good you play good baybee.
---
TBH if they catch you, you’ll probably get the gold removed as well as any items you got with the gold removed and a temporary ban. 
---
If I was blizzard I’d just delete all your characters and make you start from scratch.
---
Yea, paladin is better. Its still easily doable on Priest though. If you're worried about the price of the restorative potion, you can also get a few of Jungle Remedy,  its free.
---
For MC that absolutely makes sense. In my guild it's open to casters and paladins. We are gearing for BWL at this point and Mageblade is hands-down the most powerful thing for paladins until Nef, while casters also have an option in Staff of Dominance.
---
You quoted him but also didn’t even read what he said? Lmao
---
Tbf I cleared MC tons of times by now and haven't even seen hoj once in my BRD runs yet. I do have Dal'Rends and basically everything else because it was more efficient. You don't really need all the perfect stuff.
---
T2 and t2 are both fine for resto

---
Moral arbiter? Virtue signaling?
---
Do you think you might be projecting just a little bit
---
Are you horde or alliance?
---
If Alliance, I think Ironfoe and BB is going to be better. If Horde, being able to spam Hamstring to proc Windfury would put BRE over?
---
How many Emp kills did it take for you to get Ironfoe, I need to know so I can become filled with jealous rage.
---
Don’t forget the npc also gives a quest.
---
this is what I thought would be the extent of it, I just have been looking around on the internet and have not seen someone actually tell a story where they have been caught in classic
---
That’s pretty much what I was saying so again what?
---
*happyreckbombernoises*
---
No. I don't use consumables in dungeons. They aren't needed and are better saved for raids.
---
I am confident you could run WoW on a Gateway computer with a Pentium II @ 1.3GHz plugged into an old CRT monitor. The reason it was so successful is exactly because of that: it could run on *anything*.
---
I play on a Dell laptop with a fifth gen i5 (which is pretty old), 8 gigs of RAM, and onboard graphics. Game runs at a solid 45FPS and looks great.
---
Woah woah woah. Not all of us 10v1.
---
Personally, I 5v1.
---
Charge costs rage, you get your rage from the furor talent to start the pull.
---
You could always pretend that classic was built perfectly the first time around and that retail is an utter trainwreck at every level with no redeeming qualities. 
---
Ye know, be completely delusional.
---
Yeah ive been using stormrager the pvp wand and havent had the motivation to farm for skul or spam scholo
---
I was looking for my character once in Armory and there was another character with the same name on a different server who's guild had that picture.
---
The guild name was &lt;I HAVE CANDY GET IN VAN&gt;
---
Use dark runes/demonic tunes and major mana pots. I only have to tap on a couple fights (rag and golemagg). I still use green shadow wrath shoulders, green unicorn ring, and felcloth gloves
---
WoR wipes threat of all raid, no exceptions.
---
hope we are never forced to tbc classic. Expansions were worst thing that happend to wow
---
Git rekt
---
?
---
It's 2019, you'd think people would be rid of this stupid assumption already.
---
Uldaman takes less than an hour with a decent group, and Gnomer is around the same. Both have very few pulls in them leading to it being a fast dungeon to do with a decent group. 
---
Any dungeon starts taking forever if the tank doesn't know where to go, starts pulling extra shit he doesn't need to, or if you wipe. Stop making it seem like Ulda and Gnomer are the only ones that have this issue.
---
As for ST, well it literally requires you to clear one entire floor and that DOES take forever, but it's also tons of XP. You're not required to clear the floor for the extra boss though, 1/3rd of the mobs gone right there.
---
That’s why I said you want straight spell power, not “stack fire power instead and ignore stats”
---
I said stat gear with some spell power
---
Sorry, I couldn't hear you over the sounds of me shouting "GOGOGOGOGO"
---
Not every warrior tanks in raids..
---
This is why I have a 60 prot warrior and am leveling a mage that’s currently 55.
---
Warrior druid possible?
---
/cry
---
I prefer a mage taking time to put an ice barrier up.  Gives me more time to heal.  Every GCD you use defensively, is giving me the win.  Against a Disc or Holy priest, you are fighting a mana war.  If you go OOM before I do, you lose.  So by all means, keep throwing up those expensive ice barriers that I can dispel for less or just ignore as you give me time to heal.
---
Because spaming blizzard in same instances over and over and over is so much fun right?  
---
I never played a warrior before, the whole stance dancing thing was scaring me. But after trying to roll an alt warlock for the first time ever and being extremely bored by level 10 I decided to try warrior. Damn its like I am experiencing vanilla all over again. I am 30 already and having a blast so far.  The whole warrior fantasy, using a big slow weapon, bunch of class quests. So much fun
---
And leveling warrior is not nearly half as bad as people make it out to be. Bought couple of early game weapons off ah, didnt spend more then couple of gold. Going to get the ww axe soon. Rolled herbalism/alchemy, which is extremely useful. Going to different zones to make sure all my quests are green/yellow. Follow these rules and you ll be fine.
---
Interesting. Well that could also be the case with Stoneshatter hence +4 skill in crossbow. Its not +5 but still
---
What am I missing then my dude
---
I literally said you want stats, with general spell damage on the side. The spell damage will increase your rain of fire damage slightly, whereas having pure +shadow damage gear will do nothing but get you killed for lack of stats.
---
I mentioned rain of fire because that’s what you use to kill the packs of lashers.
---
I don't know what your experience in pvp has been, but mine has been much different. Most engagements are won/lost within 30 seconds. 
---
My spell rotation looks like this usually. BOSAC, BOF, BOP, Divine Shield, Holy Light/dispel for the duration of the bubble, then do my best to cast heals without getting interrupted. 
---
If I'm trying to stay alive vs a melee train. I use bof, hoj, holy shock, health pot, and try to get space while my team tries to cc/kill.
---
PvP in classic is messy and dirty.
---
Talent called Booming Voice on the fury tree. If u put 5 points on it it expands battleshout to 3 minutes instead of 2min duration
---
Even as a 60 running through searing gorge is a death crawl
---
Letting people stay in Classic is as obvious to me as them releasing BC. They would never put the work in for Classic only to wipe the slate clean. 
---
How they handle server merges to keep realms alive is a different story, I can’t wait to see how they’d handle that.
---
It’s been out for 2 years + 4 months for classic. Any time beyond that is either
---
A) on a private server which isn’t tuned correctly or,
---
B) irrelevant with BC/wrath/cata/MoP/legion/BFA talents and scaling 
---
The bozos who keep saying it’s been out for 15 years are dumb Cheeto huffers that can’t empathize with people who are just starting the game or play it very casually.
---
Just enjoy the hammer
---
Additionally, booty bay gazette is great if you like to compare server specific prices to “the big picture” - this is particularly useful for illustrating what markets are already cornered or “fixed”
---
this is literally the central limit theorem...
---
I can agree with Uldaman, and ST to an extent but Gnomer is a nightmare. Sure maybe I could learn the pulls a little better, but those tram ways have a ton of trash and none of it gives the xp that it should for how long they take, especially those nullifiers
---
I never heard arms mentioned for tanking on lvl 60 once on this sub before this week
---
&gt; not looking for the "you will be permabanned!" 
---
That is probably the outcome.  If you are needing people to ease your mind or tell you you'll get a slap on the wrist, that is fine, but its not a reflection of what will happen.
---
So whoever cheats the least (getting a head start) and doesn't get caught is gonna win
---
Just done Uldaman. Level 44 rogue. Should I go back to STV and do the green/yellow quests there, or move on to Hinterlands/Tanaris/somewhere else?
---
Finally focussing on just levelling cos I REALLY wanna hit 60 so I want a steady flow of doable quests.
---
UNDERRATED COMMENT
---
Pretty shitty take but ok
---
oof.
---
I’ve never bought gold in WoW. Looted and scooted in TBC but that’s not a TOS violation. So I’m assuming that would happen. They might go overboard though. Depends on the GM and how blizzard is wanting it to play out.
---
If, and when, they drop TBC is when I stop subscribing
---
Well, it's also plate. You're Rogue/Druid fodder if you wear cloth and leather in PvP.
---
I'd pay Blizzard money to leave a hellscape like that.
---
That looks so horrible tbh. Spending all your time just grinding those few instances over and over. No wonder people burn out so quickly.
---
No it isn't you hopeless nihilist.
---
It's late stage capitalism.
---
bUt HoRde Has It toO.....
---
With a weapon speed at 3.0 and slower, you let auto attacks finish before using aimed shot.
---
Faster weapons, you immediately use aimed shot when it comes up.
---
And then they quit because they're where they don't want to be. Andddd it's a revolving door.
---
that's when you form your own group, fill them with caster DPS , and tank them yourself.
---
Remember anyone named soniichu?
---
Yes it does exist*
---
and it ends with the downvotes you get :)
---
Truth
---
Yeah its only my hot spells that are affected by this. I also noticed that when using a macro on healbot, the healbot tooltip does not display the mana cost, which would be nice...
---
Saying solid behind 45 FPS won't make it any good.
---
Damn that's awesome. I always fantasize about saving my light of elune for something like that
---
well hes level 53 so obviously not going to ony... but you know you could get ported to Darn and fly from there or pay a lock to summon you to Ony and yes I am a horde lock on a 55:45 server woopdeedoo. I was just pointing out the fact that OP's friend is fucking dumb for doing the same thing over and over again expecting different results. I'm not a fan of the state of pvp atm by any means but people need to adapt. my grp took 30 mins getting into DM whereas it took me 5 mins cause im not a dipshit and can actually use my head to solve problems rather than bashing my head against the wall while i corpse run 15 times.
---
Unsub from the game and list your reason as "Justice for Hong Kong."
---
🦀 🦀 $14.99 🦀🦀
---
Do we have any evidence that those are as syrongly inbalancef to the alliance side?
---
Really? I know that’s how it worked in vanilla but I just joined a different pug after being locked to a separate group a few weeks ago.
---
you know when you turn something on and nothing happens? same thing here
---
Every mage DPS
---
&gt; I even get whispered by people asking me to join them as a tank which made me feel great and valued as a member of my server. 
---
As a lvl 60 rogue... first time I got asked to join a group was yesterday on my level 15 warrior...
---
CAT NOT FOR SALE!
---
Classic takes your life yes, that is the problem with it. I have played some half days classic for what? 1 level?
---
I don’t understand why it’s extremely disgruntling tbh.
---
don't be stupid they will obviously leave the calssic realms available, it would be an option to copy to TBC classic
---
Okay fair, just looking for evidence or a real story where someone has experienced it
---
I thought that too but everyone else I had seen was alliance. This guy is horde. That's why it's tagged as humor
---
Temporary ban is worse than starting from scratch.  It gives you the agonizing choice of giving up the game verse starting a new character on a new account.  And that won't be as leveled when you are unbanned, making the moment when your other account unbans a Sophie's Choice if you can only support one sub a month.  Deleting characters or the account to start fresh is not as hard on the player, as it removes all attachment from the old account, it's just gone.  A ban means all those rares, all that time and gear is just waiting for you.  Tempting you.
---
Hope is something that people really underestimate how painful it can be to have.  Knowing you can get something back after a period of time makes it that much worse than losing it outright and starting over.
---
i like gnome, but i also know the place quite well from my druid. honestly, its great xp with all the quests, but i understand how one black sheep ruins the run for the group and the ghost runs can be really annoying.
---
How tf am I suppose to pug BRD at level 50???
---
Yeah explain
---
Orc and Undead racials are better than both of those.  Go look at top logs and tell me with a straight face that Alliance is the higher DPS faction.
---
The numbers of items the boss drops is random, then each item (non-duplicates) is probably randomly selected after that
---
Okay Beefybits.
---
57-60: Regular Strat runs become much faster xp than BRD aoe groups.
---
What do you mean you need fire damage for DM east??
---
So you want to balance it. If you purely raid and you never take damage in those raids you'll want to use the best in slot guide and just maximize your damage. However I like to do things besides raid like farm for essences and I know I like the stamina and intellect on the gear like even dreadmist. Staying alive and having health and Mana is way more noticeable than slightly more damage
---
Your chain lighting that just hit for nothing and he Purge will cost you more but sure
---
That WF rag kill was very early into Vanilla. Players improved over the years and we did eventually get presub rag kills. We even 5 manned Loatheb back then: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raaLqFelbCk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raaLqFelbCk)
---
To be fair it's worth playing for a month or two.
---
It does not. You get the [Black Qiraji Battle Tank] but your title will continue to display your PvP rank. Alternate titles were not added until Burning Crusade.
---
His world is trying to make people feel bad online. Sad really.
---
Nice gl
---
Spell damage scales terribly for AoE spells and wtf are you using rain or fire for in DM east?
---
Oh, absolutely.
---
360 runs?
---
That's such a gross over exaggeration.
---
From someone who works CS by e-mail/chat, just like Blizzard provides, I think these are 2-3 preset responses, and one was edited;  
---
First 4 lines is one reply, mostly likely directly copy pasted from a previous ticket about the same issue, hence the same name (if they used the system they have instead of copy pasting it would've changed to the correct name automatically);

The 5th line seems like a system generated line that was added to, hence the error in "our", or it was completely typed out by the rep. My guess is he added the last sentence himself;  
---
And then 6-8 is a standard system generated end of reply response;
---
Just my 2 cents
---
How else am I supposed to kill gnomes as alliance?
---
To me spell hit items feel redundant for warlock atm. You can't get capped right now so it's effectively just RNG (albeit a bit more RNG if you got 0% hit).
---
I used felheart robes and star of mystaria for a while but I replaced them with anastari and robe of volatile power and my logs have gotten way better. According to BiS lists you'll be replacing star with choker of the firelord and your belt with sash of whispered secrets so spell hit seems secondary until bloodvine set.
---
You don’t need fire damage explicitly. You need intellect and stamina first, and then basic spell damage, which will slightly increase your RoF damage for the lashers.
---
Nothing comparable currently exists in the game.
---
I'd suggest fishing.  Either just grab a secluded spot or one near a friendly town in a high level area and just go nuts.  The best money makers are consumable resources.  Equipment takes time to replace.  A raider might go through a stack of buff food in a single 3 hour raid night.  That is a constant and won't change, unlike farming for essences or felcloth.  As we gear up, current open world farming mats will fall off.  Felcloth/Mooncloth goes out of style when the gear it makes is garbage compared to raid drops.  Essences get replaced with raid drops or new zone drops.  Or change based on the tier of content.  And once we hit progression content, as in, people aren't regularly clearing the zone in 2 hours, demand for consumables will go up, significantly.
---
Im talking about racials not classes.
---
Why repair that Ironfoe when you can just throw it away and get a new one?
---
im alliance yes. so i shouldnt raid with BRE over DW? Just BRE for pvp?
---
I don't think there's a lot of demand for a Classic that isn't retail or Classic, but I could be wrong.
---
True, however you really should not be sitting on Bloodrobes for that long. Int does nothing for you until raiding. 10 stam is negligible, it’s not even a good item for its level if you’re drain tanking. If you don’t like shadoweave then get dreamweave but don’t waste that item slot for 100 hp.
---
This is not correct. The threat wipe happens no matter what, and is global. It doesn't matter if you're in range, out of range, resist the knockback, or on the moon, your threat gets reset.
---
Everybody's threat gets reset to 0, so if the melee are moving out (old strat), then the threat wipe is never an issue because the tank has a lead over the melee by already being in range.
---
How original
---
Healbot rock in pvp tho
---
For Horde, Shaman-Warrior is the go-to. Stoneskin totem + Ele/Resto shaman means imps on the final boss being no issue whatsoever.
---
It still requires decent gear, and you need the warrior to deal decent damage, but I've been running jumpruns wiith the Ele/Resto in my guild as Fury/Prot for a good amount of money.
---
This is what a significant majority of my (and many friends and guild members) interactions with Blizzard Customer Service will be like. 
---
I have played Blizzard games since Warcraft I, and to that end l, I have filed dozens of tickets over the years for various issues including character, billing, game, installation, and store issues, and every single response is exactly this caliber or worse. This is not a new issue.
---
It is also Blizzard policy to close and resolve your inquiries without answering if you follow up for issues they have already marked as answered. Basically, they can tell you to fuck off, they don’t care, and can’t or won’t be bothered to fix it.
---
Granted, there are people who will say they get the friendly, helpful Customer Service rep from time to time, but in my experience they have never proven to be more helpful than a FAQ page that was translated poorly from a foreign language.
---
I don't know either, that's why I'm inetrested in your opinion ! 
---
Imo it would actually feel much more like vanilla than Classic ! :)
---
Pull with void walker, use suffering. This should allow you 3 ticks of rain of fire without taking aggro. Sac the voidwalker, continue RoF until they die.
---
Don’t stack shadow damage gear without stats, or you’ll die.
---
Reading comprehension is difficult I guess.
---
I always thought Blizzard customer service was great. I haven't used it in so long though. Not since like... MoP. But up until then in my experience they were very helpful and friendly and did all they could to resolve issues I had.
---
 can you see herbs when dead?
---
The main point? He was comparing dungeon healing weapons to dungeon damage weapons. He is correct in saying the healing weapons are stronger by a very large margin. Just look up the stats of the healing mace vs. Witch blade(caster wep pre-raid bis). He didn’t say anywhere that mageblade isn’t a big upgrade for paladins.
---
Nothing during BC and Wotlk iirc (the achievements came at the very last end of Wotlk), I can't be sure for Cata tho.
---
Im talking about racials not classes. jeezus.
---
Was this before WoW? Cause I don't ever remember quality in service.
---
Druids may only get resto tier but at least it is good for resto mages are only DPS and our tier isn't even good for dpsing.
---
Like I said it's not your fault.  Pretty much doing the raid log thing until BGs drop and if that isn't a near instant improvement seriously considering spending my $15/month on something else.
---
It just kinda sucks because it really feels like Blizzard wants Classic to fail.
---
A lot of response use templates and then get edited a bit based on the need, I highly doubt this response was sent to every single person, word for word.
---
You only need hit % chance for tanking in raids and even then mostly on just bosses. Any dungeon you really don’t need it, 2% would be fine if you really want to have some. 
---
I say go wolfhead helm. I use it for tanking in MC all the time and switch to mask of unforgiven on bosses (I have Warden Staff + Breastplate of the Beast + all the top items from any list) so my guy is decked out. I find Wolfhead Helm works best even for tanking, not just dps, if you want to be what I would call a “threat” tank. I run pure agi and stam on everything, agi for crit + defense and stam for raw hp. 
---
You can power shift in and out of bear and pull large packs of mobs, with WHH you never get rage starved. It’s a free 20 rage whenever you want. I’ll usually run through a dungeon and use my enrage off cool down, and just shift every time I pull a pack so I can get a double swipe right off the pull, then you get aggro and can use a demo roar since everything’s hitting you and giving you rage, then maul your primary target once, switch and just auto/maul the secondary. If the group respects your kill order you should have the pack locked in on you and you can really pick up the pace to clear the dungeon
---
For what it's worth, people telling you dots are a waste are kinda right but mostly wrong. There's a skill to identifying which mobs will live long enough / will be targeted last and dotting them. For some reason everyone's telling you to just single target, but multi target pulls are where you have a chance to pull away. Hellfire is also your friend if there's 4+ targets.
---
Don’t be daft, nothing is obvious you mook
---
Having played this long I basically have certain setups I like.  
---
 If I'm a troll I'm gonna be blue, bald, and with the biggest tusks you can manage.   
---
Tauren? Longhorn Cattle look.   
---
Undead? No jaw, black x on face, no eyes, bald  
---
Orc? Mohawk.   
---
Any alliance race? Uninstall
---
I actually saw a few of these passing through Crossroads 2 weeks ago lol.
---
You can't solo elites that can't be feared though. And you aren't tanky enough to solo elites that come in packs.
---
I doubt you could solo a flight master + the 2 gryphons it summons on a Warlock, but I can do it on my Druid easily.
---
Account banned in 3...2...1.
---
This already exists, just not enough of the realms.
---
Yes, I've done it. Dense dynamite and barov peasant caller is very useful though.
---
Yea i look at some these peoples estimates on this sub and im like how in the fuck do you even have the time to play that much and that shitty of luck lol.
---
Not many benefits for classic as of now. If its under the same battle.net account, any account-wide cosmetics, mounts, etc are shared(as it currently is on retail) . Benefit would be that you can powerlevel and dualbox,easier to farm. Downside is maintaining subscriptions for multiple accounts.
---
Dont forget it reduces the chance to glancing blow as well, which hit alone does not
---
+Skill isn't really that great for Hunters since Ranged Attacks can't have glancing blows.
---
Boooorrrriinngggg
---
How do you get the dragon around your picture frame?
---
WoW edgelords give me a headache. 
---
I find it hard to believe that you calling people stupid is a solid means of catharsis. Otherwise, why waste your time being rude?
---
Too bad the trinket is garbage. The mob is spawns has the intelligence of a cardboard box.
---
I grinded all my BRD pre-bis just as I hit 60 as a mage where Ambassador Flamelash dropped my optional pre-BIS trinket, having started at 52. 8 whole levels, I know the goddamned place like the back of my hand which to say is I kind of know it well but not that actually 100% lol.
---
I make money on alchemy, yet you blame server population and claim I have the straw-man arguments.
---
Get gud kiddo
---
By the point warriors have reached insane dps from scaling rogues should be switching over to SoF daggers anyway the crit scaling with that build is just plain dirty and insane.
---
And I’m saying blood fury is a bad racial and you’re purposefully being disingenuous to push a point. Alliance are fine in BGs, most pservers guilds roll alliance for a reason
---
Blizzard needs to do something. I'm Ally too and my server is just dwindling Ally side. (Whitemane). And we have massive queues to log in and get fucked
---
You have a 60 horde spriest on Herod. I don't think you've truly experienced the pain of spending 30-45 min just to get into DM. Or having all world farming spot being camped by horde death squads from 5pm-midnight every day. Or not being able to have world buffs for raids cause you'll just get wiped running in. I haven't been able to make it from the inn in gadget to the flightmaster since pvp came out. We have 5-6 rouges waiting in the mage district in IF at all hours waiting to gank mages coming in from pvp zones. You're not even safe in the auction house.
---
Which leaves ally to just chill in IF cause the game isn't fun to play right now. I can admit I don't know what the horde experience is like, but I can say that most of the endgame content is squashed by bored pvpers on a 65/35 split realm. I have played retail and private servers, and the complete lockdown is unique to classic.
---
He just Ron Swansoned you bud.
---
That's where you're wrong kiddo.
---
15 years of it
---
Progress is 2 mins faster than ONSLAUGHT with 2 less healers and 2 extra Fury Warriors.  Horde has the higher ceiling, Alliance guilds are just executing better at the moment.  Some Alliance Warriors are even removing Salv in MC to avoid clipping big buffs with buff cap.  It's not even necessary.
---
Eng and Invuln pots help SM Ruin a lot, if you're into that sort of thing.
---
Apparently Blackhands Breath + DM book trinket is better than Hoj for rogues. I have an alt rogue at mid fifties and recently ran into that piece of info.
---
Lol, no.
---
Blizzard contracts a company called Volt Services, located in Cedar Park, TX (a few blocks from where Asmon and Soda live) to do their GM services.
---
No matter what faction DW will always be strongest in pve. And yes you should use BRE only for pvp
---
Potentially lost 10 sweet sweet golds... I'll try higher next time to see what I can get
---
Not on your mini map.  When you're within ressing range of your body you might be able to physically see them on the ground though... maybe.
---
Oh damn, why such a huge difference?
---
Angerforge runs are soloable by rogues. Not sure about druids.
---
Yea that’s what I mean not on map but acc see them on the ground
---
Yeah I've never worked in this kind of customer service (technically what I do is customer service but as a tour guide so it's face to face) so I was just guessing
---
Alright so maybe I sold at the good price, I'll try higher next time
---
You can't use the find herbs ability for the minimap while dead. but I'm honestly not sure if you can just see herbs while you're dead walking around, I think you can?
---
There are two repeatable quests in Feralas that grant reputation with all goblin factions. After the first turn-ins, they drop to 25 rep per, so it would take quite some time.
---
Well, I think the flaws of Classic are what makes Classic, the shared suffering and a sense of nostalgia. A new game with flaws and pace like Classic is just a bad game in 2019.
---
Things like new bosses wouldn't really matter I think :) Classic bosses are notoriously super simple. The challenge is the time you spend doing next to nothing (get to dungeon, grind pots, doing trash, organize 30-40 people, dpsing for 10 minutes without snoozing, spending weeks without good loot). That makes for good friends along the way, but is ultimately no long-term game strategy for a good game, it won't hook people in beyond Classic. I think.
---
&gt; if you had AQ on farm, did you really go for full 40 raid MC still because we couldn't fill MC raids at that point and half of the people were alts.
---
That's true. With that said our first rag kill was like 6m40s if I remember correctly so a lot to shave off for a pre sub kill.
---
I'm not saying it's impossible that people did it, we just never managed to do it.
---
Yeah go clear out STV then head up to hinterlands.  In hinterlands do the Jintha Alor quests and get your awesome trinket.
---
That’s what I think too. They aren’t going to fix the bugs because they want us to decide classic isn’t as good and go play retail. Ultimately the more people they can get to play retail the more money they will make.  Classic is ultimately a grab for people to resub and then decide they want to play retail after getting tired of classic and it’s many bugs.
---
I had to make this a meme
---
Dont u get ganked outside of DM 20times between runs?
---
And then you get 8 mages in every single raid group. Good luck getting any gear.
---
You just wrote 5 paragraphs and managed didn't come up with 1 shred of evidence, other than "my idol said he didn't do it, therefor he didn't do it. I don't care if there's a VoD of him having Asmongold's stream in the background, he said he didn't do it!"
---
You know what you are? A texbook narcissist. I can tell by your inability to admit you're wrong even when proven wrong. When video evidence of him sniping isn't enough, you know nothing is. You're too immature to back down, you've made up your mind already, so I'm going to be the bigger man and leave this discussion right now.
---
Peace ♥
---
Also curious
---
Weird how those names are fine but people who put "trump" had to change theirs
---
I did actually. Watched it as a stupid kid. Still hated it.
---
Exactly! I want to play the underdog faction. I thought that'd be Horde, so I started with UD mage. My main is now Nelf Druid (healing) doing what I can do help DA UNDADOGS
---
Also don't forget that bows can't get glancing hits.
---
Explains why they added the class quests there.
---
Well there is no rule against stream-sniping unless you yourself are streaming.
---
I'm currently leveling a farm lock and a horde lock and my main is a lock and personally my favorite way to level a warlock is immolate corruption agony and then wand. Doing this gives you basically 100% uptime, you can juggle 2-3 mobs doing this as well but too many mobs and you start running out of mana.
---
I used the voidwalker for my first warlock but nowadays I stick to the imp because vw is terrible at holding aggro unless you give it a 5-10 second headstart and does less damage.
---
Also buy your grimoires, they make life so much easier. If you do decide to level with the voidwalker you should definitely buy the threat grimoires and then put some points into imp VW so he can hold aggro at least semi competently.
---
Ranged attacks can't glancing blow
---
I don't agree, we only realize those flaws in 2019 but in 2005 nobody knew and didn't feel them, everyone was using dungeon sets even if they were garbage because they just didn't know. World buffs weren't as abused too
---
In Vanilla the challenge wasn't only time, the game was streight up difficult for the skill levle and knowledge
---
We are doing triple splits for Ony for month now. You can easily kill her with like 15 people. Even PUGs do it with ~25.
---
I group updates like that into my perception of classic+
---
I would love a classic+. However, just focusing on those updates you listed will not provide continued longevity. If they want to keep players they need to produce new content not slightly altar exciting content.
---
I also feel that BiS lists will be updated very quickly, DBM will update mew boss mechanics very quickly, and therefore the people that choose to use those resources will be relatively unchanged.
---
i found on my human rogue that even getting white swords from the AH or the weapons dealer in SW was an extreme boost to my ups
---
Dont u get ganked outside of DM 20times between runs? Dm lashers
---
lmao I'm going to be honest and say leveling a paladin was a sunk cost fallacy all the way I didn't enjoy leveling one not even in the slighest
---
Taxi service??
---
I think he just calls everyone beefybits Nick
---
But they still dont roll against many other classes, and are the sole user of plate armor (if youre horde, though paladins plate typically has different itemization anyway).
---
Meanwhile mages roll against the 7 other mages in the raid group, the 4-5 warlocks, the occassional shadow priest, paladin healers wanting to also roll on that mageblade...
---
That you busted your ass and grinded 20 hours a day for the easy ranks. The ranks that people legit get casually playing bg’s for 3 hours a day. Thankfully bg’s are coming out early or you’d probably be struggling to stay ahead of the decay once you got to ranks that require actual grinding to maintain. But then again you brag about working like an indentured servant just so you can live like an old Irish potato field peasant so working harder and not smarter seems to be your game plan for life and leisure. Good luck on rank 14. Once you achieve it maybe you should take a job bussing tables or something so you can pay back that debt you owe your girlfriend.
---
Alliance actually dominate the Feralas road on Whitemane, definitely more consistent PvP groups. The road out of Kargath always has alliance kill parties behind the rocks as well.
---
Keep crying.
---
Org is also horde territory. Major cities aren't the main problem.
---
Yea I’m not sure ethier just tryna confirm
---
So my duo is a fury warrior and I'm a healadin. We can pull much more than any mage can. Your problem is you need a healer for sustain and you will be much more powerful than any mage.
---
I understand your argument is solo farming but if they were to buff the warrior for solo farm capability it would be a whole extra level of broken in a group.
---
yh make mages and farm zulfarak
---
I think this compromise sort of upsets both sides. No changes would obviously be upset, and classic+ or expansion people aren't getting new content.  They should either do classic+ or TBC imo. But I could see them making it a diablo/pserver seasonal game as well
---
Lol i got you sorry if i came off as a dick. but tbh locks pre 20 is kinda what the class is dots and fear and sbolts plus pet management. at 42 is when they have all their tools but I love the class.
---
True, true as a frost gnome mage I can attest to this.
---
However the problem is, as an Alliance gnome frost Mage, I *can’t* be an ass-hole and be true to my ass-hole stereotype if 3 ass-holes outnumber me every time. Can’t be a bully if there’s 3 bullies bullying you already!
---
Ok cool I think I've been looking at something like this. Mostly I just wanted to be sure I wasn't overlooking anything.
---
Imagine having a shit taste in films
---
Are you guys using enchants at all?  There seems to be very good one but I don't know if it's very useful before lvl 60.....
---
But now that we are 30, and new kids grow up knowing so much more than we used to, there is no space for a game like that to exist except for a short relive of the past. Which, don't get me wrong, is a blast! Just like my dad enjoys his old radios, but I don't.
---
I'm hoping for F R E S H servers with a modified timeline. Honor and BGs in at launch and a  hard faction queue system at launch.
---
Beefybits is a term of endearment.
---
Dont u get ganked outside of DM 20times between runs? For lashers
---
Well yeah I get that.. I do the same shit but where?
---
Why have you reposted your thread? I will repeat the answer for other people with same issue:
---
&gt;WoR will only hit 3 targets with the knockback. These 3 are assigned by lowest GUID in melee range. So as long as no one moves out / dies, the same 3 ppl will always be knocked back. Just assign a healer to the 3 targets and have all melees stay in.  
---
&gt;Second component of WoR is a GLOBAL threat wipe. This is not resistable and will affect everyone in the raid. The way to deal with this, is to make sure your tank is not one of the 3 lowest GUIDs so he never gets the knock back. Tank pools rage before WoR gets cast. As soon the WoR goes off, he taunts and goes ham with his 100 rage. During execute phase he cycles taunt, mocking blow, Ae taunt and hopes that Rag dies before he turns on the Fury warriors.
---

---
\+heal is still really good because FoL has such a low cost, so even only getting 3/7 is more than enough. Also +heal gives you more HPS, which also helps with downranking, meaning even better efficiency.
---
Sub numbers in Wrath entirely disprove your claim.
---
Are icecaps worth alot on other servers? Only 20s on mine
---
I’ve mined 45 crystals since I hit 60. It honestly felt that the Rng was much better when there was layers. I was getting a crystal very 12 nodes now I hit 30 and nothing
---
gO bAcK tO rEtAiL
---
33 runs for my mage hat from UD strat before it dropped,  62 runs of BRD arena and haven't seen caster hit belt drop. 7 coffer runs and boreal mantle hasn't dropped. I received my briarwood Reed on my 4th UBRS run (previously 50+ on another server) . 
---
When you have issues in the past you start counting from the beginning. You just know. I start counting from the FIRST run.
---
Yeah... um, try playing on my server bro. It’s a non-stop horde gankfest. Primarily because, like most servers, there is way more horde than alliance. Everyone rolled horde this iteration of wow and that’s all there is to it
---
What class were you and how long did each run take?
---
That is true. But people are acting like Advertise has never done it in his life even though he admitted he does it. It does not make him look good to keep doing the thing he might have gotten banned for.
---
Whats a good addon that speeds up the process of putting herbs on AH individual stacks? Currently im
---
shift clicking my herbs one by one and its very slow
---
My highest level toon is 35 so I can't complain about having been ganked much. I am taking it extremely slow and from what I hear it's really working out for me. By the time I'm 48 things will be much more calm. Just gonna level alts, do professions, make gold, and hope that not everyone on Alliance side quits.
---
It’s ok no need for saving face.
---
eh i never considered it lazy. it's probably what they had to do in order for it not to clip on 5 other things. seems like a compromise for more reasons.
---
Rhok uses a clipped rotation, so you should be using aimed shot on cool down. However I tend to let the autos go off first if it's less than a second from going off
---
You don’t play a warrior? Do you?
---
Try’s hand is not even close to soloable as a warrior.
---
Hi, /u/gaz-cs
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e3jheq/day_15_fix_the_fucking_chat/). 
---
I don't understand, how isn't there room for an improved classic that would be much more challenging, tuned  for 2019 knowledge and not already theorycraft ?
---
Yes. We’re all compulsive alt levelers.
---
Leveled an Orc from 1-60 and now i'm leveling a Human, currently at 40.
---
Leveled the Orc as Sword.
---
Human i'm leveling with Maces! Oh boy!! Its Way better!!! Human racial + mace stun is much better for PVE leveling. Focus on getting good maces, slow + high min-max dmg is the best. You can get 2 slow ones since its fine for leveling and who cares about poisons right now.
---
Anyway, do this and just destroy everything in your path. Kill mobs 1 by 1, keep Slice n Dice up 100% of the time, don't botter with stealth, do quests on Green and don't even botter with mobs 1-2 levels higher, get the 5 points in Parry and the skill below it, do dungeons whenever needed and around level 35+ farm mobs that die fast and drop lots of greys/cloth so you can farm your mount, dont botter with professions unless its herb/alch since its cheap and fast to level, if u'r stuck with only yellow/orange quests, grind mobs, NEVER skip mobs, just kill+walk. Anyway.. Rogue combat is fun cus u don't need to stop to rest.. Just kill kill kill.
---
100% agree with you. I wish I had mained warr
---
nah it's ok I'm a kinky masochist and the thing that makes me extra hard is leveling a class that feels like dragging your jewels through broken glass while someone salts the floor and you get doused in napalm :D 
---
I know you speak the truth, but I'm super conflicted with the spell casters atm, in my head it's always super close between Mage and Lock, even though Lock wipes the floor with mages in PVP it's just urgh so close
---
You....fucking.....savage. #Gnomesarepeopletoo #Gnomelivesmatter
---
That's not obvious. Hopefully they will
---
Oooof got me right in the OCD
---
Population imbalances have little to do with it. It's just the overall population. Heartseeker is something like 80:20 alliance:horde but even as alliance it's nearly impossible to quest in 50+ zones. Blasted lands is on horde lockdown because they kill anyone in it and all of the alliance there that are 60 and can fight back, just ignore them. 
---
When the servers are 5x or larger than they were in vanilla, there is no way for this not to happen.
---
Lol "crybaby alliance" vs "carebear-coddle-me horde". Brave choice there safespace warlock
---
I think those odds re pretty standard.
---
"FIFTEEN FUCKING DOLLARS A MONTH!"
---
https://youtu.be/3bHH_HVx3Lw
---
Might find even more today then when you did the first time through since they have removed layering
---
But if they go for TBC instead of classic+, we should at least have the improved classic, that's what this post is about !
---
Because they will do TBC 99%
---
I oppose the top right: there is absolutely no need to retreat after you meet the organized opposition, you just bring one or two more raids to the party to farm honor.
---
Population imbalances have little to do with it. As alliance it's nearly impossible to quest in 50+ zones. Blasted lands is on horde lockdown because they kill anyone in it and all of the alliance there that are 60 and can fight back, just ignore them. 
---
How could they even go live with something like that. Incredible...
---
Alts, casuals with a demanding real life, and even some new people that held out at release are all actively leveling. At least until lvl 50🤣
---
Huh? Those Ice Giants can be soloed rather easily. Why bother with a full group there.
---
It's still great for hunters, but unless it's +5 it isn't worth it. Trueaim guantlets for example provide +4% hit from one item because of the +skill
---
&gt;or expansion people aren't getting new content.
---
I would assume creating content for classic would be way easier and cheaper for blizzard than it is for retail. For instance the mechanics in 40 man raids has to be more basic, and they are not tuning it for 4 fucking difficulties.
---
There should also be no phasing or any kind of advanced technology.
---
Do educate me on whats different then?
---
well that improved classic would make it more similar to TBC but in Azeroth. fuck outland
---
Just wait until he realizes he can 2 man dm east jump runs with a healer and rake in gold
---
Just retail.
---
I never knew that. I joined my guilds other raid team and was very confused as to why we got hit with one of those knock backs. Damn enhancement sham
---
Nah that's what the horde players currently feasting on 5v1s do.   
---
They're all quite shit at actually playing the game and lose most 1v1s and even 1v2s. Once BGs come out, horde bitching is going to be rampant on this sub.
---
That would make it a lot more efficient.  I just keep it in a text file where I keep my mats lists for raid pots.
---
The first +5 skill is worth 3% hit vs raid bosses. It’s pretty good. Only needing 5% hit versus 8% is pretty nice.
---
Who knows, maybe there are more people like you in the world who don’t have basic English comprehension and made me further elaborate in my post. Bye bye now!
---
1.Rank 3 for faster heals, you also use rank 4. Bind NS max rank HT for panic button. Never use rank 10. 
---
2. Yes. Reju max rank on tanks but it's usually not used that much. The raid will get topped of by other heals.
---
3. No, to mana intense and insane threat.
---
4. For MC you use mana pots and fire Res pot on rag. Pot early on him also, you usually get in two pots then.
---
5. I use luna. You can see incoming helas there, it's an absolute must for not over healing.
---
Dwarf's imo are the only race that looks better in retail.
---
Such high res-beards / more options is a blessing
---
Not giving a shit about getting respect from others. Respect.
---
Oh, if you wanted instant group finding and lots of loot.... Make a warrior
---
Lol no, just maximise your damage and do the raid as fast as possible, nothing should be hitting you anyway.
---
Auctioneer is the best. Use the appraiser tool in it.
---
Yep cause full tanked specced cant farm at all, and then I could agree with first orb to the tank blabla. A ms/fury warrior can farm pretty well and when he charge 30g (which is a orb as we know!) is way to much, he should have the repair costs done, when he gets 2-3 blue items or other crap...or he just goes farming after that, instead of idle if/og!
---
Can we get a horde version? 😋
---
They're executing better because it's easier. The playerbase is Horde Dominant yet the top 50 being mostly alliance is supposed to be a coincidence? This will become more obvious when we get harder content.
---
The numbers of gankers out for you is literally 10-15x higher.
---
It took like 4 hours to die yesterday on our server.
---
Every time lmao, "it's both sides", there's literally one server with an alliance majority
---
Fuck raiding MC forever for the most broken fucking item in the history of the game.
---
I dont even stop to herb them anymore
---
Now you know! Let then know for the next raid :)
---
Most competitive 1v1 PvP potential, though highest skill cap.
---
In Retail classic, we were.   1 Prot/Holy paly, 1 priest. 1 Mage and 2 destro lock. At level 49 we were pretty much destroying everything. 
---
Its depend of the bracket we are talking and which side as well
---
Zug zug
---
Fair enough then ! Have a good day sir :)
---
I thought this wasn't out till phase 5?
---
&gt;shaman is vastly superior to paladin because of how useful they are.
---
Not at all, Pally is easily the strongest PvP healer.
---
Imagine coming back for round 2 with more opinionated and angry replies in response to somebody telling you you’re opinionated and angry.
---
That is exactly it. Part of the depth that Vanilla had is what I'm doing now: I don't really take my 60s into the world anymore but the world is so large and rich that the idea of leveling alts is compelling. A world is so diverse and on such a large scale that it's like the human mind trying to picture 1 million: you don't quite feel like you grasp how big it is. A sense of possibilities. In TBC, even after 12ish years, things still feel understood and kind of contrived.
---
How are people not laughing at this.
---
That wasn’t what the exploit was, two people were using the duel option to stop other faction members from getting the honor.
---
So you are telling me that the distribution of alliance and horde is more like 7-93 than 40/60? Otherwise your argument isnt plausible.
---
to those commenting salty I better not see 1 single upvoted post about bg que times in 2weeks.
---
I'm still having a lot of fun in classic, much more than retail. I don't wanna play retail fuck this game I just wanna have some challenge and discovery while playing classic
---
It's just lame how easy and already theorycrafted it is
---
That's a really good point that I haven't seen articulated yet.
---

I remember even in p1 on a balanced server you would still be corpserunning the home stretch
---
Okay, so... the other day it took me over an hour to get inside blackrock mountain. I corpse walked from Morgan's vigil to the mountain. There were enough horde on to be posted every 40 yards or so, and they wouldn't move from their post. I would literally rez and die. Rez, and die. Rez, and die. All the way from the flight path to UBRS. 
---
Normally, it's not terrible - an average of 7 or 8 corpse walks to get to any instance inside the mountain. That day I died 27 fucking times.
---
When we get really annoyed and bitch about it... THIS is what we're talking about.
---
I just got a "buttmad alliance player" bingo from this post.
---
vote for capitalist controlled politicians in a capitalist created political system to defeat capitalism. genius
---
Got the 295  Superior Str enchant yesterday, 37g but i learned it:p
---
It does tell you your fastest time, and the number of times you’ve done the boss.
---
Let's repeat what you said
---
\&gt; You need fire damage (for rain of fire) 
---
Key word: Need
---
As proven, spell power does next to nothing to RoF and even a +500 spell power beast in epic gear isn't gonna save a single wave over some +100 damage fresh 60 on that farm. Yet you claim you \*need\* to improve your rain of fire  through spell power
---
**NEED**
---
Maybe we all failed to understand you don't actually meant "need"? 
---
stop giving advice on a class you know nothing about.
---
Hard to take that all he did was just run around wasting other people their time for 10 hours that day in his 4-5 man squad.
---
Nope, it doesn't work.
---
But it does.
---
I got one of those too, like wtf???
---
Lol what? Fury warriors have like no drops in MC and have to roll against half the raid for it. Our group has more rogues / warriors than any other class combined, that's some serious gear competition.
---
They said they were committed to keeping Classic servers. Like, at the announcement.
---
True! Blizzard should add level boosts to classic because I enjoy playing that way
---
I didn’t enchant any gear unless it was pre-raid best in slot or better.
---
Yes, I have noticed that players log in less during the hours that the majority of people are either sleeping or going to work/school. What an amazing observation.
---
Yes, make meme jokes and laugh. Much easier then accepting the problem and considering solutions.
---
Fuck we are screwed.
---
Got a name for that subreddit?
---
Hopefully they never do.
---
You’re an idiot, we are done here. You’re free to give advice to the OP, but you didn’t. You attacked me over *pedantics* instead, providing him with no useful information. Please stop being a waste, reply to OP if you have useful information, otherwise, just shut the hell up.
---
Stating "you didn't read the OP" is especially ironic when you either didn't read my reply or are too stupid to understand it.
---
But since you want it so badly, best answer:
---
WPVP: Priest, pal (or shaman or priest), hunter, mage, warrior (or rogue)
---
BG: Priest, pal (or shaman or priest), hunter (or lock), mage, warrior
---
Mines been buggy. It's not calling out events on raid bosses.  Probably need to download a better version or see where the conflict is
---
It may not be apparent to a newer player like yourself without experience across both factions and multiple servers in vanilla, but the servers were never this full in vanilla. A queue would be enacted with far fewer players logged into each server. I don't mind explaining what everyone else knows if you want to keep acting dense.
---
I'm glad OP doesnt run a company. Imagine coming up with a super non profitable idea and implementing it.
---
I'm just speculating like everybody else here, but I can't imagine it would be a perma ban.  Blizzard wants your money, and they're not going to give you a reason to go away.  I'd bet my lunch on a short term ban, probably a week to 30 days.  
---
To be honest, I'd be more worried about getting cheated by the gold sellers, since you have absolutely no way to compel them to follow through since the transaction is under the table.  What are you going to do?  Go to the better business bureau? After they get your money it's 100% trusting shady anonymous entities to hold up their end of the deal.
---
Is it the norm for casters to flask BWL? Curious what the standard consume requirements look like besides the standard health/mana/runes/prot pots
---
And I would never suggest the contrary! Have as much fun as possible, I am not the fun police ;) 
---
I sense you are displeased with retail and I share some of those sympathies. But let's not pretend Classic is challenging. It's time consuming for sure, but it is very simple for a modern audience. Are you sure somr of your sentiment isn't nostalgia and wanting to be in a place of comfort? It's not that good a game objectively...
---
this hits too close to home im gonna have to go grief some more lowbies. remember who caused this
---
And as a result they usually cost 8-10g
---
Im not even thinking about the charges just the stats. If youre going feral dps at 60 you prob need a bag of those for each raid.
---
I'm sorry to hear that.
---
Lol have only gotten one group to actually make it to princess so far, and then we wiped at 1% from one last damn heal
---
Also ran like 25 times so far and only 1 HoJ drop and I lost...
---
I'll be 60 before I get either of these lol
---
yeah keeping your classic playerbase without spending ressources to create enw content is such a non profitable idea... LOL !
---
Why do you find so hard to answer an relatively easy question? What's "far too many" in your opinion, can I have a number?
---
I put Fiery on level 19 weapons as my rogue - just because those tend to last a little longer than any 1-15 weapons. 
---
Totally up to you if you have the extra cash to blow
---
Ladies and gentlemen, we got ‘em.
---
If you head to the video, Kfax is a Mod/sub of his channel and said he was quitting.
---
The stats are really good compared to everything else that level.
---
Did the CD change from when vanilla was retail and now?
---
You've had mages actually save pulls in instances, instead of just always being the source of the problem and dying instantly? Lucky!
---
&gt; I’ve seen 3 hojs

Yo you have been looting the 0 HoJ i saw in 100+ runs?

Yeah but It suck to be horde just for pvp. Dont get me wrong, i would prefer my warlock undead over human, BUT by experience in the past, and experience on any private server, alliance get instant queue in BG when horde have to wait 5-15 min to enter. And this is the main reason that I am alliance :P
---
Phase 2 is out so gl hf getting there on PvP realms
---
&gt; But let's not pretend Classic is challenging. It's time consuming for sure, but it is very simple for a modern audience. 
---
That's the point of the post !!! It was supposed to be challenging but ti's not because of your modern knowledge, it should be retuned for 2019.
---
/spit
---
Gonna be honest, AV bridge is a legitimate complaint, coming from an Alliance player.
---
Same! And I think we’ll be there again, in 4-5 years time.
---
I dont until its best gear for the current phase. Its just waste of time to really enchant gear when preparing for MC.
---
Naa they were in a raid group and my party members were getting the kills.
---
One straggling guy we chased down for a while then I caught up and dismounted. I got about 1.5k damage on him before my party caught up and killed him and I got no honor or an hk. My party members all recieved credit.
---
A lot of these problems don't come from the game itself, it comes from the fact that 15 YEARS have passed, Vanilla WoW has been beaten inside and out, everyone knows literally everything now, with all the tools we have now literally NO ANSWER is unsolved
---
Blizzard can't fix this without just remaking the entire game from scratch so no one knows everything, but let's be honest people would find out what BIS items are through data-mining and simcrafts within the first 24 hours of it being out.
---
&gt; It might be a different story once we are nearing AQ/Naxx, but right now, I can hop on any day and find something to do.
---
I feel the opposite personally, I log in and can't find anything to do.
---
What does ? My formulation ? The helpers are being passive agressive in their responses, not the people asking for help.
---
In short, his list isn't valuing hit very high as he is using weights for Naxx which has hit on the gear anyways. Using his weights, you'll end up at 9% in Naxx/AQ40 gear.
---
Just take the weights and bump up from 6 to like 15.
---
No one can help you.  I think it's a 2hr respawn after every fail/complete, so you can't just try again right away.
---
He killed you because your friend came.
---
Its meant as a joke.
---
"You will have it in theory because u lived in that instance"
---
and
---
"You still will not see your gear because classic loottables are a joke and rangeing from melees to hunters and also casters they all have nearly the same bis lists in those groups."
---
Does seeing such a treat give you *paws*?
---
Ah I see! Wouldn't you say that's modern raiding though? Challenging stuff without the bad things!
---
I wasn’t aware keybinds were something that wasn’t already hidden? Or rather not actively displayed...? Much confusement.
---
Are you talking about the whole UI?
---
Meatspin?
---
The fight is just jank. But its easy so doesnt really matter.
---
"You still will not see your gear because classic loottables are a joke and rangeing from melees to hunters and also casters they all have nearly the same bis lists in those respective groups."
---
P2 can suck on my beefy bits
---
The real problem is Blizzard's mentality.  
---
We are so commited to not making changes to classic wow that we refuse to make change to fix the problems introduced by the changes we made.  
---
We told you, you thought you did, but you didn't.  Pre-order Shadowlands kthxbai.
---
They used to be almost nothing, but for a reason I don’t know, the price of dreamfoil has dropped and the price of icecap has risen so that they’re roughly equal. About 13g for a stack
---
MC is pretty easy so Pre-raid BIS is largely unnecessary for gear slots that can be replaced in raid anyway. 
---
For those items that last a few phases, those are the ones you grind for.
---
I would not be against Mages being patched out of the Game.
---
Im talking about flamelash EU (pvp), im playing horde there. Majority of horde players are still running around either solo or in a group with at most 5 people. Alliance is roaming around popular zones in groups of 5-20 players. Basically, when we run into someone we are always at a disadvantage, sure, if you stick to a spot with ur gank squad as alliance ur gonna get ran over. But, when you do it smart like the number 1 alliance guild on the server (Venture) is doing, you end up winning a huge majority of your fights. If it was as one-sided you are trying to claim, they wouldnt even get worldbosses. Afaik they have been going around 50/50 so far.
---
They did just fine imho.
---
Judging from what is available to see in that room, this person spent more money than they responsibly should and needs to clean their room.
---
Judging by comments I've seen about paladins in general so far since launch, a very large portion of horde players aren't ready for holy paladins in bgs honestly.
---
Oh and also the fact that the majority of horde are 10-17 year olds. I know that was incredibly hard to infer by what I said but here I am spelling it out for you.
---
Warrior pre-bis is quite easy to get compared to something like warlock or shadowpriest.
---
yeah less than 1% of the cost to make an expension and it would still be a big hit lol 
---
You just need a few designers to retune and rebalance you don't need any artist to create new assets etc...
---
You train them on your mount so after iceblock they will be back.
---
I was very fortunate to have this happen, but I don’t think it’s always what everyone wants to do. All the rest of the priests in my guild had to buy theirs &lt;_&lt;
---
Wait I'm 51 I can do BRD?
---
Yeah, merges are a high possibility for Classic’s future, with or without BC. I love Classic, but ten years from now I don’t think it would have 40+ servers with good populations still.
---
I’m not confirming there’s more kids on horde, but anyone who’s played alliance knows they’re straight up nazis.
---
Lol. Ok here’s ur horde version. 
---
Lvl 1-60. Anywhere u fuking want. 
---
The end. 
---
Can’t you use Bartender and then enable the dragons and pretend you don’t have Bartender
---
Icy veins tends to get it right
---
A lot of the arguments from bingo are more or less legit as well, I am just looking forward to the shitstorm once people have their reality check.
---
Dagger rogue would be my guess. A crit ambush could probably be the biggest single hit you can toss out
---
Depends entirely on your guild my man. BWL does not have any serious dps requirements, it won't hinder progress to be a little lower on dps. Although I would probably recommend to flask doing progression.
---
I'm leveling an Alt there... Everything on AH is SO CHEAP!! Kinda suck since i want my mount XD
---
Overall, lots of activity on LFG.
---
What?! Who could say they've done amazing work seriously? They've not fixed bugs they acknowledged in Sept and it seems they have no intention to do so. They appear to be running a skeleton crew. Not to mention the p2 cluster fuck they've done nothing to address or even say a series word about.

Warriors are literally the best class in the game. Stop your whining.

Pre 60 its quite rare to use enchants due to constantly upgrading gear.

Hahahahahahahaha How The Fuck Is Dragon Slaying Real Hahahaha Dragon Just Fly Away From The Ground Like Dragon Use Your Wings Haha
---
Naw. Getting to BRM normally, means you might face some pvp, even in old school, sure. Sometimes you'd have a raid group going there, and if you had some bad luck, well, you'd die once, maybe twice, and get in. If a stealthing class, probably not even that. 
---
That's no big deal. Nowadays, you're dead on landing, and you begin a thirty minute death crawl towards BRM, watching as your respawn time slowly lengthens. You can't actually fight them, because you are outnumbered ludicrously, and Spy greatly reduces your chances of getting to actually stealth.
---
Population absolutely matters.
---
Auctioneer has an easy-to-use interface for posting multiple stacks of whatever size you want.
---
Tradeskillmaster further automates things by letting you set up sort of macros that will post any specific type of item at market price and do it all in one button press, but the interface can be confusing at first.
---
Run Strat living 3 man. A decent tank, mage and healer, round robin the orbs and you should make some decent gold/hour. If 3 man is too hard, add a 4th guy.
---
Burst damage will be massive though with 2h, plus I think most of the talents are quite useful in pvp imo(kings, precision, guardian,impr hammer of justice), toughness is not too terrible.
---
There was a shammy that solod it to a certain percentage using the ledge, would that work for you?
---
Such a surprising revelation from a 15 year old game! Damn if only there would've been a way to know that before you started as a warrior ... life sometimes really kicks you unexpectedly in the balls!
---
Well I mean even if that's true which we don't know...   
---
It's like such a small portion of your life, and it should be something that, in the long scheme, shouldn't be anything close to disgruntling. Guys acting like he just lost 20 hours of gametime on pokemon.  
---
I don't mind when people upset or express their emotions, but I hate seeing hyperbole like this all over this sub, it's such bullshit.
---
I’m legit thinking about buying a repair bot? Never bought one so don’t know how much they going for. Even if it’s a bit pricey my main can cover the cost so maybe it’s worth it to not have to ghost run multiple times.
---
Can blacksmiths create Dark Iron gear, in this case dark iron bracers, on any anvil? Implying they got all the mats needed including dark iron bar

As much as I dislike flying mounts, I will always miss the feeling of being a druid, jumping, and shifting into bird form to take to the skies.

Because every single BiS list for anything that is not “meta” is not 100% accurate, and the true “BiS” item depends on the situation. Even rogues and hunters aren’t 100% accurate. There’s also a difference between what is best for mitigation, and what is best for threat - and depending on what the rest of your party/raid is, or what you are pulling, you will need more threat or more mitigation.
---
It’s the same reason MCPs are insane on druids for tanking, when you need to generate a shit load of threat (like Onyxia p3), an MCP is gonna be a lot more useful than Warden Staff.
---
Hey thank you! Looks like he looks for solo farming and probably not interested on dme grouping
---
Buy gold?
---
The runs are either quest run or key run
---
I got bored on my 60 so I made a rogue to level. Didn't see anyone really in Elwynn but when I got to Westfall I couldn't find poor Blanchy's oats! Turns out there are quite a few people leveling in Westfall at least.
---
It's almost like there's benefits and drawbacks for each class, hmm
---
You may be "out-sniped". Priests with good gear just spam quick Flash heals, that land before yours.  
---
Or your raid may be full on heals )
---
According to most of my groups, golem is the last boss of BRD
---
Reed is best, seal vs eye is very even, but if you have world buffs (like ony buff) then seal edges ahead (as you get more crit, SP becomes the stronger option).
---
Yeah the ban algorithm is fast with shit like this these days.
---
We traded thausonds of gold with other guilds to create the server first Hand of Rag and the two main people doing the heavy gold/mats trades where both banned within 5 min.
---
They opened a ticket to let them investigate and the ban was reissued in 1-2 hours.
---
You try to drop both MP5 and Spirit to maximize Stam, Healing Power, Int, Crit for PvP.
---
I would Z draw my weapons as an indicator of aggression but I've bound the key to /tickle. So no aggression today.
---
DBM tracks the number of kills you have on a boss and outside of that i keep excel documents for all of my preraid items and the number of attempts.
---
On Northdale i had seen 2 felstrikers (and won them) by the time i got to win my unreserved truestrike shoulders on run 117.
---
In classic (Herod-PVP) i have done 237 runs of the arena and killed Garrosh 34 times now. Still no SGC. A Hunter in my guild got SGC and HOJ in ONE RUN because noone else in the run needed them. 
---
RNG = RNG
---
RNG = A Bitch sometimes.
---
Lasher farm is a joke.  Pick up mining and do 3boss, way more money.
---
Really? All of Wrath and Cata I hunted hard for achievements and that was some of the funnest memories I have in WoW. It gave me something to do instead of just log in on raid night. I don’t see how chasing an achievement or title is any different from chasing that BIS piece or rare mount that you are gonna stand in front of the bank all day showing off.
---
Yeah, I agree here. The mage has many more tools to mess with a warrior than vice versa.
---
There’s no need to rush it for me.
---
Could also mean that more jobless people play alliance.
---
60 Druid here
---
*How important is the 15% threat talent? Mandatory for tanking, nice to have, or irrelevant at lower levels?*
---
The 15% helps A LOT and the increased stealth is really really nice as well for soloing quests, it really does boost your stealth and threat by a good chunk and allows you to skip a ton of annoying mobs and elites for certain quests
---
*Should I respec to go full feral at some point (like priests do at 40)? What level? What should my talent tree look like around 40?*
---
A lot of the talents are dual talents for Druids, I wouldn't worry about respecing until 60
---
*What talents, if any, are massive power increases for cat form and I should pick up alongside tank talents for questing?*
---
Just completely fill out the feral tree while leveling and then once you're 60 go to this:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/014005001-5050501303022151-05002
---
This is the basic pure tanking talent tree for bears, Omen of Clarity is a godsend for both cat and bear form, it says it has a 2 PPM, but I've had it proc 3-4 times back to back so I'm not 100% sure, but it's amazing when it does proc
---
A huge thing that helps with tanking is pre-hotting yourself before pulling, put regrowth and rejuv on yourself and dive on in, the healing threat is HUGE and helps you control massive packs much easier, be sure to change targets when swipe spamming if there are 3+ more targets so your swipe takes turns hitting each target.
---
Made orc fren the end
---
That's the one.
---
I would of already boosted a 60, bought a bunch of gold if it were available.
---
I use Devilsaur and Unforgiven mask, unless I am in a dungeon, where I use Wolfshead helm.
---
Wolfshead helm is bugged and double procs off Furor, so you immediately jump to 20 rage when you enter Dire Bear Form (10+5+5).  Furor gives you another 10, and then ticking for more.  That's enormous.
---
You definitely want mark of tyranny/smoking heart though.  Irreplaceable.
---
Just don't do it. How about that?
---
It’s an addon mate
---
Leveling up my horde warlock, I’ve done every single dungeon at least once, completing every single quest. Some dungeons require multiple runs to complete all quests, but I never ran a dungeon more than the minimum necessary. I’m currently 60 and working on LBRS quests. 
---
Notable exceptions: Deadmines, Stockades and Gnomer.
---
Oh they gang gratzed me hard
---
It's rng.  +3 target is 17% to miss I think, which can be reduced by up to 16%.  With the 1-3% hit we currently have access to (with which two of those have better alternatives in the form of sp/crit gear) you're only going to get down to 14-16% chance to miss.
---
Beyond that it's RNG.
---
It may surprise you that adults go to bed early while kids will stay up late on school/work nights. 
---
Your lack of critical thinking and obsession with trying to push this weird agenda speaks volumes that you yourself belong to this 10-17 bracket, mentally, at least. In reality I'd say the population of 10-17yo playing this game is minuscule compared to 25-35.
---
It's pretty good for PvP (before honor gear) and general dungeoning/farming, because it has generic +damage and good amounts of int/stam. 
---
It's pretty bad for raid boss DPS because there are generally other pieces with more pure +frost/spell damage, and you don't need int/stam to kill the current raid content.
---
Also, there are several combinations of 3-piece T1 that are comparable to pre-bis alternatives in raid damage output, especially considering how much you will be AOEing in MC even on bosses, while also offering slightly more quality of life through the int/stam. 
---
It's not worthless, just not a big upgrade.
---
You people are insane. Not only DBM counting kills but also every single one of my guildies who came with me for weeks, 5 runs an hour for 14 hours a day and counting and despairing each and every attempt. 361 is the exact number of runs.
---
Lmao druid is nowhere close to the highest skill cap
---
In actual vanilla, most Alliance whining was about shaman. What happened?
---
On no. This build is not raid viable but sure it’ll do ok in dungeons. 
---
Go standard fury prot if you don’t care about PvP
---
you can backstab and eviscerate onixia when she is flying so prob just eviscerate tho maybe rupture is slightly better ignoring the debuff limit
---
If you go to BRM and there are say, 12 players there looking to kill you? GG, you are going to wind up in the exact same situation. 
---
Even if you have a group of 5 and they have a group of 6, if they want to farm you and you don't win the first fight, it's GG, you lost, and you won't be able to recover and you're going to have to either take rez sick and hearth or you're going to need to take the 30 minute slow crawl to the dungeon. 
---
Server pop doesn't matter because even in a healthy 1500 vs. 1500 server, one faction IS going to control BRM during primetime hours and the other faction is going to be completely fucked if they want to go in in anything but a coordinated raid group. So sure, you get extremely negative experiences changing hands a bit, but one faction is still going to win out in the long run and kill the goddamn server. No BGs was a mistake. It was classic, but it was most definitely a mistake.
---
It's not an overestimation.
---
No its not
---
The graveyard is pretty close by, so the corpse hopping isn't as bad as some other instances.
---
Ark inventory does this. Let's you see what all alts are wearing and what's in everyone's bags/bank.
---
Nah difficulty modes are not part of classic's philosophy, if players want easier content they play MC, ZG or dungeons.
---
Awesome, thanks for the response
---
In whitemane is the opposite because of asia waking up
---
Everyone knows it's bad design. It will be even more ridiculous once people get their r14 weapons which are Naxx-tier to begin with and start steamrolling everyone just through the virtue of gear. It's bad design, bad balance but it's intended and the choice to play is yours.
---
It won't get better, no matter what anyone says or does. You either like it for or despite its flaws or you don't.
---
Tanks should want SGC and Lionheart too. But fuck the grind tbh.
---
We usually just put another tank into the melee group who will take the hits while the real tank comes back.
---
Yes I know about it, a team of like 5/10 designers can make it easily.
---
To make a whole expension you need hundreds for like 2 years.
---
It's good for resto... in pvp. Other wise blue cloth +healing it is.
---
All that missed rest... that’s a bummer.
---
I agree that full runs are a no-go at 53, but there are lots of arena farms, jail farms, and Angerforge HoJ runs that you can join.
---
the world was never alive everyone leveled in dungeons
---
Definitely but hurt alliance at the top of this. Big ouch, took the time to make a meme just to whineeeeeee
---
Hi, /u/depressedmagi

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e3kcj8/whats_your_best_wtf_story/). 
---
Just because you lack the skills and knowledge to accomplish something doesn't mean it's impossible for everyone else.
---
Not casual at all.  We are raiding 4 days a week, 8-12 server time.  We've almost got Rag down, Ony has been on farm for a few weeks now.
---
His BiS list wasn’t working that well for me, so I’ve woven in my own pieces and stuff from other lists. I have a combination of like 5% hit, around 9k armor and 6200hp with just MotW. I tank everything in MC and Ony just fine. 
---
Don’t know how BWL will go for bearboys, so I’m farming up my resto set.
---
There is soo much room on so many other servers the only ppl complaint is the first day nerds. Y'all didn't want a dead server and now your part of the over population servers lol which seems worse than a "dead server" lol oh the tables have turned.  So many posts bashing those transfering. Lolololol
---
I thought you were being humorous and making fun but you're actually being serious...
---
That kinda makes me laugh at your comments even more.
---
As an off tank you don't need much threat gear. You'll be holding on cleave and healing at most. There aren't many options. So you can't get much hit.
---
Except they don't though. After clearing low dungeons you don't go back. And you never see high raids if you don't top raid. Which has its own charm I suppose.
---
Then you lose to priests, warlocks, decent mages, good druids...felhunter is IMO the best general PvP pet when you don't know what class you will be fighting, and beating rogues and warriors with a felhunter out is very convenient.
---
Haven't been able to find anyone to run BFD over the past few days
---
Hunt him down, kill him, eat his heart and then you will have his luck! 😆
---
That's true, but it's not because you can't get hitcapped.  It's because those alternatives are stronger than what you previously had access to.
---
Until you're hit capped (and the stat becomes useless) there's an equivalency between crit, hit and SP.  Choker of the firelord is your best neck option until AQ40 or Naxx, and it has no hit%.  That's because the 30+ sp (forget exactly) it gives is mathematically stronger DPS gain than the 1% from mystaria, for example.  Spells dont have an attack table, so 1% hit is always equivalent to slightly less than 1% DPS gain (until hit cap, where it becomes useless), so if you can beat that gain with a stronger SP/crit item you should do it.
---
Alch barely makes any money don't do it on a populated server I make like 5g a day from alchemy at max and usually less
---
To fight other babies, duh.
---
Read a book or something.
---
How?
---
Prebis pala -&gt; mageblade is like 80% to 100% 
---
Prebis mage -&gt; mageblade is like 35% to 100%
---
Which one does give the raid more power for BWL?
---
You can just read the faqs and pins in fight club and get more information out of there than anything else around. Sure you can find some other resource but I can guarantee you it wont have nearly the amount of time, effort, and data put into it. There's nowhere else if you're looking for the most accurate and up to date info we have.
---
Honestly never played classic before. Now I'm playing a warrior. Almost always solo. Yeah it sucks if you grab 3 or 4 mobs (at your level), but i can also mindlessly dps in any dungeon. Like 1.5k crits at lvl 35 while just pushing 1 button and not much else.
---
Warrior is the easiest/hardest class. I feel that in classic, the true appeal is that all classes are really great at a few key things. Like they all truly shine through their individual strenghts.
---
Because ekos drop for everyone in the group. It's one of the few farms that are more efficient in a group than solo.
---
You ever end up getting a mic?
---
Lol, then you're not very good at dungeon farming. It's literally the best xp in the game if you have *semi-competent people*
---
Only if you are the leader and you will only be able to kill whatever bosses there are left after the other group stopped.
---
Pretending like both factions arent pretty much the same is dumb.  I rarely encounter kids mostly 30 year olds.  On alliance favored servers ( not many of those) most of these are true in reverse.
---
I started a mage there at launch and played til like 32 or something. Joined bigglesworth (pvp) and never turned back. Dinged 60 a couple days after phase 2 dropped and it has been nonstop action even before that. If you want to mindlessly kill mobs you know you will win against without any real challenge, give westfall a whirl.
---
He did it for the hat, a cosmetic reward. Literally the same thing as a title or achievement
---
HPS and downranking are completely orthogonal metrics and goals.
---
I'm afraid I don't see how that is necessarily better? Personally, I think that game mechanics should not be reliant on ID's for whatever reason.
---
Sshhhh ita cute to watch him struggle.
---
I did! Now I’m chatty
---
Naked run. Put your gear back on once you're in.
---
I don't sell but i would if i had buyers lol. I'd be pretty small so buying gold off someone like me rather than a website would be a better option imo
---
I was not prepared for how big the CE box was...
---
I don't mind it being rubbery plastic, I didn't buy it as an artwork but as a reminder of the months spent in Molten Bore and the sheer elation my guild had when we downed him the first time.
---
Certainly! Right now I’m 58 so still need a few levels. It’s good for dungeons and decent for PvP, but not ideal for raids since Arms DPS wouldn’t be as good as Fury.
---
Silly request: my main is a 60 hunter and I started feeling like having an alt. I love ranged dps though I'm a bit bored of dealing with pets. I'm pretty good at controlling mine but sometimes it gets tiring having to basically play two chars at once. I would like it simpler for a change (but not mind numbing like mages).
---
Would warlock be a good choice? Thanks!
---
There are spreadsheets that will simulate this to some extent but napkin math: You need like 50 INT to avoid using a GCD on lifetap. Which is worth 60% of a shadowbolt cast, let's say that's 660 dmg. If you cast say 30 shadowbolts in a fight, 50 +dmg will get you 1245 damage. 
---
So INT certainly isn't useless if it will save you a lifetap, even if it's much lower value than other stats. Though it's possible losing spellpower will make you do an extra tap due to it also scaling lifetap so your taps will be weaker.
---
Just don't roll to low pop server. Ques are worth it. I was waiting for tank for 3 hours and then just deleted my char and went back to more populated server
---
Crazy huh?
---
I have also noticed that after 10 PM or during school or work hours Alliance numbers go down by 75% as well. Thank you, detective /u/Wellfuckthisucks.
---
I never suggested that. My point was Classic does dungeons and difficulty better than retail. Classic stays Classic for nostalgia reasons, and if you want to divert from it, you recreate retail in 15 years.
---
You can still LoS the boss in the tunnel, it just requires the priest to be quite further back. I've done it a number of times.
---
Warriors complaining are funny.  You picked the most popular class, that every group essentially requires, and is the best in the game at 2/3 of the roles.  You knew what you signed up for, dro2p bitching.
---
&gt;while just pushing 1 button and not much else.
---
There are some mages who would like to talk to you.
---
360 runs is very realistic for arena runs. I hit 400 dry yesterday and another warrior on my server is close to 500 dry at this point.
---
Be alliance, everyone is rolling alts waiting for bg's to come out.
---
I can solo them easily as well but that doesn’t mean it’s efficient.
---
I see more hordeon after 10pm and less alliance. More adults play hordeto avoid having to deal with the little brats that roll alliance because "LoL nIghT ElvEs R tHa cOolIesT"
---
i'm not diverting from it at all, i'm keeping the original philosophy, just retuning it. I'm not adding any additional difficulty mode or anything just make the only difficulty tuned for modern players
---
*15 year old pixels
---
Thats why they call it STVietnam
---
Hope you get some nice fights man!
---
What is GUID?
---
Im a 🍌
---
Frostadamus has 16k gold on his mage, and another guy has over 25k worth of gold in consumables on across several characters.
---
With that logic the caster can get a group of 4 melees.
---
Better start DME lasher farming my friend
---
Is that something you need to do a lot? Solo flight masters?
---
I use the wowhead dressing room to check how my character would look in tier gear. Avoided a nasty clipping issue with T1 that way.
---
It’s fairly enjoyable when you can roam around ganking the few ally players who bother to log in.
---
The top 7 had 5 who did dungeons
---
So... Classic, but with retail, shall we say Heroic, bosses? I think I know a game that has these!
---
If anything, the incremental Ids are used to *avoid* data collisions.
---
Since it is assigned on character creation, there's no real performance hit noticed even if the assignment server is being heavily used.
---
Especially in today's modern cloud server setups, it would not be surprising to me to learn that they have a dedicated "server" to just hand out these ID's (I use quotes because it is not likely a physical server).
---
We already know they use an assortment of "servers" to handle chat, instances, continents, etc. So I don't think it's a stretch to assume that they 'containerize' (for lack of a better word) as much of the server functionality.
---
Best place to mine at 250? I can mine small thorium now!
---
Scholo is great for late 50s
---
Yes you can see them near your body, just like mobs
---
That's because you can restore items yourself now, they don't want item restoration requests clogging up their tickets.
---
Pvp, collectors set, appearance, etc. Locks and mages rock a lot of +frost/shadow dmg greens until after BWL.
---
Show me side by side dreamfoil and then I'll be convinced.
---
are you giving sugegstions right now ? i'm lost
---
And your dog Old Blue.
---
Tanks get to pick and choose who they want in their groups due to being in demand. Dps in general is not in demand.
---
I can't for the life of me understand how you'd think the lifetime of a game has anything to do with the skill level of players.. You do realize some people have never played wow before right?
---
While I kind of agree, mages can also get Staff of Dominance out of MC, Aurastone Hammer isn't bad, but it's kind of like Sorcerous Dagger where yeah it's technically an upgrade, but not to the extent the Staff/Mageblade are. Crit also gets way more valuable the more you have on a Paladin as it works double duty as a heal boosting stat and making the spell completely free when you get a crit.
---
If you plan on going past MC, I think it is a mistake to not consider paladins for the Mageblade (or Robe of Volatile Power and Mana Igniting Cord).
---
Compete or consolidate, that is the ethos of capitalism.  unfortunately, it is shown time and again that once you are an entrenched player, the best strategy is to buy out your opponent instead of beat them.
---
It's the natural progression of a wealth-based power system.
---
Any "dps warrior" that won't tank dungeons is an idiot.
---
Here's my submissions for the alliance bingo:  
---
- \*Complains about horde players on reddit\* (FREE SPACE)  
---
- "When BGs come out..."  
---
- "Horde players are so noob picking faction with OP racials" \*Holy Paladin exists\*  
---
- "Zug zug horde can't win without outnumbering" \*Plays in a 6-10 man raid group every day\*  
---
- \*Ironforge portal\*
---
FWIW, I had my epic belt before I had my Ban'thok Sash but yeah, it's fairly common.
---
I still dont have the little +spellpower ring from arena though and have refused to buy underworld band for some reason...
---
Try hard raids have even more warriors than mages...
---
You’re dead right. I have a much harder time vs casters (spriests especially) but if I have a chance I’ll use succ when fighting a warr or rogue.
---
&gt;and tank them yourself.
---
The most amazing part is how fucking unacceptable that is for many warriors. Me tank? No no no.
---
SGC is trash. I would be shocked if 2% crit was worth even 1% extra threat for a Warrior tank. Meanwhile, the ~400 armor and 14+ stamina you lose compared to the Might chest or Breastplate of the Chromatic Flight is worth a lot more than 2% mitigation. If you want to sacrifice mitigation for threat, do it on your gloves (Edgemaster's), boots (Bloodmail Boots), bracers, rings, trinkets, neck... basically any other slot before your chest piece.
---
Lionheart is good, but not necessary to hold threat over DPS in current gear. You can get it in 6 months to a year when arcanite is cheap and threat is actually important.
---
You should level like all classes do, point puts into the optimal levelling build and collect high stam gear to tank low level dungeons. Ferals can also collect high intel and heal low level dungeons in the same way. 
---
1. The threat talent isn't in the optimal levelling build and it isn't needed in low level dungeons, it helps sure, but not worth gimping your levelling speed.
---
2. Follow the druid levelling guide on wowhead
---
3. You shouldnt pick any tank specific talents while levelling so just following the feral levelling guide until mid 50's at which point I suggest you start thinking about working on your BiS. You can chose a tank build at this stage but if you want to leave your options open and collect healing gear as well, you could run a HotW / NS build that will allow you to tank and heal (fill out the feral side first). The difference between this build and a full feral tank is that you lose a little bit of dmg and therefore threat however the mitigation is the same. 
---
With regards to end game, unless you are raid MT or pushing progression / speed runs and your melee want leader of the pack I would stay with the HotW / NS build, it allows you to heal in fights where you are not needed to tank and as a bonus, it's a good entry level PvP build. To manager your expectations, be aware that you will likely get pushed down the tanking order as BWL approaches because you will be competing against warriors in full T1/T2 whilst feral druid tanks have 3 mitigation peices in MC/Ony and arrive at BWL still wearing a fair bit of blue pre-raid BiS.
---
Been playing alliance on whitemane. Stv has been my fav zone so far. I normally only run into pvp that is in my level range where as other parts of the world I’m constantly getting popped by 60s.
---
I like your op, but the meta on pservers didn't change all that much ever. But I do like your ideas
---
Ah ahaha the bottom left one is great.
---
Dis you encouter lvl 40 mges as a level 52 warrion in PvP?
---
Let me tell you the story of the dead warrior that can't even land a hit before dying to infinite kiting.
---
Likely luna unit frames or shadowed...
---
You can customize them to look like this.
---
zf
---
I don't blame capitalism for (all) the alienation.  It's just like the alienation in WoW retail.  Some would call it optimization or individualism.  Now we don't need each other or to have relationships, I can just buy whatever I need to consume and not be a part of a community.  My work is segmented away as well, but still just as (or more) productive than the past.  Communities are not profitable and therefore have low value.
---
Who needs to communicate with each other in this MMORPG praised for its social aspects right?
---
Imagine being so fucking incompetent you can't get a fucking chat system to work in 2019 holy shit
---
Indeed. A problem that occurs is that the information is so much, you can't keep everything in mind. And if you ask a question to clarify something, chance is that someone will lash out.
---
Thankfully the mods can tell when someone is confused, and they clarify. It has happened to me, once.
---
it's no more casual than any other pve server, which are more casual than pvp servers in general.  its server first rag kill was somehow faster than on pagle even though it has half the population
---
The Horde may have taken over Tanaris, Un’Goro, Western and Eastern Plaguelands, Blackrock Mountain, Ironforge, etc...
---
But the Alliance are holding down r/classicwow very well! 
---
Pls no downvotes, I’m a hordie from Heartseeker so I feel your pain
---
I mean, personally, I think it looks neat and would like a full set just to wear around town.
---
It did when a new pserver came out using different numbers for things.
---
1 pserver would have 315 weapon skill as cap another would have 310. Things like that would change the meta, wasn’t drastic but it was changed.
---
Haha sorry. I was suggesting the game that has modern level difficulty bosses _is_ retail. I think that too is exactly what you want, but find it hard to say that because you decided you don't like retail... maybe for other reasons, good reasons, that's all fair.
---
Instead of 15 warriors?
---
Sounds like we should blame capitalism then. I don’t see the disagreement
---
Salty.
---
Blackcrow is the name of the LBRS crossbow. Currently trying to get it on my warrior.
---
&gt;  Monopolies can't exist without a state to support them. 
---
So this is the only bit of information you decided to drop into the conversation.  Sure, that's fine, but what does it mean?
---
Markets can't exist without a state to support them.
---
Joining a supportive guild with players familiar with their classes will probably help you more than any wasteman discord.
---
1) Very  
---
2) Furor 5/5 is a must for tank, don't need to respec.  
---
3) Blood Frenzy
---
...yes
---
It's not the zug zugs fault blizzard are morons. Instead of suing them psurver developers they should've hired them to run classic for them. If they did the current situation would've never happened.
---
Same 50 Holy Priest
---
Someone shield this man, he's rage-capped
---
Love classic, I only had limited time in vanilla. But classic is ungodly poor in many design areas. Expansions were great but eventually it got too far away from what wow was
---
Can't be me chief
---
That's what I was trying to distinguish.
---
It's one thing to use incremental ids (I don't think this is necessarily bad) but having it affect gameplay is strange.
---
I'm going to have an easier time with ragnaros because I created my character after most people that started day 1 - **that** seems silly to me.
---
Actually rerolled from horde PvP to alliance PvE ... But yeah, quitter would be correct :)
---
Lol a theory with absolutely 0 statistics to back it up
---
Arms will actually top meters on any trash cleave fight. If you can't kill a boss with an arms warrior or 2, especially with how easy they made classic, you sir have the issue
---
Fair enough.
---
Ok?
---
Right I get that... but you do realize that there is other servers where the reverse happens right?
---
Every chat server has completely disconnected now. How is this possible with a studio as large as Blizzard and in the current year? Have we heard from Blizzard regarding this issue? Because this is actually really really bad.
---
I haven’t been able to quest since the honor farm started.   Anywhere.  Been hiding grinding mobs from 51-57 where I am now.  I haven’t even thought about the BRD death run.  Although I suppose I should go over there just to see the insanity.
---
US is fine. Blame your continental techs
---
I just hit 60 and respeced to DS/ruin, and I miss my pet. I find farming is slower than the drain tank build I was using to level. Would SM/ruin be closer to the drain tank build? Is DS/ruin worth it for the extra damage? Or am I farming wrong now?
---
As I said earlier : 
---
&gt;Nah modern raiding is overly complex and too dynamic.  
---
&gt;You can have MC be similar to AQ/Naxx difficulty and mechanics for exemple and later tiers to BC/Wotlk difficulty.  
---
&gt;You tune it so the gear checks are tight, not tuned for 2004 abysmal dps
---
I don't like the cata+ direction it's overly complex and too dynamic, just too different from classic. I think bosses in TBC/wotlk still have classic's boss philosphy but are much more challenging and interesting
---
Confused as to what you're trying to say? If they release the same content with just balancing changes, that's not new content. Classic+ or tbc would be new content
---
Who cares. You all know you just camped FP's to get it anyways.
---
A bit blurry, what is that??
---
The problem is that many people join and a good amount don't read the available info, they just ask questions. People are getting annoyed when being asked the same questions 10 times/day.
---
If you read your homework and ask a question, people most likely will answer, because you will make a legit question.
---
Not a lot for an epic but still a decent haul. I think I sold mine for 20g.
---
Hair no, Big teeth, yes.
---
Is that something you see yourself still doing in two weeks?
---
What "reality check"?
---
Honestly it sounds like you're drinking a tall glass of 2 parts bitters/1 part salt. It's like you've encountered pvp on a pvp server, and rather organize some friends in-game to fight back you'd rather organize a petition on the forums to change the game lol. Then you wonder why people are telling you to go back to retail.
---
There is absolutely no world in which they release tbc and do anything with classic other than leaving as is or seasonal. Making tbc and "improved classic" would split everyone so much that classic people would just go back to pserver
---
Yes that one. Also as a warrior you should try getting the Bow from DM:E, it's way faster and you can do it with 2 people in a jump run. It gives 1% hit too
---
Even on the most populated server with massive PVP battles going on there's no chat lag here in the US
---
USA! USA! USA!
---
You don’t lose durability when you die from other players. You’ll have less corpse runs with your gear on.
---
Well the issue is resto just isn't good in raids so PvP is really the only place you'd use a druid healer anyway.
---
If it behaves like a normal pet in terms of the wow system, then you should be able to manually cast its abilities
---
From what I can see, the GUID is public knowledge (i.e. you can look up the GUID of players you run into in the world).  It's no more private than your character name from what I gather.
---
**Please someone correct me if I'm wrong**
---
If that is the case though, I see no vulnerability to it anymore than someone can /who for random people.
---
In that case, why are you bringing mages in the first place?
---
I was corpse camped for hours while leveling (again, on a Horde dominate server where I play Horde) for hours.  I understand full well what it is like to try and level and have the opposite faction camp you.  My point is, why is it always alliance bitching about Horde?  I am telling you, directly, that as a Horde player I am corpse camped by Alliance all the time on my server.
---
Are there are other servers affected by these issues, or is it just Gehennas?
---
Most questions can just be asked here on Reddit. Fight Club info is wrong over half the time, apparently the people in there find it hilarious to troll new people with false information. It's a complete wasteland. You can find the occasional oasis of good information, but you are going to have to stomach a lot of shit to get to it.
---

---
Goes for 15-20g on my realm.
---
Then they are going to lose a big part of their classic playerbase. that's dumb.
---
This is what this post is about, it would be low effort work to make classic feel fresh
---
I dont see how and I dont really understand how alliance players can be so biased towards paladins. Even in a vacuum they arent better than priest. The best thing a paladin brings is their bubble, to be able to cast freely for 8 seconds, but they can be locked out of it. While yes every other healing class can be locked out of their respective schools to be unable to heal, none of them are as devastated as a paladin is because they have other options where as a paladin.. just has to sit there. For example, priest can still fear, druid can still shapeshift and shaman's totems will still be working even while locked out.  
---
But in a *group*.. not having an offensive dispel really hurts. Thats why shaman is better, you have purge, windfury, grounding, earthbind, a **ranged** silence and slow, you can also nature's swiftness a big heal and even ghost wolf around to make space or close distance.
---
Hold till battlegrounds and probably grab 50g for it, depending on your servers econ.
---
Does “at level” means same level? A level 42 soloing the zf gy is insanely hard. It’s even hard for some 60’s
---
How many teenagers do you think play this 15 year old game?  
---
Also he got what you were inferring. He was just pointing out that it was a stupid suggestion that because horde play less during off hours that they must be teenagers.
---
&gt; It's the circle of life.
---
It shouldn't have to be this way.
---
Did not know that. Cool beans.
---
Down load the auctioneer addon
---
*But also no raid spots because you only need one MT and everyone is playing fury
---
People started PvPing in groups.
---
Smashing through Scholo is my advice. If you’re tired of Live and don’t want to split into 3 and 2 for jump runs.
---
I’d find it hard to believe Scholo nets a group under 80g/run. If you’re hauling ass, and skipping Jandice/whelps/Rattlegore Ekeler you can probably clear in 30min. That’s 160g/hr.
---
Why does it net so much? A ton of rune cloth, dark runes, and 13+ boss drops (again, not counting Jandice).
---
Not a problem on U.S. servers. 
---
So, as an American, my response is gonna be "upgrade your Walmart internet, scrubs!"
---
Friends on Firemaw have reported the same so at least two servers that I know of.
---
About 6
---
Just taunt one of the mobs out of the blizzard without doing any threat on it so that it runs back to him when the taunt runs out and the mage is oom. That usually gets them to move.
---
Idk man I feel like once you get to a certain point, you've taken advantage of SOMETHING not entirely above-board to get that much.
---
Lmk what server and side and Ill post the bbg stats
---
i turned up my gamma a bit. wall hopping requires seeing the polygons you're trying to jump on to, so you have to mess with the settings sometimes
---
The meta to show up on heal metres is to spam max rank flash heal and sometimes renews and just chug consumes to make up for the mana inefficiency
---
they talked about classic.... This is after classic is over

You can swtich the 5 in mana cost reduction if you like or the 2 in Imp Lifetap can go into Supression also. This is what I am running.
---
We don't have Vanilla Shaman we have the nerfed Shaman from just before the pre-TBC patch
---
Yeah I noticed that, their resources are definitely good and the members can be helpful. I just wish their culture could be more mature.
---
Eh, instant groups but no raid spots.
---
Tanking 5/10 mans is fine and easy enough, but you wont be getting a tank slot for any raid you didn't form yourself. 
---
There's also no raid spots for fury, at least on my realm, because everyone and their dog went fury because of hearing over and over 'fury is legit the best at everything, its godly'
---
Seriously. Send Seanzietron an in-game message on Old Blanchy
---
uuuh greater than 100% might be needed, but it's possible with runspeed to boots
---
So when Blizzard is called to address a paying customer's in-game issues their first, second, and third approach is to just lie? They're flat out lying to people? I'm not even saying they should perform item restorations, but lying to customers is fucking unacceptable.
---

It’s a 15 minute respawn before you can attempt it again.
---
Who brings a lvl 50 to brd?
---
Yeah, you are right. I didn't read all of OP's post.
---
But to be fair, a lot of wanted what OP was asking for in the firstplace, and it was literally a standard on private servers.
---
Don't really care how quick I can get to 60, I am just enjoying the game
---
Can only speak for the Horde. We're about a normal vanilla population. Enough people are interested
---
But TM vs SS is pretty unbalanced most of the time. Luckily BG's are here soon
---
It is 9% on bosses and 5% at your level.
---
&gt; It looked a little bit like he was going "Maybe I should just watch until I know how this is going" 
---
I would say with almost complete confidence that this is exactly what he was thinking.  The hunter's low health bar was what finally convinced him.  A lot of good it did him.
---
Absolutely.
---
Wrong.  The top all exploited the raid xp bug in silithus.
---
Some people enjoy policing speech, and claiming whatever supports their particular opinion to be the total truth of how something ambiguous such as language is used.
---
Language evolves, it changes, and it doesn't care what people think of it, because it will be around and different in two hundred years but they won't be.
---
It will also be different in that span of time.  But the level of salt in here is absolutely awesome.
---
Battlegrounds restricted to your realm only. Nobody is going to roll a dominant faction if it means 5 hour BG queues.
---
The downside would be if they released 2 inferior versions of the game.
---
Can't have any mana users in the melee group, have to wait for the tank to get aggro to go in and out and besides that if the tank loses aggro and melee has enough threat he will turn to them.
---
Feeling daring aren’t we...
---
It's not hard to level, but it's still hardest to level solo out of all other wow classes in classic.
---
Firemaw has the same thing. it might be related to the SPY Addon (that they should BAN imo). but this is getting fucking rediculous. i am almost instantly loosing my will to play once chat lagg kicks in. game is litteraly unplayable. cant find groups. can't communicate with anyone. remind me blizzard? is this your level of service now? cause if it is i wont renew my subscription. get your shit together or at least make a post about it like: we are aware and working on it blabla. this is unacceptable!!
---
Remember when mommy said there is no such thing as a stupid question? It was a lie.
---
In every discord people pop up the same dumb questions that have been answer by pinned posts or stuff that is the tiniest google search away. Expect bad replies. It gets old
---
I would not do 2 man DME unless your gear is good. You definitely want to be in plate/mail for this one.
---
Absolutely. It’s the general consensus that anything after wotlk was trash, but some people seem to think the game should never have had expansions and somehow Classic’s very limited end game was going to last 15 years.
---
Shrug. We’d just have to pick a server and commit to a night where we all 5 level together!
---
Reality check of BGs.
---
I suggest you pay attention to my post history, you might revaluate your impression, lol.
---
female if he actually cares about aesthetics
---
There's a severe lack of good belt options.  If you're not stealing Onsalught from your DPS (you shouldn't) and you don't need the hit from Brigam, it's your next best option.  It has a high strength budget (especially compared to most of the other might pieces), and reasonable allocation of other stats.  It's not great, but neither is the slot at large.
---
its a fucking pain in the ass when ur playing with pugs and not voice coms. the delay is atleast 5 min.
---
Fury is godly...
---
To be honest, it'll be tough to know how the "current" meta stands up to BWL.  I know killing rag pre-submerge was a pretty big deal back in Classic but now it's seemingly done by every guild.  The amount  of pre-submerge really makes me wonder how difficult fights in BWL with "Dps Checks" will be because I remember wiping on Vael for 5+ weeks.
---
Can confirm. Just finished my 4th alchemy alt
---
The developers literally struggle with a key ring.  Why do you assume a customer service technician can just correct someone statistics?  I doubt they have a tool to fix something like that but NEITHER of us know until there's proof they can.
---
Thanks! Will definitely give this a try
---
Can you provide an example where reddit has ever been a more accirate source of information than fight club?
---
I thought there were millions playing

Almost every single warrior question on this subreddit is answered incorrectly. Like nearly everything.

---
&gt;I started as a rogue night elf because I'm used to thief and mesmer from GW2 (don't really know if they will end up being similar). I'm up for changes if you have a better suggestion for a starter char but I wanted something that could be a jack-of-all-trades maybe?
---
No just good to know to see what advice might help.
---
Ne Rogue is fine. Just good to know to know where you started and what class you are.
---
If you really want 'jack of all trades' then druid is the ultimate hybrid class. They can heal, tank, dps and to a degree work as casters too. They do pay a bit of a 'hybrid tax' though, in that whilst they can do everything they aren't as good as any class which specialises in that role.
---
If you stick with rogue then I'd recommend picking up skinning and leatherworking from the first town you're in. You can make yourself some gear and gather materials from the beasts you'll be killing for quests anyway.
---
&gt; As for add-ons, I wanted to avoid using them at least in the beginning.
---
Fair enough. That's definitely the best way to start out IMO.
---
In which case the best way to progress would be to just follow the quests. There's a pretty solid path up till around 12-14 I think.  
---
If you're ever really stuck with what to do for a quest, "Wow classic  [quest name]" will find a bunch of sites with information.
---
I would upvote it but I dont want to break the perfect 69 upvote on a "K" post that is gilded. This is some kind of perfection.
---
My guild doesn't do any of that shit and downs rag in 2 hours. Don't waste 4 hours farming to save 30 minutes of raid time dude.
---
Ok but this is more just speculating and assuming than things actually happening.
---
That is sort of my point. People say it happens on both sides but that's kind of disingenuous to say when the sample size for alliance doing it is literally one server.
---
Bad lands. Good mix of iron and mithril. Mine it until 275 and then go fight for thorium veins
---
Imagine replying to "round 2" with an even more worthless comment than your first one. Nice shitty attempt at ruling tehcniques calling people "angry and opinionated" for calling out shit movies and expressing opinions on movies. Take your sociopathic shit somewhere else.

I just hit 48 on my alt.    And haven't logged into yet.  But I'm thinking a 100 BRD runs should sort it out

Is this the Howard Stern type viewer who tunes in 24/7 so they can watch and know everything about a person they hate so much to the point where a literal WORD triggers them into seeing Asmongold in another person?
---
You can, there are plenty of reset spots
---
That's true, people who don't put effort into researching are always annoying to deal with, but dealing with them is part of the job. If you don't have the patience to do it while staying calm, I think you should just leave it to somebody who does.
---
This didn't age well with ops edit

Isn't this just mass produced cheap plastic mold?
---
Felt wierd writing economics on a wow board so I linked a peer reviewed economics journal for you incase you were interested in learning. Basically capitalism can not create monopolies. You were blaming capitalism for monopolies but it is the only economic system in which they can not exist. If you're curious dm me because wow board doesn't care about this.
---
Do you know of any ?
---
You're only getting downvoted by other people who play 10+ hours a day I imagine. It does not take a rocket scientist to know that kind of time staring at a screen playing the same thing is not healthy, both physically and mentally
---
Fight Club has reached over 27.200 users and most of the questions asked daily are the same basic questions already discussed a milion times before and most likely answered in an FAQ channel, in a pinned message or simply by using the search function.
---
Most interesting questions are discussed by the community. Most non interesting questions are simply dismissed and lost in the flood.
---
This is the way of Fight Club, but this is also true for most class discords. I read the hunter discord from time to time and it seems a dozen new people ask what pet they should be using on a daily basis the first second they join, without searching for a previous answer to a very common question.
---
If your time is too valuable to do a little digging and use the resources the moderation team put time and effort into to help you, then do you really deserve other people's time?
---
&gt; If anything warriors should be better than mages at soloing at level elites.

Come on, show us :D
---
You sucked dick for this set no doubt
---
Why do both the wowhead and icyveins rogue gear guides list that rogues need 9% hit against level 63 mobs?  Don't they get 3% from weapon skill + 5% from Precision making their necessary hit only 1%?
---
You for real here?
---
I find at least one gnomer run to be extremely useful around 29-30 because the quests are all extremely easy to grab and they give about 3/4 of a level at that point.

After 10pm is also when people with jobs goto bed.  You honestly think that many children play classic?  Lol.
---
Gonna be honest here (block of text inc.), 
---
While this is obviously a canned response, and the GM obviously didn't use %n to change the name automatically, there's really nothing they can do. If you lost honor randomly, it's because the system has lost that data, most likely. It's not that it was 'taken away,' or 'subtracted' from what you had, but rather that all that information wasn't saved. If it wasn't saved... there's nothing to pull up. The amount of data to track HK is probably enormous, and the idea that Blizz, or anyone really, could hold onto ALL of that data all the time just isn't feasible. 
---
Also, I work in IT as a tier 1 support agent, working into tier 2 and dev. As tier 1, a lot of the calls I get are asking about how something is done, or where to find something, and that's what we're trained for. We aren't trained or have the knowledge to do actual bug fixing, that's why we're tier 1. But, a majority of the time, people need IT-Grunts to answer their questions, not IT-Shamans. That's what WoW GM's are; IT-Grunts. 
---
Lastly... yeah, you can't post a custom response to every single thread you respond to. You have to keep responses on larger scale issues consistent, because there are probably tickets he can ACTUALLY help with, rather than one he knows the devs are working to fix. Instead of using a proper macro for a known issue, the GM probably just copy/pasted it from someone he'd sent it to previously. I've done that myself, and while it's embarrassing, I don't think anything here shows anything less than industry standard best practices, besides NOT using a proper macro. 
---
Just a thought, from a Grunt. Zug-Zug.
---
It is, my fury/prot alt kicks the shit out of my hunter main.
---
if they dont fix this before my gametime expires i most likely not renew. game is unplayable when lagg hits. also the silence arround it by blizzard doesnt proof to be any good for a perma fix soon.
---
actually i discovered this for a super practical reason, but yeah this isn't something who doesn't like to explore is going to do
---
I don't know who Howard Stern is, but pretty much. I don't hate him tho, he's funny to watch sometimes. But he's often wrong and never wants to admit it.
---
Depends on how many locks are in your raid. Crit gives you 14sp equivalent to your davamge but no one calculates how much extra damage your raid gets. Imo arena bracers &gt; shadow wrath and felheart gloves &gt; felcloth unless you are a loner and one of two locks in the raid.
---
Yeah it’s pathetic but whatever. Not my life to piss away.
---
We're in the brief window before WSG is out. It was there for most of vanilla, and will be here for most of classic.
---
And in a battleground that's entirely about group movement, the side with frost shock and earthbind totem has a notable advantage.
---
95g here. I'd buy a bunch if I were you.
---
Trying to figure out the "reck bomb" mechanic. I know to make the start/stop macro but cant figure out how to get crits. It sounds like if you sit and then stand as the enemy hits you get the crit. Is this accurate?
---
I really feel like when people follow leveling guides, not only do they ruin their experience but I have noticed EVERYONE that has followed a leveling guide either doesn’t play anymore, or are too bored to get on and grind dungeons. Why can’t people sit down and figure out some quests on their own? All the AoE mages missing out on the GAME while they mindlessly farm away until 60, it isn’t fun.
---
He just keeps them coming boys!!! He’s on fire!!!
---
Imagine rolling on a pvp server and complaining about it
---
No mage food or portals for you then.
---
Westfall player here, last time I checked ours was about 3-5 aswell. Rip my only money making
---
I have a PvE character I go to occasionally for reprieve. I also have lower level alts on the PvP server. But damn if I don't wanna get my main to 60. I'm so close! But I'm just going to have to wait until BGs come out. WPVP right now is just too crazy.
---
Wowhead seemed to be more accurate than questie.
---
They seem to do ok til pshero finds them not in a group.
---
Try being Alliance, in all the zones I've seen after Phase two I refuse to reenter STV, HELL NO! The place was hell when I first entered for Phase one
---
Always looked as if he was serving in a game of tennis to me.
---
You can. Stramers have commented that someone that’s never been to their stream have received gift subs and been like “I have no clue who you are, but I’ll be sure to check it out now”. The streamers checked and the guy had never been there before.
---
...hellfire? what, the whelps? we don't have anyone but warriors on whelps.
---
Yeah, just spamming LFG isn't really how I wanted to spend my free time. Was hoping to knock out some quests. But that ain't happening now! haha
---
Arena bracers superior imo, id rather increase the damage overall of my 4 other locks and shadow priest than a little extra damage for myself.
---
I'll bite, what's your /played? How did you do the arena farming?
---
Low key I kinda wanna transfer here, sounds better than running around searing gorge looking for ally for 30 minutes
---
yeah I don’t waste my time getting some fabled “BiS” that has an extremely low drop rate, just do what you want to do you don’t need a gear list to play the game
---
everyone: /#nochanges
---
also everyone: /\*gets to [Shatt](https://www.wowhead.com/quest=10211/city-of-light)/\* okay #1change
---
I disagree with most here.  I used it up to BRD and it procs constantly for 60 damage.  It's nearly guaranteed to proc once a pull.  It did like 5% of my damage in ZF tanking.  This was back when I could make a stack for 1.5g.  1g each is too expensive and oil powershot macro is better at 50+.   I also run with all the on use aoe trinkets that swap on cooldown.   Thunderbrew, ST poison one, ramstein lightning bolt, ect.   Very useful and entertaining.
---
Not sure what your expectations were picking a PVP server.  When they announced P2 was starting the 12th I think everyone had a pretty good feeling that anyone that wasn't 60 by then was going to been boned.  I know its not constructive advice, but I don't know why you are shocked by this.
---
You think horde imbalance is bad now? Now when horde get op blood elves, pallys etc. Maybe as well be world of horde craft.
---
As someone who played tbc private servers horde are totally dominant on nearly every server due to the op horde racials,blood elves etc
---
Killing thousands and all you get is a sweet hat.
---
Worth it.
---
My friends find the macros cringey but I have had some people like them haha. The soulstone macro is especially useful just to let everyone know.
---
How much quicker do you level if a lvl60 boosts you through dungeons e.i. deadmines/gnomeregan/sm/etc
---
Well it’s not the end of classic yet so you’re lying. Or you meant Vanilla and since you can’t reference the correct name I’m assuming you’re lying.
---
ZF graveyard farm. Mages just kite them in a circle and can solo them from ~44. Have a friend doing it from 44-50
---
nice! i didnt get a dps meter til i was almost 60. destruction is a horrible leveling spec outside of dungeons.
---
drain life does not require you to be anything. you can level in greens with no sp/shadow damage. its just that drain spec leveling benefits greatly from getting sp/shadow dam because it not only increases damage but you'll heal for more and lifetap gets affected by sp/shadow dam so your lifetaps will be bigger, which is important, along with the 20% talent bonus. 
---
also, it really isn't hard or expensive at all to get sp/shadow damage gear while leveling. you don't get a lot til 40s or so but even before theres a few easy pieces to get, and shadoweave set full set shouldn't cost you more than what, 10-15g? and it can last you to 60 if you want it to.
---
BINGO!!!
---
And those years are full of either mojo or hair!
---
I agree with your preconception about SL being boring and slow. I didn't try it at first for this very reason. But I've been switching over the last few weeks, and it certainly has its benefits, though it's not always straight up better than SM/Ruin.
---
If you do have a friend healing you in a duo or small group, SM/Ruin is your clear choice, hands down. The raw damage output you have is truly insane. Even if you do not have a healer, I would suggest trying SM/Ruin in PvP before going straight to SL. The additional range on your spells is seriously nothing to scoff at, especially when you can play the front lines well and keep things constantly ticking.
---
With decent gear your shadowburn crits hit for 1500+; this is on top of your constantly ticking dots, potential for nightfall procs dealing 900
---
Damn what happened to the Power of the Horde?
---
The client is technically patched when hotfixes are implemented. It’s why you’ll random download ultra small packets when you open battle.net.  But those aren’t considered true patches, as those take larger download and require maintenance to implement.
---
seems like it started working like 10 min after ur post lol
---
I definitely expected WPVP to ratchet up quite a bit. What I didn't expect were kill squads of 60s roaming around killing literally everyone, no matter what. I couldn't even spirit rez and hearth out because they're also hanging out at the GY.  
---
Getting ganked on the regular is one thing. Not being about to do more then die and corpse run the moment you land in Un'Goro or Searing Gorge is a whole different situation.
---
Dude. I was thinking the same thing. Or maybe he’s trolling us. Luring us to their server?
---
Definitely fun lvling with wpvp.im scared to go to hillsbrad on my 31 alt but I'm sure once I make it up to the ogre mountains I'll only get ganked q few times an hour lol.
---
It feels weird leveling without a pvp trinket, just got mine on my main and it's time for my alt too
---
Hope they ban the guy that took it. Played it off like he didn’t just buy gold lul
---
Stuck in low 50s with 2 friends. We all quit.
---
I am on Heartseeker and it is so badly imbalanced that many horde are already quitting
---
You can use those bandages with no pre-requisite of having trained 225 first aid. You only need 225 first aid to make them.
---
Wrong.  Alliance is more organized than horde on many servers and typically goes around ganking levelers and solo farmers in groups of 10.  Probably because solo 8 out of 10 ally are garbage at pvp.
---
The power of 80/20 population balance.
---
As warrior u can do a route through Mara collecting ghost mushrooms and a bit of blindweed starting at purple ending near the goblin mini boss, depending on how geared you are and ur spec I was able to solo him with recklessness and baron trinket (fury) it’s about 30g an hr
---
Play grobbulus. Balanced faction pop, plenty of good pvp/pve guilds and RP content if you're into it, if not that's cool too.
---
Funny thing is most of the warriors I've seen roll a mage end up sucking at mage.
---
It's super annoying they are not answering to these bugs, I mean Firemaw is already in massive disbalance in faction ratio % and on top of that now I gotta strugle with chat not working, Blizzard really showing that they don't care.
---
Except you can't rank without people on your faction giving bracket slots unfortunately.
---
Yeah I'd buy at least 150 at that price holy shit
---
Not sure if I can be much help as after I hopped servers away from Stalagg I'm currently guildless. Just find a guild in Trade that looks like they're pretty well established and seem personable enough. Don't be afraid to join a guild, be in chat a couple days, and decide you don't like it and /gquit. Nothing wrong in my mind with that.
---
should add the argument about how stoneform and escape artist are better than hardiness and wotf
---
[me smart me mage](https://i.imgur.com/RJMqjoW.jpg)

I deleted my original as I didnt like the wording.
---
Personally, I think Vael will be significantly easier than classic originally.  My first time around in Classic, my guild killed rag maybe twice pre-submerge and wiped on Vael for 5+ weeks before getting him down.  This time around, I've only ever killed rag pre-submerge, so I think Vael is also going to be significantly easier.
---
&gt; Blizzard still produced Classic to generate revenue
---
...They're a business. Businesses exist to make money. EVERYTHING they do is "to generate revenue".
---
But that’s not calculating the increased raid damage if you have other locks and a spriest. Eye &gt; all until you have 100% uptime of imp shadowbolt which won’t happen till AQ gear.
---
Funny enough this is what its like for both mages and warriors.  Hunters/locks on the other hand usually have at least half the loot competition.
---
Yea. All these people saying “oh what did you expect?”  Show me ONE MOTHER FER who predicted this. NO ONE predicted this shit storm. They said it would get bad. Plenty of those posts. NO ONE predicted this bad. 
---
Now I could be wrong. If I am provide PROOF. Link an old post I missed. I’ll admit I was wrong if u do.
---
Yeah, I get that. I hope that when BGs are added on the 10th the Deathball meta will die down, but I am not sure if that will be enough. Until then your only option is probably finding an off the beaten path spot to just grind mobs for XP, or chain running dungeons.
---
Considering these macros spam at faster than human speeds, it can be detected. The macro essentially simulates one press, one action. But it’s not a sustainable human action (no matter how good you are, you can’t sustain 10s of presses per second for very long), and that can get you flagged. Had a priest in WoD that use these, which we could tell as when he typed it repeated letters a lot, and he was flagged and received a very long suspension.
---
Ashenvale, Darkshire, Menethil, Shimmering flats
---
2.5-3.5g each, about a 15% drop chance. A full group would quickly run out of mobs and be waiting on spawns. I can solo them as a rogue and stay busy, just adding one person means we clear them all and have to wait on each cycle.
---
Make sure the healer knows if you are going to do this. Having a Priest buddy for shield helps a lot.
---
That sucks. Kinda glad i rerolled on 3 different realms before i found a 50/50 one. Ashbringer if you're interested
---
wont I be missing points in improved curse of Agony?
---
and should I not get dark pact?
---
we weren't really talking about group battles at all so I assumed you meant solo, but yeah if your goal is to only support in groups then yeah druid is probably not for you
---
lolol Finkster hopped into our discord right after this happened to let us all know about it.
---
Happy birthday ~ Gnomu
---
It’s not speculation at all. For you to even imagine that it might not happen on both sides, you’d have to be delusional enough to think there’s something fundamentally different between people that choose to play on alliance vs horde. The reality is, there is not.
---
I also think people who don't see it as that bad are one of the following:  
---
- Already 60, so they aren't trying to level in this shit.  
---
- No where near 60, so they aren't trying to level in this shit.  
---
- On a PvE server.  
---
- On a PvP server where they are part of the majority faction.
---
Dark Iron Gear can only be crafted at the Black Anvil
---
All of the T2 sets looked like level 20 greens as well, until they got updated with new models.
---
You can kill all the solo mobs in the front area of tyrs. The clerics, sorcerrors, and the paladins. Make sure to pummel their heals/arcane missiles. If your pummel is on CD you can backup and intercept to interrupt another cast.
---
Run instances. Felwood is manageable. Find a cave and grind.
---
well it's a good thing most of the shit that's actually worth your time in terms of character progression is tied to being in groups.
---
and warriors shine the brightest in group content.
---
meanwhile op is mad about mages being able to solo farm zf.
---
But for PVE (2H fury) you probably don't have Axe spec 5% crit though.
---
No they didn't, that's you putting words in their mouths.
---
They drop very often (maybe 40ish %?) BUT they drop for everyone in the group when they do drop.
---
Watch out man youre gonna trigger all the horde!
---
Spamming LFG as we speak. ZF anyone? :P  
---
Happy cake day, btw!
---
There's nothing to discuss. It's the obvious thing and unless if blizzard decides to want to start a new MMO game (meaning death of retail) using classic+ as the example, there's no way they WON'T do TBC.
---
I think its a really stupid idea.
---
Every warrior wants a 2 hander for pvp and they are very rare.
---
Frankly, other 2 handers are not that much better than hand of rag. You shouldnt steal every 2 hander for minor upgrades. Your just going to piss off every other warrior and pally, and for good reason.
---
Dual Wiekd is BiS. You dont just steal all the good pvp loot because you refuse to use the bis gear and compete with other warriors. Its just bullshit.
---
Like you already got hand of rag. You dont get to even look at another 2hander til every warrior has one. Thats how it works.
---
Why did you take hand of rag in the first place?
---
Very soloable as a pre bis warrior
---
Crying about faction imbalance when you chose to transfer lul

No it's not at all, collectable items and showing off your hard earned items are a big part of the game - which is why transmog also sucks.
---
You forgot one: Horde. Lul
---
draft dodgers
---
I mean he didn't, so that would be stupid
---
Yeah taladrils is focused purely on mitigation, so take it for what it is. 
---
My advice is to have a few pieces you swap between depending on content. I have mask of the undying and bone ring helm, for example, which I swap between depending on the fight. If it's a hard hitting fight where you are at serious risk of dying to burst, you go with mitigation. If it's simple 5mans or raid content your guilds got down, go with %hit gear because missing mauls and losing aggro is more dangerous than dying. For the same reason I use blademaster leggings from UBRS over warstrifes from BRD 90% of the time, because 1% hit makes a much more noticable difference than 12 stamina.
---
So why not put it as cosmetic items and things like that? Like with bloodsail? You don't need achievements to motivate that.
---
Don’t be so mad sweaty
---
I def think rng was higher in the first few weeks. Prob got fixed at some point. I was mining 1 arcane abt every 5-6 RTV nodes and now its like 1-30. A guildy of mine got 100 mined in the first two weeks
---
Tried on human and gnome, didn't work either. Maybe I suck at jumping though.
---
Heaven forbid a Horde player can make fun of the Alliance on a subreddit littered with Anti Horde propaganda, right?
---
&gt; How many teenagers do you think play this 15 year old game?
---
More than played it 15 years ago, actually.
---
The story was 3 bosses and gone, and I’ve seen Garr+ advertised almost weekly.
---
Hit 'em with the double ban hammer
---
Check out this video of a mage soloing the entire dungeon for jump runs.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3rJwjTSlBo
---
Essentially get final boss to 50%, stand in corner, invis pot or engineering invis trinket to drop combat and you're free to loot the nodes.
---
If you're looking to kill the last boss, you'll have to jump on the ledge like in this video, have the druid taunt the boss and have him jump on the ledge while you kill the imps, once the imps are dead, have druid run to the tunnel with you and you should be able to burst the boss down at this point.

---
Why do so many people talk about TBC like it is something that exists?
---
Naw, OP is just a bundle of sticks. Rest of the sub is still cool.
---
Yeah, I feel like we are arguing the same point more or less. My comment was more pointing out that Classic isn't as monetized as Blizzards other offerings, and yes fan outcry played a significant factor, but like you said, Blizzard ultimately developed Classic because it would generate revenue.
---
Grind, don’t quest.  Grind instances if you can, or find a small cave in the middle of nowhere and grind until your bags are completely full.  Make sure you have runecloth bags at minimum.
---
If you’re having trouble clipping the wall go into your settings and set your max frame rate to as low as it can and you literally just get stuck on everything and makes it super easy.
---
Sure, but that doesn't warrant insulting and disrespecting people either. The culture over on the Fight Club discord seems pretty immature to me.
---
Using weights? What do you mean?
---
Sell UBRS gear. A good 5 man can clear up to Rend. Have the other 5 slots filled with people buying gear. You can master loot every unbought drop to your enchanter and split all the profit. 
---
IDK what the demand for UBRS gear is these days, but a month or 2 ago that was probably the best way in the game to farm gold.
---
&gt; rescinded
---
Indeed I do! Thx!

Transfer to low pop

Did you really not know this was going to be the case for pvp servers? Every youtuber, twitch streamer, forum poster, reddit user was talking about how much of a blood bath P2 was going to be and that you better hit 60 before it drops... I don’t see how this could come as a suprise

sounds like alliance on my server :(
---
&gt; No it's not at all, collectable achievements and showing off your hard earned titles are a big part of the game
---
Theres no way this cognitive disonance is real, you have to be trolling
---
Why? Horde competes with other Horde players on the realm. Queue could be 3 hours Alliance could earn 10x as much honor but none of that would matter.
---
Actually posted this on reddit instead of just asking in general or guild???  Seems like a lot of work.
---
After years and years of having PvP server players call me "carebear" for playing on PvE servers, it's very hilarious seeing them whine and cry about world PvP.
---
Imp CoA is such a tiny improvement, once you learn when to use it CoEx is fantastic in PvP. 
---
Dark Pact is way worse than Ruin for anything other than leveling.
---
I rerolled pve and it is fairly active. I don't think if it is other rerollers though.

Ah yes, because Blizzard openly displays the population of each server.

Fight Club is one of the more egregious class discords in how they react to the repetitive basic questions. They’ll *immediately* ban or mute you for an indeterminable amount of time. No other class discord is or has ever been that remorseless and extreme, in Classic or retail.
---
Ahaha man you gotta let them have their QQ. vanilla wasn't designed to be fair and they got the short end of the stick in pvp and pve. I'd be salty too if I picked the wrong faction and leveled to 60
---
~70g on Earthshaker (H). Medium to High pop server.

I am getting old.

We have done some shaman, priest, mage, rogue and warrior. Works great
---
Unfortunately for you I’m ally, I was 49 when phase 2 hit and only got up to 53 in Faerlina. The circumstances there to have a playable and fun experience went all down the drain after p2 hit. I just can’t level consistently on the open world being outnumbered and outleveld, and the current dungeon meta meant  BRD arena runs (which was pure cancer just to get to BRM) or MARA/ST (which I could barely find a group on LFG).
---
There's a massive XP penalty when there is someone far beyond your level in the group. I can't see it being any quicker than just actual dungeon farming. Otherwise people would level alts a lot more often.
---
That’s the highest value I’ve seen anyone assign to crit. Either way, 9+14 &lt; 33, so felcloth gloves are still better for raiding
---
nightfall conflag, u lose 10% dmg from shadow mastery who cares sm ruin is very bad in pvp
---
LOL
---
Did you just hit BINGO?
---
Forgot to say, I'm EU.
---
You’re mad
---
says the elite pvper as he types this out in his main city.
---
Right? Fuck them for adding a word that people used, because prior it was incorrect. Not like language is completely fucking arbitrary and you know what people mean when they say irregardless, right?
---
I have a regular dungeon smashing group in my guild. We pretty much just alternative between scholo and strat live. Really good money, especially since our clear times keep going down as we do it more.
---
Imp COA really sucks, it's based on the base spell so it wont scale with spell power, and you may not often get full duration of COA anyway (and coa does more dmg towards the end of the duration).
---
If you are lvling, get DP for sure, otherwise nah.  It also doesn't scale, and ends up sucking.  With my gear lifetap is nearly 900 mana in one gcd, dark pact caps at something like 200 or 250 from memory, it's really bad (plus, and more importantly, it prevents you from picking up ruin which is way more valuable).
---

---
even though there is no classic version, this one still works for me at least.
---
Wait, why are you killing 8 lashers? I assumed you meant the lashers in packs of 4 for the last boss...
---
Your logic is flawed, SGC is BiS for tanks going full threat set. Obviously the only people who NEED full threat are guilds pushing sub 45 minute MC. 
---
Also 1% extra threat is huge if it's coming off of 1 item.
---
Yes you need to sit and then stand right before the enemy hits you to get the proc.
---
They mean 9% on your character sheet. You are correct that Rogues get a lot of it from talents.
---
The 9% cap is just for yellow hits (abilities) as well. You will still see benefit in the 11-13% range at which point you should focus on crit.
---
Yeh, it's IQ is below average thats for sure.
---
Only that everyone was a lot worse, but they still completed Naxx.
---
Flasks are going to be huge once we get into BWL+.  Even if the content is relatively easy, you're still going to shave a ton of time on your raid nights.
---
Level a mage.
---
I doubt it picks up single trades.
---
lock them on frost and roll them in a coil while they cant block
---
no. The beginning lashers. They drop BoE epics, random flowers, and good trash loot.
---
because wowhead and iceveins is garbage.
---
But transmogging literally allows you to show your hard work on top of your gear. Why is that a bad thing?
---
Thank you for the input!
---
I feel devildaur is lacking too much in mitigation so I'll probably go for more git chance elsewhere. But I agree with the rest.
---
the mobs are 43-44 not 45-46
---
I ran out of salt for my turkey brine and found this post as an appropriate substitute.
---
Not really relevant at all, but okay.
---
Most important thing ever. I will choose casters by their casting animations and melee characters by the way the hold weapons between attacks and their swing animations. This means undead for casters and orc for melee in horde, Night elf female for melee and male gnome for casters.
---
LMAO this is gold
---
My point is that Blizzard could have been much more explicit in their monetization of Classic. They could have (and for all we know still might) implemented paid transfers, Paid race/faction changes, a subscription that was independent of retail WoW. "Cash grab" has connotations of being scummy/underhanded.  So for that reason I don't think cash grab is valid label.
---
And doggo form.
---
bruh why you gotta do my man Sunken Temple like that
---
Exactly. With our guild there is no waiting for threat or sunders so it's going ham as soon as we pull the boss. If I miss a maul or swipe (happens with parry/dodge but that can't be helped) then dps start dying.
---
You can for 2 more weeks, but nobody will like you. And after 2 weeks server balance won't matter anyway.
---
You can do strat live with 4.
---
We’ve known of mage capabilities for 15 years. We’ve also known that warriors have a rougher time than most with multiple mobs while leveling. If this is an issue, either re-roll or shut the fuck up. You picked the wrong class despite a bevy of knowledge at your disposal.
---
Gametime benefits will apply to both (same subscription), other benefits are not available in Classic.
---
It isn't really intended to be the place where you ask basic questions like "Should I use this axe or mirah's song ?"
---
It's intended to be a place for theorycrafting discussion and advancing our knowledge of the game.
---
Lately, its been flooded by a bunch of noobies who ask very basic questions 24/7. Having to answer the same questions over and over again is drowning out the interesting discussions people used to have there, and they are becoming jaded about it.
---
They made tons of FAQs to address this problem, but people continually refuse to read the FAQs and instead just post some basic question over and over and over again. Most questions are answered just by searching it on the discord, or even by scrolling up a bit and reading.
---
It doesn't help that the people asking these basic questions have near 0 knowledge of the mechanics of the game. So even when you spoonfeed them the answer, they fail to understand because they just know so very little.  So you have to hold their hand and explain tons of mechanics for them.  Then when you finish, some other guy who didnt read all the stuff you literally JUST typed, comes in and asks the same question AGAIN. Its become impossible to satisfy the noobs coming in there. 
---
If you want to understand how to be the best warrior, do your own research. Don't show up at a discord and expect people to spoonfeed every answer to your question like this is a personal info session where all the best players serve you. You are just one of a million noobs who show up every day asking the same things.

Going from Hextech to that sucks
---
If it costs over 1g for each Chilli, save it for high end raid content or PVP where it might make a difference. Dungeons and low level raid content is so easy you won't need it.
---
Did ST last night on my lvl 50 and got about 1/2 a lvl in one run.
---
This is why I stacked up on arcane crystals at 20g and got my lionheart a few hours after the recipe dropped for someone on our server.
---
How would you fix it?
---
Can I get a boomer version of this
---
It's mostly just useful for quick quest completion not the XP from mobs itself
---
It's pretty relevant, I wouldn't want someone who doesn't know better focusing on the wrong place.
---
You could do both, but it wouldn't be worth the time spent.
---
R N G. U can run a dungeon as often as you like. Fact is it might only drop that same mace every single time. Forever. Now it's VERY unlikley. But truth is rng is a bitch. 
---
Run brd for HoJ all day n night. Fail. Switch to ur caster, see it drop every time u dps/heal. 
---
It's jist how it seems to be sometimes. I got eye of flame (be epic) while farming the very few mobs u have to kill to solo angerforge. I also got other items luckily ir easily. Just not what I want or need lol.
---
Hunter is a mod of his channel and quit playing.
---
lole
---
Lashers by themselves if you’re resetting will net you 30g per hour.
---
You need people on your faction to actually get +15 hks in order to qualify in the bracketpool. The more people in pool the more slots for the higher brackets. You literally cannot get r14 on a super low pop server, due to bracketsize.
---
I didn't see a proper response here, the buff bar is bugged, tooltip is correct. They will get the 55 stam even if it only says 43. And another priest buffing the same level fort will drop their health bar as if a new for is being applied, even though its the same level.
---
My guild is #2 on my server, nobody says anything, people get summoned and we're done ony without problems. You can get summoned while you're entering the mage port, and they can start pulling the 3 trash mobs before ony. You'll literally be back before they kill 1 trash mob. There is no time wasted.
---
Your raid leader is an idiot and wasting time yelling on such *difficult* content.
---
If horde complain about alliance being pussies so much, why dont they come to earth fury where horde slightly outnumber alliance, but get their dicks stomped on, on a daily basis
---
The best way to counter this is to (with a priest) stand just under the roof of the inn so that someone only at the very edge can hit you. Wait for someone to get to the edge then mind control em off the roof. Run them over past the bank as far as the mc range will allow. If you do it just right then they need to die twice to be within res distance. Hopefully you can get more than one at a time.
---
I played this same way too. Definitely worth it.
---
My friend who had played during early vanilla and once on a private server (so he knew was he was doing for the most part but still didn’t understand ALOT of the game). We were leveling together and every time he’d be like “Let’s do “X” dungeon!” 9/10 I’d respond with we are too low for that (I was a tank after all). And once we’d finally run something he’d be like “this is freakin easy, we must be over leveled”.... Nah man we are juuusst right. I don’t wanna waste my time doing 2 hour ZF runs just to get some gear 1-2 levels earlier when you can easily blast thru it in less than an hour otherwise
---
1v1s are a massive meme tho and u legit win every 1v1 anyway except vs other locks with deep destro and it smashes 3-5 skirmishes
---
Lmao same exactly. My druid has been hated by them ever since hahaha.
---
the quicker you move, the more you avoid mechanics that kill you, the quicker you can get back to pew pew.
---
Basically you put a multiplier on a stat to give it a weight to better compare them against each other. For example for mitigation how do you answer the question when 3 different items one gives you +15 Stam, another 100 armor and another 1% dodge. Which is better overall? A Shortcut to try and answer this question is adding a multiplier to each stat, letting you have 1 number to compare all 3 against.
---
If you go to the link below to the stats value tab you will see the multiplier Tala gave each stat to compare them against each other

---
That's a great way to lose. Pros will sheep you and kill you last.
---
Some server just have people that tank economies. It’s an use of the retail Area 52 server. Things will start out decently priced, then get tanked HARD. Mounts went from 50k gold average for months, then some people come through and tank the average down to 10k, and it never bounces back.
---
\#nochanges
---
I went to a few grind spot in Felwood, then WPL, then Winterspring and I'm still getting killed 3-4 times every 20 mins.
---
Take all the quests and have them help you get them all done in one run.
---
Groups usually either don't do all quests or they compete too much over items and end up needing multiple runs to finish the quests.
---
The booster penalty is high, but not high enough to make a boost meaningless.
---
Not in a multi db server environment they aren’t. That’s when incremental id’s give collisions.
---
Too bad, would have been funny to make all the mages wear a clown nose on their foreheads
---
That’s what I’d like to think too but I don’t know. Even just a new couple zones with the same mechanics feels like would become stale. It’s why they nuked Azeroth in cataclysm. They didn’t want people redoing the same leveling process over and over again.
---
I used to play Boss Cleave Roulette on when I would be tanking farm content with my guild. I'd do this and just run the boss in circles and the when the boss would attack he'd cleave into the melee and kill 1 or 2. It was the healer's problem to deal with it. Everyone loved it.
---
Nothing will happen.
---
&gt;DPS can't get enough gear to beat an 8/8 Might Warrior in threat at the moment
---
Man, having Blessing of Salvation must be nice.
---
STV on sulfuras was wild a month or so ago. Funny how quick things change.
---
And what makes you say that?
---
But.. You guys are just.. Horrible? I mean horde are just the bad guys, so it makes sense that all the bad people play horde.
---
What is there to discuss?
---
For sure, it's impossible to know absolutely until it's released.  But just judging by the improvement in DPS, I dont think an instance that had multiple "DPS Check" fights is going to be nearly as challenging.
---
Of course it's possible the entire place is buggy as hell or was stealth buffed, who knows.  I still think Nefarian will be a difficult fight and maybe Chromag, but I dont see how any guild could wipe much on the first 6 bosses.
---
Trying to get a brd group at 50 ugh
---
Ideally plate dps gear otherwise shield bash generates more threat, better info is on the fight club discord.
---
No you can’t.
---
I feel attacked
---
There is a "Warrior Classic" Discord. The people there are a lot nicer and easier to get along with than fight club.  
---
The issue is that they also are way less knowledgeable. Even the mods there frequently give out faulty/flat out incorrect information. Seems like the mods allow lots of poor answers through because they don't actually know better themselves. Someone going for help there probably just gets shitty info.
---
\&gt; There is no difference between the people on either side
---
I just don't think that's correct tbh, there has always been a relatively clear difference.
---
Even still, I'd say the newer generation of horde players are very different from the old one back in actual vanilla, far more prone to this type of behavior than back then. I suppose under that context, you'd have to assume the newer generation of alliance players are also different. 
---
You could very much be right, but the reality is we will never really know for sure. Heartseeker is an outlier, and not even a very good one since it is populated by alliance players trying to escape constant corpse-camping, so of course they are going to be more likely to return the favor.
---
In the end, since we likely won't see majority alliance dominated pvp servers again, all we can do is speculate.
---
Most humanoids will swim after you, the unlike many beasts. Pirates are fast swimmers in addition to that.
---
This is a pretty close alliance:horde ratio on Arcanite "The Dad Server" Reaper.
---
We have loads of alliance who transferred from the slaughterhouses Whitemane and Fairbanks, so they relentlessly destroy us horde (composed of the dads/9-5ers who couldn't sit in queue for hours).
---
I'm willing to bet the other "free transfer" servers are similar. A probable (but regretful) alternative if it's available.
---
Lol dude, 90% of the horde are terrible but run in numbers. You guys are screwed when BGs drop. Atleast vs my premade you are.
---
Yeah I just stopped playing as much. If it was more balanced I would definitely enjoy it more but its multiple raid sized groups just deleting you

---
I hear horde feeling great on zandalar tribe hehe
---
I think the dilemma here is that yes, you're physically spinning the mousewheel, but it will spin for quite some time by that 1 action, and if you use the repeating program you also have to do that 1 action to make it click many times
---
Exhibit D
---
Yeah, that would be the likely outcome.
---
&gt;but your tier is excellent for resto at least
---
Yeah, in PvP. In raids it's trash.  
---
Mages at least have insane 8/8 t2 bonus.
---
The quest XP for running them one is crazy and definitely worth doing.
---
Keep making up excuses, can't wait to see what your excuses will be when you guys are losing most bgs.
---
Lmao bro take an upvote
---
Ah my bad yeah you can’t lol.
---
&gt;  Only the gloves and maybe the belt are decently itemized for threat
---
Pauldrons are OK too.
---
If it were a guildie, the warrior definitely should've taken it first. But with a PUG, loot should always be as per the loot rules.
---
This gameplay mechanic is more than 10 years old: my point is everyone playing classic should be ready to embrace everything from it, every flaw or imbalance included.
---
The unfortunate part is by wearing the whole set your way off BiS
---
Using the bend halfway up the tunnel? Ya that would work
---
Imo the optimal group is minimum 30 if u want to full clear. That last hallway to final boss is extremely tough for sub 30s. I remember I tanked it on my twinned our Druid at 29 and it was disheartening. I had like 2k hp or something rediculous and it was very hard. Dps not killing the bombs is a whole other story. They hit like trucks.
---
Why do you say that?
---
Yeah it must be the mages that are the best dps and tank for end-game. /s
---
Other way around in my experience
---
I'm fury. I OT.
---
I have 5 set t1 and 2 set of t2. I have an epic shield and a bunch of other valuable tank gear.
---
Meanwhile I'm still using blue weapons and hardly any of my MS Fury gear has dropped and the stuff that has dropped went to players who have been raiding as Arms the last few weeks  because "it's too expensive to respect every week".
---
I am a little salty.
---
I just did the math in another thread, but even without Salv: you only need 385 threat per second to hold aggro over a 500 DPS Mage or Warlock.
---
Sunder Armor spam alone is 252 TPS. Auto attacks (which generate 1.495 threat per point of damage) only need to deal ~90 DPS to cover the difference. And then there is Heroic Strike, Shield Slam, Revenge on top of that...
---
Threat issues will become real for Horde in BWL and beyond. But in current content? Hell no.
---
Thanks a lot, that answers all follow up questions as well
---
Rerolled too. Not looking back.
---
If it was a dungeon though that’s not really true. Unless it relied on selling boe epics or something
---
Hey is the ppm for the 8/8 procrate as bad as people say?   I heard its 1ppm.  Can you confirm?
---
Take all the horde from my server please!
---
Blizzard really needs to start facilitating this now!
---
g O ba Ck T o Re Tail

---
No, paladins have a much better secondary option in aurastone hammer, while staff of dominance is not nearly as good.
---
No good guild will give mageblade to a paladin.
---
Good luck getting through BRM, though.
---
for decurses :\^)
---
How am I a scumbag? I’m not the one camping BRM I’m dying right alongside y’all. Sorry if I hurt your feelings by saying dying 14 times is an exaggeration.
---
I am sure their current expectations of BGs are quite different from what they will eventually face. Just like some people weren't expecting being farmed as honor livestock everywhere they go, their own capitals included, while it was the reality predicted by others.
---
Seems kinda silly. I’m sure most epics vendor for more than 5g

---
My prediction is that any guild that clears MC under 2.5h (which is basically every guild) wipes for like a week or two max and enters farm mode after that.
---
Yeah thats my strat. Usually gets me a 95+ parse and top caster DPS or top 3 at worst. It is still scuffed though and god forbid you wipe you ain't getting another SS lol.
---
Ok good rebuttal, you should submit it to a peer reviewed economics journal.
---
“I am very badly injured!”
---
ITT, no Horde players from other servers saying that OP is a crybaby. Where are those Horde players now??
---
&gt;until you have a Might of Menethil
---
Bonereaver's Edge does the job just fine.
---
The thing here is that youre expecting everyone to have epic flying right from the start, but thats simply not the case. Many people didnt get epic flying for *months* because its 5k gold and nobody wanted to use the regular flying mount because its so pathetically slow, it was much faster to use an epic ground mount unless youre merely trying to traverse a cliff or something.  
---
BGs are going to definitely kill wpvp, its going to pretty much revert it to what it was prior to honor release where you have a few scuffles here and there. Im not saying itll kill hotspots, you'd have to be a fool to think that.
---
Rogues can do just as competitive dps if you look at logs, the reason warriors have all the rank 1s are because of recklessness cheese.
---
Both are godly but the way I look at it-
---
Solo- Rogue
---
Group- Warrior
---
Yep, swapping manually!
---
The 5% dmg Over SM ruin isn’t worth the lost utility, I plan to swap over to DS ruin only come BWL.

&gt; Half of this subreddit is alliance crying about pvp 
---
The other half is horde crying about pvp.
---
The richest player is probably a guild bank.
---
Lol i cant wait to smack your scum face in battlegrounds.
---
Its funny because I'm in a pvp server dominated by Allies.
---
First of, you cant, and second of even if youre in a duel with someone, it wont remove honorless.
---
The thing with fury warrior is that 80% of your bis gear in this phase in non raid loot so its really jst weapons u are going after which are in high demand from rogues as well. Find a loot council guild and come prepared, top meters and be rewarded
---
You gotta' get from the flight master into the instance, though. Takes 60-90 mins extra, depending on how many times you have to replace group members that give up on getting there.
---
Forgot what the issue was and who hated it
---
Hot take.  BGs will run within a few % of 50/50 for the  vast majority of both factions, except for those that run exclusively in premades.
---
100% this.  Don't be afraid to pop a shield on and go to town. You can tank literally every dungeon as arms or fury.
---
Tired of competing for your bis dps gear? Start a group as a tank and just oops all mages the dps lol.
---
I can't help but read this as a Always Sunny bit
---
Is that Pyrewood specifically?
---
Its more that its a much bigger upgrade for mages than for Pallies.

Nice bananas 10/10
---
on my realm its ~20-25g
---
I think it happens on both ends equally like in all games. Alliance just complain more for some unknown reason that no ones able to understand after 15 years
---
i like it
---
Um, have you been here? I've seen like 12 posts in the last few days of alliance crying about pvp. 0 from horde.
---
Typical RP server...
---
Funny doh

Why is that even relevant?

Nah this is Stalagg

I did full STV because I knew it gonna be he'll of a zone, when Horde has DIRECT Zeppelins from Orgrimmar and Undercity there. There were skirmishes at hunters camp, accasional ganking of lvl 40s patrolling the area, and even lvl 60 rogue who ganked low lvls at northern bridge, but now it is worse hundreds of times and I won't level alt there. SM take my alt and make him lvl 40.
---
I'd say a good horde premade will definitely win against alliance pug but will have a hard time against alliance WSG premade. The issue is, I hardly doubt alliance premade will visit WSG often while they have AV.
---
Dominance is beyond crap though. Mageblade alone has the same SP and crit so you're forfeiting 34 SP by using that shitty staff. Pre-bis alone is almost the same. Paladins can get the aurastone instead. The only upgrade from Mageblade is the staff of the shadowflame which has an insane competition because you're probably rocking 12+ caster dps at that point but only 3-4 paladins. Paladins get a better weapon in ZG of all places, a fucking 20-man. And even if you get the shadowflame it isn't actually that great compared to Mageblade + AV or Jindo's.
---
It's a great place, on a PVE server. You can always find someone to pvp with if you feel in the mood, or you can quest away to your hearts content. One of the best places to find world pvp happening at your own level, usually the cityraids tend to be 60s.
---
Does transmog stop people from wearing the current high end raid gear?
---
Id imagine blizz could sour on it because theres no readily accessible way to cancel totems. So they might decide that dismissing totems in this way is unintended.

After leveling a warrior I can tell you... you don’t.

why u roll pvp when you dont like to pvp?

Bro you need to relax lmao. Did I say you wouldn’t die going to Morgan’s vigil or did I say you would avoid the giant death funnel and have a less popular death funnel to deal with? People like you are why redditors are the butt of every joke, stay mad.
---
I don't think there's a single server with less than 170 players. And you won't be getting anywhere near R14 in 2 weeks anyway.
---
Staff of dominance is not good. With AV releasing in 2 resets, and with it the exalted off hands, even sorcerous dagger (which is considerably worse than aurastone hammer, btw), is better than it.
---
Mageblade is a mage/warlock item, volatile power is a warlock item, and MIC is a mage item in any guild that knows what they're doing.
---
Good. This is what horde deserve for camping ally FPs and boats
---
Are you kidding? End game druid tanking isn't just stam. You need strength, agi and dodge otherwise your threat generation is shit and you take a shitton of damage. Even for 5/10 mans. If you're wearing Cenarion when you're tanking you're doing your group a huge disservice lying to them that you can tank.

Thinking of changing up my talents a little bit (SM/Ruin ) Wanna take Suppression (Do i take all 5 for curses/corruption/etc help or do i only go for 3/5 there ?) Had a Lucifron resist me 5 curses in a row other day lol . And wanna take 4/5 CoeX for pvp perhaps . 
---
Thinking of what should i remove ,Imp Drain soul for one (as its only good for farming has no help in raiding/PvP) and thinking perhaps to cut imp CoA points .  Curse of Agony is rarely ever used in raids considering debuff slots and even then improved Curse buffs only basic damage no matter your spellpower so increase is really small right ? Did not test this. Even for pvp where you do use CoA the 6 % basic damage would be something small like 6 % of basic 1044 damage ?)
---
I was playing with a group of rl friends and never really had any problems running dungeons until gnomer. Mobs about the size of half the dungeon would get pulled wiping us. This happened like 7 times until we just called it off, I swore on that day that I'll never go back to that dungeon.
---
&gt;I wish you could rep in BRD.
---
You can! Both the Gnome Bartender and the Thorium Brotherhood guy in the Grim Guzzler can repair your gear :)
---
3 gnomes actually posed for this pic.
---
Probably not, but let's see if Classic will evolve into TBC and WotLK some day. Here's to hoping - I never really missed Classic, what I'm dying to relive is WotLK, where 99% of the Classic content is intact. I'll weep with joy if they upgrade Classic to WotLK some day.
---
And although the "normal" servers are called PvE servers in classic, they could probably be called casual servers.
---
A PvE server will probably be more enjoyable for many casual players.
---
Someone has no idea what a monopoly is, a gaming company buying another isn’t a monopoly 😂😂😂 anyone is free to create their own gaming company.
---
Druid tank is best threat generator until deep t3 (even fury/prot warrior with thunderfury+hungering cold has to work hard to out-threat a competent bear with MCP). Feral is also mage's and rogue's bane in PvP - they can't even run away.
---
You can't swap gear (except weapons)  in combat might be part of the issue, so it can't swap gear if you de-stealth because you attack someone.
---
  What are you trying to accomplish?  I'm assuming items that raise stealth level equipping and de-equipping?
---
Unless your guild is loot counseling gear to people that have pre-raid BiS...
---
Yup and that's why I moved from firemaw to ashbringer
---
Kk. I’m proven wrong. Someone did predict this. 231 days ago. Your still right but that’s something non of the casuals would have seen. Only the hardcore w.e. Vanilla tbc other acronym players would have seen this. Still your right. A person predicted this would happen. I guess it’s our fault for not scrolling through 231 d posts. My bad. Little bit of sarcasm there BUT you are still right it was predicted 231 days ago.
---
I’ve been using that cloak for a week or 2 but never actually checked to see what it looked like. Display cloak is getting turned on tonight
---
In my experience, there are basically unlimited raid spots for fury warrs.
---
Paladins are gods of support in organized PVP. Additionally, there are more alliance Druids than horde. I fully expect alliance to dominate WSG as a result. A Druid and Paladin tandem can double handedly win WSG matches in PUG games.
---
What interests me is that they seem to think everyone else is playing on a pvp server as well.
---
They haven’t been doing anything good with classic at all, Nostalrius for its problems was run much better than classic.
---
\&gt; and lots of loot.... Make a warrior   
---
Yeah, then you only compete with other warriors, rogues and hunters for gear. And a token cat.
---
That is because of the Horde having the higher population on most of the PVP servers.  On the few servers in which case the Alliance have the majority, its the same posts coming from the Horde.
---
The difference is that when enough of them transfer, the server they left and the server they go to are both improved.  We're not talking 10 or 20 people transferring, we're talking thousands.
---
Reading that irritated me, I would kick on site.
---
I have any alt rogue and evening prime time in Barrens chat is hopping with people for WC. It's much easier to find a group there I've found.

It’s fun because he’s a mage. As soon as he gets into ZF he gets to watch Disney+ and farm 10,000gold.
---
Warlock pets have lots of ability you can use and good thing is that you can change them up for  whatever situation you need.You need more dps ? Succubus. 
---
You need brief tank and shield when you aoe? Voildwalker + sacrifice. You need to stop casters/dispels magic cause no dispeler in group ? Felhunter. So they really offer unique playstyles.You would need to control them ,but you can also just put a imp out put him on passive and use him for his buffs.Let him damage sometimes for dps increase when you think he wont die to aoe
---
They need to force combine it with a horde dominated server.
---
yea but you can't say stuff like that on here, alliance would obviously behave totally different if they had advantageous numbers on most pvp servers.
---
How is rdcp inferior? Malstars has no +healing
---
Does it make sense that mage can one shot a raid geared warrior, with barely issuing any of its resources? No, no it does not.
---
I use the thornling shard to deal with the adds.
---
New players starting every day man. It won't be as easy to fill groups at launch, but you shouldn't have any problems.
---
&gt; having to roll against like 2 other tanks
---
GL finding tank spot in raid, lol.
---
No it isn't lol.  Alliance often control brm, routinely attack in zergs in winterspring / epl / wpl, and there are consistent groups of rogue/druids stealthed in org/kargath/feralas ganking.
---
Thats why they didn't pay Van Cleef
---
Dang. Hmmm. I really gotta think if that’s worth not corpse running. In a normal circumstance I’d say fuk no but during this I’m legit giving it thought.
---
Sounds like just about every other server right now except it's alliance getting fucked.
---
Lmao horde player complaining about pvp git gud
---
Dude I levelled my warrior only through dungeons from 20-60 and hit 60 like a month and a half ago. All you guys complaining about having to run dungeons from 50-60. Yes I agree phase 2 sucks but like use your brain and make it work, don’t just keep running out to quest and die over and over and then logon the next day and do it again. Jesús chripe
---
It's all about badlands now on sulfuras,  I'm a 41 mage fighting for my fuckung life
---
blew air out of my nose at the cougar bit
---
You say mages but i'm pretty sure AoE farming requires at least a little bit of finesse/skill when really you should be salty about Warlocks.   
---
Pre - 38 they have little downtime and TTK is pretty good. And also unkillable in pvp by similar levels unless the warlock is low hp/mana or unskilled.   
---
Post - 38 a warlock (still unkillable, just more unkillable, lol) thats drain tank build with succ (aka the best leveling spec by a mile) can infinitely pull a mob, kill/self heal with DoTs/drain life, and lifetap for mana. If you have ok-good gear you can do this forever, non stop. If you have good-great gear you can pull 2 mobs at once (within 2 levels or so, 3 you might have to bandage) and do this, forever.  For reference I didn't buy/use food or water til I was almost 60. Used some bandages but was more for speed and not need.   
---
Basically, drain tank build + if you have some shadow dam/SP allows you to heal more damage than you take, and imp lifetap +sp/shadow damage allows you to heal more than you are lifetapping, for a positive gain.   
---
Sure mages are probably faster by a bit because they can AoE down 20 mobs at once but a decent drain tank warlock should never have to eat/drink once if they do it right.
---
Why do people not fix their Windows?
---
this just sound like more self-consoling on your part, to be honest. hope ya cheer up soon bud, good luck out there!
---
Or you could be both because until raid content all you need to do is have a dedicated set for each role, because spec doesnt matter. Ye know, like someone who actually knows how to play a fecking warrior.
---
Okay, so how does it pick between 4 items of 25% drop chance if all of them win their rolls?
---
The difference though is that he sees fun as a zero sum game, his verbally stated goal isn't honor or anything, it's literally to grief the other faction on a large scale. 
---
It's a shame because I like a lot of the horde on my server, I think we have a great community cross faction of it weren't for him and his goons
---
170 players? You need 330 on YOUR faction, to get 15HK's, not just be on the server. 
---
Anyway it has nothing to do with getting rank14, it's about getting the maximum points, I just demonstrated by saying you can't get rank 14, since you can't get r14 without maximum points.
---
Go to arcanite reaper, it seems to be refugee server for alliance. Do note you will feel the same as Horde feels on your server: it's imbalanced as well, just in the favor of Alliance. Earthfury is roughly balanced.

---
complaints are valid. the warrior grind fucking sucks. and just more ginding when you are at 60 for your pre-bis, multiple which are like what 1% or less drop rates? HOJ, savage glad, truestrike, and rend blades? terrible.
---
after that though, once you have pre-raid BiS, and start getting raid gear, its all up from there. its actually disgusting.
---
So, honor decays by 20% each week.  You need to both be ranked #1 on your server *and* have enough honor to counteract the 20% decay.  Rank 14 requires 60,000 honor, which means you would need to gain a minimum of 12,000 honor in a single week to reach it, in addition to being #1 on your server.
---
And you can only appeal to an authority that no one respects, good job you dumbass.
---
I never understood the bridge complaint, because the guardhose to get into the horde base is even worse.  At least horde can mount across the bridge.
---
Imagine paying a subscription and whining online instead of actually playing the game.
---
As a horde who rolled for OP racials I mean playing with friends in a guild that is one word all caps on a pvp server with 60/40 split and playing as an Orc, I feel personally attacked.
---
"Join us cow, as undead."
---
That's.... not at all the point I was trying to make.
---
I can read that just fine
---
"POGGERS IN DE CHATO" jesus christ..
---
i clearly just said that
---
I've seen people selling Jed rend runs. You can give man those with a good group. People pay a few hundred gold for the drops from them.
---
Acquire life
---
You need the slots to get opened. For bracket 1 (most progress) you need 330 players on your faction to get 15 hks. 
---
Obviously most servers will get this. But my point was, dead server is not good for ranking. What you want is a high amount of CASUAL players with a LOW amount of tryhard players.
---
Not when you have to leave brd to get ammo
---
Another input here - played arms until 52, until I noticed I was getting problems surviving without a shield and keeping aggro with it. Switched to prot at 54 for BRD and it solved both problems - shield slam is godsent
---
Yeah pug vs pug RIP horde, this is why I haven't even concerned horde pugs.
---
I'll have an Alterac Swiss cheese with my whine.
---
Your argument isn't consistent. If you need strength and agility for threat, then why do you need dodge? Dodge = no rage. If you're that strapped on threat that you need to gear for strength just to hold threat, then you should be avoiding dodge like the plague. 
---
From my experience, Druid threat is just fine on current content without any strength or agility. Armor and stamina are literally all you need to tank on a Druid.
---
&gt;But they still dont roll against many other classes
---
Except for all the undead rogues who use it to gank Menethil flightmaster. And hunters. And ench shammies who want your gear for their meme spec. And other 10 fury warriors.
---
its your fault for rolling horde, you clearly should have expected this on a PVP server

---
I don't know if that logic adds up, but I will say I'm pretty bad. I get smacked down by some Alliance 1v1. Don't know if it's because I'm bad, or because I play the worst class for 1v1. My theory is that it's a combination.

Can you not repair at the thorium brotherhood quartermaster in the bar? 99% sure I repair there most runs.

Cloak on conc hatred, from first boss in aq40.

I have no side in here since while I am horde, I raidlog and not interested in pvp ranking: it allows me to enjoy salt from both factions. Alliance had their fair share, now I expect the same from the Horde.
---
I thought them dealing damage still damaged your gear, but dying doesn't damage it. 
---
I could be wrong.
---
Good luck finding a group who wants a lvl 50 in BRD lol
---
LFG BRD Repair Run.
---
I guess as a warrior feeling needed in group is important, because you are always needing the people to help you farm and pvp.
---
Our mages are now carrying Leafs and Sinews to trade to random hunters.
---
Hell yeah with killswitch engage and everything haha
---
Yeah its fine IMO. The context is way less important than the joke as a whole. No need for microscope here
---
Sure, but that's entirely something else than what I'm talking about. But even considering, like I replied to other people who raised the same point, it doesn't justify bad manners. We all lose our tempers once in a while, but it seems to be a culture on that discord.
---
Anyway like I said, I'm not talking about people who don't read faq, I'm talking about the general culture encouraged over there. I might've had bad luck, but the few exchanges I've read definitely did not start with a stupid question, and ended in a pointless argument with a lot of passive-aggressiveness.
---
Like almost all cats, the cougar is a solitary animal. Only mothers and kittens live in groups, with adults meeting only to mate. It is secretive and typically most active around dawn and dusk.
---
Warriors with and without a healer are honestly almost two entirely different classes.
---
haha yes exactly!
---
Please humour me, re-read our comment chain and point out exactly where I’m being the toxic one. Maybe try and work on yourself instead of flaming people over enjoying a well known animated movie.
---
AV bridge?
---
Everyone will just backdoor, unless its fixed on the current client.
---
Make posts complaining about the faction balance probably.
---
lol look at warlock t1, you have no way to complain. there are a few pieces of mage t1/idk about t2 that are BiS, or at least good, right? No warlock t1 is BiS or even close (chest is arguable as "good" but 100% not BiS) and t2 is almost as bad. Granted, 5pc warlock t1 is the best pvp set in the game arguably (at least top 3) so theres that, but strictly from a PvE aspect mage tier gear isn't that bad at all.
---
they’re just a small indie company you can’t expect them to have working chat
---
Mages actually do struggle a bit finding groups, especially for raids. There are too many of them for the number of slots.
---
They don’t call is STVietnam for nothing babey
---
Pretty sure the best spec for running is like 19/11/21 for shapeshifter, feral charge and nature swiftness
---
Whats that energy tick addon?
---
I don't get to dictate their job, I get to ask for basic respect and decency.
---
Shut up Alex.
---
Not even close.
---
Yeah, totally, because the horde majority on one server and the horde minority on another are a singular entity.
---
yes, it does suck, you have to be careful. sometimes you can drop combat by fearing them or running away to switch back
---
Hunter question: When do I start casting my Aimed Shot? Using the weapon swing timer add-on, and tells me "failed" when I use it
---
At 305 weapon skill you only need 6% hit total. You can get 5% from talents so you would only need 1% on gear.
---
At 300 weapon skill you actually need 9% total.
---
This is for yellow hits. Hit cap for white hits while dual wielding is something asinine like 24%, which is not realistically achievable.
---
It matters for the sake of economy and AH in general: if you are heavily outnumbered on PVE server, you are still going to have issues of dead server or worse (since open world resources still will be farmed but sold on other faction AH).
---
No it's really not.
---
GR8 B8 M8
---
Well, Im not in combat when I try to swap gear with the addon. But u might be right. Seems kinda wierd that they have a rogue:Stealth event in it if its not supposed to work tho
---
Paladins OP? 
---
All my interactions with paladins have been open&gt; burst to 20%&gt;bubble&gt; wait&gt; burst to 20%&gt; LoH&gt; pala runs. After all this I'm at 50-75% hp
---
Elitist Jerks in original vanilla did the exact same shit.
---
There are people from both factions being shitheads like you and there are also people whining too much on both sides.
---
I can't actually believe some people are actually thinking there is a substantive difference between the average Horde vs the average Alliance. Are you really that much of a neanderthal?
---
The only other thing that isn't really a vulnerability but does matter is that your GUID can impact in game actions as we can see with the Wrath of Rag spell. As players figure this out there could be even more systems that use it and could be exploited or be unfair for players with certain GUIDs such as bg queueing, loot rolling, spell batching priority stuff, who knows. There is likely a bunch of stuff in the game that references GUID that may appear random but really isn't.
---
I've never understood why 60s like to roam this area ganking lowbies, especially when the honor system is out.  I'm on Herod and spent a bunch of time herbing yesterday and I ran into a ton of 60 alliance in stv harassing / camping lvl 30-40s.  I had to keep killing them til they left.  The sad part is when someone who will happily camp some lowbie instantly runs when someone their level comes along.
---
Been in LFG for an hour now. Just now found a Mara group that is still looking for 1 more DPS and a tank.  
---
I'm happy you were able to find instances so easily. This is not the case for everyone.
---
some!? try like 3 pieces or maybe even 4 lmao. shits ridiculous. oh you wanna wear that sick looking t2 head? not if you're a min maxxer enjoy this 40 or 41 shadow damage green. 
---
oh shit saph drape dropped? well unless you're using it for pvp enjoy your +20/21 shadow damn cloak for a while.
---
Nice t1 shoulders! nope trash for pve enjoy your greens.
---
on one hand, its really a blessing because we get a lot of our bis or pre-raid BiS SUPER easy. like I had the vast majority of my pre-raid BiS before 60. on the other hand, it sucks from a "cool" point of view.
---
at least our tier gear is beyond good for pvp. 5pc t1 is the best pvp gear in the game (assuming you're SL spec) or top 3.
---
That's a bad advice: being 60 won't help you, you are going to be farmed for honor if your faction is on the lower scale of presence.
---
Yes, Skeram and Heartseeker need to be merged. Heatseeker is made up almost entirely of people who transfered from Skeram.
---
Good thing there's only what, 3? 4? Nullifiers.
---
So because there is one dungeon that gives good xp for 5 levels its magically better then questing for the entirety of leveling... Yeah that's not how it works.
---
Stoneskin gargoyle cape is best 4eva
---
ive personally never done it but i imagine its ok if you do dungeons most of it
---
Shadow damage on gear also affects your Life Tap. Having a larger mana pool may mean you last for 3 more casts, but when you go dry and want to refill you end up spending more GCDs on weaker Taps.
---
Felheart is mostly for PvP, or for some Resists on the pieces that have it.
---
&gt; Mage or Warlock
---
These classes don't pull threat. It's the other Warriors man. Windfury makes shit really hard.
---
We're currently having our Totem Twister drop Tranquil Air in place of Graceful, but then we're losing crit and it still doesn't guarantee the threat table. A WF proc+HoJ has a chance to instantly pull threat still.
---
&gt;Fury warriors have like no drops in MC and have to roll against half the raid for it
---
2 rings (every physical DPS wants them), leather bracers (warrior/feral druid prio, really), leather gloves if you're not human or orc (every melee except feral wants them too), mail hat from rag (hunters, shamans and palas want it too) and finally 2 plate pieces - gauntlets and girdle. Oh, and your ranged slot is contested by rogues or bad hunters.
---
Doesnt enchanting a weapon bind it to you?
---
I know 100% that putting rogue poison on a white/grey binds it (in this case temporarily) to you.
---
yeah the raid spot thing is rough. warrior competition for spots in good guilds is insane lol
---
Of course they are. But sitting in LFG for a couple hours trying to cobble together a Mara group, versus doing quests in a level 48-55 questing zone. I'd much rather be doing quests.  
---
I get your point, but it's not like instance groups are immediate. That shit takes time. When I only have a few hours to play, I'd like to get some XP in that time.
---
sry fella :o
---
I would get  more than half a bar of xp even when I was over-leveled for the dungeon - ST was way better for leveling. Plus the amount of leather/scales you could get was crazy.
---
3 or 4 sure feels like 10 or 12
---
Tell the Horde on Stalagg to transfer.
---
to be fair, I think you're overestimating paladin prowess a bit - even with bubble, a paladin healer can easily be shut down by a sufficently dickish priest... just DoT up their partner, put enough pressure on the pally to bubble, then throw out a mind control on whoever they're trying to keep alive. 
---
it's the most amusing spell, since last I checked, you can't dispel it, you can't heal 'em, you can't do shit, since they're no longer friendly targets. did that shit a lot when 2v2 arenas were a thing in TBC and I've basically bathed in tears. battlegrounds are going to be way more chaotic though, but some rules still apply.
---
Unlike warriors, you're not generating most of your threat from being hit. You're generating most of your threat from you attacks. 
---
Strength for threat generation. Agi for armor and crit, which is incredibly important for threat generation b/c of the extra rage on crit talent. Dodge for damage mitigation because you can't be crit immune so any mitigation helps.

Are you seriously tanking end-game dungeons in Cenarion?
---
Looks like Electro from the "me and the boys" meme
---
Stalagg as well.
---
Nothing you've said is related to the comment, you must be really salty that you're on a 70% horde server and in two weeks instead of overwhelming alliance in wpvp with quantity over quality you'll be crying about queues.
---
They have to force it, because no one is willing to do it voluntarily.
---
...once in a blue moon IF it procs.
---
Eh I play on sulfras and your just wrong. Every flight master is constantly camped by horde, lights hope might as well be a horse zone, chillwind point the same, hell feathermoon stronghold is held by horde more then it is alliance.
---
Rogues dont really play well with others, theyre really weak in group play sadly, thats why a rogue's best friend is... another rogue. Sap is their best cc and its pretty much a 1 time use *if* you get to use it at all, their blind is a posion which makes it weak and obviously cs into ks is strong but if that person doesnt die... well you got a problem.
---
Redoubt Cloak from tribute runs looks awesome too
---
my friends older brother was a rank 14 human warr in vanilla and i remember after he got his GM stuff him and a geared priest from his guild went outside org and just anihillated people for quite some time
---
different time though, if that happened now they'd just get outnumbered. back then there wasn't as many people, as many geared/good people, nor as many people with as many forms of instant communication. but I remember he was just manically laughing a ton because he couldn't believe what was going on.
---
Ill have to check it out. 
---
Cause ATM in my head im torn between 13/27/11 or a 10/30/11 All depends on how thorns Hold up IMO cause an Extra 20% health without Buffs are nice IMO again i could be wrong. I just don't see a benefit to FCing after thorns?
---
I'm not at all saying horde players are better than alliance players. That's just you assuming. I'm saying alliance players cry about losing pvp substantially more than horde players. This can be seen easily by this entire subreddit.
---
Healer who just heals and healer which pops hof are two different classes as well :p
---
Yeah I mean pvp zones in general really aren’t that bad until you get to the ones where you’ll actually give lvl 60 players honor. Then it’s welcome to die.
---
yeah but GL getting one. idk what the might droprate is but BRE is hard to come by. I know its RNG, but for example, my guild has been clearing MC with 4 raid teams since week 1 and we have 2 or maybe 3 BREs drop. Some guilds have had 0. I'd be curious how many guilds have gotten 4+ if any.
---
Who passes for Wow out of pocket? Sounds excessive.
---
Signed,   
---
all Multiboxers
---
Yea but you can’t
---
Jokes on u bruv I only think in kelvin
---
Live strat is righteous orbs, dm east is thorium and herbs, tribute is gear.  Maraudon is mostly just vendoring but the best version relies on selling the ring.  
---
Since this is a 5-man operation, any version of high gph is going to rely on more than vendor trash.
---
free gear but dude.....they gotta play a druid. as their class! pray for them.

Make groups urself. Saying LFG x, y, typically wont get u far. If i make a group and LFM im sure not looking at global channels, instead of just waiting for whispers.
---
So can you remove his post too then wtf?
---
Happened to me as a hordie too.
---
link achieve or I wont invite you to anything ever
---
You want resto druids in raids because healers are not easy to find and you want druid buffs.
---
Is it not boring to run dungeons over and over?
---
It actually doesn't. You can never get enough threat to beat someone when their threat spikes 2x or 3x over a short period of time. If you could, threat would be completely irrelevant.
---
Policy is policy. GMs don't make the decision to help, or not help. They follow a policy. So no, he wouldn't 'change his mind' - there is no mind to change. He can't change policy, since that is made by the people who create the policies, ie the Developers.
---
Trivia: the term for active during dawn and dusk (or twilight) is crepuscular. This term also describes house cats.
---
At least they're not a gnome
---
The fact that you don't need a stable and can pull out any minion anytime is very attractive indeed.
---
Don't want anything Deeper in Feral? really? I get how Swiftmend can be really usefull. 
---
Do you think it comes down to playstyle? I guess im expecting to sit in bear when im not running with Flag. and wanna be ready to take some big hits.
---
&gt;all the undead rogues who use it to gank Menethil flightmaster
---
Sounds like you're arguing out of emotion.
---
Same, I've been in STV the last couple days on Incendius and apart from a single high level gank, almost all the PvP has been my own level. Seems fairly balanced faction-wise too (unlike the rest of the server).
---
Nobody deserves this shit, neither alliance minority nor horde minority. This is happening because of mismanagement by Blizzard, and unfortunately is only going to get worse as people on the minority factions quit or reroll.

You where killed for taking pictures, that's illegal under occupied Hong... I mean Orgrimmar.
---
Not gonna lie, I ganked any horde mage I saw doing this. :(
---
Give me water noob
---
Now this is the RP I want to see
---
Oh, he’s an angry mage.
---
Do whatever's funnest for you and it won't matter how long it takes.  However, if you want to increase your speed, you can go for a drain tanking build, either right away or respec at about level 40 or so, since you almost never have to drink and eat.  To save money, you can bring food instead of water and just life tap your mana pool up and eat; you can also life tap up and bandage to save time, and the expense of money.  Most importantly: if you can fear it, you can kill it.  With a bit of ingenuity and patience a warlock can solo many things that other classes have to group up in 2's, 3's and even 4's for.
---
This, and the market has changed since vanilla so the going rate for an xmute is roughly 5g/24h as a normalization for most high pop servers. There are some exceptionally valuable ones, like undeath to water, which essentially turns 1-2g into 15-20g every 24 hours, so this example (and other less lucrative ones) further reduces the supply of alchemists willing to go on CD for 48h for arcanite.
---
you also kill 10x faster...
---
Me too apparently
---
Definitely true for a priest. Did a bunch of BRD and LBRS runs starting at 55 and got a lot of the gear I need and a ton of experience. Much better efficiency than questing for me.
---
Yea, this build is about surviving. You don't loose too much from only 12 feral as your damage will come from gear stats.
---
Not the same thing
---
If you want to base your choice on what's Needed: druid. It's the only class that can do it all without paying an outrageous hybride tax.
---
Nå var du god norna
---
You're not thinking long term man. These things cost you nothing but time (ignoring portal stones)
---
You have the ability to influence people around you with free things that everyone needs. On my mage alt I cannot tell you how many times I gave someone water and then later we cross paths again and they're helping me with a group quest they don't have.
---
Big brain big think.
---
Thats a nice picture. What class is this alt? And what are your other two characters?
---
This whole thread should be removed as per rule 5.
---
if you are good enough players than can easily 5 man UBRS you should sell jed/rend runs. prices should be lower now but still good enough. or speed run strat live.
---
I have run BRD from 54 (when P2 hit) to 58. It wasn't that bad tbh but as time went on I started to be more and more picky about the groups I formed. 
---
BRD is really smooth of you have a decent group. Still having flashbacks from that time my tank was a keyboard turner tho...
---
this is also 15 year old knowledge. thinking it would be different this go-around was to be naieve
---
im almost starting to agree with the conspiracy theory of some people here that blizz is actually sabotaging their own IP...
---
&gt;Because it ruins the games aesthetic 
---
This sentence only makes sense if you consider looking like a dumpster diving hobo 99.99% of the time is a valid aesthetic and that it is ruined by being able to look coherent.
---
&gt;a big part of MMO's is knowing how strong someone is when you see them
---
No it's not.  In WoW you can see like, maybe a few pieces out of sixteen slots at a glance.
---
Haha Stranglethorn Vale is comparable to that of the jungles of Vietnam during the Vietnam War! Brilliant meme!
---
Literally this, alliance was a filter for kids, cancer, terrible players and so on. It's all turned around completely. Horde were vastly superior in pvp and pve, now its alliance. The Legolasseess have all become undead mages.
---
They wouldn't behave different at all, the thing is that only one or maybe two servers total are as unbalanced in our favor compared to the however many (a lot) others that are the other way around. So overall, it's less common. That's why you'll have more chances to hear allies whining about it. I believe if the roles were reversed then you'd hear as many horde whining about the situation as allies currently do. The reason? We're all human.
---
Hemorrhage
---
You can solo arena as hunter? Need to try it out. Just for fun. I’ll probably just stick with the Hauberk as well
---
No they don't
---
Wow that sounds useless af.
---
That's funny, I've done them with full groups and the mages were low on mana after each pull despite there being three of them. I'd really like to see what soloing mages do better.
---
This affected me on the server Whitemane. What servers are you guys on?
---
That deescalated quickly.
---
You mean the visible pieces? That's still a massive indication, if you see a Rogue in Bloodfang with BWL weapons you know you're in for a shit time. Looking like a dumpster diving hobo actually makes you look like an adventurer, using the equipment you've found along your way.
---
must be one of those morons who are surprised this happened.
---
This was too funny to read lmao
---
Looks like pvp happening on a PvP server. Might I suggest that you'd be better suited to a pve server? 😝
---
How much of a difference do the later raid sets for hunter make? I was thinking about finishing all my raid bis for now and using my hunter to mostly pvp with some farming. At least until I decide what other class to level.
---
Don't let being salty make you this dumb
---
And in BGs you’ll have an arms warrior going HAM on you during this getting healed and cleansed by that bubbled paladin
---
For the 1 millionth time. Yes, you are stuck. You can't honestly be a part of this subreddit and have never seen this been posted before. At least read a few posts or aim to search the subreddit before asking such a silly question.
---
Efficiently doing the best farms, that amount of wealth can be accumulated in less than 4-5 days played. It's weird how people think 10K-15k is some kind of seemingly unattainable amount of gold.
---
F
---
A player with 500 "honorable" kills crying about wasted time... Let me play you a sad song on the world's smallest violen.
---
All the horde on our server are camping 24/7 menethil docks with a 15 man raid, BRM with a 20-60 man raid 24/7, or EPL Flight Master with a 10 man raid. 24/7
---
I made great money being the only mage in ungoro just doin my thing farming. Sold a few ridiculously overpriced ports and drinks. Some guy got mad when i wanted 5g for uc port. What u gonna do, walk? Supply and demand is a bliss
---
HoRdE oUtNuMbEr AlLiAnCe

As healers, you're right :D
---
Something about your comment history makes me think you lie a lot. It was so interesting I just kept going for longer than I'd like to admit
---
8/8 t2 sucks in comparison to bwl non set epics
---
The downside is that you feel forced to pay for both accounts even when you dont really see the benefit because of the fear of losing your progression. At least that is what I hear from my friends with 2 accounts.
---
For trash don't use dots, unless there are a few of them that you know won't die ASAP, and assuming your tank knows how to hold aggro on everything. If there are mobs that will survive for more that 15 seconds, use Corruption on them for a chance at Nightfall procs.
---
Other than that, spam Shadowbolt. Later on, you should be getting Shadowburn and use it to snipe mobs at low health, to finish them off (use at 5-10% health).
---
On bosses: Amplify Curse, Agony, Corruption, SB spam is what you should be doing, and finish the fight with a Shadowburn.
---
DPS will see an increase after level 52 or so, when you've started getting the key Destruction talents to fill up your build.
---
i dont care if the bug is simple or not, i expect raids from 15 year old game to be relased without major bugs that change mechanics entirely
---
Time is a finite resource each interruption of your current train of thought is like ten minutes so yes if you just want friends in a virtual game because that is what you like then sure you are doing well. If you dislike interruption because it takes you off the task you are actually working on then you may disagree with this opinion. Making gold as a mage is not a problem having time to do the things you want to is however because of these types of things.
---
There is a specific bug report form, that goes to the team who investigate bugs. CS don't investigate bugs, and can't escalate your issue. The bug report will contain information that you and CS can't see, relating to your account logs, that is needed to investigate.
---
At least, that's how it is in the company I work for, so imagine it's similar or they wouldn't have a specific bug report form for players to use.
---
I see you like bananas too.
---
M.A.G.E - Nyhm
---
Anyone?
---
While that's a fair point, I too would get annoyed if someone is asking the same question as someone else did a few minutes prior, especially if the answer was already present to begin with in a FAQ or a few rows up. For perspective, I don't play warrior, never visited said discord and I'm about double the age you listed in your OP.
---
I'd think people would want to look up rules/FAQ and the like when joining in the first place - or they should - it's just good sense.
---
Can use those to drop combat anymore
---
I personally like Rune of the Guard Captain better.
---
Changing the unit of measurement doesnt change how hot something is lol!
---
do a flip
---
Has not been my experience at all.
---
Yeah I’m close to 60 on my main but still not there.  I have a handful of alts under lv 20 that I will level every few days trying to accumulate rested xp while farming pre raid gear on the main.  Hoping to have 3-4 characters at 60 eventually.
---
That discord server is a sewer
---
You will need those defensive stats more come BWL.
---
rip
---
According to reddit, those servers don't exist and the allies on those servers wouldn't camp.
---
Oh I know, faction caps seems to be the general consensus. It is the only way I've seen mentioned that will directly incentivize majority populations to transfer immediately.
---
I don't know who to believe help
---
You’re correct they are very easy to find
---
It will on some servers.  A majority of the servers are horde majority though
---
What are you talking about, you guys don't even flag when I'm there xD

trust me, we will make it worse &lt;3

---
I think you'll be fine with 3/5 suppression. I have 5/5, but do not take CoE. Lucifron stands out as a boss with crazy high shadow resists, it could help a little bit if you'd ask another lock to CoS that does have 5/5, to make you help your curse easier. Imp CoA is not worth it for the reasons you said and can be safely dropped. Imp drain soul, i don't have personal experience with this one, but from what i read it's not worth points either. On the other hand, 5/5 fel concentration isn't of use in raids too, but it great to have for any kind of farming.
---
start roleplaying youre all mute and communicate by emotes

---
It's not rude to ask me for water/food. It's also not rude for me not to give it to you sometimes if I'm doing something. It is common courtesy to tip me for taking the time to make you water though. If it's a portal, it's not just common courtesy, it's an obligation to at minimum pay for the rune, and a tip is common courtesy.
---
Solo SFK for twink items. Read a post yesterday of a 60 war doing 100 runs. 3 per hour. Lots of twink items there to AH
---
what part of feels like you cant understand? IT feels like Alliance is not on the server. but have you clicked the video? how do you like corpse camping ?
---
It's one time use FYI
---
And undead Shadow priests
---
Just wondering, how many rus till you hit 60 you reckon?
---
Telling people they don't need more than 6% hit, telling humans/orcs not to use edgemaster even though just 5 wpn skill makes a huge difference imagine 7 additional on top of that.. 
---
Saying hand of rag isn't a good weapon compared to other non legendarys etc. I could go on just a bunch of dicks there spreading false information to make themselves feel better tbh.
---
The honor comes right to your door, what nice guys
---
Awesome. I'm 5/8 T1 on my rogue and excited to finish it up moreso for the look than the actual 8pc bonus.
---
This is my instinct. I feel like it wouldn't be too hard to simulate the dps over certain amounts of time to see just how long it is worth waiting for the auto shot over starting the aimed shot
---
Yeah pvp against lowbies there a lot. Tanaris is shit too atm.
---
I just transferred an alt here brother, one by one well turn the tides :)
---
So instead lets complain on reddit wasting time. Just ignore people lmao
---
You're definitely correct but I personally like Rune of the Guard Captain better
---
As a fury warrior its not easy to get a group. not sure what i'm doing wrong but I cant get in any brd or anything like that and iv been 60 for 2 months/ faerlina. I just run uldaman solo.
---
Oh so this is what AIDS looks like in videoform.
---
inb4 banned for RMT
---
Explain how spy is doing it....
---
Just delete your chat box then and completely ignore the other players if you want peak efficiency
---
How? I enjoyed the short comings though.
---
Oh, u not wrong. I only wish it auto saved it to a directory while appending the filename. Fucking windows.
---
So you had to come with your agenda to our battered game....that is the problem a clunky gender...
---
Also: Druids should be using Maul on every attack, which prevents them from generating any rage from their attacks.
---
Just delete reddit man, I went through your account it clearly just stresses you out. No one needs to live life this angry.
---
Lol what did they do? Are they the only ones that fight back?
---
Maybe he/she was flirting with you, beefybits ;)

We also don't have to feed it or care about its happiness at all!

I do this + princess and thats around 30g. Cant imagine getting 30g without princess
---
Currently lvl40 tauren druid on Mankrik US East.
---
I've run into quite a lot of people leveling, haven't had any issues finding people for elite and group quests. I've never had a hard time finding dungeon groups either. Currently in the badlands and there's quite a bit of people competing with me for mobs.
---
World has been alive and well in my experience.
---
Well you're not talking about all warriors, just some.
---
Do you pee into a bottle? Are there scheduled bio breaks for everyone to go at the same time?
---
Meh I personally dont sell Arcanite transmutes. If someone asks me I in turn ask for 18g. This is how much I can do with my other transmutes.
---
At lower level it should not matter as much, I tanked as feral no problem.  I have even tanked at 60 forgetting to put 2 of my points into something but I definitely notice at 60 its harder to hold aggro.  I will be interested to see what happens when I switch over to tank build.
---
Elemental farms are currently impossible on PvP servers for warriors, and this is speaking as someone on Skeram Horde. 
---
There are still plenty of Alliance rankers around who will be glad to corpse camp until I'm worth no honor. I can win 1v1s easy whenever reck is up, but I'm not winning anything afterwards without using consumables and severely cutting into my profits.
---
The bridge is too easy to hold because of how long it is and how one wrong step can send you falling to the ravine below. The horde one is simple, you just run right through and then horde is forced to split their defense because the horde gy is terribly designed while the alliance gy is right in the middle of the whole base. 
---
There’s a reason alliance bridge is infamous and the horde “gate” isn’t. And no offense, but people have extensively thought it out for 15 years so it’s not like anyone can present a compelling case for how the bridge is better.
---
STV is actually kinda fun as a low level imo. The majority of my pvp interactions in STV have been against players of my own level range rather than 60s
---
\#NOCHANGES
---
It's the same AP, but with just 1% hit.
---
HoJ scales with your gear - as your autos hit harder, so do the HoJ procs.
---
itemrack has lots of bugs so im guessing thats why.
---
She's a cow-eater!
---
Just do the whole grind with a priest friend 5head
---
Then why is this post allowed?
---
Opening a trade window to someone out of the blue is rude who does not think this is the case? Of course someone can ask you for food and water and you can also say no just don't expect them not to get all bent about it.
---
Everything has to sync for me otherwise I’ll hate the character and at some point delete it. 
---
I’m on my 7th iteration of my mage that has hit lv20 minimum every single deletion. Gnome is superior but those human female casting animations draw me back in every time. 
---
I’d make two but I have an incredible mage name I want to use and don’t know which I’d end up maining. Sucks.
---
The only times you 1v1 is when someone has mobs pulled or they're oom, because you are a lil bitch.
---
100% agreed. I would say that at 60, you should get only honor killing other level 60 players. Even at lower levels it's kinda ridiculous that you can't even see the level of the other player and still you grant honor for them. Usually if I see ?? player, I just assume that it's 60 that will one shot you. 5 levels should be absolute maximum at any level.
---
Morgaine eu always have atleast 1 full raid of allys near brd mountains killing everything over and over again. Zf is full of allys and even fellwood 🤪
---
Aren't bgs cross realm? Do we expect long queues?
---
Unflag yourself for pvp .
---
You could farm Eye of Shadow in Winterspring or the Blasted Lands. I usually see them going for \~300-350 on my server. While it's still going to be RNG based, but I couldn't imagine it taking longer to get one EoS than it'd take to farm 10-15 Righteous orbs in Strat Live. We had a 10-man raid group farming the demons in Blasted Lands for our priests and we were getting around 1-2 EoS per hour on average.
---
I imagine the issue with kills and honor is that it’s a ranked system that is calculated for the entire server.
---
If I get 1000 kills and you get 1001 and that put you in a higher rank than me, but suddenly yours didn’t count and I get the rank... fixing it is suddenly no longer that simple. 
---
This is why I tell people that if you don’t enjoy the actual actions of the grind, if all you see is a chore with a shiny reward at the end of it? *Do not do it.* It will never be worth it.
---
This is classic though, people are here because they wanted an immersive rpg in which questing and leveling are actually fun. Who would ruin that for themselves by spending the whole time in a dungeon?
---
I mean the grind sucks unless you have a friend to play with. Warrior + Druid/pally/shammie makes for disgustingly fast progress. Or you just level in instances and it doesn’t matter.
---
And the payoff is crazy. Warriors can be the best tanks, the highest DPS, great DPS while OT, never have to worry about groups, are utterly insane in PvP at high levels etc.
---
I’m a rogue and I’ve had some people ask me if it bothers me that my damage will be eclipsed by warriors. Nope. I’ve had 15 years warning and I don’t care, I love my rogue. Same deal for warriors... it’s been very long known that the rough leveling is there, and that the reward is the end game.
---
I buff and help out warriors when I see them in the world because the grind is pretty annoying a times, but it’s not that bad
---
You'll have a similar experience on any ganking server, as stealth classes around 5-10 levels above you can always farm you for honour while you are questing.
---
Once you get to 60, they should be using mobile "gank squads" of 3-5 people instead.
---
If you don't want to be ganked, roll on a normal server and type /pvp when you want to do world PvP.
---
Wait alliance has the advantage in bgs even though horde have way better racials? Interesting
---
Yeah dude but there is this one server....m8 are you delusional? 90% of the pvp servers are horde dominated. We know that that there is this one that isn't, you make abundantly clear each time you get the chance.
---
I call bullshit, unless you're playing at like 9am weekdays.  4pm-12am any day there's a fuckton of horde in STV (Myself included) leveling alts.  
---
Meanwhile, when I was in Stonetalon as a level 25, I would get spawn camped by a group of 3 level 60 alliance (hunter, warlock, and paladin).  I brought in my 60 after they killed my alt 5 times, killed the hunter and warlock quick and the pally bubbled and ran away.
---
That's what I've noticed about Alliance on Sulfuras, they must outlevel you by 10 levels or more, or outnumber you 4:1 or greater, otherwise they run or die.  It's kind of pathetic.
---
“Fren” is baby talk for friend, from the now banned nazi dog whistle subreddit r/frenworld. KYM article on it: https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/sites/frenworld

&gt; I'm just jealous you got to bid on the mageblade.. Off limits for paladins in my guild :(
---
wtf
---
get a better guild - it's literally bis for holy paladin.
---
dude, im on mograine, if you are pvp marked in ironforge, your dead.
---
and all pvp realms are inbalanced in horde favor, what's your point?
---
Level a hunter.
---
+healing cloth doesn't have the base stats to stand up to long encounters.
---
As Lephus mentioned, the main advantage DS/Ruin has over SM/Ruin is the 5% damage increase of Demonic Sacrifice over SM/Ruin's 5/5 Shadow Mastery (which isn't even quite 5%, considering Nightfall procs for SM/Ruin). Additionally, the more targets there are in a fight the more SM/Ruin closes the gap or even surpasses DS/Ruin since more targets =&gt; more Corruptions =&gt; more chances for Nightfall to proc. Lastly, while you should just Phase Shift your Imp in raids (since they die so easily otherwise) to provide Blood Pact, instances are more forgiving where you can have your Imp out to provide supplemental damage.

PvP? DS/Ruin could have more health (Demonic Embrace), health recovery (Improved Healthstone), faster hardcasting of demons (Master Summoner), a near instacast demon every 15 minutes (Fel Domination), but they need to sacrifice their pet (Succubus) to get a 15% Shadow damage boost; SM/Ruin always has the 10% Shadow damage boost, get to use their pets (Succubus Seduce and Felhunter Spell Lock/Devour Magic are amazing for PvP), Amplify Curse and likely Curse of Exhaustion, Siphon Life, and a bit more range on their Affliction spells (Grim Reach).
---
PvE solo? DS/Ruin can have their pet out and it would be stronger on its own than a SM/Ruin's demon due to Demonology talents, but they have to sacrifice it to get their 15% damage boost/3% health every 4 seconds/etc. SM/Ruin always has the 10% damage boost, can always have their pet out adding supplemental damage, Fel Concentration (which is huge, since it enables drain tanking), and Siphon Life.

---
\- Of the 21 points needed in Destruction, I'd consider 17 of them core for raiding (5/5 Improved Shadow Bolt, 5/5 Bane, 5/5 Devastation, 2/2 Destructive Reach, 1/1 Ruin): I put the other 3 into 1/1 Shadowburn (great for PvP and good for PvE if an enemy is almost dead but you don't have enough time for another Shadowbolt) and 2/2 Improved Lash of Pain (helps with solo farming since it takes it from 12 seconds to 6 seconds, greatly improving your Succubus' damage output).  
---
\- Of the 30 points needed in Affliction, I'd consider 22 of them core for raiding (5/5 Corruption, 5/5 Suppression, 2/2 Improved Life Tap, 2/2 Nightfall, 2/2 Grim Reach, 1/1 Siphon Life, 5/5 Shadow Mastery): I put the other 8 into 5/5 Fel Concentration (really helps with solo farming since it enables drain tanking), 1/1 Amplify Curse (boosts your Curse of Agony every few minutes, which is ideal for 5 man bosses, raid bosses if CoE, CoS, and CoR are covered by other locks, and PvP by boosting CoE), 1/1 Curse of Exhaustion (good for PvP), and 1/4 Improved Curse of Exhaustion (the first point boosts its effectiveness by 50% since you're going from a 10% to 15% slow, with relative diminishing returns after that).
---
tl;dr DS/Ruin has a 5% Shadow damage boost over SM/Ruin, but SM/Ruin outclasses it in just about every other way. Even the 5% damage advantage isn't exactly 5%, taking Nightfall procs and demon supplemental damage into account. Additionally, SM/Ruin can outclass DS/Ruin on damage if there are enough targets due to multi-target Corruption spam leading to a higher chance of Nightfall procs.
---
I feel attak
---
Those are two separate issues in my mind though.
---
I agree that the GUID impacting in game mechanics is not ideal, but I don't think having randomized ids would fix that (just would change who is affected).
---
Thanks, Kirm for this. Its the perfect example of what feels like playing as Alliance. I have a plan how to ruin Horde's BG que, how to make it over 2h+ and i will freaking do it. :)))))  
---
I cant wait for the Spam, FIX THE QUEUE TIMES, ALLIANCE JOIN BGS DONT BE PUSSIES!. :) I cant freaking wait to see them cry why not many alliance players will want to queue when they realise they need not that much exp to do weekly levels :)))))))
---
My servers mostly horde, but the Alliance seem to do nothing but roll around all the popular farm spots 24/7 in groups of 5+. Guess its back to mara if I wanna make some gold...
---
Except ashbringer
---
What server are you on? They go for 35-40g on mine
---
Alot of PVE realms are unbalanced in alliance favor. They do bgs too, maybe more so since they have a harder time doing wpvp and bgs are very accessible. 
---
Shouldn't queue times be relatively okay?

It’s been done about 3857757373 times since release by horde players.

Isnt firemaw one of the most populated servers?
---
some of these bugs were just left because people didnt care about the old content some have come about because they have shoe-horned the old game onto the new client
---
also who is going to look at MC 14 years down the line and go "shit best fix that bug in MC in case someone decided to do it"
---
it's a given that the pally is holy
---
How can you make a **text** chat that doesn't work with any kind of population we currently have in classic servers? Absolutely ridiculous. It takes multiple minutes until you can even see your own message in chat.
---
You'll take 4-5 hits before you die, generally. You'll take like 1 hit without gear. The 4-5 hits over 5-8 deaths is maybe 1 durability point MAX. Dying 3-4 extra times to save that point isn't a good use of time.
---
Please stop posting this lmao
---
Must be the undead rogue sitting in BRM.

On most serves
---
When you fly in from literally anywhere endgame they have 5 minutes to kill you

no clue really, but we still have queue when its primetime
---
Bloodfang is nice
---
Thats why i have NS still

leveling with a paladin is fucking ridiculous.

As about half fights in the current content as heavily ranged favored: They do.
---
3% hit

How many times are you going to delete your post and repost your video?
---
Player vs Player doesn't explain at all you will be farmed in the open world if you play low pop faction. There are tons of PvP mmos where you don't get farmed and unable to play for 30min.  
---
Not saying turn off PvP system, most people are saying change the PvP system where it doesn't reward high pop faction camping every single FP/quest + farming zones.   
---
Yes, people will still farm those spots to be toxic, but numbers will decrease if honor system is reworked.
---
I mean I'm also farming WPL/EPL/BRM as Horde on Horde sided server and I feel bad. But people are doing it for that PvP gear so what can we do.
---
The horde base is so riddled with flaws it’s completely uncomparable to alliance. AV is infamously known as the Alliance battleground. There was only one time horde had an advantage and the alliance players boycotted the battleground until Blizzard moved the horde’s spawn cave way to the back. 
---
Fun fact, Drekk has the single highest amount of player games as an npc in the entire game. Why is that? Alliance makes it to him way more than horde makes it to Vann. 
---
I see you have an extreme bias against horde in that you believe horde simply complains when they don’t have an advantage which isn’t the case here at all. AV has directly been an alliance battleground since inception both in base design and Tower vs Bunker design. There are hundreds of videos out there detailing exactly how that is, you have the mathematical data supporting it with Drekk ranking 1st place in player kills, and had Blizzard admitting it themselves when finally in LEGION they fixed AV so that the bunker wasn’t just clearly better than the tower. 
---
Wsg gy design is alliance favored. Not a huge favor, but horde take damage falling from their gy and alliance do not. AB has the slightest alliance favor in that Blizzard put a fucking fence directly in front of the farm that you have to jump over and typically clips you somehow which is why alliance typically get the first cap, even by half a second to a few seconds. And AV was pretty much designed by alliance players with how many allowances it gives. 
---
And this is all coming from an Alliance player. I won’t pretend like my faction isn’t favored in these battlegrounds.
---
if you're aoe farming the right content for your gear, it simply won't scale to the proportions. Tanking 25+ enemies means only 4 of them will take dmg and you'll burn through the stacks immediately. The dmg sources you'll look for in aoe grinding is specifically dmg on struck (ret aura, Razor Gauntlets, naglering), sustain on struck (Demonforged Armour, Skullflame Shield) , things that boost these factors (like spell dmg gear, that boosts things with a coefficient (Consecration spell, Demonforged Armour, Skullflame Shield) or the raw stats you need to survive long enough to kill the pack off (Stamina and Int specifically, like Ring of the Martyr etc.).
---
As for the talent set, only Consecration and BoSanc make a huge enough difference where it's basically mandatory. Worthy mentions are Reckoning, which increases your sustain, DF for a free full heal on yourself during pull, Imp Ret Aura for better aoe dps, Vengeance for better Consecration damage. These are the talents that affect aoe grinding most, in order of usefulness =)
---
T1 helmet is bis over t2 that's a big sign of bad. And the t1 bracers are only bis if you have the 3 set with the boots otherwise 21 frost dmg ones are better.
---
If horde are remotely competent, you can have aoe going on the narrow door leading out of a room which dismounts you then goes up a hill into a narrow gate.  The entire path is a giant clusterfuck for aoe because the entire area is also very well covered by the two towers on the ends of the gate.
---
Horde can amount to run across the bridge and jump directly into the alliance towers.  There is also a path to the side of the bridge.
---
I've done it on both.  The bridge is a meme but it's less bad to deal with than that fucking room and path horde have.
---

---
This. Idk why I had to scroll so far down.
---
Shifting cloak looks great
---
That requires a lot of help and planning from people you trust and know. Consistently, day in and day out. Most people don't have this. It's also highly class specific. For example, most mages would laugh at this advice.
---
Tell some of your Horde to come to Zandalar :(
---
Healing power boosts your mana burn, dispel, power word shield and renew how again?  A priest's power lies in the toolkit, not just big heals.  More mana means your team lasts longer.
---
Ironfoe has 1ppm and is far too slow for tanking purposes for a paladin.
---
It's always a hunter with crazy amounts of gold and black lotus. One hunter bought a soulstone from me for 10 gold and then opened trade and flexed his 10k gold and stacks of black lotus
---
Fuccccck.
---
Have you heard of dungeons?
---
Im glad youre having a tough time
---
This is actually dumb. A lot of times in the scenarios that you listed it's a bad idea to nova.
---
healers are like 50% of the playerbase. No top guild runs a druid healer. They'll run 1 boomkin for FF/Mark/Spell aura. You can't have druids healing because it fucks with world buffs.
---
T2 8/8 is trash
---
It is much better due to its weapon speed, it synergises greatly with our Seals of Light/Wisdom for resource regeneration and threat by doing so.
---
As Lephus mentioned, the only real advantage DS/Ruin has over SM/Ruin is the 5% damage increase of Demonic Sacrifice over SM/Ruin's 5/5 Shadow Mastery (which isn't even quite 5%, considering Nightfall procs for SM/Ruin). Additionally, the more targets there are in a fight the more SM/Ruin closes the gap or even surpasses DS/Ruin since more targets =&gt; more Corruptions =&gt; more chances for Nightfall to proc. Lastly, while you should just Phase Shift your Imp in raids (since they die so easily otherwise) to provide Blood Pact, instances are more forgiving where you can have your Imp out to provide supplemental damage.
---
PvE solo? DS/Ruin can have their pet out and it would be stronger on its own than a SM/Ruin's demon due to Demonology talents, but they have to sacrifice it to get their 15% damage boost/3% health every 4 seconds/etc and they can't drain tank since they won't have Fel Concentration. SM/Ruin always has the 10% damage boost, can always have their pet out adding supplemental damage, Fel Concentration (which is huge, since it enables drain tanking), and Siphon Life.

---
Im just having fun with what we have in front of us and not caring too much about the 'what if' possibilities. Im living in the moment and just taking it phase by phase, we know were getting naxx and everything in between which is all we initially signed up for. Anything further than that be it TBC or something entirely new and cool, ill try it. It would be a bummer if the classic community followed the perpetually cynical outlook of the retail community. Blizz knows that the classic players want something a little more 'base' whatever they choose to do.
---
Should I roll a Nelf Rogue or a Gnome mage (or human?) I'll be on a pve server and my main is a shaman, my buddies will be playing shadow priest and ret pally.
---
You have thorns. Get the nagelring, two is best. Profit
---
“It’s beginning to smell like almonds”
---
Should do scholo and strat once you hit 58 so you can start gearing up a bit
---
you have to use a script for that, just google: SCRIPT HIDING KEYBINDS ON UI WOW
---
The problem is that 2 players in their high 40s or low 50s can relatively easily kill a 60. 
---
Hell, I killed a skull warrior on a 37 paladin. Every CD imaginable but I won the gank! I assume he was 46-50 since he still had on the ZF plate shoulders.
---
Yes I will admit t1 for solo farming is pretty awesome but for raiding... It's not
---
We been doing this for months with my guild and we just started doing 20man MC aswell, nearly full clear we got rag to 800hp this week '(
---
I like this attitude, I am the same. Today some guy in Org whispered me asking for a port to UC for 1g. Made the port took his gold and before I could walk away someone else said "invite me I'll pay" so I did. He put up 70s. I declined and told him 3g. He got very upset and probably talked a lot of shit but I ignored him and walked away.
---
If only, just slap together a raid and run them out of your zone. It works, but its time consuming and irritating.
---
my server hasnt had a queue for weeks what are you talking about
---
It brings in 25-35g/hr in straight gold from greys, greens, and boss blues. I skip straight to the cathedral and clear nothing else to get as many boss kills as possible. Turn all the silk/mageweave into bandages and vendor them. Pull 2-3 mobs at a time as fury, maybe 4 if your arms spec. I was clearing the whole thing in about 13 minutes as fury, a little slower as arms due to power sustain.
---
You have no idea what you’re talking about. Any additional weapon skill beyond 305 is marginal and the math is in the FAQ. Hand of Rag isn’t that great.
---
This kinda confirms what OP is saying though. If it’s taking you 4 hours to do ony and a boss in MC and raiding 16 hours a week, progress is much slower than it should be. While casual is not the right word to describe it, the difference is quite big compared to other servers where it’s not uncommon for the average guild to clear all content in under 2 hours.
---
Nope. It could in future content but I have sold 2 gray weapons with fiery on it that I have used.
---
Honestly on alliance it's not that fun. I ended up levelling a lock so I could sit it at SM and summon my group because it just killed way too much time running there.
---
On my server alliance are in Feralas and Winterspring, Searing Gorge is horde controlled.
---
Thanks for the reply! See duns are my fav. I like grouping together and clearing it out with the bosses and stuff. I try and do each dungeon 5 times before going to the next so i get a good feel of it as a tank. Now some duns ive done 15+ times trying to get a specific item. I do have atlas loot and look ahead to see if theres a better cloak or 2h weapon in the next dun bc ill just get that item then.
---
Lmao. I have a video of my guild raiding Org on Monday with lots of interactions and people in the discord begging us to do that again because it was fun fighting at the gates.
---
Fuck off with this "we can't do X ever" and whining about it. Plenty of horde guilds do raid with world buffs, and a lot of horde control menethil boat every night for 20-30 minutes.
---
Art of War has MULTIPLE hand of rags dude. If you're in a casual guild, then sure this hyperbole works, but many horde would tell you to "git gud".
---
Wow classic classic
---
Loved this. Thanks for the laughs!
---
wow
---
your friends will also love you if you'll open them chests
---
if you go mage go gnome
---
Yeah, that's not how mounts work in classic.
---
Do they still hit you after you vanish? I remember a buff that lasted 2 seconds or whatever that made you immune
---
My nearly Pre BiS geared fury warrior can farm SM: GY, Library and most of Cathedral and make about 18-20g an hour selling all the trash and gear drops. Did that to get the last 200g for my epic mount
---
Horde on HS do camp menethil boat and FPs. Last night, Art of War controlled menethil boat, then I saw them at LHC. After that, Mutiny controlled menethil boat. Horde on HS have plenty of options, but instead the population just wants to fucking whine on reddit and raid log while people play the game, thinking it's as bad as alliance on skeram (hint: it's not)
---
i find it fucking hilarious priests get a 30hp trinket from Dirr Maul and mages get fucking mp5 lmao
---
not much unfortunately.  hunters scale extremely poorly so the better gear just doesn't boost them much.  they peak at MC and it's all downhill from there.
---
Do you still think these aren't bots?
---
Mage tier 1 helm is bis and t2 pants. T1 helm being better than t2 helm is sad. Nothing else is unless you get the 3 set bonus for 18 extra spell dmg and even then green boots and bracers are really just as good as getting t1 helm, boots and bracers which are the best 3 to get for the 3 set bonus
---
Not here to feel good being a wiseass to people bud. If you rely on reddit for your kicks I once again strongly suggest finding a healthy alternative. Good luck!
---
Bruh
---
Just stop being poor
---
Also complaining about things doesn't mean you think they should be different, it's like complaining about my boring job but I'm not gonna quit it.
---
Awesome write up. What about main hand? I just got a wraith scythe and that thing scales 1:1 lifesteal.
---
I really want to switch to prot around 51 or so just because I like the idea of being a classic prot tank so I might make the plunge soon
---
Not quite the same is it? Someone casting a magic spell to change their appearance works from an immersion and world building perspective.
---
Yeah shaman and mage ones should be switched
---
25-35? My guild has 30+ people from two decade old guilds. Soak in epsom salt before the tears of Alliance for best results.
---
kys
---
I have them on my Thrash blade and Shadowblade at lvl 50. Still worth having. I ganked a lvl 60 rogue in about 10 seconds and had it prock 6 times during the fight. Absolutely worth it, even in your 50s
---
You just complained about 4 pieces of heat that rogues also need, the difference being is warriors get instantly invited to dungeon groups whereas rogues wait 2+ hours to do 1 run. Warrior is much easier.
---
Target the player, right click their portrait, and add as battle tag friend. They have to accept the request first but after that you can chat like normal.
---
It isn't built for DPS it's built for tanking it can't be good for both thy need different stats
---
Same thing happens all the time on incendius
---
Those zones weren’t so bad. 
---
Gadgetzan is literally Horde territory now. As is BRM.
---
What’s better running content and getting xp or running back to ur corpse with no xp
---
Yeah if you're looking at top guilds they often under represent rogues (4ish rogues) and bring like 11 warriors because warriors bring everything a rogue brings but more and slightly more dps
---
Tauren have hooves trolls do not
---
Imagine paying a subscription and not being able to play the game.
---
Get a decent guild.
---
It’s not just ranged. Ret paladins can get hit by them too.
---
https://m.imgur.com/gallery/NYlkDcy
---
I’d rather get gank raped by the enemy faction than go into that dungeon
---
Boat from Menethil Bay.
---
Don't though. It's not worth it. Westfall and Loch Modan are perfectly good 10-20 areas and Redridge starts at 16 to supplement that.
---
Lowkey nerd-savage bro. Keep it civil.
---
I see 3-4 other people at least in most zones. It's kind of an inward bell curve. Lots of plays at low levels and high levels but a sharp dip around the mis range.
---
If almost every PvP server wasn't heavily skewed Horde, yes
---
Not sure, seen a lot of people been upset with them. All I know is that they're one of the best guilds in classic. Bet lots of people are just salty because of phase 2.
---
My backdoor is always exploitable.
---
But what about enemies who don't grind pvp and are decked out in top raid gear? What insane and unfair advantage those individuals abuse, sidestepping the immortal law of gear visibility!
---
&gt; Rogues can do just as competitive dps if you look at logs,
---
Do you know what scaling means?  They're only competitive because everyone is at best in full MC gear.  Wait until AQ.
---
He’s talking about elemental mastery our 31 point talent. Basically because of spell batching or whatever it is you get a guaranteed crit off your lightning spell and shock spell, even though the tool tip only says your next spell gets a guaranteed crit. 
---
I feel like blizzard will eventually fix it. But it’s sort of underwhelming when it’s working as intended and they didn’t fix it a decade ago for whatever reason. So maybe they’ll continue to ignore it now.
---
Must be nice wearing tier gear and actually getting loot from raids
---
All right. Ragnaros, geddon, shazzrah (until you can outheal the AE), ony are all melee friendly. Gotcha.
---
Just shows how little you know. And, as it seems to be your main strategy in an argument, lol.
---
...what job?
---
Its cause bucklers turned into shields. Bucklers where those small ugly ones we still see that hunters and rogues could use in the beta. they where later changed to shields and skill removed from hunter and rogue.
---
Sm lib.
---
Clear out your bags. Nothing more than hearth, bandages and some food.
---
Every run turn your silk into bandages.
---
You should be able to clear 3-4 times per filled inventory. 
---
Hearth to southshore vendor all the greens, send the promising ones to bank alt.
---
Rinse repeat. This should get you ~30gold per hour depending on drops.
---
You don't need more than 6% hit with 305+ weapon skill - provided you HS and preferably HS stopcast. 
---
HoR is not a great warrior weapon, especially not when considering the investment.
---
Weapon skill softcaps at 305 and nearly hardcaps at 308, getting 312 doesn't do much.
---
We call the FP tower in Org the Honor Tube fwiw.
---
&gt; That's awfully specific. Wait: Mages have the highest single target and AoE DPS of all casters. There. I can do that as well.
---
Would it be better if they had just said "[absolute highest DPS](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic-dps-rankings/) in the game, that remains solid throughout Classic, and which unlike Rogue actually has AoE?" Because thats more accurate. Warriors the best DPS in the game once its geared, by far.
---
&gt; Which helps you tremendously when you are in the middle of nowhere with hearth on cd.
---
Yeah, thats Mages special utility. You could argue getting instant groups and always being desired as a tank *or* a DPS is Warriors.
---
&gt; Until it comes to raids. Where mage is better once again.
---
I don't even know what you mean by this... In what way? Warrior is higher DPS as well as taking the tank slots, theres a reason you see so many in raids. And either way... both are some of the most desired DPS, so who cares really, they both get slots.
---
That's certainly a risk when you see someone with a temporary disguise on!
---
Exactly so vs a priest I will almost never use ice barrier unless they are trying to mind blast me. I don't think you're getting what I am saying. You seem to be arguing as if I've said I keep ice barrier up all the time vs priest which is literally the opposite of what I said
---
Maybe, they haven't said anything about battle groups though and I'm not sure if they have enough servers to justify battle groups. You might be right about them locking it to server types though.
---
Any chance you could talk more about the tools you guys had? Say that for instance, player would ask restoring an item that he accidentally deleted from inventory, how would you go about to find about what happened? Did you have free reign to do sql-queries in production environment / backups or was the there a logging system so good that you could figure it out without access to the database?
---
Thats insane. My luck is so bad... really disappointing but i guess we can try again. Are the blasted lands mobs solo/duo-able?
---
Druid tier 1 is only good for PVP.  Tier 2 is the first set which is actually itemized well for healibg.
---
No, obviously those fights are ranged friendly. But warriors are so op that it doesnt even matter.
---
The AOE stun talent doesn't work as well as you'd think. There's some crap about it only triggering 17% of the time of the WHOLE cast, not every tick.
---
I was wondering if that dude on the left was a human model or some gorilla from UnGoro?
---
Lmao imagine actually believing this. Boomer is truly a mindset isn't it? If you think you were playing WoW at peak efficiency after a year of picking up an MMO for the first time ever you must still be a terrible player. Are you guys the same people saying classic WoW raiding is as difficult as retail raiding?
---
Any rag wep will do, both have a ~5% give or take drop rate. Anyways, with BGs comes AV, and with AV warriors will get The Unstoppable Force which is a great weapon to start out with.
---
Truth.  According to armory, I'm around 50/50 in every BG except WSG. In WSG it's almost 2 of 3 win rate.   I've been a flag carrier since quake 2 and as a feral I can win almost single handedly.
---
It's not really worth doing that as a tank since you get raid gear so easily. But even if you really wanted to, it's still easy to get the dungeon gear. You have no competition for any of your loot as a tank. You will get it the first time it drops.
---
Yes, you're talking about Flamelash, which is a horde PvE server. You're describing the experience of a full on carebear who'll occasionally get ganked once in a blue moon, unlike the alliance on your realm who get ganked anytime they go anywhere, even if they group up. Alliance on Flamelash are transferring overright now, big time. The only reason alliance can contest world bosses is how hardcore Veritas, meh, venture and big dig go after those kills, while pretty much every horde guild is bad atm.
---
Imagine being this mad about pvp happening on a pvp server... yikes
---
Darn. Oh well, thanks.
---
Sure, then you laugh/cry as every weapon, Cauterizing Band, Wild Growth, or Salamander Scale gets given to the "good" healing classes.
---
I demand those scoundrels drop their disguise and use fair tools! They are even worse than transmoggers and achievement hunters who do it for titles instead of rewards that fill inventory slots!

Okay mage t1 helmet is better than t2 and t2 gloves are really the ONLY thing you'll want from t2 come aq20 and zg and by then you'll have ditched t1 helm for mishundare
---
Delusional because you invent a straw man that asserts alliance would never do this. I don’t think anyone doubts the situation is flipped on some servers, but the reality is alliance are mostly the ones dealing with being permacamped everywhere they go.
---
So if im a Human that uses sword or mace. How many pieces of “+1 % to hit” gear do I need to Wear to be hit capped?
---
All classes get stronger, what?
---
Mages eventually lose the crown of best ranged DPS to Warlocks. Can't wait for that to happen so all my Lockbros suddenly get vindication and all the Mage band wagoners turn into salt mines.
---
Meanwhile, Warriors scale absolutely crazily.
---
This will just make the imbalance worse, fuck no lol.
---
If 'aesthetics' are part of the religion female nelf priest worship then I'm hella religious 😍
---
Ehh.. druids definitely highest skill cap with great 1v1 potential but "highest" might be a stretch.
---
I mean if you were an example of how alliance on my server are, id be playing a pve game. Thankfully, theres more shit coming out of your mouth today than comes out of your ass every year so i dont have to worry :)
---
Imagine playing alliance and not playing the superior race. Not playing gnome on alliance is a waste. Paladins and gnomes is what makes alliance PvP good. Just morph to a human or whatever if you can't stand how they look.
---
Careful, this is an Alliance sympathy and support sub. Don’t interfere with those brave heroes ransacking the place.
---
I started an alt on a medium-high server and it's pretty easy to find dungeon groups, but insanely difficult to find quest groups compared to when I started playing a few weeks after launch. I'm not sure I'll even complete the Hillsbrad elite quests.
---
Spy checks the combat log continuously, I guess that's what they mean?
---
This isn't entirely true.  I really don't think your opinion on PvP matters much as to whether or not being told to "g O tO r Et Ai L" while getting corpse camped endlessly by a raid of 20+ players constantly getting spit on.
---
The current state of the game really encourages a lot of toxic behavior and being on a PvP server removes your ability to turn off that highly engaging and immersive aspect of the game.
---
With battlegrounds coming you will be able to PvP when you want and you won't need to deal with a lot of the troublesome stuff some many people here complain about.
---
What's this Grafana looking stuff?
---
Sadly it's less useful than it could have been because you'll just end up staring at the countdown before you can resurrect for longer. At least you can AFK and browse the internet instead of running.
---
Rogues scale with gear as well. SoF daggers with the AQ books does some pretty serious damage.
---
That aside.. something I saw from the launch of vanilla to its close, and am seeing again now, is that warriors tend to shine the most once you have the content on farm.  When things are going well, the tanks have solid aggro, the healers aren't having mana issues etc... warriors fucking destroy everything. But when you're working on progression and threat is an issue, you get the boss down with half the raid dead? I always see rogues well ahead of warriors on those attempts, staying there until you really do have the content down pat. That's when warriors tend to be able to push out that extra damage and really put up big numbers.
---
And honestly I don't get why people care so much about winning the little box. I'm not bitter about warriors at all, I rolled a rogue again because I love rogues and I give zero shits about who has the highest theoretical damage in the world. I'm almost always top DPS in my raid and when a warrior beats me? Great! The boss died faster and we have a skilled warrior with us. But I don't get this whole "ONLY WARRIORS MATTER FOR PVE MELEE LOL" when the reality for 99.9999% of raids is that the person playing the character matter a whole lot more, and that rogues more than earn their place in raids.
---
Hell on a more personal note.. I've been expected to be top DPS in every raid I've ever been in since vanilla. Generally am as well.. it wears on you, being expected to perform perfectly week after week with everyone gunning for your spot when sometimes you just wanna be one of the hybrid class/specs who lift everyone else up and happily sit in the middle of the pack yourself.
---
BWL is coming early Jan? Source?
---
How does being able to level fast make it busted? Warriors are notoriously shit to level, and its well known they don't have so much of a power curve as much as a power *cliff* when they start to gear at 60.
---
Fuck man I can't wait until BG's come out and people get to witness holy pally + arms warrior. People don't know what busted is until that duo hits them in the face.
---
nahh, i'll still be farming you and you'll still be making QQ posts on the forums while a ghost in game. that's just who we are, and 2 weeks won't change that.
---
cheer up bud, and good luck out there!
---
Its funny you say 2 or 3 gold but you also say 56 times a day so thats like 110 gold a day for very little time spent which isnt bad lol. Only a mage would complain about such easy gold.
---
"I don't feel so well, Mr. Stark."
---
Blaumeux is a good server. I would wait to see what the ganking is like in a few weeks after bgs release before making a hasty transfer to a worse server.
---
There are account-wide achievements in wotlk. If you care about those kinds of things, your characters won't count for each other. That's about it.
---
I think I just got bingo.
---
Yes that is true. I kinda hope they do a TBC+ with a few changes, as well as a no changes TBC version.
---
Yeah but swords suck. Seriously, I just.. don't enjoy them. Never have in 15 years.. rogues just feel right using daggers.
---
Combat daggers and SoF dagger do more than enough damage to be competitive in every raid of vanilla, with SoF being by far the most fun raid spec IMO.
---
“60/40 isn’t even that bad” is the most infuriating thing. Most people Don’t realize that 60/40 is 1.5 dominant faction player per minority faction player. 70/30 is 2 and a third dominant faction players for every minority faction player. 
---
Not to mention that the numbers getting thrown around are out of date and don’t include the disparity brought on by the players who have literally stopped playing until BGs come out because they can’t level.
---
Lol, yeah.  This is completely different.  Big brain 1000IQ here.
---
My upvote button. got you bro
---
Haha, what game are you playing?
---
Then quit.
---
To everyone reading this, class discords usually have much better info than the easily available stuff on wowhead or icyveins. I strongly recommend joining them.
---
That was added after vanilla.
---
There are several things that exist which I don't know if they are bugs or not.  There was plenty of shit in vanilla which was always fucky, FD and vanish among them.  Is this in particular a bug, I don't know, but vanish and feign death never worked all the time in vanilla.
---
Trick really only works on people with 3k-3.5k HP. (Kinda depends on how much spell power one has.) Much more and they begin to have enough reserves to retaliate. PvP gear should alleviate this a fair bit as a lot of it is focused on stamina. 
---
You have pally as your flair so I am assuming that's what you play. If it makes you feel better you too can cheese people with a ret/prot build that makes use of reckoning. Just prep a 5 stack of reckoning and unleash 6 hits worth of damage in a single swing. Even if they survive you'll likely pop off a couple extra double/triple hits from them hitting you with crits.
