You're literally sayng people can't do things for themselves. This is how communists think, and I mean this in the most literal sense.

---
If I work and make money IRL, am I entitled to spend it on myself? You're arguing that if I don't share it across the entire community, I'm againt the community as a whole, and that everything I do is antithetical to said community around me. Are you autistic? Unironically? Do you have friends? If yes, sre you obliged to help them equally as much as you do work for yourself?
---
Go outside a bit and speak with normal people. Just about *everyone* agree to the concept of owning things, and don't feel entitled to other people's things. Giving someone should be a gesture of charity or compassion, not due to a demand.

---
Lol i have a T2 shaman actively raiding on a p server and WF is essential for our tanks and melee.  You do not know what you are talking about.
---
i find it amusing that green posters would habitually fall over themselves to impress Activision with their subservience and quickly shut down ANY post that indicated interest in classic, and with such authority lol.
---
Pahanda, if you post here, i am laughing at you in Classic.
---
Leveling to max is not really "hard" more like time consuming. I would avoid melee classes like rogue and warrior if its your first time. Easy levelers are warlock and hunter for sure. But anything else works fine too.
---
How hard is raiding? Beginner raid MC is fairly easy and will teach you the basics well, vanilla is not really a super challenging game individually, but more the team work and stuff.
---
Faction differences: Transporation is kinda different, horde has no way of getting to blackrock mountain fast which is an important zone as it has 3 dungeons and the first 2 raids, but they do have good lowlvl transport and more quests in zones like hinterlands and swamp of sorrows. In Pvp the big difference is that ally has paladins and horde has shamans. Theres is some racial differences like undead will of the forsaken, orc hardiness and gnomes escape artist especially, but paladin and shaman is a big difference, paladins are uber tanky healers with lots of utility to help especially melees, shamans are very offensive, often bursty and tanky casters, that can dispell enemy buffs and buff dps on melee. 
---
For raiding the difference is again shaman and paladin. Paladins have some pretty good buffs and can buff the entire raid with especially threat reduction. Shaman can only buff group but they have some amazing totems for melee/tank, and a bit weaker threat reduction for others. A big difference is also that dwarf priest have fear ward which makes fear mechanics(about 1 boss with it every raid), a lot easier to deal with, where shaman totems can dispell fear but it's a bit more risky. Overall horde is more risky and chaotic than ally, which is why I love horde raiding :D
---
Please don't make me president daddy, i can speak in full coherent sentences. I might accidentally make gun laws or get you health care. What terrible thoughts. Gosh i pity you guys :/
---
we are all probably gonna have to wait 2 hours before getting a mob tag in the starting zones
---
You do not. You only need an active subscribtion.
---
you know its true vanilla when you see the auto attack button on the hotbar
---
So you agree with me we shoduln't care
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Thanks
---
This is the good think about classic, gear stays relevant, and new people will be starting mc all the time, FR will still be needed for new guilds when naxx is out.
---
Best threat weapons for tanks are daggers until thunderfury so night elf is just better until then.
---
Yes and no. If you're going that route you will definitely need to run dungeons frequently to fill in the empty spaces. The good news is you guys will be STACKED gear wise which will actually speed up any and all activities you decide to pursue.
---
I wish I was in your shoes. I'm leveling a priest and after I get the few points in shadow I need I'm either going mostly disc or mostly holy. A healer on demand, that's me. I LOVE being a healer unlike most. I'm praying I find a guild that works with my schedule, is looking to push content and doesnt mind someone helping the guild in any way possible. Most would say I shouldn't have any issues but my schedule...isnt going to be kind for raiding sadly. If I had 4 others I could rely on to game with, life would be a helluva lot easier

Yeah I mean one thing I would add is that with upgraded honor gear being dropped in phase 2, if you can get rank 14 you'll have incredible gear for every spec, especially in the early game.
---
Dude, no one is lampooning Content Creators™ *et al* in here. The ones being criticized, however,  did NOT "lead the charge" on those signatures. 
---
Then you insinuate the Classic community would be dead without... the Classicast guys? Only guys I can think of "who have relationships with Blizzard." I think even they'd cringe at the suggestion that they're somehow solely responsible for the livelihood of Classic WoW.
---
It's very very good if your tank is much better than your DPS
---
That doesn't prove much of anything tho
---
Saw that click-baity title too. Fortunately, I had just closed the reddit app and I knew that the scrubs at pcgamer wouldn't have the scoop.
---
Yep, use a macro to feign death, pet on passive, and lay a trap. Then when you need to trap in combat you spam the bejeezus out of that button.

No wonder blizzards customer service is trash grade
---
To be fair, they were probably asked to respond in that way to that question.
---
barrens.chat has all of them in one of their guides at the top
---
I mean....YEAH that's pretty much it.  I played Vanilla and Classic will be fun.  I will go fucking ham for as long as I can until 8.3 comes out and I have to return to the retail grind.  Just cause I am not 100% pro classic forever doesn't mean I won't play or go far in Classic.  I am a streamer I have all the time in the world.  I also won't lie to my viewers who also played during Vanilla and make it seem like it was rainbows and skittles.  I will tell you the bad and the good.  
---
All in all Classic has an end.  And there WILL BE NO extension past Classic.  This I can confirm 100%.  NOW Classic TBC?  Maybe years down the road.  Retail for its faults still has new concepts and content in the game.
---
So your assessment it straight fire!  But it doesn't mean I won't play Classic or not be apart of a great community in Classic.  I played Vanilla and have as much as a right to talk about Vanilla as anyone else.

I miss the days of being accused of screen watching (They were right :)
---
It’s part of one of the more famous office memes on this sub
---
This post is so true. I was talking to people at work, and I mentioned I'm gonna be playing classic wow this summer. Immediately two people said wait, they're bringing old wow back and are now interested in playing. Theres so many people who stopped following video games that do not know this is coming.
---
Only thing I could find was [this screenshot](https://i.redd.it/n44dd4rxrp121.jpg) of the list from [a thread from five months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/a25q3y/end_of_vanilla_112006_list_of_ncps_that_kills_the/).
---
green posters are the biggest fucking bootlickers. almost every post i read from them causes my eyes to roll
---
Not even a little. Most times when someone goes on a tirade it's because they're bad and get removed for repeated mistakes.
---
In PvE you'll be resto. In PvP you can meme it up with enhance, or go deep ele. The most common spec in PvP is 30/0/21 ele/resto though.
---
My best advice is don't listen to this sub. Watch the wow cinematic, and when the character creation screen comes up, just read all the information you'll see on the right hand side of the screen as you move through all the classes and races. Find what seems awesome to you, and play the shit out of it
---
It actually said Q3 as Q2 ends June 30. Still July as a possibility though.
---
I remember when cata first came out and they made the content more difficult due to the hardcore players wanting it to return to vanilla days, then not even a month later they nerf fucking everything because the carebear 12 year olds said it was too hard...
---
They would lose money doing that, building hype with a release date is part of making money
---
honestly part of me can't wait for people to get fucking lost as hell in ST / BRD. Those were the times
---
BUUUUUUTTTTTTTT it doesn't die!  What's fucking sad is I can imagine you sitting there mad I have 2-3K viewers in the early AM cursing at the screen, then rubbing one out when someone else passes me?  Come on bro.  Looking at past post history.  You just need help.
---
Your verbiage was pretty confusing. Why would people who quit vanilla because it sucked be the people who enjoy classic the most? Classic will closely resemble vanilla and if they quit because “it sucked” then they really wouldn’t be the ones who enjoy it most. Confusing post.
---
He's the worst of them. He obviously started up just to try to get on the classic hype train early without actually knowing anything about the game.
---
And I never demanded it be separate.  It's been a topic of conversation for ages at Blizzard since they thought about bringing it in.  Face facts.  I may be hated by a lot of people here but I KNOW WAY MORE about whats going on with Classic then 99.98% of the people here.
---
How the fuck am I gonna make money on Classic with like 30 streamers each having 20K above me?  Get real.  I have my community.  Fuck off and lemme make my 6 figs in peace.
---
It felt so good to run through those plains again in the demo. No orcs, no giant crack. It was like going home, and I could have lived there.
---
Also, nice dog.
---
It's ok Tips I never played Vanilla either but when i show my 60 PvP achievement I apparently bought my account too.
---
personally i'd go mining and skining. i'd store the mats i got from mining for engineering later. if i could be ahead of the pack i'd start farming devilsaur leathers for a bit in ungoro and then either get someone to craft me devilsaur gauntlets/leggings, or i'd level leathworking with the stored skins from leveling.
---
Hah! Thanks for sharing. I thought this was a great feature and more than a little helpful when planning AH purchases/listings.
---
Newbie was a good insult.
---
sadly i'm from EU ... but we grouped up in H1Z1 in the early days if you remember ;D

#ARR ME HEARTIES!

Worse and worse yet has grown in players and is now at an all time high? Ok mate.. nobody ever noticed you stopped playing.

So you're asking if I made up the Khaz Modan thing on the spot. The answer is yes. I like Warcraft lore. :P

About the GOAL: 
---
Have fun. Vacatum is a place for players who are skilled at the game but still have a life. I was 16 when I first played classic. I am 30 with children now, I don’t expect raid attendance to be 100% but we do want people who want to progress in end-game content. This game is about killing bosses…and that’s what we’re going to do.
---
NEWCOMERS:
---
We will teach you the ways, don’t be shy. Classic is much more about relying on your guild for progression. This is a guild that will harbor new players seeking to get better. THERE ARE NO DUMB QUESTIONS!
---

DISCORD: https://discord.gg/TkBnhFV
---
Are you shitting me?  Who pushed those petitions?  Kungen, Soda, Nick, Private server content creators on YT, Asmongold, tatman,  should I go on?  They zerged those forums with people, viewers and petitions.  And recently those Classiccast guys are a huge feedback format for Blizzard.
---
Asking others for information? Well there are other ways to tell everyone you haven't gone to university, but this way is effective too.
---
Those two claim to be 100% no changes whilst arguing for things that the vast majority of players never experienced in vanilla as being essential to the classic experience based off of their time on private servers.
---
There are a few things I disagree with in your statement. You assumed what my feelings were on the subject when I was actually just curious. If Classic WoW was going to be heavily advertised they would have started already as the time frame is very short. I think your wrong on the fact that "those people who fell in love with vanilla have no idea what's going on", I think the majority of people are well aware due to the hype around when it was announced. Lastly they might give a release date but I doubt it will give them plenty of time as the time frame of summer is very short. But to be fair I am sure they will give a release date shortly and it will be launched in the last week of summer.
---
Wow, amazing, revolutionary take there. Nobody realized this before.
---
The Office gif earlier mentioned it. Check them out they're on the front page of this sub right now. We are all so desperate for Classic...
---
As someone who has extensively played both wrath and cata private servers over the last 6 years, I can confirm holy power was added in Cata.
---

---
The hype was huge and the longer they take the lower the hype will get. At least that's how it is with me.
---
this survey doesn't have anything to do with classic, and is breaking the rules.
---
You're going to name you character chad, and make it a female priest lol?
---
Well he was right for 4 years which is pretty damn good for tech/software. 640K memory is enough for anyone etc etc
---
If you have 4 friends and want that team dynamic, maybe have a warrior, paladin/shaman, druid, priest, warlock/mage. Very flexible team with multiple tanks and healers, and aoe+utility. 
---
Outside of dungeons though I'd level in duos depending on who's online, grouping to 4-5 only for elite quests or heavily contested zones. IMO from solo to duo is a big jump in kill speed, recovery time and safety. The increase benefit from duo to party of 5 is smaller and less necessary.
---
Lol
---
so the beta level cap is level 30. tarren mill world pvp inc.
---
If you are worried about soloing, choose a class that can handle it well. Hunter, warlock, druid..
---
Yeah....but they don't wanna have to pay for BFA, so the quicker they get to 60 and burn out on the lack of content, the quicker they'll unsub until the next phase and then BFA gets no money in the interim.
---
See, genius.
---
Why are you the way that you are?
---
The part for warrior plate bis through vanilla is having a ton of stuff to pay for. And edgemasters costing 2k+
---
Or running brd arena for epic chest
---
While rogue tier sets are itemized for dps. Warrior have to wait till aq to start getting some of that
---
I've just always had a support role. I enjoyed DK tank and tossed around the idea of rolling warrior, but I've been told tank spots are super competetive, and my work schedule would force me to miss raids every other week or so, so I dont think I'd get a shot at tanking except for the most casual of raids
---
The difference is that I'd have to spend $50 on the BfA expansion. I'm aware the sub is the same, but I'm referring to giving people who play retail WoW (Battle for Azeroth) a head start in classic WoW. That would suck, and is ultimately what I assumed OP meant.
---
Yehah I agree! I played from 2004 till 2013 and stumbled on the fact classic was going to be a thing only 1 mth ago! So excited and I told 3/4 rl friends who all played in the past. All are now coming back for classic.
---
“Times change...”
---
I play Horde on PSs but man Alliance starting zones are still so nostalgic
---
WOAH WHO TOLD YOU THAT ITS A DAMN LIE
---
Coming around the corner and it starts pulling away... try to make the jump and.... shit. Corpse run
---
Oh, I just realized that I didn't actually finish reading your original post. I assumed you just wanted a link to the old lists – pardon my oversight, it’s late where I’m at 😛
---
To actually answer your question: There has been no mention of a potential return of the lists for Classic yet.
---
1. No beginner classes in the game. Some classes are better at some things and worse at others.
---
2. Getting into raiding is mostly about the friends you make on the way to 60 and the time you can invest into the guild. The first few raids are easy, so just come prepared. You have plenty of time to learn before the hard raids.
---
3. For raiding you will have an easier time with some classes and specs. If you are a Ret paladin you will have a more difficult time contributing to the team then if you are a Holy paladin. Both can contribute but you will have to work harder as a Ret paladin. 
---
4. Go whatever race you want. There is a difference in abilities but they are minor. Unless you want to be in a top-tier guild, race will not matter. Go alliance if you want to go alliance. If you are interested read up on alliance racial abilities. Don't go horde for the abilities if you want to play alliance.
---
5. Since you asked, I would suggest mage for DPS or priest for healing. Mage is a straight forward class to play but has a lot of room for fun. You can do PVP and PVE. Priest is just the best healer and most in demand (usually). But you will only be healing as priest. IMO mage is best unless you really want to heal.
---
same man, and they dont even get paid lol
---
Top dogs only.
---
[deleted]
---
yeah as soon as i start seeing 2 or 3 of the same thing on the whole front page i start getting pretty pissed
---
lol?
---
meh, they'll relearn how, since no one plays druids, apparently.
---
I remember the WoD MC, "Your job on this fight is to DECURSE, not dps, dps is 2ndry, we will ALL DIE if you don't decurse!"
---
And that was just MC. It didn't pretty much instantly kill you like Noth does if you don't decurse in time. It just burned on your efficiency and would eventually kill you.
---
I want the beta so we as players who actually know vanilla can point out potential issues. The health regen in the demo for instance.
---
It was a hell of a thing first time you wandered in. It was nice to have little "safe zones" like this one and the Gnome refuge in Gnomer.
---
If you pull subpart DPS in a raid, PvP players will drive to your house and break your kneecaps. It's true. NEVER PLAY PvP!!!
---
Way to be a debbie downer.
---
Idk I quit right after launch, they were doing pretty well when I left
---
Which classic did you play where you got upgrades every time you logged in?
---
I never got why people hide names, especially on news articles, it's not like a can simply Google the title to find it
---
Is no one gonna mention the puppy in the corner lol
---
NA PVP realm horde guild looking for players.
---
Core that we have now are all private server vets and looking for anyone and everyone who wants to raid! Raids will be eastern us.
---
Msg me if you got any questions :)
---
Good solution is to get all the keys to the dungeons. It's a great incentive for invites
---
There are thousand of them, people used to say Blizzard would never do an official vanilla because it was only a handful of nostalgic people, now they think it will be a failure and dead after a few weeks
---
They are going to be proven wrong again.
---
&gt; Kungen, Soda, Nick, Private server content creators on YT, Asmongold, tatman 
---
No one in this thread or in this subreddit are even talking about them. All I said, is that the people receiving "hate" ***in this thread*** are not at all responsible for any signatures. 
---
&gt; those Classiccast guys are a huge feedback format 
---
I can't deny that, I didn't even dispute it. They weren't the only 3 people in the world pushing more content phases, progressive itemization, limited sharding, spell batching etc. This community would not be dead without them, that doesn't mean I don't appreciate what they do.
---
Man I forgot about wall jumping. That was fun back in the day. I wonder if you’ll be able to get to the top of the waterfall in the human starting area like you could in at least WotLK.
---
Article is just click-bait :(
---
calm down lol ! for this bad quality . 22 a month for 2  character LOL
---
This is great, especially for warriors. Though sadly it doesn’t change much about probably just having to buy the gladius ASAP. It’s just too good to pass up and reliable. The chest locations really help with getting some extra money though!
---
It’s unlikely that many people will be able to plan to get the coldridge treasure chests because there will be a lot of competition for those, being in the main leveling path.
---
This is the strategy we used. You hid around the corner to avoid breaths and popped out to heal and retreated to get LOS protection. Of course, since the tanks were right around the corner the whole raid would get fucking obliterated if someone lost aggro.
---
Good username
---
you know its not a lie Towelliee, stop playing yourself.
---
yeah i dont want to play a beta i want the full game
---
Blasphemy who told you these things?!?!?!
---
Miss that place so much
---
HAHAHA i like the sense of humor, i was hoping maybe rank 13 wouldnt be terribly hard with a part time job, i heard the grind doesnt really start till rank 10. But i dont have the 12 hours a day or more for 3 months type of time
---
Sounds like a great way to alienate potential players from an IP without much gain.
---
Do you guys remember when wow was actually on tv? Night elf Mohawk!

That's why we had two tvs on each side and everyone on the same team was on each side ;)

Well I'm taking what he actually said, which was sub.
---
I was able to play through all of Persona 5 and dragon quest 11 with my newborn, totalling about 250 hours of play time... Plus all of Dragon Ball super, so there is definitely time to play with a newborn, you will be tired as hell though, and dungeons will be really hard to do since they can wake at any moment.

That is definitely true but announcing a release date means websites post it as big, exciting news. That’s free marketing for blizzard especially for those that wanted to try vanilla wow but haven’t been following it as closely as people like us.

No what’s really sad the fact that you felt the need to even reply to this. It’s the same reason I stopped watching you towards end of WoD, the whole egotistical need to go on 5 minute tangents when you ban people instead of just silently banning them and not drawing attention to the behavior. 
---
And trust me I haven’t seen your stream on twitch in years due to having a plug in that allows me to block streams from even showing up on listings. Truly this reddit topic is the first time I’ve given your existence the time of day.

Have fun being the Asmongold waiting room and bleeding subs. Reply or don’t I won’t see it or dignify a response.

RPers are gonna be tolerant of a lot more from a game play sense than people who take raiding or pvp seriously.

I wouldn't say more toxic, just gonna be more toxic about game play related things they care about. THe rest is probably about even
---
Clicker!!  REEEEEE
---
Classic
---
Fantastic Goldenshire post, friend!
---
I loved my rp server, but yeah assholes are assholes.
---
Source?
---
Don’t confuse pservers with what classic will be.
---
Why would I care about Asmongold viewers or what does my subs have anything to do with it. You literally watch, you pay attention and you care. And I'm Josh's waiting room now. I don't mind being sloppy seconds. I gets mines. What's your name I will unban you since you seem upset
---
I actually think this made me want my first alt to be a pally.  Only for when i'm in the mood to play runescape or a similar low attention game at the same time lol.
---
It removes blind so you don't have to time it correctly.
---
He’s literally the best one
---
On my server we had a lot of player made events. The running of the gnomes and some cool wpvp events took place on Scarlet Crusade.
---
This chain was amazing, especially when considering the fact how much is WRONG in private servers. 
---
The fact the guy doesn’t understand actual threat from vanilla WoW (NOT private servers!) was hilarious and what started all of this.
---
He definitely hasn’t touched high tier (honestly, probably any) raiding outside of the Private servers with his seeming understanding of aggro. 
---
Funny/sad major chain of comments, I feel sorry for anyone who has to raid with that mind set in their group though.
---
Well you typically call it by it's class.
---
Dispel usually refers just to removal of magic effect. unless you're asking a paladin, since he can dispel anything except curses.
---
Decurse for curses.
---
Cure for Poison or Disease (disease is fairly rare so usually you're asking for poison removal, and if you're not then the healer knows this one of the few fights that actually uses diseases). 
---
it really only started being called dispel as a general sense when pretty much everyone could remove everything (and generally got effects the healers couldn't remove from being commonly used in PvE).
---
He’s awful bright
---
Thats fine, but as you said already if thats what he meant it makes no sense because a sub is a sub, and since you need to subscribe to play WoW Classic at all... an early access doesn't really work in that sense because everyone will just subscribe earlier; you can't have an early access like that.
---
I'm being charitable by giving OP the benefit of the doubt in assuming his point as some merit to it.
---
There are no really good reasons to do that. Why alienate most of the people who made the project happen in the first place... And all those people who wouldn't be able start early would catch up to most retail players and now you have the crowding issue further into the zones. Seems like a really bad idea to me... and I own BFA already.
---
Preach! We thought we did but we didn’t! Vanilla was awesome. We thought we wanted QoL changes but we didn’t!
---
They argue for it to be authentic but their authentic is not what the vast majority of people who played vanilla experienced.
---
You’d want to play differently than solos and duos  by playing to the strengths of your 5 player team. Find mob dense zones and kill them together, later aoe pulling everything. Whenever possible, grind elite mobs such as the elite ogres in the northeast of Loch Modan. Elites give double the exp. 
---
The really cool thing is, you might be able to speed run dungeons repeatedly, which can be extremely good if the questing areas are filled to the brim. With a good composition and being able to rely on your friends and great gear from dungeons might make this very possible.
---
It might all depend on your team composition.
---
Some got shafted, but I'd say that 4.3 Marksmanship specced Hunter was the pinnacle of the class in PvP.
---
Yeah I mean depending on how the competition on your server is, rank 10 I would say is reachable by everybody. Once you are at rank 10 you can decide to go hard for the upper ranks.
---
Dude. im not american. What the absolute fuck are you on about? You sure your mental health is okay?

Don't be TOO harsh on the dev team. While I think they made drastic changes too quickly and really do not like where they are now (LFD was the beginning of the end for me, though there were plenty of missteps before that) ... it would be hard to keep that "spark" alive for 15 years. They made a business decision... and, looking at the success of WoW, it's hard to argue that it was a bad one. I mean, even if they had kept to their original design principles, I am not sure what WoW would look like right now. I'm sure people would still be thirsting for vanilla...
---
That said... I am glad they realized (better late than never) that there is an audience for old school, nameless adventurer journeys...
---
Druid or Warlock? I played a rogue and druid to ~40 back in vanilla and a Warlock to maybe 30s on a private server back in 2012-13. I'm hoping to commit to Classic this time but realistically can't be sure I'll ever even get to 60 so I'm thinking I should prioritize the best leveling experience. Both seem to have a lot of utility. Warlock appeals for the solo leveling speed, druid for the mobility and role versatility in dungeons.
---
authentic is authentic
---
I was talking about subbing specifically.
---
Q2 ends on June 30th, Q3 begins July 1st. Blizzard could see a small bump for Q2 if they tied early access to a sub. Hence 'sub by x date get in on July 13th instead of July 16th'. SWTOR does that kind of thing all the time for expansions and other content, as an example.
---
I was also seeing it as a small reward for those of us still subbed who are interested in classic too.
---
That's awesome dude. I'm jealous
---
Probably something that Thaddius casts. ;-)
---
Phases And progressive itemisation. Most players never experienced the earlier patches and a lot of the ones that did weren't at 60 during them.
---
 Rag was never even downed until after after DireMaul came out so arguing for it to be delayed until people have time to kill rag is a bit silly.
---
Ah ofc the warrior+paladin is completley unkillable and there's absolutely no counterplay bullshit all over again.
---
IMO an open beta will detract from some of the launch hype. A closed beta to help work out bugs with a larger population would be fine though.
---
I'll tell my children of you one day. The man who came and was king of a sub, literally shaped the way we memed.
---
Reported.
---
\- Hard to put into practice. I'm sure at least one Person will fall behind, stop playing or not being around for some reason.... or the opposite, being super hardcore out leveling everyone
---
\- If it works, for the time it works, you will have potential for the best gear possible at your level
---
\- But you will much slower in total leveling speed
---
\- Faction doesn't matter. The classes you all play matter. Having that said, you should roll Horde.
---
He does it FOR FREE
---
This is taken from vanilla not a private server! See the link in my comment to good runs for evidence :)
---
Verne Troyer RIP.
---
Then they should be arguing for 1.0
---
I misspoke but my point still stands , your telling me you think a 30% chance to block 100% of an enemy’s attack 4 times won’t save you? I’ve tried this before, it doesn’t work. 
---
Without holy shield your health will drop and be like a shitty wack-a-mole game, please post a video of you tanking any dungeon with a ret spec and prove me wrong.
---
Ah, my charity went entirely to waste. Oh well
---
&gt; Don't use that old excuse "it evolved back then, therefore more changes are fine".
---
**"I wouldn't trust Blizzard to actually change it and fiddle around with the specifics"**
---
&gt;Would you say the same if TBC was called WoW 2? Then why call it classic? Not attacking just wondering what's the deal with your example...
---
would I say the same about what?
---
&gt;If blizzard didn't add Naxx before TBC, then it wasn't part of classic.
---
true, but classic would have been a worse game for it, and adding it (the exact way it was meant to be released) on the "classic server" years later would improve the game
---
&gt;You talk about OSRS approach
---
i didn't mention OSRS, i have never played it and know literally nothing about it
---
&gt;And most of all...Activision.
---
i'll once again respond with the first line of the comment you responded to:
---
I wouldn't trust Blizzard to actually change it and fiddle around with the specifics
---
These are great. Keep it up. I can hear it in Dwight's voice!
---
Meh ...
---
Hope not, looking forward to making new friends!
---
To be fair, it didn’t *suddenly* suck.  Blizzard took their time destroying the game.
---
Damnit I didn’t even see it lmfao
---
Conducting original research and taking an organized class is nothing similar to asking strangers to look shit up for your on the internet--but I wouldn't expect someone who uses university attendance as an insult to recognize that difference.
---
Bare with me, this is kind of of long and kind of dumb, but fun for me. My main was a Forsaken frost mage, full T2, couple pieces from AQ. I LOVE world PvP. Nothing better for me than having an impromptu battleground in the wild. In the game there is a vender trash set of cloth gear called Twill. All the slots and it looks like something a farmer would wear. So I would don the twill set and equip my fishing pole and head over to Sentinel Hill in West fall and just harass lowbie ally toons, maybe kill a quest giver. Now if you're familiar Westfall you'll know it's only like a 2 minute flight from Stormwind, so in no time at all, level 60's would start flying in to defend, switch gear and boom, we have a party. Now I got my ass beat a lot, just me against even a few halfway decent geared toons is really no contest, but it wasn't them I wanted. When the big brother 60's get there, all the lowbies not flagged for PvP would try and take pot shots soon realizing that it's damn near impossible to even hit a level 60 when you're level 12 let alone actually hurt them, but holy shit does one arcane explosion kill em all. 
---
Use to do this for hours. Am I an asshole? Maybe, but it sure as hell was fun.
---
than*
---
You know exactly what I mean, you just don't have any meaningful response so you're trying to deflect, because you know that you're peacing out as soon as the initial hype is done :)
---
In case you really are that stupid, by 'actual classic fan' I mean people who have been wanting this for a long time, and won't just peace out after finishing Elwynn.
---
AKA The opposite of people like you, who were not only indifferent, but actively shat on the Classic movement from the very beginning, in your case because you are afraid it's going to affect your bottom line - hope it does :D
---
Then don’t comment about the state of paladins lol, just post your opinion. Comments like that lead Blizzard to believe they are doing things right. 
---
TLDR: Paladins suck right now.
---
Ironically, new content is suppose to be for live.
---
Awesome idea!
---
&gt;Warrior will be plowed over with try hards.
---
What does this mean?
---
Yes this post so much. I am vaguely familiar with the show and my headcanon is now they are just screwing around at work waiting for classic.
---
I really hope not.... 
---
maybe for battlegroups? Im not really up to date on the PVP side.
---
Now I know why Esfand plays Paladin :)
---
I've had dual monitors at home and work since at least '02. My game is even higher now. Second screen is 4K HDR with a UHD disc player, Roku, and 3TB TIVO. Been working so well. Highly recommend.
---
I'll be leveling either while rewatching my fav 100 movies, fav SF TV series, or queue'ing up some SF TV series I have not seen. And with 4k res, can watch a streaming movie and have 3 different browser windows open at 1080 res at once if wanted. WoW on the ultrawide.
---
No we won’t and for good reason, xrealm is a large reason why retail sucks
---
They are just fools whose entire world shattered when Classic was announced. They'd spent 12 years berating anyone who wanted Classic, copy pasting the "wall of no" and mocking us, all while feeling Blizzard had their backs. 
---
Of course they're going to be giddly creaming themselves at any even remotely negative news concerning classic. Expect them to proliferate like bacterial scum on any threads about server imbalance, having issues finding groups, class imbalance etc... 
---
"SEE HAHAHAHHA U THOUT U DIDNT WANT GRUP FINDER AND LFR AND PHASING HAHEHEHRFA B UIT U DO CAALLSIC SUCCXXX HHAHAHE"
---
Make my words. This will happen.
---
I agree.  I'm currently unsubbed so a lot of the questions are not applicable currently.  That should probably be an initial question.
---
Pretty sure those are Kodo bones...
---
People in this comment chain are struggling with basic math and communication.
---
I cant disagree with you more, but you do you man.
---
Glad you're excited to play!
---
It makes me so happy that for a brief period when classic servers are launched, every single servers AHs will be completely empty. Everyone starts with 0 copper. So awesome to me, we as players will create an economy from doing quests and selling items to vendors and looting money off corpses. That to me is awesome, on modern WoW gold means absolutely nothing, but on the first few days of the release of classic anyone would be happy to get one gold piece to spend on a new skill or repairs :)
---
LOL yesterday i saw a priest and i was like WAAIT.... and he stopped turned around and buffed me and proceeded to walk
---
The only-cross server anything that existed in vanilla was cross server BGs and that was just to alleviate some awful queues on imbalanced servers. And even those were only per battlegroup.
---
I go back and forth on whether or not I want that. On the one hand, I have fond memories of friendships and rivalries cross faction. 
---
On the other hand I want to actually play a battleground more than one a day.
---
Ah, I never raided.  Makes sense.  Hope I get to see it this time around.
---
If you havent borne witness to how simple combat rotations and boss mechanics are in classic vs. retail you may be in for a short adventure. 
---
Exploring pre cata azeroth is interesting--is it two years interesting? time will tell. 
---
I fully intend to enjoy the 1-60 experience, my goal is to beat aq and naxx this time around. But ive got a past of raiding quite hardcore progression. Especially if new bnet is integrated, I dunno if I will be able to avoid the allure of M+ and mythic raiding on retail--especially once I have my preraid and I am staring at months of MC/Ony farming spamming 1 all night.
---
Hey guys. After finishing up my initial priest gearing guide and seeing how well-received it was, I decided to keep making some of these simplified phase 1 gearing guides. This time, I took an in-depth look at caster dps (particularly spriests, warlocks, and mages) and where the most gear can be obtained. 
---
This a general overview for casters, and of course there are some better items for specific classes (like some of the shadow gear in Scholomance for spriests and warlocks), so if you want to maximize your potential, I'd suggest finding a pre-raid BiS list instead. But if you're super-casual like me and want to get the most out of your dungeon runs, I think this guide will help you ;)
---
Let me know what you think! :)
---
What are you two on about? I can't see anything besides the watchtower.
---
Hahaha I will probably get to 60 before most of the people here. AND YEAH my bottom line is gonna be destroyed might as well walk to the unemployment line ahead of time. I already said that when anything new for retail releases I'm going to it. Why does this bother you? Dude 80% of streamers will be going back to other games. Be realistic
---
&gt;on modern WoW gold means absolutely nothing
---
This is what keeps me away from retail mostly. I love player driven economies and Vanilla definitely did a great job at making you poor and work for your money. In retail I literally just get gold thrown at me.
---
When the view consisted of a two-letter wall.
---
It's the melees responsibility to watch and monitor their threat.  Obviously it's a balanced game and each side has their pros and cons, but try to tell a horde melee they don't need WF and you're gonna have a bad time.
---
Also, [here's a link to the written guide](https://silvitesoltis.blogspot.com/2019/04/wow-classic-early-60-gearing-guide.html) if you'd prefer the text version.
---
Do a world quest and get 250 gold 😆 what a joke. Can’t wait for classic!
---
I imagine a lot of people would think "What bugs, didn't they sort those out 10 years ago"
---
Whether it's accurate or not, that's how I expect people to think
---
Female dwarf priest, yes
---
I will be doing pretty much the same thing.
---
But instead of mend pet it’s holy light and it will take me twice as long lol
---
1.21 JIGGAWATTS!?!?
---
Boo , you whore
---
You're missing the piont, the cap is the threat wind fury woudln't help them much
---
If you have a raid of people playing near the ceiling fury warriors depending on crits and other RNG can easily surprass ur tanks just doing max even with salvation. 
---
When they have no constant threat reduction that problem becomes even worse. Because again in a good raid the cap is the threat on DPS.
---
nope. that was added in TBC.
---
Status effect items are INCREDIBLY powerful and worth effort of farming if it covers a weakness you have.
---
The magic dust from the Dust Devils in Westfall can put enemies to sleep for like 30 seconds. And anyone can use them and it works on damn near everything alive (it's considered Arcane school also so resistance to it is rare) that isn't outright immune to sleep.
---

Either he edited his post or you completely suck at reading comprehency.

What he said:

&gt;seldom is a video actually exactly 10 mins (they're usually much longer or shorter depending on the topic. No 10:01's, 10:04’s, etc).
---
He edited it to be more clear after the fact. Which is fine.
---
I fear this battle would be one-sided. u/Provosorisk is to Reddit as Michael Jordan is to Space Jam - just way too op. I mean, MJ dunked from half court! Provosorisk got platinum memes. Hell, he got memes, of his memes! How do you beat that?? You don't. You simply don't.
---
I played horde until TBC and rolled an alliance warlock. The feeling of walking down the creepy bar to the warlock trainer in Stormwind was such a cool experience.

You obviously didn't read my last reply to you. I am not trying to become rich at others expense by any means. If you get onto a good early you can sell it for a larger price because you were the first person to farm those items and sell them. People who want to buy them at an inflated price early on can to gain an early advantage at the tradeoff of gold. If its too expensive just don't buy it (neither I or anyone else for that matter is forcing people to buy auctions) and if stuff doesn't sell the price will become lowered. 
---
It's fine if you want to disadvantage yourself by not using the auction house for what seems to be your slightly twisted take on classic purity? But don't try and shame others for just playing the game, playing the auction house is absolutely by no means a new thing.
---
Thanks :)
---
You don't miss the 18 hour AV matches? Lol ;P
---
Briarwood Reed is from Jed Runewatcher.
---
True, but I remember when this came out, not a lot of people were trying things such as expose armor - vanish - cold blood - ambush. It was a different game then, as were the videos and their appeal.
---
Shadow is ridiculous at the moment. Maybe at the start of BfA they were bad, but no longer my friend.
---
So all the people that actively broke TOS get invited to something? But preach gaming got banned for 30 days on live for using a leveling bug?
---
What the hell is a jiggawatt?
---
Giant Kodo, do you even lore?
---
I had 20 days played when I got to 30. I was not really a gamer at the time!
---
That's another thing I'm torn on lol
---
Mostly because of diminishing returns on honor kills in that case.
---
fuck. what a journey
---
I was slightly high lvl for sunken temple (I'm sure) but I tanked that bitch once as a shammy back in tbc-ish. Good times
---
I think Thottbot announced they're making a comeback for Classic. 
---
In the meantime everone uses www.classic.db
---
the return of thottbot and allakhazam!
---
So that's what happens when they leave the Goldshire...
---
druids are fast levelers too. The two classes have very different roles though, ranged DPS vs healer, which is more apealing to you?
---
I probably wouldn't play it they did.

This is from 2005. The guy who posted this might even be dead by now.

Surely a Kodo of that size wouldn't have so small of a head right?
---
Bad edit
---
it's part of a chain though, and has like 4 more quests after it.
---
&gt;Read the whole topic. Arena without at least some balance can't exist. 
---
when did I argue otherwise? the guy said "arena ruined pvp", and when pressed on how he gave an example of how something that isn't inherently tied to arena was the real reason pvp was ruined without actually presenting any argument against arena itself
---
I can’t even
---
nope, some people genuinely hated the idea of it. it's great when people that didn't even play back then try to give us their opinion of the game
---
Interesting is certainly a word used to describe things. This is not pne of those things *I* would use that particular word for, but to each their own.
---
P. H. R. E. S. H.
---
&gt; I guess I’m not too worried about micro transactions. I’m pretty sure they know it would kill Classic.
---
I'm assuming their hope is that classic players will try out the latest expansions and content updates on a regular basis. Then people will buy all their microtransaction stuff on retail and classic can avoid that.
---
Yep.
---
Well that’s the winning quality of vanilla. You can choose to power level, choose to take your time, choose to never get to 60 at all, the gameplay is satisfying and rewarding at all levels, not only when you’re at the cap.
---
You're making a general assumption about millions of people. Advertising would likely be worth it, even if it only captured 5%
---
Thottbot was merged into Wowhead -- they're now the same thing. WowHead has a Thottbot theme that you can access by heading to  [https://classic.wowhead.com/](https://classic.wowhead.com/) and logging in with your Fanbyte or [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) account.

I'm sure twitch content producers that go where the sellout takes them really care about the games they play.... Total not just in it for the money...
---
Im leaning for a priest aswell.
---
When I was in 7th grade my buddy and I went here and got drunk.
---
I remember my dad getting pissed off bc I kept saying how drunk I was and talking like a drunk person
---
There is always a backlash against just about anything that’s popular.  I like your videos, lots of other people like them too.  Just keep making stuff no matter what people make up about you.
---
Youll still be rich just 2-4 months down the road is all
---
What's wrong with caring and being passionate about the games you play AND making money? Tell me.
---
Blizzard themselves hated the idea of it, until they realised they could make money from it, which is why Blizzard likely told their community team to respond in this way.
---
Dunno what pservers you play on...but didn't happen to me ever
---
Almost everything on rogue works the same
---
I guess if you really wanted to do the raid content at the right level?
---
As someone who only uses YouTube and who thinks twitch culture is common... Why bother?
---
Dwight is a hardcore raid leader and guild master, but his guild is filled with casuals.
---
The fact this post and all the juciy leaked comments are going unnoticed is a shame, this exactly what the community needs lol
---
Same. I hate that I cant do two things at once, and it totally fucks me. The other downside is half of the fun is being able to voice chat with my buddies, which i cant do while watching netflix with my fiance, so typing "HOLY SHIT LVL 60 INC" isn't as exciting as talking about it live on voice.
---
if I were a betting man I would guess this is just his opinion..
---
Neither side is black or white.  It's a juvenile PoV to believe that Alliance is good just because they're the standard high fantasy races. Consider for a moment that the undead of Lordaeron,  former humans and elves themselves, aren't even consider people by the alliance,  and while the horde are slow to trust  they at the very least offered the undead asylum within their ranks. The Orcs are a peaceful spiritual race driven to bloodlust because the planet hopping draenei lured the burning legion to their home planet of draenor. They were sent to Azeroth and are just now beginning to clear the haze of demonic corruption. Their capital,  Orgrimmar,  is just a series of tents and mud huts,  but it's more than the race has had in a very long time.  The Trolls throw in their lot with Orcs,  sympathising with their loss of their ancestral home. The Tauren too were too peaceful for their own good,  being hounded to near extinction by the centaur tribes of kalimdor. 
---
You'll note that the horde don't have the luxury of century old cities built into the heart of a mountain,  grand cathedrals honouring their gods and sprawling cities of decorative stone.  The Horde barely has a home,  each race chased around the world and looking to settle down, hounded and murdered by the races that would call them monsters.
---
i didnt think i was being so subtle /shrug
---
That's newsworthy imo, considering none of the rumors/leaks have explicitly said "beta" they've all just been like "get excited for may! Stuff is happening soon!
---
Ah, understandable. Cheers :)

Nah staysafe and esfand are actually pretty knowledgeable tbh. Staysafe i think the most out of the bunch. Tips videos are good quality though cant knock the guy
---
I thought a beta already released. Am I wrong?
---
rather use pserver database than fucking wowhead.
---
I didnt know it had a formal name, I just thought it was a good idea! I'm gunna have to check that out thanks. Message me if you ever redo it, I'd love to help with the analysis/visualization.
---
I mean the wod raids were pretty good from what I heard but I never really raided past highmaul so I wouldn't know
---
Ohhhhhh shit i forgot running to deadmines. Farming [Cruel Barb] for twinks. So many memories.
---
Immediate downvote, how the hell are you going to say that the green post aged badly, it was 2013, cata and mop were still a huge success regardless of what people said, they still were huge in sub numbers. Plus no one really gave a damn about private servers back then, the only servers people played were wrath servers, no one played vanilla and no one liked vanilla servers. For some reason it just started hyping up like 1 year before classic announcement. And regardless, wotlk servers still destroy vanilla servers in population and hype. I don't consider this green post to be aged badly. Made perfect sense why he would say that.
---
Meh bad edit
---
Don't forget raging at guides and discussion videos being over 10 minutes. If a video is over 10 minutes the content is void and it's a MLM scheme for ad revenue.
---
Esfand dont sweat it dude. Your shits gonna explode once classic comes out. Your very likeable imo and your patience will pay off come classic
---
The two on the left are the only good ones 😞
---
For the Horde!
---
The music definitely takes me back to the time.
---
Sadly though, I never saw this video, and the pixelation hurts today...
---
If you ask most people what's the hardest part of their relationship, this is it. The restriction of freedom because of your obligation to your partner.
---
A relationship is a responsibility. And for the vast majority of WoW players, their partner just isn't into WoW or at least not as much as they are. And this is definitely a big source of friction because your partner will feel neglected if you spend prolonged period playing the game.
---
It sucks, but this is part of growing up. The funny part is, people used to make fun of you in WoW for not having a girlfriend. Ironically, getting into a relationship is one of the surest ways to severely limit how much WoW you can play.
---
This is godly and completely accurate
---
The other green above him has a similar but less explicitly-worded comment though. I work in this industry and I would guess that their community team, who is in contact with greens, relayed what they'd been told internally (i.e. we're not doing classic and private servers are illegal) as a sort of primer to handle these questions, but it's just a guess. A lot can change in 6 years.
---
No changes was always a fucking meme imo. It was going to have changed from the very start. The real question was to what degree and how
---
Upvote for master dog breed

Any post that said "Blizzard won't do X" or "Blizzard will do X" was always rubbish to me. You don't fucking work there, and you sure as shit don't make the decisions there.
---
Spell batching &gt; release date.
---
Spell batching is WAAAAAAAAAAAAAY more important.
---
The return of the blue rage bar Warrior!
---
Some things never change
---
I love Alliance starting zones. I feel like Orc/Troll start zones just can't compare to Dwarfs or Night Elves. Especially if you've played WC3. Man, getting to actually play as a night elf was just about the coolest fucking thing my teenage brain could experience.
---
Just finished my master's last week and start working full-time on June 3rd. Incredibly stoked for Classic but bummed that I won't be able to no-life it as hard as I'd like
---
Level 35 I believe.
---
Meh... bad edit
---
Well, I don’t mean to say that specific classes got *shafted* per se. I more mean the older class flavors got gutted. Like with hunters, Cata removed mana and added the focus bar. It may make for more “exciting” rotational gameplay, but I much prefer the original class fantasy. But to each their own, of course.
---
The only way to really use thottbot will be through WoWhead.  Personally, I'm just glad it was preserved somewhere and is currently being maintained.
---
What really surprised me and made me happy though was seeing the return of ShadowPanther!
---
I've seen some copied sites, but I just hope that El's Anglin and some of the other old sites make a return as well.
---
It’s a Kodog.
---
&gt;  blizzards customer service is trash
---
uh what, blizzard is pretty well known as having some of the best customer service in the business.
---
NOCHANGES
---
thats why not only am I using thottbot, I'm only using PC hardware available in 2006 and I'm going to throttle down my internet connection. Furthermore I'm going to insist all of my raid use Ventrilo
---
Wow, the quality difference is huge. For some reason I find it funnier in a lower resolution though
---
I'm so over all these 'this is everything we know so far' articles. They are everywhere. Stop bullshitting, you know fuck all and it looks unprofessional af.
---
Love the Kingdom Hearts character names. Riku’s one of my favorites from the game!
---
Cata was the first time I ever quit WoW. I played it from a month after Vanilla release continuously all the way through WotLK and then finally cancelled my sub 2 months into Cata because I hated how many iconic spells I lost. I always liked the fact that even though I was a frost mage, I could have at least a couple fire/arcane spells on my bar that had an important place. It might sound silly but losing arcane explosion and fireblast really bothered me, that and a few other issues made me quit and go play LoL until WoD dropped. I quit that after a few months too until Legion, which I actually liked and played a lot, then they shit the bed with BfA so. Like most of this sub, Classic can't come soon enough.
---
Ahhhh you got me! Well played sir - I had forgotten the lines. I must review this movie AT ONCE!!!
---
I mean it's only five days away so no worries.
---
This is valid, but hardly immunity against worries. You will have 2-3 years worth of classic, but if there is no classic in 3 years because greedy corporates have decided its not worthwhile, then - like is happening more and more now - the product we paid for and enjoy will get shut down.
---
Finally something other than blue posts to look forward too!

Yeah my first unsub was after a few months of Dragon Soul. The LFR and gameplay elements were pretty shitty, but disregard that. Dragon Soul is still the worst piece of feces Blizzard has ever put their name on, in the history of their company.

I was watching a stream and the streamer was making the claim so I thought I’d ask
---
You don't block 100% of an attack. You block an amount based on your block value. 30% chance to absorb ~150 damage per hit. 
---
We'll call it an average of 45 damage per hit, assuming you have Holy Shield up for every single attack that touches you. If you think that not having that 45 less damage on every attack is causing your health health to "drop like a shitty wack-a-mole game" then I don't really know what to tell you.
---
named chad?
---
Summer numbers were always low in comparison to the when school is in. Also the release is going to be around aug 20.
---
Streamer was talking about the sharding server effect because the dev water cooler explained that the server technology from BFA is being used for classicWoW
---
Honestly, with no release date, I'm good with The Office/Classic mashup memes for now
---
You got me at “El Ninjo.” I swear we’re going to see that being tossed around in Trade Chat soon.
---
thank you
---
&gt; Why are you so concerned with the right to feel bad about dying virtually?
---
When I am bored I poke people with weird views on the internet. Sometimes I learn something. Sometimes they learn something. Mostly they get upset like you are doing.
---
&gt; I'm more concerned that you want to limit other people's free will to fight.... on a server specifically designed to simulate a war between 2 factions...
---
Because you are upset you are making up all sorts of silly things.
---
I have not said anything here about what you should or should not be able to do. I haven't even said anything about what you should or should not do.
---
I've just poked your weird attempt to assert that people aren't allowed to like some consequences of free-for-all PvP but not all consequences of free-for-all PvP, in a world where the only choices are Normal servers or free-for-all PvP servers.
---
Yeah, but where's the puppy?
---
I'm using ClassicDB personally. A lot less ads appear than ~~Wowhead~~ "Thottbot."
---
Just don't click any links in the comments. It's otherwise safe.
---
Yeah, yeah, but where's the puppy?
---
This is pure nightmare fuel.
---
\*yawn\* just get yourself a goldshire retriever...
---
Fuuuck my plans of no lifing are ruined. I actually shed a tear
---
You shut your dirty mouth with that August shenanigans.
---
/s
---
I enjoyed that I am the villain in this gif.
---
It is a huge difference though and has many positive implications. An example would be to consistently drop special materials from bosses that are required to craft the gear, plus the recipees would drop with a similarly low chance we have now for gear pieces.
---
First of all it adds consistency to the loot system. Good loot needs to be scarce and require alot of investment but controlling that solely with low drop rates is IMO bad design for gear, because they are inherently unfair and create the slot machine effect.
---
Randomness and luck are an interesting game design concept if the time commitment and the event frequency are in a reasonable ratio. For example many successful indie games use randomly generated content and events to increase replayability, force interesting decisions and adaptability on their players and to increase excitement over rare events. But those are often designed around minutes or maybe a couple of hours playtime. The frequency of the random events is high enough for the player to get a reasonable sample size in a relatively short period of time.
---
Now with WoW this isn't the case. The time investment from the player side and the rarity of the events are just not healthy to be honest. The *scarcity* is a core concept that is important for the value of the loot but that doesn't mean it has to be completely tied to a random drop. You could also just slowly but steadily getting your crafting materials together. These incremental rewards would motivate players more and give them the opportunity to actually choose which items to craft first. This type of customization is generally fun. Guilds could also work together in a more organized manner and distribute the loot more efficiently and/or fairly.
---
The second point is that it would increase the value of every dungeon/raid over the whole lifespan of the game, because people would be able to gather these materials and trade them or trade the crafted items directly. Surely in the first few months of farming a dungeon/raid nobody would do that, because you first want to gear up your guild. But after a while this would create an interesting, player driven catchup mechanic for alts, casual players and players who came late to the party, or simply players who want to focus their time on other things like open world content. It would also be interesting for recipees to require materials from all over the place, some from raid X some from Y, some from a 5man dungeon and a good chunk of regular open world materials too. Such a system would neatly tie everything together across all tiers of play and consistently reward players from casual to hardcore.
---
Well get out and spread the word!
---
...he obviously has no idea what a goldshire retriever is
---
Reminds me of Lakmaren (prob spelling that wrong) off the coast of Feralas on that island thats no longer there.
---
A midsummer release isn’t off the table. Keep in mind, Classic is a b-side product to Blizzard. It was only even mentioned in name in an earnings call this last quarter. Anything more than 2 weeks for beta could be unnecessary. They likely need to stress test more than fix various bugs. Also, more than 2 weeks could kill a little bit of the hype train that is chugging at full force right now. 
---
And just as there is a shorter beta, there will be a shorter window of date reveal to release. It’s just a different game and a different process to them. It might be past July 16 at this point, but I wouldn’t rule it out until the week of May 16 passes.
---
...gotta get a goldshire retriever, man
---
August seems like a realistic release date. Summer doesn't technically start until June 21st, so I imagine if thats how Blizzard is quantifying "Summer", I wouldn't expect Classic in May or June.
---
nooooooo D=
---
Yesss stop the office memes
---
but we're getting 1.12 and wowhead existed by then
---
I've never liked the office...honestly, not one pleasant memory or enjoyment from the show.  Cringe humor just isn't for me.
---
But!  I say let them have their fun.
---
Obviously this crowd is enjoying it : )
---
Go check out u/Provosorisk posts
---
Theres been some unverified rumours yet some credible speculations that have surfaced today that Classic creators were invited to a Blizzard building to test out a beta for Classic. Rumours are that the next blue post (possibly tomorrow) will be about a beta that will come next week.
---
 DON'T TAKE MY WORD FOR IT, research a little yourself and make your own conclusion
---
Hey we're trying to help okey?
---
For real, man. I farmed that thing forever.
---
Trust me I’m so pumped to start setting up dkp and running zul gurub just for mounts with a few cool dudes.
---
If you don’t have any aspirations to heal or tank, a mage is a great choice. They have amazing damage, provide buffs and water/food, and have excellent utility, in group or solo. Frost nova roots everything in place, you have a short term short range teleports, you have teleports and portals to major cities. You can turn a creature into a sheep whjch is very useful.
---
I’m not trying to sell you on it, just explaining their pros! It’s a very popular class. In the end though, choose what interests you the most.
---
Nice shots Tommy, these all brought back some feels.
---
Countryyyyy rooooooooads
---
Taaaake me hoooooooome
---
That hasn't been true for years now unfortunately. They sure were known for it before, though.
---
No, you are not wrong, but it is internal to the dev's, their friends and families or something.
---
My goal is to farm Kel’Thuzad so many times every caster in my guild has an atiesh.
---
Props for the effort you put into the community.  2 constructive feedbacks: limit the phase "and stuff like that" to 1 per video max.  2nd, when Im watching your videos where you are interviewing someone and you are watching your monitor tuned out to what your interviewee is saying, as a viewer I lose interest.  If what they are saying isn't interesting enough for you to even feign paying attention then it's hard to imagine it making the final cut for a video.
---
Cheers!
---
But I’ve been playing it for years on private servers.... the only pathetic thing here is you lmao.
---
Hmm ok I can get behind that, what specific places are you talking about for farming those grey items?
---
Exactly what it is. Clickbait
---
Yeah, I agree. The beta isn't going to be a long thing, and its not to test the content obviously. Its primarily a server stress test, and it will let them prepare and dial in how much sharding there is going to be on launch.
---
The "beta" will probably just be one weekend. I could even see it as being short as one day, if they really want to stress their servers that would do it.  
---
Personally, I'm expecting an August release date. If they really wanted to be #NoChanges, it won't come out until August 22nd, which is when patch 1.12 was released.
---
Good boi!
---
Everytime I or someone I've known has contacted support in the last 10 years they've had their problem immediately solved, and blizz has gone out of their way to rectify whatever it was, even if it wasn't protocol.  
---
I would argue that receiving bad customer service would put you in the extreme minority in that regard. Granted I am talking only about tickets.  
---
I don't consider those mouth breathing forum MVP's as customer support
---
Don't make me get my main on your dirty august ass :P
---
Dun Morogh is sex on a schnitzel
---
To be fair you were against classic for AGES
---
Reponding nly the last 2, because it is spam at this point. Viewing, no. What is your point? 
---
You responded to me, responding to this shitty post.
---
If you make that, you gotta upload pictures!
---
You'll be popular over at Goldshire Inn
---
This is one hell of a post. Not that I read it, but there are so many words!
---
Really it's going to have to be a brand new scrape and database I'd imagine. Having a button to see original thottbot comments would be cool but I think there'll be enough data differences that trying to merge the droprates/spawn points and other data of all Vanilla with Classic will lead to some pretty funky stuff.
---
Yup my hype died already. had to tell my vacation days to my boss over a month ago. i won't step in the land of azeroth (sitting in my basement all summer) again. Tbh vanilla back then and vanilla pservers were fairly enouch. Get dem downvotes coming i couldnt care less about this game at this point.
---
Thanks, I  honestly tried watching the show about a decade ago, when it was relevant but it was just boring and unoriginal.
---
I've accepted my crucifixion for speaking out against the norm. here on Reddit.
---
Can you expand on your methodology for determining B?
---
My God, I would die if Bryan Adams performed this as an advert for Classic release
---
No aspects, no seals, no stances? It is sacrilege to even SUGGEST that Retail is WoW. Idk what it is, but it sure as hell isnt WoW.
---
Blizzards customer service has single handedly saved my account on multiple occasions. Even when my account was stolen and used for botting they knew it wasn't me and got all my stuff back. I don't like Blizzard but their customer service is pretty great.
---
The pic just warmed my heart
---
Gaming journalism is such hot garbage
---
It's a reference to an awful ancient American TV show.
---
shhhhhh, he's a good boi
---
http://classicdb.ch/?search=Felcloth
---
Vanilla WoW is the most casual iteration of the game. If you want to be a hardcore raider, or a high rank PvPer, obviously not. But in general, you can do a lot and have so much fun when just logging in at your pace.
---
There aren't any daily quests that need doing. There isn't a fear of missing out on anything if you can't log in, or just decide you don't want to today. You never feel like you're missing out on necessary progress.
---
There are tons of people who just do some dungeons, level alts, play battlegrounds, and/or just enjoy playing the Auction House to gain as much gold as possible.
---
ahh yes, had a OG Alzheimer moment
---
nooooooo! he's a good boi
---
Yeah and with some of the updated loot phase 1 / 2 where rogues run rampant they will fall off even harder.
---
Elitists be like "ya but is he pure-bred?"
---
DAE like classic wow? Unpopular opinion, but I am excited to play this game.
---
No goldshire retriever? DOWNVOTE!
---
Weapon skill doesn't do anything in pvp so if thats what your going all of the races have perks.
---
Honestly my most nostalgic starting zone. That snowy landscape is just too good.
---
Well *technically* there are aspects, but from what I remember from playing a free weekend last year they're like 10-second buffs with 5 minute cooldowns.
---
Against the law? HAHAHHAHA
---
No doggo, no upvote
---
cata -&gt; wod was an absolute shitshow that lost more than half the subs, which eventually led to wow sub numbers stopped being reported. 
---
\&gt; no one played vanilla and no one liked vanilla servers. For some reason  it just started hyping up like 1 year before classic announcement.   
---
nostalrius goes down 2016, wow classic announced 2017
---
You can gnomish cloaking device into eat / meld during fight and get to full while they fuck with your pet.
---
We will see
---
Personally I think its gonna do great at the start but were gonna lose 50%-90% of people who sub to start to see it but then unsub after the first couple months, possibly returning but not on a regular basis
---
I think it will be delayed
---
If it gives you an idea to how good the journey aspect is of older WoW I joined in 2.0 (pre patch for tbc) and I never reached cap and did end game content until like 3.2 WotLK. You just do things for fun
---
??? Go look up sub numbers for cata and mop. They were still a huge success buddy. Wod was the only reason subs stopped being reported and it was still projected to have atleast 5m subs still. My points are still valid and will continue to be until disproven
---
As 'unprofessional' as his speech is, he's not wrong, in the sum of his point.
---
Using Taladril's threat sheet located here:  [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRVNabnxWQoq4Ya\_cNDMKuZJwf9zbfzWhe3qf6d08gEk3OuJJ\_z\_zgERPRaDioAGux14ORx6thE6Hub/pubhtml#](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRVNabnxWQoq4Ya_cNDMKuZJwf9zbfzWhe3qf6d08gEk3OuJJ_z_zgERPRaDioAGux14ORx6thE6Hub/pubhtml#) 
---
Go to Threat tab and look at Ultra Threat. This is with everything, blessings, totems, etc.
---
Human Warrior: 1321 TPS
---
Tauren Warrior: 1442 TPS
---
The warrior with windfury does have higher TPS, but it's only about 8.5% more. Now consider that all of your dps on Alliance have 30% less threat than they do on Horde and it's clear to see there is significantly more headroom, especially for melee which don't get Tranquil Air.
---
Tranquil Air does mostly close the gap for casters at 20% + 8.5% vs 30%, but there is another issue to consider. Shamans are pretty bad. They are marginally better healers than druids, and not very efficient. If you want all your dps and tanks to have either WF or TA, you need at least 7 of them. Then you'd have an 8th group of priests/druids, but they don't get mana spring unless you have an 8th shaman. Alliance needs only 4 paladins to cover the main blessings. This means you can use more of the best healer in vanilla, priests. A raid with 7-8 shamans sounds dreadful.
---
Every group that has a shaman for windfury is less optimal than an alliance group with blessings, due to being pure groups, not 4 dps and a healer. Consider a potential horde group, feral offtank/cat, fury, rogue, hunter, resto shaman. Consider a potential alliance group, feral, fury, fury, rogue, hunter. An extra warrior is getting the feral and hunter buffs where they would not as horde. You are getting better synergy, especially if you do not have the required 7 shamans.
---
Lastly, consider the impact of blessing of wisdom. You can dps from anywhere, instead of being restricted to a 30 yard range. Many shamans do not drop mana spring while chain pulling trash packs and if they do, they don't always keep it in range, but blessing of wisdom is always there, ticking away. Casters are drinking less, dpsing more, clearing faster. With the combination of paladins being vastly more efficient healers, and the uptime on blessing of wisdom being higher (on average) than mana spring, you can raid with fewer healers because they can afford to use stronger spells via less regen gear, or higher ranks of heals. Fewer healers means more dps can join the raid.
---
I think people are just scratching the classic itch however they can until we get a release date.
---
I'm confused, where's the dog?
---
Excuse me, do you have a moment? I would like to share with you the good news of my lord and saviour WoW Classic!
---
Ridge Huntresses in Badlands
---
august 24 will be release, quote me ;)
---
Hahaha! Now that’s the way to do it!
---
AHAHHA  you gonna hand out a pamphlet too?  That's great
---
Yes
---
in &lt;x&gt; weeks i’ll be coming home from work to eat your dinner, kiss your wife then spend 3 hours sniping all ur mobs from u on my hunter thats 1 lvl higher than urs
---
Well played - I was like "dang, I never heard that before" but then dismissed it, because I felt like Blizzard ruined WoW lore during Cata
---
release date august 24 i think
---
That's why my profs are herb/alchemy. As a priest that's pure money...literally
---
Blizz groupies, in a bad way.
---
If there even is a beta I can’t see it being very long. People are quick to forget that classic wow is already established game for the most part. Yeah they have updated textures and models but the majority of the code most likely remains unchanged from patch 1.12.
---
sharding ≠ phasing
---
You should be able to kill mobs *more* than 5 times faster than a soloer, because you can use the strengths of each class (have a dedicated puller, a tank which gets a lot of rage, healers don't get spell interrupted and don't have to shield [priest] or kite, etc...)
---
&gt; 8K porn

"Don't care how much of a porcelain goddess she is; if I can't see the pores on that bitch's ass cheeks I just can't get off!"
---
\#nochanges
---
I'm working on my Classic laugh. I want it to be pretentious and arrogant but not TOO pretentious and arrogant.
---
I'm expecting july or august. 8.2 will most likely be june and 8.2.5 in september (if they keep up their 90 days between patches). Makes sense to launch classic between those two patches instead of too close to either.
---
You want to invest 8 days played to level an alt to farm cloth? When you could just go disc and heal dungeons fine and still farm well, then respec once you have what you need. He’ll just roll shadow till 60, respec disc/holy to farm and heal dungeons for bis then respec holy to raid.
---
BRILLIANT!!! Someone give this man an award.
---
I'm sure they were also told to post redundantly after one another.
---
Whether or not shadoweave is worth making depends on what you currently have equipped and if you think it's worth it to put in the time and effort required
---
&gt;Is there such a thing as a " Beginner-class" ?
---
People like to argue about skill floors/ceilings of Vanilla classes... but to be honest they're all pretty easy in terms of leveling and raiding. Just pick whatever looks cool to you, you will be 100% fine. There is zero risk of you getting to a high level if 5 days played time and you realize "this class is too hard for me". That will not happen.
---
There are classes that have an easier/faster time leveling, but it isn't hard on any class and I personally wouldn't pick a class based on leveling speed or ease of leveling. However, if you want that information; Hunters, Warlocks, and Druids tend to have the fastest and smoothest leveling experience. 
---
Warriors and Paladins tend to have slower leveling experiences, but again, it doesn't matter. It really doesn't unless you're trying to speed to 60 for some reason. If it looks cool to you play it.
---
&gt;But between Horde and Alliance, is there any differences 
---
Not really. Some minor racial traits. Some cities are closer to key locations on each faction, but you're not going to be missing out on anything by playing one faction over the other. The biggest difference is Paladins is an Alliance only class, and Shaman is a Horde only class. So unless you want to play Shaman, you won't miss anything rolling Alliance.
---
&gt;how hard for a beginner it is to begin raiding 
---
It might seem daunting because you've never played the game, but it isn't hard at all. The hardest part is just finding the right guild for you, but even then you can just do Pick Up Groups. Raiding is pretty simple, there are guides for every raid if your interested. 
---
It mostly boils down to stand here or don't stand there, and press your damage button at the boss. Or press your heal button on your allies. 
---
*TL:DR;* Just pick what looks fun! The game really isn't that hard. There isn't any class that is so hard that you'll find yourself struggling later in the game.
---
You're going to overcompensate by coming here twice as much, fretting twice as much, and burning yourself out
---
You're in good company
---
You monster. Also that is hilarious, well played.
---
"This community would be dead without those youtube videos, or streamers and content creators who have relationships with Blizzard giving feedback and RELAYING YOUR feedback to them."
---
You wildly overestimate your own power there friend.
---
5+ years ago, this was correct. Lately the quality has absolutely plummeted and there are posts more or less weekly on /r/wow about it.
---
Oh look, [there's one on the frontpage literally right now.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/bmiiok/my_shadows_edge_appearance_disappeared_so_i_made/) And [one of the top comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/bmiiok/my_shadows_edge_appearance_disappeared_so_i_made/emwvurf/) even notes that the first response you'll get is usually automated. [Here's another one from two days ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/blsmlu/gm_solution_after_giving_bad_feedback_on_survey/) where the guy didn't get any help until he left negative feedback on the support he received (lmao)
---
Unfortunately, your experience is the minority these days.
---
You are so full of yourself.  Without you and the other content creators the world wouldn't blink. You should be thanking the people who support you sharing the game and that's it.  There are far more people that will play the game than those who pay any attention to "content creators".  Your ego is absurd.
---
Sorry if you think so, I'm not too well-informed with WoW as a game and thought it'd might. I just needed to know how important sociability was for your class roles in Classic WoW also, unless in classic WoW there's no class trinity.
---
You read nothing. This had nothing to do with me. Everything to do with content creators who helped this movement. I excluded myself in the damn post.
---
It was unique - right? I can't recall running into that music anywhere else.
---
So what are you loving about the game? Seems like you find it mildly enjoyable and not much more.
---
Used to have.
---
You're not wrong, this sub loves to jerk off anything remotely negative about blizz. A random 'mvp' said something about vanilla 6 years ago, lmao
---
Typical gibmeupvotes NPCs
---
I also fell for the click bait, made it to that exact sentence, exclaimed "fuckers" and then left.
---
Stupid sexy orc..
---
Isn't this how it works when retail releases an xpac?
---
I second this advice! I'm actually doing something very similar: Holy Priest main and Warlock alt because heals are much more needed than DPS.
---
The "but" annoys me the most...
---
Actually... now I gotta go make one...
---
I would not bring a Hunter in there.
---
DOWNVOTE!
---
Rogues can stealth and pause the game for irl shit, warriors gotta warrior though the shit

It is

Don't waste time with him.. "eVeRy ViDeO iS jUsT a cOmPiLaTiOn Of CrItS aNd TrInKeT pRoCs" lol...
---
Not at all what I said. There are a small # of greens tho and they'll all likely wanna chime in to maintain their green-hood.
---
Hey guys, let me know your thoughts- this is my first WoW article for Dignitas and I'd love to hear your feedback :)
---
&gt; And 
---
&gt; one of the top comments
---
&gt;  even notes that the first response you'll get is usually automated
---
no the first response is not automated... it's a level 1 GM, like entry level, likely the level with high turnover rate, the people who aren't expected to know everything.  
---
And it's very likely he just misunderstood what the problem was as the two items names are quite similar.  
---
   
---
As for your second link, it was not possible for them to restore because like they said it was removed from the DB, you can think that's a made up excuse all you want but that's how programming works. Because they didn't want a complaint they broke protocol and just spawned the items instead.   
---
It's pretty common knowledge that the first level of any customer support is the least qualified, to have the more knowledgeable/level 2/3 agents available for more important issues.  
---
But again, I never stated that 100% of their support is the best, I simply said that having a negative experience with customer support puts you in a very small minority.   
---
You're just part of the *retail bad blizzard bad* crowds without actually stopping to look at facts. Hate the game and company all you want, but you can't just refuse to acknowledge what they do well because you don't like them.
---
Meh
---
Tauren/Orc Shaman or ?race? Hunter for solo (w)PvP? Why?
---
Ever since I was a little niño I wanted to be WoW man and now I’ve found my opportunity.
---
Weirdest boner I've had in at least a week or two.
---
I mained a female gnome prot warrior for most of my WoW career. I'd say it's the most underrated race/class combo.
---
So you take the red shirt with the binoculars and you toss them over the castle wall, for reasons of misinformation.
---
I swear to god if they ninja-release it without giving me the time to get a week off work like I've been planning, I'll be livid.
---
Sometimes I think the no changes people are the same peoples as the wall of no people. At first they were the wall of no and then when Blizz said yes to Classic they were like OK then we will shift our no strat to no changes. Clearly there is some changes are already happening just with the phases and graphics. Maybe 16 debuffs due to hardware limitations of the time period should also be "adjusted" to the debuff limit Blizz originally desired. I know Warlocks would appreciate using our corruption spell.
---
It takes a good season or so to get into. I didn't like the characters at first either, thought they were annoying and unfunny. But kept going, then before I knew what happened I realized I loved every single one of them.
---
&gt;You're just part of the retail bad blizzard bad crowds without actually stopping to look at facts. Hate the game and company all you want, but you can't just refuse to acknowledge what they do well because you don't like them.
---
Jesus christ... Do you listen to yourself? Blind fanboyism is _not_ good. Companies are not your friend. 
---
The sad affairs of Blizzard customer support is pretty well known these days, plenty of posts to back it up. You're the one pretty clearly disregarding any and all evidence. Where are these "facts" you speak of, person who clearly have no clue how any of this works?

Shall we begin to create the Church Of Classic Wow?

Give me till tomorrow and I’ll have a pamphlet to distribute! I’ll be sure to tag you lol
---
I’d think around 50% attrition is a good bet after six months.  REF for sure, but I think it’s realistic.  Server choice is gonna be pretty important.
---
I am serious lol make a bunch i'll film myself passing them out lol

Yeah no shit, you can play way more than most people here.

So? You're still going to be playing a game that you've been shitting on, when we needed people like you to stand with us (or at least not against us). You were one of the anti-legacy content creators while that was happening. Changed your tune real quick didn't you. 
---
Every content creator that has been speaking out against Blizzard opening vanilla servers will be making content for it, with their tail between their legs like they weren't shitting on the core fanbase for Classic just a year or so ago.
---
&gt; Why does this bother you?
---
Seriously? Because you're two-faced as fuck :) 
---
Almost everyone who will make content is going to play both versions (I played every single retail expansion), and so will I. 
---
The reason cases like yours 'bother' me, is hypocrisy. You were real far up Blizzards asshole when it looked like there's no chance Legacy servers would be a thing, and you're surprised people here don't like you?

Oh it’s on!
---
All three healers will do well with your friends. So if you're at all leaning toward one class fantasy over the others, absolutely go for that class. Gotta enjoy the game!
---
Other things to consider are what your game goals are. There's need for all three if you're going to raid. If you're planning on dungeons and PvP, then I might suggest Shaman because the 30/0/21 elemental spec will be a solid healer with fun bursty PvP damage. If you're going to do lots of BGs, druid might be a fun choice because they're great flag runners in WSG and the ability to stealth as a healer in world PvP or AV/AB is a lot of fun as well. 
---
If you're going to be doing a lot of farming so you can afford constant respecs at 60 to switch to a different build when you're not healing, keep in mind that enhancement shaman and hunters share gear. 
---
Priests are the most versatile healers, shaman provide more varied support options through the totems, and druids have the most involved personal playstyle with their shapeshift options.

Didn't tipsout leak info on his discord and now awaits blizzards lawyers lol
---
Imagine if they made actual tv commercials... or maybe YouTube ads would be more fitting.
---
It's a good summary of the classes, viewed through the lens of an upcoming Classic release, but it can't be called a guide. It's just too brief and vague for that. This is the content creation version of "previously, on Breaking Bad..."
---
I dont take information from a horde warrior who puts sharpening stone on his main hand
---
Not only that, but during vanilla, defensive mode was mad bugged on pets. You essentially had to keep your pet on passive, and them to attack on a keybind to have your pet not break your CC. It was very annoying.
---
That's great! We have to spread the word!
---
Survival is a very good mid tier spec for pvp.
---
gotcha gotcha
---
Where's the dog?
---
I had the exact opposite experience with my Diablo 2 account. Blizzard wouldn't even give me the time of day. They claimed I used some sort of a cheat/hack program, and that there is nothing they would do for me. I've literally never used anything of the sort, and my account wasn't even compromised. But that's that. They made their decision and didn't care what I had to say.
---
&gt; august 24 will be release, quote me ;). but i wish it would come out in july
---
RemindMe! 12pm August 24
---
The hype is generated by the WoW community and is isolated by the wall that seperates us nolifes from society. Those who have quit the game and forgotten about it are not refreshing this subreddit every hour like I am because they have no idea it even exists.
---
In the LoL streaming scene, there are some content creators that legitimately (and openly) hate their jobs, and they average a lot more viewers than our man here. 
---
It's not all about the money though, so if Towelliee still enjoys WoW, it's a pretty sweet gig honestly.

FYI I don't like the guy at all, but let's not pretend like managing to support yourself by playing video games all day is the worst thing of all time.

Paladin is considered the beginner class and that was its role in early stages of the game.
---
Warrior is going to be the most played class, and most warriors will be tryhards.
---
He looks like a fatter neckbeard bro version of Kevin from the Office.
---
The phrasing could have been better, I'll admit. I meant that the Vanilla players quit the game AFTER Vanilla when it started to suck (in their opinion). You can't deny that after every expansion there's a good chunk of the WoW community that believes the game is suddenly ruined.
---
alt-right "twitch gamer" edgelords are permanently brain damaged unfortunately
---
Bad phrasing. I meant they left the game after Vanilla when they thought it started to suck.
---
Yeah, they admit the whole article was click bait and then try to go back on it. Grrr
---
Exactly! People who stopped playing 10 years ago and have completely forgotten about the game are not frantically refreshing this subreddit like I am because they don't know it's a thing (and also they have lives).
---
Orc is probably preferable for the Axe bonuses and Hardiness, but Warstomp is good too. I wouldn't knock anyone if they picked Tauren cause they like they way they look more.
---
Troll is probably the weakest of the PvP Shaman races, but Berserking is objectively better for Resto PvE. 
---
You can't really go wrong as Hunter for world PvP. There so good in an open environment. For Horde race, you can't really go wrong. Hardiness is good in general, plus you get some bonus pet damage. WarStomp is always good in PvP. Again, even with the Bow bonus, I think Troll comes up weakest here.
---
I put in a support ticket to get my Diablo 2 account unbanned, after it was banned for completely illegitimate reasons. The first support ticket was immediately closed without any response. The second support ticket got a response, but it was simply someone telling me they will not do anything to restore my account, and then immediately closed the ticket so that I couldn't respond. 
---
Third ticket I had a conversation, they said they had logs that I had used cheating software, which was patently false. I explained this to them, and asked for the logs. They declined and closed the ticket.
---
Yup. That's some really great support. This was back in 2011. Not even that recent. They've been shit for quite some time.
---
Hey look. Another person who thinks private servers were like live.
---
What about the lightpost jump in SW like you're going to the Mage quarter- you all through the map, land below SW and you can run to searing gorge
---
how else would i know they lost half the subs from cata to wod? 
---
wod didn't ruined the game single handedly, the bleeding started from cata continuously.
---
i'm not disputing high sub numbers. 
---
You were acting like no one was interested in private servers back then. I'm saying hundreds of thousands players per month were quitting, so high subs is irrelevant.
---
A random dude? Seems legit
---
Eh I had a bad customer support experience with Blizzard in 2011. They've been shit for longer than 5 years.
---
Thoughts? Hate to say the obvious, but you didn't give anything new away.
---
Depends on what you plan to do at 60.
---
&gt;Warlock appeals for the solo leveling speed
---
Druids actually level quite a bit faster. More mobility, they're less gear reliant, and they have more mobility which is the big thing.
---
If you plan to raid, pick Warlock if you want to DPS. If you want to heal pick Druid. You can also tank in raids as a Feral Druid, despite what this subreddit might lead you to believe. Feral DPS or Boomkin is possible, but is far far less likely than the other two.
---
Really it depends on what you want out of the game. Personally I would love to roll a Druid, but that would mean betraying my Horde roots and I've never been able to play a Cow for more than 10 levels.
---
Gorefiend represent
---
Barren roooooooooaaaaaaadssss take me hoooooooome.
---
&gt; lemme make my 6 figs in peace
---
Oof, now there's an insecure individual lol
---
Solo? Probably Rogue. 
---
Healer with you? Warrior for sure. Pretty common for Warriors and healers to go duo dungeons and split the loot.
---
this subreddit would have some useful information posted
---
The "wall of no" people were the worst kind of people.
---
There are no other words than amazement for what my eyes just witnessed.
---
Never gets old
---
&gt; Needless to say learning to respec into Ret and use a fatty 2h around level 40 felt like I was ZOOMING
---
That's a bit funny because Protection is by far the fastest leveling spec for Paladins and it becomes viable around 40 when you get Holy Shield, so you basically reversed the order for yourself.

I've never seen his stream, but from what you said it sounds like this dude is the discount SoloRenektonOnly of WoW. Hilariously disproportionate ego. They kind of look similair imo as well
---
They're going to answer that question in patch 12.7.
---
I did the same exact thing on my 1st character. Just farmed scarlet monastery as a prot pally dps over and over
---
hey mate! i appreciate the feedback- i'll try and adjust the title in future to better meet the content of the article :)
---
Someone didn't read the nda very well.
---
You missed it the last 20 times it was posted this month?
---
I was thinking about this as well then panic set in because I would like a beta key and I was like oh screw it I'll resub and play a little haha.
---
thanks for your thoughts dude- it wasn't really my intention to give anything new away, rather recap the basic nuances of the classes we know and love from vanilla, but i appreciate it nonetheless :D
---
There are often more raid spots for Shaman. Horde will often bring as many geared resto Shaman's as they have access to, only up to 8 obviously. They put down relevant totems for their group and then they mostly spam chain heal for most of the raiding progression.
---
Priests are actually more valuable on Horde then they are on Alliance imo. Priests are the only source of dispeling magic on the Horde as they have no Paladins. They have the biggest healing toolkit; fast/small heals, medium/medium heals, slow/big heals, HoT, some AoE healing. 
---
They have an answer for a lot of things, always need a sizable handful for raids.
---
Druids are under appreciated. Raids typically only bring 1-3, so there isn't as much room for Druids, but Druids are underplayed on both factions so its can be challenging to fill that spot. Battle Res, Innervate, and MotW are all amazing utility, and while they don't top the heal charts, they also do respectable healing.
---
They can do very well on healing if they're the only druid in the raid by dropping HoTs across the raid, but some of that will probably end up as overheal.
---
Druids are probably the most fun healer, in a general sense of the game because you can do so much outside of raids in Resto spec. However, in raids your mostly casting Rank 4 Healing Touch, and that can be a bit boring for some people. But its like this for a lot of classes, you end up casting 1-2 spells in raids.
---
Congratulations, you are the first redditor whose name I would know as a particular person purely by their content.
---
If you do the wetlands death run the right way you'll pick up the flight paths, which make it a little easier to go back and train early on.
---
They are just groupies for the corporation
---
Orc is probably better for Hardiness and Command, but if you prefer the way Tauren's look War Stomp is always a good PvP ability. I wouldn't blame anyone for picking Tauren, War Stomp is great.
---
Lol man I was thinking the same thing. Was honestly considering subbing early just for that “maybe” factor, if I’m subbed I’ll surely get a. Invite... 🤣
---
All good. Didn't want to be negative or anything, but the layout is awesome.
---
And then he’ll resist 3 of my 2.8sec cast time shadow bolts in a row
---
I honestly don’t know how these streamers are going to exist in WoW. They might have to cover their names up and not mention what server they are on because they are going to be swamped by fanboys.
---
Sharding will actually be a godsend for them.
---
Anyway, I’d imagine they’ll have a streaming character and a non-streaming character that no one knows about.
---
it all hinges on whether or not they have weapon speed normalization in the game or if that's being patched in per phase etc.
---
It depends on what you're doing.
---
On Alliance, if your PvP, Gnome is probably the best for Escape Artist.
---
On Horde its Orc for Hardiness, axe bonuses, and their attack bonus racial.
---
For PvE I think its Humans for Sword specialization or Night Elf for the dodge chance.
---
For PvE Horde its Trolls. Berserking is actually pretty useful for building threat as you're going to be falling low enough at times to get closer to that 30% haste.
---
So its dog memes now? 
---
RELEASE DATE!!!!!!!!!
---
To answer your question about shadoweave: the gap between 40 and 60 is humongous. 44 is about the halfway point of total exp needed to hit 60
---
It's 100% worth the effort, but that is entirely up to you. If you log on a certain time (ex: when no one is on), farming for the felcloth is simple.
---
That’s going to be crazy to see everyone literally running everywhere.
---
Just sit for a while and ask the next person that shows up near him to join a party. If they are there, then no way they wouldn’t want to help. It is easy when you have an ally.
---
That guys sucks so hard.
---
Windfury
---
if you do this, make sure you have 2 separate characters for everyone, because either you have everyone somehow always on at the same time to level or people will fall behind, so if you have separate characters to level whilst you aren't all on at once, you won't have people rush ahead of the others or be forced to do nothing.
---
Not that I disagree, but if the author is ashamed then why would they put their name on such a terrible article? I agree though.
---
But 8 of them can just go cat or bear while the other 2 heal.
---
Bruh lucifron is so annoying when they don’t decurse.
---
In world PvP? Paladin for the fact that most Rogues won't even bother with you as there are easier targets to take down.
---
MC is ridiculously easy, a fresh group of out the gate 60s decked in greens that are goal oriented enough to hit 60 within a week and organize a guild/raid can beat MC
---

---
I wish this was a stickied post, very well said. Every time I see "I'd love to do vanilla but I have a wife and kid and job and hernia and taxes" i die a little inside.
---
A large part of that answer is, they do all of the prep they can now. Right now, gills are already formed. Dungeon groups in those skills are already formed. Already have their gear progression laid out as best they can, they have meticulously planned out their leveling times to ensure that as many hit maximum level in the same span of time as possible, and they have distributed their professions to ensure maximum productivity.
---
There's absolutely nothing stopping you from looking into joining one of e-skills, although they to come with their own unique time and effort commitments. And social commitments.
---
I'm not sure why anybody would want to race that fast right out of the gates. Shit they would probably burnt out in a couple months if that's the case. Why not enjoy the damn game a little bit instead of racing like a crazy. That again to each his own I guess
---
Magic dust is awesome in bwl.
---
Every class is fine at leveling, but if we're ranking them, Rogues are definitely #7 in terms of speed. Maybe 6 if you think stealth makes a big difference on a PvP server, but even still they're on the slower side.
---
Oooo thanks
---
Asmongold used to be my favourite YouTuber, but yeah, I can't watch his streams. Fell off super hard imo, but hey more viewers!
---
Having a new view sounds like plenty of positive motivation. You can be sure you won't accidentally fall back on feeling committed to a character because you cling to some idea of copying what you did in the past to find the same fun.
---
Plus it makes you meet all kinds of new people in a new environment with a new horde culture.
---
Oh yeah i 100% plan to farm the felcloth I was referring to the shadow weave set. is it worth it to put in the effort to make the shadow weave set when its basically 10 levels away from the felcloth set?
---
There is a member here that is definitely a spokesman for The Horde. I'm willing to bet he'll pop in start of the year. I'm horde I love horde. I like them because Alliance is just your normal fantasy setting and every game. Small short stubby human. Tiny human. Human with long ears and regular human. Nothing exciting
---
Because that's how some people enjoy playing games?
---
Agreed. They have glazed over Classic in every earnings meetings for the last 2 years. This is a side project that they hope to pull in some extra cash with a skeleton crew working on it.
---
They are much more preoccupied with BFA and the new CoD coming out. I’d imagine they’ll give us a 30-60 day heads up honestly. I wouldn’t be surprised if they gave us less than 30 days.
---
I’d imagine right now they are just getting everything to be as smooth as possible so they don’t have to call in extra bodies to work on a side project at initial release.
---
lets say no sleep at all (unlikely as you'll need to take short naps once in awhile). 
---
But bare min 4 days to 60. Maybe day 5 trying to farm enough gear to have the dps/tanking/healing necessary. You don't really need as much fire resist gear until farther into MC though and spending a few hours running targetted dungeons for gear and mats isn't impossible.
---
MC attunment isn't that hard either, especially if you have a dedicated raid running everyone through BRD.
---
Honestly I think the hardest part is getting enough people to 60 and geared up enough to not get splattered all over the lava and still be relatively coherent when they're all sleep deprived, and even then I don't think many groups will get past the first coupe of bosses before reset.
---
Eitrigg
---
Too bad they couldn't just forgo the beta in general. They tested it back when it was a vanilla figured out everything then why the hell do we have to do it again
---
You get to punt gnomes
---
I'm torn between Mage, Warlock, and Priest, and using Druid as my "I cant decide" class.
---
I plan on doing....well honestly everything.  Open world pvp, BGs, raiding, and farming.  I have the fortune of having a relatively decently sized group heading into Classic together.
---
I have played Priest before (during all of MoP) and really enjoyed the class.  I know how useful they will be in Classic and it never hurts to have more, knowledgeable Priests whenever you are pursuing any kind of content.  Biggest drawback is that I've played the class before, do I want to do that again?
---
Mage brings a ton of utility to the table, with food, water, and portals alone being enough to push me to playing the class.  The class has the versatility to do everything I want to do in the game without feeling hampered by my class in any real way.  Biggest drawback is that I know there are always enough mages to be found, and that the only time I played one (WoD) was short lived and I didnt enjoy it.
---
Warlock was the class I played in Classic and the class I also chose to play in the demo.  Intimately familiar with the classic version of the class, thoroughly enjoyed my time playing it back then.  Biggest drawback is playing the same class that I did back then i guess.
---
Druid is a good option if i cant decide.  I will be Horde and i love the Tauren, something none of the other classes I enjoy have them as a playable option.  Class fantasy wise this is the class I like the most, but I know mechanically it wasnt my favorite at least when I played one and an alt in Classic.  Biggest drawback is that it is not my first choice, but it does bring plenty of variety and options of fun to the table.
---
I will likely be spending most of my time in world with a Warrior.  
---
Please help me decide.  This has been months of this conversation in my head.
---
I was Cenarius.  Maybe there was someone similar on my battle group.
---
Check online before launch, make a friend or three who also plan on doing that, then make the run all together
---
I was considering going horde too but I just...I love night elves too much. 
---
I'll probably have one on each faction though. Or at least try to
---
You level faster. You can do a lot of what Rogues and Warriors can do in terms of PvP, but you actually have a lot similarities to Paladin in PvP in that you're frustratingly unkillable. You can heal yourself, you can pop an instant big heal if needed, you can't really be slowed down because of shapeshift, and you can pretty easily get away in Travel Form if a fight goes wrong.
---
I assume you mean PvE, Druids play differently in PvE. They're most often healers, but can absolutely tank in Raids. There DPS is weak compared to either class.
---
Druids are easier to gear up as well overall.
---
Lol get off your high horse
---
You're talking about me, huh? XD
---
A fight? COUNT ME IN!
---
Since Strike1delta has inadvertently summoned me, [I guess I'll link my last motivational post for joining the Horde.](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bm0akw/please_help_me_get_excited_about_playing_horde/emstcpl/)
---
Yep. Summon worked lol
---
I said 8-10 shamans.
---
They aren’t as bad of healers as you make it seem.
---
&gt; Q3 release.
---
"In the finance world q quarter 3 usually spans July 1-September 30."
---
I'd say July/Aug is certainly fair.
---
where would you even find lore about it? do npc's in tanaris talk about it somewhere?
---
We all owe Nostalrius so much.
---
F
---
Mages are just a bit easier to get value out of in both PvE and PvP. Warlocks are great, so I don't mean to steer you away from that, play it if you want you will be 100% fine and they offer unique utility that other classes don't. Also better leveling experience imo.
---
But you're not going to beat Mages in DPS meters, and you have to work a bit harder to compete in PvP compared to a Mage. 
---
Again, that doesn't really matter. Raids bring Warlocks for a reason, if their utility didn't outweigh the lower DPS, those spots would just be Mages or Warriors/Rogues or something else. 
---
If you like the feel of Locks play one. Your friends probably just want free portals and food. :)
---
I've always liked my interactions with GMs when I needed help in WoW.
---
I was obsessed with Vanilla back in the day and seriously didn’t hear about Classic until like 3 months ago. I play games on the regular, but just didn’t every hear about Classic coming back.
---
If you’re thinking of playing late at night go Horde, 90% of alliance have bedtimes.
---
Hahahaha yeaaaahhhh
---
I even played WoW all summer last year and haven't heard about Classic since last month or so.
---
The pioneers used to ride these babies for miles
---
Lol, what a bunch of suckers, right u/soupasoka?
---
Fell for it too. got so excited! read on and its like.... this is beyond BS
---
I agree with your assessment. 
---
 
---
The ones we're going get back, ontop of everyone else, are those who think TBC changed the game too much, and those who loved TBC and consider Vanilla to offer most of what they loved about TBC.
---
Any levels I should hearth back to darn at to train?
---
Don't forget you'd need to complete the aqual quintessence quest too. So that first run with crap gear, no consumes, and not filled with level 60s will already be a trog, then add on having to stop and go to azshara twice to be able to douse the runes to summon rag. That's after having played 18 hours a day at an elite pace leaving you 1 day before reset.
---
We do. I'm happy to be a person that played on it
---
I would wait till after level 10 and bear form at the very least before making the trek.
---
I don't know if you can do cat form from the Stormwind druid trainer in the park or not....
---
In terms of just leveling together, all three will do.
---
Druids: No real res, only an long CD res that is usable in combat. However, they have HoTs to keep you up while they dish out damage. Also MotW is just the best buff to have imo.
---
Shamans: The biggest benefit is Shamans have a self res. So if you all wipe somehow, you can instantly get back up and res your friends. The totems are more useful than you might think, especially as you get higher leveled. Windfury is probably the best, but that doesn't synergize with the hunter very well. 
---
Some people also find having to drop totems so much to not very fun, so I'd keep that in mind. You're gonna be dropping them down a lot.
---
Priests: Incredibly versatile healer. They have big heals, medium heals, fast heals, AoE heals, a HoT, bubbles to outright stop damage before it happens. They have Power Word Fortitude. You can't go wrong with Priest.
---
If you don't want to deal with totems, and you don't want to be a cow ( I've never been able to level one) I say go Priest.
---
Pat yourself on the back
---
What was leaked?
---
I suppose its the entire backport deal my friend...
---
Dwarf Priests become non-essential as you progress through the raid content, Human Priests become the meta choice due to the spirit bonus at that point.  Dwarf Priets have a much easier time getting into raids before that, but you will 100% be able to get into raids as a Night Elf.
---
If you're rolling on a a PvP server, and your rolling Alliance Priest... you're doing yourself a disservice by not rolling Night Elf. Shadowmeld + Mind Control is probably the trolliest thing in this entire game.
---
Oh I totally forgot there was a druid trainer in the park. That'll make it a lot easier to druid in elwynn.
---
But I think you're right, the class quests start back at the original trainer.
---
Another thing to keep in mind is weapon trainers vary between the cities in what weapons they teach.
---
YES.  MORE DOGS.
---
My thought too - I can't remember ever being actually told about it.
---
That's the thing isn't it. We don't have to fear expansions this time. There's NO need to rush.
---
That said, I'm going to play as effectively as possible when I DO play, I don't like to stand around doing nothing. I'm just not going to log 8 hours a day like others, maybe 3-4 at max.
---
I have no idea why I thought you said it was off of Rend.  
---
It's actually crazy because I'm rewatching that section now and wondering if I had a seizure or something because I must be a goddamn retard.
---
Aw man, now I have to consider finding a group lol, thanks for the info!
---
That race and gender choice are pretty chad, I'll grant you that
---
"Wall of no" got fuuuuuucked XD
---
Lol im just messin dude all good.
---
I just find them obnoxious and cringey.

&gt;no one played vanilla and no one liked vanilla servers
---
You didn't hear about Feenix in those days did you? There were already multiple Classic servers in Cata when I first stopped playing retail WoW. Poorly scripted though, but there was an active Classic community.
---
No way. I was one of these people. Haven't regularly gamed in ages, swore off wow after wotlk. Heard about classic a few weeks ago and it was like a gut punch. I am so in.
---
I think most Night Elves do the run from Darnassus to Stormwind.
---
Exactly which law is private servers breaking?
---
But he kind of let us know when the beta is? People have such a hard-on for these "content creators" is weird
---
I think you can. I don't think there was a Cat Quest. I thought you just bought it from a trainer
---
Not during dungeon runs with randoms. If he's with his guild and then this question wouldn't even be a problem.
---
Killing Allies is the best motivation.
---
Either way it sucks lol more wait time :)
---
&gt; I'm not sure why anybody would want to race that fast right out of the gates.
---
Clear MC week 1, and you get 1 more full clear of gear than anyone else. (Also bragging rights.)
---
yeah that's why
---
That depends on what is most important to you. 
---
If you want to look awesome, go Dwarf (or whichever race you think looks the coolest)
---
If you want to maximize your raid DPS, Human (+5 sword/mace skill) or Orc (+5 axe skill and Blood Fury, plus Windfury adds more DPS than Blessing of Kings).
---
If you want to have faster rep grinds, Humans get a +10% bonus to all reputation gained.
---
If you want to be a 40 man raid main tank, Troll (Berserking is huge for threat generation) or Human (for the +5 sword/mace skill; there are so many great tanking swords).
---
If you want to wreck face in battlegrounds with a pocket healer, it's either Gnome (Escape Artist breaks roots and snares on a short 1 min cooldown) or Orc (25% Stun Resist is huge).
---
In other words, if you're Horde, it's Orc for PVP or PVE DPS, and Troll for main tank, and if you're Alliance it's Human for PVE DPS or main tank, and Gnome for PVP. 
---
I myself am struggling to decide between Human and Gnome for my Warrior.
---
Not in Tanaris but yes in Desolace. Ancient Kodo were presumably jungle dwelling creatures roaming like dinosaurs. When the Halls of Origination were activated within Uldum to push back the Thunder King many thousands of years ago, these Kodo likely died then. That blast is also why Uldum, Tanaris, Desolace, and mayyyybeeee Thousand Needles are desert.
---
Ahh good point!
---
People want server firsts. Its always a race. Different people enjoy different things, in this case these people enjoy the competition.
---
me when i change the realmlist https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbWqXKN3m3c
---
Its a prehistoric kodog.
---
If it's a kodo, then why does it have the head of a dog? Checkmate.
---
If someone manages to down Rags week 1 I'll be incredibly shocked. And that's even if servers function with zero downtime.
---
Week 2 is probable though.
---
But I'm fully expecting at least one guild to get some of the bosses down before first reset. At least two, maybe even more.
---
None of the classic servers will be stopping at the end of classic content and staying Frozen in endgame for all time. Some of them will progress to burning Crusade While others of them might wipe progress, and restart fresh.
---
Anyway, even in MMOs that have reached the end of all content, what qualifies as Victory varies from person to person.
---
lmao Tips Out whiteknighting himself on alt accounts now? That pathetic
---
I like competition too, so I can see why they would like it after looking into it a bit more.
---
Say no more fam
---
Yeah I want to go hard, with your info and some of the other people's responses I may need to look into finding such a group. Still I am fine starting raiding second week too.
---
My worry is finding a group of people who want to go hard but are not jerks or elitist, or corrupt/shady with gear disruptions.
---
Is e-skills a group or a term? Did a Google search but nothing came up.
---
Same here - Fresh is great but I'm not going to keep up. I know this. I have no intention to. I probably won't hit 60 for more then a year.
---
Full servers.
---
Journalists in general are subhuman
---
Wayback Machine or bust!
---
I always got the feeling that while Org had RFC, Alliance were supposed to get the Stormwind Sewers.
---
You got me there
---
Google Voice to Text Miss translates and I am way too lazy to correct it. And sometimes it is a little less daunting mentally if you look at it not as finding a group of people but making friends.
---
Likewise, you will certainly run into guilds and people after you start playing who are also leveling fast and you will have plenty of opportunities to explore their Guild and stuff.
---
There are some crazy fuckers out there, so I'll never say never, but yeah w1 clear would be nuts. W2 there will certainly be a clear. That's already been done on private servers.
---
One of the reason Thrall settled the Horde at Durotar is to train the Orcs to survive the hard environment.
---
:(
---
There's a Druid trainer in SW's park but you will have to return to Darnassus to get your bear form as only that one guy offers them, the rest only tell you to visit him.
---
Thats some embarrassing hipster shit OP. I just want full servers and everyone to have the good time I did in 2006.
---
The only big rush, I guess, would be to get to max level before AQ kicks off. War Effort and all that.
---
I 100% agree! Give it to us Blizz ;)
---
Everquest has been doing classic servers for a decade now. They are called time locked progression servers. They start at the base game and open an expansion every 3 months until the server reaches the current live release. 
---
One of the servers is locked at the planes of power expac, meaning that players will get BiS and have no future upgrades available. So I guess you can say they have “beat” the game.
---
Yeah mainstream journalism is so fucking dead. No idea how those clowns still make money
---
Thx now i wont be able to sleep ffs
---
Was going to say the same. They all have the BIGGEST sticks up their ass, along with some undue arrogance. It's like the fucking hall monitor
---
that entire website is nothing but click-baity titles.
---
&gt;Too popular and you're swamped with inconsiderate Fortnite kiddies polluting the community. 
---
You know that amazing community back in vanilla everyone raves about? It was built out of the "inconsiderate Fortnite kiddies" of that generation. 
---
More people is better for the game. Full stop.
---
Pvp with a warrior is awesome as a druid. I did it in Vanilla with a a buddy of mine. I could keep him topped up, root everyone in place, stun, charge, buff, then throw a few hots his way and dps as cat. Was a good duo.
---
Not available in my country (Canada) :(
---
&gt; Is there such a thing as a " Beginner-class" ? I heard a lot that level up your way until the max level is very hard and kinda long which it's not to annoy me because i want to appreciate every things the game has too offer. But is there a class who have an easiest time to level up ?   
---
There isn't a beginner class. But there is easy leveling class. You can Google them. But note, those classes are actually the more higher skill ceiling classes.  
---
&gt; The second one is, how hard for a beginner it is to begin raiding ?   
---
Once you are familiar with dungeon, raiding isn't actually difficult. Gearing up correctly for the specific raid and organizing 40 players is the hard part.  
---
&gt; I always wanted to make a character in the Alliance, i watched video about Stormwind and Ironforge and i absolutely fell in love with those cities. I can't wait to explore them when Classic WoW will release !! But between Horde and Alliance, is there any differences ( I mean, do some race have any difference in gameplay or is this just all about visual ) ?  
---
There are differences (racial abilities). But unless you're hardcore, focus on what you want to play aesthetically. Remember, you're going to be staring at this character for a very long time.

Clearly you're figured this out. Good luck on getting 25 warriors who would be okay waiting 9 months for a piece of gear.
---
Any tips for picking said server?
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/ with Thottbott theme
---
Do you mean actual tangible in game reasons?
---
All the races are cooler and better animated imo. Night Elves and Dwarves are okay, but humans are hot dogshit and Gnomes are only played by cancerous basement dwellers, and that isn't just propaganda I tell myself because I'm tired of getting tea-bagged by anklebiters.
---
Horde has better dungeon access overall imo. Its just easier to get to, especially Scarlet Monsatery. On Alliance, if you're doing SM you're getting the most you can out of it as its annoying to get to. For Horde its just a Zepplin ride to Undercity.
---
Horde are group of monstrous misfits and it feels that way while playing. You kind of have to be okay with not seeing your boots though. Only orcs get to see 100% of their booties. Undead get some boot action, but all of their gear is shredded and their bones poke through.
---
Final thought, they have better PvP racials overall.
---
Second final thought, Barrens Chat.
---
I kinda wanna see the loot order spreadsheets, I'll bet every piece of gear that drops during their gearing up and attempts to take down MC bosses before the reset is already earmarked for most efficiency.
---
I don't actually remember how long the attunement is but Ony will probably go down week 2 too.
---
The community, or the fandom, is exactly what you personally make it. You decide who you talk to and you decide who you put on ignore. You decide what friends you make and what Guild you join, or if a guild does not exist that caters to what you like you make that Guild.
---
Also, many people are going to have to either relearn or learn for the first time what it truly means to have server specific communities. Each server has its own reputation and this that and the other thing, culture.
---
I want as many people as possible to play classic. I want 50 Max population classic servers in the first week. Then in the month after that I want to see some servers maintain population, some servers gain population, and some servers lose population.
---
Back in 2005, what we know now as this hilariously embarrassing private server fresh hype dead anything under X number of people is a truly dead server, that kind of mindset just didn't exist in 2005. My home server in 2005 was low population, that's how I knew it, and even know it was low population it did not feel low population because I was not an MMO and online interaction burn out, making new friends and meeting people and talking were still fun things to do completely on their own.
---
When a server only has 400 people and you know 300 of those 400 people, the server never feels low population.
---
Let all players from all games come to Classic and experience it. The community, the process, the people will all realize that their actions and interactions mean that much more and carry that much more thoughtful consideration when they have their server reputation to think of.
---
The beta is likely just to be a limited experience to test the server load. I would expect it to be one weekend long, but I wouldn't be shocked if it was just a 24 hour period. 
---
I personally think you'll see it closer to the end of the month.
---
Might as well just use https://classic.wowhead.com/ since ClassicDB pirates all of their site content and data from Wowhead anyway. Even the damn comments and guides are Wowhead content, except Wowhead is more accurate. I saw comments on ClassicDB that were from patch 3.0 something because they pulled the wrong Wowhead data.
---
Let's not support site that steal content from others. Let's support those that actually work hard to support WoW Classic.
---
Hahahhahahhaha I fucking love this and that the idea for stolen. Cop that.
---
My current dilemma:
---
1. Bear tanking endgame dungeons and maybe some raids as an OT if things work out that way. The survivability and utility are attractive for some casual PVP. The ability to farm/solo, as well as solid leveling are bonuses, as well.
---
2. Priest healing endgame dungeons and maybe some raids if things work out that way. Would also heal in some casual PVP. Can also farm/solo content, and leveling is fairly straightforward/easy-ish.
---
I feel like I could tank quite well, and enjoy doing it. I mained a Prot Pally in TBC and Wrath. I also enjoy healing, and do just fine at it, but it's not my "thing" the way tanking was back in the day. 
---
I am also tempted to try out [shadow/healing hybrid spec](http://classicdb.ch/?talent#bLZbhtIc0VZxMGd0to) for dungeon healing and PVP support, or possibly be the [Shadow Weaving healer spec](http://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMhsZbxxcMZxMxd0x) in raids.
---
One last point: race. I play Alliance. I like the aesthetic of Nelf female, but I will always be a Dwarf at heart. I would love Bear tanking, but I would always regret not being a Dwarf. I could really identify with Dwarf Priest, but then I can't tank. 
---
Perhaps it might help to know what the community would value more for dungeons and raids, and also which would have a better time being a support in PVP.
---
Any thoughts are welcome.
---
I don't have ads, I have premium. Happy to support a good resources monetarily.
---
When I hit 60 I can finally get my revenge on all the people who wronged my gnome warrior while leveling.
---

---
I thought HFC was very good
---
Speak for yourself. WoD mistweaving was so fun, I haven't found a class/spec combination to match it since.
---
It's a krayt dragon reference.
---
What did he leak??
---
Just use an AdBlocker like uBlockOrigin. ClassicDB is a site that pirates all of their content from Wowhead which I personally find pretty shitty. The only reason that site exists is because Wowhead doesn't have the money to fight that kind of legal battle.
---
Whenever I see believable "classic realese news", I never click it but rather this subreddit so that I can directly "find" the official announcement post. 
---
Maybe one day it will happen.
---
If Troll Druid was a thing in Vanilla, I might have switched factions.
---
what does that even mean?
---
Exactly why new players should avoid this subreddit.
---
This is the site I'm using. Lots of good stuff so far and quality site as usual.
---
Retail IS gutted.
---
Thottbott comments exist on https://classic.wowhead.com/ actually. Along with Allakhazam comments.
---
I love you OP, this was hilarious! Keep it up
---
There was always this big rush I felt on pservers, because everyone knew in the back of their heads that the server was temporary. At any time it could shut down following enough of a legal challenge.
---
I won't have the time or inclination to speed level, but there's nothing wrong with it. I'm just glad that there's finally a realm that won't disappear overnight and make you start from scratch and find new friends all the time.
---
Rank 10 takes some work. It will be difficult (but doable) to achieve with a part time job.
---
Nice guide!!
---
lol, so the subs going from 10m to 5m is considered a success because 5m is still a large number? so the fact the MoP saw the sub base shrink by 50% is a success... am i understanding you correctly?
---
Very excited to watch people give up on the first few mobs
---
It’s pretty easy to look up and even test these things, that’s not at all how blocking works in vanilla. I’m not gonna sit here and argue with u on shit that’s readily available online, just stop spreading misinformation.
---
That's from a post during the beta, but yeah use that as a stepping stone to bash give subreddit. It has every play style and can do every role. It also has a very easy to play leveling style.
---
nope, tauren/nelf
---
People are under the impression that mobs in MC are going to fall over to groups of lvl 55-58 players in leveling greens.  
---
Raiding on Week 1 is going to be incredibly difficult, because, even if you can level to 60 in say 6 days of real time your gear will suck, you will have to spend the rest of your time doing attunements etc. 
---
But realistically it's likely not as possible as people think/hope.  
---
Everyone cites Joana's world record of 4d 20h, which works out to ~6 days  of real life time if you play 20 hours a day.  Meaning 4 hours to sleep, eat, and bio.  And that's as a hunter. 
---
Can't really do MC with a group of 40 hunters, so the real question is, can your Warriors and Healers get to 60 in 6 day/played?  Chances are no.
---
I love this
---
Will be enough to read reddit to get the news for that. Will be 100 threads and youll know its real
---
Quick!  Figure out who is most likely to forget setting their video to private, and scout their video feed!
---
You remember when you would charge a mage while he was casting poly?  And you would stun the mage from charge, but also be a sheep at the same time??? That’s spell batching
---
Is it shameful how quickly my brain senses a difference in these? I may have spent too much time in this game.
---
i played actual vanilla and i remember it beeing harder, but that is only cause we had no idea what we where doing back then
---
Yeah, basically tanks then healers on everything. Ony will be harder to w1 since you need to run ubrs, which means running lbrs enough to make a key. Just running all that will eat up most of a day.
---
I’ll never understand people who try  and teach other people about stuff, that they themselves clearly no nothing about.
---
I used to love their magazine when I was a kid.  but nowadays...yeaaah.
---
What sucks for me is that I can only devote time to classic during the summer and winter this year, since it overlaps with my final High School year ):
---
there are 2 private server. 1 of them has increased herb spawn rates.theother one doesnt. i happen to playon the server that doesnt have increased herb spawn rates. and gues what its still easy
---
Except the generation was entirely different in personality. We grew up differently and even our games were way different, so we played them differently. OP has a good point. Certain types of players if there's enough of them will change the personality of a game or at the very least the server they're on.
---
It's funny how you, and every other content creator were like "They *finally* listened, Spell Batching is going to be like classic!", when in reality, not you or **any** other streamer or content creators actually asked for this - let alone knew about this small technical detail.
---
But that didn't stop you or other content creators from reaping glory from it, like this was something you actually asked before. Which you never did. Only seen Alexsensual talking about it
---
Pretty sure they're used to it.  I was watching asmongold play ESO for the first time, and he seemed to keep his cool even with like 50 players swarming him every time he tp'd somewhere.  
---
I couldn't handle it lol.
---
I was anticipating an extremely short limited beta too. I don’t even care if there is one. I just feel with the release of a beta, potentially comes news of launch.
---
I farmed stam food around those bones for many, many hours
---
Yes, the original Classic. This screen is from Dec 2004. I hate calling it 'vanilla' so I guess I'd better start calling it 'original Classic' to clarify.
---
You do realize you look just as bad as him in the blind part, right? He actually addressed your arguements and you did nothing but attack him and try to discredit him.
---
Love you!
---
I'm pretty sure that's what this was!
---
Me, it was one of my favorite expansions, simple because during its release, I Had the most time available (was inbetween jobs).  It wasn't the best for sure, and the content drought was insane.   But I have a lot of good memories PvPing ashran.
---
Exactlyyyy

pretty unfortunate considering how cancerous wowhead is

What sorcery does this man claim to be able to download pornography and play WoW at the same time in the dark internet year of 2005?
---
On today's episode of "People saying shit they don't actually know to be true"
---
the reason why alli has a higher skill floor is because of salv. that means a mediocre alliance tank will do just fine. on horde side your tanks notonly miss salv, but also get wf. that makes it so that horde tanks have to generate even more treath since the melee dps does more treath then alliance melees. that means they have to equip more dps gear, wich means that your horde healers needo bebetter to handle it. i maybie should have said horde in general has a higher skill ceiling and not horde tanks. so tldr: alliance has a easyer time time raiding while horde has more pontential of killing stuff fast. or in other words if you have a mediocre tank on alliance you will be just fine while if you have that same tank o horde you will get problems
---
like yourself then?
---
You sound like someone “polluting” the community by dictating how others enjoy their game.
---
yet that hasn't been confirmed or hinted at whatsoever though. Obviously its a possibility
---
Can you really?
---
On today's episode of, "when I forget to preface any statement with 'in my opinion', somebody Burns me at the stake for daring to assume."
---
Always glad to have company in the land of Internet pedantry.
---
Priest, especially dwarf, will be higher valued, but simultaneously, there will be fewer druids than priests, allowing you to carve out a niche if you chose that class. Druids are more versatile, but dwarf priests are much more sought after. It comes down to that really. Dwarf warrior is an option that may fulfill all your desires, but ultimately will be less versatile than a druid.
---
Your entire first paragraph is false and has not been confirmed.
---
Yes yes this is true this is true, the one time I forgot to preface an opinion with the statement, in my opinion.
---
At the same time, does anybody actually think blizzard will leave any classic servers open and Frozen at the end of content for all-time? Does anybody actually think that they will do that to a classic server before they get the opportunity to do that with current retail Warcraft at the end of whatever the last expansion turns out to be?
---
Compared to WoD and BFA they are.
---
WoD on the first like day was WOTLK numbers and then it quickly dropped to lower than MoP. Before the honeymoon period would wear off for other expansion.
---
You're welcome! :)
---
In my opinion, in my opinion, in my opinion, in my opinion, I forgot to include the magic words.
---
At the same time, if anybody actually thinks blizzard will keep any classic servers open and Frozen at the end of classic content until the end of time, can I have a great lake I would like to sell them on Pluto.
---
there are druid trainers in the park in stormwind.
---
Troll druids fit so damn well, and are the only class/race combo that was added in cata that doesn't make me shake my head. Human hunters trigger me so hard. Tauren paladins? What. The. Fuck.
---
Uhh WoD literally had the chance to bring sub numbers back. They hit WOTLK numbers at the beginning and then it quickly dropped to lower than MoP before the honeymoon period was even over. And it never really stopped dropping.
---
I'll always be around rooting for you guys.  Keep up the good work.  Some might be trolling just to troll, others feel some sort of ownership, but I for one appreciate the work you put into your videos.  Just tell esfand to put that damn hair away before getting on camera.

This guy is absolutely right, all the warlocks and hunters that kill themselves week 1 are gonna be twiddling their thumbs waiting for warriors, priests, paladins and shamans anyway. Maybe if they had a few rotating teams of ungrouped hunters following their MTs around to help them kill mobs, but who the fuck wants to do that job?
---
Have the same opinion about that, why you wanna rushing guys?! The beatiful wow classic world will open for us and will not run anywhere. Just wanna enjoy the old location again, meet people during the questing so on. Actually don't care how fast i gonna make 60 lvl
---
Honestly I feel this is hyperbole. While I don’t want it, people said the same thing on retail and they still play retail. If it’s Battlefront 2 levels I can see it, but Blizzard doesn’t do that for WoW.
---
Just remember this, you can open lock-boxes with engineering and black-smithing, just the same as a rogue. The only thing is the rogue can pick-pocket the junk-boxes and pick them with no cost besides the time investment of leveling the skill.
---
Same. I kind of really want to roll Druid in Classic, but it would mean playing Night Elf, which is fine. I like Night Elves. I could even maybe get over having to kill Horde races.
---
But I'm not big on the other Alliance races. I like 3 of the 4 base Horde races a lot.

Yeah honestly I’m gunna be a dwarf paladin and just imagine myself as a guy who has to wear cloth/leather because he’s so dedicated to supporting his raid.
---
“I’ll look bad so you don’t have to” or “I wear rags and tatters so my raid can succeed”
---
Yeah, I really wish they didn't do that.  Oh well, once AV is unlocked in classic, that'll be my go to pvp :P

You really are belligerent

Yeah these new kids and their hip hop and bee bop and light up shoes. When i was a kid i had to walk uphill both ways in the snow and played wow on a type writer. 100% your 25 talking about the "younger fortnite generation". fuck outa here ass.
---
expansions aren't Vanilla, this is what confused me.
---
Look, I am not a fan of third party distributors.
---
But when there is no alternative for it, I am not the one to blame people for using them.
---
And I think we can all agree that vanilla isn´t the same than retail.
---
Which means, there was no official supplier for classic-esque content.
---
Also, if nost wouldn´t have pointet out how big the demand for official classic supply is, blizz would still shrug it off as "you think you do, but you dont"-content.
---
TL:DR PServers are bad, but so are you. It´s not the users fault that there was no official alternative to third party options.

Of course he doesn't. Anyone who uses the term "fanboy" as an attempted means to discredit an argument has already lost.  We see this all the time these days "shill, fanboy, corporate bootlicket, etc etc ad nasuem"

Not just in the games industry either.  It's far easier to attack your opponent directly just like the big boys on TV do...(Politicians) then it is to actually respond coherently to arguments in a rational manner.
---
Missing a "where mankriks wife?"
---
100% agree!

Shut it you lol

Well yeah, that's the point. They liked Vanilla, but they quit the game when WoW was no longer vanilla (i.e. when expansions started coming out)

Hi, /u/skeezus_prime

Oh, you mean VC.

I already know your mom pretty well

Ah fair enough.        
---
For the second thing though, honestly I doubt it. There's probably the people that hate classic for absolutely no reason and think it's going to crash and burn because they personally don't like it. And I'm sure think that the servers will just be stuck as they are. Otherwise I'm not sure tbh

---
Except inverse.  One bad deed does nor make a company bad.  Your individual experiences are grounded in cognitive bias.  You tend to remember the bad situations more than the good.  I worked in Tech Support for 6 years.  Hardly anyone ever thanked me or would go out of their way to give me a good review.  But you can damned sure that someone would complain about the most mundane thing, even if it was 100% not my fault or within my ability to rectify; just because they were in a pissy mood.
---
Corporations may not be your friends but this mentality that they are out to 100% screw you from head to toe is utter nonsense and bandwagon hating.
---
Week 1 is very unlikely. But week 2 yeah, the first raid tier will be cleared before the 2nd reset. It’s been done before. I see Rag going down on day 10 of release.
---
Sorry about the phrasing.
---
But honestly, those 'hate hate hate classic' people...a small part of them must be hoping they're successful.
---
after all, if they are successful, there is a fair chance they'll move on to BC. and Wrath. and...well okay let's just stick with those two
---
Many of those 'classic ultra-haters' find their greatest joy in TBC or Wrath
---
and the triple irony is that for many who started back in classic but found it a HORRIBLE SLOG, then to make it to BC or Wrath and find it JOYFUL...part of the reason for that joy back then was the investment they had put into their character up to that point. That's a small part of what brought them all that joy
---
and then we have BC or Wrath 'babies', and they're totes free to steer clear of Classic, while still hoping it's popular enough for blizzard to 'keep it going' into the 'future' xpacs
---
Unless I'm mistaken I believe a private server guild has cleared MC on the first week of a server launching, but that's with mages duo aoe grinding with hyper dynamic respawns and other non blizzlike things.

You guys are definitely not wrong.  Apparently these days it's just meme posts and meme meta-posts (memes about the meme posts) and bitch threads.  But it's cool the mods are apparently OK with the sub devolving into meme spam because "all the conversations that could take place have already taken place over the last 15 years!"
---
Not pictured: the music 
---
The barrens may be a pretty bland looking zone but goddamn does it have an amazing vibe.  You really get a sense of the struggle of the horde to get on it's feet and establish a foothold on this new continent in a new world
---
10 shamans sounds outright painful. I considered rolling a shaman after I finished my progression run on Lightbringer through Kel'Thuzad. Looked at logs, thinking surely shaman has to shine in Naxx with all the extra raid damage, and sure they were better, but priests still dominated. Before Naxx, they are just not good. No easy way to put that.
---
Tauren is just as good as Orc for BiS threat. They both would use The Hungering Cold from Kel'Thuzad which has +6 swords on it, making it better than an Orc with an axe (without edgemasters, but I seriously doubt anyone would tank with those).
---
Druids and hunters should already be 1 and 1-2 respectively, you can't cut it any more than that. Priests are the best healers in the game by far with their output, regen, and spell flexibility. Paladin can only compare in efficiency and sniping with faster heals. You want to cut the best healers to bring in 10 bad healers?
---
I haven't kept track, but I believe every KT server first on recent private servers has gone to Alliance. The world record speed clear belongs to Alliance. They did over 37,000 raid dps on their Patchwerk kill, enough to kill Brutallus pre-nerf in Sunwell if it was a 40 man raid. I doubt a horde raid could touch that.
---
Totem dropping depends on your pace of clearing. If you are doing 25 minute MC speed runs you basically never stop moving, you'd be out of range before your totem repaid its mana cost to cast. If you are in a casual guild, you are probably going to miss mana spring uptime just from forgetfulness, or not realizing they were out of range.

I don't think Blizzard is out to get screw me, and I never suggested that. I simply disagree that they have great customer service. I tried to have a conversation with someone, and there response was to simply close my tickets, thus leaving me unable to speak to them. That's horrid CS.

The first wave of 60s will be farming stuff like black lotus, devilsaur, and potions(fire resist/ mana / etc)

I can’t wait to form a raiding party and take on some mobs in the Barrens

You have one more than me. Only reason I started buying digital at Pandaria is because i quit playing wow at the tail end of cata and about a month before WOD came out, blizzard offered Pandaria to me free to return to the game. So i said what the hell.
---
You whiteknight all you want, Ima snap up on that Shadowfang, Edgemaster's and Teebu's faster than Billy the kid.
---
Thank you for the advice
---
They do it a lot with Winds of Winter too.
---
Which I only just realized is also WoW. I fervently hope that the similarities end there.
---
Just carry multiple sets of gear and you will be able to tank, dps or heal for most of the content. Personally I thought druid leveling was one of the most active classes because your constantly changing in and out of forms to changing situations of to heal yourself.

---
I got a GIF about my low effort meme. Time of my life.
---
&gt; Is there a way I can fill healer and tank roles to get invited to more groups (lvl 20-50).
---
I mean you can heal, or you can tank, or you can DPS in a dungeon. Druids can do all 3 in every dungeon, regardless of how their spec, but you're not going to be Tanking and healing yourself; or healing someone else and then switching into Bear form to tank some mobs.
---
In PvP you switch forms a lot, there is a lot of variety in what you can do and similar to a Paladin, you're very hard to kill and very very hard to pin down. I think Druids probably have one the more fun experiences in PvE and solo world content. Especially so on a PvP server. You can do so much with this class.
---
Also, every class is like this in a way. You're kind of rinse and repeating the most efficient way to kill something. That usually means 2-3 skills/spells.
---
In raids, it usually means 1 spell for a lot of classes. Mages and Warlocks basically just cast their bolt spell for instance in raids.
---
OT: how do you actually check this? Like I only see upvotes o:
---
Oh man, i also cannot wait to see this dungeon for the first time, back then I was always horde so it did not even register on my side.
---
15 bucks little man, put that shit in my hand
---
Raiding after a week is only a thing on private servers. It may be possible in Classic and it may not, it depends a lot on how accurate the content was on those pservers. There, if you had 40 skilled players who had already cleared MC a hundred times each, it's doable in greens. If it's significantly harder in Classic, it would probably take two weeks instead.
---
Assuming there isn't a bunch of service downtime, the fastest levelers start hitting 60 around day 5 and 6. Then a handful of them begin to raise Hydraxian Waterlords rep to honored by grinding elementals in Silithus. This way they have enough rep to get Aqual Quintessences halfway through the first run and can douse the runes to spawn the last bits of MC.
---
After that, it's just a matter of getting 40 people together. There might be joint raids between two or three guilds if noone has enough 60s and it's near the end of a reset. If it should prove impossible to kill Ragnaros in the first reset, it'll happen in the next one as the most hardcore players will have mostly pre-BiS within a few days of hitting 60.
---
Every class can be played by anyone, and you will be able to get to 60. The main differences will be the length of time it takes to get to 60 and the play style of the different classes. I suggest not focusing on speed of leveling, and in the first few weeks, try out classes that seem interesting to you, and get them to level 10 (which is a drop in the bucket compared to the time for the next 50 levels) to get an idea as to what you enjoy. Then pick the character you like the most and go with that one!
---
As for ease of getting into raiding, I dont know that I have much to offer specifically about Classic, other than that there will be many guilds just looking for enough bodies. However, I started raiding right away in Wrath, and there are a few pearls I learned that hopefully still apply to Classic. 1) Find a team that has the same goals as you. If you have vastly different goals from your raid team you either wont last, or wont enjoy it. 2) Seek out the advice of those who are more experienced than you. Week 2 of my second raid team (the first was pretty casual and not really what I wanted) my RL told me I was underperforming and to talk to one of the other rogues about how to improve. He pointed out a few flaws in my spec, and my rotation. A few weeks latter and I was competing with him for top dps. Even now, (well, I dont raid right now, but when I did in Legion) I was able to learn so much by talking to other all stars of my class. 3) I feel like advice should come in 3s.... Well, I dont have a 3 other then have fun with it!
---
Differences between Horde and Alliance? Do you want to be scum, or heroes? Jk :P The big difference outside aesthetics is that Horde get Shammans, and Alliance get Paladins. And if you are Horde I will gank you. For the Alliance!
---
That survey leaves a lot to be desired, academically speaking. How are you going to get closer to any conclusion or consensus from this few and vague questions?
---
Private servers have higher drop rates than retail so it would be even less often.
---
May 14
---
vietcong?
---
Bro Im a ret paladin, and Im here to tell you thats not my issue.  T70he issue is that horde gets windfury so you are essentially spending gold to do less dps.  Thats not minmaxing, thats just not being dumb.
---
Ouch, that's a long wait.
---
if that money doesn't show
---
Ah the days before many people had multiple monitors
---
Wish my desk was nice and neat, it has cigar ashes all over it
---
This same post fooled me too 😐
---
It's like this never ending meme......
---
You do realize that's a self inflicted mortal strike for 25 seconds?
---
Btw..  Feel free to check logs on legacyplayers. Best 4 of 5 raids, check LB for Naxx, and ND for earlier raids as that will be the most recent activity for those raids. You'll see typically 1-2 shaman in the top 30 healers for every raid except MC has like 5-6. Honestly there are more druids than shaman, so perhaps I need to re-evaluate shamans to worst healer, but druids are on both factions, so I'll call it a tie for worst.
---
Most people will be taking their time and enjoying the experience I think.
---
I'm sitting here looking for a dog in the picture...
---
Haha, "my final" and then "most people". Nice conclusion.
---
which isss....when?
---
Fuck Towelliee. Fatass who bashed classic relentlessly until he saw how popular it was getting and he changed his tune fast.
---
all they wanted was ur click. 
---
That what sucks about modern day journos, whatever it takes to make you click. 99% of them are a disgrace. the few good ones are the rare exception. all the rest are whoring it out for clicks.
---
Then you owe me, owe me , owe...  gave someone else a little time to finish it, they failed, had to finish it lol
---
Yeah. Purchasing/crafting a wand is really only optimal on established servers or for alts.
---
No, collie is waaay bigger than a sheltie.
---
Hotdogs, what else?
---
They should only feel insulted if it is true for them.
---
Definitely. Feral combat spec with some points in resto would allow you to survive most solo content. Cat is great for downing most mobs but if you're up against an elite or you pull more than expected you can apply your bleeds in cat, pop out and toss a rejuv and go bear to finish the fight. Druids in classic were a lot of fun because it was commonplace to utilize all your forms.
---
Do bear in mind that changing often is mana costly so be careful how much you switch around.
---
I am struggling to draw the link between my thinking that TBC was the beginning of the end of WoW and elitsm, but somehow you have managed.
---
Except I got two monitors specifically because of WoW, and then realized just how awesome they are for college XD
---
2020
---
Tips, thank you for not being an insufferable douchebag like your new pal Towelliee
---
I do. It was stupid as hell. Mostly because charge was SUPPOSED to auto-stun, but you had to be mid-charge before the effect was applied, thus the mid-charge poly success, charge stun success, but overall failure.
---
Pfftt.... Logitech G600  all the way (  [https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/gaming-mice/g600-mmo-gaming-mouse.html](https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/gaming-mice/g600-mmo-gaming-mouse.html)  ).
---
Truth right here.
---
I think we can all agree: Fuck Towelliee.
---
I'm more worried about people like you in the game than "fortnite kiddies". The point of vanilla was that everyone found a niche, not that we carefully curated the "correct" community feel.
---
Yes but you're killing things 5x faster, so it's advantageous to group as 5?
---
I did not know this; guess I'll give it a go, or just play Tauren. :)
---
Shit they should just air those again and add classic I mean isn't the point to bring it back the way it was.
---
#no changes
---
🐻 in mind...hah!
---
Tl;DW?
---
That feeling you got everytime you bought one of these...
---
You generally stick either bear or cat when killing random quest mobs. Obv pop out to caster form for heals and buffs.
---
It's a dynamic playstyle though. For example is there's a pack of 3 you need to solo you can open with roots on 1, nature's grasp the 2nd then cat down the other. Or you can dot/root kite elite mobs.
---
Nothing earth-shattering but you will for sure make use of all forms. Also once 60 the best world PvP spec is a balance hybrid which makes use of caster form quite a bit.
---
🐻 in mind! Hah!
---
all i can is  /train

K there alex

Sounds like you asked for it.

Was the Elite Tauren Chieftan concert there in vanilla? (when I dabbled in cataclysm a band would show up at at certain times and play a gig)
---
Probably referring to the renowned Mr. Alex Jones, part time conspiracy theorist and full time male vitality pill salesman
---
Youtube doesn't allow you to add an extra ad for videos over 10 minutes long any more? Do you know roughly when was this changed? I heard that it was still a thing a few months back.
---
Apparently it wasn't. Vanilla was 84% male, 16% female. The average male age was 28, the average female age was 32.
---

---
Oh man I had the same experience in vanilla, when I figured out about ret I was so happy
---
&gt; I would argue that receiving bad customer service would put you in the extreme minority in that regard. Granted I am talking only about tickets.
---
That's possible, but probably the worst customer service experience in my life was from Blizzard customer support.  
---
&gt;I don't consider those mouth breathing forum MVP's as customer support  
---
This I don't disagree with.
---
they do, but it still just is crazy for resources and other things

May 8th Blizzard invited Classic WoW content creators and some other wow streamers/creators to BlizzHQ in Irvine. Towelliee made a statement about the clip under a meme about StaySafeTv (one who was invited) being located in North Korea. His statement about the trip can be found here - [https://www.twitch.tv/towelliee/clip/TenderRudeIcecreamSmoocherZ?filter=clips&amp;range=7d&amp;sort=time](https://www.twitch.tv/towelliee/clip/TenderRudeIcecreamSmoocherZ?filter=clips&amp;range=7d&amp;sort=time) 
---
This lead me to create a post about a pending massive announcement due to his statement. Blizzard banned me for Trolling/Spamming when in reality I believe I flew too close to the sun. So... title.
---
Hopefully I condensed it down enough for you. I cut out a lot of details for my summary might be confusing.
---
DKP bidding is the best system and if any rule is needed for bidding it should only be that your class can use it. If a warrior wants to blow a bunch of dkp on a stat stick gun then let him, he won’t have as many points to bid on things that may be more relevant and won’t be rolling against the hunters on the next drop.
---
Same. Wait 2 weeks, Blizz response without helping and close ticket. Reopen, wait 2 weeks, Blizz response without helping and close ticket.
---
Oh right. You could say I'm Alex Jones for Blizzard censoring me sure.
---
When did vanilla launch back in the day? Aug 24 or something? Tipping it’ll be the same launch date as then for maximum nostalgia
---
We'll see if its conspiracy in a few days. I might be completely wrong and make an ass out of myself. At least that would be fun to watch.
---
It's incredibly infuriating. You don't even get to respond and tell them the issue isn't resolved.
---
Sounds like the Derp State is trying to silence you.
---
The tin in your foil fedora must have lost its charge, it may be time to make another.
---
Keep up the fight, brother. This kind of corruption may go all the way to the top. To the people that *actually* run Blizzard.
---
*Removes sunglasses*
---
The French.
---
what bothers me is that throughout its history wow has lost subs the more it tried to appeal to everybody and compromise its offering for the sake of accessibility. and yet they kept going down that road. at some point you gotta look at the numbers and wonder if making the game more and more inclusive and suitable for everyone is actually having a counter effect of losing its appeal.
---
It honestly surprises me that a big corp like acti-blizz still could not see what the data literally in front of them was telling them.
---
At the end of the day you’ll hit a PvE server so the true Classic players don’t gank you for being full of yourself. This community IS appreciative for streamers helping Blizzard see what we really want. But that doesn’t mean without you we wouldn’t eventually see it. Retail WoW is a dying breed regardless of what you do so it’s equally beneficial.
---
Haha someone posted the source for it and it’s from like 2006 you’re not wrong
---
This comment is the best comment. You made my day lol.
---
The more people the better. Sure there will be trolls and people you don't want to play with you but you will just get to know who to avoid on your server. There will probably be server discords with a blacklist of who to avoid.
---
My jungle love!
---
If there is no announcement by May 14th I will promise to make a video stating that I was wrong, that I am nothing but a dirty dirty conspiracy theorist and that my ban was just. Trying to remain light hearted about this, I love all the comments so far even if you disagree and call me Alex Jones. I got nothing but love for this community.
---
If I were to get an invite, or if its open, I still won't do it. I'll wait for proper release
---
&gt; If you have a life outside WoW kill speed is very much an advantage
---
Was talking about this regarding gold/hour comparison. Ofc it frees you to do other things. Tbh, i only do lasher grind (currently on my paladin, cba to respec) while watching TV/Netflix. It doesnt take me out of my normal routines, i can do both at the same time.
---
have you tried their gm ticketing in bfa? because i returned to the game for about 4 months at the start of bfa after all my friends kept nagging me, and to my surprise when i needed to open a ticket.... well you couldn't. they throw you in a convoluted menu where you select you issue and at the end they direct you to wowhead faq and forums.... and if ur issue persist you can submit a web ticket where the support will be through email not the old live gm /w in the game.
---
I want the wow map app on my second screen
---
Although I didn't play classic I played wotlk and on a private server but half of those zones amazed me every time I passed by them and were like landmarks to me. It does bring back good feelings :) thank you
---
I said it was during wod that has a projected 5m sub count not cata and mop y absolute moron
---
From that description, Ally would have a lower skill floor (less skill is needed to be competent) and lower skill ceiling (less skill needed to be the best), while Horde would have a higher skill floor and higher skill ceiling.
---
A beta isn't even confirmed yet, it's all just rumors. 
---
&gt;  in my opinion I believe it would be in Blizzards best interest to toss out invites to people with inactive subscriptions, especially to accounts that have had extended downtime.  
---
Free to that opinion, it won't happen. Beta invites have always been and will remain random selection except for streamers which is understandable. I understand the appeal of a beta, people are excited, but try to be logical about it. Chances are slim anyone here will get in and even if we don't it's not like we have a long wait.
---
Sorry bro, #nochanges &gt; #givepalliescrusaderstrike
---
I actually just opened a ticket today about some un-used gametime and they were more than happy to reimburse me for it, and even added the suggestion of giving me 7 days free time to decide if I wanted to use the 2 months free or not, So it didn't go to waste
---
‘Swarmed with inconsiderate kids’
---
The thing that makes me most excited about Classic is that less than 2% of players will be under 18. Soo don’t you worry
---
I know feenix wow, it was cool but then again, vanilla servers barely had population before any hype was given to vanilla.
---
Can't they use a rogue to open UBRS ?
---
thicker tinfoil hat solved my problems
---
If you haven't received more than 1 wall of no, you're doing it wrong.
---
Winter 2017!
---
The way retail is going you might be able to some day
---
inb4 Blizzard pulls an Apple and just fucking drops Classic tomorrow with 0 warning.
---
Well, if you're wrong they should ban you for spreading false/trolly stuff.
---
If you are right, they should ban you as well because they will want to make their own announcements on their own terms and on their own behalf. It's also possible that someone on NDA would have similar info and therefore would be in violation of that if you happened to be one of them. Cut and dry ban. 
---
So.... your video is dramatic and unwarranted. This isn't some form of wrongful censorship as you so claim.
---
Did you open it from in game ticket where a gm wispers you? 
---
Also mine was a somewhat close problem where i had my 6 month sub on recurring and it had renewed when i did not want it to. Ironicly i went in game to talk to a gm about kz i thought it would be faster. 
---
Ended up being redirected to a web portal where i had to fill my ticket to support. And no they did not accept refunding it. So i paid for 6 months without playing a single time😞
---
Gnomes in particular !
---
I played a Human Warlock in Vanilla and never played Horde until the Classic Demo. The Barrens was a cool place to quest. You should try it.
---
also you will all have to be of a single race, running from ne to iron forge is not fun ... there were no inter race teleporters in classic right?
---
Nope. It's actually a decent way to make money, by selling unlocks, if you get a key early on. Lbrs is aids though and people generally don't run it very often.
---
Ohwee Ohwee Oh!
---
We have cookies and sca
---
My group is the exact same way. The best way i look at it: this basically answers the question of what it would have been like if i had chose horde all those years ago. Doubt ill get a third chance so fuck it. For the Horde!
---
&gt;Look, I am not a fan of third party distributors.
---
Why aren't you? Are you some corporate nosebrowner?
---
Seriously now, private servers aren't bad. They did a better job than blizzard for longer than blizzard has. Blizzard's best years, in wow, were 2004-2010. Private servers have been running for 10 years+ and have been providing us with the means to play a version of the game that we like, not the shit stain it has become.

---
Thanks for the Silver, stranger! May good boys protect you while leveling, always.
---
I keep reading that shadowmeld somehow helps eating during a fight? But it's stationary! Enemy can simple use AoE or run to me and and they'll see me?
---
Did it occur to you that maybe that stuff is still under NDA? In that case you're not "exposing the truth" you're just bombing speculation for free-clicks and karma.
---
Be more respectful of contract terms and they may not ban you again in the future.
---
OSRS doesn’t have classes so you only need one character...so I really don’t get the point of this post..
---
&gt; the last episode of Game of Thrones might require some multitasking
---
This could just be referring to the fact that most of us will be loading our guns/tying our nooses/popping our pills while we attempt to make it through the last of season 8's *outstanding writing.*
---
But a beta release would certainly help me step down from the chair.
---
We'll see. After all, the evidence points toward a bunch of people seeing something at Blizzard HQ. It could have just been a dev waving his tackle back and forth like some kind of exotic bird, but
---
I'm leaning toward Classic related info...whether it's a final info dump to tease upcoming beta/release, or just skipping that part and heading straight to beta/release.
---
Ouch :P
---
Invest in Tinfoil today!
---
I just hope there is enough severs that there isn’t a fucking 2 hour queue to get in..
---
Haha correct (:
---
I did it through the website, through their web chat. It's kind of a maze to get to it, but it usually only takes a few minutes tops to get in contact with someone.  
---
And yea they can't refund it but they can give you your un-played time back. Save it for classic!
---
isn't reck just a private server thing?  For sure it won't be a thing on classic since /sit wont work. so either prot/holy for aoe or ret.
---
I disagree. With how shit and anti consumer the modern gaming industry has been for years now, people yearn for something real and proven. Plus the new age of gamers have never experienced something that doesn't nickel and dime them to death or corrupt their experience with macrotransactions
---
Everyone so far is not wrong.  All you have to do nowadays is make some jokes and complain about stuff.  The people who run this sub seem to be alright with that.
---
So we just making shit up now and saying it’s facts? ...ok cool
---
They would NOT wipe a server. This isn't Rust. They'd just create a new one.
---
If I were under NDA I wouldn't say anything. Everyone is entitled to an opinion tho.
---
and it makes more sense. 
---
On all EU servers I played on it was
---
DM for deadmines
---
and 
---
DM *Wing* for Dire Maul.
---
People who don't play rogue will be lost watching this lol
---
isnt the new classic being built on the bfa engine, so all updated libraries after 10 years of extra dev work at least
---
You can't kill things 5x faster.  Mobs are too spread out, spawn too slowly, etc.
---
Yeah, when I say 'wipe' a server, I'm speaking ala Diablo Three seasons.
---
But I don't see them just 'creating' a new server whenever the "current" server reaches end of classic content. They aren't pulling a 'fresh hype dead' private server scene.
---
What do you guys think would be the best idea? Stay darn + teld?
---
Run wetlands+drown to cold ridge?
---
Swim to elwynn?
---
I really wanna druid again for the utility / familiarity
---
VC is dead mines  VC Has always been dead mines.
---
I foresee them following a path that classic followed, allowing the game to progress on a comparable timeline up until a community decided expansion/patch, which will be where things halt. It will probably not be announced or even discussed for quite some time though.
---
That, or they've already decided to just keep it vanilla, but their naming of it "classic" makes me think otherwise.
---
You're not going to run ZG for a looong time ! It's in phase 3 or 4 ?
---
Leaving this up and flairing it as **Humor**. It's either humor, or it's removed as misinformation in the case that it's not a joke.
---
These are people that played classic for years on private servers. They go hard at launch/new phases but after that they raid 1-2 times a week like any casual guild.
---
Dude I'm not under a non disclosure agreement. I never made any kind of agreement with Blizzard. I am just a small youtuber/streamer trying to bring all the information I have compiled to light. Information that is mind you PUBLICLY AVAILABLE via tweets and said clips.
---
Yea because you know 40 man raid groups in all greens were just running through MC on the private sever you played.
---
&gt; Permanent, official servers
---
I felt this way about halo 2. I miss it ;(
---
Yup. Somewhere between day 10-12.
---
Private severs are much different my friend.
---
couldn't agree more.
---
Even if it fails, 100k players is nothing to scuff at. Depending on how much resources they used to make vanilla happen, they are most likely turning big profit from it.
---
Horde all the way. Alliance just has shitty races, like why the fuck would I wanna play a human, gnome or dwarf? Might as well stick a stick up my ass and call my sally.
---
and YES. I have made some conspiracies based on that information! Is it so wrong to speculate? Also, I do not run adds or have any form of add sense account made. Sure I might gain a subscriber or two for the information. I am not doing this for any financial gain, in fact the only reason I made the video is because they banned me.
---
Golden!
---
There was an episode of Countdown to Classic where one of the discord members explained the reason for this in detail.
---
Essentially, when the game first came out, people didn’t know how dungeons worked, Deadmines is first for Alliance, and seeing as how you aren’t pointed directly at that dungeon (it’s deep in a Defias hideout/mine/cave for crying out loud), your first exposure to this dungeon isn’t “here, go to this dungeon”, it’s the quest chain for Van Cleef - people would complete the quest chain, see that they need a group to complete the next step, and announce “Looking for Group: Van Cleef” because they had no idea it was in the Deadmines, so this stuck around and the dungeon became VC, WAY before Dire Mail came out, so the argument that “Deadmines came first, therefore DM is always Deadmines” is not all that relevant, since it was called VC before Dire Maul as well.
---
Yeah fuck people who do this. Any time I want to look for a release date for ANYTHING; anime, movies, video games, the first dozen or so search results are bullshit clickbait like this. Fuck these people and fuck Google for letting it happen.
---
Typically while leveling its Cat Form. However, they have a variety of ways to tackle solo play. In PvP, especially world PvP you'll be changing forms a lot. Bear charge, kitty pounce, shifting to heal or cure poison or just to go to travel form to get the fuck out of there.
---
They're also pretty decent farmers, even in a resto spec.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9jzdxy/supposed_classic_launch_detail_leaks/
---
This old speculation post is feeling really interesting right now. I've been thinking we wouldn't get classic till after bfa 8.2 launched (no way their release management team wants to overlap major releases) but what if we're getting it before? 
---
We could be getting open beta in next week or two with a release start of June
---
It’s not like they just reused the old code, I’m sure it will be a lot longer than a weekend. My guess a month or two. I would be shocked if they went live before September but I hope they prove me wrong.
---
Office wow memes
---
Your title is hurting my eyes!
---
“Cannot wait to enter DM again...”
---
Or
---
“Cannot wait to go to the entrance of DM again...”
---
The way you have it, it sounds like you want to put DM in a trance (entrance) again. Unless that was your intention all along, in which case... carry on 👍🏼
---
Ffs Tipsout show some respect to Blizzard that invited you in an inner cycle and don’t leak it that unprofessionally ... sellout.
---
Hopefully it’s the days long battle version, not the 15min version
---
Yeah, I always think that nobody else gets it. Hell, not even Blizzard thinks it will become a big thing. They announced "no major releases for 2019". Most sites do not even care to release news about classic. On my favorite gaming podcast (the biggest one in Germany), where they publish 5 casts a week - not a think. Not even a mention of classic.
---
Let's show them...
---
You may not be under NDA but those who have info are. Speculating is usually not wrong but there's a line to draw when contract terms are involved.
---
They didn't ban you for nothing, reflect on that.
---
Yes, /sit wont work ( it was taken out in vanilla patches and since we are getting 1.12 fully pached skills and talents... ). But reck is STILL good for leveling, you will get crit anyways. Only thing thats worth a damn in ret tree is MOVEMENT SPEED. Other than that its minor upgrades. Prot tree has best buffs and hit talents.
---
Hi, /u/Ferda_Waagh
---
It's pretty easy, actually. Just imagine it's a dedicated update rate for spells and abilities, capped at 14 updates split in between 100 milliseconds. So every 7 millisecond the server checks for spells being cast, interrupted, etc. So if you're fireball is set to launch at the 8th update (8 out of 14), and the rogues kick is cast in that same frame, your fireball will still cast.
---
That cancer of a website? That’s one part of the Vanilla experience I’d like to stay in 2005 where it belongs! 
---
Sorry... I’m just still sore from being told to “Thottbot it” whenever I would ask a question in general chat even though Thottbot did not have the answer and was overall a nightmare of a site to navigate. God bless WoWHead, for they rescued me from Thottbot.
---
Why have I not seen anybody call it a Goldshire retriever yet? It's so obvious, either I've just totally missed it or I'm ashamed if you all
---
Maybe on US Realms. Was never used on any EU server I played on.
---
Thats something i rly liked about classic having different weapons at the start with different races. The main reason I rolled an undead warrior and not an orc warrior was because I always liked the 1h shield look
---
https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/character/us/destromath/pahanda
---
Looks like the guy spends more time reveling in his unpaid green poster status than actually playing the game
---
But they wrote the damn thing as a professional article.
---
I loathe the term content creator. Content creators for classic is Blizzard. The content produced by these people is not part of classic.    
---
I create content for my toilet bowl, that doesn't mean anyone needs to see it.
---
I wouldn't worry about it, I'm sure we'll get vanilla sound.
---
Cute story and I like it. I played alpha, beta, and was there at release with my mini diablo. Never heard anything like it. DM was Deadmines, and in my experience was visited a lot because of the excellent loot and chance of both staff and wand for casters. On the other hand the Stockades were neglected a lot.
---
This old speculation post is feeling really interesting right now. I've been thinking we wouldn't get classic till after bfa 8.2 launched (no way they're release management team wants to overlap major releases) but what if we're getting it before? 
---
I'm having a hard time seeing this as humor honestly.
---
Seems to me more an attempt to speculate on info that may still be under NDA.
---
NDA is a serious business, I'm not aware of Blizzard ever banning people just for speculation or jokes, unless something serious is involved that may not be apparent to us.
---
lmao i haven't played since a month or two into the expac and i think even my lowest alt was higher ilvl than that
---
Seriously i dont get these people
---
&gt;Definitely.
---
Id say its more out of necessity. Not because you benefit from it. Normal mobs you either kill as kitty or bear if multiple targets. Changing form costs ton of mana that you want to use between pulls putting hots on you for the next pack.
---
Use uBlock Origin for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=ro) or for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/android/addon/ublock-origin/), dont use AdBlock it lets through some ads that they think it's unintrusive. uBlock Origin is hitler himself, nein ads will pass ever.

---
Fuck Blizzard HQ is in Irvine?  I've been there 3 times in the last 5 years for a BJJ tournament and had no idea, always looking for things to do there.  Is it visitor friendly?
---
Yeah but on the contrary you have zero downtime to eat and drink or run the hell out of there if you pull too many mobs. Also mobs aren't too spread out. There's tons of spots that are absolutely mob city, wipe galore.
---
The point is that the majority of players did not hear of a dungeon called Deadmines where you can get great loot, the majority who started out the game would just putt along on their toon doing quests until they came across this quest chain, reached the objective of “Kill Van Cleef” and started looking for a group for Van Cleef.
---
This isn’t my story - I started right when 1.12 began, but when I started in 1.12, that’s exactly how it happened to me as well. I had no idea the game had instances dungeons, all I saw was the objective to kill Van Cleef and great rewards for completing said quest, so I started looking for a group for it with no idea that it was a dungeon (yes, the quest said in parenthesis that this was a dungeon, but I had no idea what “dungeons” were in the game). So based on my personal experience, his story checks out. On my server people called it VC as well. I’ve only seen it called DM twice in my entire time playing the game and both times they were corrected by others.
---
WoWhead was what made me install an adblocker in the first place.
---
I thought Hunters with focus made a lot of sense. Never understood why they had mana back in Vanilla. That's probably the one example where a class was improved in Cata.
---
i miss you sound
---
That's pretty funny and kinda true on reflection.
---
If you’re not changing forms, you’re definitely gimping yourself. As a minimum, you should keybind your forms (along with all of your other abilities) but to get the most out of a Druid, you’ll need a lot of macros.
---
Your attitude is shite. Be inclusive; the more the merrier.
---
Yeah idk he probably just plays his druid as an alt now is my guess. I just like ribbing on green posters. I always hated their fake cheery attitudes and brown nosing
---
!remindme 1 day
---
It is based on survey data. It is not a representative sample. How many knew of Warcraftrealms? How many kids ? When I was 10 I wasn’t reading guides or answering surveys when playing wow. I was keyboard turning right off the elevator of thousand needles.
---
Take it with a grain of salt, IMO.
---
Joana and Kungen were like poster-boys for Vanilla WoW, how dissappointing.
---
Remove it then. I am not joking. You can feel free to flag this as misinformation if you want after May 14th when I have promised to make an announcement, and hell I'll even make a public apology and accept a ban here if I am wrong. I would certainly classify it as misinformation if I am wrong... but seeing as how the information I have has not been proven to be wrong, it is technically not misinformation *yet.*
---
I firmly believe that I am correct. I believe that my information is accurate and that Blizzard is set to make an announcement about a Beta and/or release date potentially before May 14th, or possibly today.
---
I am not under an NDA. As I have mentioned I have collected publicly available information about the event in Irvine. Towelliee's statement is a big indicator considering HE WAS THERE.

Make your own judgments. I am simply providing the evidence and if that is "Misinformation" than so be it! I just think calling it misinformation before the potential upcoming announcement is a bit weird. As if it turns out to be true... then it wasn't Misinformation it was fact and accurate information.
---
In summary. Do what you want with this post. I'm either right, or I am wrong. Only time will tell. If I am wrong, you all can laugh at Wolf the fool.
---
Good Day.

Regards Wolf.

&gt; green posters are the biggest fucking bootlickers.
---
I still remember one German MVP, Karash, resigning because he did not like the course Blizzard took WoW on in *2009*. That's integrity right there, and looking at what WoW is today, and how uncritically many MVPs stand right beside Blizzard, I just cannot muster any kind of respect for them any more.

---
It might just be an internet culture thing, aside from the few Great Flame Wars there wasn't that much intersecting between people with different interests to each other.
---
Now I guess since we have many more combined media platforms and both versions share the same general forums it's easier to fling shit.
---
Maybe this is just what humans do *shrug* still though when doom 4 released there wasn't some huge backlash about returning to classical design trends in arcade shooters.
---
Should give anyone who has a sub in vanilla, first dibs on names, limiting it to 1 per realm.
---
thats why you do it with your group before the dungeon
---
Bonus, I'll even unlist the video until May 14th. I'll be sure to make it public again if I am right. If I am wrong I will own up and say sorry.
---
Has tips made a video about him being a sellout yet?
---
If true big
---
I’ve done a few trips to deadmines on my horde (only ever played horde) back in the day. Going through Stv as a lvl 18 is harsh :)
---
Scriptcraft was around by 2012. Saying it only kicked up two years ago is absolutely ridiculous. Vanilla has been around for quite a while, and was getting big as early as '13.
---
Most likely because they were WoW players, not gamers per se.
---
They dipped when WoW changed too much for their taste, and they stopped playing games overall so they don't keep up with any news
---
also level every class :D
---
and yes technically it is beatable but the investment it would take to do so would equate the cumulative content from the past 3 expansions.
---
that has to be the most retarded idea I’ve ever heard

This low effort meme is allowed but mines arent, i give up mods you win.

Are you playing om private server already? Might be and oppotunity to join already?

I'm an experienced raider/raid leader full swapping to classic after it comes out, and am looking for a guild that intends on pushing hard to be realm first. I started raiding heavily during MoP, and have pushed Heroic/Mythic level content since Siege of Orgrimmar on live, all the way through Uldir where I stopped playing BfA. Currently, I am playing/leveling on a vanilla server to get myself very familiar with the Classic world and challenges prior to launch so I can hit the ground running after release.
---
I am looking for a guild that has a competitive mindset, with players who seek to improve each other as well as themselves. Classic is definitely about community, and I hope to find that community with a guild of people who also want to do everything they can to push ahead of the pack. Getting 40+ people online together is no easy task, and I hope that any guild I'm joining respects the time that everyone else is putting in for raids by coming prepared, or asking for help if they need it to be ready as an individual. And most importantly, I'm looking for a group of people who wants to have fun while they do it! Just because you are serious about progression doesn't mean you can't be having a great time with friends while you go.

He have mentioned that it's near impossible for him to play the game, until he can farm instances.

He's aware of how annoying it can become.

Alliance is playing WoW on easy difficulty. Paladins make PvE a breeze. Threath, what's that? Easier Alterac Valley. Nerds jacking off to Night Elfs.

Horde is harder both PvE and PvP. I'm not here to play on Dora the Explorer. I will roll Horde.

---
tested and approved.
---
&lt;Stoked&gt; will be a hard core PVE focused raiding HORDE guild on PVE oceanic servers.
---
A number of people have contacted me about the guild but would prefer PVP servers. I would change with enough interest. Feel free to contact me.
---
**Main goals:** 
---
	To have fun enjoying wow classic.
---
	To push our class and raids to the limit.
---
	To clear all content efficiently.
---
	To clear Molten Core in week 4
---
**Raids Schedule:**
---
Progression raiding: up to 4 nights per week.
---
When content on farm: one to two nights per week.
---
Raid Nights: SUN/MON/TUES/THURS
---
Raid Times: GMT +10 (Times to be decided)
---
20 man raids will be on off nights or a night when no 40 man raids are scheduled. 
---
Example: 
---
Onyxia Sunday night, Molten core Monday night, Onyxia Thursday night
---
AQ40 Progression Sunday and Monday night, Molten Core and Blackwing lair Tuesday night, Chill 20man raids Thursday night.
---
**Member Expectations:**
---
	
---
Members are expected to be willing to learn their class and role. To be willing to change 	when needed and and become a better player. You do not have to have hard core raiding 	experience or Vanilla wow experience. These things are of course welcomed but not 	essential. Members need to behave in a mature, professional, team focused manner. I want to 	foster a fun-loving gaming environment where every member is important and not just a 	name on a roster.
---
**Loot System:**
---
TBA (possibly loot council/DKP hybrid. Will be decided closer to launch)
---
**Contacts:**
---

Regarding the trainer you can use moonglad teleport to train over there, and to back to you current pex ING zone
---
Love the old splash screens!
---
1) depends on the server 
---
2) hey look, another one!
---
why are you getting downvoted :P obviously it is a realistic speculation as to what might come next. people... if you don't agree say why in a reply don't downvote someone because you don't like his opinion on a very valid possibility...
---
personally, i really hope IF they decide to release tbc again, that they keep classic servers up and have you copy you characters to tbc ones or even start fresh.
---
I’ve been playing regular old Warcraft III. Totally holds up as far as I’m concerned, I don’t feel there’s any need for a remaster in my life.
---
You still don't get it, do you?
---
It doesn't matter how "accurate" your info may be, if they're under NDA **you have no right to post them**, you shouldn't do it. Period.
---
I never signed a Non Disclosure Agreement with Blizzard Entertainment.
---
Im grateful to still play on my very first account since 05
---
Cheers mate.
---
Thank you! People love to shit on every new generation, even though ”WoW Kids” were exactly the equivalent of fortnite kids of today. At least I was.
---
The video is really bad. Volume is extreme quiet then loud and makes it unwatchable. Redo.
---
I have no right to collect publicly available information about an content creator event? I think you don't get it lol.
---
The sad/depressing/terrifying thing about Alex Jones that most people overlook is that less than 100% of the things he says are outrageous conspiracy theories. Some of the stuff he rants about like a lunatic end up being true a couple years later.
---
I honestly can't remember if it did.
---
I'll reflect on your virtue signaling non sense.
---
VC might be a Horde thing too since most players would never go to Deadmines  on their horde character.
---
Hi
---
I'm getting downvoted because I forgot to say that the above is only my opinion and I'm not stating some kind of fact.
---
And yeah part of it probably is like you say, some folks downvoting it just because they don't like the idea of a progressive server, or they get defensive when I suggest that blizzard might not have any classic servers that stop all progression at the end of their content and stay frozen there forever.
---
I imagine that since blizzard is taking the time to get input from a number of big names in the private server community, that these people will no doubt talk about the propensity of a large portion of the private server Community to play and replay and replay content and absolutely adore fresh servers.
---
I absolutely don't think blizzard will do this.
---
As an altoholic this is unnerving. 
---
Another thing, hoping you don't end up maining on a the same server as a popular streamer.
---
NDAs only apply to the parties that sign it... If you come across information that was meant to be under a NDA but had no knowledge that it was confidential then should you be punished for sharing it? No, because you had not signed the NDA in the first place.
---
Whats toxic about trading in Poe? Ive played it for years and not really noticed anything.
---
I think maybe it might have been a server by server thing rather than a regional thing? Back in the day, no one on my server (Shattered Hand EU) used VC, everybody used DM. On other servers, maybe it was different?
---
He is writing about paladins having a slow damage rotation mostly dependant on white melee swings. So he watches porn and whatever while playing.
---
It's an old humourus post and having levelled a paladin and several other classes myself I find it not really that true. Most classes have a button or two to press for a damage "rotation" in classic and paladins, while probably the least involced rotation, are not that different from the rest.
---
"All I can say".
---
Blizzard is probably going to spank him, because even that is a tad bit too suggestive. Then again it would not surprise me if these streamers came up with specific lines to subtly hint and they ran them by Blizzard at this meeting as a way to low-key drum up some interest.
---
I mean there may be other people under NDA and you could be mistaken for one of those people leaking something giving Blizzard a reason to delete your stuff promptly.
---
Why 4 warriors?
---
Yes. Piecing together what streamers have said in the last few days  points to some big announcement coming in May.
---
That was pretty obvious for months mate.
---
So there is only one build and it's max main. Typical pvm boy. Vote Yes to pvp polls
---
i don't understand why are you getting this pissed about it :/
---
clearly a troll
---
No gifts 😂 you expect too much
---
It's good for leveling. You aren't gonna have a pocket shaman following you around.
---
I'M A CONDUIT OF NATURE!
---
Most people think they're speedleveling and it will still take like 1,5 month++
---
I often hear this - it was likely a based on the server.
---
I was on Bleeding Hollow (US)
---
Well yeah but classic wowhead is very much incomplete as of now. I'm sure it will get better but for now I'd recommend using classicdb.
---
You just want to be ahead of him stop lieing
---
Wrong screen for dm, also it has been said already 🤷🏻‍♂️ east, notth or west? 🧐
---
Yeah I cant wait to look at some boobies while leveling my dwarf pally
---
Aquatic form and Bear are the only two forms that have quests associated with them, and aquatic iirc is in moonglade, to which you can teleport. So you should be gucci so long as you get abolish poison as well as lunaclaw done in darkshore.
---
https://youtu.be/dH5fXWIAQqU
---
I'm speculating that they'll announce the release date on the first day of summer.
---
Not to mention the complicated process that was Jailbreak in BRD.
---
Did we miss hydraxian waterlords?
---
Unless there's something I missed, Spirit Bond is absolutely useless.
---
You regen 2% of your life every 10s, this is about 80 HP every 10s at lvl 60 in blue gear.
---
Or if you have only 1 HP left this talent would need more than 8 minutes to put you back full (natural health regen not included).
---
I would use this template : [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#cxcMdbxoZtVohthZ0xo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#cxcMdbxoZtVohthZ0xo)
---
They've said that they're going to reinstate all old art assets I believe, which should include all old sounds
---
People just like shitting on him
---
Do you have to opt in somewhere on your account to potentially get invited to a beta? or is it just luck of the draw and you don’t have to do anything?
---
you forgot the /s m8
---
Staysafe is literally the only one who made content during Nost, you fat, vaping, disgusting creature.
---
Hi, /u/Arviee
---
I would love if they had something like a title or a pet :D
---
Something like "Returning Heroe" or so... 
---
But yeah - I´m hyped I can barely sit still xD
---
Only reason I'm rushing is because I want to grind things to sell and corner the market on the AH so I can set the prices of goods on my server, and make money hand over foot.
---
There are so many more hidden or unreachable places: Old Ironforge, Karazhan, parts of Stonetalon Mountains etc.
---
There's a lot of room for additional content.
---
Sauce?
---
&gt; meant to be under a NDA but had no knowledge that it was confidential
---
Yeah because noone knows that those invited to Blizzard are not talking *YET* for a reason ... you're joking right?
---
You make it sound too straightforward. Even if technically that's true, for the majority of players (if they choose to "beat" the game) it will take years.
---
Pservers fought this by simply launching fresh servers, been doing that for 10 years now and the vanilla servers we're/are the most played version of the game overall.
---
There are ways to keep the game interesting without having to add content. D2 is still played and it didn't add anything since LoD. It's just how Vanilla WoW was structured. The heavy reliance on RPG and the social aspect added tremendous amount of replayability. It's how that genre works, it pretty much sustains itself.
---
Yeah, I thought Dire Maul, too, but looking at the picture, I was like, "wait, that's... that's VC..." I don't know anyone who called it DM, or even Deadmines. It was always VC &lt;3
---
Unless you're the first to get a rare pattern, I never heard of anyone making money with blacksmithing.
---
BS is useless while levelling since you will be able to craft something that is about 10 lvl less than your actual lvl.
---
If I was playing a pally I'd go for engi instead.
---
Nah, I was Ally and everyone called it VC, too.
---
100% yes, I was trying to aim at more of the reputations that you'll gain access too whilst travelling through azeroth how ever I appreciate your insight.
---
I thought they said wall climbing wouldn't be in WoWclassic?
---
Lol, recognized your desk straight away. Ember!
---
I thought they said wall climbing wouldn't be in WoWClassic?
---
Never gets old 😂
---
yea it actually is starting to feel oddly convenient. the post said release will be april/june 2019. and it also states that it will have a short beta. if we actually get the beta next week. lets say may 17th, and it last 2-3 weeks. Fun fact summer officially starts 21st of June and it's a Tuesday. That line from previous bluepost "get ready for a classic summer" would have been spot on.
---
Only if it were true. i sure hope so!

Clownsuits were the order of the day.

you will be getting so  much trash blue and greens anyway, so wont need so much tailoring for materials, its just a good combo, not 100% necessary to be tailor enchanter

when I leveled my druid, I only really used Cat form. I'd toss some hots on just as I was entering the fight, and go cat to DPS them down. I only really used bear form if I was with a group so I'd tank the elite or boss.
---
well it just depends, i was just thinking pvp-wise cause you get good spell gear in AQ apparently
---
It's a real thing. A huge block of text from Blues from the various times it had been mentioned

This looks like one of those costumes/potions you get from the Darkmoon Faire or Brew Fest. Scare some low level human by dressing up as a Tauren and /dance-ing with everyone... oh, just me?
---
For a moment i saw Falkor.
---
I disagree, I never heard it called VC it was always just the deadmines.  Loved this instance, it was brilliant. Looking forward to doing it, even as horde! :D
---
Ahh nice! We're growing :D
---
Personally, I think that warlock or hunter are "easiest" to level because they have a pet that can take the damage for them. But things like mage are very straightforward damage dealing characters that have simple to understand gameplay.
---
This made me laugh so f\*cking hard &gt;.&lt;
---
Week 2 is still pushing it for a horde guild, the ony attunement is about 10+ hours, for the Uber’s key then to run Uber’s 3 times and run Lbrs and then finding rexxar and the world dragons, it’s doable in 1 sitting but it would take an absurd amount of hearthing and chopping your Uber’s run into 3 pieces.
---
never heard this once in all the time I played vanilla. It was always called the DMs or Deadmines. Never heard it referred to as Van Cleef.
---
Imagine having a nazi general as your profile name. Cringe Wehraboo
---
Oh, yeah there is gear for that there.
---
I'm getting more psyched about Office memes being posted than a release date.. Wait are you a Blizzard spy? What is going on??
---
Bite my ss.. its vc on eu servers for "van cleef" and dm for diremaul you filthy casual.
---
Look at the norks on that Norc etc
---
Easily the most fun I've had playing WoW. Mistweaver Monk in raids was just brilliant. When I saw the pre-patch hit and my class get completely reworked and destroyed I was honestly lost for words. It completely ruined the game for me - no exaggeration - I haven't raided properly since and don't even have an active sub anymore.
---
Right, but they themselves publicly shared that information. If anyone is in breach of an NDA it's the content creators for sharing an unauthorised tweet. But the reality is that those tweets have probably already been authorised by Blizzard themselves. Once information is in a public space like that is free game. Speculating that these content creators have visited Blizzard for stuff related to Classic WoW based on **their tweets** does not count as breaching **their NDA**.
---
Hunter would be the class that’s most noob friendly with leveling. Your hunter pet will keep the enemy’s off you and has minimal downtime.
---
Same I have 2 accounts  2nd one has most new stuff, 1st one has my original rogue level 70 only
---
The man is right though, releasing classic is going to cannibalize their own audience severely.  
---
Although they may be reaching a point with retail wow where the curve is headed downwards so fast, that they are willing to try "anything".
---
Do you need professions to kill Lucifron?
---
Thanks a lot for your time replying :)
---
I think you are massively overestimating what it takes to get BiS from Naxx and to get to Rank 14.  Folk playing vanilla for 2-3 yrs, didnt get near to naxx, not many guilds had AQ40 on full Farm either, and even when they did, it still took a long time for hardcore raiding guilds, doing this week in week out, to gear up 40-50 raiders with all the drops they needed.  
---
You'd be lucky if 5% of those playing in Vanilla ever set foot in Naxx, and probably less than 1% killed Kel 'Thuzad, and even less had Naxx on Farm before TBC came out. 
---
I also doubt very much whether any hardcore raider had time to pvp to Rank 14 either. 
---
So even if folk are playing Classic for 5 yrs or so, I cannot see many walking about in Full Naxx Gear, turning their attention to getting Rank 14. 
---
I'm excited that when playing, I can do a lot of things without there being an expansion on the horizon. Many players will look for a tBC classic server in several years time, but a lot of players wont. Many want classic to stay classic and stay at 60 being the level cap.  This is what is making me come back and play, and I cant wait to do so.
---
btw
---
bfa was mid august 
---
legion was end of august
---
wod was mid november
---
mop was mid september
---
cata was early december
---
what most expansions recently have been release in september ?:P
---
I feel the same im only excited for beta because it means theyre doing something and its going forward!
---
21st of June is the 1st official day of the summer. it comes right between FFXIV and ESO expansions and it is a tuesday.
---
might be ?
---
Great picture, good memories! There is something haunting about this picture. I'm playing the Tanaris music in my head. Damn, good times. :')

What is wrong with Shai Hulud?

Too late. They already have your IP address and will blow up the hypervisor by \~hacking\~

Make sure that this new gear you are going to get every day actually is gear you need.
---
yea I agree - if the speculations are correct. But we could be way off and he could be trolling. It's still just rumors regarding them visiting blizz, right?
---
Rick Grimes?
---
Good point. It could very well be a coordinated effort between the group of them to generate a few more Revenue clicks.
---
Is that on US servers? Im on EU. I never heard VC at any point during vanilla or later on any server I [played. Dire M](https://played.DM)aul was always reffered with the wing of choice. DM-E etc. and Deadmines was always DM.
---
So what happens after naxx? 
---
*runsawayinfear*
---
I am reminded of Dunmer from The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind.
---
You are making the wait so much better, thank you.
---
I have the Monday after the final GoT off work already, let's hope this has some weight to it.

I played paladin from beta until TBC came out, as a main, and my only character. Didn't even get him past 60. NEVER AGAIN!
---
Delet this.
---
I played vanilla as alliance on the US servers first (brother moved over there from the UK), so it allowed us to play together. We were were in a high end raiding guild, cleared Aq40 and into Naxx (although not too far - never got past the 4H men).  
---
He moved back to the UK and we still played the US server for about 6 more months. When we heard the expansion was coming out, we bought the EU version, and re-rolled Horde (as he had pals who were raiders on horde side). I was a little reluctant as I had only ever played alliance, and got to Rank 12 (Marshall) as a Dwarf Hunter. I always seen the horde as the baddies.  We thought we could get to 60 before the expansion hit, and it was a good time to start again on the EU servers. 
---
When we re-rolled, the horde community couldnt have been better. We started on Argent Dawn, and random folk would help you, level 60's would enchant your gear for free, give you items to help you (ie small bags etc), as I was leveling, even without guildies help, finding groups was good and I found there was way less drama with horde players.
---
I dont know if horde players are generally older, or more mature, but it definitely felt that way for us. Maybe it was the US alliance server which had more Alliance drama, who knows.  
---
Anyway, I played horde on to Cata was released, and then couldnt really play as I had a kid on the way. I now have a wife, and 2 kids (7 &amp; 5 yrs), and a pretty time demanding job. I plan to play from 8pm-12am most nights when I can, and want as little drama as possible, so will definitely be rolling on Horde again once classic is released.
---
One thing I like about vanilla WoW is that the mechanics are set up in such a way that it forces players to be patient and friendly to have the best chances of success. Because forming groups is time-consuming and difficult, you're heavily incentivized to act kindly (to make people *want* to play with you) and to build up a friends list (by acting consistently sociable).
---
I'm confident that any "Fortnite kiddies" who play the game will quickly learn how to act around others or have no fun and quit.

Rolling priest or hunter, really stuck between viability vs solobility, ya know? Pvp I'm gunna do shadow or MM

There is a Classic WOW Guilds recruitment on Discord.
---
Dad n Mum?
---
you are absolutly right. my bad i confused them
---
Blizzard doesn't want to advertise classic since then craptavision will want to add MTX to it.
---
Last time I made this correction people downvoted the shit out of me. Glad to see someone else sticking up for the VC name.
---
Yeah I guess it’s a US thing
---
If you have gear enough your going to melt faces with shadow
---
I went there a good bit during the twinking days. Going through StV was indeed hellish.
---
Yea, if you are starving and you have a bowl of delicious food in Front of you, you will enjoy it and  eat reeeeaaally slow. Everyone knows that. /ironyoff
---
I really really really want to play my feral druid, since thats what I did in TBC, Wrath and Cata. But just researching it is so underwhelming. Armor change came in 1.2, need to farm the Gnomer, and constantly go the extra mile, when I dont think I have the time for such a commitment.
---
I loved tanking in the above mentioned expansions, but now I feel like if I want to tank again, I need to bite the bullet and roll a warrior.
---
don't feed the clickbate. The only site we need is the blizzard site to know when wow classic is going to be released.
---
Final frame tells all
---
Usually when this is discussed I put forward the same arguments and I am upvoted around european day time. When I wake up the morning after US East and West day time, I've been downvoted into oblivion. So as an anecdote I think its mainly an US/EU thing.
---
Same, day one and wow closed beta accound 
---
My old char is still there :) 
---
Gonna build a new raid from with members and friends that crossed our way through all addons 
---
Going to be fun :)

None. Pvp is stupid

let us donate to ur paypal so u can buy a PC before classic comes out /u/Provosorisk
---
Yeah you are right in that most folk are lying when they say they cleared Naxx in Vanilla. I was in a hardcore raiding guild and we had 40-60 great raiding players. We had Cleared AQ40 (but was still a tough instance to clear in 1 night, even when everyone was well geared from BWL and previous AQ40 bosses).  
---
Just gaining access to Naxx was a pain and cost a lot of gold to get attuned. 
---
We could do Anub (the spider boss), Patchworks, &amp; Noth, but the other bosses were so hard.  Dont even remember getting to the 4H men at all in Vanilla before tBC hit. 
---
I see many folk saying "what after naxx"?!?!  Even 4yrs after Classic has been released, there will be less than 10% of players raiding Naxx and even getting to Kel'Thuzad.
---
Tanking raids is a huge time commitment no matter what class you play.
---
But tanking dungeons is great as a druid so you have no worries there.
---
Blood Elf male laugh my dude. That’s the inspiration.
---
Erwin Rommel was never a member of the Nazi party and helped plan the failed assassination attempt on Hitler. It’s a common misconception though so I’ll forgive your naivety.
---
Fuck, your right. I'll reupload and delete this so I dont spoil it.
---
You mean VC
---
There's a nice way to tell someone about a language mistake and then there's what you just did...
---
I'm guna try to take my 2 weeks vacation when it releases and just go balls out
---
DM will always be deadmines for me.
---
Imagine thinking Rommel and the Wehrmacht were muh evil national socialists. 
---
Cringe historyphobia.
---
I think it would be more efficient to respec shadow with which you can farm efficiently than to lvl an alt that will have to be geared too.
---
This is all fantastic.
---
Fuck, your right. I'll note this for next videos so it wont happen again. Thanks for telling me mate, I'm learning every day as I roll these out.
---
“Do I have to be a dwarf priest”
---
Fake ! The UD would have already ate the dog by now.
---
Gems and glyphs would be great additions IMO. "Gemology" was in the early beta builds but never got fleshed out.
---
Learning is a good thing but I honestly think that the last frame was excellent =)
---
I just got my old account back. After Wrath I quit for a long while then came back but forgot all my info so I have a 2nd I used since WoD to tour the expansions. Never stuck with it.
---
All loot is hunter loot
---
Not possible
---
I mean the 1.12 Ragnaros was a lot easier than the pure vanilla one, but no way.
---
The record to get level 60 is 4d 20h
---
That leaves two days if you find 40‘people to do the same, no sleep and record like leveling, for getting enough gear and arguments plus clearing the rest
---
I think we are losing it
---
Whats your favourite podcast
---
Oh, I tought you ment that the last frame came first when you saw the video. Did for me, but maybe because I watched it and wanted to replay. Again, totally new at this. 48 hour-ish long career as "TOP Dog" editor.
---
Once again this post wasn't about me. It's just like y'all to twist my post. I literally singled myself out for a reason.
---
Thank you my dude 🐕
---
Negative by miles
---
Access to beta would be awesome. I do not expect nor want something in the actual game. If there was some kind of title then people would be even more smug about playing Vanilla from release.
---
Where I come from, if you say "the wife" it would be as well received as if you said "the thing" :D
---
You must be fun at partys
---
This thread is missing an important video
---
https://youtu.be/qX7ehxyYRQc
---
Such click bait.
---
Secret agent with the sole purpose of distracting us from a delayed release date! You read it here first!
---
They just use this as a landing page and will update it when more news comes out about classic. It allows them to generate page rank so when the release date is actually announced, they hope this page will be at the top of Google search results for "Wow classic release date".
---
Still a shitty tactic.
---
That’s a clean setup and I am envious
---
Imagine being in a guild that thinks world firsts in vanilla matter.
---
I, of course, now expect a Goldshire dog named after me.
---
I don't think WoW Classic will be as addictive as it was, particularly if you played vanilla back in the day, or even retail. It's just that we have seen and experienced most of the game already, so the highs won't be as high this time. Before everything was new and exciting and drew you back into the game constantly. Another thing was that a lot (or even most) of our friends were playing WoW with us before, so the chance of hanging out with friends outside of WoW was lower. At least in my case I have much fewer friends starting Classic, so there will be this extra incentive to take a break from the game. In short I think most of us will be fine this time around. The experience in many ways won't be the same as back in 2005.  
---
I actually made a video response to this question, hope it's cool that I post the link here: [https://youtu.be/4-tVX2DRkVQ](https://youtu.be/4-tVX2DRkVQ)
---
Exactly! Even for method guild, I think it’s going to be unrealistic to raid on week 1 (maybe a boss AT BEST)
---
By wrath the game already had completely different philosophy, and so was the playerbase. There were more wrath babies than original vanilla players. That's why you cannot even say wrath was dogshit because most people started in wrath. Of course they are gonna think it's the best expansion. 
---
The problem with wrath is that it's based on catering to bads and casuals, wrath was not incremental change from tbc and vanilla but total 180 degree swap. And after wrath every incremental change is for worse and worse, as the casuals and bads want more and more catering. There is no going back from that and BFA is just completely logical result of incremental changes from wrath, because of its different playerbase from vanilla and TBC.
---
My apologies - meant no disrespect and was only trying to come off as casually humorous.
---
We dont play on any pserver, but we have a discord which is activly in use. If you want to join the guild you will have to join the discord. My discord name is Sindrex#4881. Add me and we will talk :)
---
Naxx was my first raid that I ever did, I was not in a guild that you would call a hardcore raiding guild we wiped a lot and it was really enjoyable learning all the fights/mechanics.
---
&gt;  ...people subbed to retail by the end of june get a 3-day head start 
---
... but you have to sub to wow anyway? I get what you mean but it literally doesn't do anything because they won't have seperate subs.
---
If by bashed you mean realistic of how the game operated early on then sure. Y'all can twist it however you want. But just because I didn't March with you and your movement didn't mean I was against it.  There is already vods the fucking day of nost going down where I specifically said if there was legit legacy servers I would play. I mean I have a 60 in ND, had toons on Fenix for while. Was first person on Twitch to ever be timed out banned for playing Private server. But yeah dude I'm anti classic?
---
Wrong I'm anti cesspool of children who zerged all retail channels harassing streamers for days about nost and signing petitions and shit. So yeah fat ass whatever blah blah have a nice day.
---
If you're going to run with paladin, I suggest you pick human for the +10% bonus reputation racial because you're damn going to need it when you cry ugly tears from running BRD 50 times to grind the rep with the Thorium Brotherhood.
---
I think we need share our great gif abilities with r/borderlands. Surely we can't keep these top tier gifs only for ourselves!
---
&gt;Anyone still playing retail literally \[...\]
---
\[...\] has no clue what a MMO is. :o

You're gonna want to fuck me in a little bit I tell you that much

Summer only starts in less than a month but ya know...   😕

It did look cool with a decent enchant too.

That's probably the cataclysm prepatch event, where rifts appeared at random locations popping elementals

Mind Blast on 7 but PW:F on 2, good old times.

He'd be more popular but he hangs out with discount asmongold (staysafe) and esfand who has a great personality. That's like going to a bar with handsome wingmen.

Nice karma farming post. They are the same site to all intent and purposes.

Thank you for this, it definetely did!

Rolling warlock, and havent rly decided wich of the many viable specs im gona use, but prolly for destruction / affliction build.

Did you by any chance play on the echeloned wow wotlk blizzlike server as a human called Vexxen?

Im worried about this happening even sooner than 2-3 years tbh
---
I did not.

I get naked and pelvic thrust people when they don’t like it

I'm sorry but that would be hilarious.

Leave it to the US to once again come up with their completely illogical abbreviations.
---
Reminds me of the South Park episode where Randy desperately needs to watch porn and goes to the *Internet refugee camp*
---
If blizzard invited him to try out the Beta and told him any information we don’t know, he shouldn’t have said anything in my opinion
---
I think it's an American thing, they love doing everything perpendicular to the rest of the world.
---
So we have to wait untill the 24th before get anymore signifciant blue posts like a release date?
---
Lol aint that the truth. Just gotta be different at all times with anything.
---
This is so dumb. I love it
---
I don't watch GoS. I thought it ended already?
---
Alternatively, you can still just type in [Thottbot.com](https://Thottbot.com) to get to [classic.wowhead.com](https://classic.wowhead.com) .
---
That amount of active players actually gives me anxiety. I don’t want it to be too overwhelming tbh.
---
Fuck. Yes.
---
From what I gather, he's talking about an event that was supposed to be on the 24th but got pushed.
---
10/10 would tinfoil again
---
That guy is 'Nileseyy Niles' a Youtuber, his video's are so funny!
---
Yep! I remember I used to grind wow between rounds of jacking off. Just had porn constantly running on the second screen. 
---
It was a very depressed time....
---
Wut ? Broke TOS in what way, you havent agreed to any TOS with blizzard regarding classic wow ? If you play in a private server you arent breaking ANYTHING. Only thing you could do is break TWITCH rules if you stream it. Just like when you watch recorded TV shows off youtube.
---
Only people liable is hosting the service.
---
/r/ShittyWoWLore
---
It happened on the 8th.
---
Matter? Eh, that's all subjective. Retail server firsts in every expansion didn't matter to lots of people.  What matters to some wont to others. If I could find a group of people who wanted to attempt 1st week rag kill and I had the time I would love to try, but it's not like it matters, esp nothing the grand scheme of things.
---
Allakazam was FFXI.  Thottbot was WoW and only Thottbot.
---
In BFA i love healing with the druid and popping into Cat Form to deal some Damage. Is it possible to do a likely thing in Classic. Or is it pure heals 0 DPS? 
---
I feel like i want to play druid but would level as kitty. Is Kitty bad for raids? I wouldnt mind tanking either but im scared swapping from heals to tank to DPS is gonna cost a fortune in respecs. Anyone knows if the cost is capped?
---
Looks like an Everquest model.
---
borderlands collie &lt;3

Okey

Classic frost build my dude

It's weird looking from outside in on all the speculation and I'm here at home /dancing
---
What program do you use to add the text?
---
After i move i can post something similar. I have all of those in collectors edition + both basic wow vanilla normal edition cover versions. And i had one US key bought (EU pleb) to play the first 6 months.
---
Yes but a number of WoW Classic Content Creators and Retail Content Creators were all missing on May 8th, with MrGM saying -  https://twitter.com/MrGMYT/status/1126176910826983424
---
Im also keen to see how it will turn out. The older players who played the original classic, bc when they were younger will probably stay. I wonder what the new generation will do. Classic won't have "make life easier" features at all, it will be grinding non stop if you want something
---
Me too lol, wishful thinking and insane speculation.
---
What if they are sticking so close to #nochange that only 1.5 million get to play at launch.

I hope they won't do it like this. I don't like retail wow and I don't want to pay early for retail just to get a headstart at classic, but this would kinda force me to. I believe they just need sharding in the first few weeks and then we're good.
---
Mind Blown
---
\*Puts the tinfoil hat back on and calculates the odds\*
---
&gt;I actually like the curated instanced dungeon content. It is still a shared space but just more controlled.
---
It provides a better gameplay experience but it goes against the shared world aspect of an MMO. It's a multiplayer mechanic rather than an MMO mechanic.
---
Retail is not an MMO anymore, that is true. 
---
Retail is closer to a looter-shooter, but that would only work for Hunters.
---
Looter-slasher maybe?
---
&gt; Paladin really died in my eyes when holy power was introduced
---
100%. literally killed the game for me
---
Bunch of cucks, those green posters.
---
Pls no, I got work today
---
Yup we used guild chat lol, literally makes no sense
---
I would go aff/dem in start until you get good gear. God aff/dem warlocks are so fkn tanky
---
Hope you have a designated dispeller :)
---
Semen
---
Yeah my plan is to level a hunter straight to 60 and use it to farm up what pre dungeon gear I can easily get and then farm gold for a little bit if no guilds have enough people to do dungeons or raid yet. 
---
But as soon as I am done with that I'll be starting over with a second class, whatever the people I meet may need be it a warrior or a healer.  Will be  ice to have a hunter to farm up some quick greens for the second character.
---
f
---
Lol. How are people this fickle?
---
What about Darkshire terrier? (Original character donut steel)
---
Its a good spec i know, but im rly hyped for the pom spec / elemental spec. If you good enough and have engi they can do some insane dmg + kiting
---
I think it should be a requirement that everyone who downvotes you makes a post after a guild downs Rag with level 58s in greens so we can publicly shame them.
---
Copyright law fool
---
Wait what. You got invited for naxx progress without gear from earlier raids?
---
&gt;in Desolace
---
Well there you have it. As someone who leveled there I can confirm no one ever goes there.
---
Clickbait over 9000! Tbh this is general practice. Discusting but general
---
He said he'll level as ret and actually plays holy, that's meta. The game will reward him for choosing correctly, as it should.
---
I don't believe that will be the case. I have a friend that works at blizzard not on classic, but at BLIZZARD. Anyway when I asked about beta keys a couple weeks ago they told me 'no keys for now, just employee alpha testing, but we should be getting keys soon' so if there is an announcement today it will be beta related. Maybe even a release date. But for sure not the game actually coming out.
---
The amazing dog crop aside, im going ally just to skip barrens, god i hate barrens.
---
Does it really tho? Aside from grinding the pre-raid bis on my holy paladin rest of the gearing was pretty much raid logging and I easily got full t2 + lok'amir and even won Ashkhandi for PvP.
---
April 05 reporting in can't wait to return home.
---
fuck yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
---
Well done for choosing tbe right faction. 
---
Hunters are considered the beginner class but they're actually pretty complicated and easy to cause mayhem with. Just try out a few claddes and go with what you like. You'll be in for a long journey so it's better to pick something you enjoy playing.
---
Wait what seriously?
---
Nice, I wish I had my old screenshots still
---
My friend you Sound a bit ill?
---
Off topic but you are forced to play and interact with people, that's literally what's great about vanilla.
---
I stopped raiding in Isle of thunder.  Played for a month on wod, then quit.  Came back for legion, and didn't even get my FH to lvl 100.  I was done man.
---
Then around Feb, this year I stumbled upon classic news and can't wait!  I was so excited I resigned this past week.   Man the game is bs now.  Was on my warrior, no stances, no charge?
---
Went on my rogue to play with my legendaries, proc has been removed?  Hunter has a melee spec?  .
---
So yeah, current game sucks, still excited for classic tho!
---
Not sweaty enough! Where's the Dorritos, the empty energy drinks and the pee bucket? This is the desk of a phony. If it's not duck taped and gritty, it's not right. No changes!
---
I think the osconty date is the open beta date personally. with 8.2 being a tier raid with lfr wings it fits perfectly for 8.2 to drop in june and then have the 4 to 5 week wait while rolling out lfr wings. That said closed beta probably comes in 2 weeks and lasts till July 16th.
---
the hype just died for me mate.
---
You could actually try reading too. Radical idea, I know.
---
If you buy reforged it gives you access to original roc and ft but its through battle.net to find the download link and it's a pain in the ass to find.
---
Fastest level 60 are like 4 days of /played time on empty server with unlimited gold and rested experience. Fastest MC clear on private servers is like 10 days with 60 people nolifing.
---
Doesnt even shit like 
---
/cast shadow aura
---
/cast frost aura
---
work there ? But if you want to really make a fancy macro, you could check if you have shadow aura on and if it is, cast frost. Cant remember the syntax of the top of my head (at work).
---
You actually don't see your own hipocrisy at all, do you? I'm genuinely impressed.

**&lt;Trivial&gt; OCE-PVP | Horde | Hardcore**    
---
Introduction  
---
&lt;Trivial&gt; is an AU based hardcore PvE &amp; PvP guild, run by an experienced officer team who have full cleared Naxx, controlled world bosses &amp; achieved multiple high PvP ranks. While good preparation is essential in succeeding in Vanilla WoW, community &amp; commitment are the two key aspects that hold guilds together.     
---
This philosophy is why we welcome all players to the guild; hardcore, casual, pve or pvp focussed. If you want to apply for a raider rank and progress through raid content with us, you are welcome. If you want to apply for PvP rank and attend our daily premades lead by previous top rankers, you are welcome. If you want to be part of destroying alliance in epic 100v100+ world PvP contests over world bosses - you are welcome. If you just want to slowly level and experience the content casually, you are welcome as we are an inclusive guild and always have members willing to help out.    
---
**Planned Raid Times (AEST +10GMT):**   
---
Wednesday - 7:30-1130pm  
---
Thursday - 7:30-1130pm   
---
Sunday - 7:30-1130pm AEST

First Raid will be 4 weeks after launch; more information in the discord. Loot Rules: Loot Council, more information in the discord.   All Member, Raider and PvP rules &amp; expectations are available on our discord, please come and check it out!  Faction cohesion is essential in controlling valuable resources (devilsaurs, world bosses, etc.) and we will be working with other Horde guilds on our server to ensure total dominance for the Horde. Our experienced officers have negotiated &amp; experienced such guild alliances and will strive to reach out to other guilds ASAP to ensure we have a productive and happy community.    
---
To reiterate we are welcoming ALL platers who want to experience this amazing MMO, not just the Hardcore! Feel free to join our discord to learn more, please pm officers with any questions you have :)

Yes, everyone I know does exactly that. But we eat good food so I dunno about trashfood and McDonalds.
---
Nein ads. rofll
---
yes i agree. am not saying hes right to "leak it" or hint at something blizzard told him under nda, i just don't get how mad the guy above gets at him.
---
felt closer to the reaction of a religious fanatic who had his god insulted.
---
Kind of intrigued about holy protadin.
---
I may never get to kill someone, but I will annoy the hell out of people while doing so.
---
Maybe try to remove the sound? Kind of hard to have a gif-war when you make a video.
---
My uncle worked at Sega. :P
---
Yes I believe you are correct. However....
---
\*Puts on world consuming Tinfoil hat\*
---
The theory must live on for the next 12 hours.
---
True. Blizz hasn't done any marketing at all which fits in with their obvious desire to spend as little money as possible on classic. I think it's a mistake on their part.
---
Thats sounds somewhat strange - maybe he had pvp gear?
---
Or he is speaking about WotLk's Naxx since it was the first raid there.
---
The instance is fucking huge. We did a complete trash clear of the outer ring in first week private server after killing KT, it took quite a while to do.
---
TipsOut just tryin to keep viewers with speculations. Nothing new.
---
\*Shakes The Tinfoil Hat\*
---
It says likely.
---
Do you think blizzard would really give a bunch of private server streamers the inside scoop?
---
Not as player though, so wgaf.
---
[This was the post he deleted, it's nothing special.](https://i.redd.it/eb6e2d2y79x21.jpg)
---
Let's get this straight right now. Dire Maul is DM and Deadmines is VC (van cleef). Don't @ me
---
Tips specifically said in the other tweet to "Mark your calendar" for the 24th of May.
---
That's what he meant.
---
Does rogue scale huge with gear? This is what ive heard. So does this mean that it gets easier and easier to oneshot people the longer wow classic goes? :D
---
Release is in summer time !
---
And in a few weeks each day I will come home, have dinner, kiss the wife and spend 3 hours leveling and trying to kill your damned hunter. See you in STV.
---
This sub is actually getting interesting again, we have moved beyond the memeing memes meta
---
&gt;Just gaining access to Naxx was a pain and cost a lot of gold to get attuned.
---
Why, i think almost all ppl that played from release should be revered at that stage, so its 30g + 2 crystals.
---
This takes me back to when there was an actual build in TBC called PornaDin, which was a Prot/Holy spec built for PvE survivability. I would just run into huge packs, cast my spells and enjoy my life.
---
12 weeks? Man, most of us will Not even have finish to pex 3 months after the launch... so having a epic mount...
---
Yes I deleted the post due to the extreme controversy of the video. I made the video private, and if May 14th rolls around and I am wrong I will make an apology. That thread I was serious, this thread I am joking around.
---
Interesting.
---
BWL, Onyxia and MC are significantly different from late AQ and Naxx.
---
This is getting better and better
---
Haha what is this dog trend. What did I miss
---
Hourly? I refresh every couple of minutes, along with wowhead, mmo-c and classic eu and us forums. It's killing me, man!
---
Spell Batching is extremely important though
---
Thanks for your input, guys! :)
---
What a great screenshot. Too keen!
---
I was playing arms warrior in pvp for most of classic and while you surely will be better with a dispeller, healer, windfury totem, ... it was a great time and the most fun in pvp i ever had.
---
Even when sometimes i got killed with no chance even getting near someone. The moments where i just deleted someone with a lucky streak will never leave my head. (That the reason i need to play arms warrior again, even if i like hunter or mage too)
---
I'm one of that guys that liked the imbalance between classes. I'm okay with being deleted by a frostmage, as long as i can delete other classes to :)
---
That's fun for me, not the "oh i got him to 20%, whups he's at 80% again".
---
I can't tell you how i hate retail pvp.
---
The ventrilo mic PTT sound is burned into my head. All those days playing CAL in CS
---
If the announcement is two weeks from now I am going to look like a big fool. Oh well, I will own up to my mistakes.
---
Dude all those things sound lame as fuck
---
That would be unreal
---
RELEASE THE HOUNDS!!!!!
---
ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED???
---
BIG TRUE
---
yes, now lick my boots
---
Who cares?
---
Lock epic mount isnt cheaper you still have to spend like 400g on materials from NPCs
---
Actual journalism is brutal in college. None of those gaming journalists have that education.
---
Still.. defending a world renowned high ranking officer of the Nazi wehrmacht. A guy aiding and fighting for one of the most cynical mass murderers the modern world has ever seen. That is for sure a class act. Yay!
---
can u pls not tell me how to play the game?
---
Just means I get to pick it up on sale later.
---
Long quest, not easy, sure... But it is cheaper! Obviously cant get a regular epic mount for 400g, its 1k.
---
&gt; Except I didn't start it. I was just paying them back (Which hopefully should have ended it.
---
That's pretty much gang-violence summed up
---
Ye boi
---
Currently playing a 2.5+ geared rogue with BIS MH dagger, I can crit ambushes for about 2-2.k on cloth and if timed with energy tick a 1.2k backstab right afterwords.
---
Can kill clothies that are undergeared with it or injured players, but against plate and mail your crits take a real nosedive.
---
Leaks are like free advertising these days.
---
- 911 how can i help you?
---
- I would like to report a crime. The classic wow subreddit is being held hostage by the office gifs. They say they wont stop until classic is announced. Please send help!!!
---
- *Hangs up*
---
- Hello?
---
Yo, i wanna dance, too!
---
Cool I'm going to main tank raids as a ret paladin and my alt will be an oomkin that also main tanks raids.
---
mfw I recognize a guild from my realm
---
It's not about them, mostly, it's about other players who are going to have their experiences ruined by (as person above mentioned) - fanboys.
---
You chose an opposing faction of the one streamers chose? Oh boy, prepare to get swarmed and camped by 50+ other people. This is just one of probably many examples.
---
Holy shit have GOT hit the shit fan lately. Can't even recommend the show to new viewers anymore. What a piece of shit it has become. At least is over soon.
---
Gonna roll Gnome Rogue because of the ladies attention ofc but still havent decided on either Combat or Seal fate dagger build.
---
I love the idea of more white hits dmg from Combat but also the spec looks very slow to build combo points with.
---
I did have a rogue in vanilla but it was only used for pvp, which spec was the most fun in raids?
---
(and no im not going Human Combat Swords, i love the daggzers)
---
Combat swords vs combat daggers vs seal fate? I have heard from different sources that each one is better. Anybody have any good info on which is better and when?
---
Where are the TURTTLLESSS?! WHERE ARE THEY!?
---
I love this quest. Fizzle can be a real challenge.
---
How about in a raid? because thats what I was referring too.
---
That's how I used the skull too. It's a real helpful item to have.
---
A crab
---
So much what you said implies that you did wrath naxx not vanilla naxx.. lol
---
What am I looking at?
---
He was referring to the 24th of May. Not the 24th tweet. He posted a tweet that people should  "keep their calendars clear on the 24th of may". Which he later removed, hence this tweet.
---
You will still go sword untill you have pred blade/core hound tooth and enough crit to be as valid spec as sword is. Untill you have the gear for it, sword will outperform dagger by alot. So just go sword, get gur gear, den dagger!
---
I've changed as much as 15 years will change you, but there's no other class for me than rogue. The burning passion inside my heart cannot be extinguished. Switching to Horde though :-)
---
I'd accept a beta key if I turn out to be right. And shame, if I completely missed the truth.
---
What kinda moonguard bullshit is this
---
No I mean the part about classic Launch. Was there really a Limit on 1.5 Million Players back then?
---
Gnasty Gnorc.
---
I'd accept a beta key if I turn out to be correct. And shame and humiliation if I'm wrong.
---
Ye but Horde never did Deadmines so DM always meant Dire Maul for Horde players.
---
Warriors and rogues will fall before you, druids and hunters will run away from you because the fight will never end, and unless you get some heavy frost/arcane/shadow resist gear, casters will make you bubble hearth
---
I can assure you, those who played 10 years ago, like myself, have never forgotten the game - I think there are too many memories for that. But I agree, many of them may have moved on from gaming in general and have not heard the news
---
Hahaha wish I had that kinda pull.
---
Nov '04 here let's go
---
I’ve been theory crafting a spec for duo levelling a dagger rogue with a (feral) Druid.
---
This is the spec (and order) I came up with:
---
* https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/ATwCyMwF8_MMdEA
---
* https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/574903542285074446/574914496737574913/unknown.png
---
I have worked on it for a while, the goal is to do lots of world pvp while levelling, but also have somewhat decent dps for levelling and dungeons.
---
As for lategame I’m not sure how to spec. I want to have a hybrid (dagger) spec to be decent in pvp and raids. The focus lies a bit more on raiding and farming.
---
* https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/AwzwwALIzAScPMMB
---
Any input would be welcome. But please keep in mind what my goals are for the spec. I know that swords is stronger in pve and I know the ideal sword spec, but I want to try something new for a change. :)
---
Thanks in advance.
---
The figures you give for Timbermaw rep sounds wrong. They sound more like WotLK or beyond numbers.
---
And then after only 1 week you see the first lvl 60 toons and wonder how the fuck is this even possible while you barely managed to reach 30 with, what you considered to be hardcore leveling.
---
I checked them against wowhead classic and classic DB and even in the world of warcraft guidebook from Brady games I'm almost certain the figures are correct.
---
Oh God, what have I done
---
*injecting code into retina*
---
What have i missed ? Why all these stupid shopped dogo's in all pictures ?
---
Can all the millenials stop doing stupid shit.... xD
---
My first character was an alliance rogue also, I remember my progression slowed about the time I finished with Arathi Highlands and didn't know what to do next. So I just hung around Southshore/Alterac Highlands for weeks being a nuisance.
---
There was an interesting "bug", where you could keep players sapped indefinitely before they introduced diminishing returns. So I'd be killing yetis or whatever, see a horde player approach, and just chain sap him. This would go on for.... 10-20 minutes. Until eventually they'd call for help and I'd get a few Horde trying to find me and chase me off.
---
Great times :)
---
Du også 😍
---
Active mitigation wasn't a thing until recently.
---
I can believe that - it took me the best part of an hour to find the download link and I already own it.
---
Doubt there's much to that post, we already know they're not planning on having a RP-PVP server, and I think it was also confirmed that none of the Nost devs were working on the project. No signs of updated spell effects either.
---
8.2 is already a decent way through its development, if Classic is to come out before that then the Beta will be incredibly short, which I'd hope it isn't, I'd rather make sure we get as polished a product as possible.
---
Completely agree.
---
Maybe I worded it wrong. I meant it in the context of using a skill in preparation of a boss ability.
---
What part of planning an assassination attempt on Hitler did you not understand?
---
Dumb npc
---
Not everyone quested in EPL/WPL, especially Horde. So getting to revered with AD wasnt a cake walk for every player. Also , 2 nexus crystals had to come from DE'd epic gear. Again, not cheap.  My point was that very little vanilla players actually set foot into Naxx, let alone were downing bosses on a regular interval.
---
I think it's wrong to assume young players crave handholding gameplay and QoL in tge first place. Look at the Speedrun community for example, you see lots of young folks playing 20 years old games.
---
&gt;The older players who played the original classic
---
Who also probably have families, jobs and obligations now. I'm hoping that there will be people, but not as much as in this bottom image. :(
---
I've never seen either of the Office series. I've mostly just been confused about all of these gifs and dog memes.
---
When I first played WoW, I was a full time Ret Paladin!   
---
Constant /w Lol RET or "Hey we need a healer for XXXXXX can you heal?" Followed by abuse......BUT WHO CARED!? Not I?! I loved playing Ret, being an underdog where people had low expectations of you just made it easier to impress them.
---
5 Man dungeons, I was a real asset, balancing DPS, the odd clutch heal, assisting in agro management through blessings or simply off tanking a single mob / repentance spamming.   
---
Man I loved it. Since then I've been playing a ton of Overwatch and I found myself playing the tank heroes more. I really enjoyed that role of determining the pace, setting engagements and making clutch plays that swing fights, so when WoW classic comes out I'm going to go Warrior tank and experience the front side of bosses and mobs.  
---
I may even go horde this time and experience all the side quests and story lines that I missed out on, I may even roll a Shaman as a second character, probably either healer or Melee DPS. So yeah....much looking forward to it! Can't wait for my dose of World of Warcrack!
---
This is what my life has become!
---
I'm pretty sure the screenshot is from one of the 10k population servers, so it won't be nearly this crowded.
---

---
Take your (My medal) filthy gold medal.
---
Good job mate, really funny! 😁
---
That guy is probably a top poster in /r/classicwow talking about how much he played Vanilla and loved it.
---
Depending on classpopulation is cool, but at launch you will have a hard time figuring out ;-)
---
The way i see it on population Warrior-Mage-Rogue-Warlock-Priest-Hunter-shaman-paladin-druid
---
Says fhe journalism student. Prepare to get fucked
---
I was legit looking for a hidden dog in the picture... ☹️ NO MEDAL FOR YOU
---
You are retarded
---
I'm certain the figures are wrong. Check the comments section.
---
&gt;From **Thottbot**By ailshire [on 2006/10/04](https://classic.wowhead.com/faction=576/timbermaw-hold#comments:id=2848318) (Patch 1.12.1)  
---
&gt;Subject: *"Curious"*I consider myself a fair expert at Timbermaw rep now.  
---
&gt;As stated all of the mobs give a base 5 rep per kill up to 11999/12000 (honored). The chieftain in N Felwood, Overlord in S. Felwood give 15 rep per kill regardless. The Winterfall Chief gives 25 regardless.   
---
&gt;I used it as a grinding spot as well. DO NOT TURN IN YOUR FEATHERS UNTIL 11999/12000 CAP IS HIT. After I killed the final Felwood Chief (putting me at 14/21000 revered) I turned in my 550 feathers.   
---
&gt;Not only was it 5514/21000 revered reputation, but it was 550 exp per turnin at level 55. In other words, I tagged out about 55,000 experience on my next level.  
---
&gt;The other thing I'd recommend, go with a smaller group (3/4 guildies) who don't care about the rep. Set loot to FFA and take all of the beads/feathers. I got about 200 feathers last night in around 5 hours, which is pretty good considering we only brought three with us and the exp wasn't terrible.  
---
&gt;Also, Runecloth falls in the north, but if you're alone, I'd seriously recommend the south felwood camp, much lower level and easy to mow through alone. Still the same feather/overlord rep gains, and it's usually far less camped.   
---
&gt;Good luck with exhalted, it is most certainly a grind.
---
I tried at least, had to use terrible smartphone apps to create it. Thanks again!
---
The only thing affecting my choice more than anything is if I want to play Druid or not. Because that would lead me to playing a Night Elf and betraying my Horde roots.
---
Otherwise I'm gonna go Troll Shaman or Priest.
---
My main was a Hunter. Loved it. Raided from vanilla to Wrath, and kinda quit once Cata was released. 
---
I was a bit of an altaholic, and loved leveling. I had a level 60 Druid, Rogue, Warrior and priest too....but all of these I never played past dinging 60. Never instanced or even PVP'd with them. 
---
my other alt was a shammy, which I loved, and went Resto at 60. I raided with him when the guild needed additonal or were short of a healer. I did a lot of BG pvp with him too.  Before I quit, I was kinda playing him more than the hunter.
---
I'm torn on what to level 1st / Hunter or Shammy.  I think I'd like to play the shammy more, but worry about my lack of gold and shammy's werent the best farming classes out there. As a hunter, I'd normally spend 5 hrs on a monday night just grinding gold, either doing DM runs, or when the Darkmoon faire was there, killing yetis for rugged leather in Winterspring.  I could make easily 800-1000g in a 5-6hr period, with drops and DEing mats.  
---
I really fear on a Fresh server, not having sufficient gold to buy things, so may have to level my hunter 1st.
---
The screenshot is from the Nostalrius closing event to be exact.
---
Content blocked on YouTube for people in the US. Womp.
---
Which is a shame tbh, these are the most enjoyable moments of vanilla.
---
Except only a tiny minority of players will ever complete Classic. People think AQ and Naxx is easy because it's old content. They are in for a surprise.
---
As vanilla veteran I would not call someone starting in TBC a TBC baby and it's not even an "anccepted term". TBC was just a small incremental improvement on vanilla, while retaining all important factors what made vanilla vanilla. 
---
Wrath is not an incremental change from TBC, it's just completely different game and majority of its players didn't play in vanilla, hence the term wrath baby has real meaning.
---
I'd love to choose Horde this time around but I just can't do it. I have a huge nostalgia boner for Elwynn/Westfall/Redridge/Darkshore which cannot be quenched. Looking forward to tanking Deadmines for the first time as a Warrior instead of dpsing as a rogue though.
---
Please, kind sir, take that back 😭
---
Yeah, thistle tea and the ZG trinket mean you can basically global anyone not in plate. And then you’ll have to just stun the heartier guys. Rogues are veerrrrryyyy easy.
---

 [https://classicdb.ch/?item=19324](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19324)
---
I’m still disappointed they haven’t made any use of it in a real sense. 
---
Imagine a real arena where you’d have to go there to queue to fight, others could just spectate.
---
Very short answer: for raiding dps combat sword is the best spec.
---
No. Thats about how many were playing around the first major update
---
I barely quested there on the current char in private server, i got my reputation grinding stratholm for pre-bis (and orbs). You know, you have like 1.5 years to do that.
---
Not only is it click bait but these articles are just placeholders and are edited down the road.
---
Of vanilla private servers*. I agree they're epic (and equally laggy) as hell, but this is arguably the biggest thing where private servers just aren't authentic.
---
Yeah I feel you on that one. I think my choice will be down to who I go back with. I'm tempted by Undead warrior but I do love levelling up on the Alliance side.
---
Cool, thought I recognized some guild names!
---
I'm a little worried about gold also, I remember it took me until level 47 to be able to afford the basic mount. I'm probably going to make the same mistakes again tho, I love mining and engineering for pvp (mainly for the parachute so I could jump off the mill to the blacksmith in arathi basin haha).
---
Looking for something a little more concrete, would love to find the old EJ posts with math on it just to see what % difference we are talking about at different gear levels.
---
I think what turned me off then, as it does now, is the desolate nature of the horde zones. Alliance is much more "high fantasy", and appealing.
---
It's a regional thing. It's never used outside of NA.
---
Calls others millenials with negative association, uses ''xD''. What a wanker.
---
I played from ~2007 to 2010, before my dad forbid me because I played it too much. Adult now, hopefully with a pc by the time it comes out, going to enjoy it
---
It's probably accurate that most people who don't actively follow WoW probably are unaware, but if they use the internet at all they will become aware at some point.
---
I think the Classic announcement post actually made the front page here when it happened, and if they use Facebook or Twitter then they'll run across something about it once it starts getting widely mentioned, which will happen when open beta or release comes. If they use YouTube or Twitch at all then it will be impossible to miss as all of the big streamers will be piling in for the opening day frenzy. Also any gaming related news site is going to have something about it at launch, and some mainstream outlets like Forbes that tend to have regular gaming related features will at least mention it.
---
The main reason that people are not aware right now is that it's just not "trending" or coverage worthy because there is nothing to report. The last big scoops were the announcement and then the brief demo at Blizzcon. Actual release will be much more widely covered.
---
It's like in the Gladiator, but the tiger is a doge
---
boohoo
---
Played a mage back in vanilla all the way up to WOTLK. I do feel however I will play a mage again, I'd like to be the better version of my 15yr old self and enjoy Wow again.
---
I miss the random buffing, water vendoring and providing portals.
---
Actually gave class identity.
---
Looks like a pve server lol

You are brave posting this in EUTZ.
---
Seal Fate only really becomes a thing in late vanilla. You need really high crit chance to make it work well, but it's good when it does. 
---
Swords vs daggers combat are nearly equal but with a small advantage to swords, mostly because alliance has humans and horde has WF totem. 
---
It's close enough that the best spec will be whatever is the best weapon you have. In MC and AQ40, the top dagger is better than the top sword. In BWL the top sword is better and in Naxx they're equal. There's a few more nuances than that, but that's mostly it.
---
I think that is key to what most players miss, identity.
---
Thistle tea suffers from potion syndrome where you finish the game with a load of potions that you saved for an emergency.
---
Yeah I'd agree with that one, that and you can play humans! Back then that was a huge factor for me deciding because I like my avatar to represent me as much as possible but in this new world.   
---
This time round I'm more open to exploring other races, what is their motivation, their stories etc I'm ready to not be human I think :)
---
I agree with you 100%. Even though vanilla is like a rock paper siccor system I love that you can "outplay" your counters. I don't know how meny warlocks and enha shamans i farmed cuz i learnd how they played.
---
Want to know why those 2 quests down the bottom of that guide aren't linked correctly? Because those are the quests from Cataclysm. You're referencing a Cataclysm guide.

I hate those things so much. "You play this game because you like the combat mechanics and how every class feels different? Here now you get to play with completely different mechanics than those you like, and they are identical for every class!"
---
I don’t have more unfortunately. But I’ve experienced it myself and read many different sources that all come to the same conclusion. The biggest problem that keeps dagger down is the cost of backstab. That’s why in the vael fight second boss bwl) dagger outperforms sword.
---
It shouldn’t be too hard to find guides with calculations though.
---
Why did you even bother typing this out
---
Holy pallys are amazing defencive healers in bg's. With you by there side a tank should not die :)
---
This is a fair comment -- i did like a lot of the aspects of TBC. I guess I mostly don't like the aesthetic of it (too much sci-fi maybe -- I really liked the feel of the original game). And I think the talent trees at 60 are really tight. I don't know.
---
Let's be honest, yes launch will be huge, 4 months in I can see 25% quit, once things settle maybe 7/8 months into it, I think the population will be half, which will still be good.
---
For those that haven't played vanilla or p servers, alot of them will be in for a shock at how grindy it is to 60, and unless you can commit to raiding, there isn't a whole lot to do at 60, 3bg, and maybe 1.5 raids, which might be pigged. Which is neither good or bad..... Its just classic. Can't wait!!
---
I think he mostly means young players who only know the new and different WoW. It will be a little shock at first no doubt.
---
Seriously though, why is there a dog shopped in?
---
Nice job, it looks great!
---
In &lt;x&gt; weeks I might hopefully be dead :-)
---
It'd depend upon what buffs I had and if that weapon was going to be upgraded soon. IIRC Crusader was around 150g. I wouldn't toss that shit on a BiS pre-raid weapon.
---
I'm using the same mate, you get better with time. Again, good job! Gave me a good laugh😁
---
Was a rogue main all through Vanilla and TBC. Hardcore raider. Switched to priest at the end of Wrath but also didn't play much anymore. I've played most classes though. 
---
I'm probably going Warlock for Classic. It's the one class I've played the least except for monk.
---
That's actually quite cool I honestly appreciate you searching that through, I'll definitely search through more avenues next time before publishing thanks very much.
---
Sure if i find a sword while levelling its fine, but i was thinking barman shanker would be somewhat easy to come by at lvl 60 before starting mc?
---
Pretty smart strategy by Blizz
---
Can farm goretusk livers in westfall and sell them too
---
those thread killing me -.-
---
After watching a video of some dude ganking in STV I’ve decided to go rogue. I definitely have a preference towards PVE but also wouldn’t mind getting a little gank action in along the way to 60.
---
So here are my questions:
---
What are the primary differences between the talent trees?
---
What’s your preferred race? (I’m torn between troll and undead) 
---
Best professions? Debating between complete gatherer (skinning and mining) or lw or engineering with their associated gathering skill 
---
What are some good rotations for each talent tree?
---
Very cool should probably hit up wowhead classic and ask them to remove those from there section as it was misleading. Thanks for your help friend
---
Sharpening stone acts like a poison, or in this case, like Windfury. If you put a 2% crit sharpening stone on your main hand, you no longer get windfury. Crusader is an enchant, thats a different thing.
---
I still haven't gotten over that haha, I played a human rogue and will be going human warrior this time around. Mentally preparing myself for the ugly face choices.
---
YoU wIlL mIsS hAlF tHe GaMe On A pVe SeRvEr !!11
---
You will find plenty of swords leveling up, and you will most defenitly have 2 blue swords before u hit 60 if you plan right. Look at the last pages of this presentation and you will find weapon progression and where to find said items. Barman shanks is really bad, it was good but they nerfed it. And dagger wont be nearly enough dps to compare to sword especially when you just hit 60 and going to farm dungeons and early MC. https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rvvzg5JLgcGb7H8dveGb0FSQ60Q6sKP9dcLPoonRRhk/edit#slide=id.g448cb83946_0_75
---
Always dm, never see ppl use vc
---
It's very impressive feat, why would it not matter? If anything it should matter much more than retail vanilla world first as the competition is at significantly higher level and the work and preparation that goes into it much greater.
---
That sounds awesome
---
So is that a playstyle choice, or just a "it's new to me so I will give it a go" thing. I've been thinking of that also, mage is probably the furthest away from what I've played in any game so it'd be interesting to give it a go. Maybe as an alt.
---
TLDR: you know what? I was trying to be helpful and offer concrete advise and came to the conclusion that you should just pick what sounds/looks great to you, since all classes have pros and cons, so it really depends on what you wanna do and how you wanna play, but I hope my gibberish below helps a bit ☺️
---
There are classes that have an easier time leveling. Hunter is the best leveler but is not by any means an easy class - you have a pet to manage, have one less inventory bag (for quiver/ammo pouch), have a dead zone to manage (the point where a mob is too close to shoot but not close enough to melee), and overall have a lot of abilities to keep track of (auras, traps, different stings, melee’s, and pet abilities). 
---
Warrior has the hardest time leveling. Paladin is second hardest and rogue is third imo, BUT, rogues are great classes at endgame and great for beginners because they don’t have a lot of abilities to manage, have a lot of “oh shit” buttons to get out of sticky situations, and have stealth to help them skip things they don’t need and pick their fights. They are high skill cap, but in good hands, rogues are beasts especially in PvP. The reason rogues don’t level very fast is because even though they don’t have mana, they do have a lot of down time from eating. They have low mobility overall (sprint is a 5min cool down, so it doesn’t help you “travel” quickly), and are not good at soloing elite quests because they lack sustain.
---
Priests are great too - they are not a pain in the rear to level as long as you go shadow. They also suffer from the low mobility curse, but they are strong at everything else.
---
Druids are not bad either. Despite having many forms to choose from, you can only use specific spells in those forms and your action bar changes when you shift into other forms making their multiple abilities very manageable. They are actually second best levelers after hunters and are difficult to kill in PvP (in gold hands). But they are also not very promising in endgame.
---
Mage (just like druids) have a slow start, but once you level, get a few abilities, then they are very strong. They are a bit more technical and have lots of spells to manage while leveling, but they can teleport, create portals, and conjure food/drink, making them money savers and also money makers if you sell those services.
---
Warlocks are third best levelers and their pets are not so high maintenance like hunters. They are great for leveling having high sustain and ability to solo elites, but they also lack mobility. However, they get a free mount at 40, so that helps with the mobility issue. 
---
Shamans can’t speak for, but their totems make them pretty bloated with buttons. If you don’t mind that, it’s also nice that they get ghost wolf at 20 for more mobility.
---
Paladins are very durable but very slow to kill things - you basically mostly auto attack. There are some fun grinding builds, like going protection at 30ish and using reckbombs and reflection damage from blocks on melee attackers. Also free mount at 40.
---
That's what helmets are for!
---
You’d want to use them on cd (and when energy is as low as possible) during raids anyways. And in pvp when you want to blow someone up, who you couldn’t otherwise.
---
So anything you keep during levelling just means a bit less farming.
---
meh
---
No problem. To be honest, if you see big numbers for reputation, that usually a huge sign they're wrong for Vanilla/Classic. 2000 rep for a single repeatable quest was absolutely not a thing that ever occurred in Vanilla.
---
Leatherworking is not really that much worth it in classic.
---
Engineering is a must have if you want to pvp competitively.
---
Against PvP specc'd equally geared and skilled players Rogues lose duels to Warlocks, Mages, Hunters and Priests. Losing to 4 classes, winning against 4 classes and going even against 1 effectively making Rogue a mid-tier PvP class. Not nearly as overpowered as World of Roguecraft would lead you to believe.  
---
Add potions such as Limited Invulnerability Potion and Action Freedom Potion to the mix and Rogues look a lot worse, not better.
---
You mean DM
---
I think I will have a rogue or priest as my alt and level it with rested XP. 
---
I would really like to have a world pvp monster. How easy is it to gear up a rogue? Do I need raid gear or dungeon gear?
---
Ironic how he wields Sulfuras
---
Yeah absolutely true I think I had one to many tabs open and was feeling under the pump to get the video out, but I honestly appreciate the feedback I'll know now to make sure i fact check a lot closer now. Seriously thank you very much.
---
I was just about to type this. Just wanna throw in that the pace was largely contrived and based on what Blizzard thought players wanted at the time. If you played BC you realized how they quickly abandoned much of Classics pacing.
---
Peak theme park
---
Ah, I was unsure. I didn't do much raiding in vanilla.
---
I also thought sharpening stone added flat damage? Didn't know there was crit alternatives(actually that was added in BC.. heh)
---
I guess the argument is flat damage vs % damage, luck based.
---
Warrior’s are essentially beasts once 60 and geared (despite being hard to level). Because everyone knows this, lots of people will go warrior, so servers will be bloated with warriors. I’m not complaining though - finding a tank will be easier 😋
---
Also, to OP, if everyone will go warrior, then I second the mage choice, because mages are pretty hard counters to warriors. That doesn’t mean that you’ll win if you just sit there and mash the same button, but play the class right and warriors won’t be able to touch you.
---
My god this was SO good! Man like people say you really make this sub lighten up during the wait, these are so much fun! Thanks for the content, heading for YouTube to support your channel!
---
in world pvp rogues are not very gear dependent, you keep enemies in stun locks and pick your fights around your cooldowns.
---
Thanks a lot mate ❤️ I'm really glad you like them ☺️ More is on the way, working on the Raider 3 and a new "Series" with Creed.
---
Am I the onlyone who have been ruind by the dog meemes?  
---
Always have to check an image and look like its fucking where is waldo.
---
Id say those are going to be very rare compared to fights in BRM. Thats going to be a constant battle after raid resets.
---
Did hunter vanilla spriest tbc mage wotlk and mage on a pserver.
---
Going to heal this time.
---
As what I'm undecided as of yet.
---
Yo man! Subbed and watched liked everything to add up, one detail though, you should put them in a playlist in the right order like raider 1 then 2, etc... So people can follow the "journey" ! As it is right now if you watch all it's not in the original order :)
---
I do enjoy that “streaming” has become a 12 hour a day, 7 days a week gig with the hope of getting a 10 second clip to the front of r/livestreamfails.

There will be people to talk to in Classic, you don't have that in BFA.

---
rofl what a fantastic sentence
---
Talent tree differences:
---
* combat: pve 
---
* sub: pvp
---
* assa: a bit of both, often used as second tree with combat. But can be really strong in later content as main spec
---
Best races:
---
* alliance: human for pve (sword specialisation) and dwarf for pvp (stoneform), gnome is also decent for pvp (escape artist)
---
* horde: orc is the best race, both for pvp and pve
---
As for professions, there is no clear winner:
---
* engineering is afaik the best profession in vanilla for most classes
---
* alchemy is good for rogues because you’d want herbalism anyways to farm swift thistle and blondwheat for your rogue skills anyways
---
* leather working is good to craft pre raid bis
---
* otherwise you could also go for two gathering professions to make money
---
Rotations for pve:
---
* combat swords: keep slice and dice up at all times, spam sinister strike and finish with eviscerate.
---
* combat dagger: same, but backstab instead of sinister strike
---
* as for other potential specs: use your cool downs as effectively as possible, while keeping mainly to the same rotations depending on your mh weapon
---
I kinda liked the ones in TBC in Hellfire where you bomb some stuff but that was probably because it was new at the time.
---
VC is pretty exclusively a term used on NA servers. Most of EU hates it!
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=18262 This is the crit stone. It was not added in BC, it was in vanilla. Like Im not just spewing nonsense here..
---
Haha fucker, I'll be there. Trying to think back on what the default OCE PVP server was, Blackhand and then later Frostmourne? Stretching my memory.
---
Beginner class is typically hunter but play whatever appeals to you, it's not like any class is particularly hard to play.
---
For raiding, you need to do some quests and grab some decent gear from dungeons but what you really need is a group of people to raid with. Make connections while questing and doing dungeons to have a better chance of getting invited to a raid group.
---
Gameplay differences between Horde and Alliance are real but overall minor but I'll never betray Lady Sylvanas.

"The quillboar are at it again.  They've been interrupting vital routes for supplies for the Crossroads, I need you to eliminate them!  Travel east to Bork Mountain and kill Water Seekers, Thornweavers, and Hunters, and report back to me when you're finished."
---
I used to play warrior, but I think I'm ready for something new. Shadow priest seems fun, but not sure I want to battle mana all the time in PvP, so I might end up going rogue. Plus I have a love for melee weapons, would feel much like my old warrior in that regard.
---
I thought i was the only one. Who at Blizzard got the idea for these quests. And why did they even bother to create a healing spell for them. They do review quests after theyre created and implemented into the game... Right?? And theyre like “Wow, this is awesome”
---
Just wanted to spark some conversation, but thanks for stopping by! 👋
---
Something I just remembered, is Thistle Tea going to be a thing in classic? I can't remember when it was removed.

My friend was trying to get his Nelf to Sw and got to wetlands and swam the coast all the way to Sw took him an hour and a bit I think

Funny story: I was in a bar in Germany with a work colleague who happened to play during TBC, and this was the only meme I showed him that he could understand without speaking English :D
---
Bored of DPS and I always wanted to heal really. This is my chance! I deliberately rolled mage on pserver recently as classic wow had turned my head but I wanted healing to be fresh.
---
Lol so true
---
I can think of 2 guilds with capable players for a week 1 MC clear. So for me, the week 1 question of will they/won't they - starts and stops with them.
---
Boy you have to go through a lot on that website just for a theme 😢
---
So I've been considering rolling a rogue because they are very hard to master, even though they are pretty common and popular. How is the skill cap on warlock compared to rogue, and can locks match them in world PVP?
---
Rogues only lose to SL locks. That's like 25% of a class in the low end of the popularity scale. Other warlock specs get dunked on by rogues due to having zero mobility and no way out of stunlocks. Warlocks can't trinket stun or blind so they're completely fucked against rogues except for SL which can facetank long enough to overcome the CC.
---
Looking for a horde EU(pvp) guild that fits my raiding times.
---
I can always monday, tuesday, wednesday, sunday
---
fridays often result in other plans, same for saturday.
---
thursday i'm never free.
---
Alliance: for the king
---
Horde: for the warchief
---
Me, an enlightened centrist:
---
So which one is released in July? Still don’t think Classic is coming July like everyone is convinced it is. Keep the “I don’t agree” votes coming though.
---
If your goal is to be a healer in PvP then go priest, 100%. Resto druids in pvp are not even healers, they are more utility machines that just heal themselves. So if you want to be a healer for your team priest 100%
---
More like BFA  fans with inferiority complex

Somehow I'd forgotten all about WoW Insider. I recall starting every morning by reading through their articles.
---
I ain't much for pvp, but this, this I'm even up for participating in the arena
---
I'll look into this, thx. Didn't know shanker was nerfed :(
---
Healing has always intrigued me, I've never been interested in doing it myself but have always been interested in those who do. What draws you to it? 
---
I like being on the front line, controlling where the battle is taking place, which enemies we are fighting, marking targets, taunting. Being super active. 
---
Healing in comparison seems like more of a spreadsheet management kind of thing haha. Topping off, managing dots, anticipating damage. It's very numbers heavy and anticipatory. Actually now that I've typed that out, it seems similar to tanking in a few ways.
---
Theese are amazing, keep em comming guys!
---
Thanks a lot ! :D
---
Yeah, it was. I'm not saying it wasn't but it's still sad imho.
---
Would be a perfect way how to wait for Classic
---
Yeah, I know. Every other Alliance race is poopy, but I like Night Elves and I like Druids and Tauren aren't cool or pretty.
---
gnomer can take days to finish, there is so much to do inside!!!
---
Yes cause blizz knew that far ahead that they won’t have any issues by July and will release it that exact day.
---
There is no national socialist Wehrmacht, the Wehrmacht was and is a separate entity. It would be like calling the US amry republican right now, and Democrat army under Obama.

Rommel, like they mentioned, had to take his own life after being involved in a plot to assassinate Hitler. So tell me, what would he have to do to not be an evil "nazi" in your eyes?

Oh well, I'm fairly certain you only think "nazis" are bad and wouldn't get triggered by KhieuSamphan1972 or GengrikhYagoda1932 - both of which actually were terrible people.
---
I can't be the only one who searched for a dog.
---
Asmongold said he's playing on a PVE server for classic. I don't blame him.
---
TipsOut you gotta stop with the fake leaks, the fake sources who send you screenshots and all that shit dude. It does you more wrong than anything else. Just act right.
---
Both have a high skill cap. Rogue is more effective in world pvp because you can pick your fights. But warlock is far better in group pvp/BGs. Problem with warlocks is that they’re highly gear dependent while rogues are not gear dependent at all. Early on rogues counter warlocks hard but after a few raid tiers the warlock pulls ahead.
---
I think your title has a typo, it should be the other way round :P
---
Hard disagree about not having anything to do at 60 other than raiding.
---
Honesty at this point who the fuck knows, I change my mind nearly every week, because I am try to min max but you can't be the best at everything in vanilla so I have to pick something that is at least servicable in most areas while being good/fun in pvp.
---
Ah, the good ole "tu quoque" argument.  \*golfclap\*.  
---
You must not take criticism at all then eh?  What happens when you get constructive feedback from your boss/coworkers on something? Do you just go into a corner, cover your ears going "LA LA LA LA" intertwined with "STOP ATTACKING ME I'M IN MY SAFESPACE!" ?
---
Warlocks being underplayed is irrelevant to their performance and Warlocks, or any other class for that matter, losing in PvP if they don't use a proper PvP spec is a given.
---
Rogues do not lose to Warlocks. And rogue vs Mage &amp; Spriest is a pretty even fight. Your point is entirely invalid.
---
The chad dwarf female vs the virgin night elf male
---
I still remember specific names of people and what they did. Like you always knew there was an enchanter in the bank in orgrimmar who was always down to enchant your gear. Different people always had specific locations they always sat in during their downtime which created a community. 
---
I always had specific people I'd always inspect to see their gear progress and that one guy on the opposite faction who you had good battles with in WSG.
---
Also having a friends list, not just battle.net contacts. 
---
Hasn't been the same since.
---
Looking forward to it
---
Yo thanks dude, damn! Pleasure is all mine for sure :)
---
Should have been a goldshire terrier.
---
It's like people forget there are active BGs on PVE servers. Only difference is that there is no wpvp. And lets face it, wpvp is just griefing 8/10 times. Either some a-hole dispelling your buffs when ur heading to a raid, some lvl 60 camping you when ur lvl 50 or just someone that makes your farming take x10 longer time. With all that said PVP servers can be really fun too, but it's more time consuming to play on one than it is to play on a PVE server. If I get this new job I applied for next month i'll have to go PVE. If I don't I'll just play PVP
---
Legolassie
---
Indeed plenty to do at 60.
---
Oh I didn't realize that. I guess classic won't be the first then.
---
Lmaooo, this meme "war" is awesome, love you guys !
---
starting to get quite annoying when half the frontpage is filled with office and other gifs.
---
Holy Pally. Looking forward to it.
---
are u fucking serious???
---
You know yourself youre bsing so thats fine either way
---
It started back as early as TBC didn’t it? Within the first 20-30 questa in Hellfire you get taxi’d on a wyvern to bomb the shelves, but you actually had to use the bomb item in your bags they gave you. Then they streamlined it in Wrath by introducing vehicles and have basically  been iterating on the quest design with new features stitched together.
---
2 episodes left in the series
---
I’ll be in AV
---
I think that is the number 1 thing I am looking forward to. Actual server communities. It affected every single aspect of the game, from questing, leveling, pvp, economy, shittalking in main cities, to dungeons and raiding. We lost all of that. And looking back on it, I think that is what kept me around longer than most games, and why I left midway through WOTLK.
---
Finally someone who understands the glory of having multiple Warrior races.
---
So many horde 😮
---
They might do fresh servers but I I highly doubt they would wipe any server.
---
This never happend
---
Terrible meme and not even classic loot window..downvoted to hell
---
Damn it man! Don’t show me this.
---
I just picked Paladin and now you’re making me want to play my rogue like I used to!
---
Tipsout doesn’t know anything.
---
The face when?

Does anyone else?

*Does anyone else?!*

[Blizzard 'MVP'](https://img.memecdn.com/up-syndrome_o_762895.jpg)
---
Shaman will be really popular tho. On horde side it is among the top 3 most popular classes
---
I think the fact that TBC was releasing a few months after naxx is why so not many people did naxx. I guarantee you it will not be like that on classic servers. Also with the game having no mystery anymore and classic being studied so much I think it will be a lot easier than you think. But to be fair I believe it will be very hard to "beat" the game and it would take a long time.
---
They had us in the first half, not gonna lie.
---
Wont there be sharding?
---
Tips also said in kargoz's stream chat today that people might be multitasking during the last game of thrones episode. He's just getting people riled up lol
---
I'm witnessing greatness on /r/classicwow. Just glad I'm here for this.
---
Maybe not on *your* server, or when you were playing.
---
I'm not sure if I agree with this. I actually think that people will trickle into Classic as the game gets more attention. I was a die hard WoW fan and didn't know about Classic until I accidently stumbled on a video. Most of my friends who played WoW didn't even know about this.
---
So I think that we'll have an initial rush, but also a slow trickle afterwards. Who knows, maybe MORE people will play 3 months after release than on the release date itself. It is completely within the realm of possibilities.
---
r/classicwow is about to get its own gif wars...
---
If he was really horde I don’t think you’d get that hand back bother!
---
I really want to play a Night Elf Druid, I love the Alliance Cities, it would be a new experience having never played Alliance before. But literally every other race just looks poopy compared to the Horde counterparts. Even humans look and move weird =\
---
I feel like I'm betraying something by even considering doing this ):
---

Nope. Because I suck at pvp*

Through in some betting and a prize reward for the champion too and the experience is complete. I would go there to bet on my favourite pvper.

There it began and i also thought it was cool. But then something like that maybe happened.
---
"I'm working so long to create a quest. I think it's a great quest line, but how do i end it? Players speak too long with this quest giver. Hmm ... i have an mad idea! Lets fly to another quest giver skipping long distances ... with a mount! ... a gryphon, no .. a DRAGON! 
---
But it would be boring for the common under entertained player. Lets use this old vehicle UI from thousandwinter with some cool looking skills/effects and stuff to waste time! Thats it! Content developed sucessfully for today. I should save this routine for next expansions. Now give me a beer!"
---
- So the player got harassed over and over again with flyby quest.
---
I was about to write this exact comment.
---
Hahaha hooolyyyy... Are you _actually_ not trolling right now? You got super upset when I dared critique a flaw in Blizzard, and now you're the one trying to tell me _I_ can't take feedback? Please stop embarrasing yourself, for everyone's sake. You're going to look back on this and cringe so hard one day. I'm doing you a favor here, trust me.

Started as a nightelf hunter on a friends account during vanilla. Realized I like the game, bought it and have then "mained" a ret paladin. Twinked several classes but never reached 60 with someone else.
---
During TBC I initially kept my paladin but resorted to healing. Then I switched, first to a heal druid, then to a rogue.
---
Wotlk was when I started playing mage and I have mained that mage ever since. Only now in BfA I decided to reroll - first trying to play survival hunter but finally kept playing a mistweaver monk,
---
I'm currently torn between rogue, hunter, mage and warlock for classic. It's probably going to be the rogue, but we'll see.
---
This screenshot is fucking magical. This is how I remember classic.
---
Yes but he actually was talking about a tweet about an Event Happening on the 24th which he had to take down - because it might not happen on the 24th...
---
There is not 24 tweets and no 24hrs :/ Just something on the 24th? hype
---
Yeah! In lineage 2 you could queue into arena and everyone on the server could spectate. After a month, if you were a rogue for example, your status change to " hero " with special ability. Very fun and entertaining

Soul Link Warlock is pretty much unbeatable for Rogues in a duel.
---
In parts yes.. I believe the Nazis were bad. But not without a reason. I can't speak from personal experience (obviously), but I know horror when I see it in the eyes of another person.
---
My grandparents where young when the Nazis invaded and bombed every single thing. The only building left was the church.
---
They had to flee in my great grandfather's fishing boat and seek refuge further south to keep safe from the SS officers capturing "undesirables" and shipping them to concentration camps.
---
My great grand uncle was shot, execution style, on the docks for "hording" unregistered food to feed orphans, which was not approved by the SS.
---
And till this day my grandmother can't even hear the German language without having heavy/severe PTSD and start crying.
---
So in my opinion, Rommel could have refused to support Hitler from the get go, gotten killed for it and not taken part in genocide alongside so many "great" men of stature back then (Hitler, Stalin, Mussolini etc).
---
But then again. This is just my opinion. Still.. defending a guy taking part in something like that, even though he "sacrificed" himself at the end, sounds like some Neo Nazi bs to me.
---
I'm not trying to be some "righteous" tool here. I just don't think those guys are worth portraying as avatars online. It doesn't matter if they were associated with Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Bin Laden, Mossad or Trump. Bad people are bad people and historical tragedies like WW2 should be remembered because of the people who made the ultimate sacrifice, and not celebrated because of the people who caused the misery.

Weird survey to show on the classic sub. The submissions from here will skew the results
---
I've heard them say officially that they were really happy with how that quest turned out, so they decided to run with it.
---
Wtf is there to do in retail thats even fun? Im going to have a blast hunting the enemy faction in world pvp. That alone can keep me occupied for a long time.
---
I hope and expect the original assets will be restored.
---
I miss the old hunter gunshots.
---
Happy cake day, mah dude. Have an upvote.
---
Oh, did you have some OC to post?
---
I think its a pretty safe bet but I expect huge numbers at launch and rapid decline within the first week. It'll settle out to the people who actually want to play classic and it'll spike every new phase (which will likely coincide with lulls in retail). I'm looking forward to it, but it's so incredibly different from WoW today that I just feel a lot of the active player base of retail really wont enjoy it. Since the cata revamp, its literally a completely different game. A lot of the things people have taken for granted for the last decade not being there will be a rude wake up call and likely deter them from pursuing.
---
Goblin sapper charge?
---
Did it on a mage on a Pserver 3 weeks ago. Holy hell that instance is long, like 1,5 hours at least, all went fine till we got to the boat, the aggroing on different levels of the ship is horrible, the XP is horrible and it takes for ever. Also i noted i have 0 tolerance for fuck up now a day, its gonna be a hard time for me!
---
If this turns out to be true and he has broken NDA he's in deep shit. All posts about it have been deleted/censored so it's pretty clear Blizzard are aware. That was probably the last he'd ever hear from Blizzard.

In my experience on private servers, this has become warriors.

Getting just one character to level 60 before an expansion hits is my qualifier for winning.
---
If you’re between age 23 - 38 you’re  in fact a millennial.  ... xD
---
In classic proffessions are relevant and it has actual meaning to gather patterns and recipies :) I used to be very popular because I could make big bags ;)
---
The only one embarrassing themselves is you.  Please for the love of god stop using the word "cringe".  First off it dates you, secondly like the aforementioned comments regarding "shill, fanboy, etc"; calling anyone "cringe" is an immediate red flag to the conversation because it indicates a lack of intellgience and is effectively another form of *ad hominem*.
---
FWIW, you should take your own advice: 
---
&gt; It's okay to be wrong sometimes 
---
However at this point it's apparent that you're nothing more than a child with a superiority complex and an unwillingness to let go of something, and honestly I don't have any more patience for you.  /blocked.
---
Soooo... Basically just the arena system as introduced in TBC but with spectate enabled?
---
Not against it at all, I loved arena in TBC, but it does sound like a more "open-world" version of the arena system. That would be pretty cool, though - since it does feel a bit "isolated" to just keep queueing for instanced arena.
---
So mainly dps focused? Rogue is great for pvp, but it's rough leveling up, especially if solo. Hunter is great for levelling, very little danger of dying. Mage/Warlock is a little rough, lots of downtime, less for warlock due to pet.
---
I think i'll watch The Office cause of these masterpieces.
---
Also instantly subbed you on Youtube!

In the end we are all monsters.

Especially the Horde.

But especially the gnomes.

Was going to post yesterday but mods were removing them, but looks like this post has stuck. This was the hint:

How many will we reach before launch? :)  
---
P.S. Thanks for doing what I could not Roddeh!
---
It's literally going to be like this. Constant ganking and fighting over mobs.
---
Remember when "content creator" implied someone who made something like addons or resource/database sites, rather than someone who just recorded themselves talking annoyingly while playing the same game as everyone else?
---
Pepperidge Farm remembers.
---
Yes they saw the opportunity to spare development costs. You now could end, start or link quest without thinking about writing better stories. They reuse the vehicle mechanics, effects, spells, sounds and even UI, so they don't have to programm something new. Wouldn't be bad when it's used as a special but this stuff is CLEARLY over used and always feels like a contend filler/strecher when dev time ran out to fill up the quest counter for an expansion.
---
Last time I leveled a caster on a fresh PS there was people in Brill selling wands. Some people who really want gold will be rushing it and selling them when classic releases probably.

He is more likely to be wielding  \[Insert 2Hander Here\] with "Sulfuras, the Extinguished Hand"  from Ragnaros in Firelands transmogged on top.

---
Yep that looks like the one, thanks dude
---
Haha nice
---
Here's the thing: they're not wrong. A lot of private servers have demographic data and it shows that a vast majority of people quit early on. And ya know what? That's fine. Other people dont have to enjoy things I enjoy.
---
There is a very, very real subject thats being scratched on but not addressed that I think the community tends to overlook, and that is server size. And not in the way a lot of people are talking about.
---
MMOs that split their community will often not end up 50/50. Some people will play the games versions concurrently, some will play one version for a while than swap to another, and others will just play a single version of the game. My concern with Vanilla is that with the amount of servers available at launch, we could have a scenario where servers are spread out too thinly if it launches with too many servers. The same is true in reverse.
---
The really sticky part about that is well is that they'll have to monitor and adjust that in real time, and it's not something their tech is going to be great for. We'll see population spikes during launch, as well as when phases are released. But we could very well see population spikes or declines depending on the release schedule of retail (or lack there-of). A relatively simple fix to that is things like cross realm, looking for group (the tab, not the dungeon finder), sharding, realm consolidation and merging, but these are modern features the community is actively fighting against. And to be honest, in most cases, I can see why people don't want those things in Vanilla, but Blizzard really has to do this right. People don't want only 4 realms for Vanilla that are all High population, but they also don't want 100 realms, 75% of which are empty.
---
There are several large logistical problems with running the two games concurrently that WoW in general is not well equipped to deal with.
---
/Signed :)
---
Back in 2005, I literally ran into a friend I hadn't seen since high school, like 6 years, at the grocery store.  Turned out he lived like 6 houses down from me now.  We both played world of warcraft even.  Then he found out I played horde and he played alliance.. he never called.
---
If you have any doubts switching factions then don't, you'll only end up regretting it down the line and you will have sunk a couple hundred hours into a character you might regret rolling.
---
&gt;oh no I can't come up with any arguments other than 'you're a hater' and I get so immensely triggered by internet conversations that I can't keep civil, so imma block you now
---
Yeah you sure showed everyone who the mature one is! Definitely an adult.
---
It's either meme posts or posts asking about why there are only meme posts.
---
They are unreliable at best. It's such a crappy solution to purposefully add lag to your game.
---
I think a lot of people will start, then realize that life has changed in 10 years, and it's hard to find the time needed to dedicate to vanilla. I'm excited to jump back in, though it'll take me a long time to get to 60, I'm sure.
---
I feel like I'm in HQG territory right now..
---
I didnt say what's fun, I said things to do. And fun is relative, what you don't find fun, others do and vice versa.
---
You might be a millennial... Some millennials are turning 40 soon.
---
As if everyone didn’t click at some point back then
---
You forget the 10x daily “Release date will be announced ANY DAY now” for the last month
---
How'd you know he had a russian accent
---
That... that just sounds like Horde propaganda to keep me from being a pretty Night Elf Druid ):
---
But that is my concern. That I'll be level 60 with Tier 1 gear and feel like poop every time I have to kill a Tauren/Troll/Undead/Orc
---
On private servers there are because of increased population and dynamic respawns
---
This is a good point. he really has very little self restraint if he did sign an NDA and broke it for attention. I hope that’s not the case and this announcement isn’t barred in the NDA.
---
Yeah lots of high level players were always lurking in RR due to how close it is to burning steppes
---
It's VC u fuck

What posts do you want? WhAt WiLl hApPeN aFtEr nAxX iS rELeaSed?

It's always sad when a friendship abruptly, but unavoidably ends.

That must be fun

I just want to say thank you for this project!
---
As a druid I can confirm this is a good post.
---
Burn any good trees lately?
---
They were really cool when they first came out in TBC, but got really lame really fast
---
It would be really cool if a chest spawned there every so often, that people could fight over - oh wait...
---
&gt;I’m still disappointed they haven’t made any use of it in a real sense.
---
 It would be really cool if a chest spawned there every so often, that people could fight over - oh wait...
---
Signed up, although the likelyhood of anyone remembering me is very slim - as I mostly just did dungeons on my rogue and probably didnt even belong to a guild :D Good luck to you others though!
---
What trees? Thrall's Horde would never waste such valuable resources by burning them, I don't know what you mean at all.
---
I had a friend beg me to make an alliance toon so I did since he’s my rbg lead. I leveled and geared her, and literally can’t stand anything about playing
---
Alliance other than the void elf mounts look cool as fck in shadow form.
---
The culture is just so different on the alliance side and I legit cannot stand losing bgs so goddam often
---
They're not hating, they're referring to the lock spell "immolate" that the character in the drawing is casting.
---
Not to be confused with "Rouge" - a red facial makeup.
---
Oh thanks, I'm not into these kind of series
---
I don’t think that they realised that it was the ever increasing accessibility levels that killed the game off until it was too late and now they’re too far down the rabbit hole to go back. Any major changes to make the game more exclusive to higher end players and people who put a lot of time in would likely be met with tough resistance from the current entitled era of retail players.
---
thats an overall reddit's trend. i see it happen on many subreddits.
---
Reading text takes more effort, than pictures. so its more accessible content. and more entertaining aswell.
---
for instance, if you've made a meme picture about classic reddit being filled with memes instead of discussions, you'd get like 10x more upvotes and the audience reach, than these oldschoold text post you made.
---
so ya. get on board with how ppl communicate in the modern age, its here to stay.
---
This new dog edit trend has got to be a new low for this sub's meme standard.
---
I agree, I would always swing by this arena and the diremaul one and there was never anything like in this picture.
---
If you play beta do your characters transfer over?
---
I dislike them when they're overused.
---
There's some that are great when they're appropriate for storytelling or epic moments, such as the plane bomber shooting run at the start of the Alliance's MoP quests. That felt sandbox like.
---
Other than that, they are very oversaturated now. There's at least 1 to 5 of these in each zone.
---
Reduced? This is top tier shit posting. This is what reddit is.
---
Yeah that's a valid point. Personally I don't feel that the trade off is worth losing 6% dmg. If your having problem kiting though.
---
Yeah sorry lad, I'll get another alternative aswell.
---
Incoming 10:03 minute video for something which could be said in one sentence.
---
Your going to be loved by flagrunners
---
Why do you hope I don't end up with said streamer?
---
To be honest i dont know, i just imagine there has to be better things than a 29th gif from The Office or a "I cant wait to get back here" image with a copy pasted dog face.
---
And in fact i dont really care, im more interested in knowing what happened. Did some Classicwowmemes subreddit decide to migrate here? Like i can see a distinct difference in content now and 2 weeks ago so there must have been some kind of catalyst.
---
Im 33 now. Lovely wife and daughter. House, mortgage, car, good job. So much has changed in my life!
---
But 100% im gonna remake my undead mage you can bet your ass! Cant wait 🤓
---
I think you’re being a little hyperbolic about how frequently or for what purpose they use it. You do have a point that it feels a bit lazy, especially with the same UI design (the main UI is roughly the same as when it launched though too) but I don’t think the quests are ever just tacked on as content filler. Like the plane missions in Uldum with Harrison Jones. Those fit cohesively with the narrative they’re trying to show as you follow Jones throughout Uldum and recreate the films he is named after. You could even argue that it wasn’t creative because they were inspired by a film but that doesn’t mean the quests are just there “to fill up the quest counter.” 
---
That beach turtle world quest can suck a fat dick though and 100% exist to fill the Tortollan quest availability on any given day. World Quest design is a different kettle of fish IMO,
---
god dammit
---
fuck me :(
---
Well, i would think that almost everyone consider discussion-content to be more "effort" than memes - even high effort memes. And thus i used the word "reduced", but i admit it may have been a bad word to use.
---
this is the loading screen for deadmines, not dm
---
Cost is capped at 50g, which is a lot for classic. You won’t be wanting to swap a lot. (This is why I had multiple of each class during classic)
---
Druid is the biggest hybrid class of classic, and we pay the highest hybrid tax as well. We don’t do anything amazingly. But we can do it all. 
---
You can go into resto or fetal as many points as you like as still partially do the other (in some cases even without points into the tree) but it’s pointless in a raid environment. But you’re not going to really be amazing in raids anyway (outside of innervate ect).  Viable for both dungeons and PvP.
---
Druids can also tank, intact better than anything else in some people’s opinions at the very start of classic. But as soon as you hit raids, warriors are the choice to go. 
---
Feral is a worse rogue in raids, so they aren’t loved. They aren’t trash, just no point in bringing one really.
---
Your forced (like most classes) into one class for raiding, and that’s Resto. And you’re still going to be lacking in heals compared to other healers, but people want a mark of the wild buff and some other utility.
---
Sadly (and being my favorite class) Druids were the worst class in classic for PvE (they are good in PvP, we’re slippery as hell!) and for leveling. 
---
But these were the days only true Druids played a Druid. Not today where they’re one of the most popular classes.
---
I miss the old Thunder Clap noise :)
---
There is no argument here, the flat damage is better for fast weapons (like daggers), while the crit is better for slower weapons. Both of them are bad if you have a shaman in the raid group. It is sad to see /u/Jayybiirrd who is correct, get beaten down by people who do not know the basics.
---
I wish there was a wireless version of the G600 :(
---
No, i did Not click the Button bound to 2.... It is beyond me why someone would click instead of pressing 2.
---
I really enjoyed that quest in hellfire peninsula the first time I did it. It felt very dull to replay it on alts, even after having done it only once
---
Idk the quests to me are fine to me. They’re fun in large pvp battlegrounds too. Just don’t like them in raids.
---
My guild did this yesterday in BFA and we're on an RP (formerly RP-PvP) server that doesn't shard with other realms except through group finder. This is one of the main reasons I like RP servers, but I'm dreading having to choose between RP and PvP in Classic if Blizzard continues being obtuse about providing an RP-PvP server option.
---
You outnumbered here bro, came to the wrong neighborhood
---
No no. We know that horde players do not wash their hands
---
This your first time on reddit in general?
---
Ty!
---
I remember sneaking in as a rogue for that chest and then got my stupid as ganked....
---
To be honest i rather see classic following in the footsteps of OSRS. Eventualy adding new original content that would be in the spirit of vanilla.
---
I wonder if any realm had player-run betting for matches. If Devilsaur leather created player run mafias, I assume there would be gambling mafias too. :D
---
In all honesty, if this was a real race... I'd play it.
---
Yorkshire terror*
---
I've mained a lot of things throughout the years, but now I'll be going back to my favorite (priest) - looking forward to playing the class again, healing people and slowly gathering my tier 1 set (yes, it'll take time - yes, its not the best in slot - but damn is it gorgeous) and hopefully finally getting that benediction I missed out on.
---
I started as a rogue in vanilla, had a ton of fun just leveling and doing dungeons - even managed to squeeze in a couple of raids before TBC (ZG &amp; AQ20)
---
For TBC I ended up playing priest (shadow) and played that all the way until WotLK pre-patch, where I leveled a paladin.
---
When WotLK hit, I decided to try out tanking, which I did on my paladin until the ICC raid, at which point I went back to my priest - this time as holy/disc though. (Did some altraids on a resto druid &amp; dps warrior aswell)
---
For Cata, I skipped the first 6 months or so, but then came back as a hunter for the remainder of the expansion - God I loved the T13 Setbonuses for hunter.
---
Same 6 month break repeated for MoP, but this time around I returned to my true love, Priest, once again - starting out as holy, but switching to disc out of necessity (ended up loving the spec anyway, so its ok)
---
Then the fire nation attacked and WoD was the new kid on the block, mained my priest all the way through (even leveled some alt priests, 3 in total) and ended up raiding on all of them in different guilds.
---
In Legion I continued on priest, but stopped playing before Mythic was released for the first raidtier, then came back as a Warlock near the end of expansion.
---
As for BFA, while it didn't last long for me (quit during the first raidtier) I mained a prot paladin again.
---
So yeah, my tastes &amp; playstyle have, not so much changed - as varied, over the years. Going back to playing one of my original classes will be fun again I'm sure. Might even make a rogue alt at some point for the pure nostalgy.
---
The culture is different? Can you elaborate your experience at all?
---
I just never considered it would be different
---
Of course. It was glorious back then and I can’t wait to get back in. I meant in the sense that they should’ve continued it over expansions.
---
Yes there's a few more things, I was just stating, compared to retail a lot less
---
Amen to that, I'm 37 now. Luckily I work from home so I'll be able to expend a little more time to grind, maybe even more than when I was 20 :). I wonder what the percentage of players in their 30s+ who will be coming back.
---
Funny how the Alliance is lead by a kid in both Vanilla and BfA OMEGALUL.
---
Twinks are always troll assholes lol
---
You really shoehorned that in there
---
This is actually my first house I have ever bought and I always wanted a game room. I finished my basement and built my dream setup. I play mostly PlayStation but then I heard WoW vanilla was coming so I had to prepare.
---
There is literally no news to talk about. I don't get the hate for the gifs; they are funny.
---
We all understand what everyone wants; blue posts, news about a release date, any new information regarding WoW Classic.
---
We aren't getting Office gifs in place of release date news, there just hasn't been any news for awhile so its just people posting funny things.
---
What's the intention of speccing hemorrhage with daggers? It's either Hemo as combo point builder, or backstab / SS, I don't see the point of speccing for both. Also, Hemo really just shines with a slow mainhand (and great gear).
---
Preperation is highly beneficial if you want to PVP, but in my opinion Premeditation is useless, I'd rather go for Cold Blood. 
---
Daggers are okay for leveling, but you'll just have a much easier time going full combat.
---
Thanks for the indepth post, awesome insight into someone who actually played through all the expansions. I feel like most people coming back to classic skipped everything after wotlk.
---
Im not so sure its relative at this point. Retail is dying...
---
I LOVE /F ADDING PEOPLE 
---
NOT SORRY FOR CAPS!
---
&gt; horde: orc is the best race, both for pvp and pve
---
Super debatable. WotF is helpful against your harder matchups, making UDs a very viable choice.
---
Raided hardcore in vanilla as a night elf druid and had the time of my life. BC came and I leveled him to 70 then started a dranei shaman to pvp and wotlk created an undead frost mage to pvp. 
---
I have no idea what I will do in this vanilla launch. 🤔😫
---
It's a 2004 OG term, euros never played in 2004
---
That was partially a joke but  could tell he was Russian by the way he was typing simple English. He eventually told us he was Russian so I kept my English as simple as possible.
---
I dont remember getting beat often by rogue as holy or recko paladin on instant 60 lvl server. I would say, its 5 vs 3
---
What class/spec were you as a nelf druid?
---
Sure go ahead, good luck finding anyone that wants to play with you tho.
---
Ah, true. I guess my brain just ignores them now lol.
---
Overall, I’d say the player base seems a lot younger and less friendly and a hell of a lot less helpful. I’m on Tichondrius for horde. So when I say less friendly know that my bar for friendly is already pretty low. I’ve been playing since vanilla and the level of toxicity I saw in general/trade on my two months on stormrage (I think) was unmatched in my 14 or so years on horde - just gross, rather violent racism/sexism. 
---
On top of that, alliance doesn’t help each other when horde pounces. I’ve only very rarely had an issue getting help when you’ve got rabid ally on you our in open world. Alliance people would just run on by
---
Raided as resto but pvped feral
---
Those aren't ladies. Ladies have class.
---
The guild group I was in hosted a 3v3 tournament there with buy in. Was tons of fun. My team took first (frost mage/disc priest/ret pally)
---
What the hell man, I'm 37 as well and my journey through WoW was almost exactly as yours!
---
I started playing USA Beta (I'm from Europe, so had to fake an address to be able to get in hah) with a nelf rogue. Still remember when sap lasts for its full duration in PVP lol. 
---
Raiding for first time in release USA servers at 03:00am because time offset, those were times.
---
When release was up in Europe I made a gnome rogue, I did a lot of PvP and topped DPS charts with my Krol Blade (I still remember when somebody ninja'd me the sword from onyxia grr) while raiding in a casual guild (we did MC/ZG and we were on Nefarian before they launched the patch that made everything easier before BC). So i'm happy to be able to run AQ/Naxx if I get there this time.
---
In BC/WOTLK I played a druid Tank which I really loved. As you said, I loved to have the control and timing of the dungeons an all the stuff you said very well and I won't repeat. I changed to druid in mid BC because I think BC was a Guild-Killer, raids being 10/20 instead of 40 hurt a lot of guilds at that time (maybe it helped others though). So my guild end up disbanding and I started the druid and joined another guild.
---
I also played Pandaria as a Human Monk as well, already had another guild drama at the end of WOTLK and quit and started fresh with the monk later, but never did serious raiding. Mostly tanking in dungeons and healing in BGs.
---
When I knew classic project was a thing, I tried to come back and played BFA. I upgraded my Monk to 110 and played as a Tank. Was doing Mythic+ and some raiding but end up bored and quit. I find the game was really "selfish" and cheesy.
---
And now in Classic I'm gonna roll a Nelf Warrior mostly to off-tank in raids (not enough time to try to be MT), tank in dungeons and PvP as Arms with a big fking weapon.
---
Probably I will have a lot of alts too.
---
Can't Wait!
---
 Knowing your website is gathering so many people hypes me so much about the amount of people that wants to play Classic. That's just the slim number of people that played it before *and* has interest in finding/being found by people from the past, and that's a very specific filter, so the real quantity of people excited for classic is so much bigger than this.
---
 I, for example, would love to register, but I only started playing WoW in Pandaria. I never been in Classic and I never been this excited for a game before. I really wish that, as your website makes me believe, the legacy server will amaze and astonish everyone's expectations. And I'm sure that if this happens, it's thanks to the amazing community that is gathering here, and you're having great part in uniting it.
---
 Thank you for your work.
---
I loved stuff like this.  Like those huge humanoid skeletons in desolace.  Its been so long I probably once knew but have forgotten; 
---
 I was big into lore before the cataclysm.
---
Yes quite, implementing “collect 15 bear asses” quests is much more time consuming for the devs.
---
If you beat shp as rogue, shadow priest prob just messed up really badly or lagged for 30sec
---
As a sidenote, as blasphemous as it may be - for me personally the raiding part of later expansions peaked in WoD even if we might've had a raidtier cut from the expansion, I really enjoyed the encounter design in that expansion. (Can't comment on Legion or BfA raids, as I barely did any)
---
However as a whole, my favorites will be vanilla, tbc &amp; wotlk - part of it is certainly nostalgia &amp; my rose-tinted-glasses, but I still remember some random situations from those days.
---
That's good knowledge. However, just a day later people figured out it's an instance that's called Deadmines and you can actually enter without the quest whatsoever. Therefore the term Deadmins / DM was used way more often compared to VC. And that's long before Dire Maul which always was abbreviated "DM \[North|East|West|Whatever\]"
---
Saying rogues lose to mage is pretty misleading. It's a skill matchup. 
---
But yes, rogues aren't nearly as good as people/that-video makes people think. Classic is 1.12, not previous patches, and that's where rogues shined the brighest. They are still pretty decent and fun as hell.
---
Not really fair to count who loses versus who when you include SL warlock that literally wins against anything.
---
that's thicc
---
Still has a thigh gap tho ;)
---
There's not really anything else to talk about unfortunately. There's a few class discussions here and there, but until Classic WoW is out it's just going to be memes.
---
Pretty sure Bluecoats beat the Redcoats when it mattered... So if you need this W, go ahead.
---
Woooooohooooooo! Upvote for Cincinnasty!
---
Almost never in my experience.
---
It's more fun than 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 sheep 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
---
&gt;
---
I see many folk saying "what after naxx"?!?! Even 4yrs after Classic has been released, there will be less than 10% of players raiding Naxx and even getting to Kel'Thuzad.
---
The absolute arrogance.
---
Yeah, that fits. I think some are done nice and you are right. Cata was the closest expansion to WotLK where they used vehicle mechanics, so it was still realtiv new and they had an script and it was nice. Sadly i think the most of these quests went wrong today. One day they suddenly decided to overdo it. Thats when the charm ended for me. I just wanted to play my char.
---
Hate that type of quest.. let me play my character.
---
Thanks for the reply :) Probably gonna go with a Rogue or a Heal Priest depending on what my friends go with then.
---
When you downvote all of the discussion all that you're left with is memes.
---
No, but i just usually frequent subreddits that are way less about memes apparently. Like /r/pathofexile, /r/onepiece, /r/worldnews, /r/competitiveoverwatch, /r/elderscrollsonline - subreddits that have a topic other than memes :P
---
Fair enough :)
---
I did the same thing on my 29 think druid back in the day wasn't paying attention and was talking to someone IRL and handed in a quest and dinged.
---
Were they though? I really disliked them even then. Nothing interesting about throwing bombs of a wyvern.
---
People often relieve stress and anxiety with humor and communal carefree timelessness. Especially when the majority of the community is men.
---
This is primal shit, man. Every since Ugg flicked Gugg in the testicles when they were waiting for the ice age to end...
---
THIS IS WHO WE ARE.
---
But is your spirit willing??
---
Nasti nati!!
---
We'll have a second chance bro!
---
LOVE that you created this website. I was hardcore on 2 realms simultaneously in vanilla so it gives me a real chance to run into people I remember. The memory lane of guild names and even quite a few player names was unreal.
---
Yeah we get the Classic Office Cinematic Universe now, until Classic comes out.
---
Yep did the same thing but from Australia :) Unfortunately here the reset time was 7pm so we'd always be fucked.
---
I'm so excited I can't wait :)
---
TBC and Wrath were actually quite controversial and killed off a lot of guilds
---
Well at the time it felt like something "new" that was breaking away from the standard "go gather 10 hooves pls" quests. Made me think TBC was gonna be an awesome expansion for leveling. Only to find that leveling in TBC is fucking awfulbad.
---
I dunno man I was like 15 and this was my first mmo. I think I just wanted to explore the other starting areas
---
Yes, this is DM indeed
---
This.... a little harsh.... but this
---
Hint, they have a game to play. We are waiting for ours
---
I'm going horde this time though.  Since I mained a druid the first time.  A twink druid might be fun.
---
Maybe it’s in part because tips is the guy who doubled down on “OMG BETA LEAK” a few weeks back (which was actually the employee alpha) and released two videos claiming it was confirmed before everyone had to walk it back after a blue post, but he didn’t (at least not right away on a new video, maybe he did on stream).
---
I get it, I’m tired of the “anchors” in the community just rehashing the same content individually, then together on a podcast, and then on streams together... we all want more from Blizz but it’s gotten painful watching content creators just doing the same thing over and over... at least now they’re putting out phase BIS lists and whatnot.
---
Those vacuum skills...reminds me of one of those Japanese zen gardens.
---
Serious question... I just resubbed to wow a few days ago.   How are there female dwarves that are like 6' tall?
---
Imagine they do some sketches out if this for the release.
---
And Video ads like Mr T.
---
I'm Dwight and I'm the best of them all. "you are the only lv 60 in your guild no wonder youre the best"
---
keep up the work man, makes the wait funnier
---
Excatly!
---
I have a gaming pc and 1440p 32" 75hz monitor that I literally only use for classic wow if that counts.
---
You and me both! Still can’t wait. Since it’ll stay vanilla/classic, there’s no rush.
---
Really, really, really low effort.
---
Yea, there’s company decisions issues of course, but it’ll be as stable as anything. More stable than private servers.
---
True! However there won't be 50 bored level 60s lurking, just a couple. It's like leveling in Jurassic Park. You can take out most of the dinos, but you have to constantly keep an eye out for that T-Rex!
---
[Definitely a luck dragon...](https://youtu.be/7QdLc9Fz4dI)
---
That hasnt stopped other subreddits from producing content. If a person who wants to post a meme simply instead... does not post a meme. Then content from other people will be visible and people will interact with it.
---
I have this dream of organising an arena tournament, completely player created, using the limited tools that Vanilla provides us. So 3v3 and/or 5v5 groups enlist and matches are played like a single elimination or perhaps double elimination bracket. People can view from the bannisters and it would be streamed, perhaps by someone better than me at commentating (probably). 
---
Naturally we would need some rules and referees because anyone can just enter the arena. I like the idea of it being organic though, we don't need the GMs to come down in their righteous might and banish these interlopers to GM prison. 
---
Would be fun.
---
Yes I would agree here as well. It’s memorable, but you start to can feel the tedium immediately if you missed a couple mobs and need to do another round.
---
You clearly haven't met a lot of religious fanatics if you think "show some respect" or "sellout" is indicative of that.
---
The thing is content creators for classic wow will ofc have lower quality content right now since classic wow is not even out yet. The content right now is more of a "keep the hype train going" purpose.
---
How many houses are you planning to buy? :D
---
&gt;a few more things
---
As someone who has never been a hardcore raider there is A LOT more than that.
---
I'm the more casual type guy that loves doing instances, farming, gathering herbs, doing PvP and the weekend raid as a pug.  Then when you want to do it on another character that's a whole other adventure right there.  To say what you're saying is pretty egregious in my mind honestly and really minimizing the experience of certain players.
---
He's alluded to having insider info many times before, and it's all been utter bullshit so far. People are just starved for info and will believe anything...
---
Definitely. Anyone who played Wrath will remember the never ending whining about how much the expansion sucks and is the worst WoW has ever been. It's funny that most people (myself included) now hail it as the best expansion when it was so brutally hated back in the day.
---
Ah the basement. A wow players natural habitat.
---
That thing has been proven to be fake many, _many_ times over now. The only reason it gained traction is because OP lied about what they "predicted".
---
Still not many on nazgrel
---
I live in lebanon... a country with 17 religions. The shit i've seen, they would not even show you on the news. 
---
Am paraphrasing here😅. And drawing a comparison of behavioral reaction.
---
Really though I miss ventrilo. I hate discord. And I had not thought about the PTT sound until your post so from the bottom of my heart, no trolling, thank you.
---
Kul Tirans?
---
This is awsome xD I love the idea of Office vs parks and recreation, both are good show. This is truly epic time of gif. I would love to see more :)    
---
Ps. I still favorite Top Dog but this is awsome work mate!
---
Y’all make my day a lil brighter 😂😂😂
---
Wheres the fridge and porta potty?
---
What's that?
---
I'd like to see how the room looks like 6 month's after Classic release
---
Haha fucker :)
---
People on this sub will believe anything they want to believe. It happens over and over.
---
I seriously have stayed away from this game for the past 4-5 years.   New race?
---
Who dey baby!
---
Dunno read the other fucking posts about this.
---
As a us guy I've never seen vc used outside of this subreddit.
---
You can either be a traitor or belong to the best faction. Your choice :o
---
Yeah. They fat humans basically
---
I feel that, the charm of using it today is far less so than immediately after its introduction like you said. I think the more interesting point you’ve uncovered here is quest design as a whole feels a bit stale, so could it be possible to develop a new design concept to improve the questing experience the way vehicles did. And staying on topic, at what point does a new mechanic become overused?
---
And to be fair, the quest was fun, new, and different at the time. Now it's just another played out mechanic that never really contributed to what really made WoW stand out.
---
Guys like this tipsout dude do nothing but glorify pservers at the expense of vanilla.  
---
I've heard him flat out say vanilla players didn't know about the benefit of engineering in PvP.   Or that world buffs were good for progression.
---
Is say it's more likely, they are trying to bait fools to get them more clicks.
---
I am disgusted by this pink icon to the right.
---
This is without a doubt my biggest fear in returning to classic
---
Oh shit.... Like me.... 🤠
---
Of course we do, we wash them in Ally blood !
---
Humans from Kul Tiras, now a playable allied race
---
Upgrade: "Collect 150 bear asses in your Ultimate Shredder"
---
Nah it's more chill but just a different experience. I also enjoy annoying the hordes of lowest common denominator DPS classes being unkillable in PvP so am leaning towards Pala.
---
inb4 Where's the dog?
---
Goin totally opposite of my entire wow "career" by swapping to alliance to play a holy pala. 
---
Shit gon' be crazy.
---
A great addition to this would be if we could enter "Alternate" names in a field.  For example, I played under a few different names (different mains over the course of vanilla), but I was often known by an entirely different name on voice coms.
---
"Auf ein Bier" (https://www.patreon.com/aufeinbier), a podcast project that had about 20k € / month donations a month if I remember correctly. They moved to a 2nd patreon style provider, so the 15k mentioned at patreon are only a part of the cake. 
---
They talk about everything gaming 5 times a week (in German as mentioned). So they basically cover all freaking games from indie to AAA. But not a single word about WoW Vanilla. 
---
Just guessing that WoW isn't very popular among gaming journalists as it scooped up a major part of the players back in 05-06 so none was very interested in other new games..
---
I was also on Bleeding Hollow(Alliance), we said VC, right?
---
those are actually thicc humans
---
I have no experience with hemo, but since it boost physical damage on the target for a few secs afterwards it seems like a good choice.
---
As for premeditation, I only took it because as a last point anyways. I’ll probably respec at 60 to my late game spec anyways.
---
I know that combat swords and even dagger is better for straight up levelling and dps (as i stated), but I have played that a few times already and since we are duo levelling, I want to use the burst from daggers and pair it with nice pvp and stealth capabilities. Since I will be levelling with a Druid, he can tank and I’ll just backstab all day long while we level.
---
&gt; **American** Office
---
Is this just a way for you to try and shit on anything American? What is it with you weird EU people who just like to sit on your high horse and pretend that anything America touches is shit?
---
Go fuck yourself. 
---
Side note: Enjoy missing out on one of the greatest shows out there because it was about an office in America rather than... anywhere else?
---
Yes. Fuck.
---
I have my doubts about TipsOut's beta leaks, because if he *was* invited to Blizz to discuss the beta he would doubtless have been NDA'd up to the eyeballs. So either discussing posisble betas isn't part of the NDA (thus isn't happening) or he's in a lot of trouble (begs the question why he would risk future goodwill by leaking).
---
I was like oh shit!   She looks like me but tall!
---
Behind me in the picture! It’s empty at the moment, soon to be stocked with cases of beer!
---
Great work :D
---
Sure it’s debatable, but the stun resist is really damn good. Also wotf has to be activated preemptively iirc. Additionally, undead has no dps increasing racial. So overall I’m convinced that orc is the best race for horde rogues.
---
It will stay clean, my wife will lose her damn mind if there is a speck of dirt on the floor.
---
I think my point is getting missed here under all the rose tinted glasses, and the fact that some don't want to hear it. 
---
I purely meant for the players who have never played it, if they start to compare, the list is a fair bit shorter then retail, and the grind is real.
---
We are starting to go away from my original post point here.
---
This is the year my friend!
---
You can have fun and enjoy the game while also being optimal and good at it. Checkmate bads.
---
Absolutely.
---
Welcome to the Alliance :) Our starting zones are the best, not gonna lie.
---
Np. Just remember, too. That raids are huge in size compared to Retail. So at the end of the day, you’ll often find you can get into a group even with a sub-optimal, or even “useless (though almost nothing is COMPLETELY useless)”   You just wont be anyone’s top priority, but play what you will have fun with.
---
I don’t think I’ll be starting Druid (I might, though) but I definitely will be playing one despite the hybrid tax. And I’ll be back to wrecking face in PvP and having other classes regretting not being one of my brethren. ;)
---
currently this sub is completely bullshit. yes
---
is this troll?   
---
They already confirmed it will be the 1.12 version
---
Maybe that's when NDA is of and those guys will have already been in beta and they can start streaming
---
Idk man - I played on a lot of servers. I think this may just be a pve server. On all the PvP servers I played on - it was usually fairly empty
---

---
Eurotrash is awake and downvoying this
---
Yes, within the first few quests of TBC you encounter one
---
In TBC I helped a dude lvl from 20-30. I was about 14 years old. We chatted a lot and I thought I made a friend. I was already max lvl and continued to help him over a few days whenever we were both online.
---
While lvling he kept thanking me and said he would pay me. I didnt do it for the money and told him I was happy to help. He said he felt bad and insisted on paying me something. I eventually agreed and ran over to his character to trade gold. But he didn't want to trade gold. He asked to get my mom's credit card details. I'm dumb but not that dumb so I ignored him and left. 
---
This was on a private server.
---
&gt;Just gaining access to Naxx was a pain and cost a lot of gold to get attuned
---
dude, its the easiest thing. Just run stratholme and sholo, u get revered in 3 weeks .
---
Yeah it was very difficult to commit to leaving my horde brethren but I'm excited to try some new zones. Also, even as a lifetime hordie I always loved the dwarf models.
---
Some numbers will have to be crunched. The real question is how much dps does a group gain whit a shaman. If the dps is high enough the shaman us carrying his weight. And here I mean in the caster groups. Sins mele groups will have a shaman no matter what. In a group of say 4 warlocks for example. How much more damage can they make whit treath reduction and mana spring/tide. Or can you bring another dps if your healing group have mana totems. What I,m interested in is raid dps I don't care if a player is doing 20% of a top dps if it increases the raid dps
---
If not our gifs, then at least our top [dogs](https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/bmxjir/classic_borderlands_collie/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link)
---
you  guys read too much into it
---
Haha I’m right there with you. I’m trying my best to wait patiently. Maybe we will get a blue post today? Fingers crossed!!
---
Well we don’t have a game to play yet so we’re just doing weird shit.
---
hahah loving the meme war, and i love that you used a different show.  keep it coming gents, this is passing the time til classic
---
If she has a problem with dirt, she should be the one cleaning up\^\^
---
Did you call him?
---
I tried a Rogue in a private server a while ago and was surprised at how many classes countered me. Mages in particular were no go. 
---
Kinda disappointing for such a heavy pvp class.
---
lol no, it's all the wrath babies who don't actually want vanilla and are only seeing classic as an opportunity to make their dogshit expansion official
---
Naxx was released in June 19th 2006, and tBC was 16th Jan 2007, so raiders had 7 months of raiding Naxx before TBC was released.  The fact so little players were in it, was because it needed the best gear. Players had to have full BWL &amp; AQ40 gear, which takes time to get there. 
---
While I still think more players will venture into Naxx, it wont be causal players. Average raiding guilds (not the top hardcore raiders) who by 2-3yrs are all geared up and clearing BWL/AQ40, will only then be ready for Naxx. 
---
I honestly think people are over simplifying how difficult Naxx was.
---
No more :(
---
then get out of here
---
Druid with dog form? no changes...
---
Lol and now of course your whole channel has been copystriked? Doesn't look like you have any videos up anymore
---
Is this a Morrowind model?
---
It’s literally the same information. ClassicDB steals info from Classic Wowhead. It’s impossible for one to be complete and not the other.
---
Let the fight begin.
---
Alliance zones are typically more "high fantasy", castles, forests, farmlands etc. For anyone who grew up reading lotr, GoT, etc it's definitely more familiar.
---
Doesn’t do that to me.
---
No worries Reddit works great for me just wanted to give you a heads up. Loving the memes!
---
Not available in Canada and US. I'll be finding a third alternativ aswell.
---
Fair enough, stay safe.
---
well by speed leveling, you skip the most interesting chain quest, follow a route without exploring the world and so on. You cannot stare at the sky in ashenvale, read the hierogyphes on troll ruins etc...
---
&gt; Is say it's more likely, they are trying to bait fools to get them more clicks.
---
I'm not sure if I'd chalk it up to malice, he just appears very gullible and naive. 
---
But whatever the case, it does sure seem to be working for clicks, and I guess at the end of the day that is what matters.
---
The office gifs are the most generic boomer tier memes I've ever seen
---
when i played wrath and tried cata i could not believe how they made you use those stupid fucking tanks all the time lol... AWESOME GUYS I CAN DRIVE AROUND IN THIS STUPID LOOKING MACHINE AND USE 3 ABILITIES WAOW  SUCH FUN
---
Back when I was a 10 year old gnome warlock with engineering, I made the gnomish invis thingy.
---
I used to pop it, jump down and start opening the chest (pve server btw). So what would happen was no1 wanted to jump down first and interrupt the lvl 30 gnome cause then they would for sure lose their chance at getting the chest. 
---
I managed to get the 12x trinkets fairly early, at lvl 45 or smth this way. I was proud af and that shield you could pop with the blue trinket was insane.
---
thats kinda the brawlers guild now but its pve
---
Cata questing is the absolute worst style of questing. I maintain that I loved WoD's questing, but in general I'll take BC era questing over anything any day of the week. Nothing beats the rush of turning in 10 quests at once, and nothing beats the fulfillment of being able to form a connection to a hub (Thrallmar) because you've been there and back again 3+ times. Not like in modern WoW where there's no reason to have an innkeeper in any town because you have fuck all reason to return after you've done the 3 quests they have to offer.
---
I'll probably play around a bit on a NE Warrior, see how I like it compared to a Dwarf one.
---
Frankly I think it's an American thing.
---
You guys are absolutely obsessed by money.
---
I have absolutely no idea what an earning call is, and frankly I don't want to know (and it's not like I'm a kid, I'm 41 btw).
---
It's probably why I'm poorer than you though :D
---
two men enter... one man leaves... two men enter... one man leaves... two men enter... one man leaves...

*fast forward to rogues killing both*
---
I want to know more about that devilsaur leather mafia loll
---
I really don't know. Since world quests got introduced in legion they bloomed again. Fly this gryphon in Suramar, throw some thunder. Fly this dragon, throw some thunder. Drive this boat throw some spears. It felt like it replaced proper quest where i could have played my character. 
---
Then in BFA while my first playthrou, i somehow recognised a pattern in quests. I sometimes felt, that the current part of a quests  will be a later world quest and the quest itself, somehow fit into lore but was only written like that to have a world quest at this point. Not always, but a lot of quests felt like this for me. Mostly the vehicle quests, where they had creative ideas but it felt always the same.
---
An example to describe this feeling outside Wow for me is at mobile games or browser games. There is a game which is sucessfull and then thousand clones spawned and it all looks different because of different used assets. Then you play each one, and you not only notice it's not only similar to game 1, but seriously almost the same. Button 1 does the same in game 1000 than in game 1, menu look same, have the same bugs, same overworld layout, similar artstyle and so on. Then you see game 1000 was from the same firm of game 1 and you know they went lazy for money reasons. Then you uninstall game 1000 ...
---
Thats how i feel a concept is overused.
---
You tell them. I fnd it funny how upset people get here.
---
Dude didn't you get the memo ? 
---
Right now the meta is about The Office &amp; dogs memes.
---
You're so last week !
---
There's a lot of talk like we will either see an announcement on Sunday or we will get a blue post. I also take everything I read about Classic way too seriously.
---
Poke it harder man maybe it will move.
---
Don’t ask for a rushed game.... if you want to know what it looks like when a game is forced to a specific dateline : /r/anthemthegame you don’t want that to wow Classic.
---
Pls :’(
---
And if you were to meet another warrior+paladin in arena there wouldn't be a fight the game would just award both teams a victory. There would not be differently rated warrior paladin teams all the way from total shit to gladiators based on their skill.
---
Ha, Im literally moving out this summer and have made it a point to move out before classic releases. One of our requirements is room for a gaming den like this. Great job!
---
Devilsaur leather created player run mafias
---
Say what now?
---
People will interact with things that interest them. Right now there is nothing more interesting than memes. Because everything has already been discussed. Literally. Everything.
---
Playing that bombing quest in the beta for TBC was pretty great the first few times, nothing like it really existed before that. I also liked what they did with the vehicle mechanics in Wrath raids.
---
Sounds like they really did them to death though. The daily bombing quests in Quel'Danas were an absolute chore and I assume they've only gotten staler since then.
---
OG Deadmines is one of the best dungeons of all time imo. I don't mind the revamp but being totally cut off access to the original was awful.
---
Where's the AGM and Furlbog Pouch though
---
I'm not sure what faction yet,depends what my friends want to play,I mained a pally the first time. I played a think druid and a twink mage it was a lot of fun.
---
Rules of reddit:

Is it just me or- NO! it's not just you.

When you talk about WSG-reps you did not mention that you get tokens from participating. 3 tokens for a win and 1 token for a loss.

---
hunters are much much easier to level than other classes. ofc not as safe to level as classes on retail but still, if you try a warrior, that shit is much slower, has downtime after each npc and risk dying  if he pulls 2 npc
---
I'll use the opportunity to test the classes and decide which one will be my main. I want to heal, so I'll surely check if paladin is really that annoying to level, if druids are just mediocre in everything they do, if it's possible to heal dungeons without healing talents...  
---
 I also expect to make a bunch of mistakes on the Beta so I don't make them on live hahaha
---
Just compare animations so I can decide on a race. I don't want to do any actual gameplay.
---
IF.. i get invited, i will pick something which will not be my main.  
---
i'll guess i go rogue or something..
---
My girlfriend is moving abroad after august. I'm gonna turn our apartment into one big basement dedicated for dark WoW hours.
---
I have an aging battlestation (Nov 2013) that I've been itching to upgrade. Totally unnecessary for WoW, but I wanted to move to 1440p for other games that I play too.
---
I pulled the trigger last night. Now the wait begins for my parts to start arriving. 😁
---
I know, my own guild was shattered by the move from 40/20 raids to 25/10s. And for me personally, WoW ceased to be "my game" with the prepatch to WotLK.
---
However, I think the trigger for Karash stepping down as MVP was the increase in revenue-generating services (character services, ingame shop), which in his eyes destroyed WoW's integrity as a game.

The only one of these I enjoyed was in wrath during the wolf cult quests in the grizzly hills where you were on the back of a horse throwing fire as droves of worgen chased you. Maybe this was better for me because if you didn't do well enough the worgen would actually catch up and kill your horse (I actually failed the first time)
---
Thats why i bought the expansion i thought it was coming with it at release sigh
---
DPS doesn't make a difference for feral druids, because they don't hit with the actual weapon, ever. All that matters is the raw stats/buff effects from the weapon, which is why pummeler is the best because it's increasing the number of white hits you land on the boss by 50%. Tryhard feral dps'ers will spend several hours per weak farming gnomeregan for pummelers just so they can have one for every boss during raid night.
---
play the beta
---
Man, I hope that scene wouldn't get sharded.
---
It's really not. I play both factions pretty consistently (sort of like youre considering, I prefer horde but my favorite main is a Nelf Druid) and both sides are generally pretty equal. In a lot of cases its literally the same players.
---
Pretty sure a name is frozen (for other people) for a while after it's been deleted so you can delete Chad and have a while to create your new dwarf without fear of the name being taken. I think it's as long as 6 months?
---
Did you actually level as a healadin?  Or did you level your Paladin as ret like everyone else?  Because yeah, old Ret Paladins where not so bad, they had buttons and a rotation.  It was a crap rotation, but you could press buttons to make things happen faster.  But if you were like me and spent your first 30 levels trying to be a healing paladin in instances you would have had a bad enough time that this guy's post rings quite true.
---
If you didn't have Seal of Retribution your DPS as a Paladin was mostly auto-attack.
---
Signed up twice and when I go back to the list it still doesn’t show my name, so the answer to your question is “no”
---
Install, play will settings, check frame rate, do a 1-10/12 leveling route with the class/race I'm going to main as a practice run thru. Look for bugs.
---
All I'm saying is it's not as clear-cut as you make it to out. Will of the Forsaken is arguably one of the strongest racials in the game for PvP, and it does increase your DPS in quite a few fights in Vanilla, as fear is a pretty prevalent mechanic in vanilla raiding. It's nowhere near as consistent as Blood Fury in that regard, but it's something. 
---
Doesn't have to be pre-activated by the way. 
---
Orc is definitely a better class if you want to min-max and be an allrounder, but for pure PvPers, UD are definitely a very viable choice.
---
I am still trying to decide what race to roll for my rogue. I will choose between human or dwarf, I plan to play both pve and pvp. Human seems to have a little bit for both, while dwarf will be so good for pvp. Lack of cloak of shadows will hurt badly and stoneform works like a little tiny CoS for getting rid of those dots. On the other hand, human has +10% to rep gains, which will come in handy in farming AV/WSG/AB reps.
---
 What do you guys think?
---
Yeah I remember 2k was pretty good in TBC. There is no way someone who thinks like this even got past 1500.
---
Yea. We are past trying to predict release dates.
---
Because trade chat will become twitch chat trying to get the attention of the streamer. Faction imbalance. They will be traveling in mobs causing server lag wherever they are. If the streamer stops playing your server will die overnight.
---
Basically the server will become about the streamer and not classic wow.
---
I'm balls deep into rolling a shaman.  So... For the horde!
---
I'm against the BETA happening at all, but if Blizzard decides to actually launch a BETA and I'm one of the people getting invited to it then I will probably just try out some leveling routes and look around for stuff to see what works/doesn't work compared to pservers (if chests requires a level to open as an example).
---
Tame Impala?
---
I know its a meme, but people need to calm down.  
---
We'll get an release date, whenever Blizz is ready to communicate.
---
To be honest, thousandwinter vehicles were the only ones i found satisfying. That was pretty cool.
---
Something tells me classic isnt going to go down like that.
---
Mom get the camera
---
I wasn't that hardcore.  I had 6 or 7 for the AGM.
---
Back in the day when I would see an Alliance t shirt or sticker on a car I would instantly pissed. I’m a horde pvp player for life.
---
It started to happen around the time they started to report decreased player numbers. It certainly increased when they stopped reporting player numbers altogether.
---
People unhappy looking for validation "Changes have occured and now they make x% less or have x% less players".
---
Very few actually care about the profitability of ATVI. Look at the hate mobile games get.
---
Exactly this. Raiding back during Vanilla was very different to todays scene. It's ultimately why they opted for 25 mans during TBC. You could clear most of the raids with a LOT of deadweight. I was the prime example of this back in the day. I managed to clear up to half way through AQ40 on my hunter back in the day while literally clicking all my abilities and having no idea what the auto attack timer was. I had no rotation whatsoever; I just clicked whatever ability wasn't on cooldown.
---
15 dolla make you holla
---
Not malice, greed and manipulation.
---
Fair point! To each their own.
---
MMM, my kind of humans ;)
---
We should get more “sell me your class” or “whats after naxx?” or “how good is ret in raiding”.... right?
---
Nobody is asking about a rushed game. I would be completely fine with a blue post stating that the timeline has changed and the release will not be in summer. The uncertainty is whats killing us, summer is nearing very fast and we still have no info.
---
nothing. I once played a beta and it ruined my entire enthusiasm for a game. I mean it will be hard, but I will skip beta and go fulltilt straight into release
---
Yeah, there's the usual shitposting and flame wars, but I see a LOT more of it in regards to Classic. You can't discuss Classic on forums/boards without at least two of the above shitposts being posted.
---
Same here. Playing Warcraft 3 with these mystical, mysterious elves different from the others was so intriguing, and then getting to see their civilization up close? So cool
---
It was fun the first time they did it in BC. It quickly lost its flavor. Kinda like washing dishes when you're a kid. It looks like tons of fun until you actually have to do it regularly.
---
How hard is it to get into a group as a rogue? I feel like it would be incredibly difficult as warriors wouldn't want to share sword loot and druids wouldn't want to share leather. Do I just have a greedy outlook on things?
---

---
It wasn't all bad though. Essence font looks absolutely amazing and filled the aoe hole in the toolkit and the mastery borrowing from set bonus was really smart.
---
I understand why they did it, to make it cleaner and easier, but it removed the fun of fist weaving to store up mana tea so you could dump crazy mana into burst healing
---
If you were 14 when Vanilla came out that makes you 29-30, and you’re referring to yourself as an old man?!
---
I actually think gurubashi is a bigger deal on RP over RP-PvP, because on RP servers the PvP is more organised and concentrated in events. Whereas in RP-PvP servers there is PvP everywhere, including on the sidelines.
---
I'm SO excited for the savagery that goes down in BRM
---
Catform, pull with FF, kill one mob, pull next one, kill it, pull next one, kill it, switch, regrowth/reju, switch catform repeat
---
When triple mobs are pulled, shift, root one, reju, shift bear, kill them all, shift, heal up again.
---
When I get low while fighting, shift, warstomp, regrowth, shift back, continue.
---
I'm fairly certain the reason they weren't available to the public back then was a limit on web conferencing.  Now that it is so much easier to let large groups of people listen in, many more companies are doing earnings calls for everyone instead of just Wall St guys.
---
Yeah I understand, I also can’t wait for the released. I just don’t want them to release a buggy game because of player’s pressure.
---
If it’s have to be in fall, it’s ok too...
---
It is very likely that this was coordinated with Blizzard to help feed the hype.
---
Thanks mom!
---
But the game was finished in 2006? wouldn't call that "rushed" xD
---
I played priest in vanilla too, i LOVED healing in 5 man, not that much in raid enviroment though. It was really satisfying as a priest if you were skilled enough to transform a sure-wipe situation to an epic/exciting pull that spike up your adrenalin!
---
Because you don't understand yet how broken permafrost is.
---
Good looking setup. I'm lowkey jelly.
---
Sadly i did not - and i suppose this is as far as my skills in MS paint goes  😉
---
&lt;3
---
I would say a lot. I joined at the very end of classic (probably a month before TBC release) and I’m about to turn 25 in July.
---
Most of my friends have always been older though, and only one of them returning is under 30. The rest are 30 (all the way up to 68!). 
---
I plan to go hard on Classic for a bit, then work more on getting my life straight and cutting down gaming time. (Seriously, lets hope classic doesn’t absorb me that much... again...) 
---
I’m struggling though if I should begin as my old first character (mage) or go Druid. Sadly, I remember how bad Druids were for PVE and that’s throwing me off wanting to play one a bit for a starter. (Despite them being god-mode for pvp, at least with my playstyle)
---
Hope everyone else has as much fun during classic as I’m hoping to have.  This really feels like a second chance at a once in a life time opportunity/event. Something I never thought I’d get to feel again. I can’t wait.
---
Looks dope man. How's the sound with a speaker under the desk?
---
Arthas had regular Gurubashi area 2s tournaments all the time. I attended my first one after Battlegrounds were released but they had been happening for a while by then. Not sure about regular betting but I know there was some betting on the matches.
---
I couldn't agree more. Thats the reason why i like kill quests in classic and not in modern WoW and are even fine with grind.
---
Desperation has led us to Goldshire retrievers.
---
Just the initial character login, I think.
---
What BfA ?

there is litterly %0,0 evidence that that would be the case.

While I agree with most of what you've said, you can't apply our morals and knowledge of both history and current world events to someone who was born in 1891.
---
People back then had a completely different world view and had much less information at hand, compared to today. Nowadays anyone can use the internet or a library and essentially debunk any lie. People trusted their government because they loved their country. Even today so many people believe in lies politicians feed us. It's easier to live that way, albeit ignorant.
---
Saying he should've refused to support Hitler from the get go is nonsense. Even after WWII began (maybe until early 1940) Hitler was seen as the best thing that had ever happened to Germany. People still believed Poland "invaded" Germany first. Austrians wanted to become part of the Reich, because it was so "great".
---
We all know how it ended, but in the early years of Hitler's reign, people were happier than ever before and most men in the military (like my grandfather) seriously believed they were only defending their country.

Yuck. Fes.

[Bill Gates literally never said that.](https://electronics.howstuffworks.com/tech-myths/5-myths-about-bill-gates3.htm)
---
In what world does and equally skilled/geared rogue beat a druid? Bear form is basically tungsten when it comes to rogue damage.
---
Pretty easy imo. Never had an issue.
---
I have a strange feeling that beta will be open. I mean, what is the most important stuff to have tested? In my opinion - bugs and server load. Both are best tested by a lot of people. Also, how does Blizzard estimate how many servers they will need for launch? How can they better measure interest than checking it out during beta?
---
They did open demos before releases of Diablo 3 and Overwatch, I think they might do the same for Classic. Also, there were open betas before Classic, right? So betas could be open now just like back then, would ve a nice touch, wouldn't it? :)
---
I read that swimming does the trick.
---
Why? I kind of expected it to drop Q1 given that we were already able to preorder since blizzcon.
---
See just how much of the "pros" information is correct ;)
---
Since I will play Alliance in Classic I would make a Horde character in the beta, if I was invited. I'd probably play a class that I know I wouldn't play after release, maybe Warlock or Shaman.
---
No, classicdb has been around for a lot longer than Classic Wowhead and yes, it has aggregated information from the actual Wowhead site in the past (and scraped all comments posted before cata). But there are pages that are simply missing from Wowhead that are there in classicdb. I know because I've tried using classic wowhead instead of classicdb, but like I said pages were missing.
---
Maybe they've been added back now, and I can't remember which ones they were but they just weren't there.
---
Also, look at [this](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=759/conjure-mana-agate#taught-by-item), then look at [this](http://classicdb.ch/?spell=759#taught-by-npc). I do think eventually though, that Wowhead will be better. In a lot of ways it already is; it has original comments from back in the day. Still, for now, use classicdb if you are playing already.
---
Mafia obviously sounds more sensational than the real thing - which would be more accurately described as a monopoly, or maybe a cartel.   
---
Basically a group of players realized that devilsaur leather is limited, rare and predictable to farm. So they made sure to get all the devilsaurs as soon as they spawned, hoard the leather and sell it at high prices.   
---
This was done in varying extent on multiple servers.
---
&gt; It's funny that most people now hail it as the best expansion 
---
Pretty sure that's TBC. At least, as far as I've seen.
---
Thanks! Didn't know about that DB before, that's really awesome for historical purposes. Time to go down the rabbit hole of reading old abilities...
---
Lol it's a common complaint from bads and people who didn't even play in arena. You could read these kind of idiotic comments back in the day on the forums, then click on their armory and without fail you'd see no arena teams or sub 1500 arena teams.
---
A very knowledgeable member of the PServer community did the math on moonkin aura under ideal conditions, eg. in a spellcaster group and it only amounts to around 100 extra DPS when you add it all up, which leaves the moonkin still several hundred DPS behind pure classes. Plus, the innervate is almost always going to be used on themselves in order to keep dps'ing.
---
Protip for Jailbreak:  Clear the entire Jail area the NPC is going to walk before starting it and shout down any idiots that try to tell you it's a waste of time.
---
The real waste of time is having to do Jailbreak twice when you end up pulling two packs because you were trying to be cute and save 5 minutes.
---
Maybe a unique tabard?
---
As a loyal dual-factioner (whose heart belongs to the Alliance), I have to say, I miss the OG Barrens. Vast open savanna, traveling the Gold Road, the sense of the world being a large actual world, the music—for me, the Barrens felt like a realistic place in a way few other zones do. (Uldum, Kun-Lai, and pre-Cata Loch Modan are the only others that come to mind.) It and Thousand Needles are the places I’ve missed most, and Azshara now that I can appreciate the lore better.
---
You're totally right, but it's also not the whole picture. SL is more a dueling spec, so if youre only talking about 1v1s everything holds up. But in premade BGs most locks seem to run cannonball spec for the burst, making them much more vulnerable to a rogue no? (seriously asking, not an expert on either class)
---
lol
---
But why would you explore the world if you have already done so a gazillion times on the new hyped classic pserver of the month?
---
Will play alliance just for the fun, then when classic launches I´m rolling horde.
---
It really really is
---
I don't see a poop bucket. I don't see a mini fridge or microwave either. Shame.
---
It would be nice but at the same time i think blizzard would lose out on a lot of cash if they let people get their nostalgia fix for free (or is a subscription usually required for beta?)
---
Please let him fast forward to release :)
---
Actually coming to think of it that does Sound reasonable...
---
Why else would those things "happen"? I mean... It can´t be that hard to not F**k up when you had an NDA and everything. It usually works out so why would tips not be able to Keep himself shut?!
---
If that were to be true that would be pretty crazy and not very nice just to boost Sub Counts...
---
You need one of those hard plastic things to put under your chair. Makes moving easier and protects that new carpet. Well worth the investment.
---
Yikes.
---
Sauce
---
What's he done exactly?
---
I see no point in playing beta. Played pserver up to 60 and that's enough for me.
---
I saw the tank need on a BOP blue healer drop exactly like this..  and then argued that the spirit on the neck was an upgrade and good for tanking.   What a fuckwad.  He almost certainly vended it immediately after hearthing.   Guys like that are what you get with a 10k+ population.   I am so looking forward to a classic server with the 'correct' population levels.
---
As a shaman healer I can't wait until the hunters decide they need the mail int/spirit gear so they don't run out of mana as fast.
---
Great idea! I'll probably create an alliance character then..
---
You need to bait a mage’s blink. Do that and you win. I’d say the perfect player at each class... mage would win, but in reality a rogue probably would most of the time.
---
Human with Sword Spec is going to be a lot more DPS than a dwarf with the equivalent due to the racial. If you plan to be combat swords exclusively, Human is the only choice really.
---
If you're looking to use daggers primarily, or swap between all options/specs, you're probably better off going Dwarf because Stoneform is so insanely good against certain classes for pvp.
---
Sub tree is pretty bad in vanilla, especially for leveling. It only became kinda viable at endgame with decent gear and even then it was completely overshadowed by assassination and combat
---
muahaha mine now
---
For me, it's the animations, appearance, and gameplay mechanics.
---
Dual-wielding a pair of brightly enchanted swords, stomping and slashing in a hunchback posture, wearing pirate boots.
---
Stalking your enemies. Picking locks for your buddies.
---
Riding a fuming skeletal warhorse with glowing hooves.
---
Step one: Wait until everyone is asleep
---
Step two: Make your friend who does not want the chest run into the arena and be bait
---
Step three: Stab the one other player who had the same idea in the back, while they fight your friend
---
Step four: Open the chest, be proud of yourself
---
rinse and repeat (I have forgotten how often you will have to do this, 8 times?)
---
Disclaimer: This worked for me on a RP-PVE server, might not work in PVP-crazyness-land
---
What a great project.  Thanks for creating it!
---
I co-lead a guild back then, and we did get a lot of the guys into a facebook group, but nowhere near all.  If some people can find us from there, that would be great :)
---
he hasnt released a video in 5 days ?
---
I'm assuming you mean in 5 mans? Learn how to distract/sap well and tell the party lead you're happy to CC!
---
Just ban him and delete his YouTube
---
I’m right there with ya bud! I couldn’t be more excited to auto attack for a thousand hours to hit 60 :D
---
Lol yes im about to turn 30, but i feel old.
---
How can you make a definitive statement like “this starts an arms race that ends with blizzard not trusting anyone” how do you know it’s not in blizzards best interest to have these content creators hint at the beta and generate chatter?
---
Am I the only one who thinks it is probable that Blizzard had him do something similar to what he did in order to build up hype for an announcement?
---
Not saying its true, but it is probably better to wait for an announcement, allowing him to speak freely, and then make your verdict.
---
&gt; quits paying job to become social media 'entertainer'
---
&gt; Honey trust me, this will eventually pay the bills!
---
&gt; Oh man, Blizzard invited me to their HQ, this is it, this is the breakthrough
---
&gt; breaks NDA within first 24h
---
I agree. This annoys me to no end. Either way it's messed up. I certainly won't watch his content (I didn't before this).
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bmoas5/hmmmm/
---
Hey, don't apologize. A lot of us feel just like stick dude atm..
---
Yep. That's the reason why that one in TBC is repeatable just incase people thought it was SO COOL that they just wanted to do it again.
---
Yea, complete wipe after you did so much things aint fun.
---
Thanks dude! Working on a few new ones atm, (The Raider 3, Goldshire 4 and a new video short that has Creed as a main character 👌) 
---
I've got bonus content on my YouTube aswell. The videos that dont make the cut for Reddit goes only on YouTube ☺️
---
New client. 1.12.1 to 8.2.x
---
Thats a lot of changes. Are we going to beta to see if sinister strike damage seems right? Of course not. We are going to beta to see if the client behaves.
---
I really don't see Blizzard as the guerrilla marketing type, they've given everything to us through blue posts and Blizzcon so far, so I'm pretty okay with assuming tips is just an asshole until proven otherwise.
---
How can it be rushed? It’s already been developed and released before
---
Hi Sheamus!
---
Maybe blizzard has given instructions for him to do something like that? Who knows. You're quick to judge and jumping to conclusions.
---
Yes, this makes sense but how long of a beta would you really need for that?
---
Those filthy casual memers ! /jk ;-)
---
I played alliance in vanilla, but my very first two characters were horde. My friend stopped playing almost immediately so I switched to alliance for some reason. 
---
I think whatever you choose, you can't lose. If you have alliance characters, you have that true nostalgia. If you have horde characters, you get to experience vanilla differently through fresh experiences.
---
To keep your poop cold and/or warm? Weird.
---
same here, i got into the cata beta near the end and it completely killed my drive to play. only saved by how fun heroics were that expansion.
---
WTH man, you cant just show a disenchant button like that, away with you
---
I created a little guide for hunters a while ago. Maybe it is usefull. [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NiJ1drXBuoKQZNWXOLsHbKRJjl2R3VRehxGITLOZe\_I/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NiJ1drXBuoKQZNWXOLsHbKRJjl2R3VRehxGITLOZe_I/edit?usp=sharing)
---
Thanks, very convincing. I’ll be sure to take that into consideration
---
You guys care way too much about these smalltime YouTube pricks.
---
Sell it for good cash to a streamer / YouTube
---
Yeah. The demo was perfect. No feedback was needed then.
---
My guild was only competent enough to do a small handful of bosses, which really makes me appreciate winged dungeons. We were able to knock out 1-2 bosses of every wing, but failed miserably on the last bosses (except the spider wing). So for example, we'd knock out instructor razuvius and gothik, but skip 4horsemen because of how hard they were. 
---
While it is true that less than one percent got to KT, I think a lot of hardcore guilds experienced what I experienced essentially
---
Streamsnipe kids

The mods here try to keep it under the table by locking the thread that linked this - https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bmoas5/hmmmm/

a blue announcement updating the time line would be fine.

Speaking as a developer, I get super pissed when the sales drones are permitted to tell development when something is 'done'.   You get shit products that are poorly tested and sometimes even incomplete.  Your skilled staff quit, making for even worse products.

More worry. Y'all a bunch of worry worgen.

Un-opt for the beta from battle.net then, please.

Rogues shits on warriors 1v1
---
Ive not been playing BFA, and would agree that there is definitely a degree of homogenisation in modern WoW that got worse with tanks specifically in BFA, but played all the tanks through Legion and once you get to playing them at a decent level they felt very distinct to me. Playing a Prot Pally vs a Guardian Druid or Blood DK against bosses that really hit you was a totally different experience, and especially on my pally the number of times i could pull a dungeon run out of my ass from the offensive capacity or the ability to save a team with Spellwarding/BoP and offhealing was great fun. Without specifics this feels like vaguely shitting on modern WoW without much reason.
---
I didnt play during classic so maybe its just that im missing a point of comparison, but its pretty rich to complain that modern WoW tanks are all the same when the difference between vanilla tanks is that only one of them is actually close to 'optimal'
---
In my experience, faction is not important, but race says a lot.
---
For example: in my experience Taurens are the chilliest and probably friendliest race around.
---
And on ally their counterpart is dwarfs.
---
Undeads are type of people which teabags, and dissrespects after killing you while you have pulled 2+ mobs and so on.
---

Do you know what they are doing ? They have to make à WoW Classic game from à retail engine. Retail got millions of line of code and thousands of feature that Classic didnt have. They need to remove or disable all of them while keeping the expérience as close as possible to thé 1.12 version.
---
They are not using a buggy 1.12 wow Classic client. They are doing a massive reverse job.
---
Loving these comments that just make u Sound like a dick with the /s behind it.
---
Thats why he was saying internal is enough - so Feedback can be given. He was asking if a beta was needed not if Feedback was needed
---
Look up the program ImageMagick, so you can decrease the photo quality a bit further.
---
I know i didn't read the fine print they just announced it along with BFA so I just assumed it was coming with it
---
I’ve stuck with the same two chars since 2005 and I’ll be rolling em again.
---
I've come to the conclusion that everyone on this sub keeps a pitchfork next to their bottle of lube.
---
I get that. I just don't approve the way people talk about these people and this dark period in history in a positive way.
---
All though, I read an article the other day claiming a recent study proved that the kids of the 21th century no longer know about the events, and are badly informed about what actually went down. So I guess society as a whole is starting to forget, and the "great generation" have been thinned out the last couple of years. All our resistance fighters from back then are dead. My grandmother is almost 100 years old. So soon there will be no one left to tell the tales.
---
I won't go on about it any longer. It's the internet  I've stated my point  and I don't want to offend anyone. Plus.. I'm probably not in the right here. I don't know the whole story. I just know my grandmother, and her stories.
---
findig bugs, there are endless item, spell, quest combations - there could be mayor gamebreaking bugs that might be exploitable. or maybe there are things that work perfectly fine but they weren't working that way in classic, and they need to reimplement small bugs, lol. also as a tool to stresstest parts of their server structure. rather have a beta than an unplayable release week due to disconnects
---
Yes, but it was backwards engineered and recreated to accurately represent Classic.

They want to make sure everything is almost exactly how we remember it with what they're using. I'd rather not come release week and find out the market has been trashed permanently because they overlooked a potential gold exploit, for example. Or that they left in a piece of gear from Legion or the millions of other things that can potentially go wrong.
---
The game is finished in the aspect that the textures, models and framework is all there. Now they have to revert *12 years* of changes and additions and make sure it's done properly.
---
It may not seem like a big deal, but small things like that can have a lingering damage to the game and Blizzard's (already tarnished) name.
---
Thank you haha.
---
Only had loading screens on the initial login / when you would be teleported back after trying to cross out of westfall / barrens
---
He was the goodest of boyes.
---
Abort yourself.
---
Nah, just Tips. He's someone with very little first-hand knowledge and just latched onto the coattails of the Classic announcement to get popular.
---
There are plenty of other people on Twitch and Youtube who actually deserve the attention.
---
Depends on how many are testing at once.
---
it's a long con.  like 3 posts from now he'll reveal the truth and announce the delayed release via office meme gif
---
Essential and optimal are 2 different things.
---
ok so im not a healer, but are you honestly telling me that Holy paladins dont run out of mana and i've just being paying absolutely zero attention, or is this a symptom of just not having to worry about mana outside of challenging content?
---
When, if ever, did it improve for leveling? I never got a rogue above lvl 21 during vanilla but when I finally picked up a copy of TBC I started one and leveled as sub and absolutely loved the improved stealth and starting engagements with a huge ambush. Mained rogue on retail from then up through the end of Legion!
---
My question is, why TipsOut out of all other content creators? Did they tell everyone in Irvine to /roll 100 and whoever is highest gets to send out a vague release date message?  
---
All in all its a lose-lose for him by posting what he did. 1) He leaked the date and broke an NDA and at risk of large $$$ penalty.  2) He is trolling and gave us a very vague comment that sounds like it is in relation Classic, but really is nothing (everyone hates him more for toying with them) 3) The least probable, that he was selected out of all WoW content creators to vaguely hit at a release date of something.
---
Why is he so hated? He seems like a nice dude...
---
Tfw I once tried to gank an orc warrior...
---
He resisted my stun, turned around and gave me the fattest WW axe credit with his overpower.
---
The goal of an actual beta testing is getting feedback and reporting bugs. I don't understand you here.
---
I feel like it taking longer to get loot and be badass adds to the enjoyment of the game. Feels more earned.
---
Since its the modern engine with the all data, there are surely bugs to find and fix. Its not a straight copy of the already working 2006 wow
---
When they said it would release in 2019, my expectation was december 31st
---
They can have the functional business requirements correct but there is no way to say it is bug free. Since they are writing new code.  Even if they used old code and made new changes... like sharding, they had no regression automation back then so whos to say its still working as intended.  Also the importance of a public beta vs internal is mainly because in internal testing they may only test everything as intended.  But in beta its the end user using it as HE INTENDED which can trigger different workflows in the backend.  Also another edge case they had smaller server capacities and limitations now going forward 2019 if they take off those limitations then they need to test performance and blizzard may only be able to simulate that and do not have the resources to test it without an open beta.  Hope this convinced you ;)
---
bugs, stress testing, measure realistic interest so they an sort out server sizes etc. And if things come up that people really want changed then im sure this subreddit will be grateful for the beta infinitely moreso than anybody else will
---
To casually enjoy battle grounds and some world pvp, it is not a requirement, although it's definitely nice to have.
---
If you are wanting to seriously attempt ranking, it is essential, yes. Others might disagree, but personally from the perspective of someone who did rank to 11 in vanilla, iron grenade is the single most useful consumable in the game.
---
Being financially literate isn't really exclusive to Americans.
---
It's not essential in the same way that wearing shoes while walking outside isn't essential, but you'll have an easier and probably funner time if you do.
---
Is that what you use for selfies?
---
Hi, /u/i_leveled
---
I think they invited all the "bigger" content creators. Tips just happened to be one of them and (SURPRISE!) he's the most unreliable of the bunch.
---
I just don't see why modern WoW can't have these "narrative" quests they currently use, and fill the zones out with kill/collect quests as well? You were always given a more story-focused quest in BC to do alongside the side-stuff anyway, it just wasn't as explicit as it is now.
---
dont have much time, and do not want to get invested too much in the beta, if i had acces i would try to improve my levelig to lvl 12 route though, and see if the mountain skips etc. from/to the wetlands work
---
Being a Beta tester is a job, and right now, I have no time for additional work if I ain't getting paid for it. Gonna wait to release, and play for fun.
---
To make and test macros
---
Smartphone my dude
---
Actually no. It’s harder to buy my lesser magic wand on a fresh server.
---
Started as a NE Holy Priest day of release to pocket heal for my 2 friends and GF that were playing (I wanted to play a Undead Warlock but.. when the girl who is willing to sleep with you says she wants to play a NE Hunter, you play Alliance with her).   Stayed with that toon until this day.  Loved the feeling of walking around seeing people questing or in PvP and topping them off when they are low, knowing that seeing the bubble and full HP with a renew on them makes them smile after they thought for certain they'd be corpse walking just made my days.
---
However, this time I think I'm going to start a Undead Warlock to play for myself, I know I'll always have a Priest to go back to that I enjoy if the warlock doesn't scratch the itch.
---
I'm looking at combat swords for pve and hemo for pvp, since it became quite strong after the revamp. Damn, those respecs will hurt my wallet. Alternatively, I could use seal fate daggers, which was strong in both pve and pvp. In the end, I might roll whichever weapon drops. ;)
---
Same faction, same class, different race.
---
Considering how much of a POS the wireless Razer Naga was, I'm fine with a wired version.
---
My first char was night elf rogue,but now I play troll priest.
---
When I tried to cross the bridge between the Barrens and Durotar. After that I got teleported back to Crossroads. It was a classic loading screen.
---
You can fill up your bags to your hearts content farming! 
---
And earn a lot of loot - over time.
---
AVAST YE SWABS
---
Bengals, sorry man
---
Your bottleneck is going to be access to monsters.
---
Very rarely will you ever have enough mobs to utilize the 1.4x multiplier. You'll simply run out and have to wait 5-7mins for respawns.
---
There's a reason that people don't level in 5-man groups.
---
I feel like a dirty traitor, I played alliance all throughout vanilla, but I want a different experience this time around and I am going horde.
---
Well.... but no changes means that we'll have to have an unplayable week upon release AT LEAST. 
---
And I expect to get some free single day's of playtime like they used to give out back in the golden times x.x
---
I'm technically playing on my same account since 2004, but in BC my account was hacked and had to go through Blizzard to get it sorted, new email addy, new information attached.  So now my account says I started in BC not Vanilla.   It would suck if they did this as I'd probably be missing out.
---
your comment sounded worse tbh
---
Announcement on a non-working day.
---
do they get to sleep with the corporation too?
---
I'm not on the youtuber hate train like others, but his tweet was an obvious ploy for attention. He went to a "secret meeting", he then came back and tweeted "keep an eye on 24th of May", then deleted the tweet and specified in another tweet saying: "Looks like the event Im planning (thats what the date is focused on) might be delayed a few days".
---
Again.. "Looks like the event (IM PLANNING)". So if I were to guess it's just an event he's planning for his community in WoW or something.. hence clearly misleading people since everything about him is classic related, so obviously people will draw the conclusion that his tweet was about the classic BETA or major classic news.
---
If he lies about this for attention then there will be some shit coming his way from the community, not to mention from Blizzard since violating an NDA is not looked upon lightly. We'll see though.
---
He's not explaining raid strats or telling everyone how hard was Naxx in retail Classic. None of his videos need first-hand knowledge and when they do, he brings a guest with that knowledge. The best examples are class guides.
---
You don't have to be Vanilla veteran to report news, make quest chain guides and show dungeon strats. It's all there but mostly written, bad quality videos or p server experience.
---
Casual players can make good content too.
---
My vague memory is that it originally wasn't repeatable, but people kept asking to be able to do it again so it was made repeatable with no rewards just so people could have fun with it. At the time of course it was a unique change of mechanics that was fun as a one-off. Once they started turning up everywhere, the novelty wore off.
---
Not difficult at all. You have some CC and you’re a high damage dealer. You’ll also be competing with other melee for gear but I think that’s a lot of fun trying to negotiate and finesse other melee and the group to try and give you gear.
---
He's also the biggest one but I'm sure that's got nothing at all to do with it
---
As someone that plays both it does occasionally grind my gears that, at least on internet forums and your comment about 90% of people almost certainly being much more reasonable is surely on point, people rarely say 'x is good in classic' they say 'man retail is shit, im so glad i can do this in classic again'. If someone is attached to retail then there is the natural inclination to defend things and you end up dying on the tiniest of hills
---
Madseason and Frostadamus: GOOD
---
Tipsout and Alexsensual: BAD
---
Dang your right. That’s exactly why we need a beta. Case closed thanks👍🏻
---
I mean by the time you hit 60 you'll be in all blues and greens. Your first few epics will be so amazing and precious and everyone won't have those same pieces. I still remember running around after I hit 60 inspecting people in org - nobody had the same shit on - I wanted all of it.
---
I actually think 8.2 and classic will release very close together, my theory is that by doing so it will keep the initial classic servers stress down somewhat, if the "tourists" are playing 8.2 instead it might be easier to figure out the servers.
---
When you achive your goals of fat loot. Everyone Will notice
---
That's so wild. Imagine if the constellar in Ulduar had his way Northrend would be a desert too. Or would that have just blown up Azeroth?
---
You don't *need* it, but it can help you out better than other professions in a lot of PvP situations. Same if you're ranking. I know a TON of people that ranked to 12-14 on pservers that didn't have engineering.
---
As far as Classic content creators go? He's not.
---
This was the Dog Ancient!
---
duct taped*
---
Does anyone have any good videos of some nice break downs in rogue pvp? It seems like timing your abilities is absolutely everything and I would like to watch a video where I can see and hear what’s going on inside the players head.
---
Thank you!
---
Yeah, even looting becomes a clusterfuck if you have five players killing different mobs in a large spawn area.
---
You'll be running for at least 1/3 of what could be combat time.
---
They shouldn't give content creators that played on private servers special access in general. No offense but it creates a double stardard after they royally fucked preach gaming.
---
Is that the dragon from never ending story?
---
Do what a beta is there for. Play and look for bugs to report.
---
I'm not on a YT hate train either, really I don't want good, honest streamers to have their access limited once this has gotten out of hand and Blizzard has no choice but to just cut everyone off. I'd much rather they cut off a shitty one early.
---
Not sure that is bugged.  Defensive means the pet will attack anyone who damages you or lands some type of harmful ability.  In PVP you're constantly receiving some kind of damage or ability effect so the pet will charge off constantly.
---
They did, with the darkmoon arena and I still haven’t got those 12 trinkets to turn in the quest for the regular one
---
yeah seems too suggestive. after all, what else could it be other than beta?
---
&gt; "You play this game because you like the combat mechanics and how every class feels different? Here now you get to play with completely different mechanics than those you like, and they are identical for every class!"
---
Oh they fixed that by pruning every character into homogenization. Now you can play anything and you just have different animations and ranges!
---
Before anyone pounces me, I know that's not entirely true. It's called hyperbole.
---
I should have marked these Humor too, I'm sorry.
---
I thought you were insulting my female dwarf lol.   It's a pic if my monitor.  So bad pic.  I don't want it to look worse.
---
I forgot to mention he asked how long it would take to get max level.
---
I said “well playing 10 hours a week”
---
He cut me off saying what the hell thats a lot. (which I know he plays more than 10 hours a week, but when you don’t realize you’ve been playing all Saturday morning or Wednesday night with 5 hr session it seems like a lot)
---
After we got over the 10 hour a week deal, I told him like maybe 3-5 months 😅
---
I can only find evidence of this on private servers, but what would happen is that players would 24/7 farm devilsaurs for their leather, which is limited in supply, expensive, and needed for all physical DPS' preraid BiS.
---
The reason this worked so well on private PvP servers is that players would communicate cross-faction. So, if I'm a horde player trying to snipe a few devilsaurs from the horde side of the mafia, they would have their alliance friends/alts come kill me.
---
Well I guess I’m putting Twilight down for good since I found a way better love story
---
Play for about 2 hours and realise I’d rather wait for Classic release
---
That part too! Oh man I forgot the reputation aspect
---
i love it! let the meme war begin!
---
I always used to confuse dewbacks and kodos because I was a stupid little nerd when I was a kid.
---
One of the things I really liked about Thottbot over Wowhead is how simple and clean it was...like Classic.db is now.
---
Wow head is full of flashing adds and pictures and crap all over...it annoys me.
---
You don’t notice a difference. I actually bought that sound system November last year. Only system I could find that I could hook up my PlayStation and computer at the same time.
---
I am all for fun, but strictly speaking, does this break Rule 1? It is not about WoW:Classic anymore.
---
I love how MULTIPLE people call you out on your attitude and you hand wave it off and attack them.
---
While you are correct, i feel that it does not add to the discussion.
---
Just because there are 7 billion people in the world it does not mean they are all here. And it is probabilistically true that others on this subreddit feel like me, but "Is it just me or is x true" is a rethorical question - not a litteral one.
---
&gt;playing alliance 
---
loooooooooooooooool
---
That’s all behind me at the bar! I haven’t posted a picture of that due to no countertop installed yet.
---
It was just kind of neat to return the destructive favor onto the Legion like that. We hadn't done any mass damage stuff like that before I believe, so it was novel and fun. Take that, jerks!
---
Does always beg the question...why do we need heroes when {flying thing} is so damn powerful? Screw Demon Hunters, just send a few winged bats with a guy and some explosives!
---
I tried to find that and the Valley of Bones on my last playthrough but I couldn't find it. I'll have to look extra hard this time.
---
You should probably use this "PrintScreen" button on your keyboard then. Because it looks like you are deliberately trying to make the pic as shitty as possible.
---
On the other hand, I really want to know the release date and don't care about NDAs.
---
for some people even the smallest amount of perceived power over others is more important than anything else. it's sad
---
Can I use Reddit ony PC?
---
Engi is both for PVP though.
---
&gt; Then he found out I played horde and he played alliance.. suffice it to say, I put his number on a ton of spam lists and then burned my record of it just like Teldrassil.
---
FYFY further
---
Hilarious, people in NA say it's an EU thing and people in EU say it's an NA thing. The real answer is it's a weirdo thing. Only strange people call \[D\]ead\[M\]ines VC. Theres no V or C in the name so it makes literally no sense.
---
Awesome, thanks for this great response ajkp!
---
Who's bigger? I only follow a few channels and i assumed he was one of the biggest ones
---
That’s not how adults in relationships work
---
Yeah that makes sense. Thank you
---
I doubt that literally everything has been discussed. And there are plenty of new posts that i would say are better than memes. The reason people are not seeing these posts is because others are flooding the subreddit with memes, and memes are more easily accessible and thus get more upvotes.
---
If memes were banned on this subreddit (its not what i want, its just an example) then there would be discussion posts hitting the front page in droves.
---
Hey Zero, thanks a lot for this overview. Great content here, thanks!
---
Nope, I still like the same class archetypes I enjoyed back then. I still like priests, paladins and warlock. I still like prefer tanking or dpsing to healing. The only difference is that I decided to level a druid on a PS and had a blast, so now the list of my favourite archetypes includes 4 classes, not 3 :)
---
But we also didnt have a game to play yet 4 months ago, what changed?
---
Find new friends in the world then? That's literally what an MMO is about.
---
You're supposed to find new people and have fun with them, not just stick to your clique and get mad when they don't play the same way as you.
---
As far as pure sub count on Youtube? Kargoz and MadSeasonShow.
---
Both of which put out (in my opinion) higher quality videos that Tips does.
---
After reading and considering each response I have received here, I have decided to play as a Shaman. Thank you all for helping me come to this decision!
---
They probably would want to stress test it (assuming that they did not gather enough data during demo) I guess.
---
To be real, look at the "If you get invited to the beta, what will you be doing?" thread -  most people would really just do some bullshit like checking for animations and "which class/race fits me most, leveling test run etc." with zero contribution towards the game itself, unless they will report a bug that there is a 100x100 yard big hole in textures in front of them, since their knowledge is not good enough to see more subtle errors in the game.
---
Probably very few unique nerds would try to stage setups to check evidence of certain mechanic implementation gathered during original game (2004-2006 guides, videos) versus modern implementation of classic and at least try to be somewhat useful and report actually important bugs. But there are people already hired specially to do that, aka devs.
---
Noob!!
---
Night Elf’s about to streak!
---
NO SHOES
---
I'm a casual raider and I guarantee I'll be doing naxx. I have a full time job and a full time family so I might get 2hrs a day to play. That's pretty casual but I guarantee you I'll be doing naxx. Because I believe that I know there will be other casuals who will be doing naxx too.      
---
Causals have time restraints we are not bad players.
---
Oh FFS people, can we just put this to rest?  
---
 [https://www.strawpoll.me/17967436](https://www.strawpoll.me/17967436)
---
Hahaha so simple for a casual player huh? Think that’s my point! 😂👍
---
Yea...  no they don’t.
---
I hope they don't intend to use those two things together.
---
That’s hilarious
---
That isn't diremaul.
---
Yes, this was the type of answer I was looking for. Thank you. Solid info.
---
Add-ons!! To let makes fix their add-ons before launch 😊🤟
---
Prepare yourself for hand to hand combat.
---
Yeah thats the good stuff, we had 2 guys back in like 05/06 that stood in IF constantly. Cacknoob / Tankz. Still remeber their names 14 years later.  Chatting in trade. Chilling in their naxx gear. The entire server knew them
---
Do you keep yours somewhere else? It seems like the most optimal place. We've had 14 years of testing pitchfork placement on pservers so I feel like we know what we're doing by now.
---
No one said you had to be intelligent to own a Youtube channel.
---
Haha for real. This is definitely important. Good point
---
Why use two monitors when you can just alt tab on one?
---
The other day I started expecting "Release this summer!" to mean "Release in the last month of summer!"
---
Oh shit I didnt know it was 1k for it damn
---
Sure, I hear you. I too will be a causal player, due to same reasons, job, wife, kids. 
---
I don’t see casual players getting into Naxx till at least easily 3 yrs after classic is released.
---
retail pleb meme.
---
Until level 60 when all the warriors cheered as they smashed their way forward, unstoppable, with their blessing of freedom and full rage bars...
---
Because he's only in this for the money. He bullshits people for views, for example; he claimed he had a verified source that told him we were getting patch progression. At the start of that stream he told us he wasn't going to string us along and he was going to get "right to it." It took him over an hour of stalling, just to lie to us.
---
Of course he also deleted that video but anyone who's remembered his bullshit knows he does that. Just like how he deleted this tweet.
---
I kinda liked being a tank in certain scenarios like Ulduar's start, where there were choices of vehicles with "specs" and the like. That's pretty neat.
---
Spamming 1 on mobs on the ground while flying so they can't even fight back is the worst though. It's just an arbitrary number increment that requires to maybe use the mouse to click on the floor. Woo.
---
The problem is, a lot of people are frustrated for almost no reason. Blizzard said Classic would launch Summer of 2019. That's June 21 through almost the end of September. They didn't say it would release by the start of Summer 2019. Releasing in August/September is still 100% true and very likely.
---
This is also Classic we're talking about. The beta will not last long as they're not much to test other than server stability. It's incredibly likely from beta to launch will be a month or less. It's not going to be a long drawn out process.
---
Be patient, we'll be getting it soon.
---
Depends on what content will be available and how the beta is structured.
---
If there is instant 60 with gear vendors to test dungeons/raids then i will probably try and figure out how well my Oomkin/Eleshaman/Retpally will be doing in PvE.
---
An upgrade is an upgrade!!!!
---
why do you think it's for subs, don't think he made a vid about this. people have just screenshotted his comments in some chats
---
Haha yea if he's really going to play less than 10 hours a week he won't be feeling like a badass for a long time. But I suspect you're right about his understanding of in-game time, if he likes the game he'll wind up putting way more time in and if he doesn't he can just unsubscribe.
---
Haha also very important
---
Got em!
---
Thats fair I actually assumed they were smaller than tips. Tips doesn't seem like the type to sabotage his career though. We'll have to wait and see
---
yeah nah.
---
Arenas breed seasons. Seasons breed welfare gear. Welfare gear leads to the dark side.
---
I commend that and appreciate it. I wish I'd found the tanking lifestyle back in classic. Finding something you click with and speaks to you is a great thing.
---
I don't think I've ever seen a green post that didn't make me think, "This dude(tte) is a massive chode."
---
Honestly any one that hates on another persons hustle publicly can go die in a fire, even though I hate Towellie with a passion I don't generally try to go after him, I just don't watch him. Simple as that
---
This OP is toxic cancer that should vanish.
---
FYI Towellie hinted at Classic Beta coming out very soon aswell, so do your fucking research first so you don't look like a total retard.
---
Depends on character creation but I’d like to verify monster connections in the open world/dungeons. I personally think some of the observers I’ve played on have them wrong.
---
Are you saying that Blizzard should have the power to delete his YouTube account for violating an NDA?
---
Madseason and Frost are the best. Their content is great!
---
Incredibly incorrect. Most people who want to play classic want no changes.
---
I signed up but I played in BC... pretty sure ravencrest was a new pop server when I joined.
---
It's only easy if you make a concerted effort to build your friends list as you level up.  I was a rogue in vanilla, and most of my grouping was with just one other person.  I hit 60 with only like, 5 friends.
---
I spent MANY hours spamming trade chat "rogue LFG ANYTHING!"  Eventually I just started running lowbies through SM for fun.
---
The problem is, everyone had rogue friends or guildmates from leveling who they knew were good players, so they'd just always be grouping with them, not me :(
---
Kucy. Sef.
---
What made you change race?
---
Depends on what he signed if he did signed something
---
More than one answer applies.
---
oh boy just wait for op to accept  "A Dip in the Moonwell" quest. \*evil chuckle\*
---
Dude... its not like they just press a button and have access to classic wow.
---
They had to restructure the game, find old files, scavenge data from many different sources and put it all together etc. 
---
Literally do some research
---
That's a huge change, what prompted you to do so?
---
We got an announcement super late Friday night a couple weeks ago. So why not.
---
No, Engineering doesn't give You an edge in PVP. It merely gives You an opportunity to fight **on even grounds**.
---
Addons need to be tweaked.
---
No one needs to convince you, you exceptional individual.
---
They've repeatedly stated that they've needed our help in finding bugs, the blizzcon demo as an example. 100.000+ testers is better than 100 internally. They're moving to a new client which requires a lot of adjustment.
---
Server load. I doubt blizzard has a set plan of how many servers they need and with which sizes. A beta might give them some indication of how popular the game might be and if their estimated server power is enough etc.
---
power level a hunter to determine optimal quest paths.   
---
Try out macro/script commands to finalize multi-boxing macros for classic.
---
Funner
---
Towellie hinted at the same shit, fuck does any one on reddit ever research at all before spewing out bullshit?
---
Awk wise up man!! If Blizz cares then they'll never deal with him again. Stop trying to take some imaginary high road
---
I'm pretty well versed in the pve specs, but what are all the viable pvp specs and their strengths/weaknesses?
---
Well, you gotta remember they are 3 hours behind the east coast.
---
I don’t remember when they announced that, but I’m sure it was around a normal time for them.
---
I'm with you. As a Vanilla player sharding will ruin the experience and to me and many others won't be considered Classic WoW. If you give them an inch they will take a foot, meaning if they add sharding now you will see it again.
---
Typical alliance mentality. Of course you already play the game on easy mode, and are proud it. Kings honor? Kek. May your blades never dull.
---
Yeah this is precise haha. If I got a beta invite I would give it to someone who actually knows how to look for stuff like that because I’m not that smart haha
---
Okay, so the guild I signed up for I'm listed as a hunter, but there are already 3 of us, and there are currently 0 rogues. I may have an opportunity here to cement myself as a class officer in a loot guild council, and you all know what that means.
---
However, I'm really unsure if I want to play a rogue. Back in 2006+ when I played, I was a complete noob - it took me to Vael in BWL to realize poisons worked on bosses, and I always raided in a PvP spec with no PvE gear (no +hit and all that jazz).
---
So part of me wants to return to the game with the knowledge I have equipped now, but I do really enjoy the hunter combat and pvp, and look forward to working towards T2, doing bow quest, farming Mara / DM.
---
However I'm wondering if equipped with the knowledge I have now, if I'd enjoy rogue so much more. 
---
The parts that concern me are, I didn't really enjoy rogue PvP in battlegrounds. Any meaningful PvP, you get tab-deleted by any competent group. You're always running around with cooldowns on CD. They just felt weak.
---
While nuking and ganking people with CDs is fun, sort of, I always envied the Warriors as a melee class, and Hunters are the range class, in group PvP.
---
Thoughts?
---
Why do people keep shooping dogs into the images?
---
Okay so... let's say he broke his NDA, that means Blizz can fine him. They don't get to take away his freedom of speech and de-person him from Youtube. Blizzard doesn't own Youtube. They could request copystrikes and have Tips videos about blizz be taken down at most, but delete the channel? No such power exists, this is America
---
BiS alliance race for pvp?
---
More funner.

How much time can we expect the Beta to last before Release? A month? Two?
---
Nah yeah.
---
Oh nooo... _multiple people_ thinks I'm being a big meanie because I'm calling them out on their bullshit.
---
Unfortunately the facts don't change just because they make you upset.
---
Yes it is America

He's hated by elitists cause he issued some wrongful statements in passed videos.

Only circle jerking SJW's actually find him annoying and spew hate, the rest of the population get on with their lives.
---
No foot longs!
---
Nah yeah, engineering fills in a lot of utility gaps for a lot of classes, if you are even semi-competitive in pvp and not just dipping your toes in then engineering is essential.
---
When you hit max level what do you think you'll gravitate towards, tanking or dps?
---
You traitor, hope you quit fast.
---
Yeah sure. Pro tip for when you get out of high school, your employers will fire you for this kind of attitude.
---
It will go big then drop by about half then players will slowly start to trickle in from there the longer the servers run.

I think he’s just on an NDA and said too much

The planet would be wiped of all life if Algalon had not been convinced to let us live. When the halls of originations were used to defeat the thunder king it only unleashed a small fraction of its energy. It was designed by the keepers as a fail safe to reset the life on Azeroth if needed.

You don't need it, but from time to time you may run into a fight where you lose by the skin of your teeth, but with a well placed grenade or an engineering trinket you might've pulled out ahead.
---
I think that might have been his point bro. Why can't you look up arguments for/against by yourself if you're curious instead of arrogantly stating that people should try to convince you? It really clutters up the sub if everyone who isn't up to speed has to be individually told why something is a good idea.
---
the guy on the right is washing his hands right? he might have touched a gnome or something

Why 3 minutes? Use the NHL policy, 2 minutes in the box or 4 for double minor, sometimes a 5 minute major.

Did anyone else read this as "Vanilla Lootboxes"? I about came unglued in half a second. lol! &lt;3

That might be true but the good thing about classic is I have all the time I need without the threat of another expansion or servers being wiped.
---
‘Go play borderlands 2’
---
But high Quality, have an upvote
---
I really dont know how you determine essential. I made it to rank 8 on a private server with very casual hours and optimization without engineering. If you want to up your 1vs1 duel rating, yeah its essential. In group pvp it is not necessary. And Private servers most likely are more competetive and have less casual players than how many there will be in Classic.
---

The funner of the funnest
---
10 contractors hoping to be hired back testing something vs thousands of nerds with nothing but free time and passion on their hands meticulously stress-testing every single niche mechanic they happen to be curious about.
---
Gee I wonder which one is gonna yield better results.
---
Good job proving my point again! Very mature!
---
But if all the Alliance players quit, where will we get honor?
---
1) druids AFAIK have always had a bit of a cross faction love.  
---
2) you cannot roll both factions on PVP servers (note, this restriction doesnt exist now) so your current experience is not the Classic experience (at least for PVP servers. Which is how you should play).
---
The only reason I could see them needing a beta is to test server stability and starting zone phasing.
---
The good old cataclym reworked northern eastern kingdom quests. Playing plants vs zombies, riding a bat or on sylvanas horse. Those are sooooo bad and yet people think that reworked silverpine forest is so great.
---
Well played
---
Literally fuck off. I’m not trying to be arrogant I was just looking for information on why you guys think a beta is needed.
---
I think it depends on your intended build. But I know if you are going to utilize the combat sword spec, it's human 100%. The boost to sword weapon skill is really strong.
---
VAN CLEEFED HIS HEAD RIGHT OFF
---
I think everyone needs to chill out regarding the tips-hate. Dude is just passionate and if it's not for you, don't watch. I watch his videos very selectively, he has some great content, the class deep dives comes to mind.
---
That being said, I agree that if he broke some sort of NDA with blizzard it's not a good look. But I'd say let's wait before we have any more info about this. We have no idea what they discussed in this alleged meeting @Irvine. Blizzard might have given them some permissions to drop hints or whatever. Don't immediately jump on the hate-bandwagon when we have literally zero info. It's very much a witch-hunt based purely on speculation.
---
Word. Makes sense thank you
---
Atleast they take more effort to make than all the shiity screenshots with dogs added to them
---
Well yes I know how good permafrost is. I just never had any problem kiting witout it. and 6% frost dmg is kinda huge sence it effects all frostspells
---
this website needs to be pinned at the top of the sub
---
Thank you.
---
I think that is what is driving me too. Remembering the southshore pvp, ganking in stv, hilariously bad dungeon compositions because we didn't know any better. Trying to complete Deadmines with 3 rogues 1 warrior and a priest.
---
Most of the people watching twitch/youtube streams are children ages 8 and up. I'm not particularly sure why any grown man would watch it such drivel seriously.
---
Until we actually get a beta or full release there really isn't a whole lot else to post. We are pretty much just rehashing the same things over and over so this OC is at least new and interesting. Once the game is released I doubt we will see this anymore since we have actual in game content to share.
---
SPECS?!?
---
I upgraded my rig for Destiny 2 PC 2 years ago and it's completely overkill for WoW. But Classic at 1440p 144hz should be nice.
---
If you're casual and are just messing around in pvp then no, you don't need it. If you are mainly pvping with intent to rank or even to compete on a level footing you get engineering, if you you don't have it and the other guy does you're at a disadvantage.
---
That’s why it’s even worse. No.
---
If used porperly its one of the greatest utilitys for pvp. Just watch a mage like Vurtne and how he used engenering.
---
As a gamer, who the fuck cares? It isn’t as though blizzard is going to discontinue classic development as a spiteful punishment for possibly leaking the date when they will announce the release date. 
---
There is literally no downside from our perspective. Either he is right, and we will have confirmation on the date in question, or he isn’t and we don’t. Classic wow is not life or death, the plight of the Rohingya Muslims does not depend on accurate amateur games journalism.
---
So tips may not get invited again, y’all clearly don’t like him, so great—you win that settles that. But for a sub with an off the rails amount of meme generation begging for a release date, you guys seem real hostile to someone who appears to have inside knowledge and has taken a risk by sharing it.
---
&gt;Was trying to get an idea roughly how big the game world was.
---
See, I think that's a difference between vanilla and modern WoW. From a mechanic perspective, it was just a place with a convenient layout and no mobs to interrupt you. But players DID use it in a real sense. Player organized arena battles did happen, it was rare, but it was epic. Laying on to menus and queues and other things doesn't make it more real, it makes the whole thing more artificial.
---
Perhaps they will do some sort of PTR for beta, everyone with wow sub gets access with perhaps some keys for those without wow sub.
---
If I get access I will play it, mostly to see if I can find bugs and also to see if I want to play warrior, warlock or hunter on release.
---
Lap dogs! All of you!
---
Sap takes you out of stealth in vanilla unless you go down the sublety tree some what.
---
If it were a tactic by blizz to have him leak it, would you expect them to use a youtuber/streamer who everyone fully trusts and is very reliable with their sources? Or the one people are unsure of to add a shroud of mystery to leak. Any companies that purposefully leak information usually seem to make it seem accidental.
---
Cheers fellow Cincinnatian. Who dey!
---
i still remember feeling like hot shit for a few days in full 346 blue gear. never got the chance in wotlk because my parents didn't allow me to play long enough in the evening to properly attend raids.
---
Breaking a NDA does not seem to be an inconsequential thing. I'm not too versed in them, but my understanding is there can be serious legal jeopardy for doing so. You are entering a major IP contract with a company. You don't do this sort of thing, putting trust in people to keep business secrets close to the chest, only to just go "oh well" when they break it. You need to make your NDA meaningful by enforcing the remedies.
---
I’m really torn BW orc and undead right now. I played UD back in the day and he was ma boy but orc racials are absolutely killer. I’ll likely switch to orc this go as I am rolling a PvP server.
---
Why is it so important to you?  You cannot accurately time anything well enough for this to matter in any way.  50% of the time, you gouge the blink.  Okay, cool, but is that a GOOD thing?  Mage got unlucky is all.  I'd guess you're planning on playing a rogue, because no one else would care about it nearly as much.
---
Advocating for long spell batching periods would be like advocating for very high response time FPS, it removes high reaction time as an advantage.
---
Agree fully. Made a comment with similar sentiment. I really don't get it. Especially when we have no actual information regarding the situation and it's speculations and conspiracy theories at best.
---
Most of the people watching twitch/youtube streams are children ages 8 and up. Streamers shouldn't be given privileges for anything.
---
If you didn't like it back then, you won't like it now.
---
Lets be honest, is knowing that the poison works on bosses going to suddenly make this Class more appealing? I think not.
---
You really want to spend 160 hours leveling a Rogue and be Class leader, when everyone else has a blast as a Hunter?
---
I think not. Assigning Loot to people can't be that awesome.
---
I think you are going to regret the choice by what you are writing.
---
I just bought those same speakers a few days ago. What do you think of the sound quality so far?
---
Hmm I could but not everyone has time for searching the entire sub you dimwit. 
---
Maybe since you apparently have sooooo much time to look stuff up please fill me in Jimmy. 
---
It’s not arrogant. I was simply looking for why people think a beta would be good for the game. 
---
I didn’t think there should have been one but now I do. No thanks to you, but to other people’s actual reasons. 
---
And I think your cluttering up this sub with this bull shit comment. So please don’t do this again ✌🏼
---
I thought Rogues were supposed to be one of the best classes for singling out and dealing with casters?
---
&gt;get mad when they don't play the same way as you.
---
lol that's not what this is. This is just wow/mmos not being for me. If i'm going to find people to hang out with, it's going to be downtown or at a park or bar or something, not online. I've played video games my whole life, but i've never been in the habit of adding strangers. There's a couple exceptions but that's over the span of maybe 15 years. 
---
My favorite games are enjoyable even when I'm playing by myself but continue to be fun with others (soulsborne games/retro couch gaming. mordhau right now is pretty cool). WoW kind of crumbles as a game if you're like me and not looking to socialize with randoms.
---
Haha that's exactly why I play a tank.
---
Ha-Ha?
---
If what he posted is actually true... who gives a shit. Multi-tasking during GoT for the win. Anytime some bitches about Tips, it just comes off as sour grapes...
---
To be fair most of these nerds will just burn their free time and won't bother reporting anything. Still, it's free testing.
---
Oh geeez....Guess ill unsubscribe from him then.... I don't like misinformation

I hope many of my guildies get in and we just fool around and have fun

Did he correct those statements?

Thanks this is what I'm looking for!

Looking at Classic reddit posts, what else would someone be doing in the /r/classicwow???
---
Do you always talk like that?
---
"Be civil and respectful. Do not attack or harass other users; engage in hate-speech; or attempt to gate-keep discussion."
---
Has he posted a new video this week? Not seeing anything that would be related to this post.. the leaked beta ss vid is the only one of his that I’ve seen so idk that much about the guy
---
Wotlk was polished and generally the peak gameplay-wise, but as the other guy mentioned it was the beginning of the end, and assisted in destroying many of the things that we now desire from classic.
---
Easy dungeons, LFG tools, introducing multiple difficulty levels (barring Ulduar, which was amazingly executed - I'm talking about Trial/ICC) and pushing the whole streamlined questing structure that retail is used to now.
---
I'd actually be surprised if Wotlk was the favorite expansions of this subreddits users.
---
Yes that’s totally true. Late late late game it’ll balance out a bit. But they can single out casters very well. 
---
A fantastic mage will be able to do pretty well against a rogue if they use their blink perfectly.
---
Not sure, I don't watch him or follow him.
---
My friends and I call the Alliance AF's.
---
Yeah this makes sense for sure. Thanks.
---
What?! No Mini fridge? Amateur..../s
---
Ok but it'll still be hard to get to as Horde?
---
No your exceptional
---
Dude is passionate about the money and it shows. That's why people do not like him.
---
Yup true haha
---
I think people just want a heads up rather than blizzard just saying " Hey, we are releasing the game in 2 weeks time, enjoy!"  like 2-3 months notice like most games would be great.
---
This screenshot is dope. I’ve never seen a Fight Club type atmosphere in WoW. Just the mobs of newbs dueling each other in front of IF and Org.

Sweet setup, but oh boy you need to pick a better football team to cheer on....

Lol yes but the greatest extent of legal jeopardy is being fined for money. You can't go to jail for breaking a contract like that, also they can't delete your private youtube channels

Right next to a framed picture of their rank 14 vanilla character.
---
This one wins.
---
I remember going through it for the first time. It was so epic.
---
They are fine
---
A rogue planting a sap must always be ready to vanish even if he goes into the sub tree - even with those talent points invested still a 10% chance of breaking stealth. It def takes practice to reliably perform CC as a rogue.
---
I cant understand all of this dogs on pictures today, what are they about ?
---
Yeah but all the content is old, nothing really new so compared to other games this should be a breeze.
---
Why does every "..." feel like a stutter?   
---
Ask 3 questions?
---
1. Do you PVP? If yes, go to next question. If no, they're alliance carebears, or probably should be Holy Paladins. 
---
2. Do you roleplay? If no, go to the next question. If yes, they're alliance dWeebs, or should have rolled a fNElf.  
---
3. What content were you on prior to retail BC? If they say anything further than say ...twins..., then they \*are\* Alliance, because they are either alliance or lying alliance. 
---
FOR THE HORDE MUTHA FUKAS! XD

---
True.
---
I ate Hungarian, last week
---
Yeah, that’s the reason I can’t wait. I loved classic, I even enjoyed tBC and wrath a little, but hated that all the work was erased with an expansion. 
---
Looking forward to playing slow and steady and not racing to complete things. Can’t wait! 👍😀
---
Unfortunately the pserver data was inaccurate.
---
&gt;I can't imagine why anyone would think Blizzard asked him in particular to do this 
---
My money is on "they didn't and he's lying"
---
Nice rig man! All you’re missing now is a mini fridge 👌🏻

Frost is a great channel
---
Imagine being this petty. Go outside.

Hell, Engineering is great for *PvE*, let alone PvP. Any top-end raiding guild will want a large number of their users to have Engineering for Sappers and Battle Chickens, and as others have said in this thread, anyone serious in PvP is going to have it, so you're handicapping yourself by not evening the field. Classic PvP is a quintessential arms race, and leaving out Engineering means you're literally giving up bombs in that race.
---
You don't need to level Engineering while leveling, mind you. You can go, like, Herb+Min and save mats to quickly grind up 300 Eng at level 60 (like I'll probably be doing). But if you're serious about reaching higher PvP ranks and wanting to eke out every advantage in fights, Engineering is just too good to pass up.
---
Borderlands Collie
---
Mad for those OP racials thats why...
---
It will be a strange feeling knowing what's behind that portal now. Less anticipation and mystery for sure!
---
Why on earth do you feel you have an obligation to be convinced a beta is a good idea for a game you don’t work on?
---
1. This is true, Druids in vanilla have a certain camaraderie cross-faction. However I don't exclusively play druid.
---
2. This doesn't have any bearing on my point. I will be playing my druid on one server, and I will probably be rolling a horde on another. It will still be me at the keyboard as a member of each faction at different times, the fact that its on different servers is irrelevant if we are talking about faction "culture" overall. 
---
I'm perfectly willing to grant that some factions on any specific server might be more cancerous, but the discussion is about the factions in general.
---
Nothing he said or any date he has given is relevant.
---
Meh... DOWNVOTE
---
Best answer imo, they need to determine how many shards to make of the newbie zones. You can't just shard a server infinitely, else you'll shove too many people into Westfall and the Barrens and then need sharding there as well. At some point servers do need to fill up. A 2-week beta along with a survey of the players prior WoW and MMO experience could help them get actual numbers for the leveling speeds and retention rate of players to help them figure out how many shards are needed so we can end up with vanilla-like server populations and not a few overloaded servers and a pile of dead ones.
---
Hey at this point anything can happen

&gt;Ah, a chance to use this freshly sharpened blade.

---
They aren't employed by Blizzard in any way.
---
They're just "valuable" posters who get special forum privileges for "quality" posts (being good boys).
---
Similar to player moderators in Runescape.
---
Other than general guidelines, I seriously doubt Blizzard would feed direct PR commands to people who are not professionally associated with them in any way.
---
These guys just want to take Blizzard's side naturally, that's why they're greens in the first place.
---
You must be fun at parties.  80k people subbed here,  millions playing retail who will also have immediate access. Most people in retail who want to play classic care more about the vanilla class mechanics than anything else.
---
You made an enemy, only logical thing to do is make responses with parks and rec clips or more top dog posts.  GO!
---
Boom. That’s an answer right there. Thank you. I’m convinced.
---
Well beta is not gonna last forevery so they wouldn´t be able to test everything anyway - hence they would Need These contractors (or just normal employees) to test later stuff anyway.
---
Of course beta is for testing, Feedback and reporting bugs. But so is the demo and Alpha...
---
Since we already had demo and Alpha OP wanted to ask if a beta even was necessary. Do you understand my Point now Tazbomo? just trying to explain OP over here
---
So why is that topic locked? Finally something worth discussing or speculating about, now its back to the memes (this also goes for the datamining topics that got locked)

Still, being at a slight disadvantage doesnt mean its essential. You gain other advantages from other professions too. Hell, if you enter BG roided up with potions and carrying more in the bag, the disadvantage is basically gone.

None of the current addons for private servers will work in classic. They will have to be remade.

They get a sub no matter what you play, and the numbers are easy to spin favorably towards investors - even if no one plays retail.
---
Out of the loop: What is this golden retriever meme?
---
Merriam-Webster and I quote
---
“Fun is a word which many people find does not live up to its definition, especially when it is used as an adjective (meaning “full of fun” or “amusing, enjoyable, pleasant”). In fact, there is a sizable portion of the English-speaking world which does not consider fun to be a proper adjective at all; these people feel that it is only a noun, which is why you sometimes hear that you should write “it was so much fun,” rather than “it was so fun.” It thereby stands to reason that if fun is not an adjective, it should not be used in the comparative and superlative forms of funner and funnest.”
---
I feel attacked
---
Reminds me of guard towers in WC3.  Similar models yeah?
---
I mean I am too, a lot. I doubt however he thought that quitting his regular job to become a classic content creator would bring in more money, maybe just enough to live on along with his spouse's income. To me there's definitely a world where being passionate about money and classic can coexist. I don't expect people to create content for me to consume without them caring about their economy, especially when it's maybe their only income.
---
It has to be whichever you prefer in your heart of hearts, not what is better in some PvP matchups. If you don't love orc, you have to stick with it for 60 levels and then raiding WISHING you were playing undead. That's sad :(
---
trying to be a class officer for a class you've never seriously played purely to vote yourself for loot? pretty good idea my guy; i can't see how that affects the other 39 people you plan to play with at all

„Summer, so already in Jun...nah, September probably.“
---
You are going blind ( addons wise ) at launch
---
P&amp;R always was, and always will be better than the office.
---
I've seen a fair share of comments like that from back in the past and of course I know of the wall of no.   
---
My question is: Why were people so angry towards people who wanted vanilla back?
---
What will your team be?
---
Yes, it is quite literally essential for some classes and very useful for most other classes.
---
For instance playing a hunter without Goblin helm and frost/fire/shadow reflector is a waste of time against mages, warlocks and priests; as those 3 classes can destroy the hunter with spells alone (engineering by itself won't help the hunter if he has bad positioning).
---
Having grenades to interrupt poly as a warrior is also better than nothing considering warrs can't trinket out of poly, and so on.
---
In short, high level engineering is one of the key components of not being trash in Vanilla pvp.
---
Combat PvP ??
---
Guessing the mods want to stay in Blizzard's good-graces, so they squelch leaks, data-mining, that sort of thing. I get it...but at the same time, reddit is supposed to be a bit looser than the Blizzard Forums...

Towellie is more of an asshole than Tips is, so I'm really not surprised he's done it too.

Can you link me to your guys discord or share me the spreadsheet your talking about. Would live to get more in depth knowledge of spreiest
---
wasnt it green?
---
The original Battle Royale?
---
TBC started these type of quests and I liked it because it adds variety. If every other quest was like this I would be annoyed but it isn't the case.
---
It really depends on what you value more in certain matchups. For example, gnome has a 1min cd escape from snares, which is extremely good against arguably your most annoying matchups (mages, druids, and hunters, but it's also really strong against hamstring/crippling as well, and anyone with the engineering net).
---
Then you have dwarf, which is really strong (prob bis) against other rogues (bleed and poison removal for blind), hunters (poison removal for clean restealth), and bleeds (also devouring plague). However, it is on a 3min cd. So like in theory if you're fighting another rogue without prep, then you should be able to negate every blind thrown your way, which is pretty big. So if you value rogue vs rogue, then dwarf it is. I would say dwarf might be bis in the world, since it gives you more opportunities to get clean restealths and to get away.
---
But then you could make the case for human, since the opener is one of the biggest factors for rogue vs rogue, but perception isn't really realistic unless you're in a flag room or at a world pvp choke point (BRM), or dueling (then people will just prevanish).
---
The other races really aren't as strong as dwarf/gnome in regards to pvp.
---
I think it was green after TBC came out
---
Doesn't really help in pvp.
---
I was never hardcore pvp, max rank was 10 in vanilla, so I can't speak to its necessity for the serious rankers, but ultimately I found engineering nice but not necessary. Many engineering items are on very long cool downs so make for great youtube vids but don't really effect your random pvp, many of them require you to equip out of combat and then wait for the cool down so are less than stellar if you're not able to prep for a fight. Which then really comes down to iron grenade, which is always awesome, but you could also just being using some ability of your class toolkit as well.
---
I think much of the benefit depends on your class. Engineering is awesome for paladins, since the grenade stun gives them both another way to trigger a big JoC and gives them a way to close, both serious gaps in their toolkit. Warriors also benefited from the ranged spell interrupt and stun to help them close fights. 
---
By comparison, when pvpling on a warlock or shaman, I was pretty much spamming skills on GCD as-is and still probably wasn't playing the classes to their full potential, so the last thing I felt the need for was more buttons to push.
---
I get where you're coming from, but even if they did give you 2-3 months notice.. That's July - August. So they still have the ability to do so.

By the time they release classic I wont even be playing because Ill be busy watching my patriots get to another superbowl.

Greens interact with Blizzard's community team. Here's an interview with one: www.engadget.com/amp/2012/02/09/behind-the-scenes-with-a-blizzard-forums-mvp-green/

I decided to put a bit more effort into this, and wrote an even more in-depth look at my wow history, with some detail.

Best speakers I have ever bought for the price. The subwoofer is great as well.
---
Google the word. You'll find that almost every result and dictionary says that it's acceptable, though some say that it's informal.
---
Besides, are you really willing to accept that *fun* is not an adjective?  That is, frankly, the realm of stodgy traditionalists.
---
I'd like to have one in every state.

&gt; WoW kind of crumbles as a game if you're like me and not looking to socialize with randoms 
---
Yes, that also makes me wonder why you're making a complaint about a lack of socialization while refusing to leave your comfort zone and socialize with people not in your clique.
---
WoW isn't a singleplayer game, and I have no idea what you're actually complaining about.
---
Let me teach you something, if you talk like that to strangers at parties you wont be the one having fun. 
---
I see a lot of posts of people who wont even touch the game if sharding is in it. Because being a long time blizzard gamer they'll enable it again at some point.
---
I mentioned demo because it's a direct evidence Classic most likely needs testing. That was the best product they could give us after about 2 years of development. In my opinion, it felt rushed and many major bugs were reported. Mostly related to classes. 
---
On top of that, you got the launch issues. The best way to find out which system would be the best (sharding, dynamic spawns, etc.) is by doing stress tests and see how each option feels from the developer and player perspective.

It's not that easy, but ok.
---
I just assume September 20 (last day of summer) until I hear otherwise. If it's anything earlier I get to be pleasantly surprised
---
I got pranked as well
---
I wasn't going to pounce on you until you said "I know that's not entirely true."  Because it is.
---
if there gonna be beta, be sure there gonna be addons at launch. not all but still. as it gives addons creators time to adapt their addons for the classic client.
---
if you are looking for some easy going enviroment you wont play it for long anyways.
---
My theory is that you're so self-absorbed you default to asking obvious questions you already know the answer to instead of taking 2 seconds to google it to confirm, whether it's for attention or validation I have no idea. But your comment seems to confirm my suspicion.
---
Because I mean, really, if you look at the answers in this thread, they're not something you couldn't have figured out on your own if you bothered to have a ponder for more than 2 seconds.

It has nothing to do with time gating or EU. Deadmines was the first "hard" content in the game. We called it DM in 2004, and it'll be DM in 2019.

Weird flex, but OK.

idk why we're talking about this, every subreddit has it's own rules so does /r/classicwow , the mods are going easy on you and i get it, it's fun and all.

Perplexity's videos are pretty nice, but they're edited in a way that it's kind of hard to see what's going on a lot of the time. He puts text on screen explaining things though.
---
Make sure you have an energy ticker, and just duel all day, especially against classes that you think are difficult, so you can get used to literally "predicting" when they will use abilities like blink, deathcoil, scatter shots, etc., then counter them with engineering, gouge, vanish, or w/e.
---
Honestly, I'm a Paladin at heart and I'll definitely play Alliance but I think I'll go with Warlock. Maybe once I've gotten to 60 and got the time to farm up some gold I'll go back to leveling a Paladin. Maybe I'll be lucky enough to find my way into a few raids and stick with my lock. I always liked locks anyway but I hate their retail version because separating the class into three specs probably made it suffer too much.
---
Played in two different servers for the whole of vanilla and TBC (quit after) and was very disappointed not to see a single friend I recognised on there. Considering I was in two top end raiding guilds thought I'd see some people returning. Signed up! Hopeful to bump into some people I remember.
---
I'm going to just focus on leveling up to around 20-25 I think. I've done it on some those filthy servers as practice but I really want to see the difference between leveling on those and leveling in what we're actually getting come July / August. 
---
I personally think that the game is going to be in pretty good shape when beta gets here if we even get a open beta. Looking back at the demo and seeing everything wrong with it, there werent THAT many things wrong with it. Sure there were a few big ones that people saw right off the bat but again there wasn't a terrible amount of things wrong. Quests worked just fine, killing mobs worked just fine, and drop rates seemed fine.

It's another game that will be released Soon™.  Really upset that Blizzard still is so slow to release titles.  I don't understand what the merger with Activision really acquired for both companies besides conglomerating them into one launcher.
---
I agree, but it's not like they're building an entire new game from the ground up. They already have everything pre established. Comparing it to the development of Anthem is a bit too much imo.

Most of them, sure, but there are some people that are genuinely willing to TEST things, whether its for their own personal curiosity or a strive for the game to be the best it can be. Those people may not necessarily be youtubers, or people who Blizz would be aware of in general. So having an open beta to catch all of those mega-nerds makes the most sense.
---
True. And I don't care if a texture in one part of the world is a little off lol, I just want to play the game.

Same. Male orcs are really bulky for rogues (I love them as warriors) but I do want that racial.

&gt;making a complaint
---
&gt;complaining
---
I didn't think I ever complained? Maybe you took it that way... Is saying that I don't like creamer in my coffee a complaint? 
---
All I said was I like playing games with my friends and certain mechanics of this game get in the way of that. As such, it's not for me. That's much different than a complaint. If I were actually complaining, I would be suggesting changes to the game. I'm completely fine with wow classic being made as is.

Hello,
---
**About me**: I am looking to get back into MMOs, as vanilla was a huge part of my childhood. I was in high school when this was current. Fast forward 12-15 years, I am 30 with wife and baby….couldn’t be happier. I enjoy my games but nothing has hooked me like WoW did. Overall, I am nice guy looking for other nice players. 
---
**Goal**: I want to experience that magic they called Vanilla. I will be making a mage and focus on PvE content. 
---
**What I am looking for**: A guild that understands that I will be late to raids and doesn’t mind that I am not a core member. I will only be able to play on weekdays after 10 EST(usually) until 12EST.  In terms of gear, I will never take any BIS over my fellow mage members from a raid. Dungeons, we can duke it out J
---
**Experience**: I was part of a guild that transferred to another server to open up AQ. Amazing experience. We ended up raiding into Naxx. I believe I hit rank 10 or 11 in PvP. At one point, I understood my class.
---
Your friend sounds like the type of person who would have no issues paying for microtransactions to get "sick gear."  All about the instant gratification...
---
technily, summer is the 21st of june. So it is in MORE than a month. You guys are too much overhyped
---
I just spent $2000 on just a desk, monitors and peripherals for classic. I'm getting old so I got a motorized standing desk so I don't die from 12 hour session.
---
Same here with my blood dk. I know the feeling.
---
Clearly I didn’t know the answer Jim dog. I love playing games but I don’t know all the testing that needs to go into making them. 
---
Yeah cool deal I could have googled it but I didn’t. I posted on reddit looking for some help by people who I know care about this game and know about this game. 
---
The funny thing is that you somehow took offense to my title thinking I’m sitting over here like “I know there doesn’t need to be a beta, let’s see why these people are wrong”. Which is the opposite of how I meant it. 
---
So how about you stop wasting your time and mine by telling me I should know an answer I don’t and pointlessly posting on my thread.
---
&gt; No, classicdb has been around for a lot longer than Classic Wowhead
---
ClassicDB has only been around since January 2018 and Classic Wowhead is just Wowhad and Wowhead has been around forever. Classic Wowhead is just a limited collection of Wowhead's data from 1.12/1.13 patch that will be the ones we see in Classic WoW. In addition, they pulled in all their own years old comments (but again, only pulling the appropriate patches comments - ClassicDB has comments from patches waaayyy beyond Vanilla that again, were stolen from Wowhead). And Wowhead also has old Thottobott and Allakahazam comments.
---
I have been wondering this for days now.
---
I also came here to say that summer is in *over* a month.
---
So very true, however there are some people on the flip side of the coin.   People in their College/University time that played a bit and loved it but didn't have the serious free time that now as adults have more disposable income and free time available.   Or people like myself who was in their 30's when I logged in the day after release that now can easily spend 10 hours a day in Azeroth since I have no wife or kids to worry about.
---
I wonder what the original plan was for the gurubashi arena
---
Sunset yourself.
---
Oh yeah by better dps weapon i meant something with great stats. I just wondered if the buff went away on unequip.
---
Either way that sounds aids af. Id farm it for specific boss kills on progression that requires lots of dps but not for 100%uptime on every boss.
---
lol is this a real thing? I'm genuinely curious
---
Educate yourself.
---
Fellow Hungarian here dude. Used to play on Bloodscalp.
---
Anyone play a Rogue on 1.12 private servers recently? Do you have any regrets playing the class considering the higher level of skill and knowledge that modern players have? Wish you picked a warrior?
---
I always wanted a Rogue but 1.12 classic seems like one of the worst times to be one - no cloak of shadows, plate absolutely destroys your damage, weak in BGs, other classes got major buffs compared to early Vanilla. :/
---
Jarvis desk. It's pretty much amazing.
---
There will still be a large % of people that didn’t even make it to 60. Here on a sub devoted to a game that’s not even out yet, we are probably more hardcore minded. But we’re also absolutely in the minority. How was their post arrogant?
---
This made me laugh harder than it should’ve
---
Or roll am undead dark ranger and be both.
---
Maybe he's doing some guerilla marketing for why you should slap your kids when they're being annoying.
---
The article itself further elaborates on what I was saying.
---
They're not officially representing Blizzard, and their "direct line of communication" is likely more akin to something like 4chan janitors and other forums' versions of valuable posters, allowing them to help do the grunt work of spotting rulebreakers and reporting it to CMs/GMs.
---
Feeding uninvolved, uncommitted, unpaid parties with direct PR instructions would be stupid, as everything can leak with a moment's notice.
---
So this trailer is now almost as old as you were back then.
---
I know Stormscale EU had some big 5v5 tournaments with PvP guilds like Warders and Mannel participating.
---
How hard is it for rogues to find a spot and be effective in premades?
---
And not clearing everything is fine. Its kind of cool to always have something just out of reach that you can work towards.
---
Yeah both are from the Gamestar, one was the head of the video department and the other one the editor in chief. It's a pretty professional and well informed podcast project with lots of guests from the gaming industry
---
Sounds like the duel arena in Old school runescape
---
Soft keyboard is inefficient
---
What things ?
---
Damn, I didn't realize it was geofenced.
---
Last week I saw a guy in this subreddit link a travel website as a source to prove that june was considered summer. Everything has been discussed, in enough detail to make you sick.
---
So the mugambala?
---
Are we seriously praising fetch quests right now..?
---
Similar, but no one can see you fight there.
---
Not as much as engineering, as I said engineering fills gaps in many classes abilities, if you are serious about pvp you need engineering, you might not even be accepted to some pre-mades without it.
---
I really hope that blizzard will increase the mob spawn rates for the first few weeks, because it's gonna be swarmed. But o well I guess that's just another challenge if they don't :)
---
Feral tanks don't need to farm anywhere near as many pummelers as Feral DPS, as you only really need them for certain fights where high threat per second is essential, so that's a better option for people with less time. They still get to switch in to cat form and DPS on lots of the fights too, so you can still do power shifting with the wolfshead helm and have a pretty active rotation/playstyle.
---
It was a stand alone app with a map of the world and you could enter the name of an item or of a mob and it would show you on the map where you could find them
---
Decisions!!!! Yarrrrrrr
---
I will be leveling a warrior. The class I plan on playing and pre plotting my leveling route to max level while giving as much feed back as I can.
---
It'd be great if they made a trailer like this, with better resolution.
---
Yeah he hasn’t played retail. Or any form of wow. But he has this itch to play an mmorpg. He wants to play Star Wars which I played up until lv 23. The pace/combat of the game didn’t feel good to me
---
Because everyone is an engineer?
---
Right!!?
---
At this point I think they are just going to announce it a month or so in advance. Internal and friends and family is likely enough for beta testers, there wont be some huge beta for thousands of people to join.
---
Listen, I don't care about what you have to say at this point so I'm not gonna adress it. I just wanna say I think you have the weirdest fucking insults I've ever seen.
---
First you called me dimwitted, which is ironic considering the barely coherent mess you just typed out. Then you called me "Jimmy", then "Jim dog". I don't know why you're fixated with that name but I can tell you I'm 100% certain my name isn't Jim.
---
Keep on being weird man, it's doing you favors.
---
Interesting. That takes a lot of patience.
---
This is the correct answer
---
It is 100% absolutely not needed. Tons of good players wreck in PvP if they are skilled
---
but every so often there will be that close fight you could've won if you had engi
---
You probably see those posts here. If they wont touch it because of sharding, good riddance.
---
By blood yes, but location no lol
---
.....And I said, I don't care if they don't give me a head start either, because I told, I told J. Allen Brack that if they hint the release date one more time, then, then I'm, I'm going to a PServer, I'm going to just leave. And, and I told Allen Adham too, because they've hinted at dates four times already on reddit, and I planned to  use my summer vacation to be over by the park, and I could see the squirrels, and they were merry, but then, they switched tranforming me from the Swingline to the Boston stapler, but I kept the Swingline stapler look because it didn't keybind up as much, and I kept the staple ammo for the Swingline stapler look and it's not okay because if they take my stapler look then I'll set the Blizzard HQ building on fire...
---
I enjoy these, actually. They break up the gameplay a bit with some satisfying "destroy everything like an op badass" gameplay. But that's just me.
---
Excuse you, This is the Vanilla horde. Not that BFA Trash.
---
done
---
So basically a PvP version of the Brawler's Guild arena?
---
Sweet thanks. Please don’t.
---
Some say weird I say creative. Well clearly it’s because your a Jim. If you don’t know what that means, well that proves even more so your Jimness. 
---
Actually let me tell you that I’m 110% sure your name is Jim.
---
Somewhere around there, yeah.
---
I'm not against female characters but the female orc rogues don't really do it for me either. I'm currently leaning male orc at the moment.
---
Yeah, sadly. Only two horde folks registered. Nazgrel was a tbc-launch realm, right?
---
Noice
---
How much of a boost do Night Elfs get to their stealth?
---
Fair enough. I'm looking forward to the grind, again, but work 60hrs a week and have three kids. It'll be awhile before I hit 60 haha.
---
Anyone who plays WoW in 2019 with one screen is crazy. Back in the day we had to log out of minimize screens to shit talk on the forums. Best believe I’m going to have movies, Reddit, classicdb, and pornography quadrawindowed on my right screen with the glorious Druid action on the left.
---
I think blizzard would be happy to build the hype by allowing it to be streamed
---
sweet
---
Hopefully there's a bar tab!
---
And not having engineering is not slight but gamebreakingly at a disadvantage. 
---
Two equally high skilled players compete: 99 out of 100 duels with engineering available will go to the iron nade, rocket boots, rocket helm, frost/shadow/fire reflector using engineer. 
---
There really is no contest. 
---
Each and every other profession can be easily outsourced. Pay some paladin or mage 250g and he can powerlevel your alt to 60 in 4hours.
---
it's illlegaaaaaaaaal
---
shut up you young bastard. I'm 31, I'm a vibrant, young, the youngest of men, and I've been listening to earnings calls for 5 years because its the only true source of info.  It's either that, or listen to everyone else's *breakdown* of the earnings call.
---
you self identified old folk sicken me and I can't wait to eviscerate you in-game

But as a fellow Classic fan, love you brutha &lt;3

Nice to see another bearcat fan around! Looks good!

im hungry
---
We have a third bedroom in the house where I have an office. Anyway, it's pleasant in here. It has a window to the back yard, which has  lots of trees, sun, and bird noises. The occasional bear, lol. A bathroom and kitchen are close enough! This is far from my setup years ago when I first played vanilla and shared a common room with two other very loud people also playing it. Also back then I had hardly any memory on my computer, and the loading screens were so slow at times.
---
 [https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Jim](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Jim) 
---
&gt; 1. Noun (Jim/[**Jims**](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Jims)) : An individual of any age (but often a senior citizen) who uses technology and social media in an awkward and unfamiliar manner. 
---
If this is what you mean it's not really applicable to anyone in this thread.
---
Was a warrior in vanilla. Will now be a mage, I’ve played off and on up to retail and have never rolled a mage. New start, a brand new experience in almost totality. Never played on private servers and don’t remember much about vanilla so I’m very excited.
---
ya but *what class should i play*?!
---
Not server shut down, its in case of unforseen bugs or servers crashing because of their complete ineptitude when it comes to anticipating server loads during launches.    Releasing a game on a Friday means they have to keep staff on the clock to deal with these over the weekend, which is costly, this is why most games patch early in the week.  Staff are already on the clock.
---
Are you sure?
---
- Single dude
---
Nope not what I mean.
---
That’s funny though. 
---
It’s fine man you don’t know need to know what it means, but If you have a name tag for work I’d suggest you change it to Jim as soon as you can.
---
I came here to downvote the first one to say that summer starts on June 21. Thank you.
---
Lmfao. You don't even know when to use "your" or "you're" and you're talking about education you massive brainlet.
---
 Many of these modifications are implemented in order to compensate for some of the disadvantages.
---
* Attendance policy. E.g., a person with low attendance (e.g. less than 40%) can never outbid someone with higher attendance, regardless of list position. This allows for more flexibility in "rewarding" attendance and punctuality.
---
* Resist gear is suicide-free. Often, this will be administered by a [Loot Council](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Loot_Council).
---
* Separate lists for class-specific vs. cross class items. Running class-specific items such as set items or the BWL class trinkets on their own list allows players to build their sets without sacrificing position for valuable cross-class items. Also, it removes imbalances caused by different class populations.
---
* Separate lists for separate instances. This allows players to fill out gear from "lower" instances without sacrificing position for loot in more-valuable instances. This allows new players that may still need lots of loot from the lower instances to gear up there without sacrificing their position for loot in the higher instances. Sometimes, guilds may only allow players to be added to the list for the higher instances after they have been with the guild for a while and/or achieved a certain level of gear from the lower instances as well. This modification also allows for using a different loot type in different instances.
---
* Separate lists for different types of loot. A good rule of thumb is that if players are passing on an entire type of loot (such as AQ20 books) in order to hold out for better drops, it is time to split that type of loot to its own list. Note that this mitigates the disadvantage related to minor upgrades, by allowing players to take loot they need without feeling they have to "camp."
---
Thanks for the feedback on that! I was having some issues with Dark Souls 3 but I'm thinking it was just a balance issue between system, game, and speaker volume.
---
True! I don‘t think he‘d have fun with Classic at all, just because of a false set of expectations.
---
I have yet to see a post where someone said they wouldn’t play without sharding. So what’s the point in adding it according to the consumer base? 
---
Just trying to help, you sounded like you needed a hand.
---
The one thing I'll say: going from Gnome straight to Tauren will make you feel like you're not running "fast enough." It's a big change in how the most basic of movement feels going from one extreme to the other.
---
Above all else, have fun! But maybe experiment with some medium-height races before making the jump or it'll feel really awkward.
---
I'm excited to watch. I hate PvP and suck terribly at it. Watching people murder each other will be a blast though.
---
Probably refresh myself on quests in the first two zones and think about my leveling build and professions more. 
---
Also since I'll be a nelf, I might time how long it takes to get over to westfall. I kinda want to do deadmines, but it's so far from the main nelf leveling paths that I was thinking of skipping until doing my first alt which will probably be human.
---
Also since rolling healer, maybe work on mousebinds. By time I started healing back in the day, Clique mod existed so I've never set it up another way. Also I'm a software dev, I may pull the Clique source code and see if I can mod it to work in case the dev owner doesn't plan to release it for classic themselves. I have no wow mod experience though.
---
10k online was the funnest thing ever
---
You know, they don't really run out of mana in classic either, compared to other healers.
---
Can't remember as it was so long ago but I'm pretty sure TBC is when they made sub decent. I played primarily rogue in vanilla and the only time I went deep sub was either to troll, or to try various builds after I was so geared out that I had the option to do so, and the drop in damage was enough to make me never want to play sub during that time. There were a few weapons that made a hemo build relatively good, like claw of the black Drake and such, but even still it was pretty bad.
---
 The fact that raid bosses can only have a set amount of debuffs on them means that a hemo rogue would actually be worse in raid performance for the entire group made them nearly unplayable too.
---
Not difficult at all. Especially in AB they are expected to ninja flags and the suchlike. They're also pretty bread and butter because they're one of the stronger classes in pvp. You can normally expect to see up to 5 rogues in a premade (AB). As for WSG, they're as viable as anything else and make for good EFC scouts. And you always need a few rogues for ninjaing bases in A/V.
---
Apply crippling poison and you win.
---
Well you're right, you certainly are creative. If by creative you mean you make up words.
---
You're probably one of the only who played beta, so yeah.
---
Questionable business decisions and a loss of quality in their games. This is what Blizzard acquired since they merged.
---
I remember very early on, on Shadowmoon, you would have trusted gnome players in IF and you would roll 1-100 for certain numbers and played odds. I remember doing it to gamble for gold for a mount... and losing.
---
if you enter BG roided up with potions carrying engineering in your bag, the disadvantage is totally gone, and you now have an advantage. who would you rather invite to your group? someone who cares enough to spec into what's good, or "muh fantasy"?
---
I didn't play a ton of vanilla WoW. I was 21 and busy finishing up school. Prior to WoW i was replaying a lot of Baulder's Gate 1 and 2. My favorite character was my Dwarf Fighter/Cleric. So, when WoW came out i created a Dwarf Paladin as an homage. I didn't play a ton, but Dun Morogh will always have a special place in my heart. Some friends got into City of Heroes, and collectively we just chose that game over WoW.     
---
CoH/CoV deteriorated over the next few years and I picked up WoW again in late Wrath. That's when i was hooked. I tried to re-discover my Dwarf Pally, but again... i acquiesced to some IRL friends. They played Horde and i wasn't into Blood Elves. I went with a Tauren Druid and that was it. I was a Druid from that point, until now. I rarely play these days. I'm in my mid-30s and and my wife and i are expecting our first kid!   
---
In the past 10 or so years i've grown more attached to my Druid than any gaming character, ever. While i will not have the time to go full no-life into Classic; i am beyond excited to experience the good, bad, and ugly of a Vanilla Druid. At worst, my goals are to be a good dungeon bro and heal/tank 5man content. I'll reassess the raiding options, later. For now, that's 100% a-ok with me!
---
Oh I do know how to use them Jimmy. You just literally typed Lmfao and your talking to me about grammar. 
---
Please.
---
I like you
---
Is it the opposite of vegetarian?
---
&gt; I’m still disappointed they haven’t made any use of it in a real sense. 
---
Brawler's Guild.
---
It was a very unique quest and I enjoyed it. However it's not a unique quest anymore and I find it much more tedious than killing mobs. Although that is just mindless and tedious now too without any issues. I love how doing quests actually felt like quests a lot of the time. Like "shit I have to eat and drink up after a fight here and this farm is filled with these, no wonder they need help killing them and grabbing these sacks whilst I do it"
---
One guild I remember using the SK ruleset got round this by freezing people's positions who didn't attend the raid.
---
Thus if you were 5th in line and didn't attend, you'd stay 5th in line. Anyone who suicided for an item obviously went to the bottom, but rather than the non-attending 5th place player moving to 4th place, the attending 6th place player moved to 4th place instead.
---
Basically you only move towards the top of the list during raids you attend.
---
Jim is a made up word?
---
I hate your post but I'd love to know where you found that version of the hunter symbol, looks crisp.
---
Summer is in a month and 11 days, so technically more than a month :)
---
PvE seal fate is a thing, but only once you get aq40+ gear. Until then it's a solid 20% lower than combat swords
---
Also PvE sealfate is definitely less shitty than swords for pvp, but still pretty bad
---
Really glad you guys reworked the site, the previous version was...remarkable in how slow it was, haha.
---
the best loots rules are mature player understanding that the process of gearin up is slow
---
Welcome to the horde!  The refreshments are in the break room.
---
I wasn't aware that we had a confirmation on things like walljumping. Does this include common jumps in battlegrounds? Do you have a source for me to go through?
---
I should learn to read. Missed the PvP part, I apologize.
---
But if you plan to PvE at all it's significant enough to still warrant consideration!
---
I like the idea.
---
Can I ask why you're not a fan of SK?
---
Everyone serious in pvp (and really serious in pve).
---
classic can play on a toaster
---
1v1 it will give you an advantage, in larger group situations it becomes less of an issue, but ultimately it isn't an I Win button. A good player without Engineering will beat a bad player with it.
---
Fuck the plebs, for the horde
---

---
You know, on certain servers the grind to r14 was such a tall task that players had to form coalitions and take turns for the title, often with cross-faction agreements between the most dominant groups.
---
Your idea right here would be a pretty cool way to decide who'd be the next HWL/GM as a prize for winning. Imagine being a random spectator watching the servers top PvPers duke it out in Gurubashi on a Saturday night!
---
I will have my IPAD ready
---
I think this is a great plan! I’m just switching up my class, race, and role. I hope you have lots of fun
---
1 monitor?? bruv...come on
---
If you open when he is in caster/cat form you can kill a druid in a stunlock. If he trinkets stun you can blind and start over. 
---
If a druid gets the opener on a rogue and kite while keeping ff and dots up, the rogue is 100% dead. It’s all about the opener in rogues vs. druids.
---
Your set up looks so nice. With classic nearing and sick of my cramped room I decided to try attaching a computer desk to the wall and it worked out much better than I expected!

I’m in the same boat! I ran a Nelf Hunter for ages on Auchindoun US and one of my best interwebs friends played with me. Logged off once before a vacation and when I came home, he hadn’t logged on since before I left. That was on my old account, so I don’t even have his toon name anymore either. RIP
---
Spirit is really good when leveling
---
Thanks for making this!
---
why would not having engineering prevent you from completing what is entirely a grind? is this sincerely a point you're trying to make?

Lorefiend had such great forums.

re-originate implies that the planet would be reset to it's origin, unless that origin is meant to be a dust cloud in space. considering that the titans would be doing this to definitely kill old gods it would have to be quite a bang.

I’m in the minority that enjoyed ep 1-3 but holy hell ep 4 was awful. The pacing is so fucked up now.

Yea seen multiple setups posted lately without dual monitor. I think these people be crazy. I've rolled dual monitor since at least '02 on every home and work pc.
---
https://photos.app.goo.gl/ReTwqYQ4djPBWM7G6

Setup right now; La-Z-Boy recliner and dual monitor arm wall mounted. Not in the pic, but the left monitor is 4k HDR and has a UHD player, Roku, and TIVO attached to it. Ultimate media secondary monitor. I love this setup, best I've ever had by far.

Sure. It's the same stuff in every other game. Kill goddam X stuff of Monster Y with your goddamm, own char and skills, and not with this OP canon mounted on the boat which mows down hundrets of soltiers with one or two hits like in an hack n' slash manner while you repeatly press 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1.

Oh okay, youre one of these guys. Well I’d usually invite cool people to play the game with, not someone who makes fun if playing a game for fantasy. I get if you want to minmax all the way, but the person talked about just PvP in general.
---
WSG I would never bring more than one Rogue. They camp the flag if no hunter. Sometimes help in mid. Too squishy for large team fights though.
---
This is coming from a HWL Rogue and 2400 RBG experience. So vanilla and retail experience.
---
Never, ever. The answer to this question will always be “lol”
---
Nope,  it starts June 1st. The calendar summer,  so why the heck is calendar months and seasons for?
---
Fetch quests should not be put on a pedestal. They were a means to an end and provided some more XP while doing the standard grind. They were not interesting or exciting in any way though.
---
You can dislike both the mount quests &amp; the old quests.
---
nah
---
This argument only explains why maybe initially it was VC, but anyone doing it a second time or alt leveling called it DM in my experience. Don't tell me no one made alts until after Dire maul
---
They are recreating the game from retail, they have to do every change manually. That's why the demo was so bad, with 2x spell crit and fast regen etc. Without beta there will be hundreds of things they forgot or missed.
---
&gt; The record to get level 60 is 4d 20h
---
And the record holder has already gotten that down to 3 days 20 hours. People are faster these days.
---
You probably have 1.5 to 2 years before that happens. I know people like to meme that levelling to 60 takes ages, but even if you were to spend 200 hours leveling at a pace of 1h a day you'd still only spend less than a year.
---
Offft, I read that as “announced tomorrow And released on Monday”!!!! 😂😂😂😂
---
I need to buy my gaming laptop soon, but waiting till the announcement! 👍
---
Abort myself.

Please tell me you know what that actually means. I’m kind of guessing you don’t

I guess? I personally have 4 monitors....no reason just because... still use my phone to look up stuff 🤣😂
---

---
Eh, it's not hard to trinket-&gt;bear form before the blind goes off, and then you can start over if you want but you still have 18k armor/9k HP to chew through.
---
Yeah. This makes sense for sure
---
Alliance filth!
---

---
here
---
LMAO
---
They can be hard to find raid groups, and getting gear is VERY important to succeed as a "Rouge." If you have a raid group that you know you can join, playing a rogue can be very rewarding. Though a well geared warrior will out dps you. 
---
Rogues are a LOT of fun in world pvp and almost worth rolling simply for that fact. While still being very competitive in all other aspects of the game.
---
I am ready for parts 2 to 10
---
&gt; Wow head is full of flashing adds and pictures and crap all over...it annoys me.
---
You just described the entirety of the internet. That's what uBlock Origin is for.
---
Besides, the only reason ClassicDB can get away with no ads is because they pirate all their content - even guides and comments - from Wowhead. Have you ever wondered why ClassicDB is so ghetto and some links don't even work? Yes that's why, it's because it's a cheap copycat pirated site.
---
Done in 3 minutes, 10 seconds. A bit of Sporcle is fun now and then.
---
It's unregulated and gives items to whoever is first, not whoever benefits the guild most. Being first in the list doesn't mean you'd get the most benefit out of the item or that the guild would benefit most from you getting it.
---
No matter the system you use, in my opinion *some form* of loot council is needed for a sanity check. Unregulated does two things:
---
1. People at the top of the list refuse to suicide for an upgrade because they want to preserve their place at the top hoping for something else to drop. You then end up DEing viable upgrades or giving them to people without needing them to suicide, which only encourages people at the top to never suicide.
---
2. You get important upgrades for key raiders (eg, Main Tank) being parceled out to every Warrior in the raid rather than ensuring your key players are quickly geared up, which benefits the whole raid far more.

There are two monitors, just spread out a bit for the moment. I’m play a lot of console right now.

Cat....i must boop

Playing an orc rogue can be pretty OP sometimes, when you see a stun resist especially in a critical moment, it just feels so good and will reinforce your decision. This is coming from a UD Vanilla rogue.

Pl..pl...aystation? Oh my child

Appreciate it! The mini fridge is behind me in the picture under the bar!
---
Warlock then priest in vanilla. Priest then warlock for classic. These two classes have always been my mains. Switch every other expansion or so.
---
I understand that reference
---
Just accept that different people like different games?
---
My Cousin is a COD player and I thought Mass Effect would be fun for her. But she was bored on the tutorial level, because of too much dialogue.
---
And that's okay. Nothing wrong with liking something different. He doesn't have to play Classic WoW.
---
But remember 100% of the 'VC' votes are just trolls!

---
No, it used to be called db.vanillagaming.org though. This database has been used for years on private servers.
---
The rest of your points I already covered, but I guess you didn't read my comment properly.
---
see you in stv nubcakes
---
 *Lok*\-*tar ogar*!
---
Imagine getting trolled into thinking anyone actually calls it VC
---
Well just for the demo since they didn't want people wandering around parts of the game that hadn't been completed. For the live game they will not have boundaries like that. Lol they don't even do that in Retail. The only loading screens that even exist now are between continents and it was the same in Vanilla.
---
He came to me though? Basically asked me to sell it to him. He’s willing to give it a try, but why should he? That’s the point of this. I’m not mad he doesn’t seem interested, but I feel like a messed up a decent explanation
---
I think theres some people underestimating how hard some people will no-life.
---
IF we start on a Tuesday right at reset, I think its very likely MC will be cleared Week 1 by some guild advertising that theyre going to be attempting it on a particular server and enough other obsessed people will come to their cause.
---
1-58 in the first 5 days. MC attune and rep grind day 6 to 60, MC on day 7. Im not saying Im going to do it, but Im sure theres 40 people out there that will gather around to get it done
---
If it doesnt start on a reset, then 6 days would be plausible but very unlikely. 5 days would only really be possible with account sharing and under that impossible.
---
I know I know. I enjoy the simplicity of the PlayStation. Easy to turn on and join a game fast. I have a 2 and a half year old, so when I do get time to get game, it’s not for long.
---
This is the #1 thing I'm excited about for Classic.
---
My group of friends has been talking about getting back into WoW for years, but it's never caught on. Some people quit at 60, others at 80 or 110. Jumping into BFA with 10+ years of content and lore behind it is a herculean task. Levelling up feels weird because you're on a turbo-accelerated path to get to the current expansion content, and I'll always feel like I missed a huge chunk of the game.
---
With classic, we all start at level 1. The world will be populated, we can run instances, and we can explore the world together.
---
I had a motorized standing desk at my previous job. It's one of the things I miss most about the place. They're fantastic.
---
What am I forgetting?  I don't remember Engineering being a big deal for PvE/raiding.
---
I always forget about Moonglade.
---
Always wondered how my old guild friends were doing. Haven’t played in about 7 years.
---
I'm pretty sure it's either gonna be Sunday or Monday but its whatever at this point. The announcement of the release is closeeeeeee
---
You got some shit on your wall
---
1 - 3 felt really close to some of the good good, but yeah they dropped the ball. Guess we know how much of the book George has done.
---
I'm not getting my hopes up. 
---
Ehhhhhh who am I kidding I'm hype af.
---
Tbf I thought the first bombing quest in hellfire was fuckin cool. I feel you though, nowadays it’s so overdone and everytime I get a vehicle quest I’m just like “fucking hell, again?”
---
The game moved away from being like Vanilla because of people like you. In situations like progression raiding, and PvP, you are investing time with the expectation of a reward, and of equal participation by your group; their personal desire does not change the numbers. If they don't care about the numbers, then they don't care about the group. Who's the uncool one here?
---
I agree that's the best, but it's also a bit unrealistic when you're dealing with 60ish people whose relationship is primarily digital. I know people point to LC as the preferred system for the most successful guilds, but my theory is that those guilds are able to overcome the drama of LC by consistently and rapidly delivering progress and large quantities of loot. In more mediocre guilds where progress is slower and the incoming loot quantity is less, players are more likely to get fed up with the drama.
---
Given that any guild I manage to create would not be of the server-first hardcore variety due to real-life time constraints, my experience in guilds such as those has shown LC to be a massive source of drama, bleeding out of good raiders, and the ultimate death of said guilds.
---
Just don’t do that every night, even my gf deserves every other night or so all for her
---
I hope so too
---
AWWW shucks, well at least that is one person who is happy with me.  I Will let my wife know since she is currently upset with me.
---
honk honk
---
Basically the warrior class is hardcore. 90% of it's adherents are wow lifers. They are also the most popular class. I dunno why but more then any other class in the game. If you plan on playing 12+ hours a day and min maxing everything. Your statically prolly a warrior.
---
Already seen one old guildmate on there. Soon as I saw their name I remembered their class.....Jesus how the memory works.
---
It's not for the consumers, it's for their servers. Don't want to sit in queue. Don't want to fight 20 people for a single mob. Don't want people stuck on dead servers.

This game will release when I am overloaded with projects and times when I will return home late from from work.
---
This shit always happens with me.
---
I think it’s good to innovate and have different types of quests, rather than have every quest be some variation of “kill x mobs” or “collect y items”
---
No, I will say that you should play your fantasy whatever it may be. If you have played the horde and you love playing horde then you may end up play alliance and not being as invested as you would have been. Just do what you want.

You forgot the megafuckton quantities of money

Alright, so I'm old and have not caught up with this whole "streamer" business. Can anyone ELI5? How are they crashing servers?
---
Your Horde friend would have a Thrall tattoo and little WoW figurine bobbleheads in his car, though. Because edgy and "pride" and neckbeard man children and all the other bullshit you have to be okay with to live in a mud hut with the other degens.
---
Holy duck look how people are standing to spectate it.
---
You get triggered damn easy
---
”Vehicle” quests are the worst.
---
I’m not even browsing Home or All anymore. Literally open Apollo and go straight to r/classicwow. As far as I’m concerned this is as good as the internet will ever get seeing these guys post back and forth
---
The less breaking of the 4th wall, the better.
---
No different to any other mods.
---
Ok
---
The way okay is spelt in this tilts me I’m sorry lol
---
I think im gonna play the opposite faction to what i want to play when it Releases. This way i can Provide Feedback without "spoiling myself" or killing the hype too much. Any1 else doing this?
---
NA here, we never called it VC and anytime someone DID say VC in chat they got mocked by numerous people. DM is Deadmines in the US, Dire Maul is DM:E/N/W
---
If you want to win at boss dps till late AQ/Naxx only losing to warriors at that point roll rogue.
---
My plan for my Mage's professions is
---
 - Level with Mining and Tailoring. Hoard the mats I get from Mining. Use Tailoring to make bags and stuff.
---
 - Get Tailoring 300 and make Robe of the Archmage. Drop Tailoring.
---
 - Pick up Engineering. Power-level it with all the mats I stocked up. 
---
 - I may swap out Mining at some point too.
---
Have an alt with Enchanting, put money into it with my Mage main.
---
So three hours of your week will be watching the Patriots play? What about the rest? I can spend 3 hours a day farming Runecloth.
---
Haha, must be, because I got downvoted into oblivion for posting this when it was night in US 😄
---
I'm sad that Trolls couldn't be Druids until Cata. I want to play Horde Druid, but I don't like Mulgore in general, or TB, or really how Tauren look in animal forms for that matter.
---
Correct
---
Shield Block?
---
Well, a person who only raids 25% of the time this week might be raiding more full-time in a month or two when IRL stuff clears up.
---
Of course, I would say the most adult thing to do would be to *talk* to them and if there's a specific piece that high-attendance player needs ask that if that specific piece drops they consider passing on it.  Do this ahead of time, before the raid - not suddenly when the item drops.
---
Of course, even the 25%'er will like to be rewarded for coming along and they'll likely pick up a bunch of loot that others in your raid have already gotten because they're actually here when it drops.
---
But if you're really worried about having a system/ruleset in place (PuG or VERY serious guilds), maybe give each class leader (if you have those) a single override per raid?  Just to prevent that rare, awesome healer trinket from going to a hunter or something.
---
Good to hear some sane ones are out there! :) It's probably server-specific as well.
---
I think it's equivalent to 2 points in Master of Deception in the subt tree. It's basically like you being 1 level higher than non NE rogues. Shadowmeld gives +5 stealth, Master of Deception gives +3 each talent point, iirc.
---
I think this is a valid point too. Perfectly feasible blizzard is using some unconventional marketing methods to generate buzz. Also perfectly feasible Tips is as bad as Sansa at keeping a secret. Either way is completely baffling to me how people can get so worked up over this.
---
Lose the salt
---
Well you could say the following:
---
If there is a best games of all time list, WoW Classic is in it, just like Zelda and Mario. WoW Classic is the game that South Park dedicated a whole episode to, it's a cultural phenomenon. People in Berlin, would beat each other up, because all the copies were sold out on Release date. Sit down and don't ask stupid questions and play the game.
---
or
---
It only costs 1 subscription and you get tons of content. Name me another game, with that kind of value in the micro transactions and pre-Order age.
---
I can't help you with feelings part, since I'm not that kind of person, I'm more logical, than sentimental, but there are going to be tons of people who can give you arguments for the nostalgia root.
---
A lot of groups don’t even make it to VC. The dungeon might as well be called “goblin forge room” since that’s where most groups disband.
---
The key difference is the benefit of most other professions are not bound to you like Eng is. Potions/Elixirs aren't BoP. Every Eng item/trinket requires the profession, except EZ Dynamite.
---
10hours a week = lvl60 in 3-5 months?! Good Lord hopefully not. But now that's ringing a bell. 10 years have made my memory fuzzy, thought it was 20 hours to 60 now realizing it's 20 days played.
---
This is even better.
---
Idk, there's one in BFA where you control a fire elemental and crush / burn dozens of dark iron dwarves.
---
It isn't the pinnacle of game design but it's a fun quest. You do this once and them move on.
---
Unfitting for vanilla of course but this kind of quest is fun imo (although the ones throwing bombs are indeed a waste of time)
---
this was always my favorite thing about wow back in the day. spent hours upon hours getting new 19s and 39s their AGM. there were guild wars, a lot of insanely geared solo rogues mostly glad... gurubashi was the place to be. i always wished that somehow people registered their group or party for the spawn and maybe the spectators could bet gold on who was going to win but obviously it would get abused somehow lol
---
Canada here, and "My wife and I went to [...]" sounds a lot better to me ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Porn aside (who dpesmt just use their phone nowadays?) dual monitors are going to make WoW into a whole new animal for me. Gonna watch so many shows while leveling alts and grinding Winterspring!
---
Can you register the various names separately?
---
I have my setup in my side room which has all the windows blocked so sunlight doesnt come in. I literally have no idea if it's light or dark outside so the only way I'll be able to tell time is by looking at a clock. The perfect excuse for staying up too late night after night. 
---
As for my PC, I decided to get something that would truly match the original experience. You know, playing it in 1440p 144 Hz gsync 32" curved monitor on max settings like we all used to. Also, since it's an Alienware 17 R5 I still have a 1440p 120 Hz gsync display for when I have to travel. Nothing like spending a few grand for a game that can run on a potato, lol
---
I always wondered why Blizzard didn't do more with the arena. Would have been perfect for an expanded brawler's guild type of thing.
---
Idk I remember it taking all summer all day and night
---
Rookie room. 
---
I want to see cheeto dust, soda stains, sweat marks, sticky keyboard keys, zero light, and a lot more mess in general. Casual
---
Or people like me that had shit tons of time to rank to r13 in vanilla but don’t have the time or will to do this again and I’ll just buy a loaded account for a days work of wage if my char can’t keep up with gear in later stages
---
It really depends on your level, talents, and gear...switching to combat forms costs a lot of mana, so while you're leveling you don't want to do a lot of that unless you love drinking and downtime.  Most of the time you're gonna want to moonfire pull and bear form. When you get furor talents then cat - although I'll take a lot of shit for saying that because a lot of people go right to cat at 20, but TBH I find bear form is a lot less risky on a PvP server because you take less damage and have to do less healing.  Feral is very strong leveling though, it's actually pretty amazing. But, no...not really switching forms other than caster to combat. Not cat, bear, cat usually.
---
Perhaps more important is the poop knife.....
---
Yeah because its more fun that way.
---
Word of mouth isn't the worst plan ever. The last thing that we need is a giant surge of players and then a massive falloff. A nice slow roll of incoming players would frankly be ideal to the experience of playing the game as well as the longevity.
---
Cuk seyf
---
No problem! Have fun!
---
You wouldn't not have engineering if you were a good player
---
Fellow hungarian here, used to play on bloodscalp in vanilla
---
I made a thread about this and got downvoted into oblivion but it's true. Blizzard did this with a Hearthstone set. Said "August" but it was literally the last fucking day of August. They'll do the same shit with Classic. 9/22 is the last day of Summer so that's the release date, I bet.
---
Enjoy some of our famous Mulgore Spice Bread. It’s quite tasty.
---
Upvote because I agree with the first part, but I loved leveling in TBC, idk why you said that 😕
---
i can't wait to need everything and have people go "WTF r you doing"
---
sorry i need it
---
I thought rogues weren’t gear dependent at all? Hence the whole ganking people naked with a white dagger thing? All the conflicting information out there really confuses me.
---
Since it’s based on the current client, simply look at the official requirements for current BfA and go from there.
---
- Don't read the following if you want to do it yourself -
---
I only started playing WoW on Nostalrius and got 35/40. I missed:
---
Tirisfal Glades - I lost a ton of time on this one because I kept trying to submit Tirisfal Glade without the s. Then I tried different spellings of Tirisfal. Stupid plural.
---
Dun Morogh - This is where Dwarves start I guess?
---
Wetlands - I think I had to go here to do part of my Onyxia attunement.
---
Dustwallow Marsh - I remembered it but tried to submit Duskwallow Marsh. Oops.
---
Moonglade - Whatever.
---
If you want to stay ahead of the curve then stay in darkshore until you get cat form.  You're gonna have to travel to moonglade a few times, your poison quest, etc. Might even consider waiting on aqua until 20, but that's kinda hardcore because getting auqa form is pretty much awesome. Especially for the shitty murloc quest in the boats underwater.
---
Yup I remember all summer vacation too
---
Just because I was blessed with these sexy bovine muscles, doesn’t make me a mongrel, Gnome!
---
Summer starts at the end of June....
---
nope :P, 35/40
---
-Loch modan  
---
-Wetlands  
---
-Dustwallow Marsh  
---
-Searing Gorge  
---
-Blasted Lands  
---
I haven't played wow in like 2 years though. I could remeber most zones visually in my mental journey through the continents, but was blanking on the names. ok, actually forgot wetlands and dustwallow marsh.
---
I agree that's a concern, but an alternative is starting off slow and never gaining traction which seems far worse to me
---
I believe, in addition to dynamic spawn rates, Blizz is planning to do a limited amount of sharding in the early zones/levels figuring that though there'll be a crush of folks at launch playstyle, free time, and other differences between players will quickly spread folks out enough that they will be able to sunset it rather quickly.
---
That's fucking awesome!!! For the Alliance!
---
My first ever character was a undead rogue. Got him to level 36 I think when the family computer died and we couldn't get a new one. I was 13 at the time. Fast forward a year or two and I had managed to save up to get my own computer. Started again on a new realm to play with friends and played a draenei mage from mid-TBC through the first patch of Cata. Quit when Firelands hit. Returned with a group of friends in MoP, played through all the content as a gnome monk. WoD and BfA I went back to my mage, did the leveling then quit shortly after, after blasting the raids with raid finder.
---
Come classic I'm restarting that undead rogue.
---
Holy fuck those underwater scenes used get me excited back in the day.
---
This is one of the games I have ever played and felt like a true adventure.
---
My suspicion is that it evolved from complaints that quests were too repetitive. Lots of casuals on the forum would say "I hate that all the quests are just Kill X Boars or Loot Y Item." So they added quests like that to address the criticism and ended up going overboard. I wouldn't have minded a few here and there but there's too many now.
---
Streamer think they will be able to arena there without interference, we will see how that goes
---
Whoo I hope so!
---
Kek
---
Nothing’s changed.  That’s why we’re doing weird shit.

It wasn't. People found out it was amazing for PvE after retail vanilla.
---
You can pvp people, by simply building combo points and then eviscerate as eviscerate was not gear dependent. 
---
White damage, ambush, back stab, sinister strike most damage abilities DO scale to gear A TON. So yeah, you can kill some bad players with lvl 1 grey daggers. Though, I doubt that will be as feasible this time around.
---
Nice chassi. Go Fractal.
---
I would love to see another night elf mohawk commercial or a leeroy Jenkins themed ad
---
I feel overall the alliance tend to attract more of the min/max pretentious tryhards. While horde players are a little more laid back and willing to have fun. Don't get me wrong there are these players on both sides, but, they tend to lean more towards one side.
---
I did 60 the day before TBC came out so &gt;!FO!&lt;.
---
33/40 which is bad, but i had some issues with spelling. But still 33/40 is just bad. Even missed UD Starter zone. Pfff.
---
That's a good point about changing raid frequencies, and in a way makes me think the concern may be something of a non issue. /u/unhab pointed out a really great modification which was that non-present members stay in place and do not advance, so that's another nice solution.
---
As for the hunter situation, yes certainly some oversight would be in place to avoid abuses such as that, but ideally I would like a system that's a bit more freeform than not, that prioritizes rewarding players in general over maximum rate of guild progress. Resto shaman wants that Spinal Reaper? Go for it. Hunters with Ashkandi, that's ok. Personally I think a more liberal loot system is a better fit to a less hardcore guild.

This is great, would love to meet up with some old friends.
---
There is no information so meme’s keep me on the rail
---
Was harder than i thought. Granted i haven't played at all in a few years. Stonetalon mountains was the only zone i almost "forgot", probably since i almost never quested there. Then there was darkshore and durotar that i knew i know the names but just couldn't force it out from my memory, like how your mind goes blank when you try too hard :D
---
Great list of ideas, thanks!
---
This is what’s got me at a stalemate. I want to try shaman but I can’t get over not rerolling alliance.
---
Thats the newcome balance. A bunch of skills that actually are the same for every class, with the only difference being the graphyical representation.Absolutely pathetic
---
Thats why TBC was the epitome of perfection in terms of balance and class individuality
---
My gripe with that site is you can't use ASCII characters which is what everyone remembers me as.
---
Change Your background to Iron Forge
---
I will say I 100% agree with the sentiment, but in TBC that first bombing run quest was kinda cool, before you did it again and again and again lol...
---
Are you me?
---
36/40 but i dont count felwood because I remembered it but thought I had already entered it but I guess i didnt.
---
Missed Silverpine, couldn't remember the name. 
---
Totally forgot about Dustwallow Marsh and Azshara.
---
Dude fuck off making fun of someone is not fun.
---
Ive been rogue main all my wow career i only switched to warrior in wotlk and then came back to rogue on mop, but now days things are diffrent ive been experimenting and i found that the most apealing play style is paladin.. lol i mean i feel like taking a vacation whilst playing a pally and im not that young and taste of blood driven anymore so im cool with the chiller playstyle.
---
Also everyone and their mothers cat are going to be rogues and warriors and i dont like sharing and competiting about gear so theres that.
---
Ahh yeah free mount @ 40.
---
What else.. ah un gankable! Oh u wanna kill me.. if im loosing a fair fight bubble and hearth away.
---
Cheers cant wait.
---
..Ye Fucks
---
Right?  I didn't even love them at the time but I think they could do some pretty great stuff with them now to drum up interest.  It might not be a great strategy to JUST do the nostalgia ads, but as one form it would work well IMO
---
I *never* forget about Moonglade.
---
Having potions is not an advantage from a profession, anyone can have potions regardless of their profession.
---
Agree with this.  Rogues were just OK in WSG and even in AB the idea that you wanted 5 was unlikely.  I think 2 or 3 at max.
---
I would love the idea of a Classic ad for YouTube that's only like 5 seconds long and is basically, "LET'S DO THIS LEEROYYYY JENKINSSSS!" and then cut to a title card with launch date.
---
It would take like a few minutes at most to put together, run in the amount of time before someone can "skip" an ad on YouTube and put a smile on the face of so many Vanilla players.
---
At least with Esfand I can tell he actually loves vanilla and wants what’s best for the game, unlike that moron Towelliee.
---
The only way to go is hcim
---
They shouldve done a Superbowl ad, that would've been great.
---
+10 points to Gryffindor!
---
I'd move the tower on the ground.
---
Sure that’s grammatically correct but people from all over the world use colloquialisms all the time.  Using ‘the wife’ just happens to be a colloquialism from middle America.
---
That was like 1.1-1.8 or something.  By the time 1.12 rolled around, rogues were the weakest they had been in WoW.
---
The lack of marketing/info makes me think the release date is still very far off
---
\- 40 fucking man raids
---
\- prequests for raids
---
\- character and class progression
---
\- having an Epic means something, also sets
---
\- ur not a number
---
\- longterm goals, really longterm goals
---
\- so much fucking more
---
What specifically made it good?  I had 300 Engineering on my Paladin (Engineering snares/burst were the only way I could finish anyone...), and there's nothing about it that I can recall that would seem to be good for raiding.
---
Well it’s not because you could just make those same pots on a 35 alt or let ur friend make them. Engineering is absolutely mandatory
---
Sorry for comment tangent, but does anyone else get confused or weirded out by the name “tipsoutbaby”? What does that even mean? Is it a sexual innuendo combined with the word “baby”? Or is it just him begging for money from viewers? 
---
I can’t hear or read his name without thinking it’s some kind of pedo reference or him begging his viewers for tips but maybe it’s just a culture/language/understanding thing. I don’t hate the guy but I can’t get passed how weird his online name is.
---
Oh definitely swords is huge...I'm vain and don't like humans that much so I'm the wrong one to ask. I like daggers and PvP too lol
---
No.. Yes... fuck
---
Either warrior, shaman, or possibly spriest
---
I liked TBC, but I have to disagree with you on that one. The first time I saw one of those quests in Hellfire Peninsula I thought it was kinda lame. I didn't even think it was cool once.
---
If you liked it, then that's fair.
---
A couple of non-blizzard devs got Vanilla/TBC/Wrath up and running with little to no bugs, and near geniune feel.  I'm sure blizzard can do this even easier since they made the game, they have sources of material, and they have a lot more resources than those others.  If they can't get this out in a timely fashion they need to find a new line of work.
---
VAN CLEEF PAY BIG FOR YOUR HEADS
---
Yes^^
---
I'd kind of hope that's the reason, but also don't because there's plenty to suggest it's not that far off (also because i want to play)
---
Undead is just as good or better for PvP when compared to Orc.  WotF is still huge.
---
Gnome EZ.  Dwarf also good for stoneform against other rogues.
---
For what it's worth, my guild raiding alliance back in the day used a modified zero-sum DKP system where we gave a small amount of credit per hour in a dungeon to reward attendance.  It was all managed by a parsing addon and was fair, even to a fault and not that much work to make happen.
---
Of course, I don't know what addons or other on-line features are available at this point since that was over a decade ago.  But there will be solutions!
---
&gt; I just assume September 20 (last day of summer) until I hear otherwise. If it's anything earlier I get to be pleasantly surprised
---
I think it would be stupid to announce that vanilla is releasing on summer, just to release it on the last day. It will release on june/july.
---
Your cats obviously a tauren druid though?
---
kek
---
The Italian food calls to him and he must answer.  Hes going to die before he finishes the books.  The man is morbidly obese
---
The famous Classic meme: 
---
**Hunters are ninjas and if anything happens, always blame the Hunter (or their pet)**, haha!
---
At the end of the day, Blizzard is a bunch of employees and maybe contractors working hard across multiple teams and coordinating shit all the time.
---
Maybe they'll try their best late into the work day to see if they can get an announcement out.
---
There's going to be meeting after meeting and most of the team will be like: Shit, why are we having so many meetings when we should be working? And Project Managers will be adamant about announcing everyone's current progress both to the teams and upper management.
---
Sleep will be missed. Alcohol will be drank. And hours of hard work we cannot even fathom will continue behind the scenes.
---
Keep up the good work, Blizzard. Corporate enterprises are difficult work environments!
---
Not essential but will definitely help just depend on how hardcore you want to be. If you're trying to be high ranked it is definitely needed, but just playing casually its not a big deal you may, however, have some problems.  Also, it's required for some classes like feral druid if they are trying to DPS in PvE, so it is not only good in pvp but damn near essential for some pve classes.
---
Personal desires dont change the numbers no. But youre the one telling what PvP or Pve should be about. Some people want to play the class fantasy, despite being sub-optimal.
---
That’s why I love studying culture, it’s different everywhere ya go!
---
"Cmon, Judas, show some respect... sellout"
---
Just imagine if that was in the bible lmao
---
Whoa what is this
---
That’s not Dire Maul
---
Probably. But if you expect June/July and you get August you're disappointed. If you expect September and get August you're pleased.
---
I'd rather be pleased than disappointed.
---
Rogues are really good at stun locking warlocks under the GY in WSG. like really good those %$#% $#@\^-tards!
---
Or so a friend tells me.
---
I don't play modern WOW, so maybe I'm thinking of something different, but I didn't mind it too much when I did the set of quests in hellfire peninsula where you did just that.  It was a decent break from the "kill 12 things" quests.
---
downvoted for not being Horde.
---
I was literally just questing through here last night and first time seeing this place I was like what a shame that a place as awesome as this is completely empty. I'm looking forward to trying out classic for the first time ever.
---
I didn’t know there was a healing reduction factor tbh.
---
But even then. Trolls gets increased attack speed too. There’s just no way in hell Tauren are the best TPS.
---
It took me years to realize that was Jessie Cox singing it.
---
39/40 in 3 minutes. Missed blasted lands cause who even goes there?
---
forget Wowhead, it's [https://classicdb.ch/](https://classicdb.ch/) you want.
---
In vanilla, 100% agree. Human racial and Paladins ensure that the 0.01% tryhards all go alliance. But they are such a small subset of a community I don't think they really change the tone of for example world chat, and certainly not of random people you encounter while leveling.
---
Yeah, I plan on doing something similar. Level with mining and herb then drop mining and level alch at max level, or maybe earlier if I can't keep up. Then eventually make enough money with herb alch to drop herb and level engi.
---
None may challenge the Brotherhood.
---
Game moved away from vanilla because people like me? What are you talking about? Its exactly the opposite. All sub-optimal aspects have been removed in order to balance the game. Literally the game is played in eSports. If something, its people like you that contributed to the progress of changing the game from what it used to be, a mmorpg.
---
You are polite.
---
That is not a real race you stupid moron.
---
Uck Fay Es yay
---
Some people are alt-aholics, I am a compulsive re-speccer. My re-spec was always maxed out in vanilla because I would change it daily just for fun. Meta specs, jank spec, niche specs, you name it I'll be cycling through them all!
---
All this did was make me look up how to spell the names of each zone lol...
---
As a counter-point, I would think that nostalgia is something (cynically) they'd like to exploit.  That feeling will often strike and quickly pass - I imagine they'll want to have something actionable available when they launch a marketing campaign.  I would expect a marketing push right around release, whether that's in two weeks or two months (or more) I would say it's too close for a mass-market ad campaign but that doesn't mean release is a super-long way away.
---
God tier aoe burst thanks to saper charges. And the mechanical chicken is quite good in melee.

I made one but got deleted for 'low effort memes' /u/spearmints Where is the line when it comes to these posts?
---
My tenth reroll is soon reaching lvl20 on a pserver (at 20 I stop) , come on I need some hope!
---
I've been waiting all week for a blue post, even if the latest one about chars limit did not meet my expectations....
---
Blizzard, give it to us!
---
Question. What’s in the chest?
---
&gt;I was one of those that was preaching 2019 Q2    
---
&gt;Classic will be out somewhere between 7-21 July    
---
Then it will be Q3.
---
Get's my vote for becoming the official unofficial classic forums!
---
I don't follow private servers very closely but my guess is bombs/grenades. Later on in late TBC/Wrath people started using them for PvE too and I can only imagine that trend picked up on vanilla servers.
---
Meta meme
---
oh yes, because every good player MUST NEVER enjoy any other professions than engineering
---
Any credibility or just baseless speculation?
---
True true, but OP was just talking pvp in general, and no, it is not essential for it. For getting rank 14 yes, obviously(although been achieved without it too).
---
me @ Zin'rokh, Destroyer of Worlds
---
I had engineering too because it sounded fun (also picked dwarf priest without knowing anything about the game). 
---
- Goblin Sapper Charges (Can be used to instantly take Viscidus from 100% to 5%, and completely trivialize a lot of AoE scenarios, like nefarian adds. Also essential for instantly wiping enemy raids, so they lose buffs not you)
---
- Battle Chicken (4 minutes of 5% melee haste for the group without losing trinket slot, pretty substantial raid dps boost)
---
- Arcanite Dragonling (Stacking them increases fire dmg taken a lot, but haven't personally seen them used)
---
The fact that it is  good for pvp makes it good for pve too, to avoid losing buffs or to take over world boss.
---
Not only that, PS has some of the best single player games of this gen, if not the best.
---
The best part of this thread is the people trash talking streamers, not expecting them to reply, and walking it back with "DUDE I WASN'T TALKING ABOUT YOU I LOVE YOUR CONTENT" when the cat is out of the bag.
---
Sorry to say I think Provosorisk has the monopoly on them right now. Share it here in the comments maybe people will see it and love it.
---
" its an older cat sir but it checks out "
---
I've been in the dkp/time guilds as well, not a huge fan. It creates a perverse incentive to run the raid longer than necessary in order to generate more dkp. Same thing with rewarding dkp for attempts. If anything I think it'd make more sense to have dkp bonuses for setting new guild speed records or wipeless raids. Also it's hard to fit such systems in without moving to more of a point system like DKP, but maybe that's the solution? Worth considering.
---
It is totally legit to dislike both of them, but I think he has a point when he prefers the one where you are actually playing your character.
---
On a personal note, kill/collect quests never bothered me. I like them well enough.
---
I think most of us just want a release so we can request PTO.   Idk about you guys but my company requires at least a month of prior notice if you're taking longer than a day or two off.  I'm trying to poopsock for a week so I need to get that PTO request out!
---
I know..what i am saying is i was prediting for classic to release way sooner than the majority of thius sub. Because ppl just dont want to have their expectations crushed, they  were always exaggerating at the release date
---
Yeah, but when it comes down to raiding and dungeons I could definitely tell the difference. They also are attracted by dwarfs and fear ward.
---
Do u rly think such things will happen again?
---
From various signs and speculation included ofc
---
To me it looks like some kind of live announcement/gameplay thing, hence the multitasking to not miss it live.
---
September = "summer"
---
Gold is still limited in WoW, and rarely you have enough to spend on free actions potions and full stack of other potions just for BG’s. But yeah true. I was just stating how they compare.
---
Least you're honest about it.
---
Mandatory for what? You have to be more specific.
---
CB/Prep and Premed/Relentless.  Maybe Seal Fate/prep or Seal Fate/imp backstab.  But you lose prep with that one, along with imp sap which is important.
---
Kill it with fire!
---
Tbf with the advent of stuff like google docs and sheets, it become a lot easier since then to track and for everyone to see how things are working in real time.
---
I meant that I made a picture with a [doggo](https://i.redd.it/5y38ubdm0ex21.png) in it (not a gif). Wasn't that special and it was low effort haha but was wondering where the line was.  Thnx for your reply :)
---
That time frame will mess with 8.2
---
Month ago there was much more speculation due to the silence by Blizzard.  Now that we've been getting blue post clarifying certain controversial points, there are fewer and fewer people warning that the sky is falling.  Also, I assume you sort by "hot"  and not "new",  so you're seeing what most of us are upvoting right now - which is memes.  Upvote anything that is amusing to you, and since we've hashed out so much of the minutia over the last year, everyone is bored of it and making silly memes - which is fine.
---
It's probably more of a discussion on how to handle servers, like pops and number of servers, based on cost to how many people will be playing than anything right now.  I'm sure the game is in a launchable state with perhaps minor bugs showing up when live, a beta would just be a server test to figure out sharding.  If there's issues outside of those for this game, oh boy......
---
Normal blizzard speak on a time frame is Summer = last day of summer, or delayed until fall ("when it's ready" lolblizz).  If they were smart, this would come out at the beginning of the summer and capitalize on all the people who have nothing to play during the summer gaming drought. I mean the phase it's launching in shouldn't be much of an issue, and it's actually going to take majority of players a long time to hit max level.
---
&gt;I was one of those that was preaching 2019 Q2 after the announcement of Classic.I was getting downvoted to oblivion by the 85% of the subs.
---
That could have something to do with your trouble understanding cardinal numbers, a concept normally taught with great success in primary school.
---
_"preaching 2019 Q2"_
---
_"Classic will be out somewhere between 7-21 July"_
---
The 2nd quarter of the year 2019, ends on June 30th, at the stroke of Midnight.
---
I could never level an ally. I tried. But the quest text always seemed like it was aimed at 10 year olds, and I hate the zones and towns. When Kel' Thuzad flopped from Horde heavy to Allies making up 80% of the server around cata, I ended up just paying for multiple faction transfers, rather than have to level through that garbage. I've considered trying to go ally in classic, but I don't think I can.
---
Until blizz announces the release date, I'm going to continue expecting it to launch on  Monday, September 23 (the last day of summer).
---
Looks like the cat shit up your wall
---
If a lot of the whispers and rumors are true, then July is completely possible. Not getting my hopes up, but keeping an open mind.
---
Even in WC2, can't remember exactly for WC1 Pixelmode
---
Mages and hunters destroyed rogues by the time 1.12 rolled around.  Warlocks are also a nightmare with either succubus or felhunter out.
---
Plus you get to visit Westfall and Duskwood and commit acts of bitter jealousy that the Horde never got early zones as cool as those two. That said, I'll always be Horde and The Barrens is life.
---
I saw this and read this too, such bullshit lol.
---
I will play a class and race I have no intention of ever playing in retail (night elf druid). I will play as much as I can in the time frame and report as many issues, no matter how small.
---
I will also play around with what scripting capabilities they have and see if it aligns closely to retail, which is exactly what I"m expecting.
---
Yeees obviously. But one has to be more specific when talking about necessities. For what? Rank 14? Winning 99 of 100 duels? OP is talking about pvp in general, or about how to win against super high skilled players without losing.
---
Meh not even the correct loot window for classic
---
It will be a summer release anyway. Ppl always exaggerating.
---
I don't mind having one or two of these, but christ they got boring fast. There is no thrill in beating huge armies with no effort. In BFA there was one with a giant toad, first time that was enjoyable! Something new I got to squash stuff with a giant toad. But then  having more and more quests, even ones on the main storyline...
---
Our cause is righteous!
---
They confirmed summer 2019 at the earnings call.
---
well yea, by definition you are not good if you don't make choices that make you perform better, why is that hard to understand?
---
only blood matters
---
Thats why imo looking at this as a slider from LC &lt;---|---&gt; DKP is the best method. The place you chose to put the line is yours, but a mix of the two systems can pick up the peices the other system drops.
---
Do you WANT the game flooded by hordes upon hordes of Twitch followers, in search for their next easy fix of instant gratification?
---
39/40, missed alterac mountains which I honestly thought was just a subzone of hillsbrad and not it's own proper zone.
---
I never said july isn't possible, in fact, this is also what I thnik for release.
---
Switch it back to default sorting by when people signed up rather than alphabetical - make that a sort option.
---
They don't want to advertise it because it will break their agenda. Their ultimate plan to is to release classic as quietly as possible, to draw in as little players as possible, so they can then scrap the project altogether, call it a failure, tell us "you think you did but you didn't", and "see, our current version of wow is superior,  we rock (ego repair)", and then shut down classic servers and offer "free transfers onto bfa servers".
---
Calling it now.
---
GIVE IT TO ME NOW!
---
Well, so the idea of the zero-sum DKP is that when an item drops it costs 40 points.  Those 40 points are paid by the person who bids on it with the most DKP and then those same 40 points are redistributed to the rest of the 39 raiders (so the person who gets loot goes down 40 points and the rest of the raid goes up .975 points).  So most (or all) of the point generation comes from beating bosses and distributing loot.
---
A true zero-sum DKP system would award no bonuses for time played or anything else.  The problem was in vanilla we were...not that skillful and people (justifiably) wanted some reward for coming to progression nights even when we didn't down a boss.  But if that's not an issue for you guys, then a true zero-sum should work pretty darn well.
---
Hahaha I get it dude, I'm pretty much right there with you. Oh well, though. A lot of these comments make it seem like a much more enjoyable leveling experience, so that's cool even though we plan on power leveling to 60 ASAP so we'll blow by it.
---
He hadn’t sucked up to Blizzard enough, unlike that weirdo Towelliee
---
Downvoted for telling it like it is, harsh. I mean I only played one server in vanilla but literally everyone referred to Deadmines as VC
---
Bur
---
While true, are you really going to give up 5% hp for a slight tps gain every 3 minutes?
---
Was he in the same group as a shaman?
---
31/40, how could I have forgotten some of these?!&gt;!&gt;
---
 Dun Morogh 
---
 Silverpine Forest  
---
 Redridge Mountains  
---
 Duskwood 
---
 Dustwallow Marsh  
---
  Hinterlands
---
Tanaris
---
Searing Gorge
---
 Winterspring
---
there is a difference between optimal and good.
---
Serious question, is english your second language? It's easy to miss the nuances of the word definition if its not your native tongue
---
To the Strength!
---
Witnessss!
---
The only quest of this type that I enjoyed was the Death Knight quest towards the end, where you were able to actually control the lich dragon. Felt like the BAMF you were meant to be as a DK riding a mountain of a dead dragon
---
Joke’s on you, I’ll be playing a Night Elf Mohawk.
---
I got 36/40, as someone that mostly played Night Elf, and has level'd up in the dwarven areas quite a bit, I feel slightly embarassed when I knew which zones I had left but I could not remember these names:
---
Teldrassil,
---
Darkshore,
---
Loch Modan and
---
Silverpine Forest
---
On the other hand, I've barely played the game since Cataclysm was released. So I can always use that as an excuse, I guess.
---
Corner desk master race.
---
OKay, let me try the first few Human ones at least...
---
...erm...green-ish forest with Goldshire...yellow fields where I farm fused wiring...Mor'Ladims hood...and the mountainy one where there is a horde rogue.
---
Did I do good daddy?
---
Elder scrolls online has really good quest design imo - every quest is a story (very similar to how Skyrim does it), and there's no "kill X / collect Y" quests.
---
Too bad the rest of the game sucks, especially the combat oh god
---
I always wished this was a feature and there was an Arena Champion etc 
---
Imagine placing bets on the underdog and winning big or being the Champion and becoming famous for it etc
---
Read and it'll be clear I'm not arguing for that.  Also not one to gatekeep who can play the game, more the merrier - just like Vanilla was.
---
Oh definitely.  Even back then, we had a log parsing addon that you would then upload post-raid onto the website, verify that it was correct, and then update everyone's point totals.  It was easy then and I'm sure it'll be easier now.
---
Is Q2 for Blizzards Fiscal year in July?
---
I feel like in a lot of the language people use horde players are more just ribbing against alliance while alliance players actually treat their faction like something to be a supremacist about, which I find amusing coming from the concentration camp faction.
---
Put it on hold until we get some more info (beta) and I get more time (soon). Feel free to give me feedback!
---
I liked it because it was an easy daily. No waiting for respawns or getting wrecked by horde. Won't be sad to see them go though.
---
Got 100%, surprising but had a few minutes to spare. What a fun way to pass some time at work thanks man!
---
So it’s a Spooky Undead Axe Midget?
---
I personally think 1-2 was decent, but every second of 3 and 4 was a nightmare.
---
At this point, we need a timeline video "The history of Goldshire Retriever"
---
Well, I can say that druids are pretty good early game and also have some pretty fun pvp later. With any class with a healing spec, you can heal dungeons up to about level 48 or so without talents.
---
Back when I played 1.12 most locks rolled SL in organized BG's and the only soulfire/conflagration locks were world PvP heroes.
---
I thought only Taurens could be Night Elves in Vanilla.
---
Easy 40.
---
Took me a while to remember dustwallow and thousand needles for some reason.
---
I remember being a hunter and having rogues and warriors roll need on ranged weapons so they can pull mobs.
---
probably try playing an ally character prob like a rougue or warr. Then go back to my horde druid at launch
---
Yes and why were any suboptimal choices removed? So that special snowflakes like you can choose and do whatever they please and not suffer performance reduction.
---
As far as "worst irrational fear", it's cynical but not totally unfounded.  I would definitely agree however that it's a bad indicator of their long-term plan for the game should they choose to not market it.
---
you're welcome :)
---
Beta on the 14th
---
Awesome idea! Sadly my server only has like 60 other people who've listed themselves :(
---
Also, noticed a minor bug; when you mouse over the contact info, the box seem stick on the screen and you have to refresh the page to remove it. Using Google Chrome.
---
edit: and perhaps the ability to list your class would've helped for some to be more "memorable" :)
---
the most predictable thread ever.  hordelets are pathetic manchildren
---
Yeah well he paid for 300 upvotes so it’s gonna stay here
---
Signed up, remember some of the guild names but not so many of the Mannoroth players.
---
"I'm a giant potato and I'm not going to waste my time with World of Warcraft anymore"
---
Damn you! I was so sure that I'd play a undead priest and now I am rethinking rolling a dwarf priest ... 
---
I love DM but I thought the convenience Horde has with SM is just too good ...
---
Im a golden retriever.  Woof woof
---
Who is everyone? First time I'm hearing that it's specifically going to be today.
---
i think i did my first character in 15
---
I know right? And I love it personally. But then again though, you can just go back playing BFA to enjoy ultimate performance. And pet battles and battlefronts and other things you probably like too.
---
Simple yet effective
---
What if they announced it monday and opened up classic tuesday.. that would be hype af
---
TBC was huge for rogues because they got Shadowstep iirc.  
---
With that said, sub isn't a bad tree in vanilla.  It's arguably the best for 5 man groups because of improved sap, and for leveling it has really good opening burst with the 2 points in remorseless.  Literally premed-&gt;Ambush-&gt;Eviscerate.
---
I liked the diversity in quests that got added, instead of doing the same Kill 10, Collect 10, escort quests over and over
---
And yet in warrior weapon progression videos it's a hell of alot of staffs with spirit and int on em because the dps range is better. One day the hunter meme will die when everyone realizes hunters also in fact want gear sometimes and 99% of ranged weapons are also needed on by a god damn warrior.
---
&gt; “why should I play classic wow?”
---
Why *wouldn't* you?
---
This is like asking why you should eat food!
---
Most of my tanks were female humans and male dwarves so.. I mean I guess it could be important to look cool but eh
---
Imagine watching a show where the main character burps every 5 seconds
---
&gt;more the merrier
---
Yeah...no.
---
Humans, on average, are dumb, instinct driven, uncivilized, smelly, hideous animals, who lay waste to anything they come across. The more the merrier may work well at a family gathering, not so much in a video game. Name a game that is super popular, where the community doesn't suck.
---
I had this exact same problem. It wasn't even the download links for me - it was the key. These aren't shown anywhere on your account, and I had to find an email from 2014 to get it. 
---
I almost bought reforged just to get rid of this problem, but I decided not to reward them for having shit code.
---
I don’t know all the name in English :/
---
yes
---
Huh, I almost feel like that needs another dimension to it. /u/bterrik calls out the problem of rewarding guilds for effort on progress, for example how do you incentivize people to bang their head against a boss for hours when the payoff isn't there. Systems like Zero Sum DKP and Suicide Kings build reward based on loot dropped, where both LC and DKP can reward a variety of activities. It's almost a 2D grid of systems where one dimension is the source of "loot credit" and the other dimension runs from a purely mechanical set of rules to 100% human decided.
---
Premeditation isn't useless.  2 free combo points every 20 seconds is big.  Once you have premed and 2 points in remorseless your opening burst is amazingly high.  Ambush w/95% crit -&gt; 5 point eviscerate (usually).
---
You use a weapon swap macro for hemo so you don't have to rely on untalented backstab or Sinister Strike.
---
&gt;I just don't see why modern WoW can't have these "narrative" quests they currently use, and fill the zones out with kill/collect quests as well? You were always given a more story-focused quest in BC to do alongside the side-stuff anyway, it just wasn't as explicit as it is now.
---
I'm 30 and I still **love** doing dishes, such a calm activity
---
So many Cincinnatians in the comments! Who Dey and go cats!
---
This is me. I've played a warrior for so long I'd like to keep playing them, but I just started playing a spriest alot and absolutely love it. I've played melee, tank or healer but now adding a caster and it's making me question everything.
---
Reforged actually has a definite deadline for release - on or before December 31st, 2019.
---
I personally think this will come out long before Classic does, but I accept that this probably isn't what this board wants to hear. Just a feeling I have.
---
You may call it a classic battlestation, but it has been polluted by pictures of Duke Doggo and wannabe-Justin Bieber.
---
Replace those with Thrall and Bolvar, and you may call this a battlestation.
---
Rick - Gnome Mage
---
Morty - Tauren Hunter
---
Sure but that includes late September as a possibility. Which is pretty far off when we are all trying to wait patiently
---
Morty would be a gnome for sure
---
When everything was normalized (or most everything) it was a big indirect nerf to Barman Shankar.
---
Big part of why these (or most of the modern wow activities) are not-so-fun is because you can't fail at them, there's almost no situation where you can possibly lose and it's not as exciting to get/do something done when you know from the start you're going to win.
---
How long did it take you to think up this work of fiction?
---
She's his wife, not his mother..
---
Thoughts? I'm your huckleberry. Aka.. I'll be your rogue :)
---
The whole horse?! Damn you really can’t trust thotts these days smh
---
Maybe you u are having trouble to understand what i said.I never said i was right in my rpediction, i said i was way closer with the Blizzard's announcement that most  in here.
---
Q2  2019 is closer to summer  of 2019 than 2020-2021(Q1-Q2).It is not nuclear science.
---
The 7-21 July is about Blizzard summer release date and where i expect to fall
---
Green Posters literally do it FOR FREE
---
People watch dancing with the stars, shows where mothers parade their painted up preteen daughters on TV, reality TV and Jersey Shore.
---
I am pretty sure R&amp;M is far from being the most braindead TV has to offer.
---
I just appreciate a good cinematic.
---
At the midnight release of Cata, GameStop had a WoW dance-off contest to win the giant display boxes.  I danced my heart out doing the Tunak Tunak Tun dance (Draenei) in front of easily 100+ people and still only got second place.
---
Hahahaha that is actually a pretty good point. Number of steps I see a gnome take compared to the Tauren. From escape artist to war stomp I am stoked on it.
---
Kinda starting to lose interest. I can’t think of any reason to just not announce a release date unless somethings wrong 😞
---
Holy shit that sounds like gold, I’m surprised I never heard of it!
---
I only got 25/40
---
that's not really why betas exist though...
---
Thats not what he meant though
---
Our main tank was a gnome warrior. I cant remember all the exact cases but there were only 1 or two fights where his size was an issue. I know one of the dragons flamegore or ebonroc we had to change strategies because healers couldn't target him in the normal tank spot. 99% of the time it wasn't an issue
---
Instead of a new South Park we get a Rick and Morty WoW episode... sure I’m down.
---
I know was just taking the piss.  
---
I have 2 kids around the 10year old mark so any console that runs fortnite give me PTSD
---
Best way to go IMO! Should be new for all of us but understand some are in love with certain racials and classes. As for me, I just want something new. My first War stomp on a gnome is going to be tough..
---
Could you elaborate on the baiting of the mages blink a bit? What does that entail?
---
Feels oddly limiting, can't say you play both factions, reasons to play doesn't include anything with progression raiding or PvP rating
---
Please don't listen to your friend.
---
Nobody will care what your character looks like, so long as you can get the job done
---
Well I interpret very far off to be more than September. My theory for no marketing is they don't want to spend any money on it due to a lack of expectations
---
Let's not forget that those who played WoW over 10 years are mostly adults now. Naturally, most of those adults don't follow any gaming news at all. Much less Twitch streams and YouTube gaming channels. Yes, someone who used to play WoW with their friends is likely to tell them about Classic, but that's the exception rather than the rule. I agree that the announcement of the release date will get a lot more attention than Blizzcon did.
---
If you wanna stay ahead of the curve you should stick to Darkshore. Westfall will be way more crowded and an absolute shitshow. And as a night elf you have to get there first which will set you back.
---
Hell yeah
---
Not essential but gimped if you don't vs someone who does basically.
---
Vanilla wow for starters
---
If you want to play a game with matchmaking where you're forced to group up with that "average" person, then sure that sucks as it's out of your control.  Vanilla WoW gave you that control - you have the discretion to choose who you group up with, there's no queue it's just old fashion communication.  If you don't like so many people then ignore them. If you're complaining about a segment of community that doesn't impact you, then you're just looking to complain.
---
If they don't see you coming because they have a felhunter out.  Or don't know how to press the seduce button in their succubus.
---
Seeing your brain work is horrifying
---
Yay! Summer is in less than a month!
---
Also, they utilize cross faction cooperation to kill competitors.
---
Yes, since you don’t really make an “account”. It looks like all your doing is loading a name and an associated contact information into a database.
---
Yep, WoW will end up doing the same. They prob wont progress the first classic servers but start a new TBC or WoTLK server that progresses over time. 
---
I went back and did the nostalgia thing on Everquest while waiting for WoW Classic, was amazing and Everquest is way more grindy and brutal than vanilla WoW.
---
Maybe if you troubled to actually write down your thought process in the opening post, people wouldn't have to interpret your thoughts from some clumsily thrown together word-sald.
---
&gt;Q2 2019 is closer to summer of 2019 than 2020-2021(Q1-Q2).It is not nuclear science.
---
So you are proud you guessed right. Congratulations. Millions of other people guessed the same, they just have other things to be proud of in their life, so they don't feel the need to brag about being slightly less wrong than some others, to an anonymous crowd on the internet.
---
This is a classic wow reddit not retail.
---
*CHAIN HEAL INTENSIFIES*
---
Not literally everyone but there has been a lot of buzz on this subreddit, along with YouTube and among several discord servers.
---
Well raids are a whole different game, but as far as 5 mans go .. back in TBC I was always the group leader. I would form all the groups for dungeons and ensure the group was stacked in my favor. It took a lot more work.. spamming trade, hitting up the guild, etc.. but was the only way to guarantee no competition for loot.
---
As far as raids go, you just have to be the best! I was given the first glaive drop for being a consistent raider and top DPS. That's what I loved about the game..
---
Was the same story as a DK in wrath. I formed all the groups or was the best in raids.
---
I had 12mbit/s cable internet in 2005. *shrug*
---
It can get complicated, but the gist of it is that a mage can blink out of a stun, so stunlocking a mage is difficult. Basically, I’d never go all out stunlocking a mage unless I knew it was on Cooldown. You basically change your rotation a bit... sprint is important against a mage for sure (especially talented if possible). 
---
In Vanilla, my main was a mage and “main alt” was a rogue so I’m familiar with both.
---
On alliance side we had Tanks of All sorts. Most of them were humans and dwarves. Nelfs were pretty rare and gnomes even more rare. Dunno of this helps for your decision. I guess if it goes by your Argument, there should have been more Nelfs than anything. But that Was definitely Not the case.
---
Got 40/40 just because I read the top comments by "mistake"...
---
The zone north of the Thandol Span took me 5 minutes though...
---
I just bought a new Mouse and a new Monitor in preparation for this. I cannot wait.
---
Edit: I really hope it is in the summer months that my daughter is off school. Her and i are going to no life this so hard. lol Shes only 13, but damn, i cant wait to introduce her to a good MMO.
---
Agreed - however there are a few out of the way quests from Vanilla where they experimented with some quest mechanic one time that was used in a later expansion. I discovered a few when I was grinding the original Loremaster achievement in late 2008. Realizing that some quest in TBC or LK really had used the same quest mechanic from something in the AQ40 scepter  quests, or some obscure quest tucked away in a remote place that few people knew about.
---
One example was the quest in the Pirate cove behind Stromgarde, where you have to operate a gun mounted on the deck of a ship. Most pservers failed to implement this properly, btw.
---
surprised Vael is #1
---
The fact that the opening cinematic is the best part of BfA, only makes it more sad.
---
Troll and orc are the best racially for ranking, tauren hitboxes are larger making it harder to get out of aoe damage like venoxis
---
I doubt it, addons will likely start being developed as soon as beta comes out
---
Skill being equal, engineering will make the difference, regardless of class. So yeah, your call.
---
Let’s be realistic, no one cares about 8.2 gieb vanilla
---
It's not a random selection or something americans do to be different, it's the summer solstice.  It's how we have determined the changing of seasons for most of human history, before calendars existed
---
No it's Royal Rumble
---
How do shamans do as pocket healers? I'm a big fan of grabbing a skilled warrior and doing world PvP.
---
So you were less wrong that other people? Good job.
---
I think it's more about a, "creating it and forget it" mentality to deliver to the outspoken fan base that has clamored for the game.  If it picks up traction and brings in money, awesome.  If it doesn't, seems like a pretty low hanging fruit project from the start, so not much was lost.
---
&gt; that doesn't impact you
---
But it does impact you, and me, and everyone else on the server.
---
You can put the entire server population on ignore...they still run around, join and fuck over guilds, run the economy. You cannot not-interact with them.
---
It's funny but in classic the meme is going to be about warriors, especially now that we know how good some leather and mail items are for them.
---
So much fail...
---
My only regret in life is that I can only downvote this thread once
---
Then he didn't word his thoughts clearly enough. If you write something the semantic meaning of which lends itself to interpretation, you cannot sanely complain if you don't like some results of the resulting interpretations.
---
Virgin 1 def nh brid vs. Chad max main tribrid
---
This was also the first repeatable quest in the game iirc it gave no rewards but they let you replay it just for fun they were so proud of it.
---
Hard to quest with no quest NPC's =P
---
Classic when
---
1) Character model doesn't matter.
---
2) The main tank is rarely the raid leader because tanks have (arguably) the hardest job in vanilla raids.
---
3) Racials matter more in vanilla than they ever did. 
---
Racials aren't make or break, but if you've ever seen a a raid succeed and the tauren warrior dropped to 2% hp a time or two, it was literally his racial that saved the raid.
---
Jealous of the on-desk tower. Keep trying to find a way to make that work on my desk but I'd have to turn my whole desk around to make the transparent side of the tower visible. Plus my case has a fan on the transparent side and I dont want all that hot air blowing on me.
---
...wait a minute is that fan intake or exhaust?  Dammit I should know that i built the damn thing t.
---
I think it'll come out this year as well, but I doubt it'll hit before classic does.  I'd say probably a November release maybe?  Then again, War3's anniversary is July.  That'd be totally awesome if both games came out back to back.  Would help build up the hype but probably not the smartest business decision.
---
That's right, wash your hands, keep washing but know that the sins of your faction can never be washed away.  Remember how  Garithos’ contempt, racism and hatred of elves when dealing with Kael’thas destroyed relationship between Sin’dorei and Humans. Remember how Stormwind's noble elite denied their citizens payment for the rebuilding of Stormwind and cast them out without any consideration. The Defias Brotherhood was formed under Edwin VanCleef to fight against Stormwind's tyranny and take back what was wrongfully denied them.  So then YOU come along to murder them and cover up for the Alliance, you the faithful dog of the Alliance, never asking why you kill these farmers, architects, masons, and engineers who had to unify together to oppose Stormwind.  
---
Remember it was the Alliance that failed to heed the warnings of war and plague from the North and doomed Lorderon to undeath. Remember it was the Alliance that came after the Horde when they fled away.  The Orcs, Trolls, and Tauren just wanted to carve out an existence on the eastern continent and be left alone but unsated hatred drew the Alliance again and again to attack.
---
Naw mang, you gotta' finger it's butthole. That's the only way to really make sure it's still alive.

This is especially bad when you are on the Fp there and there is literally nothing you can do other than die the second you land lol.

Don’t lie

You looked him up in game and tried Ganking him to show him who the superior faction was

Hahaha

100/100
---
Tirisfal eluded me for a while, because I couldn't remember what the UD starting zone was called for some reason...  
---
The way I remembered most things were by traveling through the world in my mind. A zone would spring to mind, and I would think about what the connecting zones were.
---
Got em all in ~5, couldn't think of Moonglade until the very end lol
---
I get pumped when I see a Horde sticker and start violently pointing at it 
---
My GF is never amused when she’s also in the car
---
Most of what can be discussed has already been discussed about. That's just the truth of the matter.
---
This is all a matter of opinion. Find an old WoW player who believes Blizzard took the game in the wrong direction and ask them which expansion ruined WoW. Some people will say wrath, some people will say BFA, some people will say TBC. The one thing they can agree on is that Vanilla is great.
---
Yeah this place is gonna melt when substantiated release date is known.
---
He’s a double agent
---
Calm down my sweet summer child I’m about to turn 32
---
Wotlk &gt; Classic sorry
---
No I'll tell him once the game is announced.
---
I'm literally drooling for classic to the point where I couldn't even wait for Reforged and played vanilla WC3 instead. If it came out for War3's anniversary in July I think I'd cry with joy.
---
That would make them a cartel, not a mafia
---
If it's not an upgrade for the hunter then sure. Stat sticks.
---
you really need to take your meds and stop your schizoid ranting on the internet
---
I would love to play spriest, but trying to get gear for it is the biggest thing turning me off
---
Straight out of Moonguard's Lions Pride Inn
---
but now you get escort quests where they move at 0.1m per hour but will charge at every elite in 300 miles
---
Same but at the same time they are fun.
---
Thars savage
---
It ended. Just fanservice, CGI and cheap shock value now.
---
We used to do this as a guild event, last man standing got a free enchant, gem or item from the bank.  Always a great time!
---
I totally agree. Never had problems with Logitech. Always had problems with Razer.
---
39/40 FUCKING ALTERAC MOUNTAINS MAN
---
Yeah I think it will be huge.
---
Id do the same for you alliance pussies :3
---
Every dungeon/instance was bigger on the inside, i think the biggest obvious offender is scarlet monastery.
---
I doubt he's in deep shit.  Blizzard probably just won't invite him to exclusive stuff in the future if this actually bothers them.
---
He's also not the only one that's hinted at it.  Was it Towlie who hinted that people were going to be hyped about how fast things are happening or whatever?
---
In reality this is still hype building, and it's still not confirming anything so I doubt Blizzard cares too much.  If they didn't plan on releasing then, hen tips is the asshole and no skin off Blizzard back.  If they did plan on releasing then, it just is creating buzz and people asking "is this legit?"
---
According to the tanks I’ve talked to, the real draw for Tauren is the war stomp not the hp.
---
5% makes it barely worth
---
Yep. Cotton candy. A fun novelty, but it need to be rare enough that it's special and fun. It doesn't have enough substance to be an everyday thing.
---
For more than 12 years I've never been invited to a beta-test, so I don't expect it to happen this time. If yes, well, I'm going to test it for 1-2 hours per day and provide feedback. At least that's what beta-tests are for.
---
Sweet setup mate...looking at my own in comparison, I realized I need to get my shit together.
---
Blood and thunder, bro.
---
What is
---
wow classic beta cancelled confirmed
---
Surprised no one brought up the ole taunt pet and jump into freezing trap trick ;)
---
I don't know about US, but a huge lot of players are from other countries who use sane calendar and for them Summer ends at August, 31.
---
It depends on the sever tbh 
---
But I’ve heard this from lots of people 
---
I play Horde and I remember some inviting me over to a LAN party to level up and they were all in the 40-60 range and I was a level 22 
---
They literally helped me level up from 8pm to 4 am by just standing guard and making sure no one ganked me and I didn’t accidentally pull too many enemies as well as gave me lots of gear they no longer needed/used and hooked me up with a few gold pieces 
---
Such a fun night , I miss it
---
This is what I’m thinking
---
To build hype? To stop the studio having to crush to finish the project by a specific date? To ensure people don't lose interest in retail before the 8.2 patch? There are plenty of reasons to not announce a release date stop being dramatic
---
"resigning" as a community MVP lol
---
this shit makes the waiting a bit more bearable - love you guys
---
I wish I had money
---
On launch day, you and /u/provosorisk must choose the same server, and slapfight to the death.
---
worked for me, refresh
---
Very true.
---
It's hard, that's the honest truth. Popular class + PvP lovers class + only 1 maaaaaybe 2 spots in a prem for a Rogue = you're going to be pugging a lot.
---
After playing horde for a hew years I decided to give a Night Elf Hunter a try.  Everything was fine on Teldrassil, but when I moved to Westfall it was very strange seeing characters half my height running around all over the place.  I don't think I'll ever get used to dwarves and gnomes...they're just weird.
---
Well, sorry you feel that way but that's life.  You either have to accept the good with the bad or turn it all away and be left with nothing. 
---
There's no method to weeding those types out, but given the community is tied to a server there's some accountability so it's not far-fetched to think that'll happen naturally vs preventing access outright.
---
Not this season man
---
That would be Genius on Blizzards's part.
---
It would also explain why retail mainly content creators like Towllie are so excited:
---
Is this post trolling?  Did anyone actually read it?
---
Where did goldshire 2 go?
---
Why would people be surprised? If it's out somewhere between 7-21 July, July 16th will be extremely close to it if it's not released on the 16th itself. Sure people have speculated in August and September releases, but the most used date that's is commonly speculated in is July 16th. 
---
So it'd be about as far from surprising anyone as you could get if they release it around the most speculated date, or am I missing something?
---
Nobody uses those dates in my country, nobody knows about it. And it would be pretty dumb. June, 22 is pretty much summer in its glory. It's already +30 today, days are already summer and we are only in May. And September, 22 is where cold weather already starts. June, 1 - August, 31 is very good definition for Summer.
---
World does not rotate around US or selected European countries...
---
What class and race are you rolling? Your setup looks amazing!
---
I lol'd
---
$10 says hes really chris metzen on a secret return mission
---
Lmao crackhead logic wait what :p
---
Dang. That sucks you didn’t like 3. I thought it was amazing. Yeah some of the tactical decisions didn’t make sense but it was an hour and a half of pure fucking tension. I’m just super fucking pissed we aren’t seeing the conversation between Brann and Tyrion and Brann has overall been fucking useless. 
---
The pacing is really fast. I liked the earlier seasons where there were slow burn episodes leading up to big battles/twists. Now it’s like they are fast forwarding through the story to get to the end and it’s really doing a disservice to almost a decade of amazing story (in the show) and something like 3 decades of amazing writing in the books. This season should have been 10 episodes. Maybe then we could have had enough time to see Sansa/Arya’s reactions to Jon being a Targ.
---
You only have to have at least one full Blizzard license. Could be a WoW subscription, old copy of Warcraft 3 or Diablo 2.
---
As much as BR is overdone, it’d be toight if someone made a BR wow server. Bunch of level 1s slow fall off a zeppelin into dun morogh, 3x exp and consistent mob levels. Everyone is flagged as hostile to each other.
---
[I knew what it was, I just couldn't fuckin' remember what it was called.](https://puu.sh/DqsvP/6cb8f72e72.png)
---
I just visualized the world map in my mind and went from top to bottom of both continents, recalling flight paths and zone borders and such.
---
Low effort meme?
---
to be fair
---
I wish 8.2 wasn't a consideration, but I am afraid it is. They are going to be more strategic about Classic and deliver when 8.2 is getting stale (which will happen fast lol)
---
HOWEVER, you could argue that the quicker they launch Classic the quicker they are getting $14 a month from folks...
---
It's kinda funny, cause every time in every game I start as a tank, I inevitably end up as a dps. I guess that's not going to happen in vanilla, cause both prot and ret are less than desired in raids, and a bear is a little bit more preferred than a cat.
---
literal shills.
---
A manual override by a lower-tier officer sounds to me like a great way to invite drama when you could just use a better-suited loot system. SK is fine for casual use but I just don't think its cut out for serious progression.
---
See, now I might agree with you if they were taking the path of least resistance, doing a half-assed pass of the 1.12 client to make sure that it'll at least boot and then launching with little testing or development.
---
But there's no doubt that they've put effort into reverse-engineering the Live client back down to match 1.12 as close as possible.  That cost money and dev resources.  While I don't necessarily think this is a flagship project for Blizzard right now, it's also not a low-effort sandbag.
---
That makes sense, but I was thinking primarily of it's perks for leveling versus combat. Having improved and faster stealth, as well as better sap and vanish and a beefy ambush allows you to quest with a great deal of control.
---
Yeah he didnt know how any of it worked, and chose to argue with me anyways, likely because I made fun of an "elitist" warrior cool guy streamer
---
I got 39/40! The one I missed was STV...
---
How in God's name I remembered moonglade and deadwind pass and forgot STV I'll never know. Repressed memories maybe?
---
On the flipside, it could just be a shammie letting the guards kill themselves on his lightning shield so it doesn't flag him up.
---
They both are and aren't, if you can 1v1 somebody with all your cds over the course of a minute or more you can win with bad gear because evis doesn't scale much and is very good early, the thing is that is a tiny portion of pvp, if you want to do any sort of bg pvp you NEED gear because your openings are much smaller so you need those few seconds on target to count.
---
Thank you! I am rolling UD Warlock
---
Then, when you are bored and not being patient anymore, 3 scorpid spawn and kill this chicken in some seconds.
---
I'm getting wasted for free, my dude.
---
I have mained Rogue since I started playing in 2005. Wow PvP has never been about reaction time it's about game knowledge, prediction, and mind games.
---
It's not just about gouging blinks but also vanishing coils and blinds. Also, without batching, improved gouge talent means free on demand restealths which is more impactful than the other mechanics I've mentioned, so other classes should be very, very grateful that Blizzard is putting in the effort to get it right.
---
Lmao, to be fair though, you can't blame CM's for the lack of info, they're just doing their job and only posting as much info as they're allowed.
---
Dont most the expansions release Aug-Sep?
---
Tribalism. They didn't play during vanilla
---
The thing about healing for me - is that you get to decide who lives or dies in a "pick one"-situation. I have to admit I usually have a few people on a list who I'll heal last, atleast for farm-status raids.
---
Let’s break the marketing decisions down to basic finance; advertising on TV is a no-go (too expensive, not enough target audience watch TV), advertising on YouTube can be expensive, but as someone pointed out advertising through streamers is CHEAP and super effective because the people who watch said streamers are blizzard target audience with the highest chance to see a conversion (% of customers who view the ad/streamer content who actually purchase the product) now round up several large streamers and pay them to plug your product and now you’re trending on YouTube, twitch, social media, and bam, there’s your marketing
---
In equal gear levels - swords win across the board. Every hardcore raiding rogue will go combat swords. You may see some seal fate rogues but the top dps parses are all combat.
---
I won't disclose my sources but I was told there will be news at noon GMT+1
---
You’ll have to excuse me, I’ve grown quite hwheary
---
Blizzard always does that. When they say a quarter, it's mostly at the end of it. Legion was planned on Summer, too. We got it at the end of August '16. We all want to play Classic, but do not get your hopes up too much guys.
---
yeah let me build a setup and give another reason to my wife so she can divorce me
---
Let’s hope you’re right!
---
Anyone who's not a druid forgets Moonglade
---
My gut at this point says early August. But that’s also me wishing and hoping as I will be out of the country until August and don’t want to miss launch, even if it’s only a few weeks.
---
Hi, /u/lambo2011
---
wtf, when #nochanges gets downvoted. I.. I  don't know what to say.
---
You’ll be fine. Raids don’t even need a full 40 man roster.
---
&gt; mountainy one where there is a horde rogue 
---
Can't tell if Redridge or Stonetalon
---
I agree with you that SK is not cut out for serious progression, but my intent is not a system for a serious progression guild. I probably should have specified that in the original post, but I was going for more of a specific question on a single system rather than a general conversation around loot distribution systems.
---
That being said, I agree that giving a single override to an officer is definitely not in the spirit of avoiding drama.
---
Well, adapt the idea for your guild.  Could be a guild leader.  Could be a raid leader.  Could be a class leader.
---
And make sure they post a simple justification to the raid.  Just a simple, "We need to gear up our off-tank" or "Our hps is lacking so this has to go to our healers rather than our DPS."  If it's not abused and the justifications make sense, and that possibility is spelled out from the beginning with the guild loot rules, I don't think people will have issues.
---
If people are abusing it to give loot to friends, yeah, that'll create drama.  But that's a problem with pure LC too.  Simply, if you don't have fair-minded and trustworthy people in your leadership positions your guild better be bleeding edge at progression or you'll hemorrhage members.  People don't wait to game with biased, unfair leadership.
---
I wish this test had an actual image of the map with all zone names blanked out, maybe that makes it too easy but trying to remember 40 different entities for anything seems nearly impossible, at least for me. Even tho I know all 50 states it would be hard to name them all for the same reason, if that makes any sense.
---
1. No need to have "news". It *will* be 10-man.
---
2. Technically you can run other dungeons as raids early on, but it's unnecessary.
---
3. No, it wasn't.
---
4. No, it isn't.
---
there is an escort in unguro, near the volcano i think, where the npc walks at like 1/4 of walking speed
---
It would be foolish and wasteful to begin formal marketing now. To build hype for a product that has a finite life span for any given player AND has a free, current method of playing would be tantamount to advertising for private servers, which lessens Blizzard's profits in a few different ways.
---
The wise play is to push this into the general public's frame about a month prior to release. That's enough time for people to make plans but not so long that the marketing is a waste. That is what will happen. I'd expect that mid-July will see a swell of articles, videos, podcasts, Youtube/Twitch ads, commercials, etc. advertising a mid-August release date.
---
Correct.  Towelliee cons money from *adults* hoping he’ll say their name.
---
It should be 15-man and the rest should be 10-man. Not that you need to but it makes for quicker runs and faster to acquire gear.
---
Will this sub turn into HQG, where they only talk about meta?
---
Honestly, the only thing that would impress me is if blizzard would just pull a Respawn or Apple, and do a video on YT/tweet saying go download and play Classic right now.  Announcements of announcements, or rumors of announcements of announcements need to go.  We know it's in alpha, we know there may or may not be a Beta.  Give a date or just fucking send then and there and go live or gtfo.
---
You're comparing what's essentially passive marketing versus active though. There's no reason they can't do both unless they really don't think the project warrants the costs, which in and of itself is a problem IMO
---
Yeah that would be pretty cool. I wonder if on Classic it will again take skill as well as time to climb the ranks. On private servers you just have to play a lot and dodge the other premades. So quite a lot of r14s are actually serious raiders who need the weapons for top dps. I really hope dodging is not in classic.
---
Rhapsody-Dawn of Victory
---
Literally almost everything about this post is innaccurate. Literally no one gives a fuck about WotlK servers lol, and people were asking for vanilla servers literally right after BC came out so IDK if you started playing in Wrath or what but your info is garbage
---
My point is not that you shouldn't use SK, I think if you are going for casual than SK is fine. My point is that if your serious enough to be putting in things like manual overrides, your probably serious enough to just use a better system.
---
r/brandnewsentence
---
As someone else mentioned in another thread, that may be what they're going for.
---
There would be multiple benefits to releasing classic the same day they release 8.2:
---
1)  less stress from "tourists" in classic, which is clearly something they are worried about.
---
2)  great way to get a metric of how hype people are for classic vs retail.  If you release them at the same time you can see how many people from retail actually are playing/wanted to play classic, as opposed to releasing it at another time and they just play it to play it.
---
3)  Classic will draw a lot of people to resub, and with the hype of the new 8.2 patch, they may get people who will play retail from those who subbed primarily for classic. If they really believe in retail, then this could help get more people into it (though I doubt it will work out this way because classic is more engaging).
---
I think it would totally make sense to have simultaneous release.
---
Awesome! I'll be a Troll Priest myself. Can't wait! Maybe I should get my own cool posters... either way, for the Horde! :D
---
Was it Ringo? The goblin who collapses every few meter?
---
I may have phrased the title/thread poorly, I am not necessarily arguing for them to market NOW. I do hope we see some once there's more concrete info as far as release, similar to what you're saying.
---
I mean, all your argument revolves around your country POV...
---
That's not Dire Mauls loading screen.....
---
Great guide. Any chance you wanna do melee guides as well? Or maybe a warrior tank one??
---
This is my setup for Classic. Built a new Desk, got a new Roccat Nyth mouse (not pictured as it's still in the box) and bought an Acer Predator X34p (replacing the Dell in the picture) all in preparation for classic.

same my pc is 10 years old i still will manage to play classic with it but its a fucking mess of hardware
---
Yup, I told my old vanilla shaman buddy that my wife and I were going alliance this round, no hard feelings, and he didnt even know classic was a thing and got excited asking me what server I was on and he was going to download it right away! My heart broke as I had to tell him it is not out yet :(
---
Totally  agree, they can have their place. I do wish they were slightly more difficult or you could die and have to retry or something.
---
Warlock? Don't have to feed your pets! If you go slow enough, you don't really have to worry about healing or mana or... really anything. You could play them pretty darn lazily if you wanted to.
---
They're going with the 1.12 dungeon limits, so it's 10 man in Classic. This would also technically make LBRS a 10 man dungeon, although it's rarely run as such since it's balanced around 5.
---
It was never too hard to find 10 people to run UBRS on the uberservers, however how well that translates over to more vanilla-like server populations is anybody's guess. How popular UBRS is also depends on the loot patch. Early game runs will be dominated by melee, particularly now that we're starting with the insane stats on Brigham girdle. Later game it will be easier to get casters to come as items like the Ace of Beasts and Spellweaver Turban are introduced.

---
Caster class leveling can be pretty lazy overall: cast a couple of spells to pull mob and wand until dead. Warlocks seem like a good choice for you because the blueberry tanks for you, helping prevent you from having to push extra buttons if you get hit. You can even macro your opening spell cast with pet attack so you have fewer buttons to press. (Hunter is similar.) Priests have talents that increase wand damage and increase mana regen after a kill, so that lazy leveling technique is actually really efficient.
---
That's not a dog

The world does rotate around the sun,  which is what defines seasons, rather than the temperature where you happen to live.

As much as I hate USA and their freedomheit and their other medieval unit system, you are very wrong here. Summer has always started with summer solstice everywhere in Europe since Celtic times. All cultures in Europe used it. And everyone with even basic education or interest in things outside of his PC knows that.

Also, aggro much? Hope your warrior will be able to generate as much of it as you are capable of here.

Un’goro Crater doesn’t work.

It is, and it is underrated af for grinding.   Less crucial inside a dungeon for the tank though.  Taking it from the healer is pretty weak either way.

38/40.  Missed Moonglade because of course, and Hinterlands which shocks me because I’ve always played Horde and love that 1% hit trinket.

Yeah, World of Roguecraft, that started that whole meme, was early on. And most rogue pvp videos were against some really bad players lol. I still think they're strongish in 1.12, but it depends a lot on what class you're fighting AND what cooldowns you have available at the time.
---
I'm signed up. Already see a ton of old school Dethecus guys i remember representing. hopefuly more sign up and maybe alot of us can get on same server. i know several of us who did the rank14 grind on alliance will be playing. curious if many of the horde &lt;Months Behind&gt; guys will be doing the same.

Then it's treason.

I would prefer it to be in its own category on twitch so i don't have to sort through all of the retail streamers.
---
You could certainly argue that these quests are boring, but that they are used because the developers were lazy or run out for time? No, vehicle quests are almost certainly harder to get working properly, without bugs, than simple fetch quests or "kill 20 of these" quests. They are there to break the monotony, thats it.
---
Think there's definitely reason for cynicism, however pessimistic it may be.  Coincidentally, many of the design decisions we know of can be seen as the "easy" route (right or wrong).  I think it'll be very telling to see how they treat the game the first few months as there are issues with server population, bugs, exploits,etc. I'm just hoping it's something they're committed to and not a pump and dump/cash grab.
---
I don´t want to come across as some sort of asshole. But in western relationships, what is the daily alternative to "gaming for 3 hours before going to bed"?
---
Yes.
---
You and your girlfriend /wife / whatever sit side by side and passively watch TV, Netflix or some other shit on a screen while both of you try so hard not to overeat yourself with candy, coke or wine.
---
This is the reality in 7 out of 10 realtionships in the USA, Canada and Western EU.
---
And the rest won´t ever touch WoW or pc gaming in gerneral at all.
---
People, and especially men here, need to grow some serious balls and tell their partners to watch mass medias without them and stay away from the couch.
---
More people to roll against lol
---
3/4 pre-BiS is prob truly the answer you are looking for, most pre-BiS/BiS lists also have lower priority items.
---
What day?
---
You will die a lot with rogue if you play it like an afk-leveler. Mage you just press button. Hunters are easy levelers but you still have to press some buttons for traps/dots and command/feed pet etc. Warlock you just put a few dots on target and then tab out with pet pewpewing.

Their undead brains have turned to mush and the only thing they understand is Zug Zug.

We're in a post 1.10 world, the only "raidable" dungeon in Classic will be BRS.
---
10? It started as 15
---
Right?! I finally downloaded Brave for Android and now I'm fully adblocked on PC and mobile. I even had my wife get it for iOS. Amazing browser so far .. doing God's work.
---
It is getting postponed to Autumn

credit to moO_UK on twitch !
---
So let’s see the blue post with 1 word then...
---
Only 33.  Couldn't remember name of one of them.
---
Not bad considering it's been over 7 years since I've been in any of them.
---
For sure! I remember I had a 21" CRT Dell (Sony Triniton) monitor back in vanilla.

I am actually switching to a gnome warrior. If you war stomp me, I’ll make sure you’ll step on something sharp ;)

Begun, the dog meme wars has
---
There's no specific threshold.  When you're doing dungeons, aim for your BiS pieces but once you've got a decent loadout of appropriate greens and blues (not necessarily BiS) you can start trying to jump into a raid.  Early on, the issue will be filling out the roster rather than super-gearing.
---
If you do a little research of the fights, come prepared and on-time and have a decent understanding of your class with an open mind to learning more that'll be far more valuable that reaching a certain percentage of pre-raid BiS.
---
Once you pull a couple of epics, you'll find that BiS list matters less.  Keep doing dungeons occasionally to fill out the holes in your gearing (or to pick up offset/resistance pieces) and you'll be set.
---
Wrong
---
LBRS is 5 man right?
---
the ultimate showdown is the original mashup
---
If the lock has a succubus out it helps. Warlock pvp trinket doesnt break stun. if i can get one death coil off i usually win or they run away.
---
Oh god 4:3.
---
Ah I see where you were going with that, thank you for the clarification, makes sense now.
---
7,5 FPS, epic
---
*FPS: 7.5*
---
Oh god
---
There could be a few. Like "LEFT SIDE, EVEN SIDE MANY WHELPS, HANDLE IT" cut to logo and date.
---
34/40 This was harder than I thought.
---
The ones I missed:
---
Silverpine Forest (for some reason couldn't think of the name)
---
Duskwood
---
Hillsbrad Foothills (How do you forget this?!)
---
Desolace
---
Moonglade (Always forget about this one)
---
Awesome quiz though. It was a lot of fun to test the vanilla knowledge.
---
Massive frame drops, latency and keyboard turners.. definitely fan-made. Good effort though on the creators part. Shows how epic Classic was.
---
yeah i have to get a succubus out in the above scenario. i mean my friend does....
---
Looks like I'm going to need to downgrade my graphics card, for the Vanilla experience!
---
But of course we can't boost player caps in vanilla because #nochanges *rolleyes*
---
LBRS shares the same instance with UBRS, so it shares the same group rules. LBRS is however balanced around 5man and the quests in LBRS are not doable in a raid.
---
Druid is very fun in classic. Leveling, I normally level feral which will let me Tank/DPS dungeons while leveling, you could heal even with feral spec but its not really worth it to try IMO because druids are going to easily be the weakest heals while leveling (especially if youre not resto, which you shouldnt be because that would make leveling a nightmare cuz no damage and mixed specs arent really viable until 60 when you have enough talent points) as well as they only have 1 rez every 30 minutes. The combo of weak heals/limited rez can turn into a huge headache very quickly. As far as endgame PVE, i tend to go Resto and have plenty of fun. Swiftmend spec allows for a lot of movement while still putting out good healing which is fun for me cuz i can strafe and jump around while still holding my own as a healer. (ADD much xD) Feral is also viable in PVE endgame at 60 but does take a lot of effort if you want to be good (farming crowd pummeler from Gnomer for dps, leveling BS for heart of the mountain trinket for tanking. just a couple examples.) If youre looking strictly for the most utility/shifting/challenging way to play a druid, id recommend feral cat dps. You're going to be switching forms all the time to get off innervates, battle rez, pick up an add in bear form, etc. and can still do good dps. Be prepared to fully consume and bring multiple sets of gear to every raid though, AKA never have any bag space. There is a hybrid feral/resto spec you can roll at 60 but it isnt very optimal at all being in a 40 man raid theres enough players to cover all necessary roles so having characters that are specced to do multiple isnt very great. The hybrid spec can be nice in 10-20 man groups though and also in PvP. 
---
TL:DR Don't heal dungeons while leveling, feral tank/dps will be much better. Resto/Feral are the way to go at 60. Feral will be more "active" but also more demanding.
---
While I understand the cynicism, I feel the whole reverse-engineering concept was *not* the easy way.  So while I suppose someone could feel that way about individual decisions, I don't think the overarching design philosophy reflects that mindset.
---
BfA Client
---
30GB
---
Didnt I say that? I am confused
---
Oh those are all must haves, but deep sub is where they are pretty useless. Most builds ran a few points of sub but not many went 31points
---
You can tell it's EU when they start using letters like ó ł ę ż . How much I hated mailing anything to them out of fear I will make a typo.
---
XPerl was the best.

Just so everyone knows for those who might be new: Tips has lied about having insider info in the past.

Nice set up! Working on mine as well, just waiting to get a second monitor. Would love to see other people's classic wow battle stations as well.

Who Dey!

I feel like this undersells the coordination of it even. This was a large cross faction organized group of players who camped every spawn literally around the clock (they had constant organized shifts). If they found someone on the other faction they would camp them, if they found someone on the same faction they would have mages spam sheep making the mob unkillable until someone from their group from the other faction could come and camp them.
---
This wasn't a group of players who farmed most of the devilsaur, they controlled essentially ALL of the leather server wide and artificially raised price by huge amounts and withheld material. They basically used the same market strategy as the diamond industry.
---
For as much as they fucked over pre-bis for rogues and hunters it was an extremely impressive feat of coordination.
---
Nice cat

Get 4 mil and buy a bond you noob
---
i found this yesterday when googling for the same question - i found it very informative. its from a user called Thaudias:
---
^Holy Paladins are resistant. I think that's the key word here. Impervious to heal interruption and mana starvation, they rely mainly on a cheap, fast and weak heal (1.5 sec cast time). They also have a stronger, slow heal (2.5 sec cast time). Unfortunelty, its mana efficiency isn't great and the amount of health healed is, in my view sub-par compared to a priest (greather heal), a druid (healing touch), even a shaman (healing wave). They wear plate amour, which make them very able to handle every kind of physical damage. Therefore, they are powerful against Warriors, Rogues, Feral Druids, Enh-Sham, Hunter. In addition, they have a variety of buffs that can help every classes. In dire situation, they can pop their bubble which make them immune to any damage. 
---
^-&gt; A Paladin job is on the front line. Taking hits that others can't. Fast heal. Removing snare and roots. Mana isn't a problem. If damage is high on the group, they won't have any tool to burst heal. Being overwhelmed may happen then. They don't really have solutions if they want to flee, except bubbling and run, but it won't last long. 
---
^Priests (holy / disc) have a tool for every situation. Slow aoe heal, instant aoe heal, fast heal, slow heal, heal-over-time, a spell shield, even a heal after dying. They can aoe fear, dispel and burn the mana of an ennemy, which make them espacially nice against mana-user. Plus a good DoT, decent damage. While for a holy paladin doing damage is almost an impossibility.
---
^-&gt; Priest positioning is more complexe. They generally shouldn't be on the frontline, except when they want to aoe fear. They are vulnerable to all sort of physical damage, but in my opinion, they do great against spell caster. They can't flee, and mana can become an issue. They don't have the burst healing potential of a druid but definitly more than a paladin. 
---
^Restoration Druids are flexible and mobile. I think what they lack for average situations, they compensate in their great ability to turn the tide of a battle. Excellent healer in skirmish situation "hit and run" style (stealth included), they have without a doubt the best potential for burst healing. At the cost of burning their mana in few seconds, that being said. When the situation isn't critical, they will use a very slow, mana efficient, powerful heal. Their tool box is larger than a paladin but more narrow than a priest. 
---
^-&gt; Their job is to heal and run. And they are the best at it. They will cast HoTs, consume a HoT into an instant heal (Swifmend), or cast one spell which heal directly and add an hot (very mana inefficient though), instant heal, or if they have time a slow heal. When focused on, a restoration druid generally prefers to flee or morph into bear form (great amor and hp but no heal, which explain the use of HoT = they heal while moving). Their damage is non existent. Taking the right form at the right moment is hard to master. They have mana issue, but innervate helps a little bit. 
---
^Restoration shaman are offensive-static healers. Less armored than a paladin, far better than a priest. Less tool than a priest or druid for healing, more than a paladin. Best class for aoe heal. Some solutions for burst healing (one instant heal on cooldown), less than a druid. However a well geared shaman can be really dangerous unlike the others. They can purge buffs on a opponent (including druid HoT, paladin buff), interrupt spell, dodge spell, slowing the cast speed of an opponent, aoe snare, multiple aoe damage, and off course buff with their totems. 
---
^-&gt; A restoration Shaman won't really move. They are bound to their totems. Just behind the frontline, or in the melee for a fire aoe totem, they will aoe heal and maybe aoe damage at the same time. When attacked, a restoration shaman won't bubble/take in like a paladin, flee/bear like a druid, or fear/shield like a priest. They will be able to kill their ennemy (or at least try to). Mana can be an issue. Running away is possible with wolf spirit form, but not as easily as for a druid. Plus, they will loose the benefit of their totem. Doing damage will cost them mana that will not be used on heal.  
---
No it's certainly not true everything, don't want to devalue what they've done as there's certainly a lot of effort into it overall.  To your point, I don't think this is the case either, but irrationally I can understand the arguments and/or worry about it being the case
---
Yes!  I love this idea of a whole series of quick-cut ads based on the classic videos and moments.
---
"ARCANITE REAPER, HOOOOOOOO!" cut to logo and date.
---
Human weapon skill is nice in pve considering most of the best weapons are swords or maces.
---
I presumed they'd keep the same raid v. non-raid mechanics as they had in each step of Classic, like they're doing with staggered gear drops. But if not, then I guess 2 is incorrect. Again, it's kinda irrelevant anyway, since none of them need that many people even if it were possible to raid them.
---
I think I am gonna plan my questing route based on weapon rewards, I dont want to spend a lot of time doing dungeons pre level 55(dungeons after 55 often have some BIS even with MC)
---
How hard was it to 5 man UBRS?
---
What we know about the release date is "summer" and "second half of the year". With this in mind, beta is likely a minimum of 2 months if it starts this month. That is unusually short for a Blizzard beta, but not impossible as they have a bit less to test compared to a brand new expansion.
---
what a beaut!
---
U N P A I D J A N I T O R
---
Too bad crusader or agi are the better enchants cause it looks sick with a red glow
---
Where did you get those horde banners and your other posters if you don’t mind me asking? :)
---
Oh for sure - people are hyped, and worried about being burned.  It's totally understandable.
---
... for mobile game development.
---
Everyone needs a Bloodborne Machine.
---
They all moved to reddit.
---
Ok, my WoW background. I enjoy 2 things in WoW
---
- PvP (my classic Hunter had something around 50 000 honkrable kills) 
---
- Questing and getting to know the world. I treat it as reading a good book. I don't care about speed, I care about quality of it.
---
As for my pve progression I reached as far as AQ40 
---
As for RPG I play with my friends D&amp;D on paper (not to often as I'm 34 with wife and small doughter) and Evil Dark Side Star Wars Saga edition RPG 
---
As for my knowledge about Warcraft world I played all Warcraft strategies, WoW from vanilla up to Pandaria where I left it. I also like to read and my previous post comes from reading different wiki pages and so on so on.
---
Conclusion: I love Horde theme ... both as if I would be one or as if I would fight it. What angers me is lack of consistency in Horde story telling and again and again naive decisions made by leaders and while playing Horde I suppose to follow these decisions in quests and so on ... and I love lore and storytelling ... 
---
At the end I would like to remind that my original question was how is Horde storyline shown from inside perspective :) 
---
Peace everyone:)
---
He did that on a private classic server,  those have lots of wrong numbers, thanks to porting from burning crusade data
---
Quests give a lot more exp than they did in vanilla days (i think after level 40)
---
Back in the day? I’d say basically impossible unless people had like Full raid gear, there’s some big packs that need to be cc’d
---
Seriously. Find out what competing product will be out this summer. Theres your release date plus or minus a week or two. Blizzard does not release anything "by itself" anymore they always wait to maximize ROI against competitors. Does not matter if the product is finished they will shove it out to get ahead of competitors.
---
Looks like someone went to a certain crazy cat lady and got a Cornish Rex.
---
I never thought the most band wagon dude of them all would get information before the general public. Dude came out of nowhere and had no clue about anything classic wow before all this hype now blizz just feeds him info apparently. What in the fuck??
---
Is it a small closet or a corner of a room?
---
Either way, I'm jelly of that setup!
---
No exceptions.
---
Its treason then.
---
Should have just bought a game card from Best Buy.
---
Warlock, simply spam the 1 key to launch shadowbolts while your void tanks. Not optimal but will be easy and doable while multitasking.
---
That's a very good point. I'm not sure about it to be honest. Tranquil air totem gives a flat 20% threat reduction. Warlocks are known to over aggro. How much would they benefit from it? In an ideal world, it would be a straight 80%, it's probably not that high though. But it would definitely make things more comfortable for everyone that's certain. Raiding without the constant annoying fear of pulling the boss to you would definitely be a great quality of life.
---
If we were to imagine that 5 warlocks would only do 80% of their full dps potential each, that would mean that having one shaman works. It would mean going straight to 100% for 4 locks while having an healer for free. So instead of having 80% x 5 = 400%, you'd have 100% x 4 = 400%.
---
I don't think it's bad thing, even if the math is a bit off, just because it ease raiding. It's probably about right for mages as well since they can pull off some crazy numbers. The mana gained would probably be more significant for mages than locks though, since locks can just endlessly life tap. 
---
I believe the most important part of raiding is how much you enjoy it. Doing it mechanically in a guild with poor ambiance and annoying restrictions can be very heavy for something you do for "fun" and for hours and hours over years. And I'm not touching of how much it affects your own performance to raid in a boring guild.
---
So yeah, bring 6 shamans. Why the fuck not. Might stick an enh shaman in there right? Why the fuck not?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gc2PsL8XlrA A quick search and look. 6 shamans and you get a speed run of 51 minutes. Not bad. 
---
You could also use a shaman in the healer group for progression and switch it later to a caster group. They give an shit load of mana worth of healing spells cumulatively. I'm not sure on the math but let's see mh.. Mana spring gives 10 mana every 2 sec, improved by 25% let's round it up to 12... Lets imagine it's on a long fight, 10 minutes. That's 12x30x10 = 3600. Multiplied by the 5 healers, that's 18 000 mana worth of healing. Of course you have to add a 12sec Mana Tide that's 290x4x5 = 5800. So in total that would give you 23800 mana over a 10 minute fight. I'm sure it'd be great for any mana depend group.
---
Ho and it would be absolutely amazing for any shadow priest if your raid decides to get one.
---
What did he leak?? Tell us the story!
---
They are more islands than continents. If they’re only 14 miles high and maybe 4 miles wide.

40/40 with ~3 minutes remaining XD I spent most of the time trying to remember the name of the zone on the other side of blackrock mountain (Searing Gorge), and what zone druids could teleport to (Moonglade).

yes it does.

It was 15c this morning here, summer doesn't start for another month, so 30c+ weather is still away for us.

jk, cool room my dude!

I was actually surprised that Alterac Mountains was considered its own zone, one of the first few I'd tried since I was recently writing up a list of things to buy from limited supply vendors, and one happened to be in Alterac Mountains. I always thought it was just apart of Hillsbrad.
---
I did bwl and aq40 farm, then naxx progression on a rogue about a year ago. I was on a relatively low pop server, so raiding guilds were more eager to have someone who would log in than picky about class balance. I had a lot of fun with it. It was occasionally frustrating that I couldn't tank dungeons like a warrior, but in raids I preferred the threat control you get with rogue (feint and vanish) to fury, which I played in vanilla. I always hated having to stress about threat as fury in a raid.
---
Obviously your damage ceiling is lower on a rogue with top end gear though. The farther along in progression your raid gets, the less they need to bring rogues.
---
Is the second keyboard for the PlayStation?
---
Oo! OOO!!!
---
Just realized my vacation starts at july 17th. Now thats lucky :3
---
Thought there was gonna be a dog drawn on it...
---
Hot take: I love variety quests.
---
It reminds me of games like Banjo Kazooie and DK64 with minigames being thrown into the mix. Spices up the gameplay and serves as a fun distraction.
---
If you dislike them, that's cool, but I'm one of those people who loved Ulduar for the Flame Leviathan.
---
Fake

That was fixed a while back (~ Mar 2018). All recent builds have accurate quest XP.
---
Joana's quest xp rewards from his new test run were accurate to his original.
---
You ever see the adult version by the same guy?
---
In hindsight i knew it was its own zone but I tried putting in The Shimmering Flats like 10 times cuz i didnt realise its actually thousand needles
---
This UI is not that bad, you should have seen mine !
---
And you have the excuse of having a 4:3 screen, me I had a 16:10 and still had a cluttered UI ...
---
Sadly I didn't keep screenshots of it. I kept screens of a lot of things (players that would PK me, but not my raid UI \^\^ ).
---
All of the revamps have been lame. They're filled with trigger events that bug out half the time. 
---
I'm mostly looking forward to old SM. They did those dungeons a massive disservice in MoP.
---
Neat
---
Yea, sorreh =(
---
All the class posts have just had flavor like that.
---
The ability to have permanent servers where I can complete all reps, years down the line and go for BiS on my main is going to be one of the best gaming experiences ever.

When someone tells me summer, I understand it's from June 1st to August 31st, not any way other. If you talk SUMMER in business where I work, it also means from June 1st till August 31st.
---
In case the downvotes didn't answer your question, that's a big ol' Nope.
---
I hope they release it on the solstice. Like, the first day of summer: BOOM! have some wow classic. I have unrealistically high hopes.
---
I was certain Dustwallow was called Duskwallow. TIL.
---
I’ve tanked as Taurens, orca, humans, blood elf’s and undead. I can tell you nobody cares what you look like as long as you know what to do. All you gotta do is lead the path ahead efficiently and not die. People don’t care about anything else.
---
Agreed. Any real premade that's ranking will only have 1 rogue... SOMETIMES very rarely 2 if someone needs to drop due to honor issues, or w/e. They really aren't that great, and don't contribute much to BGs.
---
We had like 3 rogues trying to get into my premade on nost (who were rank11+), but we would only take the best one, and typically if he wasn't online, or done ranking, we would bring another hunter/mage/warrior.
---
Any WSG team that had more than one rogue was borderline free win for our premade, and the ABs that had 2 or more were a lot easier to win as well.
---
tldr: It's gonna be very hard to get invited to a premade as a rogue, especially early on, unless you're actually really good.
---
Source: did the grind in top alliance premade on nost

Literally had to watch this three times because I thought he was eating a sandwich.

Actually seems like a win for the bottom line. The tourist problem will be huge. Putting out fresh content for BfA gives the first wave of Classic only players an opportunity to get rolling, then when BfA hits its next drought BfA players can give it a shot. 
---
Also, those of us getting back into WoW for Classic will be getting access to BfA at a time when there's a lot of activity on those servers, so new Classic players dipping into BfA will see an active world and not one with people just waiting for the next content to come out.
---
Is he eating a hogie or sucking her foot?

100% under 5 minutes. As a Horde player, remembering all the individual badblastedseearingorgelands took quite some time. I still can't really tell one from another. Also dustvallow/wetlands/swamp of sorrows I only remember by name, but I can't 100% remember which one is which.
---
What day because noon gmt1 was 7 hours ago
---
I had a small 25 ft² room available so I turned it into my gaming den
---
Oh. Oops lol. SAME.
---
What makes you so sure that you'll have beta access to begin with
---
Holy fuck these are pure modern day lazy shit quests.
---
I was stuck where you are. But then I read something about Alliance. Apparently when you play Alliance and hit 60, you will have a bigger friend list. I've dabbled on both sides and it seems like Alliance players are just more friendly. I have had so many horde players treat me like ass in the game that it's going to be fun fighting them this time around. I will still feel bad about the Tauren though. They always were my favorite.
---
Cannot wait to entrance VC\* again :))
---
If you're on mobile use the Brave browser. I installed it yesterday and am kicking myself for not doing it sooner.
---
Pff, look at these Alliance who think they're so clean... y'all created the Lich King, don't even get uppity with me
---
fta
---
Perma subbed since 2006 and have had early beta access to every expansion ever since
---
Levelled a bit of everything back in vanilla. But only got an orc warrior to 60. Now I want to play human mage, which is also my main on retail. But apparently a bunch of my friends are planning to go horde, so ehh... Might end up going with orc warrior again, orcs are the only race I can really stand in the horde (troll is okey too, but I don't want to play one). Or I might abandon my friends, I dunno.
---
The expansion that introduced LFD, heirlooms and modern day welfare epics? lul
---
Wotlk is the most overrated expansion out of all of them. It's singlehandedly responsible for destroying wow and turning it into what it is today. (Cataclysm only continued the trends that wotlk set in motion.)
---
Literally the only reason that it had as much players as it did is because vanilla and TBC gave wow so much momentum. (Momentum that wotlk stopped, btw.)
---
Thanks! This is exactly what I was looking for
---
But shaman is more needed, despite the popularity. There can be twice as many shaman as hunters and it will still be easier to get a raid spot as a shaman.
---
Not to mention that's like, the dumbest advice I've ever heard.
---
"You need to LOOK like the tank and raid leader"
---
Like, what? He could have at least gone for the "Larger tanks are easier to click" argument for healers or something. But a clearly subjective statement about looking the part is just ridiculous.
---
If I were you I'd play Horde just to experience the difference
---
YIKES.  Towelliee seems like the kind of guy that watches the FYRE documentaries and thinks FuckJerry is the protagonist.
---
No you dont need BIS. What the "Content Creators" should really be doing is telling you what the top 3 or so options are--and having analysis.
---
For example, the level 50 quests, as a warrior, the Helm is pretty damn good alternative to LionHeart--so if you dont intend to make Lionheart, Helm of the Executioner may serve you well until Helm of Endless Rage in BWL. However, Diamond Flask gives a unique effect that will be useful further into the game than BWL...

Meanwhile there is the Fordring quest from the dude on the banks of the river in EPL. He gives a fury warrior necklace and a prot warrior chest--you have to choose. Well you will upgrade or find a near upgrade for the neck in blues or a real upgrade in epics, how long will you use the prot chest piece for if you arent going to make Enchanted Thorium (Especially if you are like tank #3/4--you wont get a quick T1 chest, so when called upon to tank, youll be using more of your preraid prot items for longer)
---
IMO blindly telling people to get "\_\_\_ of fiery wrath", or presuming that every dps warrior will farm the arena for a rare drop or pvp rank/rep isnt realistic for all people.
---
A solid list of 3-4 items for each slot showing different hit/set combos that work would be ideal.
---
Then there is the issue of raid vs world(pvp) gear. Robes of the Exalted are great in 5 mans or raids, but you wouldnt solo in them as a paladin. Youd take advantage of your armor class and use Plate of the Shaman King.
---
That's all the free time they have!
---
Some items will never drop or drop once and be attributed to someone else.
---
If an item is BIS it just means there's nothing better than that (in your current raid tier) so it's an ideal to get but you'll probably have to settle for less.
---
Pre-raid bis is particularly stupid since the items are BIS for a lot of classes and since you usually don't do most of your dungeons in guild you can't guarantee you'll win the roll.
---
Maybe it used to be this way but currently it seems like it's flipped.
---
Then you're an idiot.

---
I love the memes , they drown out the stupid question like DO YOU THINK THEY WILL REMOVE “insert random BFA thing that wasnt even in Classic” FROM CLASSIC IF NOT THIS WILL RUIN THE GAME!
---
Ive come to the conclusion that I know about 60% of them but cant spell for shit.
---
Replied to wrong guy and didnt read your post.
---
Ill leave it though to display my shame
---
Just curious, why do you hate Discord? I remember the painful days of hosting a vent server *and* a TS server, because people were so stubborn in which one they would use, so I had to have both.
---
Discord feels like it solves all those problems, and is pretty simple to use (IMO).
---
It's essential if you are taking PvP seriously.
---
Most of the classic PvP metagame revolves around the massive amount of consumables, trinkets, and engineering items in the game. You are going to get completely smashed by people using these items if you aren't. 
---
Can you do PvP and have plenty of fun while also being effective without this stuff? Of course, but if you are taking it seriously then you are going to get engineering. 
---
If you plan on doing PvE tailoring is required.
---
Have you ever played a mage in a raid?
---
Got 40, had to go back for ashenvale
---
I smoke enough weed to kill an elephant before GoT this season, it helps numb my brain and get some enjoyment.
---
Oh this was a few weeks ago and then a week after that.  I gave up
---
Nothing of what you said has anything to do with adding subscribers or keeping people subscribed.  Its logistical issues.  They make more money by staggering contenr releases.
---
???
---
I have no opinion on it either way. If it's the same category I get to laugh at all the classic streamers having a higher view count than retail streamers.
---
If it's own category I get to laugh at classic wow having higher total viewers than retail wow. 
---
Either way I win.
---
Jebaited btw
---
36/40!
---
\- Forgot Elwynn Forest, Stonetalon Mountains, Redridge Mountains, and Thousand Needles
---
The horde banners are actually two beach towels. Bought them in the Blizz Gear Store 8-9 years ago. Same with the posters. No idea if they still sell them though.
---
Choosing not to use engineering in PvP is intentionally putting yourself at a disadvantage
---
I think I saw a YT videos a few months ago, they were 5 manning it but they were in T2 gear.
---
Knowing how much I struggled with that sorting mail quest to get the mailbox toy... I cannot name them.
---
Wait that's a foot!? Hahahahaha
---
I heard the tales.
---
I'd take these over "mom, do we have _ at home?" memes any day.
---
Well done!
---
Just get an Orb of Deception and play a gnome.
---
Do you want to just play PvP like a normal person, or do you want to release HARDCORE VIDEOS with a banging track LET THE BODIES HIT THE FLOOOOOOR
---
And you sound like a baby ;) but don’t worry, I’ll lay you down for a nice dirt nap in STV soon enough! 
---
For the Horde!!
---
I'm just expecting the end of September so I'm not let down. We've already waited this long.
---
Hi, /u/Raaaaaaph
---
More responsibility.
---
The two factions are bound to have cross server cultural differences because they mostly appeal to two different subsets of thought,and perception in an individual. 
---
Horde is disorderly yet bound through strength against struggles. They are brought together and made by life or death, they literally need each other to fight against the odds of survival in harsh wildernesses. They value shamanism and nature over law and order. They are rag tag, raw,uncut,and thrown directly into the midst of azeroth. This will attract people who feel that way in real life or appreciate these things.
---
Alliance is orderly, and a very organized civilization. They value law,order and intellect . They experience some tough wilds but they do not live directly in it, they aren't one with it - their cities are so mega and symmetric that they have their own largely functioning civilization to shield most inhabitants from the natural world - colleges,libraries,engineering,trams,stoneforging. This will attract people who are into the familiar, people who enjoy these values and want to be apart of a fully functioning traditional civilization.
---
Horde and alliance in game is basically like comparing European society back in the day to say, African tribes,Mayans,or nomadic warrior tribes who value shamanism,hunting and rites of passage vs. Developing high end technology and studying architecture.
---
WTF. I thought he was eating a burrito, but he's sucking on her foot?=!+!"
---
When UBRS was current content back in the day, raid gear wasn’t out yet
---
Shaman takes a unique level of mastery because there are so many options in terms of offense versus defense. 
---
Your warrior friend will love you for windfury totem though.
---
How casual can one be and still be in a naxx quality guild? A few hours a night? A few hours a few days a week?
---
uh excuse me sir did you just imply a blizzard employee would use the nazi frog?  👌👌👌👌
---
It's because you only need 2-3 tanks per raid, so most warrior roll DPS so they get raid spots.
---
You think about it and there are say 3 tanks for every 40 people. Thats less than 8% of the server should be tanks.
---
Demonology is one of about four things I actually like about modern WoW. It has a unique feel and I really enjoy the mechanics.
---
Can't wait for classic release date to drop...
---
So I can stop refreshing this god-damned mad house. This subreddits memes and posts are making me insane. If it doesn't stop soon, I'm going to start posting my own low-quality memes and gifs. Don't make me do that. I've never done that. I don't want to start.
---
Also there are some iconic lines from bosses like "too soon executus, what is the meaning of this intrusion" I feel like we are doing some blizzard marketing interns job right now
---
"Less is more"
---
The real test here is spelling.
---
Fear.  Its an untimidating role.
---
Easier than healing though in my opinion
---
My first thought as well
---
Really not that bad for a vanilla UI lol
---
Funny thing happened to me in TBC with tank model size, although I can't think of any Vanilla raid mechanics that could be similar.
---
Was tanking the Lynx boss with a Taruen and a Belf, the one where he had a frontal attack that would be split to the two players in front of him. However the Taruen MT kept dying to the lash because my dumb ass was standing inside of his hit-box, and the cleave detection wasn't seeing me.
---
Maybe this would be an issue on 4HM with the meteor damage, causing problems if you had a lot of undead sitting inside of Taruen, but that's pretty niche.
---
Point being, character model size is pretty much irrelevant. Frankly I've seen more guilds proud of their tiny gnome or rare troll MT as some kind of mascot instead of the more conventional human/orc that people think of.
---
It’s a private server neckbeard thing, they all think all us retail vanilla players were complete noobs. 
---
I was in a kt killing guild in retail. I was an average player but my guild was stacked with elite players, some of which made famous pvp videos. They knew their shit, knew how to min max gear and consumables. 
---
Private server guys just think they are better even though they had everything easier.
---
I played EverQuest for 4 years. While the giant ogres looked a lot cooler as tanks than the halflings, the little asslings still got the job done.
---
How much commitment does it take per week to be in a good guild and get full T2? I'm talking hours per week. Also, how many weeks would it take to get full T2 with all the rogue competition?
---
Classic.
---
Hunter : while levelling make a macro that sends pet and autoshot (you can add a few other abilities in the macro like hunter's mark and serpent sting but it's not necessary really).
---
So you select a mob, press your macro button 2 times and your done, the mob will die without anymore input from you.
---
If you find a casual guild that don't care about your DPS you can even do that in raids !
---
They might ask you to kite sometimes. Just botch the job and they'll ask another hunter \^\^
---
The XP bonus probably wont be in classic at the beginning. Maybe later on, but I doubt it will be there for launch. Would change the whole dynamic of speed leveling.
---
Activision cited a Q3 release in one of their last business reports. Not hard to find if you search. 
---
It's coming in August or September.
---
Moreso, with RAF you could easily have an additional Classic account essentially for free as you wouldn't be constrained by whether or not you own expansions.
---
40/40, with moonglade stumping me for a solid 3 or 4 minutes.
---
Yes! I have always wondered why they don't see the potential of half afking in stuff like this instead of just standing in Ironforge. It would be so dope to sit there and bet on people. Would be a really good way to build community.
---
People did that all the time on US realms too, what a pain haha. I had a reference sheet for ascii codes on my desktop.
---
It's in the cards.
---
Written rogue guide is up on my blog already ;)
---
We don't have summer in business where i work, we have Q1,Q2,Q3, and Q4.  
---
Where BLIZZARD works, summer begins June 21, and the world (of warcraft) does indeed revolve around THEM
---
When you fuck up as a Warlock, or a Mage, there is less dps.
---
When you fuck up as a healer, the other healers have more trouble.
---
When you fuck up as a Druid...well...nothing happens (some Priest may need an extra Potion).
---
----
---
When you fuck up as a tank, the raid dies, and everyone notices.
---
Timing seems awfully suspect given the possible implications of using RAF simply for Classic access
---
Honestly, this is a pretty clean UI compared to a lot of vanilla UIs that have been posted on here 😂
---
Only 20k? That can't be good for business, thought I'd see a bigger number than that.
---
I've played tank since Wotlk. Since I'm at least decent at tanking I always have plenty of people to play with and generally don't pug stuff. At times I've been short on time and had to do dungeons with randoms to get a daily or weekly objective done and I probably wouldn't tank if that was all I did in game. Most people are fine but with a group full of randoms you generally get 1 retard that ruins the experience and somehow they always seem to be the most vocal about how much the rest of the group sucks. As tank or healer you are generally blamed by those people and its just not worth having to deal with.
---
I'm pretty sure this is the reason.  If a DPSer screws up, no one cares unless it's really bad.  If the healer screws up, no one cares so long as the MT lives.
---
If the MT screws up, it's probably a wipe.  That limelight appeals to some, but drives more away.
---
I used to fear tanking and healing until I finally forced myself to tank in WotLK, sure - its a lot of responsibility compared to dps (at that point atleast, nowadays dps have some important things to deal with aswell).
---
However, after both healing &amp; tanking, i cant go back to being a dps grunt again.
---
What year ? \^\^
---
Well Stonetalon Mountains is all the way over in Kalimdor, and I did say HUMAN, so yeah, I was thinking about Redridge :D
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one!  I hate that shit!!  Every time I would hit those quests while leveling I would get this sense of "uuuuugh why am I even playing this crap??"
---
This mattered a lot more in 2004. And it didnt matter then. 
---
What you look like has no bearing. Id follow the checkerboard error cube into a fight just as well as a fem gnome is the guy behind the controls knows what he is doing.
---
Pserver guys are like the kids you met in highschool that thought they knew about sex because they jerked off longer than you did lol
---
No shiv in vanilla, so it's all up to RNGesus.
---
I hope so!  These ideas are great.
---
Bet its gonna come out last day of summer... rip
---
I hope it at least comes out before my week off.
---
This is exactly why.  Most fights need 1 tank, some need 2, very few 3, and only one needs 4.  
---
But in 5 mans you need 1/5 people to tank.  Most people just playing would rather play the spec they raid as, rather than dropping 50g to tank something in dps gear.
---
Wat
---
I for one can not wait to see tauren and orcs side by side laying invading humans to rest.
---
Rick would be a Horde mage for sure. He's smart enough to realize that the Alliance are the real bad guys.
---
Yeah! My old 2nd gen i7 w/ GTX580 was on its last legs (but still played HoTS!)
---
Ended up building a new computer so I could have a reliable one for Classic, went a bit mad on the RGB: https://imgur.com/a/fGGbjSC
---
2nd screen is mandatory for PC gaming in 2019, especially with a game like WoW.
---
Late 30's here too.  I'll be back, two kids and a wife later, but I'll be back*.                  
---
*(As much as I can be)
---
This has been my feeling about the show since around season 3
---
Its just numbers. Has nothing to do about responsibility. Some people don't like having the responsibility, but a majority of the reason is number.
---
Was RAF in vanilla? I remember using it in BC and Wrath I believe.
---
Most high pressure
---
Arguably slowest levelers assuming warrior, druids are faster but are considered weaker tanks
---
They aren't very good at end game grinding, making them poor choices for your main, and time/gold sinks for alts
---
Highest cost, since their consumables are essentially mandatory and therefore more expensive than other classes. Plus, higher repair fees
---
Difficult to get raid spots as a main tank. Most main tanks are guild leaders, because they're the cornerstone of the guild in terms of gear. Easier as an off tank for sure
---
There's only one class that can main tank (again yes there are feral druids but not many guilds are going to let them main tank, and you'll maybe have 1 feral OT).
---
True that true that!
---
Get gear that's good for your class, doesn't have to be BiS. A few BiS items would be great over none, but neither will stop you from getting into a raid with others. Unless it's a super elitist group.
---
Im often ashamed to be european because of edgelords like you hating on the US
---
I started as a hunter and quit and then later made a mage couple months after. I pvp'd as mage until cataclysm and then made the switch to holy paladin. Now I'm a healer.
---
I'm rolling shaman because I wanna be horde so I can't roll pally.
---
?
---
You don't need expansions right now for additional accounts. I have 5 accounts, only 2 have BFA.
---
With the exception of Garr, but most guilds run 4 warlocks for banish and the fury wars off tank adds
---
Because they are the least specs... (not correct grammar but I want to keep it parallel).
---
DPS: 19 horde / 18 alliance
---
Healz: 4 horde / 4 alliance
---
Tanks: 2 horde / 3 alliance
---
Now... combine this with the fact that most people bear tanking isn't good enough. It's basically play warrior or gtfo as horde. 
---
Further... there isn't as much "class fantasy" for tanks (baring the difference between warrior / pally). It's just ... wear heavy armor, hold a shield, take hits. DPS especially allows for more flavor ... there is huge difference between the "flavor" of rogue, mage, and hunter, even though they all have the same "role."
---
This is, in my opinion, one of the small flaws of WoW. They could have made a tank spec for Shaman (they kinda did?) or even Hunter (BM?) or even rogue or lock. But they did not. When you limit the options by that much, for such an important role, obviously there won't be many!
---
It wasn't repeatable originally.  Bunch of people enjoyed it and wanted to do it again, so they made it repeatable a couple of months after release.
---
and miss out on Barrens chat?
---
Exactly. So as long as you have game time on an account you'd have Classic, BFA or not.
---
Soon
---
Do we really hope for more?
---
Oh my god, seeing all the old guilds... Right in the feels.
---
Typed in every name I could remember from my old vanilla group.
---
 0 results. Feelsbadman.jpeg
---
Nah, you can have DPS warriors tank garr adds. You can probably even have rogues tank adds on garr.
---
Obviously all data surveys are to be taken with a "grain of salt". I can't find any other data sources that dispute this though. I mean, it's hard to dispute that the Warcraft playerbase through TBC was not made up of "kiddies". MMO's at the time were played, on average, by adults. There is nothing that shows this isn't accurate.
---
It was not, however it would have implications if Classic came out and the RAF system were left as-is.  You could recruit a "friend" (yourself) into another account and be given 30 days game time.  Now if you were looking to play retail you'd have to buy BFA, but if all you cared about were Classic you'd instantly have access.
---
Yeah I put that in as well to no avail XD
---
It took a dozen years and contributions from a ton of people to get a working Vanilla server.  It's not "a couple people"
---
meh the hype builds with every blue post IMO
---
so RAF has 0 impact on this. $15 a month per account is all you need - with or without RAF.
---
Here is my take, the main reason? Only one class is viewed as viable... Sure paladins and druids can do it but they have some stigma, especially paladins. Tanking 5 mans as a warrior actually takes focus, unlike just jumping in as DPS. 
---
TL;DR - Only 2 and a half classes can actually do it. This is probably the biggest factor. You have the most pressure on you. Gear might play a little factor. A lot of warriors that want to DPS in raids will want to roll on the DPS gear. If you are a rogue trying to get a tank warrior, have fun.
---
The only Logitech mouse I've had fail on me was because the rechargeable battery died.  All the other Logitech mice I've used from the late 90's were replaced from an upgrade, with my current office mice being over seven years old at this point - and it still has a week or so charge in an office environment.  The only Logitech hardware I've had issues with are the headsets.  The Logitech keyboards I have used are rock solid (although I'm currently gaming on [https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-us/products/keyboards/natural-ergonomic-keyboard-4000/b2m-00012](https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-us/products/keyboards/natural-ergonomic-keyboard-4000/b2m-00012) as it helps avoid carpal tunnel issues and I think my reaction speeds have increased once I adapted to the keyboard).
---
The wireless Razer Epic Naga I had basically became wired because the battery life went to "won't last through a gaming session" within two months of owning, and lost the ability to detect Y axis movement about two years after getting it.  Even the Razer software is strictly inferior to the Logitech G600 software... from my experience, Razer is just all hype no quality.
---
I don't think RaF was introduced until TBC anyway.
---
Something something over the top rope something something both feet.
---
36/40, i am playing on private servers, so its a shame :(((
---
We went from have no threat reduction to something atleast, I guess Blizzard really wanted to point out that if you were raiding on horde you were raiding on hard mode.
---
I'm actually confused lol, you're still paying for the monthly fee which is all they're after.   
---
You wouldn't have access to Classic if that account didn't have an active subscription.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bn10iq/recruit_a_friend_going_awayfor_classic/en1brnr/
---
I was so confused when they talked about remastering it. It doesn't really need it and honestly what they did with it doesn't really have a Blizzard vibe. Arthas gives me a weird knockoff Asian vibe.
---
I think the cooldown on premed in vanilla is 2 minutes, not 20 seconds .
---
Once a healer, always a healer.
---
Oh yes, it absolutely has something to do with the responsibility.
---
adult version..?
---
I signed up awhile ago. Sad that I'm not seeing any oldschool Horde Gone Wild era players sign up from Kel'thuzad. Hopefully, once that release date drops, there will be a flood of people.
---
Within the first month? No, you'll get raid spots even with over half of your gear in leveling greens because the other speed levelers are just trying to fill 40 slots.
---
A year in? Most people will have already been raiding, and so you might need to prove yourself a little to get a spot. Having full BiS or mostly full BiS shows that you know what you are doing and can pull your own weight even though you haven't been raiding.
---
It depends on what phase we are in and how geared everyone else on the server is honestly. But even then, the lists aren't "you need all of this gear" but "hey this is the best gear you can get and it's from dungeons/quests/crafting so grind it as fast as you can".
---
Mulgore is the best starting zone of the horde. I love orcs and really want to duo an orc warrior and shaman with my gf but we're leaning heavy towards tauren. It was my first character I got into heavy back in vanilla release. Just spawning in camp N immediately made me feel proud as a character.. ya know of the history and where I started and just threw me into wanting to pave a path in fighting for muh people and the horde within 2 hours. Orcs and tauren are my favorite races in game.
---
As much as I hate horde.... This is dope.
---
This is my favorite gif in the sub. It’s so perfect with the chat in the corner. I keep coming back and watching this and sending it to people. God it’s so perfect, if you have played long enough you have definitely or will eventually see this exact thing happen.
---
I thought about lock - but going Paladin.  The idea of having to grind before raids for Soul Shards and having a Soul Shard bag really made me re-think things.  Same for Hunter (arrows/quiver).  Maybe I am just lazy though lol.
---
Ya this is high quality stuff. We aren't use to this king of top shelf effort
---
WotLK is really good.  I think all 3 of the original expansions are amazing in their own right.  Patch 3.2 is kinda bland, but with a quick release schedule it shouldn't matter.  The dallies were fun.
---
Was it not 40? I recall much more than 15.
---
needs more cats
---
I literally talked to Blizzard about it directly. No, I didn't make a video about it, but I actually spoke with people who are working on the game about it and why it's important. It's hard to make a video about spell batching the way that I want to explain it, without using private server footage, which we are not allowed to do. So the time is better spent actually explaining it directly than making a video for the youtube channel that would probably be kind of low quality and not get the message across.
---
Thanks man :)
---
You could easily have access on two accounts, so for instance have a horde and alliance toon on a PvP realm.  My understanding is that RAF basically gives 30 days free game time to the new account.  It's not so much about playing for free, but only paying once.
---
Can support that it likely works this way. I raided with a gm in bc and they got me on the list for the wrath beta and I’ve gotten an invite for every wow alpha/beta since
---
Still in prem vs prem its more like 100 out of 100 cases. In duels its 99 out of 100. In wPvP with good sapper coordination the engineering team has a huge edge, in 2v2 wPvP you will take dumps by double rocket helming. Warrior is simply not playable in wPvP 1v1 at all without engineering. Some classes like mages can easily get away nuking warriors without engineering sure, however classes like shamans rely heavily, because they dont have a stun baseline.
---
So all in all one can say engineering is mandatory if you want to contribute in a meaningful fashion. Without you will play a week until you hate yourself for losing the 10th Black Lotus that week to that warlock fear that you could've reflected.
---
At that point you will respec anyways.
---
So the question should be more like: "How long will I play without engineering until I respec anyways?"
---
wait a sec.... WHAT?!
---
Lots of Europeans on this reddit forum, eh?
---
Getting full T2 is more about drop luck and how many rogues your guild raids with. assuming 3-5 rogues in the raid and you all have pretty equal item priority I'd estimate about 2 months to get full T2. But this is most dependent on how frequent rogue tier drops so its hard to estimate.
---
Eewww gross not a burrito.
---
They are the least required and needed class. Simple.
---
In Classic and BC, I would say theres more responsibility. The run depends on you moving forward and the groups life depends on you pulling and tanking well. A DPS can go AFK easily for a few pulls, a tank and healer cant, or theyre holding up the whole group. Tanking however, takes more focus to do well and you need a lot of awareness at all times in case things go bad. BC was particularly bad for tanks because it was very hard to tank dungeons without speccing into it.
---
For WotLK onward, I have no idea. In Wrath and post nerf Cata, all I did was faceroll my keyboard with instant cast spells and never lost threat on anything in dungeons. DPSing was literally the same thing, so yeah, no idea why people avoided tanking then.
---
What xantek said, dwarf if you're into solo pvp/world pvp and gnome for battlegrounds
---
I saw two names on there that I remember - they helped me to get my first clear in Molten Core\*, even though I wasn't in their guild.  I'll sign up as soon as I can work out the best contact information
---
\*Including the luckiest ever killing of Geddon in history.
---
I started playing shortly after release, UBRS was 15 man because no one had gear or skill at that point, after a couple of months you could 10 man it but it was still tough. You had to run that to gear up and to get attuned for MC from what I remember.
---
perfect :) pet suggestion for this type of leveling? cat? owl?
---
Oh shoot that's right, if you connect the flightpath to Darnassus from Moonglade you can use that as a quick way back "home" for NElfs.
---
Availability of raid slots is a huge problem. A guild will have 2....MAYBE 3 dedicated tanks, so there's a need for 7.5% of the player population to tank. HOWEVER instance runs need 20% tanks. That's a massive discrepancy. Then compound this problem that guild tanks are required to have the highest possible attendance, and you have a recipe for people opting out of tanking.
---
Rogues charge gold for opening boxes? Im always did for free lol
---
Hmm, if you say so. I started at launch, and I thought I remembered several 40 man UBRS runs.
---
Yup, this is bannable and against law we should call police and catch this criminal

---
My main was an orc warrior since day 1. Still is for raiding, it’s never changed, and it’ll be that way for classic.
---
Going to do a lot of tanking because I want to be a gatekeeper for toxic people. My guild has always recruited good people that want to raid instead of recruiting good raiders and hoping they aren’t bad people. I would rather wipe a bunch with friendly well meaning folks than deal with rage and hostility, especially if it’s directed at others. 
---
Doesn’t mean I won’t screw up from time to time, but at 40 years old with 2 kids and a job as a professional consultant I feel like I could make a small difference wherever I land in Classic.
---
I'd disagree with this, WotF really isnt a huge deal in pvp. Orc racial is insanely OP but we will see how it actually scales in classic. If it works the way it has on pServers (which im skeptical of) then Orc is the easily better.
---
Back in Vanilla I played a Warrior, Rogue, Warlock, Priest, and Hunter to 60. 
---
This time, I'm going to be the token Ret Paladin on whatever server I pick (either RP-PvE or just plain PvE, medium pop).  I am planning on just chilling while leveling and enjoying the old music and ambience. Gonna take Blacksmithing and Mining too, I think.
---
How do they look poopy compared to Horde?
---
I mean it’s probably just a question of taste but I think every Horde race besides Blood Elves just looks disgusting lol. I love BE’s and I’ve been maining one for years now but for classic I’ll definitely go back to my Night Elf roots because fuck playing those hunchback monsters on the Horde.
---
You do NOT blame Sir Mittens the Third!!!!
---
I bet this brown-noser will be playing classic too LUL
---
Yeah, I mained a healer and would have 40 health bars on my screen during raids. I could barely see the fight.
---
I think alot of people are going to be as surprised as you, rogues are not a strong pvp class in 1.12. They shine in world pvp where they can sneak up to someone farming and go for a quick burst. Other than that they are pretty weak, they are extremely cooldown dependant.
---
When I tanked I actually got to the point where I wouldnt pug. It just wasnt worth it. The amount of terrible dps, asshole vocal dps, people randomly going afk, stupid fuck dps that rolls on your tank gear, huntards, etc makes pug tanking more a masochistic exercise in patience that just isnt worth doing. People also mentioned the reality at endgame where there only needs to be a couple of tanks, per guild, for raiding, grinding blows, PvP as a tank blows. I'll also add in pally tanks arent really a thing in Classic due to a poorly thought out spec combined with itemization that doesnt support it which wasnt fixed until TBC (the best WoW version). All of this makes tanks hard to come by. Particularly for pugging dungeons
---
I'm going to be really, really sad.  I've not had a television for years, I have a 32" 1440 monitor, but I'm planning on buying a huge 4K screen that I'll plug into my machine and  enjoy Azeroth immersion.  I intend to be levelling really slowly, I'll be taking time to smell (and pick) the flowers, and just relax in the ambience.
---
Last time round, I think I had a 17" CRT...and didn't run at full settings as my machine was too slow.
---
He's right, you know.

Release /pray

3/4 is fine but anything below that would be kinda disrespectful for those who have farmed for it. Imagine seeing someone coming in raid after their weed nap still in their pajamas and having their greens replaced by epics without even passing by descent blues. Imagine spending days in dungeons farming for a small upgrade just to be as performant as you can be, only to see some random guy obviously unprepared who just showed up, swipe from you the gear you've been obsessing about for months.

No, you are an idiot. Summer - June 1st.
---
I see some people dont truly understand what this means.
---
OP does. Its about accessing and exploiting their system for game time.
---
But this date seems like something to take note of. 
---
My question is...is there 1 account limit for BNET orrrrr can i use my current wow accounts under my bnet. I have several.
---
Yes sir!

Enjoy. :)

When in my business where I work, what we mean by lets talk in the beginning of summer, it means June first weeks. Please do not respond anymore, thanks.

Only time rogues can shit on warriors is in duels where the rogue has preperation, other than that you're f\*cked. And even with a 10 min cooldown you need to be good and know what you're doing

I call it "Lead Guitar Syndrome"; everyone wants to be soloing on a guitar center stage, nobody wants to play support ( drums / bass ). Same thing in shooter games, everyone wants to be on offense, nobody wants to play defense, everyone wants to be a Sniper, nobody wants to be a Medic.

this is my biggest fear

Cat is best DPS, and if you do nothing you won't agro a second mob that is attacking your pet so the owl is useless.
---
Of course you will put your first 31 talent points in beast mastery, basically everything that enhance your pet DPS.
---
Building two pcs now for duo leveling and then setting up the room for both

The person who's the least wrong usually wins. You could also say, most correct.
---
Doesn't that get hot?
---
I like to do damage.
---
A rumor from what though? Was it pulled out of people's asses? Or was it from a source?
---
That is a really nice setup man! 
---
Really nice addition with the ironic cata-poster, excellent meme.
---
I never watched a Second of "The Office" but I think through all the Memes I feel like I watched it completely.
---
Probably, but me and all people I know who started in vanilla quit in wrath. So if TBC sucked it didn't suck enough to make people quit, there is not much weight in someone saying TBC ruined WoW if they didn't quit in TBC because of it.
---
You really dont need full pre-raid bis to do raids at all. Just aim for as many as you can. This is especially true for MC that can be cleared at fresh lvl 60 if people know the fights. The thing raids doing give a ton of gear like retail does. It takes a long time to gear up. Even if the items you want drop, theres always competition for it. So you should farm a few/half of the pieces before raiding. Then just fill in any spots with any extra time you want to invest outside of raiding. The more gear you have, the higher on the meters you will be, and the more dedicated you will look to your raid. Which can only help when it comes to acquiring raid gear.
---
As an example there will be a ton of people still wearing pre-raid bis blue gear while still clearing AQ. Getting fully geared in raids takes a long time.
---
What character name did you register? This is the first time anyone reports this. Even a refresh isn't necessary.
---
Pre-med is a good talent. I used it as hemo swords back in the day.
---
I am excited to see how classic is going to be. Will there be enough of everything so every guild is going to be picky. Or will the shock of 40 man raids just blow people's minds and just take whatever they can get.
---
Storm rage (EU) had a service where the 3 top rogues on Horde would take payments to assassinate alliance members. 
---
My friend was a popular hunter on the server and got taken out a lot. Was all in good fun.
---
At least from my experience of leveling a warrior on private servers ( can't remember if this was how it was in real vanilla) weapon skill perks were useless while leveling, since I was never able to reach my weapon skill cap above like lvl 20. Dunno if having faster weapons change that.
---
I got 39/40 within a few minutes but somehow completely forgot about Alterac Mountains. How?!
---
&gt;sometimes astronomical summer is defined as starting at the solstice, the time of maximal insolation, often identified with the 21st day of June
---
&gt;The meteorological convention is to define summer as comprising the months of June, July, and August in the northern hemisphere
---
&gt;This meteorological definition of summer also aligns with the commonly viewed notion of summer 
---
&gt;The meteorological reckoning of seasons is used in Australia, Austria, Denmark, Russia and Japan. It is also used by many in the United Kingdom. 
---
&gt;in North America, summer is the period from the summer solstice (usually 20 or 21 June in the Northern Hemisphere)
---
Not trying to argue, but it isn't really that set in stone that summer starts june 21st, a lot of europe and most places in the world they do not follow that. However, for blizzard that is a company from NA, 
---
it is of course what they are using
---
Oh didnt make the connection
---
Too much pressure on people
---
Same reason you get a DPS that does HALF of everyone else...even with gear. They just want to semi afk and you cant really do that as a tank or healer without massive gear.
---
Rofl same here. And the other 39 came quickly. For some reason my brain kept skipping it when I was navigating the mental map of the game world.
---
That's what I'm thinking too. Maybe the 1st boss or 2 in MC. I cant see Ony getting downed in week 1

Id say Paladin, you can very easily level to 60 with just your mouse, left hand is free for whatever you want. Auto-attacking mobs give you a lot of down time as well.
---
In raids, probably Mage would be the laziest, little repositioning required and mash 1. Paladins are also pretty lazy, but you actually have to keep on eye on your raid frames and play whack-a-mole during most boss fights. Trash, you can usually lazy mode auto heal the tank.
---
Atleast the FPS was realistic for the time haha... choppy
---
I came, I saw, I clicked.
---
Im not sure never played vanilla. I still have the feeling when getting something in Azeroth.
---
Ehh, it's not as black and white as that. It's pretty hard as a tank to get yourself killed by playing badly in a raid. The biggest issue is keeping threat and if you lose threat the and the raid boss turns around and smacks a DPS. Once the DPS dies if it's not a wipe it will often just turn back to the tank. Then it's partly on the tank for not getting enough threat, but mostly on the DPS for not watching his threatmeter.
---
Even a tank dying is probably more on the healers than the tank (unless the tank fucked up a mechanic)
---

That’s like every time I look up any games release date
---
RAF gives you 30 days free time to the existing account when the new account pays for 60 days worth of game time.
---
Some people were really obnoxious about vanilla, and would shit on modern WoW to try validating their point.
---
I suppose it's not psychological science to surmise that trying to devaluate a game on its official forums full of people who play said game will make them feel animosity.
---
Played a Rogue to 60 last summer.
---
I'm a casual and I loved everything about it. I also love Feral Druid but whenever I'm a cat, I wish I were a rogue. And whenever I'm a rogue, I wish I could become a bear.
---
Rogue and Druid will be my primary/secondary for Classic.
---
I am not spoiled by the later expansions and have only ever played Rogue in Vanilla. I was surprised that Sap broke stealth but otherwise it's awesome. (You can spec into a 90% chance of sap not breaking stealth in the Sub tree)
---
DKP is fine and main tank gets first equip free
---
I remember a few 15 man strat runs, along with others that soon became 5 man only after a bit. I do remember doing 15 man Ubers as well, even after the others were limited to 5 man. My memory is a lil hazy of course, but I don't think they put the 10 man limit on UBRS at the same time they put 5 man limits on all others.
---
However, I don't ever recall doing UBRS with 40 but maybe it was possible and there weren't any raid size limits in the beginning but having more than 15 was just detrimental to loot and just plain overkill for combat if you could do it.
---
Even when you could 15 man stratholm, was there a limit to raid size in those days or was 15 just a reasonable compromise? I just can't recall any limitations until the 5 man limits were introduced.
---
I can think of a couple things that might contribute to tanks being the least played role, I’m sure I’m missing a lot of them though.
---
1) Dps is available to all 9 classes, some classes only have the option to do so, and a lot of people love the class identity tied to mages, rogues, warlocks, and hunters.
---
2) in open world solo stuff like questing, killing mobs and gathering trade goods DPS is usually what people lean towards, it is easier to kill mobs fast as a dps in most scenarios.
---
3) respec costs are really high in vanilla
---
4) there’s only one viable tank class, being warriors (according to a lot of people, I know this is a controversial thing to state) 
---
5) tanks don’t really have a spot in pvp, besides flag carrying but other classes like druids rogues and mages can do it better, and in AV to tank the bosses.
---
There are lots of other reasons I’m sure.
---
In classic I’ll be playing a tank though :)
---
Playstation is the best choice for a console if you do buy one.  It has the best exclusives out of any of the three, unless you really enjoy Nintendo games.  Most of them are fun, but extremely repetitive and haven't changed much.
---
How does that seem suspect? There is no difference whatsoever between just making a second account and making a second account via RAF for the purposes of Classic. You still need an active subscription regardless and all the benefits of RAF are bound to the main game.
---
Playing warlock for a decade+ BFA is the first time I really like the demo spec. Sadly one of the very few things Vera for ass a lot gets right tho
---
Wao wao, slow down there davinci. My meme skills are still developing here
---
I would assume it's to avoid any potential confusion. At least for the time being.
---
Could not remember the “pine” in silverpine. I’ve never played UD so I have just never gone there. That killed me
---
You're right,  forgot that was a change after Vanilla.
---
[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNxD6zHzf6M) was my impression of how it worked, so people not attending raids wouldn't move up the list.
---
&gt; pulled out of people's asses?

Is your tl;dr longer than your post?

Rather that than all the 'what should I play'/'convince me to do x' posts.

thank you:)

What where? I didn't know that haha
---
Missed mulgore, hillsbrad foothills and searing gorge.

Also, not trying to argue, but if were to be "set in stone" what would that look like or resemble?  Stonehenge perhaps?
---
Inb4 they delay it to fall

/camp
---
I could see people doing this at the start of classic to duel box for free during the initial zerg. Or they're really worried about initial population and don't want to add in 30 day tourists on top of everything.
---
I don't think the program has great retention rates either which is why they're revamping it in the first place.
---
IRL I’ve literally never given a shit what faction someone plays when discussing WoW. It’s always the Horde players who ask your faction and then they let you know exactly which faction is better. They’re like little children.
---
Had this Staples employee pull that once when I was buying a chair and the topic of WoW came up. He said “for the Horde!” This was during MoP when people played both Horde and Alliance based on BiS racials. What a fucking noob comment to make.
---
Horde suck.
---
Hi, /u/Altnob
---
Yeah could be, either way seems like a decnet chance they're related making the date of interest
---
Happens all the time though
---
Why did you have to remind me about the chicken?
---
What if they accidentally destroyed all the work and they are figuring out what to tell the people
---
God, I hate those too.  Lmao.
---
Also are there even physical "standard" (not some collectors edition) boxes for wod onwards?
---
Right
---
No one said optimal. OP said essential, and it is essential. The difference between good and essential still includes engineering as a profession.

Bad to casual players don’t need it.

Warriors in retail vanilla often used leather if they were dps. its nothing new.

You might like priest, there's a vid on YouTube called like "Why you want to level a priest" or something which you should check out (can't link, at work on mobile). They're the best healers too.
---
I leveled a pally and yea it's kinda afk and you get a free lvl 40 mount, but healing as pally (and in general) won't be so afk, unless you're not trying to raid.
---
I would say hunter cus even with low effort you can be quite effective
---
Yeah, I am trying to get confirmation from friends at the moment, but I am like 90% positive we used to do UBRS with 40, and it was overkill, ridiculous, and amazing all at the same time. Nobody had gear, and the skill varied (whelps wiping the whole damn place), but it happened.

I was the same way in BC, I was so young and didn’t know about addons like grid until late bc/early wrath! But honestly, I sort of miss dragging out the plates individually and setting it up how I wanted before the raid started. It was fun times.

Since when were meteorologists right on anything?
---
i have the same chair as you lol
---
Thanks for the reply!

1. My understanding is that the new account (friend), basically gets a 30 day subscription on a new account.  If this is true, they could play Classic immediately.  This would largely be a problem as people could basically have 2 accounts 100% of the time (horde + ally on PvP servers). I'm not 100% on because I don't fully understand how RAF is set up now, but it seems like a possible issue.
---
2. Regardless of benefits, RAF being there will be a major source of confusion as it's not actually related to Classic. I would expect them to get a lot people trying to use the system for the perks specifically, but there are also probably going to be some CS issues with people thinking you can get the in-game leveling benefits in Classic.  I think you could see how they may want to minimize confusion here, hence it being a little suspect that it's suddenly going away.
---
So you haven't even done the raid (neither did i) but you already KNOW that it is the best one?
---
Are you'd dumb. Your taking it too literal
---
Hey man, if you enjoy that talent you should get it! I’m sure the power that you gain from it isn’t make or break, but having that talent will make your experience more fun. But if you’re a min maxer I can’t help you with the math, my advice is to go with your gut tho!
---
Looks like you got some kinda stain on your wall you might want to scrub off ;)
---
You realise Q3 begins July 1st?
---
I’m ready for The post
---
Oh, no doubt. I'm sure it's relevant to Classic launching and probably creating an option for Classic RAF in the future.
---
bootstrapping system... sudo systemctl enable firewall..
---
Different reasons:
---
- Warriors are considered "the" tanks in Vanilla, and they are an absolute pita to level.
---
- More pressure in group content. Additionally, unlike dps, tanks (and healers) can easily be fucked over by careless play from their fellow players, i.e. you are much more dependent on decent group mates to enjoy running a dungeon.
---
- Outdoor content doesn't require tanks.
---
- Dungeon content requires the highest amount of tanks in regards to the size of the rest of the group (20% tanks, 20% healers, 30% dps). This means that either there is a dearth of tanks for groups, and a sufficient amount of tanks for raids (because in raids you do not need eight dedicated tanks on every run, they mostly comprise around 10% of a raid's numbers) - or you have a sufficient amount of tanks for groups, and far too many tanks for raiding.
---
- They have a relatively high upkeep cost (flasks, resist gear, repair costs), and are, at the same time, worse at farming for that upkeep than other specs/classes.
---
Personally, I don't main tanks for those reasons and more. I am a tactical, cautious player that excels in keeping in the back and *having* everyone's back; I am distinctly uncomfortable *leading* groups, however. That doesn't mean I do not enjoy the occasional tanking experience - but not ever for pugs. I'll have a dedicated tanking alt that will be reserved for guild runs for whenever I am on, and a tank is needed.
---
If summer were defined purely astronomically by the period in which the northern hemisphere receives the most sunlight then June 21 would be the middle of summer, not the first day.  Instead, the solstice is defined as the first day in order to align the season boundaries with the astronomical calendar while accounting for meteorological considerations (lag between increased sunlight and increased temperatures).
---
I have AC and a ceiling fan, so it's not that bad. I also usually have the door open.

I NEED it to vendor for gold, DUH.

Catch me dancing on the top of OG bank in my pet healing gear, plebs

---
i pray that the beta time is not longer than 2 months. i want classic and no beta stuff.
---
Dunno, just saying that in a lot of europe they are officially using the meteorological definition of june 1st &gt; august 31st. And at least for most of europe,this is also the commonly viewed notion of summer (though some countries also use the astrological definition officially, for business etc.)
---
&gt; Thoughts?
---
Play what you like. Your 3 hunters may quit or move on. Especially when they find out of how biased your loot council is.
---
During vanilla running UBRS was extremely popular. Lots of good gear, and a really fun dungeon.
---
r/newsentences
---
Worthwhile
---
I changed my Draenei warrior to a Gnome for this very reason years ago.
---
When people have shitty gear it just might be done with 15 people from time to time. It certainly will not be a 5 man except for exceptionally geared guildies.
---
Cataclysm poster... DansGame
---
Exactly this, and they were very fast.
---
Tradechat was much worse lmao. Openly mocking people until she got btfo
---
Even that’s kinda stupid. Raid healers will never try to click the tank in the clusterfuck that is near the mob.
---
Thank you, I appreciate it!
---
I will be on a PvP server because I do actually enjoy PvP quite a bit, haha. I just like being lazy in most situations. I pretty much primarily pvped on my rogue all these years in world/bg/arena. PvP is where my laziness is put to the side :)
---
Warriors for victory rush as well it heals then and is veryyy helpful for tanks.
---
This is totally BS. Why would Fapadins 2v1 when they could 1v1?
---
Lol same. We suck.
---
And then get stuck in the elevator...
---
Weapon skill is big as a levelling warrior mate
---
Because warrior train skills so slow, and because the last 5 levels of a weapon skill train much slower than the previous, having a weapon skill boost can give what feels like a level or two advantage to glancing blows. Combined with being an actual level above mobs, you’re gonna be hitting solid
---
The absolute worst on a levelling warrior is going up against mobs your level or higher and just missing every god damn shot
---
Yeah I agree. Now it's just very very bad, the characters have grown so stupid. It's almost like comedy now.
---
It doesn't spawn often enough. If one spawned every 10 mins with a low drop rate for good stuff then you might have something to drive PvP frequently enough
---
r/woosh
---
Van Cleef. I know it’s weird. I thought it was too when I first started, but it just became a thing.
---
&gt;Also PSA I'm going on a PVE server.  Suck it
---
To the surprise of literally nobody
---
Would it not be easier to sacrifice early parry and riposte? Or is that too key to levelling on rogue
---
Adds variety yes but it does alter the story/world/rpg dynamic a bit, which is important to me. Any kind of mass destruction should be saved for special events or achievements.
---
A guild doing Naxx? Guess it depends when you want to hit up Naxx?
---
In vanilla I was a hardcore raider in a PVE raiding guild. I played easily 5hrs a day during the week and more at the weekend. Was kinda average play time for my guild.  We cleared AQ40, but I still wouldn’t say it was on “farm” status. We still needed all the well geared raiders to be there with buff foods and elixirs etc. 
---
Think we got 3 or 4 bosses down in Naxx before tBC went live.
---
I guess it all depends on your guild. You’d need a lot of well geared players for Naxx. So I guess it’d be down to how long it’d take you to get to 60, and then get sufficiently geared with BWL &amp; AQ40 loot.
---
Durrrr nochanges durrrr
---
You can't simply suggest a really cool addition to vanilla and have people accept it, they don't want it to be better
---
I’ve done 10/25, which is the neutered joke of a version. The mechanics work differently in a heavy handful of the fights, but they are the same mechanics. IE Loatheb’s heal works differently in 40M, to make it a much different fight, but it’s still a heal gimping mechanic. 
---
I don’t know if it’s *the* best raid. I still think Karazhan and Ulduar are too great for that to be 100% true. But I think it’s obvious that it’s the most developed and well rounded raid in Classic. It’s night and day between Naxx and MC, and even BWL has a handful of dud bosses, as cool as the first and last two are.
---
Wrath is the most made and most popular private server out of any xpac. And has been since 2009. It still has the most population buddy. Vanilla servers have never been hyped up until recent years. My info is 100% accurate
---
I can do rails. let's go!
---
Again, it's a matter of opinion. People did quit in TBC. In fact, people started asking for Vanilla servers when TBC was released. I'm glad you and your friends enjoyed the game until wrath but some did not.
---
true, but if retail was any good, classic would be dead in the water, wasted development time. It's only due to the abysmal state of retail that classic has any right to exist :P (from a business pov)
---
Yeah that's the plan
---
Well, got to get rid of all the dried alliance blood every once in a while.
---
Love it
---
Why celebrate mediocrity at all? Wrong is wrong, and it’s even more wrong when the person being wrong states themselves that they were less wrong. Now it’s an arrogant celebration.
---
Almost never saw this back in 05 but ok
---
You don't have to do it if you don't want to. It makes up like 0.1% of all quests.
---
It's a nice sightseeing tour and a good storytelling mechanic
---
Let's not pretend spamming frostbolt is some engaging combat mechanic
---
Playing retail vanilla and playing on private server vanilla is not a mutually exclusive thing.
---
is the black qiraji battle tank icon?
---
Mained a gnome rogue until mid-wrath, then switched to orc warrior since then. Will play horde this time around, almost definitely.
---
I think a tank is the toughest roll to play. They need to learn the boss fights more than anyone else. They cock up, the raid wipes.
---
It's been a thing for awhile, but a lot more popular in the last 3 or 4 years.  They're pretty much the standard desks when my company buys new ones now and I'm in a gigantic company.
---
No I'm an American who wasn't born rich, so I'm gonna have to budget the 15 a month just to play on my 6 year old pc with a failing hard drive.
---
Remember kids, if you go to college, study, and work hard, you too can get absolutely nothing out of it and be condemned to poverty.
---
I know
---
you won't need BFA for classic, just a sub
---
Portrait monitor.
---
This dude programs.
---
Cleaner than most for sure
---
I just realized your name is a play on super soaker... good one man
---
After playing on live, and private servers I just don't even know what to believe. I've seen 35 people one shot every boss in greens after freshly levelling on private but I remember my guild of 40 struggling for weeks on ragnaros alone.
---
I'm sure I'm going to get "get good", but geez it just doesn't seem to be comparing apples to apples.
---
Yes, with the right scrolling combat settings.
---
&gt; I like having lots of loot and feeling badass 
---
Here's the problem. I'm reaching pretty far but that second to the last word says a lot. In vanilla, and in games like the souls series, sekiro, roguelikes, quake, pixelperfect sidescrollers, EVE, hell even Chess, you don't **feel** like a badass, you either **are** or you **aren't**. It's not a feeling, it's a factual state of being within the context of the game itself. You have performed the inputs in just the right way to attain the masterful outcome. You have planned and prepared in some cases upwards of six hours per half hour of performance. It is this demonstrable mastery of a game system that will make a player **BE** a badass. You don't need a little cheevo or some welfare epics or a "story mode" that turns the game into a movie. 
---
This is why the AAA games industry is heading full steam ahead toward a cliff. They're increasingly desperate to instill a feeling of accomplishment in players through payments and participation trophies, and all of it rings hollow to anyone with an IQ above room temperature.
---
Classic WoW was all soul. There were 0 subs while it was being developed; every design choice was made to entice, enamor, and enthrall the players. From there, they had data, and a larger team costing more money, and thus receiving more "corporate oversight". They had forum posts, customer reviews, and complaints to direct their further design choices, which was the wrong play. As I'm sure you can imagine, the squeaky wheels got the oil; so much oil, that now we have a game where everyone is a winner; a game where nothing really matters.
---
Apparently there are people who *don't* like the idea of Classic WoW, but I haven't met a single one.
---
&gt; My understanding is that the new account (friend), basically gets a 30 day subscription on a new account. If this is true, they could play Classic immediately.
---
Incorrect.
---
When you recruit a person and **they** buy a month your main account gets a free month. That still requires the person to buy the full game (ie: BFA) &amp; pay $15 for their subscription. 
---
The reason it is going away is because in 7.3 they gutted the fuck out of it and it has been sitting there as a relic of a forgotten time for quite a few years and needs a serious overhaul.
---
Lmao and the Earth is flat too.
---
It was pretty dope the first time we did that in hellfire peninsula though :P
---
Riposte is one of the more powerful abilities on the combat , especially when leveling.
---
lol it is 
---
TLDR: his TLDR is indeed longer than his original post and it makes you question why he did this, but I’m assuming he was just rambling and typing and then hit enter without thinking about it
---
Being the least wrong / most correct isn't mediocre. It's the front of the pack. It's first place.
---
For many vanilla fights yeah. Tanking feels harder in retail since there are more mechanics to do and more involved rotations.
---
Vanilla tanking is mostly tank n spank with simple spammable rotations
---
Times like this im happy that ElvUI will be on Classic.
---
I never understood the hatred for undercity. Upon entering for the first time I thought it was really badass, and it’s not hard to navigate. Slime rivers, the guards are insanely cool, coolest bank in the game, and 4 equidistant quarters from the middle. Great design in my opinion, I love this city.
---
Lab dogs! All of you!
---
Your missing the point. So we will just stop here
---
In vanilla, Recruit a Friend only gave you a free month of subscription.  There was no leveling or XP boosts or anything else with it.
---
I still have my original email that my buddy sent me when I started playing.  You get a 10 day trial, then if you sub, you get a month free.  That's all Recruit a friend did in Vanilla
---

Warlock isnt the underdog lol 
---
Druid is, so go for that
---
Warlock is "underdog"?
---
I did consider an spriest main at first but my guild is full of priests! 
---
My guild was hunter-less so I considered it. Now this thread cements it. Thanks :)
---
Every single classic content creator I know of never went past ragnaros/bwl in retail.
---
It was fun the first quest I played like that. After that, it got annoying.
---
&gt;left hand is free for whatever you want.
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Lmfao
---
If anything this just makes it so people don’t create fresh accounts for classic using their existing. Either way I think you have your tinfoil hat on too tight.
---
Nice. I thought my Classic station was coming along well but it's still lacking compared to some of yours.
---
MT spots are the most competitive in the game. For every MT you have 10 people dreaming of getting geared in a lockout. 
---
It's the dungeons where you have 3 DPS, 1 healer, 1 tank and there normally you never have enough tanks. 
---
Warriors are 17-25% of the server, so one would imagine more warriors would go tank for a week or two to be able to reserve their Truestrike or Dal'Rends, but lots dont and rather run UBRS 40times to gain their preBiS. 
---
But they dont. Therefore numbers certainly are not the problem, it has to be something else. And this something else is probably responsibility. If you are at work for 8-12hours a day having to take responsibility for yourself or even your subordinates, many people do not enjoy to do the same in a game, they want to relax in. Atleast that's my assumption on the lack of tanks.
---
Do you know the status of that recruit's account when you recruit them, prior to them paying for anything?  My thinking was that it looks like a normal account (active subscription) minus any expansions.  if this is wrong then only #2 above applies to my knowledge.
---
I mean Horde really only has 2 choices for tank and one of them is far better than the other for tanking. I would say it's mostly because people would rather pick one of the other 7 other choices other than Warrior.
---
That only applies to raids.
---
No explanation for why there are so few tanks for dungeons when you have up to 25% of the server going warriors.
---
Mained tank for a raiding guild in Vanilla and will be playing a support/resto Shammy this time around.
---
Keep the snus in the beerminifridge for that sweet chilly sensation
---
Too much responsibility for my shoulders.  No tank you   :)
---
then i need to move very close to the screen
---
In terms of how many people playing warlock, yes.
---
I am not saying it's the least played class. It is however the class that I enjoy out of the lesser played classes
---
I will be doing the same!
---
Hunter vanilla, priest tbc, warlock wraith, druid legion and rogue private server.
---
I love to heal so go back to priest.
---
That's my point though, them doing that due to Classic (if that's the case, regardless of reason) suggests that Classic is coming soon (which we know), but that the date for this RAF change becomes more interesting as we DO NOT know the date of Classic
---
Blackrock Mountain had a lot of good content - BRD, LBRS, UBRS all had their plus points (BRD, whilst huge, could be split and was a great introduction).  UBRS was a fun Friday with few friends though, many a good (and sometimes slightly drunken) evening was spent in there, arguing about who would skin the Beast.
---
Also forgot Moonglade because I didn't think it would be counted since I consider it a city much like Stormwind/Org/etc.   
---
I angrily stared at classic maps after getting the first 39 in 4 minutes and then being mad I couldn't figure out the last in my memory lol
---
Warlocks might be considered underdogs on PvP servers Alliance side, due to Will of the Forsaken.
---
Or thats what I'm thinking OP is indicating?
---
I was thinking of exactly this the other day. Like that first bombing mission in TBC. I was like that is cool but the more and more I did it on alts it was boring then WOTLK came out and it was more of the same and half the time my addon's would F up the UI for vehicles. I was over it in WOTLK.
---
Games going to release when a lot of us have to go back to school smfh. A true summer release would have been awesome. I could have played all day but now I can only play extremely casual. Never works out like that tho. Sigh
---
Something might be in the making here! The calm before the storm?
---
*cannibalize* ah an undead rogue? Man of class.
---
Yes, that is what optimal means.
---
&gt; I've played all through retail and around ~7 years of time on a handful of different private servers across all expansions and one thing seems to be consistent no matter what - Tanks are always the least played.
---
So... during those 7 years... were you a tank?
---
Man, I can't even name all 50 states.
---
Holy shit that’s gold
---
He didn't say anything about the tank dying he said the raid dying. If the boss isn't positioned correctly or if you don't taunt off the MT at the correct time then other people will die.
---
It takes an average player roughly 216 hours to hit 60, assuming they're doing normal human things like running some dungeons, leveling professions, goofing off, whatever. If you played 10 hours a week that puts you at 22 weeks to hit 60. So just about 5 months for super casuals to even hit endgame.  
---
If the casual player plays optimally and doesn't bother with production professions, only does dungeons if they have all the available quests, and doesn't bother fishing or afking in orgrimmar to admire the nolifers, he can hit cap in about 144 hours, maybe a little less. Still assuming 10 hours a week, that puts us at about 14 weeks, or 3 months and some change.
---
This is exactly what I did! I was touring Azeroth in my mind at like 5000% speed!
---
I'm sure having half their old fanbase all do a recruit-a-friend might hurt things a bit financially what with the free game time.

oh yes a new one this time shadow priest back in vanilla i was a strong T2 hunter.
---
So what’s your excuse for trolling the comment section? You’ve got nothing better to do either?
---
Pot, meet kettle: black.
---
I'm gonna try my best to sum it up shortly with some positives and negatives of all.
---
Holy Paladins: I am the tank of healers. I'm just gonna laugh off any dmg you throw at me. Take me down to 1% and I have ways to bounce back to full. Get ready for a 5-10min fight buddy. I have almost no ability to pressure you with dmg so it's gonna take a while for me to kill you. Actually, if you wanna just walk away from me and I'd be cool with ending the fight.
---
Druid: entangle, hots, rengage, entangle, hots, rengage, etc. You won't kill me, I'll just get away. I'm not particularly awesome at anything, except flag carrying, but I'm really awesome at being annoying
---
Shaman:  My dmg can be almost equivalent to a dps, but I'll burn a lot of Mana doing it. I have a totem or spell for almost every situation. I have almost too much utility to know what to do in this moment so I'll probably choke.
---
Priest: My heals, CC, and offensive capabilities are so strong, you'll CC/ignore everyone else to get to me. I'm a squishy boy so I won't last very long compared to everyone else.
---
Play hunter probably since that's the most likely class to have bugs to report (last to.get implemented into vanilla and has the most intricate shit going on).
---
Dungeon group composition. 20% + 20% + 30% = 70%?
---
60% dps mate. :)

Sorry for the miscommunication. I was just pointing out that a person doesn't need to perform at 100% perfection to be successful, especially in competition. You just need to out perform your competitors. Victory is victory, whether you win by an inch or a mile.
---
However, I agree that doing the best possible job is both more admirable and increases your overall chances for success and should be striven for.
---
because impatient idiot DPS who want to get the dungeon over with as fast as possible run ahead of you and the healer and pull everything and then blame you for the resulting wipe. it gets old. fast.
---
TANK. DOES. THE. PULLS. 
---
why is this so hard for some people to understand?
---
I leveled a paladin right when TBC was released and actually had more fun than leveling my warrior.
---
Paladins can easily get out of situations that would doom other characters.
---
you know what? I miss Cataclysm's version of Demo, that was really fun
---
It might as well have. This season is dreadful.
---
Blizzard was slow and bad at giving release dates when they made good games too. Wotlk was given a release date only 2 months before it's release.
---
Yes, they would make much more revenue if they released it early in summer
---
Didn't they just confirm a Q3 release in their earnings call this week?
---
Thanks, this is what I was most leaning toward.
---
Alliance scum
---
&gt; but a majority of the reason is number.
---
I agree with this too. It has multiple significant reasons.
---
Absolutely foul.
---
I hadn't seriously considered lock until now. hmm... I do like DoTs
---
business report said "second half" not Q3 IIRC.
---
Dog? Have an upvote m8
---
I haven't played since WotLK and I know. I don't keep up with the game at all either. Just saw it on Reddit.
---
This isn’t new.  It happens to every big gaming sub whose game doesn’t have any new content to discuss.
---
I want to believe
---
Okay so does everyone just have an awesome floating mike and O wasnt aware?? Love your station ma dude
---
This will happen a lot to hunters in phase 1 if classic is anything like private servers. Blackcrow (lbrs xbow) is bis for hunters and melees as well. On last private server I was on it was the norm for melees to roll against hunters on that. On the flipside it was considered ninja if a hunter rolled need on dal'rends swords (which are bis for both hunter and melee as well). Double standards!
---
What's with the uppercase and lowercase letters?
---
I love wallpaper engine it’s so fucking badass. I have he same pic but my 2nd monitor has the borderlands 3 psycho with all the roses an it’s everything all flowey and stuff
---
That trinket was insane, especially on rogues.
---
Flat Dodge % is obviously nice, but being able pop a shield while dotted and then vanish and not have your stealth broken is borderline op.
---
Yeah the only thing that was always sad is we'd only get Drek like 30-40% of the time. 
---
That last bit in UBRS increases the difficulty like crazy.
---
One of you cares about group performance and the other cares about group fun. Classic is about having fun, not laser focusing on the most optimal everything. The retail devs have homogenized everything because people who wanted everyone to be optimized made the game less fun for everyone else.
---
Just realizing that streamer fandom makes communities toxic as fuck.
---
From this comment and another I'm starting to lean towards a druid. I love the idea of a hit and run / guerilla approach to healing. Not to mention I love leveling as a druid.
---
You should have. Spell batching is just as easy to explain as it is explaining server tick rate in CS:GO, just for spells and abilities.
---
You absolutely don't need footage to explain it. None of you content creators asked for this, but when Blizzard unexpectedly fixed something no one even asked - yet alone thought of - you guys claimed it as something you've all asked for. You might have asked someone about it, I'm not saying you're a liar, it's just such a weird coincidence that there's no shred of actual footage, audio clip, forum or anything that tells us that you guys actually did ask for this at an earlier date.
---
I had a friend who last month tried wow for the first time. I had tried to convince him for years and by the time he gave it a try we're in BFA. 15 levels in and he had already said that he feels like leveling wasn't the adventure it should be he didn't feel rewarded for leveling up and he wasn't having fun he just felt pressured to get to end game because the game is so end game focused now. It made me sad. We got him a boost token because after lv 60 he was sick and tired of bfa leveling. It made me sad that he doesn't know how fun leveling use to be but knew how fun it was suppose to be.
---
When does Activision report 3rd quarter earnings? 
---
I am sure they expect New and old subscribers. 
---
They need to have big earnings report to make up for poor earnings earlier this year
---
P&amp;R always was, and always will be inferior to The Office.
---
36/40
---
I forgot to type Stonetalon while trying to remember the names of Dustwallow Marsh and the Badlands.  The last one I didn't even think about was Redridge Mountains.  I got all the rest.
---
Actually its exactly why it applies to dungeons. If you are maining DPS in a raid, you aren't going to want to tank dungeons. Sure you could tank them and reserve DPS items, but that's a lot of work to set up a group that doesn't need the specific item you're reserving and a lot of DPS in the group would be mad if the tank rolls on a DPS item. 
---
25% of the server is rolling warriors? I doubt it, but if that number was true 8% of that 25% being tanks probably isn't far off either.
---
You can't gank, you die from ganking, your solo capabilities are crippled, and you do basically 100% of the work in every dungeon, and to be a main tank you need to be competitive in your leveling and dungeon and raid knowledge or you will won't even be looked at and you will be a sad half tank your whole life unless you put in massive effort say grinding righteous orbs.  I knew many tanks who reserved 1-2+ orbs on runs. Eventually got lion helm etc.
---
Felt appropriate with the rumor of the 9/11 release date.
---
And by appropriate I mean I wanted my ticket to hell.
---
Why is it in reaction to Classic launch? I dont see how these are correlated at all.
---
Humans run weird, I dont like their animations, they all have uncanny valley faces.
---
Dwarves are alright,  but they ain't pretty. 
---
Gnomes aren't ugly, they have decent animations, but they're so short and they're gear is all squished.
---
Draenai is the only Alliance race that I actually really like, but thatd BC obviously.
---
Loot is relative. Feeling badass is relative to everyone else’s performance. If he is in blues and everyone is in greens he’s a badass.
---
Having lots of loot is relative too, in a game where 2 epics drop per raid boss—having a full set of epics IS a lot of loot.
---
Loot in retail is meaningless, everyone has access to it. In classic loot is scarce—relatively speaking—the differences in the quantity and quality of your loot vs another is more pronounced.
---
I agree with you kinda but in the sense of what makes these games hard 1-60 in vanilla was MUCH harder. You couldn't pull groups when questing and that 1 solo mob you're fighting put up a good fight you had to actually eat before your next attack... I think vanilla was MUCH harder.
---
Ffs I didn’t even see it. These dog memes are gonna be my ruin
---
I liked the ramp up in difficulty (but not the repair bills), and the final fight with Drakkisath - as a feral druid it was one of the few times I got to tank, in that I got to drag him off to somewhere safe and keep him tied up long enough for the others to kill everyone else before I got swatted and the real tank took over as he ran back...
---
Ah the memories are such fun
---
How much does noggenfogger elixir cost? Was it 35 silver for 5 from the vendor? Can't seem to find exact number from vanilla.
---
shoulda been an S at the end of numbers. But my keyboard at work sucks butt. But I realize that comment kind of had some hypocrisy to it lol. It has a little to do with responsibility, but a majority of the reasoning behind less tanks is just because of the numbers.
---
Forgot the bloody Alterac Mountains!
---
I'm pretty sure a white ninja meme is last decade.
---
Yeah that zone is weird tbh, but it does have some good quests and mining nodes.  I remember going there on Nost to an area that I've literally never seen while playing WoW for the last 10 years.
---
Anyone cares to explain how this is  “definitely” related to classic wow?
---
What soundbar is that? Does it come with RGB?
---
It would be 8.x addons at this stage, since they updated the base client build to BfA version.
---
I'm like the one person who prefers the Horde animal forms, I just cant seem to like Taurens lol
---
Orca tanks OP
---
When it's on TV here it's called "The American Office"... because it's based on "The Office" which was not American.
---
It was great until the end. The struggle between living and dead deserved more than a episode.
---
I missed Alterac Mountains and Thousand Needles. I can forgive myself for forgetting Alterac, but TN? Can’t believe I forgot that.
---
I missed this one too, which is ironic given my anger at them merging Alterac and Hillsbrad during Cata.
---
Your keyboard goes on your lap?
---
Using the word "definitely" pretty fast and loose, eh?
---
That's okay but I really think you shouldn't skip on at least aggression while leveling. It'd be better to go 33 into combat before touching another tree if you really want improved Sprint.  Extra dmg on abilities you use all the time are REALLY good.
---
Personally, I like to put 2 points in endurance while leveling because I enjoy being able to use evasion more in combat, and sprinting a lot before I get my first mount.
---
What speakers?
---
Sound BlasterX Katana
---
 Yes. It has a few different settings for the LED
---
Conflagrate was just such an unbelievably brutal ability. God forbid you be anywhere near the tank on threat or you'd get GG'd
---
I’d be ok with a classic Wotlk one day....maybe they will release classic servers in order. When a new BC server is open you can pay for a character transfer to ply BC again or stay on classic. Haha but end at wotlk. Cause after that is pretty trash
---
These are the sort of rogue specific questions this thread needs.
---
Somewhat agree but could replace hard with more tedious and it would be true. And us players ARE much better so it’s still not hard.
---
Summer starts June 22nd.
---
Youll always have a spot if you run the Premade.
---
=/, seems like people always are more apt to argue with vs trying to understand somebody's point.  Regardless of reason, there are a lot of possible implications of leaving the RAF system as-is once Classic launchs.
---
*2 hour login queue*
---
Yea i just hope this isnt a separate download that makes it single bnet account login. Like overwatch or diablo you know? 
---
I like the multibox.
---
I geared three warriors at 60 on various pservers. It really is that easy.
---
"LFM heal + DPS strat UD (doing Unforgiven, cape res) PST" and within 30seconds to 2minutes the group is full while you ride circles in EPL for Plagueblooms, Black Lotus and Rich Thorium.
---
You can reserve one item while rolling on others. Like UBRS: reserve TS, roll on Dal'rends and the odd Felstriker, Chromatic Carapace is a tank item anyways, so it goes default to you.
---
You can really get away with a lot as tank. First strat live orb is yours by default, you can run up to Stratholme crates 5/10  times, roll on the odd shield and nobody bats an eye. You also have total control of who will join your groups. Got a warlock and your enhancement shaman group member refuses to drop totems? Kick him and invite somebody in 20seconds.
---
You also only invite people who are fine with you rolling on DPS gear. Your group composition is 100% at your discretion, so the rogue not fine with competing for Mask of the Unforgiven or Cape can just not send a tell or argue with me while 5 other rogues already whispered me. Quick armory check and pick the most geared one. Voilà.
---
There is literally no downside to tanking except its more effort once you are zoned in with your 4 group members. Everything up to that point is a cake walk.
---
Maybe I over reacted.
---
Post was before coffee. My b lol
---
Wow!!! That looks awesome
---
Maybe ;) &lt;3
---
Yeah i have no idea now. Played a troll priest at the start of bfa seemed pretty fun. Despite not having anyone help me when i was trying to gank every ally in sight.
---
I am not a fan of speed leveling making gold while leveling is the bether way i think. because this gives a speedboost in midgame.
---
Don't think it hurts the bottom line.  How would it?  
---
The tiny fraction of people who would resub for 8.20 then cancel and resub for classic?  That would require more than 1 month between classic and 8.2, and it's likely a diminishingly small amount of people.
---
The logistics improvements by launching at the same time almost certainly outweigh that tiny portion of people.
---
What's more, businesses want money now.  They don't want to make a little more a few months down the line.  Classic is going to generate a LOT of subs.  Why put that off just so you can have an unchallenged 8.2 that is not likely to bring nearly as many people back.
---
You will end up making more money by releasing both as soon as they are ready.
---
Yes, depending on what dungeon or raid it was I would leave a group if there was someone that I really did not want to be with.
---
Your tears sustain me.
---
I imagine Rick as undead and morty a gnome, dunno classes but Rick should have engineering
---
Edit: Rick is def an undead mage with engi 
---
And morty is s gnome warrior with bad gear
---
Everyone else said it already... super duper clickbait man.  "WORLD OF WARCRAFT CLASSIC RELEASE DATE"  "We don't have a release date yet, but we know it's in the summer..."
---
We're one one trans-continental Classic family anyway :)
---
The Horde will welcome you, Lok'tar Ogar brother.

I think vanilla had repeatable quests, one that comes to mind is the goblin on the docks in feralas across from feathermoon. Had to shrink and kill giants I believe.
---
Yes but I’m more excited to have a character I don’t have to worry about losing forever.
---
According to a recent survey (with very good # of participants), Druid will be least played, followed by Hunter.
---
 The most popular are Warrior, Mage, Priest, Warlock, Rogue ... in that order.
---
Yea plus they also are probably going to work in some system for classic. My guess with this date is still august.
---
However. If you remember early RAF had real ID and teleports....even though it wasnt vanilla they could still implement these things and it wouldnt be too far off.
---
However. I would be open to a 2 seater mount. Lmfao.
---
You are trying to connect dots that don't exist. Classic will come soon enough, but this announcement has nothing to do with it.
---
Who tf downvoted this guy, he didn’t say the tank was right. He is also correct in saying spirit is good for levelling.
---
Whatever the case may be, if Blizzard really did/does invite some Classic streamers to their HQ, that's actually great news because it means they (Blizzard) cares about what they think, since they are more or less influencers and most of them really do get what Vanilla was and what Classic means to us all.
---
Those streamers are pretty much our chosen speakers/representatives.
---
Rick is a Hunter with engineering and Morty is his pet.

It’s not active mitigation in the sense that it was introduced as a concept to increase the skill ceiling.
---
This seems the most likely to me
---
I just want to say that the redesign looks SO good. And man, is it speedier than before. A job well done. :-)
---
This is Monkeynews, so yes. He was a legitimate Scarab Lord.
---
Warlock and Shaman aren't underdogs. A raid will bring up to 8 Shamans if they can.
---
Warlocks offer good DPS and a lot of necessary utility but I guess if not topping the DPS chart counts as an underdog there ya go.
---
Druids are the only real underdog in WoW. Raids typically bring 2 Druids on average.
---
Hey there! I've been checking the [Class WoW Survey tool](https://aablain.github.io/wow-classic-survey/) to answer all those number related questions :)
---
I got myself a Samsung 970 Evo Plus NVME SSD. I need that 3.5GB/s Bandwith to get Instant-Loadscreens. :P
---
Prior to paying for anything your account is just a starter account. It is no different than if you, right this second, went and made a second account as a starter account. It can level to 20 to see if you like the game but is HEAVILY restricted (ie: no whispering, no instances, no trading, etc).
---
You only get a free 30 days if you buy the BFA Complete Edition which is $50 (I know this because I just redeemed a non-complete edition BFA key 4 days ago and didn't get a free 30 days). 
---
Until the point where you pay for at least 1 month of the game you get zero benefit whatsoever with having a RAF account.
---
Well I’m just saying there’s a chance he considered sta/spi a healer item. You get more mileage from a spirit item then a shield when leveling.
---
Moo_uk does indeed have scarab lord.
---
Pre-BiS and BiS, are a target to shoot for, you very rarely need them as a minimum requirement for anything.
---
...sure arguably the consistently highest melee dps in 5 mans and raids with an insane amount of pvp control is just worthless.
---
Dont believe these yokels who try to tell you that everything but the meta spec (Fury Warrior) isnt worth playing. 
---
The difference in viability between the classes is negligible. The difference in viability at end game between a hunter and a mage is less than the difference between being a human or a gnome mage. 
---
All classes are useful and desired. After 15 years, people have found which is the best at what. But don't be goaded into believing that rogues suck, or hunters are worthless, or any other nonsense.
---
In the case of bgs, in WSG you have 10 slots, and there are 8 classes. So unless youre intentionally stacking, 2 classes will have a 2nd of them in the group--everyone else will only have 1x. 
---
My point is play the class you want, figure out how the class works and aim to excel at it. You may not make a great MT as a rogue--but no one is asking you to. You aren't a flag carrier, either--but thats not your job. Your job is to do massive dps in pve and lock down players/areas in pvp (Have the rogue open on the healer in the backfield 5 seconds after the fight starts...or have the rogue defend flags in ab/wsg...or send the rogue in with the mages to have him lock the healer down while the mages gang rape the FC)
---
They're one of the fastest levelers and are among some of the least played, so you'll be kinda unique and all the int leather gear will be up for grabs if you do raiding/dungeons
---
Heads up, if someone dies in world PvP or a dungeon, unless you plan on wasting your battle Rez, theyll have to run back since you have no Rez spell. It's pretty shit.
---
I did the same fucking thing. I hate myself for clicking that article. 
---
They knew...
---
No it wasn't and everything he said below to you in a reply is completely wrong.
---
Shit that looks expensive and I don't even have a PC to play on yet 😫
---
the tier sets for warriors were focused on making them a stronger tank. if you wanted to maximize dps, you would have to look elsewhere. not just looking for gear with more strength.  sometimes, the crit gained from agility would be more beneficial than stacking more strength, and to do that you would need to delve into mail or leather.
---
My man. I want my desk to look like the biggest rave party ever, this should be another step towards that.
---
Anyone that supports sylvannus is disgusting, however any one that supports saurfang is a true ally of the Alliance.
---
King honor, friend.
---
Hi, /u/Mumfo
---
You wouldnt happen to know the make/model of your sideways monitor would ya? :D
---
Gotcha.  May be that it's entirely unrelated then, but I do think #2 above is reason enough for concern on their end (hence a hiatus/review)
---
What class is your dog going to play?
---
Word is really crucial against warlocks and priests.  
---
Orc racial helps mostly against other rogues in terms of the stun resist.  The AP cooldown is nice in PvP and for a little extra burst too, but isn't groundbreaking.
---
I played an Orc rogue back in 1.12 and did always sort of envy wotf in BG's.
---
What is the translation? You've peaked my interest
---
Druid is really fun to level and world PvP is insane with both stealth and track humanoids. I've ranked them a few times on a few different private servers. My biggest complaint is the multiple abilities, talents and set bonuses that don't work indoors :/
---
Uh... least amount of tank classes?
---
Warrior + Druid = 2.
---
Healers? = 3 per faction.
---
Dps a lot more.
---
This inspired me. It is exactly what I plan to do, with the added bonus of my wife is playing a priest :)
---
I did not realize I needed a vertical monitor until just this instant.
---
&gt;At this point I think they are just going to announce it a month or so in advance. 
---
I might need to stay away from anything WoW related until that announcement finally is there. This waiting started to sadden me for some reason. See you all then and there!
---
If I had to put money on what instance was the most run in all of vanilla, it would be UBRS. On Nostalrius you could stick your dick out into world chat at anytime of day and there would be 2-3 UBRS groups LFM.
---
Yeah, or at least a pug life meme.....
---
The original WC3 looks a lot more vanilla-esque anyway.  Just replayed it recently-- really got my back in the state of mind I was in when WoW was first announced.
---
Zug zug
---
It will be no more confusing than people who buy BFA thinking they need to own BFA in order to play Classic. Are you suggesting Blizzard is going to pull BFA from the store to not confuse people? 
---
I appreciate that is can be fun to speculate with stuff like this but you have replied to almost everyone in this thread saying how you can make free accounts with RAF which is just wrong and by your own admission you had/have no idea how the system works and were just guessing.
---
Isn't arcane dust a tbc enchanting material?

So much this

Every gaming company staggers content release to keep you on the line.  This is how subscription models work.  Everything you said goes against the basic premise of how they generate revenue.

nono the door has to be closed for the cosyness factor

+1. My EU guild has 77 members already and wants to play RP-PvP. We'll go PvP if RP-PvP isn't available at launch and I think a lot of us would be somewhat disappointed. What I don't understand: is not the demand for RP-PvP greater than that for RP-PvE? One of the surveys is up to 20k responses now 
---
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScSKhcR57Lpsk4YIEWO-u-88xEXoZo2rT6mF9gl27ctRpcOlg/viewanalytics
---
indicated as such. But they are looking at including RP-PvE but not RP-PvE? If this is at all accurate I hope they see it and include the RP-PvP realm at launch, because if not then their logic for omitting it is flawed and will disappoint many.
---
What counter top did you get? That looks like exactly what I need/want in my life!
---
Every time you kill a mob do 10,000 push-ups and run 10,000 miles
---
woops, meant arcane powder
---
If you’re on a pvp server, take a shot every time you get ganked by a ??. You’ll be in stranglethorn for months 😂
---
tf is monkeynews
---
No reason to hate yourself, hate them.
---
I wish my HD hadn't fried and taken all my old vanilla screenshots with it.  I had one of our raid just after killing Razuvious for the first time with 39 of us dead and one of our rogues standing over his corpse with sub 10% hp.    Good times &lt;3
---
i'm sorry is he famous or something?
---
I've mostly played Horde, but I've been playing Alliance more recently. 
---
Barrens is very convenient, whereas alliance have to run around between different zones. However, I've found that the zone closest to the Barrens in terms of longevity is Darkshore. You can easily go 12-20 there no problem.
---
IDK the casting animation of the skeleton is pretty dope on mages/warlocks.
---
As someone with a cotton candy machine at home I have to say eating cotton candy at your desktop is pretty awesome!
---
I definitly intend to be on a pvp server lol
---
Riposte is very good while solo questing/grinding. Not only is it a very cheap (energy wise) damage dealer, it also disarms leading to more survivability and also fueling itself as you parry more often when they don't have a weapon. It's not essential, but it's quite strong.
---
Oh yeah, if you're going Full Blown Lazy, you could throw on a few DoTs and literally just stand there. Tiny bit less lazy, use your wand. Little bit less lazy still, Life Tap for mana. Even less lazy, Health Funnel to heal your pet as needed, Drain Life to restore your own health.
---
But honestly, you can be super lazy and inefficient as long as you're not pushing forward too quickly.
---
I now know my IQ is above room temp. Thank you, and I really liked this thought. It may be a stretch in his circumstance but maybe not considering the majority that want that.
---
streamers went to irvine and hinted there might be a beta on or before the 19th
---
Hi, I'm going to play this game for 2-3 hours a few nights a week. Am I going to be gimping myself by playing what I want and doing the things I enjoy, or should try my hardest to not have fun and play something I don't like?
---
Its dustwallow because its surrounded by deserts
---
I’m with ya buddy. Strongly leaning towards the classes that I grew up playing. However on the other side I might want to try something I’ve never done before. Good thing we have months to decide lol. Hope you have fun reliving these memories it sounds fun man!
---
Modestly popular warrior who streams and makes YT videos. Very mechanically skilled player.
---
True, if you can't use the /sit macro in Classic it won't be as powerful but I believe that once you get Holy Shield Protection is still the way to go. You will just respec at level 40 instead of 34 and AoE grind.
---
Tanks are often expected to:
---
• Know which way to go
---
• Know the encounters
---
• Mark targets
---
• Have a strategy for the pull, if needed
---
• Delegate responsibility (you sheep moon, etc.)
---
• Hold aggro
---
• Not be too squishy 
---
• Come up with a new strat if the first one fails
---
• Basically quarterback the entire dungeon 
---
That's too much responsibility for a lot of players.
---
BWL is something that you can pug in the later phases. ZG and AQ20 gear make it very easy. Join soft reserve runs and make sure to soft reserve pieces that you need, but the other Rogues don't. You can get your gear more quickly this way than actually joining an established guild (which is going to trial you for X amount of time with no loot, and then after that you have a lower loot priority than the other Rogues in the guild, which could mean months without even a chance at getting certain pieces).
---
I used to have that chair. Was doing dips on the arm rests and snapped one off. Don't do dips!

what even is this

&gt; if they found someone on the same faction they would have mages spam sheep making the mob unkillable

Can you explain how this works? How does sheeping a mob make it unkillable?
---
&gt;np, my career is software development in testing.
---
Im ready to gank him
---
Didnt even need to edit the dog in
---
Even the most budget setup nowadays will destroy Classic's requirements and allow you to maintain a solid 60 FPS.
---
Dwarves and Gnomes start in Dun Morogh. Also where Iron Forge is.
---
Interesting. What would you say the weekly time commitment is for an average progression guild in classic? Not a hardcore guild but one still looking to clear the content within the respective phase or maybe a month after the next phase.
---
Been a long time but the memories didn't fail me! Got a little close on the timer though...

---
Thank you very much, sir
---
Agreed. If Blizzard does not add an RP-PvP server, many will be disappointed. I hope that your guild among the others who want to roll on RP-PvP get their wish!
---
1 - 60 in 4 hours?
---
PvP servers are the best. I never played Classic WoW on my own comp (stupid stepdad) always at a friends house. But when BC came out that when I got a new comp and played like i had no tomorrow and I loved every second of it but STV was a death trap and loved every second of it.
---
&gt;I can only find evidence of this on private servers
---
Pretty sure cross faction cooperation is somehow against the terms of service (heard this said multiple times but never saw any official confirmation or evidence). 
---
If it's not specifically addressed in ToS then I think there's a catch-all thing that says something to the effect of "any exploitative action that causes other players to not be able to play the game as intended' or something vague like that. 
---
So if they tried it on retail I think after enough reporting accounts would be suspended or banned and it just wouldn't be worth it for the "mafia" to do. 
---
That's what I've heard though, not what I know for sure.
---
It could be that Rogues lose to Druids in duels, I just never lost to one so I can't speak from experience. Maelstrom trinket + Deadly Poison + Rupture combined with Evasion tanking really hurts bear form druids. It's not a fast process but they will go down sooner than you do, forcing Druids to shapeshift and that's when you blow all your CDs to prevent them from gaining the advantage.  
---
I've dueled a decent amount of Druids but you might be right, I've just never seen them beat this setup.
---
I've been saying this since they announced island expeditions. Imagine they drop you in as a level 1 neutral class you have to fight mobs for talent points and you can build your own class by targeting specific rares on your island for instance the crocodile boss drops a healing spell or the monkey boss drops a dot etc. at the end after x minutes the fog rolls in everyone is forced into a small area and forced to duel it out with whatever build they've managed to create.
---
38/40
---
Missed Mulgore and Ashenvale. I probably spent 3 minutes trying to think of the name of Mulgore and couldn't. Would have gotten Ashenvale if I didn't get stuck trying to figure out the name of Thunderbluff's zone lol.
---
This qualifies as a Goldenshire Post.
---
Nah, revamped naxx and onyxia were great.
---
Polymorph causes mobs to have extremely high health regen.
---
Sorry, forgot to edit when I saw my mistake. I meant 1-35 which is enough to get to 300 alchemy to make most potions. Can be done in dungeons in which you drop group, throw an engineering dynamite and then have the mage/paladin nuke the mobs.
---
It looks so bad from this trailer :D
---
Goodboi watching master's PC. Goodboi! :)
---
Because 3 out of 8 classes can tank, while only 1.5 of them (druid being good tanks for 5mans and early raids only kind of) are actually real tanks.
---
Why would like.. 40% of the wow population play warrior?
---
&gt; Anyone who played Wrath will remember the never ending whining about how much the expansion sucks and is the worst WoW has ever been 
---
Well, personally I don't remember that. I remember people at the beginning of Wrath being pissed by broken DKs, horrendous lag in Naxxramas and easy heroics and ... that's all. 
---
I have way more vivid memories of how praised the beautiful and well designed zones were, of people loosing their shit at the new talent trees final abilities (people literally cried when they saw new talents like Titan's grip, Elite pet Hunter, Metamorphosis for locks, Bladestorm in BC prepatch), I remember people praising absolutely superb questlines like the Lordaeron one / Arthas memories in Ice Crown/ Dragonblight's stuff, or trying hard to get their achievements related LK Proto Drakes. 
---
And then, as the expansion went on, it also brought the most balanced PvP ever (which is why Arena Tournament was based on its latest version) , along with having jewels like Ulduar. ICC/Sartha were also solid, ToC ... was monotonous because of the lack of trash but it was still challenging mechanically. Not sure why people bash Naxx either. It was a testing ground for Blizzard to see if achievements could be used as a yardstick for difficulty in raiding. And tbh Plagued/Black Proto drakes weren't common at all, so it wasn't that easy once you actually tried to beat the challenges Blizzard proposed to you. LFG wasn't even a thing until ICC dungeons, nobody used that beofre, you had to casually spam the /2 in Dalaran to find a group for daily heroics.
---
Remember: Three DPS looking for members are in fact looking for a group! :D
---
Competition usually. Most guilds only need 3 tanks at most, 1 MT, 1 OT and a spare, which is usually an alt. That is of course before you get to Naxxramas, and even then 99% of guilds won't have 8 geared tanks and will most likely "borrow" or poach them off other guilds.
---
To get into a good guild as a tank is incredibly difficult, especially if you want to be the MT. To be an MT you will need to pretty much be a friend of the GM, the GM yourself or be one of the first 10 to actually join the guild.
---
Most Warriors who join guilds end up being DPS, which isn't a bad thing as Warrior DPS is incredibly strong, and continues to be so even during post ZG content when the casters usually dominate.
---
Do you have to buy a "vertical monitor" or can you turn a regular monitor into a vertical one?
---
My server us to host 2v2 and 3v3 arenas before arena existed here.      It was a pain with people interfering alot though
---
That's always the problem with these class counter discussions isn't it. People get wildly different results. I'm sure you generally beat druids but in my experience as a (geared) feral druid I looked at rogues of any gear level as a free snack.
---
If they weren't decently geared I could literally afk and come back and still be perfectly healthy.

r/mildypenis
---
What flavor of puppers is that?
---
Wasn't there just an unofficial PVP-RP server in vanilla, like community sort of said that's the one we'll use? I have no idea how well it worked, but I remember people talking about it.
---
The question you should be asking is why is a 25% attendance player in the guild in the first place, and if you can get by that—why is a 25% attendance player ever in the raid and if in the raid—how do you make sure they get loot last, and feel good about it.
---
If my raid needs a player who shows up 25% of the time—my guild is on the verge of falling apart. There is no situation where your raid should have its success be dependent on someone who shows up that infrequently. As such, your raid should have 40+ other people who show up with more frequency. Mr 25% should never have a spot. 
---
Given he shows up once twice a month (at least until aq40, raiding is a 2 night a week endeavor—if it takes longer you or others in your raid are bad), he shouldn’t get any loot before anyone else. 
---
If it’s a guild run, whatever loot system we have is designed to reduce drama, increase the speed at which loot is distributed, and apportion each item to the raid for the biggest benefit.giving anything to someone who shows up to 1/4 raids hurts the raid. Odds are, that item would’ve been more useful as a nexus shard. 
---
If your guild is serious enough to have a loot system more complicated than /random, highest roll wins—there is no place for a 25% attendance raider, and certainly not for giving him loot.
---
Yeah, it looks like the Shaman knew what he was doing and was going to win so the Rogue just keeps going in and out of stealth to keep his attention until he can 2v1 em.
---
Shaman almost killed him even 2v1. I don't understand the video lol
---
It’s easy getting groups for UBRS, because you need to go in many times for BiS gear for raiding, and you need to go in several times for the Ony attunement quests.
---
I agree, I always felt Alliance was about raiding and gearing and trying to compelte in game challenges like a normal story mode video game kinda. 
---
Where horde attracts the people who like the under-dogs and want to PvP and basically have a chaotic fun time playing the game any way they can. 
---
My first character on my friends account I made a NE because I loved their look and didn't understand Horde vs. Alliance. When my friend explained that I'd be killing undead, tauren, orcs, and trolls alongside gnomes (ugh), dwarfs (meh), and humans (yawn) I was like no thank you I will play horde.
---
I might be wrong but , isn’t a pve server pretty much the same as an rp? Besides the label I don’t see any difference
---
&gt; A bunch of skills that actually are the same for every class, with the only difference being the graphyical representation.Absolutely pathetic
---
I felt this hard when trying to level some alts in Legion. None of them made it past 104 because they were ALL "hit big boy button, do no damage until big boy button is back up".
---
Stormstrike did 45% of a mobs hp, the globals in between were damn near useless. Same with pyroblast, same with the ret pala combo point spender, same with kill command. This was reflected at max level when looking at ability breakdowns on dps meters in dungeons as well.
---
I can't wait a week for that question thread man. There is so much knowledge here.
---
Shamans (like Druids) have a big weakness when it comes to being a pocket healer for Warriors, their lack of magical CC removal. Shamans have it worse as they themselves are very vulnerable to CC unlike Druids who are a lot more mobile to boot. It's so bad a single skilled Mage can shut down a Warrior + Shaman combo, something they can't do with any other Warrior+Support combo.
---
4 minutes and 40 seconds, almost forgot about Feralas !
---
who??
---
Same. Some spellings slowed me down. 
---
And, of course, it's easy to remember it all until someone asks you. lol
---
Gonna announce it 1.5 months in advance so they can try to get an extra month win out of ppl. 
---
"I'd you win by June 1, you can play 24 hours early when it launches July 1."
---
Gotcha thanks
---
I mained a tank the last time through, and I'm rolling up a priest this time.
---
I just don't have the time to be a raid MT anymore. I'd rather be the lvl58 priest who's invited to MC for fear ward while wearing greens. 
---
I can take a night off without screwing the raid over because I'm the only one with enough fire resistance for Ragnaros.
---
I have no idea. I suck with computers, and this is the first I'm seeing of this strange, new technology. Looks like it's just turned sideways to me though.
---
Maybe your memory is a little hazy because everyone in vanilla clicked and was trash at the game
---
40/40 in just over 7 minutes. I got stuck on Hinterlands and Swamp of Sorrows for a bit
---
Yeah i think I misunderstood the first aspect, it used to just give the new person 30 days game time IIRC
---
People had a boner for plate and tier sets. Shit other classes did it too even when their tier sets sucked ass.
---
Trade off on vanilla is escort quests where they walk at 1 mph haha. At least retail they actually run or mount with you! But ya the mount and throw stuff quests suck.
---
A warlock is a more reliable tank than a prot paladin. Get real and make a warrior like everyone else who enjoys tanking but doesn’t also enjoy having a lame ass toolkit to do so.
---
Thats actually true. You just attack and wait for SoC Proccs.
---
Tried without cheating, and made them all but only had 4min remaining. Since I tried to "work" my way from North to south, I naturally skipepd past every "dead end" zone so to speak. I mentally drove past Hinterlands at least 10 times.
---
Humans are also just boring. I get wanting to play one if you're going with the idea that it's you in this fantasy world, but personally I would just be bored playing a human.
---
Dwarves are all right I agree.
---
I hate gnomes. They look dumb, their gear looks dumb, they're a joke. Literally everyone I know who played a gnome did it cause they just thought it was funny. Which I respect, but I don't want my character to be goofy, I want them to be cool. 
---
I think NE's look really cool and always wanted them on horde. I was happy when BE were added so I could play a pretty looking elf lol. 
---
Undead I like, but like you said for humans I hate their animations. Especially running with their legs all bowed out like that and swaying from side to side. I had an undead male char in vanilla but instead i'm going female this time cause I just dont' wanna see his dumb legs while running. 
---
Tauren look dope as hell
---
Orcs look dope as hell
---
Trolls look ok, I wish they weren't so gangly tbh but female trolls have some pretty faces if you aren't someone who wants to play an "ugly" horde race. 
---
I agree Draenai looks cool too.
---
Socializing is the best exercise
---
Blizz has confirmed they are running a internal Beta right now. They probably do that like 2 Weeks and then let normal people in.
---
Thats PVE, but brawlers guild is hype

16th of July it is, then! Yeeehaaa

I'm looking forward to months of fun exploring the world... Of Warcraft.

I don’t know if that’s a great idea.

“What do you mean *someone* likes you?”

“It’s Jheddsy... from reddit...”

“What are you liking, *Jheddsy from reddit*?”

“Uhhhh...memes.”

The rogue trinket removes fear. Orc is better. It also has bloodfury.

There is a TON of these types of quests in TBC and it seems that most people say that was the best xpac of all time. Stop complaining about everything... They don't listen anyways.
---
Buy a treadmill, if your character is running, you run. Your character is not allowed to move if your aren't.
---
The only stroke I had was from your mom.
---
but how would I make that set up work?
---
The competitive nature of gamers in general is that they want to have the best numbers. If you’re an amazing DPS, everyone knows it. Tanking is, by and large, quite thankless. People slap on “he’s a good tank” if the group survived or a bad one if they didn’t. I personally take it irrationally hard when someone dies because I missed something. 
---
Behind the scenes, most people don’t know everything a tank is doing to manage every encounter. That’s not appealing for a lot of people - to work hard and not have it broadcast in a chart or meter
---
Dont be a cock. He'll be playing different areas of the game and if he comes across a bug how do you know he wont report it?
---
I have no clue how to actually have a animated wallpaper
---
I keep telling you they are trolling us, it will be December, summer in the Southern Hemisphere...and they will blame it on Oceanic players.
---
I know this seems counter productive for Blizzard, but why not launch it with 8.2? Think about the massive resub count for 1) vanilla and then 2) people just wanting to try 8.2 and then try vanilla and 3) try vanilla and then continue to mess around on 8.2. It's 1 way to get an entire player base back together and hold strong momentum.
---
Look, a lot of people are shitting on Towelliee for this, but in reality, he's right. Would we have Classic WoW if not for content creators? Fuck no.
---
Look at all the factors that made Classic WoW a reality.
---
\- Nostalrius 
---
\- The Petition
---
\- The Streamer Pledges
---
One of the reasons Nost got so big was because Sodapoppin, one of the biggest Twitch streamers, was consistently talking about it to his viewerbase. Over time, a lot of his viewerbase went to play on Nost, and those viewers got their friends into the game via word of mouth. Soda and Kungen being adamant for Legacy WoW in 2016 was the spark that had lead us to the boom we're in.
---
Also, the petition. Ye know, the one that hit 230K signatures, the one where Mark Kern literally printed out thousands of pages worth of support for the game. That never would gotten to the point where it had been if not for people like Soda, Summit, Shroud, Mitch Jones, etc, talking about Classic WoW and sharing the petition around when it was first conjured up. Jontron's Blizzard Rant video that came out after the Nost shutdown, got shitloads of people back into WoW Classic (Including Esfand, btw)
---
And the streamer petition that no doubt played a massive role had 63 streamers sign it for a combined total follower count of 14 million. Nowadays, those 63 streamers make up an audience of over 33 million followers. Those are just the ones that signed the petition though. You still have people like Dakotaz, DrLupo, Asmongold, XQC, GreekGodX, Esfand, Mizkif, Staysafe, Jake n Bake, Sonii, and thousands more that didn't sign the petition yet are going to stream it. Just those names I listed alone have a combined total follower count of over 11 million. Some of you aren't informed on any of these people and thats fine, but the fact is that Twitch has over 15 million users every single day and 140 unique users every month. This game will be the top game on Twitch FOR MONTHS, played by streamers with all different kinds of game backgrounds and viewership interests.
---
While I disagree with Toweliee's opinions of Classic WoW, he recognizes something that a lot of the Classic Wow community does not. This game's population will live and die by it's streamers.
---
Must have been a small stroke then. I'm glad you're okay
---
&gt;I have absolutely no idea what an earning call is, and frankly I don't want to know (and it's not like I'm a kid, I'm 41 btw).
---
Being ignorant on purpose can be seen as cool in some circles. I guess.
---
They could be the spouse of a regular raider, they could be somebody with a weird RL work schedule, there's a lot of reasons. It really depends on the style of guild you are trying to create. The style of guild I had in mind is one where players accept that overall raid progress will be slower, however in return the guild will be understanding of the players RL commitments and situation. 
---
I was a member of a guild like this in TBC during school and it worked out well. People were able to raid and manage their life without worrying about getting kicked out of the guild. The guild itself continued to make slow, steady progress throughout the game eventually getting to Illidan, though Sunwell was definetly off the table for us. We weren't setting any records for sure, but people were able to see and experience the content and still be a part of the community.
---
I am itching so much to do it too tbh. I love the original, including the style.
---
I just think I will enjoy Reforged more if I will not remember everything that well.
---
Unless you're sacrificing armour for it.
---
Some treadmills have an auto start stop function.
---
*Or* is it a mix of Japanese and Greek to say "I see soup" ???
---
You got those flipped. I've seen plenty of horde tattoos you're right about that and I'll agree that's neckbeard shit, but little knick knacks and stickers and "man children" is alliance stuff. 
---
Horde gets the annoying kid who just loves to annoy you and be a troll which is annoying, but alliance gets the little kids who want to be super man and think cops are the good guys
---
yeah but like would i just put my keyboard and mouse on my treadmill? that sounds uncomfortable
---
&gt; Are you suggesting Blizzard is going to pull BFA from the store to not confuse people?
---
Kind of unfair...
---
You are right and I did get carried away responding. I believe it did give actual game time in the past, I was not just "guessing" nor deliberately misleading.  I thought that made exploitable (wrong), but I do still feel it conflicts with Classic to which we can agree to disagree.
---
ABSOLUTELY!! You nailed it. I had a hard time trying to describe why I didn't like these quests. It's because it has nothing to do with my character! Or any skill! Or anything! Blizzard ruined WoW because they watered it down. Classic is the best game ever made imo, and it was because it was HARD and a grind! Stop catering to 10 year olds Blizz!

---
A wowhead poster named Ayline explains this best: 
---
"RP (Role Playing) servers are for people who prefer to get in character when they play. If you know what you are doing, RPing can be lots of fun, but it takes a little getting used to. In general on an RP realm /say, /yell, are in character or 'IC' and /guild, /trade, /general are Out of character or 'OOC' and /party depends."
---
PvE servers are 'Player Vs. Environment' with little to no focus on RP.
---
so the duel arena that's already in the game? Or more of a FFA style?
---
&gt; reach my weapon skill cap above like lvl 20.
---
That doesn't mean the weaponskill is useless. The +5 is added after, meaning that you would have exactly -5 of your weaponskill if you didn't have the talent/racial. It doesn't just "increase the cap"
---
Just scrolled thru all the comments and yours is the most toxic. Seems everyone else is having fun and joking around? Maybe chill out a bit lol
---
I think it more likely due to tanks not being very great for solo, and most people choose a class they can play solo AND with friends.  Tanks kinda tend to rely on having people to play with.. or having really high re-spec costs.
---
sacrifice the offhand damage.
---
You're the one asking for exercice while playing lol
---
Tried it in TBC. People told me I'm to slow, they wanted faster dungeon runs (was in mid TBC), then rather spent 45 min spamming lf tank in zone chat instead. Stoped caring right then and there, became a slacking random DPS ever since.
---
lol im just worried of the logistics of this being possible
---
You a little lost bud?
---
It was 4am
---
Or he doesn't know what TL;DR stands for and put it in assuming it meant "now to the point"?
---
It's mostly because tanking takes a lot of energy to play for the most part. Most warriors and ferals will tank if they are trying to gear up quickly even if they planning to focus on dps in raids. Sometimes you just want to chill and dps or farm mats once you have all the preraid gear.
---
That's only true when you're talking about 1 product.  Retail and Classic are two distinct products and they don't even have a good idea with how they overlap.  
---
Releasing 8.2 isn't going to get people to keep playing if they're playing classic, and releasing classic is only going to maintain so many subs from retail, compared to how many subs they will pull in from people not currently subscribed.

Well if the president is in charge of this decision there wont be any marketing.  Hes dying for it to fail so he can say I told you so.

FPS 7.5, must be legit!
---
Nolifing? I was part of that 10day rag kill. We could've done it a day earlier but didn't need to (we did it day before reset). I played avg. 12hour/day.
---
I mean if thats the atmosphere--who cares if the 25% attendance guy scoops up all the loot?
---
Even if you arent a progression oriented guild--there are still valid reasons for stopping people who dont show up consistently from raiding or getting loot before others.
---
Hardcore or not, how would you feels as a 90% attendance mage who is asked to sit for 25% attendance mage (RL friend of the GM?). Whether I needed loot or not--I'd be pissed. I don't show up every raid to not press my buttons. But this clown shows up once in a blue moon and snakes my spot? fuck that. 
---
IMO, there is no place for someone that flaky in a dedicated raid. Let him join the alt/pug MC run on fridays. But your main raids should be filled with your 40 most core members. If you want to make slow progress, fine. But you will make no progress if your raid team is 120 members big with 20 people who show up all the time and 100 others on rotation who have an equal shot at loot when in the raid. 
---
All loot systems begin to fall apart when the roster gets big and the attendance starts to slip.
---
No a pve server is fornplayers that do t want to engage in non convent pvp (getting ganked) a RP server is for players who want to live through there character. Everything you say in game would be in character, you never talk about the “real world” in Azeroth.

---
You're dependent on 5m cooldowns which means you pretty much have to sit in stealth when they are down, and 10m CD preparation is often required against certain classes that know what they're doing
---
Don't get me wrong, I LOVED the Troll animal forms, just not the Tauren ones.

Idk, I feel like they could benefit from having the autistic vanilla players comb through classic
---
*Give head pats*
---
Elune bless you all.
---
Look, my man, I know you have a hard on that wont go away until its launched but there is no way they launch them both on the same window.  Stop trying to talk it into existence with nonsense arguments.  Provide a source for the numbers you talk about or dont no bother bringing them up.

Thank you OP, good fun!

I wish i have time for this

[v.redd.it](https://v.redd.it) is complete trash, that's why. And how come we can't just easily click a damn direct link? I wish people wouldn't use it.
---
I even like Tauren original animal forms. I remember back 2006, I really didn't, but for some reasons 12 years later I think it looks awesome.
---
I just don't really like the Tauren girls look lol. If Trolls could be Druids, oh man my Faction choice would be much easier. Best race hands down for me
---
That aould be pretty fuckin toight.
---
Priest/ paladin/ shaman / Druid.  
---
They’re all fine to level solo. Paladin is probably the easiest to level solo with because you will be hard to kill and therefore you can solo content what others do in a group of 2. However it’s also one of the slowest levelling classes.
---
Well if we are curious for release date, when would the best time releasing this game to boost earnings for Activision / Blizzard?
---
How many players so they expect to return to wow? One million? Two million?  How much are they charging for monthly subscription these days?
---
Im 99.9% sure that there will be no EU beta realm. Every beta/ptr so far was based in NA so good luck with that
---
I'm going for it for sure, it's just that i'm having a hard time to figure out which two points to sacrifice with human racial in the equation. Some also say skip two points in offhand damage.

# Welcome to the Deadmines
---
 Winner of the "World of Warcraft Movie Contest: Rise to Power"  
---
Made in the perpetration of the cataclysm.  
---
Even though this is not "classic" it still expresses the awesome dungeon that is deadmines.
---
I think it is a dead idea. Since a classic now made on 8.x client architecture the project has to be as an addon. So you only need to develop a backend and find someone who can make you an addon for this. Otherwise, I think it will be low popular.
---
I'm currently torn between Undead and Troll for priest. I'd rather have WotF than Beserking but the priests racials make it a bit more complicated.
---
Chill dude , September is technically still summer too :P
---
You just need a monitor stand that can pivot, any monitor can be configured to be either in software.
---
I would say Druid would fit perfectly. You can do very well solo, but if I’m out leveling and need help, a Druid would be great. You can give out buffs, tank, heal, damage or a combination of the 3.
---
Yeah I'm not too worried about the class in raids. Shouldn't be that different from a fury warrior as far as raid priority and loot go.
---
But I do worry about finding dungeon groups, and feeling useless in BGs.
---
More like cat-tlestation
---
I played for years, Wow was that kindof game that even if you quit, you always came back after a while. But I quit for good at level 76-78 something. The game went downhill after wotlk was released. 
---
It all started with weird shit, things got so easy. Like people were running around with triple xp boosts, getting lvl 70 in a couple days. Instead of working hard for it. They were all of a sudden using mounts at level 20 for 10g... that used to cost 100g at lvl 40. Getting "leveling items" instead of working hard, killing bosses &amp; earning drops. They changed the speccs so you could even have two different at once &amp; swap between them, uber lame imo.
---
93%
---
Missed: Dustwallow Marsh, Feralas, and Azshara
---
So yeah, standard working hours.
---
Make it so.
---
So 2/2 expertise and 1/3 aggression out weights 3/5 off hand damage? 
---
Is this a source for this? I would love this to be the case, as it enables improved sprint earlier on.
---
If you're in the US and have some budget, eBay is a great option for getting some used stuff like graphics cards for cheap.
---
&gt; Best race hands down for me
---
Same!
---
They had a mini comic series already where Rick and Morty had a big DnD adventure. Rick went wizard (mage) and Morty went rogue.
---
New main, only reason is I can't stand the dead zone on Hunters.
---
It is possible that the system I experienced in TBC just doesn't scale out too Vanilla. 25 man raids combined with two 10 man raids with awesome loot plus a generally higher quantity of loot coming in plus more options for gear like badges made this style tractable in TBC. 
---
Maybe falling back on /roll isn't the worst idea ever for this style.
---
a class that can buff others is always a good start i think. if you throw out buffs other players are often very gratefull and emote /thanks or even whisper. but its just about embracing a helpfull paystyle. keep your eyes open and if you see another playe struggling with a mob then help him. see a player fight mobs to get to a battered chest? don't hide behind a tree until he is in fight an ninja it, help him clear and /cheer. if i team up with strangers to gather x questitems/drops i stay until we both have everything and when we part ways and i liked the player i say he can /w me if he needs help. so helping/offering help works most of the times, people tend wanting to pay it back usually by offering their help later on.
---
I mean this is just post showing the OPs gaming setup lol
---
I uhhhh...have a 7 year old PC that runs much newer games (including bfa) on Max everything. I did buy a new mouse with more buttons though.
---
You do one mistake, or worst, someone else makes a mistake, and you get shit on. That's why.
---
I was the other way around, UD rogue that always envied the stun resist. IDK, maybe there is no right answer xD
---
its a 5 man dungeon
---
I didn’t either and I played US. First time I heard VC used was late BC early LK and it was mind blowing.
---
It is to my understanding that expertise really outperforms aggression.
---
Engineering in Vanilla PvP is not an "optimization". You are talking about stuns, damage, and extreme utility items that are unattainable through any other means. Joining a PvP group, which is a group of real people spending their time together for a common goal, without having something as crucial as Engineering, is disrespectful to those who went the extra mile. It would be dragging them down, is my point, and while "muh fantasy" is absolutely allowed, it is not a type of thinking that is virtuous, or worthy of any particular respect.
---
Streaming is the new word of mouth. People just can't accept it.
---
They’re pretty huge damage buffs but it’s up to you what you prefer. Improved sprint is nice for world pvp. Just remember that sprint is a long CD in vanilla. 
---
At 60 you can drop parry and riposte for improved sprint and endurance.

get one of those standing desks w/ a treadmill. this lady in the office building across the street has one and everyday she is walking while she is on her computer
---
On the US realm I played on never saw it called VC until after Vanilla.
---
I'm setting this as my desktop background on my single monitor!
---
is that comfortable? if so i am totally down I think that would be a great leveling expirence
---
I signed up for it and I got hit with some mad nostalgia seeing the names of guilds I had long forgotten
---
Spam shadow bolt/steady shot etc sure was great flavour! I'm not saying currently retail is good, but there have definitely been better patches for class design and flavour (most of MoP comes to mind)
---
Can anyone provide context? What’s going on here
---
This comment reminds me of the scene from the Matrix Reloaded where we have to listen to the Architect speak.
---
would love to know servernames beforehand so we can decide where to go with my old guildies ;_;
---
Server worst troll hunter incoming. Complete with 55 inch TV and trackball mouse from my living room. #rollneed
---
What we all have to keep in mind here is this isn’t a *new* game. What we’re getting are legacy servers inside a pre existing game, and in my opinion, this changes the need for “hype”. 
---
Not to mention, they don’t really need the hype. The majority of people who are going to actually play classic are going to do so whether they announced the actual release date one week out or one year out. 
---
So as far as I see it, the lack of release date most likely comes from them legitimately not knowing when it will be done.
---
Yes fighting orcs as a rogue was always a nightmare.  And I do agree if you're trying to max both PvP and PvE Orc is the better choice.
---
So many people are going to wipe after the first boss, when the patrol comes behind them and everyone forgot about that
---
i dunno dog, i havent done it myself...i do have a standing desk tho. i use it a lot and like it.

---
Telling you now if you aren't aware of how blizz does betas, don't get your hopes up for being in the first wave of invites unless you specifically know you're on a friends and family list at blizzard. They could do it differently, but almost every beta they have done since the D3 beta have been like this at first. Very few non-f&amp;f people get in at first.
---
You can be fine with half bis or even next to no bis pieces (depending on role/class/spec), so long as your other pieces are relevant/decently strong. BiS literally just means Best in Slot, whether by 50% or .01% power difference.  
---
As a healer I am not even remotely worried about pre-raid bis outside of a few key pieces like Robes of the Exalted because it's stupid good.
---
Paladin/Shaman and you will recieve a lot of whispers for dungeon runs and stuff
---
Swimming is the way to do it on either side. Wanna head to WC as ally? Go to westfall swim to BB and boat to ratchet. For horde going to DM, either grom’gul or BB and swim to westfall.
---
Smart, play both sides. That way you always come out on top.
---
u over thinking it homie
---
relax
---
It’s in between recently bandaged, and if you grind level efficient mobs you can balance on spirit regen surprisingly well. But I’m not saying a warr should take int/spi rings and such
---
UBRS/LBRS will be the only 10 man dungeon in Classic. It’s very easy to find people for it because it drops great gear for every class and everyone has to do the Onyxia attunement.
---
They report earnings in early August but their quarter ends well before that. It depends on how they want to spin the discussion. I too think they will want to release before their earnings report, especially since their digital subscriber numbers were on the decline with the exception of King.
---
When TBC did that the first time in Hellfire it was considered amazing, now just like the "Poop" quests it's lost it's novelty because instead of trying new things it's a lazy fucking rehash.             
---
            
---
Still for it's time it was really cool but I'm fairly certain just in BFA theres at least 2 world quests that do it plus 2-3 leveling quests
---
Hunters cant use maces, shamans cant use swords.. at least there's that lol
---
That's what I thought - imagine a bunch of people using the XP boost to get ahead of everyone else in the race to 60.
---
As a lazy person you’ll especially love farming out soul shards.
---
At the very launch of WoW, there were no player caps on instances.  There were 30+ man zergs of Scholo and Strath.
---
&gt; WotF really isnt a huge deal in pvp
---
What now
---
I can deal with the TV as a monitor but jesus christ get a better keyboard and mouse.
---
I feel like the only person who hated Scarlet Monastary. Just kind of boring and linear. I'd love it as a warrior swimming in all the loot, I guess
---
I've never seen a warrior with a staff on pservers, also most ranged weapons are better for warrior/rogue since fast ranged weps are not good for hunters
---
for me its just the class in vanilla, I tend to solo que in pvp alot during my downtime and in just not interested in playing MS as a solo spec.
---
If DKs were in classic I would tank in a heartbeat for the same reason
---
I mean, it was fun when it was used sparingly, but it became so common that its just "free exp" and the quests are boring and bleh
---
Thinking I will make a gnome warlock alt and maybe turn into a main! I think hunter is going to be my first go-to. I have played Warlock, but I don't think I made one until way late into my WoW life, like... either cata or panda?
---
I’m a die hard packers fan but also coming from a Sooners fan, you got the biggest steal in the draft. Rodney Anderson is an absolute freak. If he didn’t get injured he would’ve been the first RB off the board. I hope he stays healthy and plays well for you guys. Go pack go!
---
wallpaper engine in steam, it's like $3 or something.

will be your best steam purchase ever I promise
---
Sorry, but it happened.  He joined the army right out of high school. He had just discharged and moved back to town with his wife.  We ran into each other in the frozen food section of the local grocery store.
---
Camp red ridge 24/7 everyone in the server will know you
---
I really do fear engineering will be a pvp “necessity” this time around.
---
It’s always been good—very good. But in 2004/5/6 people didn’t realize by how much, some did but millions of us didn’t.
---
In classic wow of 2019, everyone who doesn’t have their head in the sand will get engineering. I believe there is a real chance of engineering becoming an obscenely dominating profession. 
---
In 2005/6 the servers best pvpers has engineering. In 2019, anyone who knows where the battlemasters are located will have engineering. 
---
Having all 10 classes with grenades, boots, mc helms and reflectors and running into that seemingly more often than not will be very annoying.
---
Absolutely you are probably right about the %, they also batter you because their spells do more damage = same downtime
---
No, we didn't play on the same server.  I can't recall what server he played on, but I know it wasn't the same as mine (hyjal)
---
Any source on that?
---
I can't wait for them to be called rouge in general chat
---
Might depend on when/where I rerolled an ally character on a later released vanilla server and people would advertise as VC, possibly due to a ton of the population being former horde. This was on Balnazar US
---
Later on I rolled on a private server, and people just called Deadmines DM on both sides
---
Yeah we'll see.  They were probably completely joking about the "classic summer" thing, and everything else is just coincidence.
---
It's all about earnings revenue. Many fans need to understand this, even if Activision goes about it the wrong way.
---
Don't see any new products on the horizon.

---
Gross.
---
Can someone explain me what's with the "dog" stuff in every classic screenshot? Thank you.
---
A hunter, regardless of race, will never be worst at anything. He should still smack everyone else while leveling, and raiding at 60 is a different beast because they aren’t taken for dmg anyways.
---
Ya the good old days! Coordination and communication was key.
---
It's just there...

I am aware that some people cannot cope with having their opinions challenged or self-adulation ridiculed. However, the fact that you and/or OP cannot cope with that, doesn't make this comment is trolling.
---
It just means you can go cry me a river :-)
---
Not everybody has the skill to tank, especially in classic and tbc. You have barely any aoe moves on the class itself. 
---
Also you need to make the calls and set the pace. 
---
It‘s like in rl on your job, not everybody has the ability to lead!
---
lol the trackball mouse is a requirement for playing from my couch with the keyboard on my lap
---
Its completely underselling Paladin utility too. At no point did it mention seal/judge system, or the BoP/BoSac spells.
---
I see you got your potion ready =)
---
100% with 6:42 left, ez clap
---
I hope you bought a back brace
---
Having such a hard time deciding between maining/alting a troll rogue and an orc shaman or an orc rogue and a troll shaman. I love each of those combinations.
---
I personally know 2 Grand Marshalls who got their title without engineering. Your retail attitude is bullshit.
---
It was a level 31 talent in a patch prior to 1.12
---
the first question is pointless by the way, I'd be surprised if anyone chooses anything other than &gt;1500 hours
---
Going to Goldshire Inn and thoroughly testing the RP capabilities...
---
Opinion challenged? Man, I don't have an opinion. Just pointing out your blatant hypocrisy.
---
Youre the one who has gotten into the comment weeds and opened up with "Millions of other people...have other things to be proud of in their life" suggesting an air of superiority to the OP...yet here you are...in a back and forth over the thread you don't believe warrants its own existence. 
---
Puzzling levels of lack of self awareness.

---
Use this if you want imp sprint and endurance for leveling, especially if you plan on PvPing while leveling.
---
DW talent isnt that important cause you won't have good weapons anyway.
---
And 1 point into aggression won't make any difference either.
---
You'll want to pick those talents up for raiding as they increase you damage more so than Imp Sprint/Endurance, but you'll be fine without them while leveling.
---
Great job bro, do with what you have. Not everyone has $10,000 to spend on a top of the line setup. I really appreciate you posting this.
---
we'd probably have to purchase that new original content if it was truly 'new'.
---
More responsibility, and more effort. Some people on here are saying it's all to do with numbers, I don't buy that. pservers are full of warriors, and many of them refuse to tank, so obviously there are other reasons than just a lack of people playing tank capable classes.
---
 Even on retail wasn't that why Blizz added more classes that could tank and it barely made any difference, because people simply don't want to tank.
---
http://liquidcode.org/~lostman/wow/dkeserver.se/stuff/angwe/
---
Done. The questions were very odd though, I don't see how those could help at all..
---
Of course! I rolled a rogue just for this! roflmao
---
You'd better have a hell of a chiropractor. Why not get a Corsair Lapdog or something??
---
Really hope they will add it in. Got 5 friends who wanna go on a rp pvp server with classic.

Ohh gaawd the death furnace room
---
 "who let that goblin run away??"
---
 LF1M mage for deadmines.
---
Just be a good player and people will want you in your group. Lots of DPS classes bring utility to groups that will make you wanted.
---
For example, a mage would be sought after for your food and water, your CC, and your high DPS.
---
Lots of times I add other DPS to my friends list and ask them to join first simply because I know they're talented and a run will be smooth with them.
---
For all the reasons stated here, but also one that people overlook.
---
Tanks gear up really fast, they can get into groups very easily, so they blow through content quickly. Maybe they spend a couple days focusing on all the dungeons they need and then that's it. So not only are they the least played, they move past content faster than other classes.
---
&gt;(who dpesmt just use their phone nowadays?)
---
gross. I use that to talk to people.
---
Friends don't let friends play Alliance =P
---
Lol my Rogue's name is Lasers before I quit BFA.
---
I mean at least you'd be able to lean back on the couch instead of hunching over a coffee table. That seems miserable.
---
What the fuck is poopsock?
---
It has nothing to do with the US though? Seasons aren't just arbitrarily determined by picking some day on a calendar. They're derived from the position and rotation of our planet in relation to the sun.

So on a Sunday?
---
Naaah, Sunday is a holy day, it can't be!
---
Agreed
---
Well I’ll be damned today I learn a mixture of Greek and Japanese
---
This is how I manage to make so many friends in games. I always run heals/medic/support. When you have fun helping other people do their job better they tend to keep you around. 
---
In everquest I would spend hours buffing people with my shaman in low to mid level areas and I was sad to see there wasn't something equivalent for spiking power on other players when I switched to WoW. 
---
So there are support players out there but just like tanks we often aren't looking for groups because a couple people already have standing offers for us. 
---
My plan for vanilla is to get back to helping carry folks through 5 mans so they can get some BiS gear and start slapping MC.
---
Thank goodness. We will need them. :)
---
That's why I have a trackball mouse, so I can lean back on the couch with my mouse on the couch next to me. The keyboard goes on my lap already
---
10k?? Ok
---
DKP works well too. 
---
Joe the 25% attendance raider can feel happy seeing his effort directly translated into points he can spend on WHATEVER item he wants. If he is there and BRE drops, and he has the DKP to outbid the 90% attendance folks--fuck it, its his. But what that means is Joe had to save for months  just to get competitive with the top guys. It means your 90% attendance guys may have the sword, or if they dont--they probably have comparable DKP to joe and theyve been able to acrue all the armor already. 
---
Meanwhile a max bid from Joe cleans him out for damn near 6 months. Making sure other warriors scoop up all the armor and interceding weapons. 
---
Now we are on AQ, your 90% guys will eventually kill Cthun, have a chance at Dark Edge. Joe wont get invited to that raid, with 25% attendance, it is no small wonder he doesnt have a Nature Resist set. 
---
But Joe can keep showing up to MC and BWL runs. Your core raiders are less interested in MC/BWL. We know we have to run it weekly for bindings and other odds and ends, but most of us need little/nothing. So your 25% attendance folks are desirable in that they fill out the raid. 
---
At the end of the day, the system needs to appear to apportion loot consistently. If the guild says they will issue loot to benefit progression--always. Then give loot to a 40% attendance spriest over a 90% attendance mage--thats a problem. If you flat out say the MT, GM and officers will get first dibs on loot--any you can find a raid of folks okay with that--go for it. 
---
Whether its rolls, LC, SK, DKP the system needs to be consistent. Your 90% DKP raider should have as good of an idea of how many more Onslaught Girdles need to drop for him to reasonably have one, as does your 25% attendance player on SK.
---
damn that was quick
---
Imagine how nuts the forums/sub would go if there was a post that just said "Coming" or "Release" or... ok now this sound sexual.
---
Another post already about this?
---
You mad nerd ?

What?  Summer goes for 2 months after July 16th.  Sit down.
---
I misread modestly for a sec and was like uhhh... swifty? Then reread. I’ll have to check this guy out.
---
&gt;Ye but Horde never did Deadmines
---
Maybe on PvP servers, but on the RP server I played on, plenty of Horde ran it for the Defias set.  Same as plenty of Alliance ran WC for the Fang set.
---
Not much different than the PS4 to me. Just gotta boost up the UI scale
---
if I identify as rooster, then what? :)
---
If it makes you feel any better, Alliance are the monstrous dishonorable gankers from a Horde perspective.
---
Entering Hillsbrad Foothills at lv 20 when I all I want to do is quest a /wave Alliance gnomes but you humans come and wreck our shit constantly. And it's not even a fair fight. Alliance quests are like 35 there. Honestly, I think it's the reason Horde ever goes to Redridge besides the occasional exploration.
---
But at the end of the day, I think we can all agree that Undead are the worst. And Gnomes.
---
Well that just further strengthens the case for a Lapdog! You're  just planning to balance the keyboard on your legs??
---
I like to live dangerously
---
Right?  When Dire Maul came out I saw people starting to use VC and I was so confused what the hell VC was and why higher levels were suddenly looking to run DM. 
---
Didn't help that I've never liked Dire Maul.  It sits with Maraudon as my least liked vanilla dungeons.
---
this
---
sad thing though is you'll be an ugly cow if you play horde
---
New main, I was undead female rogue before, going orc female rogue this time around :P I only learned too late that one of the undead female model's weapon is skewed all weird as fuck and it breaks my enjoyment of certain weapons. Especially fist weapons. They never fixed it until the new WoD models, and since there's no option to use those models, gonna have to wave goodbye to my pretty corpse lady.
---
this sub seems fine to me personally. People are a little toxic about some content creators but I get a pretty welcoming vibe here.
---
I'll be Main tank and guild master at release, I'd like responsability on top of my responsibilities please.
---
I will be rolling a FuryTank Warrior for classic, I've watched a lot of Skarn's videos on the topic of doing it and it seems pretty straight forward just doing a bit of stance dancing. How do people feel about having this kind of tankin in dungeons/raids?
---
&gt; https://imgflip.com/i/30nnpp  
---
https://imgflip.com/i/30nohh
---
Not to mention getting unreasonably blamed for mistakes others make
---
What are those buttons in the need/greed dialogue? Strange
---
As a rogue, every time I fought a paladin it's been a huge mistake on my part. I basically won't mess with any paladin unless he's wearing full cloth.
---
It is a weird feeling at first but when it’s you or them you make the decision pretty fast.
---
You mean “code red” Mountain Dew
---
So the conclusion here... 
---
30% of the mobs cant be kited, but they cast spells and die faster than armored, melee mobs. When you hamstring kite you take damage, but it’s a blow for blow scenario. It makes killing 70% of the mobs in the game deal less damage to your warrior. The other 30% are very squishy and you can faceroll them, and every now and then you might face off against a stronger caster that will deal some damage to you, definitely something you can’t avoid through hamstring kiting. However, thats not really the point here. Hamstring kiting is meant to be used to lower your downtime and keep your warrior essentially topped off so you’re not eating after every mob. Not only is this a huge efficiency gain on 70% (i repeat, 70%, a large majority of the mobs you will fight) of the mobs, but I’ve also never really run into any caster mobs that “batter” my warrior. If anything, they’re pure joy to kill and I waste them in 4 hits using heroic strike.
---
No release date, but didn't the beta date get leaked? May 24th from what I saw.
---
Yup, 20% of all groups are tanks until raids then its 7.5% to 10%.
---
You guys having fun here in the comments?
---
I'm not sure on the exact particular numbers; what you're saying sounds correct, in terms of more hit = more dmg, but then the argument in this case should be "do these two bottom tier talents outperform talents located at the top of the tree of either sub/ass that I would get later because I want to spend points in talents I value personally" 
---
The other argument is that more points in combat means less mid tier talents in other trees, but you'll most likely reroll at 60 so this argument doesn't matter at all.
---
[Glorious!](https://i.imgur.com/pk86Zhj.jpg)
---
Can you link the Wallpaper? Thats pretty nice. Your setup looks really comfy too. Good job.
---
How do you enjoy a game sober? It’s hard af to be drunk / high and pay attention to what’s going on imo
---
I played a Rogue in vainllla and loved it. 
---
My RL friends and I started on a private server and since one of us played Rogue I decided to play shaman healer which also was the first faction switch. Played mage on a tbc private server and a Druid on retail during WoD. 
---
I thought about what I’ll be going for in Classic and while Rogue is my Go to, mage is the fastest and shaman I’ll be having the most fun with.
---
I am going to use what you said to go off topic and say something you may not want me to say.
---
"There is no information so memes" is basically why WoW has become shit.
---
Memes are easily digested content that any scrub in the world can take a quick look at and get a little bit of enjoyment.
---
Discussions are way more hard to digest, take way more energy to get into and you only get as much out of it as you put in to it.
---
Its also a lot easier make a meme than to think of an interestesing discussion to post.
---
The last patch they released for WC3 is super good and a lot of dev support for custom maps was added and it wouldn’t have happened if hey weren’t preparing it for reforged so I love it!
---
Yup, very hard to fake it as a tank.  It’ll be obvious if you don’t know what to do.  
---
Having said that I think it’s a lot easier than people think and if you just say you don’t know the fights/pulls people are pretty understanding and will help you out.
---
No idea what thing that is. :D
---
What class do you play. We got windfury on this side
---
This was a good meme, thanks for the chuckle.
---
For sure, there are definitely times when you get popped and just have to throw your hands up. And being cd dependent isn’t perfect, but at least the cds are pretty powerful when they’re up.
---
It was DM before 1.3 ....
---
Is that one of those standing lift desks I see advertised all the time on my Facebook and Instagram?
---
I was hoping for dickbutt
---
The position and rotation of our planet in relation to the sun is different depending on where you live on the planet!!!
---
Premed is my shit. It's so great for murdering random dudes 1V1 WPVP. I love dropping a big ambush on someone and having 4 combo points, backstab then evis. If you''re not wearing plate or mail you're in serious trouble. Very underrated talent.
---
I started out writing my journey through classic till today, But only writing about Classic plus Nostalrius. The text written was about 7000 characters long... I will maybe post a standalone thread of it instead. But to stay a bit more on topic ill write the realy TL;DR version. 
---
My first ever character was a Tauren hunter, i rolled it because i thought Taurens could cast Entangling Roots. Even if i was sad i wouldnt be able to cast living roots on my enemies i continued leveling that hunter(very badly, EXTREMLY badly) till level 33. When i rerolled a Tauren Warrior, now knowing abilities was tied to the class and not the race i wanted to protect and lead others. So i tanked alot of dungeons and never reached max level at all in classic.
---
I played the warrior untill the release of Mists of Pandaria, which was the first time in 7 years i played anything other than the Warrior. I rerolled a Monk which i played Brewmaster. Half way through MoP though i fell out on Retail and instead started playing on a TBC private server, that server had increased the XP rate to 14 times faster than what it was in TBC. So i had the opportunity to try out new classes and fell in love with the Druid.
---
Ever since discovering the Druid on that private server i have not played any other class as a main character for the simple reason that Druids can do everything. They can be a ranged Dps, a Tank, a Melee Dps and a Healer. Played Feral on Nostalrius and did all available content there before it was shut down and dabbled a bit on a DK in Legion aswell.
---
In the end i've played a Warrior, Monk, Druid and Death Knight. Tanking on all of them and now can't see a future playing a class that arn't able to tank.
---
Was the Thunderbrew Lager quest always repeatable or is that just a private server thing?
---
You realize they just had their Q1 review and talked about all of this?
---
Alliance is for people who only care about "pretty character models" and having an easier time winning BGs due to map imbalance.
---
You'll want tailoring for the BoP robes
---
DM was Deadmines until 1.3 and I refuse to yield the name just because the jumbled mess of Dire Maul came along.
---
Got only 30/40, tho I didnt play wow in english until mop, so I had trouble figuring out some english spells and names.
---
Deadmines was DM until 1.3 and I refuse to yield the name to the jumbed mess that is Dire Maul.
---
Odd question, but is that a "Door"? I ask because I did that myself. Solid Core door, sanded/stained and finished with clearcoat. Attached some cheap legs from Menards, but working on getting some better ones soon.
---
Why were you running in the grocery store?
---
Yes, it's a pretty big deal for a lot of players, RP-PVP Servers are amazing with tons of great events, the thing that makes them different from just normal PVE or PVP servers is they have special rule sets that were enforced during vanilla, like naming restrictions and rules regarding griefing/trolling, giving the server a much more stable and friendly community.
---
It's a bit much.
---
Its all in good fun. Perhaps you just lack strength and honor!
---
The main challenge of raiding in vanilla is finding 40 reliable players that come prepared for the raids.
---
Which is harder than you'd think
---
Also, a year in, getting BiS should be a lot easier, since nobody will actually want the item drops in dungeons ;-)
---
I played a Ret/Holy paladin in Vanilla along with a shaman and rogue.
---
I really want to be a paladin again but I know I'm going to go Ret and I really worry I'm seeing things through rose colored glasses, not really remembering all the times I was turned away from a group as ret and how bad you can be kited in PVP.
---
I'm torn between going back and reliving my wow life as a paladin or going the opposite direction and trying something I never would have like a mage or priest.  I did like healing and I want to be alliance so my shaman is out.
---
Was ret really that bad?
---
That gave me anxiety
---
Link for the chair?
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bm35vz/what_should_i_play_wednesdays_may_08_2019/
---
My personal favorites are the people who complain about how easy retail is, yet they play a raiding mage. 
---
Not that healing or tanking is especially difficult, but when compared to a mage, the dynamic play or heals or the multi buttoned and reactive play of tanks is worlds apart.
---
Basic prot warrior abilities are revenge, sunder, shield block, bash, slam, demo/battle shout, stance dancing for zerker rage/tclap....That doesnt include wall, last stand, taunt, bloodrage, or disarm.
---
a raiding mage? Frostbolt, mana shield, fire ward, blink (may have cold snap, block, barrier talented--or pom/AP)
---
Prot tank is the most involved spec in the game. Followed  by healers who have to judge the incoming damage, their cast progress and cast strength and react with the response being realized within 2.5s. 
---
DPS has to dodge bad (like everyone else) press their 1-3 button rotation and watch a threat meter. 
---
DPS is easy and you need 20+ of them. Heals are engaging, but you need 10-12 per raid. Tanking is engaging but you only need 3-4 full time tanks. 
---
DPS isnt as much fun, but its easy to get a spot and out of raids you feel powerful. Heals is fun, its easy to get a spot and out of raids you feel impotent. Tanking is fun, its a pain in the ass to get a spot and out of raids you feel incomplete (and if you never get into raids, you feel useless).
---
Hmmm, no thanks.
---
Why is there a *plant* between you, your keyboard and your monitor?
---
I remember this distinctly from my time playing back then.  I guess itll be a hurdle this time around too when populations fluctuate.
---
20k people signed up and I only recognize a couple from my server (arthas us alliance)
---
Looks good , doesn't work.
---
This is gonna destroy your back.
---
Unless you have most of your prebis, don't. Please meet your healer halfway. Your healer will likely be holy/resto spec. It would make for a much better run particularly when you're a fresh 60. 
---
For raiding, unless your dps is threat-capped... probably setting yourself up for being the point of blame on a wipe.
---
Fake, no corpses
---
Yes there was not an expectation for things to be fast, but it's not so bad if you have a decent group rolling through with proper pulls.  Mark, CC, LOS pulls, focused dps to burn down each mob in turn, rinse and repeat.  Get in a rhythm and can move through quick without unintended aggro or delays.
---
I take it you will roll Alliance maybe? Just a wild guess
---
I went into the newer PS that launched last year not knowing much(forgot the name)
---
Leveled a warlock hopped in MC and after a few runs, the first 6 or so bosses died with ease. 
---
I had no idea that this was going to happen so I ended up not logging on anymore. Figured I would wait for the "normal" difficulty of classic.
---
With all that said, the leveling process was fun :)
---
[https://imgur.com/a/rO1WvWZ](https://imgur.com/a/rO1WvWZ)
---
This seems to often be the case. Most guilds in most MMOs I've been in, the GM has been the MT.
---
 The dragon at the end of the deathknight zone was pretty nifty. You could actually take damage from the ballistas so it wasn't just completely mindless.
---
But in general, yeah, the vehicle quests just don't feel very well done to me.
---
As they always say: It's ready when it's ready. You can't rush these things. Have patience, young padawan.
---
Also pre-bis for feral druids. Devilsaur gloves + pants were so good.
---
Uhh, yeah dude.  Blizz is thinking about not making any PvP servers.  If more people RP'd this shit would be top of the page 24/7.
---
It's a different kind of challenging - much more endurance with a focus on efficiency/maintaining high output vs dodging/manipulating mechanics. Also most classes had less to do  in vanilla (less homogenization and simpler rotations) so since you were 'stuck in your lane' you were expected to be a master of that lane!
---
The vanilla beta had an EU Server tho.
---
They actually got me for a second because I get no service at work and that article was the first thing i saw and i freaked out thinking i missed the announcement...only to be thoroughly disappointed 2 seconds later. Clickbait..
---
Out of the millions of players, I would say that's not unusual. Tip of the iceberg, right? ;)
---
Signed up. Already found 3 guildies from back in the day. How can I contact them though?
---
The infrequent raiders problem is the glaringly hole in Suicide Kings. 
---
Some guilds that used it had attendance quotas required for priority.  But that has its own problems as well, like people only showing up on farm nights, or nights they can see upgrades and skipping progression nights.  
---
I'm not really a fan of suicide kings because it encourages the lowest effort possible and because your position moves up relative to other people even if you don't attend.
---
It also has the problem of people simply retaining their position and skipping out on upgrades that are smaller impact (like bracer or belt) to retain their position for higher impact upgrade (like MH weapon).  So it can actually be wasteful in that way.
---
Anyone else excited for things that wont happen and where you wouldnt be able to do shit
---
You going to play rogue again come classic? Can't decide if I want to play something I was really familiar with or try something new and a new faction.
---
It's definitely fun for a bit, but it does get old after a while. It becomes less satisfying to 1v1 when you have the advantage and are unable to 1vX consistently.
---
I imagine many rogues who mained in vanilla will be rerolling something else this time around, maybe just twink a rogue
---
Man, this is an amazing idea...
---
Nice disenchant button nerd
---
Such a relaxing set up!! Jealous.
---
extremely well known pserver player who achieved r14 on 3-4 warriors
---
streams and is part of high end pve guilds asw
---
Wow so proud of you
---
That sounds right to me.
---
Nice setup! But what's up with the two fan on the left up against the back of the case? Is there air intake from there?
---
Build a reputation as a tank and you will have your choice of any dungeon you want to do.
---
So forgettable, even the server with its name was forgotten!
---
I can feel the endporphan rush from clicking the compete quest button
---
Sounds like you got a worthless degree to me then.
---
Helmet seems a little out of place.. is this normal or is it because of new character models?
---
Mark this NSFW.
---
Na all the content has been theorycrafted to the max on private servers. Players today know everything there is to know about Classic raiding. On private servers newly released raids are cleared within an hour of release. It’s safe to say that raiding in Classic will be a complete joke compared to 2004 when everything was new and unknown.
---
They should have some form of contact posted I think
---
The Last of Us Part 2 is about the only thing I'm equally as excited for as I am Classic WoW.
---
I'm not against it, just worried that adding these servers will water down the distributed population even more. This is a legit concern despite your all's downvoting any other reasonable reply in these threads. Besides, there's like a post a day on this pretty much with the same people just saying the same thing over and over.
---
Screen too far. Judgement has been passed
---
What do you do for a living? My bank account just died looking at this
---
In vanilla I mostly played fury warrior. My main alts were shaman and hunter, though I played everything eventually.
---
TBC was mostly paladin and warrior, WotLK was mostly death knight and warrior...
---
In and out of the game in WotLK, left for good in Cata (again mostly warrior). BFA got me back temporarily and I had fun getting through the expansions I never got to see, still playing warrior...
---
After all this time my choices for Classic are still stuck between warrior, shaman, and hunter. As much fun as I had with the other classes, especially rogue and mage, I just can't pull away from those three.
---
Fury Warrior is my go-to but I decided to play resto shaman this time, and then I decided hunter would be better in the long run...
---
Also played alliance briefly on private servers. Not bad but I like the Horde content too much. ;)
---
So, less time due to work and all but I'm still going to play the same old thing. lol
---
You can bet your ass I’m rolling need on dalrends if I play hunter.
---
Wait he actually likes Classic now? I remember a long time ago when he would just shit on it all the time thinking the classic wow movement was stupid.
---
This isn't really about "growing balls" because the concern girlfriends/wives have is very reasonable. After getting off work, commuting home, and taking care of basic chores around the house, most of us would be lucky to have 3 hours straight of free time. Now imagine a video game occupying the entirety of those precious 3 hours. It is reasonable for our partners to be upset by this.

The mature thing to do would be to rework how much you play, or at least figure out how to adjust it so that you're not totally neglecting your partner and kids. If I were in OP's position with a family, I'd either play for only a few days a week for a prolonged period of time or I would play shorter sessions with long breaks in them. This way I can still read to my kids, show my partner I care about her, and also take care of basic adult things like cleaning up a bit around the house.
---
If they money grab like that I'll play a private server

Satisfaction!

But Master Yoda says I should always be mindful of the future

I play both factions

I want to believe.

In the midst of the keyboard/mouse debate, I'd like to throw in the option to just connect your controller (there are USB bluetooth adapters for it). Who knows, maybe the existing addon that helps with the controls will work in Classic (same client, after all). It's at least a good option for doing some mindless grinding.

Saw that as well, it seems promising. All aboard the hype train!

I tried clicking on them and nothing opens up.
---
I have 8 Vacation days left and want to know when I should request them and a few sick days after....
---
Agreed, when I play private servers it's always around 30 that I get burned out
---
if you don't play classic in 4:3 stretched are you really playing classic
---
Hi, everyone. A friend and I will both be playing classic. He's playing a warrior (alliance, race unknown). I'm trying to decide whether to play a paladin or priest to accompany him in both PvE and PvP. Things to consider:
---
1. semi-regular play. We're probably talking about 15-20 hours per week for each of us, mainly together.
---
2. When leveling, more than half of that will be done in dungeons as a tank/healer pair.
---
3. At endgame, we'll probably be focused as 75% PvE and 25% PvP (battlegrounds).
---
4. depending on our mood, we're both willing to respec for PvE/PvP purposes.
---
5. There could also be a bad hunter with us some of the time.
---
I'm fine with both playstyles. I think i probably lean a little more towards the priest playstayle, as I like the PvP/solo flexibility of switching to shadow. But, I would gladly bypass that for decided advantage as a pair in PvE/PvP. How would you approach this? What advice would you have? What would you choose?
---
There is also the issue of dungeons vs raids. 1 out of 5 people need to be tanks for a dungeon vs what, 2-4 tanks for a 40 man for the most part? that is still 1 out of 10 people. if you want to do the same thing in a raid vs dungeon, it is easier to be a dps or healer.

---
Nope!
---
STV is good, but Un’Goro has the juiciest quest log porn. We’re talking close to 20 complete quests if done properly.
---
Sounds like a great journey to me.
---
Me not that kind of Orc!
---
Huh, I dunno then. Maybe try hopping into their discord server and asking a mod? I would’ve thought that would’ve been a thing
---
Nah in the context of classic Vs BfA then it's very clear tanking in BfA is better. On the class level, anyway. 
---
Keep in mind though my previous post referenced TBC tanking. That's the context of my posts.
---
When I say tanking has gone to shit, I mean it has gone to shit mostly since TBC.   
---
However, it's also gone to shit since vanilla in one aspect I really miss. It's *impossible* to die in dungeons now. It just doesn't happen. Real life zombies can smash their keyboard and complete a dungeon.

I could hardly control myself. I always thought night elfs were the coolest race to play in wc3 and to actually experience an entire world through a night elf's perspective was just... WoW

Half of the classes can effectively tank and do it well in retail yet tank is still heavy in demand

There is only a huge demand for tanks in dungeons, the demand drops off heavily in raids and this mismatch is probably the primary culprit. In dungeons you need 1/5 (20%) of the playerbase tanking, this drops to 2 or 3 tanks (5-7.5%) in most raid fights. (And yes, I'm aware there are specific fights which require more tanks but that's largely irrelevant, no guild is going to carry an extra 5 tanks through the entire game just to use them on one fight, they're just going to funnel tanking gear to some of their dps warriors).

&gt;Just something I threw together. Here you go
---
Doesnt matter, nice wallpaper ! Thank you !
---
Does it though? I'm not a reddit expert, but I don't see how this breaks any rule. It says in the first line "may be removed" meaning none of those things are actually against the rules, it's just up to the mods discretion. I feel like most people are enjoying the content, and as you mentioned classic has been theory crafted to death so new discussions aren't really a thing. The memes are all we really have.
---
Over $15 huh
---
Removed **Rule 1:** Content must relate to World of Warcraft: Classic.
---
10:1 says they announced it would be going away to stir up purchases in the short term--as the current mount will likely not come back. The current system goes offline on June 11? So about a month before the "tinfoil hat" date of 7/16. Who wants to bet there will be a brand new RAF for classic giving you a new mount on retail coming out in accordance with classic release?
---
I played horde in vanilla and when my friend up through to legion. My friends picked alliance for some reason so I gave it a try and I have to say. Fuck alliance cities. Darnassus had potential, if they gave a shit about it. Ironforge was cool. Stormwind is kinda meh. Nothing really beats Org for me. Sitting on the bank. Jumping on the bank. Logging off on the bank, logging on on the bank. Shouting for groups on the bank...bank.
---
What if... you use the search function to find 20 threads just like this one?
---
Not much. 3-4 hours per week before Naxx comes out.
---
Guilds are the way to go if you want your gear early. If you're taking it slow, then you will have more leverage as a free agent.
---
&gt;Its just numbers
---
Yes, and the question is "why are the numbers so low?" The answer is very obviously "Because most people do not want the responsibility of being the group leader/babysitter/meatshield/dungeon sherpa". Your answer is effectively "there are so few because there are so few"
---
It was fixed in the demo client similar to how private servers fix it. You can't jump up a wall more than one time before falling off.
---
I sure hope so bud I’m ready at the drop of a hat
---
This guy is farming mad karma by posting his level 120 rogue in vanilla gear that he just finished collecting.
---
Level 20 is like... not even a quarter of the grind—just a heads up
---
Yeah at least on the private servers ive tried having high spirit is a blessing  to leveing
---
Brilliant... but it’s about profits not stability on launch day. I would imagine.
---
Couldn't remember the difference between Alterac Mountains and Arathi Highlands
---
Hillsbrad, deadwind pass, Alterac Mountains, Hinterlands
---
Can you add a way to put multiple contact infos on your thing? I found an old guildmate on the site with their discord info but they've got their profile set to not accept PM's so I can't contact them.
---
I'm 100% going to play a rogue. Just not sure if it will be my main this time. I'm leaning towards a shaman main. I level as a daggers rogue so it can be a little slow, so having a main who can funnel drops, cloth, potions and gold to my rogue will make things a little smoother this time around. But I will definitely try to keep the rogue in the same level range so I can get bloody vengeance on people who mess with the shaman. Or just follow them around for 30 minutes, waiting for the ideal time to strike, and never actually commit to it. That's a good time too.
---
does it chew up alot of cpu usage or anything??
---
I thought about remaking my Human Paladin but looks like all my friends want to go Horde this time. I think I was to play a more engaging class to level and overall "stronger" class. I'll be going Priest I think.
---
Then I would tell you I had done just that (searched for "classic release" "secret release" "unannounced release" "release date") and came out with 0 posts on the first page of each of those searches relating to my topic.
---
Set up screams PVE server to me.  Could be wrong though.
---
Priest shield+wand is a more interesting/faster lvling process? In what world?
---
Make friends with a good Druid and join a premade as a pair. A single Rogue running around and trying to solo cap bases in AB is "meh" but a coordinated Rogue + Druid is an actual nightmare for the other team.
---
Read his post again. He said seldom is it exactly 10 minutes not over 10 minutes period. His style is long discussion type videos. That's just the way that it is. I don't see how this is lies or misinformation.
---
Removed rule 3.
---
Well... it's ALSO because all the other things listed here (I didn't feel the need to say the same thing everyone else was saying over and over). You need fewer per runs (even in retail you usually need more healers than tanks in raids).
---
This is basic economics... supply and demand. Not only is the demand heavy (fewer need in content) the supply is low (slower to level, not needed for PvP)...  
---
Weird that my comment is getting downvotes... it's just a fact. There are fewer tanking specs so there are going to be fewer tanks. WHO KNEW!? Oh well.
---
Uses on average 0.5% for me, and that's while having 3 heavily animated wallpapers
---
Thanks for the feedback. I can definitely pull off 3-4 hours a week. I am definitely looking for an Alliance progression guild. Will have to browse the forums more once a release date is announced. Have to figure out the best alliance server and whatnot.. will probably go PvP realm cause that's the way it's meant to be even though I don't like PvP haha... can't wait!

Can't imagine pserver performance will differ much from retail. With that said, I play max settings on pservers on an Acer Aspire E15 with these specs:  
---
* i5-8250u
---
* 8gb RAM
---
* 256gb SSD
---
* NVIDIA GeForce MX150 with 2 GB of dedicated GDDR5 VRAM
---
I remember when these kind of quests were in their infancy, right about when I quit the game in cata. I mean it's cool to drop a bomb and see a thousand little 1hp mobs die. But that was a mindless daily. It's really sad to see that's what the whole game has turned into.
---
That makes sense, it could be because he is super geared when watching his videos but even on Raid Bosses, Skarn wasn't taking an extreme amount of damage that didn't seem hard to heal, but definitely at the beginning I'll probably have a shield until I get a lot of the raid gear BIS. 
---
The thing with the threat portion of it, is I should be able to hold threat fairly easy in the spec, again, this is just from the videos I've watched, if it doesn't work due to me being bad or having wrong gear I would probably just switch.
---
Depends on the guild/raid group really. If you join a raiding guild that is old school and uses dkp or something  and raids 4 nights a week, the more you play to faster (rng willing) you will grab gear.
---
Or maybe you meat some people that do sort of a weekly consistent pug raid and they do all of MC and ony in 3-4 hours one night a week and just have you roll need if its an upgrade.
---
Or you join a big guild that has 12 rogues do you get on the B/alt raid and they aren’t full clears yet so your total possible gear is less every week.
---
Point is there will most likely be options that weren’t always around in 2005, so you may find one way works with your schedule better, or you prefer the social and teamwork feeling a guild raid provides even if you have more competition.
---
In original vanilla, I was in a big semi casual guild.  We had 15-20 good or better players then the rest just need to be told exactly what to do.  I raided AQ with a top guild on the server at one point.  Gear came fast but it was all business.  Later on in lich king, I used the elitist jerks forums to coordinate pug raids for the arena and icecrown.
---
I liked each for different reasons, I think the discord/forum pug group is the way to go if you don’t want to join a big guild.  At the time at least, the people going out of their way to do this were capable players.
---
This is pretty close to my setup
---
RAF exp stacking was changed recently and the system itself is horribly outdated. Seems about time for it to get overhauled imo, so not very suspect to me at all.
---
If you want people to message you asking for groups, those messages will probably be for 5-mans or maybe a last raid spot, and usually that means a healer class.
---
Druids are probably the best in terms of solo play. They can do a lot, they don't need to be full resto, and even if you are full resto you can still solo, farm, and even aoe farm some stuff. They're very self reliant.
---
They aren't always the first choice for 5-mans as they don't have a true res, so people tend to ask them last. However, Druids on most servers are the most underplayed class. Its not uncommon for a raid guild to be filling Druid spots last because there just aren't a lot of them.
---
Anyway, all healers can solo fine. Even at 60 in Holy spec, its not that bad. Priests and Druids have it easier imo at 60. If by solo you mean leveling; all healers level in a non-healing spec so don't worry about that. You can heal all 5-man dungeons in a dps spec.
---
Exactly this. I think they can also port people to capitals which is actually a way to make a little coin. I can't remember if this was in Classic or was added later though
---
High-stress position, some people don't want to be the sole person to blame if shit goes wrong.
---
Yeah it didnt look like that back in vanilla!
---
I dunno I played a rogue and warrior all through vanilla and always preferred the rogue for just about everything.
---
God I wish that were me
---
Probably because you're doing weird apostrophes, namely ’ instead of '.
---
Wish I found some friends on there! We need more!
---
I make sure to level out stonetalon, hillsbrad and 1k needles. I head to STV around high lvl 31/low 32, so I'm not having to grind mobs there that long. That keeps the quests relatively yellow, with a few orange quests. After quests start to slowdown, I go up to Arathi to breeze through those quests. After doing those, I head to duskwallow and do those yellow quests. You should be able to ping pong between those 3 zones to hit 40. There will be points where you'll have to grind 25-40, but it's gonna be pretty minimal.
---
If I were to play horde I'd want a re-do and roll shaman again. But my friends and I are going alliance this time around so I'm forced to pick something else.
---
Wouldn't the Robe of Volatile Power from MC just replace the Robe of The Void early on? I remember that drop actually being pretty common in MC. Or would a good idea be to level tailoring to 300, make the BoP robe, then drop tailor for Engi afterwards?
---
Yea, it's pretty hard to find a MT spot if you aren't the guild leader or best friends with one.
---
Casual guilds raid 3-4 hours 2x per week.
---
Hardcore guilds raid 4-5 hours 1x per week. 
---
It can take a while to get full T2 if your guild has lots of rogues which it usually does.
---
Perfect imo
---
No its a butchers block.
---
It takes slightly more brain power to make sure all the mobs are attacking you, more than hitting buttons and watching a health bar go down, or hitting buttons and watching a health bar go up
---
More responsibility like all the other posts said. 
---
I've been thinking about this a lot lately because I played a tank back in Vanilla and I can't decide if I want to play one again. On one hand I love the extra sense of being the hero when things go right but on the other hand it can be crushing when you make a mistake and wipe the raid.
---
You need way more than 3-4 hours to clear MC, BWL, AQ. Most guilds raid 3-4 hours 2x per week.
---
Those are too overpowered and you'll get downvoted to shit. Lemme show you what sort of ability people on this sub want.
---
Paladin ability. Divine Right. Kills paladin to imbue another character with holy energies granting healing overtime as long as the target remains in combat. Target player then recieves all loot from any mob the player has looked at since 2005. Only castable on warriors.
---
I'll be playing warrior this time around because they get all the cool toys. Played shadow priest back in the day.
---
Oh man, one of my all time favorites &lt;3
---
that looks like hell rofl, i would just be constantly hunched forward squinting, it makes no sense at all
---
Wake up. You were dreaming. What's your name?

---
I heard them say we've reached Morrowind - I'm sure they'll let us go! .... quiet: here comes the guaTHIS IS WHERE YOU GET OFF COME WITH ME
---
Something with healing or tanking capabilities would be a good bet. Any class can fill the damage dealer role, but only X classes can fill the tank or healer roles.
---
Pls spoonfeed me.
---
Yes but you either have to turn on a setting to see old quests (not sure if there was one) or maybe do an addon or worst case know where they are. Because they wont have a quest above them anymore but its still acceptable.
---
How is it a reasonable reply? Adding ONE of these servers would not water down the distributed population. The only other argument I’ve seen from you guys against it is “why don’t you just all gather on a pvp server since it’s just a server tag?” Okay why not just tag a pvp server as RP-PVP if it’s just a tag?
---
I don't know, I always tanked. You get an easy spot in groups and in Raids. The whole group is trying to get you geared up so they can progress. It's such a priviliged position.
---
classic is a hugely social game. Leveling up to 60 on a private server netted me a large friends list of guildies and other random players I did dungeons with. I added someone from a random stockades run and ended up doing LBRS with them way down the line. When you and someone else are waiting on a particular mob spawn, be sure to invite them to your group so you don't have to fight over the tag. If you are in a group of 3 and you see a group of 2 waiting for the same mob to spawn, ask them to merge so you all get credit.
---
 Also, buff everyone that you see. I make a mental note of who buffs me in the world and add them to my good boy list.
---
What do you use the laptop for?
---
What class are you? I remember grinding from 30-33 on yeti's and ogres in alterac, made a good amount of money from all the mithril and iron deposits.
---
You can go to STV for the nessingwary quests, but I guess if on a PvP server that could prove difficult.
---
Lol 5 rogues. I haven’t read this much bullshit in a long time. Well done.
---
I think it’s a great idea but many of the recruitment ideas are already being done in the LFG discord ( https://discord.gg/HNT7UPq )
---
Not sure on miss-able quests, but there are several quest rewards you may initially be inclined to vendor but should absolutely be kept - i.e. trinkets with unique on-use effects.
---
I feel like its more MT has been the GM.
---
Rogue was 1 dodge away from death after the ankh.
---
This game will run on a potato, whatever you buy is gonna be fine.
---
It’s basically impossible. Most premades bring 1 or 0 rogues and the one they do bring has to be a damn good rogue.
---
You live in a red light disctrict?
---
Totally man. I've played through the WC3 campaigns twice in the last year (I LOVE them just so much). It'd send the hype through the roof if it went Reforged --&gt; Classic WoW.
---

---
I’m dead.
---
Weren't those scrolls of resurrection ?
---
Have you considered getting a second screen? It seems like you can afford it. I got a second screen like a year ago, i could never go back to a single screen setup now.
---
Its easier to make friends in classic then it is in retail wow. In classic you need other people on your server and you'll end up remembering their names. In retail people just appear and disappear and there's a whole queue system in place that removes the social aspect of the game.
---
Forr Da Hordeee!
---
No more sit to proc in classic, thats a pserver thing. This means no Eye of the Storm free casts from hunter/warlock pets. Tauren inches out orc imo for the free warstomp cast but its still basically a toss up.
---
Now this is more my speed. Everybody else flexing with their pro setups. I like this one.
---
FOR THE HORDE!
---
I would go tailoring and mining for phase 1 and probably phase 2. Sell your mining goods while everyone is still leveling their professions and demand is high. 
---
Once phase 2-3-ish comes out and battlegrounds are actually in the game (and the honor grinds are ramping up) then I would drop mining and level your engineering; of course, farm necessary resources before dropping mining unless you plan on buying with gold.
---
Might play a priest this time around. Won't have as much time to raid as I did when I was younger. Will be easier to get into raids as one as well.
---
Orc def better for Pve/Pvp. My thoughts behind WotF is that it can be good in 1v1 scenarios but even then youre going to have so many DoTs on you against sPriests/Locks that unless you get the opening cheap shot -&gt; stun rotation whether it be kidney or gouge/blind and reset then you really dont have much of a chance. So much of rogue PVP is either getting the opener in 1v1 situations or as a stun support in group situations that WotF doesnt make a huge difference, because if youre having to use it, its likely too late. The only time I found it really useful is against psychic scream in a group scenario. Other than that unfortunately it has always been something that seems better in theory than in practice, mainly because of my prior point that rogues are not really the best 1v1 class in vanilla.
---
so you're saying theres a chance..
---
I only see 2, maybe 3 mages! Sad times when you consider missing out on those sweet ignite ticks!
---
It felt more like Three's Company than GoT to be honest. This show started so damn good too. I doubt I'll ever see a better season of television than GoT Season 4.
---
That was in a different patch against clueless players. There’s a reason why no rogue has attempted it on a 1.12 private server. Because he would get blown to pieces.
---
I'm so tired
---
WSG:  hunt flag carriers, guard your flag,  annoy everyone 
---
AV: stealth up towers, steal flags through walls, sneak by the battle to capture points away from most people, or retake your own points.
---
AB:  kill everything, guard and take flags.  Very easy to sap a solo defender to take a point, and then a good chance of killing them before back up arrives.  
---
I dunno maybe they were the worst but I never knew the difference?  I always had fun in BG’s.
---
Where is the dog?
---
They really fucked Naxx up in Wrath, it's easily the most undertuned raid in the game's history.
---
Dude I’m not gonna no life vanilla but getting T1 is absolutely a goal of mine
---
https://youtu.be/XTHFx95FMxA
---
Eh.  It needs people with tank gear, not necessarily threat monster tanks.  The fury warriors occasionally have to earn their keep.
---
Banish is always better, thats no dmg, no pressure on the healers. Fury wars off tanking doesnt necessarily mean they are in def stance and wearing a shield.
---
Let’s not forget that pointing out your own achievements or lack there of is just bad form.
---
Yeah definitely, I would like to get an ultrawide and mount this one above it eventually. Just have some other financial priorities right now! Hoping I can get it before launch though.
---
Thanks dood
---
WotF isn't a huge deal because you have the PvP trinket. You know, because it absolutely never happens in battlegrounds where you will deal with a warlock and then have to fight a shadow priest a few moments later. Stuff like that absolutely never happens, ever, so having both of them is useless.
---
There is a lot of bad info in this thread that I think boils down to pServer wisdom that will not translate to Classic. Specifically, 95% of the people here are min/maxers who view anything other than the most optimal thing to be "shit" or "useless".
---
Yes, Orc stun resist is better than WotF. This does not mean WotF is useless. I have to assume anyone claiming as such never played UD in vanilla. Having two cc breakers is absolutely killer against certain clothies.
---
Regret is a bit harsh, but it’s a nasty reality check when you realize that vanilla rogue is the most overrated thing in the history of gaming.
---
Being ganked by high level hordes is one of the reasons I'm going rogue. Can't wait to return the favorS
---
People arent here for discussion.. they are here to get informed about a game they love. If they want to discuss they register at official forms. People satisfy their needs with these kinds memes. Don’t take it too serious, its a game for fun..
---
People like this are why rogues get so much hate. typing /rofl as you run away with sprint from a shaman like you outplayed him lol..
---
How's the fasting going? =)
---
&gt;This has been my feeling about the show since around season 3
---
Man, Season 4 was my all time favorite though. You have:- The Purple Wedding
---
\- The Mountain vs The Red Viper
---
\- Battle at Castle Black
---
\- Tyrion's Rial
---
\- The sacking of Astapor
---
\- The sacking of Yunkai
---
And the characters all make sense!
---
Nowadays nothing makes a damn lick of sense.
---
Well strat and scholo isn't that bad, and the rep you get is a fair bit so it isn't that expensive to get into naxx
---
Okay, definitely at least 3 mages. The Gnome sitting down is wearing the Boreal Mantle which is extra sad because that means he's frost spec in AQ =[
---
Bloodvine at ZG is usually pretty important as well so that’s why people typically hold on the Tailoring until at least then.
---
I thought it was possible to form a raid and do anything with 40. You just wouldn't get quest credit.
---
WoTF is not that good because there’s very few alliance Warlocks. 
---
Resisting a stun or charge is huge and can flip the fight in your favor.

morty would go human paladin to help people, be a mighty warrior of light. ping full rolelay rick would ridicule everything an create a half naked ne warrior called elfknockers. rick would just trashtalk and toxically flame everyone, dancing in goldshire for pervy gnomes and in the end shatter mortys rp world because morty would eventually would do something totally evil without intending to do so. something like enabling arthas to cleanse stratholme kinda heavy. and rick would show him what he did, laugh, burp, say fuck this, uninstall wow and plays some porn vr game instead
---
There aren't any outright missable quests, as in quests that you'll never be able to get once you hit a certain level, they'll just be harder to see/keep track of since they lose visibility (easily fixed by addons.) and given less rep/xp for completion.
---
There are neutral factions quests (Booty Bay, Everlook, Ratchet) that can become locked out if you get Bloodsail Buccaneer rep before you do them (making you hostile to the goblin quest givers) but even that isn't actually a full lock out, since you can grind a few thousand pirate mobs to get yourself back to good standing.
---
Now, fun items...there are some (Dartol's Rod of Transformation) that you will lose if you complete the last part of their quest chain...so you just want to make sure you stop short of that, so you can turn into a furblog whenever you want (alliance only in this case.)
---

Are ret pallies rogues in retail now?

And you love it

Rogue and druid here.

I'll willing to lay off the night elves if you lay off the tauren.

Gnomes can be used to make shoes though.

first delete dota then explore the world 😊
---
Most of the best PvPers I know never got R14. It's just a grind. You know that, yet... well, you know what you're doing at this point. I'll leave you to it.
---
Well, it's better than slapping a WoW logo on everything in the room.
---
Naxx will be out by the time you hit 60 with your rogue.
---
It was always VC back in '04-'05 on shattered hand (us). So that's what I'll stick with.
---
nah. pretty average trailer quality for back then honestly. and lots of the exact same shots can be seen in official wow e3 videos if you search youtube. blizzard definitely recorded them in the first place, whether a fan stitched them together into this particular trailer or not.
---
[Boom](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9ihwsx/the_classic_wow_exercise_program/)
---
I gotchu fam
---
Do we know if there's going to be a PTR?
---
You can quite easily have both.
---
I personally will go for something like [this](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/Aw_EwAXw8cMc9AA) for the purposes of levelling my rogue.
---
You can do this with a 500$ tv, a hdmi cable and a wireless keyboard/mouse. I assume you have computer already?
---
There ARE missable quests, but they're not the type you're thinking of.  
---
There are "bread crumb" quests which close if you pick up the quest they lead to first. These are worthless.  
---
Then there are Road A and Road B quests where the quest gives you an option to do one quest or the other but both of them will lead to the next chain in the series and effectively close the option you didn't take. These are so rare that it won't even be something you notice happening, except for the one in Darkshore because that one is very obvious.  
---
You don't necessarily LOSE anything though so don't worry.  
---
The only thing you can lose are the quest items themselves, which sometimes have a use. The most famous example is Dartol's Rod of Transformation, which allows you to be a furbolg on the Alliance. If you quit the quest or complete it, you lose the item and thus the ability to transform.
---
His original post did not say that. I just am too lazy to edit my post. I agree, he seldom goes JUST over 10 minutes. Normally when he goes over 10 minutes, it's well past 10 minutes often times 15 or more.
---
Dwarf has always seemed BiS for alliance to me, being able to restealth in fights is HUGE. and bleeds/poisons are usually what stop you from being able to restealth (hopefully no druids are around with FF.) Just get ready to go daggers in PVE cuz any Semi hardcore + guild is going to prio swords to human rogue/warrior over dwarf/gnome/Nelf rogues. (daggers better for PVP anyway IMO, Perds blade OP.)
---
Interesting if true. We've definitely come a long way for in-game engine trailers.
---
I'm fairly certain the equator of our planet doesn't move depending on where you live.
---
I don't think there's anything serious. If I recall correctly, there are some lead-in quests for longer chains that can be missed if you just go straight to the start of the quest chain proper. Can't think of any real examples off the top of my head, but the formula is something like "\[Person A\] in \[Zone B\] tells you about a \[Person X\] in \[Zone Y\], who has a quest for you." But if you already have (or have completed) the quest from Person X, then Person A won't give you the quest.
---
The only thing you're really missing in the long term is the quest text, because I don't think any of these had any item rewards at all.
---
I don't have any major tips outside of: don't hesitate to go back to zones you have already been to. Example: Ashenvale has lower level quests, in the ~20 range, but there are many more quests that become available at 25-28+, and make for a nice level or two.
---
My rotation for the level range you described is typically any late quests in southern barrens I haven't yet completed 
---
-&gt; 1K needles, 
---
-&gt; back to Ashenvale (as noted above) 
---
-&gt; "Charred Vale" Stonetalon Mountains quests 
---
-&gt; typically a bounce-back to 1k needles or Hillsbrad to tie up loose ends before arriving at 30
---
At 30, quite a few options open up, my favorite of which is the shimmering flats at the bottom of 1k needles, arathi &amp; early STV are other solid options. I tend to delay STV as long as I can for both PvP reasons &amp; with how dense the mobs are. Somewhere in the early 30s I stop by Desolace--which is one of my least fav zones, but imo is necessary if you don't want to be forced to grind.
---
Finally, it's Dustwallow Marsh -&gt; Late STV/Booty Bay quests (late 30s early 40s), then into Tanaris &amp; subsequently Feralas which is where it typically gets to be pretty smooth sailing again for me.
---
Of all the conspiracy theories, this has the most traction. It makes sense and being that it’s June 10th, we may be in for a surprise when it comes to the release date.
---
My first computer that I played vanilla on had 512mb of ram, a 60GB hard drive, and a GeForce 2 series, later upgraded to a GeForce FX 5 series. I was able to play the game just fine.
---
Having 16-32x as much RAM, 4 times as much disk space (and SSD, no less), and at least 30x the graphics bandwidth will be able to run classic just fine.
---
Anyone else read this in Homer Simpsons voice?
---
The problem is dwarfs are on alliance.
---
Horde priests: dispel and heal your teammates 
---
Shamans: Purge and burst and drop wind fury and backing up 
---
priests as the secondary healer
---
Paladins: dispel and heal your teammates
---
Alliance priests: Dispel enemies and mana burn and heal teammates
---
Druids: You are flag carrier in wsg and stables/farm boy in AB. If you at any point come out of bear form you get stunlocked by a rogue and die.
---
Shimmering flats grinding is excellent if no one is camping the birds. Loads of vendor crap that you can offload at the raceway.
---
Lol dat square screen! Man, brings me back.
---
Ah, thank you. I forgot about the health regen aspect of it.
---
Imp Sap so OP. I like this Drop\_  guy, he knows what he is talking about.
---
Very popular Twitch streamers tend to have a lot of their viewers / fans follow them in online multiplayer games. The concern is these streamers will consistently garner huge death balls of players around them which will throw off wpvp on that server. Idk if this will actually happen enough to really matter in the long run but I guess that remains to be seen.
---
Yeah meld is stationary only usable out of combat but the cloaking lets you invis into another invis where they cannot see where you meld.  But yes they can aoe or run to you if they see you.
---
Anything is viable in PvP but ret is simply not viable in PvE. Perhaps you can find a casual guild that is gonna take you, but holy is so much better.
---
Im hopeful the curse/twitch client will work for classic

The post asks: Engineering is great for PvP but is it essential?
---
Your answer has been that engineering is not only essential for pvp but you're stupid for playing without it.
---
And yet you can have fun and even hit high ranks without engineering. If you can achieve what you want without engineering, then it isn't essential. So why do you have a shitty attitude about it?
---
Yeah, basically don't want the vanilla experience.
---
It didn't start at 15, it was lowered to 15 in patch 1.3, then lowered again to 10 in patch 1.10. 
---
 [https://wow.gamepedia.com/Upper\_Blackrock\_Spire\_(original)](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Upper_Blackrock_Spire_(original))
---
15 seems like alot more in the closer quarters
---
It’s about the date. It’s clearly for classic, but the date is what makes it interesting....June 10th is really soon, so one pay cycle (1 month) will put us in July.
---
You most definitely do not. 3 hours for MC + BWL + Ony, 4 hours once AQ is out. Drop Ony from the raid schedule once AQ is out.
---
In reality, it will turn into two raid nights during progression (one night for AQ40 progression, one "optional" night for MC/BWL clear). But progression won't last long in classic.
---
Is that some sort of foot warmer?
---
Or perhaps timelines change which is a regular occurrence in game development?
---
LOL that's the first thing I thought too.
---
Swords will (atleast should) be prio'd to humans because of the racial +5 swords skill, its a huge impact. With that said dagger rogues can do pretty great DPS in PVE and some great burst in PVP as well.
---
Both are great options and I'm sure you won't be disappointed regardless of which one you pick, based on what you've stated.
---
For PVP, Paladin is the clear choice if you're pocketing a warrior but that doesn't appear to be your focus.
---
Priest has the benefit of being a bit more versatile when you're not playing with your friend, and has an easier time leveling.
---
To me, this seems to be a question of whether you want to have better PVP synergy or an easier time whilst leveling and in your solo hours.
---
I was expecting miracles! :D
---
Hi, /u/dr_doombot666
---
I used to play games in the living room just like this. MMOs were always pretty tough, especially older ones that didnt have the option to make the text huge.
---
Accidentally thought of &gt;!Blasted Lands!&lt; while mentally imagining the zone with Kargath, and then already had it crossed off when I got to the actual location, and thought they were both done as a result... Whoops.
---
Yes, but with an endless mana bar unless you're healing and combo points disguised as Holy Power. Not so detailed as rogues, with like 6 stages per CP, but like, x skill needs 3 to use.
---
Remove the Cataclysm poster this instant!
---
Still more pro than mine
---
No idea, but I could probably sell its contents on the ah. But I decided to go for mage. Easy farming plus portals.
---
They touched on classic briefly in their earnings. Most of their focus seemed to be on Mobile. I think NighBlade was talking about next quarter.
---
Oh right on. Thanks!
---
Molten Core is brain-dead easy, so you don't have to worry about no lifing to get it.
---
I don't think you will struggle to find groups for non-raid content, but you will likely struggle heavily for raiding. Ret paladins don't even bring the utility that other non-optimal hybrids can, they're a poorly spent raid spot by any metric you look at. 
---
Due to people now having a better understanding of the meta of classic WoW I think it's likely that there could be a rise in elitist mentalities as well. It could be even harder for Rets than it was in 2005.
---
Paladin for PvP and Priest for PvP, but realistically you can do either successfully.
---
Reason being blessing of freedom is amazing for warriors in pvp.
---
When leveling you won't level in your healing specs, so you'll be competing for gear with your ret paladin.
---
Being a MT for my guild was the best thing ever and probably the most fun of anyone else in the raiding group. 
---
However, god was that a time sink....I had to do about x5 the work as everyone else. This time around I do not have the time and will be rolling as a healer.
---
I think an example is the cooking skill quest.  If you are at 225 cooking skill then a cooking trainer will give you a quest to go to gadgetzan for the expert cooking quest; however, if you just go straight to gadgetzan and start the cooking quest then you'd miss the minor xp from the bread crumb.

Yepp, it was DM on shattered hand. Can confirm.

Did u play horde or alliance?

I was alliance.

A bunch of old  shattered hand players are returning for classic :d
---
Oh ya yum.
---
I'm only 27 but yeah...a fiance and a baby in the works plus a very intensive and time consuming job. I have like 90% less time but still going UD warlock
---
July 16 is the best guess so far, see https://www.wowclassiccountdown.com/ and I heard the Q1 financial report mentioned a release in Q3.
---
Skarm specifically mentions that lower gear levels and those in progression on newer raids should be very careful using the spec.
---
Personally I'd be rather annoyed having to deal with Furytanks thinking they can justify the spec in the pre-raid bis farming era. 
---
It's mostly designed as a means by which to push the upper limits of speed clears.
---
I love how deep that desk is, where is it from?
---
fan of the alliance i see?
---
Depends on the keystone level i guess, but perhaps its a bit of a copout to say you can die to an infinitely scaling difficulty mechanic. Certainly there are dungeons that are unfailable, you just dont have to do them
---
I really hope all these hype still I have the horrible feeling people just saying it to say it and will drop off the face of the earth. As someone who plays vanilla private servers a lot i know I’m hungry for this game but not sure if people are too spoiled with current WoW
---
The modification I've seen that seem almost mandatory is to move class set items to either separate SK queues, or just LC out certain things like set items, resist gear, and recipes. I've heard some people say that it works out for lesser items since you'll just have people nearer the bottom taking lesser items since they effectively pay less for them since they don't fall as far down the list, but it would depend on the kind of people in your guild whether that happened or not. It also looks like people have solutions to the attendance issue as well by not moving people who didn't attend.
---
However I think you're right about the progression night problem. Progression is probably the single most important phase for a guild, and SK falls flat on its face in that situation. DKP systems can hand out points for progression attempts, LC can take into account whose showing up on progression and even keep an eye on things like who brought enough mats to potion up every attempt. I've yet to see an SK solution for progression.
---
Love that Tabard. It does the flex emote when clicked on right?
---
OP, what chair is that? I generally hate gaming chairs but that one doesn't look like a giant fucking clown throne.
---
An hour to clear AQ? Are you stupid? And you don’t drop Ony till Naxx/very late AQ. The warriors and rogues need that sword and axe badly.
---
I am a BWL fan
---
I’m fairly sure robes of volatile power was added later on in a different patch :o
---
fuck the haters bro, mad respect for that trackball. you'll be leaning back and so chill whilst grinding.
---
also you can easily up the font size, actionbars and everything else so it's no big deal that it's far away.
---
The one wildcard is that the classic client is NOT the same client we used during vanilla - it is built off the BfA client, which recommends a minimum gtx 960 gpu. 
---
Essentially, no one will know until the beta comes out what the true requirements are, but you can pretty reliably say the BfA requirements are probably a good guideline to go off.  I'd think a 1060 should do just fine - especially because of the big jump in laptop gpu performance with pascal.
---
You are more than welcome to come do mine....

&gt;yet here you are...in a back and forth over the thread

---
The fact that I deign to communicate with you, does not validate you, or make you more important than you are. The fact that you seem to believe so, speaks volumes about your self image. Someone seeks confirmation. Seek elsewhere.
---
Didn’t have any hype up until this post. Damn.
---
You become auto leader, quarterback, marker, lead strategist, etc.  As a rogue you get told to sap X and then if you feint or vanish at some point during a fight you a golden.
---
I know nothing about computers.
---
I want the cheapest laptop that can allow me to experience the game at full capacity.
---
If anyone has any suggestions, please share.
---
As a last resort the community will be ready to declare one PvP realm as RP friendly per region. Not ideal, still hoping Blizz will listen to us!
---
Plus if you're tanking you actually have to watch the game and then you can't be watching your stories on another monitor.
---
this is relevant to my interests.
---
I wanna do EVERY quest possible, even missable "breadcrumb" quests.
---
This isn't Dire Maul. I think you mean enter VC.
---
Tank doesn't get blamed, tank blames the dps for dumping too early or on the wrong target. 
---
If the dps get upset about it laugh at them and tell them to find another group.
---
No Jaedenar?
---
I would also like to know
---
A lot of people have already pointed out that the famous naked rogue videos took place prior to 1.12. Another thing to keep in mind is that this just showed that rogues could perform well *without* gear. It didn’t show that rogues wouldn’t still scale if they *did* get gear.
---
Probably the most well-known naked rogue videos were the world of roguecraft series. In one of the videos, directly after a naked sequence, the idiot rogue character complains that this just shows that rogues don’t scale at all. The warlock says something along the lines of, “okay, in that case, PvP in epics should be just as hard as it was naked.” He then demolishes people with ease as a fully epiced rogue.
---
Basically, evis didn’t scale well, so it hit hard even when naked. Sinister strike, backstab, and white damage all scaled *very* well, and depending on your spec these were pretty much always gonna be more of your damage than evis anyway.
---
Wow

Did blizzard have a rule against Player run gambling?

I hope there's some sketchy gambling going on in the corners of IF for me to squander away my epic mount savings.

25-40 is definitely the area where you see most people give up. There's a ton of travel and you don't have a mount yet. You'll get to zones where you can do the first few quests but they quickly outlevel you and you have to go to a different zone to do a few quests then go back to the previous zone where you now are closer, etc. It's a grind.
---
After finishing the 10-20 zone I generally bounce between Stonetalon, Hillbrad, Ashenvale doing yellow or green quests (can also do the higher level quests in Barrens or Silverpine depending on which one you didn't do for your 10-20). Doing those 3 zones should get you to the high 20's or maybe 30 depending on how much grinding you're doing and you can head to 1k needles for a bit. 
---
I stick around here as long as I can before going to STV since I play on PvP servers and STV can be rough sometimes. A lot of times I head to STV before doing Shimmering Flats quests as they are a little higher level. After doing all you can bouncing between 1k needles and STV you should be able to coast through Arathi easily and do Duskwallow and lower level Desolace to get you to 40. Once you hit 40 things feel like they open up a lot more as travel time gets cut significantly.
---
I don't know what your issue with the armour change is. Classic will be 1.12 which is after 1.2, so bears will have 360% extra armour.

---
It’s an idea but not sure how successful it would be. An arena with no LOS and where everyone has full naxx gear probably isn’t as glamorous as you think. You definitely need to have 1 per class limit.
---
Thanks for the thorough right up I guess I need to go to hillsbrad and do more quest I’ve only done 2 there.
---
I think you have an attitude or personality problem then. You'll be scraping by forever continuing like this, my dude.

Thrall and Tyrande get it on because Malfurion has an ED problem.

It does nothing, however it's unique and only obtainable during the scourge invasion that leads to the opening of Naxxramas.

Going to the movies is a fun experience. A movie starting 30 minutes late or having a kid cry through it isn't. There were design flaws and technological restrictions in vanilla.
---
I can’t remember if Blizzard shut it down but I do remember it being a thing. I’m sure they did because I don’t remember it being around in TBC.
---
Ya
---
Yes any healer can
---
Good druids who are PVP specced should beat rogues. You can precast abolish poison to counter blind and keep FF up and kite. It does require PVP gear and the right spec on the druids part but if theyre on it theres almost nothing you can do as a rogue if you dont get the opener.
---
No potions or flasks. Drinks and food allowed if you have time to disengage and hide. Engineering allowed as well.
---
Easily!!!
---
That last line, will be so true this time around lmao. I didn't really think twice about a rogue in my groups the first time around in vanilla. But now, I'm going to be working a fury set the second I start getting close 60. I'm not going to be running dungeons with rogues lol.
---
Hillsbrad is a great questing zone, the problem is that the Alliance seems to get sent there closer to level 30 whereas horde can start questing there at around 20, so if you're on a pvp server you can be a bit outmatched.
---
Nah man. You love it.

Everyone says there is a high skill cap for rogue. 
---
When/where??
---
PVE nope 
---
BGs are tough and you can only single out. 
---
Duels maybe but they already know your there. 
---
Ganking? But you always have the upper hand. 
---
Am I missing something? 
---
There are very few abilities, compared to other classes. Once you have the rotations down it's simply rinse repeat. 
---
Druids have a high skill cap imo, which has a rogue built into it. 
---
I honestly can't think of a lower skill cap class.
---
Let the down votes proceed!
---
Yes, and we just went through countless expansions to realize that in fact they weren't design flaws.
---
Didn't they say something along the lines of "despite some developments, our plans to release in 2019 have not changed"?
---
I took that to mean "Okay, so it's not gonna be out by summer like we originally planned but it'll definitely be sometime in 2019"
---
\#1 reason why I play tank and my wife plays healer.  
---
Start a group with those roles already filled and you can have pretty much your choice of DPS.  Also, having tank and heals sitting in the same room as each other makes communication and situational awareness so much easier.
---
God I hope I land on a server that greeds for greed and only needs when legit.
---
Tell us about the foot warmer!
---
I have both of those backgrounds! Even though I'm an alliance player through and through lol.  I can't find a good animated Alliance backgrounds.
---
This speaks to me on a spiritual level. #1BindingCrew
---
Except it turned out to be for naught, as it turns out that people typically don't intentionally spread disease or seek out mass infection zones out of curiosity. All due to the fact that since it was a video game with no real consequences, it skewed the data into the unusable.
---
I got 38/40 because I couldn't spell azshara or tirisfal glades right
---
Nope. Out of the 8 releases (base game included) 3 of them have been in Aug-Sep, the other 5 in the winter (Nov-Jan). I doubt we'll have to wait until September, but I feel like August probably makes most sense. 
---
I do hope for the ol' 16th of July, but I feel like every day without an announcement that likelihood grows weaker as they should have at least a couple of months between announcement and release both for beta testing (Let's be real, there will be a public beta, even if it's just a stress test weekend. It makes no sense at all to not make sure anything gamebreaking happens at release which bots and the relatively few alpha testers can't simulate) and to give their fans some time to plan their vacations.
---
With mana tide totem, some stacks of water and a handful of mana pots for emergencies you’ll be completely fine healing any 5 man as a resto shaman. Chain heal makes many situations very easy to heal as a shaman that can be a bit stressful on other classes.
---
I've got 4 weeks burning a hole in my pocket, and I just want to know for certain... It's going to suck if they pull an Apex, and just release it out of nowhere.
---
I noticed it a lot with shamans. 
---
"I need that for my enhancement set"
---
"I need that for my tanking set"
---
"I need that for my elemental set"
---
"I need that for my healing set"
---
Thank god people keep strict to "main spec only" or shamans would roll on every piece of gear that ever drops in raids
---
Glad I'm not the only one who dislikss alliance, but loves dwarfs.
---
Okay... not sure what that has to do with tips lying about having insider information, but sure thing mate?
---
First of all, if that warrior had continued attacking you and not attempted to run away you would have died. You almost died to someone 5 levels below you with your raid gear on man. You probably should have left that out of the video.
---
Secondly you didn't troll anyone. Your plays were not witty or skillful, they were bare and poorly chosen. Why would you walk right up to a Stoneclaw totem? If at any point that shaman had used Earthbind on you, you would have been dead. If that hunter hadn't have shown up you would have been dead. You should def keep practicing.
---
You mean cabals of 5-10 guildies face-rolling the one or two challengers stupid enough to be inside the arena so that their lvl 29 twink hiding in the back can loot the chest?
---
Hundred percent this rogue needs more time /played.
---
Leveling sub in vanilla can be fun but it definetly isnt ideal if you want to level fast. Daggers have such a lower top end damage when fighting mobs front facing and opening on every mob from stealth can be slow paced. I highly recommend leveling with a sword/dagger combo to level both weps while leveling and then you can also switch your MH/OH if you want to backstab/ambush. But overall Sub is still fun for vanilla leveling, jsut definetly not the fastest or near the fastest way to level.
---
Personally I always let rogue get opener, and always let warrior get charge. The whole jumping around madly spamming rank 1 aoe seems really dumb to me.
---
Yeah, they're not selling classic, there's no entry fee besides the subsciption. They don't want people avoiding the only way they're going to make money off of this.

Ya, I think tanking and the pressure of it, just isn't appealing to most players. I for one don't mind it and one of the most appealing things about classic to me as someone who's always liked warrior, is the ability to tank without being full prot.
---
I plan on running fury with some points in prot to be a viable tank when I need to be. Was the classic 31/5/15 most the way through classic and loved being able to tank when needed.
---
I forget the mechanic, but isn’t that where you’d jump on the wheel while the tank pulls the Pat to avoid a wipe?
---
I need to get one of those trackball mouses!  I'll often times move my HDMI to my TV, infront of my dope bean bag chair, and laze out on MMOs and other games but using the mouse on a beanbag is rather difficult.  Works for OSRS but that's about it.
---
Correct, I'll be rocking PVE again for classic
---
Meh, I figure a shaman deserves it
---
**mail item with only agility drops**
---
"I need that for crit chance" - every shaman healer that has ever grouped with my hunter
---
&gt;Vanilla tanking is mostly tank n spank with simple spammable rotations
---
Rotation-wise maybe, but not mental load.  Tanks were expected to mark and mange party roles at a higher level than I've seen since Cata.  Also, with CC being more predominant in standard pulls, you're spending a lot more on positioning so that DPS can do their job without risking CC break.
---
It's unlikely this will function in Classic, Blizzard's intention is not to allow some sort of LFG tool to be developed by disabling inter-addon communication in some form.
---
I remember seeing this on the official site, it may very well be made by Blizzard.
---
Lmao bro there’s no way 😂
---
Man I get nostalgia seeing stuff like this, younger me thinks this is awesome.  My body hurts just from imagining all the contorting I'd have to do to stay comfy here nowadays
---
Bingo and I'm not a dwarf so I can see over it
---
This is exactly the setup I had... when I was 12, playing D2. It's a great setup for a child with no direction in life.
---
Of the many of these kinds of websites that offered this functionality that have come before you, I know of none that have been successful in the long term or are still around to this day.
---
The Not Gettin Laid and Play
---
Don't worry, my hunter friend a few years back rolled need on a HoJ over a rogue and warrior.  We still laugh about it to this day.
---
That was always a stupid rule. If someone’s an engineer and you’re an alchemist, why can they use their profession but you can’t use yours.
---
I followed that rule back in the day but this time I don’t think I will
---
Oh your one of THOSE people. Lmfao. Have a great rest of your day, and get to bed early. You've got work tomorrow comrade. 😂
---
I mean to level in vanilla is to methodically do pretty much ALL the quests in ALL the zones. you don't really have much choice. like "either or", thats not how it works, you do everything. 
---
Just dont go ahead of your level doing some higher level quests (you'll need them later when you get higher level), and move between zones a lot, always doing your level quests. 
---
refuse the temptation to do higher level quests, cos you are already in the zone. nono, do your level quests then go to some other zone, and come back to this zone later at the level of this quests.
---
If you ran out of quests, you probably missed out some location. or did red quests ahead of time and now you have no quests. never do it like that. the most common mistake that ppl do.
---
(and its just that around level 30 its all finally catching up to you, and other ppl that got probelm at 30).
---
As for zones in particular, at this level ppl tend to forget shimmering flats in thousands needles, quite a non obvious area. rather than that as i said you move between all the available zones on this level, do beggining quests in nessing in stv, do some beginner quest in arathi, do quests in hillsbrad and so on.
---
Darkshore, Dustwallow, and Duskwood kind of all tripped me up. I kept wanting to put Duskfall like Westfall. To be fair I’m a horde main and never do these zones, butttttttt.....
---
Same. But played UD Mage in vanilla, so have to go with UD now as well &lt;3
---
you living the good life
---
lol.
---
Who's more foolish? the fool or the one who constantly says he is better than the fool yet continues to engage with him...
---
Enjoy the ghost town once classic is out
---
All you need now is a conveyer that runs in food and water regularly and a bucket. Lock the doors and live forever in classic azeroth
---
Somewhat glad that there is no hidden dog head somewhere before the explosion
---
G
---
Cataclysm it is, in vanilla it’s separate. I was also shocked when I was on a private server leveling recently that Swamp of Sorrows isn’t a 55+ zone and I had quests for level 35 there.
---
&gt;post nerf Cata
---
Pre-nerf Cata heroics was my favorite dungeon run experience hands down.  Some people raged out, but most people focused in so much that it was great.  You could tank a group and people would actually follow marks and excercise discipline on pulls because they knew that if they didn't there'd be consequences.
---
I love the micro-management of marking out and executing pulls to effectively use CC and LOS.  What made me fatigue was that as soon as 5-mans got easy, people got sloppy and that hard work just didn't pay off anymore.  When people stopped worrying about strategy I rolled up a mage and started facerolling like everyone else, because why not?
---
My squad rolls deep. Have fun killing all of us when we split into different directions while running.
---
I got 100% but man dun morogh and azshara got me i could not spell them right I spent atleast 3 minutes on those trying different variations till i got it. i finished with 3:34 on the clock. Probably helps that i play on the private server a lot
---
Okay, that make sense, axe and board here i come. 
---
On this does anyone have any ideas for race? I was thinking Troll, but Tauren may be better due to the health buff?
---
What do you use the vertical monitor for? One of mine can do that but I never found a use for it. Maybe a leveling guide?
---
Shamans are sick healers why you even asking?
---
And if they are here for information, why post memes?
---
aside from bedsores and strain on your shoulders, i approve
---
They just need to make death possible .. like the kill 100 quest at the beginning of WoD you can literally go afk... They should be able to swarm khadgar etc and you lose and have to restart
---
UI scale
---
Wut? WoW is chill dude. I'm not talking about an FPS, just leveling and DPS'n a few raid bosses
---
Hotkeys (for the important stuff)
---
Very casual, yes
---
Hmm I got one that was called Tabard of the Protector that would do a holy Nova type of animation and Flex.
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Tabard_of_the_Protector
---
I was so disappointed when I repeated it and got no xp haha
---
Amen
---
Until you accidentally start it a few seconds after someone else
---
There is nothing better than being all cozy in bed, playing WoW, on a cold winter/christmas day.
---
&gt;Once the DPS dies if it's not a wipe it will often just turn back to the tank.
---
DPS gets aggro, healer tries to keep them up generating more aggro, DPS dies but now the healer has more aggro than tank had, mob goes for healer.  
---
Now either the tank can taunt the mob somewhere along that chain, or another DPS can try to burn it down, or the healer's getting slagged too.
---
Undead rogues are literally sub-humans
---
The reason I follow the rule is because it creates a playing field stability and reduces gold cost. Since both players *can* use flasks and potions regardless of profession, limiting those resources for both players means that they are kept at the same baseline level, as opposed to feeling pressured to spend money in order to win duels if the other player breaks the terms of engagement. Engineering, in contrast, is a resource that can largely only be used by the Engineer, and as such I view it more as a class skill than an equally available resource. If the Engineer wants to use money, they can (not that Iron Bombs really cost that much), but the non-Engineer at any length is not pressured to spend gold to "keep up" except in the broad sense that they're pressured by the game itself to also be an Engineer.
---
The end result is that the Engineer has an extra resource over the non-Engineer, but it's a resource that conceptually did not facilitate an arms race, just like a Warlock's access to Fear did not provoke a Druid into "buying Fear" (because they *can't* buy it). Alchemy, in contrast, does facilitate an arms race and should not be used simply so that both players remain richer, considering that a duel is a zero-stakes engagement.
---
If you want to fight people with Flask of the Titans on, that's your prerogative, assuming they agree to that condition. But Flasks cost a lot of money. I wouldn't recommend it. Potions are more tolerable, since both players probably already have a fair number of them, but I still elect to not use them simply to keep costs down.
---
Tanking racials are quite minor. The biggest one of note is going human for Alliance.
---
Undead or Tauren is probably the optimal pick for Horde. Tauren for HP, undead for fear breaks (no fear ward on Horde side)
---
Can someone sum up all these "leaks" people are talking about? I saw only that TipsOut was hinting at the number 5 pretty heavily. Anything more?
---
source ?
---
If you play priest you can solo heal all content until raids, even as shadow spec(which is faster for leveling solo)
---
Soon ^(tm)

Here's some more clips from the stream:

---
Of course. Shamans are fantastic dungeon healers. And their totems are extremely valuable. Windfury with 4 melees is OP.
---
My neck hurts looking at the picture - much less looking at the screen in bed
---
In my experience the it's:  
---
Responsibility of the tank:
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; • Hold aggro
---
&gt; • Not be too squishy
---
Responsibility of whoever is most experienced/confident in the dungeon:
---
&gt; • Mark targets
---
&gt; • Know which way to go
---
&gt; • Know the encounters
---
&gt; • Have a strategy for the pull, if needed
---
&gt; • Delegate responsibility (you sheep moon, etc.)
---
&gt; • Come up with a new strat if the first one fails
---
I mean.. They would be idiots to not have ONE RP server. It's a very real classic WoW community.
---
Nobody from my guild seems to have signed up haha
---
On my server a lot of the time people would ask if engineering was okay before starting the duel. It used to be considered "honorable" to ask I guess.
---
So you’re saying it’s just about gold, and you wouldn’t care if I used potions. Perfect :)
---
...but no doggo, so meh
---
Nice trackball. Got elecom huge myself.
---
Only train the necessary skills so you can buy your mount at 40.
---
he held up 3 fingers so 3 days?
---
Wants to buy please
---
You don't even need to be resto, just have some int + healing power gear and you should be able to heal just about every 5 man
---
I agree, he probably set up a server for himself to do this. He didn't lie tho. Not to shatter anyones dreams here, but doesn't porn already imply it's set up?
---
This is important: for a lot of off spec vanilla classes you need to dip into non traditional gear(like cloth in shaman)
---
I’m saving this, printing it, and framing it next to my PC until we get a release date
---
Thank you for this content. All I have is upvotes.
---
The game will be free?
---
I am so triggered that you misspell tips and tip, using the name of a streamer instead, every single time.
---
Make sure to use the 5 second regen rule and cast all your spells at once
---
Lol your parents sound crazy, but I'm going with Tauren Druid too, good choice.
---
3 + 3 + 5 = 11 days from now.  
---
OMG....  
---
^^^/s
---
great one, and no dog head ! or office meme
---
H
---
There were not a ton of these in TBC?
---
That’s relaxing to hear you don’t have to be cutting edge to get into the raids
---
The only class that I despise running 5 mans with is rDruids because they have no Rez. Sham/Priest/Pally should all have no issues.
---
I just kept thinking "GREEN SMELLY SWAMP that maze of an instance with a puzzle" !
---
Basically this https://youtu.be/K5lYXaVkA0U but insert hunters as scots
---
If you super can't decide, which one do you *want* to play.  I'm rolling Gnome Warlock (See you on the battlefield) 'cause I like the fantasy of being a short little guy or gal wielding devastating power!  Secondary bonus is I get escape artist and some Int.
---
Hmm, I think that him holding up the five at the end after a pause seems like a hint. Possibly 5 days.
---
Well would you look at that, I guess you could be right...
---
Tuntematon sotilas (2017), Finnish movie about the continuation war against Soviet.
---
yea man and rn with rainy season where i live its heavenly
---
Hopefully next super bowl we can watch the eagles spank them again
---
I've always liked EPGP as a loot system over something like DKP/Loot Council, it ensures people have to show up (decay), and people who get a lot of loot will naturally fall to lower priority due to the way that it calculates item winners with a ratio.
---
But the guild I'm in currently that will be rolling on Classic is using loot council currently and plans to use loot council in Classic. I honestly couldn't care less, it's about the boss kills with friends than it is about loot. So long as I get a shot at Thunderfury and/or scepter of the shifting sands I don't really care about the other loot, that stuff will come eventually.
---
What a cute ginger kitty!
---
I feel you, I really wanna do a good job, but its infuriating when people say after a wipe " why didnt you just pull these mobs from me", not knowing that it aint just a aoe taunt you have to do.  Everyone should try to tank a bit, and theyd appreciate us more
---
PvP in general sucks after AQ when everyone one-shots everyone else. 
---
Some rules would be nice of course. More than one rogue or mage would be pretty boring. It also kinda makes engineering a necessity so maybe ban the profession or make a tournament specifically for those without it.
---
thats the fucking life
---
Or porn (pally FTW!)
---
nah not much contorting required
---
Taurens were always my favourite, they understood the importance of nature.
---
You can take the Gnomes, but I'll cull the Undead.
---
From my experience Health pots/bandages/whipper roots were fine for self healing, but resistance potions were pretty frowned upon. Engi is normally fine but most the people who were into dueling had engi so i supposed thats why.
---
me and my gf never get laid in this bed ;) we just stare at each other and remain virgins
---
More power to you
---
Lol what a ridiculous comment that was. Dude sounds like a total cuck.
---
It’s gonna be a Slobber Knocker!!!
---
havent had either of these issues for the last 5 years of doing this but i guess well see haha
---
MAAHM BATROOM
---
Seal fate is fun with good gear, but takes quite some time to come online. Hemo and combat on the other hand can both be played with Swords, so human seems like a really good choice. Female human animations are also pretty great.
---
So Toight
---
Haha in Germany there was a new rule, that you Write tip now with 2 pp‘s^^ thought its in english aswell..
---
Never forget
---
yea idk what that was about. childhood trauma?
---
tyty
---
Yay more free promotion for this guy.
---
Staysafe said they will announce something in three days I think
---
If 1v1 was considered Battle Royale
---
lmao need more hotpockets
---
Really helping his credibility with all of this
---
I really hope there isn't sharding in the pvp zones. If stv isn't old school Vietnam it's  going to feel terrible
---
Well I've seen like 4 today so............
---
I like him. MAybe hes just hyping for nothing. But i dont care. It makes me even more excited for the game.
---
Blizzard must really regret inviting this guy to Irvine, he can't help himself.
---
Hey you said judge accordingly :)
---
Can a heal specced healer heal?
---
Yes. All healing classes have the ability to single heal 5 man content.
---
Could you please at least make an attempt at describing what this is instead of merely video clips?
---
I understand that videos are popular but not everyone is into sitting through a video when a simple paragraph would be faster. Feels like marketing otherwise.
---
What makes me feel more hyped about all those clips is not the possible leak of days precisely. I mean, I'm not gonna lie, if anything happens in such short time I'll feel so, so blessed. But what really got me smiling from ear to ear watching this is with how *hyped* he looks about it. This represents so much the warm anxiety that I'm feeling, and that there's good news coming for us all. It looks like it's talking all of him to not just get up the chair and start jumping around.
---
We're going home, guys, and *soon*.
---
I call shenanigans!
---
I was on most of the day and I did not come across even one. Now I’m not saying there weren’t ANY today, but if there were 4, I’d have come across them.
---
Is that robe that big of a deal? I’m going mage as well, and maybe I plan to do that as well. Would be nice to hear myself decently at the start of 60, and once I get more drops move into engineering after that. 
---
Plus the money from bags and some epic selling would be nice.
---
I think the distinction is really essential implies you can’t win without in the majority of situations and disadvantage just means you have a few less tools/utility in your kit to choose from.  If you min/max you go engineering, but that doesn’t mean you are not competitive without it.  
---
Much like the most popular hunter I can remember back in Vanilla on the warsong server was a pvp monster and literally only had one hand in real life.  Pretty big disadvantage, very clearly not essential apparently.
---
It would be ironic if he had to take one for the team and get banned from Blizzard games for breach of NDA XD
---
awesome stuff
---
Possibly a cat bed? Whatever it is, it's stinky.
---
The alliance crest isnt leveled correctly, or the picture seems to imply that it isnt...
---
I'm saying it's fairer to both players to not create an external pressure to spend gold. In my personal case I wouldn't care, because I was a multi-season Gladiator in BC and Wrath. People can use whatever consumables they want and I'd still probably trounce them, especially since I'll be rolling an exceptional 1v1 spec in Classic (look at this nerd and his e-peen brags, amirite?). But for many people who may not farm very quickly, they'd feel it was imbalanced for you to use two-hour flasks just to get an edge in a fight that gives no HKs or really any other reward. World PvP or BGs? Have at it with those; all bets are off when it comes to actually killing the opposing faction.
---
Naw just you
---
The video is only like 30 seconds, so I assumed people would rather just watch it and make their own conclusions. In the video he holds up five fingers and says classic is very close.
---
So how soon stream is start? Or they ended already?
---
"while running", enough said.
---
This my dudes.
---
"This close" **three** fingers in addition to the measurement &gt; "This close" again, **three** fingers in addition to the measurement &gt; Pauses to do some math because it's Tips &gt; Adds in a very obvious "This close" with his hand showing **five** &gt; Another video you linked: "**MAY** have had a great dinner last night" confirming the month as our current month along with his very obvious behavior where he rushed from that statement to "OKAY GUYS NICE STREAM"  
---
**3** + **3** + **5** = Classic Beta is on the day 11 days from the day he said it, May 8th. Which would be on May 19th.  
---
Tips in Kargoz' channel the other day said "All I can say is that the last episode of Game of Thrones might require some multitasking" - Last GoT episode is May 19th, which aligns with what he hinted above.  
---
also /s because I refuse to take Tips seriously.
---
I mean its a 25 second video. A paragraph would have more words than everything he says in the entire video.
---
Got me there lol
---
i've read that when paired with a warrior, ret paladins are really solid -- judgement of light, little heals, blessing of might etc.  would you say a priest is still preferable for leveling purposes?
---
I actually knew which ones were missing but I couldn't remember the damn names...
---
Lmao our bars are setup almost exactly the same. It took like 3 playthroughs as a mage to decide where everything fit. Especially portals/teleport spells.
---
They are. You just need to actually be good.
---
Alliance :D do you also happen to be Swedish? That server was like 90% Swedish
---
Stream is already over, this is a clip from the stream.
---
Out of all people, why would Blizzard choose this guy to give us "hints" for such a big release that Classic is? I've never heard of this guy before untill a couple of days ago. Like who is he? Is he an old famous vanilla veteran or whats up with him?
---
I've played rogue since vanilla on and off but am considering maining a Warrior. I've never played one but after watching a lot of MonkeyNews videos it looks super fun in Pvp with a high skill gap. I am not interested in ranking though. I don't mind the leveling grind at all. Any thoughts on warrior instead of a rogue?
---
GTRacing. Specifically got it because it doesn’t look like a 5 year olds dream chair lmao. Plus it has a really tall back which is good for tall people (I’m 6’6”).
---
I hate those shoulders so much. I refuse to wear them until the other rogues have them.
---
2 hours to clear AQ, 2 hours for BWL and MC. Hence why I said you drop Ony during AQ. This exact setup is extremely common on private servers.
---
I would finally watch an entire episode if he did...
---
They were epic open world pvp battles in vanilla!
---
I am so happy that this was not another meme post. More-so that its got a valid point.
---
We don't really know what they told him, so we have no idea what Blizzard regrets.
---
Most say started from a Spongebob meme. 
---
 I point out that at the very least r/PeopleFuckingDying has been doing it longer than that meme has been around, and I know it's been around longer than that.... but I'm usually insulated and down voted for saying so.
---
Starcraft meets warcraft, terrans vs alliance?
---
That's like asking if a mage can aoe or a Warrior can tank. Resto Shamans are amazing.
---
Because using streamers to promote games is all the hotness these days.
---
But since we don't have any GOOD streamers due to there being no game to stream, they just picked the guy with most viewers.
---
I will submit this proposal to Thrall. I think we have a deal.
---
You really don't think they would have stopped this by now? He's been teasing it for 2 days now.
---
This is the top post right now. This makes me sad :(
---
What have we become?
---
What have I become?
---
So my original post is somehow wrong? Pretty sure everything I've said is still correct. 
---
Or, what, are you trying to tell me that Blizzard, a company based on California, is using "Summer" to refer to summer in the opposite hemisphere as them? Classic in December?
---
If you use a free action potion or a living action potion to beat someone in a duel that's a pretty hollow victory and I probably wouldn't duel you again.
---
Tell me more.
---
This is like standing and staring at the floor to play your game. The TV is so low you are staring at your toes. I call this the "forward head and neck pain". 1/10 comfy for an hour and then after you get up your neck is stiff as fuck and after a few sessions you realize how dumb this is. You'll buy a bracket and put it up on the wall or you'll ditch this setup after a couple weeks. Even with the TV up on my wall I don't game from bed. You need a fucking huge TV to be able to see text and detail in most games.
---
&gt;mouse and keyboard in bed
---
Good luck. I tried it.
---
a man can dream
---
Yeah, I can only think one only two of these in BC, both of which in Hellfire Peninsula. The a third being one that isn't on a set path, the Orgri'la daily quest where you use your own flying mount and had the chance to get knocked off to your death.
---
The Robe is best in slot until Zul Gurub I believe, so it's worth it if you want to raid. You basically never run out of mana with it. You can also make gear for yourself as you level, if you choose to level with Tailoring.
---
Yeah I've been trying to figure out my professions. A similar approach a guildie suggested to me was to level with Mining and Skinning. Sell hide for gold. Drop Skinning, use gold to power level Tailoring, get the Robe and anything else you want, then drop it for Engi, power-level it with your mats.
---
Why not? If people are trying to re-live the classic experience, and they don't intend on progressing the game past the end of vanilla, it would actually make sense for them to launch new base 1.12 (?) patch servers every 6 months or so, for new players, or people who want a fresh start.
---
You have to remember, they're launching a game where they already know where development has a hard stop. Therefore to keep things fresh, they just have to re-launch occasionally for the people who crave that new feeling.
---
Its not for everyone but ive done this for 5+ years. actually got to d4 in league while laying in bed since the mouse works fine on my sheets material. dont have any neck issues from what i know at least but i feel u man lol
---
You play a private server and you still haven’t noticed that 95% of guilds have 2 raid nights? Yeah you’re clueless.
---
I added some references.
---
I bet it's just enough to level up...\~
---
I'm not a Tips Out fanboy by any means. However I think his content (especially Youtube videos) are very informative for classic noobs like me.
---
I get that. The only thing I like to do with gnomes is play football. I'll see you is wsg.
---
Can we believe that though? Did he prove that he's in contact with Blizzard? Because for all I know, he could just be making these hints up to gain attention.  
---
I guess we'll find out in 5 days or whatever...
---
It's called Svive Ixion Tier 3. I tink it's only for sale in Norway/Sweden. Probably just a rebrand of a generic DXRacer model.
---
From vanilla to wrath my preferences changed, then styed the same after that.
---
In vanilla I just leveled and did BGs. I played hunters almost exclusively. I would level a hunter, then reroll it, and start over. Over and over and over again.
---
When horde got paladins in TBC I rolled one. I loved it. I started tanking dungeons. I was really good at it. I went from that to leveling a tank druid. Hopped back and forth between them. Dabbled a little in dungeon healing as well if we already had a tank.
---
In Wrath my friends and I ran heroics. We already had a consistent tank. I went heals. I loved it more than tanking. I was pretty decent at it. Even raided naxx and a little ulduar. I've mained either a holy paladin or resto druid ever since.
---
So come Classic, I plan on rolling a healer. Either paladin or shaman, depends on which faction my friends decide on.
---
Thanks mom :D
---
Good, can't wait for Classic to come out so no one posts shit here anymore as they'll be too busy playing.
---
But hunters get so tanky in later patches so even though their damage falls off, they can live a long time and with the crazy amount of cc, debuffs and utility they have they can usually win out fights.
---
Viper sting essentially puts a timer on all mana classes and if you can’t take down the hunter in time then you lose.
---
No buffs besides self buffs. No consumables besides bandages or food/water. Insane cooldown abilities like retaliation/wrecklessness or lay on hands are pretty lame. Engineering consumables I'd ask before the duel started.
---
Okay that painting is fire
---
Yeah  I already knew what you were talking about,still it's called Tarren mill not Terran, it's fine though you got it right on the copy paste :)
---
What size monitors do you have there
---
Do you ever feel claustrophobic at this desk?
---
100% hunter
---
I want to post a battlestation pic, but I'm too lazy to clean my desk.
---
I have that exact same chair, and it's falling apart from under me. I look forward to the day when I have one of those fancy twitch chairs.
---
Awkward.
---
&gt; -Warrior: Primal, good natured, **non confrontational**
---
What the fuck? It's a WARrior. Who specializes in FUCKING PEOPLE UP WITH WAR using any weapon available to them.
---
But I realize reading more of your post you seem to play Alliance so I guess it makes sense you would imagine Warrior as being goodie-two-shoes nice guys, since most Alliance races aren't even as thick as an Orc's mighty bicep. Carry on in your flowery little world, Ally scum.
---
You got it ;)
---
Yeah, I've never heard of these. Spent a lot of time in that area, too.
---
Weird.
---
Are you sure, I'm almost certain these marks only increased honor gain in classic and not reputation as well.
---
If a DPS pulls aggro on a raid boss he's generally getting 1 shot
---
Better racials imo (from nelf to hum), also easier starting zones
---
Is that comfortable to play for like 2+ hours like that?
---
You should really be doing ud strath for a crossbow
---
Its perfect for leveling guide or ClassicDB. But I mainly use it for discord
---
Sounds like it will be eleven days from now (May 19th) since he does 3, 3 and 5.

Consider also that you have to buy/make ammo and always feed your pet.

If I had to give this machine, I’d call him “Blueberrysnuf”!

Unsub and get the blueposts from WoWhead. We'll all benefit from that.
---
30 is when I beeline to Desolace. Lots of decent quest gear to pick up there, and ya boi Rexxar has your back if any Alliance come along.
---
I guess it's about gauging the total number of players who will show up opening day or opening week, and compare that to how many of those people are specifically coming from having experienced private servers and crave that classic replay culture.
---
Classic private server fans community and YouTube Stars may have gotten this thing made, but it's the hundreds of thousands of retail players who check it out that will make it a massive success. And those players, the ones who have not played on private servers, the only be at the very start of the classic replay experience.
---
I mean really, even for five or ten year vanilla private server replay veterans, there was that first time when they played a private server with classic and it was only their second time experiencing classic, with the first time being 2004 classic. Other players will never have experienced classic at all.
---
We know the private server Community finds enjoyment in replaying content over and over again. We don't know if your average retail player will find that same enjoyment.
---
But it could very well happen, sure. But why 6 months? Why not three months? Why not two months? And then what's the plan for those servers? They hit the end of content and they just stay frozen there, and the server list gets longer and longer, and some people leave old service to start on new servers? And it's a replay of the private server fresh hike dead people complaining about servers dying scene?
---
Maybe it won't go down that way. Maybe they will Have regularly starting classic servers. They're obviously asking for input from popular private server players and we don't know what that input entails. Is just for calling checking the game? Are they asking those players to tell them what your average classic private server replayer is looking for? Because that could shape what blizzard does.
---
I don't know what they'll do with that. But I think there's a better chance that we will have progression servers, because that's what blizzard did, retail is 1 progression, they know how to do that. Maybe they will have regularly starting or restarting servers, a progression for blizzard is the obvious first thing to handle because it's what they've done for 15 years.

Is there a way to access your retail friends list without resubbing btw (maybe one of the data files or something)?

I definitely have a bunch of old names on there that I can't recall, but not sure I really wanna spend money just to see them

Hi, /u/RobGFour
---
nah dog, the solstices and equinoxes are the same date everywhere on the planet
---
A boss, sure, but in my experience tank fuckups that escalate are usually trash or adds due to lack of situational awareness or slow response time.
---
Rarely. You can't see it but I have a desk in the middle of the room that I use for my laptop and other fluff. If I ever need a second screen for anything I just use the [laptop](https://i.imgur.com/cDTRUgW.jpg)
---
Guess you have found your class than :)
---
Feel exactly the same, tiddies on your shoulder.
---
I remember the first time finding out about them. I found it unfathomable of how  I would get 15$ a month.
---
I would pay good money for an official MoP server. Hot damn.
---
That's the metaphorical equivalent of telling your manager that if he wants TPS reports done then he should do them himself. After you've already agreed that was part of your job. Any smart woman will move in with their boyfriends before marrige to set these expectations ahead of time. There is no way in fuck this guy hasn't already agreed to keep things clean.
---
I can gauarntee you every adult relationship with clean people starts with clear expectations of chores and cleanliness. And if that wasn't made clear before you can bet she will leave him.
---
It'd be cool if they got in contact w/ blizzard and then could get blizzard to have a small link to it on the Wow classic launcher page. Then you'd really get a lot of people on there.
---
the seasons are always dependent on their respective solstice/equinox. for once the states (and canada uses this too to determine seasons) aren't fucky with their measurement.
---
Sure, but that doesn't really mean anything. I mean, I'd love it to be true but I don't know this guy and like I said I've only recently heard about him, so it just makes me skeptical... idk..  
---
At least he keeps the crowd hyped, so there's that. /shrug
---
Australian summer
---
Yeah I'll most likely main dwarf rogue on classic.
---
It took me several google attempts to remember. :)
---
It's particularly easier after the change they made to taunt in whatever patch that was.
---
I literally just did a quest today where i control a dinosaur and it was impossible to die.... even if i "die" it only  dismounts me and puts me back at the start where i start  the dinosaur sequence.  
---
Its so freaking boring... theres absolutely NO threat in that kind of a quest and it just feels pointless considering the quest is one of those alliance vs horde ones, i was killing horde forces with the dino.
---
Thanks I hate it
---
Why not let people add their class as well?
---
Druids are the most dynamic class in the game, not sure how it felt boring!
---
Except for Hammers, you can keep your hammers
---
all the bs with the vehicles in wrath are where it really started in earnest. TBC had a few harmless bombing runs, nothing too major.
---
It's 8 days from the 8th, Thursday the 16th, beta goes live. Source: it coincides with when my wife and kid go on a trip without me for a week, so it's fate.
---
Lol I mean I appreciate the subtle hints I guess, but if you are trying not to piss blizzard off or break your nda well...I am not sure if he will get invited back to another event like this. If you are going to do this why not just tell us, you are saving your own skin with these subtle remarks. Tips isn't very smart
---
It mostly happened with a dense server population. As you leveled a new server, both sides would still have a large group of the player base in these quest hub ranges. Eventually enough small fights became huge battles
---

Maybe they meant Australian summer which starts December first so 2019 summer could be the literal last day of 2019

I’m so damn jelly of all these setups

I’ll be lucky to have my laptop by launch lol

Still hyped though , For the Horde!

ONLY THE GODDESS MAY FORBID ME ANYTHING.

I like healing and am fine running stuff as holy.  Do you, or anyone else reading this recall if healing as ret with an int set is viable for dungeons at 60?
---
Look ma! Someone who uses over priced razor products.
---
I dig the setup tho it looks comfortable enough to game there all day
---
what are island expeditions?
---
What can they do to stop him? He has basically already broken any NDA he had signed. If this was going to burn a bridge between him and blizzard it's already burnt with these little leaks
---

---
Shamans can tank?
---
Yeah honestly I've got two young kids now and I don't even foresee myself raiding for a while.  I'd be pretty happy doing dungeons and PvP as ret/holy. I think I really need to look up some ret PvP info and find a possible build...
---
Or else I can just go priest

We should have a arena discord everyone can join so we can all scream at the fighters and root for who we think will win

2019 will destroy me for this reason. I just keep repeating TLOU and Re2 until it's ready
---
[here you go](https://www.twitch.tv/moo_uk)
---
very nice
---
Exactly my thought
---
Dwarf rogue is badass
---
&gt; Not like in modern WoW where there's no reason to have an innkeeper in any town because you have fuck all reason to return after you've done the 3 quests they have to offer.
---
Not only that but flight points are far far more frequent, to the point of ridiculousness.
---
Breaching an NDA is more than just his relationship with Blizzard, it basically means no developer or publisher will deal with him. It's complete career suicide for an online personality to breach an NDA - and for what? A few clicks?
---
How does that make any sense? If he was doing this with the intent of burning bridges why wouldn't he just announce it upright. It makes no sense to sabotage your channel by teasing like this.
---
For 5 man? The guy could heal naked np!

wait, what ?  .. is that real?  Are they good for carpet?  I can ditch the shitty plastic floor things?
---
No lay on hands, rule as old as time.
---
yea you dont have to be resto spec to 5man heal. just need int/spir and + healing gear.
---
I’m in a similar boat. I think it comes down to do you like kiting or do you like face tanking?
---
Both classes have a lot of cc and utility so it really comes down to the movement aspects. 
---
Kiting and running around or being a stationary turret.
---
No he’s a private server esfand/rich/staysafe didn’t raid in vanilla. Asmongold hit 60 in like patch 1.11-1.12
---
no, you are ok
---
My pc wouldn’t let me use higher resolution on the one private server I played. I didn’t realise that everyone else WASN’T playing on 4:3. Only found on when I shared some screenshots on discord. Guildmates got me to try a dozen things but we couldn’t fix it. I figured it was part of the nostalgia/immersion
---
A lot of what is says is inaccurate or Pservers info
---
Exactly, it literally makes no sense what he is doing lol. If you are gonna fuck yourself, might as well just give us all the info.
---
People are saying fear or pressure, but honestly for a lot of people its the fact that you only need one or two for a raid. Limited spots and the ones that get in obviously get fed gear so the discrepancy is large between tanks. 
---
You can tank dungeons all day of course, but when talking end game there's very limited spots to get in compared to everything else. And they're garbage at pvp so that's not even an option lol
---
agree. and i am ok with this. i got my raid crew, a full server would be great, sure, but ill be there anyway
---
Yes I have a set on mine they glide on EVERYTHING! They are fucking AMAZING.
---
You have to think from a game standpoint, if we didn’t have these quests there would be literally nothing to do instead of figuratively nothing to do.
---
dude has 28k posts by 2013... he lives on the forums and does nothing in game
---
Cool. Simplicity &gt; clutter any day. Could maybe get a 2nd monitor, and I personally don't like the keyboard and monitor quite so far away from me, but meh personal preference. 
---
For the horde!
---
NO CHANGES!
---
wtf dude
---
Ooh, fellow Protector. \*highfive\*
---
There arent many of us who has this tabard. It think even on retail its still using the OLD animation for holy nova, so kinda cool.
---
Will they do ok on carpet, and not leave oil or dirt stains on it?  Thanks for the tip, these look very interesting.
---
Noble samurai.
---
I miserably failed but did the same thing. Got all of Kalimdor but missed most of the North in EK, and a chunk of the middle (around blackrock mountain).
---
Missed the north coz I was mentally blocked trying to think of the starting zones up there, just plain forgot to tick off the plaguelands. I just haven't quested around blackrock for so long that I couldn't name it.

works but

---
Haha ya epic battlestation gamer cant wait to drink some gmaer girl piss lmao this pwns
---
keep licking that leather
---
Don't forget rogues, hunters and warriors as well
---
Argent Dawn tabard indeed is identical to the protector one... but well, its inferior because it doesnt have an ability. :P  
---
For that reason the protector isnt that unique... since it looks like a tabard you could acquire for a long time  even after the battle of dark portal.  
---
I dont recall exactly how you were able to get the tabard of the protector but it does say you needed to take part in the defense of the dark portal, aka burning crusade pre-event.
---
Kill everything on your way to quests.
---
This tip is usually given for efficiency, but it really serves well in smoothing out the leveling process. It gives you wiggle room in choosing quests and zones.
---
I have the same screen as you and I'm ashamed to admit I never knew it had two usb-ports on the side, three years after buying it. Great screen though, minimalistic design yet good for gaming!
---
I’ll add my support, but truth be told, RP is a side project for me (and the only servers I play on are PvP, whether RP or not), so this subject is important to me, but probably not so much for launch because the majority of my time will be focused on regular PvP server.
---
But I fully support RP-PvP servers at release
---
Yeah. Which in my mind means he's either fucking with us or has been told he can tease it.
---
Best setup I’ve ever seen.

---
If we are assuming you are always grouped with your duo partner, Paladin will be as good as or better than a Priest. 
---
There is no data or rigorous research done on this, but eyeballing Priest versus Paladin I could see a great argument for Paladin/Warrior synergising better assuming you can guarantee perma-duo. 
---
Priest leveling depends highly on a "slow but steady" approach with wanding and spirit tap which are both not particularly conducive to duoing.
---
Huuuuuuuge

---
Can you actually play WOW on three monitors at once?
---
Well, you're Horde so you never had any real honor to begin with.
---
It kinda should be remastered so it can run better on modern hardware, atleast when i last played there were some wonky stuff going with the resolution... it works fine tho but i would like to see remastered graphics.  
---
Even then they said something about remastering the stratholme-mission to make it look more like what stratholme looks like in WoW. I dont know if this means changing the layout of it but defo graphics.  
---
And to me as a veteran classic player Stratholme is one of the most iconic dungeons and i cant wait to see it in WC3 aswell  as classic wow.   
---
Prepare to get feasted on by Cadaver Worms. :(

Okay, so he just took down all of the clips from this stream. Hmmmmm

I couldn't remember mulgore, probably because i can't remember the last time i leveled a tauren or went there for any reason...

Hi, /u/Fruitbatattack
---
I've always hated those kinds of quests. The only time they were cool was in TBC because it was new.
---
Get that alliance flag out of that red heaven!
---
&lt;3 hahahahahah
---
Me too. All those Warriors will have a cruel awakening, when they realize the slow leveling in the Vanilla days, for that particular Class.
---
Haha. I just started using them very recently actually. I work at home sometimes and just switch the USB pass through from my PC to my laptop. It looks worse but the convenience is worth it imo.
---
country roads...
---
As a Lions and Texas Tech grad, your OU and Packers combo sickens me
---
You are propably right

See you in September boys 😔

I mean, the Burning Legion created the Lich King

Who also was an Orc, so...

No you won't

Ding!
---
Thank you very much for your support, twopumpchump.
---
Current retail works on retail. There will be no issues.
---
My best case scenario of is it done well enough to warrant BC servers and Wrath Servers down the line
---
Classic should work on Mac
---
Just tired of waiting, its gonna be mid-late summer a least..
---
Are you referring to the concentration camps that the Alliance put the Orcs in after the Orcs attempted to invade their world and genocide all of them? Instead of killing all of them?
---
Those concentration camps?
---
After all this time I finally have a career and disposable income to spend on a rad gaming PC. And it sits mostly unused except for counterstrike, warcraft 3, and soon to be Classic WoW. I always think that's funny.
---
Cool bongs
---
Every one is talking about responsibility etc, but a huge part of it is just pure numbers from a class distribution perspective.
---
Every class can viably DPS in 5 man dungeons while leveling, sure depending on spec and class you might not really be pulling your weight but you can still half ass it.
---
Three classes can heal 5 man dungeons per faction.
---
Two classes can tank for Horde, three for Alliance and two of those classes have huge stigmas attached to their tanking abilities (even if they are totally fine in 5 mans).
---
The vanilla stigma is more or less that only warriors can tank so you're relying on 1/8 of the player pool to fill 20% of dungeon slots.
---
So from the get go you're going to have more healers and DPS proportionate to party size than tanks. Then you add on all of the additional reasons people have listed meaning that a decent chunk of those warriors don't want to tank...
---
The biggest issue is a lack of viable tanking classes in vanilla, or the stigma that because druids and paladins can't tank raids well that they aren't fine in 5 mans.
---
Technically they only released a server like OP was referencing last year. Everything else progressed through expansions.
---
MoP wasnt that bad of class design thats for sure. But a class is more than 1-2 buttons.Many of the class skills could be used in everyday situations wether thats world pvp or dungeons.For example mage was completely a faceroll char, but their portals and the food was quite on demand and they were being used.The CC aswell
---
That’s what my 2nd paragraph says...

+Weaponskill is one of - if not the best damage increases you can get.  You should rate it very highly, and as the other guy suggested, dropping points in OH damage is preferrable.
---
Lol same
---
I don't see why they wouldn't. Most of their games run on MacOS and I'm fairly sure that WoW has since forever.
---
Just clarifying as you made it sound like it’s been happening for a decade.
---
He could have just ate any number of consumables to fix that.
---
"can healers heal?"
---
Thats the dream situation... but in reality most people just blow their load immediately and use engineering gadgets and other cooldowns immediately to try and win a fight.  
---
A few years ago i was still watching and rating new pvp videos on Warcraftmovies.
---
It was evident when you compare vurtne to some of the newer kids-on-the-block that they just dont know how to think  tactically... blowing engineering loads immediately for cool combos and to win even 1v1 situations, but then when you look at vurtne he doesnt use gadgets unless he needs to.
---
I think classic pvp is gonna end up like this: tryhards will do nothing to hold back and waste their mana on any small piece of damage possible and then they run out of mana and cant do anything.  
---
I claim that classic pvp has more tactical aspect to it than that and only real pros know how to sustain themselves and not run out of steam immediately.   
---
Engineering gadgets help extend this steam and live a little longer perhaps.
---
I bet classic is gonna spawn numerous pvp videos for sure... most will be crap in the exact way i explained, no longevity in the player combat... just spam spells/items/stuff until enemy dies and call it skill. :D
---
To me its never skill or even cool if you need to use all your cooldowns to kill 1 player... even 2 if you outgear them. This is completely different in high end duels (in those you need to use everything, maybe), but most entertaining pvp videos arent about high end pvp to begin with... its about 1vX situations.
---
The veneer on that desk is killing me
---
There just is something off about alliance players. The races and the overall faction is fine but the players seem super strange. They either can't do ANYTHING alone and always needs someone by their side. Also their seems to be way more female characters on the alliance side espeically nelfs and humans (female human rogue is an abomination) which seems usually pretty thirsty. Like your character is kinda supposed to represent you and not look like a barbie doll. Alliance also attracted more naive carebears that ask stupid questions and want to do every quests in a 5 man group. For the factions alone I could see me playing alliance the horde players just feel more agreeable to me.
---
Would you say that this is all... dogshit posting?

I’m just enjoying the fact that it literally looks like a dick is poking the logo (albeit with a stick).

Yea, man, my only experience with Gurubashi arena is wandering into it, looking around, finding nothing of interest, and leaving. Not sure how it operates during the chest event thing.
---
Chiropractors are scam artists.  Work with physical therapists instead.
---
I’m not questioning your honor.  I’m denying it’s existence.  
---
In all seriousness, honor is a cornerstone of the Horde.
---
Thanks! As a night elf fan, I had to get it when I came across it.
---
I was struggling with that too. Choose aesthetics honestly. The priest racials are very close in PvP. Devouring plague if undispelled can alone win you some kills, but if it can be, Troll has slightly better PvP racials.
---
However I'd still go with your nr 1 class fantasy. Priest Racials are so close on Horde anyways. In PvE it makes no difference. Troll just heals a tiny bit more with Beserking but skill will trump that anyday.
---
I just like the thought of being a female troll with a Benediction on an Ivory Raptor. And I like using Beserking on casters, it's not much but I find it to be such a fun CD. :D
---
I'd rather do 1000 of these types of quests than kill 1000 Zhevras and still not have enough of their hooves to finish the damned quest.
---
Lol I looked at that and was just scratching my head. Then I finally realized wtf was going on. My sides
---
Oh man, I remember trying to take out those Sunwell Black Scar demons in Quel'Danas for the first time not knowing I had to kill them all from the comfort of a flying mount dropping bombs that would one-shot them. :D
---
Loot councils will favor people upgrading from pre-raid BiS to epics, since people without BiS can still get upgrades out of raid. Kind of anti-intuitive since replacing the worst item would give the biggest overall improvement, but it also makes sense not to incentiveize showing up in twill.
---
Yea... this is probably the coolest one I've ever seen.  Congrats OP.
---
That looks painful tbh
---
Male has better cast animations than female undead no? Sure the males run weird but hey its a cool skeleton guy!

Besides the pro-gnome propaganda.. wtf is this post.

2004 was a different time I suppose. I remember playing DoD and CS (the half-life mods) and thinking 150-200 ping was acceptable lol
---
Okay
---
They both needed frozen food badly.
---
Given the limited number of quests in Vanilla, I absolutely love when an NPC says: 
---
"Kill 10 of these"
---
"Collect 10 of these by killing these"
---
Gimme 10 killing mobs quests and I'll go to town and turn them all in at the same time.
---
Lok'tar ogar! Sweet set up. I think I'll be rolling UD Rogue when Classic drops. But, I am not opposed to UD Mage or Lock.
---
You also get teleport moonglade at 10 so you can set your hearth to wherever and portal back for your druid quests.
---
isnt the tabard from TBC?
---
this. theyre going to release it late august / early september like bfa. why? because that is when people return to school and settle into a routine. get them college kids hooked during classes, instead of while theyre out playing for the summer.
---
Human racials for rogues is so overrated its unreal, terrible pvp racials and maybe 3% dmg increase from sword spec is laughable. Gnome lets u shit on mages easier and dwarves let you poop on wars hunts other rogues can even remove devouring plague and druid bleeds
---
Hmmmmmm indeed. Illuminate confirmed! 2+345 =347!!! This is huge guys!
---
Love my Herman Miller, and I picked up an aftermarket headrest to top it off!
---
So if all 3 of the summer releases have been released in late summer doesn't that indicate they're going to release it in late summer as well?
---
I hate influencers with a passion.
---
Ordered!
---
Lol I was just teasing but judging by the comment and the downvote sounds like I touched a nerve.
---
or "guys, wink wink, I had some tips for ya, but *had to* delete them... be sure to watch my next fourteen 10 minute videos"
---
With the 2008 Olympics tabard?
---
Sounds boring. Must be one of them newer expansions the kids are talking about.
---
All I know is I can't wait to get my mits on some good old fashioned Classic vanille.
---
\*lips old man lips\*
---
didn't that tabard come out after vanilla though
---
Pft, what honor is there in murdering innocent civilians and sacking Stormwind? 
---
And before you fire back with "member hillsbrad" the Alliance doesn't say things like "honor is the cornerstone of our existence" 
---
Horde are the baddies. For the Alliance.
---
Why does BFA get a smile though?
---
Only 13. That is plenty old enough for the game I have heard of people that had older brothers that started vanilla he was 4 and basically was taught hour to que for warsong and cast shadowbolt.
---
Lol I was just teasing too but judging by the comment and downvote sounds like I touched a nerve.
---
M
---
Hate to say it but I cant help but agree. Every expansion release the past three expansions have been in late summer. Useless....
---
But...but...it says 41.
---
Wait wait wait... How are there 4 healing classes per faction?
---
oh crap not intended
---
Bro it was a joke, no need for medical advice, lmao.
---
It's not even wow related at this point. This is really getting out of hand.
---
whats the size of the world map poster ? it looks awesome
---
All I know is the only base races/genders that I like are Female Night Elves, Female Trolls, and Female Orcs.
---
“Strength and honor!” Orcs are pretty sophisticated despite looking and moving and speaking like... they aren’t and they tie all the other races together.
---
5?
---
Fat Guy Harlem
---
Basilisks have so much vendor trash and you can bank / mailbox right at gadget.  Love that place on pve servers.
---
Yeah was like a week before TBC dropped I think
---
Sorry, the _right_ way to spell it doesn't work.
---
I’ll have to get back to you on that. Standard poster size I think. It’s awesome because it shows all of the flight paths
---
Druid tanks are consistently better than warriors in 5mans. I reckon it's because a druid is tanking because they want to tank where as a lot of warriors are tanking so that they can get gear.
---
Male Tauren Warrior, Male UD Rogue, Female UD Mage: awesome
---
Everything else: dead to me

This is my perception of what each race and class is in real life.  Like, what it says about the person behind the keyboard.
---
\-*Dwarves*: Either angry manlets, fat beardos with an unwarranted sense of self-importance, or if priest, a no-life min/maxer.
---
\-*Humans*: Tough to really have a stereotype of humans since they're so common.  Could just be a normal dude, but often times it is someone kinda derp.
---
\-*Gnomes*: Eccentric weirdo, but in a good way.  Also a higher number of female players seem to play gnome.  Don't take themselves too serious.  Are actually probably a very good player.
---
\-*Night Elf*: Ted Kaczynski did nothing wrong.
---
\-*Orc*: Deranged sexual fetishist (srs).
---
\-*Troll*: Sort of the horde equivalent to humans.  Not because they're common, because they aren't, but because they're the most normal seeming.  Little bit of gnome crossover as well, as they tend to not be overly serious types.
---
\-*Undead*: Tryhard.  If warlock or shadow priest, trying very hard on being a tryhard.
---
\-*Tauren*: Russian/East euro tryhard, 12 year old, or someone with incredibly poor hygiene.
---
\-*Mage*: If high enough in level, an absolute burnout from having so many sheeped mobs attacked.  I seriously won't say shit to a 60 mage in a dungeon pickup group if he isn't sheeping.  Dude has seen things you wouldn't believe...
---
*-Warlock*: Race dependent.  See above for undead and gnome.  I don't think I have ever seen an orc warlock in game.  If human, definitely derp.
---
\-*Priest*: Positive and relaxed, unless in tier gear and NEEDS TO GET HIS DM:T BUFFS NOW YOU FUCKING PLEBES, I GOTTA RAID IN LIKE 30 MINUTES!
---
\-*Warrior*: Overconfident jackasses, until you ask one of them to slap on a shield and tank, then it's just "I'm fury this" and "I'm arms that."
---
\-*Paladin*: Every single ret pally thinks he's the one who's going to "finally figure it out."  Probably has nightmare of the character creation screen.  If I see one in cloth I take pity on him.
---
\-*Rogue*: Much like paladins, every rogue thinks he's figured out the best ganking build possible ("getting good at pvp" is not part of the equation most of the time though).  Depending on commitment to being a jackass and wise target selection, is either the most commonly /spit on character or /laugh at character.
---
\-*Hunter*: Not as dumb as everyone says they are, but those pets sure are.  Still kinda dumb though as a lot will insist their pet can tank dungeons for the group.
---
\-*Druid*: Selfless, good spirited, but much like paladin, if I see one in cloth, I pity him.
---
Pffft tank has lead for marking. If the dps fucks up and blames you you can just kick them and find another dps.

Is that just regular canvas, no frame? I was looking at a bunch of similar ones on aliexpress.
---
So tiny lol. Get a 27"
---
That map of Azeroth is badass
---
Fuck the haters. 
---
Playing WoW at a desk is for nerds. 
---
Do you man!
---
The banners and Map are a nice touch
---
from my experience, getting opened on by a rogue with no frost trap pre-placed makes it really difficult. Granted I was a troll hunter so orc would've been nice but yeah.

You win, bro....at life.
---
Then perhaps we shall meet in STV one day...
---
From what I've seen recently, ppl gonna get camped in 50 zones.  You will fly in and get killed, and then roving bands of HK farmers will come through and kill you while you're questing in the zones.
---
I've seen it twice now where the server starts out almost 50:50 split on factions, and then one faction has more/better 60 PvP'ers and suddenly the other side starts to slow down leveling 50-60.  Ratio starts looking like 60:40; the reality is worse because that 60% has more 60's.  Some of them don't even PvP but when you can hold down another faction you gain resource nodes, you can move around faster, so even they find an incentive to smash lowly 50's.
---
Considering its a LOTR Frodo reference it's actually pretty fucking hilarious.
---
They were removed because he didn't pay the dog tax.
---
Yes if you allowed mc caps any group combat would just come down to whose worked or resisted lol.
---
Damn. That's what my battle station aspires to be.
---
Classes that scale the best with gear for damage are Warrior&gt;Mage&gt;Rogue&gt;Warlock&gt;Hunter
---
&gt; I know the current OS doesn't run vanilla for...undocumented servers
---
I've played pservers on my Mac with the 1.12 client, it definitely works
---
Nice and clean vanilla setup. And thats what its all about
---
Shamans are tied for the second best dungeon/raid healers with priest. Pallies have effectively infinite mana if played correctly so they have no real rival.
---
I have one, you're looking at it.
---
You remind me of a friend named gabe.
---
If this is real I'm so buying it. But it's not.
---
I don't know if vanilla-TBC worked when they were retail; since I had a windows PC at that time way back then. I know in recent OS updates there was something removed that was required for old installments of WoW to run on Mac.
---
If it's a good enough size and detail i will definitely be buying it.
---
Do it in retail, I don't want it in classic.
---
Trash and dungeons yea, tank mistakes are much more evident. A lot of raid bosses (or even dungeon bosses) Are basically stand there and roll your face over the keyboard as a tank
---
Curious, I saw that you have a 2 year old... How are you planning your game time? Is your wife okay with it?
---
Any reports of a mousepad?
---
I'm talking about running WoW without the use of 3rd party software like Wine. I'm talking having a native client for Mac.   
---
Also I've tried to run WoW on my Mac with Wine and I have to edit things to make it run; otherwise it just gives me an error on launch and I also can't use some addons as I'll get errors with them as well (but they work on my crappy PC with WoW and it's the same download)
---
Once those Cata and D3 posters come down you'll be looking great. 😂❤️
---
hate to be that guy but whenever you took a screenshot the fps dropped just for that moment I'm pretty sure
---
No mouse pad. It's nothing people want anymore. And they won't put a mouse mat into a box.
---
There’s my Gnomie. My Gnome-boy if you will.
---
Shadow priest once they get spell power gear later on become monsters, in pvp and pve.
---
Math checks out.
---
O
---
That's crazy pants to put Warlocks so far down on that list. The +hit gear you get from the BWL and ZG phases *massively* increase their damage because they don't have adequate +hit skills in their trees unlike Mages (or even Shadowpriests). The power jump from the early phases to the later ones is massive.
