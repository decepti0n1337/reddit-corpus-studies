Cool take, only the third time this has been posted today!

Nope, it is true. Look at the spreadsheet.
---
Nah that BS, that back door jump has been around since the beginning and that‚Äôs all there is to it. You can keep arguing about it on Reddit but that ain‚Äôt changing history nor will it change the future. 
---

---
Time to move on.
---
Operating a private server is not illegal? Do you have a source for that?
---
Yep gimme some crit buff mister oomking &lt;3
---
That's unfortunate.
---
Having never played those, I would still like Classic+ to stay on the current continents but add the zones that don't exist, raise level cap to 70, TBC talents, but don't do flying mounts or Outland.
---
This should help

---
So the lvl 40 guy is not falling behing the guy who whos clearled mc 100 times?
---
Bullshit yes you dont need to compete with everyone but that doesnt mean you dknt gall behind.
---
Classic wow is the game you can fall behind the most take a month break and your prettt behind.
---
you can go SM at 20
---
Deathbringer is not good at all for humans, which are the main ally race for pve warriors.
---
If you can find proof on it existing, sure.
---
I think I have pretty strong case
---
Get naked and dance on a mailbox.
---
Just Google it lol. It's not secret.
---
I wish we had Classic WoW, but with updated graphics, QoL improvements and more content.
---
He's following the rules
---
Wow you were correct!  Relogged and it appeared.
---
Thanks!
---
Blizzard has nothing to do with CoD
---
eh. i‚Äôve picked my fair share on Blaumeux
---
I genuinely had no idea about class discord‚Äôs until you guys told me. Have had some good reads today. Thanks guys!
---
How much is classic costing you per hour played?  It‚Äôs a pretty good fucking deal imo
---
My statement was in response to the iPhone/Android argument.
---
Personally I remember av queues being really long so you could play 2 or 3 ab games in the time a av q would take so av wasint a good way to honor grind alone.
---
It gives you a menu for whatever gear slots you want to swap. Disable any slots you don't want shown. Items can be queued up to swap once you drop combat  as well.
---
Well, my proof is my experience and game time. I‚Äôve been playing since before the release of AV. I played alliance at that time and remember well the horde would use a couple of backdoor strats cuz the bridge was OP. This was when AV would literally last for days and days, before the nerf. Now as horde in retail, I‚Äôve been using that backdoor anytime I play AV and I‚Äôm usually the only one doing it. 
---
This backdoor wasn‚Äôt created In Legion, you‚Äôre dead wrong. I‚Äôm done going in circles with you about it. Move on cuz it‚Äôs as old as AV itself and clearly ain‚Äôt going anywhere.
---
It can be used to generate a full soul shard. You summon the VW then run out of range, giving you a soul shard when it despawns.
---
Most talents work this way. Druid's improved rejuv only increases the base amount. Paladin's healing light only increases the base amount. etc. etc.
---
I don't think there are very many, if any, "+x% to (spell)" talents that affect the total amount instead of just the base amount.
---
Sounds basically like itemrack, I'll give it a try ty
---
How are you gonna fine or jail some chinese bot devs?  Unlikely.  At best you get IP ranges banned.
---
As a software dev, there's tons they could do to combat botting, but the fact they are running rampant says they simply don't care.
---
&gt;bots would be worse
---
They are already bad. If bliz banned those that were obvious [time/day played, responses to automated whispers, analyzing combat patterns for bot-like consistency], there would be less.  If they banned bots before they reached 50 or 60 as a rule, it would not be profitable to run bots at 15/mo, and so it would not be even close to what it is now.  Bots are bad because they know bliz sucks at / doesnt care to deal with them.
---
You always get more xp from a full group. If not full bring some randoms and it will help alot
---
&gt; also reported the cheaters ofcourse
---
Won't do shit, because hurr durr banwaves.
---
Had a mage boosting me in SFK. there‚Äôs only a few mobs in the courtyard outside the door that have anti magic shield I believe(I could be wrong) and then the human ghosts that can silence. 
---
The best part of SFK Is that you can leave alts at the portal and they‚Äôll still get full xp as the dungeon has a small footprint. 
---
We did;
---
Rfc 8-18
---
SFK 18-22
---
SM 22-44
---
ZF 44-52
---
BRD 52-56 (can now do gorshak spam to 60)
---
LBRS 56-60
---
I'm starting to get burnt out on my low pop mostly soloing horde character but I still have a lot of fun when I group. Maybe ill take a little break then roll on a high pop ally server.
---
voracity is better
---
Pvp grinding for rank is a full time job if serious.
---
I would have to be the one to get your ticket at the time to pass judgment on if your scammer tickets were misplaced. Maybe it got put in the wrong queue to where it should have been. There are tons of factors at play I can't really speculate on. My only advice is if it's something that can wait till next week, open a ticket. If you need assistance that day like you were hacked and have no gear, open the web ticket. You can even open them for small things and they may frown upon it, but they will still help you. Just work with them and they work with you. Honestly I would give anyone who was nice on webchats game time or battle pets.
---
I did the same sort of test on a boomkin (yea it's fun for an alt) and the 10% dmg (moonfury) did not apply after spellpower, which sucks.
---
If you‚Äôre on myzreal, my holy pally would love to join and heal
---
Its 50/50 between all 40 people rushing for towers and commanders and having an actual game where we wipe alliance at Galv and get some recalls.
---
Most horde games are an expected loss where we just mop up the honor. Sometimes somone will type fuck it wipe them at galv and thats we win.
---
I didnt play  vanilla. but from what I have heard that this version of AV was intruduced in late vanilla, so till late vanilla it wasnt effective way to farm honor.  I could be wrong thou
---
Shouldn't be any excuse for not having NR gear since everyone knows ahead of time it will be needed.
---
No changes
---
Awesome!,
---
Not sure, can you tell us more about this event though lol sounds awesome.
---
Its just weird that the other backdoor strat was well known, while this far superior one was completely unknown. Considering this one would also be much easier to discover.
---
So yea
---
They don't NEED the orbs, they are just payment for doing it.
---
No, not at all. Farming WSG and AB all day long, going crazy on the special weekends. Av was not done at all, at least in the group I ran with
---
Ho√ó will you build haste?
---
I guess. I‚Äôd rather spend that time IRL. But I guess if that‚Äôs no an option for you ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I'd say go for it. I balance my life well, why can't you?
---
Just remember you can ALWAYS turn that shit off. That said, I find it fun to run dungeons, solo farm and PvP at cap. I haven't stepped foot into a raid and I'm having a blast.
---
Bots go in, bots go out. You can't explain that.
---
They're worth doing for some classes, the darkmantle for rogues springs to mind. Outside of that, it's pretty cool to be able to summon the extra dungeon bosses, they have some decent loot :p
---
&gt; Am I misremembering things? And if not, what is the explanation for the meta-shift?
---
Honor relative to effort (afk)
---
***
---
Vanilla was pre-mades focused around WSG/AB if you wanted to grind it out for top ranks. AB was the default (average person) where-as AV was just for farming HK's/reputation
---
Why is running into the horde base a "cheap" tactic?
---
If blizzard were to announce that everything I worked for would be reset for me to do it again then I'm literally quitting the minute they announce that. progressing to TBC would be alright but I only really want C+
---
Depends what you mean by behind. Everyone right now is running around in MC gear because that's the only raid there is. So you could easily run a few MCs and come out with equal gear to a lot of players. Classic is coming out in phases and we're still only in phase 2 of 6 so there's still a long way to go.
---
&gt;You didn't even have 16 debuffs in raids until ZG, which released after Naxx in real Vanilla.
---
What? ZG was patch 1.7, Naxx was 1.11
---
&gt; Facts are not opinions.
---
I agree.
---
He posted facts. 
---
You called him a liar, but just because you don't understand your opinions aren't facts.
---
Yea I made the mistake of rolling horde without thinking of all the min maxers who chose horde for pvp. Now I just can‚Äôt pvp in BGs at all.
---
It only drops off of Lv61+ elites. In dungeons, this means the abominations at the end of UD Strat, and some of the orcs in UBRS. Other than this, your best bet is coming across it in raid.
---
There are currently 3 people on my server with the enchant, myself included. I bought the formula a few weeks ago for 1500g. In vanilla WoW, there were only 2 people on my server with it. It is extremely, EXTREMELY rare, and you should not count on it appearing on the AH for a reasonable price for long.
---
I had someone straight up melee my ass down through a fucking wall while trying to defend him, someone just said "oh yeah, thats been in the game for a while now" YOU WHAT?
---
which room?
---
&gt; That's just like your opinion man.
---
&gt; I agree.
---
Choose one
---
I'm an addict too, you just cant if your like this.
---
Yeah - I have quite an addictive personality so I have to be careful.
---
Blizzard is basically dollars farming bot right now. They don't have script for banning other bots. ^^
---
Yes but xp is also decreased when your with somebody vastly higher level
---
Some people only reddit from their phone which makes it far easier to just take a pic and post it. I mean c'mon did this post really need to be high quality to get its point accross
---
I lvl drain tank
---
I like to play WSG, but I'm not grinding honor or anything. Also the fact that pugs get put in matches against premades all day is fucking annoying.

SM scales only with spellpower for shadowbolt and corruption

How nice of you redering to someone who is supposedly giving you a better version of a game ‚Äúbasement dwellers‚Äù, ‚Äúneckbeards‚Äù, and ‚ÄúFrenchies‚Äù
---
What a dick
---
[removed]
---
Hey ho and happy holidays.
---
Could anyone explain this to me (im a priest): So there is a lot of gear i stumble upon that has either +xx healing spells, then there is damage/healing and then there are + healing effects. Do they all mean the same (except the dmg/heal one (spellpower i guess))?
---
And how much +healing am i suppose to stack compared to stats? Is more better or are there some sort of balance. I think i can stack about +150 atm. But darn it really limits my stat gear. Im confused:(
---
Right? Savage Gladiator Chain took me 120 runs.
---
Well said. People like OP can only see black and white for some reason. You either love Classic unconditionally, or you hate it unconditionally.
---
I'm commenting on your last sentence. Do you think you are getting anywhere making reddit comments?
---
I don‚Äôt think anyone‚Äôs opinion on whether they should be allowed or not sways my opinion that robots that play battlegrounds for you is unacceptable 
---
At least those Match fixers fucking sleep!
---
Lolol this dude is awesome. ‚ÄúReal gamers‚Äù lmao
---
This üíØ
---
Aka home boy full of sh*t? Lol
---
&gt;Classic wow is the game you can fall behind the most take a month break and your prettt behind.
---
It's really not, my friend took a month off, then hit 60 and ran mc twice got 6/8 t1 and 2/8 t2. I've been raiding mc since week 3 I'm still only at 4/8 T1 and 2/8 T2...
---
We still only have MC and ony out there isn't enough content in the game for you to call behind like you claim.
---
ya same, my running average is 1.4 orbs per run. Getting 5 orbs in a run is like a 1/20 runs event.
---
&gt; but less hit, and static spell power isn't as good as a massive spell power you can combo with your cds, so 44 vs 29avg the difference isn't as big as it might seem
---
It‚Äôs 50% more spell power though. That‚Äôs factually a thing. The hit difference only matters if you need it, which depends on spec and class.
---
&gt; Yeah, it was on par with pre T4 items. It was nice to have, to juggle hit around but by no means "definitely bis until t5".
---
When did anyone say it was? How would it even make sense for T2 gear to be BiS until T5? I feel like you‚Äôre making up an example, just to argue a point. A point that I absolutely didn‚Äôt try to make. 
---
The fact that a mid tier raid item was competitive with heroic dungeon loot means that there really wasn‚Äôt a complete reset. 
---
&gt; And by "lower stats" you mean a crapload less mana and being a literal glass cannon.
---
Again depends on the class. Warlocks and Fire/frost Mages gained little from those stats, and weren‚Äôt really supposed to get hit often. A mix of Heroic dungeon gear and Naxx gear on either of those classes and you‚Äôll do more damage that someone purely in heroic dungeon gear. Without sacrificing any meaningful survivability.
---
For warrior prot tanks: is there a macro that when taunt is on CD it stance changes and uses mocking blow?
---
Lol you definitely get more xp with 3 other lowbies in the group when you‚Äôre getting carried. Sorry buckaroo.
---
That's about as constructive as "I hate everything. Fuck this game."
---
Lmao that's me rocking [[Observer's Shield]](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18485/observers-shield) on my shaman.
---
Nah. Those six hour Alterac Valleys on the original map are not a myth. Six hours of hard turtle at the bridge is worthless for honor beyond at most the first hour.
---
Iirc rep is the same. Honor is much less
---
Did you accidentally link the wrong videos? Because in both videos hes just auto walking into walls without using any spells.
---
Pve is a joke because we're using phase 6 talents and items while being in phase 2. The player base being smart helps no doubt but it was the choice to go off patch 1.12 that makes raiding a breeze.
---
No macro or addon would be able to do that. Best you could do is macro it together with a key modifier like shift or alt
---
For example the Healthy Scale in Scholomance or Blackhands Command from Scarshield Quartermaster is lootable by everyone. But they are dungeon/raid related so maybe they have different behaviors.
---
99% of vanilla was single realm, there wasn't the population to farm AV 24/7 even if it was the best. Even most private servers with 15k online during peak would only run AV on AV weekend.  
---
In classic we have a basically unlimited pool of players to enable it to run 24/7.
---
why will Leather workers be prevalent in tBC?
---
Grub farming is lucrative?
---
We will have to wait and see how it stabilizes. It was really slow when BGs were first released it was basically no world pvp, while now it seems to be increasing again.
---
And obv, alliance probably won't be as aggressive since we have insta-queue, so I don't think you have much to worry about.
---
No  tanks are gling to just come help you do strat live for a chance to roll on an orb. Its just not worth their time at that point. This is absolutely a case of supply and demand. And for you a case of being salty.
---
By that time bots earn enough money for 10-20 accounts
---
Doing routes though high level zones for dreamfoil, plaguebloom, icecap, and mountain silversage is a nice low-intensity farming method. It's not as much money as some other farming methods that require you to pay attention, but it's easy to do while watching Netflix on another screen or listening to podcasts or whatever else your preferred "zone out and play WoW" activity is.
---
All the same. Stat weighting depends on your playstyle but you can find a sim or make your own
---
Naxx won't be a cakewalk, simply because the way naxx was tuned not that it's really 'hard' mechanically, but the damage output in vanilla naxx is the same as wotlk naxx.
---
This is a pretty hot take. Most people were extremely fond of tbc and wotlk. The ‚Äúvocal portion‚Äù is the hardcore vanilla hold outs. 
---
On the contrary there was one 10 man raid in tbc and karazhan felt more epic than pretty much every raid in classic except for maybe naxx. The boss encounters actually finally start to seem interesting throughout the entire expansion in contrast to classic which took until mid aq40 to change up the formula of spank tank dispel spam and and don‚Äôt stand in shit. 
---
Arenas where actually pretty fun for most pvpers and as we‚Äôve seen now people enjoyed them and that PvP system over the afk botting in av system. All the bg‚Äôs were still plenty active in tbc. And once naxx gear gets released you all will get a nice reminder of why blizzard created resilience and overhauled stamina. 
---
Daily quests were a minor thing that were added and were 100% optional. Most people I know didn‚Äôt even bother grinding them. 
---
The flying mounts always seems like a point of contention but it seems like for the most part players can‚Äôt decide what they want. When world PvP is active and flourishing you guys are crying on Reddit about how the game is unplayable and it takes several corpse runs to get into brm. When people have flying mounts to ignore that you guys are crying over world PvP being dead. So what exactly is it that you want? And even in tbc there was still plenty of world PvP it was just people competing over nodes and farming spawns. You just didn‚Äôt have people griefing each other at dungeon choke points. Even Azeroth itself was very much alive despite the outlands existing. 
---
No idea what you‚Äôre talking about in homogenization. Paladins and shaman becoming cross faction was very much well recieved at the top and people were very excited. The classes in tbc were probably some of the most diverse they‚Äôve ever been. Almost every spec had a clear niche role with a distinct playstyle. They were welcome in raids to various degrees. They also had distinct spells and utilities between them. And this was further built upon and enhanced with the wotlk expansion until blizzard decided to go off the fucking deep end in cata and pandaria. 
---
No idea where you‚Äôre getting any of this shit from.
---
Because private servers were run by and for the community. Classic is run by disgusting capitalist swine.
---
Do warriors now
---
My favourite thing is to throw a rank 1 blizzard down and get 60% slows on everyone.
---
Or some rank 1 frostbolts
---
I‚Äôm sure it depends on the server, but it has on mine at least.
---
Doing well I suppose. Bit a content drought with only MC and Ony up for raids but most people still have some sidegoals to work on. Battlegrounds have calmed down the outrageous world pvp since honor that, along with possibly ill timed free transfers, literally killed a couple servers alliance population. Blizz gonna blizz I guess
---
But do you want to?
---
"Angry mob is scary and hurts me"
---
Man I remember getting that on my orc back in the day. I only replaced it when I got The Untamed Blade. That proc+crusader+racial back then, bloodthirst could crit near 3k...miss that.
---
Yes this fun pvp not avoiding the enemy faction and winning/losing in 5 minutes
---
I highly recommend this, WP is a big GW streamer. He knows his stuff, would love your thoughts from the WoW perspective!
---
Vectus can go to hell, I ran scholo 50+ times with no drops. I ended up getting choker and giving vectus the finger.
---
It wouldnt be so bad if you didnt have to go get a new box every time.
---
I've seen it twice both times it was around 1.5k gold
---
How is it worse? Why is it worse? I don't see it. To me it seems alot better. I'm having so much fun. No it's not perfect just like so many years ago.
---
&gt;TBH, I don't recall the Horde using that much during Vanilla.
---
Thats probably true, but it was known that it existed. Just not well utilized as you had to grind through the alliance base and needed a huge portion of people to use the strat.
---
&gt;Even in retail, the strat is barely used after all these years.
---
Thats probably true too, but on classic currently its utilized in almost every single AV. Whetever its small group or a slightly more organized bunch.
---
Either way, with the 1.12.1 nerfed AV, one guy can basically solo-cap all the objectives and perticularly annoying, clear out the towers solo.
---
Yup, most of the botters are US and EU players that want to play their account.
---
Expect to pay thousands of gold. FTFY
---
The real problem is (and this is from a guild management point of view I genuinely dealt with on the opening weeks) if a raid team has 20-30 players in dedicated PvE specs, everyones grabbing every buff they can - world buffs, pots (no flasks - to expensive) 
---
When we hit a boss (Rag) that we needed to be able to kill pre-submerge, DPS became a thing we needed to look at. Those players who are pulling the top DPS don‚Äôt like feeling held back by the players rocking up in PvP or meme specs.
---
Its not the attitude of the guild that decides whether its hardcore. Its how much you let people get away with it. I‚Äôve had to kick Mages from the raid for doing less DPS then me as a Tank, not because I had an issue with them but because we were going to hemmorhage the good players by letting it fly.
---
I‚Äôm only talking from a raidleading perspective, it broke my heart to sub / drop players for this reason but I had to do it. We couldn‚Äôt get them to pick up their game.
---
Human or Gnome tho?
---
I was about to do Gnome...but they look kinda funny on their mount lol
---
World pvp would be awesome again.
---
I was, because the top wowhead comment literally said so.
---
What a shit argument.
---
It only drops of raid/world bosses and eternium lockboxes... It is really really rare.
---
https://www.criticalhit.net/gaming/match-fixing-scripting-south-korean-police-bust-illegal-scripting-operation/
---
Yeah AAA companies like riot and blizzard don't go after the people creating the scripts and bots. They're just lazy and don't give a flying fuck about you while laughing with your $15.
---
me warrior me smash me publish on github
---
There are dicks everywhere in classic..
---
&gt; if you learn how to sit for reckoning stacks (incoming people who say you can't do that).
---
Wasn't that patched a week or so ago?
---
Yay! I‚Äôm leveling a warrior for the first time and would love to read it!
---
It's insanely rare idk what your talking about
---
Heroism drums I think
---
Great idea!
---
Oh look your actually intelligent i apreciate that.
---
It's a problem with your bag add-on. Disable it and they will appear. Has happened to me a few times already.
---
Tons of evidence and not a single link to be found.

nah bliz sux to work for these days - if they can't do it, it's simply because they don't want to.
---
Okay thanks. What do you mean sim?
---
Flasks stack in 5s I guarantee that as I have 40 in my bank

Red mageweave pants.
---
Dreamweave Vest.

Dreamweave Circlet. (Level 45)
---
Super good gear for ele, altogether available for probably less than 25g on the AH.
---
&gt;Take one look at him and you can see why he‚Äôs the way he is.
---
Is he an absolute whale or what
---
When they ban the bots ASAP it gives the developers of said bot insight into how they are tracking them. They do them in waves so the bots don't get too difficult to track.
---
Technically Scripture isn't wrong, but the way hes assuming everyone knows about the "club" hes talking about is kind of weird to me.  It's currently not possible to be crit capped with BiS gear/buffs. After you're crit capped you need to match 1% crit to 1% hit otherwise the stats are wasted. 
---
OP should definitely aim for 6% hit
---
Why?
---
Doesn‚Äôt how much honor horde gets if everyone gets it
---
Lmao I never even tried for it, went Triune Amulet &gt; Star of Mysteria &gt; Choker. People are way too serious about trying to min/max when they'll just replace gear from raids anyway. =p
---
Please elaborate
---
Yep.  As a Horde herbalism is a great way to fill those Q times.  Silversage and icecap in winterspring.  And then dreamfoil/sungrass and other herbs in Felwood plus getting the mats to cleanse songflowers for raids.
---
If I recall past the hit cap, 1 hit is worth 70% of 1% crit
---
This is very similar to the issue I clearly remember every guild having in vanilla, and now we're seeing repeated in classic. Only noone seems to remember it.
---
The progression cycle for a guild that's newly formed is that they start off struggling to fill a raid roster without taking pugs. And one day they announce "finally got MC on farm in guild only run" and suddenly there's 40 people every week and several people benched and rotated out. 
---
A lot of people talk about big game about wanting to raid and be semi-hardcore, but every raid has probably 15-20 players that just raid log to get carried through MC. This happened to vast majority of vanilla guilds and noone saw a problem at the time.
---
When BWL rolled around and people realised they wouldn't be carried through a two hour, no repair bill BWL run, suddenly only 25 people had their cousin's birthday that day and BWL was immensely hard just for the reason you couldn't fill a group again. And whole damned cycle continues when AQ40 drops.

His name says otherwise.

I don't play warrior, but I would assume it's because the 8str will affect every single ability you use in the same timeframe you use to get 1 more autoattack from haste.

When i read your post i knew the exact person you are lol. The type who joins PVP setver than blames everyone for pvping.

I literally laughed when i read this comment because it proved me right.

Imagine being that lame you wanna play pve but roll pvp becaause of your friend than sit there and complain about pvp on a pvp server
---
I met one of your kind the other day honestly you people make me sick with your logic lol go to a pve server dude thats what you prefer.
---
Hey man, you said it‚Äôs a rip off.  I bet it‚Äôs costing you 25 cents per hour to play.  If that‚Äôs a rip off, you might as well cancel your sub!
---
Love this!It confirms most thing i knew and some i wasn't sure about!Imp coa is such a waste of talent that yeah it isn't good for both pve and pvp which is why i take fel concentration great for pvp ,solo farming hell with it i can drain tank 5 man bosses np . Warlock dps can be great yeah, our guild locks out dps mages on most fights and  even in overall damage
---
Its gone to pre-phase 2 really. Most people wait for their queues near the battlemaster. Its definitely nowhere near as bad as it was during phase 2.
---
It isent an issue since Alliance have easier AV all around anyway.
---
...why would I be involved in this meeting.

You still do..... Instead of instant kicks being abused they get a timer to do something THEN get removed....... people just stopped reporting because they think it was removed completely..... it was NOT.
---
Huh? I've cleaned a lot of pheasants, and I wouldnt describe it as plucking.
---
Most rare pattern currently ingame. Yeah, even more rare than Lionheart.
---
Dude you where born in 93 your a fucking boomer lol.
---
Guess we are just gonna disagree. Wow gets worse the farther we get from vanilla and tbc is the start of it. Outside of shade of Aran or netherspite there‚Äôs not really any fight I remember in karazhan, and they were all Easy.
---
Horde with 20-30 min ques constantly running into ally premades that win in 6 mins. World ganking will make it's come back quickly. It's already bad again on my server.
---
Just as an FYI, no we're not. It might seem like all Alliance players join premades, but that like many other things, is not even close to true. As a result, many "legit" Alliance players experience a lot of 15v40 matches (Alliance being 15) at start or even Horde premades on occasion. 
---
For me, it's been almost every match as a loss because Horde are fairly organized. They've adapted to finally understanding how significant their terrain and NPC defenses are when they actually defend. Alliance pretty much only have the bridge as a good defense but with so many backdoor entrances going unfixed, it's almost every game having stuff like that picture happen. Add to it that while Alliance are slowly figuring out new offense strats (e.g. HARD RIGHT/LEFT!), it's the sort of thing that a braindead vegetable could adapt to. You'll rarely ever see Alliance go on D.
---
I get a fair amount on Faerlina. Being a Shaman helps but I got about 5 or so on my warrior as well. All in P2.
---
Did you marry that girl? If not you made the wrong choice
---
Activate the threat module.
---
??
---
Your asking if i read every post in here? Nah, i read your post and the sticky post.
---
I mean that was the vanilla experience too
---
Could always farm the felwood stuff if you got plenty of time now.

They use a seperate CD From potions, so it can be a nice boost to mana/health?
---
You underestimate how bad a lot of guilds are by far. The average mc clear time is around 1h:45mins. Razorgore for those guilds and the worse of them will absolutely struggle a bit on razorgore. A lot of them struggle with Rag still.
---
I'm more than familiar with the changes in talents considering i played back then and researched the changes heavily on waybackmachine. 
---
Those guilds will absolutely have to kite the dragonkin without wbuffs.
---
I guess some peeps just enjoy fulfilling an optimum role. I'm a tank, I find defending fun, but I'm far better suited tanking the bosses! Encourage people to fulfil their optimum role by using phrases such as "mages group up and crush those alliance scum!", "mages unleash your inner aoe baddas in the galv room!" etc etc in other words empower those you are deligating tasks to as opposed to bossing them with stressed out generic commands in raid warnings, rpg games require rpg methods, gotta inspire the team mon!
---
Blizzard have blocked this. Addons cannot make you swap your weapons during combat. You have to use macros.
---
‚ÄúThe Blizzard Bicentennial‚Äù
---
This. My brother has never agreed to try an mmo ever....because of thinking he has to play it all day every day or not play at all. And no in between. I've tried to explain to him about a billion times that you can play without worrying about how you stack against others. But he just doesn't get it. Shame. I've always wanted to level with him
---
Let's look at the other side of the coin.
---
Mages expect 1g to cast a 10 second portal for strangers that costs like 25s(?) to do?
---
&gt;uncrushable is based on defense skill, not avoidance
---
Could you elaborate? The oldest thing I could find was this [TBC article](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Uncrushability?oldid=1153131) that explicitly claims it's only about avoidance.
---
Seen it once on AH, about 3 weeks after the world first clear. Sold for 1,1k gold. 
---
I only had 700g at that time :(
---
Lol right
---
Just do other stuff. Don't sweat it if doesn't drop. Because when it does, you won't know what else you're gonna do with all that spare time you'll suddenly have on your hands again.
---
It's a game, have some fun. :)
---
People only want the good.
---
They share a cd with demonic runes
---
I like my mud huts thank you very much :)
---
Ah my bad!
---
&gt;You should stack spirit while leveling.
---
The number of people on here who swear by spirit and imp drain soul is astounding. Nice to see an actual analysis from an expert more or less debunking how supposedly great it is.
---
6 seconds with talents, and why not mention that you can respawn the VW for a shard every 30 mins
---
You seem salty
---
These mages also won't do a portal for less than 1g when it's a 10 second job at 20s cost!
---
They share a cooldown with demonic runes and warlock healthstones which both give more back so I don't know how much it would really be worth it
---
No, it is not because of streamers. Lots of games with no streams have the same issue.
---
Wrong again, the *actual* problem is Blizzard going ahead and releasing the world's shittiest system that rewards time invested instead of skill and requires you to play 16+ hours a day for months. Guess how many people bot rated battlegrounds or raids?
---
Damn, that‚Äôs brutal
---
Another reason is that the queue times allow Alliance to form premade AV groups by having all queue at the same time. This means that a lot of the good Alliance PvP players aren't in random AVs. The Horde doesn't have that option as their queue times are too long.
---
Or human druids.
---
Why it will be bannable by blizz lol? You guys want everything to be ban by blizz? ¬´¬†Hey this is selling devilsaur on chat cheaper than AH. Blizz should ban these guys they are not using the AH to get more money from the transaction and ruining the economy system¬†¬ª
---
Guild tabard and Guildless, ninaj'd from his ex guild no doubt
---
yep, atleast noone asks why you havent enchanted properly :D 100hp is even worse, 4-600
---
Yeah I agree. You can see a lot of things GW1 took from wow which almost seemed like they took just because. And I agree I think GW was really unique for it's time and also the best value mmo no doubt at the time.
---
There really should be a tldr even if it's 3 words from each section? Unless you're expecting people to sit down and spend 30 minutes reading each bit. Not trying to downplay what you spent time on but not everybody has spare time.
---
&gt;Spirit is the reason I was one of the first locks to hit 60 on my server, significantly bypassing other locks.
---
Maybe those other ones weren't going for server first. I was one of the first rogues on my server to hit 60, it's not really that special.
---
I got it off azuregos. Sold it for 1500g.
---
Lol I asked him and he said he could do that! If he didn't have to grind AV 14 hours a day
---
Pretty good wep for a warrior actually
---
Sounds like they were right.
---
Well we have instant queues cause we were farmed at every fp for weeks because of the population imbalance. Hordes shouldn't bitch about this.
---
Wait get fucked this exists?
---
If what  imagin is right that addon would be so good.
---
Like the item wheel from apex legends or the purchase wheel fron csgo.
---
haha he said the swear words very funny xDDDDDDDDDD
---
when are they going to fix the Drek exploit?
---
If you though this was rare or even uncommon then I have some bad news for you.  American companies only care about shareholder profits.  This is not a case study, it's the whole damn market.
---
&gt;  There‚Äôs a reply button under their comment. Might make sense to use that.
---
I did.
---
Then you replied to me, adding to THAT fucking chain.
---
Maybe it's you who should read ALL the conversation before butting in making a fool out of yourself.
---
Clown.
---
No it's not. It's worse than blue weapons around that level.
---
AV? Lag? spell batching? massive faction imbalance? bugs that go on for months? massive botting? should I go on???
---
It's really not atm. There are much better belts and necks that will up your damage more then banthoks or eye. 1% hit is not better then 20-33 spell damage. 1 hit and 12 spell damage is not better then 1 crit and 25 spell damage. The gear just isn't in the game to make stacking spell hit worthwhile.
---
As a level 54 Alliance player, I've been getting my ass pounded in every leveling zone at all times of day.
---
A simulation, people usually make them in spreadsheets online. Search for the priest discord
---
Servers still cost money to run in 2019 bro
---
Allright thanks again:))
---
Read back up. I replied to your comment and simply pointed out that Nelths was better than the trinket you mentioned. Replying with that note does not in any way infer I‚Äôm agreeing that it‚Äôs BiS until T5.
---
You seem super angry, which seems odd. In this case you seem to have completely misunderstood my comments. Now you‚Äôre mad. 
---
Not a great look.
---
Tbh i gees on anything shiny an gem like.
---
Someday the shiny gem will be worth more than 10s
---
As a 12 year long Horde player, these horde players in classic are on some real bullshit if they're defending the legitimacy of this.
---
Why did you do that?
---
As much as I love horde I always remember lvling there as ally (human no less! Just loved the area)
---
Spell Damage hunter :D
---
Also working with arcane shot
---
Because Quagmirron's Eye exists and both of those other trinkets are on use.
---
Been a long time since I played, still lurk wow subreddits  out of boredom, whoops
---
No
---
Are you on a losing streak?
---
There isn't "really" a curve, all the content is always going to be ran. Nothing never really gets obsolete from what I've been told.
---
You‚Äôre posting here so why not just spend $15 and find out yourself
---
15 spellpower is better than 9 hit for many classes and specs in TBC. 
---
You also are avoiding the fact that you can‚Äôt guarantee 100% uptime on the on use trinket. Which dramatically reduces its usefulness. 
---
Keep repeating yourself, while avoiding those pertinent facts. Oh, and name calling. That clearly works.
---
I‚Äôm not ‚Äúdefending blizz‚Äù you jackass, this is literally how every single online community handles bans. Look it up.
---
So wouldn't it make them more money to ban the bots frequently so they have to buy 2 or 3 subs a month?
---
We can complain about that focus all we like, but without it we wouldnt get new games. Companies profit or we get nothing
---
You are trying to talk basic common sense with racist neckbeards. It's a futile effort because you assumed they actually have any idea about how anything works outside of Azeroth.
---
Bots were a part of classic wow. #nochanges
---
I'm well aware of how the system works but it has gone on for way too long dude.
---
The only thing funny about this is how you wasted 250g to post this pic to a Reddit forum
---
Kappa
---
Oh, I get our what our issue is... I should have said prebis, not BiS. My bad on that... yes there are pieces from the raids without hit that are better than the dungeon pieces with hit
---
It doesn't say soulbound when you inspect other peoples items. Only the items that are bound to you read soulbound.
---
Sorry, Ion Hazzikostas stopped replaying to my DMs.
---
No.
---
There's nothing wrong with having scheduled hobbies/activities with mates.
---
tldr: if you can't sit down for a few minutes(takes nowhere near 30 mins to read this post or any of the relevant info) to read about your class and mechanics, and demand a tldr, you probably aren't really at a competitive level where 90% of the info matters anyway.
---
Good point. I concur
---
1 Frost mage renders this useless.
---
Join the blaumuex discord and watch all the videos yourself.
---
I'm currently level 55 in classic been playing for a couple months. I personally think its a blast. It is much more social as you have to rely on yourself to speak up in chat and find groups for things. The game itself. I think is quite a bit harder as well which is nice. Lots of walking and discovering the map and seeing the little cool things Blizzard put into classic back then. I think you should try it! I'm alliance on kurinaxx server it's PvP hit me up if you join!
---
church
---
And doesn't the mouse pointer have to be over the weapon and not the tool tip for an inspect? Guy probably clicked a link in chat for it.
---
The first few days after BG release was immensely peaceful. However now that some people are done with rep grind and Horde queue times have risen, some have gone back to high-level zones to gank inbetween queues. More lower level players also seem a lot more trigger happy than phase 1, since a lot of these are alts made by people who no longer need to rush to lvl60.
---
DM:E jump runs, farming SM Cath, using your professions.
---
That hasn't been my experience.
---
Swing and a miss
---
nah, one mage is usually pretty managable, its when its 4-5 ish that they become a pain.
---
If there is just one mage, he can just be silencer/stunned or just die in 2 seconds.
---
Exaxtly 40 men rush to drek and when it fails everyone tilts and no one recalls to defend.
---
Oh gee guys who do we lose 90% of our games i wonder golly gee willicker...
---
Maybe if you played the game
---
Then why do people bitch about companies putting shareholder profits before the quality of the game?  Under what systems does the quality of the game matter more than the profits of some already incredibly rich cunts?  Clearly it isn't this one.
---
Would look better with the glow effect turned off imo
---
Define scammer a bit more, but they will tend to be low priority.
---
Version 1.5 of AV was great.  Even the later version they are using for Revenge of Korrak was OK.   But 1.12 classic pretty much sucks for obvious reasons.   Their ultimate answer was to add the resources bandaid to the AV which they broke, then change the way honor worked.
---
I play warlock and have about twice as many elixirs, but I do need to get my mana pots up to 150+.
---
If you wanna flex, start stocking up on flasks. I have 25 right now, and if nothing else : it serves as a good way to invest gold. And it is BY FAR the most you can improve your character.
---
I disagree about playing an alliance warlock. I originally rolled a gnome warlock and was never able to win if i wasn't playing purely 1v1's against undead. Sure i could make them break WOTF early and wait 5 seconds then use my cc abilities after it finishes but there will always be another undead player nearby ready to gank you.  You won't be able to handle more than 1 player at a time because of WOTF, unless u have your engineering items off cooldown and even then you will have trouble.
---
Compare this to a horde warlock who can use 2 forms of Fear (howl of terror and normal fear) and succubus charm to CC multiple players at the same time. This is the reason all warlock pvp videos are from horde players and this is the reason I rerolled as a UD warlock. It is literally easy mode compared to alliance. 
---
 Yes i do miss blessing of salvation for pve but PVP is more important to me.
---
There is a difference between auto-banning bots through elaborate detection algorithms and immediately banning a bot that has been reported several times.
---
Unless you don't want to tip the botmakers off that their bots behave like ... bots.
---
I mean sure, but if it's a bot that has been massively reported by a lot of people then it should still get banned. It wasn't blizzard finding out it's a bot, it's every player that reported him.
---
Other people items that are BoE and equipped show as BoE still (same for BoP) 
---
Only yours show as Soulbound once equipped. 
---
Have y‚Äôall not inspected another player?
---
curiously I want to know you would call it, cleaning it
---

---
Darkmoon Faire Tickets. Are the hand-in quests repeatable like it says on wowhead*, or are they limited to a fixed amount every month?
---
I can't find this information anywhere. Some people seem to say 281 tickets per month is the theoretical max, others say you can basically hand in the quest 100 times and get the tickets all at once. Any vanilla players around who can confirm either?
---

Our Guild Master looted it off Balinda in AV - Sold for over 1k üòÇ
---
Imagine playing hunter.
---
&gt;nooooo he's having fun because he's so bad you can't be having fun because you're trying to be good!
---
C O P E
---
Idk what server you‚Äôre on but all the people I‚Äôve seen farming lotus were actually people. Communicating in game or via discord to talk shit is fun vs other lotus farmers
---
So its bad when we do but ok when you do it?
---
LOL
---
Pretty sure the mouse pointer is hidden on screen shot.
---
Dont bother with this.  Every post worth a god damn has idiots shouting that it's faked.
---
Yes
---
Nasty Raptor Strikes at lvl 35...
---
You are aware 99% of bot accounts are stolen right?  They do it in ban waves to make it harder for the voters to figure out how they got caught.  The income from betting accounts doesn't add up to much.
---
Who‚Äôs got an AV bot for me?
---
I love this dude complaining that this game costs money when he has definitely put 500+ hours into the game already
---
Yeah GL soloing the instance when you are the same level as the mobs. When running lowbies you get more xp for the people being carried as the average level is brought  down by them. This gives you more XP.
---
You can see the outline on the Staff of Jordan icon on his character sheet. This screenshot is legit haha.
---
Thank you
---
Ut tldr is longer than the post itself :D
---
This this this this this this this this this this this this this this this this
---
It will just agro to the first mob it sees, die then when the program can't find the corpse spirit rex and wait out the rez sickness.  This isnt hard to program.
---
The guy is most likely going spellpower/tank hunter, basically you stack the shit out of int/spirit/spellpower and spam mend pet on your pet, this allows hunters to tank dungeons with just their pet and makes solo leveling in the world a fun and different experience, spellpower actually scales with a ton of different hunter abilities.
---
Exploit?
---
Pretty cocky for a guy who's wrong. Despite what the tooltip in defense says, crushing blows aren't affected after 300 defense. The only way to get rid of crushing blows is with shield block or avoidance.
---
Blizzard likes to do ban waves. I expect they'll be somewhat soon
---
I know why paladins want crit, I main one, however its still more valuable to the raid on a mage or a warlock, especially as paladins will remain far from struggling for mana until AQ40 progression, by which point they should be using Lok'amir anyway.
---
He's wrong.
---
Does that help his arcane shot tho
---
Ayeeeee let's queue up for another AV while we complain there's so little to do, but who gives a shit? We're the best players in this *15 year old game*
---
R1 Blizzard with slow targeting the jump area makes it impossible to get up. There's no good way to LoS. Bring a 2nd mage to cover both spots. By the time Horde sends stealthers Drek is dead.
---
Factorio is another huge subreddit that has not lost its kindness
---
It was very vague prior to this, with different mods enforcing it in different ways, hence the post asking them to clarify/update the rule.
---
I'M HAVING FUN BEING BAD AT A 15 YEAR OLD GAME
---
While I agree - WoW is NOT my priority, BUT if I say that I will be raiding - I am going to be there unless something unexpected comes up. My raid times are Thursdays and Mondays from 8.30PM every week - I could be playing football, working during these hours it really doesn't matter but its not hard to work around.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I'm one of the tanks though, so I legitimately feel like i'm letting a lot of people down by not being there. a PuG tank  just means extra time spent explaining / looking for him.
---
we've had the system for almost 2 months, afks and bots only became a problem when they added battlegrounds.  the problem is not the system
---
You go back to Pserver, done.
---
Yeah
---
Most people are going to hand wave an answer. Just throw it in the dps warrior spreadsheet and see for yourself. It's not a big difference.
---
Why post it here? Post it on their Twitter / Facebook/official forum? We all know what's happening but what can we do about it? There is literally no GM working on classic.
---
I made a ticket for someone exploiting in wpvp back in p2 release and got 17 days expected answer time.
---
if he gets too close or too far he'll come all the way up to the pillar. the safest way is to juggle him back and forth really quickly about midway up the ledge
---
I wish the no changes crowd would‚Äôve shut the fuk up and admitted that we should‚Äôve had some changes. Vanilla did a lot of things right (though tbh the things like the community could‚Äôve always been there, gamers just fucking suck as people now), but challenge wasn‚Äôt one of them.
---
Yep, a few months into the game and literally everyone is max level
---
Nice tabard too
---
The problem is absolutely the system, it only wasn't a problem initially because we temporarily had world pvp being important. That was a short period and won't be returning.
---
But also surely she knows what nights are raiding nights. Two nights a week is nothing.
---
I used to get ganked almost on spawn. Now I get ganked every 5 minutes. It's much better than it was, but still very difficult to quest as the smaller faction on 80/20 servers. I recommend dungeons for leveling.
---
Ty.. hey someone is doing what they want with THEIR gold.. can we ban them?..  fuck off ya wankers
---
I doubt a bot would equip it. They're botting to make gold.
---
Absolutely, yes. It has nothing to do with skill, it encourages really unhealthy play patterns, better alternatives like ranked battlegrounds already exist and even the vanilla devs couldn't wait to get rid of it. It was by far the worst aspect of vanilla and has literally zero positive aspects to it.
---
&gt;I'm not mad about it cause i finally got to watch the hobbit but I'm so confused about how he does this and twitch doesn't seem to care
---
Twitch actually let people stream various things on the Artifact section when the game was pretty much dead from a streaming perspective for several days before they took action against those people. Those things include "legally borrowed" movies, porn, and even a certain mass shooting incident, which lead to Twitch finally taking action.
---
Other than sheep's in some packs what mechanics are hard as 3?
---
If uve just hit 60, you wont br doing much raiding or even acquiring new gear unless ure licky enough to get invited to a guild with raid farm and its members having all gear, most likely sou wont even have time to dedicate yourself enough to be in almost every raid in specific hour every week
---
the system is fine.  battlegrounds are the problem, world pvp was the best thing this game ever had
---
It's kind of pointless to get good at this game. I mean MC was cleared by a bunch of characters who weren't even level 60. Plus there are tons of people who played private servers for years and perfect it. I have no idea how high the skill cap is in classic WoW, but I'm enjoying it on my own pace. It's just funny to me that I had 2 other friends who rushed through the game, were laughing at my process only to complain there is nothing to do and quit after they levelled up their second character to 60.
---
I'm really not a fan of BiS guides, because they aren't even required to play this game. The way I emphasise 15 year old game, was because followingva BiS guide on gear and talents on classic WoW is like using a rocket to traverse a cliff instead of a dirt or mountain bike.
---
I'm not saying it's bad to use guides, but the way people try to maximise everything in the most efficient way just takes the soul out of this game. Mages AOE farming comes to my mind. The game is just beautiful on its own, but the gaming community in general has evolved.
---
I know, right? Lol. Post gets 400 fucking upvotes and it's just spewing blatantly wrong shit
---
Yes that‚Äôs how it works.
---
Why don‚Äôt you go to Israel and tell them to be nicer to Palestinians and so on.
---
Spell power scales with arcane shot and serpent sting for hunter. These are the two most commonly used abilities while leveling. It will also scale with mend pet which is another important spell.
---
well in 1 way he is right and i belive everyonr knows it. Ranking is sadly nothing about skill and all about time investment.
---
I bet in 2 days of work by a few people, they could ban literally 90% of the bots out there, and improve the quality of their game for a month or two before it became [slightly] harder to detect bots - why wouldn't they do that?  They don't care, or don't want to.  The reasoning behind that is lost to me, but I've moved on anyways, POE is pretty nice.
---
Well, they aren‚Äôt wrong about that. People who support the Hong Kong protesters should stfu.
---
What? It's 3.70 speed, that's almost the slowest out. If you consider the fact that WW axe is BiS for many levels and this has both higher DPS and higher damage per swing, this is pretty decent.
---
Well just watched like literally any youtube videos talking about it, listened to any content creators, read any reddit discussion, [battle.net](https://battle.net) threads, you name it.
---
Information is so easily available now that if this really is a shock to you now as you're just hitting 60.. yeah it's on you.
---
It will get harder for sure, especially at AQ 40. The first tier is really the joke one.
---
Idk man, I'm currently between jobs and stopped at rank 7 cause consistently hitting the honor required for bracket 10/11 would require spamming AV 10-12 hours a day minimum. Might be easier on other servers, though.
---
I'm sure some have, but if there aren't enough reports on a name it doesn't generate a ticket. I was a GM for 8 years. A name like pissmop would be changed once a GM received the ticket on it. (not saying there weren't shit GMs, but name change tickets were so easy) They could have changed the system around in the 5 years since I worked there, but if a GM actually got the ticket it'd be changed.
---
Funny enough there were people and guilds that would spam name change reports knowing it would generate a ticket to a GM to try to get their buddy a free name change. We didn't change those, unless they happened to also violate the naming policy.
---
But don't you need to win a lot in order to be the most honor efficient?
---
So you have to play a lot and win a lot.
---
You're wasting your time discussing this with them. The people still mad about P2 and saying horde deserve this have a poor ability to self reflect and won't ever think they are wrong.
---
That makes a better story, so yes.
---
I played both. 
---
A funny thing about these two games is that, back in the day, Guild Wars was seen as the game with the better graphics. 
---
Nowadays I think Guild Wars is the ugly one when I look at that video. Haha. I guess WoW's graphics just aged better?
---
fist off all hello
---
mostly what horde does is galv etc true and fact why is that its because alliance premades do most bgs in 8 min if we as horde slow u guys down at galv with say 15 people gives us the chance as horde to get some bunker etc if the game finishes to fast we lose out on the honor if we slow u guys down to lets say 15 min bgs
---
gives us more honor for the que time
---
Yeah because that's working out amazingly so far.
---
amen
---
Nice try, just admit you're actually the dumbass here for not recognizing an obscure but viable leveling build despite acting like some WoW genius. Little humility goes a long way
---
Not like it matters. The good premades already moved on from doing the 1 warmaster drek pull and is now doing mage pulling all warmasters and kiting until drekk dies because it's more consistent and random horde shitters can't fuck it up with snowballs
---
Cool so it shouldn't actually matter if you can down Kel'Thuzad or not, what you should *actually* get drops for is sitting in Naxxramas 16 hours a day.
---
The bot I reported a few weeks ago hasn't been online for a week. So maybe?
---
Can attest. Ally FPs are being camped again. I‚Äôve given up on ranking since I don‚Äôt like AV spam. Every time I see a FP Camper I add him to my my KOS list and camp them for as long as I want/can just so that &lt;60s can travel safely.
---
Who the fuck uses that backdoor? The other 2 back doors are easier and safer.
---
y-you're right, you got me! anytime someone is being bad they're actually playing 4D WoW chess!
---
I mean sure but in those 30 runs I got everything else I wanted. Enough skins for two +8 enchants and full Necrophile. The hard stuff to get is Witchblade and Bonecreeper. Unless you're farming Dark Runes/Rep then I'd rather just farm Skul and be done with it since its far less RNG to deal with knowing how to find him.

Before paid xfers on felstriker oceanic:
---
3-5 lvl 60's in UC around peak time,
---
1 alliance rogue in kargath made it a no go zone.
---
I really hope he got that off the ah or something. Just imagine a fucking hunter needing that over a mage and winning
---
Of course you can change core aspects, there are huge improvements that can be made.
---
Yeah Blizzard fucked a lot up on their part, no denying that.
---
how can you view your hitchance etc?.
---
The problem is the version of AV they've implemented being an honour bomb, if the real honour was to be had in WSG and AB there wouldn't be nearly as big of an issue. Premades would rule the honour game and afk  players / bots in random queues  would be removed. There is literally no reason AV should harbour so much raw honour and changing it would effect nothing because honour gained is relative to the rest of your particular server.
---
Full honesty someone was leveling their war up and let me tag along for about twenty runs. Most amazing thing I've ever seen. He (mage 60) did the entire thing by agro the place in three levels and finishing them off. He's a God lol. I won't go into details but my God so cool to watch a master.
---
Probably could've sold it and used the gold to buy a stronger weapon? That scales with all their ranged attacks.
---
with x realm bgs ranks should also be x realm
---
How much?
---
Leatherworking was NOT required by everyone in TBC. That is total bullsh@#%. Even in Sunwell. You did have some cancer though. Example Mages got sat and most rerolled warlocks who could outdps them in some tailoring sets with some random epics. Then mages were god mode at WOTLK release with arcane clownstomping everyone. Heck you could solo the Military Wing in Naxx with an absurd talent that gave spellpower based on dmg taken. You spell stole the shield from the DK's on the horses. I took a temp ban for it because I told too many people about it.
---
Anyways go back to watching Toweliee and thinking he's accomplished when he does content months after it's cleared by real guilds, using their strats, and playing the easiest spec/class in the raid because he would get kicked if he had to play a healer or soaker/melee dps outside something like a fury warrior. The WORST player in the raid now is the tank because threat means nothing and they are the most forgiving when you screw up.
---
Have him or that clown who makes raid guides with the lisp play something like a windwalker monk and see how fast they get gkicked while playing anonymously when they can't faceroll ranged or a tank, while carried by people who want to get in good with ecelebs lol. 
---
Towelliee has the reflexes of a sloth.
---
An hour 45 clear of mc is a whole night faster than middle of the road guilds in 2006.
---
Reroll on a PVE server.
---
&gt;brought back the world's stupidest ranking system
---
well yes...  that's why they completely scrapped it in TBC... but this is classic.
---
You‚Äôre not wrong.
---
example of death roll:  
---
Player 1 bets 5000gold and /roll  5000 and he gets 4234  
---
Player 2 now goes /roll 4234 and gets 2903  
---
Player 1 now /roll 2903 and gets 3  
---
Player 2 now /roll 3 and gets a 1 and loses the bet
---
Is this set good when u do the quests to upgrade it?
---
It's not very hard to program a script in a very known keyboard automation software to randomize how often to press "Space".
---
It will look exactly like someone setting a timer for 9 minutes and pressing space.
---
[Why, yes.... How did you...? Yes, I do play a hunter and, yes - I *do* have the Staff of Jordan equipped. How in the world... how could you tell? What gave it away?](https://i.imgur.com/kwZI6FF.png)
---
why is it in their best interest? it costs time and resources to ban bots, and they also lose the sub money they bring in when they do. unless more people unsubscribe as a result of bitting than they gain in subscriptions from bots then they won't ever care.
---
Faaaaaat! 
---
Gratz bro
---
it was sooo good, we actually saw a complete mass-exodus of alliance out of a server since horde made it unplayable 24/7.
---
couple more week of P2 and maybe we would've seen the same thing happen on stalagg or such server...
---
What was the private server that allowed people to queue from anywhere in the world? and in 2 month or so there were no alliance left?
---
Probably yes and probably no. This is what they wanted to do, this is what they did. What‚Äôs it to you?
---
I see the wowhead comment, you might be right on that. It's still not worth equipping over other trinkets.
---
Don't forget to mention that you also ignored the substance of what he wrote but didn't forget to be passive aggressive.
---
Basically yeah. I have played the free one up to the level cap but that has been it. My wife has health issues and isn't working and my bankruptcy just went through. 
---
I know it may not be a lot each month but at this point in my life every dollar counts. I have 10.09 in my account until Wed and 10 of that is going to gas so i can make it to work. 
---
It has been a very brutal and eye opening Year to say the least.
---
BWL is going to be a cake walk also. AQ40 will be the first raid not cleared in the first night by guilds not ultra dedicated.
---
Share more info, what zones have you tried, is it the same hanker every time, are they 60 etc
---
If you‚Äôre trying to level in 1k needles being ganked by 60s that‚Äôs different than hillsbrad being ganked by lvl 35‚Äôs
---
(Hillsbrad is a lower lvl horde zone than alliance for some odd reason so if it‚Äôs unplayable for you I would do 1k needles)
---
If there were ever a change to be made to vanilla the honor system would be #1 on the chopping block. but the neckbeards and gigavirgins would ree about changes so we get this.
---
As someone who regularly does premades, I'd like it too - because then the ranking players would largely shift to premade WSG groups, rather than spamming AV (and thereby forcing everyone else who wants to rank to do the same).
---
Most of us aren't doing AV premades because we -like- it. It's because it's the highest/fastest honor gain and we need to stay competitive.
---
Is that for real? Are there any videos or such showing you can actually do that?
---
You might consider spamming AV for rep once you are high enough. Once you get faction exalted + pvp rank 3 the ram mount will only cost 640g. Of course if you don‚Äôt like the ram mount less useful, but the rank 3 will give you 10% discount for your horse still so worth it.
---
Way too late for that one.
---
Not sure what you saw but I've seen tons of multi-boxing hunters, where many are AFK and 1 is not... I dont think this is against the rules because someone is controlling all of them. Botting allows a player to walk away from the computer and it continues to play.
---
Damn I'm sorry to hear that. You in the U.S.?
---
Riveting gameplay by you.
---
It‚Äôs free that‚Äôs why. If there was a trinket that gave 1g every 30 mins sure it‚Äôs trivial but why wouldn‚Äôt you use it on cd?
---
If you have plenty of shards normally this is icing
---
You seriously can't afford the subscription?
---
...but its free. Spam away!
---
Absolutely. Which is why I'm always confused when people complain that they were told that MC, BWL or ZG would be difficult, people hyping them up, I suppose.
---
Thank you. And yep.
---
World of be nicer to the enemy craft
---
You seem to be confused as if the higher ups of blizzard haven‚Äôt adopted the activision culture. Since they have, its fair to say blizzard 
---
I have friends at blizzard who have been there over a decade, J Allen is just Bobby Kotick with a pony tail.
---
Would you play if you had the money? Or you got priorities?
---
"perfectly" no, but you do need to HS toggle with 6% hit. If you arent capable of that then aim for more hit%
---
Fun is subjective.
---
Yes, MOTHER.
---
We're in a thread that proves he's botting AV.  The other stuff is irrelevant anyways.  He is a scumbag for cheating and should be banned.
---
Unfortunately no. Not at this time in my life. I have to ration what i have for needs not wants anymore.
---
Sad but true.
---
Slight OT: friend of mine got an email from Blizzard the other day, and the English was so bad I thought it was written by scammers.
---
I remember back in vanilla days when I was 15 and my dream was to move to Paris and become a GM, now it‚Äôs all outsourced to India it seems
---
Yea I was really looking forward to wsg with friends. Instead I spend all my time with people off server stuck eternally in AV.
---
Honestly world pvp grinding was better than this.
---
FWIW finding a good, active guild to chat with and occasionally do dungeons with makes it 10 times better. Classic really is a game meant to be played socially, unlike retail right now.
---
I still have no clue how reliable warlock DPS will actually get in later phases with stuff such as bloodvine. Coincidentally made [this](https://youtu.be/ZEI6S_zzAu0?t=111)  yesterday after we did a meme run of onyxia with the boys because of how dumb the resists were.
---
This is all really helpful by the way, thank you.
---
We moved our raid from Tues to Thurs . Had 39 people on 
---
Many people playing
---
He needs it for his healing set.
---
Xrealm obliterated my servers pvp community.
---
On my server (Dragon's Call) they go for 150g on Alliance side
---
I can‚Äôt tell if this is a joke and that‚Äôs why I like classic. I want this to be real
---
TBC private servers and WotLK to a lesser extent are usually worse off in design compared to the vanilla servers. Not as much 1 to 1 or rather the illusion of it. Nost and the servers after it were really a marvel in just how well they approximated the concepts of vanilla with mostly just guess work and old videos to go off of.
---
This is how i played hunter on other "servers". You can use pet to tank most anything. Hell you can solo just about everything. Come in handy doing solo princess runs. Especially vs rotgrip with that nasty bleed stack. I carried a set of healing gear for any elites, dungeons i wanted or needed to do. As long as you can get mend pet ticks higher then incoming damage your pretty much set.
---
because of av...
---
What‚Äôs the add on you are using to see enemy team?
---
Most definitely and it would be classic all the way. My wife, work, and getting this bankruptcy behind me are my priorities at the moment. I work night shift so I usually unwind when I get home with video games or books.
---
Upvoted because of reverse psychology
---
Lol. 
---
DO YOUR HOMEWORK! YOU'RE GROUNDED!!!
---
Well, by BWL, every piece of raid gear had some form of spellpower on it.
---
&gt; Leatherworking was NOT required by everyone in TBC
---
Who said everyone?
---
Where's your achievements link?
---
PM if you think you can swing it, I'll PayPal you $30 so you can have two months paid for.
---
&gt; Honestly world pvp grinding was better than this.
---
yep. now have fun doing pve to rank 14.. because blizzard fucked up.
---
A lot of the ‚Äúhigher ups‚Äù and CM‚Äôs from the time period we actually liked wow have left the company. Every company will of course always have a few sell outs.
---
Every shard is free. This analogy makes no sense.
---
so....
---
the worst of the worst server ( horde side). a fringe case like flamelash alliance...
---
can we look at the big picture here?
---
Or stop posting as blizzard bans in waves and probably have most of them flagged already?
---
Aside from the first few days, I've seen -very- few wins on pure pugs in AV. I see far more wins than losses with premades, however.
---
I hope they don't ban you though :(
---
Depends on your build. 
---
So assuming you are either already 5% for pvp, or 9% for over. When you are a dagger build with backstab, you‚Äôll want the crit with atk power, but let‚Äôs say if you are combat swords with pve or hemo/cb with swords, I would probably take the 2% hit still, considering your glancing blows will hit harder, and eviscerate does not scale with stats.
---
Operating one would be in the majority of countries because of intellectual property laws, playing one however (which is what Xanthami said) is not illegal at all.
---
Even in between BG queues for a free soul shard while waiting for your queue?
---
It‚Äôs wild to me your adamant that all the rewards are useless when one of them prints soul shards during any 20s downtime you have, but you have proven your point: it‚Äôs useless to argue this (with you)
---
And so I bid adieu, maybe I‚Äôll see you in Azeroth someday
---
Pally is mostly just waiting for a swing timer. It picks up around 40 and is never as painful as early warrior leveling, but to me they are the most boring class to level. A level 60 Paladin is tons of fun though.
---
When I was leveling in searing gorge I was almost exclusively ganked by MC geared warriors.
---
Hey your point about not being able to teamkill lowbies, I know a way around it. I don't want blizz catering to crybabies so pm me if anyone wants a guide on teamkilling from the #1 teamkiller horde (and most likely both factions) on fairbanks. I average 1.5 or so teamkills per infernal sometimes get 0 sometimes up to 5 it is amazing and fun af people really get freaked out when you can kill them XD
---
Time is money friend
---
Yea I‚Äôm already wanting to pull my hair out.
---
It's fine to jump in.  Might take a little longer to find groups for leveling content, but still very possible.  Just join the lookingforgroup channel.
---
I mail any tank that doesn‚Äôt charge me for a run 5-10 greater rage pots after a run, depending on how many I have and how good/chill they were. That‚Äôs anywhere from 7.5 - 20g on my server.
---
I appreciate tanks, don‚Äôt care if they want an orb on Rez or a couple extra greens or whatever. Don‚Äôt charge them for ports or food out in the world. 
---
Some let it go to their fucking heads though, reserving all orbs and or greens and or boe blues, etc... nope.
---
Getting geared ez vrs ez money grind is the trade off from dps and tanks. Tanks get the short end to some extent so I don‚Äôt mind helping balance things out, but some get super entitled. Most are fine though, even if asking to get their beaks wet a little.
---
Its not worth 15 bucks a month honestly. Id say its worth only about 5 per month giving you only classic access.
---
"You think you do, but you dont"
---
I'm just gonna start botting. Whatever
---
I started playing in Dec 2005. There was no av honor farm like we know today. I remember logging on before school and joining an AV match, with a stalemate at the DB bridge. After school I logged on and joined the exact same match, with no progress made. I remember an AV weekend match that went 48 hours. The rushing meta did not exist nor was it really feasible back then
---
Shhhhh you're making too much sense haha. The Thought Police will come for you!
---
Eviscerate scales a little with atk power in classic iirc
---
I do agree with all what your saying. but in same time you can afk in av and get r10, and guy who have real skill and have been to in multiple arena tournaments, but who dont play that much anymore coz of RL, who still destroys everyone can be rank 3.  What im trying to say is, Yes skill is factor in pvp. but its not in ranking
---
I see.
---
Breaking into a tanking role as a transfer is a daunting task. Good luck friend!
---
honestly even the biggest group of noobs can trial and error kt and defeat him if they play 16hours a day. Raiding is a time investment, but it's the only thing in the game that actually has a small skill requirement to actually complete without sheer time investment. If anything should be changed for more consistency then raids is where those changes should be, not the ranking system.
---
It's just a gambling game. You bet someone a certain amount of gold and then /roll [number]. The next person does /roll [number last person rolled] and so on until someone reaches 1 and loses. Most people on my server just start from 9999 no matter what, I know some others start with the amount of gold bet.
---
Example:
---
P1: /roll 9999
---
&lt;Rolls 1252&gt;
---
P2: /roll 1252
---
&lt;Rolls a 9&gt;
---
P1: /roll 9
---
&lt;Rolls a 1&gt;
---
P1 loses and pays P2
---
This is how i played hunter on other "servers". You can use pet to tank most anything. Hell you can solo just about everything. Come in handy doing solo princess runs. Especially vs rotgrip with that nasty bleed stack. I carried a set of healing gear for any elites, dungeons i wanted or needed to do. I know it came in handy the most doing the elite quests in dustwallow marsh or w/e with those effing dragons. As long as you can get mend pet ticks higher then incoming damage your pretty much set. The kill time is not slow either.
---
I tried to solo run BRD arena multiple times but my gear wasnt all that great and i always came so close but could never quite do it. Probably can be done with better gear / raid gear.
---
???
---
I know you got downvoted but I agree
---
It does, even the tooltip says so.
---
I'm sorry, I can't hear you over the sound of the 14.5$ million that blizzard won when suing bot creators. I never knew cash made that much sound.
---
No, but you should stack other +SP thats available, which is what I assumed one would do in this case. Arcane shot is 43.5% coeffeicent scaling. Reasonably be able to get to 100 SP by 39 with +60 from enchants. Bot much difference between cloth and leather at that range and nothing +stam or health enchanta cant fix with some proper twinking.
---
There was a video from one of the rogue youtubers that 1% hit is kinda equal 15 AP IIRC. I‚Äôd recommend searching a bit for it and also trying different combos.
---
What talents do you use for that? Do you rely solely on the pet for damage?
---
yes
---
I literally just explained how its a factor in pvp. 
---
Does that mean you get free rank 10-14 just because you are good? No. But it helps, it makes things faster. Just like leveling, doing a dungeon, farming reputation etc. Everything is a grind where time investment is the main factor, but skill does help shorten things.
---
Currently Blizzard is more of a publisher than a developers who plays and loves wow. And if ever Classic+ comes out it would be Chinese friendly (wink wink)
---
There are definitely horde ganking in WPL while they wait for AV, but not nearly in the numbers before.
---
Phasing but only once and exclusively for bots. Be detected bottling and get phased to the bot server
---
I like the system. I love grindy games. Ofc its not for everyone but there are other games for you
---
I know how to get around this very consistently I'll come up with a copy paste guide feel free to pm me for it so blizz doesnt remove for rpg haters.
---
I dont see how he could hold aggro with his pet, pet taunt doesn't even force a mob to attack, it justs add raw threat.
---
&gt;LOL at you not realizing WoW was single threaded until VERY recently.
---
I'm very familiar with that completely unrelated topic, thanks. That has nothing to do with consoles being able to handle MMOs for decades, hence why they have had MMOs for decades, which is why "consoles can't do MMOs!!1!" is entirely incorrect regarding Titan.
---
Would you care to address the holes you've dug yourself into before you dig yourself into MORE unrelated holes?
---
&gt;You rpobably don't know who he is from the community college textbook you got, but he's pretty much the rockstar of CPU design
---
That's not the sort of (completely worthless and irrelevant) information those books would contain, but thanks for confirming the obvious:you haven't read any books or gotten an education.
---
&gt;Ryzen's are great btw
---
Speaking of going back to school, Ryzen's what are great? OH you meant "Ryzens" and "CPUs" without an apostrophe, because you're such an idiot that you don't understand the very basics of English.
---
You can use /equipslot # [item] instead of just equip to work around the offhand/shield thing.
---
the thing i love the most about classic, which is wierd... is that there is no daily incentive to log in to my main, so when i log in to my main i ask myself " what do i want to do today?" rather than a forced check list
---
My first Warlock is a level 6 so thanks for this.
---
lmao
---
That‚Äôs pretty good! Sadly I haven‚Äôt gotten any, but it‚Äôs rough out there for alliance on a horde heavy realm.
---
As a healer, I always run to the tank if I get threat...but then again us healers and tanks have a different mentality than dps, in general
---
I'm more shocked that not only needed, but equipped it.
---
Reroll on a pve server, level 25 isn't that high
---
believe it or not, some people experience unforeseen expenses in their lives. Even hard working people. My dad was ready to retire 5 years ago and then his wife got cancer. Now my dad is still working still with no retirement in sight because he took all that money he was going to use to retire and invested in her care. He's worked hard his whole life and now he's almost back to the paycheck to paycheck lifestyle that most people over half his age are struggling with.
---
First thing I noticed, not sure why a priest would take that item.
---
Not sure if you‚Äôre versed in excel, but a lot of these types of questions could be answered if you just follow a few formulas in the spreadsheet. You can see how dps is calculated and how certain things are weighted. 
---
Thought, would imagine that 1% attack speed wouldn‚Äôt matter much right now for 2 minute fights
---
Got a link?
---
Str affects all attacks including INSTANT attacks, which if you're horde are very common with flurry axe / windfury. Not to mention your abilities like bloodthirst and whirlwind
---
As well as Mend Pet.
---
So you basically want gear that increases your healing, like the weapon in OP? Does this spec also work for killing mobs in the open world reasonably fast or is it only for soloing dungeons?
---
There tons guides how to swap fonts, but get suitable font is way harder, atm im using 
---
https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/montserrat for all in-game fonts and i like it.
---
He doesn't have health insurance?
---
Ayyyy sup fellow blowme player
---
These premades will kick you for doing things wrong, if avoiding mistakes aint skill then idk what to tell you man.
---
Pheasants attacking peasants?
---
classic is dead to me, i already unsubscribed
---
The other one is just how movement and jumping works. You've yet to properly explain why one is an exploit over the other.
---
Is it not an exploit to kill people in gadgetzan or Ratchet in ways that do not pull the guards? What is the difference here?
---
I would suggest an add-on like TSM. You can scan the AH and then it will tell you which pots are profitable at that time. Keep in mind it's best to learn your servers prices as well, as sometimes things can be artificially inflated. Quest items like strong troll blood potion and frost oil do quite well (frost oil is used for the nifty stopwatch quest line and also for dm trib runs). Fire pots also do well just based on all the fire damage in MC and Ony
---
You will only want to wear the healing gear when you come across something you cant seem to solo. So yea mostly dungeons, elites, follow quests.
---
For me, in wow skill is adopting to situation. But really man. do you think that if you have half decent brain you cant be in very good premade ?
---
I rolled a 1 on a /roll 25 for 200g. Felt pretty bad
---
That's like saying you can't ever have anything scheduled that isn't with your partner. What? Lmao
---
sweet summer child. The healthcare system in the US is fucked. And of course he does.
---
&gt;and I realized as they were coming out of my mouth that those words were not acceptable.
---
They are, and she'd be a cunt not to accept them.
---
For my matches, Horde win nearly every single one of them. Doubtful we're always up against so many premade Horde groups as a pug, but either way, it seems like they've adjusted their game and finally take advantage of the same terrain advantages Horde has always had because wanting to be a victim has always been the go-to for AV as Horde. There's a reason why the good old Rath Strat always involved a nearly impenetrable defense at Galv and IBT/GY chokepoint.
---
Full AP hunter.
---
I mean, they have feathers - and if you are removing the feathers then you're plucking them....
---
We had flat video proof on my server of a guy botting, he got banned for 10 days and people still defended him.
---
The amount of mental gymnastics people go to defend people on this game is incredible.
---
Some trash after Vael for sure, can‚Äôt remember if there is anything to banish deeper, will have to watch a warlock run soon to remind myself what happens :P
---
I think that *is* the joke.
---
I don't get what you don't understand about loot etiquette. It has been like this for years, if you have only ever played Wrath+ I could understand. It's just the way it works. No one player is entitled to 900g drops over the others, unless in a guild run.
---
&gt; Premades hurt alliance more than it hurts horde.
---
not when all you do is premades back to back.  95% winrate or better, easymode.
---
Prob not
---
Why the heck are you wearing the T1 Robe? Its garbage!
---
Are you really comparing AV premade groups to pugs in terms of who wins more? That's like saying during the Rath Strat days, you're openly agreeing that Horde win nearly 100% of all AV matches.
---
Jeez man relax. I'm just saying they could spot him some help not buy everything for him. Raid teams have tons of excess money. Some boes sell for almost 1k sometimes.
---
Solid work dude.
---
And Volley, Damaging traps.
---
Grats on dying to trash from pulling aggro now!
---
This dude was talking about Staff of Jordan lmao
---
You could probably just tag along with a guildie farming marudon for gold and get gatorbite axe.
---
Right? Found the mainlander LOL
---
What macros do you use?
---
And the damaging traps and Volley.
---
I guess the real question is why the duck would any alliance play non-premier AV
---
how does this one work
---
&gt; *Warlock dps is bad (in early phases), because lack of spell hit.* 
---
A lot of people are comparing lock vs mages, but from my experience warlocks beat mages in DPS in general.  
---
Keep in mind that you need to proper stat priority.  
---
Only think you care about is usually + Shadow spell power.  
---
btw 1% Crit &gt; 1% Hit
---
I was doind some testing and 1% hit on 430 SP(it scales with spell power) is equal to only 12,5 SP.   
---
1% crit was around 14,5 SP. So keep that in mind when you chose your gear.
---
So basically:  
---
\+ 15 shadow damage &gt; 1% crit &gt; 1% hit &gt; + 12 spell power
---
Tanking dungeons is about 90% managing your dps.  Use a keybind to set a skull marker for every pull and focus building threat on that mob
---
Not sure if it is server or account level (I‚Äôd guess server) but the limit of 5 is shared across multiple characters on the same server
---
Amazing.
---
Its called retail...
---
Literally not even a joke if you want a polished game with fair systems go to retail.
---
Classic wow was brought back for a reason...
---
Enchanting mats are a good business
---
Actually this one is by far easier and arguably safer if your intent is the bunker. You're out of LoS of the archers and you're right up to the side of the bunker, which you can just hop on the partition and right into the door. For ASGY, you use the other few cliff exploits that are stupidly easy to do. It's pretty crazy how simple it should be for Horde to win these games. In my experience, it's an issue with players being bad if Horde are losing.
---
Looks like they made a bet for 50g, and did a basic "/roll for first" to see who would /roll 500 first. Froze won, but ended up roll a 1 with a /roll 500
---
You know there is an alliance skip as well right?  It is easy as fuck and drops you directly at the RH.
---
Kek
---
Well serpent sting, mend pet, and wyvern sting all scale 100% with spellpower.
---
Arcane shot scales 30% I think for an instant cast arcane damage every 6 (5 if talented) seconds. 
---
I have a build I'm planning to try later... though I would probably just use Shaman gear that no one needs aside from the occasional desperate pally.
---
he came into the staff of Jordan thread, made a post about the Warden staff, and is now going to argue with someone he understandably confused lol
---
They roll to see who goes first out of 100. Then he rolled a 1 on / roll 500
---
They roll out of 100 to see who goes first. Then he rolled a 1 on / roll 500
---
1% hit is huge for warlocks...
---
Undead is best cause of RP and class fantasy. I guess dOrc is okay if you like stinky greenskins though...
---
&gt;TOEP is better off being warlock priority since mages will soon have access to Mind Quickening Gem, while warlocks will not gain another option until ZG.
---
The trinkets have a shared **10 second cooldown**. In no way does a Mind Quickening Gem make a TOEP obsolete.
---
100% bugged - death ray is not supposed to do damage to a paladin that‚Äôs bubbled while casting it.  It‚Äôs one of the main reasons it rocks for paladins.
---
I use death ray all the time in my pally and it just spams ‚Äúimmune‚Äù msgs while you channel it - dunno wtf happened here.
---
so does the spellpower help mend pet?
---
Blizzard does not run this sub, nor /r/wow.
---
I have a token on retail you can have for an extra month just DM me
---
Sounds like the start of a B horror film.
---
Nobody said it was a great idea
---
As a horde player, it's less likey I chase you down and camp you if you're human. Play gnome if you want to be forced to git gud
---
use an owl, they hold AOE threat pretty well
---
Wolf howl is where it‚Äôs at
---
Damn that kills my farm starts. Oh well.
---
([From the guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/byqrai/meme_spec_guide_spellpower_melee_hunter/))
---
\- Arcane shot (42.85% scaling)
---
\- Serpent \[And Wyvern\] sting (100% scaling over full duration)
---
\- Volley (33% scaling)
---
Traps don't have scaling, unfortunately.
---
And that increased mend pet healing.
---
Use the spreadsheet in the rogue discord. It's hard to say because your stat weights change pretty strongly based on the rest of your gear. Also, especially if you're daggers, crit cap can be pretty easy to hit fully buffed so you'll want even more hit. But again, this is why you use the spreadsheet.
---
when does people get its nothing about whining about a 15 year old game, its about blizzard making costume shit and DOSE NOT WORK. Spell batching useless and makes the game feel so bad, Leeway, wtf were they thinking about that, so buggy.
---
&gt;I would probably take the 2% hit still, considering your glancing blows will hit harder
---
Are you saying these in relation to each other? Because only weapon skill has an effect on glancing blow damage.
---
Lul
---
Geezus man, settle down.
---
Not yet, at least. Blizzard's method to banning bots is fucking stupid (banwaves). The next banwave, which I'm assuming includes both WoWs, is probably going to be 9.0. Which, to those that don't keep up with retail at all, is at least another **YEAR** out. 
---
Meaning, I could download a bot today and blatantly cheat/bot 24 hours a day/7 days a week, and sell it off for real money for several months straight (simultaneously fucking the server economy) before getting banned. Oh, I got banned? Who gives a shit? I already made more than $15, let me just buy a new account, bot all the way up to 60, and repeat the same shit! Hooray Blizzard!
---
Greens to sell in AH: Eagle, Falcon, Bear, Tiger, Monkey, Owl, Eluding, Defense and Healing.
---
Greens to vendor or DE: ‚ÄúWrath‚Äù pieces (Nature‚Äôs, Fiery, Frozen, Shadow), Boar, Whale, Gorilla, Wolf.
---
That‚Äôs a good place to start anyway.
---
It is actually true.  Horde mages are champions, they literally will run into the zerg 1v40 to nova as many as they can.  Certain death, but it is exactly what is needed to slow the alliance down and fragment them so we can pick off what we can, and it seems like 90% of alliance who die in the initial zerg just immediately give up and sit AFK at SHGY the rest of the game.
---
&gt;offhand white damage as well
---
Minor correction here, dual wield miss chance affects *both* weapons.
---
I think the player is from Europe
---
Understand, thank you!
---
Its fake.
---
seems to hold aggro more effectively than his colleagues - I lol'd, tbh I have wondered the same thing.  https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/attackspeed.php - goes into an explanation that attack speed does not affect pet dps. Slow attack pet = bigger crits though and if you are going BM thats nice. big crits are more satisfying imo
---
Same.  As shaman I got 7pc in 4 weeks, helmet took nother 4 to drop after that, but good for me that all of the other shammies are trying to minmax +healing instead of 8pc.  Took half a year to get full might AS MAINTANK in vanilla
---
Yeah, tell that to the guy who got 3 days suspension
---
I saw a paladin with earthshaker that had +55 healing on it.
---
If you get a staff of jordan drop in a dungeon, it's 99% going to be sold anyway, so I don't see anything wrong with a hunter rolling for it.

At first I thought it was just the two of you
---
I was so excited to see someone generating a story with 
---
actual in game footage (holy shit!), but it kept building,
---
more characters, more body language, and then you 
---
guys started blowing my fucking mind!
---
first of all this is next level shit starting right here
---
wave of the future type stuff
---
second of all the wow classic forums is a safe place to practice being bad for a while, till you polish your craft. (something we all need but few can find).
---
For instance: at 3:13 forward the voice actually switches which character is moving their hands while talking for about 5 seconds.  Is disorienting.
---
but the use of actual ingame mechanics to tell story just blew my mind.
---
Combat with multiple npc's followed up by 4 actual players wearing the same gear
---
respawn of mobs while yall were camping in their camp, so over her shoulder a mob just faded into camera, but framed perfectly at the edge.  Timestop 13:27 Just OMG, ingame effects like respawn being used at an academy level of cinematographers acumen.
---
==================
---
**TLDR:**  Flashes of genus, consistently funny, a few technical glitch.
---
prognosis: more! more! more! more!
---
It takes 10,000 hours to reach talent
---
Here's a video about what you realize along the way
---
[Ira Glass on The Creative Process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pFI9UuC_fc)
---
You could probably write a line of code to automate a response like that
---
What you are saying technically is not wrong.
---
Since the first attack a pet does will happen at the same time regardless of speed, it stands to reason that the initial snap aggro would be higher.
---
This is also relevant against mobs that stun, as the stun to the bear is less detrimental to its dps from auto attacks.
---
That's what you get for playing gnome
---
It was WAY slower.  Top guilds may have killed rag for the first time around when the honour system launched but the vast majority of players still hadn‚Äôt killed rag even once for a year or more after that.  It wasn‚Äôt just that no one knew what they were doing back then but also it was back when a lot of items were shitter than 1.12 and before talent reworks.  So mc was a lot harder than back then.  
---
Most people weren‚Äôt even 60 by the time honour came out and those that were didn‚Äôt have epic mounts and barely had anything near to today‚Äôs prebis.
---
The original AV was multiple hour long games with huge battles and stand offs because people didn‚Äôt know what to do and mostly had terrible gear and shitty old talent trees.  No one was getting exalted in a day, it was taking weeks if not over a month for even the most hardcore players to get that sweet exalted gear.
---
If you saw a player with an epic mount it was rare as fuck - even the av one.  It would still be rare for a long time yet.  Very few people had any raid gear at all.  Also remember UBRS was a 15 man mini-raid back then, so even those high end blue bits of gear were rather than now.
---
This is correct. All pets do the same dps regardless of their attack speed. The fast attack pets are generally better at keeping aggro because a missed hit isn't as big of an impact.
---
That said the first attack of a boar/bear after their charge is a great aggro grab at the start and even a miss or two can't cause aggro loss by the time the average mob is killed.
---
I think alliance should do something about their forced premades because it's prpbably fucking over both factions
---
I'd say 308 weapon skill instead of 310.
---
I botted on private servers and it became a sort of hobby in itself.  Most botting software does have an option to equip BoE's that are better than what's equipped however you can also make it only equip "Hunter" items as an example, or never equip epics even if they're an upgrade so they can be sold.  The one I used on private servers would mail epics and other blue BoE's to a bank alt.
---
Yes but the bot probably isn't preogrammed to realise it's received an expensive BoE as the chances are so low, so by default it equipped the item as a statistical upgrade
---
Moonfury (balance talents, +10% damage) only increases base amount.
---
My server had 5 people banned for account sharing who were all in the same guild. 10 day ban, and 10 days later they all logged in at the same time and immediately joined AV.
---
Not really, those operate by waves of 3 to 500 scripts corresponding to as many accounts  per most populated servers feeding the so called "clean gold" for brokers as advertised on gold selling websites. The cheapest gold  for low tiers  brokers comes from compromised accounts, exploits and obvious abuses, those are the first "seeds* to be flagged and eventually sanctioned by publishers. It's noteworthy to note that blizzard is nowhere near their efficiency and economy damage control as they used to 10 - 12 years ago. It seems obvious that wow tokens  solved their third part gold selling issues and that the necessary skills and knowledge has left the company (specially in North America). Source: I'm a former sales at IGE ( largest broker in third parts mmo goods) and currently running a bot farm, casually and independently, across various titles (not wow classic at the moment).
---
I go for the graveyard cap, and then gank each alliance that Recall back.
---
if this is real turnover is at an all time high or they're outsourcing
---
well a lot of people in this thread seems to applaud the hunter for... being unique.
---
I can't picture anything worse than spamming mend pet to kill stuff... and I main a holy priest who spam heal on a warrior ...
---
Lotta people here also havent seen the tier 2.5...
---
Outhealing Rotgrip lol, you could only do that on pservers.
---
Procs that trigger from being crit doesn't trigger if you are sitting down, so that wouldn't work. (It did work on private servers though)
---
That was during TBC and the guy was lvl 70. It wasn‚Äôt vanilla.
---
Was it? I remember it being vanilla. But it was also 15 years ago. I could be wrong
---
Wait, so you're saying that no matter how good your defensive advantages are (terrain and NPC placements leading to the base), Horde are objectively at a disadvantage in AV? Bias doesn't even begin to describe that perspective of yours.
---
This is not even including how wrong you are about the Alliance base. The only point you have that's correct about that is how archers will pelt you as you run across the bridge. Even the "unavoidable" NPCs are avoidable. Maybe don't just run right up to them next time if killing them is going to be an issue, kind of like how Alliance do at the front half of FW base.
---
No way this is real.  Zero chance.
---
Maybe the problem is the people who will play 18 hours a day 7 days a week. Stop chasing PvP rank. The weapons are not worth a minimum 1700 hour investment. 
---
Rank 14s will honestly just quit when they get their weapons because they'll be burned out and will realise it's not fun to hit an NPC every 9 minutes that they already spent nearly 2000 hours hitting. Let them waste their time. The system will normalise somewhat once people realise the gear just isn't worth no lifing.
---
The ole outsource to save some money trick
---
Traps don‚Äôt scale with SP.
---
Doesn‚Äôt really matter since 90% of pet threat is growl.
---
Use a pig, the charge isn‚Äôt up for every mob but it‚Äôs super nice when it is - also causes that initial hit to hit harder.
---
Since none believes me lol... here‚Äôs the other email he got, Wich is in proper English.

I can confirm it‚Äôs account wide, but not sure if full battle net wide. I was surprised when I found this out, seems odd to lock ur alts out from dungeons based on another characters activity.

Agreed. It was convenient to be able to make it, tho (and/or make for guildies).

Shadow Wrath gear is BiS for warlocks. I paid 90G for my cloak.

I use an addon called "Classic Aura Durations" and it used to just give a timer bar on the debuffs under my targets player icon. I recently downloaded a few other addons and now Classic Aura Durations added a new timed duration thing above my cast bar. 
---
The only way I've found to remove this is by disabling Classic Aura Durations so that's why I assume it's for that Addon. But it never used to do this, and I can't figure out what option turns it off as there's only like 6 options on the menu for the addon. Any help is appreciated.

Put two more in Axe Specialisation, and one more in Two-handed Weapon Specialisation. Make gold by questing, 36-40 is a big gold boost from before so you should get pretty close.

Good hunters now how to use this stuff
---
I started 2 weeks ago and am only level 34. 
---
Just be careful about which server you roll on.
---
I would say you should aim for brutality blade/Vis'kag or deathbringer unless no rogues needs perditions. And if you cant get those , you could always farm dal'rends ;)
---
If you‚Äôre in a minority alliance server, try to avoid WPL because honor farmers will leave UC and run around camping people u til their queues are up.
---
There is more than one Vanilla patch. We basically got the 1.12 patch with gated content. This AV, its honor gain, and cross realm bgs is from the version in this patch. There was a window during which AV was efficient for ranking in vanilla, and due to the phased releases not including patch changes, we got this from the start.
---
I played Vanilla mostly in 2006 and saw the AV farm and AFK players in AV coming a mile away. It's pretty much exactly as broken as I remember, the only new thing being the premade meta on alliance.
---
I remember exactly this amount of whinging from people on PvP servers. I sat on PvE servers wondering what the fuss was back then, so this is just the classic experience for me.
---
Most threat is growl. A cat with growl bite and dash is the best bet. And if youre on a pvp server and dont have broken tooth you're not a complete hunter
---
Dude that‚Äôs like an 8 min read if you made it past middle school.
---
This is not true.
---
Post more pics of you getting a new level or piece of gear and asking for hugs as leave people interested in the mechanics alone then.
---
This is the incorrect version of AV.
---
Even in old AV, as soon as people figured out how to get the most honor it became the same 40v40-run-past-each-other-and-race-to-the-final-boss as current AV. Even when Korrak was a thing people still ended up doing this strat. **It's a player culture problem now.** It doesn't matter which version of AV they implement, it won't ever be a 3-day event like in Vanilla.
---
&gt; Are you familiar with the version Nostalrius produced? That's more akin to what it's supposed to be.
---
Why do people think more npcs = longer AV? Several private servers have had AV with shredders, mines, guards, captains, etc. People still just ignore everything they can, kill whatever gives honor and then rush for the last boss. The BGs end in around 15-mins even with all the npcs.
---
I think it has to do with switching to wand instead which allows for the 5 second rule to fall off letring your mana regen normally while still doing better wand damage.
---
&gt; AV in Nostalrius had way stronger NPCs, minelayers etc.
---
This is fact. You said it was wrong.
---
You are wrong. You lied. You're a liar.
---
&gt; The part where they did stuff like introducing AV in its older version
---
&gt; the world in Nostalrius was seamless.
---
With the introduction of paid transfers recently, servers are in huge flux. A lot of people are fleeing minority population PvP realms because they can‚Äôt play without constant interference, so I‚Äôd say be really careful where you end up, because a lot of the medium servers may be single-faction dead in a couple months.
---
I am not being passive aggressive, I am being aggressive.
---
As anyone should be when faced with liars.
---
Powerwolf? I didn't know the Scarlet Crusade employed shamans
---
Im looking at the Alchemist's Stone for the first time (this \*is\* in game right?), and why isn't this on BIS lists? From what I can tell, and I could be wrong, this is stronger than Shard of the Scale for healers by a good amount (roughly 25mp5!), but I've never heard anyone even talk about it.
---
90% believe it's real.
---
This + most bots (now) are shit ever since Blizzard slapped the most popular and well written one with a C&amp;D order.
---
Then it's a really, really shitty bot.. have fucked with bots a good amount back in wod.. even then I could swap myself out for the bot mid raid and either I'm completely shit (for more than just using the bot) or it was good. But the numbers were the same. Hell to be honest most of the time it would have less over healing than I.
---
What‚Äôs in SM Cath that‚Äôs worth it?

All it's missing is a "please do the needful" and it would look like half the emails I get from India

Is Vampiric Embrace worth a debuff slot in raids?

This is so cringey I hope its fake...
---
Perditions would be a big upgrade for him. But I also want to stress that there isn‚Äôt really dagger or sword rogues per say. A rogue will respec based upon the weapons that are available to him/her. Swords are better and more consistent (especially on trash) but if you are rocking a thrash you‚Äôd gladly take a perditions.
---
Why.... Why do you play this game?
---
&gt;make dumb joking comment

&gt;WHY ARE YOU SO SALTY

reddit is pathetic sometimes

My ex wife told me that she would rather me actually cheat on her than schedule a specific time to play a video game. Some people are really dramatic and can‚Äôt comprehend gaming is a hobby the same as sports and many other things like going out drinking and partying all the time.

When you‚Äôre OP and you know it clap yo hands
---
while in theory you can avoid all the NPC in the alliance base, you have to run a very specific (not-straigth) line and anything a few feet off it will aggro extra mob. any fearing will likely aggro even more... including the stable master. On top of that you'Re getting pelted by archers since they actually have LoS on you.
---
Meanwhile in the horde base you HAVE to go out of your way to aggro anything beyond the sergeant, and you have a nice little cozy hut blocking the archer LoS ( not that half of them can hit the chokepoint anyway).
---
and wtf terrain advantage you'Re talking about? the horde base is a joke, frostwolf GY is in the middle of an open field
---
only seen it listed once on my server for 1.5k.  was gone by next morning
---
I mean, when everyone feels the same way about your comment, I'm sure everybody's wrong.
---
We run dkp, if you have the dkp it's fair to me personally - hell, we had a tank warrior get it and our rogues didn't seem to care much
---
You completely ignored his point. I don't necessarily agree with it, but you spoke past him.
---
He said the problem is 
---
1. min maxers can join memespec guilds but memespecs can't join min max guilds. 
---
2a. if too much of the player base is of min max mentality, there is no home for meme speccers.
---
2b. if too much of the player base is of memespec mentality, there is still room for min maxers to participate. 
---
3. min maxer mentality is inherently exclusionary as a result. 
---
whether thats good or bad, is another thing entirely, but think of it like ally-horde ratios on pvp servers. if too much of a server gets the minmaxer mentality, the memespec type players get driven out. there's no where for them to go. the reverse is not true of the minmax player, however. 
---
this subreddit is absolutely, by a huge margin, a minmax mentality, so many memespeccers feel a bit unwelcome in here.
---
&gt; but I'm enjoying it on my own pace
---
You're making fun of people playing at the pace they want to play at, though?
---
Or epicrit
---
blizzard killed honorbuddy and that was pretty much the only good bot
---
yeah, just need to do 2 pixel-perfect jump, and totally not blockable by 2 or 3 range DPS pelting down anyone trying to do it.
---
that's totally on the same level as alliance hopping over the horde fence and running without aggro'ing any of the horde NPC ( who are all conveniently out of the way) while being out of LoS from our archers...
---
Very true, forgot about that.
---
Same with us our 2nd raid MT took the Perds and the only other people rolling were other tanks
---
right now they're meh.
---
when you meet one/them in the arena, then will the outcry begin
---
Because I don't want to make less money than fast food employees which is what most streamers make. The people from guilds like Limit and Method are mostly mentally ill, ruined their lives dedicating themselves to a failed esport and broke. They usually live in communes like hippies with the head of the esports organization making the money in a pyramid scheme. The fact you even think streaming is glamorous when most of the WoW pros and top arena players would be out on the street without a parental caregiver is hilarious.
---
Very few can even afford a house and the successful financial WoW streamers are variety, not raiding. Method doesn't even get viewers for raids outside the race to world first. The only streamer they had with genuine viewers was Method Josh and he was banned for being mentally ill and threatening women. Go figure...
---
Method as an organization wouldn't even exist without the greasing with Activision/Blizzard and hardware partners. No Hardware sponsors would pay them when they have so little viewers. They are basically CHEAP Blizzard shills/advertising that doesn't have to be claimed as advertising and people who will never say anything bad about the game.
---
never heard of or seen it done in my 13 years of playing, so not sure i believe you. got a video?
---
Plenty of AI play classic wow too
---
like frostwolf GY being in the middle of an open field, as opposed to stormpike chokepoint?
---
or do you mean the horde archers not having LoS on our own chokepoint while the alliance archers pelt down people on the bridge?
---
or maybe you're talking about how all the horde NPC are conveniently out of the way in our base, while you have to navigate a very narrow and precise path to not aggro anything in the alliance base, and a single fear will bring half of the base on you... including the stable master, the horde equivalent being so far away from the base most people don't even know he exist.
---
Questionable opinion to have. And it is very much affected by build/spec/class.
---
hard times now, too much competition
---
Tell him he deserved it, fuck him.
---
Bonebiter has a higher low and top end. Any warrior using it over WW is dumb af. Slow only matters for top end dmg.
---
Who cares? People on this sub need to Let people play the way they want and stop bitching about everything.
---
Nobwe wont. Idk why you would think we wouldnt get the final version of zg when we've gotten the final version of every other raid/dungeon. Blizzard has made it clear they only have the final 1.12 version of everything that's the version were gonna get.
---
Defense never sells for me, healing, shadow and frozen often do, especially the -9 level gear.
---
That's not what happens though.
---
Its a strawman to conclude that the tradeskills are what generates the money. If you're paying for tradeskill items, its with money that is already in circulation.
---
The actual issue here is that when you sell greys, greens, and also just passively loot, you **generate** money. The result is inflation. There's more money in the system, so the money people are willing to pay for items actually rises.
---
The only ways the game has for counter inflation is the AH cut, repairs, and vendor items such as mounts. This isnt enough to deal with how bots generate money, because they simply don't play like players do.
---
I usually go back to low levels and smash them solo like a God. Often get tips or keep Boe drops.
---
Science
---
cause while horde have 15-20 people recall after balinda, alliance will rather QQ about the backdoor than have anything more than 5 people on defense.
---
Lol, the only thing "hard" about leveling is if you have the time to do it.
---
Ofc female master race. Minimal gear clipping, godlike attack animations. Hot af. And they sound vicious when they grunt swinging a 2h.
---
fun fact, the rest of the rolls were pallys.
---
if there's absolutely nobody defending yeah.
---
if there's even just 2-3 alliance player defending that spot... horde not only have to do that pixel perfect jump to get in, but then have to fight in the middle of the ennemy base with the bunkers archer pelting them and half a dozen elite NPC few feets away.
---
Except his bis list isn't even a dps upgrade....
---
swords? almost certainly 8/8 bloodfang even in pvp
---
Really good stuff, I have one question. I've read in guides before that +spell damage is only good if you have a lot of it, and therefore getting the Shadoweave set during leveling isn't worth it. Is that true?
---
Is there really much of this going on?
---
I saw a fair bit of people being told they won't be accepted into a particular guiod/raid without respecting to what it's required, but very rarely people being told 'you suck, just respec'.
---
I would only run the bot for a certain amount of hours each day and only a few hours if I wasn't nearby. The bot I used simply recorded my movements in the start of the game and replicated it. This was enough to get to around balinda. Then it would try to tab target something and cast spells on it. It has preprogrammed actions from each gy you res at too. It would also play a sound at any whispers and alert me.
---
So what else are you supposed to stack? Spellpower, obviously - but that is scarce in early levels. Int? Stam? None of these improve your sustainability. They're more or less useless outside of the occasional pvp. Spirit is the only choice which actually improves leveling speed.
---
considering the horde walls have little snow mound spread around them, allowing you to jump over them deliberately ... it would seem logical that horde also have a way to skip that bridge.
---
if anything, that jump should be easier.
---
if the alliance bother defending your base, you're still fighting within range of the south bunker archer + half a dozen elite NPC... so, good luck.
---
Second this. Ateish is a great server for ally pve
---
Perd is top dps weapon now. 
---
See no point to not get it.
---
same thing for my priest and warlock. I dont need shit from strat or scholo except money.
---
was in one of the interviews that I think tipsout? did with the devs when they had that open demo thing they let the big boys play on. it was either tipsout or preach maybe, I would find it for you but I cbf sorry :p

My mageblade roll on pug :D

Fuck'em!!!
---
Witch is funny as it would help my old school Nostalgia seeing classes running around in what looks cool not what is best.
---
Doesn't sound like too big of a problem to me.
---
Thank you. I hadn't considered vendors.
---
Why not both?
---
Yup, you just made the OP as fuck comp, and steamrolled to victory.
---
I'd also agree with this for AQ40 if your guild tries to make you go deep demonology to tank twin temps. It's completely unnecessary as the shadow resistance gear (and hit gear, nelths tear is almost a necessity on a tanking lock) is reasonably easy to obtain with some assistance from your guild. 
---
Dont gimp yourself an entire dungeon to tank one boss.
---
Wait are you on faerlina alliance?
---
and wowglider
---
rip
---
I agree that you deserve the orbs as much as a raid geared tank. You can refuse to join groups where tanks reserve first orb and try to reserve first orb yourself in your own groups. Last time I saw that tho, they were spamming "LF1M tank strat living, first two orbs reserved" for over two hours in trade chat. 
---
It's simply the rarity of tanks willing to go strat living. Even fresh DPS warriors don't have a single bis item from there, much less tanks (unless you count unforgiving but he is usually also done by strat us groups)
---
A good friend of mine uploaded a video about solo Shard farming with his Shadow Priest! Maybe  it helps you to get a little bit of Gold. :D He will upload some more dungeons later.
---
The video is in german but you can clearly see the route he is taking. :)
---
Negative I'm on heartseeker
---
Warriors and rogues? No. But the parses for mages and warlocks on most fights are close to the same dps. Good locks can beat good mages.
---
I'd wear the Skullflame in raids too. The extra armor and the proc is at least comparable to the stamina and defense on Draconian. 10 shadow resistance is useful on a lot of bosses in MC and BWL too.
---
You would never get Skullflame if all you care about is raiding, but if you already have one? Raid with that shit baby.
---
Shouldn't they be deleting instances that everyone on that instance's member list has reset?
---
WAIT A SECOND, THATS A BOT.
---
Thats a great question. A ton of people were trying to pvp 24/7 and stopped gathering, not to mention that gathering itself became much harder to do, like nearly impossible as both factions had roaming death squads.  
---
  
---
Now youd expect a resurgence after bgs were released but now all those people pvping are doing it in bgs and while the horde side is having more people back out gathering between (currently at) 20-25 min queues, alliance pvpers are basically supressed? Idk a good word for it, but they are stuck grinding instant bg queues if theyre being competitive and while sure  not everyone is trying to grind rank, youre still taking a good chunk of the population away *and* most likely the same population that would be putting stuff up as they play the most.
---
Thanks for this I just started a warlock and I am playing with friends that are way more experienced. Hopefully this will catch me up with them
---
Freezing Band is not unique

People can't believe Activision would outsource it's customer support to Trusttel?
---
Every weapon is hunter weapon
---
I don't think Cata was in any way to "recreate the feeling of vanilla", in fact it was quite the opposite.
---
To me Cata felt like brushing over all the old style of quests/dungeons/raids with the new era introduced in WotLK. They simply re used the old continents, but that may as well have been an entirely new landmass. There's nothing so defining about Uldum/Hyjal/Twilight Highlands that they HAD to be a part of Kalimdor outside of their geographic location, and Deepholm/Vashjir may as well have been anywhere.
---
Yes. As the first person rolling has a higher chance of hitting 1. 
---
Best example: OP
---
Blizzard can either stop updating classic after naxx, which will 100% kill the game. They can go the classic+ route which is risky but could the best option or they can release TBC again which I think alienates the playerbase.
---
No, it's not...  AV was always shit, and will always be shit.  AV being slightly less shit wouldn't make this honor system better.
---
Join your classes discord. I'm in a few of them and I gotta say the warlock discord is by far the best and most helpful b/c of people like dive, zephan, and others.
---
The warrior one has good info, but is generally way more toxic.
---
Mage one is helpful but lacks a really good sim. 
---
I read priest and rogues too but dont have an opinion on them yet. Priest have a good healing sim though.
---
Arcane shot gets stronger :)
---
He died for our sins
---
There‚Äôs an argument that this is intentionally benefiting from a bot in game, and I think blizzard assigns the burden of proof to be on you not knowing it was a bot, so they assume guilty
---
We are talking about qsr
---
Interesting data. Could almost extrapolate this onto Arugal OCE as they have similar pop counts and faction balance.
---
Appears to be a general trend of less activity, despite introductions of new things to do.
---
I rolled up on the silithus demon one day and to my dismay saw two nelf hunters waiting patiently for their lock to rez.  I nodded to them, and to the demon, and then sat back to let them play through.  The lock sorts his shit out, and the duel flag drops.  The demon spawns and the nelf1 is off to the races.  I pop up and nab a spider inching his way, and nelf2 cheers at me.  Things are going well, until an orc 4head warrior trundles up, doesn't hesitate, and pops the scarabs with his aoe, laughs at the hunter, and tries to mount up.  
---
Friends, I stood there and stared that little bitch down while three alliance beat him into the desert sand.  He then called me a few choice words and ignored me, but not before I laughed at him and spit on him.  
---
My nelf brother, his warlock and I commiserated over the corpse of their friend, and we parted ways.
---
Don't fuck with a hunter fighting his/her demons.  That quest is bullshit, and they have enough to deal with.

Why do you need 308 skill? There's no miss chance difference between 307 and 308, and the glancing blow penalty difference is like 2%.
---
You're right, it's close. But mages have a small advantage thanks to getting more hit from talents, and the short fights in MC benefitting them thanks to AP. Being competitive with mages on the meters is reasonable, but a warlock shouldn't completely dump on mages. And if they do, it's likely an issue with the mage.
---
HunteRS neED InT wEaPONs
---
I disagree. I played a gnome all the way too now and I find being horde way more frustrating. Salvation is great, and in pvp only time faction/racials make a difference is premade vs premade. I wonder why I even cast fear or corrupt vs premades when they INSTANTLY get dispelled by the usual 1 priest/double pally groups. Gnome was so much less fustrating.
---
Not really, no.   On horde for instance, you aren't even trying to win.   You are trying to farm honor, as you leech off your teammates to do the work to actually win the game.
---
Scaling
---
Imagine being this butthurt about old shitty AV not being in the game
---
Even now there's still plenty of guilds on my server who are just now getting their first Rag kill, or still recruiting for their main raid team. Even if you start now and don't get a chance to clear BWL week 1, there will be plenty of opportunities to find a raiding guild and get caught up in time. 
---
Classic WoW sorta has built in catch up mechanics that self correct. If you come to a raiding team late, you'll still get plenty of opportunities for loot that no one else needs. Sure you may not get big ticket items your first few weeks, but at least you'll get plenty of gear elsewhere.
---
Class fantasy? Like guldan and the shadow council...?
---
also shots of silvermoon and nagrand in the intro.
---
Nope, it's the min maxing
---
Yes I don't spend my life on Reddit like U do what a surprise üòÇ
---
If BGs hadn't came early, the game would have literally failed, because of wpvp.
---
Or just a "if epic or blue , dont equip "rule.
---
Thanks, I knew as soon as I saw the amount of Text that he had completely ignored the point and then argued in such a min-max way that makes me doubt whenever they complain about being persecuted.
---
Game was fun for me until I hit max level and ran the raids a few times. Then it became an absolute chore and I quit. Still a solo ~200 hours of fun I got out of it
---
As a warrior, I would go into Hellfire Citadel with +3 intel enchant on my sword just to enrage the nerds. Good times.
---
The sim will show them somewhat close together, but if you miss any uptime, the value of rapidity plummets while voracity performs well in less than ideal situations. Voracity will also boost your whirlwind / cleave on multiple target fights.
---
Mist!
---
You can either gquit, or ask to be promoted to raid leader  and lead the shit yourself.
---
It's been a couple months since I last played my hunter but IIRC dampen/amplify magic worked, but spell power/bonus healing didn't.
---
Going off of my memory here though, which is admittedly not the best.
---
Case in point, you compared a meme spec to a drunk instead of someone who is just 60% as good. The elitist mentality shows the bias that is beyond having fun. 
---
A more appropriate analogy would be professional soccer compared to a weekend dad league. No one expects to play with the pros, so it‚Äôs no problem when they don‚Äôt get to go, but the min-maxers talk about them like they are ‚Äúdrunk burdens‚Äù and naturally people are gonna want to tell you to fuck off.
---
Happy for ya! Hope things get better.
---
Yes. Optimal front end agro is slow and bite, never claw. BT is a pvp pet.
---
And in so far as initial agro building is concerned,  optimal would be a boar because of the charge allowing them to begin building earlier.
---
These are minimal effects though, and you will be fine going with whatever.
---
Gold in 5 minutes, no context.
---
You're talking to one of the most knowledgeable people in classic and being smug. I'd love to see to your parses and resume.

Goodnight sweet prince

Amen
---
I use ClassicAuraDurations and I don't see the part you don't want. You may need to disable all addons, then reenable them one at a time to see which one brings those bars up.
---
but he could have sold that staff for hundreds of gold and equipped a high level blue BoP staff with significantly more +heals
---
Stack stamina and take improved life tap. Grab shadow wrath greens wherever you can, there are plenty around for cheap enough. Dot mobs up ssns im Succubus as it has the highest dps, wand them down st the end ti take advantage of the 5sr. Keep first aid up to date you will have no downtime.
---
I was able to hit 60 on my alt post-phase-2 and pre-bgs.  I think you'll manage.
---
I guided because I noticed his name from another thread. He couldn‚Äôt afford classic due to personal circumstances and a Redditor gave him playtime. Thought it was dope.
---
well thats nice!
---
Pfff 6 hours?  I remember playing in an AV, going to sleep, going to school and being in the exact same AV 24 hours later several times.  There were many times I remember one AV going on for multiple days lol.
---
I got mine to match my hair color, which was the stormsaber.
---
Arcane shot new meta
---
Have some too lol
---
Firewalkers hit a random target with Fireblossom.  Threat has nothing to do with it.
---
At the beginning of a pull, only a handful of people are on the threatlist, leading to people getting blossomed twice in a row being quite common.
---
How are we still getting these posts in December?
---
It's a completely different AV, there was no bonus honor from lieutenants, the towers used to buff main boss hp/damage if they weren't taken.  Most NPC's had higher up and damage also.
---
Not paying up is what they mean by cheating.
---
Somewhat
---
I mean, per dollar wow is still the best ROI I can think of, even with the thins I don‚Äôt like. Seems stupid to give that up over a small issue. 
---
Other people feel differently obviously.
---
This comment makes me hate my old guild's loot rules. It was one or the other. Forced to pass on 2 perds and a cht because I was a sword rogue.

In this case, it's a character named Bliizard.  Two 'i's.

Forget the ranks, think of it in term of RP, rank points.  If you want High Warlord, then you need 60,000 rank points.   Use the pic below that was posted.   
---
 You can rank points based on your standing, and the bracket you fall into.  Just like ranks, there's 14 brackets.   The number of positions in those brackets is dependent on the number of players pvp'ing that week.   If you get standing 1, then you 13,000 Rank Points.  The bottom of Bracket 14 gets you 12,000 pts.   It's proportional to your standing, so if you are in the middle of bracket 14, then you would get 12,500 rank points. 
---
Each week you lose 20% of your rank points.  
---
Very basic formula, current Rank Points * 0.8 + Current Standing Rank Points = Next week's rank pts. 
---
For instance, 
---
I have 29295 Rank points.   If I get to the bottom of bracket 14 this week, I'll get 12,000 rank points.  
---
29395 * 0.8 + 12,0000 = 35516
---
Looking at the graph, 35516 would mean I would just barely make it to Rank 9.
---
&gt;we had a tank warrior get it 
---
It's unironically great for tanks. Mitigation at this point of the game is hardly a factor, but threat definitely is.
---
The blue one in the background..
---
No, that is a whole different can of worms.
---
Arugal Horde AH has gone from regularly 30k auctions to closer to 21-22k over the past month. Significantly slower over Christmas too. Less playing, less auctions.
---
The path from the hut to the upper part of the base is an archer deathtrap, and the most critical part of the choke (the hut can be bypassed, that path cannot be).
---
Its actually a MUCH better choke than the bridge because ranged classes can cast / fire into it from both towers.
---
A good parse doesnt mean you're good.
---
But a bad parse definitely means you're bad. 
---
I found from this guys post history he parses a wooping 42% as a mage and by looking at his gear he has no clue how to play his class. 
---

Dunning Kruger's on reddit in full display.

1. SL will be slower but the survivability is massive. Im a nutshell you are losing 10% shadow damage for 40% damage reduction. 2x sacrifice is not to be sniffed at and will ruin a lot of peoples day who try to gank you out in the world 
---
2. Regardless of build your going to have the same problem with +hit anyway at the minute. 09/31/11 with 2 in surpression 2 in improved LT is how I would do it. Soul link is very powerful in 1v1, 1vX and world pvp but it lacks the damage of some other builds. All just depends how your wanting to play.
---
&gt;You're talking to one of the most knowledgeable people in classic and being smug.
---
Must be nice of OP's to call his buttfuck buddies, because pretty much nobody has any idea who you guys are.
---
I stand my point that "nothing outside of tier?" is a dogshit lie.
---
Love the spreadsheet people that forget that aspect in their calculations.
---
What a funny way to look at it. I can usually play two to three hours a day, 3 to 4 days a week, child and wife dependant. Since posting this, I have acquired 3 more bits of pre raid bis, robes of the void pattern and have found a guild that has only 1 other lock who is geared to the teeth. Raiding or doing dungeons is waaaay less of a time vacuum than levelling. They do ony in 25 mins and MC full clear in 2 hrs.
---
we start in Loch Modan and escort a lv1 dwarf through 2 zones to get to Margol the Rager, a mob which drops a queststarter. The reward of the chain is the key to the Searing Gorge. 
---
All of the players wear grey/white gear. There are 5 activities along the way which, on success, reward the players with a letter for a keyword at the end and a guildwide title.
---
Mages also crying when they see pallies with azuresong
---
Briar wood Reed
---
It could also be that he's a newbie player. 
---
I remember myself as a hunter in vanilla. I was lucky enough to get Fiery War Axe which was equipped in an instant. The same would go with spell damage items if I saw it had more raw dmg.
---
Good days tho
---
Another buttfuck buddy of OP who doesn't know that PVP exists and clown around while I do MC in PVP specs and gear.
---
Amazing!
---
Alliance player being so bad no premade is willing to accept you should be painful.
---
yes but do research about servers
---
Imagine them letting all the bots roam free and banning the people messing with the bots
---
[Yep, it doesn't scale.](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Mend_Pet)
---
get a skelly 60% and then buy the epic av wolf for 700g
---
That is also the worst part! The rest of the grind is so much better!

So based off that website it looks like whitemane has some balance between horde and alliance with a 55/45 which isn‚Äôt too bad. 
---
I have a character on skarem but that‚Äôs like 70/20 horde and doesn‚Äôt seem like it‚Äôll be too fun pvp wise
---
Get the slow horse then get a fast wolf when you‚Äôre ready

You've already picked catte.

All cattes are good cattes.

Mend Pet doesn't scale with attack power or spell power.

Exactly how I felt playing
---
Our MT has gotten the bomb on Geddon 2 weeks in a row now
---
Imagine being this insecure about a video game.
---
Wi, you're so full of shit. Post it.
---
Except this 1 kill gives the 200 honor to the entire 40 man raid which is 8k honor.  Way more than a solo hk.
---
Listen to this guy
---
Also pretty good for melee weaving.

EluneNoYume was talking about preparation. Gathering rn stuff is exactly that. Plus, depending on the population of your server, gathering RN stuff on the emerald dragons can be a challenge. Arriving only with maraudon rn stuff might be not enough
---
Well atleast you got 20 ud mages with their bis trinket, i dont mean toep but the recall one. Every game its the same shit.
---
Maybe if they raced together with the group you can win for once, aoe evertything down, Kite lts ect you got 0 resistance from us at all. We dont mind loosing just want quick games. The russians have figured it out. Always fast fun games vs them.

You're still cheated what your owed and what was agreed upon.

Love this guy and his work
---
First one got taken down; hopefully this one survives
---
Bigger question, is that a priest with aurastone?
---
Ty?
---
Who cares, I'm not even 60
---
Alrighty so they'll go around banning manually, yeah? 
---
Every report, which would be thousands upon thousands, gets an individual GM go follow them around to "confirm", watch their logs or whatever and not confirm it with a programme detection because their warden doesn't detect it yet.
---
That means not only are you expecting blizzard to hire a shit load more staff, but you're going purely on a GMs opinion. They could miss a bot and ban someone just grinding because human error is a thing. That GM could well just ban someone who was a dick to them and claim they were botting, just to throw that out there too. Hell they could randomly ban you thinking you're a bot, I'm sure you'd love that GM manual banning then! 
---
Even in a perfect world of 100% GM ban accuracy, there would be appeals and rechecks. It also doesn't stop the cause of the problem, it just stops the small minority that are reported and not those that aren't reported. But of course you know better than blizzard and the rest of us who aren't dense though, eh? Call bullshit all you like and remain ignorant though, that's fine by me.
---
Man, I miss glider. If it was still around I'd be tempted to start a second account to bot on just for fun. I really enjoyed trying to come up with new optimal botting paths that would optimize gold or xp per hour, as well as messing around with trying to create custom classes that worked however I wanted them to.
---
Pretty much this. I do SFK 10-26 and prefer to do arm until 30 or so but that's mostly just preference.
---
From wow head[wowhead](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19029/horn-of-the-frostwolf-howler#comments) :
---
    You can buy this mount for 640g if you are Exalted and have PVP Rank 3. The base price is 800g. You have 10 % discount when Honored or better. And another 10 % for having PVP Rank 3 or better. There is also no need to purchase any riding skill.
---
Is this true? I don‚Äôt need to pay to learn to be able to ride a wolf?
---
Get rank 11 and buy that mount for 90g
---
Went sl+drain at lvl 50 due to gankers. Didnt feel slower with succ out.
---
If course the spriest rolled thinking they can use mageblade
---
&gt;Less playing, less auctions.
---
BGs make people less involved in the world/auction house. It doesn't equate to less playing because there's less auctions.
---
QS MH + Vis MH is fine. Don‚Äôt mind these guys.
---
Yes, it should‚Äôve gone to a dps, but maybe you got it in a PUG.
---
Yep, it's the cheapest mount to buy outside of the R11 (12? 13?) black mount.
---
&gt;Appears to be a general trend of less activity, despite introductions of new things to do.
---
Those new things make people less involved in the Auction House. Yes there's less activity in the world because people are playing in BGs instead.
---
I can't tell if you are being sarcastic.
---
Sure, not everyone wants to be tryhards at this game, but there seems to be a knee-jerk response from a lot of people against even trying at all.
---
Potions and dark runes pretty much are though, lol.
---
These two are certainly not the most used abilities while lvling, at least if you dont want to drink after every Mob
---
Not possible as horde
---
There's really very little point in using 'lesser' consumables
---
+ You either need them (or you don't)
---
+ If you do need them, there's no logical reason to do it half-assed
---
The Horde NPCs are out of the way, but don't worry. Even in a premade, some Alliance pug will manage to pull most or all of them anyway.
---
The negative trend line begins well before BGs are implemented. And looking at the graph, auction quantity decreases initially but then increases overall with introduction of BGs.
---
Literally everyone that's putting in a lot of time into PvP is posting to the AH way less. I'd bet a lot of those PvPers were farming and posting to the AH to farm gold for the PvP grind.
---
Items mainly sourced from higher level dungeons (enchanting mats, librams, recipes, etc.) have also had their prices go through the roof with BG release. There are even fewer people running dungeons nowadays.
---
Consumes for a week costs 15-30g at most. If your folks can't farm that once a week, then they probably couldn't clear MC, even with consumes.
---
my guild is low on funds that's why. and i want to help some people out and get them some of the cheaper pots.
---
I thought shit was super bad on phase 2 release but now that BGs are out everything is fine. I am playing horde though.
---
Server tickrate has nothing to do with it, the spell batching is intentional not a hardware limitation.
---
In a true emergency you can spam DF at the end of a heal going off and it will proc and consume the DF buff and give a crit to the heal you just finished instead of the next one.
---
Well the dbags fuck everyone else over with their premades.   The games start with 20 subpar people on their team.
---
If your guild is low on funds in MC, you will have worse and worse problems as the phases come
---
Get your mount bro trust me. The walking will only get worse. you def want ur 60% mount
---
What button you press is dependent on keybinds. You can make 2 macros that do what you want and bind them to the buttons you like.

---
The damage this staff adds to AS is probably less than or equal to the damage a hunter gains from strength. Hunters end up meleeing frequently while leveling, while on the flip side, usually only auto shot when questing/grinding to save on drinking so much.
---
This is not true. They can however resist the frostbite which procs off of your slow debuff.
---

---
Sorry just took over the sub and tryna help it gain some traction in the community üòò
---
The point is that that hurts alliance except for that premade.
---
Alliance don‚Äôt win anymore
---
Yeah I feel like the people I party with are too polite to complain but it definitely is a burden.
---
I know for me personally I have just progressed a lot further and more quickly than I did back in the day. I have most pre-bis, a decent amount of MC loot, and am clearing it every week. Back in Vanilla I didn't clear any of the raids except for ZG  and I don't think I even had a single purple. I have like 6 already this go around.
---
Vendor Price
---
Probably, but I could see the animation, but you know better.
---
Depends on the length of the fight. Normal mobs at your level, corruption and immolate is often enough. Siphon life if it‚Äôs gonna last 20s+ ish? Due to the ramping of CoA with all the dmg coming in the last ticks, only use if it‚Äôs gonna run the whole duration. Curse of Doom if the fight lasts more than 1 min and you feel lucky ;).
---
Google icy veins Classic warlock for more tips. Also consider running drain tank with succubus, as it‚Äôs quicker than fear juggle and gives you better uptime and you can kill elites rather easily at later levels :)
---
link?
---
DM:E jump runs, selling tank services (like orb reserve) or herbalism.
---
Those are the ways to make respectable consistent gold for a tank. And they give good enough GPH.
---
They are rare for Strat Live bc they need absolutely nothing from it and it is one of the most annoying dungeons to tank and wipe on esp if the grp have ppl who are inattentive. 
---
Lol all these ‚Äútanks‚Äù running strat ud, arena, ubrs rend are fury warriors that are willing to tank a dungeon to get their dps gear.
---
This isn't even remotely solid proof get off, most of u have hate boners for streamers on this reddit fuck off, he wont get banned and these videos prove nothing but him being afk but doing actions to not get deserter what a horrible person! get off ur moral high horse.
---
Yeah the sum of glance miss dodge (while attacking from behind), subtracted from 100 is your crit cap. That number shrinks a lot if you use hs toggling as it removes the dw hit penalty.
---
Why waste all that time if you're going to quit the game? This doesn't make any sense to me..
---
I got so sad walking into the AH and seeing 4-5 Warrior tanks wearing the same ugly BiS clownsuit.
---
Because people botting makes them money from the subs, but you screwing with a bot doesn‚Äôt.
---
Big brother is watching you.
---
I'd love to claim that makes sense based on how the tooltip is worded, but the honest answer is it's just one of those classic wow janks that make no fucking sense. 
---
Honestly, though, that's kind of what makes it a good game. Like once you figure out all that jank, master it, learn how to manipulate it.. it makes you feel powerful. Something retail is completely missing.
---
ah true. i rip it from the east coast so timing is different..
---
Could literally just jump over the fence, its hilarious how shit the horde base is.
---
It actually messes up the numbers quite a lot. The number of auctions have nothing to do with the number of players, or player activity, when we talk about the first months of a server.
---
As an indicator of player activity, the AH number of listings will be relevant comparing the figures from month 6 onward.
---
Everyone and their dog posted crap in AH at the beginning of a server. And by crap, I mean low-end and mid-end crafting materials. During the first month, those materials were needed by everyone.
---
Now, the low-end an mid-end mats are maybe, maybe needed by alts, unless the player is using the alts for farming them.
---
It is obvious that when you remove all those low-end and mid-end mats from AH listings, because virtually nobody needs them, the number of listings will drop like a rock.
---
But that doesn't mean that the server have a problem, in player activity.
---
Thousands upon thousands of reports?   There's like 300,000 people playing the game.   1 in a 1000 might be bots.   That's 300 bot accounts.
---
There's a lot more playing than that. I'm also talking both games considering it affects both.
---
Possible or not -- nobody's gonna let you into their BWL run wearing full greens unless you pay them for a boost.
---
Because that's what it is -- getting boosted.
---
Today a rogue in AV got assigned to pre cap RH in horde base. He didn't mention he's on a slow mount. Guess what happened? He didn't make it to past half the map.
---
The PvP system in vanilla was designed to reward commitment in terms of hours invested. As a result honor / hour has become an important metric and horde had some problems getting the top spots in the last week due to que problems. I hope my post will help them determine the optimum  strategy to maximize their honor/hour gain.
---
It seems like Blizzard were so careful not to make certain abilities overpowered in vanilla, such as mend pet which compared to later versions that we got in TBC+ is an awful spell.
---
Meanwhile they had no idea how OP their CC system was lol.
---
Savage Gladiator's Chain. BiS chestpiece for warriors, rets, hunters and enhancement shamans. Comes from the BRD Arena.
---
So as long as I've hit rank 3 at any point, I can get the discount on the mount? Even if I'm down to rank 2 or 1 at the time?
---
Every weapon ever, is a hunter weapon.
---
Mana?

NOGGENFOGGER ALLIANCE
---
Looking for folks to start a guild with at Noggenfogger Alliance.
---
Pretty much tired of lack of transparency and organisational skills in other guilds, so looking to fix that. Ideally would like to create semi-casual/semi-hardcore environment where people are encouraged to put in the effort but not punished for not.
---
Hit me up here or on discord tobe4funas#2464, cheers!
---
It‚Äôs not just gear in naxx. If you come unprepared without consumables you‚Äôre not gonna pull your weight at all. So I wouldn‚Äôt say you can put it because average pugger is too cheap to even buy a mongoose
---
Yes i know dead thread
---
But mortal strike, purely as a damage dealer, was many times a one hit kill on mages and other squishies.
---
Get an arcanite Reaper with crusader go 31/20/0, and beef out +crit +AP gear.. so scholo + pvp ranked gear. MASSIVE crits.
---
That addon is quickly becoming my favorite one. It has so many goodies.
---
Please, all I'm asking is for an optional consumable list that's cheaper than what we have here. We're already using this list, but I want to also include a more affordable alternative.
---
Empathy is difficult. Are you actually trying to understand?
---
I mean, it‚Äòs probably pointless to try. Because you say it does not make ‚Äûany‚Äú sense to you.
---
Consider these:
---
-	if people go too hard irl, they burn out and need to take a break
---
-	people rank for the rewards exclusively. Pushing for ranks past a certain rank is entirely unfun
---
-	it is a long-term commitment. A lot of people would rather quit at one point but fall victim to a sunk cost fallacy
---
-	it is tempting for many to sell. Even it is just pennies per hour. Some might just tell themselves they will get a ton of money so they finish without even checking
---
-	it‚Äòs inherently unhealthy and only possible by sacrificing everything. Even your guild participation. Those people did not play the actual game while ranking. Why should they start after? They are in for their bragging rights and find themselves with no more carrots to chase at least for a while.
---
The list is endless really. Most of the r14 I met have quit soon after.
---
I mean, yeah. You are technically correct.
---
But you and me still know the person is guilty and should be held to different standards than you and me.
---
And honestly, that‚Äòs the end of it and by pointing your thing out you are not really adding to the discussion but distracting from the topic at hand.
---
But you are correct. This is not proof. Just some unsubstantial evidence. But we are not in a court.
---
We are not supposed to upvote comments that are correct on some mathematical level. Instead we are to upvote what we believe adds to the discussion and topic at hand. You are not even the first to point this out. We understand this is not technical proof. But why should we care?
---
AV is changed already.
---
But the fun is in the mistakes we make, not the perfect games we watch.
---
He's not botting though. You can't seriously think something auto running is even vaguely definitive proof of botting.
---
Sports are much older than 15 years. Does that make ppl who try to be the best dumb?
---
Genius.
---
Can't speak for other classes except Holy Paladins. 
---
Bufffood is kinda the only thing that exists at the moment for us except mana potions and of course flasks, you'd be a fool to waste in MC.
---
For food I go for the int food from DM:E mainly because its cheaper and I can farm it myself. 
---
Potions are soso. Depending on raid dps thats mainly tied to attendance I can get away with just chucking greater mana potions on cooldown. I can get pretty much unlimited amounts of by doing strat. 
---
I keep a few dark runes and demonic runes + major mana pots in reserve but I really try to stockpile them for later content same as flasks. 
---
The only encounters I'm in danger of running low on mana are the last two bosses in MC and onyxia(mainly due to doing it in 20 man).
---
Also something every mana class should get: Lei of Lilies. 20g-50g in AH and pretty much 500hp/mana every hour on the healtstone/dark rune cooldown.
---
Well, the Improved Drain Soul thing is wrong. If your demon gets the killing blow you do NOT get the buff. Real easy to test. Go ahead. So I can't really trust this thread, so I stopped reading.
---
Aiiight my bad
---
I have actually tried to get ganked, even when songflowers or so are involved or afking for hours at brm gates.
---
It‚Äòs safe to say that wpvp is on hold while ppl afk in av.
---
Lol I haven't played retail since Cataclysm so try again. In vanilla it was never like that, that's tryhard private server logic, maybe you should go back there?
---
Think whatever you want, but I've literally never run into anyone in game who followed the same flawed logic so your argument of "that's just the way it is" is laughable.
---
Also being done by eminence on Fairbanks. Videos have been posted to reddit the 2nd day of bgs. Nothing happened.
---
Ah I see, that's not what I said though. Playing on a private server is certainly not illegal. I was talking about operating one.
---
I confirm this !
---
24% I think and higher if the difference between Weapon Mastery and Defense is greater than 10.
---
Less of an issue than being able to just run to Drek and pull with everything still up.
---
If only Vann was that easy
---
Lmao where can i find these cookies? XD
---
You seem to know a lot about botting..... are you making wild guesses that you are passing off as facts or is there something you want to tell us?
---
I had a nemesis in LoL like 7 years ago who I played probably 10 times over a year during my climb from silver to high diamond, named "legolas1995car".
---
That guy was a legend
---
Nah that's lame nerd shit I'm talking d&amp;d warlock shit mane
---
&gt; Meanwhile they had no idea how OP their CC system was lol.
---
Oh, they knew. It's not like people weren't screaming in beta about mages having basically no cooldown on frost nova or screaming about rogues in pvp.
---
Can I post a meme shitting on non meta classes for no reason next time?
---
in priv servers it skyrocketed at least
---
Don't play warlock but I still appreciate the highly detailed post! There's some great info in here
---
You are so full of shit LOL. AVs were 30v30 tug-of-war frontlines that lasted for many hours and usually had hours of queues for one faction.
---
Holy shit what is it with those mental gymnastics.
---
Doesn't matter! Has been massively reported, if they ban it for that then how does it even help the bot developer?
---
Hello fellow RPG lover, I can't speak for others but I would be ecstatic to finally be allowed to spread some much deserved Christmas joy‚Ñ¢ to my fellow faction members.
---
Me throw da pointy end at 'em, gud damage!
---
I'm horde on kromcrush. Been making good money killing the 4 demons for people.
---
I would guess it's a combination of both. Or maybe it's just that less people are playing now in the winter months and numbers are going down organically
---
I like how you photoshopped a whole train of horde lol
---
So, you are saying that 1 in 10 accounts are bots?  ROFL!   Yah, people are bad with numbers.
---
Horde has a long queue because we def. Its more honor and rep an hour by simply losing or winning fast. Which the casuals on horde dont realise. So they strted turtling. 
---
Which lead to longer queues.
---
This is the way.
---
&gt;would've lost to a 90 but it was a spriest (priests can't use swords)
---
and even if they could, imagine thinking someone would give Mageblade to a Priest.
---
I‚Äôm not a pheasant plucker,
---
I‚Äôm a pheasant plucker‚Äôs son,
---
I sit plucking pheasants,
---
‚ÄòTill the pheasant plucking is done.
---
Try and say that as fast as you can
---
Nightfall axe to buff your casters seem like a better option in p3. Combine it with crit on gear for flurry, windfury on weapon. So what if you hit like butter, the wars/rogues will love you for totem twisting and the casters will love you for the debuff on bosses due to axe.
---
It's actually insanely 'trivial' to make AV 'competitive', whether that aligns to the 'no-changes' philosophy is a different issue entirely though
---
+ For every side objective (Galv/Bal, Towers, Com/Lt, mines, etc.) that you have killed/control gain a buff that grants an honor multiplier for all honor gains (whilst the buff is active).
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
If each side-objective gave (random number) +100% honor then you'd be pretty nuts to not play the objectives and just rush through it.
---
We don't need 'arenas' in Classic, we already have the STV/Dire Maul arena for that.
---
The honor system in Vanilla/Classic in and of itself isn't objectively bad, it's only when it's taken to extremes (24/7 no-lifers/botters) that it becomes unfeasible. It's a purely self-inflicted problem. The system rates you based on your 'honor-contribution' relative to your peers, it is quite literally your peers kicking you in the nuts and making you look bad.
---
If your server (faction) made an agreement to do no more than 1 hours worth of PvP per week (on any given character) and this was actually honored by all participants there would be no need for any insane grinding. The highest contributor might put in 24/7, but that doesn't mean the 2nd highest contributor couldn't get away with 1 hour of honor farming. Then after 2 months (and yes, I'm excluding bots in this ideal world) after the crazy person who put in 24/7 gets their rank and then gives up the next person will hit max rank just from 1 hour of PvP.
---
Tfury and bwl trinkets still good in tbc no?
---
Fellow Dreadmist-EU player here, tho I'm on horde. Nonetheless, good job! I'll report them too.
---
Sounds like the mobs you're trying to sap are undead. If you mouseover them it should tell you what sort of mob they are. Grats on level 10!
---
Thank you.
---
They're not humanoids, they're undead. Humanoids are playable races (yeah, I'm aware of the Forsaken controversy here, but that's balance for you) plus some monstrous humanoids like gnolls, kobolds or bristleboars.
---
I thought we were finished with these kind of posts now. 
---
No one cared 3 months ago, no one cares now.
---
It's really not like using a rocket to traverse a mountain. It's like using a rocket to go to space, vs using a mountain bike to climb a mountain.
---
Everybody knows you don't NEED bis lists to clear MC. That's not the point. People passed the point of just clearing MC long ago; the competition has moved. The competition now is not about reaching the top, it's about racing to the top. And it will be the same for BWL, AQ and Naxx.
---
The game has changed since 2004. We're not using 15 years of knowledge to play vanilla; we're using it to play Classic. And part of the fun of Classic - for me - is seeing how much you can make this 15 year old game your bitch with all the knowledge and optimization in the world.
---
If you don't like that, that's fine. But acting like people are bringing guns to a knife fight, when all they're really doing is bringing guns to a gun fight that you insist on bringing a knife to because "it's more fun", is silly.
---
tactics evolve, rush vs rush horde loose, meaning the efficiency goes out the window so horde changed tactics, should always put up a defence if they don't then they are wasting a lot of time to get away with much much less than an hour long turtle loss (when you account for time lost in the queue)
---
Rolled a 98 on my staff of dominion tonight on my warlock. Got 2/3 pieces of Felheart that dropped, and the spell power ring dropped too (lost),
---
Good night though. Strapped a +30 SP on that bad boy right away.
---
Too long on the internet, actually...
---
not getting rid of bots is a great way to make your playerbase lose interest in gold farming and anything else bots can do. Losing interest in parts of the game is gonna speed up player loss. This isn't rocket science
---
You can use details addon. It has this feature
---
Exactly, but every guild can get to sub 1hr raids if they reevaluate tactics and individual player's efforts.
---
They treated the game like an MMO back then is the case, not a competitive game. I‚Äôm an avid arena player, 2500 xp, and yet I still vastly prefer vanillas design philosophy. Not everything has to be an esport (tho I do love those 2, sc2 etc).
---
Is arcane crystal going to increase in price for later phases?
---
Layers probably helped amount of actions too.
---
Ok I'll be the bad guy and say directly what people are trying to say politely. I can take the downvotes.
---
&gt;1. min maxers can join memespec guilds but memespecs can't join min max guilds. 
---
Of course. Min-maxers carry memers. They're better performers. They are wanted. In harder content, they are *needed*. Memers drag everyone else down.
---
An enhancement shaman in my guild barely exceeds the tank in damage. That's a literally wasted raid spot that could've gone to a healer or DPSer.
---
A Boomkin joins our raids sometimes and does super low DPS. They could be replaced with a druid healer and no one would notice the DPS loss.
---
Those are two *dead* raid slots. If we had two mages/warlocks/warriors instead, we'd be downing bosses even faster.
---
Why do we give them the slots? Because they're our friends and we leveled together. But I don't expect they'll be included in the AQ and naxx rosters.
---
&gt;2a. if too much of the player base is of min max mentality, there is no home for meme speccers.
---
They can play in casual guilds, or make their own, or be the lucky Nightfall guy if their guild is heavy on casters.
---
&gt;2b. if too much of the player base is of memespec mentality, there is still room for min maxers to participate. 
---
This is what happened in Vanilla. Most people just having fun and a handful of guilds per server actually being able to clear content.
---
It was almost impossible for a memer to join these guilds. Because they brought almost nothing to the raid.
---
You know what that resulted in? People glorifying gear from MC and BWL and wishing they could do these places and get that gear.
---
Nowadays (thanks to the prevalence of min-maxers) everyone has that gear.
---
&gt;3. min maxer mentality is inherently exclusionary as a result.
---
You minimize the poor performance and maximize the high performance. That's what min-maxing is.
---
Thus, you minimize meme specs and maximize raid specs.
---
Let me say one last thing, most memers don't enjoy being underperforming. They love the style of gameplay that their class has, but no DPSer finishes a fight barely above the tank and thinks "*alright I did equal work and I'm proud of my contribution*". That's why they try extra hard to show how they contribute aside from DPS.
---
If I were to want Classic+ after naxx, the very first thing I'd like to see is a balancing patch. Give more specs more viability even without adding abilities, just tweak damage and mana cost.
---
But as it stands, meme specs are memes. They won't be sought after. And min-maxers are carriers. They'll always be welcomed.
---
no I'm queueing solo, i meant that i queued into a game with a premade. but yeah it was obviously a shit one lol.
---
I‚Äôm shadow specced and do more healing on Drek fights in AV premades compared to the actual healers. 
---
I play a Priest. Priest has heals. When the time calls for it, I will heal. 
---
But don‚Äôt you fucking dare label one ‚Äúspec‚Äù as useless based on some scrubs you see in a pug.
---
Thank you:) yw
---
So now you're saying honor is irrelevant to rank?
---
I think it's time to get off Reddit and go back to farming AV, though you're probably afk in the starting cave as you scroll Reddit
---
He also has a guild tabbard with no guild
---
Imo it does make sense to bring it up if he has cheated in the past, instead of treating this like first time offense.
---
How did you delete Firey War Axe? You have to literally type ‚ÄòDELETE‚Äô into a box to destroy and epic XD
---
If druids we‚Äôre only supposed to wear leather, then they wouldn‚Äôt be able to equip cloth.  - repeat this for anything else.
---
Armor types doesnt matter at all in classic. Theres a lot of cloth/leather/mail healing gear thats bis for even a paladin in endgame. They didnt have a bonus for wearing only your suited armor type until later expansions. So you are gonna have to live with this in the endgame as well
---
get used to it now, because at 60 a lot of cloth is bis for druids &amp; pallys too.
---
NO YOU MUST HATE IT
---
Where can I find info on AH listings?
---
I have not said that running up a hill is an exploit it's just that the way that backdoor works is way different than in the original game, which there doesn't even seem to be a single video of it being done during vanilla. And you can't call outranging mobs that don't chain pull an exploit either. If you want to change the way pulling works you have to change the entire game mechanic which is at least consistent over the whole game. It's just very strange that now all of a sudden a steep hill can just be run over.
---
no boots increase movement speed, people put an enchant on boots called minor speed
---
What triggers you so much, friend?
---
ah i didn‚Äôt see that you were a rogue.
---
its just some bants and rants man wdym
---
I saw in leveling guides there is boots that increase movespeed thoh. I just can't find the videos.
---
Can't you report them afk?
---
I always get pally buffs. Other classes, not so much.
---
I am not. You're just a liar.
---
It‚Äôs an enchant.  Minor Speed increase specifically.  You can put the enchant on most (if not all) boots.
---
Ooh, thankfully I‚Äôm horde so don‚Äôt need to worry about the undead ability

https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10724/gnomish-rocket-boots
---
These are engineering boots. So u need to level engineering up to wear these.
---
i don‚Äôt fight undead rogues. i fight alliance rogues. (??)
---
Yeah I was thinking this. Reroll alliance :D
---
About how much should I trip for crafting/enchanting if I have the mats for it? Do you generally base it around a % of the mats cost (ie. more expensive things tip higher)?
---
Oof, run out of something meaninful to say so go with the middle school ‚Äútriggered‚Äù. 
---
That‚Äôs a yikes from me dog :(
---
but please respond to this because i am telling you to
---
I never said that running up the hill the hill was an exploit, my problem with it is that the way this hill works now is way different than what seems to be in the original game. In my opinion outranging gadgetzan guards is not an exploit. Yes if they would have rereleased av I would have liked them make the guards chainpull more consistently, but wouldn't you want them to fix then that steep hill can just be walked over with a mount?
---
Simple, don't move your character when crafting expensive stuff
---
Triggered
---
Try to level omewhere unpopulated. You could always pay for a character transfer too
---
You know, at first I cringed and cried a little inside (as a mage main). But now that you've pointed that out, he's probably new to the game and happy he found a cool purple item. Good for him.
---
Can only sap humanoids. Undead don‚Äôt count as humanoid.
---
I've boosted a few sets of alts now as a mage.  
---
Try to be at least 4 in the group (3 alts), for maximum experience, being a full group doesn't reduce experience, but doesn't increase it majorly.  
---
Having some defense potions can help a bit (250 armor ones are cheap), as well as some health/mana potions (doesn't have to be Major ones).  
---
Speed and invul potions can help in emergencies.  
---
Minor Speed on boots is all but required.  
---
The trinket that gives a small shield against physical damage is invaluable for emergencies/certain difficult pulls.
---
Below are some quick videos I took for some guildies, so they aren't intended to be instructional, and I don't have for all instances, but can help a bit.
---
8-16: [RFC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMRGMm4RYt8)  
---
You can do the entire dungeon in one pull, you can tag the "sides" below the first bridge from the bridge with blizzard.  
---
Two makes it easy.  
---
You can leave the alts at the entrance.
---
17-24: [SFK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6F7ncNyps)  
---
You can do it in two/three pulls, but four makes it easy and safe.  
---
One pull to the first boss, and open the door.  
---
One pull get everything in the courtyard, and take a lap up the stairs, around down in the kitchen, and then back into the courtyard, IB, then Flamestrike, CoC, Coldsnap, CoC, AE to kill them.  
---
Then pull to before the wolfpens(?), last part ontop of the walls, or to the wolf boss if you feel confident.  
---
After that there aren't many mobs left, but you can kill the last boss etc depending on time so you don't hit the lockout.  
---
Remember to loot any chests you see on the way, as well as the mobs, some items are worth a lot on twinks.
---
25-43: SM: GY/[Armory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGej6oIcaow)/Cath  
---
At this point having Magic Absorption really helps (mana on spell resist).  
---
If you are boosting a healer (pref. a priest), or other mages, you can do each instance in one/two pulls, it requires a bit more thought and gear if you are doing it completely solo.
---
If you have a healer and a mage that you are boosting, you can easily do cath+armory in about 15min, which is the best exp/h.
---
GY is the easiest, and you can pull everything in one (or two pulls if you want to be safe).  
---
One thing to look out for is the ghosts that spawn new ghosts, if you pull many of those they can interrupt you, so try to make sure you have a fresh barrier before you AoE. I always try to time it so I have a fresh one with &lt;10s left on me when I IB, so I am protected when leaving IB, and then can cast a new one before I AoE.
---
Armory is pretty simple as well, depending on if I have a healer/mage or feel confident I do it in either 1/2 or 2/3 pulls. The video above have it in 3 pulls IIRC.  
---
3 Pull is basically courtyard, first set of mobs up the stairs, then everything to Herods room.  
---
2 Pull is courtyard, then everything from Herods room.
---
Cathedral if a bit tougher if you are without healer/mages to assist. But consists of 3/4 pulls. Lower courtyard, top courtyard, and then two half cathedrals.  
---
It's fairly easy to get both courtyards in one pull, and then the entirety of the cathedral in a second one. But if you want to be safe, you can split it.  
---
If you want to do full pulls solo, I recommend going a Master of Elements, shatter crit build instead of blizzard. As the mobs heal so you want to burst them down.
---
Library, while possible, I don't recommend as the other ones are faster and easier to do the pulls.
---
44-50: ZF Graves+Scarabs / Mara full pull  
---
I def. recommend doing ZF graves+scarabs here. The mara full pull, while probably the best exp/h in the game right now, is very difficult, and one mistake will set you back 20-30min.  
---
It took me maybe 5-10 hours to START getting the pull down consistently, and if you die once you are back to slightly above ZF Graves+Scarabs, if you die twice you are basically on, or below what ZF graves+scarabs give.  
---
I don't currently even offer Mara as a boost run, as it's not that consistent for me yet.  
---
In ZF if the alts are 44+ it's easy to just run straight to GY and reset the mobs, if they are lower you might want to reset them half-way between the stones on the left on the straight before the fountain.  
---
I do the graves in two pulls when I'm alone, as I feel I might as well do it safely as I'm hitting the instance lockout otherwise anyway.  
---
With Ice Armor, Mana Shield and Ice Barrier: Open the two "large" rows, one row at a time, with resets in between. I.e. take one row, reset them in the safe spot, then the next, reset at the safe spot.  
---
Then swap to Mage Armour (Ice Armor can "split" the mobs if they hit you), Ice Barrier and then mount up, pull and gather them, then AoE them down in your preferred way MoE, Shatter is faster, but Blizzard is safe. No need to use Ice Block on zombies.  
---
Remember that the graves despawn quick, I have the alts I boost loot while I drink up.  
---
Then do the same for the last set of graves.  
---
On scarabs, remember that scarabs will pull other scarabs, so you can pull a few, then run around along the walls/edges to let them pull the rest, Ice Block at the end (remember to use Ice Barrier before you start, so you have a new one after IB in case a mob resists). Then you can kill them however you want.  
---
For other pulls in ZF, if you have more mages, and/or a priest in the group, you can easily do other pulls. But if you are a solo mage, having 3/4 Witch Doctors in a pull can fuck you up due to healing, unless you have the gear and spec to burst them down.  
---
51-55: BRD Prison  
---
This is a bit harder as a solo mage, if you have one mage and/or priest in the group it's much easier to do. This is mainly due to the Wardens Net, so if you are a Gnome, it's easier (I'm not). It deals damage when they throw it so it can interrupt you.  
---
If I'm alone I do the large space slowly with only a few mobs at a time, but as soon as the wardens are dead, you can do large pulls.  
---
If you have some +fr gear in your AoE gear, it can help on the pulls where you will have Fire Elementals, it'll give you mana, and prevent interruptions. Otherwise FR protection potions / resistance potions can help.  
---
Speed potions help greatly on the pulls.  
---
You can pull an entire "U" turn, but I recommend spiting them up if you are alone, as they HURT when you come out of IB, and a few resists can fuck you.
---
55+: DM:N/E  
---
This isn't that good of an experience farm, I just like to include it as you can farm gold a bit at the same time, doing Hyenas / Lashers. Much less exp/h than alternatives.  
---
I would recommend doing dungeons instead for gear.
---
If I focus on boosting, and that's the only thing the alts do, it's about 3-4 days /played until level 50/55, and a lot of gold. Where ZF &gt; BRD &gt; SM &gt; SFK, not counting lucky drops.  
---
I've done it free for friends/guildies, but otherwise depending on how I feel I take about 5g/hour up until SM. From then on if you are on a larger server you will have no end of people wanting to join so I charge 2/3g per reset, or 5g per reset if they are annoying, or there are a lot of buyers, remember that a reset is most often armory+cath.  
---
I'm not selling Mara/BRD yet as I haven't perfected them yet, but you can easily take 30g / hour (per alt) in Mara if you perfect them. It's close to 180k exp/h if you manage to get it down to 3 instance clears an hour.  
---
I always take all the drops, unless the alts need something. Getting +stamina to the alts help when you get to ZF due to the run to graves, so try to get them all the stamina gear that you can.
---
Thank you ! :)

I tried to solo princess yesterday and kept getting destroyed. I'm SM/ruin-specced, have speed enchant on boots, and am moderately-geared. I've watched multiple videos on YouTube where they kite her around the edge and they make it look so easy. I tried 4 times and got killed each. My best try I got her down to around 25% but if she manages to get close to me she one-shots me.
---
My questions:
---
1. Any tips on beating her? I don't try to recast immolate after the first go.
---
2. Are tinker/princess runs worth it if I don't have herbalism or mining?
---
3. What are the best ways to make gold as an SM/ruin warlock without gathering professions? I'm presuming if I can't hack mara then I won't be able to do DM east solo runs. Will any of these methods be jeopardised if I respec DS/ruin?
---
So you afk for 10 min inside AV to prove that another guy is afk for 10 min inside AV?
---
Everyone in this sub is a fucking douchebag and a neckbeard (confirmed) I wouldn‚Äôt be offended.
---
Lots of people quit.
---
Naturally the people that go to forums are min makers since they look for the information to do so. If you are surprised from the response I don‚Äôt know what to tell you, friend. 
---
You can argue that dagger rogue is fine, which it is, but it‚Äôs not the most optimal, so you get crucified.
---
It would already be huge not to connect the dots.
---
You want one point in the graph per day. While stocks etc look much like this, they usually actually track so many more (small) intervals that it makes sense in those cases.
---
One could actually translate the non-periodic day-to-day fluctuations into error bars with the moving average as a residual so to speak.
---
As I said, that's your opinion.
---
If those are facts, bring proof.
---
How much of a poor little person you must be, to browse reddit to target and make fun of another persons post, you are not only stupid, you are also a very lame and boring individual
---
Are there any maps out there with routes for efficient herbalism/mining leveling? Not just "gather X in zone Y" like on wowhead.
---
Yes! Couldn‚Äôt remember the exact name
---
W00t 2g 17s 70c!!
---
Sure, the way i see is the decay's function is to keep people from hoarding it which results in people not taking upgrades thus hurting the guild's progression. The other benefit is a catch up mechanic for newer guildies.
---
The downside of it is it's rather confusing - how do you evaluate whether it's still worth taking the hit of decay or not. There is also a point to be made that folks earned their dkp, why should they lose them?
---
So why not just offer some other catch-up mechanics, i.e. extra consumables (say one dps consumable is mandatory and 3-4 additional ones just get you more DKP), signing up for raid in advance and sticking to the word.
---
If you want people to take upgrades, all you have to do is make it mandatory for people to roll if it's a factual upgrade and make them pay the absolute bare minimum of DKP.
---
If we're talking about waiting for an entirely new phase with all that dkp, make the first few weeks like double DKP weeks to make sure EVERYONE shows up and your guild progresses as fast as possible right from the getgo?
---
Hit 30 on my alliance warlock tonight , just questing around, my quests have sorta dried up, where should I go from here?
---
so far I've felt like pvp in vanilla is fun because its so incredibly unbalanced
---
With guild runs, they usually want to gear up people who come to the raid regularly, since that will make it easier in the future. DKP is one way of measuring how often someone comes to raids. My guild uses a loot council - basically, our GM+class leaders decide who gets what. Loot council has a bad reputation because people often end up favoring themselves or their friends, but my guild is pretty open about it - they have posted spreadsheets showing who has priority on what gear.
---
Either way, yeah, there's a good chance you won't get anything on the first run, even if gear for your class drops. Show up on time each week, learn the mechanics etc, and you'll get loot. But pay attention to what loot system they use and whether it's done in a fair way.
---
In PUGs, it's a different story - here, the people starting the PUG may have some specific gear they're looking for, which they will reserve, and the rest is rolled for much like in dungeons. Lots of raid PUGs don't reserve anything - if you reserve, for example, a good piece of mage gear, it will be harder to get mages to join.
---
Believe it or not, you will have a wolf mount sooner if you buy a horse now.
---
Idk man, hard for me to relate. I was fed up of running everywhere before I left Barrens.
---
It sure ain‚Äôt
---
"guys, it literally says hunter on the bindings come on"
---
Great guides as always. I was wondering, does anyone know if having 5/5 in Suppression (+10% to not have affliction resisted) interacts at all with players and mobs that have shadow resistance??
---
I‚Äôm currently leveling up on a EU PvE server and the world is alive, been getting dungeon groups, lots of helpful people and a decent amount of people leveling etc.
---
Take the jump, will have lots of fun!
---
Everyone did listen though?
---
In vanilla the bots definitely had options to keep items of certain rarity as well you could set up white and black lists for items you wanted to automatically sell/keep/trash.
---
You do not need any special skill for the AV mount, I am riding the AV goat atm as human and only revered with IF. The cheapest epic mount is AV mount with PVP rank3 and AV exalted.
---
You do not have to learn wolf riding skill to ride the av mount. You can just buy it and ride it.
---
Found the dying warrior
---
This was not the case until 3.0.2, when Martyr was added for Alliance. Until then Alliance had a different seal (Seal of Vengeance) that was significantly worse for DPS.
---
Thanks for the advice everyone, I think I'll give it a go! Glad to hear that the community from vanilla has sort of found its way into classic, should be fun! Thanks everyone
---
Choose by the eye color! You like green or purple more?
---
the purge
---
Deja stats, if im not mistaken
---
Given you have the ability to look before you buy...
---
??? That makes no sense because it doesn‚Äôt matter how much Honor/hour everyone gets
---
You shouldn't have trouble at all as any spec/gear level. Get to max range, cast imolate then immediately start running and casting dots. Keep the instant cast ones up all the time. Run to the edge of the room, then keep running round. When she gets closish, send the void in, the second she casts dust storm pull the void back. You get 3/4 'resets' of her positioning by doing this before the void dies and that's why locks have such an easy time here. During dust storm you can get a few casts off but until you're confident just use it to get some distance.
---
Mara is not worth it without herbing though. Best you can do w/o gathering is dme 3 boss runs, check the warlock discord for info (type !dme into not spam)
---
This looks so clean man, congratulations!
---
&gt;I can't picture anything worse than spamming mend pet to kill stuff...
---
...for 6 hours straight. To solo a raidboss.
---
Ofc you are. Numbers in names are almost never random and 80% year of birth..
---
The shadow healing... So much!!!
---
They are not 5-10x longer....  The fast games are like 7-8 minutes.   Now the average game is like 15 minutes.   You still have the premades winning in 8 minutes, and a lot of games last like 12 minutes, and every now and again you get a turtle that's 45 minutes.
---
 I practically developed the let them win strat.   It made sense when the queue was 6 minutes long.  Then the pve servers, predominantly alliance, got exalted, and didn't queue nearly as much.
---
They could have nice things: on a pve realm or rp pve realm.
---
This comment chain has no mention of QSR, only freezing band.

Quite the opposite actually, I keep on winning but it‚Äôs pointless because no one notices.

How come when I Shadowburn a target that subsequently dies in under 5 seconds, and I cast Drain Soul before it dies, I don't get both a refunded Shadowburn shard and an additional new shard?
---
Buzzword is a buzzword
---
Perhaps I should have phrased that better. Even if it were possible for them to detect all bots, it would not be worth the effort of doing so. All they need to do is exert the minimum amount of effort required to keep bots from becoming *too* much of a problem. Essentially sweep the problem under the rug.
---
Also, on the flip side, bots inject raw resources and gold from sources that players would normally find too menial to farm into the economy.
---
Did I state otherwise? To each their own was the message!
---
&gt;Your dps doesnt come from how well you play your class
---
\*laughs in slam macro warrior\*
---
Can you explain this like I‚Äôm 8
---
You can reset it a 5 times in 1 hour before you get locked out. If you're going for the veins, resetting is convenient since you're right at the exit. If you want to reset in the middle of any instance solo, get in a party with an alt (have someone invite your alt), log off and reset on your alt. It takes a couple of minutes for your alt to become party leader automatically.
---
They cant. I've realized that my early losses was due to premades now. Without premades the horde seems to win all the time. So if you're an ally without premades, tough luck. 
---
In non premade games, the allys start with 25 Men due to 15 dodges from premades. 10-15 defend Galv where we wipe the 20ish rushers and its game over.
---
I only spam Flash Heal and Renew with the 3/3 improved talent so I can overwrite other priest's renew. What is this Shield you are talking about?
---
It used to scale, but that was nerfed during vanilla because hunters could solo world bosses in healing gear. I assume it's the non-scaling versio in classic, but don't know for sure.
---
You can enter through UBRS...
---
No need to be mad about you being carried.
---
Getting shards in bgs is super easy, getting an extra shard in between them isn't a big deal.
---
As others said it‚Äôs totally fine for druids, paladins, shamans etc. to wear the lower type of armour since stats matter. But the thing is - it‚Äôs not fine for tank and retri paladins to roll for your healing gear in the first place. I would maaaaybe get over with tank taking it for off-spec since there is indeed a shortage for tanks, but if retri paladins did it in my group, I would just leave. Not only do they go in meme spec, but also steal a loot from healer - this is bullshit.
---
Southshore (hillsbrad foothills) is good for 30 alliance. A bit higher and you can do the northern STV quests, and early parts of the scarlet monastery dungeon. Finish duskwood if you haven't already.
---
No ranker is killing level 30s
---
Yeah after 6 AV losses in a row last week, its back to hoj and SGC farming for me. And given how most 60s are done with BRD, i get to be the OP player helping players get their last few levels. Its actually pretty fun!
---
I am SM/Ruin since Level57 and I always am pretty much top caster in our Raids. I don't do anything outside of Raids but DS/Ruin seems like a total gimp-specc.
---
I do it with sm/ruin, i find drops give about 40g/hr and 10g/h from herbs.
---
I pull her with sbolt, run around the big rock, she will get close so send in voidwalker around the ramp area, dont let him walk behind her incase she fears it. After dustfield on the ramp you can sometimes Dodge the rock throw behind small rock. Juggle in/out with vw. You can use target og target to see if she throws rock at you or vw, if she throws at you then jump and turn side towards her(cant Dodge with back turned)
---
The Key is just juggling vw in a decent way
---
Lol don‚Äôt spoil the fun here. Probs a new player that got some random drop and just equipped it..
---
If you can program a bot to farm gold it‚Äôs be incredibly stupid to program it to equip whatever it finds. If anything it‚Äôs easier to not program it to equip things so you can check all the dropped stuff later. Even people who not will check back every day or so. Even if he did want to equip items, should be pretty easy to not equip purples
---
Depends on your server. If you play on a highly populated one it's no issue.
---
There's literally dozens of us!

We are still in the early game. Only MC and Ony.

Both probably, see how on the start of the red section there's an accelerated, significant decline of auctioned items

I was so excited to see someone generating a story with actual in game footage (holy shit!),

more characters, more body language, and then you guys started blowing my fucking mind!

second of all the wow classic forum is a safe place to practice being bad for a while, till you polish your craft. (something we all need but few can find).
---
For instance: at 3:13 forward the voice actually switches which character is moving their hands while talking for about 5 seconds.  Is disorienting,
---
Solo farm what exactly? And it's not like warriors are even the worst 1v1 class... Shamans have it worse lol.

OMG THATS THE POINT OF THE SONG

Dandelion is trying to improve geralts standing with regular people, so he writes this song basically saying how he's the coolest guy ever and you should pay him. Did you even watch the show?
---
And switched guilds. :P

Then your furys are shit.

A normal Def tank can't do shit compared to a raid /Bis equipped fury right now.
---
Christmas is for the family, friends, girlfriend. A lot of people like me stop playing during this time and come back on the second week of January.

The titles are proof though, since you cant turn them off in classic.

Classic wow is very hard /s
---
As a spriest, is there a way to see the shadow weaving damage i provide to the warlocks during raid?
---
I downloaded warcraft logs but havent figured out how to make it work yet. Is that simply what i need to track my contribution?
---
What other metrics should i track? Shadowing weaving up time?
---
Always looking to improve but being the only one in the raid makes it difficult to compare my progress/contributions
---
Our dedicated enh shaman who was planned to get the first hand of ragnaros couldnt come one night. This was because he had to go to a work party.
---
Hand of Ragnaros dropped.
---
Defense stacking tanks are automatically shit. Wear threat gear if you are losing aggro to warrors. Dont make top performing rogues and warriors unable to play their class because you want to live out your fantasy of being a big beefy tank with infinite defense lol...
---
2 weeks in the USA. In Germany it is at least one month if you want to quit a job.
---
Idk if I maybe missed it, but I think adding that we can summon ourselves could be helpful to new locks.
---
&gt;now that we're here it is indeed just as shit as I remembered. 
---
So it's accurate.   I hope you realize that for every one thing you loved about vanilla, a hundred people hated that thing.  If we were all allowed to omit things we didn't like, and keep things we did, there would have never been a classic because you'll never get 100% agreement on anything.  Your complaint is the manifestation of what J. Allen Brack was talking about when he uttered those immortal words.  Accept the game for what it is - an imperfect game from 2005 that a very different group of gamers in 2019 is having their way with, and come to peace with that.
---
EU here and no, been on since 8 am and no DC's
---
this is one of the main attributes of the game - meeting and chatting. ppl need to get this
---
You will always have 1% chance to miss that cant be avoided with +hit
---
Reading the comment over and over trying to remember if there was a reptile only healing spell called mend scales.
---
Really what annoys me the most are all the people who just stop appearing without saying anything. We are already at our third maintank because the other two stopped logging in. At least say something so we can delete your DKP and equip a new person.
---
Fury prot tank and itemize for threat.
---
My guess at this point is that they're not willing to commit the resources to eliminate botting from the game.  I have a suspicion that the people in the most prominent positions of power at Blizzard resent classic.  They were okay with releasing it, especially if it increases the sub numbers - but they are not okay with diverting resources to it for maintenance/health of the game.
---
My bad, it's been more than 10 year, I remembered that wrong
---
Last raid I was in there was a hemo rogue and serpent sting knocking off those juicy spriest debuffs
---
Well they went from 1-60 being unable to hold aggro, why would they expect it here either?
---
Im triggered. Theres so many fucking boomers that wanna live out the good old days of wearing 999999 defense in deep prot and doing under 100 dps. At the expense of every melee dps in the raid.
---
only thing ive ever played is shadow priest its a real MaN build
---
You're doing arm and cath or grave and lib?

The idea that not everyone agrees on everything therefore nothing should change is idiotic. Not a lot more to be said there.

Nope

They haven't done any in classic.   Hell, they wouldn't even need to ban anyone.   They could just bluff and say they're banning people that are botting AV at night.

You should have gotten your 60% mount at lvl40! I was nearly revered with Darnassus when I reached 60 and waited until got Exalted before I bought a Epic Mount.

Is the attunement quest for BWL only available once BWL is out (basically when phase 3 is out)? I'm talking about [Blackhand's Command](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=7761/blackhands-command) quest which is started from a letter that drops from one of the mobs in front of Blackrock Spire's entrance.
---
&gt; I guess you thought you did, but you didn't.
---
Averages one per hour? When is he getting more than one per hour? If he's getting two in different zones on the hour he's a herbalist god...
---
Yep, exactly this.
---
It does, I had absolutely dogcrap melee on my hunter (just a random low level 2h with like 4 agi on it) and at the end of Library I ended up with an "of nature's wrath" green offhand item and the Hypnotic blade from Doan on a greed roll so i equipped them and got to test it personally. Mend Pet has a 1.0 total nature spell power co-efficient spread across all ticks.

My guild has the NA 6th fastest mc clear time horde side. Required stacked consumes (including casters flasking), worldbuffs (including songflower), and skill.
---
Is ZF graveyard solo farm still mages best  solo gold per hour?  I have herb as well.
---
&gt; any fearing will likely aggro even more... including the stable master
---
How is this any different of a potential unique downside when the same could be said if you had someone fear Alliance as they run through the front gate area mounted?
---
&gt; and wtf terrain advantage you'Re talking about? the horde base is a joke, frostwolf GY is in the middle of an open field
---
It's interesting that in all of your separate replies, you never mention the most important defensive chokepoint the Horde have, which is second only to the bridge for Alliance. That being IBGY, which also pretty much protects Galv and IBT. There is literally no other way into Horde territory than that narrow path, which is swarmed by archers, 6 LTs elites (7 if we include TP) between IBGY and Galv, etc. 
---
You can then set up another, albeit possibly weaker chokepoint at FWGY, where there are only 2 ways in (the narrow front or hopping the fence on the side), both of which require you to run the same narrow path forward. Hell, you can actually ignore FWGY because you also have the third best defensive point in the game after it.
---
The last half of the base is your last line of defense and is an exceptional one at that, given what you have before it (namely IBGY). Two towers, both having archers that pelt Alliance that are running up, running past, or running into the towers to the flags within. A narrow path that is REQUIRED to be used to advance forward with not enough room to avoid any meaningful AoE (Hunter traps, Mage Blizzard, etc). A narrow entrance with, to be fair, a side part around the wood gate that takes you right into the group of Horde that are often on D there... i.e. generally free HKs for Horde. The space is narrow enough that you really can't sneak by unless you're stealth and even then, it's not unusual to be close enough to get detected.
---
Even in single pull exploits for Drek, which involves tanking him near the reset point, one fear is generally enough to reset him. If you are indeed losing a lot of your AV matches, short of it always being premades (which I do pity you for if true), it's the Horde players being bad that's losing your matches. And even if it is, apparently people do still win some against premades using the tried and true defensive advantages Horde have in their own territory.
---
As a side note, it is hilarious to me to see Horde treat Alliance doing premades as though it's something new. [As though it were something the Horde themselves didn't popularize.](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/4044465077)
---
A month post release?  BS
---
Stam/int in theory should allow you to pull more in one go and generally make you a bit safer.
---
25 days played does not mean they started playing 25 days ago, but that they spent 25 whole days in the game. So they played for 25 * 24 hours.
---
In what content? Solo, hell yes vanilla is horribly unbalanced. Vanilla mechanics could MAYBE support something like 5v5 arena, but fewer players than that would be awful. However I'd say vanilla at the 10v10 and up is actually pretty balanced. Most of the powerful skills can be purged/clensed/dispelled away, and those stuns that can't require that a rogue walk right up to you thus opening themselves to your team beating the shit out of them.
---
if only douchebags like you had a reason for existing
---
Why? Lots of people are doing this...
---
I had the Star of Mystari until I got teh Choker, but 1 Hit is like 13-14 Spellpower and you could have gotten the 20 Shadowdmg Neck from Scholo which should be better.
---
I have my Mageblade, Choker, but still need the Trinket.
---
No it doesn't.. Reporting them for AFK gives them a debuff that forces them to start PVP combat within a time frame, failing to do so first stops honor gain, and then eventually kicks them regardless of any jump spam.
---
Does mage blade drop often enough? Killed golemagg like 4 times. Still haven't seen it
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say horribly made but from a PVE perspective the game does seem to be figured out.
---
See [my post from last week.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/edf0gv/playing_av_since_day_1_made_me_realize_my_faction/)
---
Alliance absolutely needs to defend at least a little with a group of 5 - 10 due to horde actually defending and slowing alliance down.
---
Does mage blade drop often enough? I still haven't seen it. I really want one
---
That‚Äôs a yes
---
Yea, I am 24 actually
---
99% of all problems during p2 were caused by playing on inauthentic overpopulated megaservers.  blizzards fault for fundamental changes, not wpvp's problem.  the vanilla-sized realms were the definition of perfect
---
Oh yeah that's true the scholo neck is 20sp, which is better than 1% hit. But the drop rate is pain
---
Is it now? Its technically not against TOS to look at your screen once every 10 minutes and jump.
---
I didn't have it either, we had so many Choker Drops that most Casters have it by now.

I'm away from my computer, but you need to add a line or two to cancel Predatory Strikes and Leader of the Pack.

Always love those ‚Äúokay I completed my goal now I‚Äôll just finish the hour out‚Äù because you think you have a little luck and end up getting a nice drop, congrats!
---
The first fight in BWL REALLY separates the men from the pugs in my opinion. Even in our relatively-coordinated guild we spent hours banging our heads against the wall getting the kite path down not to mention the controller orb. Furthermore, isn't the second boss in BWL a gear check? Many pugs probably aren't up to the task unless they're very well geared
---
Honor farm won't be endless. As bots/multiple account users would get their bans and phase 3 comes out dominating factions would return to world PvP. Then it will happen again during late p4 - early p5, when most eligible PvPers would finish grind, get their r14 items and start bloodbath all over in Silithus. 
---
Plague lands in P6 traversing would be especially horrible for faction in minority who would try to preserve all world buffs to break walls in their halted Naxxramas progression.
---
Weapon drops are obviously a huge upgrade but most of your dmg comes from a) consumables and world buffs and b) everyone in the raid doing huge dps so kill times are low for maximum dps. 
---
Im a rogue and i have pretty good gear but no weapons. I still use Sword of Zeal (MH) and Mirahs Song (OH) and still able to do ~1000 DPS on bosses like Lucifron or Gehennas and 700-800dps on single target bosses that die fast.
---
Our raid is pretty decent but not as good as some top raids. We only raid with 30-35 people and it certainly shows in kill times and overall DPS. 
---
What im trying to say is, weapons certainly help but you can do top DPS without them.
---
&gt;Why? Lots of people are doing this..
---
You're right, lots of people are thinking they will make rank 14.  Not many will actually make it, but lots of people think they will.
---
I stand corrected
---
One would think that afk bots would be easily detectable who knows maybe one day they‚Äôll all be banned and you‚Äôll get 2 ranks
---
Actually, it does. :) This is from curseforge. [Immersion screenshot](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/immersion/screenshots)
---
Not being able to play with friends if I switch to a different sever is why I want to stay. It's just not feasible for them to follow me around so I don't get ganked on repeat.
---
Yea I saw him cheat multiple times in the duel tourney, no one else "forgot" the rules.
---
Who said that was against ToS?
---
I made a very different claim. You just think you are smarter than you are. Using a randomizer is very easily detectable, devs just choose not to bother and engage in this cat and mouse game beyond larger ban waves.
---
U/uwuwizard
---
Boo
---
You get rep for flag caps so losing 2-3 is better than 0-3 makes a big difference
---
This is why I left , I had the most fun just leveling and this rank grind just fucked me. Classic honor system sucks for me because I can‚Äôt handle live and grinding I just can‚Äôt.
---
PvE shadow raid spec represent!
---
ARCANE SHOT BUILDS ARE NO JOKE
---
Uh why not? An afker is someone who doesn‚Äôt know about the bot or is too scared to use it. They‚Äôre the same thing. At least the botter might eventually get a nice ban.
---
Just let em know sometimes. Like "hey you're taking away the equivalent of another person's damage knock it the Fuck off."
---
Priests are precious und must be protected. No matter if they heal or deal dmg, priests are a locks best friend. Love you all.üòò
---
See tabbard? That's a tabbard of someone who is fucking ready
---
So like every other piece of gear...
---
This. Blizzard should have changed WSG to be better honor. This would change everything as people would have to actually put at least some effort into getting their rank.
---
I found this and used it on my original main Mage back in Vanilla. I told the dude who got me into WoW because I was so excited to get such a good piece of gear as a world drop, and he then informed me it was twink gear and I could have made an assload of gold selling it. Ah well.
---
Welcome to classic pvp ranking. You either bot or account share the same it was 15 years ago.
---
I'd say druid would get you faster groups because you could tank or heal, but it's damn near impossible to beat how fast warrior tanks get invites.
---
The fact that all of them have scout rank makes me think this guy boosts the brackets by getting 15hks on every account
---
People rolling on a mageblade...... this better be a pug. If not, find a guild with an actual loot system that respects it's members.
---
i play high pop (shazzrah EU) and ive been trying to find groups for scholo/strath for days with no luck
---
Honestly even with shit gear, a protection tank can hold aggro on 600dps if he's got his rotation down.
---
I was, this is very much the same game from back then, but it is just that; a game now.   
---
While still enjoyable, Classic showed me that what made Vanilla special was the naive hopefulness of it all back then. It was like going to your first con, to have enjoyed something completely on your own and to walk into a world full of people who all thought that shit was cool, even if it faded quickly.  
---
Classic is mostly populated by people gaming the game, can't think of any better example than that asmon guy that is top streamer. That generally was a minority, now hyperbole is held up as something to be emulated.
---
Thank you for the reply
---
man i upvoted all your messages. you are god demm right. those fuckin walking siege towers ruin  fun of so many dps. I see then even in 5 ppl. He wear full t1 deff trinks and deff jewelry in 5 fuck 5 ppl. bloody dickheads.
---
You‚Äôre investing time to respond. You clearly have some care for the subject. Doesn‚Äôt matter if you spend .0000000000001s caring about it, you still did.
---
dude warrior's pre bis was pretty much all leather, and pallies wear almost all cloth. Armor doesnt really matter.
---
afkers aren't against the rules
---
Yes, the up time on shadow weaving will be a good measure.
---
wtf are you talking about? just learn how to push buttons as a tank.all those morrons are lazy stupid palyer who does not want to become better and proceed to just spam sunders as fckn bot.
---
the way it was meant to be played was to win, and people are mad at you for not doing that.
---
dungeon leveling is pretty dead on most servers, you spend WAY too long trying to find a good group
---
I mean, where did he say people aren‚Äôt doing that? He said ‚Äúif they are AND complaining‚Äù. Read the comment, perhaps?
---
What a legend.
---
Salty tanks thinking they are gods gift to earth for existing downvoting. Thankfully im in a guild with good tanks now.
---
Speaking as someone who's been no lifing way too hard, this guy is probably having way more fun with the game. I think this is awesome
---
As slliance about 3400
---
Man, you‚Äôre just full of angst in every comment I see your name attached to. Go outside, dude.
---
winning isn't exactly the point of AV though
---
Carrot I think is +3%, mithril spurs are another +4%, and I forget what the riding gloves enchantment is but I think it's at least another +3%. Add them all up and it's pretty significant difference.
---
Use an add-on like 'item rack' and you can automatically set it to swap on those items when you mount up.
---
what kind of trash botting tool are ppl using nowaday? all of them i know from the past had some kind of option to not equip boe‚Äòs...
---
What percent of guilds actually have both bindings though? We‚Äôve been raiding since like week 3 and have no bindings but 3 eyes...
---
This is way too long. I don‚Äôt need to see you log in and out and ride across WS. I get on Reddit while I‚Äôm in the bathroom. Your video should be no longer than it takes to use the bathroom unless it‚Äôs really great. 
---
I have no idea what even happened because by the time you got to CDR I was wiping. I‚Äôm guessing you killed them. Okay. Next time edit so you cut all the unnecessary stuff.
---
Of course they are. That‚Äôs why you can report people AFK. Blizzard will literally ban them too if they catch them doing it. You can fish in AV and that‚Äôs fine but you can‚Äôt just go AFK and avoid the kick out.
---
I rolled a 94 and lost, gotta love rng
---
What is your ap and crit chance when you do 1000dps? And what is your total damage and how long was the fight?
---
Yup, for about a week after BGs I don't think I was attacked once. Then as people finished their AV rep grind and Horde queue times climbed, I started seeing more and more. Now flight paths are getting camped again.    
---
    
---
OP, you missed your window. Things are starting to suck again.
---
I disagree If you‚Äôre talking about efficiency.
---
The best run in SM imo as a warrior is to skip trash right to the cath church door, clear out the church and the two bosses. 
---
You need to DE the two blues to max gold.
---
The would at least need to pay 3G each to make up the gold loss of having to kill twice as many guys. I‚Äôve guessed it would take about 15g each run in additional gold from the lowbies to make it worth it.
---
And yet nobody can show me a stat is better than spirit.  The math is about drain life for mana/health regen and a set scenario.  If it could somehow account for all variables, which it can't, I'd be more impressed.  I'll continue laughing at the poor fools and think spirit is a bad stat.  Of course I shouldn't be surprised.  Most warlocks I run into (even at 60) are terrible at mana/dps management.  Sometimes black and white is easier.
---
I'm not some fool with it comes to leveling a warlock.  I had an entire spreadsheet breaking down mana efficiency and fight length that I used to help decide which spells I would use on a given fight.  Obviously drain life generates more mana/hp (especially when combined with spellpower).  But that's not so when you have 3 mobs bashing on you and your drain life maybe gets a tick, or when the mob is always dead and you won't get much of your drain life cast.  These scenarios were eliminated in "the math" based on generic assumptions.
---
You could try Strat Undead first pulls. It's better with dual mage than mage + priest.
---
Blizzard + holy nova to kill all the pulls and the gold plus items for you.
---
I ran warrior + priest in Maraudon farm. Since I am doing pvp with the warrior I am farming DM:East whip lashers with the priest. Not As good as Maraudon but each 3 mins PI, Inner Focus and spam nova.
---
The rare set requires 4 piece for that set bonus, the warlord set requires 3. So its impossible to have it twice.
---
&gt;Feels like people are trying to reinvent the wheel of a 15 year old game. 
---
Sometimes it's fun to use what you want instead of upholding extremely linear BiS upgrade paths.
---
If a mage can solo a jump run you can bring the priest with extra professions and help make it faster with heals
---
Only you can decide if it‚Äôs ‚Äúworth it‚Äù for a slight speed boost. I have an addon item rack swap it on and off for me automatically. With mithril spurs, carrot, and glove enchant it‚Äôs noticeable. If no one else is killing the elites then yes it will require at least a few other party members to kill the elites
---
Cute! Can someone tell me the addon that changes the font like that pls? :)
---
What are you talking about? One of those sets requires 3 pieces and the other 4 lol
---
For MC? What a waste of money
---
Yeah but they didn't get the alliance warlock to stand on the boat with his voidwalker. Low effort, 3/10.
---
Had a guildie who saved up gold and skipped their 60% mount, to buy a raptor 100% mount (and they were orc, so they had to grind the rep).
---
was really annoying doing anything in the world with them
---
Both robe upgrades looks even worse.
---
I just wear my t1 chest/shoulders around town anyways. You should too! ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Il spend the gold to have fun idc. I can always make more gold.
---
Or maybe just eat plants instead. There is absolutely no need to eat animals.
---
The only reason is because you value 5 mins of taste more than the live of another living sentient beeing.
---
Ring of spell power getting replaced with bwl sage your luck for toep and rag choker
---
Lol what? No warrior should be tanking in full defense gear. That‚Äôs just stupid as all hell. Threat is what matters. You should spend time in Fight Club and pick up a few things. Fury warriors aren‚Äôt at the point yet where they should always get Aggie over a good tank. Sometimes an unlucky wind fury early on will get it but that‚Äôs it.
---
It's for a Heal Pet Build
---
There‚Äôs a legit farming strategy with spell damage hunters though.
---
I think in the earlier days of a server there is a TON of stuff that was more relevant for leveling, or for folks that were totally broke. 
---
People throwing up linen cloth, peacebloom, etc that just gets vendor'd now.  if you are leveling an alt with gathering profs there is zero point to keep some materials because they simply have no value other than just vendoring.  Why waste your time trying to list peacebloom or silverleaf for example for like, 5 copper profit per item, when you can just get on your main, kill 2 mobs and have 5-10silver profit from each one?
---
I did that with my first in Vanilla; found the Dazzling Longsword. Logged out, made a rogue, leveled him, and immediately equipped it.
---
He's probably just new. I did the same on my hunter (not that staff tho)
---
Yea they hit for 3k each so unless your a tank you‚Äôre gonna get 2-shot if you‚Äôre unlucky and get targeted twice.
---
I have several spells on one macro on my lock, but can't seem to do it on my warrior due to the change in stances
---
There
---
What is turtling?
---
Paladin is kind of boring to level. The silver lining is you don‚Äôt really die much though. It‚Äôs just one long, consistent grind. No real major power spikes but you never feel weak either.
---
Yep and you know rolling against 15 other casters for it, probably won‚Äôt happen anyway
---
Here is a log (its a bit old but it was the first i was able to find)
---
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/fpn3dBNg1VY4AhXm#fight=13&amp;type=damage-done 
---
Im the rogue Isnou. Its a 53second fight good kills are easily 20-30seconds faster which would be even more DPS. You can see my gear when you hover over my ilvl... its basically pre bis gear with 2 epics.
---
Anime avatar weeb telling someone else to go outside, lmao.
---
Ngl having meme specs in my raid that actually min max sounds pretty fun. Hard to find players willing to put in the time to do it though.
---
No question just wanted to let everyone know how dumb I am. 
---
I've leveled a feral druid from day 1 of classic. This is my main character and gearing for feral is weird so I actually spent a pretty good amount of time reading about it and planning. I even found a super cool guild that lets me do average dps as a feral cat. 
---
I specced into Omen of Clarity but almost immediately noticed it wasn't proccing. I remembered when I played druid in BC it would just proc on its own and show up as a buff. I figured it just didn't show up visually, but eventually realized I definitely wasn't getting free spells at all. 
---
I did like...4 or 5 MC raids like this. I definitely wondered about it a few times but wasn't super concerned. Finally last night right in the middle of the raid I got fed up and decided to figure it out. Turns out there's definitely a buff in my spellbook that I have to cast on myself in order to get it to proc. Oops....
---
On my realm warriors and mages both sell SM runs for 1-4g per run per person. I've been charged as little as 1g by warriors when I levelled my shaman since I had WF and healed them. Warriors typically charge 2-3g,but the runs are slower compared to mages. Mages charged the most, usually 3-4g but they don't need any help and speed run it. This is the norm for my realm and business booms. All day every day you can walk into SM and there will be handfuls of people, lowbies or level 60s all selling or buying services.
---
Spriest is the boss of this gym!
---
I‚Äôve seen horde get 5800 bonus honor in a 45 minute game earlier
---
This is the opposite sentiment of most users. Most classic players would not go to retail for any reason. It is a completely different game.
---
Yeah man. I remember that magic moment when I found my first purple in classic classic. It was a bit of a rush, and I didn‚Äôt look at the stats or market price before equipping it either. Rookie mistake, but good for him!
---
It's worth mentioning that you have to buy the expansion for retail, since the game doesn't really start until end-game.
---
After 9 weeks of losing rolls in a +1 system (still top dps without epic weapon and such) my guild swapped to loot council and our first raid two toeps drop I get one and I‚Äôm also set to get first mageblade and aside from that and tone of volatile power I can‚Äôt get anything else from this phase so I‚Äôll be able to convince them to give me the first rag choker
---
since alliance is 50% mages and 50% warriors i don‚Äôt even get a single chain lightning out.
---
The 'assist' key also does the same thing automatically. I think default key bind is f. Click tank press f you're good to go
---
The sheer number of people who don't realize this startles me.
---
I'm pretty sure the case of my server isn't applicated on others, but we don't roll for sub armors unless you announced it before even enter the dungeon. The usual rule we have is asking before "can I need this for my offspec if nobody needs?" and if everyone agreeds nice.
---
Common sense isn't common anymore, you as a warlock can't roll on leather or mail, so they should give priority to the cloths first.
---
I just sold one earlier that I got off azuregos
---
Sting spec bro.
---
I feel like if you‚Äôve never played it before, the chance to experience the game as we all did when it first released is a rare opportunity. You should level a classic character to 60 before even touching retail. If you end up liking retail more, you‚Äôll still have respect for the actual challenge that the game used to be.
---
You get good at hiding.  Don't be near roads, try to kill stuff you need that's away from common hubs, and level as efficiently as you can.  Depending on the class and faction you play there may be other things you can do, but the most important things are to find a spot where you don't see anyone else much and just keep killing things.
---
Nah robe of volatile power looks nice unlike robe of void
---
Have u ever tried not spending any gold lol. Don‚Äôt buy skills or gear or consumes just do a few dungeons and u got it
---
Consumables and world buffs
---
On the one hand botting is bad. 
---
On the other hand having things prevent people from ruining their lives by grinding rank 14 is good. 
---
Hard to say if this is really an issue or not given we as a community should be shaming those who actually go for rank 14.
---
So you want arms main tanks, shadow priest healers, SL locks and pom-pyro mages? I'm not even sure you could clear MC with that at all.
---
Yet there are still queues to get into my server at peak times. Game may not be what you expected, but it's far from dead
---
Better class for solo pvp - ret paladin or arms warrior?  I'm talking casual solo queue battlegrounds.
---
Yeah, their dps is horrible due to classic balance being shitty. We knew this coming in though.
---
if you want to get all the way to cap sure...you don't need to do that though, what is it 110 you can get to without?
---
There's no way a thorium spike on a shield would be better than just using two weapons or a 2h
---
Re-roll allaince, with premades I beat bots playing 6 hours a day.
---
Windfury totem, world buffs, cleave (focus luci while cleaving adds) and big cooldowns like recklessness. A raid that consists of people that all do a ton of dps so that you are only fighting for a very short amount of time helps a lot too. This way your "DPS" is actually just a 30 second damage burst instead of a sustained damage over the course of a longer battle. Most of these claims are just damage meter padding. It's like a mage claiming to do 800 dps on Onyxia because their raid pulled 50 whelps and they aoe'd them all down or some shit.
---
Does anyone enjoy retail leveling? It doesn't sound like OP is interesting in leveling either, mostly talking about end-game.
---
I‚Äôve had the same hunter bot on my winterspring herb route who kills the owlkin in the north east of the map he‚Äôs been there three weeks since I reported him and it‚Äôs an obvious bot because his movements are precise and repetitive
---
Hahaha good capture. Much Classic.
---
I can get around it in a 1v1 situation in most cases by making them break it early and working from there. Problem is that 1v1 situations are rare in pvp and taking on more than 1 undead at a time is very difficult,  im not saying it's impossible but it is much more difficult as an ally. There is a reason very few people roll ally warlocks and there is a reason every warlock pvp video is from a horde lock.
---
Alot more people rolled undead when classic was released this year than what most of were expecting and I would think it was because of WOTF. Im not saying you can't have fun as an alliance warlock , im just saying you will have a much harder time in pvp, 
---
I have rolled both a undead and gnome warlock (both 60) and i can say that in my experience playing horde has been dramatically easier for me.
---
^this lol. As a hunter, I just spent 165g on consumes/spec. Will need to spend 50g to go back in farm spec tonight.
---
But I farm as much as I can stomach, and I usually make about 70g/h in DMT, so that's like 3 hours out of my week. Hardly a lot.
---
Definitely noticeable at 60 when wpvp was at the height of its popularity. I had the carrot, Spurs and glove enchant and my friends only had the trinket. 
---
They all ended up getting caught as I got away. It‚Äôs noticeable imo. You can also see it in AV with the massive Zerg out of the gate. 
---
I enjoy using it to catch people and get a concussive shot it but that‚Äôs just preference
---
Just remember to switch it back before pve shit otherwise you might fight Onyxia with only 5% hit and a carrot
---
do The Expanse next, that's an easy 600g then.
---
Alliance are too busy getting split on the way to galv and then wiped by a few mages and then turtling at Stonehearth GY
---
We are having the same thing now on Ashkhandi US
---
Tried out gunbreaker yet? DPS levels of rotation in a tank. It's amazing when played to perfection.
---
I had to wait 37min this morning to get in to AV // EU Horde
---
Well, we know about classic because we've been playing retail for so long. So much information is available on wowhead, set to 'classic.' There are leveling guides, class guides, and you can look up all the quests to see where they fit. 
---
For myself, the learning is part of the experience. And yes, original and classic wow are both time-sinks--there are very good psychological reasons they kept players running instead of riding, riding instead of flying, over much longer maps than the same zones now have in retail. It slows the pace of the game to give you the opportunity to learn the class of character you're on. 
---
For me, it's the journey, not the destination. I got burned out on both raiding and dungeons on retail; it's rare that anyone stops and chats any more in the LFG system, and I'm too old and don't have the reflexes or mental energy any more to keep up with my guild's raid group.
---
I've found that at least on the non-pvp servers I play on, a lot of other players are also on the journey. They don't mind answering questions or helping out. The retail game is pretty much a solo effort to level up, because no one needs or wants any help.
---
I‚Äôm 3 pieces away from having all the Mc gear I need I‚Äôm excited for bwl
---
wows version of sand casino nice
---
I thought you couldn't use both trinkets at the same time?
---
They do bot bans in waves to save like 10$, every 3-6 month apart they will ban all accounts for 6 months... wont even effect rankings much they don't remove them from the brackets they just can't play anymore and slowly lose rank.
---
you underestimate me. i put alot of effort in my pvp gear (im playing druid). i got all relevant trinkets for pvp and by all i mean i camped 20hrs for tidal charm, farmed my AGM and leveled BS for the 30sec fear immunity trinket. Ofc i got the 100% mount and i will hit rank 7  next week. 
---
still the "big rankers" from my server dont even bother to reply my whispers. if youre not part of 3 particular guilds you're not getting into their premades. the crossserver premade i encounter when soloqueueing arent really responsive either, even if i follow the calls and everything, in the end im just a druid and noone wants me except when playing wsg.
---
Actual room temperature IQ player above me
---
Same issues on my server. I wonder How long We have to wait and How much rank points Will be wasted before bannwave
---
We had three people roll 100 once on the Onyxia bag and then one of them one with another 100.
---
Crit/hit have approximately 12 Dps value when you have a fair amount of gear. Plus damage is a one to one along with plus shadow. Stats do virtually nothing except keep your mana pool up and you still breathing. 
---
Most spreadsheets only show the top few to aim for all the other stuff will get replaced rather quickly. 
---
Look for felcloth gear in ah. Posts for rod of ogre magi from dm n trib. The is from a chest so sometimes you can get someone selling it to let you in instance and loot for 25g. Brd is where you will start to see items show up on the spreadsheet possibly with golem boots, interrogator cloak and sash from arena ogre
---
Good luck
---
It's about multi target vs single target strategy. Also killing single bosses in under a minute. It's not impossible to burst 1000 dps on a single target, it's impossible to sustain it.
---
Also windfury is something like 20% of Horde warrior dps.
---
On the maximum price thing, in that tab below set it so "when above max price, list as max price." Currently from your screenshot I see it says normal price
---
Also set when below minimum to don't post. No point selling when its worth 70% value
---
Good way to clear out people who don't know what they are doing.
---
No changes kekw
---
Ah, must have missed that somehow. Damn.
---
What even is this question.
---
But he would get that solo, the 4 lvl 30s aren't really contributing anything to the lvl 60 clearing the instance.  This is a nice thing for him to do, but he could make a few extra gold from it if he so chose.
---
But in the world how can you tell?
---
Coming from a meme spec PUG raid yesterday: yes, you can clear MC nice and chill.
---
Yeah I keep seeing people talking about how they only raid log now. Like ok, that's cool for MC, but do you have a few thousand gold to sustain your consumables for the rest of classic?
---
They give dkp to members who can BRM on Tuesday
---
Depends on how much of the instance you‚Äôre pulling at once. The massive defensive bonus of a shield, along with healing and damage on items like Skullflame make it much better for entire dungeon clears.
---
Is there any point in hanging onto Globe of Water or Elemental Water?
---
I can't, so maybe the video guy can or it was just a lucky guess.
---
Yeah, safespotting I agree is bannable. 
---
The thing that makes running over the hill more of an exploit than pulling the bosses solo for me is that running over the hill mounted like that wasn't in vanilla. But I still wouldn't call it an exploit just an oversight by blizzard when they remade the game, because lets be honest things aren't exactly perfect, lots of things are different.
---
It‚Äôs still okay on my server since I can actually land at flight points and some sections of zones like winter fall camp aren‚Äôt overloaded with horde
---
Great post
---
Tough to say really. 
---
Classic WoW will hit a content block, but they are going to keep releasing stuff until Naxx, we are currently up to phase 3 out of 6 phases. I would assume that another set of content will come after that (Whether it be The Burning Crusage or Classic++).
---
Classic WoW is slower paced, you will need to run to dungeons, and you will need to save up for your mounts.
---
You would think retail WoW would perpetually add new content, however there are fairly large content droughts at the moment. When Shadow Lands comes out that should change.
---
Retail WoW offers QoL in most aspects. They have auto dungeon queuing, mounts available almost off the bat, linear questing.
---
Contrary to popular belief, end game raiding is considerably more difficult in retail.
---
Retail WoW is becoming a lot more 'cosmetic' driven.
---
I personally like Classic WoW because it has more of a community aspect and the RPG elements appeal to me more. That being said, if you like to be treated more like a 'God' and can't be bothered running to dungeons and saving up 1000 gold for your epic mount, then retail may be for you.
---
We are fairly Classic biased in the sub reddit, so it might be worth doing some of your own research. You may even compare Classic WoW to Runescape Classic, in that they don't have the 'bells and whistles' in which their modern counter parts offer, however those enhancements are what some people think take the life and soul out of the game.
---
I don't really know, since you for the most part only interact with your own server I could only really speak for my own server, which seems very balanced with a great community. I play on Grobbulus-NA. There are some real horror stories around reddit about disgusting faction imbalances so like I said, be careful.
---
Classic wow is for babies compared to AC. Leveling and finding your way through the game is much easier. The pvp system is also much easier to get good at than AC but is still hard to master.
---
Im a warrior. I live inside dme lmao. Its fun though, dme is an awesome gold farm.
---
Wtf is this...?
---
what a rollercoaster of emotion from Aedak
---
I always raid as a hemo in my guild, like mc is so easy it does not really matter.
---
You could clear mc with 40 druids. Do you think the content is hard or something?
---
It's in the picture, dude
---
Mage who is most likely converting to warlock, reason being is warlock tier is often 10dkp vs the 100+mage gear goes for.
---
My warlock is level 55 and i still learned a lot from this. Thanks! Will be referencing this a bunch for the next few weeks great post.
---
That won‚Äôt ever happen though. There‚Äôs at least the realm of possibility that they could buff the honor from WSG. Very small chance but still there none the less.
---
I appreciate this detailed response as well as the others. I had planned to likely post on the main WoW reddit as well to get both sides since I expected people to enjoy Classic more here.
---
Gotcha. Thank you kind person.
---
That path can be circumvented to the right as you reach the gate under the archers and out of sight of the other tower.  You are comparing a 10 yard stretch of a hill and "dismount tower" which can be skipped as well, to a 200 yard bridge for a choke point.  Please.
---
Honor and ranking only, it's not fun spamming premades endlessly it would be fun 2-3 hours for a night but then you are way behind anyone who says it is fun trying to high rank is demented.
---
And a little sad
---
Classic ofc. Don‚Äôt listen to anyone. The people who say there isn‚Äôt enough content play 20 hours a day so yeah sure you probably will burn through the content quicker than others who actually do things outside of the basement at mums.
---
I got my first rag kill (me and the boys and our one lady raider) and it was a blast!!
---
This is why the alliance are at war with the horde.
---
No one forgot anything, the spell power on Striker's Garb was wasted itemization. It was quite literally blizzard not wanting to change attack power mechanics for hunters at the time. Compare Dragonstalker-&gt;Striker's Garb to any other set 2-&gt;2.5 progression. They took itemization away from agility/crit to give to spellpower that didn't work well.
---
Was in that game. Epic as hell
---
Great writeup! A few questions I haven't been able to find any answers to:
---
Is Shadow Mastery and Demonic Sacrifice applied before or after spell power?
---
How much of a dps increase is using Shadowburn on CD over Shadow Bolt only? I've found it depletes my mana quicker and I have to lifetap more. Also Shadowburn takes up a debuff slot for a short duration which might cause something to fall off.
---
Is Cataclysm worth putting points into?
---
If you're raiding as SM/Ruin, are there bosses beyond MC where succubus can be used? I've found her to be viable on Mag and Golemag.
---
If it is not fun to rank why are you doing it?
---
Keep in mind both warlock and mage tier is almost never bis gear outside of pvp.
---
Absolutely love it when a rank 3 player spams ‚ÄúRECALL EVERYONE RECALL‚Äù the whole game
---
&gt;I'm not upset, you're upset &gt;:(
---
Lol I am alliance just seen the other post, this one is WAY more true.
---
Bro read a book
---
I ended up giving some G to the 2 Hunters that stuck around after my kill. My Warlock has a favor of his choice to cash in when he needs it.
---
‚ÄúIf you can‚Äôt do what I do in the game, you‚Äôll fail‚Äù
---
Sounds crowded and laggy, what's the best tank to bring?
---
Good to know, I have tali and choker and was looking to complete the trifecta. Will be passing for sure now.
---
Why dont you make a mc raid full of non "meta" specs? ShOuLd Be EaSy
---
Bots are secretly run by Blizzard as an entrapment method to ban people from classic
---
So can you not have another pally do the summon like a warlock can to save part of that?
---
My Winterspring demon ended up having a nelf rogue and hunter roll up on me. I waited for the inevitable gank during my first pull, but they were chill and let me finish.
---
Feels like 2005 all over again.
---
&gt; It's interesting that in all of your separate replies, you never mention the most important defensive chokepoint the Horde have, which is second only to the bridge for Alliance. That being IBGY
---
cause unlike the stormpike GY choke, alliance have access to snowfall GY right next to IB GY, making push a lot easier.
---
you're also not defending galv or heck even the tower while holding that choke.
---
&gt; when the same could be said if you had someone fear Alliance as they run through the front gate area mounted?
---
if he get a full 8-second fear in the appropriate direction, maybe he'll aggro the NPC next to the forge... that's about it. still miles away from the precise zig-zad horde have to do to not aggro the bounty hunter, corporal, smith and stable master in alliance base.
---
&gt;ou can then set up another, albeit possibly weaker chokepoint at FWGY, 
---
FW GY is in the middle of an open field. not a single obstacle in any direction... it's the absolute weakest 'choke' of all in AV.
---
&gt;he last half of the base
---
yes, the part that LoS itself. it's amazing. totally better than the 200yard stretch where horde are sitting ducks.... /s
---
&gt;As a side note, it is hilarious to me to see Horde treat Alliance doing premades as though it's something new.
---
yeah, good luck doing premade on horde when you have to wait 25 minute before finding out how many of you are in the same AV.
---
Useful, cheers
---
Well, I don‚Äôt know what he bases that claim on, but it might just be true. Whether it is the most efficient way to level, that‚Äôs another thing and I guess most know the answer to that here.
---
My first character back in 2004 was a hunter and boy was I spamming those arcanes and serpents like a real fucking noob is supposed to.
---
ikr, 99% of the times the grey one looks better than the guilds
---
I forget not everyone is a rogue and can walk up to the door where it will target him instantly.
---
Good thing Baron is tauntable
---
Recall item is a waste of bag space... didn't even get.
---
love how even in the clip you choosed to post he had to try 4 times before going up.
---
now try that again with 10 mount blocking eachother view , and add a 2-3 range DPS pelting down on those people.
---
that backdoor is only worthwhile when the alliance doesn't bother defending ( notice how 15-20 horde recall after balinda? yeah, that's the difference).
---
Players quitting. The untold truth nobody talks about is that Vanilla private servers were never a steady thing. It was kept artificially alive with a constant barrage of new servers coming out every few months.
---
* There's always a sharp drop right after people clear MC 2-3 times.
---
* Another sharp drop right after they clear BWL 2-3 times.
---
* Few servers managed to reach Naxx with a viable population... and guilds just implode after clearing Naxx 2-3 times.
---
People think BWL is going to revitalize the game... only to discover it's even shorter than MC and not that much more challenging.
---
Naxx is another beast : People quit not because it's too hard (most guilds will be 12+/15 on release), but because the game is effectively done until TBC.
---
Not sure what kind of world buffs i had because warcraftlogs is a bit bugged with showing worldbuffs. 
---
The log is quite old (over 2 months) but i always get DM buffs and if it works out Ony buff. I usually never bother to get Songflower. 
---
Horde obviously has windfury which sometimes lets you do great DPS and sometimes it just doesn't procc at all. Kings and Might are  way more consistent. 
---
The "Zeal" procc of my sword obviously also makes my white hit damage higher. Not sure what weapon you are using but keep that in mind.
---
Gz, now store it in bank and farm pre bis
---
i was in the same boat as you. I had a lvl 60 gnome lock until i rerolled horde. As for advice i can give if you don't want to reroll is to spec soul link as you won't have any defensive abilities (charm , fear) that you can reliable use except death coil.
---
People will tell you to git gud and so forth but locks don't have many defensive abilities to start with so not having the ones you can use is a major disadvantage.
---
If you haven't got an addon which shows the time left on WOTF i suggest you do that. You can use classicaura duration and tweak the settings. You will also need engineering to stall them while WOTF runs out (grenades, rocket helm , net etc).
---
I see, you have reading comprehension issues likely paired with problems understanding what average is.
---
i'll let you read one of the daily thread about how honor and RP works.
---
&gt; The fact you even think streaming is glamorous
---
You forgot to quote the thing that wasn't said again. Try paying attention, maybe then you'd be as good a player as these streamers.
---
&gt;he was banned for being mentally ill and threatening women. Go figure
---
You're convinced that "the Jews" are stalking you on the internet to censor your opinions and that your posts are a threat to ("Jewish") billionaires, speaking of mentally ill morons who need to be banned (preferably from life).
---
&gt;Because I don't want to make less money than fast food employees which is what most streamers make.
---
You'd make more though because you're SO MUCH BETTER than them! Where's the link to your achievements? SHOW US HOW GOOD YOU ARE IF YOU'RE SO GOOD.
---
The biggest difference I found in both games was the feeling u get in clasic from finishing that quest chain or the rep grind to get ur new gear or even beating others on a roll when u finally win that drop u have been chasing is hella hype. I remember getting a massive upgrade from a boss at lower levels being way more satisfying then the random item power rng u get in retail at max level.
---
For me I'm a daily player but not massive hours so the rng aspect in retail ruins the mmo aspect. If I put the time in to better my guy he should get the rewards from that. And not just because I put  in a hour a week with a horseshoe up your ass. 
---
I do find classic a much more slower paced game where u need to play to advantages in numbers or gear which I loveeeee and small changes and tweaks can impact u alot, where retail I find it's more about who has cooldowns up and gets that lucky crit.
---
Honestly idk at this point I guess for epic armor set and go to casual playing AV 2 hours a day. I do it with every game I play the 100% mentality end result is fun the grind to it is not always so fun.
---
Yeah it isn‚Äôt that not supposed to happen? Or is it just bad luck?
---
If you're pulling 30 mobs there no way a warrior can kill them with 2h fast enough. Whirlwind unfortunatly only affects 4 targets and has a 10sec cooldown. Cleave only affects 2 targets. If you have damage reflection gear i would go with that. If you make small pulls 2h is ok.
---
If that's true, then it was a recent change. At least at launch, pet killing blows worked for the buff -- there is video proof of it. Find me a clip and I'll edit the OP.
---
My God your dumb... your Mt is using a shield and you wonder why he can't hold threat.... Every guild worth a shit is using a fury tank.
---
I have been curious about this, how good is the exp? What exactly gives exp from av?
---
Np
---
Maybe they could use your help?
---
u can kill rag with 30, quit complaining
---
how is this a twin ? you dont have same, hair, skin or facial color...
---
Raid leader just stated corruption is considered a minor debuff and does not count against debuff slots available. Have limited info on this.
---
Update - the priority system of debuffs means corruption will do no harm however if your raid composition has higher priority debuffs your corruption wont stay.  We are allowed to use corruption to replace ‚Äútrash‚Äù debuffs.
---
We run anywhere from 3-6 locks
---
Cut this from a vanilla explanation. Drusin mmo-champion.com
---
Debuffs work on a system of 5 prioritizations. The higher priority debuff will always knock off a lower priority debuff and works upwards from the bottom. A Taunt will try to knock off a trash debuff (Deeps Wounds, Fireball Dot) then a DoT (Corruption, SW:P) then a Medium (Vulnerabilities, Ignite, Vamp Embrace) then a High (Curses, Sunder, Demo, Thunderclap) if the debuff limit has already been reached.
---
Highest:
---
CC / Roots (Sheep / Seduce / Sap / Gouge / Frost Nova etc)
---
Taunt effects (Taunt, Mocking Block) (I've also read somewhere that Taunts get a special bonus debuff slots but can't confirm that)
---
High:
---
Curses
---
Sunder
---
Tclap / Thunderfury
---
Demo
---
Faerie Fire
---
Hunter's Mark
---
Judgements
---
Medium:
---
Vulnerabilities (Winter's Chill, Shadow Weaving, etc)
---
Ignite
---
Gift of Arthas
---
Vamp Embrace
---
Hunter Stings
---
Deadly Poison
---
Mortal Strike
---
Low:
---
DoTs, Longer duration = high priority
---
Trash:
---
Fireball Dot, Deep Wounds, weapon proc debuffs
---
People who actually try to bot to Rank 14 probably don't have much there that can be ruined to begin with.
---
I think most people play by themselves honestly or maybe I'm biased since I seem to have honorable friends &amp; guildies that don't do these things..
---
No, they aren‚Äôt. Go ask in fight club if you should be fury prot right now. Only the top tier guilds, ~5% of the player base, should even begin to need fury prot.
---
To call every guild under that top 5 percentile garbage is just fucking stupid.
---
You mean the raid people were having no trouble clearing with 35+ people? Obviously meme-specs are better than having nobody in the slot instead.
---
I‚Äôm just a healer lmao it‚Äôs never been an issue but always surprising
---
All I'm doing is laughing at your attempt to be on your high horse on reddit of all places. Maybe the truth is neither of us care that much, but that'd be a crazy thing to think on reddit.
---
&gt; epic armor set
---
You need rank 12/13 for that. Right now that's 15 hours/day of PvP'ing.
---
Which of the items I mentioned would you consider warlock prio?
---
I remember in vamilla getting wep enchants just for the colored glow effect, not caring really what the enchant was.
---
Horde love the D
---
My pally mount was less.
---
Some hunter thoughts. Demonic runes are useful and unlisted. Greater Agility Elixir is a clear step down from mongoose but somewhat cheaper. Most of the stuff listed in everyone is overkill besides a GFPP for Rag (and even then ranged can get away with a regular FPP if you‚Äôre downing pre submerge) and bandages. There‚Äôs also the +agi blasted lands consumable that‚Äôs nice as well.
---
Edit: Also the AV arrows are only 1dps less so hunters can save a bit more.
---
I‚Äôm not sure why you‚Äôre so hung up on people ‚Äúcaring‚Äù. People are simply calling out your obvious angst. I‚Äôm not the only one, but you chose to respond to the only message where you have positive karma, so that you fair a better chance. 
---
You‚Äôre obviously up, you obviously have some sort of issue that‚Äôs eating away at you, and I hope you get the help you need.
---
I agree
---
Soup cans. That's perfect!
---
It's funny you mention Fight Club when the consensus there is that fury/prot is good after BWL gear, and that deep prot is better for TPS now.
---
I'm alliance also and it's rough with horde premades, some try to sneak in WSGs between AVs
---
Funny how many people going fury prot pre-BWL.
---
Had 28 people that could make it last night, could've been worse.
---
Not twinks V twinks
---
I had a warrior need on the illusionsary staff before. I lost to him and I was furious. one of those godamn ginger female dwarf warriors.
---
It costs mana and starts the 5 second regen timer.
---
Ony ain‚Äôt gonna drop my helm.
---
that is f'ing badass
---
So what's wrong with x server in the first place? You just wanna get rid of it?
---
The payoff for deep resto is amazing, dude. It's a free mana pot every fight for everyone in your group and +10% heal. Maybe not needed right now, but in later raid tiers you will be forced to respecc because the payoff is big.
---
I don‚Äôt think he was looking at this:
---
https://youtu.be/FxoS4BEiyh8
---
What would you say about endgame RNG aspect? Do both suffer from stat RNG equipment like Tera did (huge turnoff)?
---
I almost feel like twinking ruined 60 BGs for me I‚Äôve started to really appreciate not having mounts in WSG
---
Too many people are being toxic about it, that s what I'm referring to. For example a bit upward in this comment thread there's a pretty good example:
---
"Worst thing about the wow community in general, this fucking meta dicksucking. Chill the fuck out and play what you want."
---
As long as they are civil about it, I fully agree that everybody should be able to approach the game from any angle they want and play how they want and with whom they want.
---
In retail when an item drops it has a chance to turn into I believe 3 levels with titanforging as the best I beleive where basically u would get the same wep as someone else but theres could have been titan forged and urs not. And I think the best way to get these was from a box u could open 1x a week so I was basically getting the required games in to open said box then get fucked then basically do my required games again and so on. 
---
I returned to retail for bfa till 1st raid dropped then quit to play classic private servers in prep for classic so I'm not the most knowledgeable in retail but from what I remeber it was alone these lines.
---
Hah I have the same 2 acc and chars! Power infusion ofc.. My priest is only 51 so haven't thought it true either
---
Demoshout and shieldspikes should be sufficient. I never tested it though. So have fun trying it out :D
---
A mean a ton wear leather, and you can bet your ass if a good enough cloth item DPS wise existed they‚Äôd be all over it too.
---
\&gt; You would think retail WoW would perpetually add new content, however there are fairly large content droughts at the moment. When Shadow Lands comes out that should change.
---
Retail got a patch in October and is set to get another major one in like 2 weeks. I wouldn't call 3 months a "fairly large content drought"
---
If you can sell the 4 open spots to lowbies for XP, then yes.
---
Charge 3-5g per clear, with 4 extra people adds a significant amount of gold.
---
According to Fight Club, it generates more TPS until BWL.
---
Imagine blindly believing the hive mind without researching for yourself.
---
Fraternal Twins, jokes aside, if you really didn't get it, look at the names.
---
Your spellcheck does truly whacky things.
---
Not everything in life is about honorpoints, maybe the rank 3 players wanted to actually go for the win?
---
Thanks for this idea
---
i pulled aggro off golemag during my execute phase this past raid day. that'll teach me to use consumables to pad my numbers.
---
ah yes because classic is all about efficiency and not what anyone enjoys. It‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs a video game for entertainment
---
That makes no sense whatsoever. A debuff is a debuff. Might want to have your raid leader do some more research.
---
a lot
---
You can do that too, just easier to taunt off and more reliable
---
That glo tho
---
Greater Frost Protection Potions come Naxx
---
Atleast it's not bre
---
Interesting metric! Over the long term this should be a pretty nice indicator of player count / player activity.
---
That's wrong. If they are paying **for the loot** they should get it. But paying for the loot would be much much much more expensive than just a few gold pieces. That's the only reason the price is so low - because it's for the experience, not the loot. And considering BWP items are only worth their vendor value to him, they also pay for the opportunity of being able to get some good items cheaply, like OP said.  
---
It's not about whether you pay but what you pay for. Similarly to how if you buy a dinner at a restaurant, you don't get to automatically keep the cutlery and plates. And if you go to a zoo, you don't get to keep a pet lion. Everything is decided by the person that's selling the product - both the price and what it includes. Then people can decide whether they want to buy that product or not.
---
Ain‚Äôt no probably about it, it is.
---
Vendor the BoPs turn the silk into bandages, get the split loot mailed to you (if you trust the runners) - keep the decent greens if you want; scarlet set is worth a little
---
Theres a lvl bracket of BoEs you pick up and some are worth a bit. Its a solid grind a few of my guildies did to help level friends alts and get Lionheart aswell :)
---
If you want difficult raids dont play classic.
---
If you are interested more in the world, a true rpg experience and the joy from doing things with people you know go for classic.
---
Arcane shot has a 46.75% spell power coefficient. 26*.4675=12.55 more damage. Couple that with arcane shots 6 second cd(5 if talented), and you get at most 2.4 dps. It's not good at all. I've seen very few hunters that aren't bots not using something that at least gives agility.
---
Filthy paladin
---
. Dps is a factor of how long fights take, how you do the boss fight, and individual gear and skill.I'm sorry to disappoint you..but if NO ONE breaks 500 dps with world buffs and consummables then that means collectively your raid does not understand the dps rotation for their class.
---
How long does it take to get max rested while in an Inn?
---
Not sure what class I'm leveling to 60 next so I'm thinking I want to work on a few.
---
Ah so if a level 60 runs only 1 level 15 through RFC the xp is gimped?
---
As mentioned in the post I rather be able to handle with randoms/solo content, so that should be fine.
---
He's alliance, nobody cares about DB on alliance.
---
It‚Äôs 4%, but note, many pvp specs use talent to raise their chance to resist.
---
For example, Pallies can take a chance to reduce their chance to be feared by 10% which can be mitigated by spell hit chance
---
Obviously OP is using a bot and covering his tracks
---
This is a great time to start because you'll be 60 for a bit before ZG comes out. ZG is a fun 20-man raid with a lot of catch-up gear, so you can get up to speed quite easily as a new 60.
---
Or, just play casually and hit 60 before TBC comes out. Really the 1-60 leveling is the bulk of the game content, so you can have a good experience even if you never hit max level.
---
I haven't come across any bots yet during AV, anyone that doesnt move or stays in the same place gets kicked.
---
Destroy the other one, loot the new one and sell it. Item restore on the destroyed one
---
Thought that was fixed before vanilla ended due to it being too OP?
---
The GM I talked to said it was a 1-week ban for a first offense. And I don't feel like I have to prove anything to you. Bye bye now.
---
In the years between classic and the reboot WoW turned in to a min-max fest. I remember going to stupid little guild meetups in booty bay and rachet and not having any idea what the stats did and nobody giving a shit or crying about my gear until 60. Now its just powerleveling and murdering everybody you can. Sad day
---
&gt;I've seen some people state that getting the mallet of ZF is easy, and even easy for one player to do on his/her own. But really, I don't see how anyone could get through all those trolls -- many elites -- without at least a full 5-man group (not necessarily with four 60s like we had).
---
Killing the troll that drops the mallet is the only part that requires any work. People corpse hop to the altar to complete it prior to 50 solo.
---
Fair enough.
---
Are you sure? Would be the only one I know doing that then. For priest, WL and mage everything seems to be on top of the total amount, including things like searing light that only affect certain spells. Once my druid is \~40 I'll test that myself then, would throw off the calculations in my addon if this isn't a universal rule :/
---
I'd wager blizzard just implemented the calculation for damage and healing spells differently, so for healing modifiers are applied before bonus healing is added, while for damage it's the other way round.
---
Really? An outrage?
---
Yeah the Chinese.
---
&gt; Get to max range, cast imolate then immediately start running and casting dots. 
---
Minor nit pick: you can cast shadowbolt then cast immolate then dot up as normal, for a free shadow bolt worth of damage
---
What is this garbage. Even if tps is slightly higher with protection...the goal of fuey prot is you have. 400-500 dps tank rather than a 200-300 dps tank for boss fights and trash and this helps with clear times. You're not going to find more than 5% of the top 100-150 mc speed clears having a full prot Mt or ot.
---
Nobody talking bout the warrior trash out there eyein that weapon damage and speed. Hunters for the most part dont know any better. Warriors will give you a sermon on why the staff is better for them than you.
---
These guys work of their beautiful glutes for our enjoyment, the least we could do is pay them back in tan and grease.
---
Dps is a thing too which is important for mc speed clears.
---
I never thought about it, but Mend Pet *is* a healing spell. So you're saying if I equipped + Healing gear, it would make Mend Pet more effective? Or would it only work with + Spellpower gear?
---
Pvp would sure be interesting if undead players were immune to polymorph.
---
I replaced seal of wrynn (yes, the blue ring from Stocks) with Ring of Spellpower on my fresh 60 mage
---
worth it.
---
10 days to get 1,5 levels of rested exp
---
Yeah it‚Äôs nice for mages but locks get a 33 shadow dmg ring with int and stam from bwl trash
---
Zug Zug
---
&gt; But really, I don't see how anyone could get through all those trolls -- many elites -- without at least a full 5-man group
---
Dying a lot on the way up.
---
&gt; The speed difference is so minimal
---
It's visible over a longer distance. I can see the difference in the beginning of AV.
---
This. I dont want e-sport competitive, I want an MMORPG.
---
People like you still don't get it : most Classic players are adults, with families and jobs.
---
To expect anything else but empty Classic servers during Christmas holiday and New year is insanity.
---
Last time I logged on was on December 22nd.
---
My guild suspended all raiding until January 6th.
---
Retail, even if with a much younger players base (I'd say most are kids under 17), is still empty during this time. Classic is obviously much more emptier.
---
R11. Which is 100g before any reductions.
---
Hey I was completely new at one point back in September myself. 
---
 I played classic as mentioned. This is a very rare opportunity to get somewhat of a glimpse into what the fuss was all about back thing which is still the biggest game to do date, imagine playing a open world game with 10 million people though servers split this up. It's very true your reputation follows you in classic. 
---
 I started retail last night and there is alot more choices that's for sure lol but I chose a panda monk as it seemed fun, only got to level 10 but we will see where it goes from there. With retail it just threw me into a new players server so I hope that eventually I can switch to a more populated one with west coast time.
---
Thanks! It was the double amount of crit that was throwing me off. If it's not the 5.5% ish from songflower and 5% from Onyxia then I don't really know. Could have been pure RNG I guess. I'm using Dal'rend set atm, so weapon wise we should (or we used to be) about the same on that front. Guess I'll see what tonight's RNG brings me. Maybe I'll hit 20% crit on Garr!
---
Yeah funny how all the top 100 mc clear times uses fury prot....think about it beyond tps.
---
Everyone is saying that but bwl ring is unique you wont be able to have two..(mc ring isn't) Anyway its best to take one MC ring and not 2x and pair it with shadow one.There is one more hit ring but it will be heavily contested
---
Wait hemo debuff slows down the raid but bringing a spriest doesnt? 
---
At least try to keep your bullshit logic straight dude
---
It's so pixelated for me I cant make out the names at all
---
As someone who is too lazy to farm dark runes and other raid consumables, I feel like I made a mistake choosing the class and spec with the heaviest demand for dark runes and other raid consumables.
---
Ah ok, thanks very much
---
I have a 0-1 healer avg in wsg when pugging as alliance. Premade 4lyfe.
---
Goto Fight Club man. It's all there in Pins. I'm on my phone right now or I'd link you directly. But just check it out. Even if you don't play warrior the discord is vastly useful for information. They're the ones who figured out all the Onyxia/Rag threat issues with GUID and such.
---
Glad I quit playing Classic. What a joke it turned out to be. Nothing at all like playing Vanilla.
---
Fortunately, I chose human. Perception is pretty solid.
---
yeah, i was actually looking into that, just haven't thought it properly through - it might be the option i prefer the most tbh
---
Hell yeah be a part of the problem...
---
Same here, we premade a lot, I don't know if that somehow has anything to do with it.
---
2 accounts + 2 accounts 
---
= 4
---
If his shaman is good they will be twisting, so he has wf up the whole fight and grace of air up 7/8ths of the time.
---
Cross realm bgs...
---
Is this actually true?
---
which is 1.5 second longer than hopping over a -defended- horde wall.
---
Are the alliance so delusionnal they believe they shouldn't have any backdoor in their base, but keep the hordes one in? or do they think 3 people should be enough defense VS a 25 man offense?
---
Hopefully EU horde will start playing more like the Russians then. I love facing Russians. It's either a super quick win, or a super quick loss. Or the meta will shift again to even more of a cancerous one where alliance will TP into the base with 30 people (like horde) and defend, then defend some more, go have a quick bio, defend some more, have supper, then defend some more, go sleep, wake up to defend some more, then end the game.
---
I was here
---
You got something useful to say today?
---
problem is he is going to have to level either way and TBH retails "end game" is dull as shit, classic isn't much better but it is more focused, like i want this item so i do this (like you want a weapon and it drops from this dung/raid) where as retail you want an item and you run the content it comes from get the item but at the wrong item level and need to run it again and again.
---
How geared do you need to be to make the runs efficient and fast? Can a bear tank do this too?
---
Goldman is prob better, no interference from fears.
---
I've played hundreds of AV over the years since BC with half of the Alliance NPC elites getting aggroed when Horde run into the base. It simply doesn't happen in the Horde base. The Horde NPCs are not physically anywhere near the relief hut.
---
Depends on what someone's version of Classic+ is.
---
For me, I'd by happy with new raids with item budgets the same as T2/2.5/3.
---
There is 13 years of content to steal art/mechanics from.
---
There are a lot of itemization gaps, it would be nice to be able to have a full set for the "offspecs" like Fury/Shadow/Enhance/Ele, etc.
---
If raids were "new" people would still do them.
---
*That* is what I want. Not any sort of core mechanic/talent changes from what we already have, nor content with gear that has higher item budgets than T3 which is already near game breaking. And I say that as someone whose main is a Spriest that could really use Vampiric Touch/Shadowfiend.
---
What I miss most about Vanilla is the experience of "new". I made it to raids before they were well-known solved problems, and I miss that.
---
Can you read? If you don't have axe spec applies to anything thats not orc. Its only bis for orcs.
---
Go elemental and just stack as many sources of sp as possible and wear a shield.
---
Horde brains aren't nearly big enough to comprehend that though. Unless they're russian, they're the only ones who usually do it correctly for whatever reason
---
He's a High Warlord Aragorn instead.
---
Same here. Just got fitfth piece of T1 and they are linked. Thanks for findings.
---
Can you read? For any non human it's bis lmao.
---
*helps you through 5 minutes of the raid
---
Does anyone know FOR SURE that respec cost decay is present, and if there is a minimum? I have heard many times it takes a month to decay one bracket (15 to 10g, for example), and I believed this. After 2 months of it not decaying below 10g (I've only ever respec'd twice) I started to doubt this. Some guildies say 10g is the minimum, and it will not decay below 10g. Someone else says they just witnessed it decay from 10g -&gt; 5g.
---
But it's good for arcane shot bruh /s
---
But it IS related to your ability to rank. And you don't want to rank by baiting your team to turtle.
---
edited it. The rockelementals are the ones we tank away now.   
---
The fire one still spawns their little elemental and gives the silence dot. But the stunning shots that usually kill raidmembers in those groups can be avoided like that.  
---
Just focus the fire elementals and their add first while tanking the other adds away from the raid. That's how you avoid deaths :)
---
Have you found this to be better gph than clearing the whole courtyard as well? Because I‚Äôve been doing around that (30ish per hour) while killing evert single mob in about 20 min.. but an extra 5g/hr is nice.
---
Sounds like ur slow doesnt last long enough, do you have the talent that increase chill effect duration, permafrost?
---
I can absolutely agree with that. It especially sucked because of how itemization is. Prebis swords do quite a bit better than prebis daggers but that's just because Krol/Rends are just that good while there just wasn't a good dagger outside of MC until AV. But man the damage on perditions is just so damn high, it doesn't get a comparable sword till CTS.
---
More. I hold 750dps fury‚Äôs in a mix of pre-raid bis mitigation and threat pieces + ony neck. That‚Äôs horde side too without salv. I could hold more with better buffs/once i get more threat pieces.
---
Yand don't forget you get an exp multiplier past 2 people. Starts around 1.3 x at first. More low lvs + higher multiplier is best. You can find the chart and do the math.
---
Depends on server. There are some realms with 8hours a day for highest brackets
---
I have a research project for you.
---
1.) join fight club discord 
---
2.) find the tank-chat text channel
---
3.) tell them all how stupid they are for theory crafting wrong, and how your spreadsheets are superior
---
lol fuck off with this anti-China rhetoric, you haven't got a clue what you're talking about and just want le upvotes le China bad
---
Will BWL likely be doable in full pre raid BiS? Or will MC and Ony gear be needed? I know it's hard to predict, just trying to get a feel for if I'll be geared enough (as a healer).
---
Me too. I hope people aren't to hard on the guy when he gets into a guild. Us veteran players must be mindful that there are people who never played WoW back in the day and need some guidance.
---
They shouldn't have this backdoor, it wasn't a feature in 1.12.1 and comes from the legion client.
---
The other one was at least in vanilla, now they have 2 paths.
---
Chromatically Tempered Sword. Worth noting that for non-humans, deathbringer is pretty well on par.
---
Oh that makes blatant racism okay, pardon me
---
*helps you top the healing meters if you are already high near the end so you can continue to spam flash heal
---
That's almost as wasteful. We're talking BoE that shit best end up in the auction house.
---
I love seeing this same post everyday! Its so awesome!
---
But then I‚Äôd have to be a human, a dwarf (small human) or a a gnome (smallest human) or an elf. 
---
I‚Äôm already human. Booorrinngggg.
---
DB+flurry/frostbite is better than Viskag+BB if you're using edgemasters. And you don't have to compete with rogues.
---
Somehow all the bracket one premades go nearly undefeated though.
---
The ways that certain races behave makes blatant racism okay.
---
No worries! We all space out and make mistakes.
---
It is not pre raid bis, since you are alliance
---
Here's the thing, obsessing over the most gold per hour and opting for something more dangerous or variant can end up detracting from your overall gold gain. I like doing ZF farm, because the gold is pretty consistent, and I dont sell the runs because escorting lowbies can be frustrating. I rarely need gold in such a tight time frame that I need to be making 40g per hour instead of 35g. 
---
Do what you can do with ur brain mainly off, I guarantee you will ultimately farm more gold.
---
Well... some people clear mc in 30 minutes, some in 3 hours and 30 minutes... luckily I'm not in the 2nd group.
---
Fury tanking is the meta for best tps. Else you gimp your dps in waiting for you to get threat.
---
Gold, cloth, trash, charging lowbies for the run.
---
You're so wrong
---
&gt; But don‚Äôt you fucking dare
---
Just, don't do that.  Even if you're about to make the best, most salient point in the world, starting it with that just makes everyone cringe and ignore.
---
Eminence member reporting in. The one guy in our guild who was actually botting got a 6 month ban after being flagged by the automated cheating report system - serves him right. However, the ladder is heavily plagued by bots on our server ranging from autoclickers to full blown scripts. I've actually quit ranking as a result of the sheer number of players simply AFKing 20+ hours a day in AV... and I was in bracket 14 every week (and currently rank 11).
---
No they don‚Äôt. You‚Äôre tank is going fury prot for the dps, not the threat. You are speed clearing MC, so you want max dps.
---
Deep prot is still more threat. Our discussion here was always about threat. I never said people *shouldn‚Äôt* go fury prot unless in the context of TPS.
---
Please don‚Äôt be stupid. Fury-prot doesn‚Äôt start to edge out deep prot in threat until BWL levels of gear. That‚Äôs all I‚Äôve ever been saying cause that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve been discussing here.
---
None gives a shit about your sub 1 hour MC clears. It means nothing relative to TPS.
---
It is healing BIS and still great for tanking even with a healing enchant on it.
---
That spell crit is huge on paladin.
---
I was thinking about this the other day! I think its because in vanilla I was in high school, on winter and summer break when I was raiding alot, and just clearing MC on Tuesday and waiting 7 days with nothin to do haha. Now we clear MC then work 40+ hours and Tuesday appears suddenly with more lo0tz within our grasp üòÉ

With BF Head/shoulders/boots as opposed to Champion's + Boots of SF we see the following differences:
---
* \-3 STA
---
* \+31 STR
---
* \+77 AGI
---
* \-34 AP
---
* \+1.65% crit
---
* \- 4% hit
---
* \+5.85% dodge
---
* \+ BF 8pc set bonus (Not sure on dps increase here)  
---
So for PvE with full BF, we are losing a bit of AP and a significant amount of hit, while gaining moderate crit and the BF set bonus.  Wish there was an easier way to compare!  
---
And then we also have the option of  5pc t2 + T1 gloves/shoulders.  With full BF equipped compared to this, we see the following differences:
---
* \+3 STA
---
* \+16 STR
---
* \+26 AGI
---
* \-2 AP
---
* \+0.89% crit
---
* \+3.3% dodge
---
* \+ BF 8pc set bonus (Not sure on dps increase here)
---
This one appears a little closer in general with the difference being the 4% hit we are losing out on.
---
I think I'm going to make a separate post about this to get more responses!
---
This is almost 99% a fresh TSM install where they didn‚Äôt change stack size.
---
Gehennas
---
45 minutes. You realize even guilds with prot tanks are doing it quicker than that right? 45 minutes isn't even top 100. So if you're not getting records for speed clears or even in competition for them then why would you have tanks be fury? You would be better off having your tank prot and pulling even faster at that point. Seriously it sounds like you're trying to justify being fury prot spec because you don't like being told it's not the optimal spec right now. 
---
But I will say, obviously, if you're getting under 30 minute clears you would spec for the extra DPS. 99.9% of guilds raiding aren't doing that though which makes this a moot point.
---
Obvious troll.
---
they share a subscription, play both then decide.
---
Can this be a thing please!? From now on can we only refer to bots/botters as "daleks"?
---
The healing effect used to scale 1:1 with +healing (and snapshotted your stats when equipped), making this sword extremely broken for paladins and warriors if they collect a healing set. That got nerfed, however.
---
I played since before they connected flight paths lol people didnt used to be such assholes is all. No one is entitled to anything but the people who leveled their skills should be given a shot. 
---
Agreee to disagree i guess ya ninja.
---
I only farmed items to sell pre PvP. Now that pvp is out I don‚Äôt post much anymore but still play every day. 
---
Players quitting and players like me are not mutually exclusive - it‚Äôs hard to pinpoint the actual trend without blizzard giving us data.
---
It has dropped once for our raid group, having done mc every week since release. 6-8 staffs though.
---
Based on your gear, you seem to be the stronger twin, he was likely a runt
---
diablo's an mmo?
---
&gt;Fury tanking is the meta for best tps.
---
Go ask in Fight Club.
---
You are ruining the enjoyment of other people. You should play with like minded people who are okay with your suboptimal spec. If they are not you should not play with them.
---
Except the ‚Äúof shadow wrath‚Äù greens that I need for my 39 twink right? Right?!?! 
---
Oh god I‚Äôll never find them
---
get your 2016 snowflake shit outta here
---
TBC
---
Again...the originally comment I responded to was based on THREAT. Not speed clears. You are arguing over something no one was even talking about. Threat is what started the discussion. You for some reason wanted to bring up speed clears. Like, what did that add to a discussion about threat?
---
Nothing.
---
How is it different for Alliance? Does queuing or BGs work differently for them?
---
Never seen blue or red absinthe before. Is it good?
---
I absolutely hate Horde players who do this, it‚Äôs just sad to grief lower level players like this
---
Edit: Love getting downvoted by triggered Hordies
---
&gt; Don‚Äôt believe me, then take a stop at the Fight a Club discoed and enjoy getting schooled.
---
I love to get schooled but it seems like you have wack reading comprehension. This is what the faq says: ‚Äú**What talents should I use?**
---
For most guilds you can use the basic Deep Prot talent build. However, if you‚Äôre in a hardcore guild thats pushing the limits and you‚Äôre h√§ving problems holding aggro, you should spec into Fury Prot. If that is still not enough, you should also start dualwielding.‚Äù
---
So you‚Äôre basically just wrong.
---
Alternate expansions. 
---
First expansion utilizing the unused areas of the classic map 60-70 so the population isn't separated. No flying. 
---
No dungeon finder for current expac dungeons.
---
Hey feel free to ask me any rogue questions you might have if you can‚Äôt find any answers online!
---
I think that's a bit offensive. "Like me"? What's that supposed to mean? 
---
I'm an adult, have job and all that stuff. I was just asking the question, jeez.
---
Even maces?
---
I'm a rogue and I always bring a few pieces of FR gear, minor fr potions and some major healing pots and I like never die to these boys anymore.
---
Is it like actual real absinth... or that boring stuff that doesn't cause hallucinations?
---
wat? It's not about skill at all when 40 people who talk to each other on discord steamroll a bunch of people who just met for the first time. If you really think it has anything to do with skill, you've got some real issues.
---
It's you!
---
That's me I am so strong /Flex /Flex. You guys are noobs can't you see with that stuff I am smarter and make better decisions and if I wear trinkets I would be op and people will cry
---
MMOs are a huge time commitment *in general.*
---
It really depends if you have to go out of town or not. If your extended family all live close and you‚Äôre at home, it‚Äôs relatively easy to get the time in, even with a family, other than Christmas Eve and Day.
---
Yeah, if I'm alone and can't get away when someone attacks me in AV I just stand there and die.  It takes a long time to die though with a shield on even though I'm all cloth
---
That's because you turn invisible silly
---
A lot of ours go to the AH, which you dont understand for some reason. Nobody needs them anymore, which means we have more money than we can spend. It's not greedy. Everyone in the raid is excited for someone to get a legendary. Nobody is being greedy just you with hording guild money.
---
Disagree. Private Servers are why we are stuck with AoE farming 5 mans. Groups who only invite mages and ignore all game mechanics. Then in lvl 60 dungeons they think blizzard and cone of cold should be used on one to two mob pulls. Horrible habits learned and screw groups over in end level groups.
---
I must not be on most servers then because we have tons of groups forming all hours of the day. I‚Äôm in Tanaris right now and at least 4-5 calls an hour go out for ZF LFM and they always seem to find them.
---
Hypothetical here.
---
8 min loss for 1k rep. 
---
(60/8)=7.5x1000=7500 rep/hr
---
40 min win for 2200 rep.
---
(60/40)=1.5x2200=3300 Rep/hr
---
Those numbers are made up but it demonstrates the fact that fast wins/losses are much better rep/honor PER HOUR given instant queues (which Alli have).
---
Later level zones have quest areas spread further that are designed for riding. You need a mount.
---
TBC without flying and vendor badge gear and resiliance.
---
fill in the unused areas before that though
---
To be fair, I was in the bg and he never got kicked and never responded in chat when people were addressing him. His behavior was definitely suspicious, but you'd have to take my word for it. Either way idc.
---
After a guild schism, I‚Äôm left in a position where I can take some leadership as we were left with only 2 officers (1 of which is on vacation for another week).  What types of behaviours do you expect/hope to see from the officers in your guild?  What are some things I can do to help build our guild back up? We went from 2 full raiding teams that took about 2 hrs each to 1 semi filled raid team that took 5 hours to get 9/10 last night.  We‚Äôre going to finish rag tonight hopefully.  I don‚Äôt feel like bailing yet but I also don‚Äôt know how hard it will be to build the guild properly.
---
This is what happens when they ban it after you report it.
---
1) gets banned
---
2) they make new account and bot again
---
Wow problem not solved
---
sounds like someone didnt get invited to the ally premades :^)
---
The addition on Nightfall could cause a spike in price for arcanite/crystals though.
---
On patchwerk maybe?
---
The secret is to run AV and MC in 0/5/46. Never respec.
---
I didn't say to vendor it.  You make a note of anything worth more than a gold and review it when your bags are full.
---
How many times are you gonna post this? If it didn‚Äôt gain traction the first two times, it‚Äôs not going to gain traction the next ten times after.
---
I used four snowballs on a guy in the cave, which was just over 2 minutes.  The game went on for 40 minutes, so I got us a half an hour of a new player that actually played.
---
I wouldn't bother trying to snowball someone in a mine,  that's a million miles away from the start.
---
Ey its dreadmist! Home
---
Good to see this
---
Cheers
---
I spent 3 days grinding for it. Went up 4 levels. Got it eventually after 1000+ kills.
---
Still, gz.
---
Our guild had a blank tabbard for like 2 weeks after migrating
---
Don't worry too much about weapon speed, you only want fast weapons if you're constantly rage capped, which you probably won't be without full world buffs.
---
Another reason is to reduce competition with DPS for weapons, since every dps warrior will want deathbringers.
---
Frostbite axe (AV rep) is also better than flurry if you use a sharoening stone, afaik.
---
Cloaks.
---
Found the botter
---
Ever since the last patch I lag out at the weirdest times. I have a 250mb connection so there shouldn‚Äôt be any issues on my end. When things are working good I have a 32ms ping.
---
Had zero problems before that, but now I have to kill/restart the game a couple times a day at least. On Atiesh US West.
---
This is exactly my experience. 
---
Also love getting requests for stupid rare enchants (say a 0.4% drop on Ony) and also not wanting to tip much with any consideration for time/effort or gold to get said enchant.
---
I got tipped a brilliant shard for a spell power enchant. So 3g. I think I do better having actual prices, like 20g+mats for rare endgame enchants like Crusader and Spell Power.
---
6 fps dream
---
plus The Expanse is really good sci-fi
---
Deciding to turtle 40 min wins "because queues are long" has INCREASED queue time because the average game lasts much longer and a portion of the alliance are giving up out of frustration.
---
MAYBE
---
90% of the ones who post edgy memes about grind are probably the worst casuals the world ever seen.
---
Just screams food dye. Can‚Äôt do it.
---
Most non gathering professions are loss leaders unless your crafting lionheart helms. It costs alot to level them up if you want your profession to make money level herbalism and sell the herbs the potions are rarely above the cost of the herb.
---
If you don't know what happened, the alliance are zerging Drek -- OP dies, ankhs, goes behind Drek and snowballs him out of his room to reset him
---
Burning Crusade content without the level jump.
---
With queues getting to 24-30 minutes.... When Alliance get in immediately? Yea, I'll play d and wipe you guys. Better than a 30 min wait for 5 mins of pve. Just saying.
---
And a non shadow priest that grabs shadow weaving is even better than a shadow priest.
---
I tried enchanting in WoD. Never again. Now I did blacksmithing xddd same story, thankfully I realized it soon enough
---
It's better for both teams to rush van/drek and nobody go on D. That was the meta when av came out but now games take fucking forever. This is coming from horde side. I'd rather lose in 5 minutes to an enemy team who races us faster, rather than everyone recalling and us losing to a superior team in 20 minutes.
---
You're not going to make rank 14.
---
Step 1: learn enchanting
---
Step2: run dungeons and DE shit
---
Step3: Profit
---
No one forced you to take part in it though.
---
Shadowcraft.
---
The difference is that horde have many more people queuing than alliance, so when entering a BG queue there is a long wait for alliance to join.  Since alliance get instant queue pops yes, they can basically coordinate and all join at the same time.  It works completely different due to the faction imbalance.  Obviously that is what you are missing or don't understand, it's a faction numbers issue that makes it possible for alliance and impossible for horde.
---
yes the title that people see will be your current title but if they inspect your honor tab they will be able to see your highest rank

I'm going to bet he also has 5/5 imp. Arcane shot because... well... because. That's even faster arcane shots! lol

Consider changing realms.  I avoided big servers for a reason

Cuz others out there actually grinding
---
This has gotta be it. Tailoring is now by far the most popular profession for mages and priests. It didn‚Äôt use to be that way.
---
No, because Horde lowbies are safe on their Zeppelins because it's in Horde territory and/or has Goblin Guards on it.
---
I'd like WoW 2.0 cycle after going through TBC/wotlk. Fresh launch of the game with some new zones/end game content. 
---
New 60 content sounds nice, but the naxx patch is a horrible place to start adding it. They need a do-over.
---
LOL... yea, 100%. I bot to get my rank 4. Hardcore botting.
---
Or, I'm just pointing out someone elses stupid comment lol.
---
As someone who finally got exalted with Stormpike faction this no longer fills me with existential dread.
---
If you picked a crafting profession expecting to make money off it instead of just being a guild slave then you made a mistake.
---
Exalted for gear and cheaper 100% mount.
---
Do you like what you see?
---
Nobody did MC at the end of vanilla??? People still did it over on my server just for bindings and ingots for the people that missed out on it, gz regardless!
---
Congrats!
---
Yeah, but horde has the offensive advantage and they start close to the middle (horde and alliance encounter balinda), so alliance should have an advantage defensively.
---
But with 3 different paths into the alliance bsa, and archers being weak as fuck in 1.12.1, I don't see there being any huge advantages.
---
Not sure if you know, but that was the name of a website back in the day for arena tryhards
---
Been investing heavily in dirt cheap elemental water; it will pay off.
---
Well if you compare it to BRE then it's 330 damage less per hit since (100*3.3+AP) formula might be a bit wrong but close enough. Even if you do 1/2 damage you hit many more than 4
---
Do you think that was intentionally done to you? Or just happenstance?
---
Someone put this over the epic sax guy music pls
---
Well, I'm Alliance so.....
---
Took me a total of 36 hours to farm for mine. You got lucky!
---
I had this type of bug quite a bit back in vanilla.
---
would slide all across the map until a GM came and ported me back somewhere safe.
---
I wanna yell that at the local cracker barrel
---
Wooosh
---
Paying for XP on a farming run is stupid. You pay for loot. The warrior has to do ZERO differently for the tagalongs to get XP, so there‚Äôs literally no value in it. However, if that warrior starts giving up loot then it‚Äôs costing them something worth reimbursement.
---
This is different if the warrior wasn‚Äôt already farming the instance. Hiring someone to boost you is different than tagging along on a farming run.
---
Nah, there are still warriors that want it simply due to the amount of warriors vs. the amount of MH weapon drops.
---
As a sunny fan and warlock main I fucking love this.
---
Pvp without resilience would be laughably terrible.
---
Haha yeah I'm on the server sulfuras so we call it hand of rag lol I do think it is flashy to a degree and I know the first few on a server were way more hype then the first titan forged item was in retail is what I was getting to. Like some servers had a massive gathering to just watch the 1st guy forge his. And to that argument I say classic wins hype wise.
---
My guilds token ret has it.
---
But FuRY WaRrIOrs WEaR lEaThER
---
No pally on alliance side is what makes this even a contest.
---
You never *had* to take the BB/Ratchet ferry.  You can take Org/UC or Org/GG zepps.  Alliance had no choice but to take horde controlled ships at menethil to cross continents (if not risking BB/ratchet - which is also riskier for alli since Ratchet is horde controlled)
---
any healing addon that can tell me if someone is healing my target? i tried healbot but it seems like it doesnt tell me that
---
Since you‚Äôre a Mage: I‚Äôm a paladin and I got my guilds first mageblade.
---
Yes. No reason to go past shadow weaving.
---
I've never heard of it decaying below 10g.
---
It depends on what you like to do. Arms warrior is better at killing things. Ret paladin is better at staying alive and helping other people stay alive. 
---
Ret paladin requires more work in a BG since it‚Äôs a support class. You‚Äôll need to cleanse, heal, and give blessings to your teammates. You‚Äôll also be drinking a lot because all the stuff I just mentioned uses up your small mana pool. 
---
If you just want to hit and kill things with a two-handed weapon, go warrior.
---
I dunno... I'm having a lot of fun in AV... dat look when you drop on their heads..

Sorry, I‚Äôm a warrior. I forgot that fear is an issue.

Wait are you actually wiping in MC?
---
I saw a hunter with pendulum of doom equipped.
---
There's a warrior with sulfuron and blue pvp set sitting in org. He has honorable kills to back his honor (compared it to mine) and still a warlock said he is a bot :( maybe the guy was just watching netflix while waiting in queue or was he a good bot?
---
I stand and sling enchants on raid days. I make maybe 50g/hr. Spell power, healing power, +4 stats all have a 10g fee.  Everything else is for tips and people give 1-5g per enchant.
---
If it's not peak-time, I don't bother.
---
Whats boots of SF, op?
---
Did you even listen to what I said?
---
The song was written from the POV of *dandelion* who is trying to increase geralts standing with regular people. Bards are known for exaggerating things, they even bring that up when he writes a song about geralt killing elves when he doesnt do that
---
Gotta wonder what In the programming world would cause you to do this.
---
lolwut
---
If you‚Äôre doing something for hours upon hours per day and get no enjoyment from it you‚Äôre going down a very dark path, be careful
---
I can play my hunter well enough not to get death-zoned. If a hunter have a hard time beating a melee they should keep practicing.
---
If you have the mats, sell the enchant with your mats included and you‚Äôll make gold. People will pay extra for the convenience. Price it at market value of all the mats + 3-4g.
---
Would love to just see more parallel content added to the existing world. Parallel leveling dungeons. Parallel raids. More ways to play the game but no power creep, no invalidating existing content, etc.
---
You should complete the quests. Depending on your class that piece may be really good with the other BWL items. Plus there is a chance at the nice bag she drops and a chance to raid with whatever guild you join. (Or have joined)
---
‚Äúhey if you look in the crack behind golemagg you can see rag‚Äù

Having a couple dps die on a pull != wiping.

It is 3% faster as stated on the trinket

TBC classes.  Basically bringing the healing classes other viable roles.

Thought same thing haha

Where do you live? Horde or Ally?

Hope its a troll... You prolly need stuff from the dungeons for your bis gear anyways, so why not do the quests in between.. Guild will prolly help.
---
If it‚Äôs gonna take you weeks to attune to ony, what makes you think you‚Äôll be in a position to regularly raid BWL?
---
You might be fine with what you have now depending on how geared the rest of your raid group is. The melee dps will probably just be happy to have another shaman providing Windfury and Strength of Earth.
---
If you'll be raiding in a newer group though, you'll probably want to make sure you have gear with a respectable amount of +healing and/or Mp5 in every slot.
---
I'd say try going into a raid to get a feel for what it's like and aim to adjust your gear accordingly based on your experience in the raid.
---
I was leveling an alt and we tried to get a group for RFC, well we all alternated hopping on our mains and running the alts through it lol we went through 2-3 times and got everyone a level or two and had a good time. Not good related but jus thought I‚Äôd share
---
I said +stats, damages was an exemple, you can have +stam, +armor and +resists in pvp too...
---
If I wanted to drive to a city far away, I have the option to announce it to people around me in case they want to make use of the free space in my car. 
---
I can give that to them as a free trip because I'm that kind of a person. 
---
Or I can charge them some money for gas, because I have that option to make profit and get some discount on an otherwise expensive trip. 
---
Or I can ignore any pleas to come with me and drive alone because that's my car and I want to be alone. 
---
I can even make all passengers split the cost in such a way that the trip is free for me.
---
It's.  
---
All.  
---
Up.  
---
To.  
---
Me.  
---
(And it's up to them whether they agree to my terms or not.)
---
You think asking for money is stupid. That means you won't do it yourself and that also mean you aren't the targeted customer for people that will.
---
People like you don't understand everything can be a business opportunity if you want it to be. That's your loss. And also a benefit to people around you, so props to you for being kind.
---
Just please understand that it's not "stupid", it's just that some people value helping others and some people value profit more. It's about values, not stupidity. 
---
(Oh and please, don't be a "choosing beggar", because being a dick to people who are kind and not profit-oriented just makes those people disappear. And a strictly profit-oriented society is a miserable place to live in.)
---
I remember this happening a lot on pservers back when vanilla wow was the only wow available.
---
It was always boat related so I'm guessing the boat travel must be coded in some bizarre way (i.e its not only boat thats moving, its also you while being on the boat model). 
---
Then, when something happens to the player/boat and client fails to recognize that so on one level it thinks they are still together (hence the speed) but on the other knows theres no boat nearby (hence you just go forward and soon end up in the world textures)
---
Central time. Would prefer Ally I think but not too bothered
---
Well, now I want to role an UD priest
---
You need to be rank 3 at the time of purchase, you can drop after. You won't continue to get the discount after you drop. You could also have a *trusted* rank 3 player buy the mount for you, since it's bind on use.
---
Very concise I like it, thanks for the info.
---
... So you basically want resilience.
---
plenty of instances of AV went on for over 24 hours as well
---
I'm totally with you. It's a shame outland was designed for flying mounts in the first place, it's not like you can just cut that part of the game now  
---
Maybe release WOTLK as the first expansion, that one works much better without flying mounts :)
---
It comes down to how the timers work. They start when you exit the instance (or when you reset) and then that instance has an independent 1 hour timer. You‚Äôre capped at 5 instance ID timers. This does allow 5 runs in the first hour of farming because there are no previous IDs you‚Äôre waiting on to expire. After that you are waiting on the earliest ID timer to reset. If you map this out, 15 minute intervals become the minimum amount of time on average you need to wait in between runs which works out to 4 runs per hour if you don‚Äôt want to run into lockouts.
---
I remember MarkeeDragon crying about wowglider getting found out.
---
Do it on the forums... This is reddit
---
get yourself a cookie, only then, you will know
---
I had no issues running everything up to SFK, huge pulls and really fun. SM broke me and I couldn't do huge fun pulls any more.
---
That's not how math works.
---
No. Resilience is a weird scaling and a mathematical formula, it doesn't directly display how it improves your character like normal stats do, it just doesn't feel gooda and it's not intuitive
---
With +stam in pvp you will still do regular damage number and can tell how much health your opponent really has, not some automatic scaling crap
---
oooh honor... cause people aren't trying to get rep
---
use sinister strike after autos to lose less auto attack uptime with windfury procs etc.
---
prepop abilities on bosses to minmax. Pre apply slice for luci/mag with dead dogs
---
be one of the first to start dpsing on mobs/bosses(iwthout dying duh)
---
go spellpower rogue and spend hundreds of gold per raid with shadow oils, flasks and spellpower consumes
---
Not everyone was having healers roll on spell damage items...
---
Lmao fuck that
---
it shows only in raid or in bg too? cuz i have raid tomorrow and want to config this so im all ready for tomorrow
---
The only upgrade enchant on head is in ZG and that is for tanks, so 8 str should last through all phases for dps. If ur alliance it will stack with blessing of kings and be even stronger. 
---
Its heavy debated whats best, and the safest thing is use a spredsheet to check the difference with the gear you have equiped. 
---
Most of the times 8 str will be the best.
---
&gt;what would be the point of questing and leveling in outland then ?
---
It's really just a timesink to begin with. The Outland zones are very bland and uninspired compared to the classic zones. Devoid of interesting lore, devoid of interesting quest chains. It was an entirely forgettable experience.
---
You think the company that can't even maintain their game by banning the millions of botters everywhere is going to develop new content?  We are going to get TBC classic because it's cheap and easy.
---
Classic should be just that, classic, not a "WoW-what if" alternative universe.
---
I want it to follow the patch flow retail has seen, but each expansion becomes accessible as its own launcher where you can clone a character from the previous expacs so people can keep playing their favorite/s
---
You can try flamestrike &amp; CoC kiting as an alternative. It'll take some time to get the hang of it but imo it's superior to aoe farming with blizzard.
---
If you're a goblin engineer you might be able to make some gold off selling sapper charges. Engineering is mostly a gold sink though.
---
It literally always has been painful in a pug
---
how is his guild dumb? its bis weapon for pally same as for mages and locks &gt;.&gt;
---
Idealy you wouldn't need to solo content as a shaman. Play with friends, farm DME with a warrior etc. But you can clear mobs semi-decently as resto with just lightning shield and bolts/shock, just make sure you ask a mage for some 55 water first.
---
Just jumping directly into raids and dungeons without caring about the world sounds even worse tho
---
Warlocks are nice if you can convince your guild to give you the gear you need
---
The boat doesn‚Äôt move. The whole of Azeroth moves
---
Oh damn
---
Venoxis?
---
Lmao this reminds me of that scene in Interstellar when he‚Äôs in the 4th dimension
---
WSG really needs a timer
---
So u want to see big numbers pop up on your screen and nothing else.
---
No, all of the materials and costs are quest turn ins.
---
You mean the bis healing weapon for Paladins?
---
The problem is there is no ‚Äòhealing power‚Äô weapons in MC or ony.
---
?? Pvp rank isnt indicative of skill in any way shape or form in vanilla
---
Haha the bastard himself
---
Whenever you can. There's no reason to wait.
---
As a spriest this is naughty af. Thanks!
---
I'm mediocre at best, and I've been pretty open about that.  I am a realist though. If 0.1% of all players will obtain rank 14, and it has been known for 15 years as one of the most brutal grinds out there, forgive me for my skepticism of someone saying a month out that that they're going to be a "shoo in" for rank 14 on a certain day next year.  Now it's clear that tons of people think they're going to be rank 14 soon, which is going to be fun here on r/classicwow.
---
Great answers, and well noted regarding robe and trinket, both of which I have. If SM/DS is the best farming spec, how do they handle princess without triggering with the voidwalker?
---
I don't understand why i'm being downvoted?
---
Classic pvp is awful in comparison to tbc. The balance is bad, and the phase gear scaling heavily favors physical damage dealers and it isn't close.
---
and then hes gonna outlift these beefcakes
---
Losing world buffs on key DPS is a pretty big deal in the speed running scene.
---
Anything that doesn't increase the level cap or adds additional raids that are not 40 man raids. I came back because I'm hoping they don't constantly raise the bar like they do In  retail. I also came back because I think 40 people having to work together is awesome. I'mma bail if they get ride of either.
---
there really should be no way you're pulling aggro on a single target fight like that, ESPECIALLY in the execute phase when the tank should be taunting/mocking blow/challenging shout/taunting 
---
tanks can use consumables too, tell yours to get their shit together lol
---
no.... ?
---
How would you feel if WoW only had one stat that increases defenses and damages by a percentage ? It would suck.
---
Resilience is the same but for pvp instead of pve.
---
I have enough lotus to flask myself for 15 weeks and I‚Äôve farmed our elixirs for the same I have enough gold for another month of flask
---
Is this the new way to get to GM Island?
---
I think I did a few dungs with Soz, gz!!
---
It could also be "more classic" because if you want more classic you definitely won't be getting it anywhere else.
---
Change locations? There's plenty of zones in your level range to grind
---
Thanks for being constructive!
---
All other hunters are fake XD
---
Greater fire protection potion.
---
farming honor for rank 10 gear
---
Pally twink is so OP. Frustrating to play against
---
You don't even know what you are arguing for at this point.
---
That is exactly what was happening.
---
Never to late
---
He was mind visioning me during the trip so I have no idea. Maybe he was trying it. He clearly knew what happened to me.
---
I mean some of us actually like pvp and aren't queing just to be awarded honor and rep every 30-40min
---
Is just joke m8
---
the actual silver being looted is split among the group so youre losing money if you have low levels tagging along
---
a ZF gy boost nets you ~1g per run from looted silver if you have 4 other lowbies. if you didnt charge for the run youd be losing some money
---
Thanks.  I herb and scout black lotus, so money isn't a big issue.  I was more worried about solo questlines I might want to complete, such as for Fordring's Seal.
---
Quick update, you're so right!
---
I'm now 1k into friendly and found a few people doin the same grind and we all added each other.
---
It's SO much faster now doing the 2nd quest in a five man group, taking a small break for nye and then 2nd week of january aiming to complete the farming!
---
Getting killed 10 times everytime I'm trying to get into BRM is getting old so a pve server could be nice, is there a lot of pugs going for dungeons etc?
---
not even major pots
---
oh right thanks
---
It'll never be too late, Classic WoW isn't going anywhere, you could join it 5 years from now and not be late, tons of people are still leveling up and due to the insane lack of things to do outside of raid at 60 a lot of people are making alts as well.
---
Those same mobs also give you a debuff that massively lowers your FR though
---
I got BRE
---
Seek out "Imbrium".
---
Maybe its the kodobone thing from desolace with stam and spirit?
---
For me, I dont want to do BC.   It just invalidates all of the effort you put into  classic.  
---
The classic that I want to see is as follows:  
---
New raids at the tier 2, 2.5 and tier 3 level.  
---
Every class gets a 4th tree.  As well as tweak of the current talent trees.  
---
New lvl 30 plus zones, that exist in the current world. There is currently a lot of dead space between existing zones on the continents that can be used for this.  
---
Azshara made into a proper Zone.  As well deadwind pass, and mount hyjal.  
---
Existing zones get extra Quest lines added to them. As well as several 20-plus step quests that span several zones, added to the game at level 60.  
---
No new landmasses.  No phased areas.  
---
New battleground.  
---
Every skill in the game require side quest unlock. Higher tiers are at trainers.  
---
Every week one raid boss gets a new unlockable fight and doing that fight gives an item for alternate tier gear, for off-spec builds, and alternate art versions.  
---
Several new mounts available for hundreds of gold. This is to create a gold sink so the economy remain stable.  
---
New crafting recipes at all skill levels.
---
Mages have a talent that does the same thing as ruin.. crit scales better on locks because of ISB
---
There are always new players and people leveling alts.  If anything, now that world pvp has died down it is a better place to be leveling than it was a month ago.
---
You don't have to have only 1
---
In theory you could have OG classic and classic + and everyone could sift between both versions as they please.
---
I got BRE Christmas Eve during a guild raid. Shit was great!
---
Flasks? For MC? Egads.
---
Just wait for the new strat to start appearing in your games where 35 alliance in comms completely wipes horde at mid and never gives you a chance to kill Belinda. 
---
Less than 500-750 honor per game and you still have your long ass queues. Enjoy.
---
I feel really bad that you think this is funny or think it makes you look good
---
I was "lucky" enough to do two avs in a row with an Apes premade.
---
Easy 4k honor each game in 6 mins, the whole games were insane.
---
Everyone was so coordinated it was almost unbelivable
---
Thats really nice of you!
---
I love wolf mounts. The white one happens to be the 2nd best looking.
---
It's also the only BG where I have some hope of winning even if most players are clueless. WSG is downright impossible with the same group of players and when AB comes out it will be the same there.
---
5 mans balanced around end game raid gear. Something new and challenging for smaller groups. Not sure how to get them to be rewarding without even more gear inflation.
---
Highly doubt it.
---
haha alright then buddy, great arguments too
---
Is that the same aedak from lightningsblade horde back in the day?
---
Come to bloodsail. Not hardcore RP. But it's there. Alliance heavy. Come on over!
---
Nobody breaking 500 dps on bosses is most likely a rotation issue or really long downtimes ( if tank takes a while to get a threat lead), not a gear issue. You can easily break 500 dps with pre raid bis gear.
---
I believe that toon was originated from the characters in toontown being called toons.
---
Ahh okay. Your best bet for that, depending on how far you are in the chain (the last couple quests require little to no combat and can totally be solved by a resto shaman, as I did), is probably getting a guildie to help you.
---
Stop acting like you know what's going on in Fight Club and then just posting blatant misinformation. Horde side especially, it becomes incredibly difficult to hold DPS as Deep Prot past 800 which plenty of warriors are capable of doing right now.
---
Nah felhunter + perception is actually busted and has saved me sooooo many times from getting opened up on
---
Which is uncharacteristic of Dandelion, as the songs he writes about him in the actual source material don't display him as Superman. Geralt also finds the ballads Dandelion writes about him extremely annoying.
---
There‚Äôs usually 25-30 horde defending, but keep telling yourself what you need to hear.
---
Lucky hunter can even make Thunderfury. I want it on my warlock for a stupid melee warlock meme spec but I can‚Äôt even make TF.
---
I'll get you once it's written up don't worry it's gimped but still around!
---
I think your analogy is lacking somewhat; It would be like not wanting to watch a show because most people are caught up but the season finale of season one and three aren't available anymore because that content has been removed from... existence i guess? There are things in retail that you just cant get/do anymore, is my point here.
---
Honorfuel
---
This graph shows literally nothing
---
I assumed after a certain time or level they would let you switch. Or they give you one free transfer
---
Its like 5 times to BRD. No one wants to do it when looking for group.
---
It used to have a modicum of skill. 
---
I mean, you don‚Äôt get honor if you can‚Äôt kill people in world PvP. 
---
Now afkers can climb ranks.
---
The final destination for classic wow is wotlk. There won't be a big demand for cata servers in the legacy community.
---
The question is what they do after wotlk. That's where the opportunity for new vanilla content lies. They'll be able to create a lot of hype with a fresh vanilla+ launch.
---
Except for +4 stats I have every enchant currently in the game and I almost always offer them for "whatever you feel like bud" when people whisper me. I make a killing just sitting in Orgrimmar, I rarely heal reserve runs anymore and enchanting far outpaces the G/hr of lasher farming. 
---
Are you just on a lower pop server who cant support it?
---
This is incorrect. Base miss chance in pvp is 4%, the amount that can be reduced by gear/talents is 3%.
---
No clue. I might use it as a teleportation portion sometime. Drink it in one place and end up somewhere completely different
---
Legitimately just curious, I was a horde player back in the day and I remember everyone saying that alliance had a better advantage in AV. Now as I‚Äôm playing classic the alliance are saying horde have a better advantage, with less distance to run, and backdoor etc.  
---
I‚Äôve been thinking on a few advantages that alliance have and this is what I personally have though of:
---
The bridge to Dun Baldar is perfect for turtles, and provides no cover from archers. There is a perfect spot from starting cave for alliance reinforcements to jump into Stormpike GY,
---
OP are you like 7?
---
For DM North, if you want to do a tribute run, there is a part threat requires either seaforium charges, skeleton keys from blacksmithing or a rogue to pick the lock.  Unless you plan on soloing a tribute run (which I believe is impossible for warriors) you probably don't need to worry about the charges.  Just make sure someone in your group can handle the door, as a tank, you will always be needed.
---
I have a Green one as well if you want that instead
---
Its a great game if you havent been studying it for 20 years
---
Negative, but you‚Äôre level 10 so now is the time to make the switch 
---
Find a full pop server dominated by the faction you wanta play
---
Horde is really strong right now
---
Yeah but Threat is an issue for most dogshit guilds because their tank is garbage, not because they're playing deep prot.
---
I've been out there for the past week, few hours a day...things like this both infuriate me and motivate to keep trying.
---
&lt;Five FX&gt; all botters on Blaumeux
---
While blowing people up is fun, I have to say that I much better enjoyed a world with resilience.  
---
Resilience allowed for counterplay, which in vanilla there really isnt much of, while it does bring its own set of problems you have at least enough time to think and possibly rectify the situation.  
---
In vanilla, I feel like the pvp skill ceiling is much lower than tbc/wotlk (idk about other expacs and even wotlk is iffy due to DK) because you can catch someone off guard and blow them up , pretty much instantly, if youre lucky.
---
why a 4th tree ? wut ? Making all the existing tree good would already be enough
---
Then you'll surely have no problem posting your logs. As you say, content is easy so there should be death less runs under an hour each week.
---
They could give me 25 bucks and a free mount every day and i still wouldn't play that garbage.
---
MC gear (Tier 1 set) is not good at all.  
---
But don't worry, T2 Helmet and Legs are dropped from Onyxia and Ragnaros, so guilds will still farm MC/Ony every week.
---
Pretty sure it's actually just my phone but sure...
---
They haven't invested crap in classic.
---
It can't drop below 10g.
---
I would be over the moon if they re-released Wrath. I think it would be more popular than any other expansion they could re-release because it‚Äôs such a sweet spot of casual and hardcore.
---
Yes please!
---
I'm criticising the game because I like it and it's being mishandled. If you thing it's not being handled badly, that's your opinion, not a fact.
---
Keeping the "core" of the game the same but adding more content. Meaning, no higher level cap, no automated queue systems (LFR/LFG), no flying, no new races, no new classes, no new professions.
---
I mostly just expect officers to be responsive and willing to help. You dont always have to know the right answer, but I'd at least like a response or acknowledgement.
---
So is that a instant kill or just a tick of lava damage?
---
As a warrior, you can ride on the enemy faction's world travel vehicles. Just slap on your mitigation set, get in def stance, and make sure you aren't flagged.
---
This deserves a downvote.
---
You could store only 150% bonus exp.  
---
And you get +5% bonus exp per 8 hours offline in tavern.  
---
8*30 = 240, so 10 days.
---
Firstly, nearly everything you mentioned was prior to 1.4, which was the last major changes of really any sort in MC. But let's discuss some of them.
---
&gt;1.3 they removed engulfing flames from Onyxia (it was like Drakkisath's ability where you damaged those around you and were confused.
---
Removed the confusion (Conflagration) debuff, but upped the damage to compensate for the loss of the damage over time. "Nerf" may not be entirely accurate, but definitely less obnoxious.
---
&gt;1.4 they made the 5 second rule for spell casting, they also nerfed Golemagg and Shaz.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;They also made it so the Major Domo actually gave loot (it didnt before, and the 100% leaf/eye wasn't a thing until later yet) they also made it so each boss dropped 1 more piece of loot per kill (think its slow now?)
---
They changed the FSR, sure.  As for Golemagg and Shaz, notes "The Golemagg and Shazzrah encounters in the Molten Core has undergone some changes.". Unfortunately, I cannot find anything that tells us exactly what was changed, so calling it a nerf without some sort of proof is disingenuous.
---
Also, you basically just reiterated them fixing the loot shitshow of 1.1-1.3. Whether that's a nerf or just betterment of the game if debatable.
---
&gt;Patch 1.5 nerfed Ragnaros' stats and made lava splash happen less frequently
---
No mention of stat nerfs, not where you got that. Do you mean the range of Wrath of Ragnaros ability?
---
But yes, he was nerfed a little. Mainly having received bug fixes that make the encounter possible to complete (the bugs you mention about him not emerging and flames not depsawning, etc).
---
&gt;1.7 made the debuff limit greater than 8, and made boe epics in MC drop much more frequently
---
The debuff limit change, while resulting in things dying faster (this was for ever bit of content, not just MC/Ony), was mainly a QOL change. So many classes couldn't use hardly any of their skills because of this limitation. Hell, it's already pretty terrible with 16.
---
I see no mentionof BOE epics dropping more frequently, only some bosses dropping Fiery and Lava cores now.
---
Most of these, though we dont have the complete information (such as ability damage pre- and post-change), appear to have been fairly minor changes. The biggest seems to be the Rag changes of 1.5. Nothing else of significance happened in MC, and the only real changes in BWL were making fights work and removing the 1 hour limit on Vael.
---
All of these were while those raids were THE most recent raid (No MC changes after BWl came, and nothing to either after AQ came). So "nerfed later in the game to make intro raid more doable" isn't being truthful at all, unless you can unearth a bevy of undocumented changes that says otherwise.
---
That‚Äôs it‚Äôs a hope and a dream. But not a reality. Blizzard is likely to toss support for classic when shadowlands coming out. Which is why they redropped vanilla to boost subscriptions to gain funding for shadowlands completion. At this point they have already proven that they basically don‚Äôt give a fuck. The amount of bots and exploiting going on with no real ban waves or community out reach is very disheartening. I‚Äôm beginning to find it difficult to even log in and play other than raid night. I can‚Äôt farm without bots, I can‚Äôt do bgs without bots, or exploitive afk macros. I can‚Äôt even compete in the auction house without bots. It‚Äôs going down the drain very quickly. I still have hope that they continue the classic experience and even if they don‚Äôt do anything but actually finish the production of the original game that‚Äôs fine with me. I‚Äôd like to see all the unfinished vanilla content completed at the very least.
---
Edit: in contrast to virtually everyone on this thread, I never want to see ANY CONTENT from any expansion. Or level increases or anything of the sort, it‚Äôs not classic anymore at that point......
---
Retail has been a Diablo MMO for years.
---
There's no restriction on gear itself. You need rank only to buy it.
---
Players: lootboxes are bad, the only thing you should pay for is the complete game itself.
---
Also players: /roll gambling.
---
Your mother.
---
You can't PUG any more and the top 100 spots, which are brackets 10+ are taken permanently by the premade. You are also forced to either join them or derank.
---
lol, 90 minutes is what you meant to say I‚Äôm sure since you‚Äôre actually clearly really informed on the difficulty of mc. 
---
I don‚Äôt upload  my logs, because 1) I don‚Äôt care about people seeing how good I do. 2) logs for an average boss fight of about 75 seconds is pointless.
---
Seen people rank 10 last week spamming wsg, seems likely its competetive with AV if you do a lot of pub stomping in a good premade. At least for horde I cannot say for alliance.
---
Wrong, Blizzard is just a nickname for Activision right now.
---
Flair doesn't check out...?
---
Honestly that was happening before phase 2 on any server that had a faction imbalance. At 54 you should try running instances until you hit 60, you'll need the gear anyway so you're better off grinding for it now rather than later. Then as soon as you ding 60 you can head right to the raids. Also I believe paid world transfers are available at this point.
---
lol. og vanilla player?
---
if we talk about pve healing, why should a palading downgrade to aurorastone? the blue prebis is better, pvpwise auroa is better simply because of stats
---
You don't need to be holy to heal dungeons. The holy tree is weird in that there are only like 3 talents that actually affect the amount of healing you do, the rest is just mana restoration or other fluff. By not going Ret, you're just gimping your solo questing ability.
---
&gt;AoE grind
---
Bad idea. You can't really "aoe grind" unless you're fighting mobs like 5+ levels below you. Paladins are not Mages.
---
You just said they wouldnt even need to ban anyone, just say that they did and people would stop. Well, they said that they did, people didnt stop.
---
How the fuck do you get TBC to be one of the worst of all time?
---
And I bet you just cheered at a bot, no trinkets at level 54, every bot on my own faction looked exactly like this dude.. Oof, you really sent a message to the people who like to minmax, badass.
---
For the first iteration of Classic+ I'd like to see something like the AQ event be scripted to occur annually or once every two years, for the blood plague incident and unleashed Kazzak to be secret patched one random day of a year etc so players would literally have to discover it by accident again... and also an old AV on a calendar rotation with the current version? 
---
I feel like this would be a good way of starting with subtler "changes" without brush strokes as broad as new raids or new expansions.
---
Not a great moment for hunter gameplay, and I never liked deathknights... But Id take it over TBC any day haha.
---
Good to know making sure there isn‚Äôt some reference being missed means someone is an idiot.
---
Vanilla pvp is more about preperation, you outplay people by being prepared (rocket helm, sleep dust, gnomish net, etc...) to beat certain classes or roles.
---
Vanilla pvp is about setting up burst since everyone (not druids) have spikey dmg that usually requires doing something else first (casting time, expose armor etc).
---
fury prot is fine you just need to not be lazy with world buffs
---
what's with people here always being competitive about who's the most casual raider anyway
---
How many times are you gonna tell people about this? We get it, you're a WoW professional
---
You're correct. 
---
I enjoy the taste of that barely sentient being.
---
Have you considered that it's not a bot but someone who is watching Netflix on the other monitor and doesn't care?
---
We lose every fucking match anyways so yea
---
And making sure there isn‚Äôt some reference I can‚Äôt find is a bad thing?
---
I‚Äôve run MC once since this announcement and can confirm my and other warlocks corruptions are not being knocked of the stack and the debuff stack is definitely full. It appears there is a priority to it. While not strictly a warlock thing, it would be a glorious day if more warlocks could use corruption in raids.
---
Ah, pretty new to reddit, It's a whole new mentality for me, thanks for explaining!
---
it's not random.  you join the premades under a fake name, then you queue up with the premade and camp mid for HKs while the premade gets you free bonus honor.  get like 30-40k h/hr
---
Someone is salty lol
---
There‚Äôs no Arena PvP in Classic. It didn‚Äôt start until TBC.
---
Oh I planned on soloing DM with the hunter.  Need to know whether or not to keep both gathering professions on the hunter, or drop one for eng. 
---
If I can keep both gathering professions I was gonna drop herb off the warrior and get eng, to help dps, and tank better.
---
wtf? why are you spreading this completely wrong bullshit? pls tell me your discord tag so I can request for you to be banned there.
---
Funny considering first post in tank faq talks about fury dual weld tank having highest threat. I'm done with you goons just being wrong. Enjoy your two hr clears
---
It seems to be insta kill because it killed people in wrath when I got people to do it
---
Meanwhile alliance can easily pull only drek without any adds and Zerg him down
---
Just how god intended WoW to be.
---
The boat is the center of the universe and azeroth is flat. Wake up sheeple!
---
Then you have to stop playing. With the photo method you can post it from mobile while you continue to play.

Lol at alliance feeling like they are hot shit when a comp-balanced, high-ranked, 100% epic-mount group all on Discord rolls a pug ... **in alterac fucking valley**
---
He's being a jerk but he's really not wrong, a shadow priest isn't going to improve your warlocks by all that much. You'd be better off with another warrior, rogue or mage
---
man you're one of those lurkers
---
All it did was teach people to be at their computer while they afked so they could reply.
---
This is why they created the report feature that classic players abused as well.
---
Because it replaced vanillas entire endgame experience with a bad, off-world sci fi themed zone inhabited by blue goats. 
---
Its comparing what we lost with what we gained that makes it the worst in my book.
---
Oh ridiculous. You're playing the result of their work, two years plus of a team of programmers modernizing the codebase. Criticize blizzard if you want but if you actually think they want Classic to fail you have a lot to learn about the world.
---
you didn't pulled 1.6k dps on ***lucifron***, it was on the cleave with the adds, so the actual threat is spread.
---
This is incredible!
---
Wonder if a lvl 1 would get all the exp from discovering all those locations ...
---
Took me awhile to figure that our,. Gotta love TSM but man is it unintuitive at times.
---
Avatar, build, player character, guy, toon, it's all the same. 
---
People say stupid shit like poggers. toon isn't bad at all compared to some of the stupid slang used on the internet.
---
This isn't funny, it's just sad
---
explain to me how do you pad MC bosses.
---
Long ago in a Wow far away we would hang out late at night in the big city. Bunch of healers and we would toss heals around and talk shop. We would check out peoples gear and ask questions. maybe we'd see a lower toon and could toss em some gear. Did some RP. It was a welcome relaxation from the grind. Made alot of friends and i think we helped alot of people, good times.
---
7 inches deep in your mom
---
when you're alliance AND buttmad. oof
---
There also wasnt discord servers with cross server queues.
---
He's trying to start a competitive pvp group, there's nothing wrong with asking for the biggest indicator of skill in pvp -  arena rating. Let him play his he wants.
---
Google ironfoege pro. Go to the demographics and select region
---
Grats! I got mine after 800-ish kills. I wasn‚Äôt really even farming for it exactly, but rather the small flame sacs the whelps also drop. Those are a good moneymaker on my realm for sub-30s.
---
Whelps are my second favorite pet in Classic, the first being the sprite darter hatchling you get from the quest chain in Feralas. But that one‚Äôs easy to get and not so impressive. I do miss the sounds they make when you click on them though. I‚Äôm not sure if they were added in TBC or Wrath.
---
Lots of people like the oozeling the best, but I never understood the appeal of that one.
---
Yeah you're probably talking to hardcore players. In MC speed runs there's no such thing as giving a tank time to get aggro. Nobody holds back, not even for half a second. If tank loses aggro due to bad crit luck or whatever, the warrior who stole aggro is gonna tank.
---
This was memetastic.
---
If you're not getting flurry, I'm a bit curious what your build is, since I consider flurry as a primary reason to consider going Fury, period. Helps with damage and rage gen considerably.
---
As for weapon speed: I think it's *generally* an over-emphasized component of weapon choice. For tanking, a fast weapon means a smoother (less spiky) rage gen, and the ability to get white damage on multiple targets faster. It also means weaker WWs, but w/out Tact Mastery I assume you aren't WWing often. Faster weapons are also easier to not be rage-capped, but that is not as issue one needs to consider very often. Overall, weapon stats and dps are often more important considerations than weapon spees.
---
For weapon speed as it relates to Flurry, I really don't think it matters. Flurry procs on crits and lasts 3 swings (iirc), meaning a faster weapon will proc it more, but also burn the charges faster. I doubt it makes much of a difference.
---
You took offense to a joking comment about our class.. welcome to the real world huntard
---
Hi! I recently dinged 60 as a Warrior. I play on a PvP server. I find pre-raid BiS grinding kinda fun but I want to enjoy Classic in a variety of ways, for now leveling my professions. However, whenever I go to grind mining(or anything other node-related in the world) I keep getting ganked by 60 mages.  
---
Are there any ways for me to counter 60 mages? I stopped playing for a couple of weeks because the non-stop instanced content gets stale after a while
---
Never played pvp, as I'm in a pve server. What does healers do in all these battle grounds? Do I heal like in a raid? How do I get HK then?
---
Ironforge.pro/servers
---
Try joining the LFG channel.
---
Just because you're not part of it doesn't mean it isn't happening.
---
I have and it‚Äôs just a bunch of people asking what I‚Äôm asking and it‚Äôs from decade ago. None of the old stuff works since blizz has decided to use this bastard stepchild of an engine combining the macro systems.
---
Thank you though!
---
What‚Äôs wrong with you? 
---
Fury prot is fine. It‚Äôs suboptimal threat but it‚Äôs better dps. It‚Äôs pretty simple.
---
Like, what the fuck are you even on about? I‚Äôm not arguing for or against competitive or casual raiding. If you want to tank as fury prot be my guest, idgaf. If you want to tank as deep prot go for it.
---
I‚Äôm only arguing against people here spreading false information.
---
These are the facts as of current build:
---
1.) Deep prot is more TPS than fury prot right
---
now. This build is good enough for most guilds.
---
2.) Fury-prot is more dps. Any guild can use fury prot, but it shines and makes more sense in serious guilds
---
Again, I don‚Äôt care what you tank as just so long as you don‚Äôt come here saying fury prot is more threat than deep prot right now, because that is flat out false.
---
Whatever that means.
---
epic questlines for each class.
---
New raid with the item criteria in the op, and tomes with new ranks for skills like in aq.
---
New crafting recipes
---
Would probably end up broken, but an endgame reward (quest item dropped from the last boss) for some extra talent points.
---
Heavily disagree. TBC did a great job of leading you from zones to dungeons to raids.
---
None, because 2019 Blizzard is 2019 Blizzard, you're heading straight back to retail 2.0 when they start updating the game.
---
&gt;lol, 90 minutes is what you meant to say I‚Äôm sure since you‚Äôre actually clearly really informed on the difficulty of mc. 
---
&gt;I don‚Äôt upload  my logs, because 1) I don‚Äôt care about people seeing how good I do. 2) logs for an average boss fight of about 75 seconds is pointless.
---
Yikes dude. In case you didn't know, world record is around half an hour and on private servers clearing sub one hour was the norm. Don't claim classic wow isn't hard and at the same time putzing through the content at a snails pace. Also you're right boss kill times are pointless. That's why raid clear speed is the standard. Logs show far more than just boss kill times. A single wipe however would unravel your stance, which is why you won't share your logs.
---
Did you get a definitive answer to this? I saw on I think icy veins that you should start replacing once you have 3 peices of t2, but my hope is that theyre just wrong.
---
I actually got it working. I‚Äôll post the correct one when I get on my pc!
---
if you run into molten core with no buffs and still get to use sunder armor etc of course a regular ass prot build is going to be more threat
---
you can't talk about this kinda shit in a vacuum
---
are you world buffed? is your raid using exposed armor and you need to queue hs? you really think an equally threat geared fully buffed deep prot tank can hold aggro over fury prot or dw fury prot??
---
100%. I don‚Äôt even care if I lose if it only takes 5-10 minutes. I‚Äôm always like ‚ÄúOh, well, ok..‚Äù
---
There are a couple gear checks in BWL but most of them are for the tanks. And as others have said, not all MC gear is an upgrade to the pre-raid BiS.
---
Unless you're the MT, you could be naked and still get carried through any raid if the rest of the group is good. Is BWL possible if the *whole raid* doesn't have *any* MC/Ony gear? Probably, but it would be much much harder.
---
Stop I hate that song
---
parroting shit you've read from the discord but don't have the full picture of what we're ever talking about
---
Its not fun to stand there doing nothing because the tank isn't playing properly.
---
bet you could make an addon that does a random proven +karma phrase every time you /roll
---
An officer in a hardcore guild is a very different job than an officer in a more casual guild. Establish your rules. The rules that existed before don't matter anymore. You talk to everyone who stuck around and figure out what they think. Stick to 1 raid only (You can split your raid in half for ony). If there is 1 thing I can impress on you, it's this. Officers can't do a single thing right, if they don't know what's expected of them. You need to get your NON officers to start speaking up about things. People who don't communicate their frustrations in a healthy way cause problems later. Raiders sometimes expect officers to magically fix all their problems. You need to list more specific information about your guild if you want better advice. I dont even know how you do loot, for instance.
---
Pulling 30 mobs in sm solo as a warrior, okay bud
---
Timber has more of a reddish tint to it rather than a traditional brown or black.
---
Dude, single sweaty nerds in basements have made vanilla servers. Better ones than this.
---
It's between intentional and utter incompetence, does it really make a difference in the end?
---
I guess I vastly underestimated how gullible some people are.
---
And here I am, made over 6k just selling enchants, not even mats‚Ä¶ LUL
---
This dude knows whats up!
---
Rank 10 isnt even worth it.  I feel bad for all y'all grinding it. 
---
I'm play my switch and wait for bwl brothers.
---
Honestly if my two options are naxx forever or starting fresh then id rather quit. Going the OSRS route has the highest potential to me. Im loving classic but I dont want to just play the same thing forever, I want new content.
---
Please tell me you use some consumables.
---
Scholo is a fucking joke?
---
Our guild does designated speed runs every few weeks once everyone has another 5-10% more worth of upgrades. It‚Äôs fun. :)
---
Yup. Miles cheaper and less time consuming to farm. I have a mountain of flasks stashed for BWL. I remember the nightmare of that place. Still my 2nd fave Vanilla raid though.
---
You will get credit for kills you assisted in whether that be healing someone or damage, just need to be near the action.
---
Exactly.
---
K.
---
My druid's the same level. Shimmering flats, Arathi highlands, and desolace have quests around this level.
---
It‚Äôs almost like the whole game is easy and is a no life simulator? Bigger player base means more competition for your pvp rank...guess that‚Äôs no fun for you.
---
Well WoD was the literal worst for all trade skills most stuff people did on their own in a garrison or on an alt.
---
It‚Äôs been interesting watching all these people sprint into a marathon. It used to be the running joke that only no-lifers reached Grand Marshall or High Warlord back in the day, but they could never keep up with the pace these guys have set today.
---
It‚Äôll be interesting to see how long they can maintain it. People are gonna have mental breakdowns over 18-22 hour days in AV for months on end, lol.
---
lol ok.
---
Your tanks can taunt the mobs while they still have 1 second left on banish, and then they will immediately turn towards the tank before using their fireball stun. With proper positioning this still prevents multiple people getting hit
---
Flasks? For any Classic raids? Egads.
---
Aurastone is terrible for pallys, and most guilds give that to the druids, Our 1st mageblade went to a holy pally aswell.
---
Well using a 100g flask for Mc is dumb. But having consumes and world buffs is just respectful to the raid.
---
Very Alliance heavy here. I can't recommend rolling Horde here for RP reasons, but I've had great experiences with walk up and event based RP alliance side.
---
Aside from RP, I've enjoyed communities in both sides and definitely think it's worth transferring here for the server feel alone.
---
What?
---
Boots of the Shadow Flame. He literally provided you a link to the item.
---
You'r*
---
Warriors basically go from wet noodles at 1-59 then once you hit 60 and start gearing the scaling is amazing
---
you are taking about hivemind and yet you can only mention fight club. pls post this bullshit there rn i wanna see you getting banned for spreading wrong information like this
---
check wclogs for top 100 MC guilds worldwide and show me how many are deep prot, pls.
---
Imagine blindly believing the hive mind without researching for yourself..... topkek
---
Get world buffs. Only/rend, dm tribute buffs, elixirs, firewater, food, blasted lands consumable and song flower. May have forgot some. 
---
These buffs increase your damage more than any gear upgrade ever could.
---
Plan your CDs. Usually use AR after getting your first long SND up so you can evis during it. Use tea after AR. Use BF when there are 2 mobs close to aoe a bit.
---
I use cheap arcane elixer. Cheap fire prot potion and cheap mana pots and MP5 soup.
---
Prob one of ten people using that much. 90-100min Mc clears. Can't even remember last time we had 40 people even.
---
Last week was like 2 hour clear though but we had 28 people.
---
MC is not hard. It's free gear for later raids.
---
Just stay away from Dwarven Hand Cannons.
---
If I purchase a character transfer, can I move my character from a US-West realm to a US-East realm? The official info is that you can't transfer into a different "region," but it gives examples of "EU, US, Asia" suggesting that US West and US East are in the same region.
---
Can anyone confirm whether I could move from US West to US East?
---
Can someone add "How far I'll go" (Moana) to this video?
---
Druids now keep the noggenfogger buff after shape shifting
---
I hate blizzard probably more than you do for way more personal reasons. I literally worked there. But you're just grossly missinformed. I know people love to hate but you're talking Out your ass
---
Considering how based towards alliance the server is, I've never had an issue even with low level dungeons.
---
I‚Äôve found shadowburn is only used while moving and when you don‚Äôt have time to get a last sb off. In the former you have time to lt so mana doesn‚Äôt matter as much. An argument can be made by using it while isb is up but in a raid those are are better consumed by other shadowbolts.
---
I put 2 free points into cataclysm and the other two into destructive reach. Technically you get 4% more mana so possibly another shadow bolt before lifetap but the utility of 6 extra yards is well worth the loss for me.
---
I love my succy in everything but raids. She is just to fragile and a distraction to keep alive. I too would like to hear from others who have found raid utility with her.
---
allow catform to keep run speed 30% indoors..

Any tips for farming this?
---
lol thinking of lowbies as children definitely makes it a lot funnier
---
Yeah of course, their CPMs are shit, their gear is shit, their buffs are shit. Still the claim that prot does more TPS than fury-prot is wrong
---
Yup. I‚Äôm the healing lead and raid lead as backup. I don‚Äôt require flasks from my peeps, but food, GFPs, regular consumables - they‚Äôd better have them. 
---
I‚Äôm still out to lunch if to require flasks for BWL. It wasn‚Äôt overly hard back in Vanilla and there‚Äôs really no trash. Meh. We‚Äôll see. Not a fan of flasks that are so freaking expensive when we can take 30 different consumables. (Okay, not quite 30...)

I‚Äôd be scared of an autoban for movement speed or something lol

---
Pve skill or parses? Lolol rng and irrelevant 15 year old game
---
Everyone has an excuse for being worse than others. Theres a reason why these people play wow and not a competitive game.
---
Can you do it with noob blue gear and ravager? Also I‚Äôm an arms spec lel. Struggle is real.
---
No one holds it against people for doin it, what is held against them is the mentality and personality that often comes with it. 
---
Calling people drains, selfish for ‚Äúmeme‚Äù specs, hurting their guilds by playing those specs, should play the only ‚Äúviable‚Äù spec for their class. 
---
Often those builds do less personal damage, but help increase the raids overall damage. 
---
Hemo-rogue: harder hitting, ret paladin, imp blessing as part of the build, boom/feral druids, more crits, etc.
---
No one has a problem with min-maxing, hey have a problem with the personality that often comes with it. I have tons of min-maxers in my guild and they LOVE the meme specs. Why? Because memespecs often buff the other specs, which means bigger numbers.
---
But, you get on these forums and everyone refuses to look at anything but their optimized spreadsheets in an optimal scenario with naxx level coordination and anything that deviates is treated as trash. 
---
Guild clears MC no problem in 1:45 in a stress free light hearted way. We have feral, boom, arms, etc. if we have problems in progression? Then we will push the respec. Until then I find ‚Äúmeme‚Äù players tend to be more helpful to the guild overall than min-maxxers who spend all their time helping themselves. Donate consumes etc because it just comes with type of personality that is attracted to doing whatever they enjoy over min-maxing. At least they try instead of picking the easiest path to numbers.
---
You‚Äôll also find out that without IMP sap talent you‚Äôll break stealth once a target is sapped. I don‚Äôt recommend taking the talent but if you want to stay stealthed you‚Äôll need it.

I rolled horde because I like Undead on my PvE server.

Well maybe the first few runs it might be helpful. But having DM buffs and ony head is probably okay, your melee may want to pick up songflower as well.

Shooting star playing in the distance
---
I removed MANY people from Bgs back in the day, and while that was only a small part of it, it was cause of the fact that there were millions of players and only like 500 GMs.  There weren't enough of us to individually go in and solve the problem, cuz there were 100s of realms with the same issue.
---
The GM net wasn't able to catch them all, but it did catch some.
---
4g per cathedral run is robbery, on my warrior I sold it for 2g and felt bad... Greedy mages strike again!
---
If you don't understand, it's alright, not everyone noticed, and most forgot. It sucks that you missed it, but I don't think you ever cared about stuff like that anyways.
---
The disappointment was negative but you are wrong to think that upset me. It makes the memories of that time all the more cherished, that it wasn't just a game that made it special.
---
Yup. Christmas week raid, I took in 24 people and we had a two hour clean clear. We farm it when bored too for peeps and mats.
---
This is actually what Blizzard wanted back when Burning Crusade was first released. 5v5 arena was supposed to be the main focus, 2v2 and 3v3 were just a bonus.
---
5v5 in S1/S2 ended up being really boring and stale. Every team needed a Warrior (for Mortal Strike), an Elemental Shaman (for on-demand burst), and a Holy Paladin (the only healer who could survive the other team's burst). Then about halfway through the expansion, Blizzard started to homogenize classes and changed the focus to 3v3 arena instead of 5's... and that's how we ended up with retail.
---
They do. And tribute runs when they wanna.
---
Why would you waste that much bag space on elemental water??  It has very low value and only stacks to 10.  A stack is worth about 60s.  It MIGHT go up to 2g stack during naxx, but probably not even that. You could literally buy one black lotus or countless other valuable items that would take up much less space and increase in value much more.
---
People really make same wacky investment choices in this game.
---
&gt; As long as the boss dies in a timely manner why do you honestly care so much?
---
That's the point, the boss will NOT die in a timely manner in harder content if you waste a DPS slot on someone who does abysmal DPS.
---
Will the boss die? Yeah maybe, but it will be much harder on everyone especially during progression.
---
You can be a meme spec on farm content. Just be your best spec in progression.
---
&gt; They refuse to factor in all of the additional things something like a ret or boomkin does and only look at spreadsheets.
---
They bring nothing that a holy paladin or resto druid don't. This is why ret pallies are often wielding a weapon like Nightfall, because their base kit is so absolutely useless without it that they either spec as holy, or wield Nightfall.
---
And any DPS class will bring much much higher DPS.
---
&gt; Why assume that wanting to play a different spec has any bearing on work ethic?
---
You can do whatever you want, but we can also do the same.
---
Why are you trying to force memers on others so much? Meme specs are unwanted for a reason. There's not a single class that doesn't have a viable and wanted raid spec. So why insist on being a meme?
---
Because he got his Blue set and then had no need to PvP ever again.

Reminds me of the vanilla AQ gate opening event when lots of people ended up on the boat in Stonetalon.
---
he basically means just having like resistances, armor, health, instead of just "resil"
---
If you are losing key dps during trash, you aren't in the speed running scene.  I
---
A single fire protection potion would mitigate 99% of deaths from fire blossoms. It's not just for bosses.
---
Simply because I got the blue pvp set I need for PVE, and because I cba to be in AV ever again
---
Is that a combat text add on?
---
What's funny is that the horde fucked themselves over in wpvp by mass ganking and forcing alliance to stop playing, emptying entire servers and making the rest a 5 hour hunt for a red thing to click on. And now the same thing is happening - pugs are disappearing, making queues insanely long and making the only matchup horde get to be a premade that stomps their shit in 10 minutes. Right now they win against the bad premades, but those are quickly getting less and less as discords purge the shitters.
---
But hey, let's not expect long-term thinking from people who rolled something just because a youtube video said it's better.
---
Not a shared cooldown. Nothing stops you from using ToEP first, then MQG, then ToEP again once it's off cooldown in a 2-minute bossfight.
---
Therefore, making an argument that MQG makes TOEP obsolete is wrong?
---
And for the time being, a mage does make much better use of TOEP than a Warlock thanks to the Arcane Power talent.
---
Guy above you has his panties in a wad, It didn‚Äôt seem you took offense to anything
---
What‚Äôs your gear my dude. We seem to have a similar one but I don‚Äôt crit that hard
---
There are multiple areas and even dunegons/raids that cannot be accessed without flying mounts.
---
Also the netherwing faction exists only to reward a flying mount.
---
I thought it appropriate. They need do nothing at all besides be present. Put me on follow for all I care, hell I don‚Äôt even mind if they take loot (unless it‚Äôs the scarlet boots, those sons of bitches will be mine someday!).
---
Precisely, there‚Äôs no reason not to bring more.
---
Does TSM show the drop rate/location or is that something else?
---
Maybe they just don't have someone who has one geared or maybe that player just wasn't on but they wanted to still play.
---
Should work now, was a bug with capitalizing the entity_type (eg. Quest)

---
I think you are missing that you can lifetap in about 2/1 ratio back so if it is up 10 secs it‚Äôs paid for itself anything after that is free mana/health. Very nice to chain pulling while farming or fear kiting elites in open areas like winter spring.
---
Just do new content that follows vanilla philosophy.  
---
  Extremely easy to replicate once you're just following, instead of creating new systems.  
---
  From there on they can do whatever they want really, modern wow is a problem of game play design, the rest is always top notch.  
---
  My ideal scenario would be to start with one or two raids/big dungeons a la blackrock spire for the first patches that focus on new gear that enables other specs or pumps up classes, a legendary bow, mana gear for oomkins and eles, etc.
---
lol yes!
---
Rebalancing the classes and new gear to fill gaps. Additional raid tiers with Classic catch up philosophy. More crafted end game content. More bg ideas.
---
Keep same level cap. Use wisdom from developing retail and observing other mmos to develop wow classic. Perhaps have this be a new timeline.
---
It's a great server but keep in mind it's an RP server, it has a set of special naming rules, can't be named "dpwnerlol" or they make you change your name, they also crack down pretty fast on people griefing or trolling RP events, it's insanely active on Alliance side, Horde side is pretty damn dead sadly.

I farmed about 2k gold in cath with dual wield fury. It's better than 2 handed because you almost never miss against low levels and the bloodthirst healing is huge, I healed somewhere around 30-40% of damage taken. Skip to the final room, pull 2-3 at a time, use hamstring liberally to avoid runners. When death wish is up you can pull 4 or more to get maximum value out of it. Don't bother killing the guy in the back room as the items he drops are unique. Hearth to UC when your bags are full and repeat. If you're clearing faster than 5 times an hour, use your extra time to clear some of the trash in the courtyard. I got my runs down to 10 minutes with good gear. About 35gph overall.
---
Why the hell do you people even want tbc "but without this, and that, and the other, and that other thing".   
---
  Then it's suddenly not tbc, much easier to just accept tbc was a flawed expansion and progress to classic+ than trying to reach a consensus on what tbc classic should be and fuck the game up.
---
queue "I've been banned and only get auto responses from gm's"
---
If 1 sweaty nerd can handle 1/100th of it for free, I'm not entirely certain 
---
You're also completely disregarding the fact that tanking classic IS in their short-term benefit - a large amount of the gaming population mindlessly follows streamers. The biggest criticism that is tanking retail right now was streamers who were shitting on mostly how far the game has departed from its roots.
---
By providing a terrible experience, they'd essentially shut down all their criticisms of retail immediately. 
---
Which would boost short-term profits with sales of shadowlands, for example.
---
Epic
---
I ain‚Äôt forcing anything on anyone, I am against the mentality of shitting on people who enjoy playing it differently. I got nothing against min-maxxers, I got a problem with assholes, who tend to be more vocal, and the mechanism for their assholeness comes out in their min-maxing.
---
You are saying that they can only play one way, I am saying both ways can be played as long as everyone involved doesn‚Äôt care.  You all seem to think anyone not min-maxing is a drain and call them as such. That is the problem.
---
I would take 100% a ‚Äúmeme‚Äù spec who farms consumes and shares them with the guild over some min-max who shaves less than 1 minute total off a full clear and is a self-righteous douchebag who talks about his Guildmates as a drain.
---
But then again, I don‚Äôt see how spending 2 hours+ getting consumes for a sub two hour raid down to sub 1 hour is efficient use of time right now. Maybe my idea of ‚Äúmin-max‚Äù is different but that strikes me as inefficient.
---
Technically Vanilla never saw the game in this state.
---
1,12 AV, Crossrealm and no Arathi Basin never existed at the same time.
---
This experience is definitely classic and is off the grid from the Vanilla map.
---
Asking for RETAIL arena score for vanilla content is stupid, it's no indicator of vanilla skill whatsoever, you might aswell ask what their fucking GPA that'll be just as useful information
---
Not OP, but I run the typical arms PvP spec 31/20/0. I‚Äôm in mostly pre-raid BiS including both devilsaur leather pieces with the rare mace from the dire maul quest (bone-something). Without a healer i would keep the pulls down to 5 mobs personally, burning health potions gets expensive.
---
I do.
---
So fantastic that I skipped it entirely on my retail character.
---
I'm not talking about twitch chat either. People say it outside of chat. People even say it in person. 
---
 
---
When a redheaded kid is born, their name isn't ginger, but we still call them that :p
---
You aren‚Äôt posting a lot then imo... maybe I‚Äôm wrong. Try selling 400 silk by the unit lol
---
Sounds pretty 1500 rated in here.
---
How important is Escape Artist as a Warlock for PvP? I'm not exactly a min maxxer but I do want to be able to have a good time in PvP. My mage is 60 already, and I'm about to roll a lock. I would prefer to do human for the aesthetics since I'm kinda over being a gnome, but I wasn't sure how vital escape artist is for a lock.
---
From my understanding, they're not a super mobile class, and most of the classes that can root or snare you, can just do it again right away anyway, so how important really is escape artist?
---
You are a real gamer
---
I see :( I just hate having a 60% mount lmao. I‚Äôm also like 300g away from the epic ram mount from AV. 
---
I guess I‚Äôll just spam dungeons for the juicy pre-bis in the meantime then, thank you for the advice!
---
He's right.  Also, most people that play it, don't do it right.   They're not stacking world buffs, and max consumables, which just makes it even worse.  The only thing fury/prot is really better at is dps, and snap threat.
---
Good job! Solid work.
---
It's also kind of bullshit. The only time I had to walk through any alliance controlled areas was to go to badlands, and that was through loch modan, the level 10-20 leveling zone, while I was level 40. Real dangerous.
---
I do have kangs decapacitator, but also have the option of buying that juicy 2h from AV. But I‚Äôm like 300g away from the epic AV mount. Im too conflicted right now on what to buy lmao.
---
The token shadow priest in my guild farmed out his pre bis healing set on top of his shadow set. Many big ticket items are just a matter of money, the chest and cloak are just an amount of gold
---
since when is dropping some truth "taking offense"?
---
Ehhh, just by how you're writing it's pretty obvious that's not why you were kicked (twice, which is trying to say you got an extremely unlikely situation twice in a row)
---
If you don't like retail that's fine, no need to bs
---
That's great for you.  Nobody asked for your flex, I was asking for advice.  Thanks though
---
&gt; edit: yep, daily reddit user. big surprise.
---
damn got me lmao
---
Auctioneer
---
I don't think anyone is forgetting that.  It's about what gear to aim for, how to allocate/prioritize your DKP, and when you eventually *do* get all this gear, what you should use and when.
---
It's okay though, min/maxing isn't for everyone.
---
Switching at level 40 or 50 is easy. Switching at 60 after 12 weeks of MC gear and rank 7 isn't.
---
I'd say give it a shot for an hour or two and see how much gph you get out of it.
---
The PvP titles are kinda lame and the only way to remove them is de-rank via DHKs
---
Uhh, why are you in cloth in PvP?
---
Amen!
---
Nice! I‚Äôve been there everyday still no drop I hate you :D
---
Is that bannable? It only changes your char on your screen, not to everyone right
---
I have seen some streamers using it...so I am assuming it is safe to use?
---
How about not taking this into account?
---
Crit is by far the best stat for paladins, since it increases throughput while also restoring mana through the passive. Also, Mageblade also has +12 Int which gives additional max mana and even more spellcrit.
---
&gt;I think I've found the greedy paladin.
---
Paladins have like 5 items from MC that are worthwhile upgrades over their PreBIS, and none of them are class-specific. Meanwhile Mages have the luxury of having multiple very good Tier pieces which they can roll on with no competition from other classes, but somehow that's not enough and they still feel entitled to having a priority on other items, and make up excuses to lock out competing classes. 
---
But sure, the Paladin who rolls like 3 times total in 4 lockouts is the greedy one.
---
It is true that realms stuffed with no-lifers have inflated prices due to the economy being replete with fortunes.
---
Mid 30s ret Pali here. In a few dungeons I‚Äôve been asked to tank, so I throw on my shield and try. But I feel like I have minimal aggro control without a taunt. Any tips?
---
&gt; You are saying that they can only play one way 
---
They can play anyway they want, but this is a social game, they have to be accepted in a place that embraces the way they play. If there are no places that want them, then they need to change.
---
This is how any society functions. If you don't add perceived value, you have to change to be accepted by the group.
---
&gt; I ain‚Äôt forcing anything on anyone 
---
You are. You literally want min-maxers to take memers against their desires. That's the height of entitlement.
---
&gt; But then again, I don‚Äôt see how spending 2 hours+ getting consumes for a sub two hour raid down to sub 1 hour is efficient use of time right now. Maybe my idea of ‚Äúmin-max‚Äù is different but that strikes me as inefficient. 
---
Because min-maxers are looking to break certain records. Like their own weekly run time, or their boss kill times. So they don't care about wasting time outside the targeted activity to achieve their goals.
---
&gt; I am against the mentality of shitting on people who enjoy playing it differently. I got nothing against min-maxxers, I got a problem with assholes, who tend to be more vocal, and the mechanism for their assholeness comes out in their min-maxing.   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; I would take 100% a ‚Äúmeme‚Äù spec who farms consumes and shares them with the guild over some min-max who shaves less than 1 minute total off a full clear and is a self-righteous douchebag who talks about his Guildmates as a drain. 
---
More stuff about stereotyping min-maxers as elitist jerks. Just shows you've never dealt with any guild that min-maxes.
---
Most min-maxers I've played with for the past 15 years were chill dudes who just wanted to take their progress seriously.
---
ranking in this system is not about fun. this is not elo rating. how hard that is to understand.
---
the real issue is not being able to pre-made as horde. it's like playing league of legends in a ranking queue with ppl ranging from challenger to iron
---
Just have server-wide LFG and I‚Äôm happy.
---
OMG This! So much this! Show some basic bloody consideration and let the guild know you wont be back. We've had a ton of ppl just ghosting us after a few raids, luckily no well geared tanks.
---
* level cap is still 60
---
* outland and northrend exist as zones you need to gear up to enter
---
* fill in the extra areas like that one guy did to assist with the gear requirements
---
* adjust the gear or something so that people who are in full wrath gear dont one-shot fresh 60s
---
* more class specific or race specific quest chains. 
---
* draenei and blood elves and death knights all need to be unlocked the same way allied races are on live, but perhaps a bit less grindy.
---
Think the timer was removed since people abused it too much to get guildies into the same AV. Hasnt helped for people I have reported &amp; definelty more than 10+ people have reported also. Read earlier that it was removed and think it has not been added back. :)
---
'Give us free wins or we shoot pvp in the head!'
---
Good bot
---
And people wonder why no one wants to tank when this is the mentality they have to deal with.
---
No there is no list
---
This doesn't really make sense, even if I agree with your sentiment at the end. 
---
In a vacuum would be your scenario where there is only a ret paladin available. 
---
If the ret paladins are so kind and generous, why limit to just one? Several spec variations can grab all the useful talents. (Also, I think this tends to be a trait of people who play paladins, the min-maxxers are more the minority.)
---
Also, a holy paladin can parse pretty similar on DPS :/ so taking one to dps over a ret paladin wouldn't make much difference. 
---
But yes, the min-max mentality is typically more toxic. Which is why my guild recruits based on skill &amp; personality, rather than just one or the other.
---
Can someone with 5Head brain explain this shit?
---
I dunno, I think dps not giving the tank even 2 seconds to get aggro and pulling doesnt make them a bad tank.
---
I want some sense of community. World pvp was fun because we started to know each other, that‚Äôs when banter and taunts flourishes. I don‚Äôt play for the r14 I play for the fun ‚Äòn salt
---
I think we all need more information here. Unless someone has put an bounty on you, there is no reason your being camped for 2 weeks at level 25. Not saying it is impossible, but it doesn't add up. Like are trying to turn in Helcular's Revenge, guards are killing you, and I think it's the alliance? What server are you on and what area are you leveling in?
---
You need engineering on your hunter to do solo trib runs.
---
Horde still has to wait 20 minutes either way.
---
Good god. And here my 5 year old kid is asking what I'm laughing at...
---
alliance rush is always faster and easier due to terrain. if both rush without anyone defending whatsoever alliance will always win, making horde honor gain extremely garbage, which is why horde has to focus on objectives and stall alliance enough
---
Wouldn't you lose it over time because of decay? (I assume rank 1 can be lost) Or it's not how it works lol.
---
can't really be skilled it you don't play tho
---
Go for aesthetics
---
Im the 10 everytime. Feelsbadman
---
unfortunately this 1st season is horde-only
---
You went full circle, back to thinking that FC, the most active warriors discord, is devoid of high tier players, who are most likely to engage with that type of social feature.
---
Sure, mate. 200 IQ.
---
See my second paragraph my friend, I say exactly this
---
Although it could be pricey, maybe respeccing enough into Fury to get Howl would help? Shoot maybe some frost resist potions would give you a chance against the nova.
---
I see what you mean though. I wouldn't want to grind back up to 60 either. Not without a partner or group at least.
---
A couple of things you can try:
---
* Respec Holy to get consecrate for the AoE threat (this would hurt you solo capability though).  After the 11 points you can go back to ret
---
* Tank with a two hander, it shouldn't be that hard to heal through with the trash mobs (ask your healer though)
---
* Use seal of righteousness for constant holy damage
---
* Utilize retribution aura for constant holy damage as well (dev if the healer is having a tough time)
---
* Keep an eye on the healer if mobs start chasing them and utilize blessing of protection to pull them back and continue to generate threat on the mob
---
* edit: Also righteous fury as mentioned below
---
Seems like he did a lot.
---
First of all, hunters are physical damage. Second, he's talking about the *scaling* favouring physical damage dealers, which implies he's talking about later than the second phase. We've only got MC/Ony gear available, scaling has barely even begun to start yet.
---
I really doubt that. Wotlk is widely regarded as peak WoW. Why would people want to go back to vanilla after that?
---
You play WoW because you want people to notice you?
---
Yes, I am very biased indeed to think that mages deserve a 50/50 on TOEP! Insanely unfair for warlocks I must say! They must get every one of these super rare trinkets, that's totally fair and justified, certainly not biased.
---
I'm glas that you added an edit, conceding that you're wrong, but somehow I'm still the one biased. Funny, isn't it. And no, warlocks don't get priority on tear of neltharion. It's an another insanely unfair 50/50(LOL), though if a mage already has a TOEP, he's not participating.
---
facts over your feels bro
---
Did you play in Cata? I enjoyed surv spec then with black arrow and explosive shot.
---
The convenient part is that it makes it easier to purchase static value upgrades such as your epic mount. But mage t1 bracers are 2k gold, lmao.
---
Hahaha
---
Grob mob
---
The sad thing is rank 9 isn't even close to half way if you're only hitting it now, assuming you get maximum RP every week rank 11 is the half way mark, if not you'll be spending months at 12/13.
---
they removed the ability to instakick people with afk reports. the debuff system is still there.
---
Edit:  Nice. Rogues can beat many classes but take a high amount of skill to beat some 
---
Think: druid, warrior, plate classes
---
Mages get beat by the following: spriests, locks, rogues (50/50) can also get beat by a hunter, druids. Lol, there's so many counters to both of these classes it's funny
---
holy shit, you losers need to go outside.  15 year trash ez mode game, and you are talking like this shit matters at all.  You probably couldn't do a mythic if you life depended on it, but you are really pro about defeating the character selection screen boss, and abusing every exploit imaginable in a 15 year old game.
---
Will do, thank you again!
---
My friends and I went hard getting preraid BiS. Just to have freshly hit 60s in greens join the raid and snipe our gear. I lost cauterizing band to a 58 shaman and staff of dominance to a druid with all questing gear.
---
Fucking MC pugs. Still not happy about it.
---
Rank 1 cannot be lost.
---
Botting happened a lot back in vanilla as well and went unbanned, the big difference here is that AV actually 'pops' 24/7, it did not in during vanilla (pre CR at least). But during Call to Arms alterac valley there was always bots active
---
Been trying so hard to find an addon like battlegroundtargets in classic, anyone know what it's called?
---
well you can call this hyperwarp
---
Transmog. Not even once.
---
I'm full BiS for phase 1 and 2 as a ret paly. I have bone reavers and hand of rag. You dont do as much damage as the tank! So?
---
Reminds me of the old days of going to GM Island. You would download this thing and put it into your files and the zeppelin would take you to gm island
---
That server was around 60/40 before the migration.
---
No, yea, no. 
---
Engineering is always a good idea. You literally have only PvE deeper in combat with no pvp or literally no pve in sub tree at all. 
---
Either good at pvp or good at pve. While you won't be as good in pvp in pve spec, you will be pretty bad in pve as pvp spec. 
---
Idk tho, this is for swords. Backstab is both pve and pvp with daggers so daggers might be not so bad in pve and pvp in opposite specs.
---
Robe of the void is bis &gt;.&gt;
---
I meant Flurry Axe not the talent.
---
&gt;it has 1 counter therefor it's not broken
---
lol
---
Oh no that would be horrible
---
Or, you know, don‚Äôt post boring shit. Majority of pvp videos don‚Äôt show people riding to the battle master and waiting in que for 15 minutes for a reason. No one wants to watch a pvp video of some riding a mount for three minutes.
---
Shamans on the bottom wtf? I guess not enough did NOT play the memespec...
---
Yeah we should just stick to the Vanilla PvP system which is so much better and doesn't have any downsides... with arena, the game actually requires you to have skill to get the best PvP gear in the game unlike Classic. Would like to hear your argument for why they're shit and shouldn't be a thing other than 'it makes it like vanilla'
---
False world first post about false world firsts
---
See the context of the conversation you joined in my friend instead of expecting people to act like your comment is in a vacuum.  You responded to someone responding to someone saying "Any tank who focuses on defense is automatically a shit tank" - Note a shit tank, not just misprioritizing gear.  You then said that anyone who doesnt go for X specific build is a bad tank(versus something like sub-optimal or not in the top 5%).
---
One is a character/abilities statement, the other is a statement factoring in different priorities.  Which one do you think is going to have a positive or negative reaction? Or are you one of those a-social idiots that think word choice doesnt matter?
---
Is there an equal amount of duels across the classes?  Do each class duel and equal amount vs every class?  What's the individual win rate and # of duels of the people within a class(are there a few people with a lot of activity)?
---
As someone who's never heard of of this dueling league, this stat is extremely pointless
---
Imagine you stole that from a poor hunter..
---
Latest path to GM Island
---
Your minimap looks like it‚Äôs tripping on lsd
---
Well, if it‚Äôs mana/rage/energy it‚Äôs a dead giveaway tho
---
But a mage without arcane power doesn't use it any worse than a warlock - they are equal. Your logic of "not better than briarwood reed" would apply to both.
---
This is also quite incorrect. Even with MQG you will want to fit in arcane power+presence of mind frostbolt at the very end/start of TOEP before/after activating MQG to maximize the DPS. While it is indeed correct to use arcane power with MQG, getting off that presence of mind frostbolt improved  by both arcane power and TOEP is optimal.
---
It is also a lot better than briarwood reed on average. It's worth between 30 and 175 flat spellpower depending on the length of an encounter, with an average of ~70.
---
As much as I love using a shield, strictly speaking Lei is better for that scenario.
---
Brother may I have some [item[Thunderfury]] amirite?? Xddddd
---
Link me a clip and I'll edit the post. I'm level 60 as you might have guessed (so I don't have the talent) and I don't intend to drop 100 gold to test a talent I recommend people don't take in the first place, so if you have evidence of a Drain Soul change I'd like to see it.
---
Except we know exactly what resilliance does. 
---
It reduced your chance to be crit by playets by a %, crit damage by a %, and damage from DoTs by a %
---
aw
---
It‚Äôs mating season?
---
Fast wins with strategy and co-operative gameplay IS fun for me. 40 minutes of nonsense because Horde decided to derail the game by making it unwinnable for both sides for 40 mins to an hour is NOT fun for me.
---
shazzrah?
---
You seem super unstable.
---
Been doing this as well but my alt is out of the level range where it is worthwhile to take people for the increased xp/hour.  
---
I usually have the low lvls wait in a certain spot next to the gate into the courtyard and they get all the cathedral xp unless a mob dies while I pull them from the side wings.
---
One thing anyone doing this needs to be aware off is, however, that a big part of the gold farm is in the drop gold. And if the low level characters are inside xp range, they are also getting a share of the gold drop.
---
Enjoy your attention!
---
Damn son. 
---
My Dude should change his name to
---
Massivedickbanditttt because he just fucked you raw lol
---
Okay and people are only a little behind. Wait till BWL is out and the difficulty is doubled.
---
My view on it as the mc isn‚Äôt particularly engaging so the most fun part about it is to come in fully buffed up and clear through in 40-60 mins. My favorite part has been trying to keep the breakneck pace, the only problem is that with everyone really trying it‚Äôs a little hard to show up on the meters as a lock.
---
Bigger number bigger honor.  
---
Time is concept of alliance weaklings.
---
Armorsmiths would like to know your location. Even with mining a good amount of my own ore armorsmith training cost me over 700g. The lionheart helm plan costs 2-3k on my server. That really the only money maker of you can even get it. My life is now just installing spurs and shield spike for 50s-1g.
---
Volatile is technically better especially going into bwl when you can start to hit a decent crit rate
---
The last sentence is an example? We do it sometimes to let green geared mages do top dps for shits and giggles. I'm talking about the enormous DPS claims, which is usually just burst in 30 second windows while cleaving adds with all buffs available and the mother of all RNG on your side. It's not real "DPS" you pull on Ragnaros as an example.
---
Mostly busting your balls because I‚Äôm jealous but the title did welcome my comment
---
This is my problem. I had everything but permafrost... ugh. no wonder the slow was expiring so quickly! Well that is one problem covered for sure lol. Thank you for that
---
&gt; Lucifron
---
germans and their fucking dkp
---
It was a good flame but this is all in good fun
---
I know what a squad is, I don't know what OP means by FC.
---
true, he has an extra minute of basically nothing
---
You have some grade-school level burns, yikes.
---
More like 40 minutes on horde side
---
Mpst certainly would.
---
I agree, there are r14's that play like total shit and unranked people who play very very good but just dont have time to rank. However, a r14 is more likely to be better at pvp than a r0. Always? No, obviously. But those that put in the time are generally and more likely to be better than you
---
You‚Äôre completely misdirecting your competitive will if you‚Äôre focusing on ‚Äúwinning‚Äù in the short-term and losing in the long-term. That you being bad at the game.
---
Blizzard doesn't like census mods that take realm pops and fac splits. They break the functions real quick
---
that's me ;)
---
I don't really get it, is there a benefit for being a lower rank? Or does being a higher rank stop you from doing something?
---
People always leveled.... people always pugged... it doesnt make those players any less behind.
---
Groups for instances and attunements are harder to find already.
---
Already gear checks make it hard to find guilds and raids. 
---
Wait till BWL comes out. You think theres gona be a spot in a raiding guild for someone who isnt full geared? BWL is gona be a guild breaker for a lot of smaller guilds that ARE geared.
---
Skills are a crutch, real players just right click
---
what a simple UI
---
I‚Äôd like to meet this man in discord!
---
And here we see the power of Soul Link...
---
let‚Äôs have this same conversation again just like we have in literally every thread on this subreddit
---
I think you just played shadowlands.
---
Glad your enjoying it.
---
How dare you
---
Or on Alliance players being pathetic quitters who can't even fathom the concept of Horde actually fighting back.
---
Either way, this leads to further unbalancing of the Horde/Alliance ratio in queues and therefore longer queue time.
---
Nobody can give a real readon as to why, its a parrot response to flying.
---
Hahahahahha
---
Who does elemental win against?
---
Well played
---
https://m.imgur.com/t/funny/Zki6LEk
---
For sure. On one hand I want a more disciplined hardcore guild, but on the other I appreciate the flexibility and lack of pressure. I can only make half the raids and no one gets mad if we someone does something dumb or has to drop due to rl stuff.
---
Minimal effort 24 hrs a day.
---
They cant really do a worse job than molten snore anyway.
---
Raid days are specific days. If you tell your SO "on these days of the week I'm busy", and they then start throwing a fit when you're actually busy on that day, that does make them a cunt. 
---
Replace the raid with any other activity and nobody would bat an eye, but suddenly when it's game-related, it's never respected.
---
&gt;alliance AND buttmad
---
Now *there's* a tautology if ever I've seen one.
---
thanks!!
---
It's climate change, leading to mass extinction of crocolisks.
---
The priest is more likely to face a ban for mcing people on the boat. Pretty sure people got temp band for griefing by doing this in vanilla.
---
Everything in moderation, right? Christmas holiday was my first break off WoW and I really enjoyed not thinking about it. Same boat as you- missed a few raids due to work. Don‚Äôt let the guild or other online people pressure you into playing. Keep the subscription going and login when you feel like it. BWL will be fun and is right around the corner!
---
They're all looted. You have to loot* them all for a quest item. They're just not despawning like normal. Its been that way for weeks. Its croc genocide.
---
When the game starts feeling like a chore rather than a game, stop playing. Nothing wrong with that
---
this is wrong. hand of justice, blessing of protection, and blessing of freedom are all great. paladins bring FC capability in lieu of druid. 
---
shamans and priests are needed to counter them.
---
No paladins are on the bottom lol
---
Oh-oh.
---
WoW world PvP is a complete joke only done because it was the only way to get honor. WPvP died and nlbody cares.
---
needs more shrek
---
Enchanting can make a lot of money, but it actually requires some time and effort to get to that point.  I took the time to figure out what the best enchants are for each gear slot for each class, and worked towards getting the majority of those enchants.  When you run into people that need multiple enchants, it's substantially more convenient for them to only have to go to one person, not multiple.  You can also use that as an opportunity to tell them that if they need more enchants in the future, they're free to just reach out to you directly.  I've gotten numerous repeat customers doing this.
---
Just having a few of the difficult to obtain or expensive enchants isn't even doing the bare minimum.  The bulk of the people looking for enchants are looking for bracers/gloves/boots, as gear pieces are replaced far more frequently (and for cheaper) than weapons.

Druid, you can join a group as any roll. All you need is a feral set, and an Intel set. If your dungeon grinding, this will be easy to get and maintain.

Bots farming
---
I see. OK, thanks for the info! I'll log out unstealthed from now on.
---
For those wondering, yes I can still use my ranking gear at rank 1
---
I think that's my character stats addon that added it, but I'm not sure.
---
This is my powershifting macro:
---
#showtooltip
---
/dismount
---
/cancelaura Predatory Strikes
---
/cancelaura Leader of the Pack
---
/cancelform
---
/cast [form:3] Cat Form
---
/cast [noform:3] Cat Form
---
Not sure why I have the dismount in there, as I only ever use this one for actual powershifting in combat, but hey...
---
IIRC, bots rely on visual detection for everything now. Its not so easy to visually spot prices of things.
---
Tell him about the context of the picture: a pleasure that you cannot enjoy anymore the same way.
---
I don't have an active sub so obviously I can't make a video. But you're the one making the claim in the thread you made. I'm simply saying you're wrong, because you are. I don't even play, so I don't care. It's just that you're spreading misinformation.
---
Also, I found the talent quite useful. I know you think otherwise, which is fine. But it gave me a lot of mana. Never really had to stop killing. I did eventually drop it and switch to drain tanking with Dark Pact and Drain Life spam. Which is also extremely effective and truly non-stop killing. But it was a little annoying how much you have to spam Dark Pact as it gives a pitiful amount of mana per cast.
---
Teleports would be an easy fix.
---
For me that would be like 40,000 gold. How much are you saying is enough for the whole game and how did you get that?
---
Thorium widgets - dark moon faire is coming and these will go up in price as people stockpile for their turn ins.
---
Can we ban this post?
---
I'm playing on Earthfury. It is a smaller realm and it's not always easy to get groups for leveling dungeons but there aren't a lot of Horde out there farming you either. I'm 34 and I've only been ganked once in a few hours of questing in STV. Though I have found a couple Horde to gank.
---
Servers are in flux now as paid transfers are now available to players on imbalanced servers for the first time. Earthfury likely isn't as balanced as it was before as I bet a lot of Horde are looking for PvP servers where they can find Alliance but it's been fine.
---
If you roll Alliance here PM me your bank alt's name and I'll hook you up with a gold piece to buy some bags. I can't stand not having bags. I can invite you to this leveling guild I am in too.
---
Earthfury is an Eastern time server. All the Eastern servers are in Chicago so you should have good ping.
---
From the horde side, it's far better to get a 25-30 min turtle win with max honor than to lose in 6-10 mins.
---
Most quick loses give us around 2k, while solid wins give us around 4500 (minus added honor from kills). With the 25-30 minute queues, 2k with 10 minute games and 30 minute queues would give you around 30k honor for 10 hours. 4500 with 30 minute games would give you around 45k, so you will literally get 50% more bonus honor per hour turtling and winning in 25 mins over allowing alliance to roll the horde.
---
Which is why its important to equip your fire resist gear for that part of MC.
---
A skinner‚Äôs dream.
---
I'll try to find someone who has the talent to verify. Thanks for letting me know.
---
I meant for future content at least, debuff cap is a shitty mechanic that was never intended by Blizz. But obv the game is balanced around it on this version.
---
The nice thing about taunting off is that your melee dps can stay in.
---
&gt; because one of your warlocks is hitting like a wet noodle and doing the same DPS an SM/Ruin lock in greens would be doing.
---
6% lower bonus to shadow damage / drains from the 3 talent points, to be more precise.
---
Prolly football club, like a European soccer team
---
It's the meta after your tanks get proper gear from MC. Which doesn't seem like the case for this guy's raid, who is still struggling with trash.
---
Context matters.
---
&gt;Guys the Map addons I use are SexyMap
---
It's malfunctioning.
---
The most important buffslot.
---
The warrior is using [Treant's Bane](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18538/treants-bane#comments) which is a pretty insane weapon.
---
Crying as a warrior. Leveling a hunter now but still can‚Äôt touch mage numbers
---
This was hotfixed recently so they won't reset if you still have aggro on one.
---
Alliance premades kill the guys at Galv, rush down drek and ends the game in &lt; 10 min.
---
Ally non premades play with 25 people due to dodges and lose by default
---
The more horde turtle the less Alliance will queue meaning longer queue times for horde. Horde lose is both situations
---
You can't pull a single mob from a linked pack. They'll all aggro together and will keep chasing together. Aggro won't drop.
---
That has nothing to do with anything, other than your desperate attempt to ignore how you're horribly wrong about everything you post and can't address it without digging yourself deeper-and hey, you're a professed Blizzard customer so you defend and shill for pedophiles. :)
---
WHERE'S YOUR ACHIEVEMENTS IF YOU'RE SO MUCH BETTER THAN THEM?
---
You shouldn't need the extra armor from the shield in any form of PvE.
---
No. No no no.  You don‚Äôt play rogue. You certainly don‚Äôt raid as a rogue.
---
Shadowcraft is DOGSHIT.  Not even close to pre-BIS.  The idiots who use it base their badness off of a private server‚Äôs data. In classic you are far better with Devilsair, and +agility / hit greens.  
---
Don‚Äôt talk about shit you don‚Äôt know about, idiot
---
Take a break and focus on work and health until the workload eases up a bit. By that time, BWL or even ZG might be out.
---
alliance is the one that pves in av, all they know what to do is zerg. Most premades i have faced lately end the game in 8 minutes and have less bonus honor than the horde or they lose in 20 minutes because they get wiped before fulling capping the two southern gys
---
I am an afker
---
Fair, it is situational
---
Can I ask what y‚Äôall do for the flame guards?  Those pulls alone are like 1.5 hrs for us..and do y‚Äôall still get Ubrs buff before rag?
---
Thank you. Great advice
---
Just did rag on noggenfogger, the druid got 5 drops... and a lot of people ran out of pots and elixirs
---
&gt; Once I get exalted, I probably won't bother even playing until WSG rewards go live or perhaps a bonus honor weekend.
---
But then, Horde should slow down Alliance rep gain as much as possible so we can keep queues lower.
---
Consecration is all you need.
---
You can tank as if you're DPSing, just have Righteous Fury on and put down Cons.
---
This is fair, but you also have to understand that anyone that is wanting to rank (not necessarily rank 14) has to do AV as its the best honor available with the given q times.
---
&gt;That's some weird gate keeping...
---
Did I ever say I was one of those people who can clear mc that quickly? My guild also has the occasional wipes. But saying mc is a joke and classic wow pve is easy is absurd if the person saying it is actually struggling on mc content.
---
Weapon. Weapon first
---
Fuck em
---
Time to pick up engineering and alchemy!
---
Stop premading or enjoy the long games. This is a response to premades. No, we arent going to let you win. No, we dont care if you quit the game.
---
Ball is in your court.
---
battlegrounds are a joke, there's hundreds of arena games or mobas that offer a better battleground experience than WoW can ever dream of having.
---
world pvp is unique to mmos, you may not like it but that's the best thing they offer
---
You forget that blizzard is a small indy developer.
---
How?
---
I mean if you enjoy smashing it full on of course push for that.
---
I was just more stating that flasks in MC aren't needed. Really more optional.
---
Then I will simply go premade and you will get nothing and I will have less fun as a solution.
---
Is that better?
---
Onslaught/bre. You will change your 1h weapons in a month, bre is the best warrior weapon until naxx and onslaught will last you until tbc.
---
Keep everything on Azeroth, fill in the unused zones.
---
Keep level 60 but add TBC talent trees (with 10 more talent points available) with new 40 man raids so offspecs can be used.
---
No flying mount.
---
New dungeons and items, minor gear inflation for new dungeons/raids (tier 3.5, tier 4, tier 5, etc.).
---
almost everything is tauntable. There are also limited invulnerability potions.
---
BRE usually goes for offspec anyway?
---
And that guy used a Firewater in the back
---
Why? haha I thought it was funny, just running by for herbs and MASS croc bodies everywhere
---
But... then they have to invest resources into a new account, and rewriting the code that got them caught. This costs time and money, and therefore does more to stop them the more frequently it happens
---
This guy seems to know the answer!
---
I actually kind of agree with this. The problem is how pvp rankings worked in vanilla, its the same as classic. It's all about time investment. It's always favored botters and account sharers.
---
If you go to thunderbluff same thing was happening to wolves and lions yesterday
---
I don't understand why so many people are against flying mounts. You don't get it until 70 anyways.
---
1 min cooldown. Main a pally but made a lock alt and fear is insanely OP. It should either be any dmg removes it, targets cannot be repeat feared for X seconds, or fear should have a 30 second cooldown (minimum)
---
Same with Polymorph.
---
Doesn't matter it was caught before and blizzard let people off with a warning that next time it will be a ban.
---
Thumbs up
---
He's the black lotus guy
---
&gt;You will change your 1h weapons in a month
---
Imagine being so naive to think you'll actually be getting weapon drops every month lmao
---
Evidently not
---
Thank God arcanite went up. I remember in Vanilla it was just stuck at 5g forever, even after better transmutes came out. Sorry dude, I can do undeath to water twice in the time I lose making your arcanite. Almost four times the money.
---
It's a German Streamer on twitch..
---
he is a streamer+GL
---
It was the first time round before everyone figured out strategies and tactics. It can still be hard now if most of your raid doesn't have preraid BiS.
---
You have to remember that people who can play hours and hours every day are still in the minority when it comes to WoW. PvE content can definitely still be hard for casuals.
---
Easy tips:
---
separate flamewalker + Flamequards. 
---
Kill firewalker first, banish both Lava elementals. 
---
priest Target the flamewalker and mouseoverheal spam the Target they are Casting their fireball to.
---
When the flamewalker dies, Switch to the flameguard (tanked about 20yards from the Camp and Kill it).
---
After that, Split the Tanks for the lavaelementals and let 1 or 2 use a FAP while building aggro. The 3rd Tank should always stay their back to taunt if it stuns the tank
---
Is pickpocketing as a rogue in brd for example a legit gold making method? How much would it give me approxematly per hour? And will it stay like that during the rest of the game?
---
Unless they break early
---
Having a specific rep tied to the dungeon works well for that purpose too. ZG is great for that.
---
There's not many quick and easy wayq to get to that amount of gold. Most likely he's farming 8hr/day since launch.
---
There was a video made by someone who had 13k after 1 month of launch. He had like 21 days played in that time span, and spent essentially 12hr/day farming various spots.
---
you'll just need one game where the ally decide to defend to bridge to see the huge advantage they have.
---
Whats the point in Twinks if everyone is twinked? Then you can just 10v10 with everyone wearing white garbage.
---
You are so wrong it‚Äôs hilarious
---
DM:E Jump Runs, strat live orb reserve are the two reliable ones.
---
the rest are kind of server/market dependent.
---
Honestly though, a sizeable chunk of my cash influx just comes from lvl 35 alts with crafting and cooldowns. A lvl 60 gold farming alt is honestly not a terrible idea for the long long run.
---
the private server where they intentionally buffed everything to make classic raid meaningfull?
---
The problem with your math is that if horde loses in 8 minutes maximizing honor they have 2772 bonus honor not 2k.
---
August 22 patch 1.12  2006 added final nerfs  . October beta starts for TBC and ranking is removed from vanilla
---
Call PETA.
---
Level a mage.
---
You have 3 paths in, so if they go bridge you go backdoor.
---
Its that simple really, and the bridge isn't that OP in 1.12.1 as the archers are useless and dead at that point anyways.
---
What was that warrior? You died yet again? I'm sorry I couldn't hear you over the sounds of the 5 same lebel mobs I was successfully soloing.
---
*laughs in Paladin*
---
BRE is a pvp weapon. Don't bid on it as an orc with pve main goal. DW with DB is better for raids because bosses will drop with fairy fire/sunder armors/annihilator low on value armor-&gt;bre worseless. Its good for cleave fights tho
---
You probably have 0 sense of style irl I‚Äôm assuming?
---
you mean healing...which for whatever reason seems to be the biggest area lacking this time around.
---
Well I didn't use the word 'copying' did I.
---
What I said is quite different than what you imply I've said.
---
Well, I agree. But at least its more balanced I guess than without the cap.
---
At least we still get instant queues for both
---
Sell your tank services. Or tank tax (take certain items that drop that no one needs) or level a mage alt to spexifically farm gold with.
---

If you are pre raid bis you already can ho fury tanking.

Context does matter, and the context is the guilds that apply the strategy.
---
Your original post implied AV was released in 1.12, it was released in 1.05, which was June 7th, 2005.
---
Did you actually read anything of the post?
---
So it's just for arcane shot? What makes it not affect, say, serpent sting?
---
I am 800 rep of exalted, and after that I will never queue again.
---
You guys could try pushing for fast honor like we do with lt kills and  tower caps? \*shrug\*
---
it's not lol.  tbf, the "lawnmower" strategy, as it's been coined in the premade discs, is only \~2 days old.  give it time.  the murderball will meet you in FoS soon enough.
---
Exactly, I don‚Äôt understand why you guys complain about it
---
Cool.
---
exactly, i expected warrior to be the bottom
---
def buy the mount. also, skeletal horse mount is god tier along with wolf and tiger, and i won't hear any different.  
---
(ram/kodo/raptor are next tier, horse is meh tier and mecha-chicken is shite tier - don't @ me)
---
Live strat, reserve ALL orbs, split with your healer.
---
The alliance that will stop queueing AV won't start queueing WSG.
---
Deathbringer/ BRE is what you should save all your dkp for then.
---
If your Spriests are top 5 in your MC fights, your warriors/rogues/mages are trash.
---
A skinner‚Äôs nightmare.
---
Premades are worse for you than they are for alliance.
---
My warrior alt got boosted for a couple of levels. Each run was so short the shear mass amount of kills offset the reduced xp. And that was with a L60 Rogue boosting. A class not very fit for AoE. He almost died a couple of times!
---
Bots everywhere! What will be the next, bots inside AV?  Oh wait
---
2 days ago and 3 days after AV launched are slightly different time points.
---
People say this all the time but as a mage shaman is one of the easier match ups. Give me a shaman over a druid or priest any day of the week. Grounding totem does next to nothing because it absorbs 1 rank 1 frostbolt or fire blast and has a decent cd. Earth shock only locks you out of 1 school, we have 3, and it only locks if you get the interrupt. Purge is the most annoying but it's not the end of the world if you take advantage of trash buffs.   
---
The only control shaman has is frost shock(without trinkets) which they can't do if they're trying to earth shock you. The shaman can't break cc at all(without trinkets) so they're extremely easy to lock down. Any decent mage is able to completely control the shaman until they die. Enchance will never touch a decent mage. Ele can get some kills on the mage if they get lucky crits at the wrong time.   
---
If we're just listing things the class has that's good against the other one. Mage has ice barrier, ice block, cs, imp cs, mage armour or ice armour, frostbolt, coc, frostbite, magic absorb, mana shield, sheep, frost nova and cold snap for another ice barrier, ice block, coc, frost nova.  
---
All of this is from a dueling perspective mind you. The results speak for themselves shamans were allowed to place 4 totems and fully mana up before the duel started and still came in last. If you're talking something like WSG though then it changes quite a bit and shaman gets very strong with some support.
---
Horde isnt sufferring anything doesnt care. We will take from you everything and give back nothing. We dont care how you feel or what is most efficient for you. We play because we like to play and we play to win.
---
Nice! I had this moment in runescape many years back, it was amazing! Glad to see people are still making friends like that, it's such a simple but cool little thing
---
It seems to happen on zone boundaries. Some kind of bug with the way zones are separate but work together now instead of being unified.
---
Put in a 1-60 treatment for DK, Monk, and DH.  Guild banks.  Shared taps.  Personal loot. Remove debuff cap.
---
I honestly don‚Äôt care my win rate against premades is 80%.
---
Horde changes they‚Äôre gamestyle 3 days after AV launch, why don‚Äôt you guys adapt too?
---
I NEVER seen more then 3 alliance on defence, ever.
---
Damn, how long did it took? Did you just spammed lfg channel?
---
Do we really need a post every five minutes on the same thing everyone knew was going to happen with the old pvp system, its a crap outdated system that is pretty much wide open to abuse and blizzard seems to content to let it fail.
---
8 min pure drek rushes were 1st few days of AV for PvE rep farmers who wanted rings, cheap mount, etc.  i stand by that.  premades mowing the lawn and actively seeking out the horde in FoS started 2 days ago.  i stand by that as well.  
---
i'm not sure where you're seeing an inconsistency, am i missing something?
---
Whyyy?Hes using ability he has; not cheating or abusing anything
---
Risky post OP but i support you!
---
He's arguing from the perspective of a solo player who doesn't understand why his support class isn't doing well on its own.
---
I WRITE THE DPS SPREADSHEETS and did the testing that proves Shadowcraft is DOGSHIT. In a duengon / raid setting with proper play, SF setprocs about 5 times an hour.  Not worth the loss of hit, Craig and AP. NOT BY A FUCKING COUNTRY MILE.
---
So shut up, idiot
---
bots aren't real, blizzard bot detection is so advanced they ban bot makers before they can even start writing scripts
---
Yea brd is not that good for raids. I look at raids as a way to gear up for pvp so bre is my 1# pick. If you don't care about pvp go for onslaught.
---
wait how come enlighten me pls
---
Flying mounts effectively killed the element of danger when traveling the world.  Scary mobs on the way to your destination? Fly over them.  Enemy players blockading an important landmark?  Fly over them.  Get ganked and worried they gonna get you when you respawn?  Fly over them.  The world feels a lot smaller with flying.
---
think atlas has it at 25% but i havent seen one on 5 weeks
---
I use AdiBags for the sorting and [BankItems](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info25399-BankItemsClassic.html) to show what's in bank/alts/mail.
---
This.But seems dumb alliance wants Horde to roll over and die instead win 80% of games.Also they call a turtle when 10-15 defends
---
Yep... people wanted the original honor system for some insane reason, this is it. Complete with everything about it that made it terrible and need to be replaced.
---
As much as I hated what arenas did to PvP at least you had to be good at the game to rank up.
---
You don't get to tell other people how they enjoy a game they $15 a month for
---
You have heard of private servers right?
---
We haven't stopped playing classic since 06 dude.
---
I particularly disliked Blade's Edge Mountain and Zangarmarsh.  One was very light brown, the other was very teal.
---
You can AoE far and make thousands a lot of people are making up their money numbers. If you were smart and made money early though you could easily be 25,000+
---
The knockback can hit everyone thats in rage of Rag.  If your MT gets knocked back, Rag will start attacking any other melee in range.  If you are using Greater Fire pots and/or you have high enough Fire Ressistance, you can stay in.  Usually, its not worth the risk though.
---
Here's the story behind EJ: https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/5g94nn/an-oral-history-of-azeroths-most-influential-guild
---
yeah we're on like 20 minutes every queue
---
Pugs have lost every single competent player ever, because they're all in premades. Pugs are 80% gnome now. 
---
Premades are getting leaner and more efficient, as pugs drop off you'll be having longer queues and less winrate against premade.
---
I outdps sword rogues in other pre bis setup using 6pc shadowcraft + 2pc devilsaur as a dagger rogue lmao... it's good. Nothing you said made any sense.
---
You're one of those elitist idiots from the rogue discord aren't you?
---
I hate it when I lose a Craig when changing gear. Back in your hole, troll.
---
I meant to say visually, but you're definitely right.  Although it still means you have to be checking your target frame rather than your opponent.
---
just had the event. Yes, it was lootable by every member in the raid group (except the ones who did no damage on the mob, like my level 2 dwarf or the healer who kept me alive).
---
The Burning Crusade without flying mounts.
---
I'm not mad like op but I'm really fucking happy Horde has queues. Makes me feel good after p2.
---
Makes me feel even better to know that every retail baby picked Horde because of 'better racials' yet are going to lose almost every single WSG premade because Paladins.
---
Sorry I'm just really salty from p2
---
I don't think you can search through the bags of your alts. You'd need to mouse over a particular item and it would display how many you posses and where they are.
---
Play better
---
Naw fuck that, I'm on horde and I hate AV, only doing it for Rank 7 and them I'm out
---
You rebel scum
---
Make them into frost resist pots, goes from 14/25 silver each to about 5-7 gold each
---
The earths, invest 2 gold for the elemental and the dream foil, sell the pots duringAQ for 5-7 gold each
---
i don't think anything in this game is skill based. but playing against another human has no elements of restricted pathing/abilities/patterns. completely free thinking and adaptable
---
Everyone just says join a premade server....how?
---
Tribute &gt; anything a mage can farm by a mile but I guess we will see how mages do in ZG
---
Idk I saw alliance try to do this this morning.. turtled at Bal/shgy and we just went around, capped all their bunkers and won and they didn't even get one tower or galv. Was a really sad showing. Come to think of it, I haven't been in a losing game of AV in days, I think horde are finally trying to win with how long the queues are.
---
Is SL banned in this tourney? I know it is in others.
---
A fellow death bridge guild
---
God i miss that meme..is it 3 years already?
---
What? Pre raid BiS never mattered.
---
The [distribution of classes](https://cdl.gg/tournament/season-1-regular/) is the same for all of them and some classes have advantages/disadvantages built into the [rules to help or hinder them](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tk7q7_BesgvqnEk6gzowMa-elJQxi8WiaELjkeJ4y4o/edit). Warriors for example are allowed the opening move so they can get a lot of damage or cc or whatever they want to do as the first action in the duel. Shamans are allowed to place 4 totems before the duel starts so they don't have to do it mid duel. You should probably learn about what you're talking about before you talk about it.
---
Explain to me, genius, how to detect the difference between a human pressing "Space" about every 10 minutes, to a script pressing "Space" every 9 - 10 minutes?
---
What, are you going to do a spectral analysis on the plot?
---
Cuz he's deliberately harassing another player by using the ability in such a way.
---
I've simmed Dal'Rends vs. Deathbringer and DB offers about a 5 dps increase. It's not worth spending 600g on Edgemasters.
---
how do you kill that which has no life?
---
Playing 24/7, rank 12 is still only halfway to 14
---
You obviously aren't watching the CDL nor do you know how it's structured.
---
It has the same number of each class represented. Everyone plays the same number of matches, and plays against everyone. After each round the lowest performers in each class are eliminated.
---
Essentially everyone is competing against their own class to get more wins than the others in their class.
---
Lol, gl
---
This is the best answer so far
---
My recollection was I'd fly up high, point myself in the direction of where I wanted to go, autofly, tab out and do something else. Tab back in a few minutes later and see how close I was.  TBC and WOTL, while good expansions, and still fun, never had that living world feel that classic had.  With flying, the obstacles between me and my destination might as well not exist.
---
Yes, lesson definitely learned :D
---
Fishing. Going to be 20-30g/hour fishing winter squid in azshara between 12-6pm. Not a huge rate but safe and easy
---
Eh, I don't know why you have to write this. Why comment if you aren't curing cancer?
---
&gt;Every Paladin is a kick ass retardin, who can just use Bubble, Auto Attack and SoC. Every Druid is a Feral. Every Priest a shadow, every warrior a DW Leather wearer and so on. 
---
Which is every single Horde group. I got healed the other day in AV and had no idea what was happening.
---
 See my other comment. You're completely wrong because every class is represented equally.
---

Premades are boring and annoying. We'd all prefer to queue solo or with people from our own server.
---
That was the point of this post, we are doing that, but it's shit for everyone.
---
I don't wait in a 30 minute queue to cheese a 6 minute game, I would rather play
---
Indeed, I will never go in there again.

Everyone is entitled to their opinion. If you don‚Äôt like something, for whatever reason it is, that‚Äôs perfectly fine. Just understand that shows like this are called an **adaption** for a reason. They are adapting the story and characters from a series of books to a TV show. They aren‚Äôt copying it word for word, character for character, story for story. They‚Äôre changing things to fit a new medium how they see fit. Sometimes for better, sometimes for worse.
---
Pretty much the only movie or show I can think of that actually just copied everything almost exactly was Holes.
---
he farm black lotus etc on a dead server since launch then paid transfer and sold it all, ez
---
You are missing the point. If a server has 100 druids and 1000 warriors it is more likely that the 2 best warriors out of those are more skilled than the 2 best druids.
---
You know he‚Äôs not actually wearing the set you see, and is using an add on, right?  R13 is mathematically impossible at this point.
---
I just hit the honored area and still have a loooong way to go. However, if it's still a lose every game when I hit exalted, I probably won't play it much anymore
---
And what are the rules? Do Mages get Cold Snap every single duel? Because that tilts everything in favor of Mages over Shaman.
---
These players are in a different level duel wise, go watch the vods of cdew dueling, it's crazy.
---
How about just doing it in the first place and being grateful anyone reminded them at all? 
---
People need others to remember for them and must be respectful while doing so to ensure reciprocity? 
---
Ppl are awful
---
Same way you buy drugs. You know a guy
---
Your skepticism seems to be based on your lack of understanding of the system.
---
Getting to R14 is solely based on playing more than everyone else, so someone that is currently playing more than 99.9% of the player base is going to hit R14. Unless that person changes how much they are playing, then yes they know they are going to hit R14.
---
I would love them to add in "classicified" classes that are locked behind end-game content. For example, I would really be interested in a classic version of the monk, since it would give unarmed skill a use and the heavy focus on auto attacks would really look great thematically for monks.
---
I‚Äôm confused how you‚Äôre correlating total population to you losing in a population controlled battleground. It‚Äôs 40v40 in AV. Faction imbalance has no factor, other than Alliance having instant queues allowing them to have premades.
---
Won*

Alliance on Skeram.  Despite being severely outnumbered the alliance coalition here is quite strong.  All of the bad players and casuals have transferred off but the good players and private server veterans stayed.  Skeram ally has two of the top 10 guilds in NA and 12/20 fastest clearing MC guilds here are ally.
---
This is just wrong. Enchanting can bring you lots of money. You gotta invest gold and time tho. 
---
But agree, tips got lower and lower,maybe because more people are getting the rare stuff.
---
But all in all i get minimum 2g tip for any enchant,i charge 5g for crusader and 15g for 30sp.
---
Anyway,altogether i think i made about 2k gold per tips by now (also invested about 1k for some formulas)
---
Some MMOs offer great WPvP but WoW isn't one of them.
---
got a prot warrior to boost for an hour in SM, got around 25k/hour exp, and thats around what grinding in the world would give, so a better booster is worth it, and you can relax while he run you through.
---
The re-enactment photo VERY closely resembles the original. Look at the foot placement, the angles, everyting - well done!
---
Of laughter maybe.
---
&gt;Stop judging others for wanting to rank. 
---
Why?  Honor farmers have ruined so much of this game for essentially no reason.  If you are one, kindly go fuck yourself off the tallest nearby building.
---
The best AFK farm would still be AV, so it would be exactly the same... unless you mean "I personally would be in WSG so I don't care"?
---
The current set of rules has to be the most arbitrary rule set I have ever seen. 
---
Hunters not being allowed to put traps down before duels is my favorite rule. It's just so Incredibly stupid. It's like saying locks can't have their pet out when the duel starts.
---
Mythic plus dungeons.  This is my favorite thing from Retail.
---
Damn I paid a fellow enchanter 25g just for the +4 to stats that shit is rare!!!
---
Yes but paladins shouldn't be able to roll on it because of the armor bit. Fucking give them hard prio on asscandy or whaetever you have to do to not let them take this one.
---
Negative resistances are the same as 0
---
It is legitimate, and how much gold you make depends on how efficient you get with it, but you can make 20-60g an hour.
---
until now it wasn't, but from the january championship phase it will be
---
I mean if the game is 12 mins it's already a turtle :\^)
---
I know it depends on realm and how other do but If I'm rank 6 and I don't do much pvp in a week (for example only get 20k honor) will I drop rank or standing at least ?

This is what we started with and it's worked thus far. We clear MC and Ony every week in 3-4 hours since we only started at start of December.
---
I linked the rules if you want to read them. No they do not get cold snap every duel you are allowed 60 seconds between duels to rebuff/mana up. You can have a little more if you need it but unnecessary time wasting is not allowed. There is no way the judges would let a mage sit there for 10 minutes waiting for their next cold snap. Again please learn about what you're talking about before you talk about it I even linked the information you need.
---
I was referring to overall pvp effectiveness, power, abilities, etc... not the population.  oh well this post was removed by mods anyway
---
Jesus dude don't tell people to disenchant "of wrath" pieces. That's how you get lynched by warlocks/mages.
---
And the problem with that is that horde arent in a premadr fiscord. Getting anybody to help kill lieutenants is rare after balinda is dead. Easier to just play D and get honor from kills.
---
I mean, theoretically since you're filling both the tank and healer slot, you could fill the rest of the slots with dps? Probably need at least one off healer but... Mayyybe?
---
Were they actually queuing just WSG, or abusing the queue bug?
---
none of them really do, classic wow's is very okay when you have the proper server population, not these overpopulated classic megaservers.
---
Also paladins are easy to kill for warlocks compared to shamans (especially a good elemental shaman). Paladins are quite vulnerable to being feared , so you can take them out of the fight easily.  If paladins actually used shadow resistance aura it might make a difference but they never use it. A shaman on the other hand will always have tremor totems and grounding totems. I would say that neither of them are hard to kill solo but shaman's provide more annoyance in group situations.

[Here](https://cdl.gg/tournament/season-1-qualifiers/) is the result of the qualifiers. 64 competitors. 8 of every class. The top 4 of each class advanced to regular season. From that, the top 2 of each class advanced to the finals, which will be held in a few weeks.
