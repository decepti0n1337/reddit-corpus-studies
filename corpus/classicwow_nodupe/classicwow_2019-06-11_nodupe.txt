You can’t argue in good faith than any content in classic is harder than Mythic raiding and high M+ keys in retail
---
---
---
You can tank 5 mans with a 30/21 build, with which you can still very much heal raids too.
---
Yeah, you’re right, your feelycraft and membercraft trumps actual logs/meters.
---
This is true. I was talking solely about the open world leveling experience. I should have clarified that. Of course mythic is harder than classic.
---
Ah, I see you’re a man of culture as well. Zug zug
---
Ah, of course, it's not the feral's fault that he objectively takes more damage because of not being able to block and having no +defense to reduce the chance of crits, it's just "bad healers" and "bad gear", obviously.
---

---
:\^)
---
"The crossroads is under attack"
---
Because they're not the highest dps. Mages/warrior will consistently beat them across all content. How can you call a class that always comes 2nd and 3rd the best or highest?
---
&gt; I've been trying to watch some Classic footage on twitch lately, and it's practically impossible to actually talk in any chat.
---
Thats not how you use a twitch chat. Especially a large twitch chat. 
---
Its not about trying to have a conversation with people. Its being part of an organic hive, the chat as a whole, thats reacting to whatever the streamer does via emotes that convey an emotion. Streamer gets ganked? Everyone spamming PepeHands. Streamer gets good loot? Pog. Trying to debate which stat is more important on an upgrade just won't happen however. Theres simply too much for the streamer to read and keep up with. By the time they've said a single word in response theres been 10+ more things to reply to. Sure at times they might pick out something and reply to it, but generally speaking thats rare considering how much is said.
---
you’re taking out your ass mate. Rogues were always top until naxx/AQand even then they still matched warriors and mages. Post these ‘Logs’
---
Thanks, appreciate it.
---
&gt; I read they can summon max level as early as 20
---
 
---
Warlocks can summon level 60 characters at 45 - 20 is when they learn the spell ritual of summoning. 
---
Unless anyone has explicit evidence otherwise (would love to see!) this is accurate behavior.
---
If you understood how feral tanking worked you’d know the massive health pool, insane armor scaling, and the multiple times threat per second they do outweighs what you’re talking about in almost all scenarios.
---
Jip. This.
---
Slavery and racism is nothing for me.
---
For The Horde!!!
---
That’s always how I’ve taken them. The only rule they enforced was RP names. Had to change my name a few times on Emerald Dream until “Lidas” was never reported
---
I don't know, sorry!
---
Because they weren’t ever #1 in classic lol
---
Alliance has better pve racials, horde has pvp racials
---
 I'm legitimately a little worried. BFA is bad enough that I finally kicked WoW. My life is already improving in a number of ways.
---
But August, she looms.
---
im not sure, but raiding will be better on alliance?
---
Fuck. Thats so true lol
---
Please do something for your gold to be 34 34 34.
---
Rogues weren’t ever better than warriors and were obliterated by mages in naxx lol
---
Is there a message or something if you try to use the mount?
---
Find me a piece from MC or BWL that has more stamina, intellect, and armor (must have more of all 3 stats) than the PvP sets. I'll wait.
---
The only PvE pieces that even come close are the pieces from the Genesis set (T2.5) from AQ40. That set is very good, but I don't count those because that set is not very good in PvE and therefore not realistic to obtain. In order to get those pieces, you have to 1) be in a PvE guild and 2) take the tokens away from Rogues and Hunters, who actually use their T2.5 set in PvE. It's not realistic that any Druid will get those pieces while AQ40 is current content.
---
They are never ret paladin Tier but they go from high mid to the bottom of pure dps classes
---
Every MMO I play I always have an "Important" tab thats only whispers, guild chat, party/group chat and raid chat.
---
Meanwhile my casual ass is like ya.... I quite before the first expansion and my highest character was like 50 lol
---
I was never in a guild with more than a half dozen active players on at a time, if that. Never ran any higher dungeons than like SM. Lol raiding. 
---
Can't wait for classic! Never had time to really commit as a kid.
---
Don't look too much into it and just pick whichever race you like to play.
---
Humans have sword and mace specialization but it doesn't matter because their rogues will be behind the boss spamming backstab with daggers.
---
When TBC rolled around and mace stun effect procced a lot every warrior and rogue was running around with a mace and a mace spec. Guess what happened? Blizzard nerfed it completely.
---
Seriously if it ever comes to being too popular Blizzard will fix it quickly as they have many times in the past already, they don't like certain classes/specs in combination with a race having too much advantage.
---
How to make revenue from pausing a video and saying 'Yeah. Absolutely.'
---
There used to be an enforced policy about what you could say. https://wow.gamepedia.com/Role_Playing_policy
---
It was too expensive for Blizzard to deal with all the reports, so they removed the rules.
---
I think a lot of WoW Classic fans think RP realms are somehow the safe spaces of old. They are not.
---
&gt;Find me a piece from MC or BWL that has more stamina, intellect, and armor (must have more of all 3 stats) than the PvP sets. I'll wait
---
I won't even bother just look at the PvP gloves dude. They don't even have int. Literally 0 int and 15 Stam.
---
druid using regrowth
---
Sweet yeah it’s definitely been a few years, I appreciate all your help I’ll be working in this tomorrow and I’ll let you know how it goes
---
It depend of your connexion but for me there is a little bit of l'AG, ~0.5 sec
---
It's really playable but not for pvp
---
It’s doable. Start holy fight with stun after his first attack and start a holy light every time you reach 50% hp.
---
Oh, it makes sense now. 
---
Basically a copypasta (even the order of items is the same) of 2017 spreadsheet based on a private server with progressive itemization which does not exist in classic.
---
Druid is loads of fun. You don't compete for gear. It's good to farm, harvest and make gold. You can make stealth runs with a rogue. You have options if you change talents. While leveling you can tank. Running the flag in BGs. 
---
Priest is the ultimate healer. Expect to share loots with a couple priest. I would only put a priest as my raid heal leader. Responsibility, lot's of buttons to press. You can really turn pvp around with dispel or shield.
---
Sure, hunters don't scale as well as other pure dps classes, but people forget that they have the best threat management spell in the game, Feign Death. On a 30sec cooldown, hunters can virtually avoid the threat table, forever. If hunters scaled like warriors for example AND could feign death, they'd be the most overpowered class in WoW history in a PvE raid environment. How they scale from tier 1 to tier 3 is something Blizzard got right all things considered.
---
Every streamer is against sharding as far as I know.  At least all the ones I have watched.
---
&gt; get revenge on them for calling you a huntard.
---
&gt;pull a ton of shit. Then Feign Death, and hearth out. Instant justice.
---
Jesus christ man
---
I should test to see if it still functions this way
---
By the time hunters are “bad” 95% of the playerbase will have quite.
---
I don't know :/
---
Not true at all, rogues are still in the mix throughout the entirety of vanilla and you realise naxx wont be released until the latter portion of classic? When its released rogues will 100% be top dog for the first 3 phases. Where are these ‘logs’ you mentioned?
---
Slightly slower than hunters? Does that count as a downside?
---
Look, no one can objectively say whether it was better or not. Each of us can however give their opinion on what felt more entertaining to play once you hit max level. Open world, no guidance? Or 13 NPC's with blue question marks in a quest hub on the island of Tol Barad? What feels more like the World of Warcraft to you?
---
Forgive my assumption that end-game pve is the goal of playing wow. Clearly, some people are just hunting critters and collecting sticks while others rush their fast flying mount and monopolize a gathering profession. But daily quests gave easy access to computer-generated (not auction-house like the things you listed as alternatives) gold. This eventually trivialized gold sinks, such as repairs and reagents. It also drove up auction house prices, giving pricks like yourself an inflated sense of importance, that Lichbloom sure sold well, didn't it?
---
Then again, maybe "classic cult" is a lazy argument.
---
Our guild had a ret paladin in MC. I said this in a streamer's chat once, and had one of those min-maxers come at me with "THEN YOUR GUILD WAS BAD. Stop spreading misinformation!"  
---
I just kept saying "All I said was what the reality of our guild was. Nothing more, nothing less." But he kept getting angry with me. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Some people are just control-freaks. It's one thing to know what's optimal, and it's another to force your narrow-minded opinion of what's possible onto everyone you can.

Goodbye adulting ✌
---
Do you not use "ROFL" or "lol"? Its the same shit.
---
I too started in TBC, but mostly because I didn't own a computer prior to that.  
---
So much fond memory of leveling my first character, BEld Paladin. I remember getting into a 15min PvP with a Alliance Pally, but since we both using Blessing of Wisdom and  Seal of Wisdom, we had near unlimited mana for heals, and fought to a standstill. Eventually saluting and went out ways questing.
---
Yes Alliance is a bit better. Paladins are better than any racial.
---
Exactly. Also another benefit of multiple late night guilds on the same server is that they can combine raids to get enough to start doing MC quickly. It just makes a lot of sense.
---
I would eventually like to see Kara as a 20 man raid, along with a few others. I mean ssc as a 40 man for gear that has say 1 more agility than t3 would be cool but the gear improvements shouldn’t be why we raid. Maybe a questline takes the raid through ssc bt etc? Maybe release cosmetics or very slightly upgraded gear? I think one spot where wow screwed up is when they increased level cap making old content obsolete. They should have just made a long ass attunement quest requiring full completion of all content before it or something.
---
Nothing in BWL has stamina, intellect, and bonus armor. AQ40 tier sets do, but the AQ40 tier set happens to be mediocre in PvE, while the tokens are shared with Hunters, Rogues, and Paladins. You will not get those as a Druid while AQ40 is current content unless if your guild cares about progression.
---
People were mad about Tips' WC though. I'm not saying none of these people are sexist, but being angry at a woman isnt sexist.
---
Yeah but we're talking about lvl 5 not lvl 10
---
That's what I thought, until I went to their post history just now...
---
You can find them with relatively low google-fu. I believe in you.
---
&gt;rogues are still in the mix

**[NA][H][PVP][Casually Hardcore]**

**Timezone:**EST.

**Raid Times:**Tuesday 8pm-11:59pm until phase 5 or when a second raid day is needed (vanilla is easy) Wednesday 8pm-11:59pm
---
**Server Location:**Chicago
---
**Loot Method:**We will use a static 3 person loot council with an additional 2 rotating raiders weekly for transparency and so people feel they have a voice.

**About &lt;Unlucky&gt;:**We aim to enjoy vanilla wow in a casual hardcore way, a chunk of our core comes from pservers and dislike the sweaty egotistical scene. Vanilla is a 15 year old easy game and we feel that if you want to play a meme spec then you should be able to. We expect our raiders to show up consumed/enchanted/geared and push their buttons in the right order but won't be enforcing or kicking people out of the guild for making mistakes.

I don't know the exact number but it depend of the quality you want. If you played in 1080p I think it use the same data that it used for Youtube for example
---
Well.. From what I've understood (I never really raided in vanilla but I was in a raiding guild).. Yes. Easier access to most raids, but really? That's quite a small thing I'd say. Paladin buffs are great. Fear Ward from dwarf priests is good. The reality is that there will be hardcore raiding on both factions, in both factions they will make insanely fast progress. There might be something to min-max but again, there will be great guilds on both factions. This is not something I personally would min-max on. If you do want to, then yeah, go for it.
---
Yes
---
Also Barrens Chat. Among the most sophisticated game chat rooms in history. 👍
---
Man look at the PvP gloves. They don't even have int on them and they have a massive grand total of 15 Stam. I'm not saying don't use any of the set. I'm saying use three pieces. The best three. 
---
My whole point is the set as a whole isn't good. The two piece and three piece are practically necessary unless you're doing some terrible "ima kill you with shred while flag running" spec
---
I see. I was hoping to no life to rank 13, but i may have to go holt for that i guess....
---
It'll be a download through Battle.net client.
---
Yeah the idea is that you get level 5 in about an hour and then you can farm mobs and do quests normally since you should be ahead of everyone that tried to kill mobs in the starting zone.
---
A single glance on the preview (didn't even need to open the whole thing) shows how clueless you are about Pre-raid bis itemization, progress, stats you require and other things.
---
So at a single glance you could tell I'm clueless on itemization, stats, and "other things"? I'll give you progress since I didn't remove all the post-release content.
---
I converted the list dhralla made into a spreadsheet for the sorting aspect. I didn't even hide that I'd used his list.
---
I mean I’ve got 100 screen shots of myself playing a rogue, and topping dps on every boss and trash pull throughout MC and BWL.
---
Yes, and being 2nd or 3rd means you aren’t first lol. You said they were first, were corrected, and since then you’ve backtracked to “well.... they’re 1st!.... or 2nd.... or 3rd!”
---
Just stop.
---
Are you upset at rogues beating your dps?
---
Well, you can easily fail this even in a group of 50+ lvl characters and having a lvl60 in your party on private servers... So, yeah.
---
Yeah, that’s what I thought.
---
Honestly, if you're friend doesn't want to play, you shouldn't force them.  
---
They'll end up feeling obligated to play, not because they want to, but because you're paying them.  
---
I'd recommend just to convince them to play for a month. If they don't like it, don't force them.
---
In an ideal situation, sure. In reality, filling the raid is better than being choosy.
---
What? You’re an idiot.
---
Depends on gear, they are very close to fury warriors
---
I love the Japanese watercolor feel to it. I'm sure lots of people would pay good money for a painting of this.
---
Blood Fury, Berserking, and Axe Specialization are both good PVE racials.
---
Aside from Expansive Mind and Sword/Mace Specialization, the Alliance don't get much that would ever make them better for PVE.
---
Go for alliance. The horde has no need for indecisives.
---
assmongler isn't

It's enough to influence a LARGE percentage.

Where's Mankirk's wife?
---
You don't but at least some optimization helps with faster clears.
---
Yeah killing Ragnaros the first few times will fill you with a sense of accomplishment but when you go in for the gazillionth time it's just best to get it over with and gear up the people who still need it.
---
An optimized raid with semi good gear can clear MC in about 2-3 hours. A shitty raid with hybrid and janky specs probably won't even do it in one evening.

I’m going horde. Have been for most of my time playing wow. And friends I know are going horde. I do enjoy the alliance areas for questing and main cities tho much more
---
Doing the tank swaps and having them doing enough threat to hold aggro and have enough DPS to finish the fight in time was hard. Average tanks would lead to easy wipes and slow guilds on progression.
---
Because it depends on a lot of factors including gear. I have seen many rogues on top of the meters but let's talk in definitives  some more
---
Paladins
---
He most certainly is! He’s either trolling or he’s as thick as a castle wall...
---
&gt;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/anecdotal
---
I was top dps in my guild in BC as a ret Paladin, but I’m not going to try to say ret was the best dps because I’m smart enough to know a world existed outside of my raid.
---
REEEEEEEEEE  PHONES ARE SCARY
---
I wondered if the classic difficulty would turn some people off, but there's lots of people that appreciate harder games like dark souls these days.  Feeling like you are actually playing with other people will probably also be a huge boost to people not used to playing older WoW.  Will be interesting to see how many people quit after a few months, but I think more will stick around than people think.
---
Explain why
---
Until you get aetish
---
dead bliz HES FUCKING RUNNING IN STORMWIND AGAIN!!!!!!!! PLEZ BAN!!!!!!!!!!
---
The emote isn't the point though. Its about what "PepeHands" or "JeBaited" conveys. "Just melee in melee out 4Head". "Got my first shoulders peepoHappy"
---
Is not a racial ability...
---
And if we're talking uber hardcore min/maxing for speedruns... Horde can get Paladin buffs too.
---
However, Alliance will never have Windfury Totem.
---
I speak for multiple raid comps as well. Not just a single group of 40. Maybe “back in your day” when people didn’t know what they were doing, rogues didn’t rip dps. But nowadays on “servers” they do actually top dps when you know how to play.
---
Where is mankirks wife
---
Everyone was pretty close and everyone was definitely viable. They still weren’t #1, though.
---
Me and my mate are planning to start our own guild, we're based in Aus and have experience up until Naxx, clearing AQ40, BWL and MC. I was planning to be GM, and he was going to be Raid Leader, weekend raiding isn't ideal based on wanting somewhat of a social life. We both work full time and plan to have the first week off to no life. 
---
We would consider joining the Guild if we were granted high positions within, we are both capable of leading raids, as well as complimenting and supporting the social development and managing relations within the guild. 
---
pm on here for my discord, and if whether we can arrange a chat or something about getting involved with the guild.
---
Cheers
---
my main was a priest in vanilla. You felt like a local celebrity walking through IF with your benediction blazing. Such a cool feeling.
---
[removed]
---
Or a mage or a warlock or a Shaman. Warriors are atrocious 1v1. If you get charge off your chances go up by quite a bit against certain classes, but it's still not looking good.
---
First
---
yeah thats something im worried about, a lot of my friends are in HS without jobs so the subscription might be an issue for them, i think ill ask if they want to play and if they mention that the money would be an issue offer.
---
They are lowest of the viable dps in AQ and naxx, but so what? None is critising warlocks and mages for being garbage earlygame, if you look at pserver logs and compare dps from pre BWL, Pre ZG, Pre AQ, Pre Naxx and finally naxx clear, the average dps of hunters will be the same as warlock and mages.
---
[Classic Winds already did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zh6iBkfvkY0)
---
This. Vanilla accounts where merged into battle.net accounts (went from user:pass to email:pass) and that's when the account name change could have happened.
---
&gt; Druids are better for single target heals like Mt heal.
---
No, not really.
---
I really wish they didn’t. All the points I just read on that now removed rule is how I naturally play the game, and I would love for a realm where that’s the standard. 
---
I’m a new player and I was ganked by level 8 paladins «defending» humanoids in Durotar and I wasn’t annoyed, I was *intrigued*. I find all of the RP to be so fuckin’ awesome. Hopefully it continues.
---
&gt; But they're called boomers because there was a boom in childbirth as a result of....
---
No shit. We're not talking about those boomers here though. 
---
&gt;  Why not just use the term millenials
---
Because its spelled "millennials". Because the whole "boomer vs zoomer" meme is meant to convey old wow players who left the game vs people who stayed and currently play retail or never played vanilla. Its not really about age. Its about cultural difference within classic wow.
---
meanwhile, I ran my regular infinite sign route in dalaran
---
Top kek to anyone who managed to read this entire catastrophe without ripping their eyes out.
---
The gloves have stealth detection, which is far more useful for a class that can stealth. You will never replace the PvP gloves as Druid.
---
Nope.
---
Warlock top rogues dps while having a shadow priest debuff. Warriors breaks the meter and are more resilient in melee range. Mages does more dmg and are in range. 
---
Rogues can't use all abilities like poison and DOTs on the boss because of the debuff limit. Same as warlock. It cuts down dps a lot. If your raid leader let you apply poison and not the shadow debuff for every warlock you might have big damage but the whole raid suffered.
---
It could be argued that rogue was the least high dps of the dps class.
---
Spillover rep occurs when you complete a quest at the appropriate level for one of the four allied factions which then provides full rep for that faction and an additional 25% spillover rep to the other three factions. So, if you complete a quest in Westfall that gives 100 Stormwind rep, you’ll also get 25 spillover rep each for Darnassus, Ironforge and Gnomeregan Exiles. And when I say appropriate level, I mean within 5 levels of the quest level, otherwise rep decays by 20% each level once you outlevel the quest by 6+ levels.
---
As far as my guide is concerned, I have completed the write-up through level 40 and I’m painstakingly testing it quest by quest in the Beta, currently at level 26. You can see all rep values and progress on my site. As it turns out, starting zones give almost no spillover rep, but many quests in zones after that do. Unfortunately, rep values are lower than what was found on private servers (by about half), so the ultimate goal of reaching Exalted by level 40 is not looking good.
---
Chat gets a little weird sometimes.
---
How do you get ganked at the crossroads, it's a non pvp area unless you stupidly flag yourself
---
never got an upgrade over benediction even though AQ. my guild got up to cthun and never could kill him (even post nerf) and the guild broke up. i'm sadly not exalted with AV (only honored..lol) but i am exalted with AB and WSG

The key is finding *good* warriors/rogues/mages. For top guilds there's no shortage of applicants, but gems are much rarer than you would think. They probably won't take meme specs, but good warlocks and hunters won't be overlooked. 40 spots is a lot to fill.
---
&gt; If enough of us use it (incorrectly most of the time) the kids won't think it's cool anymore and will find something new.

I mean, I'm 29 and use twitch chat memes and don't even really chat in twitch's chats. Not really about age my dude. Its a cultural difference between pop culture (the twitch chaters, zoomers) and counter culture (the people against streamers, boomers)
---
TBC was the best version of WoW IMO.  It wasn’t perfect, and it definitely introduced a few features I’m not a big fan of, but it was without a doubt a better game than vanilla to me.  And I absolutely love vanilla, so that’s saying a lot.
---
REALLY hoping they progress to TBC after vanilla.  If they could do it without flying mounts, dailies, and badge gear it’d be even better IMO.  But I’ll still take it with those features any day.
---
Your entire post is the slippery slope fallacy in a nutshell. Just because something was introduced doesn't mean it was problematic at the time of its inception. It also doesn't mean it's destined to be a problem down the line. Too much of anything is bad, which is what happened to these systems.
---
This man is in shock. Get him out of here.
---
The beta servers do go down for maintenance and updates.
---
Really? The stealth detection? Just swap them on and off when you're in stealth looking for a rogue. They aren't good enough to be using them while flag running that's for sure.
---
"So many things you just said are so wrong"
---
"I can only assume you've never played feral"
---
Elaborate.
---
people hate hunters cause not only do they wipe the party they will most likely survive it and they roll on everything. one of the reasons i took engineering was so i can rez people after a wipe.
---
That link says the quest requires level 44. Is the database wrong or is this a bug? Quest should have been unable to pick up at some point in the chain, right?
---
[WoW's official Twitter account](https://twitter.com/Warcraft/status/1058430660266749952?s=20) confirms what I and others have said.

Enforcement just wasn't feasible any longer. Blizzard's been doing everything they can to remove the need for GMs.

They started hiding official sub numbers a long time ago but that doesn't mean players can't make educated guesses based on every other metric still available. (m+ and raids data, realmspop data etc)

The overwhelming amount of conclusions all estimate that BfA is doing even worse than WoD.

Some insignificant troll rogue video of a (around) level 20 rogue doing duels in crossroads, while the song Manowar warriors of the world ran in the background. It brought me to wow (with troll rogue as first char) and introduced me to Heavy Metal. Can't find the video anymore since I don't even remember the title.

Horde has a quest that gives a +25 Fishing Rod.
---
So there's that.
---
Nah not really though because with a real community you are actively engaging with the same players not just queued up in the lfg system and joining randos, sure there will be the ninjas here and there still but not nearly what retail is constantly playing with different people
---
Genius
---
"Pogs" or milk caps was something that was popular during the mid 90s. Basically its become a meme to convey when something good happens. An example of its usage would be "Crit for 2k, Pog".
---
I like that. We already get so much shit, this ought a help👍
---
What about loot you don't really want for your main spec?  Say a feral tank druid getting t1?
---
"by far" they were the lowest dps of the pure dps class.
---
Mages, warlocks, warriors were better DPS. Only hunter are worst.
---
What does that change anyways? Are you going in a guild with 1/3 Warriors in the raid to speedrun it?
---
in vanilla the NPC didn't port you in, you had to walk through the window next to him. and it wasn't huge.
---
Thanks for catching that, updated the post as well.
---
They use a Priest's Mind Control. We do it once a month for speedruns (Darkmoon Faire buffs).
---
And Windfury is absolutely used in the melee group. It accounts for about a 5-10% DPS increase for each player.
---
Hardly any data on that site is correct, except stats of items.
---
you can't get it in live anymore but come classic it's considered the rite of passage for holy priests
---
That is something I didn't see coming but I put out an update literally a second ago that might fix this issue. 
---
[v3.5.5](https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/weaponswingtimer/files)

It seems like channeled spells dont have a cast time so it would bug out.

Yeah that one takes the cake

Not to be a huge noob but what is the purpose of this?

Never said that, but yes, it's very important for running flags. You enter the enemy flag room in stealth. If a Rogue finds you while you're in cat, then you die. On the other hand, if you find him, then you can open with Pounce, pick up the flag, and sprint out before the stun wears off.
---
I've been ranking in raids with it. As long as you have a warrior off tank to mocking blow to wipe your stacks, you're more or less golden. The real issue they suffer is the amount of expertise you need now. It's hard to gear block% spell power, int, strength, hakkari 1h and have expertise enough to not wreck yourself.
---
You can also go 31/20 and use your holy shock to heal yourself and help keep more aggro. There's a lot of really nifty tricks you can do.
---
BTW is your "rested" bonus still works after locking xp? (then you will have tons of bonus xp if you want to level up)
---
That "harrassment" policy seems pretty dubious to me. It blurs the line too much between legitimate harrassment and acceptable PvP, faction rivalry, or even enmity (holding a grudge against a particular character and going out of your way to inconvenience them seems like valid RP to me.)
---
The rest of it looks alright though. Honestly, the names and IRL conversation topics in world chat were the main reason I prefer RP servers, even though I'm not interested in "active" RP. I just wanted a more immersive world.
---
Everyone is in Stormwind because it's more local to level appropriate regions. Nobody is going to fly ten minutes past a major city every time they need to hit the AH.
---
You have clearly never played a Druid at max level. Rogues literally have one job in WSG: to defend the flag room from other Druids. Stealth detection is a must have for running flags.
---
Fury warrior and mage are both ahead of rogue, esp as the game progresses. Bwl is super early
---
There was a guy that refused to cap the WSG flag for 3 hours and when a GM contacted him, he said he was just RP'ing and hoping for peace between factions. They let him be.
---
&gt; It wouldn't be so dumb if the twitch lingo was mixed in with coherent sentences
---
Generally speaking, through experience in other games, thats how it turns out. "Omg he just ran in Pepehands"
---
&gt;4 layers of 3k players total. So 750 per layer.
---
Citation needed
---
I figured I’d just say that rather than “clear up to and kill the 2nd last boss”. Sorry if I confused you!
---
 - Both are strong levelers.    
---
 - Both are strong in solo play (with a feral gear set, or spell power are higher gear levels)     
---
 - Priest are the most diverse levelers in the game (HoTs, Shields, Big Heals, Small Heals, Group Heals)    
---
 - Druids are the kings of HoTs    
---
 - Both Resto Druids and Disc Priests will get e-Bjs for their respective in-combat buffs (Innervate/Power Infusion)    
---
 - Both depend heavily on downranking and strategic casting for mana efficiency (i.e. don't use Greater Heal when Heal is enough, don't use heal when renew is enough, etc).    
---
 - Priests are more favored in raids and but each raid needs minimum one Resto Druid for HotW    
---
 - Druids have a much lower population, making them rare commodities (historically)   
---
 - Druid PvP has a higher skill ceiling than Priest (due to shifting)    
---
 - Swiftmend is difficult to use well (get timer bars). Nature's Swiftneess is sexy af. And Tranquility works well (every 8 minutes!).    
---
 - You won't compete for gear on a Resto Druid. You might compete on a Priest (although Mages/Warlocks have different stat priorities).    
---
 - Both require pre-cast/cancel. Both require preemptive HoTs.
---
They said each layer would be about 2.5-3k, but hopefully they are smaller so you can actually quest.
---
That's MC. BWL is where things take a sharp turn. Even ZG isnt that friendly towards too many off specs. Everything beyond is where the wheels fall off
---

MC raiders. We ain't got no life.
---
You used to be able to drop it. and immediately stop midair.  I used this vs rag.   Though, I thought they fixed it.
---
In my experience Mage doesn’t touch close to rogue in dps, not counting AoE. I can however agree that eventually Warriors out dps rogues, since they scale better long term.
---
Shadowpriests have always been great in pvp during vanilla. And I can see where the current twink meta severely skews things in favor of casters right now.
---
Geared rogue beats ungeared warrior. Equally geared and equally skilled warrior and mage beat rogue
---
When feral gear drops and your the only Druid in the raid.
---
I hope this is a joke
---
Melee scale with gear better. It's just the way it works. And 40 is a hard time for melee.
---
https://i.imgur.com/DIAERQg.png
---
Bosses don’t parry from behind so it’s only really a tanking issue
---
TRUE LULW
---
Theres not a spec in this game that beats ignite mage. However rogue is probably 4th in pure dps as you move on. Warriors, mages and locks are all ahead of them, though locks need weaving
---
A taking issue becomes a threat issue, which becomes a dps issue.
---
There's no such thing as feral gear, only gear the rogues no longer need.
---
Hi, /u/krashoveride
---
 I'm guessing this should have been:
---
Guilds: Other - Horde - PvP  
---
Because there are 2 PvE comments.
---
* **Guild Name:** &lt;Goblin Rocket Fuel Rats&gt;
---
* **Realm:** Oceanic/PvP, horde side
---
* **Language:** English
---
* **Activity Type:** Helping out others (PvE/PvP/Social)
---
* **Members:** *recruiting now!*
---
* **Hardcore or Casual:** Anyone with a heart of gold (Hardcore or Casual).
---
* **Beginner Friendly:** Yes!
---
* **Discord:** [**https://discord.gg/2rG8RZm**](https://discord.gg/2rG8RZm)
---
* **How to join:** Either message me on Reddit, or join the Discord!
---
\----------------
---
**Prologue; the origins**
---
Inspired by the heroic actions of [**Fuel Rats**](https://elite-dangerous.fandom.com/wiki/Fuel_Rats) group in [**Elite: Dangerous**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite_Dangerous), &lt;Goblin Rocket Fuel Rats&gt; exists with the sole purpose of helping others in World of Warcraft: Classic.
---
&gt;Well, what is **Fuel Rats** and what is **Elite: Dangerous**?
---
Elite Dangerous is a space-flight simulation game in which the player explores a realistic 1:1 scale open-world representation of the Milky Way galaxy (yes, literally 1:1 scale). Since the Milky Way is mind-bogglingly huge, it is not unusual for space explorers to get carried away and end up stranded somewhere in the void with no fuel. When this happens to you, your only way of getting back is if someone manages to find and reach you to transfer fuel.
---
This is where Fuel Rats come in. These are a group of volunteers who literally go above and beyond to help out their fellow players. There is no in-game system for this, mind you. So each and every member of this selfless organisation help out others through their own means. Their longest rescue mission consisted of five Fuel Rats members finding Commander "Deluvian", a stranded pilot who is 65,788 lightyears from Sol. [**The combined journey took 600 (actual) hours.**](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/02/18/elite-dangerous-rescue-mission-commander-deluvian/)
---
It would be an understatement to say how devoted these players are just to help out someone else.
---
Our goal is to provide a similar helpful environment in WoW: Classic. With the help of some [**Goblin Rocket Fuel**](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=9061/goblin-rocket-fuel), anything is possible.
---
**Our guild ideology**
---
We have one goal; helping out any adventurers we come across. Some will come to us for help, but we should always be open to seeking out others who may be in need. Your level, equipment or the amount of wealth matters not. What matters is a healthy and friendly attitude. We do not have set roles for our members (PvE helper, PvP helper, crafter etc.) because we want you to be exemplary members of the Horde; no matter the activity. We only expect you to be kind to others, guild members and non-guildies alike.
---
As long as you wear the &lt;Goblin Rocket Fuel Rats&gt; guild tag, you should always remember that you are representing this guild with your actions. Treat others the way you'd want them to treat you; don't ninja loot, don't spam the chat, help out low level players in quests and dungeons, give them food and potions and buffs, and perhaps some 6-8 slotted bags etc.
---
**Guild Events; it's not just helping but also having fun!**
---
Helping out others is not the only reason for our existance; obviously we should be able to enjoy the game on our own as well.Such as;
---
* 5 man dungeon runs (leveling dungeons, max level dungeons)
---
* World PvP
---
* Molten Core / ZG / AQ20 / BWL / Onyxia runs should be doable with enough people. AQ40/Naxx is not on our scope.
---
* Attunement/key runs
---
* Some light Battlegrounds (when they are released)
---
* "Fuel Runs" where we go out to the wild and help random players
---
**Epilogue; closing thoughts**
---
A little background on myself; I've played WoW almost religiously starting from final stages of Vanilla all throughout Wotlk and beginning of MoP. I did almost everything aside from AQ40/Naxx and PvP ranking. Much like many returning players, this time around I'm too old/busy to have a similar playstyle. Instead I just want to kick back with some friends, and enjoy mainly the social aspect of WoW. I will most likely be tanking 5-mans and offering free food/portals/enchant services on a mage alt as well.
---
The reason I wanted to start this guild is to provide a friendly environment. If I can make one person happy, that's a good day for me. I'm also starting this guild on (Oceanic) PvP server so with some luck I can take revenge on that level 55 gnome rogue who is harrassing those poor level 30's.
---
Feel free to contact me on here via a PM, or on Discord. I feel like I'm a bit old for Discord, but that seems to be the #1 tool to gather players (and also a great upgrade to Ventrillo) so we have a bare-bones server as well.
---
I will update this post as I get more time on my hands with additional information such as member count, raiding times (when applicable) etc. For now, think of us as a mainly helping social guild that does extra activities as well!
---
Thanks for your time.
---
You must be high..
---
Thanks for the comments all, I'm slightly leading more towards Priest, since I want to focus on Healing
---
**Elite Dangerous**
---
Elite Dangerous is a space-flight simulation game developed and published by Frontier Developments. Piloting a spaceship, the player explores a realistic 1:1 scale open-world representation of the Milky Way galaxy, with the gameplay being open-ended. The game is the first in the series to attempt to feature massively multiplayer gameplay, with players' actions affecting the narrative story of the game's persistent universe, while also retaining single-player options. Elite Dangerous is the fourth game in the Elite video game series.

Druids are pretty underpowered in all aspects in Vanilla. Their healing output is low, their damage is low, and they lack a lot of the tools that warrior has for tanking. In PvE they are best used as a offtank/healer (can do both in same spec). 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bG5P71m6D4g
---
The one redeeming quality of a druid is they are the hardest class to kill in PvP. They are super tanky with bear form, have great mobility with shapeshifting, and can heal themselves passively with DoTs. So they make excellent flag carriers in WSG and flag guards in AB (stall until help arrives).
---
Their biggest issue in classic is just a lack of decent gear. There just  isn't much good leather gear in the later dungeon tiers, especially for any non-resto spec. Naxx for example, only has 3 total upgrades for Bear druids, while all other classes replace basically their entire set. There's no good leather spellpower gear either, Moonkins end up running around in cloth. Cat druids will be using a level 24 weapon and a level 45 head from the start of Classic all the way into Naxx, you'll never replace those 2 gear pieces.
---
as was the guy above you.
---
You can taste the salty private server hate in this guy's language.
---
I just got my Original max level character back after having my account hacked and giving up on the game in 2008!
---
I think you are going to get a variety of answers that are inline with however the poster feels about specific tanks. People that advocate for feral tanks will say this doesn't effect them much and others will say this is the death of the fury tank. I think it will be hard to predict how the tanking "meta" will shake out until classes are actually 60.
---
All good man, here is a list of some of the things.
---
* Warrior hamstring kiting
---
* Rogue PvE rotation
---
* PvP trading with slow weapons
---
* Knowing when to use CDs that block attacks like Sheild Block
---
* Nearly every aspect of a hunter's rotation
---
[More in depth things in the previous version posts.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/buadwc/weaponswingtimer_version_30_released/)
---
About half way through the comments, someone asks the same question and gets good responses.
---
Nobody here knows anything about private servers because those are illegal and only derelicts and hackers use private servers
---
Blizzard confirmed no forced rp on RP realms. Rp pvp realms do nothing well. Good pvpers leave for better premades and rpers leave because their events get griefed and camped. You can have an rp pvp event by flagging on a pve server. Dothar the Brave and his band of Paladins are gunna get their fun time ruined by xxfortnitexx and his 40 friends who can corpse camp their event for hours
---
I think the biggest thing throughout the game is the more geared a tank is (I.e later raids) the better they hold aggro. Early on when rogues too dps I think it’s mostly because they can feint and vanish to drop aggro.
---
And The Loch
---
Asmongold is probably the biggest leach of the content creators, with only Bellular coming close. Its funny how popular he is.
---
The size of it is what makes the chat so memorable because you’re there for so long and see the same people in the chat for that whole time, all stuck in the same hole as you
---
Tbqh as someone who mts threat is never an issue during progression if your guild is properly funneling gear to your tank. You run into issues later when warriors and mages start getting retarded with no feint.
---
Barrens chat &gt; gold shire chat
---
Problem is as a 1.12, threat is almost a non-issue. Although with the news around the parry numbers, it's very possible fury tanks are gonna be eating shit, which brings threat back into the equation and is a big buff to hunters. Gonna be interesting to see what happens.
---
Vanilla is very rarely, if ever, equal on all fronts. To say that rogues are never top dps is a slight at best, they can be and will be sometimes on top of the meters.
---
For sure
---
I've ranked two druids on private servers. Getting rogues out of stealth is fine but that little boost from the gloves isn't gonna do it for you. 
---
What are you going to do, walk around looking for him for minutes at a time? You can also just use an alarm obot if you're not shit.
---
Bookmarked :D
---
They've got gnomes, so no.
---
&gt;So, what does this mean for ... fury dps warriors?
---
Here, literally 0, cause fury warriors attack from behind.
---
Right? It's not that huge of a deal. If you want to be the top 1% who are going for "world first" (in the context of Classic release since we all know it wont be actual world first) then that is the only time to worry about min maxing. I'm living that BOOMKIN life when Classic comes out because I like them
---
Can you find a source? I've only ever heard streamers say that as an example, not a number from Blizzard themselves.
---
You aren't going to wander around looking for a guy who may not even be there dude.
---
They sure were, on many occassions throughout vanilla. Maybe not in a generalize form but there are many many many times in peoples Vanilla experience where a rogue topped the meters. The game is rarely ever equal on all fronts and thus its better to just generalize all three classes as top tier dps rather than say one was never better than another.
---
laughs in human warrior tank and sanctuary on all DPS.
---
A tanking issue becomes a threat issue, which becomes a dps issue.
---
I mean.. Would you be more concerned about a warrior? Because that is definitely an easier matchup for a mage.
---
This guild sounds really cool. Exactly what I’m looking for. I played vanilla back in the day but stopped before TBC due to college etc. All this classic hype has made me want to get back into it! Love the Sunny reference too.
---
blizz really did make the alliance the ez mode

Nightelves have 9 more agility than Dwarfs. That's half as much agility as you gain from upgrading a full tier 1 set to tier 2. It might seem insignificant at first but when looking at how much stats there were actually on endgame items it, race choice becomes much more important.
---
Nowhere did I said "leave the raid not-full just so you can get more dwarf priests".
---
I think you are probably right, but I was hoping to get lucky with some great insight.
---
ah, I see Weenie Hut Jr. is recruiting again
---
Well the fury tank will get parry hasted to death in seconds so there's some truth to that. Real tanks will put out less threat so I could imagine it having an impact on fury warriors and warlocks on the horde side.
---
There will be plenty of guilds where the rogue is the most geared and most skilled and will top ofc. In a hardcore guild where people are equally using consumes, gear and a proper rotation rogues should never be on top. Its a class you need and it brings a lot of value, but if its topping your mages and warriors your class lead needs to figure out what people are doing wrong
---
How would this work when you get to a new hub and go accept 10 quests?

Hi! Looking for a guild with these requirements:
---
NA, PVE focused, 18+, Horde, 2-3 nights a week (preferably 2), DKP or Loot Council, no preference on timezone or realm type.
---
I am a nurse that works night shifts from 7p-730a, 3 nights on and 4 nights off a week with rotating weekends so Fridays/weekends are not nights I can guarantee being able to raid. Even though I will have a lot of free time with my extended amount of days off a week, my days on are not usually the same. Looking for a guild that can accommodate my strange schedule with flexibility in raid groups/rotation of players. 
---
I'm hoping to join a semi-casual guild that is looking to enjoy the game with its raiders instead of making raiding miserable. Super excited for the feeling of community again and really hoping to find a guild that I can make friendships in and be able to enjoy the game again with its members.
---
I have raid experience TBC-Cata, with hunter experience from TBC-mid Wrath and spriest experience in a US top 30 guild from mid Wrath to Cata. I'm looking to play any ranged DPS class, most likely mage or warlock, but would be willing to get back into hunter if need be.
---
PST if any of this sounds like I'd fit in with your group! :)
---
it was always me and the rogue sitting there waiting for the rest to run back unless the healer was a nelf.
---
Cookies stirring rod from deadmines
---
&gt;This means you're spastisitcally going in and out of caster form and cat form every time your energy goes to 0.
---
&gt;you'll also need dark runes
---
&gt;you'll need a shit ton of Manual Crowd Pummelers
---
&gt;you can maybe do the dps of an under geared rogue whose barely paying attention.
---
All of these are wrong.
---
Plus I think there is a moonwell in Moon glade, would make druid a solid pick. Teleport to moonglade, make mooncloth. Hearth back to IF/Org. Sell item and sell arcanite transmute if doing that as well.
---
Not mind blowing profits, but relatively low effort past the leveling and getting professions up
---
This ain’t old, people make these on a website. There’s the whole Azeroth map somewhere.
---
I mean, technically we can drop windfury for a similar effect... That windfury tho.
---
It wont be that big of a deal, bis races will be more important and tanks will generate more rage from the parry haste. Healers will need to activate 3 braincells instead of 2 and be accurate with their preheals
---
As long as certain meme specs have a good spec, consumables and enchants than there isnt any reason to deny them a spot. Still, you cant have too many though. Their well documented short comings will stunt a raids progression if there are too many. 
---
As for representation, I'm PRAYING it's not like Classic. There were SO many ret Pallys and most of the druids on my server Alliance side wanted to play feral dps. Shit sucked, it made recruitment difficult
---
It was 15% in Vanilla and only 5% on pservers, right? Thats a fairly large difference if we are being honest. I am not sure how feral druids come into play here, they should always be attacking from behind the boss and thus shouldn't get parried. Unless you mean feral tank?
---
People who are looking for 51s for honor will still probably kill anyone passing by, though.
---
If you dont feel any accomplishments in retail wow you're probably doing some shit content like lfr and random heroics. I felt really really good about my Cutting Edge on Jaina. I feel i deserved it and it took my guild quite some time to get there and kill her, before she got nerfed to shit.
---
Laughs at you in wow.
---
then looks at username
---
Then laughs again as an adult in real life.

87 days. “Old post”

---
Thanks for reminding me of all the fun I’m not having.
---
Just the way we like it.
---
I found that the aoe slow from blizzard works great, I would have to cone of cold before i nova to make use of that. Im not that skilled yet.
---
If you go in one direction for long enough, you will end up where you started.
---
I also did the same, bud sadly my seasonal job starts after labor day, so I will be using the time I should he working my mechanic job to game and go to my pumpkin patch when I would normally leave work.  Sadly after my PTO I will be stuck only playing late nights and weekends.  :(
---
I fucking love these guys. Storm's stream was so damn funny when they were on
---
Asked this last time but you didn't respond;
---
Is there a way to make the addon show a swing timer for when you complete a cast? In the beta, completing any spell cast (instant or cast time) will push your swing timer back to its full duration. No swing timer addon right now properly shows this. Is it possible?
---
He doesn't know pepeLaugh
---
Sorry, I didn’t mean to sound so standoffish. Im just working off of memory. I’m willing to bet there’s more dwarf priests this go around but in my memory they were relatively rare. I imagine many “planned” guilds will have plenty to choose from, but I’m guessing in many servers you’d have to choose from who you can find. In any case, I don’t think rolling night elf is going to keep OP from getting in a raid.
---
Certain fights are going to cater to certain play styles and classes more than other fights. Its been that way since the beginning and remains that way today. There will be times where even if all things are equal (gear and skill wise) that a rogue can be on top. I think its best that we both just agree to disagree tho. Cheers :)
---
True fact.  WoW is designed to be one hand play friendly.  It was pretty popular in Korea to play while having your other arm around your girlfriend in a cybercafe.
---
People do earthgrab kiting, never heard of frostshock kiting tho
---
I loved watching them follow Summit in stealth and anytime an alliance would fuck with him they would come out of no where and protect summit. You had no idea if they were there or not since they weren’t grouped with him.
---
There's a PvE beta server too.
---
There's lots of money to be made once you hit endgame, especially if you're one of the first people there. A good example is Devilsaurs, the set you make from their leather is pre-raid BiS for rogues/hunters/cat druids/DPS warriors/enhancement shamans. And the set bonus is so good you generally need to have replacements for BOTH pieces before you drop them.
---
You can make a ton of money by farming Devilsaurs and selling the leather. But there's only a handful of spawns and each has a 10-15 minute respawn. If you're one of the first people to 60 (especially if you get there before layering ends) then you'll have several days of pretty much uncontested farm and make a ton of money off it.
---
14 and 5.   Yes, feral tanks.  They have more effective health, but they take more damage than warriors.  It might make them too squishy to tank.
---
This guy thinks you can't compete with friends and have fun lol
---
"ZappyBoi" the human, female, paladin.... my name is confirmed!!!!
---
I know for sure asmon is against it.
---

---
I intend on making 3 classes I have in mind and just playing the one I fancy at the time
---
The best quest in the game is [Counterattack!], change my mind.
---
\*centaur enters aggro radius\*  
---
'FOR THE HORDE!'  
---
'TIME FOR KILLING!'  
---
'TIME TO *DIE!*'
---
The issue comes in the fact that tanks will now be doing way less threat then they did on pservers and inturn fury warriors(who have no threat reduction) will be doing way less damage then they were doing on pservers. If you go back and watch kills from the top guilds in vanilla doing naxx and such youll notice you dont really see many fury warriors and barely any brown on the top of the meters, which on pservers fury was generally accepted as the top dps when it came to late-late game.
---
Definitely going to be a big shake up come Classic.
---
&gt;Honestly, I do feel sorry for people who treat the game like this, you are truly missing out on a lot.
---
Why? If someone likes progression, then they aren't missing out on anything. I didn't feel like I missed out on anything when I hopped my way up through 7 guilds in 2 months to get to a guild where I didn't feel 10x better than everyone else. I didn't feel like I missed out when my guild was mentioned on the method world first stream for joining the pack at the absolute top.
---
If you want to raid with people because it's fun and not focus on performance and results then all the more power to you, but trying to force that mindset on other people is really sad and doesn't make you any better than people who try to force people to play meta specs because they think it's better. 
---
&gt;What's so wrong with teaching someone or giving them pointers to be a better player instead of just outright ditching them?
---
If someone isn't even willing to take their own time to learn their class without having to be taught by others then why would you want to raid with them?
---
Some people just like having a visible timer for when their next weapon swing or auto shot is going to happen.
---
Plus the reasons Noul listed, yeah.
---
Agreed, fantastic for quick DM North Tribute runs.
---
Once you start playing PvP on a hunter seriously, rogues become quite a joke. Feign-Trap, flare on trap so he can't dispell+stealth, scatter to burn sprint timer, concussive, wing clip when he gets to you, and just run in circles till your pet demolishes him. Doesn't require gear, just the know-how.
---
Of course if the rogue outgears you, you'll be stunlocked and killed. But since you wear mail, you have more of a chance.
---
"Favorite Movie: Shrek 2" lmao
---
Most of the people I saw raiding as memespecs were healers who healed all through MC in blues and only got to play boomkin or ele shaman after everyone was in BWL gear and the raid could afford to drop a healer.
---
A good number of people want to level up as memespec and join a raid and never tank or heal, just memespec it to Naxx, and that shit is the lie.
---
This is 2019.

I would endorse druid. You get a lot of options there.
---
Dude he was just stating downsides if any at all why you need to attack small brain
---
The cc in raids in TBC was fucking awesome to do. I still remember killing stuff through chainsheeps etc. Also i miss attunements and big quests that you feel actually got you there. Even if you were one of few to get it.
---
I feel that retail and classic will complement each other pretty well. When one has a drought, the other will get a new patch, then when that gets old the other one will get one. 
---
I'm kind of excited to truly try out retail beyond a trial account since I haven't really played since Wrath. I hope I can still get Ashbringer on a Paladin and go kick Arthas' ass.
---
All of my vanilla characters made it to at least level 80, some of them even to 100.  I was a slow learner
---
Yeah no idea what he's talking about. Only place for feral druids is in bear form, and all the tanking stuff is blues from quests/5 mans.
---
Fact is, playing hunters in raid is 10 times harder than most dps classes when you only need to worry about CD and pushing one button.
---
You need a slow weapon and then learn how to not clip your autoshots with aimshots. From my experience 2 hunters with the same gear but a different level of skill the dps difference can be tripled.
---
I witnessed hunters with the same level of gear as me doing less damage than my hunter in autoshot on Patchwerk, while i was healing with my druid (on pserver), it's how bad you can be if you lose your autoshots during aimshots cast.
---
From classic and pserver experience, hunters who mastered their rotation and pet will do more damage than mage and warlock up to T2 (BWL), from then it's a long way to hell. In any case, other hunters will perpetuate the meme of doing subpar dps like retardin.
---
I take long dumps..
---
Wrong. Lots of data is correct but some of it is incorrect. In my experience using it for the past few years, I'd say around 5-10% of it is incorrect.

what he doesnt realize is in naxx our holy damage goes through the roof and after BWL our fire damage can do some damage

---
I think it will largely remain the same as it is on private servers. Warrior tanks are best for almost every fight. Druids and pallies can offtank or even main tank some of the bosses.
---
I doubt we will see too much of the fury main tank meta tho given the new information. Maybe one some seriously overgeared farm runs

This is funny because I had that quest reward on my hotbar for the entire time playing wow.  Ready to be used in a key moment in a raid.
---
I'm not acting hard, you are acting soft. I'm telling you to suck it up.
---
You have your view of PvP I have mine. There is nothing more to talk about, get the fuck over it kid.
---
After the mixed responses to my last post, I figured I'd post another updated version
---
As some people pointed out my last post was done on a touchscreen laptop, not a phone. So I've fixed this and done it on my Android.
---
Overall this was simple to do, and the steps are:
---
* Turn on "Click to Move"
---
* Modify "bindings-cache.wtf" to swap your left click and right click binds
---
* Using LunaUF and Move Anything to setup huge buttons and UI elements
---
* Download Chrome Remote Desktop onto your phone and computer
---
* Remote into the desktop using you're phone
---
* Play WoW: Immortal
---
If it came to raiding I've setup my frames to accomodate healing a 40-man raid. [Here is a screenshot of the config](https://i.imgur.com/JR0ABb1.png)
---
I totally expect that this would be viable in a casual to moderate raiding guild.
---
Halo got me tho. The trailer gave me feelings not gonna lie
---
Yeah, it says hey...Equinox6...you’re too big for this mount.
---
Big shakeup? Hardly. What I see is rogues who has been slightly behind warriors for a while will be better than warriors on classic, and that's it. Yeah it evens out the damage a bit more but warriors and rogues are still way way stronger. And this also completely ignores armor values which are intentionally buffed on pservers. Yeah things will be different on classic, that's not really a surprise, but don't expect for melee to lose their top dps.
---
It's hilarious how much you're overstating the difference this is going to make. Tanks will get more of their hits parried, but this also causes them to get hit more often and generate more rage.
---
The only reason why furies would do less damage than on pservers is if world buffs are not as important because of the cooldown. Armor is already buffed on pservers by 25%.
---
[Here's a video from Vanilla btw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26ACEQmdslA)

Having just signed up for fall semester, I am a little worried myself... but I just have to realize I’m not 13 anymore and can’t no life on a video game.. I have real life responsibilities. Looks good on paper anyway.
---
Sorry for not replying last time. 
---
Yeah it should be possible, do you know if its only on spells with a cast time? There are 3 types of spells, instant, ones with a cast time, and channeled spells. 
---
Instant casts usually dont reset the timer. Apparently ones with a cast time reset the timer. Do you know if channeled spells reset it?
---
To answer your question, it shouldn't be too difficult because most of the infrastructure is already there for the hunter bars. I just need to know the behavior before I put it in there.
---
*'Where the hell is the flag?!'*
---
*'I don't understand the question and I won't respond to it'*
---
What about when the raid is on farm and the tank out gears the content, such as the case with speed runs? This is why I think it's hard to definitively say fury tanks won't be a thing.
---
I've done this with steam link. It's almost impossible to do much more than move around.
---
Yeah but can it run Crysis?
---
Lucky. I paged a GM and they said my account was perma-banned for 3rd party programs. Haven’t played the account since Burning Crusade launch.

 &lt;Regicide&gt; | Alliance | NA | PvP | Semi-Hardcore  
---
Regicide is a semi hardcore guild born out of a love for the game as it was. A group of people in love with the world and community that was created by Blizzard back in ‘04. We seek to be among some of the higher guilds on the server through raiding and in our world pvp. We are seeking raiders as well as some officer positions available. Socials are welcome, whether it be to be part of a community or you just need some help every once and a while with quests. Come join us!  
---
Expectations: We expect that raiders keep up with the pack when it comes to early leveling and reach level 60 within a week or two of the first 60’s. You will get out of this guild and experience as much as you put in. If you want to be near the top then you are expected to help with prep as well as basic help around the guild.   
---
The ONLY set in stone rule: Don’t be a dick. Respect one another, and speak with officers if issues arise. The last thing we need is turmoil that is hidden from everyone just to explode at random.

It will have some impact on threat generation, but nowhere near as much as some people make it sound like lmao.
---
fucking roleplay servers lmao
---
If there isn't a full 40an rag kill on phones - why the fuck are we even alive?
---
Lol at the raid frames. You must have the thumbs of an ant
---
Eh its common knowledge that PvE servers are for the most casual playerbase who do tend to be worse at the game since they fear PvP. 
---
Also all the best guilds in vanilla that got world 1sts were on PvP servers, some come back with some logical sense bud.
---
&gt;you don't wipe because of less dps
---
What fucking game did you play? Ever play a healer? You realize mana is finite right?
---
Guy is being hyperbolic, they just do a bit more dmg on pservers
---
I’m not trying to put words in your mouth, just getting back to the original point of the comment is all. Solidifying your point, if you will.
---
Yes, Nostalrius did it as well, and it wasn't a secret. I believe they mentioned it in patch notes and stuff, which nobody reads. The game felt too easy for everybody because it wasn't 2004 anymore and everyone wasn't AS stupid as they were before. They buffed mob damage and probably health, not sure on the last one, to compensate for how easy it was to make it "feel" more like Vanilla.
---
Most people were running around with the wrong stats on their gear, warriors in mail or leather etc. and the game was harder because they were getting hit like trucks, healing for shit amounts etc. In private servers, years later after people understood stats and rpg mechanics better, they optimized their gear and played properly. With proper gear the game becomes much easier. Instead of the game requiring skill at that point, it simply requires you to not be retarded. "Skill" back in Vanilla mostly consisted of knowing what gear to equip and actually getting it, mechanically speaking, Vanilla is about as easy as it gets. People don't want to play Classic because they think it's going to be hard, they want to play it because it has a lot of struggles, nothing is handed to you and it has a lot of content. All things missing from retail WoW and has been for most expacks. Even TBC and Wrath had a lot of handouts, they just weren't as offensive as the others.
---
Yeah, screen real estate's a bit on an issue with this, probably need to get a stylus to make it work well.
---
I feel like classic is going to be alot "easier" than Vanilla was. Just due to the overall knowledge base of the players/easily available.
---
It's 2019, a game released in 2004 being rereleased won't be insanely hard by today's gaming standards unless blizzard were to make changes.
---
It'll be harder in some ways than retail, sure, but from an endgame perspective....just knowing and being used to wow raiding Mechanics in general will make mc/bwl and even most of aq a cakewalk compared to how they were 15 years ago.
---
I'm just excited to play a dungeons and dragons feeling rpg instead of the super hero simulator that retail has become.
---
2.5 years is pretty damn good for a re-release of a game that’s 15 years old.  I don’t think they’re looking to get another 15 out of it.
---
I'm in SW because everyone else is. I'd rather be closer to menithal harbour, and the Artisan eng
---
Only things out of e3 for me are keanupunk 2077 and maybe dying light 2 (just had a ton of fun with the first)
---
So you are spot on with 2020 thing :)
---
We have a solid 5-6 months of classic gaming.
---
It's going to be very strange having a main game again for a while.
---
I'm sure you have.
---
OP's 'calculations' factor in 0 travel time, 0 vendor time, 0 training time and presume you never run out of mobs or die, and for some reason you kill exactly 1 mob every 30 seconds at every level based on basically nothing. So yeah it's pretty out there as far as calculations go.
---
I know people who have played retro wow for 4 years ;(
---
My actual computer can’t even run crysis lol
---
I think you would have to out gear the content by a lot. We're talking AQ geared tanks going into MC which they wouldn't really do except for maybe the bindings.
---
Regular tanks on the other hand could grow stronger from this since it will allow for Revenge to always be available once it's off cooldown.
---
I never suggested to force any mindset on anyone at all.  That’s you conjuring up that thought from what I said.  I said I feel sorry for them because I believe they are missing out on the greater aspects of the game.  That’s it.  Did I say, “you should never play the game like that no one should, we should all be casuals”.  Did I say that?  I don’t think I did. 
---
And I said I believe they are missing out, because I have been on both ends of it.  Oh wow you got mentioned on some stream?  That’s pretty cool dude.  /s
---
Honestly I’m just saying that for me, when I was in top tier raiding guilds, (ones I joined after I left mine in tbc/early wrath),  it felt empty.  Like yeah we cleared everything down we had the best of the best gear,  but I didn’t enjoy being around those people sweating and yelling and throwing fits every night in vent.  So for me, yes, I do feel sorry for anyone who has never experienced or wants to even try to experience the lax guilds where it’s no pressure to get anything done.  It’s a fucking video game for Christ sake. 
---
&gt; If someone isn't even willing to take their own time to learn their class without having to be taught by others then why would you want to raid with them?
---
Children children children... you’ll learn someday... you know there were people back when WoW was new that never knew that there were guides online for this type of stuff right?  Maybe you’re young, but back when wow came out, there was literally no YouTube.. and even in tbc YouTube wasn’t nearly as popular as it is today.  Back then giving someone a helping hand was common.  Also, some people may not really hve the time to look into this stuff.  Most of the people I raided with had families, not everyone is a 14-23 year old just living to play video games.
---
Or Picard in Star Trek Generations:
---
&gt; I rather believe that time is a companion who goes with us on the journey and reminds us to cherish every moment, because it will never come again. What we leave behind is not as important as how we've lived.
---
From what I could tell, ANY spell, whether it has cast time or instant, pushed back your swing timer to full duration. I'd assume channeled spells work like that too, but not sure. I played a druid in the stress test, and any instant cast (rejuv, moonfire, etc) would push back my swing timer. Apparently that's blizzlike.
---
It’ll happen for sure but you start to learn about it. It becomes part of the server story. 
---
In retail it’s all just dust in the wind. You might never interact with that character again.
---
You don't need to if you have the gloves. You just need to not get opened on before you get the flag safely and enter bear form - which the gloves will prevent (because you can see him before he sees you).
---
I was here.  We will come back to this comment and laugh.
---
You definitely have to wonder. 3 races all conglomerate there after they've completed their 1-10 zone. Plus Undead have the motivation to head into Barrens too I suppose because of Wailing Caverns. 
---
This doesn't really happen on Alliance side at all. 
---
Crossroad/Barrens were a really unique experience for sure.
---
Excited to experience 60 enhancement again.
---
The best thing to do is get an addon for gear sets, IE OUtfitter.   Before drinking and if you are walking to another mob, put on 100% spirit gear.  then when about to attack a mob start casting and swap to your normal gear.  
---
Once I started doing this lets say past 25+ it makes it way more bearable.
---
Haha.  I forgot all those chuck norris jokes from barrens chat.
---
Use an iPad, something like the iPad Pro would be bomb to use for this. I love it though either way!
---
oh no you used a 30sec cd, how will you manage?
---
Not true. Blade of Savagery was better than the Season 3 offhand. There is not much difference between the two and this is a good thing because neither should PvE items dominate in PvP nor should PvP items dominate in PvE. 
---
In the end PvP players were hit much harder than PvE players in regads to itemization (items like Glaives, Thori'Dal, Skull of Gul'dan, Stormherald in the beginning etc. were way better than the PvP items). The secound part of your post would make it even worse.
---
Everyone else is worried they'll get sucked in. I'm *hoping* for it.
---
I've been really bored with games lately. For many years, WoW would be my main leisure time hobby. Once I dropped BfA a month after it launched I found this vacuum that couldn't be filled by anything else.
---
I mained a protection Paladin back in the day. I felt a little slow, but extremely safe. Even with risky pulls or higher level mobs I rarely felt like I was in danger. 
---
So you sacrifice speed for safety.
---
Yes.  Mindless attacking in the meat grinder.  Sneaking around and trying to get an objective behind enemy lines.  Summoning the Raid boss to make a big push.   Wiping the other side while their raid boss was out and leading the raid boss well behind our lines (raid guild with raid tanks and healers) so the other side couldn't support it.   Mining to get war mats.  In the enemy mine.   
---
  
---
vs, all 40 people run past each other to race to see who can kill the other side's leader first.
---
"Man vanilla sure is easy, I dont know what all the fuss was about. You never have to grind for anything!"

Its not just about being able to clear.

Its about doing MC in 2 hours instead of 2 and a half when you have to clear it every week.

most of the time you kite in the same area anyway even on a warrior

I tried this and was turned down.  They told me that since I started my new account through Overwatch and then added Wow to it after they couldn't merge my WoW accounts?  Was a bit bummed out because my old account had so much on it but I didn't feel like leveling more toons to 120 from that account, or paying for 2 separate accounts.

This is so false my guild cleared up to twin emps and had our token ret paladin, if you show up farm your consumables know the strats you'll get a raid spot.
---
Agreed, I have short spurts with other games.  Maybe a month with a d2 ladder reset, a few weeks with civ 6 xpacs.  Never anything like the 8 years I played wow.
---
It's your $14.95 so play the way you want, but it's the raids' $583.05, so come to the raid prepared with a non-meme spec.

You dont cast dots until you mana drain the paladin

LOOKING FOR A HARDCORE GUILD
---
* Region - NA PST
---
* Class - Probably rogue	
---
* Server - PvP
---
* Faction - Horde
---
* Age - 29
---
I have played since WoW release and have retail experience clearing AQ.
---
Have 60s on K1 and ND.
---
Min/Max type of player that comes prepared with all consumes/enchants and boss fight knowledge.
---
I have pretty much no life and plan to drop way too much time on this game. I will hit 60 within the first week.
---
I'm looking for a guild that plans on being the dominant guild on the server, a guild looking for a &lt;week 2 rag kill.
---
I believe in teamwork and helping guildies as much as possible, be it leveling or running nonstop dungeons to get everyone BiS as much, and as fast as possible.
---
Currently im just playing beta practicing routes/speedleveling :)
---
I think with limited endgame content speed runs become a possible meta. This is based off current pservers, so take that with a grain of salt.
---
It bugs me so much more than it should
---
This would be very useful for playing the AH while stuck at work.
---
We’re talking about hunter DPS scaling, not a class spec that has the DPS of a hunter pet.
---
Any chance you’d be willing to put together a more in depth step by step?
---
Just because Trump sucks doesn't make Hillary good.
---
feral will still be trash, warriors will still be  the best tank, and fury will still be top tier dps
---
All streamers?
---
The leveling is just the tip of the iceberg though. I want to raid and that means at least semi regular 3-4 hr sessions on weeknights most likely.
---
You will be competing with warriors for a lot of loot.
---
 **\[PVP / RP / RP-PVP - US anytime zone / Alliance preferred, but will roll Horde for the right guild\]** Currently looking for an Alliance guild (casual or semi-hardcore) that aims at having a member cap (quality over quantity approach). Before I go further I just want to clarify that big guilds are completely fine; However, I personally much prefer the tight-knit atmosphere of a 50-60 man capped guild where everyone knows one another. I've been a part of both and there was always something that I enjoyed about raiding with the same people every week and growing as a team element instead of witnessing clicks and the like. I understand that a guild like this is not the norm and will probably be difficult to find, which is why I am casting out my line in the hopes that it reaches a guild with a similar mindset.
---
**About me:** I'm in my 30's and I currently work from home so raid attendance should pose little to no issue. At first I mained 2h fury but eventually moved into resto druid which is what I plan to main this time around with alchemy/herbalism as my professions. As for raids my experience stretches from MC to the first half of Ahn'Qiraj. In regards to pvp I maintained the rank of Lieutenant General during my time in vanilla. I've been in leadership roles before, but I much prefer following directions rather than giving them out. I always try my best to excel and come prepared with consumables and ready ahead of time. I know when to be in a relaxed and chill mind frame vs being serious for raids. My plan is to play an excorbinant amount of hours that I can to obtain BiS pre-raid asap, consumables and the like while helping out others along the way.
---
Thank you for taking the time to read my post. Please feel free to message me if you would like more information or fit the criteria.
---
So there is “PvP”...but it’s probably not what you think...in WoW (or World of Warcrap) PvP stands for Paladin versus Paladin.  A paladin is the Alliance version of a “Druid”.  They are well known for their abilities to travel through time (just forward not backward) and they are the only class that can enter a Cathedral or similar place of worship.  
---
Paladin vs Paladin is a mainstay of WoW...they will often compete in tests of strength, wits, and tenuous heterosexuality.  The matches are often very long lasting from 2004 to 2019...and when one wins he must decapitate his opponent in order to steal his power, just like the famous hollywood movie “Land Before Time IV”.  
---
I hope this clears it up for you.
---
I prefer playing Horde, but Duskwood is hands down my favorite zone in the game.

Its just super easy to establish up front "no ret pallies".

My experience in vanilla was that there were always ninja looters, especially at lower levels. Trolling is a part of WoW and plenty of people have fun simply messing with others.
---
Doing battle in Booty Bay against those goblin pirates is the best, when you are high enough level😆
---
Depends on class and spec or do you mean BoE items?
---
Hi, /u/xanas1489
---
&gt; That said, I can imagine in the early going it will be similar to current expansions where people just wanna level up and will largely avoid too much conflict. 
---
This was not the case in beta
---
But do you not feel joy for them that they love the alternative to spaghetti? It's a pretty grown up thought that other people get joy differently than you, not that they get strictly less joy because they don't like spaghetti.

You're making that glove bonus sounds amazing. You make it sound like it's just going to allow you to spot the rogue every time. Even tho the stats are horrendous for carrying and you could easily just swap them on and off when needed. 
---
You really want the set to be good, so you're scratching at every rhyme or reason to make it so. Go ahead use the whole set. Hell keep the gloves on 24/7. I can't stop you. Three pieces is what most druids use. It's very rare to see more than that.
---
Ah the epitome of hypocrisy
---
Not many know about the fix. And it's been reported over and over for years. Blizzard knows about it but
---
I've seen his run of Zul Farrak. The guy can't tank for shit.
---
my ret gives you a faster clear than billy the dipshit PvP specced rogue.
---
Dude what path are you trying to go down? Classic will be a rebirth of the original game? Of course it's going to be easier people have 15 years of experience? Besides its a completely separate entity, long term future of wow is retail, classic is something for the fans doesn't need to take from retail at all.

When I was testing on the stress test you can keybind it and when pressed it still opens the keyring. Just not a UI element that's visible right now I guess.

It isnt a painting, it was created on Inkarnate. It is a map making tool used primarily for d&amp;d maps.

2h zerker tanking 😂 I’ve never cringed so hard in my life.

Goes on to say, " Stream sniping isnt even necessarely bad, esp if theyre doing a 1v1, if its like 5 people doing it trying to 5v1 me and camp me for 2 years, now we have a problem thats just riduclous, and if they follow u around, also if they follow ur ghost around its just...ridiculous"
---
Hi, /u/xdysoriented
---
I got it on my priest purely for transmog but I'm excited to get it for real this time.
---
I sorta want them to revert my level 70 priest back to my level 60 priest but I know they can't do that.  Grats on getting your character back.
---
It’s not about the alternative.  The subject is the thing I’m discussing.  You’re twisting my thought again... I’m not saying you can ONLY like spaghetti and nothing else.  That’s not what I said.  I just said if they can’t enjoy something I find to be amazing I feel sorry that they can’t find the joy in it.  I understand people can like other stuff, I have even said that in my post if you read it thoroughly.  If you just understand what I’m saying, and not what you THINK I’m trying to say, maybe you will struggle less.
---
I remember having some sort of threat meter during Vael.  And that was well before AQ40 dropped.  It was definitely needed though.  Without it, it was very easy to pull aggro.
---
Because if all you bring is 25 of the “1k” class, then half your loot will go to waste, and your raid’s loot progression will slow, resulting in most of your “1k” classes are still doing 1k whereas the 700 would be 1.2k if you had utilized gear efficiently.
---
To be intentionally wrong, they have to know what is correct first.   There's no way in hell they know the true armor #s of the bosses, if they couldn't even bother to figure out the parry chance.
---
he did some elite quest in badlands a day or two ago. he pulled some mob and couldn't even hold aggro on one mob over a healer
---
I’m in the Beta now and I didn’t really have a problem going up to 30 and then to 40. Obviously the lower levels minimize conflict risk but even getting to 40 wasn’t as bad as I thought and lots of people, including myself leveled in groups of random so even if a brawl went down it wasn’t too bad. 
---
I also encountered lots of horde solo where we waved and danced and went along our way. Pretty much exactly how I remember leveling 14 years ago.
---
Camwhores are fine as long as you are not donating.
---
We had a ret pally in my guild back in vanilla who would tank 5 mans for us all the time. I don't know what his exact build was but he did quite good at it, even in the non-undead 5p instances. In the undead ones he was god-mode, couldn't rip aggro off him.

Shit, I haven't even decided on my professions. I know I'm probably doing herb/skinning while I level, but I dunno if I want to go with herb/alch or mining/engi at endgame. I'll be playing a tauren shaman, and I'm not benefit as much from engi as I can't so super hardcore like I feel is necessary to merit engi. Also, I need a way to make money, and mining sucks for that.
---
I still remember my amazement when I found out there there was whole another continent at eastern kingdom when from Kalimdor, I ended up into a westfall graveyard. Of course I was too clueless to right click on the map to expand it, I only saw the areas that I was in.

Problem is that a lot of fights have mechanics that people will screw up.
---
Faster the boss dies, less time there is to screw up.
---
Can someone explain how he did this? Lol

Because I’m also not willing to double my /played to 60 time for a few trinkets.

Doesn't WoW *technically* have a Click-to-move setting?
---
I vividly remember it as being the one setting which nobody used.
---
but when monkeynews does it people say that the damage values are shit
---
fuck streamers
---
Glaives were way too overpowered imo and never should have been made that strong to start with.
---
The idea that they should even be comparable is part of what led to the BFA of today, that everyone should be entitled to a top tier of gear to fit their playstyle. When you can get near equivalent to the best gear in the game through mostly solo queing and 3v3 in a fraction of the time it takes to key through all the raid instances with 24 other people is what led to the i want it my way crowd of casual players also expecting their fair share of loot for just logging in after school for an hour or two. PVP gear made it so you didn't need to be in a guild really even to get competitive top gear, which is not what vanilla was about imo.
---
I'm not playing in a guild like that. We're going to have fun.
---
&gt;Oh wow you got mentioned on some stream? That’s pretty cool dude. /s
---
Oh wow you got glad, you did pretty well in the pvp minigame dude /s
---
&gt;sweating and yelling and throwing fits every night in vent
---
I've not played in a single guild like this, in fact I've found that at least nowadays the higher end guilds are usually really chill and that the guilds I hopped through generally had gms on power trips or massive egos etc. We constantly had people playing games together outside wow and hanging out in each others streams to banter and have a good time. Sounds like you just weren't in the right guilds
---
&gt;I do feel sorry for anyone who has never experienced or wants to even try to experience the lax guilds where it’s no pressure to get anything done. It’s a fucking video game for Christ sake.
---
But why should people feel obliged to try this? Once again different people like different things. Every time I've played in a casual guild on an alt I always end up leaving because apparently not wiping to a normal boss is elitist and dying in the big purple swirlies is a good joke. 
---
&gt;you know there were people back when WoW was new that never knew that there were guides online for this type of stuff right? Maybe you’re young, but back when wow came out, there was literally no YouTube
---
this isn't now though, and we're talking about raiding with these people now. Sure I can understand way back when people didn't have access to learning resources, but now if someone can't find out how to do a 2 button rotation for their class it's honestly really worrying. 
---
&gt;Children children children...

Boomer alert

Wow. Your anecdotal experience is different to mine, I must be wrong.
---
Moron.
---
i hope with your loot system the 2 raiders and 1 loot council vote to give DFT to a hunter/feral
---
What do you have against Bob Ross?
---
A boomkin will do around half the DPS of a mage.
---
Its only worth bringing if there is absolutely nobody else.
---
Hours aren't the only metric of whether someone could be considered hardcore though. I'd say it's more of a style of how you play. I can play all day, but I still consider myself a casual because I don't try to minmax often, I take my time, I don't look up optimal routes or anything. I just sort of play, have fun, level kinda slowly but in a way that I want to. I think someone who plays only 1-3 hours a day can be hardcore, if they want to optimise everything they do in that time and have a lot of laid out plans etc.

It's beta.

Hey I’m very interested.  I’ll get on discord tomorrow and reach out.  Best to you!
---
Halo and WoW are my most anticipated games. What year is it?! Haha
---
A shadow priest will do about half the DPS of a mage. Guilds won't overlook that.
---
People who think this game will be anywhere near as balanced as BFA are in for a surprise.
---
learning recipes is quite expensive, and getting the materials quite a chore.  Not sure this is a good idea.
---
Back in cata my account got hacked got pissed and stopped playing. Got the itch back and called them up and got it back all my gear and shit was gone but it was maybe 2hrs of crap to get my account back and it felt good
---
Well, horde don't have salvation, and Warlocks in general have zero talents/spells to reduce threat. And you're correct about parry and furies, that whole pserver phenomenon with 20sec boss kills ain't gonna happen on Classic, at least not during early progression.
---
Lmao, imagine giving some guy a blue BOE who will never acknowledge you, and didn't even say your character's name after you gave it to him.

Parasocial relationships man. They're brutal.

Dwarf looks the best in T2. so Dwarf.
---
What books are you thinking of?
---
It's funny because without pservers we wouldn't have classic. But yea, fuck em.
---
It’s basically weapon skill in maces and swords vs stoneskin. You can cleanse most of the debuffs that stoneskin removes so it’s not as useful for a pally.
---
Female dwarf is the only answer.
---
I always look at casuals as just being those who in combination both suck and don't invest enough time to get better.
---
Oh yeah I always forgot about that one. Increases healing from paladin heal?
---
To what extent man? It's not going to be noticeably different unless you are a top 100 guild. Just play what you and your friends enjoy.
---
Barrens chat FTW
---
Human is better for non-healing due to mace/sword spec. As for healing, The Human Spirit is minimally beneficially which cannot be said for Dwarfs.
---
Ever saw top tier vanilla guilds with 8 dps warriors?
---
I think because of how it's programmed, its possible for two hunters to proc their T8 set bonus at the same exact time. The code likely checks for a current debuff on the boss, refreshes it if its there, and adds a debuff to the boss if its not. In that few milliseconds between the failed buff check---&gt;applying the buff, another hunter's application slid in and doubled.
---
The reason why its suspect is because those hunters are in BWL gear at least (possibly AQ but I don't know if that's the Sandreaver polearm or not). Tier 2 had a decent proc rate, and with 34 hunters there should be 5-10 procs up on the boss, not a random 2 at once for a straight minute.
---
Lmao I noticed it after I pushed post and it was too late
---
Oasis of Marr?
---
I rolled a horse after being alliance for 30 levels just so I could go to cross roads.  It lived up to everything I ever wanted.
---
Also the reason it happened in the video is because there's 34 hunters. The chances of it happening with 2-4 hunters in a normal raid would be astronomically low.
---
Reddit expirds: fury tanks will be parry hasted to death 
---
Pserver hardcore guild tanks: Literally sit down all the time to enforce getting critted
---
Yeah, from the two primary paladin heals.
---
It’s one of the biggest changes I’d like to reddit
---
No, I remember threat being a huge issue for our mages, and rogues though.    DPS warrior shave no threat reduction modifiers or threat dumps either.

Agreed... I own a PS4 but that’s the ONLY game that makes me want an XBOX... but ohhh does it make me consider it
---
The shadow oil is by definition a periodic buff, so the code might be checking the status of the buff the damage is associated with.
---
I choose the latter
---
Probably too abusable
---
I'm afraid I'm going to have to debunk your theory. One of the debuffs falls off at 2:23 while the other falls off at 2:25. 
---
There's also only a handful of hunters in full T2 in that video. Some of them are in T3, T2.5, T1, mish-mash, etc.
---
FF7 just announced for March 2020. Thank god lol that would have been another I would have been torn over
---
Dwarf has Stoneform, Human has wep skills.
---
Some will arfue that dwarf pally is bad because they can already remove poisons with a spell.
---
Prot or Ret go Human. If Holy then its not really going to matter what you chose.
---
Lvling might be easier as human because mosy of your dmg will be white-hits anyways.
---
I actually have not and I'm having trouble tracking them down. They sound hilarious, can you help me out?
---
&gt; Oh wow you got glad, you did pretty well in the pvp minigame dude /s
---
You’re right in putting the /s because it wasn’t my goal I was just having fun.  I’m not ‘proud’ of that I was just mentioning it because some people tend to think you can’t accomplish anything in the game without being a sweaty tryhard.  
---
&gt; I've not played in a single guild like this, in fact I've found that at least nowadays the higher end guilds are usually really chill and that the guilds I hopped through generally had gms on power trips or massive egos etc. We constantly had people playing games together outside wow and hanging out in each others streams to banter and have a good time. Sounds like you just weren't in the right guilds
---
That’s great for you!  Honestly.  And I was in the right guilds until I swapped over to the min/maxer phase I had where I just wanted to ply with the best.  
---
If the guilds you are referring to are also the ones where people are being removed from the group because they aren’t keeping up with dps and the guild isn’t there to help them, then I hate to break it to you, but ‘chill’ is not how they are described.
---
&gt; But why should people feel obliged to try this? Once again different people like different things. Every time I've played in a casual guild on an alt I always end up leaving because apparently not wiping to a normal boss is elitist and dying in the big purple swirlies is a good joke.
---
I’m going to say this one more time, and if you’re too incompetent to get the thought through your head then I’m not wasting my time anymore with you.
---
Did I say they should feel obliged or ‘forced’ into doing this?  
---
I’m saying the people who have never experienced it are missing out and I feel sorry for them for that.  Nowhere in this thought is there a “EVERYONE NEEDS TO DO THIS”.   If you can’t grasp this thought and the difference in what I’m saying and what you think I’m saying then you really need to take some more classes that work on your comprehension skills.
---
&gt; this isn't now though, and we're talking about raiding with these people now. Sure I can understand way back when people didn't have access to learning resources, but now if someone can't find out how to do a 2 button rotation for their class it's honestly really worrying.
---
You do understand that you can still bring back old mentalities into the game right?  You don’t need to act like a twat just because there is less excuses for people to ‘suck’.   Show them the guides, maybe they don’t know how to find them.  Be, you know, a decent human being?  If you hve someone in your guild you like being around and you just drop them out for not pulling the numbers you think they should then you’re just a shitty person.  You can nit pick at that thought all you want about me sounding like that’s how you play, idc.  But that’s just a straight up shitty thing to do.  Sometimes people just need a point in the right direction. 
---
&gt; Boomer alert
---
Lol you’re funny.  Sorry I have a more mature way of looking at this than you do.  Maybe when you are all grown up, have children, a house, a wife/husband, maybe another hobby outside of video gaming.... then maybe you’ll understand that not everyone LIVES and BREATHES video games, but still really enjoys them.

inkarnate.com
---
Kinda fun to play around with, and it's great for making maps for tabletop RPGs.
---
It means threat will be lower and tank damage taken will be higher.
---
Dwarf for PvP, human for PvE. Otherwise whichever you think looks better.
---
It's pople like you that make legimate criticism of World of Warcraft so hard. Your post shows that you just hate every new addition and change that came to the game, even when it didn't affect it negatively. 
---
By the way, Molten Core was the first raid that didn't need an attunement quest and Zul'Gurub was the first catchup raid. Are you hating on Classic now aswell? Would love to hear which dramatic negative impact it had to give both factions access to Paladins and Shamans.
---
If you really think that the BC changes were a major contributor to things like Sharding, Titanforging, the LFR system, watered down leveling etc. you are just wrong.
---
See this comment: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bz5whf/dont_you_guys_have_phones_end_game_edition/eqq85nn/
---
I thought they changed that in patch 1.13, my guild had bwl on farm until that patch when they changed battle shout threat and our warriors could no longer hold aggro on the swarm of dragonkins at the start
---
That Arab guy is orgasming
---
I rerolled on Jaedenar when it first released.  Your description brings back some memories!
---
You're thinking of Sheen of zanza? I don't remember it being used on Hakkar. It was used to cheese Huhuran though.
---
At least until the very last patch of vanilla which fucked my guilds ability to kill nef
---
What about for healing in BGs? It’s stoneform vs perception right?
---
I'm sure people will fail this with a level 60 in their party when classic releases.
---
Of course its not a good idea, but its fun. I remember doing it on my rogue with leatherworking and it added to the fantasy of being able to craft my own armor.
---
I posted the clip as I found it initially, another user gave me the correct source after the fact, I edited my comment but left the link. Cheers!
---
All the retards in this thread discussing if rogue were top in vanilla.
---
You need to understand that vanilla is not the same as classic, not for dps. Vanilla had constant changes with patches, classic will be 1.12 from start to finish. Your vanilla experience of dps in mc/bwl even AQ won't be the same because you were on a different patch. The only reference we have to go on is actually pservers, because at least they are 1.12. On pservers rogues do pretty well. Often beat by warriors early and casters late, but they are always good dps and they are a fun class to dps with. I see no reason why people wouldn't pick rogue on a pve server.
---
Yes?
---
The PvP specced rogue would do 50% more damage than a raid specced ret paladin and the rotation is very simple. A raid specced rogue will do twice the damage of a ret paladin. 
---
The skill gap would have to be extremely large for me to a prefer a ret paladin. and even then I would try to find a semi-competent rogue to replace him with.
---
And then suddenly: anyone who deals spell damage.
---
Same for me. I wonder why so many people started playing after that?
---
How long did that even last? I played during BC and it wasn't like that.
---
I used to fake cast on my shaman with my hearthstone, same animation as their heal
---
The vanilla timeline is going to be ridiculously accelerated. All this previous knowledge will cause a massive surge. 
---
Old school runescape release was like the old game on steroids. Everybody had such a deeper knowledge and skill set compared to the old game.
---
Bill and teds excellent point break adventure
---
I was thinking LW would be the easiest since there's no limit to the resources.
---
I take it troll is optimal?

Try retro wow it's instant level 60 pretty high pop too
---
A year ago I cleared Naxx40 on an undisclosed server. We had Esfand in most of our raids, so we weren't super hardcore but still a solid core of players to carry a couple people.
---
If it weren't for stacking certain classes like paladins, an overabundance of druids for brez, and being fully consumed for hard bosses we wouldn't have made it past AQ40 or half of naxx. It's hard on a private server where a bunch of enthusiasts playing.
---
If you want to clear content, you have to join at least a semi-serious guild. I didn't know of any lax guilds that ever cleared Naxx with more than a few meme-specs. MANY times people were asked to change specs and even characters, and we improved and downed bosses because of it. 
---
If you join a casual guild, be prepared to get stuck on fights where casual players get obliterated - C'thun would be a huge tell.
---
Same, only sacrificing sleep not family time. I'm good on 5-6 hours anyways.
---
Is rep with the pvp factions important in vanilla?
---
Can't get bg ques because of how they separated twinkers from normies
---
It took effort but I remember getting players to flag themselves in low level zones. Requires creative placement of your character or pet or a bunch of low level players thinking they can collectively take on a higher level player.
---
Ty!
---
He just said to keep all options, not to keyboard turn. I don't keyboard turn but keep all my movement keys as is. What makes a good player is knowing when and when not to use the different options available.
---
Do you have a phone
---
Seriously, it was amazing. You needed to know your class. And the dungeons punished u if u didn't.
---
I agree with you I don’t see why not
---
I don't know of any yet.  
---
Keep an eye on for updates of Wholly or Quest Completist. They both do this but not in Retail.
---
Yep. In that case Stoneform might be better 1v1 against a rogue. Seeing a rogue early won't really help, and Stoneform can completely shut them down. Blind immune, Crip poison immune, +armor on a plate wearer to stop burst, e.c.t.
---
The only thing that classic WoW will be missing is the lack of streamers. Much simpler times.
---
Where is Marik's Wife?!
---
Void tank and life drain
---
Only the dailies introduced along sunwell I will agree with you on.  They were the first major catch up, basically require daily grind to have happened.  
---
I don't share the same feelings on flying though.  Flying in outlands was alright because it had purpose in the world itself.  You still have to ride around everywhere in azeroth, and the same could be sai about northrend.  Don't ask me why they changed this with cata.  
---
You didn't really 'have' to do blades edge or terrokar dailies, nor did you 'need' to get a netherdrake.  They were a source of income (and a crappy one at that I might add) with some side benefits/long term goals. 
---
I am assuming they screwed the pooch in the end due to knowing what they were going to be doing in wrath.  Likely didn't want the true daily shock value to be 'too' strong.
---
damn filler race

To make it worse, the people in weak specs are most clueless. Its very rare to see an amazing player handicapping himself.

---
fuck you are right. 11 weeks is fuck all.
---
I don't know where you're playing, but anyone who earns that rank 13 set tends to actually wear it. The Druid set in particular might be the best set out of all of the class sets. Gloves especially.
---
I remember a guy ganking me repeatedly in BB. Undead. Breath is 4x. He can swim away and kite me in the water. The racials added depth.
---
Apples to oranges. We're talking about unconventional specs and how they're fun. I was just describing one way in which it is hilariously unexpected.
---
I'd like logs from a relevant paladin doing 50% less than sub rogue across the board. 
---
As it stands there's only 2 or 3 DPS paladins worth their salt on private servers, using the correct DPS build. There is no full clear, but every one worth their salt is about 100-150 dps behind rogues in comperable guilds, while beating Priest, Druid, Hunter, and all non-ignite mage. 
---
Show me Naxx logs comparing a rogue with similar clear times to Mourtagh, on one of Mourtagh's prepared pulls. The new build worth running was developed months ago, there isn't a huge amount of exposure, but it's there.
---
Do your research. The math is on my side on this one. Or do you need me to spoonfeed you the rankings for Naxx fights?

 **&lt;Private Server Athletes&gt;** | NA-PvP | Alliance | West Coast / Late night 
---
 **Raid Schedule:** 
---
Tues &amp; Thur, 7:30pm – 11pm PST Additional raid day Sun only as needed to finish clearing content.  
---
**About us:** 
---
The core of our guild is formed of friends who have been playing together across multiple private servers for years. We have fully cleared through Naxx several times including in original retail prior to TBC release. In addition to extensive PVE and PVP experience within classic, many players have also cleared later content and expansions. Our guild members all average more than a decade of wow experience.  We pride ourselves on clearing content efficiently while maintaining fun raid environment.
---
**Loot:**   
---
We will utilize an open Loot Council system. Attendance, performance and overall guild contribution are taken into account. The officers will take input from a rotating roster of raiders to ensure all members feel a part of the system.    
---
 **What we are looking for:**   
---
• All classes and specs to fill out our core. We expect you to know your class.   
---
• We seek new members to enhance our community. Players should enjoy the time we spend playing together in raids, pvp or just messing around in chat.   
---
• Membership is not limited to players with private server experience. The majority of our players come from this base and we our prefer players to have recent experience with vanilla content.   
---
• Be able to maintain an attendance level of 90%.  
---
• Reach 60 and start farming pre-raid items within 3 weeks.  Much of our core is taking 2+ weeks vacation from our jobs in celebration of classic release.

What’s the context behind this photo? Wtf are they actually touching?
---
But the event on private servers has obscenely broken timers as well as the fact once hakkar is summoned you can pretty much 2-man it
---
I ran with a group of twinks in Vanilla. We all played gnome warlocks named Epic Fail. But we all varied the spelling slightly. I was EpicFell. It was always hysterical to imagine the other side saying:
---
Get the Gnome Lock. 
---
Which one ? 
---
Epic Fail. 
---
Which one ?
---
&gt;Gloves especially
---
Alright man you trolled me good. Well played.
---
Sorry, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bz0yom/looking_for_group_monday_updated_june_10_2019/eqqcd9b/) is a current comment. I fixed the issue so it will not occur next week.
---
Prepare for a long slog.
---
Easy with the compliments there, sunshine :)
---
In the true spirit of classic, we must use ctprofiles.net and put it in our forum signature.

RAZORGORE ALL NIGHT!

I see that argument so often on here I dont think people understand how fearward works or they have the TBC fearward in mind. Feardward is a 10 minutes buff which can be rebuffed after 30 sec so a single dwarf priest can fearward 20 targets befor the frist one runs out . So you can fearward an entire raid with a view dwarfs and continue to do so during combat. Which for example is great for rogues because you dodge entire boss mechanics and they never have to stop DPS. The diffrents between a raid fearwarding properly and a raid which doesnt is big. They probably clear twice as fast.
---
Guy tries hard karma whoring, guy still doesn't get the points he yarns for. ILLUMINATI CONFORMED!
---
I don’t know. I would disagree with that mostly.
---
2020 a big year for games, 2019 year for movies.
---
FF7 remake baby :) me too
---
im pretty sure you just spam hamstring, as its the most rage efficient and quickest way to level up weapon skills.
---
Only if you want the gear/consumes.
---
You got 3 months to learn to make add-ons.. Good luck.
---
Exactly. Once players begin to hit 60 IF becomes more popular due to proximity to blackrock mountain.
---
Pre-battlemaster BGs existed for a month, and Barrens chat was already a thing long before that.
---
Apples to oranges. We're talking about unconventional specs and how they're fun. I was just describing *one* way in which it is hilariously unexpected. In retort, however, you'd be surprised at how many casters didn't know a warrior can silence them every 6 seconds. No one usually takes that talent. Improved Shield Bash silences and is spammable.
---
Looks like he played to his strengths :)
---
Just in  the opening shot, I can count at least 15 dragonstalker shoulders. So late into Naxx, those hunters have been killing BWL enough to have shoulders and most should have their tier set by now, as hunter competition is pretty low tier wise. 
---
But it happens again at 2:46//2:48 right as Rag dies, so you're probably right. I looked through every spell effect with that icon and there's nothing else in 'nilla it could've been unless its a tank weapon debuff I don't know about.
---
Troll&gt;Orc&gt;Tauren&gt;Undead
---
All are viable. Unless your guild is unreal Min-Max you will be fine.
---
Hunter and Mage are the gods of solo farming, nothing else comes close.
---
No I was just stirring you for spelling ‘source’ as ‘sauce’.
---
Made me hungry.
---
20% is pretty normal for MMOs.
---
In original vanilla, less than 20% of players stuck around and there was much less competition.
---
Don't want to preach here or anything but... https://youtu.be/5MuIMqhT8DM
---
How is it not common sense to want to have server types that were available in Vanilla be included in Classic? At least one server, ffs.
---
Alright, but you really only needed to do the sunwell daily crap, which was near the end of the expansion anyway.  It was stupid, I agree, but you absolutely did not need to get blades edge, terrorkar or even your aldor/scryer rep to exalted like you needed to get reps in wrath or beyond to exalted.  
---
The biggest sin TBC committed was devaluing raid content (the T5 massive nerf and attunement nukes) after T6 launched, and having too strong of a catch up mechanic with the sunwell dailies.  
---
Other than that, they had ZA for catch up, but you still needed t4 gear (if you weren't carried) to complete it and typically had gear that only replaced 2-3 slots for most specs if you weren't in T5 quality gear already.
---
leveling a warrior fast is all about taking on green mobs and green quests and minimizing downtime.  If you aren't undead, then the bandaging skill is required
---
Oh that's awesome! I'm excited to hear from you!
---
They are very decent healers and tanks, even in Naxx. Druids are in some cases like Patchwerk inarguably better off-tanks than warriors.
---
But their fans aren't.
---
34 hunters, of which at most 5-6 are wearing full T2. Looks at the credits in the later part of the video, most of them aren't wearing T2.
---
Troll for threat, Tauren for Stam are the best imo.
---
Though I would say play whatever you like. It’s not that big of a deal.
---
No, sorry, that doesn't mean it's harder at all times. The game isn't simply pulling mobs and killing them, at least for me. I'm sorry if you can't pull a few mobs and survive, maybe get some better gear by crafting or running dungeons, ya know, investing more time.
---
Invest more time so you can do things more efficiently.
---
Yea, but they were all optional apart from the stupidly rewarding sunwell dailies which happened near the end of the expansion.
---
not many people ninja loot on retail any more.  not worth it at all while leveling.
---
I mean yeah undead kinda sucks compared to the other racials but it's not that big a deal. You clearly aren't one that cares that much about minmaxing and that's completely fine you can clear stuff easily without, and you will probably surround yourself with players of a similar attitude(at least you should, makes making friends easier), so they won't have a problem with it either.
---
This is absolutely true. Not running with a meme spec is almost a litmus test for basic competence. Sure there's exceptions few and far between, but why bother risking the drama of inviting then booting some noob when there's a bench of rogues and mages all ready to go.
---
Our guild had a feral druid tank in classic retail wow, the way it worked the druid had huge HP pool, i think it was like 25k or something fully buffed, nearing 30k.
---
When the boss hit the druid, the bear took large damage, but it was contant flat damage, that includes crit/crushing blows, spiked damage...
---
Druid was able to survive that becouse of high HP pool.
---
The way it worked on warriors, when the warrior took a spiked damage, multi crit/crashing, he was near death, this is why we had 2 warriors, incase 1 went down.
---
Its what I remember anyways...
---
Well everyone has self healing abilities now, so bandages are much less important.
---
I remember how fear ward worked. Do you need it to clear content? No. Horde can clear content without it. Does it make clearing raids faster? Yeah. So what? Like I said, planned guilds will have more dwarf priests.
---
For how early you get it its really good. You also get it guaranteed to 50% so you get is fast.
---
Might be the first doom game I pick up. Never tried it before but this trailer looks interesting
---
The Orb of Command.
---
"steal"
---
The problem is that TBC had a problematic series of dailies at the end of the expansion that were basically required to do.  
---
Terrokar, blades edge, and aldo/scryer were not required in the sense that you miss out on something absolutely necessary.  It wasn't until wrath that dailies became a chore that HAD to be done from the beginning.
---
I have no idea haha it was so long ago. I think it was something relatively simple like a rogue tanking a TBC dungeon. I was just a kid and hadn't seen anything like that (was level 50ish when TBC released).
---
Dickhead.
---
The vast majority of WoW guides contain major errors. Find a warrior that knows their shit. Listen to them. Don’t question them until you catch up with them.
---
Recommending prot talents for leveling is in practically all cases god awful advise.
---
On top of that, the zones are set up so you don't move much. Enemies are right next to the quest giver and zones are either very linear or just fly you around.
---
Wait what dagger? Is some dick walking around with something better than my gutripper? I need it to get this dagger!
---
Either way they would need to increase level cap to avoid massive power creep.  
---
Who is to say this new team can even pull off anything close to what the devs did in TBC?
---
thanks for your input booboo the clown
---
Even that one contains a few wrong conclusions but Mn indeed knows his shit and what I am referring to are details. They were talking for like 2 hours and he cleared up some big misconceptions from a bis list that was heavily flawed.
---
How many hearthstone casts?
---
It's only detrimental if you play Male undead
---
Warrior is most fun in group play, you control the pace.
---
Fuuuck it's better than my epic lvl 40 dagger...
---
^^^ if youre tryharding and not troll or orc youre not gunna make hardcore rosters
---
Not really true. Here's a DW Warrior from 1.9 tanking ZG:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ql-KCBkVOSI&amp;feature=youtu.be
---
I remember our MT was some Fury/Prot hybrid and went through most of BWL progression DW tanking bosses. Specifically I remember him popping Death Wish for Nefarian fears when we didn't have Fear Ward in the raid. I think the first time he actually went deep Prot was Naxxramas.
---
With Healers and Tanks both being better this time around, including more consumable-oriented, I don't really see it being a huge deal.
---
Because it’s way more fun - it’s as simple as that lol
---
Amazing.  I would legit use this to fish while I poop.
---
They aren't better at healing or tanking tho. In very rare cases they are as good or maybe a tiny bit better. My whole point is that they are better at flag running than any other class.
---
You are right in absolutely everything and the other person is acting like a huge tool. But a small FYI “appeal to authority” is how we refer to one of the many logical fallacies. Not sure if you are trying to say that the other person is committing that fallacy or that they should listen to consensus.
---
It is very clear they never played a WW warrior with SS.
---
I think people lose their minds when they see people not look at the entire picture. 
---
So many people claiming dailies were required to do, but it wasn't until the end of the expansion with sunwell that they made the decision to essentially force us to do those retarded dailies at that location or fall behind.  
---
Everything else for 4/5 of the expansion was completely and utterly optional.  Did you want a consistent way to make money that wasn't anywhere near the most optimal?  Do blades edge/terrokar dailies.  Want a netherdrake which is not faster than a normal fast gryphon?  Then do netherwing dailies.  Want 1-2 good starting, pre raid pieces of gear that only a few classes even got to use anyway?  Then do your aldor or scryer if you don't plan on raiding t4 content.  
---
The bottom line is that a lot of people have a blast playing the expansion, and no one even fathomed really 'quitting' like they did in wrath when they brought in daily chores that were required to get to exalted or miss out on a lot of stat bonuses.
---
Season 3 didn't even started until T6 was released for 6 month. So you could be completely T6 geared in Season 2 and shit on players who didn't raid. In fact, Season 2 not even started when BT was released. But that seems like the way you want it to be?
---
Also, ignoring that Season 3 came much later than BT, tell me the Season 3 items that were better in PvE than T6 items besides weapons (which weren't much better than T6 weapons) for some classes.
---
By the way, Season 3 introduced rating requierments. These weren't hard to reach for good players (neither was raiding for good players) but not every casual could reach it. It also took a long time to get the Arena Points needed for PvP gear (especially weapons) with a low rating. So it definitely weren't 'free epic weapons' for casuals.
---
The fact is that PvE players always had a gear advantage and that never changed through WoWs history.
---
Correct the 30 cap and 40 cap metas are seriously different than any WoW I've ever played. 50 cap is a lot of levelling but still excited for it
---
Less people will play druid, it’ll be easier. Paladin is likely going to be 2nd or third most played
---
Thanks a lot for this answer. I'm not too concerned with min maxing since some friends that I will be playing with won't be that concerned about it. However, I do consider myself skilled and competitive when it comes to gaming and was wondering how big of a difference the racials would make in the long run.
---
ARCANITE REAPER HOOOOO
---
Paladin definitely is more popular, but do you think a lot of those people are going to be Esfand 2.0's who want prove the viability of specs like ret and prot? I wonder how many will actually want to heal. I didn't actually play classic so my knowledge of what people like playing might be wrong but it seems like the majority of people are averse to playing a healer.
---
Thanks for the post mate but I'm Horde all the way. ❤️ Good luck!
---
Defense gear makes warriors uncrittable.  Shield block pushes crushing blows off the table.
---
Druids do have a much bigger health pool though, so you got that part right.
---
prot is secretly the best way  to level pally, 2hnd/ret is one of the hardests
---
Define casual and define hardcore.  
---
There were a number of different guild types that raided different amounts of days and different hours per day.  
---
I would say someone who raids 4-5 days a week for 4-5 hours a day is hardcore, but a guy who raids 1-2 days a week for 2.5-3 hours each day is more casual.  But then there are guild that raid 3 days a week and spend 3-4 hours that can get way more done than the previous, but much less than hardcore.
---
Bit of a flawed poll due to lack of proper options.
---
Hey there, I'd like to do this with the latest version of the map as you didn't update it yet, can you explain me really quickly how I do it?
---
i'm ya shootah
---
Ironforge is empty.
---
Frankly druid healers can be competitive if there is just one per raid. I have seen a few do insane thing in the past. Keep in mind they tend to have a huge advantage when it comes to gearing.
---
I admit my opinion is a bit controversial though. And they will still be 20% or so behind priests on Sapphiron.
---
Not trying to turn this into an argument, though.
---
Til
---
Considering most people group raid guilds into casual, semi casual, semi serious, serious, and hardcore.  I completely agree with you.  
---
Someone might be semi serious, but that is way more dedication and play time than a casual guild, but much less than hardcore.  Easily should be a middle ground option.
---
It's funny before the cap went up STV was an absolute bloodbath. A different streamer was attacking Duskwood every night, and hillsbrad was a war zone. 
---
Once it went up horde got super friendly for a bit. In a week once everyone is mostly BIS things are gonna get nasty again. 
---
Also in case you know me hi it's Carebearz
---
I just tested this on the beta using a lvl 4 druid with moonfire and rejuv and a 2.90 staff as the melee weapon.
---
It would seem both moonfire and rejuv are resetting the swing timer.
---
If you approach a mob with auto-attack enabled you will immediately attack upon entering melee range but if you use any spell right before you have to wait the full 2.90 seconds.
---
continuously casting rejuv/moonfire before the 2.90 swing timer completes results in you never auto-attacking.
---
I submitted a bug report in-game for it because I don't know if this is intended or not but I can confirm it's currently working this way in the classic beta.
---
Is it worse being a decent tank with a bad healer or being a good healer with a bad tank?
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bywrtf/the_hunter_power_loss_after_t2_how_big_is_it/eqmvruy/

I replied this on a post earlier today :). People downvote and still think hunter = garbage in BWL and lock reign supreme.
---
Blizzard said each layer would be about equal to the population of a vanilla server, which roughly corresponds to a couple, few thousands
---
Well, Horde has Shamans to take care of the fears
---
Standing on a trap usually did the trick for me. A late game respec to survival with entangling roots made fighting rogues extra hilarious
---
Stay terrifiee, it is illegal to sell virtual accounts.
---
I'd really suggest watching the vod and following what they did.
---
classic will be braindead easy  
---
only turbo autists will sacrifice enjoyment for minmaxing something they can play half asleep  
---
play what you like
---
Dude, it's amazing the love you guys put on vanilla WoW back in the days.
---
Download team viewer to your phone and pc. You don’t even need to install it on your computer, it will just run. Use it all the time to manage my server at home from my phone at work. My brother uses it to grind and play AH and junk on all kinds of games (and is the one that introduced me to it).
---
I definitely will luckily I have some friends on beta hardcore enough to do this with me
---
There is a limit on sticky posts, and I really don't think this would be all that important compared to some other things.  
---
They already have this in the faq, and that makes sense.  
---
You could always take it upon yourself to spread the word on the official forums, this subreddit, and anywhere else (youtube comments, whatever) that is relevant to classic WoW around the time of release.
---
No love for ctrl as a modifier?
---
You are probably right, all of my exposure to this stuff is through this subreddit, really. I've kind of been wanting to roll a druid healer although something tells me there will be more of them this time around. I've also heard people saying that players will often deny resto druids for dungeons because they dont have a res. I don't know if that's true or not though
---
Looking for a casual guild who's main raid time is Sunday evenings.  I have experience with vanilla, TBC, WOLK, and cata.  Did some raiding but never hardcore.  Always played tank or healer, but I'm very flexible.  I enjoy professions a lot and will happily contribute to the guild bank.
---
Keep in mind there will be people in Classic, maybe even in your guild, who are keen to play Diablo Mobile. Not all players have improved.
---
God damn though, that was real wasn't it? That's the FIRST BOSS and it was epic as hell. Super hype.
---
I'm going to actively utilise the Mage "vanish blink"
---
I remember my guild having 5 druid healers, 1 druid OT, 8 rogues, a ret Pally and 4 warriors as core raiders and we got all the way to AQ40. It was tough, but we still did it. Idk why people are so stressed about everything needing to be optimised when people who had no idea about optimisation were able to do so much. :/
---
Yeah that was awesome! Used to do it at lumber mill and cast chain lightning because the ground didn't cause LoS from that direction but they couldn't attack you. Sadly it was definitely patched by 1.12.
---
I like to play the bad guys so I'm alliance
---
Ideally I would like to listen to them as I'm running somehwere so it's not only heard from the npc, but from quest log. This way we can listen at our own leisure.
---
Avoid all streamers at all costs. Find a Pvp server in my time zone and closest geologically to me, make sure all my friends agree on the same server, roll on that server.
---
Was a fun run.  I was pretty happy we managed to finish it.  I think a holy paladin would have done my job far, far better though.
---
Shadow priests see some fairly viable play in raids as a a one off for Shadow Weaving, to buff the warlocks. Their main weakness though, similar to Elemental shamans and Moonkin, is that they have mana issues. This means while their ability to do dungeons and PvP is great, they hit a roadblock on longer raid fights, where they run dry and their DPS drops off a cliff.
---
Rogue will be better for new players that are interested in PvP because they pick and choos when they want to engage in combat. As for the glowing swords those are just enchants that have been applied to the weapon.
---
100% this
---
Awesome. It would be a nightmare to pug. I hope you get it.
---
is there not supposed to be some app that adds buttons on your screen which you can map?  
---
controlled d-pad mapped as wasd  
---
moonlight has something like that but i never got it to work
---
Enjoy your ban :)
---
Rogues were top on many AQ40 and naxx40 fights.  They did not have the potential to beat out warriors on a fight where aggro doesn't matter as much, but there were tons of instances where we had to throttle back our DPS because of aggro problems where rogues did not.
---
Finally i meet this legends.
---
ok checked it out.  un buffed you had around 4.5k.  that sounds better :)
---
You are blinded by private servers so hard lol...
---
When aggro in raids is an issue, the rogues wont be holding back while warriors will absolutely have to.
---
Oh for sure and you still get EXP while grinding.
---
You did great. A couple times rezzes would have been nice but this was more about you guys sticking in there and figuring it out :P
---
When it came to fights where threat is a problem, rogues win hands down.  Fury warriors had to throttle back a lot.
---
I seriously am not trying to rain on anyone’s parade here. But hearing folks talk about trying to rush through classic reminds me of retail where the end result was the goal and not the journey. One of the things I’m most looking forward to is the leveling and journey of classic. That was some of the best times
---
Of my life and I’m hoping to recapture that.
---
Rogues were not capable of the most DPS.
---
They were capable of doing the most damage in a fight though... rogues had no threat issues where as warriors did. 
---
Too many people are completely blinded by pserver metas, and will be in for a bit of a shock when they are reminded what threat is.
---
Wait show me the logs where you're in shitty gear doing those kind of numbers, the top MC and BWL Feral logs are all in AQ and Naxx gear.
---
Well warrior rogue duo level isn't optimal
---
Dw guilds always need tranq shot...until they don't
---
Same idea, uses more mana but does more damage.  You can't earthbind kite over a long distance because of the cooldown of EB, you have to kind of run around in a circle within the totem's radius to do it right.  And it's a pretty small totem radius.
---
Because you have a bunch of people basing their opinions on pservers where threat is hardly an issue in the end game.  Fury warriors hardly have to throttle back on pservers (we now know likely due to the parry differences) because MTs are essentially macro spamming dual wield switches when close to or at full hp and rarely get parried.  
---
People will be reminded.
---
I fully acknowledge that PS4 is the superior system...but I only buy Xbox...master chief for life.
---
So you're not going to provide a source for ret doing more dps than feral? okay
---
Besides aesthetics, the only reason to go UD warrior is to make leveling slightly easier with cannibalize. The other races are just so much better for both tank and dps
---
Power shifting feral with proper consumables is a mid tier dps class. If you know what you’re doing, they’re acceptable dps, good tanks and the best decursers all in the same spec.
---
Turn that smile upside down and this is my life right now
---
I feel like tanking is the role most capable of picking up other's slack and least able to have their own slack picked up by others, although that might be because I'm a kinda mediocre healer.
---
huh  
---
classes in modern wow are harder to play than anything classic has, tenfold
---
Why would you ever roll fire pre-AQ though? Frost is the best pvp spec and the best farming spec.
---
No, I'm asking you where your bullshit numbers are coming from, because we clearly aren't looking at the same druid parses if you think the 1k+ pulls are done in MC-BWL gear. If we dont agree on Druid DPS, how can I link logs that back up my point. 
---
Link me logs where a MC geared druid is doing 1k on a fight that isn't a gimmick with some kind of DPS buff.
---
Spriest is a support class there for shadow weaving. Their raid dps buff to the warlocks is enough to warrant 1 on the team. But yes, their personal dps is much lower than mages or warlocks.
---
delete this
---
Omg shut up with this world first garbage. These fights have been well know for years. They aren’t new encounters requiring learning the strat from scratch.
---
Man it'll be tons of fun when after I hit 20 and reach 240 engineering on my gnome warlock and a 26 horde rogue thinks I'm easy pickings just to eat a death ray lol
---
I'm pretty certain that the highest savings to income ratio my bank account has ever seen was during the years I was living at home playing wow 16 - 20 hours a day and occasionally going out for my part-time retail job.
---
what class is easier to play (PvP): Rogue or Warrior?
---
Oh cool. I'd never seen that before. It is pretty fun to play around with =)
---
LOL, I'm making a prediction, not a life statement. Sorry kid....
---
Then why bother answering a question about doing just that? Lol
---
Have you ever thought that these players get enjoyment out of min-maxing? It might not be for you but why put down someone else because of the way they enjoy to play? LOL
---
Final Fantasy 7 Renake presentation knocked it out of the park. The combat was absolutely amazing. Going to be hard juggling playing that and raiding in Classic come March.
---
No ones gunna care that much, dungeons are super easy, people will have engi rez. You can always easily make your own group as a healer.
---
Quiver shows in all of these, so you clearly didn't research it well either.

---
There are many fights where an equally geared fury warrior can't go all out, but a rogue always can.  
---
Pserver meta is not going to be vanilla/classic meta in every regard.  Especially if it turns out bosses hit too hard for MTs to dual wield macro switch like they do on pservers.
---
Stream arent always the best at a game most of them only just hit at the bottom of r1 when alot of other players keep going so i wouldnt realy rely on streamers for best skilled pvpers, just a heads up
---
Rogue
---
Uh I'm pretty sure I dont need the devil's lettuce to see the van cleef zone it's pretty obvious
---
Don't buy items on the auction unless necessary. Save 100g till lvl 40 for your first mount
---
Paladins will be much better. There's a lot of fights where you ideally want 8 pallies in the raid so you can resist aura each group. Considering you want all of them to be holy, and that priests are more useful than druids- that doesn't leave a whole lot of room for druids.
---
Night Elf MOHAWK.  
---
   
---
We had a really bad Blizzard in late 2009. My roommates had gone and stayed with other friends. I was home alone and snowed in. I saw that Night Elf Mohawk, Mr T, commercial and it reminded me that I had a WoW free trial disk somewhere.    
---
I found it, loaded the game up, made a Dwarf Paladin, and have been hooked ever since!     
---
    
---
I’m super stoked for Classic, since I didn’t play then. I was all about City of Heroes, from 2004-2009.
---
They need to redirect all their customer service resources to banning people who play the wrong character in Overwatch.
---
Rogue probably, warrior takes more to master but rogue is up there too
---
why is that? rotation? warrior too gear dependent? Rogue is better soloing? picking his own fights etc?
---
I hope to be there too
---
sure they do  
---
I hope they remember that enjoyment the next time they pick some race they loathe because it does 2% more dps compared to their favorite
---
Both are easy to pick up but difficult to master due to how you handle their limitations. But rogue is considered easier because if you’ve got all your cool downs there’s not much other people can do.
---
keep reading the comments, then come back to this one
---
Damn, that makes things kinda difficult. I wonder if it depends on class because a warrior's Mortal Strike is considered an instant cast spell but it doesn't reset the swing timer.
---
On private servers, yea. 
---
Rogues top a lot of fights in naxx40 due to aggro not being an issue.  Mages and locks will be forced to move around a lot on many fights and can't possibly keep up all the time.

Warriors have to throttle back on a lot of fights as well.  On fights where throttling is not necessary, then fury wins.  On patchwerk?  Fury is top, then rogue.  I am honestly surprised people are even debating this so hard.  Only the last couple fights in naxx really let mages shine, and that is because melee will have a lot more downtime.
---
Exactly, if I play 18 hours on launch, but take my time doing the quests instead of speedrunning I'd still consider it a rather casual playstyle than hardcore. I don't really think casual/hardcore is based on time investment, but rather on how you spend the time you invest.
---
That dagger has more DPS than the Whirlwind Axe! Holly shit!
---
Depends on the type of guild and what they may or may not need.  
---
A lot of semi serious guilds (like 3 day raiding guilds at around 3 hours each day~) might fit in a couple random specs here and there if they have enough good players to carry, but the more serious and hardcore guilds are going to be more picky when they just want to push hard.
---
Warrior is very gear dependent in pvp, has way less escape, less choice in engage, less cc. Rogue gives you a few key crutches with vanish, evasion, posions. The rotation is straight forward and positional if youre dagger spec
---
They don’t get that on a paladin but they do get uber swag.
---
Yeah you're straight up full of shit. The only MC and BWL pulls with over 1k dps last less than 30 seconds and they're all done in full AQ40 and Naxx gear. Select druid, and start on Lucifron in the boss selection dropdown. [https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Ranking/Default.aspx](https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Ranking/Default.aspx)

I really want to play.  I’ve never had an addiction to anything with the exception of WoW.  As sad as it makes me, I think I’m going to have to pass on Classic.  Recently divorced, so if I jump back into it I’ll forsake the gym and won’t make new IRL connections.

Sad times.

I will probably look at whatever PvP server is the 2nd one below the first PvP realm in the default sorting list.

Did you test if you can put keys in it? From what I've seen on streams, keys don't automatically go in the keyring like they're supposed to. I suspect they just haven't implemented it yet.

Verigan’s Fist!!! I’m hyped as hell for Classic and that nostalgia just knocked me on my tuckus.
---
WoW kind of released with a ton of serious players who dropped ship from EQ to begin with.  WoW raiding and dungeon running was considered casual when the game first hit for quite a long time, and people were constantly trying to improve their performance.  
---
The only difference was that it took time to build up that knowledge, and now we have that knowledge.  People are going to make life as easy as possible, and that is just the way of things.  There are always exceptions, however.
---
Of *course* I'm using the word 'grief' that's because you keep implying that PVP in-all-its-forms it perfectly fine and a *great* part of the game.
---
I'm not here to diagnose "what is griefing vs what is playing the game" However, you certainly appear to, most likely because you think killing players 20 levels below you is somehow honorable and takes great skill &lt;chuckle&gt;
---
You're exactly the reason why I'm choosing to play PVE and you know what? I'm going to have a GREAT time. Good luck killing lowbies, you clearly think it's awesome.
---
Your post makes zero sense. Tell me about all the PvP items that were better than PvE items besides weapons for some classes (and they weren't much stronger than PvE weapons).
---
You could deck yourself in the Gladiator set but it took very long to get it without a high rating, had a rating requierment and was much worse than the Tier sets. 
---
A DPS in full PvP did much less damage than a PvE geared DPS in a PvE fight.
---
I never played on a private servers. Let's put damage aside when I used to lead raids the only thing that mattered was getting enough healers. Rogues were the very last on my list of invites. Let's be honest rogues bring nothing to the raid.
---
That beeing said I was playing a warlock and this time I'm playing a rogue. It's revenge, I can't wait to world PvP. We cleared the content 13 years ago. There's no point in trying to be top whatever. It's already been done.
---
It's him, the original goblin. The gobfather

I think he's trying to be funny
---
Path of Exile. Only other game that draws me in hard. Once every 3 months when it releases a new league (season) I actually play a game hard for about a month and it feels great. Then there’s a 2 month gap where I just want to play Classic..

I think the proc rate is broken I only procced wound 5 times in a full BFD run tonight :(
---
Frost mages are very fun at PvP. Don't pick your class based on which people say is "easier." You'll get good at whatever class you choose while leveling 1-60.  Can't go wrong with either though.  Basically do you want to be a versatile spell caster or a stealthy fast melee character.
---
Is it easy to enchant something?
---
Also if an issue has a PvP solution then that's not Blizzards problem.
---
You know you can play Halo Infinite on PC right?
---
Priests are the best premade healers.
---
Im still waiting for reclaimation of my original account.  Which was a original naxx through new naxx raiding warrior and warlock.  They helped me get my other two accounts back but not the oldest and main account.  Its been two days since last ticket response on that one and I am starting to get concerned my luck might have run out at 2 of 3.  At first I was super excited to get it back as it had a lot of special mounts that I assumed no one would have.  I assumed wrong when I logged in and seen they re-released several of my rare mounts in later xpacks.  Quiet literally spitting in my face.  Like the Plagued Proto Drake...  this alone pissed me off to no end after how rare this was back then...
---
Melee abilities aren't considered spells IIRC.
---
How long does it usually take to get from 1-60 because perhaps I could make both and then by 60 or maybe before I could tell which I prefer?
---
Who do you enjoy killing more, clothies or melee?
---
If you're a Rogue you'll probably spend a lot of time in stealth waiting for a poor Priest to run near you.
---
As a Mage, you'll have Rogues running from you.
---
I just can't get over that they're doing the episodic thing. Such a buzzkill and money grab.
---
You're paying $60 for an incomplete game, and then you have to pay for FUTURE games (Not just DLC) This is a Midgar game.
---
"Basically, the game shipping in March is two discs - but both discs form the 'Midgar' story section from the original game, heavily expanded. The story will continue in future game(s)."
---
Imagine if you end up paying $120 or more for the full experience. It reeks of KH3 which is a subpar game in the KH series and feels all "Nomura"-like with the episodes.
---
Oh... I really didn't want that to be clarified thanks.
---
&gt;  shadow priest will do about half the DPS of a mage
---
Bullshit. Shadow priests will do relatively the same, if not more dps as mages. The problem is that once they go oom they drop to just wanding, but mana is the problem, not damage
---
If you're serious about pvp there's going to be one server where all the best players are on and you probably should wait a couple of days to make sure you roll on that one. Same thing as tbc, if it's not on bg9 it doesn't count for shit.
---
That's what I get for going on reddit at 4:30 in the morning, sorry!
---
And yeah, getting frustarted that people spout things at fact without looking it up first.
---
This is also a good example of quivers:  https://youtu.be/xRXqNTZFgX8?t=252
---
Can you not get a mount at level 20?
---
Yes, but deep wounds still knocks off effects if there are enough of them.  While it is a low priority debuff, too many will see the dropping of many others, which will require them to be recast much earlier.  
---
Not saying it really matters 'that' much at the end of the day, but that is how it is.
---
Did you honestly raid in vanilla?
---
Alot of carebear boomers in this thread haHAA
---
Dueling doesn't flag you for PvP does it?
---
I don't enjoy ganking, but i do understand it's place in the ecosystem of world PvP. It helps build that faction hatred that leads to things like city and town raids, it forms bonds from you reaching out to get others to help you, makes guilds that much more important whilst leveling and creates content in the form of you making hunting parties to go and find those people terrorizing your faction.
---
It's also not a false bias to state that vanilla had that mindset, PvP servers were something you endured and everyone else did too, barely anyone one made it to 60 on a high pop PvP server with the same care free attitude towards the other faction that you get on PvE servers.
---
If you're going to roll PvP in vanilla you should know that, there's a content gap in which PvPers have literally no way of earning honor outside of farming you and it's more efficient for them to kill you at 48+ or w/e the cap is for a 60 than at 60, so you'll be farmed non-stop if you're behind and that's simply how launch was for us.
---
Why would he get banned?
---
Your character is named like a stripper.
---
Remember when the Savory Deviate Delight had a low drop rate? I spent HOURS farming that thing.
---
Yes, but deep wounds will still take one of the 16 (multiple will take even more).
---
Casual.  You obviously haven't practiced the SSS challenge.  How are you ever going to hit 60 in a week?
---
Hey OP, your petition finally has enough people for a raid team. Rofl.
---
No, but it stays for a while after the bg or if you sacrifice yourself or the pet to flag a few people
---
Ya buddy, I'm sure they will... You got em
---
Isn't Azeroth just the part in the lower right?
---
lol yes I know. I don't think you understand my joke. Most druids just shapeshift and run. So it made me laugh when every low health druid shapeshifting and running from me flashed into my mind all at the same time, accompanied by them yelling, "IM KITING YOU!."
---
It's a long (but fun) grind. For a newish player it'll probably take like 240 hours to level 1-60. So however long it takes you to do that.
---
You don't have to wait to lvl 60 to pvp though. You usually have a good general feel for how a class plays by lvl 20-30, which doesn't take too long. So you can make both and make your decision earlier
---
Which game did you play? Which PvP parts where better than PvE parts besides weapons for some classes? I feel sorry for your guild if you really raidet in full PvP gear.
---
You are going to get absolutely wrecked pre 40 most of the time if against a competent player of almost any other class/spec.
---
But where's mankriks wife?
---
It comes down to Pally buffs vs Druid utility (brez, tranq, innervate).
---
Both are valuable.  Pallys are wanted because you need a lot for all their different buffs.  On the other hand you can never have too many brez or innervate.  I

It comes down to how much you like being a buffbot.

It's there, it's the weird little island off the tip of Tanaris.

What people don't realize is barrens chat evolved and took on a life of it's own...it is now called Reddit 😃

Yeah I'm sure all the rogues will have fun seeing their important upgrades be 1/3 as effective on a feral instead
---
Thanks for reminding me!
---
Not exactly weapon swing timers, but have you considered adding resource bars. Rogue energy tick and caster 5 second rule trackers would be pretty handy.

Do you like playing on it?

Yes.  And got walled at multiple points on healing/dps checks before 2.0.

FYI you break shadowmeld when you begin casting Aimed Shot now. They changed that part-way through vanilla. The ones that got to experience those glory days are lucky.

Tanking on vanilla is the easiest it has ever been to date.  Yes, modern WoW made aggro not an issue, but you still are required to spam more buttons and move out of more crap constantly. 
---
Your main rotation is so small in 5 mans due to a lack of rage.  Eventually (and quite early) players learn that warriors have limits, especially in pugs with no coordination.  Even if you watch streams of some good players tanking in those 5 mans, they constantly lose aggro, or DPS picks the wrong target to go all out on.. and there is nothing that can be done. 
---
Bottom line is that anxiety really only becomes a factor in TBC imo, where the difference between a skilled tank and a new one is so vast, that people will purposely avoid you by name if they had a single, bad experience.
---
Why troll?
---
Blizz confirmed it officially and confirmed it's in the beta
---
If this is the case then it might be easier to compile a list of spells that don't reset the swing timer.
---
Rule #2.
---
2.0 talents with dual windfury procs we're pretty hawt.
---
They fixed it pretty quick though
---
I dont really hate PS, but ive just never understood why PS players are SO damn confident in everything based on their PS experience.
---
It was always known the PS were guesswork.  WoW just has too many interworking variables to think that all those guesses are going to be even close to accurate.  Yet PS players are convinced beyond doubt that every tank in Vanilla is gonna be a DW Fury or a feral druid or an effing WARLOCK...because thats how it is on PS.
---
Spent countless hours yet I only truly mastered 1 class of 1 faction. There is so much game left to play.

You still wont be tanking rag, or any of BWL really.  Bad advice for a tank wanting to raid.

Hardly any guilds in the game cleared Black Temple by the time season 3 had come out. I was in the top horde guild on my server and we were just getting onto Mother/Council when season 3 came. I don't know if you remember but they removed the attunement requirements for black temple/hyjal somewhere around this time so people with decent non tier gear mixed with pvp could get a foothold inside these raids and start farming them without ever having set foot inside SSC or TK let alone have to go through trying to make it past Kael'Thas. The reward for getitng past Kael'Thas was some easy bosses to farm, these easy bosses then became available to a lot more people without having to put in near as much time or coordination. Season 3 came out Nov 27 2007. Black Temple attunement removed from the game Feb 8, 2008.
---
The season 3 gear wasn't better for PVE for the most part, but it was comparable and most of it was better than tier 5. The fact that it led to a fast track where the path of least resistance was to not raid and you could get very good gear by sticking to yourself or one other person seemed like a very bad thing for the game in my mind. 
---
The reason it should be better imo is because it took more time and coordination with other people to achieve.  I understand that rating was a thing and it was actually quite hard to reach the level for the weapons, but that doesn't change the fact that it took way less time to achieve than raiding through all that attunement. DId you hate classic wow because the best pvp gear was found in pve raids? I don't understand that mentality if you are on this subreddit.
---
God, so much this. 
---
I'm in my second year of my master's program and just broke up with my girlfriend. WoW coming back into my life is gonna be ROUGH.

Back in ... what was it? 2007? When Apple set trends with the first iPhone we WoW players joked about the downfall of humanity if Blizzard and Apple combined forces to bring WoW on mobile devices.
---
Never happened.
---
Is it faster than other remote desktop stuff? I've been using Jump Desktop on my iOS devices for years and while it works, it's too slow for playing any kind of games over it unless you're on the same network as the computer you're remoting to.
---
Hi, /u/Spkeddie
---
This is not true.  
---
Fastest is enhancement until 50. Then elemental the rest of the way.
---
I haven't tested it throughly but so far every ability I've used triggers the UNIT_SPELLCAST_SUCCESSFUL event which is what I would use to reset the timer. I would need a list of spells that either reset the swing timer or don't and that list could be huge and require a lot of time to put together.
---
Certain people are A-type individuals which makes them turn the game into an actual job. Hence they will try to look at the game like it's a statistics class. I respect them but most times they annoy me... It is a game after all but for some it isn't a way to enjoy and relax but quite the contrary it is a manner to demonstrate they are better than everyone playing the game.
---
It is lonely up on that hil, except for the other A-type people.
---
60% mount at 40 and 100% at 60.
---
I just wish TBC could be retuned so basic quest rewards in HFP don't make epic raid gear you spent months acquiring obsolete. But I know that if it gets rereleased it'll be as close to the original as possible.
---
Yup. And orange quests aren't worth any more
---
Didn't see it until now, literally signed up just now
---
I guess Trump never got his attunement.
---
Wow that's really disappointing. I remember Lightninghoof when it first came up, the RP experience was almost surreal.
---
So many words yet you ignored the most important part of my post. Read up on false consensus bias or effect. Some people do not agree with you. 
---
I don't agree with that it breeds faction hatred by getting ganked by that high level. That rogue won't give a shit if you kill some horde player a few days later. World PvP is fun when you are out in the world and pvp woth people around your level, ganking low levels generate nothing but display an antisocial behaviour.
---
Classic is defently not harder than retail sure its more of a time sink but harder is the wrong word
---
Ahhhhh!
---
tokens?
---
They cant buff armor by 25% because they don't know what armor is.  
---
I agree with you that tanks will have more rage due to getting hit more..but of course that means they are taking more damage.  Which still means you probably wont see DW Fury tanks.
---
But it is sadly possible to lose a character. I didn’t know the undelete rules clearly. I thought I could I delete everyone anytime so to make room for a alt so I deleted my old 29 twink from BC. Full planning to recover him after switching servers or something and couldn’t find him. Apparently if they are under a certain level they get permanently deleted after 30-60 days or something. Sucks. Lost so many memories he was my oldest character I think. Oh well it’s my fault.
---
Oh wow, you mean you didn't write a program for this? Any scrub with a smartphone and stylus can pull it off?
---
I very much prefer Goblins to be a neutral race. One of the reasons why I much prefer the pre cataclysm material.
---
Mood
---
I vaguely remember seeing a 5 second rule addon a few days ago when I was uploading a new version of mine. I haven't seen a rogue energy tick but might add that because if rogues have that addon they would also have this one.
---
You're definitely right, I just think a lot of people are going to try to be the chosen one who somehow proves everyone wrong about those specs
---
So you didn't want to log in daily to do a few quests? Fine, no one forced you to. You had a lot of other things to make gold and the other rewards from TBC dailys weren't mandatory.
---
Yeah but I mean the run took over 6 hours... like they weren’t taking any chances on pulls and fights
---
Your "buddy" huh
---
I'm leading a summer camp that ends literally the week before release, and it will burn my entire summer away. And I'm happy about that!
---
Even worse: its a real life brand and in the TOS you agreed to not use the name of real life [Things] (Persons, Locations, Brands, Trademarks, Titles and so on). 
---
(A friend had the name McClane and was forced to rename it, so I read through this entire paragraph)
---
hf with your minmaxing :)
---
Damn you put a lot effort into your troll account, keep it up.
---
Undead is really useful on magmadar/ony/nefarian, since tremor totem takes time to tick. HP isn't really main priority. And you don't really use that much axes as mt.
---
As a warrior, everyone will run from you.  Well, at least mostly everyone except frost mages.
---
Technically the highest tier of play is horde. Windfurry totem dropped on your tanks so that your furry/prot troll tanks can generate even more threat.  This generates so much threat that the dps can’t pull threat if they try. That said none of that matters. You go horde because you like the harsh grit and family dynamic and you go alliance because... uh.. you like to look pretty I guess, or like the clean cut feel the faction has

# ⚡  OCEANIC - LATE NIGHT RAIDING ⚡
---
📋 **Guild:** &lt;Dominatus&gt; \[OCEANIC\] \[HORDE\] \[PVP\]
---
🌅 **Time Zone**: GMT+10
---
⌚ **Raid times**:  10:00pm - 1:30am Mon/Weds/Thurs (+ Sunday as a reserve night if needed)
---
📋 **Goals**: PvE (Semi-hardcore raid progression)
---
🎲 **Loot**: EPGP or Council (Details TBA)
---
☎ **Contact**: [https://discord.gg/Hcy87MX](https://discord.gg/Hcy87MX)
---
🔎 **Info**: Dominatus is a late-night, semi-hardcore guild. Raiding will start at 10:00pm GMT+10 time so this would suit WA players or East Coast nightowls. We will not be rushing for server firsts but intend to develop into a high quality raiding guild for like-minded players. We have Vanilla raiding experience up to the first couple of encounters in AQ40.
---
📥 **Applicants**: Anyone can apply, the leveling journey as a guild will be focusing on general recruitment and working out raid roles. Vanilla raiding experience is highly preferred but not mandatory. It is expected that players will have a moderate-to-advanced knowledge of their class as well as a committed ethos to raiding (familiarising yourself with mechanics, farming consumables, acquiring BiS gear etc).
---
📖 **Roster**: Positions available for all classes.
---
Join the discord here [https://discord.gg/Hcy87MX](https://discord.gg/Hcy87MX) and feel free to message if you have any questions.
---
Cheers!
---
The way i read this was that you're 29 years old with a birthday on Aug. 30th, and 3 days of gaming gets you into your 30s lol
---
I suspect 3 million accounts, but 90% or more will quit, and another 5% will be more or less inactive.
---
UD Warrior is fun. Wotf helps quite a bit, you’d be surprised how often you get caught out berserker stance. Is it the best tank racial? No. But tanking is more about skill and gear than your racials. Play what you want, they all will work.
---
Rogue and Warrior abilities don't count as spells, they're melee abilities.
---
It's pretty easy to distinguish between "spells" and "melee abilities" because "spells" are really only on mana-users. If it's a melee-range ability that doesn't cost mana, chances are it's not a spell.
---
You can never go wrong with troll pve or orc pvp
---
I hear you. If the name was less clickbait and more "beta beats King mosh" I'd chuckle and give it a watch. Throwing a bunch of low levels at something is definitely fun.
---
Really? I thought paladin's aoe threat was outstanding (cons, ret aura), what makes warrior aoe threat better?
---

I'm not a min maxer but I'll pass along your kind words :)

I mean isn't 24 the [highest number](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkP_OGDCLY0), anyway? What more could one expect?  
---
Fuggeddaboudit.
---
There's not much behind it. It's as ridiculous as it looks.
---
How much is a canvas print?  I printed up a matte poster for $20.
---
Horde race choices are far less important than for alliance, despite what people say. There aren't as many good tanking axes as swords, so eh.
---
I was a troll tank on Nos (at the time everybody thought tauren was the meta), and now I see now a lot of people recommending troll tanks as the best, in the last few months. but I feel like people have really overestimated (or been misled as to) how good Berserking is and how easy it is to use reliably while tanking. Trying to time it after big spikes of damage between heals is difficult, especially when you're also trying to position mobs and build threat at the same time. Your average pop on berserking is likely to be closer to 10% boost rather than 30% unless your healers are letting you hang on low hp
---
And, let's say even if you hit it perfectly on 3minute CD, that 30% boost evens out to a paltry 1.6% boost over the course of a 3 minute fight. And that's a boost to your white damage, not your threat per second, which will be even lower. you would probably be better off focusing your attention on building threat and cleanly weaving HSes into your rotation.
---
 The delay on spell batching that classic will have implemented should make it even harder. The idea that you'll be able to get close to the 30% boost with every pop is extremely hopeful.
---
Loyalty only to the transaction at hand 💵

Wait til they found out how broken raid boss AI, and boss AI in general is on pservers.
---
Yup! Common rebuttal though. Former work friend. He has a named Twitter feed, his twitch and youtube. He's just never been a reddit person. Not everyone is. Took me forever to convince him to get a twitter too. Some people just don't like typing to text for some reason.  
---
Have my upvote though =P
---
This is one of my favorite comments of all time
---
"A good outlet for whatever emotion that is" lmao
---
Engi isn't expensive to level up anyway, and it would be faster to farm with a mount.
---
Dunno, never used anything else. It’s great for what I use it for and I assume passable for AH and mob grinding stuff since he uses it for that a ton. I don’t think you’re going to get great performance out of any Remote Desktop software and it’s going to be heavily dependent on both your devices and their connections, which is different for everyone. Try it out and see is all I can say really, you don’t need an account or anything like that. It’s stupid easy to use.
---
Like when I carried the paper to the printer. &gt;! You're welcome Janet!!&lt;
---
Can you buy it outright or do you have to have that game pass thing?
---
I agree with you for the more popular ones, but there are some good humble streamers like Venruki who don't deserve the camping
---
Yes it’s overstated. Hunters are a top 3 dps class in MC and BWL. They then are middle pack in AQ and then are bottom come Naxx. Most people won’t even touch Naxx. And most guilds will be happy just to have consistent, skilled raiders, that they will bring several hunters to Naxx.
---
Honestly I hope blizzard blocks this. Nothing against you OP, just goes against one of the main things vanilla is about.
---
Fair enough but classic won't be retail when it comes to PvP servers, there are always enough people with the mindset, whether the majority or not, that ganking is fun enough to warrant use of their time that you'll run into it frequently and it'll cost you a lot of time.
---
It's just how people played back then, and continued to play on pservers and when the honor system comes out x months before any battlegrounds it'll get worse in higher level zones.
---
It's just something to be aware of, you can't avoid it by simply deeming it immoral but you do get the option to play at maximum efficiency on PvE servers should getting camped for several hours be too much.
---
Once people start hitting max level they will generally be in IF because of its proximity to raids and dungeons and such... Hopefully
---
Druids make good tanks in raids.
---
They have better TPS than Warrior tanks so DPS can go harder.
---
Our bear tank had 16k health and at the armor cap with an insane amount crit and dodge.
---
They aren't for AQ they're to make the MC transition easier, and to add stuff for nonraid players.
---
You just run back and forth
---
Yeah this dumbass is literally taking the Vanilla 5Head brains meme seriously
---
That’s new WoW. Classic was 40.
---
Aaaaand out comes the straw man. No one said everyone had to have an "equal chance at getting loot and a fair chance at getting a raid spot, blah blah blah". Folks like Gemall are just saying that some guilds are okay with it, so leave them the fuck alone. You do your thing, let them do theirs.
---
Yes! Some specific / high level enchants can set you back, but there are plenty of enchants that would be relatively easy for you to do yourself or cheap to have someone else do.
---
Mind control in that instance was godlike.

Honestly, if I recall many of the horde world firsts were performed with a Tauren warrior.  I raided then as a Human warrior tank for all content through Naxx.  Really you can play whatever you want and still be successful as its less about individual performance and more about the group.  Certain roles are requiring more awareness and commitment than others, such as the tank or heals.  Honestly, the one role you can play that's virtually useless is DPS.  Every DPS in vanilla is replaceable.  Does not matter how good they are they are replaceable in almost every fight.  The reason is they are one of 40 people doing damage (well less than in cases with healers) and being top DPS usually isnt somehow carrying said group of 40 people.  If you have 35 people damaging and you do double the damage of anyone else in the raid, your still less than 3% change in fight being replaced with any other average DPS in vanilla. 
---
So ask yourself this question, do you want to be useful no matter the race you pick?  Or do you want to be replaceable no matter the raid you join?
---
Just put your dps meter in the middle of the screen and you won't be able to see the race.
---
Any class that can be a female dwarf should be a female dwarf.
---
hahahahahah
---
 Can't lock exp in vanilla
---
K
---
They're twinked to hell too....  Let's be real here.
---
berzerking for quick agro, hp5 turns out is more useful than a flat 5% hp based on BASE stamina not stamina from gear.
---
We cleared the content 13 years ago. There's no point in rushing it. Our guild will not be trying to min-max everything. We even plan to have a balance druid.
---
Are you trying to kill Ragnaros in 40 minutes?
---
You think that' funny streamer"  Eh"  I am fuck you up, when I get a beta key.  lil bitch.
---
I mained a mage and had a spoiled rogue alt in vanilla. They’re both excellent classes but it depends if you want to be a caster or a rogue stabbing. Rogues are definitely more gear dependent, and there’s no urgent desire to have them in groups, while as a mage, I always got invited due to the intel buff, food/water and portal home.
---
My plan is viewing the first finish line at the epic mount. Dual gathering profession with a few pinpointed spots I'll be grinding in lieu of questing in order to multi task between grinding gold and gaining residual xp. The alternative would be rushing to 60 then grinding for gold for the mount, I prefer to have the xp gain if I'm going to be doing it anway. Doing this and playing the auction house should get me my mount shortly after hitting 60.
---
Of course they are here for the money.
---
Their berzerking can pull a lot of threat if you have the right gear. More threat means more wild DPS can get.
---
Get a nice dagger and I think gloves or a belt that gives +dagger skill and you'll be a threat beast. Or something.
---
shit, good call  
---
might also want that addon which mutes (or replaces) race sounds  
---
I used it to mute female orc grunts (🤮)
---
Unless they are cool with it.
---
Yup, literally anyone can do this.
---
Op finishes their addon and can finally play the game.
---
Jesus man. What's with all of the hate?
---
Heard him on Joe Rogan Experience previously and some of the facts about sleep are so astounding. Especially, with how proud people are about their “ability” to thrive on little sleep.
---
Nice guide
---
Wat 
---
Is.. is this a joke? Priest MT? 
---
You’re yanking our chain, right?
---
As a vanilla warrior, this is not the case for the majority of the game. Only once you’re very well geared
---
Yogscast. They turned me from playing Minecraft to playing wow.
---
Since raids don't scale just getting 40 people is  no easy task so nobody is ever going to benched
---
Just a parody.
---
&gt; Some will arfue that dwarf pally is bad because they can already remove poisons with a spell
---
But can they cast their dispel while blinded? Because dwarf can cast stoneform while blinded.
---
I’m sure you’ll see guilds using a sorts of loot distribution methods. DKP will be one of them.
---
Yea, but even someone as extremely good as him is still barely above the frickin tank on some fights lol... he has to full pot constantly, but there is only so much you can do. 
---
Not to mention we don't know if that helm will work the same in classic.
---
So you're saying that a warrior's Mortal Strike doesn't trigger the UNIT_SPELLCAST_SUCCESSFUL event? 
---
I was thinking about creating a list of spells that don't reset the timer based on the class. Like a priest's list would probably be empty but a warrior's would have Mortal Strike, Rend, Hamstring, etc.
---
Sick bro I’ll being my warrior heal spec and let’s group up!
---
How do i set this up on my phone?
---
It still isn't "viable" with that.  
---
You can full pot, abuse that item, and be as geared as you can get, but you will still barely beat out ret pallys.
---
Thats the difference between the people that played vanilla, and the people that played the pirated servers.
---
But... but, muh mount. I do mean that only somewhat tongue in cheek
---
I can relate to this so much. I shared a WoW account with my mom, brother, and I growing up. When that became an issue for raiding my mom broke us off into separate accounts. About a year ago or so I actually got nostalgic about my original characters and got help from Blizzard to retrieve all my characters from my mother’s WoW account. It’s so nice to see them on the character select screen and log in for the first time in so long.
---
No, it was crap in vanilla lol...  There are a couple streamers who play cat on pservers, and even with full pot and abusing that item, they still aren't beating out ret pallys by that much.. and that is not a good thing. 
---
Being viable and being an acceptable carry if people like you and like your effort, are two completely different things.
---
Yeh I guess I should have said widespread or as the main form. With so many guilds and so little loot, it’s taking players, new and old, to a time when loot had to be sorted and handed out instead of the game handing them to you.
---
Not bad, definitely useful for a new classic player that can't pick a class :). I think you should mention that hunters are useful for kiting stuff in raids too. We had hunters kiting mobs in trash packs in aq40 and the dragonkin it during razergore phase 1
---
Yup. That's what I keep saying.  Everyone seems to forget that by 1.12 feral was viable, so much so that when mangle was added for 2.0, they needed to be nerfed almost immediately.  Seems a lot of people forget that bearcat was one spec, not two.
---
I want to see them gank Swifty live.
---
Wait... He's the best warrior in the world. That's not possible.
---
^(/s)
---
Just remember to install a chat filter addon!
---
That does seem like a fair system. It encourages people to take more, but gives them the option to hold out if they really desire something. Does it at least make sure hunters don't roll on warrior weapons?
---
I was literally just thinking about how I would be able to play WoW in my living room and whether I could remote into my computer with my iPad Pro and saw this appear in my feed. I think it’s a creepy message from the surveillance overlords. They want me to play Classic as bad as I do.
---
your my buddy my ass lol
---
Loot council will reign in Classic.
---
&gt; It reeks of KH3 which is a subpar game 
---
I don't think KH3 is terrible, it just doesn't have the post-game content that it should right now. To make an analogy based on the sub we're on, it would be like vanilla WoW launching with only Onyxia. One post-game boss that's not even that hard is not enough (I'm still disappointed with Dark Inferno TBH). Obviously it is going to look a bit sad compared to KH2FM which had an insanely deep and rich post-game experience with 13 boss Cavern of Remembrance (and legit hard trash encounters too), Lingering Will, and Mushroom XIII along with Coliseum Cups etc.
---
The expansion for KH3 is coming soon, I'm fine with dishing out another 40$ if the content is good. If the encounter design could legit match Data XIII or Lingering Will it sounds reasonable to me.
---
You sound jealous
---
(never had too much problem with crushing blows... but RNG is RNG so you never know)
---
edit: the TPS was just something I saw with regards to our warrior tanks vs that druid bear tank, the dps would always pull aggro off the warrior tanks unless they held back and with the bear tank we could go all out and still not pull aggro (could have just been bad warrior tanks and that druid bear tank was a great player)
---
Not in most Vanilla encounters they weren't. 
---
Also, way to cherry pick a single line out of context. If you read the whole convo you would realize that is NOT what I was saying at all.
---
I'm saying it's not a spell. It doesn't push back your swing timer. At least, it shouldn't.
---
The two main ones are DKP and Loot Council.
---
The flaw in DKP is you're awarded mostly for participation and not the actual value you contribute to the group. You just show up and stockpile DKP and get what you want, regardless of whether you deserve it the most or not. Someone also has to keep track of everyones DKP and who got what, which is a bitch.
---
Loot Council ideally distributes drops to those who do the most for the guild and the raid group. Farming mats, making consumables, resist gear, etc. The idea is the person who is more involved in the success of the guild will get the gear before someone who just shows up.
---
The downside to loot council is that there is more room for corruption. Neptotism. It starts to feel like there is an in group and and out group, and everyone in the in group seems to be really good friends. 
---
In an ideal setting, I think Loot Council is the superior choice. Its the most fair option, but abusing it makes it the least fair shittiest option.
---
I've already written up a zero-sum DKP system for if I can't find a raiding guild I like and I need to form my own, of course we'll see DKP.
---
Sadly, if we are looking at this from the point of view of pure viability in raids, then cat DPS in vanilla is piss, especially after MC as people pull ahead in more relevant gear.  
---
If you don't mind joining a semi casual (maybe semi serious) raiding guild and they don't mind that you are basically needing to be hard carried in regards to DPS output, then it isn't that bad.  
---
But yea.. it isn't until TBC that it becomes a lot better for sure.  I actually liked it a lot when TBC hit.
---
Ah reddit, the place where people can't have friends who are not on reddit. =)
---
Not much of a prediction tbh, PvE servers always had the majority of players.
---
Some guilds combo DKP with Loot Council to address  Hunter weapon issues.
---
Holy hell man, you keep making assumptions. Not gonna even bother at this point if your mind is that made up.
---
I’ve used Chrome Remote Desktop, RealVNC, TeamViewer, RDP, logmein, Jump Desktop, and I’m probably forgetting some. But, i’ve gotten the best performance and reliability out of RealVNC for a while now and only use TeamViewer when I need to help out my family with tech support.
---
No, the only thing that makes having something like a boomkin, ret pally, arcane mage or cat dps "viable" is when people like you and like your effort.  But the DPS is unacceptably low.
---
So all joking aside I’ve got a real breakdown for you. 
---
What sounds more awesome to you?
---
A knight of the Holy Roman Empire cleansing the holy land of Jerusalem while epic crusader music plays in the background. If this sounds like you then join the Alliance 
---
Or
---
A ravaging barbarian cutting down swaths of enemies, overpowering all in his path. All the while tribal drums beat so loud you can’t hear the screams of you victims. But if this sounds like your fantasy then welcome to the horde brother. 
---
While this arguably describes classes better than it does factions the aesthetic are the same. 
---
If you can figure out which of these sounds cooler you’ll know what you want.
---
Here’s what I would say...
---
We know a lot more about the game now then we did them BUT it’s not like we were less intelligent humans. Maybe the opposite is true.
---
I was MT warrior back then and with few exceptions did I see non Prot warriors or Other specs main tanking.  Never saw it never heard of it and to be honest was surprised to see it happen on pservers 
---
End game raiding is not what pservers have made it. Yes min/max guilds will achieve it. MC will be walked immediately as will Ony 
---
Bwl and Aq and Naxx will test people mark my words.
---
Maybe easier for horde to justify since no JoL and JoW
---
5/5 Silent Resolve and you want to be a tank?  
---
No priest tank worth their salt ~~hasn't been laughed off these forums~~ wants to reduce the threat they output.
---
I am sure you have friends, but that's your channel lol
---
Thanks I hate it!
---
&gt; You seem to consider your perspective to be universally correct.
---
Could say the same about yall on the other side of the argument there chief.
---
work + gym 3x week + 7hr sleep + 1 night for dinner/drinks is very doable you just need to plan ahead and not be lazy. You can even throw a gf into that equation. You can end game raid and have a life outside of wow but you have to live a structured life style. Ranking past rank 10... now that’s no lifing.
---
Cause your guildies want to play their character that way and they show up for raid day. Not everyone cares to play as efficiently as possible, I don't know what's hard to understand about that.
---
You don't kick your friend off your pickup basketball team cause he isn't as good as Kevin Durant, you have fun playing anyway cause it's a game and not your job.
---
People confuse a very small min/max edge in racials with entire broken specs from Vanilla.
---
Any class or race is viable and welcomed in raids, at least 99% of raids.
---
Specs on the other hand are a different ball of wax.  
---
Prot Pallies are not tanking raids, ever, never ever.  This isn’t an insult or opinion.  I’m honestly trying to prevent people from doing what I did...level a pally for 9 months and be told you can not tank.  Then when I got the chance to tank, I lost aggro in 3 seconds and lacked any taunt to get the boss back.  Failed about 78 more times before I realized I needed to just heal.
---
Sauce?
---
I slaughtered his filthy ilk for over a week just to get a pirate hat
---
Worth it.
---
I used to enjoy those unnecessary censorship videos. Wouldn't mind watching one of those with Warcraft characters.
---
Like that dwarf npc quote "I've the finest **** in the land!"
---
sorry linked a dps spec I was messing around with.  Those points should be in Wand Spec.
---
Thanks for the feedback, i added a line in for that
---
Was view distance shorter in Vanilla? I remember being able to see where people were headed just by looking. But maybe  that kind of distance was added later as hardware improved.
---
As a Hunter I run from everything while shooting them.
---
What are preperations? Did you mean preparations? Anyways cool video. Wonder if he’ll go down week 1
---
And even then, you still barely out DPS ret pallys in raids.
---
&gt;People need to understand that streamers are not there for your entertainment, they are there for your MONEY!
---
Its weird how I only give my money to the ones that entertain me.
---
¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Actually have had 2 friends ask me that question for themselves. Maybe the people you know are memes, but that's not been my RL experience lol  
---
Lot a hate on this sub though, probably a good reason I never got into wow. Xev did warn me about this community lol
---
Please show examples of this kind of disparity. 
---
Very few specs are going to pull 1200 without some kind of fucking godly gear setup, broken mechanics, and infinite consumables.
---
NO spec that isn't just trying to fail talent choices will do that low in the same scenario (perfect gear, consumables etc). Even something like Boomkin  will be able to get higher via consumables to keep mana up.
---
I'm a teacher now so instead of spending all day at school wishing I could be gaming like in the mid 2000s I'll just take my personal laptop and have the kids read or something while I level. 
---
Me: "Okay class open your books to page 51 and read silently, if you finish answer questions 1-5 on page 66. 
---
Students: "We *always* read silently!"
---
Me: "Listen Jimmy I'm not gonna capture any of my lost 2005 glory days by teaching you about participles and gerunds, now am I?"
---
I feel like they could drastically increase the population of the servers since computing power and lag in ironforge is no longer a big concern.
---
I'm confused.  If blizzard is basically just opening a vanilla server, how different is that than a private vanilla server?  And to that end, how is wow classic not done?  Hasn't it been done and ready for over a decade?
---

I got reported on a PvP server for calling my hunter cat "Dog". Can't imagine the shit reports GMs would have to trawl through nowadays.
---
She's lezbo?
---
You might take that back once Classic is out and they shit all over it
---
That’s a lot of loot to council, talking about 40 people here and if it’s anything like oh vanilla it’s not gonna be the same 40
---
I'm going to pick a server with the least amount of steamers.
---
AND THEN I'M GOING TO STREAM ON IT BAHAHAHAHHAHHAHHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHHA
---
Even if we had them available day 1... trying to get all the pieces will cost you like 500g or something very stupid like that (someone correct me, been a while.. but it was a lot) and the 45 baron run without people who have any raid gear is crazy hard.
---
You could fly in classic?
---
Why do you think she left Mankirk in the first place?
---
Makes sense to me, if you want easy invites to groups/guilds you have to play certain specs but if you want to be casual play whatever you want just dont be upset when you arent invited to hardcore groups.
---
I really should block that Name on Reddit.
---
I played Vanilla from the minute servers went live (had game preinstalled on release) to the minute before TBC launched. I am all about coming up with unconventional specs and plan on trying to take Shaman tanking as far as I can. 
---
I would say more oldschool players want those specs than not because we likely already ran our course of the TOP specs back when we did play, and want something else to do this time.
---
I'm not doing any professions until after I'm already 60. I'm going to skip non-essential spells to save money, and vendor my way to a mount. Once I'm 60 I'll go back and gather. 
---
Plus I'm not sure what professions I even want. I figure if I level to 60 without Engineering I'll see how essential it would be to me personally, simply by not having it. I really would prefer to just go Herbalism/Alchemy.
---
I've been using the remote desktop app for wow and eve for over a year now. It's fun but also there's a few annoying things about it. But it when's in a pinch if I don't have my laptop and I'm out of town
---
Some people are seriously bored.
---
were you living under a rock ?
---
&gt; Will wow classic have the same recommended requirements as it did back in the early 2000s?
---
No. The beta is completely unplayable on a machine with 2007 specs.
---
The spec requirements are much closer to retail, if not identical, with the exception of hard disk space and video ram.
---
I'm just gonna roll on Asmon server so I can give him gold :)
---
Wow. Feels so much closer that way than thinking of Aug. 27th.

So why are u advertising for your buddy so hard? You also made a thread about his "destiny video" and to go "roast him". Come on now.

It should still hit harder with backstab/ambush than the lifeforce dirk. But it's not like a whooooole lot better, it may be just a few damage.
---
You have my upvote
---
Obligatory to link the infamous onxyia wipe.
---
The box. That was honestly just how I picked games back then, the few pictures on the back.
---
Yeah, that definitely makes a 10 level disparity trivial. /s
---
It’s possible they had the wrong gear or weren’t downranking spells. You’re right about the crit refunds, but honestly they can just spam low rank flash of light on cooldown. Rank 1 costs 35 mana.
---
Couldn't they have just made it official and write up a contract with the add-on developers?
---
See, they don't actually use any resources on that. Its an automated system. 
---
The standard for banning is just whether enough people report you.
---
Exactly
---
You really think this is some great accomplishment or something?  lol
---
People is shitting a lot on the "streamer's server" but this kind of fun will be unique to that server.
---
I think everyone in this sub has seen this video atleast 10 times now.
---
Nope, GM Island is on the top left of Kalimdor (wayy left of Teldrassil and it wouldn't even fit on the map). The ones below Tanaris are for the Scepter of the Shifting Sands questline.
---
I'm alliance actually Carebearz the gnome rogue
---
I saw zero daggers in this link
---
Tried out RealVNC and it's way more laggy than Jump Desktop's "fluid" connection mode. Tried watching a video and it chugged along at like 3 frames per second, whereas with Jump it was actually watchable at around 15-20fps.
---
Ah well. It seemed pretty good though, for a free remote client. Jump Desktop costs like 10 bucks now, I think.
---
Best system for your average guild will be dkp with council for legendaries.
---
Fortunately for everyone else, ret paladin was lowest priority for getting hand of rag.
---
Has a good feel overall. Can’t say you did anything wrong really. 
---
It might be nice if when describing the quests and bosses, you took shots of the key mob or item for that quest. Similar to the way you did show the quest givers. For example, in instances where there is a particular thing that needs to be clicked to loot a quest item, named mob that needs to be killed, or even just a closer shot of one of the mobs for kill quests. 
---
Otherwise, keep it up man! Wailing Caverns will really give you a chance to experiment with a more complicated instance. Cant wait to see one for SFK!
---
31 points in first aid?
---
This is awesome, I love it. As a pretty wow casual, this gives me the lore I need to be more invested in the story behind the dungeons I'm spending hours in.
---
You pay for entertainment? You fool! No one else does that!
---
No, not really. They’d need a contract with every single crowdsourced voice actor and in California there are union agreements every company that employs voice actors must follow. It would have been prohibitively expensive.
---
They are 10 levels lower than expected dude. You can't say that dungeons are hard based on this
---
You shouldn't get hit. A mage can just kite all day.
---
No, because deep wounds is actually low priority and will not remove the aforementioned debuffs.

It's a quest reward involved the with encounter (the boss fight). https://classicdb.ch/?quest=3528

To me, even as a diehard KH fan, it's starting to feel like maybe Nomura punched above his weight with KH1 and KH2. It's all been lackluster since. I get more annoyed the further the series goes on, and KH3 should have been so much more than it does. Most KH fans even agree that KH1 with its choppy, out of date gameplay with shitty ass PS2 quality camera is a better game than KH3. And that should not have happened.
---
KH3 had a decade of buildup with story, more advanced technology, every character making their return.. And we got a game where the game doesnt happen until the final 2-3 hours and we just frolick Disney worlds not moving the plot till then.
---
It's it just me, or does Technotron sound like a perfectly legit gnome name?
---
True my friend.  Early warrior it feels like everyone has the upper hand.
---
It depends on what you want. If you want high HPS and a reasonable chance to top the healing charts, you want Paladin and  you definitely don't want Druid.
---
Druids typically won't ever be outputting crazy healing numbers. They do however have unique utility that allows for a few Druids. Usually 1-3. The upside to this is that Druids tend to be geared out first, which is super nice.
---
As for getting into raids, its hard to say. A raid has more Paladin slots to fill, but Druid is a far less popular class than Paladin and thus is harder to fill.
---
No way you're getting that much loot 1 hour into Diablo 3 fresh as a new account either, buuuut multiplayer boosting exists so I suppose it does fit well here
---
Productive poops is all i ask for...
---
[Loot Lists for the win](http://onslaught-wow.com/about/). 100% drama free, no bidding, and giving out loot in the raid takes seconds.
---
Hmm, interesting. Not sure why that is working that way for you. But, i’ve only jumped VNC tools because some would work flawlessly for a while and then behave like you described. Currently, I’ve been able to use RealVNC without a hiccup for a while though.
---
Immersion Classic
---
The best bet is Questie, the author has 2 more month to refine it into perfection. Lunar elder event quests can be shift-clicked off the map, if I'm not mistaken.
---
Still more viable than balance druid
---
Cute blog post, I think you meant yo submit this to livejournal.
---
If this was the case, deep wounds would be constantly knocking off debuffs when warriors cast recklessness. This is just not the case. You are wrong. That is not how it is. MS knocks off low priority debuffs, Deep Wounds doesn't.
---
Interesting, interesting. is this mostly in Naxx your talking about or earlier in the game you think?
---
The only experience I have with seeing druid tanks is we had a druid tank the Garr adds sometimes and a druid tank onyxia (literally any class as long as they can threat can tank onyxia). I also heard of people using druid tanks on patchwerk.

Thanks for the feedback!
---
Right..
---
You seem upset.
---
I believe it's called Inkarnate.
---
All streamers are exactly the same? That is just laughable.
---
yeah I plan on testing it again with shaman shock spells. currently on the pserver i've been playing on shocks do NOT reset the timer and I don't think moonfire/rejuv do either but I have to test those.
---
It's only 3 dps less than the Pendulum of Doom, 2 hander everyone is trying to get from uldaman
---
Thats a good point that I didn't mention, I've heard of it before but it slipped my mind entirely. Showing who gets what well ahead of time is good thing for sure. 
---
I'll have to take a deeper look into that link later, as its super detailed and thus very complicated. My tiny little brain is hurting looking at all the numbers.
---
Ultimately I feel like as long as everyone has something to look forward to getting in the near future, its a good system.
---
I think it's pretty impressive, yeah.
---
I'm sure its nothing compared to your 1337 neckbeard skills, though.
---
Not like we have time to commit now lol.
---
Damn I need your weed mans number this is some next level dumb shit
---
Cancerous fanboi turds like you perfectly embody why streamers are a plague.
---
So I just tested in both modern and a vanilla pserver (solid source /s). Mortal Strike triggered the event in modern and rend triggered the equivalent event in vanilla. I'm gonna start putting together a list of spells that won't reset the swing timer.
---
ok
---
I've had a real world name for years, the only character I've ever been forced to rename was my gnome Phetus, because i was oh so clever back when i was 14. Apparently that name was offensive to someone.
---
2 Friends ask you if it looked like herpes?   \^see above
---
I use a couple of different mice for Vanilla, depending on what I'm doing. Check out: [https://unreasonablereviews.com/classic-wow-peripherals/](https://unreasonablereviews.com/classic-wow-peripherals/)
---
Have actually started using multiple headsets, too. But admittedly it's a bit much.
---
Where do you think I learned this tip? From a real warrior in the game, which I then applied when I leveled up two warriors myself.
---
&gt;Recommending prot talents for leveling is in practically all cases god awful advise.
---
And where did you learn that? The rule is "don't level as a prot spec," not "don't put talents in the prot tree at all." Nothing in the Arms or Fury tree less than 20 talents deep is so urgent to get that the 7 points in Prot will be an issue.
---
It might have been because I was using the "free" version and not one of the paid versions. I noticed that the paid versions had some kind of high speed connection feature that promised "up to four times the refresh rate" or something like that.
---
I believe it’s impossible to change the last name on it, as others have stated, it was impossible for a long time to have your name changed (with the exception of a vigorous process by speaking to a higher up in advanced cases,) but just a few months ago, when they changed the battle.net website, I was able to change the first name on the my account all the sudden, and did.
---
I've used Chrome Remote Desktop, TeamViewer, LogMeIn, and Splashtop (paid).  
---
Of them all, Splashtop has been the fastes/lowest latency, but carries a modest fee (something like $3 a month).  Of what I've used, the next best was Chrome Remote Desktop.
---
Dude no idea why I said horde, I'm alliance. I guess I was just subconsciously thinking about fighting each other instead of dueling. We can test in duels and compare dmg outside IF gates.
---
If you have beta access you could test there. I would if I could, but the next stress test isn't until next week.
---
Ugh, yeah, monthly fees? no thanks. I bought Jump Desktop like 8 years ago and haven't paid a dime more for it since then.
---
Except that we know what the armor value is for [Magmadar](http://web.archive.org/web/20060413193842/http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v26/ErikVKing/Magmadar-BeastLore.jpg) and [Maexxna](http://www.kurai.com/wow/naxx/maexxna.jpg). 
---
3731 for both, current value on the highest populated pserver is 4691.
---
Someone on another sub did some math and found out [KT has roughly 3k armor](https://www.reddit.com/r/wowservers/comments/az785q/proof_kelthuzad_had_just_3000_armor/). KT has 3795 armor on the pserver mentioned above.
---
Wow youre so ragey. Chill out. 
---
&gt; never ganked a single person in vanilla 
---
Why not? Its fun.
---
Okay, yes, but I still think it’s too advanced for only 1 finger to controll movement and camera, because you need your other finger free for the other 1000 things you need to do while fighting
---
That’s assuming your region even has two PVP realms.
---
Something is off with elite mob damage and crushing blows, at first I had my doubts but now I'm almost sure, here's what edged me to this conclusion :
---
\- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCArJM3fNnc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCArJM3fNnc) , in this link asmongold and his band of merry followers kill king mosh , a level 60 mini world boss in ungoro crater.
---
\- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqotU1FcbAU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqotU1FcbAU) , and this link is a video uploaded 14 years ago of a bunch of lvl 60 nubs trying to kill king mosh.
---
Now although the mage is cloth and obviously will take some damage, we must remember that armor ratings alter per level and crushing blow is affected by levels.
---
It feels like even though asmon is protection specced with a shield, the damage he takes seems proportional to a level 60, making it seem like his armor rating is behaving like a lvl 60 ( not 100% sure on that yet but it's just an estimation).
---
Now for the real biggy, if you watch carefully while asmon is tanking his shield block drops for a good 7-8 secs while he gets hit by the boss a few times for non-crushing blow... several times...in fact most of the time, this is mega off due to the way crushing blow works :
---
[https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Crushing\_blow](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Crushing_blow).
---
If the math can be trusted , asmongold being 20 levels below the boss would mean that :
---
( 60\*5 - 40\*5) \*2% - 15% = 185% chance of getting a crushing blow at his level, factoring out his miss/dodge/parry/block% out would still not bring it lower than 100%, basically every hit outside shield block should be a crushing blow , which doesn't seem to be the case at all.
---
Conclusion: if my math is correct, then there's something seriously off about the formula they implemented.
---
Because he's a good buddy and he's having fun. Let's reverse your dumb question.
---
Your good friend asks you how to increase his visibility online, so you tell him Reddit is a good pick and Twitter. He's hesitant to do so. So, do you just do nothing or do you show your friend why you were right?
---
I mean if you aren't good friends I suppose you do nothing.
---
Better question, how would you help a buddy out without incurring your dumb questions? Can you post a buddies video at all? Or is your position as dumb as it sounds?
---
But I saw both bosses in one game a month ago :(
---
Honestly as someone who has spent MANY hours in AV since TBC I can't wait to see it in Classic. I quite enjoy it now in Retail, takes an hour (but the longer the better to me) bosses happen every now and then but it's not common. I wish they buffed the other things tho, the only upgrades worth anything are bosses and armor scrap turnins.
---
A lot of people in this sub havent played in a while, in BFA they moved 40v40 into its own random pool called Random Epic Battleground. Meaning you can choose to queue for the normal smaller BGs or the big ones, or queue for both. They've been balancing the epic ones to last about 40 mins to an hour, which feels like an okay time for a BG. The rewards are meh for the time, meaning most people queue purely for fun, and the queue times being only about 15 minutes (at least Horde US mid day EST) shows that they are quite fun, people do not zerg rush anymore. Some groups try, it rarely works
---
That being said, resource race is still correct. The Mines can REALLY turn the tide of a game if it turns into a turtle match, people underestimate them so much
---
But I'm a rogue
---
Did you miss the &lt;chuckle&gt;?
---
&gt;where the game doesnt happen until the final 2-3 hours and we just frolick Disney worlds not moving the plot till then.
---
I can't disagree with you there, but at the same time, I'd argue more fault for that lies with BBS and DDD. What other possible way could you tell the story? 7 vs 13 / Keyblade War 2.0 was established as being the finale. As soon as you find Aqua then Ven is going to be next to follow and from there the climax. The only way the Disney worlds could tie into the actual plot is if the Disney worlds were somehow necessary to bring back Aqua. 
---
But yeah, the story is pretty bad. At this point though, I'm just playing on Critical Mode and skipping the cutscenes, so the non-existence of story in the Disney worlds tying into the game's *actual* story isn't the end of the world for me personally. I guess if you're more of a story-heavy player that's a bummer though, especially with stuff like the Frozen world being garbage (Mat Pat / Game Theorist did a video speculating on why the Frozen world was such a mess). 
---
And maybe, just maybe, the expansion salvages the story side a bit. We saw a blurb about Young Nort before getting his Nort eyes and something involving Luxord, so if the expansion is less about the Disney stuff and more focused strictly on the OC stuff it could be pretty good.
---
Quality
---
IDK what your talking about. I had a wow account that I cannot get back. I tried like 15 times and each time Blizzard cock blocks me. 
---
I'm also a dipshit that did not remember any of his information relating to the account.
---
Wowhead says it was added in patch 1.13.1, so we won't be able to get it right?
---
Not going to get very far until we get vanish though
---
Right, but I can easily run a dungeon from work should I choose. Chrome Remote Desktop, while the next best (again, of what I've used) would give me.... 10 FPS at best? Usable standing still at the AH, but nothing more than that.
---
I get your point, but the only reason chat is unreadable is because people are inanely spamming. If nobody did that, it would be quite possible to have conversations despite several thousand viewers.
---
I have definitely found that larger channels tend to attract more emote and meme spammers.
---
So uh, where’s the backstory? You didn’t really just quit your job to play WoW all day, every day, did you?
---
The fact is that there were people playing arena with T6 gear in Season 2. It weren't many but they had a huge advantage.
---
By the time the attunement was removed you also had Zul Aman and T5.5 bagdge gear. Both were easy accessible and good enough to raid T6 content. It was removed on March 25, 2008 by the way. PvP didn't had an impact on PvE in the whole expansion. 
---
You would see a big difference in DPS between someone with full T6 gear and someone with full S3 gear. PvE gear was in 95% of the cases better than PvP gear and the other 5% had a rating requierment and took weeks to get. Season 3 gear was one tier above T5 and came much later. It had to be good, elsewise PvP players would have been destroyed by T6 players.
---
Also it's hard for me to understand why people are so vehemently against the concept that PvP players get good gear for PvP through PvP. Why do you want to force them to raid when they enjoy PvP much more? PvE gear still had an impact in PvP but alteast PvP players were not totally destroyed by PvE players this way and had a chance to compete.
---
I like Classic a lot but I hate it when pleople shit on TBC for emotional reasons. Classic also doesn't has competitive PvP so itemization so it doesn't matter that much. The R13 and R14 items are still good items for people that wan't to take the effort.
---
TL;DR: PvE gear was better than PvP gear for PvE in 95% of the cases and PvP gear didn't had a negative impact on PvE.
---
BTW: I agree with you on the attunement part and enjoyed it very much to step from content to content (so much that I did it again on several TBC privat servers). The attunements shouldn't have been removed imo, the feeling to complete the whole T5 prequests, kill Magtheridon and finally be able to enter TK with your guild is amazing. The feeling to clear SSC and TK and now be able to enter MH even more. It creates a connection to your characters and guilds progression.
---
She’s also broadcasting her live location on a PvP server to the whole world. I understand why people stream, it sounds damn awesome honestly, but it baffles me how shocked and offended they act when they get sniped. They intentionally sabotage their game experience in exchange for revenue (a good trade) and then pikachu meme when their game experience is sub optimal.  I really can’t feel bad for these people getting endlessly ganked.
---
&gt; REEEEEE STREAMERS
---
Relax, man-child, I don't even like streamers.  Try to dial back your impotent autism fueled hate.
---
there is no moderation at all for the endless streamer promoter here and the low effort meme using non World of Warcraft images.. I wish there's more moderation to make this subreddit less painful to read thru.
---
and still no FAQ stickies on up top to answer most asked questions by fellow classic enthusiast here.
---
Your content is incredible. Keep it up dude
---
I don’t know why people complain about episodic FF7. If you want the game as it was back in day thenyou’ll need a lot of space.  FF7 was a massive game and would not hold into one disc. If they do it right it’s gonna be a massive game needing parts to complete the entire story as a remake. 
---
You’ll have a FF15 shitstorm if not done properly.
---
Then just stay invisible if you can't beat him.
---
Nobody is saying you said any of that explicitly. The context is dwarf vs other races getting raid spots and these are the points people are making. 
---
Why do you keep pointing that out?
---
I made a character with the name Tyrandé once, because I couldn’t come up with a good name. When the inspiration finally stuck me, I made another account reported my own character and got a free rename.
---
DUDE THIS IS LIKE ONE OF MY 10th FAVORITED VIDEOS ON YOU TUBE FROM SO LONG AGO!!!
---
I loved playing on a PvP server in early vanilla. For me, while leveling, fights were meaningful, usually over a node or grinding spot and usually on some level of fairness. Once The honor system became a thing I participated in the tarren mill- south shore craziness which while I remember it fondly, it’s pure nostalgia. It was so laggy that I couldn’t even see who was around me or what buttons I was actually pressing. When BGs became a popular thing, the only people left in world PvP were the miserable guys just wanting everyone else to be miserable too, hiding behind fake tough guy credos like “If it’s red it’s dead” to justify griefing like it’s some kind of dominance assertion ritual. I re rolled on a pve server and had much more fun while still getting PvP in BGs. I think you might be right, but PvP servers will definitely be way up there at launch. As the playerbase wanes, I believe you’ll see it even out quickly.
---
What about gear?
---
Go Wind Serpent with Lightning Breath and never look back.
---
Either one is a solid choice and will probably make you happy if you stick with one. Rogue is probably slightly more straightforward and will have a shallower learning curve.
---
Can’t wait to immerse myself in the world of Warcraft .
---
Hey, strong interest as well. Planning on playing druid and priest. I'm a late 20 something who really enjoys pvp and some end game content.
---
As a last name I can see it, like a Gaius Technotron or something. As a first name though, which is what I think WoW character names are supposed to be, it doesn't really work.
---
It's very likely that all the servers for each continent will be on the same battlegroup.
---
Not 99% of raids, no. From my experience it would be the case in perhaps 16/20 guilds, judging by the last three private server demographics I know.
---
99% is super exaggerated. You sound like you want it to be true.
---
Of course there are exceptions with those guilds in rare cases. If the player can convince them he is very experienced / the server health is struggling etc.
---
And the thing is that not every class has these huge differences (hunters, rogues, mages don’t. Alliance priests and warriors do).
---
What I am saying is that this is not as black and white. Perhaps a guild took in some human and nelf priests. But they only have 1-2 reliable dwarf priests. It is super common for that guild to try hard to recruit any dwarf priest they can find.
---
The real irony here is that classic is supposed to be the revival of community in wow, about the players and going on adventures with your friends. Meanwhile, there's a bunch of people that are stuck on 'but muh spreadsheets say x is better than y'. Here's a reality check; the vast majority of people won't be in hard core guilds, therefore, spreadsheets are still relevant, but they won't be the you must play this bible like some people think. Secondly, if you're playing a popular class (warrior, mage rogue, priest) and you're in a hardcore guild, you better be prepared to get gkicked when you're not meeting the expectations of your class because the spreadsheet says your dps should be 50 higher. And there's lots of mages waiting to take your spot, so when you have to find a new guild, chances are there will be some subpar talent builds there. 
---
Now, on the other hand, people need to accept that you need to be flexible. Guilds are 40 man sports teams in raids. It's great that you can play ret, but right now we really need the healing to get through this boss. Don't be the guy/ gal that refuses to help out your team solely to play your spec or like above, you will likely get gkicked.
---
It's vital to remember, this is a social game with a heavy reliance on the human element. Even if perfect balance was obtainable, you will always have people that underperform expectations. But those who are dedicated to a spec can certainly make it doable, just not cutting edge competitive. But their will be tons of try hard warriors that are not cutting edge competitive either, despite the math. So bring on the off meta specs and let us celebrate a social game reborn!
---
As you can see, this is a Night Elf Rogue using daggers. They dont have weapon skill +. This specific rogue needs 9% chance to hit in order to not miss a target which is level 63. If this was a human rogue using sword / mace, they need only 8%.
---
Except this last raid
---
I honestly think this is a genius move by blizzard. From a marketing standpoint it is all going to pan out. They get the HUGE new release expansion with TONS of exposure each year. THEN even mainstream people are gonna find out about it, through the movies (haha), and then they promote the movies AND the game. And there’s always gonna be a good game because you can ALSO play classic while they ‘fix’ the game, and learn from there mistakes. So maybe when they release WARCRAFT 2 it will be included in the sub also? So that there’s an easy transition from old to new. And all they have to do is invest in server infrastructure + marketing and it’s good to go CASH COW FOREVERRR
---
(Here is a snip of it.)[https://imgur.com/a/1c1QDpG]
---
I think if I want to be competitive you are going to regret picking undead over orc. Once you are getting gear and realizing the bonuses you are sacrificing you will want to have been orc.
---
Umm... Mekatorque. 'nuff said.
---
"Critics who treat 'adult' as a term of approval, instead of as a merely descriptive term, cannot be adult themselves. To be concerned about being grown up, to admire the grown up because it is grown up, to blush at the suspicion of being childish; these things are the marks of childhood and adolescence. And in childhood and adolescence they are, in moderation, healthy symptoms. Young things ought to want to grow. But to carry on into middle life or even into early manhood this concern about being adult is a mark of really arrested development. When I was ten, I read fairy tales in secret and would have been ashamed if I had been found doing so. Now that I am fifty I read them openly. When I became a man I put away childish things, including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up."

Guess I missed the update where they let you have a first and last name...
---
I'm trying not to ***"REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!"*** so hard right now...
---
I'd say mage would be much easier...if you're super new you will likely make mistakes by engaging in fights you think you can take but definitely can't. While as a mage you can just pew pew the hell out of people from range easily get away from them etc. Also people fucking love mages because of food/water and int buff!
---
&gt;	Nothing in the Arms or Fury tree less than 20 talents deep is so urgent to get that the 7 points in Prot will be an issue. 
---
Ok now you are trolling. At least try to be funny when you are. I admit you had me, though.

Hey, Oggzor. Great tool. However, I notice that Heal for Priests has no breakpoints. I am thinking this is a bug due to it should scale with SP

Get the fuck out of Elwynn Forest at Level 11 ASAP. Grind to level 12. Get Mage skillups. Head to Darkshore. Pray I was ahead of the pack.
---
I haven't had private server launch experience, and Vanilla was so long ago, I'm very worried about getting left behind in Elwynn as I'm a Mage who is struggling to get tags or if mob spots are farmed. (And I dont want to just explore to Level 10-12)

I didn't really expect you to debate me about the game itself. You're just parroting crap you read online and you don't really understand it.
---
Wind Serpents have a few nice benefits. Same stats as Owl, and lightning breath. But I never viewed Lightning Breath as that great, unless in very specific scenarios such as fighting a warrior/paladin or chasing a hunter with aspect of cheetah. Otherwise it is out damaged by other abilities.
---
Streamers r fine.  cultists like you r the problem
---
OUTTA THIS HOUSE!
---
I love this for some reason. Well done op.
---
&gt;You just show up and stockpile DKP and get what you want, regardless of whether you deserve it the most or not. 
---
Yeah you reward the person who will show up each night. They come for 3 months in a row they better get something they want.
---
How many tanks and healers have you geared only for them to stop playing for whatever reasons?
---
Yup, but if you want to join the good guilds with the best players and take part in duels and organised 3v3 and 5v5 competitions it'll all be happening on the one main server.
---
Yeah man hit me up tomorrow and we'll see :P
---
Wait for the server to pop up. Wait in queue for 8 hours while the server crashes every 20 minutes.
---
I like my wife, and my job. Things I never had 15 years ago. I don’t have time for vanilla again. Have fun friends.
---
Checked classic Wowhead and indeed there it says lvl 40 requirement. Might have to start using wowhead instead, for classic too.
---
And they shouldn’t exploit.
---
Not sure what retail is like now, but in Wrath and Cata we were snagging some Top 500 kills.  None of the guilds really cared about racials, at least at that level of play.  Considering there are a few thousand guilds who end up clearing that content, can’t see lower slower ranked teams considering racials either.
---
Maybe if a fight had a specific mechanic that a main tank racial would help, another tank tried the fight.  Nobody was ever permanently maimed for their racial decision.
---
&gt;You'll get good at whatever class you choose while leveling 1-60.
---
The number of bad players I've seen at max level would indicate that this statement is a lie.
---
Subtlety is nowhere to be found
---
All of that organized arena shit is nothing compared to premade vs premade.
---
Little Rabbit Foo Foo and The Name of the Rose.
---
the first wave will be hitting 60 a week after launch. "A few weeks" after them is about a month after launch. Casuals will be far far later than this
---
yes, absolutely. I prefer DKP with a decay, something like 10% decay every week
---
False.
---
Yes, please choke me Daddy Classic. My body is yours.
---
With enough "Of the Monkey" cloth gear it could work! Also grab a Aegis of Preservation and Onyxia Blood Talisman.
---
Yes, that’s the joke. We’ve all only heard it at least a million times now.
---
I'm not the one who apparently thinks Cleave stops working if you put a talent point in Prot.
---
It's comments like this that make me second-guess wanting to play a Dwarf Priest.
---
The choice, for me, is between Priest, Paladin, and Druid. I don't necessarily want to be the very best healer, but I want to have the most options as a healer. Versatile for me means being capable of AOE, burst, and sustain. The ideal healer would be primarily single-target with excellent sustain if played well, and some expensive options to burst and aoe if needed. Bonus points if the healer has solid preventative options like shields.
---
The ideal leveling scenario for me would be something challenging and that requires careful approaches with long combat encounters.
---
But if it meant I could get into groups faster, I wouldn't mind playing a different class. And since so many people are talking about how everyone should play Priests, it makes me think there will be way too many Priests. And at least Druid and Paladin are capable of tanking if I end up on a server with a billion Priests and no tanks.
---
That and so many guilds seem to be filling up with nothing but Priests.
---
"This is huge for melee dps in PVE, not a big deal in PVP"
---
This is for orc axe racial. Weapon skill has no effect in pvp. Otherwise looks accurate.
---
Keep this up and you might find yourself with a job.
---
They’re stripping it down and releasing a damn near perfect clone of classic, but while using all the new server technology and battle.net integration.
---
Yeah private servers are there but they’re usually filled with tons of glitches and discrepancies
---
[Just for you.](https://gfycat.com/delectableglamorousfiddlercrab)
---
No, it's legitimately terrible.
---
As someone that didn't play during classic, can someone explain what it is?
---
You have 30 raiders. Some a well specced rogues. A Ret says "I want to come stab things". You say "no we want well specced rogues". You go to raid with 30 raiders.
---
You are an idiot.
---
other expansion launches wouldn't open up raids immediately, there would be weeks where raids aren't available
---
It's why I typically just go with Boar. Eats everything, charges to creature to keep them where they are, tanki boi.
---
Yeah, but they can only do that once before they go on the KoS list.
---
I practice live and let live. If someone is just minding their own business questing, then I'll leave them in peace. If I'm doing the same and you attack me then I'm going to kill you every single time I get the chance, forever.

Actually this works as intended, assuming that you are over level 46. This is due to the down-ranking penalty imposed on spells, the penalty is stronger for spells learnt before level 20, but still has quite an impact after that too. Since the last rank of Heal (Rank 4) is learn't at lvl 34, this scales as a lvl 60 spell. However, rank three, which is learnt at level 28 scales as a level 33 spell.
---
If you change to level 40, you should see more ranks represented :)

Always tip your mages.

Hi, just dropping into this discussion to say that Jump Desktop’s Fluid protocol should give you solid gaming performance (30fps-60fps) depending on resolution. Plus we’ve recently added automatic resolution switching to Jump which makes it super convenient to control performance. Check it out: https://jumpdesktop.com/getfluid
---
Druids have the most mana-efficient healing in the game with rank 4 healing touch, though. They can also tank very effectively (raids, too).
---
Are you considering to do this for all spells (i.e. damage spells)
---
There might have been less demand. Most people who bought gold were probably 60, which was harder to get in vanilla compared to 70 in TBC, and more people played in TBC.
---
Gold was easier to get in TBC but there were probably more people buying it.
---
I 'member....
---
Agree to a point. 
---
I think WHAT streaming has BECOME is posionous to the gaming industry.
---
My biggest issue is streamer privlage 
---
Alot of them do it for money
---
But most want recongition. "Look how good/funny i am and acknowledge it" 
---
I dont agree they were the ones that caused most to population to not like retail wow. Thats blizzards fault for trying to appeal to everyone.
---
You are right that streamers will start stirring up the population once classic gets old
---
But it will be asking for tbc and wrath servers.
---
The color on the sword youre speaking of is likely enchantments, and can be put on most weapons.
---
I think it's the type of people who play those races. I've distinctly found that Orcs and Undead are the biggest dicks on horde side, by far. Orc shaman and rogues in particular. Whereas people who play Tauren and troll seem much more chill.
---
reminds of aan old called &lt;and two stealthed rogues&gt;
---
My buddy literally got invited to MC as a level 59 ret paladin. I think people are drastically overstating how “hardcore” and optimized everyone will approach raiding. Not everyone on retail plays like Method, and the majority of players on Classic aren’t going to be insane optimizers. That’s not to say they’ll be excited about a Boomkin, but if they just need a few bodies I doubt it’ll be that hard to find a spot somewhere.
---
Warr also has a much harder time overall, easier to kite, successful against fewer classes. Rogues at least have a chance against a mage, warr has basically 0
---
"I'm just pretending to be a douchebag"
---
Hi, /u/Hour_Hyena
---
dkp takes a lot of work.   I suspect loot council to be the default this time.  I am hesitant  to trust councils though, because everyone is biased.
---
Thanks!
---
They certainly do, but Warriors are still better tanks, and they consistently output far less HPS than other healers. 
---
I love Druids, I main one. But in vanilla the class is definitely a master of none class. Its not until TBC when HoTs could stack that they had an identity as the HoT healer.
---
That's a nice trick about flaring on your trap.
---
All the answers you seek are well documented. You could even just watch the presentation at blizzcon which answers all of this.
---
Rogue is very very skill capped class, if u master it you can be godly
---
There is literally a certain rotation to play depending on what class your fighting and who gets the opener.
---
Id go mage personally, its more direct in playstyle.
---
Is that supposed to be insulting?
---
You got emotional. i got a laugh.  win win
---
Raid boss AI and NPC AI is pretty bad
---
Blood fury (orc racial) only effects melee attack power in vanilla. Just a minor distinction in case your friend finds himself interested in orc hunter.
---
Well. You got me there then. It's not like there's a thousand ways to bait people into pvp, for one.
---
Who kneww Asmongold had an ex? So angry!!
---
Why Bite over screech?
---
Warriors are better tanks and can tank every fight. Very true, hands down. Druids, however, can progression tank at every level of content (especially MC and Ony, of course... but also Naxx. They're arguably better than warriors for MC and Ony because at that level they will likely be better-geared). But for anyone interested in playing druid, I'll link another one of my comments:

---
Well, when I played WoW before the thing I disliked about loving the game so much was that it made playing single player games much harder. So I'm excited for these games, but I'm probably going to  be knee deep in Classic for a very long time.
---
Esfand mentioned these guys on his podcast, thought it was hilarious they stunned him, stabbed him, and left him to bleed out.  
---
always gotta love when people combine some RP with their game activities
---
strip naked and drown.
---
He makes me cringe so much.
---
Exactly, if people see the slightest chance of winning, they will often go for it. Baiting into pvp is not to difficult.
---
Fuck, no wonder nobody gets any work done.
---
I thought weapon skill has a small benefit in pvp by giving more hit ? Don't you need 3% hit for pvp hitcap with 2h melee weapons?
---
thanks for the feedback
---
Yup.
---
This is actually ridiculously easy to do if you go out of your way to complete as many quests as possible before they go grey. If you do this, you should constantly have dozens of green quests to complete until you get to lvl 50+
---
mage told me that he would charge for water once, so I told him to make me 12 stacks.   After he was done, I refused to pay, and  I told him he could now give it away free.
---
That sun gets down with the get down
---
They sure can. I'm not not denying that Druids are capable of tanking raids. Just that Warriors are better as far as we currently know. 
---
Enemy parry rates are different in classic than on Pservers, so maybe Druids will be even better than people once thought as far tanking raids goes.
---
If you plan on farming it a lot, I’d suggest setting your hearth to Shadowprey Village, once you’re done killing Princess / rotgrip, invite someone you know or a random to your group, then leave party. It’ll take 1min to kick you to your hearth location, then run back and reset the instance, rinse and repeat
---
That'll be interesting to see. I just don't want people to be discouraged thinking that druids are teh suxxs and can't do anything. Even cat dps is viable (not optimal, but viable).
---
You remember druids with 30k HP? Ya I'm not even sure that's theoretically possible at any stage in vanilla.
---
Does this work for someone who is outside of the instance?
---
Depends. If you have space to kite, especially by abusing pathing, it's actually quite possible to kill many elites that can't be slowed.
---
My question is if I do this do I have to set everything back to default if I go back to my computer then? I'm not the most CPU inclined anymore. Thanks for your help in advance
---
looking at wowhead right now, says it was added in patch 1.11.1
---
You are lying.
---
Where's the option to jump in circles on top of the bank?
---
The person in your group does not have to be in the instance with you to get you a “ghetto hearth” they just need to be in you party. 
---
The person outside of the instance will not be affected at all, they won’t be hearthed or anything of the like.
---
I edited my comment like a thousand times, apologies lol
---
Hunter is by far the easiest class to solo any elite with. This is pretty much an indisputible fact. Hunters can solo dungeon bosses, mages and warlocks mostly cannot. Anything a mage or lock can kill, a hunter can too, and easier. The same is not true in reverse.
---
I got my answer now. Thanks bro!
---
Thanks, really appreciate the info.
---
I’d love to see an artistic representation of what the cities/towns/outposts canonically look like.. similar to the scale of Stormwind during Old Soldier. Just a picture of the whole town of Thelsamar, or what a bustling Bloodhoof Village looks like.

Ok snowflake. Enjoy your pve server
---
You can't just go around calling all of them "Goblin", that's racist.
---
The first time i saw that clip of them ganking that level 30 warrior(?) out of nowhere i was in fucking tears laughing. It was so fucking funny, and i could imagine being that guy getting ganked just flipping the fuck out in disbelief of what just happened to me. So damn good.
---
True dat. Although I will say that I thought the Argent Tournament was a really cool way of making dailies interesting.
---
Lol these guys are funny
---
Giving your character a first and last name is pretty common for most races when RPing.
---
&gt; Getting 40 decent players together at the same place at the same time
---
40 *decent* players = overkill, considering that 20 decent players was all that was needed to get bosses down. The rest of the raid was usually filled with drooling cows.
---
If the "theory" about the keyring not showing up until certain specific keys have been acquired is true then some testing should be done to determine which early keys would trigger the keyring. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqt_YqvEZkM) of a lvl35 with the keyring showing up is either from 1.11 or 1.12. What keys can one get at lvl35 that would trigger the keyring to appear, I wonder.
---
General out door aoe, stratholmes aoe (need 2-3x), brd, DM east and north, elites at WEPL for crusader enchants
---
Provide more beta access you bums
---
Lets entertain your idea.... Yes Priest is actually the worst tank in the game. Every other class in theory could take a hit or two and some can even offtank for some time where Priest would fold in one hit? maybe two? They have the least amount of avoidance and effective HP out of all classes.
---
You can if you grind a level killing humanoids once in a while.
---
I don’t know why but tanking I’ve always been good at. Fury is really fun but the fantasy of playing classic with the all time dream goal of thunderfury has my determination set.
---
"We own the world, you fucking peasants, lol".
---
Yeah but I mean he just doesnt care anymore hes having fun, he's had his time and he knows it.
---
The only thing I dislike about Screech is when it aggroes nearby yellow mobs when I'm grinding. I wouldn't use Owls for anything other than leveling though. Cats are just way too good at endgame.
---
Apparently they're just as sick of it as we are.
---
I think you misread the OP. He wants an add-on similar to Quest Helper, but one that ONLY shows locations of Quest Givers rather than Quest Objectives.
---
Essentially, a way to be able to guide you along the way, without completely breaking the immersion of reading the quest to figure out where to go and what to do.
---
This is true, but they do have very strong damage mitigation stats, and the ability to both proc heals and heal themselves which I feel offsets the lack of dodge and shield block.
---
Loot council is rough in Vanilla unless you are in the most serious of the hardcore guilds that know exactly what they are doing and everyone buys in.  Loot council can kill casual or even semi-hardcore guilds, better off going with a fair and transparent DKP system, no drama, simple.
---
You've got quite a setup here. I'd recommend trying out the steam link app instead of chrome remote desktop. Steam link seems optimized with lower latency in mind. Good work!
---
Screech for leveling (includes leveling dungeons).
---
I'd use cats for everything else.
---
I'm not sure if it's wrong but as long as the 1st step in the chain says lvl 40, then all the following steps will be accessible upon completing the prior steps. Not sure why classicDB shows each step at different levels, is this how they do it on pservers? Or maybe even how it was done in vanilla? I don't even recall getting locked out of a quest step because of my level but I could be wrong.
---
They do about 60% of regular dps (from mage or warlock) and a shadow weaving holy priest will do 90% of regular priest healing.
---
So having easier replacement, more efficiency, 1 more debuff slot, better gear distribution (a lot of stuff shadow priests want is very good on other classes) there is no reason to have a shadow priest if you are going for optimal raid composition.
---
Mara farming will be doable, people were resetting RFC during the stress test using a lvl 1 alt.
---
&gt; all other things equal, there's no reason not to go with the Dwarf.
---
Not true, the human racial of 5% spirit gives a tangible healing performance boost - both for the mana and also the +healing from Spiritual Guidance.
---
It's his personally that does it, not that he's old or anything (I'm old, too).
---
You're a god among poopers.
---
Ahh yes, i should have put that distinction, thanks for the feedback!
---
I miss that from Everquest.

Not really seeing the problem. Are you trying to argue you weren't trolling with that post? It had nothing constructive or factual in it.
---
Yeah, but none this long-winded. 
---
*casually writes a novella about being casual*
---
even if this was the entire story, unless you are providing more proof as to why it's wrong than they have to prove it's right, your post servers no purpose other than cause noise and start arguments. Not to mention you contradict yourself, making it seem immediately like a troll - 
---
&gt;We want a game where you need to use CC and coordinate a bit and actually have the threat of death around you
---
versus
---
&gt;Bring back the authentic Vanilla challenge
---
you can have a new game where you're forced to CC stuff and mobs hit like trucks, or you can have 1.12 vanilla, where that stuff is optional past a certain point of gear/skill/coordination. "Reason: Trolling" indeed.
---
Not a problem on the superior faction
---
Shit I meant easiest to hardest my bad
---
How so? Were they using /camp or "ghetto hearth"
---
I only disagree with your last sentence.  DKP is clearly the more fair option.  Yes you can't frontload all the loot to your top performers, but everyone is putting in the same amount of time, you might have players that just flat out aren't as good as everyone else, but the loot is spread fairly as they are putting in the same amount of time as everyone else.
---
So Screech AP reduction does virtually noting in PVP. Unlike PVE players have a lot of AP and smaller damage multipliers. 
---
Bite is nice since it is helps spell pushback on casters. Cats have the fastest attacks speed and no screech so for PVP you want fast attacks. 
---
Every other bet just lacks the Utility.
---
It’s an abbreviation of dragon kill points, you kill a boss, you get points.
---
Loot drops that you want, you bid against everyone else that wants it with points.
---
Old school currency system guilds use to distribute loot.
---
Ohh. You're right then, lol.
---
You get points for participating in raids, you spend them on loot.
---
So how did they keep track of who had what points?
---
First thing I thought.
---
Good luck hiding with even one priest on the enemy team.
---
Try watching a few dungeons on stream and tell me what you think of the difficulty.  You couldn't run dungeons 8 levels higher than you and chain pull with no deaths non-stop in Vanilla.  I don't think its unreasonable to discuss and compare the gameplay between Vanilla and Classic.
---
I used to heal so definitely know how it feels to screw up and have the blame fall on me!
---
It would be different if you just come on here and say hey check my video out. Since it's obviously you
---
Fur-suit best in slot
---
You were right it was indeed Original Sin, I was one of the 6 that left and went over to magtheridon. OS killed Thaddius before Nihilum for what it’s worth. Tbh the guild died before we moved as we had 3 priests quit within about a week of each other, so we got cockblocked for razuvius mind controls and gothik shackles. Os was already a merge guild of the 2 best on genjuros horde so was nobody else good or geared enough to recruit. It wasn’t that we left OUR guild when we were smashing it and things were going good, things had gone to shit before we put it out of its misery haaaaa
---
Asmon doesnt even make those videos himself some random dude does so you can't blame him
---
Yo is there someway we can have a warrior (fury/arms) bis list, only found Druid and casters
---
Yeah, gotta say I feel lucky to enjoy healing. Was forced into it in vanilla on my shaman, but prefer the role now. Gonna main a troll priest, and my main alt will either be druid or shaman for grinding...  
---
That said, I've done all 3 roles throughout my years in WoW, and DPS is still enjoyable. Tanking was fun in Karazhan/Ulduar...can't remember much else being fun, though.
---
I am, damage spells just work a little bit different, which make them harder to tune. Also, I can't think of any damage spells that are downranked in raids, some lower ranks could be used for shorter cast time, but usually the level penalty is too high for downranking to be viable from a dps point of view.
---
But if an interest is shown for some damage spells these might be added :)
---
But there are so many quests that you never need to grind for a single second (aside from quest items) if you don't want to. Grinding might be more efficient, but personally I like the challenge and reward of doing all the quests.
---
o ok
---
Logout inside instance--&gt;log on lvl 1 alt--&gt;reset instances--&gt;log back on main at the entrance of the instance, inside the instance. I think they were in a raid for that.
---
Ok dude acting hard about a video game.
---
Trying to get mine back now (lodged a ticket), pretty sure last time I logged onto it was about 2010. I sold the account and it has probably had email / name changed etc. so I don't like my odds. Have a human priest that had a nelf mount (very fkn hard back in vanilla) and my beloved hunter with all sorts of goodies.
---
They have BiS gear. Try and understand that they or you won't have that when vanilla launches.
---
That's because the level cap is 40. When the level cap is 60 IF will become the main hub.
---
Use two spells than wand while face tanking the mob as a cloth wearer...  Next time you wanna talk about how easy it is to level you should probably make it past the starting area
---
Horde has less people wearing shoes, and way more tusks and horns. You can't underestimate that.
---
many guilds were still using DKP even in legion so...yeah its definetly going to return.
---
Europeon?
---
I was in this guild back in the day haha. I joined just shortly before they cleared BWL so I didn’t get to be a part of this video, but awesome to see it again!
---
Horde Scum
---
were entire groups of twinks running dungeons together back then? there's nothing to compare this beta meta to, other than end game content like lvl 60 5- and 10-mans becoming trivialized as even a small amount of gear was gathered. (compare your first UBRS run to your 50th.... your tank will be in berserker stance with a 2h or DW at least up until Rend)
---
No, I don't think he was.
---
It was usually someone who was master looter kept an add on or journal to keep track. I seem to remember it being somewhat automated, when a piece of loot dropped you wanted, you would whisper the master looter how many points you wanted to spend on the loot. With the DKP system we used, if you bid higher than the second highest person, you only spent 1 more than their highest bid. This of course led people to bid outrageous amounts just to fuck you out of a lot of DKP
---
Tanks main problem is not spell damage but physical crits (200% DMG) and crushing blows (150% DMG). 
---
Maybe if you go Shadow and imp inner fire you could take a few hits..... 
---
Without active mitigation and Oh shit buttons you are liek a weaker version of a ferral tank, except they have Taunt, AOE attacks, and work off rage..... plus they have WAY more armor. 
---
But again a crit and a crush from a raid boss would just level you just like it does a feral.
---
Ok snowflake
---
Glad to help, pretty cool of you to put all this info together for a friend.
---
I'm sure you enjoy BFA and that's fine its just not everyones cup of tea
---
When you're twinked to hell the dungeons are trivial.  I leveled a panda monk  when mop came out.  Almost all dungeons.  I didn't pull rooms.  I pulled like half the instance, and the boss, and aoe'd it down.
---
In a raid with who?
---
&gt; aboit
---
I'm playing classic on a private server, as well as TBC on another, which has no p2w shop or anything, just the pure vanilla experience.
---
I'm enjoying this a whole lot more than the last time I returned to Legion and got to 45 on a toon after 3 days of playing. 
---
And it's not like I'm talking about the greatness of Vanilla as if every aspect was better than today.
---
Vanilla was a great success, which has changed the world of games in a manner no other game has ever done before that. Regardless of whether I was part of it or not.
---
I don't quit when things go hard on me, I have 3 boys.
---
And whether you remember or not, TBC had to be reached through vanilla content which was still challenging, and still had pre 40 quests where you would travel through 2 continents by foot, and get killed a varying number of times on the way whether by allies or by wandering mobs.
---
TBC had all that.
---
So you are watching streamers who are decked out in full bis gear smash dungeons and assume that this is the norm? I assume you have a reference point to validate your claims? Which client are you using to compare? I am afraid without any reference point you are just making noise
---
You'd have to do something to work around it. If you're playing on a Vanilla WoW client atm, you can make a copy of your WoW folder and make the changes to one of them and use one for desktop and one for mobile.
---
This is what my 'hardcore' guild used on pservers and it worked amazingly well
---
Do it and post a review. Bet it'd hit top of the feed.
---
I haven't played on PS, but from what ive read the latest theorycrafting is that stamina is king and avoidance is not as important.  If I can stack stam and just be a massive health pool, I think between self healing and heals on me I should be able to stay up.  I do like your IF suggestion though, I might try to work that into the spec.
---
They were? I guess master looter was still an option?
---
We had Onyxia, MC, AQ20 and ZG pretty much on farm  and was messing around with BWL, Naxx and AQ40.
---
With that said, we were not the most geared out as we had the worst luck with drops and RNGesus screwing us over.
---
I felt we had about average to barely above average healers, and we had very good dps who all loved to theorycraft and use spreadsheets and loved reading on ElitestJerks... and this made our tanks have to bust their asses to keep up.
---
The warrior tanks were above average and that bear tank was just a great player I guess and used all the tricks in the book and was luckt cherry picking his gear to reach the stats he had.
---
I will link to this post here, I feel it might be useful as well.

Casual is up to 3 hours a session and no more than 2-3 times a week. This is sufficient for some raiding, but you don't get to kill the heroic raids. I only made it to heroic gunship in ice-crown citadel, and even got the shield from that fight for my warrior.
---
I made it to 22% health of the lich king, but didn't kill him.
---
That is casual for me. 
---
A non casual would have killed arthas normal.
---
I was working 40, raiding 20 and playing otherwise for farming for raiding and alt raids.  My friends used to randomly show up to drag me to social events.  It was a good time.
---
Does your wife take care of chores and kids? I could never make 2 hours a day of wife/kids time work assuming that includes time spent cooking/cleaning the house/laundry/groceries/dog walking etc. 
---
I work about the same amount as you and feel like I can rarely get 2 hours in per day. Some days sure but not every day.
---
2 things make this possible, 1 the streamers and majority of their party are wearing gear that is above the content, I.E instance blues, not quest rewards. 2 patch 1.12 was towards the end of vanilla and is the result of multiple damage tuning passes. 
---
Add on top of the above the players having 10-15 years of play experience over what the average or even above average player has when patch 1.12 was current. 
---
Was Vanilla hard, no, was it time consuming, absolutely.   
---
Another variable to add is nostalgia, we all want to believe it was harder to make ourselves feel justified in sinking so much time into it. Anyone that argues this creates mental discordances and we try to rationalize why we are right and prove it was in-fact harder, when truth be told it wasn’t.
---
Tell me this is a troll post
---
Masterloot was removed in BFA.
---
Gutripper MH, Lifeforce Dirk OH should be best probably. 
---
80 topend vs 75top end damage.
---
So about 350ish players per race starting zone with the exception of Dwarve/Gnome and Orce/Troll being expected double that number.  
---
Ouch, still going to be brutal, especially with the "Fetch X" quests, where per monster drops for only 1 player. Those could last ages due to competition.
---
I believe they werent in early classic, but might be wrong.
---
No, I was never forced to play a spec in my guild as a hunter. We didn't have gear checks or anything since we were going to play with who we liked playing with, regardless of the outcome. I do remember bankrolling the guild repairs for a bit, but it was worth it.
---
No problem 👍🏼
---
I think other classes are better for that job
---
Oh thank god. I can start my verbal countdown.
---
Honestly I think barrens is one of the more poorly designed experiences in classic. It sucks to spend so much time in the same type of zones when leveling most horde races, and barrens is a huge reason for that. The questing experience in barrens just flat out sucks - always has. Humans on the other hand have a pretty enjoyable leveling experience, changing zones more frequently and the zones are better designed.
---
Or he could just wait a couple of minutes until another person asks for water and is willing to pay for it.
---
I agree with you that in the past it was true. However, gamer in general are much better than in the past (click cast players in raiding). But bad players will still exist.
---
One because you forgot you never set your home anywhere else and port back to the starting zone instead of where you wanted and then you delete that damn cursed stone and gain an inventory slot!

The most significant factor no doubt is the stealth ability, which is incredibly powerful. It's the best ability in the game to 'decide what terms i want this fight to happen', and so for that reason rogues are a very safe clase to play in general.

"regularly clears" because the first ones will definitely go to mages, locks and druids because you can get benediction/anathema instead... or you will be given maces+offhands.
---
Hell yea. Classic is gonna be tits.
---
People did SPriest tanking for shits and giggles back in Vanilla.

We also did MC with a SPriest MT as well.
---
Im sure you said nothing bad at all, and just got a random ban for a single post about dungeon difficulty. Seems legit.
---
You wouldn't want to insult your mom.
---
1.12 is the earliest data set they have.
---
No idea, if you can use Chrome Remote Desktop or Steam Link on iOS I'd see no reason it wouldn't work.
---
They ganked everyone.
---
Not sure what you mean. Azeroth is the planet where wow classic is set.
---
From my memory crossroads were a great place for horde vs alliance battles.   Local defences needed . Etc.. great place
---
Is the new build a newly theorycrafted build and it's just never been tested? Or does it just have such high gear requirements that the barrier for entry is such that only a handful of rets will be able to use it?
---
In other words, could this Ret build pull off comparatively competition numbers as Mourtagh using something like BWL-era gear?
---
If there's a gap in theory and all rets are just rolling up with AP garbage builds, that's one thing. But if Ret requires a hyper specific set of conditions to be worth a raid slot, I'd still argue that it's not viable since only the 99th percentile can play it.
---
Fuck it, count me in too
---
 I want to be optimistic and hope that Blizzard will change their stance on this, just like they did with the 4 phase content plan they originally proposed.
---
Exactly like the other user has said. In a raid with their own level 1 alt. You'd need a guildie/friend to set it up, but after that, you're set.
---
This size was 108usd. See my other [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bz1oso/finally_got_myself_a_classic_azeroth_map_on/eqqrjxf).
---
If you are just flat out downvoting me because you disagree with me pointing out your 99% is exaggerated, I am not even going to read your reply.
---
&gt; Dude, I had a guy building a group for Wailing Fucking Caverns that refused a dps slot to a priest. Like, he sat there in chat, spamming "LF1M", wasting his and 3 more people's time, all because "shadow priests are trash dps". Yeah, at lvl 19, when most of your caster dps comes from your fucking wand. 
---
 I bet he's the kind of guy who would ask for a 1000 io score for a +4 Freehold.
---
How exactly do streamers "benefit" from "poisoning" the game industry? I thought it was better game industry more ppl watch streamer play? more moneyz? 
---
A government as a corporation does not care about people but it cares about taxes. More ppl more Taxes. So streamers may not care about the community but if they are able to build one around them they get Moneyz ....
---
Streamers are not some kind of hive mind, I am pretty sure they don't have illuminate type meetings where whey all agree what to say and do. They are a bunch or random individuals playing a bunch or random games. If they make a statement about a game you don't agree with it does not make it false. 
---
So let me get it straight..... Streamers told you not to play the game they are playing because it is shit, but pls keep watching them play the above mention shit game??? How does that work again?
---
It is not illegal to change your mind, opinion, point of view. The definition of hypocrisy is when a person makes a post with a lot of false arguments accusing other of false arguments. 
---
I am not sure what you do for a living but have you considered stock market with you amazing predictive abilities. If you know Classic will fail feel free to short Blizz stock. You will be rich.
---
Everything in there "for my money". That is how economics works. Read Adam Smith The Wealth of Nations.
---
To add a new perspective, "farming" is just another word for "playing". Few players will complain about having to do quests to unlock items... from what I've seen, much of the classic crowd LOVE cumbersome and long quest gates. And much of the classic game is about killing a limited number of mobs to get gear.
---
What makes dailies unique, is the word "daily", not the fact that they are repeatable. If you're playing a game and want to get a certain rare drop, you can repeatedly do dungeons over and over and over again until you get that dungeon. It's the same content, but you decided you wanted to get that item, so you worked to get it. No matter how little or how much you play, you're always making progress towards that same goal.
---
But now let's say you want a reward that drops from dailies. You can't just repeat that content until you get your item. You can do a few dailies and then the game forces you to stop and wait until some arbitrary amount of time is up before you get to continue playing your game that you already paid to play.
---
So let's say you want the reward from dailies and the reward from doing some other content, let's say dungeons. How do you prioritize which you want to do? Do you do the most fun activity? Well you could, but what if you run out of dungeon rewards and now have to do dailies to proceed? If you let that happen, you'll be unable to play the game more than a couple hours a day doing dailies. That sounds absolutely miserable... so people do their dailies first so that they run out of dailies before they run out of other content.
---
Raids could work the same way, but there are a few differences. The first difference is that raids take much longer to complete. Most people don't have time to do all the raids that could benefit them more than once per week. There is a second factor as well, in that lock-outs heavily discourage players from leaving a raid part-way through. Everyone wants their raid-mates to stick it out till the end, so it's better if everyone suffers a little by being locked out of leaving so that everyone can benefit. And a third factor is that if you have enough time to attempt multiple raids per week, it didn't take you forever to reach max level either. You have enough time to level multiple characters to max level without too much fuss. And then you can do as many raids per week as you want. Contrast with players who only play for 5 hours a day, twice a week, who almost certainly don't feel like making a whole new character or two just to pass time waiting for dailies...
---
I like the sentiment, but very few people played AV back in it's original form.  The BG had 10 times the population after they nerfed it.
---
Didnt the AV changes happen in 2.3.0?
---
Joining the streamer servers, they easily organize the biggest and coolest raids...you can always check streams to find out where some cool pvp fights are!
---
Questing in the barrens right now on private server &amp; didn't understand why there was so much hate. Sure the chat is toxic but I still liked the place. Glad to see more barrens love!
---
It's very good. It far exceeds any alternatives and is BIS in MC. 
---
In BWL, technically [Lok'amir il Romathis](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19360) + [Master Dragonslayer's Orb](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19366) might be a tiny bit better - but this is totally unrealistic since Lok'amir will be given to other healers (due to the avilability of Benediction for priests) and Nef head will be given to melee for the ring. Depending on when they release AV, Lok'amir + [Lei of the Lifegiver](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19312) is tangibility (albeit still small) better than Benediction, but again you'll have a hard time taking the mace from other healers. Also, depending on when they release honor, the rank 14 mace and OH are significantly better, but healers/casters pretty much never go for r14 and stop at r13 once they have their full epic PvP set. And rank 14 is not a realistic grind for pretty much any player to make (often approximated as 3 months of 10+ hours a day). 
---
Realistically, priests won't replace Benediction until AQ patch, when they can obtain the AQ20 mace [Gavel of Infinite Wisdom](https://classicdb.ch/?item=21410). This can be paired with AV Lei until you manage to get a [Sartura's Might](https://classicdb.ch/?item=21666) in AQ40 for a slight upgrade. Alternatively you could go for the AQ40 staff [Blessed Qiraji Augur Staff](https://classicdb.ch/?item=21275) but the Imperial Qiraji Regalia needed to make this is, in my experience, quite rare indeed and it will be contested with casters for their staff [Blessed Qiraji Acolyte Staff](https://classicdb.ch/?item=21273). And besides, the dream in AQ40 phase is to get the C'Thun mace [Scepter of the False Prophet](https://classicdb.ch/?item=21839) since this thing is just bonkers nuts and far exceeds all alternatives.
---
Once Naxx rolls around you have some more options though. I was going to explain them all, but I just realised you probably don't care at all since you only wanted to know whether Benediction is good (although I could keep going if anyone does care :p). I will just finish here by saying yes its quite good and you can definitely expect to see priests using this staff into AQ or sometimes maybe even Naxx. 
---
Oh and final bonus note: you are able to use the staff (on a 30m CD) to transform it into [Anathema](https://classicdb.ch/?item=18609) which is also a similarly good staff for shadow priests - especially in PvP as it has a lot of stam on it.
---
I think this is the biggest point. Anyone concerned about rogue over paladin is pretending they have a full 41 people and it's time to decide who has to sit. That seems unlikely to be an issue.
---
Well two problems are there was never any shredders or mine fields in av.
---
I actually remember level 55's farming harpies for exp.
---
Vanilla AV was ok. Best to farm HKs but not honor lol
---
I'm rolling a rogue to ninja loot. I was way too nice 13 years ago. I want people to /spit on me when I go into towns.
---
Remote desktop is possible, so that should have no problems in that case, thanks! Gonna help out with some upkeep when im not at the pc lol
---
Emerald Dream was the best RP server. So many fond memories.
---
Oh I seeeeeeee, thanks yall.
---
What did he do to u lol
---
cheats
---
Fine, but you said “nobody wants a druid”, as if they are blacklisted and people will groan when you join (like a prot pally in a raid). They may not be absolutely ideal (and that’s assuming all classes/specs players are geared and skilled equally), but they’re perfectly capable at performing well in the right role.
---
Looks like you'll have to get your epic epic PVP wishes fulfilled in the form of planned server World PVP events.
---
I hate gnomes
---
It's not yours anymore, you sold it. Taking it back is the wrong thing to do.
---
I thought they all had a chance to drop it.
---
You can have fun, a lot of the meme specs like Enh sham and Ret pally are really fun. Vanilla Spriest still remains one of my most favorite specs to this day.
---
Just don't expect a raid spot. It's improbable that you'll be the one exception out of 40.
---
I remember difficulty directly related to levels. Night and day if your a couple levels behind or over.
---
Okay whatever
---
Mate, I ain't picking on any specific youtuber. I'm just mocking how the majority of youtubers do their videos; WoW or otherwise.
---
Nope!
---
Yeah I really like my OH it's the one that can cast a slowing frostbolt from the last guy in BFD. Lifeforce dirk is far far better though
---
#r00fles!!
---
I'll probably work on something like this when classic comes out. Doubt I'll get any invites as I haven't been subscribed for years
---
I'm dumber now. Thanks.
---
but 30sec per kill ain't happening.  Travel, eat, and where r u getting gear?  Pray the mobs you're killing keep dropping upgrades?
---
Meme specs like ret pally are actually pretty strong in PvP. It's just the getting gear part which will most likely come from raiding. It's improbable that you won't be healing in raids.
---
That makes you an a****** LOL
---
Is it just me or is nothing happening in this clip...?
---
Same boat as me fam, still hyped though.
---
Wow, thanks those are useful videos, I never saw one of our tanks doing dualwielding instead of shields, interesting stuff. I'll add some stuff about druid tanking into my overview.
---
There's nothing particularly special about down ranking, one rank will have the best healing per mana the highest rank will have the most oomph.
---
Not only are they protecting all Horde streamers, they literally have 2 streamers in their group.
---
tbf, he wanted a lot for it.  Almost vendor $.
---
Bit of both. Some new tech got discovered in the form of Shadow Oil+MCP stacking, that lets ret opt for spellpower. It's not gear prohibitive at all, but needs effort to farm a few key consumes, and it relies on them pretty heavily. Prebis builds are currently simming to be competitive with warrior and rogue, but itemization is worse in MC for Spelladin than Fury or Combat. by the end of t2, full judgement is solid. We kind of flatline in AQ40 and dont get any major upgrades there, Avengers just sets up our mana sustain for Naxx. In Naxx we get Exorcism and Holy Wrath and start fucking again. 
---
In Prebis we cap out our sim at 500~ for a pull. Warriors with similar setups can hit 600, rogues can hit 515. Warrior DPS is janky and hard to test due to Execute. 
---
Hypothetically the build is about 10% worse than rogue in raw personal throughput against non-undead mobs in the early days, but the gap widens as both Warrior and Rogue have better scaling through better itemization. In BWL we've simmed and tested for about 600-650 DPS. Our base kit doesn't scale as well as Rogue, but we get two full spells in Naxx which puts us back in our place. Testing under similar conditions has Spelladin in Prebis doing 490 sustained, Rogue has 515 sustained, and Warrior has 530 sustained with 600+ execute. 
---
Mage and warlock swap places, but Paladin DPS is always 4th or 5th out of 8 alliance classes. We always lose to Warrior and Rogue, Mage early, Lock late, but we always beat hunter, priest, druid, lock early, and mage late. It's not a t1 spec really, but it's 
---
In the prebis on the instant 60 server I can sustain an indefinite 235 without consumables, without engineering, without MCP, without enchants, against boss level mobs. This build is hyper-reliant on Shadow Oil to give us the extra spell coefecient, and Dragonbreath Chilli on non-fire immune bosses. 
---
For players unwilling to farm MCP, I've personally simmed a prebis build using ONLY shadow oil and Dragonbreath for consumes, with a more permanent weapon, that ends up simming at 435 DPS for &gt;5m.  Count disconect, mechanics, and player error and you're looking at high 390s for your average SP paladin who farms 2-3 consumes per life and doesnt want to use MCP as their weapon. 
---
From my understanding and sim work, the issue with Paladin DPS is literally as simple as 'people are playing a retarded AP build instead of stacking Spellpower'.
---
Search goldshire 4 FedEx should come up with a Reddit post and Google docs link.
---
It's not the most practical thing in the world. You can definitely hit 5 in about 40minutes in the starting zone but if you did the starting zone quests at level 4 you still get full exp for the quest turn ins but the efficiency goes down because the mobs give far less exp. Less time if you are anything but warrior.
---
I've been working on a program to map out quest and mob kills so I've got a lot of stuff in my head on this. It's at least another 6-7weeks out from completion but if I can get .json to cooperate be output friendly so I can retrieve and modify information it might come out faster.
---
Lets talk about the self healing..... if you go shadow, there is no self healing. The 25% heal over 6 sec after getting a critical strike??? Lets say you get crit for 2K so you will heal 500 or 250 every three seconds .... I am not sure it will really help the healers.
---
You cant "stack" HP since you are kind of limited by itemization, no gems to play around with. So you kind of have a similar HP pool as any other priest with similar gear. Keep in mind it is NOT about stamina but about effective HP. For example extra 150 armor translates into say 50 HP because it reduces damage by 1% and you have a total of 5000 HP. So it is a bit of min/max game to find the optimal items that give you the best effective life.
---
Last but not least Threat. Tanking is not only about surviving but also keeping the mob on you. You only have one high threat ability, Mind blast, on a longish CD. So that means for you to hold AGRO you need to do the most amount of DPS or heavily rely on other to dump their threat. Also shadow Priest have no mana recovery mechanic for a longer fight. 
---
If you want to try tank as a cloth wearer even warlock is better because of SL.
---
Kind of a relief im not the only one scared for whats about to come, I cant afford throwing days and weekends on videogames anymore, its sad.
---
Promised myself I will take it slow and explore with my friends and just try to play as casual as possible, throw in an all nighter here and there, what am I even saying I wont be able to do just that fuck.
---
For me it's Darkshore.
---
It's just the first place I really remember going too with my first character, which was a hunter. Don't think I ever leveled him over 30.
---
But I remember Auberdine so well. Being amazed that I could take a boat and go somewhere else with that.
---
Also, I remember being so pissed with Cataclysm cause they destroyed something which I had such fond memories of. Darkshore just wasn't the same place anymore. My first memories got burned and destroyed by that damn dragon.
---
They are neutral. Only one cartel allied itself with the Horde.
---
9000 percent irrelevant, if you don't want to pay you don't ask for it
---
I'm gonna tank as enhancement shaman and if you wanna be a doody head about it then you can suck my farts
---
Not gonna happen. 
---
This has been beaten to death on the forums and on here. They have the statistics that showed more people played AV after the change, and they’re sticking with it. Nobody wants hours long queues for AV just so you can have your epic battles.
---
Good question actually I have no clue. I’m actually just at my computer right refreshing the launcher every couple mins till the 27th, I’ll let you know
---
A friend of my moves only with his mouse and use his WASD as keybinds to spells as well as combining those with SHIFT+ and CONTROL. 
---
As a beginner I recommend start using "QERTFX" buttons and if you feel more comfortable start using those in combination of SHIFT and CTRL.
---
Speaking of which was that a bug, feature, or something else? I remember relying on that to avoid the wetlands death March and occasionally getting teleported to Ashenvale
---
You're welcome
---
I remember reading a bit about Spellret Paladins recently, but I can't find it again. Do you have a link to some info on it now that it's more flushed out? Thanks
---
Can you tip with a buff?
---
I used to play top 10 US in retail. Races won’t matter at all, as you can easily beat someone out just by being better. The important thing is playing something you enjoy. We’re talking about a 1 or less percent difference, so theoretically your dps would go up by like 6 in the worse scenario, but which will never matter.
---
So your screenshot is a text document? 
---
Totally couldn’t edit that at all. 
---
Blizzard doesn’t just ban dissenting opinions. You must have done something else.
---
I'd go with Troll for flavor; you will be more unique and  thus you will be more recognizable. 
---
Mechanically, while Human is optimal w/ weapon skill racials, Trolls offer some fun/unique benefits: Berserking is great for threat and tanking you'll get more use out of the increased speed based on low health. HP gain from Regeneration generates threat, plus Warriors have innately high regen rates in Classic which will stack well with Regeneration. Beast Slaying will offset some of the difficulty Warriors have with leveling.
---
While Humans are mechanically optimal, Troll flavor is fun, have some unique benefits, and you'll stand out.
---
17 days played to 60, I can’t wait for August omgggg

Gotta have a will of arlokk for low mana and staff of dominance for the extra max mana for your first cast
---
The more I see these the more I worry that these are really Blizz employees trying to test the water for WoW mobile being the phone game that's in development currently.
---
Inb4 WoW mobile announced at blizzcon this year. Complete with everything except for follower missions...that part you still have to do in the normal game.
---
I can't understand what he said.
---
Eh, I think it depends on the level of the mage and what you are asking for. I would personally give a lot of free food and water to people way lower level than myself, but people specifically asking me for something I would usually expect a small tip of some kind. Even if they gave me a gold or so, they were still saving A LOT of money from not buying from the vendor.
---
"Oomph" ? Could you explain?

---
Just install add-on, it's not hard at all.
---
Just remember, the mind control helmet fails alot and sometimes the opponent gets control of your character instead. It's far from reliant, hence why it isn't used in raids.
---
But when it works, it's very fun!
---
Having used both at Officer and Member levels, I strongly prefer DKP over loot counseling.
---
As a member, loot council feels about as good as rolling on items, you go into raid with basically no expectations, with the exception of the very few times that you know youre "up" for something. As an officer, I hate placing values on things thats probably a lot different to the person receiving it.
---
For DKP, the element of control over what youre spending feels so much better, yes you might be low on DKP, but hey, people might not be biding that night and you get away with something at low cost anyway. You know exactly where you stand on DKP priority and dont get blindsided when you get passed over for the next guy because one officer remembered that one time you missed a progression run and forgot about all the wipes the other guy has caused.
---
I find loot council just really awful for morale. DKP gives you control and things to look forward to.
---
Yeh dont do this.
---
Boars hive bite, so bite
---
Why I won't be leveling horde in classic lol

Expecting maturity from someone named ebola burrito.

Regarding the mob spawn, I think it’s quite normal to have a pack of mob Resp awning at the same time. From what I remember each any has an individual respawn timer, so if the whole pack was AOE killed for example, they should respawn at the same time.
---
Regarding Bag’thera, 40 minutes seems really long...
---
I got gamepass on PC, and you have the option to buy every game outright, so I would assume so.
---
I don't think anyone thinks
---
&gt;they will get geared from WPvP in a hot minute
---
Of course, it will be even more grindy than BG ranking. Doesn't mean people won't do it.
---
But you're right, perhaps groups will be smaller and even possible to outplay as a "pug".
---
5pm CDT August 26 in the US

I think they mean oomph like it’s an onomatopoeia for having a hard hitting heal
---
&gt;they don't want to *pay for the people to* deal with the tickets
---
yea  for me i dont see the hype, i dont know if they are "brainwashed" per-say but i will say that it doesnt seem like it'll be as fast as they claim, BUT i will be getting this founders edition of stadia, 130$. when it comes in november ill see if it was a waste of money or not lol
---
ClassicDB has never been good,.and IIRC wasnt even used much in classic anyhow.
---
WoWheads database is solid, the only issue is all the bloat on the website and advertisements.
---
lol thanks
---
You can skip half of it and just go to Silverpine Forest  and then to Ashenvale a bit early and Stonetalon Mountains also has quests staring as low as lvl 15.
---
there is lots of overlap
---
sounds good. I will be getting the 130 dollar founders edition, so i'll see what its like when it comes in November, but i will say i remain skeptical at best. AND i hope that wow will be playable on these. main reason im so hyped for this, but again im not sure if wow will be available on these devices.
---
Yeah who cares about speed runs, the game is meant to be a social experience, if you can complete all the raids within the allotted time you've kept perfect pace. 
---
By speed running you're giving up hours and hours that could be spent with your guild and instead trading it for farming consumables by yourself.  I've done it and it fucking sucks, it goes against everything the game stands for. The guild doesn't even allow you to talk during raids unless and it's a miserable anti-social experience.
---
Remember that Ony video with 40 priests? That was a fun one
---
Then just go ask another mage?
---
&gt; Ofc, but making them worthless by default was a mistake back then and they are about to do it again.
---
Again, and cant stress this enough. They might be worthless TO YOU. Not to everyone. What the fuck happened to #nochanges.
---
I liked it a lot. Specially the first two minutes. I played a couple years but never learned the lore. I like how you tell the story behind the place and bosses.
---
yea im sorry, im sort of dumb
---
Right, I just wasn’t sure how it worked in terms of which ranks I needed to keep on my bars. It was also nice to read up on the mechanics of downranking.
---
Rank 1 - Efficient, often faster heal.
---
Max Rank - Bigger Heal, more Mana, sometimes slower cast too.
---
Like 1% of streamers make any money and a much lower percentile make a liveable income. The extreme vast majority do it as a hobby. What are you talking about?
---
I did.  Iasked a ton.  He was the only 1 to respond after like 5 minutes.
---
Maybe the other mages were tired of dealing with people who don't tip...
---
Let's be real.  That's always how it effectively worked anyway.
---
To this day I still sing the price is right theme when conjuring water.
---
Whatever, goblin lover.
---
Yeah but they have the some of the worst models
---
Holy shit dude, you have some serious problems
---
I'm almost certain the gnomeregan key did go into the keyring.
---
People keep having this argument that classic isn’t harder, but it is. The definition of hard is that it requires more effort and endurance to complete. That’s classic. I’m not saying that classic shouldn’t be harder, but think it’s stupid people keep telling people ‘it isnt harder’ when it’s literally the definition of the word.
---
You missed the joke dude.
---
No.
---
Most efficient doesn't mean dick if the healing throughput is so low it doesn't do anything.   You could probably spam an early rank 1 heal forever and not go oom.
---
mines are fucking cancer, might aswell play minesweeper

The people who think every mage is their personal slave? True.

Having played mage all of vanilla on a high(over)populated server, you get a billion whispers a day. After some time you learn to filter them out or use an addon to stop the water/food/portal begs from ever showing in your chat box.
---
Thanks for the post, was it complicated to get setup? If you dont mind explaining the steps to do so? Would be helpful to do some auction housing or simple methods of farming while not at home
---
I dunno, the guilds I was in never took them seriously, as there wasn't any raiding specs that needed it.  Priority for such a legendary was very guild dependent.
---
FFVII is still up to this day definitely having shared first place with WoW. I can't even describe how happy I was when I first time heard about FFVII remake. Great thing with that is that it's not going anywhere. Playing it couple hours every now and then should be enough. And well I don't want to rush to repeat my childhood traumas in HD.
---
That's what the patch notes so but ok.
---
Happy to hear that you're excited! Look up Madseasonshow on YouTube. 
---
Very informative 👍
---
I'm not for or against speed running. I'm just stating that this content has been out forever and will be cleared very quickly. The competitive nature of the game will drive guilds to create their own content in a way.

Well, I was bored this morning so I ended up writing it myself: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Warcraft_Classic

**World of Warcraft Classic**
---
World of Warcraft Classic is a server option for the MMORPG World of Warcraft. Running alongside the main version of the game, Classic restores the game to the state it was in before the release of the first expansion, The Burning Crusade. It was announced at BlizzCon 2017, and is set to release on August 27, 2019.
---
haha well, you left such an impression on 14 year old me that it's one of the only memories i have left of vanilla :D like i said, i dont blame any of you. 
---
it's true that after you left genjuros horde was basicly dead though :)
---
It does have counters now though.  Back then it did not.
---
Yep that was me.
---
Haha true, shouldve noticed.
---
I have similar concerns.  I decided to hit up a private server before classic launch just to see how I would do.  God the original game is good.  I’m loving it.  I would love to raid on a casual basis - say 1-2 nights a week.  Have a kid on the way.  Guess we’ll see how this goes.  I know my limits so hopefully it won’t get out of hand.
---
*moves mic closer to mouth*
---
"Sell drugs in Classic WoW"
---
That might be worthwhile at 30, but not 60.
---
I also want to know this.
---
Th article is not accurate as it does not mention cast time and instant spells as well as HOTs and Regrowth.
---
Mortal strike on the boss haha
---
Downranking only works once you have some Plus healing gear. Lets say you got some blues and greens and you have a total of +100
---
There is some math with instant, HOTS, half and half. But we will only look at full cast. If my memory serves me right 3.5 sec gets full 100 benefit. So if a talent makes it 3.0 sec you still get the full benefit. There is an additional penalty on plus healing bonus if you are using a rank of spell you obtained prior to level 20 (so leak Healing wave rank 1).
---
Now what is the benefit.... so imagine your max heals 1.7K HP and cost 620 mana, With the plus heal gear it will heal 1.8K for the same 620 .... so almost 3 to 1 ratio
---
You rank 5 only heals for 400 HP and cost 200 mana so with plus heal it will heal for 500 HP for the same 200 mana terrible right ..... 
---
Imagine you are rocking 500 plus heal so now you are healing 1.7+.5 = 2.2K fot the same 620 mana  (3.5 to 1 efficiency )
---
or 400+500 =900HP for the same 200 mana (almost 5 to 1 efficiency)
---
AV changes happened basically immediately and keep happening to this day, so yeah, there were probably AV changes in 2.3, but some of the changes OP is complaining about happened a lot earlier.
---
You can get a change if you change your own name. I got married, changed my last name. Had to provide blizzard copies of my old ID and new ID. Too bad I had already got rid of my old ID so I didn't get a name change.
---
Good one, I was at like 1.5year on /played on my shaman (vanilla, not private servers)
---
This is exactly how this game and my life works right now.....The Beta has got me sleeping the least amount of hours in my entire adult life.  I think the people at work are starting to notice.

&lt; **Booty Bay Beach Boys** \&gt; **NA-PVP, Horde**
---
**About Us:** We are a group of friends that have been playing together off and on since wrath. We have a relaxed, social atmosphere that enjoys PvP and have dived into PvE content throughout the game’s lifespan. Without any public recruitment, we have acquired 10 members that I personally know. We are all located in The U.S. ranging from Hawaii to Florida, but mainly play around the Central/Mountain time zone. Most of us are in our early to mid-20’s, but definitely welcome all ages.
---
**What are we looking for?:** We are looking for all classes that are interested in a social guild that enjoys world pvp and casual raiding.
---
**Goals:** One big goal is to have a positive social environment in the guild. We want to have a fun and enjoyable atmosphere that all members can be apart of. Another goal is to create epic world pvp! Our group has enjoy pvp throughout every xpac and expect it in classic. Last but not least, we expect to progress through all the classic raid content. We do not expect to be world first, though we do want to experience all the PvE that classic has to offer.
---
**How to apply:** Contact me on discord @Hayden#1101

https://youtu.be/pYWzd22wT1U cheers!

&gt; Ret could be considered a t1 DPS if you cut the DPS they provide from buffs from other players and add it to their own.  
---
That would only make sense if you weren't otherwise going to have those buffs.
---
Now dey give beta to da streamers?!
---
I SPIT ON DA STREAMERS
---
Berserking is indeed the best racial but you hav zero clue ehat you're talking about the tauren racial
---
The power of good gear.
---
Save some of those steamed hams for me friend!
---
pretty sure its the zone i spent the most time in outside of major cities my entire wow career.
---
Very entertaining, I was a big fan of this guy and Pat warrior pvp back in the day
---
There's a famous hunter Dysphoria who made quite a lot of use out of that ability and was able to solo dungeons using some clever pathing and hunter tricks [Dysphoria solo at 3:22](https://youtu.be/VTq7CIzGZZM)
---
Basing all your info on streams you've watched where pros and neckbeards play in full BiS?
---
Heal anyone in combat, you will get the HK.  You basically just have to be around stuff.
---
Zalgradis videos! I had completely forgotten... So much good music
---
What's wrong with him? I watched a bit of his stream the other day and he seems pretty chill.
---
But if you look at an official [labeled map](http://tinyimg.io/i/0MU9QO7.jpg), Azeroth is labeled in the bottom right.
---
I understand the sentiment but this is not a pick &amp; choose. It's 1.12 and if they start with that, someone's gonna say they want this feature from that patch and whatever else.
---
and my axe!
---
I managed to get one back with my brother's name on it. Highly unlikely but it was awesome. We have different last names too. Thank you random CS guy for bending the rules a little. (A lot of my other info matched up well.)
---
AV was changed many times. OP is talking about the rehaul that took place in vanilla. 
---
The first version of AV had a ton of quests, encouraging you to loot player's bodies and dead NPCs to build upgrades. These matches would occasionally go for 24+ hours.
---
Ok or farm sky shadow for guarante3d 20g an hour minimum, bats in WPL 30g hour. Both are vendor trash farms. So many options.
---
The database is wrong. There's a comment there from 2008 saying the quest was available at level 40.

Im 27y old, living in germany and played even back in the days and cleared till aq40.

On retail im 6x gladiator and achieved 2.7+ in any possible bracket.
---
I raided 3 months ago 8/9 in the jaina raid and was still sick of retail so i didnt do any kind of progression since than... just to tell u guys that i got PvE xp...

I wanna play Alliance cuz everyone is going to play Horde which didnt match well in my opinion cuz of the que-time...

Im going for N811 Hunt / Human Ret.

If anyone is intressted just PN / Discord: Biggelz#2405 / Bnet: MrBiggelz#21398

I got 2 vaction weeks on release so i got enough time to lvl up.
---
I got 2 maybe 3 friends with my with equal pvp xp an Priest, an Rogue and an lock whos wowhead-guidewriter if u just need a few more ppl.
---
I ( or we ) would pref an german guild but we r fine with an english one too.
---
Just /w me on any kind of platform u want to :)
---
I prefer the gold auction method, but it can be near useless to your raid progression. It's similar to DKP with bidding but you have to actually pay the amount of gold you bid and at the end of the raid the gold is split among all members so even if you dont get an item you get gold that can be used next raid. I understand the flaws of people buying gold and not being the player that would contribute the most with said item but at least people leave with something.
---
Later. BC had raids almost all raids at launch. Wotlk too.
---
I never expected free portals since it cost a reagent,.  Mages are op farmers though.
---
Thought this was a Don't Starve screenshot at first
---
Yea, which is why I don't apply it to the total DPS a ret can do. I think it would be idiocy. You can do the same when thinking about Warrior and Battle Shout, for example, and you dont apply other peoples' Battle Shout to Warrior's DPS.
---
The meta spec has always been to go down to pick up imp vw early on.
---
Looking good man. Keep it up! I'll try to get some hunters to test it out
---
What does it even mean ?
---
Kinda hard for them to sneak around on other streamers and have the surprise factor, when you got twitch chat meta gaming and warning people.
---
I love that your bags are still completely packed with potions, flasks, pvp gear, and candles. Looks like you could've ran BWL the next day, but never logged back in.
---
Well it didn't exist during vanilla so that's probably why you don't remember it. As a guy playing on private servers I can tell you classicdb.ch has been by far the most accurate database. Wowhead has never even had any vanilla data untill very recently. It has all been with the newer stats, haste etc.
---
Westfall
---
This guild looks too full.
---
The best tank on ND currently is a Tauren. The racials are overrated on Horde.
---
This used to be a jungle, then Chuck Norris came...
---
I'm assuming he was main tanking? Did he MT for your guild's progression or just the stuff on farm?
---
Do you have source on tauren hp on base stam?
---
From all I’ve looked at, classic / vanilla databases specifically says total?
---
which is exactly what shouldn't happen in vanilla. adding new content strips it from being 'vanilla' or 'classic' into something new entirely. i'm aware the games' content will cap out...eventually, but until then i'll get years of enjoyment out of it. no need for changes or player-based poll changes.
---
Yessss.  Though I have fond memories of playing AV for 5 hours logging off, going to bed, going to school, and logging back in to rejoin the same AV match where maybe it would end or not..  I know the longest I saw go on was nearly 72hours  somewhere around 66 estimated.  I played that one shortly but kept checking in with people who went back and forth... I can't even remember who won it was almost irrelevant because you had such a long experience.
---
But I don't want that again TBH and most classic players don't either.  It's why they changed it WITHIN vanilla.  People begged for a reprieve from such a massive shitshow.
---
There were amazing parts and maybe there's a way to meet in the middle but the 24hour+ AVs don't have a place in gaming classic or not.
---
Think guilds will kill 4HM without any warrior T3? I'd be surprised if KT didn't take a couple weeks.
---
This is the right answer imho
---
awesome!
---
Also many are at this point used to theorycraft the fun out of everything. Just look at all those guides, where you could come to the conlusion that for every class or spec there is exactly one race that is viable and of course, for raiding you need engineering on every single player, nothing else is acceptable.
---
Sure, if you want to go for server firsts, this will help. If you want to compete worldwide, it may be required.
---
For the "normal" player, you just have to find a guild with likeminded people that fall on the same spot on the spectrum between extremely casual and absolute hardcore.
---
whats shown above enemy head is related to combat log so that part is a bit redundant but aside from that. And spell pen is a literal stat on gear &amp; talents so the term should exist.
---
what would be ur hit cap for a lvl 60 vs lvl 60 where the enemy has 50 resistance
---
and what would be the cap for 60 vs 63 if the enemy also has 50 resistance ?
---
and what if the enemy has 0 resistance ?
---
If you stick your thumb up your ass far enough, it becomes a ret paladin?
---
Wtf? As a mage you can just tag everything instantly with fire blast, how are you “struggling to tag mobs”?
---
Nope.  
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Alterac_Valley  
---
The other sections of AV were shut off in 1.8.
---
Benediction ❤️❤️👌🏻
---
Fuck if you ain't right. We could barely manage 25 man drama, and I regrettably contributed to it :/

Battleground: as long as you are near you get HK
---
World: as long as you are near and within grp of those who kill or harmed the target u get HK
---
It's insane that you can clear ST with level 40s. Iirc that's a +50 level dungeon.
---
Pretty chill and genuinely awful at the game. Like unimaginable levels of awfulness.
---
Actually if you treated the original AV as a raid and queued up nearly 40 players on comms it was the best honor.
---
Had a couple (future) High Warlords organize these smash victory AVs on off days.  Was a nice break from the WSG grind.
---
But yeah PUG vs PUG AV was a pretty inefficient honor vs time commitment.
---
You want them to change their stance on what game data they have copies of? I don't think it works like that.
---
Right? Guy clearly isnt paying attention to those streams. Those guys have streamer privilege for one, so their disciples are giving them all the best drops. And second, when you've been playing all day every day and have been level 40 for several days, you're absolutely going to have BiS gear and so will everyone else.
---
OP needs to understand that everyone streaming the beta is no-lifing the game with streamer privilege. No casual player will have that.
---
I remember that happening in late BC
---
I've been talking with Bean on his stream and it all works fairly well. There is some weird issue with the car bar merging into the shot bar on occasion and I'm still tracking that one down.
---
Demo is the best for survivability, specially on pvp realms
---
farmed there in vanilla.  didn't get 1000g
---
They spared my lv 32 warlock in STV. I saw three troll rogues on mount coming towards me and thought "Oh fuck" but then they started dancing with me. Bless you Ooga brothers.
---
I mean, the Steamwheedle Cartel provided troops for the Horde during Warcraft II and Gazlowe has been heavily aligned with the Horde ever since Warcraft III, so it's not like goblins are entirely neutral.
---
&gt;Not sure if you are trying to say that the other person is committing that fallacy or that they should listen to consensus.
---
The former.
---
You have to run back from the GY to the instance, not sure it's faster.
---
So is Asmongold but he's the opposite personality. A lot of people are trash at this game because they don't actually remember how everything worked lol
---
you can say asshole on the internet
---
More Fear Wards for your melee means more DPS.
---
*logs into retail wow*
---
Look how they massacred my boy
---
I think it's hard to have black and white or casual vs hardcore.
---
There's quite a huge middleground.  Are you casual about the game in general?  Are you a casual raider?
---
So you're a casual raider which to some will not be casual because they think raiding in most flavors is more hardcore than what a casual experience entails.
---
Anyways I think there's a lot of grey and we shouldn't just define casual and not casual.  We should just describe what we do, which you have and now people can see if they want to be like you or do more or do less.
---
The way you think, you limit the DPS hell a lot. IF you DON'T Spam Sunder, you'll be at 100 rage almost all the time even with heroic strike being used.
---
Sunder is also the best threat generator you can spam (without CD).
---
Why the f would you not use sunder and use expose armor instead? That's the dumbest thing I've heard.
---
Yeah, I ended up blocking that guy. He must surely be trolling at this point.
---
I tried this but found i could only manage the mobs from 26 with cone of cold. Whats the strategy not using it? Or with only 2pts blizzard?
---
Did that stack with might back then?  I might count battle shout if it didn't, because you'd often not have the shout if the warrior wasn't there (it was a group buff and if you had one less warrior, you might not have it in your group).  By contrast, pretty much every pally blessing is going to be on you in a raid.  
---
Maybe I'm forgetting something.
---
i would dislike for low effort, but you actually matched them pretty good, especially the undead.
---
No one remembered how it is to do dungeons in level 30 bis gear. No one ever had level 30 bis gear.
---
Gear. Matters.
---
I plan on leveling Demo.
---
But you can’t actually play this character in “vanilla” right ?
---
You never got into wow, but you here advertising for your friend? Hmmmm
---
This is a troll post.
---
I mean... A paladin won't have competition with a shaman for loot. They'll never be in the same raid.
---
As for the loot, tier 2 is more or less useless for healing, so it should be fairly straightforward to get. As for weapons, stuff like Herald of Woe or Draconic Maul are both in non-existent demand and fairly plentiful. It should be fairly easy to get one, if your guild makes it into BWL.

\*\*Epoch of Thought \\\[H\\\]\*\* | NA-PvP | Wed, Thur, Sun 1800—2200 PST | Hardcore
---
\*\*TL;DR\*\*:  Hardcore experienced, established guild seeks non-toxic, dedicated, competent raiders for Classic dominance starting with test realm preparation now. 
---
\*\*About\*\*: EoT started on Bloodscalp shortly after vanilla wow’s release &amp; became a top guild on the server. We’ve persisted as a gaming family ever since. Our goal has always been to clear content as a team while providing a second family for our members.  
---
Our leadership is experienced, skilled, and caring.  We've been around since the beginning and we're not quitting until we've farmed Naxx enough to gear everyone :).  We look forward to developing a winning team of people you'd not only want to raid with, but would also like to meet in real life if the chance arose.
---
\*\*Raiding plans\*\*: For classic we will be a top guild &amp; clear Naxxramas. We have a solid core experienced through Naxx. Most of us have raided for years &amp; are ready to devour classic content. We are running two competitive raid teams both lead by experienced leadership and tanked by experienced main tanks.  
---
\*\*Loot System\*\*:  We run a unique/proprietary point-guided loot council (attendance and contributions are measured and accounted for but there is no bidding and the system is designed to be transparent and efficient).  The loot council is focused on awarding gear where it best serves raid progression &amp; best recognizes attendance, &amp; contribution to raid performance.
---
\*\*What we expect\*\*: We expect dedicated, skilled raiders who show up with consumes, proper gear, &amp; knowledge. We expect competence and literacy with computers, google spread sheets, balancing individual schedules, and team communication.  We expect effort during, before, and after raids.  We expect serious practice on a guild hosted test server.  
---
We are team-focused so great performers are appreciated &amp; recognized, but divas who are unconcerned with the health of the entire raid team or overly self-interested are not tolerated. We are a diverse group of raiders worthy of individual respect &amp; the respect of everyone’s time.  Toxicity and drama stirring have no place in our guild.
---
\*\*In short, be prepared, be knowledgeable, be on time, &amp; don’t be an A-hole.\*\*
---
\*\*Why We Will Survive and Thrive\*\*:  We are experienced, dedicated, and prepared.  Our leadership team consists of mature, experienced, and professional leaders.  Our raid core consists of experienced, skilled, and most importantly, dedicated raiders.  
---
We are busy doing all the prep work we need to run a highly organized, reasonably competitive guild.  We are inclusive, non-toxic, and value team building and a rewarding social environment over pyrrhic victories.  We were successful in actual vanilla and have only gotten smarter, wiser, and more organized with age.
---
Most importantly we desire complete decimation of classic content and will not stop until we get there.
---
\*\*Raid Schedule\*\*: Wed, Thur, Sun, 6 PM to 10 PM PST (GMT-8) (9pm – 1 AM EST) hard stops and early nights where possible. Our guild has always been extremely active &amp; 20-mans, Onyxia, etc. will continue to be ran on non-core days. On most days, if you log in, you will find a good group of people to smash content with.
---
\*\*Looking for\*\*: Great people of all classes are strongly encouraged to apply.  Core raid spots are earned through demonstrated competence &amp; dedication. This means that no core spots will be predetermined and certainly not before anyone's hit 60.
---
If you are interested in leadership roles within the guild please send me a whisper &amp; let’s chat.
---
\*\*Current Activity\*\*:  The guild is practicing on our own test server to get the group reoriented to the old content and shaking the rust off.  We use the test raids for providing feedback, polishing raid skills, and determining and bolstering roster weakness.  
---
Currently, a sizeable portion of the guild is practicing leveling runs on pservers while a few are raiding hardcore.  We also have guild jackbox party nights for fun while we wait for classic.
---
\*\*Apply\*\*: The best way to join is to shoot me a private discord message \*\*(Discord: Lne#2710 | Battlenet: Lne#1326)\*\*.  You can also hit up my assistant GM on \*\*discord:  XvK#7740\*\*

Good god, we're fucking up the future generations.

I think I did the troll the best, and the Tauren just makes me laugh every time I look at it xD
---
My fondest memories come as a Pally healer in TBC. I used 2 ranks of Flash of Light, one lower for constant spamming and one larger once in a while when a big heal was needed. All of the Pally healers would also spam damage abilities in a contest to see who could go OOM first. Generally none of us could drain all of our mana in a fight because of the lower rank Flash of Light and how mana re-gened when it would crit. I miss those days.

I woulf agree if it took you 10mins to do thst like the aquatic form
---
Did you progress bwl and aq40 in cata?
---
90% sure BS and BoM stack. I'm fairly sure its just consumables that don't overlap on effects.
---
Mage's biggest weakness is other players. Our fastest way of leveling is AoE farming and only possible when solo and no competition.
---
Honestly don’t worry about it. I can’t remember the FPS but it was stable at full settings for the most part even with a million people flooding the starting zones.
---
That’s more playtime than I have total account wide and I’ve been playing since 2006 off and on. Filthy casual I guess
---
2004? I was listening to Bleeding Through, The Acacia Strain, As I Lay Dying, Unearth, Sinai Beach, Atreyu, AFI, Nine Inch Nails, and definitely some old school Green Day still. 
---
Also, Paralyzer was by Finger Eleven :)
---
K a n g Z
---
As someone who spends more time around the future generations than I can sometimes stomach, trust when I say playing WoW Classic and being hands off can only improve things.
---
That's sad. I had a 62 Rogue which was deleted around TBC-WOTLK era restored.
---
Watch the login queue and the servers going down constantly probably.
---
The Ooga brothers are true heros! I hope they're making a montage of sorts..
---
We get a lot of folks who join our Discord but never say anything if that's what your going off. In addition we have some friends, family, and social members in our Discord that are playing other games/etc with us while we wait for launch. If there's someone who's serious interested in us, and plans to commit to Classic, we'd be able to make things work.
---
At the moment we do have roughly 40 for our roster, but are looking to have a 50 man roster as we expect natural player dropoff come launch.
---
Feel free to let me know if you have any questions.

It might require a lot of effort to do things in an MMORPG for you, but don't assume the same for other people. Again, sorry my friend, but classic wasn't hard to me. Yes, the definition of "hard" that you used probably applies to how the game was to you, and that is completely fine.
---
Oh god you're fuuuuckt...
---
Atleast i'm aiming to finish my masters before august.
---
If i'm unable... well shit.
---
From my experience druids are simply the best at stealing spawns. I stole so many from geoups of 5 of private servers. Moonfire ftw. Its instant, long range  and has no travel time. I guess others have tools like this too but cant remember anyone who has it as soon as druids, and even if they get something like that, they will never be better than druids, just as good at best.

My guild had 4H on farm in Vanilla.
---
Nightwish has me covered for the original feel of battleground sound scores.
---
Thanks, I hate it
---
mushrooms and herbs ;)
---
Threat is a thing, though.
---
And you'll do none of it.
---
Any recommendation for G402 over G403?
---
I'd prefer a 1.12 av. So I am down voting you.
---
Ah damnit. I knew that one would get me in trouble
---
I'd rather have a 2 hour fun raid through MC than rushing through in an hour while at the same time kicking friends out. If clearing MC every turns into a chore that I'd rather avoid, I can just stop doing that.
---
I just hope, there still is a place for both playstyles these days.
---
Which is basically what TBC was lol.  Top DPS and full threat wipe = coasting to #1 on dmg meters.
---
You misspelled cry.
---
Thanks for the very good answer
---
Can you upload to imgur instead? That site is blocked for med due to risk of malware. Azeroth is the planet/world on which Kalimdor and Eastern Kingdom are placed.
---
I'm still gonna miss them in the horde. Although i gotta say i was never a fan of their cataclysm redesign, they all turned into grumpy geezers. Their portrayal in vanilla was much more loyal to what was established in WC 2 and 3.
---
I want ice cream
---
no korrak :/
---
Bears straight up suck at mitigation *in comparison* to Warriors. But most of the time healers are able to deal with the extra incoming damage. You just can't use them to reliably tank the most hard hitting stuff.
---
They have this weird niche that they exist in where they have an upper limit to what they can safely tank without dying, but also have way higher threat generation.
---
They *can* MT many fights, aside from the issue of taking more damage they're perfectly capable... but yeah, the class has some built in flaws that the game devs basically wanted you to not be able to overcome.
---
you sought the guy out at the bottom of the thread to jump in and drop your virtue signalling garbage, he's right that you come across as emotional
---
For this subreddit it’s literally ancient history. I must have refreshed 1000 times since then
---
I have been looking for a proper version of this for AGES. Thank you so much.
---
Small problem though, I install the addon correctly, the game recognizes it, but ingame nothing happens when I put in a /wst and no bars show up. I'm running some other stuff, but I have disabled and uninstalled my previous attack bar addons (Samuel's mod, if it helps).   
---
I also tried disabled everything, and it gave me this error.
---
How do I make this wonderful tool work?
---
I quit retail about 6 months ago because there was literally nothing to do outside of raiding.  I hate the 'go-go-go' mentality of mythic+.  When I found myself farming raids from previous expansions for transmog I realised it was time to quit.
---
I have been playing on a vanilla private server a bit in the meantime.
---
Anyway, I was watching a youtube video someone posted about patch 8.2 and my first thought was it looks like Diablo with numbers all over the screen and the very fast pace.  I know some people like that but the contrast with vanilla/classic combat is striking.
---
But wouldn't it be better even for a premade grp to be on the server where all the good pvpers are to have good pvpers in the grp?
---
The trees dont fit at all.
---
Yeah, as expected really low-pop, all the streamers have been saying it. They want more people joining because the server feels empty.
---
I remember that game. That was a good game. Whatever happened to it?
---
I was hoping to pay off my $300k mortgage before launch so I can focus on the game. Having goals never hurts
---
There were no faction specific AH besides OG/IF. They added those in later patches.
---
I wouldn't worry too much. And for the record I do think that fun should come before efficiency, I just wanted to present the other side's POV because I've played in guilds like that and I understand where they're coming from.
---
I was server one for about 10 weeks as an undead warrior when Andorhal was first released. Are orc racials better? Yeah, but I didn’t regret it and you as a player make the far larger impact. Play what you want to play.
---
You mean you?
---
You can’t honestly sit here and say doing the same thing in classic that you do today didn’t require more effort. That it didn’t require more endurance, more time. It’s a simple fact that leveling, acquiring gold, gear etc is not the welfare system that exists today. It’s not that I’m saying I don’t prefer classic, I miss it greatly, it’s just this ‘it’s not harder’ thing like someone hurt your pride.
---
I’ll play classic, there’s a lot to like that isn’t just nostalgia and rose tint, but I will be the first to admit it’s a lot harder to get to the top than it is today, and I’m looking forward to that.
---
Yeah it's depressing to walk in to the Stormwind AH and just see lots of 'xXPussySlayerXx-RandomServer' names there.  I don't recognise any guild names.  Being a member of the best PVE or PVP guild on the server no longer holds any prestige.  Nobody gives a shit because nobody ever sees anyone from their server.
---
It's hard to say what you're doing wrong without watching you, but it's entirely possible to do at 22 and even earlier - provided you pick the right spots to grind, pull the correct amount of mobs and generally have an idea of what you're doing.
---
Respectfully, you’ve got two absolutely massive confounds if your hypothesis is that AV’s popularity increased due to the balance changes. Specifically, battlemasters (patch 1.6) and cross realm BGs (patch 1.11 I think? Somewhere around there). Those things changed stuff a lot.
---
I know what a pog is, just can’t believe all these kids are using them as a word for “cool” when 99% of them don’t even know what they are. 
---
Just goes to show how many sheep there are out there.
---
I like the way you think! And my first level cap character will like it even more.
---
What does that even mean?
---
SMOrc
---
No kids or wife to worry about, just a mutual good time gal that I see.
---
Heal everyone, maybe toss a hit or dot in for good measure. Travel with a small group, this will vary by pvp content. You’ll want allies as healers are usually focused down.
---
I can’t do it. I played one season of PoE, got to max level and did every content (Uber elder and such) and I just don’t have the desire to start another season all over or even continue playing in standard. Maybe when patch 4.0 comes out...
---
I does this with Questie. Just /questie and turn off objectives, minimap, arrow, tooltips etc
---
On top of Beserking, which other people mentioned, it appears like in Classic Trolls passive health regen is really useful for AoE aggro and it is even putting out more threat than a Renew/Rejuv.
---
Why would you ever want to do this?
---
You don't keep certain ranks.  You calculate the heal to mana ratio, and determine which ranks work best at that time.  You change over time as you get more gear.
---
his videos are great.
---
If people get over the initial shock of how hard the game is (i.e. you start off as extremely puny and weak and it takes a loooooong time before you get any half-decent gear) and realise that you really do need to group up to make progress then I think people will realise what a gem classic is.
---
Indeed. You think a warrior or rogue wants to throw a knife instead of charging/stealthing and opening move? How many classes had it better than mages in this measure in vanilla?
---
There are few pieces that require you do be gnomisch to use. Most are engenering to use but gnomisch to make.
---
Meaning if you start with gnomish and craft all weird stuff that is bind on pickup. You can de-learn engenering and learn it again. Ending up with goblin the second time for dubble the goodies to use.
---
Most top pvpers will level engenering twice.
---
for 10$ you can change your char nickname for example
---
Good at least someones thinking the same way, im like you made 700$? Yea you sold it your a scumabg and stealing if you try to recover it now.
---
You still have a lot of free time in college tho. If all you do is school work and WoW (so no social life basically) you can still spend at least 5 hours a day minimum gaming, even more if you’re efficient in doing your homework.
---
Stop right there, you are giving me nightmare oof
---
F
---
As long as any of the quest in the quest line before it says 40, it should be possible
---
That is terrible idea
---
Tell me I’m a good boy!

COMMANDOH!!!
---
Play what you want to play and you feel happiest sitting down and dedicating days of your life to. It's your character, make them how you wish.
---
Yes each race has racials which are better for certain specs. It's not game changing though. 
---
For further argument watch the world first KT run and you'll notice there's a tank of every race.
---
I love this string of comments, I hope you boys forge an everlasting friendship.
---
Kinda over simplifying a more complex question. Between two really good players you've got pretty much equal ground regardless of class. The next thing that comes into play is individual ability. You may end up doing really poorly with a class someone tells you is easy for a newbie or really well with one not recommended. I really suggest playing around with everything until you find something that's the most fun for you. If you play the game long enough you'll end up not being bad with any class.
---
I vote no because what I liked in classic is you had to commit to your character or start over.
---
It made my character feel more personal and real to me and brought a greater immersion to the game for me. I don’t go on RP serves. But I do always give my character a backstory, motive, etc. 
---
I just liked having my character knowing he can only be like that.
---
Chuck Norris once took a piss, the resulting aftermath can be seen today what is call the Grand Canyon.

Ninja loot, change name/server

Those services weren't around in Vanilla?!

what? did u even read what i wrote man?

I know right? imagine ninja looters changing names there is so many "exploits"

Prior to the rework of the warrior class shield slam was pretty much useless so it was very common to see tanks only spending a few points in the protection tree.

I was never talking about random bg’s in the first place, but about premades. Druids aren’t likely to get invited.

Only if there is also no afk report like back in the day so you insufferable whiners get to experience what it's like to have 40 people in the raid but only 15 are fighting because 20 are shamelesly AFKing right at the start and the other 5 are fishing.
---
Yes . Daily and later world quests. At first it was cool but really i learned to hate it.  Well more. It was ruining the experience. Wq felt like farmville type of play
---
What are you in real life?
---
**OKAY PLAY ANYTHING BUT THAT**
---
1.12 was cross realm bg’s battle masters I think you’re right on.
---
I would expect there would be realm transfers. Definitely not name, race, or faction changes. 
---
Faction changes wouldn't even work because of the Alliance not having Shamans and the Horde not having Paladins.
---
No one has said you're wrong, are you paranoid or something?
---
3am the 27th?
---
You can start in whatever zone you want for beginning quests
---
Lol people are already doing that so...
---
This isn't a question of data retard. The Data problem was for getting proper values for objects not weather or not they should be in the game in the first place.

Don't talk about programming if you don't even understand the concepts were talking about.
---
i just want to take the time to politely say fuck trump. he would probably play a rogue
---
Oh no most things did require more time, but to me that's not harder that just requires more time, walking to an instance vs being teleported? Walking takes longer but it's not harder. Hitting a node 3 times to get ore and possibly missing? Not hard, but a little rng added, a couple of extra mouse clicks.
---
Hard, not what I'd use to sum up classic, but then again classic is different to different people, it's simply a slower paced game to me. I will say it's going to be harder now because my attention span for some games are a lot lower, so it will take more "effort and endurance" to stay focused.
---
Back in vanilla you couldnt queue more than 5 people at a time. You needed an addon to have everone queue at the same time.
---
That game is good.
---
Is there a version for the Vanilla 1.12 client?
---
Tbc dailies started later in expansion. They were not a must but they started a trend with reputation farm.
---
Heresy
---
OOM = Out Of Mana.. Get prepared to hear it a lot in classic. Mana management is huge part of the game for casters.
---
Needs more crumbs and empty bottles
---
Well buying an account is also scummy and against TOS, basically amounts to cheating.
---
really, whatever zone you're willing to run to
---
ClassicDB is a PS database. If you want the most accurate information, CDB is probably not the site that one ought to rely on too heavily.
---
But I’m a ginger dwarf with a red beard
---
ClassicDB is a private server database. Let's just say it was formerly known as a certain flavor of icecream and the word "gaming".
---
Good point! I didn’t know this
---
Bald &amp; Black Human it is!

All you need is Disturbed and Linkin Park

---
Considering the amount of posts on the forums I have been actively talking in about the ease of 1.12 content. I’m going to call BS. Just a giant load of BS. Trying to rally some pitchforks and get people to hate on blizzard.
---
1. they already stated classic is based upon 1.12.1 and u won't see armorless mounts either.
---
2. 1.0 AV was rebalanced since it was a real mess if you judge it faction vs faction, yes its still not completely fair design but it is a lot better than it was.
---
3. You never played the original, and if you where given it you would cry as well and that is rather common when it comes to web-needs, you will want what you cannot but you will not really want it if you recieve it either.
---
4. You can still summon the npc's and as seen on pservs 1.12.1 AV map still lasts for 3-9 hours at times...

 World of Warcraft Classic arrives on the 26th of August this year, with servers opening up to fans at 3PM PT, or 11PM BST for those of us
---
the realm transfers had limitations too iirc - you couldn't go from pve servers to pvp but could go the opposite way (so you couldn't level to 60 in peace then transfer to start ganking) and also limited the amount of gold you could bring with you
---
Hahahaha okay thank you for the tip

Take note there are not hunter trainers in the human zones, incase you want to be a dwarf hunter going human.
---
&gt; It's pople like you that make legimate criticism of World of Warcraft so hard.
---
I suggest purchasing some non-bunching panties.
---
&gt; Your post shows that you just hate every new addition and change that came to the game, even when it didn't affect it negatively.
---
So a list of seven shitty things about TBC means I hated every change ever made to WoW ever.  Right.
---
&gt; By the way, Molten Core was the first raid that didn't need an attunement
---
[Attunement to the Core.](https://www.wowhead.com/quest=7848/attunement-to-the-core)  No, this was not optional.  No guild is going to tolerate you not having your MC attunement.
---
Meanwhile, Sunwell didn't have anything at all.
---
&gt; Would love to hear which dramatic negative impact it had to give both factions access to Paladins and Shamans.
---
I mean, if you don't care about factional identity, I guess it's no big.
---
&gt; If you really think that the BC changes were a major contributor to things like Sharding, Titanforging, the LFR system, watered down leveling etc. you are just wrong.
---
Uh?  I think they were a major contributer to thing things that I mentioned that are still in the game to this day.  Don't try to straw man me, you little goof.
---
Find the drakedog Playlist
---
Issue is fire immune bosses would be a no-go since you can searing pain for threat, but after that I think its doable for at least some bosses.  
---
Have to go alliance for kings, devo, and conc aura for pushback resist.  Stack armor rings, trinkets, and weapon.  Would probably get you to pre-SL 25% redux or more.  If we could HPS enough to keep you and the pet alive it would be like a warrior tanking without his shield which is totally doable if you outgear most bosses.
---
You can but you'll need to go back to your own faction's area for class quests (10, 20, 40 etc)
---
Pretty sure it was mentioned in tipsout interview with blizzard, when they invited "influencers" to blizzard hq before the beta launch.
---
Best pack your walking boots, you won't get a mount for a long time!
---
&gt; They (server engineers)   know the limits of the servers 
---
Blizzard programmers average like $60k a year when the average for software engineers is $120k. Market value dictates worth and blizzard has the  absolute worst programmers in the country. The average CS student makes more on his first job than the average seasoned blizzzard engineer
---
So no I have absolutely no faith in anything a blizzard engineer does, I place more trust in a first year CS student and I absolutely hate the college system
---
*Time is money, friend.*
---
They will merge two wow accounts(subs) under a single battle net but they don’t merge two (subs) down to one.
---
Bro that’s deep.
---
You are missing the point. Modern wow forces you to do your daily routine every day/week or you miss out on stuff. Old school wow is grindy as fuck, yes but player chooses when to grind for as long as he wants . This way it doesnt feel like forced job but a choice
---
Can't wait to see a vid of you on patchwerk
---
Go Druid, you’ll be one in a million and all the loot will be yours. Everyone wants mark of the wild. You’ll have like 3 sets of gear in your bag tho.

They were bad when they were released.

Aha, thanks!  :)
---
&gt;This sub does seem to have a weird duality
---
No this sub has two groups of people screaming at each other and neither one listening.
---
*MOST* people in both groups are right, if they would shut up for a third of a second to notice. 
---
You can, and SHOULD play whatever spec you like, it's a lot of fun to try off the wall things that may be very niche.
---
At the same time you should not show up to raids and lie about your spec, and expect everyone else to carry you.   Have an alt, respec, pull your weight in your roll regardless, it doesn't matter how you do it, just don't disrespect 39 other people.
---
Life is simple when you don't try to oversimplify everything in to catchphrases.
---
Two wrongs don't make a right. Also, stealing $700 feels worse ethically than buying an account against TOS.

Disturbed linkin park rise against evanescence bullet for my valentine and system of a down. Your set
---
I was a Blizzard fan since the original Warcraft, although I had played some earlier Blizzard games. I also was an MMO fan in general when WoW was released. I was not in the beta, but I kept up with the website prior to the game's launch.
---
you are right
---
oh cool, let me try!
---
No offense, but go back to r/politics with that trash. 
---
how did I do?
---
So you play a mage or a hunter. Maybe a warlock. Because everyone else is bored out of their mind in that "epic battle". You send your pet our or AOE the ground for 6 hours, when others occasionally kill a incoming pet. You can gain ground if the other side doesnt have as many mages as you do. Or they get bored and you have a slight numbers advantage.
---
It might have "felt epic", but jeesus fucking christ it was booring as hell fast. The result will be that people wont que for AV, becaus getting the reputation is impossible, its not worth it in regarding honor. 1.12 experience is also vanilla experience.
---
And you can EASILY turtle the AV if you want to. The choke points are so easy to defend with VERY little number of ppl. So if you want that, PLAY like that.
---
google 'spell coefficient' you can find the answer to all of these questions
---
Seems more useful for farming at work
---
My man, please keep this up. It's pretty entertaining to read on break times or the toilet.
---
&gt; Anyways, between druid and paladin healer, which do you all think will have a harder time getting into raids?
---
As others have said, it'll be easier to get into a raid as a paladin.  Also, it's easier to run dungeons as a pally because druids don't have unlimited out-of-combat rez.  But you really gotta play whatever is going to make you most happy.  As long as you aren't planning to be a hardcore raider, anything will work.
---
Fury is there. Arms is strictly PvP.
---
High tier raid set and the nice stuff I forgot the name off but also 34G. Good old times
---
Isn't the reason why trolls are best tanks on horde mostly because of their combat HP regen racial? Free AoE healing threat.
---
I listened to this list through most of 2005, I've compiled it in Spotify, a few of them are newer as I kept adding to the list, I made the list from my old winamp playlist, last edited 2007, then again, the nostalgia hit and I added a few more songs newer than 2007, but around 700 of them are from 2005.

---
So now people can go I to roleplay servers specifically to harass role players? Like an Orc can follow your undead around calling you "rp faggot cuckboy nigger-dick" over and over? Or was that always allowed or against the rules even on normal servers?
---
I remember that episode. I also remember when they talked about how to get the chicken pet from Westfall. I miss those days of G4 sometimes.
---
What does them being good farmers have anything to do with you expecting them to give you basicly free money? You sound exactly the type of free loader that was on my ignore list in vanilla.
---
He's not trying to be good at the game anymore, he just wants to have fun and entertain his viewers. I could be wrong but I do not believe I have heard anything bad about swifty or his community.
---
Funny, because everything below the hardcore "x first" pushing guilds were just happy to fill the slots. People really underestimate how hard it is to actually get 40 people to show up on time consistently.     
---
     
---
Most of the guilds I've been a part of had a "core" group of around 15 people filling the important slots (tanks &amp; healers, few dps) and the rest came from whoever was available. If that ment taking ret pallies and balance druids, so be it.
---
Some of you are alright, dont turn up to the crossroads tomorrow..
---
Help me understand. 
---
So when vanilla comes out in few months. Do we get our old wow characters? Or is it a clean start for everyone?
---
Nothing wrong with SWTOR, the companions have actually made it a great game to learn how to dps without much stress.
---
My recommendation to reduce your clicking is practice using your mouse to control the camera pretty much all the time. You walk forward faster than you walk backwards- so walking after flipping your camera 180 degrees is faster than walking backwards. Using the right click camera also allows you to pay better attention to your surroundings, helping to mitigate extra mob pulls- a frequently lethal accident in classic.
---
Meanwhile, leave your other hand on the keyboard. I tend to position my default finger positions at wasf and space- I’ve heard of using esdf, all sorts of stuff. Then just put the abilities that you use on various buttons bound to the keys your hand can reach; I use 1-8, shift 1-6, f1-f5, shift f1-shift f5... there’s all sorts of options.
---
A great way to improve is by just hitting practice dummies for a long while- SWTOR has them in various places I believe. Start in small amounts at first, until you get bored; but try to practice a bit every time you hop on. Just start attacking, and practice using your abilities in ways that they combo off each other. Don’t worry about doing it quickly at first- just get used to training your mind / hand to associate the finger press with the ability trigger. Once you’re used to that, start adding movement- just take a couple steps side to side between spells. Then worry about speeding it up playing ‘optimally’.
---
It’s a long process, but getting used to keybinds vastly improves the play experience and opens up more opportunities for you to do crazy stuff.
---
99% sure this happened. Clip is in southern barrens
---
They're saying your a dweeb if you play WoW. I agree. Role-playing and normal playing are both focusing on fake shit to escape the real shit. If one is lame they're both lame.
---
nah you're thinking of an elitist rogue who thinks thunderfury is for him
---
He doesnt mean normal mobs. Its some rare elite or elite questmob that have those looong spawn timers.
---
You sound like that dbag mage I out assholed.
---
pretty bad... pretty bad.
---
And then.... What are you? :o
---
Trolls and Tauren are better, there is no real reason other than RP and preference to play an Undead Warrior. People in PVP and PVE will make fun of you behind your back.
---
Troll is the best race for tanking Naxxramas.
---
ill bet beta includes L60 stuff too. They just keep increasing the level cap every 3 weeks or so.
---
I dislike the whole Twitch spam kekebur monkas whatever they say culture since it's just so sad. But people like you are actually worse.
---
You don't make anything better by being even more childish than those you dislike.
---
Barrens chat was the most idiotic part of WoW.  I was in high school, at my peak point of immaturity and even barrens was too much for me.
---
is this one side or both sides? how is the data gathered? /who only shows a max of 50 players so just curious how it's totaled
---
I don't really know how to answer this poll.
---
I don't know if I'll get to raid at all, and generally real life commitments have priority, so I'm not really a raider.
---
Still deciding if I want a PvP server or not. But I only really care about world PvP. My concern is it will be dead because of battlegrounds.
---
I could be quite happy running dungeons, getting a few characters to 60, leveling profs, playing the AH, etc...
---
Well, you have very low number of players, so dont know how that affects the spawns. Been very low on time, only hit L18 on my shammy. I literally almost play solo in barrens. Maybe see 1-2 guys running around there.
---
Warlock.
---
You can only fight 4 mobs at once.
---
 you will have to fear the fifth costing extra mana. 
---
Lifes though man.
---
He does not.
---
Sorry honest question: I only played Vanilla on private servers where pve was not really a thing, then switched to retail late TBC and fell in love with raiding.
---
A LOT of Classic players seem to think 2 hours raids per lockout as a good thing, but the whole "then you are free to do whatever you want" doesn't really work for me. I understand Vanilla is more about player interaction and adventure, and I'm really looking forward to it... while leveling. Is the endgame really that non-existent? I know is more a post-tbc kind of mentality, but I'm really worried about running out of stuff to do later on.
---
Plus, I can't really see AQ40 or Naxx being cleared that fast, those places are massive, so at least there is that.
---
Most guides suggest ret until 31 and protection from there. In BC I ran Ret from 1-67 and then finished with holy as i was running more dungeons than anything
---
Khara was vanilla.  
---
Naxx was wotlk.
---
my bad bro i forgot they were deliberately removing items from the blacksmithing menu then putting them back on in phase 3
---
they're in the game..
---
even if you can't make them they exist
---
I doubt you ever even played Vanilla.
---
I played in a Content Clearing guild. We had 76 active Members in total (not counting socials).
---
Getting a full raid of 40man together, evening after evening, wasn't happening. Most guilds, mine included, are not hardcore. And statistically, most players ("most" == 99%+) are not hardcore either.
---
What's more, just because you played a "real spec" didn't mean you were good either. We had people who had to stand outside the raid at Geddon, because Grasping the concept of _"You burn. Run away!"_, was too much for them.
---
I rather take a good player with a "meme specc", than a moron who plays what the internet tells him to.
---
TLDR; There are ample slots for "meme speccs", and people will have a blast playing them, while people who are deluded enough to force others minmax in a 14 year old game, will soon be gone like the asocial trash they are.
---
*Notices mage is missing*
---
*Nods head*
---
"Names that consist of multiple words"   
---
Like Blackhand, Bronzebeard, Starseeker, Blightcaller or Bloodhoof?   
---
And yeah, looking at the examples I am aware what they mean with that rule. Just seems like rather inaccurate wording.
---
just a comment to remind me when im home
---
And Godsmack. I stand alone was my pvp shit.
---
I sought him out? 
---
I just scrolled through the comments and responded just as you did. 
---
And what virtue was I signaling? What the fuck are people like you even talking about?
---
I like my gf and my job but I was given the chance to go back in time with memories intact and price was her and everybody in my job not existing permanently in my new life, I would do it. I would do it and never start wow to be honest. I would start heroin so I could have a chance in life.
---
will pm tomorrow. planning on 16-20 hr days for releaSe. UD priest.
---
Diffrence is small. In 5 mans any healer would do and in raids aswell. You will raids have more paladins shamans and priests but some druids aswell for the combat res.
---
Divorce is an option, kids are not mandatory and I hope you are living in a wellfare country. Good luck.
---
I like how that doesn't make any sense that they want to increase the average play time yet they add lfr and dungeon finder so that people can easily find a group without wasting time. 
---
The only reason they do what they do is to please everyone at once which is obviously very hard.
---
Yeah as in, local and general chat will be **twitch** chat when the streamers are live.
---
When those streamers go offline, server basically dies.
---
Can you give me some examples of your improvements? I really need some extra willpower.
---
Starting zones take like a couple hours to completely finish, but if it’s vital to play together for those couple hours you can just run to their zone
---
Wow, thats quite late isnt it?
---
What server is this? EU?
---
Few druids are going to be VERY good raid healers, their biggest "problem" is that you dont want to have much more than 2 of them in raid. THAT means those druids that ARE raiding are going to be very good geared, due low competition on tier 1-2 parts. In 5-mans you have your main problem, not having a res. Some people discard you because of that, but then again you can just TANK the instances yourself, if needed.
---
Lolnerd
---
French people sound like they are trying to talk with a mouth full of food after having a stroke. Mumfulmble tu forumpful mon trombone!
---
So I've always thought Vanilla -&gt; anything before LFG was the most casual friendly, because of the epic 5-person dungeons. 
---
Are you a slow leveller? Do you just get the occasional evening to play? No way you can stick to a raid schedule then. But you can find four other people and go have an absolutely epic experience in Blackrock Depths (for example), on the odd occasion you do have time.
---
I felt like in later expansions the only really awesome experiences were in raids, which is more demanding (admittedly I quit before raidfinder or whatever it is)
---
I've cleaned my entire apartment. I've actually started cooking again. I brush my teeth now. I read more, and I just feel better about myself.
---
We need classic on switch
---
Forcing ppl to PvE to PvP was part of why I loved vanilla so much. I was not forced to grind BGs/Arenas to get gear and be competitive against the top PvPeers
---
Reminds me of bloodninja
---
They completed the attunement and getting ready to enter BWL.
---
I immediately recognized this map just by the road alone. This is a great job OP.
---
The one buying accounts against EULA/TOS is an idiot. Original owner always has claim rights for the account, the buyers should know this. Also don't buy Blizzard accounts srsly... The are most likely stolen in the first place, you as a buyer have no idea if it's just a hacked account sold to you. Just recover the account before more damage is done...
---
How many times do we have to teach you this lesson, old man?
---
but he is funny af
---
 !RemindMe 77 days
---
Clean start. These posts are from people recovering their old wow accounts in retail.
---
Druids aren’t the most coveted healers, so you’ll probably have a harder time finding spots in top guilds. However, healers are always needed so you’ll find a spot in a semi-hardcore guild pretty easily. 5 mans druids are pretty annoying because you don’t have a rez, meaning you need another class that can Rez (which means a pally/shammy or priest) for wipe insurance unless you’re confident brez is all you’ll need.
---
Brez is super helpful in raids and your healing is fine. Multiple restos aren’t great but two is probably not a huge deal (three might be pushing it idk). Mow is a good buff and thorns is great for the tank, and innervate is always amazing. 
---
Overall you’re not the best healer but you provide a fuckton of utility. If you’re only playing to heal I wouldn’t recommend but if you want one of the most (imo) fun to level, flexible hybrid healers to play I think it’s a great fit
---
Those were dark days. People don't even recognize that tough feat today. :'(
---
Gotta be honest, that's some of the weirdest upper case use I've seen in quite a while.
---
It’s Beta. Do Beta things.
---
Kinda low effort post there mate, you did not even link the quest.

Here is the story about Ezra if you have not read it yet, sad and awesome at the same time.

Here is the quest it resulted in:  [https://www.wowhead.com/quest=11129/kyles-gone-missing](https://www.wowhead.com/quest=11129/kyles-gone-missing) 
---
Which was added in wotlk according to wowhead. I dont feel like making noise to get this quest in is any good
---
&gt;We cleared the content 13 years ago. There's no point in trying to be top whatever. It's already been done.
---
The competition is even higher now, that alone is going to push lots of people to race, especially because everything is figured out skill is going to play a major part in world firsts. Similar to speedrunning where seconds are very important. If anything it's more interesting now.
---
I very often use names that would be considered clan or nick names. Like the dwarf warrior Bronzefist (head canon: A very distantly related bronzebeard clan with a long tradition of serving in the Ironforge armies. Generally a respected clan, but not noteworthy in terms of numbers, political power or wealth)
---
Why have I not heard about the Booty Bay Times sooner!? 
---
'Real' news, 'Real' heroes, 'Real' stories.
---
You can take the tram from stormwind to ironforge or the other way around
---
God forbid you get rewards good for both sides! blasmephy!
---
Why DO you have to do him LIKE that?
---
If someone asks nicely and I'm just hanging in org, sure why not, I even go around and buff rendom ppl with int while I'm in a city/quest hub
---
THEY ALSO TOOK LIKE 2 HOURS TO RUN SM AT LEVEL 30 CHILL THE F OUT
---
Dailies only worked for Quel'Danas, where you aimed for something and your work directly influenced the world. Great stuff.   
---
I agree, flying was the worst thing they added unless the game had stopped at TBC (which was obviously not an option) ; it would be a nice 'endgame' thing to work towards.
---
Pretty much everything is just how I remembered. Personally I don't miss much from early wow as far as questing and general game play. Talent trees were way more fun and engaging imo and I miss those. 
---
The need to interact with players in order to get things done. The slow pace of dungeons. Marking targets, cc'ing targets, using every ability and trick in your spell book to get the job done. Mana management, aggro management. Dungeons today are the exact opposite from what they were in the beginning. Run them as fast as you can. Period. I don't even have sheep, hex, banish, or enslave on my bars on my toons and haven't for several expansions. 
---
Mainly I just miss the comradery that existed back then. The guild I was in for years and the friends I made and played all aspects of the game with. They all went their separate ways and I'm the only one left. 
---
Making new friends in a cross server, dungeon finder version of the game where everyone has * by their name meaning you can't trade with them or be in a guild together has been impossible. Most people who play the game now are pretty dickish. Can't get thru a dungeon or raid without someone trashing other people. Even when someone warns others they're new (to the content or to the game in general) people still act like assholes towards them. Players just take all the fun out of the game anymore. 
---
I still have that furlbog quest item on my 120 mage.
---
He's thinking about the good of the guild though. It's like saying that random 100 dps rogue could get first Thunderfury just because he too was in the raid. Guilds using loot council are either quite bleeding edge focused, or have corrupted officers. Also I don't think DKP should be used at all for off-spec/pvp items as it directly harms the guild as it's counterproductive to the guild's goals. Imo most important items like TF etc should be loot counciled regardless of the kind of system the guild uses. Main spec gear should be assigned with DKP, side-grade/miniscule upgrades rolled or given with big discount and pvp/off-spec items should be rolled but only by those who actually need them in that priority order so that it makes it less punishing for things like your healers who don't have to waste DKP just to get farming gear. It also minimizes the chances of some actually useful items from being disenchanted because people are saving DKP for some bigger and more contested bis item.
---
Guilds typically take 1 spriest.
---
In 5-mans your biggest disadvantage is no res for wipes. In raids the disadvantage is your raw value per second is just lower than every other healer. You bring unique utility, enough to justify bringing 1-3 Druids, but they aren't topping the charts for sure.
---
Shadow priests? No. Priests are brought to heal. 
---
The raid *might* take one shadow spec priest for Shadow Weaving, but even then you won’t be DPS. You’ll still heal.
---
If you want the whole shadowmage thing, roll a Warlock
---
This is gold
---
how far behind is priest dps behind lock?
---
Why would you play a faction that has gnomes when the other one has fucking undead, huge cows and big fucking pouldrons?
---
Only if by competitive you mean e-sports  
---
DAOC had very competitive group pvp for instance
---
For the first content phase, a guild with mostly capable players will initially spend about 4 to 5 hours on Ony/MC each week. Once the guild is geared out, MC will take round about 2 hours.
---
In content phase two you're looking at about 6-8 hours of raiding each week at the start, and once gear levels rise, raiding time goes down to about 4-5 hours.
---
Of course, if a guild decides to push the boundaries and deliberately speed up clear times they can, without too much effort, bring Molten Core down to about an hour, and BWL down to about 1 hour, 20 mins.
---
You will however spend a sizable amount of time each week doing raid preparations, and the game gets especially demanding during Naxxramas progression. I spoke to a friend of mine who told me he burned through more than 2k gold's worth of consumables in the first week of raiding Naxxramas. Though he was horde at the time, and horde burns through a lot more consumables than alliance because paladins are just that good.
---
I started playing in BC I enjoyed the dailies but I was in high school so endgame I really just had time for my dailies and raid prep then scheduled raids. It’s interesting to see erveryones input who has been playing since vanilla. 
---
LFR and LFG in mind mind was really the downfall of the game because it dissolved the need for a community.
---
oh snap you're right
---
Nice work! Keep it up! Would be a nice series for all the dungeons.
---
Honestly, part of me would like this sort of label for all NPC's until you interact with them. Literally, you have to talk to an NPC to learn his/her name.
---
Aussie time?
---
I love this
---
The point is mainly the launch. After launch zones will be full of players of the same level and before they spread all over the world it may be problematic.
---
Depends on the Content patch you are in really.
---
In the beginning Spriest are not that far behind Warlocks - they are just far superior in healing :d
---
With AQ40/Naxx, Warlocks just become beasts and outdps a Spriest by a large margin
---
Yeah, will be brutal. But the race balance is of course not equal. Trolls are not very popular compared to Undead (although Orcs are very popular, so Durotar will be crowded), and I believe I saw a poll showing Humans being nearly twice as popular as any other Alliance race the other day. Mulgore and Teldrassil are likely to be the least crowded!
---
Horde-side is the same, with one half in the sludge fen (northern Barrens, Kalimdor), and the second being in the sea, northern coast of Silverpine it is.
---
Def. not rolling on a streamer server, it has way more disadvantages than advantages. Im just going to the second most populated pvp server in my region, if there are more than 1.
---
Since 90% of the streamers will be horde, that server will be heavily horde sides which means, world pvp will be bad or almost non existant. Also many ppl will dodge the server servers, so even less allys (because they dont wanna get ganked by them)
---
Also the AH prices will suck because every one think "im gonna put this thing for way more than its worth because maybe streamers will buy it anyway with donated gold".
---
Next point, their viewers will do everything for a little fame, donating gold, items and free raids. So they have everything.. for doing nothing.
---
Well if these numbers are accurate there is no worries, plenty of raiding time :)
---
Thanks.
---
Yes I want Classic to be a rebirth of the original game for their original player base (including new ones who fit). I played Blizz games for the better part of my life and fell in love with Warcraft 3 and I still play. I love that community and am member of dozens of Discord Channels. But I know that with Diablo Immortal, Overwatch, Every WoW expension, Starcraft 2 remakes Blizzard is looking for more people to play their games. And like my 10% upvotes, we are now severely outnumbered. 
---
So I hoped Reforged and Classic would be a small niche for us. Reforged is a different story as we where pretty fine. We're all anxious on old battle.net, but also hopefull and optimistic about Reforged. This is their old fanbase who is now to small to sustain the company off. Retail must be the bigger version for monitization and hopefully accesability. I hoped we could forge a community with people from the private server, so we would be big enough to sustain our own game and have some updates in the future. However the game should be way to inaccesable and difficult for most people. It should be like War Thunder and Classic is Flight Simulator. Retail should be and stay Arcade Mode. 
---
Like I said, I don't want Classic to be another Retail. Vanilla for Fanboys. I think this is a mistake and most OG's have left and I kinda hoped Blizz wanted to do something about that. And show some repriocity. I think Classic should mostly be for the 10% that liked my post no offense, this alignes with the 10% that got to MC and Raiding. And people like yourself maybe... Fair &amp; Open Minded and looking to waste some time and dedication to have fun in a game.
---
Warlock
---
Since one of you has to run anyway - you could both take your time and run to the Nightelf starting area.
---
I guess it will be the least populated in the beginning together with the tauren starting Zone. 
---
Better than having one wait for the other ;)
---
It depends on what their goal was, if the goal was to see the content while it's current at a for them enjoyable pace, then no, they did not fail. 
---
This "tough love" mentality is a prominent example of why the MMO community and in this case the WoW one, can be somewhat unpleasant. 
---
Guess we still have time to get Ahead of the Curve for that, lets be more respectful and considerate towards one another.. See it as a practise for when Classic goes live and you're bound to a server instead of a name you can just change :)
---
Just one Shadow Priest. They have a place in raiding, its not necessary but its viable 100%.
---
Gnome racial isn't necessary. Its still BiS if your min/maxing. Ultimately it ends up being like .50% extra crit, and a couple extra hundred mana.
---
&gt; I suspect they just haven't implemented it fully yet.
---
Or part of the code responsible for putting keys into keyring has been disabled or removed entirely since Classic client is based on Legion (or BFA) one. And according to other posters keyring isn't present in them.
---
BTW I wonder if similar problem is present also for soulbags.
---
Yeah, it makes me think of lightning which is what Shamans are all about.
---
Pink makes me think "cute and harmless" which fits the Paladin.
---
Make a char on a private server, play at least 10 levels. Try different classes. Have fun
---
True. However that also applies to some extend to all those warriors and rogues and whatever fotm people like to level way more than there are raid spots. Sure, getting one of 10 spots should be easier than getting the single spot that might not even exist in every raid, but there is no guarantee, no matter what you level/spec.
---
Want an easy raid spot, be a warlock or priest or shaman. Unless suddenly, everyone rolls one (like it looks like in some polls).
---
Guilds usually will just take 1 or 2 at most Shadow priests on a raid.
---
As a shadow priest you are essentially more viable the more warlocks you have.
---
If the guild already has a Shadow priest, or most likely even if they don’t there’s an incredibly good chance they will just tell you to be a healer.
---
Nah, the problem is that keys aren't automatically put into keyring and therefore it never shows up.
---
yes, you get the point. Same goes for life
---
Profession bags still exist in the modern game, don't they?
---
Typically? No.
---
Try the French, it's even more true :°
---
For using remote desktop? lol
---
Awesome post ! Always wanna hear about things like this !
---
They don’t have nearly the sustainable DPS a Warlock has even then. Way too many issues with mana. 
---
Also, you won’t really be brought to be DPSing, you’ll be brought to debuff with Shadow Weaving and then you’ll be supporting your party.
---
I'm not disagreeing with you, but on the private server launches, I've always rolled tauren druid. Anyone rolling a druid will be in either teldrassil or mulgore, which will beef up those numbers.
---
Bunch of fucking noobs in here, that's why they're praising DKP. Guild's that are worth your time will be using Loot Council, because the DKP guilds will die before finishing AQ40.
---
No, it’s not typical. The DPS increase isn’t that huge and they go OOM as fast as a Balance Druid. It’s much more efficient to bring in Priests to heal.
---
removing the limit is one of those things that would not take away from the classic feel of the game. a technical limitation from 2004 is not nostalgic. should they limit your resolution in wow classic to 1024 x 786 or only 4.3 resolutions because thats what we used then?  i think classic can be used to make all the minor changes and tweaks they intended to but never got around to, whilst preserving the original vision and feel.
---
People are downplaying the difference but +5 weapon skill is all around a pretty huge deal. Troll is more optimal for end-game main tanking if you expect a Thunderfury in a super min/max environment but Orc is the safer bet.
---
Players pay more than 1000g for Edgemaster’s Handguards (no stats just +7 skill) and take it over items like Devilsaur or other stat bombs.
---
If that does not tell you how incredibly huge +5 weapon skill is then I don’t know what will.
---
If you are an Undead warrior then the word “competitive” is stretching it.
---
The warrior version of this thread: "Warrior and dying, and dying, and dying....."
---
Was there a ratchet flight path in vanilla 1.12? I remember walking there a lot, I can't remember when the FP was added.
---
My request for a left-right fill for hunter bar got in, yay! Thanks a lot man. Looks great.
---
Maybe this is a bit hunter noob question, but what does the multishot clip area refer to? I used to fire multishot after an autoshot.
---
You won't need the latest expansion. You can activate a trial account by just paying the monthly sub. It gives access up through Legion. All Classic needs is an active sub. So you don't need to buy any box, digital or physical.
---
&gt; the only issue is all the bloat on the website and advertisements.
---
uBlock Origin and uMatrix makes the internet much nicer to use.
---
Trolls and Tauren are better tanks than Orcs are.
---
Yes, but once you set the precedent of caving to one of those demands, those demands then get a sense of validation and it becomes a shitstorm. Would I love older AV? Yes. But I wouldnt want it to undermine the integrity of the game and its devs since theyve come out and said 1.12 with very minimal changes.
---
Can Rogues detect and/or disable the mines?
---
Huh? While i ahree that they are not top dps they certainly arent the lowest of the pure dps classes. That would be hunters.
---
I ordered a poster size of 700mm by 500mm of the map and got a frame waiting. I'll post a picture when it's on the wall. Thanks for the work you put in!
---
There are OG Vanilla pics of C'Thun kills with a boomkin.
---
Just put the oomkin in a group with 4 mages and it's already not that bad.
---
You absolutely don't have to speedlevel. Enjoy this amazing experience at your own pace. You'll still get to do whatever you want at max level.
---
Take it at your own pace
---
Or used roger wilco/vent and queued up at the same time.
---
You must speed level, if you miss 2nd week MC clear, its very hard to catch up after
---
No, you should only speed level if you want to. The vanilla leveling experience is to many, one of the highly positive and rewarding aspects of the game. So do it at a pace that suits you and makes you enjoy it.
---
There will be plenty of time for you to experience both leveling and endgame
---
And the transformation will kill your enchants, making it an expensive endeavour.
---
I love it. This is exactly what i've been laughing about since the classic announcement. People complaining about any little shit feature not being in classic to preserve "the real vanilla experience" like exactly this. "Why are there quest givers on the map", "Why are there raid frames different than in vanilla". And my favourite "Why are the Shadows of a better quality?!". And whenever they do change the stuff for them they go "I gotta get an addon for that, its unplayable... give me markers for quests, quest helper, grid, xpearl ". Hypocrisy at its finest. 
---
I genuinely believe its the you yourself that "destroyed" the game for you. Becouse People like this got addons for every little feature they couldnt handle the game become what it is now and what you tend to hate.
---
I thought that too, until I read some things about retail's current state of leveling. You'll be getting rewards through leveling at a better pace than retail. Having to buy and upgrade your spells yourself initially sounds annoying, but it solidifies the feeling that you just got another upgrade. Retail is just like "here's 10 levels before you get anything. After 80 you just get 2 talents".
---
There is no top group to keep up with. Everyone can play at there own speed because even the first raid Molten Core will be done till the end of classic.
---
Don't sweat yourself and enjoy the game at your own pace.
---
Can someone explain me what Ooga gang is exactly? Just normal dudes ganking streamers?
---
In the early lvls where you dont have good gear (int/spirit) its quite annoying, but later at like lvl 40, you can kill 10 mobs without drinking, depending on mobs hp and your dmg. 
---
Also if you learn new ranks like frostbolt or fireblast you go oom faster because they cost more mana which will compensate when you get better gear again.
---
Lots of differing replies on this thread are just confusing me now. Loads of people are implying that these 'small' differences matter a whole lot.
---
It seems to be very split between "nah just play what you wanna play" and "YOU'LL REGRET IT IF YOU'RE NOT ORC/TROLL"
---
If you want to annoy your fellow group members, Screech is superior.
---
First 9 domo kills, we only got leafs. We even imported alt hunters for the kill to not let them go to waste.
---
haha well I've got 1600hrs+ 15/15 Naxx playing priest on a private server, so I could literally go on like that for hours..
---
Yeah, not old. The graphics in this picture is MUCH BETTER than what it was in Vanilla.
---
"Regrowth: For Regrowth you will be using one of either Rank 4 or Rank 5 (whichever you prefer), and then max rank, meaning you will have a total of 2 Regrowths bound." 
---
Literally from the article.
---
I'm not saying the articles good or bad, but I don't know wth you're looking at...
---
YouTube recommended this today
---
&gt;Warrior is the one class that undeniably gets a buff from this. It may make Tauren Warriors the best race for PvP, at the cost of making every other class the worst.
---
There is no universe where orc isnt the best race for every classe that they can choose in pvp. Tauren are teash ans the only class where they are the best in pvp or pve is druid for obvious reasons.
---
Streamers speed level because this is their job. If wow isn't your job you definitely don't have to.
---
Also, everything you see now is skewed towards more hardcore players because the vast majority of more normal players dont play/post/stream or even think too much about the game 3 months before it's even launched.
---
And you totally should ! Very interesting since I plan to main priest in classic.
---
Did Blizzard ever mention if they have any plans in case a lot of people stop playing Classic when (or if) the hype dies down? I expect people to keep playing for quite a few months, but eventually the limited amount of content will be felt by many players and I'm afraid I would end up in a server with barely anyone left to group up with for raids or PvP.
---
Although character transfers exist I would rather not have to pay up just because Blizzard used vanilla servers with no cross realm options. That's one of the reasons why I'm not even considering playing Classic on a local server (Brazil), where I don't suffer with high pings, because with so few of us the effect of players quitting Classic after a couple months will be more noticeable.
---
It is known.
---
I know OOM, he said oomph
---
Yeah I much prefer the Second War factions which IIRC were humans, high elves, and dwarves against orcs, trolls, ogres, and goblins.
---
I guess its easy vs casters cuz they have to stand still
---
thats about it
---
Never were, never will be.
---
This guy raids
---
Jesus that's such a good twist on the min-maxers lol
---
People are a lot more concerned with the meta now and what works and what doesn't. Casual raiders more than likely won't down C'Thun with an oomkin. I suppose it depends on your definition of casual.
---
I Think Three is a hunter trailer in SW just ner to the tram
---
Server transfer would be fine but the rest can stay in retail.
---
Aimed Shot pauses auto attacks so tou want to cast it right in between autoattacks to not lose DPS
---
Awesome thank you!!
---
That s low, damn
---
Arguably still art but I'm not sure.
---
This was a dangerous time to get your account hacked
---
Weeks/months of preparation and practice goes into those speedruns
---
1-60 in 17 days
---
More like playing off and off.  :\^)
---
Use a sock like the rest of us.
---
Pathetic.
---
Funny you should say that it has the complexity of a mobile game now. One theory I had that that they are trying to simplify WoW enough to have a version on mobile, like Fortnite is on mobile. Every developer looking at mobile. The former director of WoW moved over to an unannounced mobile game.
---
It if course wouldn't be the same client or servers. Retail is too big, has too many expansions for a phone. But the core class mechanics could probably fit on mobile. So could crafting.
---
The meme is a dream. Dwarfchads will be too DPS and top heal, as always.
---
The only thing I'm afraid I'll miss is AQ. I didnt do raid in vanilla because I was an impatient 14 year old and only pvp'd. But from what I understand AQ is a limited time thing and only for 1 faction on the server? But that's in a later phase and I have no clue how long each phase will last.
---
That troll is perfect.
---
I just mean competitive in the sense that I want to be able to do all the content, I guess, I won't be going for realm firsts or anything. I'll be rolling in a guild with a bunch of my friends. If it is seriously as detrimental than most of these other comments are saying then I'll go Orc or Troll.
---
The edge is real.
---
Undead rogue, black and white intro, 144p, some emo metal, STVietnam. The stage is set.
---
You'll get a spot somewhere as long as you're not retarded and have two hands ready to click the same 2 buttons over and over. People today will probably clear the raids without as much preparation anyway, only slower. Mechanics are a joke anyway.
---
I had lost my original CD-key so I thought I wouldn't be able to recover my old vanilla account, but a few days ago  I tried anyways and the GM was super helpful and he managed to dig up my original account and restored a bunch of deleted lvl 60's on it. To top it off he even gave me a month of gametime on both my original account and my retail account, and some free pets. I though I was fucked when he asked me to answer my secret question which was "What is your favorite movie" and I have literally no idea what I possibly answered to that 15 years ago.
---
You just give more exact requirements to /who until you get less than the maximum number of results, like e.g. filtering by level/zone/class. Then you just count different names. It's a lengthy process and obviously not entirely without error. People could relog while this process runs. Still, it's a pretty solid indicator.
---
This is true, i just asked a gm about it 2 days ago. Your account name is set in stone and will never be changable. Changing the name of the owner of the account, sure, or even the email is technically possible (given provided id and such) but the name your account is called on battle net is forever. I asked because mine is super old, my brother made it as a joke account and it has a super silly name. I took over it when he stopped playing and it had my druid on it that i kept playing.
---
Thats obviously an account made pre battle net. I dont know abour accounts that are made with battle net.
---
Disarm trap max range is greater than the flare, so you disarm the trap, sap the hunter and wait out the flare, then you get a full opener. They'll probably get a scatter off but with sprint/blind/vanish you should be able to kill him as you'll have applied crippling poison. Dwarfs can be hard if they stone form your poison/bleeds and they out gear you, but every other race a good Rogue should beat. Bonus points if you vanish the scatter shot or blind his trap.
---
Lol... what do you think only like 500 people are playing classic when it comes out?
---
omg this...
---
Can YOU provide evidence of your claim that it’s not like this? I’ve seen some insane DPS number disparities in my day. The person you asked already provided a source.
---
If you never want to join a group and solo rank to 13/14 shadowpriest is the specc for you, and pray that you get a raid thet gives you atleast some offset pieces.
---
Everything other Warlock.
---
You should rly play warlock, Shadowpriest is not a class and if you are not fine with healing if everything gos wrong you should play warlock.
---
I Maine’s holy pally but didn’t start until BC.
---
Could be pretty cool for grinding while in the bus or whatever.
---
I completely forgot about this spell, but shadowmeld was actually usefull.
---
Yo fuck what anyone says about retail. 
---
Demon Hunter is a fun as fuck class. Legion was a fantastic expansion and if BfA was just as good I'd be all over that too.
---
I'll miss ending up in the gutter because stuff would take so long to load you'd end up running straight into it while lagging.
---
Switching to walk to enter Blackrock Mountain as well or risk a drop into the lava. Yes, I had a potato to play on back then.
---
&gt;  If it was doable with garbage players 14 years ago why would it not be doable with decent players on worse specs now?
---
Few pointers: Content gets easier as people get geared. I can assure you that our first tries in MC did not have half the raid on \/follow, but as soon as we were kitted in T1/T2 mix, more and more people afk'd for more and more time.
---
Then, some bosses simply require certain mechanics only available to select classes. You can be the best geared Protection Paladin on the server, but your lack of a taunt means you are useless for quite some boss fights (because they require timed aggro switches).
---
Then still, raids get more demanding of everyone as players progress through them. And if you wipe on the TwinEmps for the third week at 5% or less, people *will* demand that the "fun spec players" start pulling their weight, because they are not cutting it any more.
---
If you were to boil down the "duality" of this problem, it's a case of "pull your weight": It's okay to not pull it if others pick up your slack (and are fine doing that), and are *able* to pick it up. As soon as the content doesn't tolerate your lack of weight-pulling, you're gonna be either forced to switch your spec - if possible - or you'll be benched/kicked in favour of a player that brings the full weight of their spec/class. And I don't know about you, I would not want to be "the one Enhancer/Boomkin/Ret" with the knowledge that I'm not really a part of a raid's success, and I'm just around because the raid can afford to carry me.
---
I think the word you're looking for is the name is an "anachronism."
---
I am going to play pally but I want a cat. Should I plan to level in elf areas to get that rep? Only played horde starting in BC
---
For some reason I felt like you post gave me an intense feeling of satisfaction with those 6,660,000 seconds.
---
Dude, I've never tanked before in my life, and said fuck it, hopped in a dungeon as a blood elf pally and I'm tossing around shields like I'm captain america, spamming consecration because it doesn't cost mana any more  (or at least didn't at that level) and somehow clearing the whole dungeon without any wipes. I was seeing how many I could pull before we wiped, but no matter what I did, we wouldn't wipe. It made me feel kinda hollow, seeing what the game had become.
---
Let other people tell u how to have fun
---
It's not overstated. Most guilds will take 2 hunters on raids and that s for tranq shot and maybe pulls/kiting. Past BWL our DPS is pretty poop. We re alright on cleave fights like Kel Thuzad tho, my guild had hunters in top5 constantly.
---
Ofc it is, it’ll be harder for casual guilds, and pugs cuz of it.
---
Don't believe this is true. At least, it didn't work that way on private servers.
---
M8 - If you want to - speedlevel as much as you want.
---
It get's very difficult to Keep up after some time. If you get drained - just take it slow and enjoy. :)
---
Thats the amazing Thing about classic. You can go either way. If you are not 60 within the first 2-3 month's that is not even a Problem.
---
Just take your own paste and enjoy you time :P
---
There's no need to loot council TF, it goes to the MT. Period.
---
Anything else is idiotic.
---
Back in the day I had a priest and a hunter, played with them from classic to cata, stopped playing until legion and tried to pick it up again... turns out my sister who had a warlock on my account bought a shit ton of gold from Chinese bots, got caught and got my account closed... had to make a new account when starting legion because no amount of pleading with blizzard could get my account back :( wish I could play my priest again
---
How does one collect hierlooms again? I think I have an hierloom on one character somewhere but think I only had honor enough to buy one I think. (It was honor or PvP rep or something, right?)
---
WoW players having girlfriends.
---
HAAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAAH GOOD ONE!
---
Lul
---
Yup keep to your limits and you’ll be fine! Happy Wowwing!
---
This is making me want to look at the Classic again. XD
---
&gt; Anathema, Benediction, Thunderstrike, and Shadowstrike will now remember the enchantments and durability data they possessed when they transform. 
---
You are correct, it apparently got changed in patch 1.8. That is great news.
---
Is this a screenshot for ants?
---
Lol no.
---
If it's your first time playing vanilla - you won't be able to speed level so don't worry about it.
---
If you try to you will get burned out by the time you are level 48 and don't have a mount.
---
Dat Tauren hit range. Also you can equip shield and 1h if you know there are rogues around 🙋🏻‍♂️ but take orc to be sure.
---
Why did you /s?
---
You forgot the most important use for Mind Vision. When dueling or encountering a rogue you can use Mind Vision before he enter stealth. Then cast shadow word pain to break stealth when he is in range
---
I cant remember how it was on 60 but atm on lvl40 in the beta, you dont even specc imp blizz for aoe farming. Atleast i dont. 
---
Just pull the mobs, stack them, nova, go 5m away, flamestrike followed by CoC, both will most likely crit because of shatter, then AE till theyre dead. Blizzard takes way too long and costs too much mana.
---
&gt;  I was just trying not to die.
---
Well of course, as a hunter your sole purpose is to make everyone else die, then stand around dancing while they run back. /s
---
Sorry, all this talk about vanilla awoke some bad memories of terrible players that often seemed to play hunters.
---
Wdym can't lock xp? How you twink then?
---
Oomph (pronounced oomf) is a phrase that means roughly how much of a punch something packs.
---
"He delivered that punch with some extra oomph"
---
"He lifted that weight with some oomph!"
---
It's basically the impact something has. It can be used for a lot of things.
---
Wut
---
I'd play a rogue and gank you when you're 30 levels below me. Corpsecamp you and laugh my tits off when you create a character on my faction to whisper me abuse.
---
Yup! Eragøn the Hallowed!
---
Originally the lands of Stormwind were called Azeroth, but the term was later used for the whole of the planet.  "The Eastern Kingdoms include the three continents of Lordaeron, Khaz Modan and Azeroth."
---
For me it's mostly about the starting zones, since after 30 you'll be questing in similar areas. 
---
I love dun morough and mulgore, hate durotar and elwynn, and I'm ok with tirisfal and teldrassil . Kinda weird, but that's just the way I am. I don't like the dry biomes much, and I hate the barrens. I tend to go Alli because I enjoy the game, specifically from 1-20, far more than I do on horde.
---
Just play what you wanna play
---
We had an undead MT and probably would have gone all the way if not for half the guild deciding  to reroll alliance on a fresh server.
---
Sooo - you understood it a Little wrong I think.
---
There is an AQ Opening Event. That is a one time per Server Thing and will be over when someone bangs the gong.
---
That is the way you get that Ilusive Legendary Mount and the title "Scarab Lord" as soon as TBC Comes along :P
---
Both factions work together to open AQ20 and AQ40 and after it is opened both factions can go and raid AQ.
---
So you won't miss anything even if you are very very slow :P Take your time!
---
We used DKP in vanilla and we cleared up to 4H.
---
I'm not saying it's the better system I'm just saying it's possible to clear everything using it.
---
That icy weapon enchant looks so nice.
---
Wtf is this lol
---
Horde.
---
I think they already had gnomes in the alliance but i am not sure.
---
Lmao
---
If you plan to ever PVP, go dwarf.  
---
If you are gonna strictly only ever pve, you can choose human just because you like the look. Even still, dwarf is better with natural resistance and stoneform in AQ/Naxx 
---
Dwarf is 100% BIS for paladin. 
---
Dont bother weighing in wep skill for ret because - you wont be ret. 
---
Dont bother with spirit since paladins dont give two shits about spirit - its all about crit crit crit.
---
No one is going to "dkp" thunderfury.
---
I have tried speed leveling (quite a lot of times tbh), and taking my time. When I do not rush to 60, but spend time doing the instances (maybe even more than once) and low level PvP and other shenanigans, I find that I enjoy the leveling experience far more, and you meet alot more players to add to your friends list.
---
I thought feral doesnt get anything from WF totem ? And because of that they are much better in alliance, because pala buffs ?
---
You can do AQ when ever you want after the gates open.
---
Hell, you can go ahead and do it on BfA at the moment too!
---
Once the gates open they are open to all players and all factions.
---
You're not supposed to die a lot while levelling (except PVP of course).
---
It means you don't pay attention to your surroundings and don't anticipate.
---
I levelled 3 warriors, a priest, a rogue, a mage and a hunter to 60 back in Vanilla, I never died a lot and I'm a middle of the pack player as far as skill goes.
---
Unless its melee classes 
---
Whenever I know a rogue or two, or rogue and warrior are defending a flag I’m so happy. 
---
Let me introduce you boys to the BOP cap real quick
---
Orc is great because of the axe specialization as well. 
---
Tauren stun plus range though. Im going Orc simply because of the axe spec and stun resist but tauren stun and range is honestly super clutch.
---
Aww hell no fam, I'm not trying to do Baron Geddon with half my healers on Candy Crush.
---
[Good enough to nerf what his guild struggles with so they can beat the tier before a new tier releases\*](https://images-ext-2.discordapp.net/external/CD8pzI1_w4RhYP511b1sjnkt5aucVaf5w6LSyFIv5tc/https/i.imgur.com/VWKRTxY.png?width=1145&amp;height=676)
---
&gt;You sound like that dbag mage I out assholed. 
---
Might be, but he is a dbag mage with unlimited water and food
---
On Alliance rolling a rogue is a gearing nightmare, warriors take everything you hold dear except tier set.
---
On Horde they at least dont take your swords
---
maga
---
Time to start grinding with only 34g in your pocket!
---
They are not the heroes we need, but the heroes we deserve.

---
mother would get off while being withholding to you.
---
Hey there, thanks for giving such a detailed how-to! This comment is not only there for me as an anchor on how to set things up when classic launches (why hello there, future-me!) but also because I have a question.
---
In your setup you got these HUGE tiles, which are awesome for mobile, but is there a way to quickly swap between 'mobile' layout and regular layout? While I will do some downtime grinding on mobile and what-not, I will definitely spend most of my time on PC. Is there anything you do for that?
---
When describing it, it sounds a lot like a mobile game.  Eww.
---
Rage timer seems to be elapsed...
---
Axe spec seems to only be remotely useful in PvE, and not even then because you are not going to be hitting anything in a raid.
---
Stun resists obviously sounds op but I am wondering how worth it is because I thought that shaman is not too bad against e.g. rogue already which can make it less important.
---
If you like speeding to a red light, go for it. Otherwise just take it slow or fast, but don't let people decide for you.
---
np
---
That’s a really bad guess then
---
Cool, didn't know that. Where did you find that quote?
---
Maybe they should even make the new expansions free too, since we already have a monhtly subscription plus microtransactions already ingame.
---
This is dope
---
Back when the game didn't start at max level, but from level 1. Good times.
---
There’s an obvious veiled statement being made here, that Classic will somehow be harder than most private servers as of today. It doesn’t really hold true.
---
Just recently (a month ago or something), KTs armor was confirmed at 3000. The private server standard was (and still is) 4800 armor. This was confirmed by analyzing white hit damage from retail vanilla videos, where we also saw all debuffs  the boss had and all the stats of the players in question. 
---
By doing this, you land pretty much at exactly what the numbers should be, the only variable will be the weapon hit damage that can usually range between 30-50, but even this is easily averaged out. 
---
The same method has been used for almost all bosses, and none of them had the correct armor value, most were much higher, and many were intentionally buffed. 
---
I’m bringing this up because even though some factors are off on private servers, the whole point of the emulation project is to emulate the classic experience. They didn’t know about the parry chance of bosses, but they emulated the fights in detail still. The end result was that even though variable x, z and y might be a bit of, a, b and c end up being overtuned to compensate. The result is that for the most part, bosses hit just as hard as they did back then, just as often, and tanks take very comparable damage. The same holds true for damage dealt by players. 
---
No one is really claiming that private servers had everything right, they are claiming that the end result, with all factors accounted for, results in pretty much the same values. You might not have six apples and four oranges, you might have eight of one and two of the other, the end result is still ten.
---
As for tanks specifically, fury prot or DW tanking is only a thing for overgeared guilds, even on private servers. Where tanks literally want to take more damage, and force crits from bosses, in order to generate more TPS. It will definitely be a thing in classic, and parry haste arguably helps them achieve the TPS now that they can’t sit down to receive crits. 
---
The whole fantasy people have about this game being really hard is weird. The hard part is playing together as a team of 40 people, once you clear that hurdle, the content you face is really only hard the first few times you clear them. That’s just the nature of the game, it was that way back then, and it will be even more so this time around come classic release. 
---
Remember all the whining and outrage over ‘fake classic’ when the beta started, how mobs supposedly hit for less, how elite damage was needed and regen rates buffed. Everyone seemingly claiming that blizzard had secretly made the game much easier. Then they busted that myth. 
---
This is exactly the same, people grasping at straws trying to cling to some weird fantasy about how this game is the hardest game ever made, when in reality it was a laid back mmo for its time, created specifically to cater to average players. It is also by no means an overstatement that mmo players in general are some of the worst gamers in terms of mechanical skill. 
---
By no means, don’t fret about difficulty, I’m sure your guild will wipe countless times to easy fights.
---
WoW in all its forms will always be that monkey on my back and I'm ok with that
---
babyrage 4head
---
This is a misunderstanding.
---
AQ is a raid-instance that wasn't released in the way of:
---
Patch=&gt;Now it's available
---
It was released in a way where the patch only enabled an event that requires all players to work together to open the instance.
---
For that tremendous amounts of resources (trade-goods of all levels) had to be donated towards the so-called "AQ war effort".
---
After that a quest-chain is unlocked. That quest-chain is the hardest that ever existed in wow because it requires you to get stuff from all the world-bosses and raid-bosses. And only one person can hand in the final-quest. So it makes sense to "elect" someone to complete the quest and everyone helps this person because if everyone tried to get it on their own the doors of AQ would not open in a long time. The person gets an unique mount as reward.
---
The thing you are likely talking about is the event that happens when the quest is turned in.
---
I haven't seen it myself aswell, but it's described to be awesome and spans the whole Silithus zone.
---
It is very likely that the guild who has the person who will do the Quest-chain will announce in advance when they are going to turn in the quest. If you are active at the time you should be able to hear about it and attend the event.
---
Fals3
---
Kappa
---
Exactly, it's a good game and a great adventure - and it's designed to be a rewarding experience
---
On the day before release, discuss and plan everything with my friends im going to play with.
---
On release day, sleep few hours before midnight (EU here) then play the shit out of it. Trying to go fast until 20 to get ahead and the go more chill when everyones spread.
---
These is an FP.
---
So female dwarf is off the list
---
You can also tank all but a small handful of fights in the game.

pure genius

LF a PvP / Horde / PST / Focused on PvP
---
What I’m looking for in a guild:
---
Needs to be horde because for the horde.
---
Heavily preferred a guild on a PvP server, with a huge emphasis on PvP. Preferably also in the PST time zone.
---
What I plan to do in classic:
---
I am going to level to 60 as fast as I possibly can, then I will be taking PvP as seriously as possible. Continuously doing BGs and (preferred) wPvP for 90% of what I do.
---
The 10% on what I’ll be doing is raids very casually, something to do in my off time that I do not plan on taking that seriously but only partly to support my PvP gear. I want to rank at-least 10 PvP and will be putting a big emphasis on what I do to reaching that.
---
About me:
---
I started playing WoW in late 2005.
---
I played as a Hunter 2005 - 2008
---
Wrath I switched to Warlock 2008 - 2013
---
Mists I switched to BM Monk but kept the lock as an alt 2013 - 2017
---
Before legion I switched back to my alt of 10 years Destro lock 2017 - week before Bfa
---
I am very into the end game. Into grinding as hard as I can at the start, no matter how bad or hard it is, so I’m the end I can be the best I can be.
---
I have acted in guilds as officer as well as extra spot.
---
I am full any spot in a guild comfortably and seriously.
---
If I’m an officer I take it seriously.
---
If I’m spot filler I can fill it, take orders, and do them.
---
Characters I am thinking of playing:
---
Frost mage - likely
---
Reason: easy to level, scales decently, great dps.
---
Arms warrior - likely
---
Reason: scales well end game, great dps.
---
Shadow priest - unlikely
---
Reason: I do not like healing, does not scale well end game.
---
Survival Hunter - unlikely 
---
Reason: Not great DPS, really does not scale well end game.
---
I do not plan on having an alt and putting all focus into one character.
---
I also do have a group of friends who will be playing with me and will want to join as well most likely.
---
Friend 1:
---
Frost Mage
---
Friend 2:
---
Holy Priest or Restoration Shaman
---
Friend 3:
---
Subtlety Rogue
---
Friend 4:
---
SL Warlock
---
Also have two more friends who will play PvP but more causally and will not be joining the guild but are open if you need an extra spot ever.
---
Friend 5:
---
Assassination Rogue
---
Friend 6:
---
Shadow Priest
---
You don't  "have" to do shit lol  Play how you want. Trust me when I say this, there will be a stream of people always raiding, new and old. Be it alts or new players that are behind the sweaty gooch computer chair playing people that rushed everything.
---
Yeah 😅
---
“I react to my reaction when I first reacted to the 20min run”

I mean, good. You know how many of those threads exists? Ultimately they're going to release a game they want to.
---
 **&lt;Senile Chieftains&gt;** | EU Pvp Server, Horde | Casual pve raiding guild     
---
**Introduction**    
---
"Senile Chieftains" is made for people who would like to see all the classic raid content (again), but are not able or willing to spend 8 nights a week playing. Of our 4 raids that we will run every week, we only expect you to attend 1. There are options available for people who would like to raid multiple days.    
---
Senile Chieftains is made by ex raiders who have grown to old to raid to many evenings a week. Back in vanilla we cleared aq40 until the 'twin emperors', but because of the "tbc" release the guild disbanded.  One of our officers has all the tbc server first under his belt up to kil'jaeden. So you can expect a mature and experienced raid environment    
---
**Expectations from members**   
---
We are looking for experienced and skilled players to realize our goal of clearing all classics raid content. New players are also welcome, but keep in mind that most of our players are now 30 years and older so we will have a more mature guild environment.      
---
**Raid information**    
---
Raiding days will be Mon-Thur 20:00 - 23:00 (server time). Once available, we will run organized raids on off days for lower tier content for alts and those who want to complete their tier/bis sets. Loot will be distributed by a loot council aided by a hidden dkp system.    
---
Check [https://www.senilechieftains.com/](https://www.senilechieftains.com/) for more information!
---
Take it at your own pace. The people you mention (youtubers, twitch streamers) are part of a (numerically) pretty small group of hardcore-invested players.
---
The "journey" is what a lot of Vanilla is about, contrasted to how leveling functions in modern WoW; It is a cohesive whole that I would encourage *anyone* to experience for themselves at the pace they're comfortable with. I'd also recommend *not* using helper addons, but instead immersing yourself in the world, and go where your own brain tells you to go instead of some hyper-optimized guide - they are usually optimized for exactly one particular thing, be it XP/hour or gold/hour, and do not take anything else into account. That does not mean you cannot use a data bank if a particular quest keeps frustrating you - it just means that you will apply your own effort *first*.
---
It is kinda ironic and sad how some people are clamoring for a streamlined experience before Classic is even out... Something that the entire concept of Classic is anathema to.
---
Time's money, friend!
---
A lot of people in Method also have a job outside of WoW. Do you really think most of CE players dont have a  job? 
---
Oh and its not 1-2%. Its more like 4%. Its actually 4,36% right now on Jaina. KJ was around 2% IIRC.
---
I think you should play the way that you enjoy the most. Personally mount is priority for me
---
I really hope it is a lot longer. Especially the first phase needs to account for leveling time and I'm sure I'm not the only one that can't play the whole day anymore this time around and the more casual guilds won't blast through the content in a few weeks.
---
Play what you want brotha, you don't need to go all nuts  with the min/max. Oh this  raid only needs 1 of this and now spriest etc. You can clear everything with a good all around group and it does not need to nearly be nerded out to the min/max point of ruining your fun.
---
This raid may take this, this raid may take that, just like in vanilla watch what raids take, it's hard enough to field 40 ppl let alone be picky
---
Not only bis gear for their level, some items that they shouldn't be able to get at that level, gotten through raids doing quests.
---
G403 has 3 less mouse buttons and adds weights, more an FPS mouse than MMO, and it's more expensive. G402's my WoW recommendation.
---
They are not using 1.12 mount system, so the precedent is already there.
---
What the fuck was that
---
You have my upvote!
---
Will check it !
---
Not too bad against Rogue? I don't know who told you that.   
---
Rogues will 100 to death you if they use most of their CDs. It's an unwinnable matchup if you don't have a way to deal with stuns. The PvP trinket 5 min CD, Pots 3 min CD or Hardiness passive is not optional but required to beat good Rogues. Shamans that perform well in dueling tournaments are always Orc for this reason.
---
One thing to note however, is that rejuv f.e doesn't stack. So if youre not the only rdruid in the raid / guild you might well find yourself not getting to use rejuv or  being lower prio on gear than the person getting to use it.
---
For some races its easier than others, human and dwarf is not really a problem due to the tram so you can safely meet up by about level 5 or 6.  Night elf you are better to travel around level 13-15.
---
Looking to raid mostly with the odd bout of PvP
---
Interested in Shaman (troll) because they're high in demand and apparently elemental spec is deadly in PvP. Plus I just love the theme of the class.
---
Already ruled out Warrior (too get dependent, not good at solo), Druid (not a fan of shapeshifting), Warlock (soul shards/not a fan of pets), Paladin (alliance) and Hunter (not a fan of pets)
---
Leaves me with Mage (good class but seems dull to me), Rogue (love stealth but they'll probably be overpopulated) and Priest (undead)
---
People on the spectrum are actually pretty talented at games
---
Poggers
---
cross realm first came much later but i do hope that blizzard allows for cross-realm :)
---
How

/clap
---
Don’t speed level
---
I started in 04, but when these came out along with the oxhord stuff, I played them in the bckground.

You pass on “clearly the more fair” implying fair only has one meaning. Who decides what’s fair ? Everyone has their opinion. Nothing makes DKP inherently more fair than LC.

The earliest references to gnomes were in Warcraft II as engineers of the gyrocopters the dwarves are flying.
---
Thanks! This is the info i was most curious about

So what you're saying is that you're a bot ? :p

Kids and in an accountability court. If I was responsible I should have no free time but I’ll probably still game that much.

He died two years before my little brother of the same cancer, so I'm all for this wholesome quest being in Classic. It's a good change.
---
Not drama free. No loot system is. That system is based on critical assumptions that everyone shows up prepared and perform their best. That is isn’t the case, realistically.
---
It’s not a bad system but every system has its flaws.
---
I really hope they don't base their schedule on the hardcore guilds that will rush through the content as fast as possible. Your math only works if you have that dedicated core group that will be there all the time. For a more casual guild, you could easily look at 60 players that need to be geared, and they might not clear a raid the first week it is open. Plus it might take 2 months after release to really get going.
---
Why do you feel a need to speed level because some streamers will? Take your time and enjoy the game. There'll be plenty of time to enjoy end game content due to the phases.
---
Arent BGs going to be cross realm from launch? Probably doesnt make sense to have multiple hour long AVs if you cant leave and rejoin the same battle.
---
As much as i miss the original AV.
---
With age you get a broader appreciation for music, in my opinion.  As an "older" gamer myself I listen to a variety of stuff from 70s rock and disco through all genres right up to modern grime and trance.   A great way to build relationships with players beyond wow is to discuss music taste in groups, linking recommendation.  With the days of spotify soundcloud and youtube you can constantly listen to new music if you choose.

"Back in my day, we walked 8 miles up hill in the snow to get the bus to town to queue outside record stores". /mandatory old person talk
---
lol, the entire point of dkp is to create a fair loot system.  No one said it is the best when worrying about progression or ease of use, but the whole point of it is to be fair.  The clear flaw in loot council is that it is often seen as unfair.

Experienced raider looking for a guild (NA, PVP, Horde).  
---
I began playing toward the end of vanilla (Ive done MC, BWL, and AQ40 ) and raided most of the content in BC and Wrath as a Resto Shaman on Spinebreaker-NA. Quit for real life reasons around the time Icecrown released but looking to re-up my addiction come August. 
---
I’m not able to be too hardcore (I am in my early 30s, have a career, and a dog) but I want to raid seriously a few nights a week and I know my raid mechanics and come prepared with consumables etc.
---
I’m going to roll a priest this time, level as shadow of course, and then plan switch to holy at 60.   Mostly looking for a like minded group of people to play with!
---
High effort rescue!
---
That isn’t my point at all. My point is some perceive LC to be fair others DKP. There isn’t a universal agreement on what fair means, therefore you can’t blanket statement say one is more fair than the other.
---
Haha I have to get through a lot of clips mate :D Good for you, hope you don´t mind :)

Hey as an enhancer shaman you need to be hardcore to get into raids... Worldbuffs and every thing that makes you stronger... As casual I think it will be a wasted raidslot. Because I've done the same... And you're about 200-600 dps depends on wbuffs and wf luck. Go hunter easier to play.
---
It's not like we just didn't use thottbot too, addons are a huge part of wow, and always optional if you don't want to use them.
---
&gt; So mythic has some of the challenge and rewards from the past, but still, everything had it back then.
---
More like, mythic makes old raids such as the vanilla ones generally look like a complete joke.
---
It's blatantly obvious that you DONT raid mythic on live. So consider your discard pvp, and then discard the challenging pve content it's not surprising that you feel there isn't a challenge or a reward to be had.
---
In your mind it's more challenging and rewarding to have to fish for a levelling buff than to raid well designed encounters and finally kill a boss after a challenge.

Oh you don't think that? Funny because when OP was talking about Phase 2 PvP you said:
---
"Hundreds of people will aim to be among the first to get R14."
---
Weird. Now you think they won't do it all in phase 2? Wonder what made you change your mind.
---
I want WoW on my phone/tablet. I could do quests on breaks at work :p
---
This is what layering is for. 
---
They will do less servers and let layers do the heavy lifting and then as the populations fall they’ll need less and less layers.

---
Westfall was mine thanks to the Deadmines quest line, might try to avoid it this time round because I spent so much time there first go round.
---
Try doing that as a warrior. You pulled 2 mobs? Time to blow all your tricks or you might not survive. Run away? Sure, but the mobs around/behind you have already respawned, so you'll start at the beginning of your journey to get to the end of that cave/center of the camp and you might still die on your way out. Many other classes also have problems with adds. My mage can maybe kill 2 mobs in a row with a full mana bar. If they can heal, better drink after every pull because you might just oom otherwise.
---
It will get better with more skills and better gear, but the start can be really unforgiving. Btw. how did you get a wand early on, with no gold and no help you might only get that well after level 10, until then you need to nuke stuff (drinking after every other pull at least) or whack it with a stick/dagger.

My largest criticism is that the volume of your voice is inconsistent. The information is good, editing is good, script is good. Just fix the audio and these videos will be excellent!
---
Dr. Strike says , ask your real doctor. Discs are nothing to mess with. I know a lot about the spine and discs (posterior and anterior) But ask your doc. Also part of this post almost seems like a troll, because it sounds like you are sick of carrying groups lol
---
It was pretty early on in MC now I think of it, probably only a couple of bosses down. 
---
Yea that’s why I’m wondering if it got fixed soon after, but at the time it was definitely a thing...sadly!
---
Yea that's the problem when you have 7 expacs to level through and they don't want to overload anyone with talents and skills. 
---
Especially when you can blaze through 10 levels an hour, nobody really notices a lack of talent points unless they're really starved for attention and want free karma.
---
Leaving my mark for the future. Hi future me. Hope you sorted your shit out, you lazy fuck.
---
It's okay, a lot of people hate change.
---
On the other hand, a lot of people also embrace change.
---
I think it's amazing to grow with the game, but that's just me.
---
Badge gear was a great, goal oriented addition, flying was fun but of course it made the world feel smaller.
---
Also you have to be the nightfall bitch. 😂
---
This would probably require quite a bit of work. I tried to do some very simple things for classic and developed on vanilla. Tested it on the bfa client, oops even lua-specific things and extraction of variable arguments from events are different. 
---
Not impossible, just potentially not a simple backport.
---
No, it's not Dark Legacy :(
---
Cookies and cream
---
Seeing as the game is based off 1.12 I don’t think this will be a thing.
---
&gt; It’ll happen for sure but you start to learn about it. It becomes part of the server story.
---
Very few people at the raiding level *ever* cared about minor things such as a ninja pull, a random insult thrown around or a "rage quit" that you disguised as your cat being on fire one minute after the second wipe. The moment you had the gear to back it up, you could behave like a twat and *most* guilds would still take you for the raid.
---
Hundreds of people will aim to be among the first to get R14. If Phase 2 takes long enough, they will get it during Phase 2. If not, they'll still do the same thing (group gank 24/7) in order to build a foundation and hit R14 among the first in Phase 3.
---
I'm very sorry if I still sound unclear.
---
Yes, that is definitely an error. IIRC it was added in the dire maul patch. It was definitely in the game before battlegrounds were added. I remember seeing a guy with it at southshore/tarrenmill battles and I thought it was so awesome I made a priest myself. I think his name was Civ. He had a pocket warrior with him at all times called Barbarus. Those dwarfs traumatized my rogue.
---
Haha, so true. First they think I'm hitting them and start jumping around but then they notice I'm whacking at their mob.
---
Only downside of that joke is that when you encounter a really good PvPer who does not panic, immediately ignores the mob and pitch perfect all his PvP abilities on you. Mostly they notice halfway that you didn't attack them and they stop and /apologize, but others kill you nonetheless.
---
The next 3 fights will then be when \*I\* want it of course.
---
Show up for every raid and dont be a meme tank(paladins, warrior) youll be fine
---
Why post it here, do you want karma? I'll up vote you man, just chill.
---
If someone said here are 2 esports:
---
Esport 1: You play a character that has 1 button. You must press this button for 10 minutes every 3 seconds. You will need to move your character to avoid fire every 3 minutes.
---
Esport 2: You play a character that has 8 buttons. You will need to use combinations of these buttons around certain specific times during the encounter. You will be pressing a button every 2 seconds at minimum.  You will need to move your character to avoid fire every 10 seconds. You must do this for 5 minutes.
---
By your logic Esport 1 is harder simply because it takes 10 minutes rather than 5.
---
Classic is not harder. It's just more time consuming. And anyone who tries to insinuate that playing classes with rotations that consist of, for example quite literally 99.9% chaos bolt casting for an entire boss encounter isn't easier than retail wow have literally never played the game at any respectable level.
---
Definitely not. 0 chance they will have that many servers on release. /u/Strike1delta is pointing you in the right direction though.
---
DMN hasnt worked on all the private servers
---
When I quit I started learning french. It was one of those moments I typed /played and silently wept about all the shit I could have done in that time. 
---
I didn't truely devote the same amount of time to learning. But I did get my life on a better track and am now living in France! Something I always wanted :)
---
The more streamers get from viewers, the faster they get bored, the faster they quit, the better for others.
---
Horde raids preferably want a shaman in (almost) every group for totems. And being a healer is more forgiving for casuals since you arguably need fewer consumables.
---
Only a few (2-3) Hunter are really needed for raiding so those spots will probably be taken by more "invested" players. 
---
So for casual pve i think a healing shaman will be easier, however for pvp you'd be much more gear dependant than as a Hunter. So for casual pvp a Hunter might bring you more Joy. 
---
Maybe start with a shaman and then level a Hunter later as an alt. :)

\-Horde or Alliance

\-Looking to RAID &amp; PVP. 
---
\-Available late afternoons &amp; evenings (until very late) every day of the week &amp; weekends for both PVP and PVE.  Basically, due to the nature of my work (being self-employed) I can be around 24/7.

I have many years of competitive gaming experience and my guild downed up to Thaddeus months prior to the release of The Burning Crusade. I'm a hardcore gamer and I'd like to play WOW with other players who're just as passionate and dedicated as I am. If this sounds good to you, send me a private message and we can discuss this further.
---
so you are saying classic will have less active players than nostalrius????
---
The amount of misinformation here is staggering..
---
It's actually really easy: Stoneform is crazy good in PvP. It gives an edge against Warriors with their bleeds and physical damage and helps against Hunters that want to drain your mana with viper sting. Yes you can cleanse that, but that costs mana and a gcd. Most importantly is it's use against Rogues tho: Having stoneform is pretty much an I win button. Removing Bleeds and poisons is nice, but being immune against blind fucks up there complete rotation. If you are playing on a PvP server this will be your life insurance.
---
Having 10 extra frost resist is nice too.
---
Humans are pretty much mandatory if you ever want to try to do DPS as a paladin. People will tell you it's impossible, but with the right itemization and enough effort, you can escape the very last Recount positions. This will be MUCH harder as a Dwarf.
---
any class with any time is feasible. There will always be people forming raids new and old.  So maybe you don't splooge out and rush to 60, but there will be lots of others that will be right there with ya
---
Mmh you'd like that huh?!
---
I still watch this video and it still makes me laugh
---
I spoke to the doctors but they say the same thing
---
“Leave the party if you don’t like carrying so much”
---
But if this happens all the time does this mean I should stay solo?!?
---
My advise is: Don't come back. You have to carry so much players, which are unable to think by themselves... It will break your back in no time or at the latest at a high level dungeon.
---
But nice trolling here!
---
Haha what a bait!
---
This needs more upvotes. Please keep them coming.
---
Any idea when it got fixed?
---
I’ve gone to the doctors but they always suggest to leave the party but that’s not a viable solution if i keep carrying...
---
Didn't he say he was going for rank 14?
---
I played horde pally BC-panda. Rolling alliance so i can play pally again in classic and fully intend to heal. Going to level ret and then prot for questing and dungeons
---
True, but on Classic it 99% will, just as in 2006.
---
3H a day is sufficient, it would be a different matter if your goal was reaching R14 or such.
---
It was fixed 1.4 i believe, patch after bwl release
---
We want to stagnate with the content once Naxx runs are being sold like candy, we want a 15 year old game to stay the same, forever.
---
Blizzard is a smart company, you can't expect them not to capitalize on releasing dated content if they see classic booming.
---
Oh damn man I feel your pain :(
---
If you try and speed level classic you have missed the point.  Anyone who did not play classic are in for a shock the environment fights back.  That's before we even talk chicken quests.
---
In classic you get a grtz from guild for each level dinged not like now when you get a what ever for hitting 120.
---
Play the game at own pace and explore it was never about leveling as quickly as possible.
---
That would be the ultimate MMORPG
---
2 second Google says 14.28% if [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/95abc8/list_of_spellcoefficients_1121/) is correct.
---
Don't try to follow the best players (rush leveling)  because they have been playing WoW Vanilla for more than a decade on private server. Leveling is a huge part of the game, don't spoil it.
---
Read as little as you can here, discover the game in game.

Don't be afraid of starting a new character. The class you choose is not set in stone and the knowledge you acquired will always be useful.

I remember when I was young, my older brother and I would sit at the computer, and in our mean time from playing WoW we would watch YouTube videos of stuff like this and a lot, like a lot of oxhorn, my favourite video was the 12 days of Christmas one of his.
---
Yeah you'll be fine - keep in mind every single raid fight is figured out, so there is no need for you to have to endure dozens of hours of wiping while learning a fight - will be some learning since you plan on tanking but as long as you're chasing bis and on top of your class you will be fine :)
---
My wife can't be pregnant... It's the first time I felt joy about it, let's go boyyyyyyys !

Why the hate, just don't watch them. List better for your blood pressure...
---
I’m not sure prot is great for leveling considering the sitting for crits is out. The best thing about that was sitting two times between your auto attack to get reckoning stacks, now you’ll have to wait for actual crits and won’t be as powerful
---
Try hardcore. Without death penalty there is no investment in what's happening from moment to moment, but when each mob pack could be hundreds of hours down the drain, you care DEEPLY, and it's huge fun as a result. Fair warning, you won't be able to go back to softcore.
---
Hunters are good early, but scale bad in classic. 
---
Hunters are mainly used for tranq shot and nightfall wielding. So even if you're not the top dps, you still have your uses.
---
Dude nice funny content, I like it!
---
I'm so glad I'm jobless.
---
Doubt your back was injured from carrying - never was hard to spam holy light.
---
I like where this is going.
---
Nope - new names.
---
From what I have herd they have, but there are no official figure to be sure.
---
Or druid. Sometimes you can't bear tank them out, but doing this:
---
\- wrath
---
\- root mob
---
\- wait 20 seconds and let roots tick out.
---
\- repeat
---
kills any elite in a couple of minutes, even the big ones like the rare giant in Burning Steppes. When you run OOM simply innervate or pop 1 potion.
---
No engineering items scale from spell damage mate. Neither does the 6 demon bag etc. engineering pets like the chicken dragon etc do however scale over lvl 60 if you’re a gnome because of your 315 skill.
---
You're not familiar with Classic either. Emoji Emoji

---
They just aren't as good as mage warrior rogue lock later on.
---
Play what you find enjoyable, do you want to cast or shoot arrows?
---
Whoa, no need to be so hostile.
---
Much of the appeal of vanilla is a result of the fact that all the content stays more or less relevant throughout the whole lifetime of it!
---
There's no such thing as "higher itemelevls everywhere across the board each patch".
---
I did MC the first time 7 months after launch. I still did MC with a newly made character 2 years after launch.
---
The reason for all the raid-content staying relevant is that there are no easy-catch-up-mechanics in Vanilla. So if you want to go to higher-raids like AQ40 and Naxx, you have to do other raids before to get the necessary gear.
---
Sure you'll get some gearing-up alternatives along the way: T0.5, ZG and AQ20. But none of these make MC irrelevant. Especially considering that ZG and AQ20 are arguably more difficult to clear than MC and most of the gear dropping there is just really good blues (way better than any 5-man-instance-blues), not epics.
---
So it all depends on what you mean by staying relevant. If you want to be part of the "elite" of your server, who are way ahead of the average, then you have to immitate their playstyle. But if you just want to enjoy the game and eventually see most of its content, then playing it at your own pace is absolutely sufficient.
---
No ofc you don't need to speed level. I was 14 when classic came out and now I have a job, a 2 year old and a house, Ill be lucky to see 60 in the first month lol. I will enjoy my time levelling no matter how long it takes me!
---
Hunter traps &amp; aggressive pets, but for that fresh launch when Druids get moonfire early it’s RIP for everyone else
---
This was pretty easy tbh. 9/10 was easy questions and then the one with the spell you learn the earliest would be under extremely hard questions.
---
I'm all for this add-on. Adds another personal gameplay element and way you play the game. It's like a bounty addon. Pretty cool!
---
Thorium grenades deal fire damage but do not scale either.
---
700-1k mana drained isn't nothing.
---
Never ran a hunter but I thought they fine in raids. Equally well geared mage hunters should be comparable in damage in mc with mages pulling ahead after. 
---
This is from the perspective of a fairly casual raider.
---
thats a yikes my dude. WeirdChamp
---
Googled a bit and some post-vanilla [comments](https://classicdb.ch/?item=16040#comments) suggest a .75-1.0 coefficient. It could have been changed after vanilla but that seems unlikely.
---
Big moves. You’ve done really well then friend, nice one!
---
thanks for letting me know! You're actually the first person to pass, from people who have told me their score, no one has got above 7 yet, so good on you! :)

I'll try do better at scaling the questions on difficulty next video, but the feedback helps!

i have tanking for the last 14 years.. i go by 1 rule  
---
Always blame the healer
---
I love twitch.   But I will probably gquit any guild that starts saying “POGGERS! Monkas LULW... etc etc”
---
Then typically what is the answer?
---
Yeah idk /u/poko318's life, but if you're working 8-10 hours a day, helping around the house, spending time with your family, you don't have time for 3 hours a night, you're a bum if you do.
---
Easy math: We start with 24 hours, take 16 of those away for work and sleep and we're at 8 hours left.  I've never seen a well functioning family take less than an hour to eat together, we're down to 7.  Keeping a clean home is a chore, spending 1-2 hours cleaning a day isn't rare for a good partner.  We're already down to 5.  Just spending that hour for dining isn't family time unless you're a shit parent, so we should really be down to 3 hours left already.  If you're negelecting your wife and not spending time with her to use those last 3 hours to game by yourself as your wife puts the kids to bed, or leave her to do her own thing, etc etc - unless that's specifically what she wants, you're neglecting family life spending 3 hours a day on video games as a grown man with a family.
---
Paladins still have Blessing of Light though which works similar to +healing gear
---
Keep em coming 👍😀
---
This!  This this this!!!  is why i need engineering in my life as a hunter from now on.
---
Well, of course there will be guilds who don't care if your build is basically useless. But you have to live with the knowledge that you aren't as usefull as you could be.
---
You can clear all content but it is a bit like raiding without wearing gloves. You are missing around 3% crit (which is a lot). You are less flexible when it comes to gearing.
---
If you at all like trying to improve in terms of DPS or compete with your mates, you might end up regretting not going Orc.
---
If you just don’t like the look on your screen (and this is not a role playing issue), then you can probably change models and even play as a blood elf if you like.
---
Ah nice, something new to me! Thx mate 🙃i‘m not that familiar with engineering as i only played on retail vanilla, and not on minmax pservers
---
Search for the fastest 2H axe on classicdb and grind skill with that ;-)
---
Without listing achievements, as someone who have played hardcore pve and pvp. Being casual to me has nothing to do with playtime. Sure you can be casual in a way where you play 3hrs a week. But to me, it is more about freedom to do what you want, instead of being obligated to log on to farm AP or mats for pot for raids, or having to cancel IRL events to show up for a raid.
---
Bot with engineering, seemed to me something was mixed up with a retail spell, silly me 🙈
---
Standing on a trap was normal for me in Battlegrounds, but farming/lvling i usually didn't.
---
Oh well i'll be playing with a friend who's clan is gonna play on pve, so i guess i'll be safe...
---
I know this is a real vanilla account by the savory deviate delights, the most your bags filled with group fort candles and nearly half your inventory being taking up by resist gear. 
---
And the 30 gold total. Super OG.

Not to mention quality time with the wife and not running to my computer every night once the kids are in bed haha

There is no exp for playing bgs, so you just avoid gaining exp outside of it

---
Absolutely
---
Can’t wait to enter the Sexy Mograine?
---
wrong....
---
Engineering pets scale based on engineering and gain 1 level every 5 engineering skills, furthermore please take a look at ancient comments and recordings they also prove you wrong in regards to the trinket and engineering items...
---
there are quite a few mentions of it and from a lvl 48 priest who used it while he had 74+ spell power, to level 60s using it in pvp there are comments and recordings from classics original timeline... the item first lost its scaling in patch 2.2.0 oh and btw there are recordings from 2.1.0 that confirm it scaled before then too..
---

"Six Demon Bag: The damage spells cast by this item no longer benefit from a player’s bonus spell damage effects. " 
---
please do not start spouting nonsense as if you know things... it only serves to confuse others...
---
I like the levelling build where I use Owl up to level 25-26 as BM then respec into MM for Aimed Shot and get a Lightning Serpent.
---
The Lightning Breath as Ranged is great to start getting threat as you’re focusing your aimed shot. But again, this is for single targets.
---
Screech better for dungeons and farming.
---
Bite better for Raids.
---
Lightning Breath for single targets w/ aimed shot also PVP is good because it’s elemental dog.
---
Claw with broken tooth for pvp.
---
Also people talk about focus dump as if your pet gets to 100 focus all the time. It doesn’t really. Maybe if you get 2 points into bestial discipline for an extra 20% focus regen, you would get more value in a longer fight.
---
My mom bought me the game to make friends and be social etc. She had me pick herbalism as one profession, then she bought flowers from me at ridicilously low price, only to benefit her potion mafia or some shit. Man those were the days.
---
Thats on level 63 mobs. How many of them are there?
---
Lol. It's really debatable with all the ability pruning there are some really really easy specs in Retail. Most classes have 3 buttons with a few you hit every now and again.
---
I wasn't talking specifically about Classic, I just said at one point. Shit like Not Clipping Autoshots, or Snapshotting was scrubbed out because Blizzard felt the need to lessen the Gap between the good players and the bad players, while filling the remaining gap with easily obtainable raid like items.
---
Even a player in Worse gear can out perform someone in better gear, Gear doesn't make players good, and I wish blizzard realized that long ago.
---
The heros we need but not the ones we deserve
---
I will try to get 60 in any time I need. My life doesn‘t allow hardcore gaming sessions anymore. So i will ding 60 in 2020 in guess. From this point on I will just try to get into some dungeons and maybe some raids/pvp
---
Meanwhile Horde is a bunch of zoomers who haven't done anything in the Beta.
---
Speaking from a general perspective - race for tanking does not matter, pick whichever animation/lore/fantasy you like best. 
---
As a former main tank and raid leader for a guild that cleared all available raid content in 2 days (AQ40/BWL/MC/ZG/AQ20 - albeit on a private server), I definitely saw non-tauren tanks as sub-optimal. The 5% total hp increase gives you much more flexibility with gear. Both when speaking about being undergeared when starting out, and when having to have DPS-boosting items to increase your threat gain later on. Moreover, the extra 10 nature resist you get means you can slack that tiny bit on getting your nature resistance gear for AQ. Warstomp is great in dungeons for when you want another interrupt, and in some rare cases can help buy your healer some time to finish off their big heal cast (don't use it when having loads of mobs on you though, you'd almost never get the cast off in time, and you cant dodge/block/parry when casting).
---
 That being said, I never rejected an applicant for being the "wrong" race, I did however ask them if they misclicked it when creating their character.
---
Lets be honest BWL had the best looking armour for most classes.
---
2-4 hunters are very useful for aura, wolf howl, and tranq shot. They can also do decent DPS, just not top.
---
Now I can level my fishing while on the shitter at work!

Good god, our future generations are fuckt up.
---
It's what I did too yes. Staying feral means you kill elites faster, but requires skill and reacting on the spot. Putting on int gear and wrath/wrath/root/wait until 6 seconds left/wrath/wrath root is best. Wrath seems to have less chance to break roots than the moonfire dot.
---
Paladin spamming rank 1 holy light and buffs
---
quite a few comments if looking at allakhazam using googles wayback feature to view a website from an old save, but what i wish to know is if blizzard chose to keep the scaling or got rid of it :)
---
You can't do class quests in other starting zones?
---
Like a 20 NE leveling in Westfall
---
That's a stripper alt.
---
Nice hat girl, I wants it.
---
FeelsWeirdMan
---
Does it work in BfA? Why would anyone use it in BfA? It does the same as the base game and not even as good
---
Holy light?
---
I wasn’t a preist
---
Time to get me a hat I can't pronounce.
---
As a causal you will probably never have the time you need to play most of the endgame content, though.
---
AV was up maybe once a month on my server before cross-realm BGs. The novelty of games that span over several days is fun at first, but it grows old quickly.
---
Counter point to the autoshot clipping argument:  
---
wow was always meant to be easy and auto shot clipping was an oversight  
---
melee classes did most of their damage simply via autoattacks because blizzard didn't want bad players to be too far behind  
---
same thing for snapsotting, even tho ferals still have it
---
How could you not brush your teeth? Wow hasn't been that addicting for years.
---
Long live Robert Moran
---
According to nost threads it does scale with spell power.  So do some other obscure items like Skullflame Shield, Shard of the Binding Star, Strat Holy Water and others.
---
Honestly I was more concerned with which spell to use than which rank.  #Priest4life
---
They should know, not to mess with the best.
---
Part of beta is grouping with people and doing things that require more than one person tho
---
PSA: this works amazingly with the Defias Traitor escort quest.
---
&gt;I think the respec cost of 50 g really ruins The idea of some classes being a jack of all trades.
---
I disagree because unlike in retail you have the spells from other specs too. A resto druid still has bear and cat abilities
---
Vanilla wow pvp music - decent playlist on spotify, around 160 songs
---
I see thank you for the head up !
---
Thanks. I'm glad.
---
Cool thing about Vanilla, you can pwn ass without raiding
---
For sure, in vanilla it was the standard system, we used it too all the way through Naxx and Sunwell in TBC. These days it's a different story, in my opinion. LC is just the better system, in my opinion.
---
Paladin but okay.
---
Nope. Still don't think it will be horrible 24/7.
---
The sky won't fall and leveling won't be crippled for the masses. You'll see an uptick but once the first week goes by and folks see how little movement they've made in PvP most will quit and wait for BGs.
---
It won't be hell on Earth like you and others are making it out to be. Sorry dude. That's not in the cards.
---
Looks good! Testing it on a pserver I did get the following error message: "Interface\\Addons\\Weaponswingtimer\_Utils.lua:1: unexpected symbol near \`...'  
---
Did I do something wrong in the process of installing it?
---
What do you mean "now"
---
Also good for shamans and their earthbound kiting
---
I was going to play but streamers killed the nostalgia for me. I know it would be addicting to play but I just don't feel like getting into a game that I already spent years on. Plus I have a baby due around then.
---
Are you talking about raiding? Damage meters dont make or break the class for the most part. You need not worry about the number of slots in a raid, your feelings and happiness playing what you want is more important. Further more, Hunters are strong as hell in PvP with a diverse toolkit that allows you to get better and better with practice.
---
Yeah, gonna need to be tested but no one can make Arcane Bombs on the beta yet, and even if they could you would have to find the one person (with SP gear) who's willing to spend an arcanite bar on the thing.

**&lt;BANISH&gt; [A] EU PVP English**
---
**&gt;Schedule&lt;**
---
Raid Times: Tue/Thu/Sun 19:00-23:00 (CET) + Wed on BWL/AQ/Naxx releaseday.
---
**&gt;About Us&lt;**
---
Banish is one of the oldest and longest running private server vanilla raiding guilds – It was founded in 2015 on Nostalrius and is still active on horde Lightbringer now. Over the last four years we have accumulated an active community of the most dedicated and experiences players the vanilla wow scene has to offer. We pride ourselves for our warm atmosphere where people enjoy logging on for more than just killing bosses.
---
**&gt;Experience and Achievements&lt;**
---
With over 59 recorded Kel’Thuzad kills we are arguably the most experienced vanilla guild out there. We are:
---
Clearing MC since September 2015
---
Clearing BWL since January 2016
---
Killing world bosses weekly since March 2017
---
Clearing AQ since June 2017
---
Clearing Naxx since January 2018
---
**&gt;Goals/Expectations&lt;**
---
On release we expect most people to get raid-ready in a timely manner, but acknowledge the social commitments of our members who are unable to do so. From phase three (BWL) onward we will aim for first week, if not first day clears (we will add a Wednesday raid on content releases). After progression we will reclear weekly and cut down on raidtime where possible.
---
To achieve our goals we expect everyone to: - be dedicated and motivated, during and after progression - have full knowledge of raid mechanics and intricacies before entering - bring full consumables, no matter what - have a mature and respectful attitude
---

Just relax, and stop carrying. I'm sure you'll find a better party, don't ever give your all in fights, just measure up the willingness and skill of your party, and match them. Don't put more effort into the dungeon/raid than what the rest of the party does, and you won't carry and be burdened by them.  
---
Sure, that means you'll get more wipes, and sometimes you won't progress, but that's just part of the game, and when you find competent people to play with, add them to your friendlist, keep in touch with them, and you will surely have fun without breaking your back further by carrying everyone around.  
---
It's a game, and people play games to relax and have fun. If you're not having fun, then that's no good...
---
Becoming a main-tank for a 40-man-raid does indeed require above-average dedication.
---
Simply because your guild needs to be able to rely on you. All the tanking gear that drops in raids is usually funnelled to the maintank first, as that person makes a huge difference in how difficult the whole endeavour is.
---
So it would really suck if that guy is being unreliable at raid-times, whereas everyone else is usually much easier to replace and it doesn't matter much what gear they have.
---
In terms of required dedication:
---
Tank &gt; DPS &gt; Heal
---
You can of course tank your heart out at 5 mans as this is extremely thought after.
---
1 in 5 of each 5 man needs to be a tank.
---
1 in 40 of each 40 man raid needs to be a main-tank.
---
However, you'll very likely be accepted as off-tank in a raid, where you can tank adds and trash-mobs. Usually most encounters require at least one of those anyways.
---
From what I've seen not talented but more invested
---
Lol you’re crazy if u think they wont have a lot of them
---
WutFace
---
One of you will have to run to the other, but dwarf/ human is the easiest run. Just get to your main city and take the deeprun tram to the other city. Run to your partner's start zone from there.
---
I made a jokey countdown website for you :P www.iswowclassicout.com
---
Fap furiously while watching my pally kill things
---
Yeah troll rogues ganking the undead rogue
---
5 weapon skills give you 0.2-0.6% "hit", depending on if you're behind or not and on if you target can parry, and 0.2% crit. I'm not counting block since most opponents won't have shield. Barley significant.
---
An agressive pet is not faster, still needs to travel. I dont know about traps but even then you would need to know the exact spot where the mob spawns while i as a druid are just spamming TAB+Moonfire keybind.
---
Server transfer sounds OK. Rest, obviously not
---
LUL
---
I don't mind either, I played hunter up until Cata and then mained my lock up to a couple of months back.
---
imp VW is strong, and demonic embrace is VERY good for pvp servers. Going beyond that is getting into questionable territory though.
---
We are The Remains, a semi-hardcore guild with experience in several MMORPG's. Looking to return to one of the first MMORPGs we played. TL:DR We are looking for progress, but that essential community feeling is just as important. Playing Horde on EU PVP server
---
What are the goals of The Remains?
---
Primary goal : Enjoy all content on a high level
---
We will accomplish that goal, by these sub-goals :
---
Enjoying all aspects of the game
---
Become a friendly environment for our WoW members
---
Focus groups on different aspects of the game
---
Being part of a focus group, doesn't exclude you from other guild content or switching groups
---
Have a good reputation on the server because of who we are and what we stand for
---
What can we offer you?
---
A nice and friendly environment to call your home
---
A teamspeak server to communicate with eachother
---
A discord server for discussing WoW or anything else you'd like
---
Site and forum to stay in contact outside of the game
---
Raiding times will be Tuesday and Thursday from 19:30 till 22:30 (CE(S)T) and possibly Sunday from 20:00 till 23:00. Other evenings we will organise things as well, which will be discussed at a later date
---
EPGP guild loot system
---
What do we want from you?
---
Friendly and mature behaviour towards the guild and others
---
For hardcore players your commitment
---
For casual players your warmth and kindness
---
What are the pillars of The Remains?
---
Being a close community
---
Work together to accomplish common goals
---
No mass recruiting, we recruit people with the same goals and attitude, not to become a zerg guild
---
Respect, to eachother, to others and from others to us
---
Contact me on discord Boci#3724 or on reddit if you are interested.
---

their cap was increased to 40 thus crafting them is a matter of time until recipe drops and since its PTR gold aint really a concern. :)
---
Why is everyone assuming it means an hour from a fresh character. It just means an hour of play time, at any level.
---
If it stops me smoking the devil's lettuce, that's an easy choice.
---
This manlet plays with magic cards lmao
---
Why are people bringing that up again and again? There is a very clear distinction: The mount system change was necessary for TBC and would have been in the 2.0 prepatch - but it was allready finished and the devs saw no reason to not include it right away.
---
I'll be raiding a 2/3 nights a week but I'll also be doing BG as well.
---
You notice his backpack has 20 slots? How was anything shifted around to those bottom slots since it was only 16 slots on your main bag in vanilla?
---
You’re wrong it’s Priest since they are basically all holy and reside in a church just like the catholic priests.
---
Id say go priest man
---
Interested! Probably going to play a priest (happy to play whatever spec or be the token SPriest) but I’m most comfortable healing. (Have vanilla-cata experience).
---
The definition of a clicker
---
Low effort, go back to playing league of legends.
---
They're not really bad per se, but they're average compared to the main DPS-powerhouse classes. Just to give you some numbers off the top of my head when I was raid leading in MC/BWL - my best warriors/rogues did around \~700 DPS on average throughout the whole of BWL, the best hunters did 300. (that being said we weren't the top guild on the server, but we still demanded consumables and world buffs on every raid). Hunters don't shine until Naxx in that department. In addition, what really sucks is that the rotation (at least to me) feels engaging, but incredibly unrewarding since you need to time your auto-shots inbetween Aimed/Multi shots, but the damage put out compared with the effort and attention needed doesn't nearly compare to what a warrior can do by spamming Bloodthirst/Whirlwind on cooldown and making sure they dont pull threat with Heroic Strike/Cleave. 
---
 As a hunter though, you have a guaranteed spot in every raid due to Tranquilizing Shot (as long as your guild doesn't have more than 3-4 active hunters that is...). You'll also provide melees with some utility, so your lower DPS won't really be a detriment to the raid either (in the form of Trueshot Aura and Howl from a wolf pet, both increasing attack power of the party). Zul'Gurub/AhnQiraj 20 and some trash in every major raid is made easier by having a hunter pull/kite/slow them. Another good point for hunters is that they're pretty self-sufficient outside of raids, and great in PvP as well - both in the world and in BGs. Leveling would be much faster compared to everyone else that's going solo as well.
---
Actually a lot of guilds did it at the very start of vanilla on bosses like Barron Geddon where a living bomb could easily kill an undergeared cloth dps or crit and kill a good geared player. But it got removed early on during vanilla.
---
"Hey everybody, lets play a game of 'find the spirit-healer' !"
---
*horde warriors cheer*
---
Mind Control is probably my favorite ability. It has some cool PvE stuff you can do with specific mobs to give buffs or teach people recipes, but fuck that shit.
---
I just shadowmeld and wait to make some poor sap jump off Thousand Needles elevator. Or into lava. Or off a boat/zepp after it takes off.
---
Rise Against, and Seether
---
The "ultimate MMORPG" wouldnt display names at all.
---
This ain't going to work if the company use teamviewer like our, at some point they detect you are using it for commercial too and you have to pay. I had to switch to AnyDesk because of this. Tried with chrome remote, but it too laggy and still too much bugs occurs especially when using a 2nd monitor.
---
Anyone have a clip of this?
---
As a far too ''pre'' invested vanilla veteran, who's planning for classic way too much.
---
I gotta go through a TLDR version for why i took Orc Hunter.
---
Basically i don't expect many raids, as a real life hardcore (2 kids, 8-16 job, studies and I'm still married.) I'll have popup quests which cannot be put on hold. These mix very badly with raiding. So i expect most of my gameplay experience to be in the following: 
---
Lvling
---
Battlegrounds
---
Dungeons
---
Farming/Raiding
---
In that order.
---
Orc(stun resist op) Hunter is my choice because it was my first lvl 60. And because it's a decent solo experience both in PvP and lvling. Going for Engineering to make up for the deadzone (oh you're gonna hate the deadzone), and looking forward to the ''minigame'' of my pets. (Google it, it's pretty complex in vanilla.)
---
Basically, i see so much casual content which i'll enjoy with a hunter. While also getting my hardcore pvp fill.
---
Protip: At lvl 51, go to alterac valley entrance in the north of tarren mill and get the ''Bloodseeker crossbow'' from a victory in Alterac valley battleground. It will basically be your ''best in slot'' in pre-raiding gear.
---
The main issue with hunters in raids is their low mana-pool. You either have to just auto-attack for a long time or feign-death+drink in order to keep up some sort of high-damage-rotation for an extended amount of time.
---
However, due to how the whole loot-mechanics work it makes sense to fill even the slots for classes that are theorethically sub-ideal.
---
As a raid-leader you won't want to have to gear up 10 mages while having to disenchant the hunter-gear. A hunter with gear is better than a mage with none afterall.
---
That dont hinder leveling at all? None
---
Lemme just leave a quick comment here because this will happen some day
---
all serious RPers use an add-on like TRP3 to make a profile with their RP backstory. there is a field to enter in a first name and last name.
---
Lots of chinese on northdale.  You kill them and watch their corpse glide for 3-4 seconds. 
---
I guess theres quite the latency difference.  Wouldnt recomend.
---
Warrior has fear, can harmstring kite and has big 30 min cds to kill harder enemies. Also on lvl 30 you get sweeping strikes which makes it easy to kill 2-3 mobs at once especially from 36 on with WW. Another trick is to use bloodrage+Bandage after a fight to get and keep rage (endless rage talent!). Combine all that with some spirit gear and leveling becomes very easy and efficient.
---
Don't encourage them please.
---
CHAPEU, tu est not parlair francais?
---
Karma and Effect, and Finding Beauty in Negative Spaces were my shit dude.
---
Just got my original account back aswell! Been inatctive since 2008. Felt really good (and addictive) to put those old pvp daggers on. Cant wait to lose my life again😅
---
You get right back Into aq40, your guildies been waiting for you!
---
ask an Australian and 400ping is no problems, easily playable. 
---
ask an American if 400ping is playable they will say that the game is unplayable over 70ping and anything over that and the lag is just SPIRALING OUT OF CONTROL.
---
Same!
---
I wasn’t aware of that exploit until recently but I’m sure I could still pull bigger groups and burn them down with cons
---
This guy gets it. If you calculate Health per Mana for Flash of Light for example you can see that higher ranks have better h/m ratio. But with +Healing gear lower ranks improve on that ratio more than higher ranks.  
---
I actually have graphs how h/m ratio changes but I used full +Healing bonus. Where could I find exact numbers how much bonus certain spells get? And does spell power affect healing spells also?
---
Your comment is low effort and generic
---
wow.gamepedia.com/Eastern_Kingdoms
---
The thing is though that classic content is easy compared to retail stuff. Min/maxing isn't as important. You can clear MC with level only a few 60s and the rest in their 50s. You can raid with druids and paladins as long as you dont suck.
---
And my axe!
---
But I’m not even trying to be funny my back is literally fucked up and you think it’s funny??
---
There's a reason the Ashbringer makes everyone friendly.
---
I have a life now sadly, so nothing outrageous :(
---
Just started replaying Arcanum and completely forgot it was like that there. You never know if you meet someone important, though the environment always kind of tells the story itself - like by a forge you find a (surprise) blacksmith but only when you speak to him you find out who he is, his name and that he is a pretty damn GOOD blacksmith. Adds that tiny bit of unknown to explore even though they may not be important in the grand scheme of things.
---
Yes, don't you? I mean, there's humor in most things, sometimes you just gotta step back and look at it from a different perspective
---
As a former raid-leader and main tank, wholeheartedly agree with post. I raided two to three times a week, depending on the content, and in between the days I was not raiding, I was farming for consumables. I was there every single raid for about two years, and the one time I had to miss a raid (had a flight to catch), the whole raid got canceled.
---
It's a huge responsibility and a burden. Don't get me wrong, it's rewarding, but at the time I was a university student with 1-2 lectures per week that I could view online. That meant I was online upwards of 8-12 hours a day on average. If you don't have that kind of time, being a main tank is not for you. Regular tanking though, is completely fine. This is the main reason I'm not going to be a main tank again for classic. Just don't have the time anymore.
---
Haha :D Perfect Counter :P
---
Also it won't double your time... It would be pretty slow if someone would take literally 5 days of /played in order to push their Engineering a Little bit further while leveling xD
---
A lot of people are just bad. I have #1 parses on world of logs and Warcraft logs playing a suboptimal race. Nobody is going to deny you because of your race. At the same time, don’t go some stupid spec, that’s actually does make a difference.
---
Hmm... i only have experience from Horde, but i do believe you can do the class quests as long as there is a class trainer of that race. 
---
I'll be trying it when classic comes out, but i do believe as a orc you'll be able to get the tame pet quest from the taurens. (of course not from the forsaken as they don't have hunters)
---
Doesn't look good in their quarterly reports if they don't get a sales cash injection on launch.

Have you looked into dietary interventions?
---
Back-pain often is caused by inhibited blood-flow within the invertebral discs due to arteriosclerosis, which also is a risk-factor for many other diseases such as heart-attacks, strokes and impotence.
---
There's a lot that can be done about this with diet. Check out the documentary "Forks over knives" for example.

Not the exact clip he referenced, but a worthy compilation of the ones that were streamed.

Playable, good says to USW I could get sub 100 ping. Look into a service like Battleping.

This was the one i was talking about, its perfect. Summit didn't even know. Amazing they just came out of nowhere, killed him and then spammed ooga gang and stealthed out right away. 10/10

Its happened a few more times but i think this was the best one
---
As a hunter who plays in the Beta the hunter seems to be the most bugged class. I’m a hunter 100% but after trying the beta and seeing how fucked pet control is along with a few other things, I’m seriously considering dropping the class altogether.
---
Don't say where you're going, maintain a huge ass delay, and you could probably pull it off.
---
Chapeau
---
Im not taking any days of in the first week. I used to tske a couple days of when Blizzard games launches. But after the launch of D3 i stopped doing it. I gor a few days of in the early september.
---
The first character I ever played took 18 real time days. As in 430+ hours. Now it takes me about 120 hours. I would say about 200 for a first timer following a guide.

They know the community will do it for them. It already has.

Whitemane is probably the most sexualised character of all wow characters
---
&gt; I'm telling you how it works. Part of playing a rogue well is pooling and managing energy.
---
The funny thing is that kicking and gauging are so basic that he is basically playing the class as bad as possibly imaginable. Thats far from thinking about pooling.
---
BWL was patch 1.6 though.
---

---
I don’t think I would worry to much.  Healers are going to be in high demand end game.  Priests are the best all around healer but pallys and Druid’s are still very much needed.
---
Druid’s for example are the only ones that can innervate / combat Rez / decurse (besides mages that never do) etc.  You always need a few pallys doe blessings and they are amazing at rank healing.
---
I mained a Druid all though classic and it was great short of the fact I could only Rez every 30mins so 5 man content was sometimes a bit interesting.
---
At 60’warlocks and Druid’s are always the least played classes.
---
Exactly! Though since I'll be a gnome, and gnomes are the only race that can have a death ray between levels 20 and 35, i'll be maxing it out asap just so that when I'm inevitably ganked by a somewhat similar leveled horde, i'll be able to surprise him lol

I played demo lock on vanilla. Great survivability and found it to be fun. Optimal dps.. No but if I am alive longer then better sustained dps.
---
Didn't do much raiding but did some mc, coped well with it.  Loved UBRS with the spec.

People also pay others to watch them sing, basicly the same thing
---
Hehe, i think it's the mentality of anyone who's watched the numbers.
---
If you're skilled, you'll beat a less skilled player 9/10 times. 
---
In PvP, factors comes in, do you have a healer, do you fight 1v2?
---
But in those close engagements, with 1v1, with both being badasses, people know what that small % can do, and how big it actually is. 
---
There is a reason there is ''Best in slot'' gear. People have done the numbers and seen how ''1% crt is better than 3 agi''. While this is minor when you have 500 agi and 23 crt% shit still stacks up. Or how much +%hit you need to be a proper tank or pvper as a warrior.
---
Like, people loses their minds over items as mentioned that gives 7+skill, which shows how important the +5 sword for humans are. And then deeper in the meta, which weapon is the better tanking weapon. Then Humans are the best tanks, because the best tanking weapons are swords. (Which again, makes an undead more equal to an orc. if you ever get your hands on those.)
---
Back in the day they used to say they couldn’t guarantee shit (character data) to be stored longer than 6 months, even though even then you usually could restore stuff after 6 months. I can imagine these days they just leave everything regardless of time passed. Would probably cost more to manage that than the data does.

Great idea, but an addon talking to addons on the other faction probably won't work.

I prefer this version with the male dwarf skeleton rather than the Jersey Shore stereotypes we have in retail, but everybody has their tastes.

Dont really understand why everyone wanna just speedlevel own class after release, just create a char y wanna play, enjoy this world again, questlines, people around, helping each other and stuff like that... Thats what i gonna do
---
It's a misconception that they're "kids". Twitch has a wide age range. My whole group of friends watch twitch and we range from 29 to 45.
---
Also I wouldn't say they're "sheep" if they don't know what a Pog is. They know what the term "Pog" means in regards to the internet.
---
Whether you speedlevel or not you probably won't find any challenging content until AQ40 which is years away.

Both \o/
---
Gross how do people enjoy that?
---
True. Same as people who base opinion on others due to spec / race / class this person plays or people who treat others as numbers. I prefer slower progression without elitist jerks but where you can be bound with guild by friendship, share some special moments and have fun playing together.
---
Why am I not surprised that a guy named "CrookedHillaryShill" is acting like this?
---
In classic you don't compare your dps overall, you compare it to others playing the same class.
---
Lots of players - yeah I doubt that :D
---
Cannibalize. Especially as a warrior or rogue.
---
If you are making a joke about eleveling slowly... priests are one of the fastest levelers. Only behind hunters, druids and maybe locks but i highly doubt it. They are both slow what mpvement is concerned and lock has very little downtime while priest should have none
---
This! Thanks for the in depth response. I was at work and rushed my earlier comment. I meant that I was afraid I'd miss out on the black AQ battle tank. But maybe that's the mount that the 1 person gets? Idk. Makes me sad that only 1 person will get the mount, and it certainly couldnt be me, but I've always liked the idea of unique items/ mounts.
---
I can't express how much mana issues spriests have. I can only comment being pre Naxx BIS while damage is initially high, you simply can't sustain your full rotation for a whole boss fight before you're out of mana. It's tough.
---
Yes, profession bags still work fine in BFA / Legion.
---
the joke was that most people already know what they want to play while I'm stuck at "choose class"
---
Don't know why you are getting downvoted. Seems people want to stick to their narrative of lock being hardcountered by those classes. From several 60 locks on pservers and my main in vanilla back then, I'd totally agree with you. SL with voidwalker makes beating this classes a walk in the park.
---
I suggest to you wait 2 days, Most hype will die down and ppl will quit.
---
Yaa i'm sorry I was at work and rushed my response. I meant to say I was scared I'd miss out on the black AQ battle tank mount.
---
Its almost as if people who care about min/maxing don't really give a shit about their races animations.
---
That’s hilarious! Seems like this is gonna be a Classic thing only
---
It's that voice of hers, seriously.
---
Well please continue, I always love doing these quizzes and it's nice to see that you've found questions that hasn't been asked before in other classic quizzes
---
Yes i'm sorry, my comment was rushed because I was at work. It was the black battle tank mount that I am afraid of missing out on. I think that's the mount. I've always wanted one!
---
Because you misremembered wotlk that equates to me being a BFA player? Amazing logic, please elaborate whilst I go get some popcorn
---
But if 10 more people could die and boss would be down anyway, is it still carrying?
---
Chat would be more unreadable if everyone was trying to debate things or spark conversation. The twitch emotes are a great way to gauge the overall reaction of people because it's a single image thats conveying a set of emotions. You gotta know what the emotes mean, but once you do it makes sense. And it's not just random shit either, unless it's a twitch noob. It's like a flock of birds in a way and then there's that one bird that went the wrong way. "Where's that guy going?"
---
*Zooms in closely on his phase.
---
I’m something of a goblin myself.
---
Keep in mind many shadowpriests don't get any gear from raids because they are not seen as dps classes. So it's no wonder people think they do shit dps. If you are dedicated enough and have 100% attendance you should be getting gear which means you'll outdps many classes. You won't be top dps of course, but neither will a warlock/hunter/rogue. Top dps are usually warrior/mage in later content.
---
At what point in any of my posts do you see me saying wotlk was heavily time gated lol? All I said was as time went on it became more prevalent the games #'s declined. I bet you have a ton of friends with that attitude.

Strength of Earth/Air. Shaman totem twists between air and WF.
---
Be priest, have a priest friend, duo every humanoid based dungeon by double MC.
---
This isn’t even a min/max problem. Shadowpriest DPS sustain is awful. You’ll spend hours farming dark tunes and filling your bags with mana pots just to be able to have the same kind of sustained dps a Mage or Warlock could put out. 
---
There’s a reason why it’s not a raiding spec, and it has nothing to do with min/maxing.
---

---
Horde my friend
---
There are like 2-3 major dps/gear checks? And how many encounters overall?
---
No, cross-realm battlegrounds were quite literally *the* selling point of 1.12.
---
I'd argue Sylvanas and possible Whitemane
---
sauce?
---
They are just really hard. Any joker can play a paladin/shaman and just spam one spell and top the meters. 
---
Priests are harder but potentially more rewarding. Druids are way harder but they have an extremely high throughput and can save the raid from many mechanics. A big problem is that they can't share HoTs on the same target. So they limit themselves if there are too many in the raid.
---
:’(
---
Howdy,
---
I played a hunter in Vanilla and ran though every major raid all the way up through the middle of Nax so I feel comfortable speaking about it, though it has been years since I stopped playing. Patchwerk was at the time the best gauge of sustained DPS at the time for raids because it was basically a DPS gear check.  Hunters arn't useless, but they were far from the most ideal DPS class and you have to remember that some of your DPS is tied into your pet and that can put you at a disadvantage. Mages and Rogues would over time to consistently more DPS than hunters all things being equal. If I recall, out of forty raiders, I think we typically ran with 3 hunters?  Don't get me wrong, I had a blast playing a NE hunter. After I got the crossbow from Cromagus I could execute peeps in Alterac Valley with a good aimed shot/multishot. The epic quest for Hunter is also some of the most fun I ever had in WoW. The kiting demon that you had to do with arcane jumpshots was a real test of skill. Hunters just weren't the best at DPS is all. They arn't terrible but they arn't the number one choice.

The only real one you will want further down the line when AQ is out is Burn.
---
Outside of that there's not really any mage specific that you need.
---
Fuckity. We shall meet on the battlefields then.
---
So basically you're saying I can roll a tank and still find a home if I can't put in enough hours to actually become my guilds main tank?
---
That's actually good news and enough for me! Thanks alot!

How can people say that they don't like streamers but at the same time help them make content?
---
But would you use str+air just for the druid tank ? Maybe if hes maintanking, but i would think if you have few offtanks in there, you want air+WF rotation.
---
If a bot from 2004 could teach me how to be a master player while I was sleeping then I wouldn't be on here.
---
Streamers war?
---
The major one is going to be an energy meter. In classic mages can run and drink at the same time as long as they  are sitting when the next Mana regen proc. So the strategy is to fill your bags with water and use the timer to figure out when to run.
---
Yeah I was racking my brain here. In Vanilla I played a mage with something over 100 days played and most of it was pvp. I was also already an adult so my memory is pretty good regarding it.
---
That said, I about drove myself crazy trying to remember mine fields and shredders...
---
A threat meter is a must for all DPS class. One crit on pull and you'll gain aggro instantly. Another must is EZ dismount when entering combat mounted.
---
You'll also want to consider decursive for easy decursing and some form of cool down counter.
---
Havent seen any trumps tweets in a while, have you ?
---
That couch and this setup looks familiar......
---
OK, you have my attention.... Please proceed
---
I'm just using the other guys numbers. I'm not sure what the actual server cap is going to be. 
---
As far as starter zones what he's talking about is everyone in a starter zone. Not each starter zone with a server caps worth of players.
---
This was stolen I'm pretty sure
---
You should be fine if you wait a day or two. It’s not going to die in two days idk why someone says that....but a lot of people are going to be power leveling with guildies or whatever and by the second day you should be able to level pretty smoothly. It won’t be total isolation you’ll have competition for a while. It’s not till after lvl 20ish when it gets more isolated
---
Damn, where'd they get 120 hooves from?
---
The question was, skilled PvPers which server will you roll and your answer has a lot less to do with server choice and more to do with streamer hate, honest question, why do you care so much about what streamers have?
---
Totally agree. If you are occasionally playing that let's everyone else (40) you raid with down. Because you won't be strong enough to push through. The healer mana pool is real. Dodge parry and bv need to be capped for some of the end raids to main tank. Off tank may be able to occasionally play. But you'll again need bv parry capped at least. Depending on druid/warrior tank. Pally healer off tanks are a thing you heal for aggro btw. Another thing to look into. But yea if you don't put 8-12 hours in unless your a big streamer getting everything handed to you it's not likely you'll be able to gear in time. Knowing the fight and execution is the other side. Managing your threat is another.
---
I really never raided more than bwl and mc, I mainly pvped until r12 or so. They are fine. They drop in terms of pve but I had no problem in pvp.
---
They're behind Mages too. They're efficient, but they're still middle of the pack. No mobility and slow time to kill doesnt out weigh the lack of downtime from Spirit Tap.
---
Locks have a similar thing to Priests with not having to worry about mana, but they kill faster and can handle multiple mobs.
---
MoP was my favorite expansion. There are private servers for it if you're interested.
---
If you talk to mages the way you do here on reddit, no wonder nobody want to give you water.
---
Did you miss the "polite" part in the PSA video?

If they are OP farmers, why would they waste time giving people stuff for free if they can make 120g farming bijous instead of giving leeches free stuff?

Lok’tar ogar, you’ll see me the spriest melting faces

He is being crushed all the time. The floating combat text doesn't mark crushing blows with a different font size the same way it does for critical strikes, which may have fooled you. If you take a look at the actual damage, you'll notice when he blocks something (ie doesn't get crushed) the total damage is a bit below 400 (average of 375 across 7 hits, with the blocked portion included), while with other hits, the average is about 562 (across 10 hits). 572/375 comes out to exactly 1.5, which is the crushing blow damage. Dodges/parries/misses are normal since those take precedence over crushes, which is why you aimed for 102.4% avoidance in TBC.
---
The damage itself seems normal as well. The mage took an average of 644 per hit. Ice armor+full T2 gets you some 1200 armor, resulting in 17% DR at 60. Unmitigated damage ~776.
---
Dunno about asmon's gear, but full plate at 40 will get you about 4k armor. If talented, you get 10% extra. There's also motw for about 200 armor. 4400 armor is 43% DR at 60, plus the -10% damage taken in def stance. Unmitigated damage based on the ~375 damage hits is 731, so not particularly far from the mage example.
---
Thanks for linking this, I found it very enlightening. Was definitely considering staying up after the family was asleep but not anymore...
---
Weren't they gimped by the debuff limit before it got raised?
---
Or just play casual instead of trying to be rank 1.

Nice 👌
---
Is there like a “best” private server I could try?
---
They really begin to scale horribly AFTER the other classes get AQ40 gear. Until then they're still doing dps that allows them to hit top 10.
---
Absolutely. Looking at this chart, and assuming Horde have roughly the same numbers, that is like 1k active players on the Beta server.
---
So, there is space for 2k more.
---
Also, the stress tests were not enough for testing layering. Too short of a period of time.
---
The beta servers should have at least 2 layers, if not 3, to test, at different points in time, how layers go from 3 to 2, or from 3 to 1, or from 2 to 3, etc., depending on the peaks.
---
There should be at least 10k more people invited to beta.
---
You'll see a gnome eating his own succubus' ass from a standing position.
---
That fat cheeto doesn't interest me much, so no :p
---
I work 12hr shifts with a weird schedule where I end up working every other weekend, so no serious raiding.  Dungeons, quests and AV will probably be my routine with no urgency to get to max level.  I will most likely stream my mis-adventures.
---
The reason why I won't play a class that has different roles/spec depending on what content they play. Hunter? Same build all day baby.

Lmao, thanks for the laugh
---
Real vanilla experience.
---
Server transfers were a thing a vanilla.
---
It was a good joke!  
---
I mean, the 9% less parry that bosses have compared to classic makes private servers a big joke.
---
Bind S to a spell, take backpedal literally out of your game. 
---
Mouseover macros are honestly huge.
---
Look up early 2000s punk on Spotify
---
I played a druid-healer in Vanilla.
---
The disadvantages are: 0.5 seconds on the cast time of healing touch compared to greater heal, 20% less benefit from sprit-regen compared to priests and no OOC-Ress.
---
However, you also have some advantages to counteract this:
---
The flipside of the lower cast-time is that you have a bonus-healing-coefficient of 100%, which makes downranked healing-touch crazy mana-efficient.
---
Also you bring an Innervate, which on its own is more than enough compensation for having lower spirit-conversion... especially if you use it on a priest.
---
The slower cast-time means that other healers and Paladins in particular have an advantage in the sense that when you are competing to fill up the bars asap, you'll "lose"... but that barely is an issue if your raid is smart and does a healer-coordination, where healers are given the responsibility for certain groups and are not supposed to heal other groups unless they don't have anything to do within their own. This tremendously helps against overhealing and for mana-preservation and even allows to bring much fewer healers than you would when everyone just goes for whatever target is lowest where whoever healed first "wins" and pushes everyone who can't cancel anymore into overheal whereas the second lowest target might die.
---
Someone who wants to heal and is dedicated to learning about how to do it best and not just fast will be great with any healing-capable class.
---
Btw. I ran a 30(feral)-21(resto)-0 build, which meant I didn't have improved Regrowth nor Switmend... but instead an about 1200 bigger Mana-pool and the ability to switch gear and off-tank. I almost never used the Hots anyways since downranked HTs where just so much more mana-efficient.
---
You could server transfer and change your name in vanilla.
---
I read this in the Mad Hatter's voice for some reason.
---
Better yet we can get an addon that just replaces LULW , Kappa, monkaW, widepeepoHappy, etc, with the twitch emote. BTWOW
---
Lol
---
At level 45 you will be able to have SL and instant corruption, so at that point it could be usefull.
---
I have been thinking about trying out demo when leveling, and might give it a try at around lvl 45
---
i dont see paladin judgements being worth while in most of the fights. Especially wisdom. You are going to see 20-60 second bossfights. Im doing wisdom in our private server guild and im supposed to use wisdom in BOSSES at Loatheb, sapphiron &amp; KT.
---
I kind of figured it was a carrying joke so I had to fall into it. I enjoyed it LOL

Not really the specs are ruin based
---
Same. Whittled it down to paladin or druid.
---
Any recommendations for cool down trackers / something that keeps me informed on my CCs
---
Also the escort through the pirates south of ratchet
---
I have a great story about this from my time on pserver, we had a group of 3 waiting to do the shredder escort in the northern barrens, when another group of 3 came along, my group abandoned me, even though we had been there for much longer than the new group. Somehow I still managed to snag the quest first and soloed it all despite their trying to wipe me. Revenge never felt so good.
---
Shamans have so many tools to help close the gap though.
---
My tip would be: play what is fun to you. WoW should never be your second job.
---
Original AV was not the epic battle you make it out to be, most people were just too young to realise how bad and pointless it was. If the first version was implemented, many people just wouldn't bother with it at all.
---
1.12 AV still has many of the elements people purport to be missing. It just requires having a plan and a couple people to work on setting that plan into motion. The side who mindlessly zerg towards the enemy boss will lose 90% if the other side has a little defense and the moment both sides defend a little, the whole game changes to something very worthwhile (with a huge alliance advantage though).
---
Wow I'm getting really mixed responses. From '3h is fine, np roll a tank' to 'if you don't put in 8-12h you can forget about it'.
---
Name change came towards the end of the first year of TBC.
---
Bonnet de douche
---
I figured in most fights against cleansers I would start the fight with full rank dots to see how eager they were to cleanse. If they instantly cleanse everything then switch to rank 1s. If they dont bother or stop cleansing then switch back to full rank
---
3 hours / day is enough...just not for raiding. If you plan to tank raids for a guild, 3hrs/day won't be enough. There will be tanks who can commit more time, and they will get the tank spots. They will play more, forge better friendships, have more gold (so they afford more consumables than you) and they will be considered first for tank positions. Which, at the best, will be 3, for Phase 1 at least.
---
Now, for dungeons, 3 hrs/day is more than enough.
---
Unless the guild is SUPER casual (they don't care about raid progression) and they raid once a week for fun, yeah, you can tank for that guild.
---
But I am assuming you are not interested in tanking raids for fun only, but also for progression?
---
I really don't see you getting a tank spot in a raiding guild man, with only 3 hrs/day commitment. It's just not enough.
---
I prefer character names to be last names. People aren't referred to by their first names when they have a rank.
---
Renew is actually amazingly efficient, especially with the T3 bonus.
---
Meh, not really. Can't ban me here for having an opinion like they do on twitch chat. So which one of these that I pointed out do you jerk off too?
---
Yeaah, hf getting stuck in the zerg on launch if you're going to take the time fishing
---
Bof -&gt; sheep.
---
Detect magic was a thing to hamper cleansing and I'm sure cleanse costs more mana than r1 frostbolt, so eventually the ret would go oom.
---
100% agree: why is it that in retail 99% of the game is an absolute cake walk and only raiding, arena and high m+ are challenging content. 
---
It is also all instanced content. The danger in the world is gone, and as a casual there is nothing to aim for. 
---
Every 'grind' in retail is basically something everyone has to do (pathfinder) or blizzard puts all these catch up and deminishing return mechanics on it (AP).
---
You can't decide for yourself how you are going to tackle the grind, everyone does the same things and you can't get to far behind or to far ahead.
---
In vanilla if you wanted to get your mount you had to grind for it, but how and how fast you wanted to get that gold was all up to you.
---
In classic progression made sense, and everything you did felt like you earned it. Blizzard wasn't holding your hands with single player scenario questlines that had a 0,00% chance of dying/failure.

All I was asking for is if a simple add on existed.
---
Forgot mages yeah. Priests arent really slow at killing mobs and they certainly can deal with multiple mobs too.

Flash Heal for sniping and emergencies. Heal for efficient but slow healing. Greater Heal is similar to Heal but less effective and higher hps. Greater Heal also get a huge buff by the 8-set T2 where it becomes really good. It can also be used with the priest ZG trinket.

\*\* Not made by me, after a quick search I think it was [made by this dude](https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/hirstarts/shadowfang-keep-wip-finished-5-02-2012-t5979-s20.html).

Love this.

Same with Mankriks wife.

I would develop your addon idea just for fun, if I had beta access...

Everyone did it because paladins were so useless at the time

What is solid about an alliance-only quest that shows as available to both factions?

https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=1396/encroaching-wildlife
---
Mongoose Bite
---
All the other hunter melee abilities (raptor strike, wing clip, counterattack, lacerate, etc.) required a melee weapon to be equipped in order to use.  But not mongoose bite!  
---
Your character was literally biting your opponent.  :D  Granted this got fixed at some point, can't remember when.  Sorta useless yes, but always worth a laugh.  He's a biter!
---
If some awesome guild is putting together a pug for a raid you pretty much won't get a spot as a hunter. If you can find a guild and get on their raiding roster though then you'll be fine. Just expect to be fighting hard for raid spots, and if that doesn't bother you then yeah it's an awesome class. I know I'll be one if I have the chance to play.

So after seeing your post I decided to try it as well and got my old account back today. I just wonder, did you recognize if you lost anything? I seem to have half my bank and inventory deleted from back then and instead of T2 my main wears T1 and blue rings and trinkets, so weird.
---
That is fucking awesome.
---
Hihihihi.... Glad I could help
---
6 hours on a temple run is your idea of fun?

More hard hitting stories to come such as ‘Legolas top night elf baby name 14 years in a row’

Thanks for the praise.

Yes, exactly. This is the 1-person-per-server-unique-mount.

So everyone except the absolutely most dedicated player will miss out on it.

Make Azeroth Great Again!
---
That’s every single raid boss in the game, so, basically, every mob where your DPS numbers actually matter.
---
Worst advise ever. That's true that once your body will be completely scattered and being overtired, your wife and baby will be happy..
---
You won't be topping damage meters as a hunter, but by no means does that make you useless. You do middle-of-the-pack dps and offer an insane amount of utility to the raid. Tranquilizing shot is absolutely necessary for high-tier raids and trueshot aura is a great damage buff. Set yourself apart altogether by learning to kite well and your guild will rely on you heavily for some encounters. Having responsibility to the raid is much more fun than just idly casting your dps rotation. Take it a step further by going into engineering so you can use Goblin Jumper Cables XL to potentially save a raid with your feign death.
---
Shepüü
---
I'd argue that it is Alexstrasza
---
Of course you do. I either used a wolf, for Furious Howl, or I used a winged Serpent for Lighting breath, as they could stay ranged and did decent damage.
---
Well fast is relative to other classes. Priests aren't much slower then those ahead of them. They're only slow when compared to those ahead of them. The amount of /played time on an efficient run between Priests and the next few classes ahead of them would probably be less than 20 hours.
---
it was overrated anyways
---
Vanilla Rank14 Grandmarshal here. I just want to share my story. I took this screenshot on 28.12.2005. I played on a german PvE RP realm, Zirkel des Cenarius. Before there were cross-realm-battlegrounds, we didn't have a huge PvP community - there were three Alliance PvP groups and a couple of solo queuers, and only one (rarely two) premade Horde groups, and NO horde solo queuers.   
---
The Horde group knew they had no pressure - they queued battlegrounds maybe from 2pm to 8pm, there were no battlegrounds opening outside of these times. (Alterac Valley also NEVER opened up, except when it was announced on the realm forums like "join AT on sunday 6pm!") This also meant for me, the Alliance groups, and the solo queuers that we had to wait like 1h30min for a battleground, just to join a battle against the best geared raiders of the horde. There was no PuG stomping on Alliance - we always had to fight a well geared and organized horde group, which was awesome - every battle was thrilling and our win rate was around 50%. Sometimes we even joined their TS server to wish good luck or ask when they would start queueing this day.   
---
I was shocked when i heard what on other servers, especially PvP realms, had to be done to reach Rank14. 24/7 account-shared honor grinding and PuG stomping was nessessary to reach Rank14, requiring more than 1.000.000 or even 2.000.000 honor to get Rank1 in the weekly rankings. On my realm it was around 100.000 to 150.000 honor - more wasn't possible because of Horde player lack. To get an edge over other Alliance players we used the 1h30min waiting time to to travel to Orgrimmar and get some extra honor.
---
Is this a real question?
---
Yeah im thinking the same
---
We need an system like they have in Overwatch, when someone says "gg ez" the addon changes it into "Well fought respectable opponent" or something similar.
---
1-60 in classic takes longer than 1-120 retail
---
Yeah lol. Going to two weddings in the upcoming weeks, at least they are before release lol
---
There are a huge amount of people who doesn't know exactly what to play you're not a minority my friend
---
Now check your bank for any valuable item to sell on AH. Might find some rare removed stuff that pays for a couple of months of sub for classic
---
Pretty unbelievable how many people here defend shitty 1.12 AV because they want it to be a source of no-effort honor points.
---
Sort of makes me want to turtle all the games by capping Snowfall GY and drinking the rage tears of battleground chat.
---
It seriously should not be that big of a deal to get pre-.1.12 AV, and the stalemates are unlikely to be as bad as they were in 2006.  
---
Anyway, have fun defending AV on the forums, if you are in my battle I'm going to turtle the shit out of your game.
---
Awe shit. The black mount is the one per person unique mount? Which one is everyone else able to get?
---
Kinda hard to create a cross-faction character on a PVP realm, bruh.
---
no mate i asked it for the fun of it??????
---
She is the life-binder after all.
---
I've been in DKP guilds twice and both times I caught the officers fiddling with DKP values by removing raids or items months ago.
---
I still carry the title “Bloodsail Admiral”
---
The service yes, but you could still change your name by paging a GM and making up a valid reason.
---
Mining pairs with engineering so you'll be good either way. If your true focus is end game PvP then Engineer is the way to go. Mining will be able to get you a bit if a profit but you can always choose fishing as a secondary and use that to grind money. If gold making is your priority, as a Mage you already have an innate money maker with Portals, and you could always add Enchanting/Tailoring on top of that.
---
Personally I place more value in getting to 60 as fast as possible and professions and gathering slow that down by a lot. 
---
I think grenades are 175, so I suppose you could stop there if you really want to go hard in wPvP while leveling.
---
Whitemane is the best waifu in WoW
---
Yup orb is a toy now. 30m cooldown and lasts 5 minutes. Carrot still works up to lvl 70
---
I think this is because there are people who expect to be able to play in a hardcore environment as offspecs. It doesn't work, and when they get told that it doesn't work it turns into an argument about having them in raids at all. They are perfectly fine in 90% of the raids, but people have to be aware that there's a ceiling. You can't play in any guild as any spec.
---
God forbid you have employees you have to pay wages too when you can simply redirect all those wages to top-tier executives at activision who dont even know what a video game is.
---
Rank 1 is private...
---
I find levelling on the main game quite boring is vanilla different or something?
---
Depends. In EU it's a midnight launch during a school/work week, just after the big summer break. 
---
I plan to be ahead. I will get my midnight launch. 
---
For other regions it's probably not worth it.
---
I forgot that was even a thing in Vanilla. Bahahaahah dynamite.
---
Yes! Also, I hear theres a scoop in stormwind keep. I heard Lady Katrana Prestor was caught smoking, but when confronted no one could find the source of the smoke.
---
my first real char had 36 played days before he hit 60....but yea as u said it wont take that long nowaday
---
Yeah, you'll always find ample opportunity to tanking stuff. And if you keep at it you'll still eventually get the good gear and might even be allowed to tank the bosses when the main-tank has a day off.
---
In the raid I was in it was like this:
---
We had the main tank and 2 other prot-specced tanks. But some encounters required more than 3 tanks. So dps-warrs had to help tanking them, which they usually didn't want.
---
So they sometimes even deliberately passed on tanking-gear to not be "forced" into that role too much.
---
If you actually want to play that role you'll be welcomed and still get good gear relatively quickly.
---
That's not how Xzibit would've wanted it
---

---
Where did i say it does not? I say it does mitigate.
---
Hogger imo
---
We can do this the easy way, or the hard way.
---
Well considering we're all talking about paid services I dont find that too relevant. Not sure what excuse you could give GM for a name change.
---
As far as I know the only time you could get a name change before TBC was a forced one because your name violated their naming policy.
---
Was it ever made easier? I remember grinding friendly bloodsail rep in legion (pirate’s day 2017) and it took me 12 hours but I was in a raid group the whole day farming rep.
---
The internet has been way ahead of you for several years

Yeah, its funny got a wedding to go in July, and a baptizing to go to on the 25th of august\^\^ and im just like "ill try and make it, not sure if i can get time off work since i've taken a bunch of time off at the end of August" :D
---
Why would you HAVE to speed level????? Of course the answer is no.  Play the game however you want.  A single streamer mentions that he plans to clear MC the second week, and that’s supposed to mean every single WoW player will be doing the same?  Based on the large amounts of time you say you have to play,  you’ll be 60 plenty fast even if you take a far less than optimal route to get there.
---
Useful info 😊
---
Oomkin, not boomkin.
---
For melee dps- nothing since they attack from behind thus No parry. In terms of tanking more damage taken which furthers the gap between druids and warriors. Remember that more parry means parry haste, where feral druids can crushed and critted.
---
Ohhh lmao, I hit rank 14 in classic and don't give a damn about doing that again, so guess who is going to be purposely turtling every AV and drinking the tears of BG chat?  
---
All I have to do is cap snowfall.

For my first level 60 (a Dwarf Warrior) i farmed the stone elementals in Silithus for 9 hours 22 minutes to take my from level 58 80% to level 60. WHAT. A. RUSH!

Also if you want tell me the names of quests you want me to check with my lvl 40 character.
---
Goblins = Swiss?
---
I plan on playing every other day for maybe an hour or so, if I could play 8 hours a day like when I was 16 I probably would...but making money irl is important :)
---
I said which server I will join, and explained why I won't join a streamer server. I don't hate streamers (only a few), I really like some of them like ziqo, venruki, xaryu. But then guys like asmon who get carried and boosted by their viewers all the time are just trash and I don't want to be killed by a 40 man raid just because some guys are not able to win a 1v1. May sound like hate but it's not.
---
An add on like that already exists in retail, it’s probably an easy port over to classic.
---
Good loot council takes way more work because the idea is to reward players based on their performance, not just commitment. So you have to spend hours looking at logs, pay attention to what's happening during the raid, note good or bad moments etc. We're running LC on a private server now and I've got pages and pages with logs and notes about my classmates. It's also a challenge sometimes to discern if a player performed well. X warlock has lower dps than Y warlock therefore he's shit no? Well his gear is much worse but he threw more shadowbolts. But maybe Y warlock was threat capped and had to stand around for a while.. it takes a lot of time. 
---
I also like to make deals between players. Right now we have two ultra dedicated locks who both need tear and wraith blade. I proposed to them that they'd roll for whatever drops first and the loser would get the second. 
---
I think LC is much more involved as well. You talk to your raiders, ask them why their numbers are below the usual, help them, motivate them, teach them. That will usually make them feel more connected to the guild and feel like a part of it.
---
Yes, without the W at the end though
---
I'll give you info when i get home. But they are FLODDED with players waiting for classic :D  
---
I made an undead priest, and had literally 100 players around me. It was not easy to kill 8 zombies :D
---
Yeah, listen to this "elitist gamer" /s.
---
This was same on Priest - would use rank 4 Greater Heal for MT spam but switch to max rank when needed.
---
for 2/3 of vanilla youre gonna see good hunters topping pve dps charts, its when aq40 hits and gets farmed that hunter get no significant weapon upgrades that they fall off, also pets, arcane shot, serpent sting dont scale with gear
---
Hi what is a bijou?
---
Loot council is the best. Especially for guilds that play properly with good ambitions that care about the raid.
---
See [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bz1oso/finally_got_myself_a_classic_azeroth_map_on/eqpllj0/) for more info :) Link to the image I used there.

---
They'd actually be banned of twitch if they did cuz it's against the rules to stream snipe. Only losers stream on YouTube.
---
The research actually shows around 6 hours is optimal. The "8 hours a night" thing is a myth - people who push over 8 hours a night surprisingly have higher chance of dying.
---
Tu ne parles pas français....?
---
My French from like a decade ago is failing me?
---
Of the 5 dps classes in classic (warrior, rogue, hunter, warlock, mage), warlock consistently ranked 4th or 5th, in mc and bwl locks were by far the weakest dps class, they only became competitive with AQ and naxx (where they were 4th). 
---
Hunter is on the other side of the curve,they were very strong in mc and bwl, but fell off in the later raids. In naxx they are barely stronger than shadow priest or ret paladin.
---
warrior dominated all raids but naxx, rogue was consistently 2nd or 3rd and mage started out weak, but became the best dps class by naxx.
---
People will obviously have better gear for you, but people always come and go, there will be people with equal or worse gear than you. One could say it will be even better if you wait, leveling in the start will be slower than usual because of all the people.
---
For some people it's primarily a game for enjoyment... not their primary source of income.
---
if anything, it'd be easier to get gear as long as you know someone who can bring you to raids or if you just ask to be brought on a guild run or something.      
---
More people will have the gear already so there's a bigger chance it'll be yours.
---
If he is elemental he will pretty much always have 1h + shield :D
---
This was my memory as well.  I played a NE rogue when Vanilla first launched and ended up with the biggest boner after completing the level 10 rogue quest and getting that boner inducing green dagger.  My brother was playing a human Paladin, and was making Stormwind sound like the most amazing place he had ever seen in his life, so I made the run over there.  Visited the rogue trainer there, and vividly remember the trainer in SW also offering the level 10 rogue quest (only thing better than one boner is two boners (not gay, I swear)).  I remember doing the quest and being able to get the experience for turning it in, but it didn’t give me the dagger as a reward.  I’ve been struggling with erectile disfunction ever since.
---
Same here, tho I have no kids but dogs. When I come home from work me and the wife cook dinner together and eat. Maybe take a walk with the dogs (she does agility so usually she goes practice with them) I play games from like 19-23/24 every night kinda
---
Harassment usually worked. I changed my name that way. Kungen had to change his name because you can't have titles in your name and he managed to change it back again.
---
That is great :D
---
Found this old video from vanilla that I learned soloing DM East from. I used to love trying to solo dungeons and this was easily doable even in fairly shitty gear.
---
He is talking about ele tho
---
What did that one do again?
---
Thats what I remember as well and the private server data seems to confirm it!
---
I want to player a healer, because  thats what I always play in WoW and in every mmorpg!
---
I was inclined to play Druid but eventho I know I can do every 5-10 man content they seem very underwhelming at it...and if I was going to play Classic WOW like I did Vanilla, between 6 to 8 hours a day, getting gear would be easier but 13 years later I have like 3 hours p/night to play and not every day and having an under geared Resto Druid seems like a bad idea to farm dungeons and trying to get a raiding guild...also, I am affraid that people that never played Vanilla will solely look at the metters and the numbers and wont realize that more than HPS Druids are utility powerhouses and in most enconters they can't even compete with other healings on HPS, somethign that for a casual player could also difficult my job at finding a raiding guild...
---
I don't feel like playing Priest, my vanilla main, solely because I want to play something else entirely so since I am rolling Alliance that leaves me Paladin, which I am ok with it since it was my main for WoD and Legion (didn't played BFA) but leveling a Paladin to 60 gives me nighmares just thinking about it!!!
---
So basically I feel that I am being pigeonholed to role my previous main, Priest!
---
Stronger or more powerful.
---
Can also be used in sentences like "Give it some oomph" meaning to put additional effort in.
---
Can you provide a source? I'm looking for the most informations possible
---
Not might, they will guarantee take 1 shadowpriest....
---
People change their minds on this a lot it seems, they'll say no then later come back with "hmm maybe". However I'm pretty sure he said no and I haven't seen anything of him changing his mind.

    Looking For
---
**Eminence** is looking for focused, dedicated, and motivated individuals that have high raiding aspirations for classic and the knowledge and experience to join us on the path to achieving them. We take raiding seriously, including everything from consumables, pre-raid BiS, to min/maxing profs/builds/raid compositions, and everything in-between.   Overall, we are looking for people with dedication and passion for Classic WoW and the mastery of their class(es). Chances are, if you’re in here this early reading this and you’ve made it this far while on the hunt for your classic guild, you’re the type of person we’re looking for. A lack of high level experience isn’t a deal-breaker, but it’s definitely an asset when applying. We are mainly looking for people with Hardcore Retail WoW experience and/or people with Private Server Raiding experience.

Classic is not like modern WoW, for the most part the more time you play it the better your character is going to be.  Besides raids and gaining pvp rank you can do things over and over and over.  There are no daily or weekly limits.
---
If you don't have a lot of time to play it then you are just going to have to accept the fact that you might not be in your servers cutting edge raid team or pvp groups. 
---
Streamers job is to play video games so of course they are going to be able to dedicate a large amount of time to it.  I expect most people to take at least 4-6 weeks to hit 60 and that's going pretty quick.
---
How will you know which servers are low pop at launch?

Cleaning/laundry/groceries can all be done on the weekend tho? Me and the wife do it.

All I'ma do is play silly mage rouge and pally specs. Nothing is funnier than finding something new an fun to play.
---
He will be undergeared to everyone that started day 1, sure. Does that matter? Nope.
---
He will get gear fine as long as he plays. If it was an issue at any point you'd never see a single alt and alts are part of the fun.
---
I'll probably start my first alt around that time without worrying.

It shows when your casting is on the latancy buffer so you could stop casting via macro and cast frostbolt again
---
Shit hunters is definitely a big reason, but also just 1.12 balance is inherently different from what vanilla was like.
---
I transferred servers in Vanilla when I finally found a guild that raided during times that worked for me.  So it was a thing in vanilla and should be in Classic as well for that reason.
---
I took some time to make my own classic list from all my favorites, enjoy

It's kinda like some people just want classic to fail with how eager  they are for people to quit. To the point they're actively stating they'll be harassing people.

That's damn true indeed.

Going to be honest I don’t fully understand, what is casting on the latancy buffer

Not sure why OP linked to a bootleg version. Original creator of [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXp_jFvlfMA) is Rurikar (Robert Moran/Bruce Willakers/Mojache)
---
As Air and WF are both air totems, you use totem twisting. The buff lasts a number of seconds, so shamans are able to have both of them up if they're swapping between them.
---
This allows a Feral, Enhance, and 2-3 Warriors to have both +STR, +AGI and WF.
---
This is far from true, look at any numbers on legacy players site, also the other older sites that still have old info but don’t run new meters. These are all baseless lies and just made up to let you argue, go somewhere else to spray false info.
---
Whats so buggy about them on beta?
---
I've had simialr experiences so far. I want to raid as retri paladin, but at the same time I'm also quite competitive, so I'm trying to find some semi hardcore guild. Classic, apart from Naxx, isn't that hard, yet, they completely refuse even considering taking one unusual spec with them, because they feel it's useless. Yet, ret can do some decent and certainly outdamage slackers. But somehow, they feel, they'd rather take on a warrior or rogue, who they have no idea how they play, just because their baseline dps is higher rather than experimenting with something unusual by a dedicated player.
---
The one guy I talked to, I listed the stats which helps me, my item planning, why I take which stat, what a ret offers besides dps (judgment of wisdom/light, aura, blessing), what consumables I'm going to bring etc. He said, he'll think about it. The next day I get "nope, we found a rogue yesterday, no rets in our raid, a holy can do everything a ret can"

We can not be 100% sure but Blizzard are opening character creation 2 weeks before launch. That should give an indication which will be the super high pop realms. We should also know then which realms will host method and popular streamers.
---
This guy has been there! I also had pleasure playing with some exceptional hunters back in vanilla. Personally im druid for life, but hunter will be my 1st alt (actually Im just leveling one on pserver to get my vanilla fix ... fuck streamers)
---
I agree with you but there will always be a guild that need extra to people to make 40 and if you become friends they probably be more than happy to take a shadow priest
---
"Ahhh potential customer!"
---
It's a bug with ct unitframes where it doesnt show the correct binds on the extra action bars but instead shows the normal 123456789 binds.
---
No one really knows for certain, but odds are classic will still be a thing, new players will still join the game and with no expansions planned bis gear is fixed. In other words, there will always be people ahead and behind you but since the gear doesn’t change you can always catch up.
---
There is some welfare gear in vanilla but not nearly like in modern WoW. Some classes have a lot of crafting gear and of course ZG/AQ20 has a lot of welfare gear and some reputation factions like Cenarion Circle and Argent Dawn as well.

Once I had 3 guys (who just came there) steal the chicken escort from my alliance 5-man group. Little did they know we were fighting for this chicken for 30 minutes against another 5-man group from horde. The other group got wiped out 2 minutes earlier. So we just stood behind a rock, and when the horde rezzed and saw these 3 guys escorting chicken they weren't happy obviously...

I’m looking for a casual raiding guild, preferably a “dads guild.” Was hoping to roll PVP server, any thoughts about the best way to find one?
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/quartz
---
Probably hunter. They can solo/kite most pre-raid bosses. 
---
But if you don't like being social, why play an MMO?
---
Rogue.
---
*Hnnnngghhhhh*
---
People love their crazy sexy dominant women. I'm one of them ❤️
---
Nothing 'bad' about it.
---
My guild used it in bwl on the drakes. It was patched shortly after but being able to res mid fight wasnt something you would completely ignore given the option
---
Just sort by new and you'll find the good stuff.
---
Omelette du fromache

I think this post sucks because its not a shit meme.  Reported for trying to have actual discussion on the classic sub when the mods have made it clear such actions are not allowed.
---
The funny thing is, they put that system in the game to stop the toxicity that comes along with players saying 'ggez', but everyone knows what you are saying so now it's just turned into a way to troll even harder.
---
The thing is - in theory a raid probably gets better DPS using as many fury warriors / rogues + group support as possible.
---
 But as they all share loot, it is way better progression-wise to have a balanced raid including all classes. A full T2 hunter does way more dps than a blue geared fury warrior, so you shouldnt worry too much about which class does most dps, but which class you enjoy the most. If you're a capable player, you will find a good raid guild and be helpful.
---
The other three colors of that mount you can just pick as you want. But it's not regular-mounts, it's mounts that only work in AQ40.
---
Skipping social life on MORPG is a bit hard.
---
You can play solo from 1 to 60 but you won’t do dungeons. You will be able to (w)pvp alone. Maybe you should try to change your mind and start sharing with players. good people play WoW :)
---
Mages, hunters, warlocks are good for soloing stuff :)
---
The warlock raid from a few days ago was amazing. There is some good content here
---
a friend of mine did this. but he has the luck that in the job he is working, you get joboffers drom the companies, so he can start working how he wants
---
Think you meant via (by means of), vis-a-vis means face-to-face with.
---
In pvp you will still have one of the strongest burst in the game.
---
Pve you will be the worst dps class of all viable dps classes in aq and nax. No biggie
---

---
I was a tank, but generally pretty aware of which mobs could and couldn't be healed through. I especially remembering Halls of Origination some of the trash packs were harder than the bosses!
---
They could merge servers and stuff like that, but they chose to add the layering tech instead. So they can fit endless amounts of people on one realm, and then I guess hope they calculated the drop off in population somewhat correctly for when layering needs to be removed.
---
Reported for trying to have actual discussion rather than posting a shit meme.
---
Can you take som more pictures of it hanging on your wall?
---
Our trailer parks are full
---
Both. Baby will be Born ~ 15. August. 😀
---
Not warrior
---
yup
---
choo choo
---
Im taking a week of from the 29th, i dont expect to be able to play, but it will be nice to have some days off and watch some people suffer to not get in, i dont mind.
---
People are tired to talk about it, they just wanna play. Hence the memes, need to kill time.
---
Well you don't have to do anything. That being said if you are planning to join a hardcore guild they might have a date in mind when it comes to members hitting maxlevel.
---
I mean you good play solo but endgme there wouldn't be any content really. But you really need to interact with people in wow, that's why it's MMORPG
---
Says the mmo gamer in 2019
---
Can we get this thread locked please?  Mods!
---
Omelette au fromage* what have you done Dexter!? D:
---
I mean you can just look on legacyplayers at the dps on blizzard-like servers MC--&gt;Naxx, Locks, warriors, rogues, and mages all competing.
---
You can upload your own image to Photowall at least. E.g [here](https://www.photowall.com/photo-canvas). Hope this helps, if you have further questions I think it's better to contact their customer support :)
---
Depends on your goal, if you want to be server first sure, if you don't care just enjoy the game at your pace, you will always find people to play and raid.
---
Take your time sport.
---
&gt; Which is TOO LOW for proper testing.
---
&gt; Too short of a period of time.
---
&gt; There should be at least 10k more people invited to beta.
---
I'm not trying to be a dick, but do you have any technical knowledge on this subject or are you just throwing your opinion out there? Don't you think the engineers at Blizz know how to run their own beta?
---
Lol most of the "talk about the actual game" consists of
---
\- posts about post-naxx that are the exact same things every time from /r/iamverysmart people and they belong in in /r/classicwowplus
---
\- posts about streamers that most people don't care about
---
\- layering complaint thread #24892
---
\- "what should I play" posts 
---
\- reaction bait questions like "I only have 84 hours a week will a casual player like me do ok???" or "should I play classic or retail???"
---
\- other questions that were answered several months ago and take 2 seconds in Google to answer
---
This sub *really* went to shit as soon as they announced the date and it got flooded by mooks that can't use the search bar
---
It will happen.  I forgot to include a shit meme in the op.
---
Sure, just need to hang it first! Need to drill in my concrete wall first and not sure when I'll do that.
---
I like how the Scarlet Crusade are basically all french, along with the Argent Dawn
---
Heart of the swarm?
---
Everything has been discussed and talked about five times a day. People just want a release.
---
Congratz, hope fully you live somewhere with paid parental leave. So i can play a few hours here and there\^\^
---
There's very little point in playing Classic WoW if you don't like interacting with people. The best parts of it rely on being social. It's an MMO. Retail would suit you better, no-one wants to talk to each other there.
---
You got no point. Please stop typing.
---
Okay, no. Let's take one step away from the nostalgia suicide edge and look at TBC and WotLK. 
---
Flying mounts did *not* disconnect you from the world. It was a big amount of other changes, such as a shift in zone design philosophy, that eventually disconnected the open world from the player.
---
Flying mounts in TBC and WotLK not only served the purpose of getting to content, it also *unlocked* content. Like the airships in Icecrown, the flying only areas in Outland and stuff like Nether Drake farming in...was it Terrokar? I want to say Terrokar.
---
Areas like Storm Peak were designed with flying in mind and it made them feel fitting for a flying mount. Flying through the mountains to see Ulduar in the snowy distance will always be one of my favourite moments in WoW.
---
What hurt flying mounts was twofold:
---
1. Treating flying as the *content and reward* instead of just one reward to unlock further content.
---
2. Artificially long wait times of up to a year when there is virtually no reason to keep it past 8.1.
---
If you think about this: most people were done with the flying requirements (except exploring Nazjatar) *long* before that patch even released, and 8.1 didn't add any new content that would have felt fundamentally worse with flying. World quests and a raid, neither of which were different to what came before them and required flying not to be a thing.
---
It's this design philosophy that made flying a pain - treating a feature so fundamental to WoW since TBC as something you want to scrap because "you don't like it."
---
If Blizzard would design *with flying* instead of artificially *against it*, flying would be connected to the world again. Zones that are accessible with flying. Quests like the Pterrodax raising that require flying to different places. Even questlines at places that require you to fly there.
---
Flying started to feel disconnected from the world in the past years because Blizzard *actively made it feel disconnected*.
---
Hunter can solo farm mara and maybe trib but if you're not doing that in aid of raiding in a guild then it'll feel pretty hollow.
---
Engi can be helpful for a mage while leveling and the stats on gear are actually beneficial while leveling whereas they are pretty useless at cap. But mostly, engineering is helpful and fun while leveling and really potent if you leveling on a pvp server. But it is a cash sink.
---
The classic combo back in the day was tailor/enchant the gold potential is obvious and you can make and enchant your own gear which is a huge asset as tailor gear was I think pre-raid bis.
---
You missed one shit
---
"locked by mods" should shitting well be "locked to shit by mods"
---
And when ever you make a good post here with a lot of community interaction, if it in not a meme it stays at like 5 upvotes...
---
Is the same thing possible to do by just watching the animation?
---
Well, I love economic systems in MMOs meaning that one can be a part of it - but not too involved, if you know what I mean. Virtual markets are such fun, not like in real life where you're risking all your budgets.  
---
Afaik, hunters are mainly single-target (opposite to, like, AoE mages), won't it make it slow to crawl between mob packs?
---
I'm gonna be a Night Elf Mohawk
---
Most of warriors were undead and orcs back in vanilla. You're not missing out on anything important racial wise.
---
The top two guilds on our server both had undead main tanks, our guild also had undead main tank and we didn't suffer anything.
---
Tanking comes down to skill. If you're good it won't matter in the slightest which race you play. The differences are so small and boss fighrs are so basic that it isn't a problem. 
---
Only bad tanks are detrimental.
---
That's not how multitasking works.
---
Armor is an actual Stat.
---
Shit, I must be extremely hardcore then. I always prioritize getting the most out of my play time lol
---
booty bay was one of those zones i spent as little time in as i could cos i kept getting ganked and then they would successfully run from the guards ... so annoying
---
Early tbc overhealing generating mana also made Paladins insane.  Especially if you brought a shadow priest with vamp to just spam your group with overhealing.
---
Hunter farming is mostly inside dungeons such as maraudon and diremaul tribute. 
---
Mage farming can be in the world, but due to competition they also like to hide inside dungeons.
---
The Pixel being the only compatible phone is probably just them covering their asses in case other people buy Stadia to use with their non-Google phones and it doesn't run. I'm sure most high end phones from the last 2 years will be able to run it.
---
Yup my wife stays at home since I make enough and she takes care of things around the house. I also don't have a dog, so no dog walking for me. Little things like that definitely add up
---
&gt;focus on pvp
---
In that case eng makes too much sense. Otherwise I'd mention herb/alch which is a fantastic go-to for being self-sustainable for raids.
---
Pretty sure it isnt. The animation for ranged attacks doesnt factor in attack speed.
---
I'll try, I'll try. Maybe life will be good to me, and I'll meet some people to learn much from, like some good Christians, or swinger couples looking for new friends, or...
---
I would most certainly not expect a grenade to scale off spellpower.
---
Hunter weapon
---
Guess I'm going to play WoW super casual as I am a casual by now so I guess Hunter is really a good idea.
---
Easy leveling, dungeon utilities, soloable groupcontent, at least 1 is needed for raids with frenzy.
---
Who gives a crap how fast or slow you level if you hate the gameplay? People are acting like there’s a pot of gold at the end of the leveling rainbow.
---
is that on Blackmoore/EU? I think i knew a priest named Mercedes there
---
You won't miss the only train, but you will miss the train with those Harry Potter like rooms, and amazing scenery going by the window the whole time, instead you get to take the NYC subway.

Awwwwww yeaaah
---
That's why I title myself "softcore". I am not new to videogames, and I do spend more time then the average work/family people.

But for that vote I went with Hardcore Whatever
---
If you're trying to say twitch streamers have a skill on par to professional singers you're fucking retarded
---
Op, the obvious answer is Murloc.
---
Did you know that, if a centaur and a mermaid mate, their offspring has a 25% chance to be a normal human?
---
The main issue is that you'll be horribly geared compared to other 60s that raid and in BGs. Outside of that, nbd, and you'll have ZG and AQ20 (and naxx) to catch up fast!
---
I'm planning on going 0/30/21 too so I can tank dungeons and heal raids.
---
Again, just because people are making guides or talking about how they are gonna speedlevel, does not mean you have to, or that a majority of people will be speedleveling. People don't make youtube guides about how to level regularly, or talk about how they are gonna level regularly so if you judge off what people post or make videos about, you are gonna get the wrong impression. Same thing with minmaxing.
---
Oh alright, thanks 👍
---
dude this a meme/joke that me and many other people cannot decide what to roll (again) while many others are going balls deep into theorycrafting. sorry you didn't catch the obvious joke and only focus on the lvling part...
---
Just a few minor things:
---
* If you want to make your camera panning smoother, follow this guide: https://youtu.be/L0PSKK8wcyc?t=693
---
* There were a couple of lines with awkward delivery that probably should have been rerecorded.
---
* It's Varimathras, not Varithrimas.
---
Other than that, pretty good video.
---
No one forces you to ... Is the worst "argument" that exists. 
---
No. No one forced me to play the game and I quit it when I realized that I could not get the same stuff as anyone else, just because they put things that were fun to had behind a timed wall.
---
If you want to make an argument pro daily quests, then tell me what their positive purpose is and what made the game better for you when they were there or what YOU would have lost if these quests could have been done as often as someone wished on the days they wished to make them, like for example grinding the same old quest for the Wintersaber.
---
You would have lost NOTHING if the game had allowed me to do the quests you did in one hour at 6 days, in my two days for 3 hours, also 6 hours in total. 
---
So why again are you defending this? I still have to read a real argument about that.
---
The devs want it to work so I'd optimistically suggest that even by day 2 it'll be fine.
---
The swiss army knife should be a goblin engineering tool
---
The pet is still quite bad. 
---
But I wouldn't worry it's still beyond 2 month's until release :D I think they may be able to fix such a small part of the game in more than 2 month's but I could be wrong
---
I don't remember pet feeding in classic, was it really that annoying?  
---
My earliest Hunter was in TBC and it didn't feel like feeding was that time and money consuming.
---
Umm, I don't think, that's relevant data.
---
Most of the fight times here are below 20 seconds. There's barely any data for Naxx, in fact, there are 0 ret paladin stats for AQ and Naxx (the couple stats shown in AQ are all prot paladins).
---
Besides, your example paaldin (I assume canoness) does not have bis slot gear (t2 certainly isn't bos and using a battle chicken isn't as well) and if you look into the whole raid, you'll notice, she is 8th overall in dps on bosses. Ahead of one fury warrior, one rogue, all hunters, most warlocks and all mages. https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Viewer/?id=21207&amp;exp=0&amp;upl=33421
---
Even in the other raids recorded for her, she is in the mid field of dps over the raid on bosses (14th, 14th and 18th, so on average 13.5 out of 24 dps in 4 raids).
---
That's the problem with statements like yours. Yes, a fully geared fury warrior, who knows how to play can pull 1200 dps, a fully geared ret pala can only pull around 600-700. But everybody and their mother will play a fury warrior in classic. What guarantees  you, that the one you get will get anywhere close to the potential of the spec? You might as well end up with one, who can't beat a ret paladin.
---
With an unorthodox spec, you are nearly guaranteed to get a dedicated player, because anybody who wants to seriously raid as ret, a moonkin, a cat druid, an ele shaman, an enhancement shaman or a show priest knows full well, that their specs are underpowered and that they have to dedicate themselves and put the work in to make themselves viable. A fury warrior doesn't have that pressure, a fury sits there and says he's the best dps class in the game. Sure, there will be plenty, who want to show that and put the same amount of work into it. But there will also be plenty who just sit on the laurels of their spec and will be baffled when a ret surpasses them in dps.
---
That is very true!
---
Mana sucks - and the raid will want one of each at least.
---
Hunter being quite important with Tranq shot too you at least want two of those incase one is resisted. 
---
Hunter is fine! Fun and has his part :) We can't all just Play Warrior/priest/mage/Rouge/warlock right? :P
---
If blizzard doesn't have data from pre 1.12 AV then they can't make it.
---
It's that simple buddy.
---
That's funny, maybe you should manage your time better then. There's nothing missing here, I listed an hour solely with my wife, an hour or TWO solely with my kids. That's not "running to the computer". I take care of everything I need to do while running a business, spending time, and nearly always have 2-3 hours to play. Sure some days I work extra and don't get to play, but that's rare.
---
I took your comment as a personal shot if you're wondering why I'm a little annoyed.
---
Sounds like you would enjoy EVE Online a lot more than Classic.
---
It can be very annoying. Like when people use ;) after every second sentence. Or they use :&gt; to be edgy. Writing annoyingly isnt limited or congruent to twitch emotes. But its a very common overlap.
---
"LF1M UBRS hunter to kite Drakki"
---
Will you be a 1% player? If not, yeah...hunters are awesome and your normal (sane) guild won’t give a toss if you play a hunter or a murloc cuz’ that’s how normal (not asshole) people behave, so long as you do your best or are a lot of fun to hang out with.
---
If you are a zero charisma murloc and fall asleep with your face on the keyboard while raiding you’ll want to roll holy pal.
---
Indeed. Most subreddits tend to be drowned in memes and jokes. Sorting by new or controversial usually fixes that.
---
Wat
---
You are an OG for sticking to the WoW Immortal meme in every of your posts
---
I can see why you don't like being social
---
It is possible to change the name of the account owner, but the method is illegal or at least against tos
---
in all honesty, i wonder Why they have Such incredible low numbers, this would mean 1K players max. Why don't they just simulate 1 full server, to actually properly test the limits of their layering tech. I know these streamers are probably concentrating the population around themselfs, wich makes it even more not usefull for server testing.
---
(yeah yeah i know, stresstest, but we are limited to lvl 5/10 there, not spread out like we would be 2 days after launch)
---
Trade chat was a rolling wall of “need tank, healer” all day, everyday. You’ll be fine.
---
We love it until we have to live with it everyday
---
3h\day was meant as an average. Surely there will be days where i can play all day, but there'll also be days where I won't play at all. I suppose it'll turn out to be about 20h\week or 90h\month. That's what I was trying to say.
---
A Goblin has no name.
---
It's horribly sad to see Iron Forge so empty.
---
Is this just for one Layer though?
---
Damn right they do! I'm planning on being a Feral tank in Vanilla. Hope to come across more people who actually look at evidence of Druid tanks rather than immediately write them off as meme specs.
---

why not [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite\_(video\_game)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite_(video_game)) ? )
---
Deepwounds scale off weapon damage, not dps.
---
Offhands have a 50% damage penalty as part of the mechanic to duelwield, this penalty is lifted to 25% with the talent, and 0% with the rogue duelwield talent. Why are rogues talents consistently better than warriors I don't know.
---

As much, as it might have real-life associations, technician is a perfectly acceptable word in wow, and -tron is also something, that exists in the universe (https://www.wowhead.com/search?q=tron)
---
You will out level your mining/herbing skill if your focus is leveling quick, theres just not enough nodes especially on fresh launch. Thats why i skip them and just have skinning and first aid 1-60. You vendor all skins before thick leather. Sell thick leather for double vendor price to other players. The first month of a server you can buy the mats for 1-300 engi for around 100g. So just do that when you hit 60. Then you can drop skinning and grab herbing and level it quick with your epic mount.
---
relevant, but if it is not you, its kinda an asshole thing to do...
---
Haha. I'm torn between Druid and Hunter as well. Cant make up my mind. Playing both on a Pserver at the moment to help aim me. Mained a Pally in Vanilla.
---
Don’t worry. Even if your 30 and they are all 18-22 and your running WC or DM they will still get tons of exp. it’s just not very worth it for you. What id suggest is if your going to have a ton more free time create 2 characters. One you play almost exclusively with your friends and one you play when your on your own. You’ll most likely end up making 2 characters anyway so why not just right from the start.
---
Well I haven't actually played Elite so I don't how good it is.
---
&gt;I never got to raid in classic
---
The answer is in the post
---
Did Pshero and the Oogas ever get theirs?
---
But the horse is *alive*...
---
As an alliance player I still suspect this is some form of mass stockholm syndrome you guys have developed.
---
I'm gonna have to go with the Holy Roman Empire on this one. You just gave me chills.
---
it was always there, now it'll just be better quality
---
Context?
---
If your goal is to become rich, the class doesn't matter. Because the most efficient way to do that is playing the market in the auction-house.
---
You start with getting a monopoly on a certain trade-good buy buying everything from every auction that isn't yours and selling it for more expensive.
---
The richer you get, the more trade-goods you can handle that way.
---
Of course that all depends on people actually farming the stuff. Farming something that some rich broker is going to buy to get a monopoly is also quite efficient.
---
Soloing bosses is more like something to create a challenge for yourself and not really an efficient way to generate income. Instance bosses, even if soloable by kiting would be increadibly difficult to get to alone. But maybe there's tricks to skip stuff by using feign-death to get rid of aggro and resetting mobs.
---
From an income-perspective it's much better to AoE-farm weak enemies rather than soloing bosses.
---
All in all I can't really imagine having a great time in this game by completely neglecting groups. The whole game is designed in a way that you can play it alone and in groups but the things you can do as groups are usually more engaging, fun and rewarding.
---
Well again, it doesn’t seem to be an issue of what can “run” it. Stadia essentially just streams live video to the target device through Google Chrome and their servers handle the load of any actual gameplay. As long as a phone is capable of streaming video, it should be capable of handling Stadia (once support for different phones arrives, assuming it eventually will).
---
It's the tabards.
---
You've certainly found something REALLY unique. I don't think anyone else can even access the rouge class.
---
He is getting crit for 700+ every once in a while, the  damage shaving due to blocks isn't what I'm talking about, in your second analysis you speak of the mitigation in relation to the 60 mage in the other video, which is what I was talking about earlier in that the damage asmon is taking is behaving as if he was lvl 60.
---
The fact that we see 700+ crit , which is crushing damage btw , is what we should be seeing for the majority of  the blows received outside shield block, the flurry of attacks he receives from the boss merely show the average non crushed damage behaving similarly to the level 60 mage getting hit, if you rewatch the videos you can compare that the mage receives similar flurries of attacks minus the block , since we know the mage isn't getting crushed much ( only once i think) , it's almost similar to what asmongold was seeing, albeit the game isn't properly calculating player level when fighting vs mobs or mobs damage isn't scaling at all.
---
Ah yeah. Was thinking that with a druid you wouldnt do the twist, but yeah, obviously with other tanks you would do it anyways.
---
And my $15 a month phone subscription!
---
I appreciate your attempt to help, but to me, the hat is a shep-pew
---
Doesnt changing spec do that?
---
Venruki has been using a good playlist like this the last week.
---
I snatched a playlist from Drakedog's website way back that I'm still using as well.
---
Unless your guild really trying to push for server first or something, I believe all races are viable to fully enjoy the game.
---
Undead do have will of the forsaken which can be useful in some fights e.g. Onyxia fear bombs phase, Nefarian landing phase where he drop a fear on raid.
---
Came here to post this
---
Why are you laughing in wow though? He’s absolutely right that TPS is the biggest issue from this
---
Speaking as a tank player, I’ve been across many discord’s trying to theorycraft this news. Survivability doesn’t seem like the problem at all, but threat. This is straight up less TPS from the tank, which on any content phase 3 or later could cause progression issues for guilds with a lot of brainless furys who don’t watch KTM.
---
It's not once pet gains high loyalty level. Otherwise you'll keep feeding it every 30-60 minutes. More if it dies. But I mostly keep looted meat and food it likes. It's usually sufficient
---
Yep, can't wait to throw that beefy twinker out there
---
That's in TBC, not in vanilla where Aimed shot was part of the rotation.
---
In TBC it was introduced Steady Shot to replace it in the rotation so Aimed became an opener only.
---
Was a Hunter. Had a 19, 29, 39, 49. Yet now going back, I don't even like hunter at all
---
I won't do epics because I detest isle of conquest. Moreso now that wintergrasp is included.
---
Hunters Mages and Rogues have there unique way of gold making. Every class can kill mobs 1 by 1 for farming but these 3 have something extra.
---
Hunters have a pet wich can tank and kite monsters away. Use the pets to pull alot of mobs while you sneak by and faint death to reset combat. This way Hunters can skip thresh in dungeons to later on solo some bosses with the help of kiting for good gold.
---
Mages are the king of aoe. They can do pulls of 15 mobs at a time of done correctly. But there are downsides. Mobs that are range or casters makes it inposible. So there are a few spots that are really good. But these seem to be contested by other magers or guys leveling.
---
Rogues have pickpocket, wich is just stealing gold. They do stealh runs true dungeons picking all the mobs. Its a quite a relaxing way of gold making since its not much combat and alot of sneaking around.
---
There is also gathering proffeccions. Every class can pick 2 proffessions. Mining and Herbalism are 2 of these. You can just run around in the world and dots light up on your minimap. These show flowers to pick or ore to mine. These can be crafted into other stuff with other proffeccions. The raw matterial always sells good but its sometimes more proffitable to craft something out of it and sell it than.
---
Gold making is wow is something really fun and complex. Since there are so many crossovers between proffecions.
---
It's 60% of average weapon damage over 12s... Not per second. (yes the damage is terrible, but can land you a killing blow with luck)
---
That's bullshit but I'm not a biologist so I guess you're right.
---
Geologically. What type mineral do you identify as?
---
Man I remember all of the videos of Hunters kiting bosses in Vanilla and thinking how much gold they must be making.
---
They got Staysafe on his stream a few days ago.
---
They showed up on Venruki's stream last night &amp; one of them mentioned that Venruki "knows him" - also the one guy is a pretty good duelist.
---
As good as EVE I believe, plus a 20 years leap in computer graphics and AI programming.  
---
That is: stupid staring at the empty space Where Something Happens In Places.
---
&gt; I understand Its an artificial time-gate.
---
Yes and one that hurts a lot of people and does not have any advantages for others. 
---
I could make the same argument that no one forced you to grind these quests for multiple hours. Everyone is free to do the Wintersaber quest once a day, if they wish to do so. It is just that I could do it on the days I had to play as often as I liked to do them. We both had the choice, the same choice and daily quests take that choice away and they do it for ONE SOLE PURPOSE: To force people to log in daily and hope they stay longer times, keep the daily login numbers high and spread out content longer that doesn't get better or more valuable/interesting just because it is spread out in that way.
---
It is a bad way to make a game. It is a cheap way to make it on top. It made WoW worse the more of it they put in, they started low and then it got more and more. First they put the transmutation behind bars then you had to do daily profession quests to be able to buy recipes or special items to make the good items. They put mounts behind bars, pets and reputation, the best hunter ammunition, entrance to dungeons and raids and finally even new races.
---
There is no reason to like it or defend it, but there is reason to not like it and to not want it in the game.
---
What would be lost if the daily quests in TBC would be turned into "do as many of these quests as you wish quests" instead? Exactly, nothing, you could do them one a day and I could do them multiple times twice a week.
---
That's what makes it a fantasy
---
Patch 1.12 won't reflect much of anyone's who played vanilla since most of our play time was pre-1.12
---
I'm still sad that we don't get to play through with the pre-class review talent trees.  I remember when I first looked at the classic talent calculator for mage I was confused because it felt more like TBC talents to me until I dug into it and remembered the mage class review was the last one and I did play that patch some.  Also RIP AV, our boy will never rise again :(

Hunters are strong early on. Pserver data here, but I was keeping up and outpacing pretty much everyone in my early MC raids with everyone wearing pre-bis gear. Myself and another hunter were consistently 1 and 2.
---
Unfortunately we had Lupos at the time which wont be an option in Classic so that's a significant damage drop.
---
In the end you will get outscaled heavily. Rogues, warriors, warlocks, and mages all just scale better than you with stats. Your pet never scales as the game moves forward. Another reason is your BiS weapon for the entire game drops in BWL. You will never be able to get a weapon upgrade again in the game through all of AQ and Naxx unless you manage to kill KT.
---
That being said there will still be a few hunter slots open in the raid and just because you aren't toping the damage meter doesn't mean you aren't useful. Tranq shot is still a thing, and being able to do your damage from the saftey of 40 yards is great, pulling things for the raid when needed is key, providing the unique attack power buff through trueshot to your party in the raid is good.
---
There are tons of other neat little tricks you can pull that others can't, for example: On Magmadar you are the only class that can fully outrange the fear while continuing to do damage. FD allows you to pump damage into Onyxia without taking threat.
---
Hunters also have a unique rotation that is actually quite engaging especially compared to 1 button spam classes like mage and warlock. Pet management will net you a significant dps increase as well if you can keep it alive by sending it in and pulling it back when you are supposed to.
---
You are also an S tier gold farmer with Mara available. You can easily be one of the first people in your guild to get an epic mount. 
---
You can actually take part in your class fantasy a bit more than others because your full set is BiS for you in MC, BWL, and Naxx. Your hunter bow from MC is super good and super flavorful. The quest is fun and the reward is amazing. 
---
In classic there is alot more to the game than just being top 5 on the dps meter and being the guy that always shows up to raid and is never late is easily the most important thing you can contribute.
---
Who said GOLD!
---
Then see you in stranglethorn vale Alliance scum :D
---
Perhaps changing my diet could make a huge difference as it can help increase my constitution for pain I experience every time I do the heavy work
---
But nothing would cure my back pain more than seeing my name in second place in the dps charts
---
Yeah, kinda what i meant. Just that a druid gets less out of the totems than warriors do. And i wouldnt use a enhance anyways, i think we are going to have 0/22/29 or something like that on most of the shamans.
---
Druid tanks on alliance, way better.
---
I'd took her doll and she wants it back from the kids that took the doll.

Hello,
---
having just rediscovered the blast of the past that is Classic wow, this does look very helpful as I now find most of my more "recent" sources are so modern they are outdated ("overdated?"). Just wanted to thank you for your effort and kind sharing of these resources.

---
Gentle reminder that they aren't adding Battlegrounds for probably at least 6 months after launch, though you can of course still PVP
---
Loved it in Vanilla. This time around though I intend to focus more on world PVP.
---
Gotta get sul'thraz
---
Heroes of the storm
---
Nice!!!
---
If your primary goal is raid dps Warlock is the easy pick,  You won’t have to fight for a slot, you’ll always have a lot of utility to offer and you have several specs to work with if things get boring. They’re great in world pvp.
---
With the exception of pvp, spriests were in almost the exact opposite position wrt raiding. If you’re ok with raid healing and saving shadow for pvp, priest will be a great pic. S.priests were fine in 5 man stuff though.
---
You're gonna be waiting a bit. WSG and AV in Phase 3 and AB in Phase 4.
---
https://youtu.be/u0wciSPO9zg?t=362
---
The chart shown here seems pretty comrpehensive. I really don't see how legacyplayers is relevant. dps ranknigs in mc with better gear say absolutely nothing.
---
Loved lvl 39 PVP when TBC came out and you had my go on your weapons :D 
---
I don’t like hunter at max level too but it was funny at lvl 19!
---
The latency is only a concern if you don't actually do your research. Ever played an MMO, League of Legends, CSGO or other games with server side movement? Did 30 ping ever bother you? 
---
Stadia will likely have less ping than that because they'll have much more servers all around the world. The latency really is not an issue.
---
Jay is rolling in the women i bet!
---
This is what I'm doing. Unless you're a hardcore raider going for server firsts then this is your best option.
---
1. Level engenering to 300
---
2. Level gnomish engenering
---
3. Craft all Bind of Pickup Gnomish stuff
---
4. Remove engenering
---
5. Level engenering to 300 again
---
6. Level goblin engenering
---
7. Craft all Bind of pickup goblin stuff.
---
8. Gg
---
You can now use both the gnomish BoP stuff and the Goblin BoP stuff
---
( PS: End with Goblin so you can keep making sapper charges, strong aoe bombs )
---
Heroes of the Storm, if you weren't joking. This art of Whitemane is for their rendition of her.
---
This is true, although it's an argument that will probably bring about more negative than it will positive in terms of influence and outcome. Just sayin'.
---
If you are going to level on a PvP server just prepare to get ganked a lot while leveling by skull players. Otherwise you should be fine.
---
And other thot sites lol
---
Yes I know but you can start to prepare :D and you used to only have WSG at lvl 19 because in vanilla only join AV if you were lvl 20 or higher :/ 
---
But anyways :D
---
great read really informative and puts a timeline on everything really interesting thank you.
---
and I completely agree, however I had the perception the issues started in Wotlk, I can now see they started in TBC which I thought was faultless !
---
I just wish healing numbers would show up like damage, never been a fan of scrolling text addons :(
---
Let’s be real, no one wants a fucking balance Druid
---
If the tank is literally the only person online who could/would tank the content for you, and they’re unable to get to their PC, you wouldn’t have been able to find a tank in the first place.
---
I would probably enjoy the option to grind levelling on my phone. That said, it would be really toxic for the game overall, and they would NEED to put limitations in place such as stopping you from entering instances or BGs for it to even be considered.
---
And/or money making
---
They are fine. If you arent bleeding edge trying to clear everything day 1 of phases, you'll be fine. Even if you are that hardcore, groups still want one or two of you.
---
I know :/ but I can prepare! That already eats a lot of time x) and the max level char is needed too
---
I’m talking about the input lag not the normal ping that shows you what other people are doing or shows other people what you are doing.
---
Ven showed how long it took him to conjure 2 stacks or 40 crystal water at level 40 at the highest spell level. https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/by1li4/venruki_timing_40_waters_being_conjured_at_level/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
We shall, you mongrel! :D
---
wolfshead helmet wants to talk to you.
---
Yes, it may be one of the downsides
---
But there will be lots of streamers and maybe they'll stream at different times, so it's not like the server will be a ghost town after asmongold logs out.
---
Also, when they DO play, the server will be alive and have unique events unlike any other (because streamers needs to generate interesting content).
---
That said, I still don't know if I'll roll on the "streamer's server" or not, but it's not like they'll be 100% terrible. I'm pretty sure they'll have really unique stuff going on
---
don't forget the secret back chamber
---

---
WeakAura, this addon can do technicly everything.
---
OmniCC, shows the cooldown timer inside your spell icon.
---
Its about time investment to me. Do you play 6-8hrs every day? Or 3-4 every couple days.
---
Having a hunter pet bugged is like a warrior that can't equip melee weapons.  It's just a small part of the game after all.
---
Warlock needs on +str +agi cloak, doesn't win the cloak, people tell him needing on it as a warlock is bad, he leaves the group and pretends to have been kicked.

they give off a strong knights templar &amp; knights hospitaller vibe

Previously all the ones I saw had a lot of missing or messed up shit. Mainly skills which is like the number one reason I want to experience it. If there is a server that nailed it yeah let me know.
---
Greed roll
---
World PvP is awesome with a geard lvl 19/29/39 char :D I remembered that a friend got a lvl 19 spirit priest. He simply couldn’t die against 30ish guys. I mean, he was not doing damage at all but it was hella funny to see him being attacked by 5 lvl 25ish not being able to kill him xDD
---
? It’s still the correct word when referring to a location on the Earth 😊
---
you have the aq20mace and saturas offhand in your inventory.
---
If you have for example a bit of lagg lets say 200 ms.
---
If you cast frostbolt for 2 seconds, the castbar takes 2 seconds. But with the addon the last bit of the bar, in this case the last 0.2 second of the bar, is red. Meaning once you reached that point you can start walking and the spell will still fire.
---
Also you can "queue" your next spell with it.
---
How on earth can this be a thing? You'll always know what you/the competition has, so they should be caught out instantly ...
---
I know I told you roll murloc. 
---
If you read the rest of the responses it's all about leveling speed. I was respond to that shite.
---
You could probably tank for a super casual guild but you wouldnt be able to be the main tank by any means. But there's second tank, third tank, Hell Ricky there's even fourth tank.
---
Well, someone must add variety to these newly created world of happy socialization. What is variety, otherwise.  
---
Thanks for ideas. Though making a monopoly inside a financial system that is a) enclosed by Blizzard and b) will suffer illegal gold injections from external online shops - is an ambitious task. It would remind making business in Latin or ex-Soviet "planned economies" as opposite to Western/Eastern self-balanced markets.
---
I’ll list the few big ones. Almost every pet action, whether it’s attack, growl, follow feels delayed by atleast a second, sometimes, two. In practice, if you send your pet to attack a mob and hit the mob with an auto shot that pulls threat and makes him attack you, often times you will see the pet growl animation go off but the effect of the spell, mob switching aggro back to pet, will only happen two seconds later after the animation happened. This sucks because you 1) can’t blast through mobs like you’re used to 2) the few steps the mob takes towards you before it switches targets to pet means that the mob gets into your dead zone, ultimately making your range less powerful because you are forced to reposition almost all the time. Don’t get me confused, this is not that I can’t kite, it’s just that it feels completely off, making your kiting ability feel nerfed because mobs constantly gain yards on you when they should stop and target your pet instead. Another thing, if you’re about to kill your target and you send your pet to pull another, and you happen to finish your first target off with a sting or your auto BEFORE your pet reaches target 2, the pet just stops mid way or wherever it was positioned when the first mob died, like it forgot you told him to pull whatever target. It sucks because on retail vanilla or private servers, one of the hunter’s greatest strengths was pulling mob after mob, 2-3 at a time, tabbing through them and stinging them, then choosing the one your pet is focusing and gunning them down one by one. If your pet keeps stopping mid way after you killed off a pac, it requires you to go back, re target the mob you told it to attack and repeat the process. More things are quiver bugs which ruin your auto shots, passive stance on pet is broken so you need to be on defensive all the time, even feign death and trapping feels delayed, meaning warrior charges you, you feign to freeze him, and despite spamming your macro or spell, the trap will be laid down, Warrior will walk over it and not freeze. It feels like you need to trap 2 seconds in advance if you wanna freeze someone which obviously leaves less time to do damage. I don’t know if all of these are still in game but these some of the things I noticed when I played 2 weeks ago. I have been gone on vacation since enjoying some sun before August 27th, so I don’t know if they’re still real. Sorry for the mass block of text - I’m typing from my phone. I really hope blizzard fixes hunters because there’s already enough mages and warriors out there. Having these bugs in the class really make it feel less powerful and janky, so plz Blizz, fix us.
---
Oh I get it. Thanks.
---
My crazy wow opinion has always been goblin should have been the first cross faction race and worgen should have been a class and the first "hand to hand" class
---
Engeniering/Alchemist formula works on Classic?
---
I may be easy but I like it hard.
---
The streamers are usually PvP focused so they are ingrained in burning down their opponents fast. I don't think frostbolt spamming mobs makes a very interesting stream anyway.
---
All depends on the sense of humour of your guild
---
*looks at map*
---
Are we there yet are we there yet are we there yet are we...
---
You can be awful and still get rank14 anyways. You just gotta be awful 20 hours per day
---
Yeah its due tho them being overgeared it puts em more in the 45 to 50 range effectiveness wise.
---
Sorry, not AB is starting from 20, not AV ^^
---
I think geographically is the word you are looking for. You're welcome
---
So fucked up
---
You can choose the patch, and I don’t really trust tipsout, I know personally some of the locks, rogues, and warriors topping on a few of those blizz like servers.
---
Shit... you’re right I was just googling it... English isn’t my first language.. I tried :(
---
Mining goes hand in hand with engenering and even while leveling its really usefull to have it. The bombs can make you win fights or battles with other people you would nornally lose.
---
But if you want to play more efficient in the long run my advise would be skinning and mining. 
---
Vendor all leather to the shop for some easy extra gold before 40 for your mount. You can save up all your mining mats for later.
---
Once 40 and with a mount you can drop skinning for engenering and level it up. 
---
You could also wait till 60 to be even more efficient in the long run but engenering is really fun. Having to wait another 1 to 2 months before starting on it might be more efficient but its less fun.
---
The best place is the discord, where a lot of the research is taking place. There's lots of discussion, and In the pinned messages are links to some BiS lists as well as testing subjects. It can get a little bit... trolly at times. The threads about it elsewhere seem to descend into trolls and memes too, I guess its just a topic that attracts them.
---

There's also some good links in the blizzard forum thread. Though my troll warning goes double there.

I would rather have fun and fail then just succeed to fill in a bunch of completion numbers. Clearly I play for a different reason than some, but its when they talk like their small, super serious world is the ONLY one.
---
I can't wait to run there on foot for half an hour with my short dwarfen legs, getting killed at least twice on my way.

Where do you live? It comes out on the 26th in US
---
For the traitor one just keep a horde near moon brook, relog and kill that fucker right before he gets to deadmines
---
nope she was originally on Burning Legion (the server with AEnigma) but was trasnferred over to Detheroc (all US servers)
---
I'd recommend to do your own races starting area which is levels 1-6 and takes about an hour and then meet up at a place of your choice, when a quest leads you to visit the capital anyways. As others mentioned they are connected by a tram.
---
Is it working?
---
Nope, you dont miss out on anything. Thats the good part about classic. You don't miss a season when you start later. Everyone is free to play on there own pace
---
i think you are talking about Viskag the bloodletter, which is a boss drop off of Ony. But if you were a swords rogue and it drops you could defiantly be in the running for getting this sword.
---
I would agree with this and it's why in part I stopped playing. They homogenized the classes and pruned way too many abilities in the process removing some of the RPG elements in the process.
---
most wouldnt but then again most wouldnt expect the skinning knife from ZG, the axe from hakkar or the blood drinker axe from trash in AQ40 or the holy water from stratholme or the six demon bag or dragon chili or ....
---
well u get the picture theres a lot of things that scale, even the engineering shield scaled back then but its unknown if it got nerfed with 2.0.0 or during naxx since there are recordings of paladin tanks using it but there are also comments around the web stating it was gone early tbc.
---
anyways i am trying to figure out what blizzard choose to keep or filter :)
---
Le poo poo!
---
Y'all got any more of them "Kick Starters"?
---
Um I was kind of being dead honest that I wanted to see said source. It is not in his comment. Where is it? 
---
I don't have evidence to the contrary but I also never, ever saw something that bad. I would like to know if it was because I am trying to research unconventional specs. People tout a lot of shit but I never saw raw data about dps. It wasn't really common to see lots of dps records back then and I never saw anything close to 1k in Vanilla. I mean shit I never saw anything close to 1k in early TBC.
---
I mis-remembered a lot of stuff about vanilla and the items I got. After I took the screenshot I went through all the items in my bank and backup and started to remember. I know when I logged back in for the first time in staff was equipped.
---
Cool concept but where do you draw the line, there? I mean, if someone came up to me asking for odd jobs I think giving them my personal information would be low on my list of to-do's.

Not to mention rare finder macros would be out the window!

**Guild Name:** Tempest  
---
**Server Type:** PvP  
---
**Region:** NA - East  
---
**Faction:** Alliance
---
**About us:**  
---
Tempest is a guild dedicated to high raiding efficiency and strong game knowledge with proactive community members. Our mission is to complete all available content and compete in the top echelon of the server. To ensure our success, and fulfill the guild vision, many individual aspects will be sacrificed for the overall benefit of the guild. Coordination centered on concepts such as: reputation, recipes, gear, and world events require necessary amounts of teamwork at the potential cost of individual gain. While raid times will not be moved for server firsts, it is the leadership’s expectation that all content (with the exception of MC), be cleared the first day/week of release. Furthermore, raid members will be expected to min/max to the best of their abilities to properly contribute to raids. Members that demonstrate they are not able to play their characters to the highest potential will see limited gear acquisition and raid invitations. The leadership recognizes that the above described environment is not for everyone and may be different from guilds you’ve previously raided with.
---
Our current members are private vanilla raiders with experience in all available content of raiding, pvp, world bosses, and farming. Over the years we have learned to prioritize collaboration, professionalism, dedication, and competitiveness.
---
**Raid Schedule:**  
---
9 PM – 12 AM EST (6 – 9 PM PST) Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.
---
**Loot:** Loot council decision.
---
**Attendance:** All aspiring raiders will be expected to attend at least 90% of the raids.
---
**Initial plans:** 3rd week MC clear. We will not be moving raid times for server firsts, but all newly released content will be cleared the day/week of release.
---
**Basic Requirements:** All professions, buffs, consumables, and gearing is expected to be min/maxed to provide top tier raiding performance.
---
***Potential applicants should have a hardcore mindset and experience min/maxing in some WoW expansion, with detailed classic knowledge preferred. If you are interested in being a part of this guild, regardless of your background and experience with the current leadership, you are expected to fill out the following application: https://forms.gle/11UVtbgguU8AExWYA***

---
I'm a dad now. I'm not allowed to go looking into things I will probably regret.
---
Warriors are rage starved for the first 35 levels. Fear is 3 minute CD with 20 rage needed, this is nothing compared to gouge bandage, or just sprint.
---
Warriors also don't have any +hit from talents.
---
Sweeping Strikes is 25 rage, so when rage starved with a 2h weapon and no instant attack you normally don't use all the charges. Rogues get Blade Flurry which is just a 15s duration with no charges limit.
---
Rogues also get Vannish, Evasion, Blind etc. etc. on short CDs which are much better for survival then Shield Wall, which just delays your death because you need a shield on so your damage is nerfed.
---
Rogues have higher kill speed because of Instant Attacks, they have more avoidance because of higher dodge, stuns etc. they have stealth so they are safer when eating and can avoid mobs when looking for quest items.
---
I'm not saying that warrior is terrible once you know how to hamstring kite etc. just that out of all the classes you have to be the most cautious when pulling because you have the least tools, and literally no resources or CC.
---
Its funnier if your guild doesn't have a humour, then you can drink their tears afterwards.
---
Thats fair I could of worded it better I see where you’re coming from. To me an hour isn’t really quality time though, that’s just the standard daily check in about how the day went but to each their own. Glad you get to do what you enjoy!
---
So 2 accounts? This is Classic! Can't have both factions!
---
Lot's of QoL changes can be achieved with addons though.
---
🤷‍♀️
---
With no honor system at launch (sigh) theres not much need to rush unless you care about missing a couple MC lockouts.
---
The Used - I'm a Fake
---
and anything drakedog really.
---
Every raid is going to want at least 1 or 2 druids. Mark is still the best buff in the game, innervate on your best priest is very good, and battle res is clutch. 
---
You don't top the HPS meters, but your utility is super good.
---
*Laughs in EQ
---
Part of the fantasy is being able to leave the next day.
---
Uhh what exactly am I looking at. This looks like private servers? What is all this (6 seconds) shit? 
---
This looks like its not even using real Vanilla numbers.
---
So there are a whole lot of fear mechanics in the game that alliance get to avoid based off the fact that they have dwarf priests. You won't be able to stance dance every fear on Nefarian if you are main tanking as Horde unless you time your bloodrage perfectly. So having that extra fear break is actually super useful. I want to pvp as well as tank so i end up going Orc. Because 25% free stun resist is insanely good. But play what you want, the best warrior on the horde for tanking is actually a troll warrior because of how you can cheese berserking and give yourself a free 30% haste at the start of every fight leading to you getting way above everyone else in threat. If you have any other warrior questions feel free to ask. I have tanked through naxx and know warriors inside and out.
---
\-Kyliemanogue Main tank of &lt;Participation Totems&gt;
---
Hm, how do you select patches on that site?
---
I jsut tended to trust tipsout, because that's in line with my personal experience in vanilla. In MC the hunters and rogues used to be pretty good, our warriors were medicore, as they hadn't figured out the game yet. The mages complained about having to be frost and were pretty far down and the locks didn't do much. Though dmg meter came pretty late in the mc times.
---
BWL was similar, only the warriors started to rise up.
---
In AQ the hunters started to fall off and the mages finally could spec fire, so they also rose in the rankings.
---
In Naxx, the mages dominated ahead of the warriors, the locks and rogues were in the middle with a slight advantage for the rogues and the hunters were pretty far behind.
---
Kindof an asshole thing to do really, calling people out like that. This thread I mean, not the contents of his tinder profile.
---
That's because nothing that he just said is in Vanilla Wow
---
Link to Classic Shaman discord? @Reiker0
---
I wanna go get that tankyboi druid. Bearing it up!
---
Additionally to what others have said every raid needs SOME hunters for tranq shot and eventually the expose weakness debuff
---
Why is a missing keyring a moderate bug? It is not necessarily bug at all and devalues the other moderate bugs.
---
You can totally do that and you should, it's the best way to enjoy Classic! Depending on your face choices, one of you might have quite the jurney to the other one's staring zone. The Nightelf-Run is legendary.
---
Yes!
---
Gnomer, SM.
---
One of the best designed dungeons in vanilla imho
---
That is the truth, look at Wildstar built by vanilla WoW devs to be hardcore and ignored the casual players. They realized too late that a game solo focused only on hardcore players couldn't survive without those players. It's the same attitude and mistake the OP has and it making.
---
My Experience for what it’s worth. I was in a Guild in Vanilla which was hardcore into raiding. I was top 5 DPS throughout MC and BWL. Top 7 throughout AQ and top 10 throughout Naxx. 
---
Never once was I worried about underperforming and usually in any pug content (Ony/ZG), I would be top 3. 
---
Don’t let the min-maxxers determine how you will play. Will you be the top DPS? No. But you can be up there and pull your weight while also providing utility.
---
Well situations like that were pretty common over loot in dungeons 😂
---
Yeah and the rock should be a playable race too? Mountain Dew sponsorship armor. All for that hype.
---
Stormx (druid), perplexity (rogue), tribe (war), venruki (mage)
---
And you now have the first patron. :)

Added you to the list, I'll message you with Discord details once things are finalized.
---
who cares about slowing levelling down a tiny bit?
---
(unless you're going for like week 1 Ragnaros kill or some shit)
---
So will the method "pet tanks while you're healing it" never be used here, unlike other games where it's one's main way to beat big enemies ?   
---
Shouldn't skinning be considered as a profession? I mean I would kill tons of hide owners, and they could bequeath them to me...
---
This is r/roastme , this is a subreddit for classic WoW...if anyone is being mean, that’s your own volition, this is literally a humorous post. It’s also super relevant.
---
Blocks all 3rd party scripts and you can then manually allow what is needed to use the sites. That way no tracking etc. Makes it also much safer.
---
not everyone wants to rush to endgame dude
---
Druids have the hardest hitting heal in the game so they are really good for high level pve Especially Lotheb in Naxx because of his vanilla mechanic is so much more brutal that it was later when he was added back in WOTLK. Druids have a ton of healing throughput as well as they bring battle rez and Innervate.

*ARISE, MY CHAMPION(s)*

What's that?

Grab tailoring and enchanting at level 5 and grind a bit on humanoid mobs. You only need 58 linen cloth to get 9 pieces of disenchantable gear from tailoring to make your lesser magic wand.  Greater magic wand takes maybe 5-7 more stacks of linen which you will probably have by 13. Craft the cheapest robes in tailoring. DE it all for enchanting skill points. You are trying to get to 70 enchanting and then you can craft greater magic wand. 
---
There is a video by Kargoz that goes over it. His video also includes making a leatherworking alt, but I just tested and that really isn't necessary. I would rather have tailoring and enchanting on my main.
---
And is this third party add-on subject to Blizzard's name rule?
---
I don't care what you do, I'm just trying to understand the mindset that if you see a poggers in guild chat you are just immediatly Gquiting. 
---
I have a hard time understanding giving anyone else so much control over my emotions that the simple act of typing 1 word can make me angry enough to gquit. It's just weird to me and I wanted to hear your perspective so I can understand it better.
---
Apparently you just want to be snarky about it though. Whatever I guess.
---
No one said launch would be a flop. Even on the blizz boards they said it would be huge. The consensus was that within a couple months it would be dead.
---
Sheep poo
---
Should be 1-60. You are never level 0.
---
Can't wait to sell that overpriced gear to those losers, lmao
---
&gt;Also a very weird question: I see rogues all the time with these super cool looking glowing red and blue swords in their hands, are these swords rare cus they look so amazing I would legit play rogue just for the swords! 
---
Hey you're probably seeing weapons with enchantments on them. Players with Enchanting can add permanent buffs into armor and weapons. Some / most weapon enchantments provide a glow effect.
---
Welcome to the world... Of Warcraft... Classic... In like 2 months...
---
PS: Rogue / Mage are great classes. Take the time before release to read up on these classes. There's a lot to this game and subtle changes to the order you use abilities / spells can have a big impact, sometimes being the difference between winning and losing! 
---
Also... Pick up First Aid, Fishing and Cooking!
---
looks awesome!
---
Its literally me.
---
There was no "bottom of rank 1" before mop. It was just the first team on the ladder of their battlegroup getting the rank 1 title. People like snutz and venruki have a handful of those.
---
There is the Deeprun tram that connects stormwind to Ironforge so you should run over there as the human. The human area is generally very densely populated in comparison to the dwarf starting area and any class you select as a human there will be a trainer for you in the dwarf starting zone.
---
While I completely agree with the first part of what you said about finding the right balance between throughput and efficiency, I kinda disagree with this:
---
&gt; If your not low on mana by the time that the boss dies, then you're not doing it right.
---
Because in that case I've apparently rarely done it right. I always tried to make sure nobody died while being as mana-efficient as possible and maximizing the benefits of the 5-second-rule.
---
I think that downranking takes away some of the skill that it took to time heals and heal in bursts to optimize usage of 5-second-rule. But that doesn't mean you can't incorporate it in your style in a way that's even more efficient than just one or the other.
---
I always prefered playing healer in a way that is about managing my resources rather than making it a whack-a-mole-contest.
---
didn't noticed that, I'm /w a mod rn to change that
---
On the contrary, an argument could be made I am currently level 0. An argument I disagree with...but an argument none the less.
---
Someone from the UK here, over 30 seems laggy tbh.
---
well I wouldn't bet on it, but on the other hand, does it really matter right now? We'll find out eventually with either beta or when the actual game comes out. I hardly think this should impact your profession choice or any choice for that matter, so asking on reddit where people don't have actual real answers is a waste of time.. but then again this is a place to waste time on.
---
Not quite the person you responded to, but in the responses below there are several sources. My bad, I didn’t read the usernames carefully, but the links are there.
---
Otherwise here - https://youtu.be/EBSnGwxmOSU is a pretty good reference
---
I have some screenshots of me outDPSing a ret, with better gear and Sulfuras - absolute BiS ret weap and legendary - using an onyxia weapon and thrash blade, along with wearing blues and even a green. Unfortunately the filetype is .tga or something and I don’t know how to open it.
---
Also several screens where 1k DPS is reached. In my guild, it’s the 2 top rogues and the top fury who does it. Surprisingly, that top fury uses 2h, on Alliance - Bonereaver’s Edge. But yeah, with full worldbuffs (including songflower) it’s totally feasible.
---
Most people will do half that, but 1k dps is no meme.
---
More so in open world questing while leveling up,  trying to run from a few too many mobs pulled
---
Added you.
---
added you
---
Oh well read my post again. Because I wouldn’t leave if someone just said 1 word.    And it’s not about being angry.  There are reasons to leave a guild that have nothing to do with anger.   Not sure if you’ve only quit guilds because of anger but yeah there’s more reasons to quit.   What if your guild only talked in pig Latin?  I would prefer my guild didn’t and probably would find a different guild.  I’m not stopping them from doing it.  I just don’t want to be a part of it.  Nothing hostile or hateful about it.
---
Well, they are horde, so...
---
You got rank 14, that’s what counts! Pretty awesome story, are you going for it again this time around?
---
Ah, that explains it. I always prioritise first aid, so until 80 I use linen only for that, didn‘t realise you needed so little cloth for the first wand. I finally got the wand at lvl 13 after a few green quest rewards.
---
Yes, you'll want to get to Teldrassil asap, as I believe the starting area quests go gray at level 5 (and thus don't give rep).  You won't get exalted before 40, but you should be able to by 55 with the morrowgrain turn-in quests for Darnassus and Feathermoon.
---
the trollthingis you need hundreds of if you dont want to run ZG months on end to become exalted.

Mages can farm elite crocolisks in ZG which can drop them: [https://classicdb.ch/?npc=15043](https://classicdb.ch/?npc=15043)
---
Just put a delay.
---
&gt;I think LC is much more involved as well. You talk to your raiders, ask them why their numbers are below the usual, help them, motivate them, teach them. That will usually make them feel more connected to the guild and feel like a part of it.
---
That sort of 'help' should be provided by default IMO. That's what class leaders are for in my opinion. Also the class community as a whole. This worked very well for us in Vanilla (while using DKP). Every class was working as a whole to improve/help along stragglers in their ranks. They also helped people with alts a ton.
---
Do you know how effective this will be in classic being based on 1.12? I'm not very familiar with rogues, i know diminishing returns exists but I remember it changing a lot over the years. Was this only possible earlier on or was it persistent throughout classic?
---
Here's the thing dude. It's a different time and those days of the games lasting days are gone. 
---
Even if they were to revert back to 1.0 AV people would still figure out a way to min max the system and most of the brawling you remember wouldn't take place. People just want their AV rep and if they want real PvP they are either going to slay nerds in blackrock spire or queue up for WSG / AB.
---
I used to use this all the time in Arathi Basin. Defended LM whilst keeping an eye on Alliance respawns and movements.
---
The pat tank while you dps and heal him will be used alot. Its the main way of leveling and early gold farming. In Maraudon for exemple hunters are good for soloying the last boss by letting the pet tank while you dps and heal him.
---
Later in Dire Maul you use the sneaky faith death technique to reach the end and that boss you kill jusy by kiting. The area is shaped so you can walk ik 8s while the boss keeps chasing you.
---
Skinning is also a good gold income. But skinning is most efficient on fast killing classes. Dps'ers mostly. While for tanks and healers with slower mobclear speed Mining or Herbalism might be better.
---
Then yes thats true. To counteract it you could also stand just at the edge of your melee range because it works both ways.
---
thats great but you forgot some islands

I don't see how posting a tinder profile is a mean thing to do. Dude's posting it online, specifically for potential dating partners to scrutinise, and in what appears to be an intentionally humourous way. OP or not, if you post something online, be prepared for it to end up in some weird-ass place to be laughed at. Don't post it if you don't want X/Y/Z person to see it, simple as that.
---
I too am wrestling with this choice. I thought I was going to roll Mage but their lack of HP without BWL gear concerns me for PVP (as I want to rank). Which made me reconsider my Mage choice. I'm leaning Warlock or Spriest (currently leveling both on a private server for practice). I'm okay with raid healing (so I'll be respecing often).
---
My question is: which is better for PVP ranking - Warlock or Spriest? ---\*edit: or rather, which is more feared of an opponent?
---
PS, the possibility of Mind Controlling Horde offa things is also weighing heavily on my decision, haha!
---
&gt; weird ass-place

Go first 5 points improved corruption then go demo is a very very good spec and gives you a lot of survivability  in the open world
---
Let me get this straight. If I focus on PVE only, and after 1 year I decide to be a PVP player, I can just hop to a world pvp server WITH all my gear and stuff I've obtained?
---
You can check it yourself in the beta just equip stam gear, tauren dont gain any more than anyone else.
---
That's a whole lot of text to say a whole lot of nothing. 
---
Retail literally just needs launch an expansion with fun classes, class fantasy, and fun 5-man and raiding content to be fun like Legion which was in fact successful. That's really all there is to it. The idea that retail needs to bring back 40 man raids or whatever fantasy shit you think makes retail special is ridiculous.
---
Damn Rank14... It's one of those accomplishment's only WoW Players really understand... But those that do unterstand it Show resepect for it - not matter what Server!
---
Also GZ du suchti :D
---
Dude you're actually *more* survivable in that build than a PvE tank. The only thing about it that sucks is you can't hold aggro as well as a true tank spec. But as far as ability to solo stuff, you're much better.
---
I remember duo-ing the Emperor in BRD with only a rogue when our party disintegrated after killing the princess. We did it completely by hotswapping bandages after a timed kidney strike or concussion blow. Revenge stuns were absolutely clutch.
---
cuck is a big favorite among the alt right crowd and their followers. if someone's using it you can assume it's one of those tards.
---
Maybe one day I’ll remake my hunter twink but I plan to save gold for my main.
---
By that same definition then /Roll is the only true fair. You eliminate favoritism and discrimination. While DKP is not fair because it discriminates by distributing loot to those with the most points. 
---
Generally, you do want a loot council that distributes loot based on *some* parameter(s) and that will create a discrimination, that is the whole point.
---
I haven't seen this porn yet.

If only I have access to beta bro... why you gotta do me like this REEEEEEEEE

Dude thats redicioules.

Shit I was playing on a ps and an entire guild I joined (then left within 10 mins) was just spamming racist shit against Jewish people. Like serious nazi stuff and nobody cared.
---
people just want to hate on streamers right now. so many people defending stream snipers camping for hours. if you're gonna go kill a specific person at least turn off the stream and don't keep doing it for hours. the fact a lot of people on this sub and others support this griefing is sad.
---
lvl 12 hunter, inv me pls
---
Terry Crews should show up as well.
---
NA Horde Warrior. I’m looking for a casual raiding guild, or “dads guild.” I was hoping to roll a PVP server, but wonder if most casual raiding guilds will be PVE. Any thoughts?
---
Somebody didn’t play classic
---
agreed  , the OP go running around posting a no context thing , it is like wandering in the forest only to find yourself at starting point
---
Interesting. I'm very driven and always paid very close attention to what I had and what my competition had. Mostly to plan ahead and optimize my spending. Also people make mistakes, doesn't have to be intentional. So although I was friends with the loot officers, I did double check their math (and minor issues popped up a couple of times, but nothing malicious).
---
Maybe I'm just not very trusting though ...
---
Well if that's what you love, I suggest hunter or mage, and keep tabs on what ends up being farmable!
---
This is me, i am this.

Yea, I don't think any devs are going to spend their time doing that stuff now there's under 3 months left of private servers. Worth a shot though.

Gonna be wonderful to have an active addon community again come Classic :). Cheers!

How many words do you need translated for each language? I'm assuming the spell's names will automatically change when you change client right? So you just need help with the interface?
---
I can help with the enUS -&gt; ptBR translation if there isn't a humongous ammount of words lol :p
---
But bruh you play magic cards lmao

Playing on a German rp pve realm to minimise time to get r14 is truly elite.
---
There's dozens if not hundreds of different trade-goods in the game. Getting a monopoly on one or a few of them is not unheard of.
---
Of course it takes quite a bit of starting-capital to establish and a lot of effort to maintain it.
---
But if you ask people who were really rich in the game that's usually what they did.
---
A monopoly on too many things at once of course is not really possible simply because of limitiations on bag-space and the requirement to run back and forth between mailbox and auction-house.
---
They did this when cata dropped.
---
i really doubt most of them played classic ( i doubt people old enough to have act like this), they've been playing private servers most likely, building up a superiority complex over "noob retail players".
---
&gt; No one said launch would be a flop. 
---
The ENTIRE retail player base said it after Blizzcon 2017.
---
Could be worse. Could be a Chapy-you
---
Just looks like a castle to me.

Its bad.

To be honest, opening the screenshot on an iphone 7 i feel like the raid member blocks are absolutely clickable (at least for me), but many phones have already larger screens than an iphone 7...
---
Lol are people really trying to get that axe? Doesn't this have like under a 1% drop rate from only like 4-5 total mobs in the whole dungeon if i remember correctly.
---
Doesn’t it literally say edit info on the bottom?? C’mon people.
---
It sorta ruined pvp when leveling up a normal character but it was part of classic and had its own community so.. have fun :)
---
Who are you using axe specialization for realistically, compared to sword and mace for humans? You'll be trying to get edgemasters just to try to make up for not being human.

Oh, and no matter who someone is, when he is expressing something, IT IS AN OPINION. You should already knew that.

This style of loot distribution works pretty well for PUGs. Want to put a MC run together? Go full on GDKP - run it fairly and you'll quickly become one of the top PUGs on the server... In MC I saw GDKP PUGs that cleared BWL - far more progressed than some of the established guilds at the time. 
---
3 rules.
---
1- if you leave the raid early, no gold comes back to you
---
2- if you can't pay what you bid, you get kicked, artificial inflation of prices is a big no-no. 
---
3- if you get kicked, you don't get gold at the end.
---
Almost impossible. Not to mention potential haste buffs you may get during a fight that will alter the swing timer.
---
Add In Flames to that. Reroute to Remain.
---
Are you going to apend 550 hours getting a degree and learning a foreign language?
---
Not the case here :(
---
Cheap mounts. Expensive training. Rather than expensive mounts, no training.
---
look forward to seeing your own gameplay outplaying two 13 higher lvl rogues camping you.
---
Some quality of life changes will be sorely missed.  But does mean we will have some great ninja looting videos.
---
It's bad but I love it.
---
We do 8/9 hours a week in naxx. Times that by how many weeks it takes. We did 5 bosses in week 1.

Tbf being a frost mage in MC or BWL would be chilll as fuck.
---
Says the sixers fan OMEGALUL gonna cry about the raps??
---
roll for it.
---
you realize the "failure" was literally her being corpse camped by them for a long time just cause she's a streamer, right?
---
Im really proud of it.
---
You can check most PVE videos from the vanilla era and see mobs are getting a whole lot closer without being able to hit the player. In Classic, whether by choice or mistake, it seems they kept the extended melee range supposedly added as a sort of lag compensation.
---
This means, in effect, that aoe grinding for mages (and kiting in general) is harder if not near impossible. Mobs will hit you from max frost nova range, making it close to impossible to Cone of Cold and run around the mobs.

Making a L19 twink hunter was one of my favourite parts of vanilla!
---
When I try to link to the site, I only get a generic url idk? 
---
We have meters now though, and years of information people did not have before, expecting the same in classic after vanilla had been dissected over and over is unrealistic. I agree that when people knew little about the game these distributions you quote were more common, but after years new metas have come and gone. The meta is crazy now, you have people designing competitive specs around Arcanite dragonlings and dig rats. I was topping dps charts in MC/BWL every few fights, same with rogues, warriors, and mages, before ZG patch, without a sp helping my dps. Never seen a hunter out dps me, even on fights I paid about 2% attention to
---
Hi reading ivanhoe., I'm dad.
---
No it's more like a warrior that has a melee weapon equipped but they are not working as intended.
---
Compared to the huge piles of data and information they had to Change and adjust. Yes - Fixing the pet which bugs are all known and reported - is just a small thing to be fixed.
---
Also hunter pets were never perfect in Vanilla. Not as broken as they currently are but as I said - it's an easy fix when all the other stuff is working accordingly :)
---
Its easiest at the end of each xpac, as the guards are set to max level everytime a new one is released. I did it back in Wrath, but it only took like a week of moderate grinding at that point.
---
As Ace Ventura would say, "B-E-A-UTIFUL!" &lt;3
---
Show up after naxx is on farm and get carried through old raids will speed it up
---
Yes, thanks, had forgotten when.
---
Nobody said it's quality or skill based. Just for fun. But it seams, no fun allowed in classic, if it is not approved by reddit..
---
basically you have to farm gnomeregan for each raid, use every possible consumable in the game just to keep up with the rest of the damage classes. How exactly am I being ignorant?
---
It's a burden in raids made up for by warrior dps being insanely good.
---
What do you do after bwl when you have to scorch and combustion sometimes.

Simple. You would make way to much gold if you could repeat the daily quests endlessly. The amount of gold was balanced around the fact that you could only do them once a day. It also gavd peopke a reason to log in and made the world more active. And I'm glad that daily quest aren't the same as the Wintersaber grind. Way more pleasant. I don't see a problem with daily quests just because some players choose to not log in daily for a hour. There were people that couldn't raid because of time limit or unpredictable interruptions of playing. Not all content has to be available for everyone. You could still do daily quests twice a week and get your rewards later.
---
not to mention top retail content is a giant measure harder than the hardest content in classic.
---
this false superiority some people have in their abilities in regards to classic is so misplaced.
---
I bid 1000 DKP on Pure Elementium Band as a shaman on our second Nefarian kill. This was about a months worth of DKP, and my rings were absolute dogshit. The priests had 'colluded' that they were going to cycle through who got it first, with the class leader being the first, this would keep bidding low. Priest class lead bid 250dkp on the ring, I bid 1000 and won, so I only paid 251. 
---
The priest was pissed, and it was hilarious. I didn't especially like him, and he left the guild a few weeks later, while we pushed on into AQ40 and eventually a bit of Naxx without him.
---
Pretty sure Asmongold's playlist has all of these on there. The music he has on during stream is on Spotify somewhere.
---
Exactly! That would get me hyped for the August release for sure
---
You mean, If I chose not to play WoW, will I ceartainly get a bachelors degree and learn a foreing language?   
---
Well, I'm close to finish a master degree in engineering management, so yes that I would do. Learning a foreign  language? It's a close call. I will learn norvegian/swedish in the next 3 years. Not sure when though :(
---
not really new, this sub has been toxic af for months.
---
You will find your place, and you will be less useful. You can definitely pull less than your full weight, and be plenty welcome in a group that just wants consistent attendance and eventual clears.
---
The trouble being that if all else is equal, someone higher on the meter will take priority.
---
Why wait though? You will be missing out on one of the best experiences of your life. Don't wait to play it you will already be paying for it and once you get into a fun guild and start socializing with people you wont go back to retail because the community will be so much better.

Hunters are the best Solo farmers. They have a tank, they can kite and sneak by thresh in dungeons if done correctly.

Can easly do multi mobs at once without the risk of dying and can kill mobs fast.

&gt;     For the first time in the history of World of Warcraft, you will be able to face off against players from other realms in the Battlegrounds. PvP Battlegrounds link Alterac Valley, Warsong Gulch, and Arathi Basin so that players from several realms will be combined into one huge matchmaking pool. Replenish your mana, sharpen your blades, and get ready for some brand-new challengers!
---
are you assuming the snipers won't just follow her? c'mon at least be reasonable with yourself with your solutions.
---
Just as an aside/confirmation... this presumably means that Deep Wounds has a vastly increased effect for slower weapons, which averages out for auto attacks compared to fast ones unless you're spamming skills which can crit.
---
I'm mostly considering Thunderclap here. Not that it's super useful, but presumably even though Thunderclap's damage is really low, if it crits it can apply the deep wounds proc based on your weapon? 
---
This would also mean that a slow tank weapon like Spineshatter would do much stronger deep wounds procs from a Thunderclap than using a similar dps dagger to tank.
---
I guess its all free damage and you need it for Impale, but I'm starting to question the effectiveness of Deep Wounds for a traditionally geared tank given you also need to waste 3 points in Imp Rend for it.
---
They have very good healing including a lot of utility that druids and priests don't have, and very bad DPS.
---
Beta things like, grouping with new people and doing some dungeon runs / trolling the Wetlands boat / running around looking for HK's in all the wrong places?
---
Now what I'm hearing is the hard way.
---
Dont make me ruin that butt ~~Chris hanson~~ whitemane!
---
If you’re really concerned about racial minmaxing for pvp you’d go dwarf rogue
---
Honestly though, human shadow priest is still going to assblast most people. It won’t be “bad” anymore than the class as a whole could be considered “bad” - which it isn’t. 
---
Just take human priest and enjoy your aesthetics and faster rep grinds. The human spirit racial is also best for priests
---
I see what you did here hehe
---
Well, leveling my char to 60 and professions is approximately 300 hours.   
---
Now about getting pre-raid BiS and clearing MC/Ony is also around 300 if not more.  
---
Where do you think I got it wrong?
---
I love classic and vanilla is probably my second fav time of wow next to WOTLK. Classic will not have mega numbers after a while. On launch, sure, but many people will drop off after the grind really sets in and theres no new content
---
exactly this, If you find a guild that is accepting you with a meme spec then good for you xD
---
Wow that's what I feared. It's like "you get an extra weapon attack, but only 60% of the damage! AND you don't get it right away, but over 12 seconds!"
---
Back of the envelope calculations gives me ~20% dps increase with deep wounds. This makes fury look more attractive than arms up until 40.
---
Hunter 100%
---
In vanilla you wore the armour that gave you the stats you wanted easiest int gear is cloth, people forget how many things have changed.
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Asking why is irrelevant. Vanilla has a different way of managing hybrids and it's like that. See it has full hybrids dor 5 man content and half or less hybrids for raids.
---
That's vanilla/classic how we loved it and want it to be, with it's imperfections and the complexity/beauty in it.
---
Yes indeed! 
---
Failure in a disadvantaged situation is however still failure (if yet fully understandable and acceptable). As I wrote it wasn't the inability to deal with the situation (skill level) that was criticized but the attitude (to the failure/loss/ganking/roflstomping etc).
---
and if you're targeting whoever you're going for just because they're a streamer? still great? that's not natural gameplay, it's targeted harassment.
---
It's not that hunters don't scale with stats. It's the weapons that suck.
---
Compare a warrior's/rogue's weapons from MC and then from Naxx. Look at how much DPS is added.
---
Now do the same thing for the guns/crossbows. From MC to Naxx the DPS increase is almost inexistent.
---
I get that, but it seems odd that you wouldn't be able to contribute some DPS (even if it's bad, it's &gt; 0) and then back off to heal if the encounter needs it, rather than do 0 DPS and only heal.
---
He does seem chill, he just annoys me.
---
RIP Hidden mob. He was my hero.
---
I'm excited to keep the stereotype alive.
---
&gt;550 hours is basically enough to get a bachelor degree
---
u wot m8, where?
---
Yeep.
---
Literally from.day 1.
---
Thanks! Do they still cost the full gold amount? I’ll have mounts from quests as a pally but I want a cat too
---
To a lot of the naysayers, Skarm, while being a pretty damn good tank overall, has a lot of info out there where he has Druid MT'd most bosses across raid tiers. The average druid player may not be able to pull this off, but it is possible for talented players. He also does note specific bosses he does not recommend druids for because of lack of mitigation tools and/or bosses hitting so fast/enraging that make it difficult.
---
that is excatly what i ment fuck me i spelled it wrong :P ill get it fixed asap and id expect week 1 or like day 1 or 2 in week 2
---
Don't forget crusader will be quite rare for a while as people will need to grind rep for it! Gives you plenty of time to gear though
---
You are level 0 until you create a character.
---
on your private server you mean. there's 0% chance you played the actual vanilla, since you very obviously lack maturity.
---
I used to sleep 10-12 hours a night, I never got anything done and I always felt like shit. I feel a lot better on 6 hours, I wake up before my alarm clock and I have energy until midnight at least.
---
So would it be possible to get Thrash Blade from Mauradon quest if ST is possible?
---
Well I am married and we are expecting in late February next year. I guess I got a few months of semi no-lifing at least lol
---
Probably won't get as many upvotes as low effort shitposting /sigh
---
Only on PVP realms. There wasn't a restriction for PVE realms.
---
What is this? A Keep for ants!?
---
Servers will be fucked. Its my promise !
---
Do pretty much nothing and get myself PvP gear, awright!
---
8 big exams in a year aprox. Bachelors is 3 years. You need around 20 hours for 1 exam. For 24 exams you need 480 hours.   
---
We learn at a different pace obviously. Some would need less, some would need more time. But you get the point. Playing trough an expansion takes a lot of time and you could easily learn a foreign language and get a bachelors degree.  
---
Just check your /played and to the math. Don't get me wrong. I love WoW. I played it myself a lot. But I'm not sure if I should go trough it again.
---
In solo and small group content, hybrids absolutely play like hybrids. In raids though...it has nothing to do with the class and everything to do with the content.
---
Vanilla raids encounters for the most part don't have a wide variety of phase mechanics, so people fill the same role through the fight, you rarely need to mix up your roles. And then, since there's 40 players, there's always a specialist to fill any given role when there are varying mechanics. And since there's always a specialist, there's no need for hybrids. 
---
Occasionally they do get a moment to shine. I feel like the perfect example of the potential of hybrids is the Rajaxx fight in AQ20. A druid here is amazing. Root an add, tank another one, swap to dps form once your mob is down, heal up between waves, then do it again. But you see, this fight now has a much smaller raid group AND a wider variety of phases.
---
Blizz could fix itemization, talents, scaling mechanics, and none of it would matter since vanilla content in both raid size in mechanics simply does not create space for hybrids to make sense.
---
TBC and beyond really didn't "fix" hybrids either so much as it gave them the ability to excel at a single role like a pure class. The difference in healing power between a Holy and Proc paladin was far greater in TBC than during vanilla. TBC did accomplish giving hybrids unique styles in their pure roles to prevent homogenization, but they didn't so much fix hybrid gameplay as fully eliminate it.
---
wow what great logic. go ahead and explain how you suddenly turn this situation into a win if you're in her shoes? they are close to 20 levels above her, grouped, and stream sniping. i'd love to hear your solution.
---
No one said anything about skill, but if people want to give them money because they get entertainment out of it who am I to judge
---
Good. Mages are beyond broken anyway
---
This is great. Keep this up like everyone says! Very funny and puts me in the mood for Classic! Love the subtle URL “canal woes” LOL
---
&gt;  It would make everyone happy 
---
Except the people who want to keep playing vanilla and have over half their server leave for BC. I'm in the leave camp but let's not pretend "everyone" will be happy
---
I'll take a good retri pala over any bad meta spec. If he farms his own Nightfall even better.  
---
But yes, you're right it's not "required"
---
because they must pay the hybrid tax.
---
typically this means shitty everything but healing
---
Beats six hours of standing in boralas waiting on ques to pop
---
Same, it was rough being a hpala, especially since my PC at the time was reeeeeeeeeally struggling, it was a few months before I was able to build my new one.
---
People get so heated over gear that will be replaced in a few hours...
---
Crusader is a drop-only recipe, no rep needed.
---
Legend says he still has her dolly to this day.
---
[Dating you say](https://pics.me.me/hows-your-love-life-love-life-may-be-a-rather-22020310.png)
---
It was just never worth it in my experience. Your raid is way better off if you top off the rogue at the top of the damage chart instead of spending that cast time running in for a shitty melee attack, or casting a lightning bolt you aren't specced for. 
---
Positioning probably has a lot to do with it also.
---
Next thing they'll have actual masks in game. Preposterous.
---
Yeah, but shift those keys one to the right. That way E is forward, S/F are strafe, and you never have to remove your left hand from homerow.
---
That was probably us. The Kul Tiras Marines have been playing since vanilla and one of our RP initiatives is to populate the keep in question with level 6-8 characters to help defend the ramparts from horde incursion.
---
Funny story, even though it was all RP we once had the guild disbanded by a GM for "attempting to fool players into attacking us". It was restored by another GM like three days later, but that was the only time the Kul Tiras Marines have been absent as a guild since release.
---
Well of course we're together when we eat, when we're with the kids, the hour is solely just me and her. Then we do our own thing when the kids go to bed.
---
Is being oom for a third of the fight not a dps loss? I don't see your point exactly.
---
exactly my point
---
Is Wayne Brady gonna have to choke a bitch ?
---
Yeah I’m not interested in any firsts or rushing to 60. I tried to rush through leveling the first time around when I was younger and missed out on a lot that the game has to offer. This time around I’m sticking to 1 or two characters at most, taking my time to level my professions as I level and earning a bit of gold. Slow and steady for this guy the second time around. I was always envious of the players with Maxed professions and making gold so easily. Now I’m going to be one of those people ! About the only thing I appreciate about getting older I don’t need constant instant gratification for doing things. That fishing grind doesn’t seem to tedious anymore when you see the profits you can make off it in the long run
---
sad, all that wasted plate gear
---
Hey future me. You *did* need a girlfriend and a dog at age 30. Move your fucking ass. Also, don't play Priest.
---
I'm not going to tell you how unavailable balance is in classic, thats your choice but if you're serious about it tailoring and engineering is BiS for balance at 60. For both PVP and PVE, people who say alchemy/herb have no idea what they are talking about.
---
There is no rep grind for crusader. It's a mob drop.
---
Measuring time used, even for past-time and hobbies with time used in something more "productive" is a dangerous path. You might end up thinking you aren't allowed to have fun and relax. I mean who needs fun when you can work 100 hours a week?
---
how many Manual Crowd Pummeler needed for every fight?
---
Bro, hunters are awesome!
---
Solution - roll on a foreign language server, so you're forced to learn the language. Get two birds stoned at once.
---
I know a few Quebecois that did this with our guild in Vanilla, these guys speak pretty fluent English now, and I learned some nifty French swear words - Tabernac!
---
Can somebody explain how to pull so the creature attacks them, not you?
---
But vis-a-vis sounds cooler and smarter, like I'm the Architect telling Neo what for.
---
Reading your comments I think you'll appreciate the Auction House / WoW economy.
---
Consider Mage / Hunter for solo farming. Run Mining / Skinning or Herbalism to maximize your solo grind. Don't forget about secondary professions: Cooking, Fishing and First Aid. Cooking and Fishing can be very lucrative!
---
You'll be interacting with Chinese gold farmers making late night, back alley transactions in broken English in no time!
---
I play 2-3 nearly every day, I'd say 6 days a week
---
I think with all the added knowledge of the game we'll have when entering Classic there will not be much need for CC even at start.  
---
I'm rolling mage anyway, so \*shrug\*
---
Are you gonna use that time to actually learn a foreign language or get a degree? or are you going to sit with your freetime and binge watch netflix?
---
If it's the latter, go ahead and get that chair ready sir.
---
&gt; Classic WoW might actually kill Retail WoW
---
Is there anything that actually points to that?       
---
You bring up twitch "exploding" with viewers, but fail to mention that it went from 191k to 23k in 2 weeks.         
---
Classic isn't gonna kill anything in the long run, which is perfectly fine, a small and stable pop of people who love the game for what it is sounds like a good thing to me.
---
&gt; Shapoe
---
They can.  What you say here is entirely possible.  The problem is that it's not efficient.  If there's a lull in the need for healing a druid can pop into kitty form and scratch out some minor dps on the boss, then pop out kitty and go back to healing.  Or they can stop healing and start firing off wraths.  However, the wrath spam is a waste of mana, as is the shape shifting.  Plus if they're in kitty, they're most likely in a more dangerous position that might see them taking damage which would waste someone else's mana.
---
Beserking and Health Regen
---
Best racials for threat gen
---
If classic goes well enough, they’ll consider looking at those servers in the future
---
the second you said a number, that is random, thats whats wrong
---
where do you get 300?
---
It would have to be done on another server where you copy your characters over or people would go apeshit. If they do do it I hope they get rid of flying mounts and LFG etc.
---
That's true :( Unfortunately I'm getting overly anxious about my future. Not sure if I would use WoW as an escape or as a real source for fun.   
---
Thank you for your answer anyway!
---
Oh cool! Thanks for correcting me
---
Druids come to mind, in pvp you do play them  like a true hybrid.  I would say in some situations you can but raids and dungeons just seem to favor the holy trinity the best in terms of game design
---
I sUrE hOpE sO
---
I, as someone for whose last expansion I was hyped about a WoW-expansion being Cata and who stopped playing since WoD, agree with your analysis and predictions.
---
What Retail currently offers is simply not appealing to me. But I'm super hyped for Classic. The sentiment of most people who have the opportunity to compare Classic to BFA is about the same as mine. So Classic "killing" retail seems likely.
---
I'm kinda looking forward to what's going to happen then. It's like travelling back in time and creating a new alternate time-line from which WoW can develop into another direction... which would be avoiding all the errors that were made the first time.
---
Here's a site where you can enter your class/level/spellpower and it shows you the most mana efficient rank to cast of your spells -  [https://wow-downranking.herokuapp.com/](https://wow-downranking.herokuapp.com/)
---
I'm sure I said aprox. Not the exact number. 
---
1-60 is around 10-12 days played. Which is 240-264 hours.
---
Fair enough. It wasnt clear at the start that it was yourself you were posting.
---
Or just name your pet Ballsdeep and a GM will name it Fluffy for you out of nowhere.  RIP Balls our time together was short but the PvP was sweet.
---
I remember getting close to bis gear on a 19 twink gnome rogue. To be absolulty destroyed by a level 10 dodge rogue. This was back in BC though. Not sure if it is possible in vanilla. It was a very humbling experience to say the least. I made a character on the dudes realm to ask how he did that and he said at base he had around 80 percent dodge chance at all times.
---
And with people like me planning to have 8 lvl 10's by the end of day 1 it should be a blast :D
---
Don't get me wrong, if a meme spec compensates for the lack of DPS by bringing consumes and crafting Nightfall, he's more than welcome.
---
Although probably not very high on the loot prio.
---
Lucky for ret paladins warriors are generally better with DW so they can get some 2hs.
---
Dont be silly!
---
It is by far my favorite as well! 12-20 in like 3 hours up in this bitch not to mention the relaxing music and atmosphere
---
Hunter and Druid. Just take a look at their abilities and you'll see these two classes are made for open world activity and soloing, but if you care about farming that much then mage is another solid option.
---
THATS A GOOD POINT!! :)))
---
I don't think people really understand what the term 'mad lad' refers to anymore.
---
That reminds me, need to dig out the old LG flip phone. Gotta 9-key text my friends on what time they'll be available to do some dungeon runs for those sweet, sweet phats.
---
Well, it seems you are for more knowledable in the matter than me, so I see no reason not to trust your opinion here.
---
I quit WoW in 2011 and have only become interested in the last couple weeks due to the prospect of classic.
---
Though I do feel in the end it's a matter of player skill and dedication. I think a fury warrior has a higher scaling than a lock who has a higher ceiling than ret pala for example. Though actually reaching that ceiling is not soemthing many players do.
---
Agreed if used correctly LC is the best system.
---
&gt; Should everyone present their credentials before posting on reddit?
---
If you are making statements of fact about something technical, it helps to have something to back up what you are saying. This is true for literally everything in life. It's why people fill out resumes. It's why we have degrees in specific schools of knowledge. It's why we have certifications. Credentials matter when you are talking about things that require technical knowledge.
---
&gt; Oh, and no matter who someone is, when he is expressing something, IT IS AN OPINION. You should already knew that.
---
Not really true. There's a difference in the way you word things. You are making statements of fact and you left no room for what you were saying to be interrupted as an opinion. 
---
There's also the problem that you are speaking about things where opinions mean quite literally nothing. The goal of beta is to get proper testing done to the content, if you think that there needs to be 10k people on the beta and that 1k is objectively not enough to test the content you need to provide some reasons as to why you hold that opinion other than 'I just think so'. 
---
If I have a pipe leaking in my house I don't really give a shit what the software engineer thinks about it, I wan't a plumber to fix it. 
---
In this case you are the software engineer speculating about broken pipes. Let the plumbers (Blizzard) do their job.
---
so basically that utility comes at a cost. if you think of any group as being split 1 part tank 1-1.5 parts support and the rest dps (overly simplified i know) a true hybrid is going to fill .5 in 2 roles. this is really useful in small groups up to 5, and a nice buffer in 10 or even 20 mans. but with 40 people those .5s don't mean as much, especially if you're leaning tanky as your hybrid, as there's only really specific content you can bring that edge to bear against
---
about 100 to 300 in good day
---
Twinks would twink because everyone else had bad gear and it made them feel better about themselves
---
once blizzard put twinks all in the same bracket, twinkling died, because all they ever wanted to do was 1 shot noobs
---
Same boat. Torn between priest and mage. I might wanna pew pew stuff as a mage but my group of friend woudl need a healer and I'd like to enjoy easier time to get in a group or raid as a priest.
---
I'm pretty sure I still won't know the day classic launches.
---
No worries mate, yeah i just did it for laughs.
---
The irony is those are the guilds that need optimal class lineups the most. After all, the "casual" guilds aren't going to reliably bring consumables, world buffs, proper enchants. They need all the help they can get.
---
So it does sound like it's mostly due to encounter design, the larger you go the more specialized you get, the smaller the more variety a hybrid can do.
---
Holy fuck
---
I'll definately Leeroy ~~if~~ when the times comes
---
I might even join you this time, haven’t decided yet what to play and hunter seems fun so far. Surprisingly engaging in dungeons and just fun outside.
---
Lmao, okay. I still have my CE box and account.
---
gotcha, just an extremely immature person, had to be one or the other.
---
Enter at your own peril! Past the bolted doors where impossible things may happen that the world's never seem befoah!
---
In Dexter's laboratoryyyyyyy, lives the smartest boy you've ever seeeeen, but Deedee blows his experiments to smiiithereeeens! There is gloom and doom when things go boom, in Dexter's LAAAAAABuh!
---
A lot of people believe that Burning Crusade is Vanilla Perfected. In many ways it was (Better gear itemization, many QoL additions, more specs were deemed viable, heroic dungeons,  more manageable raiding 10/25). If they stopped at BC I'd be happy. 
---
I remember reading a post about someone having an idea about old content if they moved forward with BC. I truely believe that Vanilla raiding should still be viable at 70; if there is a way to make that happen, fantastic.
---
How about the idea of having Vanilla locked servers? Servers that are pure Vanilla, and then you have a few that advance to BC/WotLK?
---
Casual guilds won't down C'thun because you need a lot of time invested which casuals by definition don't.
---
It's a good thing though that not everyone gets to kill the big bad old god eye daddy.
---
There are lots of ways for casuals to have fun in the game and maybe by the time the big guilds have KT on farm some casuals can get to C'thun, it's not a rush if we have Classic forever.
---
My dream is that A LOT of people come and play vanilla. 
---
Blizzard now realizes that the path they started in BC and WOTLK led to the shit-game they have today and instead of re-releasing BC they will create a new expansion without all the idiotic decisions.
---
Is it just me or does this set look more like the rank10 armor? The field marshal set should be more gold, right? Also the handle doesn‘t fit to any rank14 weapon, as they should be silver/blue on alliance side? And why would you take this screenshot without showing the weapon if you just hit rank14? I‘m not trying to be a dick, but to me something doesn‘t seem right with this story.
---
Yeah, you're not wrong. I'm probably more optimistic about it than most.
---
Ask for easier raid difficulties. /s
---
THE barrens
---
Look, its James May!
---
Frost spec is quickly becoming one of my favorite specs. It's just so positive and generous. Practically takes no brains at all - just spam your frostbolt button and that chill ass motherfucker gives you dps to carry you to later in the game. And you also get this adorable little casting animation that never gets old or repetitive!
---
But more than that, Frost spec is just so positive. It comes in the game like "do you want to cast a spell?" and I'm like "yeah! I do want to cast a spell let's do this shit" and when you toss out that cone of cold you're like "SPELLS ARE FUN" and I'm like "yeah they are SO FUN." You don't need any bullshit macro shit like a warrior "stance dance lol" you're just like "nah spells are fun." And it looks so happy. I mean this is very basic talent spec, literally brought to life by magic. It understands it's life is a temporary magical gift (til AQ40, RIP Fire spec) and the spec is just fucking loving it. I mean look at my face, I'm just so fucking happy.
---
I am literally never sad when I'm forst specced. IDK if it's gonna make it into the metagame or not beyond BWL but for now he (or she) a pretty chill spec
---
go play retail
---
BC was an improved vanilla though, don't really see how it was the start of retail.
---
I didn't mean to main it obviously just run 1-2 dungeons with some friends who would know that warlock is obviously a shitty tank.
---
Tanked heroics in the burning crusade (heavily overgearing them with high end pvp gear s3 and s4 even) it was fun but obviously not optimal. It was just something extra we could do in the game.
---
yea, sure x)
---
O can hear the raptor roaring
---
I changed my name for a reason unrelated to marriage and the court order was enough. Id hope you could escalate the request to a supervisor and  use your marriage certificate.

&gt;warriors are generally better
---
warriors are not "generally better"
---
Fury is PvE dps spec and is miles ahead of Arms pvp spec
---
&gt;It doesn’t help that nowadays people don’t care to go the extra mile and are entitled to basically be lazy and not help when they should
---
maybe they dont wanna hurt their back?
---
Maybe you're right and it's the wrong screenshot.
---
But the warrior set had different colors than the paladin set. Gotta dig through those screenshots again.
---
Thank you for your answer kind sir! :)   
---
A foreign server could be fun. \^\_\^
---
If you're thinking about time, then you're approaching the game with the wrong mindset.
---
You should play the game to entertain yourself, relax and have fun.  
---
It shouldn't ever be a question 'how much time it takes to complete having fun' in a game.  
---
Having fun should be a continuous process. Have fun leveling, have fun grinding professions, have fun doing endgame dungeons, have fun raiding, have fun doing it all over again on another character.  
---
When you start thinking too much about 'how much time I'm spending on having fun', you're not going to have fun anymore....entertainment is a human necessity...decide based on that, not based on what other 'productive' thing you could have accomplished in that time.
---
I'm studying at home next to my job, and I have hobbies outside of gaming, and all I care is that I love WoW Vanilla, and I want to play it again. I will find time to play it casually, without worrying about how much time I sink into it. IF I stop having fun, I will quit, whether that will be before or after raiding, or after my 6th character maxed out.
---
That is of course just my opinion, and perhaps I'm wrong, I'm willing to accept that....I just think when it comes to games, we only need to worry about one question: Am I having fun?
---
&gt; Published on Jul 9, 2008    
---
Yep definitely was...
---
Stupid conparison, bachelor degree takes 6720 hours officially.
---
Op must be new to this sub.
---
Mograine has fallen?! *You'll pay for this treachery!*
---
Isnt the sub for Classic only going to be cheaper?  For the cost of two Classic only accounts youre still paying roughly the normal fee from years ago/to play Retail.
---
The only real issue I can see is for hybrid specs like Elemental Shaman and Balance Druids. So, I totally agree with you there. Perhaps its more exploratory in nature.
---
100% spot on mate. Agreed.
---
The old SM was the best set of dungeons in classic.
---
Get that spinny axe and wreck some suppression or ubrs whelps.
---
OR just play paladin
---
i've seen a lot of mages aoe grinding in the beta, especially from 30-40 - is it just the lower levels being at play or are they compensating in unique ways to get around it?
---
What I got salty over is people doing this for days. It's not fun when you camp out lowbies for an hour, when you do it all day your douche popsicle and it makes salty people like me.
---
You are not wrong at all, in fact your approach to having fun is completely right and acceptable. My problem here is that I'm getting overly anxious about my future and I'm really not sure which way my future should be directed to :(
---
It's there in 1.12 at least. Goblin cities are neutral.
---
That is exactly what I’m talking about. “Aren’t likely to get invited” is not true either, also not the same as nobody wanting them. This conversation is dumb, I feel like you are just making stuff up based on whatever isolated experience you had. Whatever.
---
Bad itemisation is part of it, but not all of it. Blizzard had kinda a "rich get richer" thing going on in Vanilla itemisation, where they deliberately designed high end gear for popular specs, which made those specs more popular, so they got even more gear, etc.

But for the most part, it's actually due to natural social dynamics. Specialisation makes delegating tasks and finding people to work with way easier. You could probably do all the dungeons and most of the early raids with a large number of generalists, so long as you covered the bases between you all. Instead of having one person heal and one person deal damage, have two people that do a bit of both.
---
But think about trying to actually form groups like that. "We're looking for a player that can burst heal well on demand, lay down some CC and do decent damage the rest of the time." That role is really specific and hard to prepare for. It's easier to adjust ratios for different kinds of specialists, than it is to find generalists who happen to fill the various combined requirements between them.
---
So... pretty much the same reason why IRL occupations tend to be highly specialised. (Except we don't have alts and respeccing is much harder than grinding out 10-50gp,  so a lot of people just generalise anyway to hedge against meta changes.)
---
I'm immature because I laughed st a twitch thot getting patrolled?
---
DKP is best to get my hunter that ascandy.
---
Even if you count clearing BRD once to get faster access to MC as an attunement your are still wrong. AQ40 didn't had an attunement either. And don't count the opening event as an attunement when you don't count Sunwells opening event.
---
Dude, drop the hostility, there's no need for that.
---
As I think you realize I wouldn't, and I have never given any indication that she should have either. I've also never criticized her myself, I've just stated the reason why she is being, in general, criticized. So relax a little will you?
---
I wrote that the skill level (the ability to handle this overwhelmingly disadvantageous situation) is not criticized. It's that she gets pissed off at getting ganked. While I know it sucks to get ganked, leaving the game and take a break is a perfectly reasonable thing to do, and probably the only thing you (or me, or she) can do in this situation. What she IS being criticized for is getting so pissed off about it and saying that retail is preferable, and perhaps the fact that she gets paid for it makes people wonder how you can 1) not have time play a game and 2) get salty over the game when you get paid regardless of winning or losing.
---
Thanks, I think I understand more now :)
---
Looks like blizzard advertising shenanigans to me tbh.
---
Personally I'm against classic on phones, mainly because phones give the impression of doing things half-assed, no one plays games seriously on a phone.
---
I mean for one, the screens are too small, you need super slim thumbs to actually not end up hitting multiple abilities at once and not to mention the movement is random, you don't get to move the way you do on pc, it's more of a turn and numlock until you press the button to stop, so short / quick and technical movements are impossible to do.
---
You cannot fit raid frames there, it'll clutter the entire screen. So it's basically tailored towards solo play and it breaks immersion, the two things that the absolute opposite of what classic is about.
---
I honestly hope this classic phone trend gets downvoted to oblivion and dies out.
---
&gt; 1-60 is around 10-12 days played
---
alright now where do you get this number? just because you break it down doesnt make it true
---
If you’re trying to get rank 14 you’re not inviting a druid for AB. Period. You’re inviting warlocks, rogues, warriors and priests.
---
I'm sorry, would you rather see more pictures of Pablo Escobar in his empty pool waiting for Classic? Get over yourself.
---
can you link to any official data or is it just bulshit that you enjoy spreading?
---
Thanks I was wondering what the anathema was for I really appreciate the detailed response!
---
There is a huge, massive spectrum here. Unless you're saying, over multiple attempts, that's your average. Some people do it in 4.X days played. Some take 30 days played.
---
Professions taking a set amount of time? Are you factoring in the gathering for all those professions? Are you just going to buy everything on the AH? Are you factoring in the time to farm for that gold?
---
Time to get preraid bis? Time to accumulate enough DKP to get gear from each raid zone before progressing to the next?
---
It doesn't seem like you're actually thinking of all the variables. You just picked a few random numbers
---
Um....that's a good thing for retail. Retail stopped being an MMO a long time ago, how fucking "massive multiplayer" are garrisons after all? The more retail stops pretending to be an MMO and focuses on the arcade gamey style 5mans and mechanically intricate raiding content that it does so well, the better a game retail will be.
---
Trump's gonna tank.
---
please reread his post several times man. get over yourself
---
I would like Blizzard to add BC servers in a couple of years in addition to the existing Classic servers so we the players can choose what expansion to play.  
---
You should be able to transfer a copy of your lvl 60 char from a classic server over to the BC servers.  
---
Would be a nice addition for us players.  
---
But I want this to happen a couple of  years into the future.
---
these are my favorite posts here--when people see this and get inspired to get their old accounts back
---
or you are a paladin
---
So it could only be more than 600 hours in total. Which means I could get a masters degree and learn 2 foreign languages :D
---
I never said that. Don't you ever say I said that ever again.
---
Blizzard needs to address this as currently mages are in a nerfed state on the beta because of melee leeway
---
He gone.
---
Kid took her doll and ran away to retail.
---
Je suis nes parle franco
---
You also have the other way around, players accusing the DKP leaders of cheating when they haven't actually done so. In the days before logs were a thing on private servers this could happen and did so from time to time. Now with constantly posted logs it's not as big of a deal anymore, still there might be guilds not posting logs and that can be quite dangerous.
---
Oh yeah, that "for the doggo" guy is awesome!

you cant really go oom in classic with full rank flash of light, and proper crit

It's not impossible, it's just harder and you have to compensate. You can avoid leeway by backpeddling, standing still or staying further away from the mobs.

Wotf is only annoying while leveling and early on at 60, once you get good gear you'll kill people inside a deathcoil so it doesn't even matter. Facing paladins who instantly dispel all your fears and dots in group pvp is really annoying as a horde. Alliance warlocks are really unique too so thats pretty cool, here is some alliance lock pvp hype [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRS8dRDW7wg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRS8dRDW7wg)

In my experience DKP guilds don't have class leaders. I've only been in three DKP guilds since Nost so it might just be them of course. 
---
But yes, the class community is a huge part of guilds and one of the things I love with 40-man raiding. It's a real shame when someone chooses not to participate in it.

Not really as bank was full of armour for different roles especially hybrids like druid.  We're a lot more gear dependant.

when did she say retail was preferable? obviously she logged there to avoid the stream snipers, since they would not let her play classic beta as she wanted to.
---
your bias is coloring your opinion.
---
she got into the beta later than the others, hence the being underleveled. not sure how that makes it acceptable to get targeted for hours of ganks specifically because she's a streamer. natural gank? I'm all for it. targeting a person because of their profession is another.

However blizzard will end up handling this it will not be handled in the way the private server community did because blizzard has resources that's a private server Community does not.

On pserver they have old AV, it’s really fun. Of course the game is so well studied now, that the game has changed there too. Usually both sides rush anyways.
---
Horde is more difficult because there’s a learning curve. You have to jump up a place, takes a while to learn.
---
But if the enemy team decides to ‘Turtle’ you, slang for ‘turtling’ aka fucking it all up, then you get your Endless Av, all fun.
---
Found the warrior. Just play warlock
---
As a priest you can get a godlike wand as a BFD quest reward at like level 20-24. You can use that wand up until level 40 when you can start getting higher dps quest rewards.

&gt; Mobs will hit you from max frost nova range
---
Yeah this is pretty apparent now that you bring it up.
---
I've probably asked myself "how the fk did I get hit that far away" about 20 times early on in the beta and have just gotten used to it by now.
---
&gt;  it seems they kept the extended melee range supposedly added as a sort of lag compensation
---
Yeah that's right too.  It happens when mobs/enemies are moving towards you and the range 'normalizes' once you stop moving and a mob is in frostbite/nova.
---
You’ll still be taken into raids... I mean, someone has to innervate those priests amiright.
---
Wotlk is the downfall
---
people will ask for classic again, blizz neeeds to make vanilla like expacs or else people will constantly ask for classic
---
tfw i have literally no idea what any of those mean
---
Thank you. I will do exactly that. &lt;3
---
I believe this if the new site: [itemization.info](https://itemization.info/)
---
"Earn it yourself" couldn't have said it better, love these guys.
---
SM on private server is so easy it’s not even fun. 
---
Clear all 4 wings in an hour
---
I don't agree. 
---
It introduced dailies, flying and badge gear.
---
I played a bit like that back in the day... I had a hybrid spec but itemization was the problem.
---
So when I did damage as a cat in my healing-gear I was doing about 1/5-1/4rd of the damage of a real dps.
---
And when I started doing damage in my mediocre cat-gear I was at about 1/2 of the damage of others but would be almost useless for healing as that gear barely had enough Mana to shapeshift.
---
For your second question: Yes, exactly. If you want to heal as a hybrid, especially in lower levels, you very often have to resort to cloth-gear as it was the only gear that had the stats important for healing.
---
At level 60 you'd start getting decent gear of your armor-type with stats required for that task.
---
Hopefully not.
---
Haha I def don't mind! Just cool to see something of mine on there. Unexpected.
---
Just wanted to chime in to say that you conveyed your point really well, you stayed calm when someone was being irrational and your points are very strong, so thank you. You seem like a very level headed human and we need more people like you on this site.  Also... you definitely are not a dick, have a good day
---
Omelette du fromage!
---
Yep. Weren't linked between cities.
---
Didn't even say I do or did it. I was ganked way more. But hey, it's a game. It's a way to have fun for some. And for others there is an option too, pve servers.
---
i wouldnt trust this as its way past my expecations im planning on doing 120-130 hours, when i click superfast for warrior it put 160...
---
so its a bit inflated
---
&gt;G
---
Please keep me in the loop as well.
---
It depends how good classic will turn out, it‘s in discussion
---
She's bit crazy tho, and you know you shouldn't put your dick in the crazy.
---
But that ass tho..
---
and if they do it that way there wont be enough players on both
---
A lot of classic players forgot is only a game. Oh that hasn't changed.
---
A wipe should be applauded if was funny.
---
What a great meme!
---
She's a right fucking babe.
---
Do you have a gun to your head? Do you have to emulate streamers, who get paid to play? 
---
Just sack up and play as fast or slow as you want. You're the one paying for your sub.
---
"DPS looking for a classic partner, willing to experiment with new roles if partner is so inclined"

Or the Succubus.
---
The definition of burnout is tolerance to the current version of the game. The definition of lowering colorants but still playing the game means playing a version very different from what you currently play. So somebody who is burned out on Battle for Azeroth goes back and plays classic. Then after a year of classic are burned out on that so they go and play the new current expansion that came out. After a year of that they're burned out on that so they go back and they see that burning Crusade has released so they play that. And so on and so forth until the end of time. It's how you manage tolerance and burnout. Well not really, really you should be taking brakes and moderating your playing in order to manage burnout but who has time for that.
---
Nope, that quest requires lvl 45.this one works because it's part of a longer chain that starts earlier
---
priest life. my very first 60 ever was a NE hunter on the server Dalaran. I logged into him and checked played time, it only took me 12 days /played, and my priest was my second characters so I actually had a better understanding of how things worked.
---
@hen I played BFA a ton at the start - With a cup of coffee or 2, I am able to stay up until around 1am max until I am completely beat and have to log out (usually for 8hrs of sleep I go to bed at ~8:30p). The next day at work I am always exhausted but, hell Id have a blast playing the night before. I am just unable to do all-nighters like I used to
---
&gt; I quit WoW in 2011 and have only become interested in the last couple weeks due to the prospect of classic. 
---
You should look up some of the newer stuff, I only was able to play post ZG in vanilla and I really find all the new things people found/are finding really interesting. 
---
&gt;Though I do feel in the end it's a matter of player skill and dedication. I think a fury warrior has a higher scaling than a lock who has a higher ceiling than ret pala for example. 
---
I agree 100%.
---
The best warlock is not going to be as good as the best warrior when it comes to average raid dps, plain and simple, but 4 Warlocks and a Spreist beat out 5 warrior dps, so the meta can always be really surprising. 
---
The highest ceiling is hunter imo, its the most rotation specific, when including the pet, and they can be hell in pvp if played well. There are always a handful of hunters on a server that people fear/respect the multitudes of others who just want a fun ol kitty cat will suck horribly. The appeal to players is how stong they are in early pvp while lvling and how easy it is for them to level, the problem arises when they need to be mana efficient for 3 min.
---
Dunno bro. Did you level in private servers recently? Are you participating in a beta? It's not so fast as people think it is :(
---
wow i wish my GM was that helpful lol. awesome to hear you got it back though.
---
That's not how it works. 
---
There are pve servers which simply means you can't be attacked or attack out in the world without flagging yourself as wanting to engage in pvp. You can still do pvp battlegrounds on these servers.
---
There are pvp servers which simply means that out in the world, you are fair game to other players and so is everyone else. 
---
When you choose your server that's it, you can't move unless you make a new character. 
---
No matter which type of server you choose, people will still be doing a lot of both pve and pvp. It's just that in a pve server there is little to no world pvp whereas in a PvP server there is. 
---
At the end of the day, if you are scared of being killed out in the world or don't want to enagage in world pvp choose a pve server. If you don't mind fighting out in the world with other players choose a PvP server. 
---
Many people argue pvp servers are what makes the game interesting and that it's important to get the full experience. But it's really up to you and it dosnt matter. Even if you choose a pve server there will be chances to pvp via battlegrounds.
---
Oh man I've been wrong for... 14 years? 
---
I always said "Sha Peuuu" overly French accented
---
That would be understandable but they can’t even pull their own weight in the dps charts
---
It's fun to watch but wouldn't exactly saying dedicating all my time online to following other ppl around is that much fun.
---
Besides, these 3 would be no match if some butthurt streamer would start hiring bodyguards (yes its silly but 100% fanboys will do it)
---
I gotta be honest some you claim Bc and wotlk were the “downfall” but I feel like it was cataclysm that really killed it
---
&gt;don't really see how it was the start of retail.
---
Did you play TBC?
---
It made the 1-60 game completely obsolete, made all of your vanilla achievements completely obsolete, turned Azeroth into an abandoned ghost town, changed dungeon designs to be less organic fantasy and more like generic hallways to speed clear through, added flying mounts, introduced a one-stop convenient city hub for everyone, made the game much more casual friendly by adding things like an alchemy lab to the aforementioned hub city, added daily quests, multiple difficulties for dungeons...
---
Sure, one can always optimize further. I'm happy to bring a single Enhance shaman along and have it be a bit of a meme, because giving that one person a choice is more valuable than not.
---
*mild chuckle followed by a sip of Thistle Tea*
---
my vanilla guild broke up at c'thun (my previous one broke up at vael). i did get in a very good BC raiding guild as a resto shaman though with a few US firsts in sunwell plateau
---
The short answer is the lack of stat-tying talents or passives and the lack of abilities covering inherent weaknesses.
---
A good example of that is TBC class rework when these ties were formed. Enhancement Shaman SPD/Healing started to scale with Attack Power, Paladin Tank mana regeneration was tied to the amount of received healing. These connections are non-existant in classic and your only source of stats is wonky-itemized gear which is not sufficient.
---
Regarding abilities, paladins received taunt, ranged pull spell and shammies got Shamanistic Rage for mana regeneration.
---
Thanks a lot for your answer! You made it clear. I'm going for the pvp server then :) also, the pvp servers are the most popular yea?
---
Who?
---
This seems pretty significant, not only for mages
---
the world record is 116 hours or so, this is solo. idk if being a warrior means 44 extra hours...
---
just find a guide you like, im sure you can get that number under 200
---
As always, every single time, on every single occasion, there wont be enough priests.
---
As always, the guys crying dwarf is best, are playing DPS because they themselves too couldnt be botheres to be a dwarf priest.
---
Play the priest that you want. If its dwarf, great you play the best race! If not, no worries. Except you want to play in that 20h uptime guild with world firsts. which you wont.
---
more like ,desperately trying to protect the orb of power from the chinese overlords who are coming to take it. :P
---
Posts like this make it really hard to reconsider my class-choice.
---
Told my friend I'll be mage but was secretly flirting with warrior, priest and druid... but those all would eventually require me to press more than one button!
---
How can 5 lvl 40s do Sunken Temple? I dont recall that being possible in vanilla WoW. I clearly remember doing the instance at lvl 50 with a lvl 60 warrior tank in the group.
---
Warriors and Druids can do this pretty well, switching between tanking and dealing damage.
---
I got trolled no ? :(
---
&gt;  but you don't get to kill the heroic raids.
---
as 2x3 hours per weak we cleaned the whole content in every mode of difficulty. The only thing that fucked our guild is the 20man mode.
---
Healing in bursts makes it more likely that someone will die.  If you keep everyone as close to full health as possible then they are less likely to die to unexpected damage.  If you do intentionally leave people &lt;80% then I would really try to keep track of their positioning until they get healed.
---
I believe the only price discount is the 10% from being Honored.
---
nothing seemed to be lost. pretty much how i left it.
---
Also sounds weird for a native French speaker because of the exaggerated tonic accent/stress. In French, there's no such thing. When a native english speaker says chapeau (shapoe), to us, it just sounds like SHAAAAAAÂÂAPÔÔÔÔOOOOOoooe.
---
Semi-related question here, I've scoured the internet for this answer, but it would be great to get confirmation...
---
As a Dwarf if I wanted to start leveling in Night Elf quest hubs, it looks like I would have to run from Dun Morough to Loch Modan to Wetlands and take the boat to Auberdine / Dark Shore and take the portal to Darnassus then run over to the Night Elf starting quest zone. Is that correct? 
---
Unpopular opinion, but I don't like the Ram mount. Dwarf On a Tiger in Shadowform is as pro as you can get, amiright?
---
&gt; There will be no such thing as vanilla servers Frozen at the end of content
---
There will. People want classic and they want a "museum" of their characters. If you do anything to disturb that people will simply ask for classic back. You can't force 1.14 because then it's not the same game, same with TBC. They need to be separate servers or the entire cycle just starts again. I can *maybe* see them getting away with just adding hard modes and beefed up versions of the tier sets but again, then it's a new game and you're taking classic away.
---
I liked BC but I also disliked a lot about it.
---
I would love to see an Expansion that simply doesn't feel like one.
---
Have Balance changes - I'm all for that! But don't add a new continent, dailies, badges etc. 
---
Leave the old ranking System. Add Arena. Add new Raids that were supposed to be in classic anyways.
---
Emerald Dream, Karazhan and something else :D The Dark Portal could be a raid in itself. 
---
Just tweak the weak bits a bit without adding anything too Major new that could somehow take away from the community aspect of the game. Leave 40 man raids and everything.. .I would love to see how that would work out.
---
It might be a failure but I would love to see Blizzard giving it a shot.
---
We'll see :) I'll bookmark this thread.  
---
I'm really curious if I'm gonna play WoW or not.  
---
Also I'm curious about your leveling time. It will be above 200, you will see :)
---
What is this, are you unable to read what I'm writing or are you just trolling? I'm fucking agreeing with you, what are you not getting? Do I have to spell it out in a fucking point list for you to understand?
---
* I am not criticizing her.
---
* I think she did the sensible thing and left the game, **I agree with you**.
---
* It is shitty to get ganked, in this case because of being a streamer but it's irrelevant, **I agree with you**.

* She gets criticism, **not from me** but from others, for getting pissed off because she shouldn't when she gets paid regardless.

Lad of the mad variety.
---
Negative.
---
I'm likely doing Warrior but wanted to find out for hybrids since I wasn't against a Paladin, but healing has never been my jive.

I saw another player from Hellscream last night and we both stopped and did a double take before going about our business. A player without the asterisk next to their name is a rarity.

When the baby comes it isnt as super hands on as it is when they get to 8 months or so. And if your wife is doing most of the feeding due to biology, you will have loads of time . Practice playing with just your mouse and holding you baby in you other arm
---
Tier 2 is Stormrage. Head drops from Onyxia, legs from Ragnaros and the rest drops in Blackwing lair. It's a healing set.
---
Playing and see what happends
---
I have a sister who's going to play but since she won't be on that much and I don't want to put pressure on her to level faster; I'll just make two characters to play on. I'll get to 60 a bit slower due to it but then again it won't matter too much being a week or so late to the party. 
---
With that you don't have to miss out on any fun experiences with your friends and you'll have two 60s! 
---
(Sidenote:I'd recommend making a second Hunter/Mage to use for gold making purposes but it doesn't matter too much since you can make bank from your main too, just nice to have something that can do instanced farms)
---
Meanwhile hunters are like what's threat?  feigns death. 
---
I keep telling people I was competing with the thunder fury rogue in AQ40 DPS with my hunter, but private server babies be like no.
---
I guess that in Raids you don't want hybrids if you think logically.
---
Why would a 40 man raid take 35 People that are all amazing at their roles and then pick 5 People that are not really DPS, not really Heals and can't tank in any way because they would die to the big raid bosses :d
---
It would work if they were amazing at everything they do but that would totally destroy the PVP aspect because it would make them OP... Healing Tankdps :D
---
I would love to Play my druid that way in raids but the truth is - they aren't even the best at healing xD 
---
But good enough :)
---
Everything in vanilla is resource constrained. The reason you see tons of rogues, warriors, mages and warlocks doing dps in raids is because they all have some way to regenerate their main dps resource. Warlocks turn health into mana, mages can evocate and use their mana gems, rogues regen energy in combat and warriors get rage by hitting enemies.  Shadowpriest doesn’t regenerate mana in any way in combat beyond normal five second rule regen. If the fight doesn’t have adds, you’ll be out of mana quickly and spend most of your time just wanding.
---
The classic one does look slightly shorter

This meme can't be overused. I love it.

Depends on the fight. On a MC speedrun, about one per boss. On naxx, you can expect more than that.

No matter how your future goes, everyone deserves some rest and relaxation time. Even if it's just an hour or two and not even every day. Having anxiety is difficult to deal with, but your worry shouldn't be the time you spend on gaming.
---
I did the same thing about reading books. Thinking about how long a chapter takes to read, how many chapter the books I'm reading has, and how many books there are in the series I'm reading, and whether all that time invested is worth it instead of say, reading books about educational materials.  
---
It's worth it, that's the answer always. Just piece-meal it, don't go all in 24/7 with entertainment, it would burn you out anyway. Do it when you feel like you need it, and if it's not fun anymore, don't, just take a break and come back to it at a later date, and entertain yourself with something else in the meanwhile. Allocate other time for studies, never your entertainment time.  
---
If you use up your relaxation moments with studying, that would just injure your mental health even further. You will get exhausted all the time, and your attention span will weaken, you will notice that you can't pay attention to things, your focus will be all over the place, and you will waste more time forcing yourself to be productive than if you would have had a healthy mix of work, studying and having fun.  
---
But you go down your own road, and wherever it will take, I wish you good luck\~ If not from other's mistakes, I hope you learn from your own. Many don't.
---
Here's a way to think about it:
---
There's only two good reasons to do something other than preserving energy:
---
a) having fun
---
b) avoiding pain
---
If you can't figure out how doing something fits either of those, then don't do it.
---
Since you apparently don't have to think about avoiding pain while playing wow, the only things that come into question for doing instead of playing wow are things that are even more fun.
---
I agree. "Shit game" might be a bit rough, it's still objectively a top 3 mmo even with the very outdated graphics imo. But Classic is just.. better. I agree that a relaunch of these expansions with the "old" system would be amazing.
---
But it was that way in vanilla.
---
There’s going to be more players than retail that is millions. No one wants to play baby wow except noobs . They are only on it because classic is not released
---
Now that they will have a mechanism in place for launching classic servers I see them launching New Classic servers every so often. But they do not keep servers open for all time when that population is only going to dwindle. Because this is probably a long-term plan for them and that realm list can get cluttered awfully fast.
---
And for many of us the point of the value and fun found in burning Crusade was the first time experience of bringing characters from 1 expansion and taking them into another and having that emotional connection with those characters and wanting to continue. Now maybe they will come up with some kind of retirement server plan, they did get input from private server developers I assume but we don't know what all they said.
---
It's like WoW, but for ants.
---
Fucking shagul
---
It needs fixed, badly. It's not just in pve but also effects PvP. Like warriors have no dead zone. They can get melee hits on enemy players from charge range, which is pretty busted.
---
and done.
---
This is why we can't have nice things.
---
As a non-paladin, perfect play would require keeping all ranks of your big heal (above level 20) on your bar.  Every time that you cast a heal you guess at what rank will leave the target full by the time the heal casts, with as little over-heal as possible.
---
In practice no one is going to play perfectly.  Still, in vanilla I did have around 7 ranks of healing touch on my bars.  Druids have the slowest cast time, so you get more time to decide which rank your next heal will be.
---
If I were to do it again, I would probably simplify it by using every other rank.  (4, 6, 8, 10 and later 11).
---
Their height was increased by 20%.
---
Pretty certain changing your characters textures is a bannable offence. Knew someone that got banned for changing his Dwarf to a Night Elf.
---
i think it is part of the fun to not plan anything ahead and just play and see what happens maybe ?
---
You getting this all wrong my man, it’s about the journey not the destination. If you’re focusing too hard on where you wanna be, you’ll forget where you are.
---
Play the game brother, have fun, and if you don’t make it too Naxx who cares! Zul Farrak with your bro’s is way more fun anyway!
---
=)
---
I don't agree with it, it's why I'm rolling PvE, but yes the common mindset is they deserve it for telegraphing their position.
---
PvP server mentality is starting to look very toxic and cringey.
---
in vanilla you competed for ranks based on your own server, so people in a high population server would have to invest a lot more time into the game in order to hit higher ranks. i know in my server on alliance we had around 10 minutes queues, horde was usually 30-40 minutes. AB was 50/50, WSG was 90/10 (horde-alliance), AV was 10/90 (horde-alliance) for win rates. given WSG is actually balanced I have no idea why horde was always better at it
---
Look at all the stats on Season 1 gladiator armor and compare it to Magtheridon's lair / Gruul's Lair / Kharazan pieces. Then do the same for season 2 and SSC/TK gear. Then do it for S3 gear and Hyjal / Black Temple. The DPS gains from PVE gear were very insignificant because the PVP gear all had hit, crit, and the primary class damage stat (str for warriors/ agi for rogues, etc.) Full PVP gear had zero problems with getting hit capped and did damage as good as, if not better than, equivalent gear that came from raiding. If you were in a guild that could consistently clear SSC and TK before Season 1 was over, you were way above the skill cap necessary to get 2000+ rating in pvp. PVP was a much easier and more accessible way to get gear that worked great in raids. The PVE gear had barely more damage stat benefit than PVP gear, and the DPS difference between a glad-decked pvper and a pve only raider was minimal.

Do you have any reason to believe that even 1.10 AV wouldn't still be a 15-30 minute PvE rush?

Not really, it will be unique that anyone can tune in and see the smaller stories like this - but it won't be unique to streamers server.
---
This kind of stuff happened a lot in vanilla, and still happens on private servers. The big difference is 99% of people don't know because its not advertised and disseminated like stream content is
---
It's like it's just not even a person. Just a goblin.
---
Fair enough, it is weird trying to get people to make the same sounds when they flap their mouth and push vibrations up their throats. And then even further difficult when trying to explain it using a toneless text medium.
---
Even with the Sha-poe explanation I tried giving, some "native English speakers" still probably pronounce that differently.
---
That's cause your guild was no where near the top 50 or so guilds. On the latest private server which has a pop of 10k there were over 40 guilds to kill Cthune so not being able to down twin emps is seen as being bad now a days.

---
he just means you have several different ranks of a spell on your cast bar (or in key bindings).  obviously you can do this, instead of removing all ranks except one of a spell and keep changing it.   
---
for example, you may have both the highest rank of Heal on your cast bars, and also a low rank that is more mana efficient and you will use in dungeons.         
---
&gt;You don't keep certain ranks.    
---
is not right. You absolutely could keep two different ranks of a spell on your cast bars.   
---
Maybe you want the highest rank Heal spell for when you want a larger heal (than a lower ranked Heal) and mana is not an issue.
---
Your screenshots aren't helpful. The player taking the screenshot could have different zoom or be standing in a different spot. And frankly it really looks like it was taken at a very different angle.     
---
In order to compare like with like you need four things:    
---
 - Consistent player zoom.    
---
 - Consistent graphical settings.    
---
 - Consistent Gnome/Tauren positioning/facing   
---
 - Consistent player positioning/facing   
---
I don't know why nobody has done this? If you had beta access it would take 20 minutes tops. And most of that is just traveling to geometry/texture that hasn't changed since vanilla. Even this location is fine, it just needs better context and consistency.
---
I hope they add additional content at 60.
---
The tone of your post is a bit odd/aggressive but I agree with your premise. The 5-man and raid content of modern WoW is stellar. Mythic+ has been a smash hit, one of the best new systems ever implemented, regardless of Asmongold's or any other streamer's gripes about it - it is undeniably insanely popular and in many respects propping up modern WoW on its back. The raid content has also been excellent at points. The MMO elements don't really do that much to serve the purposes of the game in many respects. Still, at this point WoW is probably going to continue to pretend to be an "MMO" because that is what it is expected to be.
---
&gt; You should look up some of the newer stuff, I only was able to play post ZG in vanilla and I really find all the new things people found/are finding really interesting.
---
I will, I experienced most of vanilla (my guild was 12/15 in Naxx) as a holy pala and my dream for classic is to progress raid as a ret. I'm surprised by how much people already explored the matter on the private servers over the years and the dps numbers are honestly above my expectations. Ret was always my preferred spec, in TBC I left my guild with which I've been since the beginning of vanilla, because another guild would allow me to raid as ret, but even with my passion for the spec I just accepted, that it wasn't raid viable in vanilla. 
---
As the people today have shown ret is perfectly viable in a raid, sure it has among the lowest ceilings, but the numbers I've seen people pull are perfectly in line with a top 10 dps in my days in vanilla, so it really isn't such a big detriment, yet I still get blocked by most people, because of "no rets in our raid" or my spec choice is acceptable, but not taken seriously. Sometimes I feel, people think you need everybody to pull 300 dps on rag to kill him or soemthing like that, when in reality we killed him with perhaps 3000 dps between the entire raid. Or even stat checks like Patchwerk, people seem to think everybody needs 600+ dps to kill him, but we did with only the top 8 or so reaching the that. 
---
&gt; The highest ceiling is hunter imo, its the most rotation specific,
---
Hunter is a class I never got behind (the pet classes just aren't my cup of tea). But this opinion intrigues me, as I always felt hunters were pretty crappy apart from kiting mobs and tranq shot. Why do you think they have the highest ceiling? What pet and rotation should they use to reach that ceiling?
---
All the more reason they should include an RP-PVP server at launch.
---
Do you not know how priests leveled in Vanilla (not just private server, but original vanilla) and will level in Classic? That’s literally just PWS yourself, mind blast, swp, then wand. Not joking, not being hyperbolic.
---
A few more beefy mobs might require you to snack it with a smite or two thrown in. But not many will require this.
---
This is how/why priests are the class with the least downtime while leveling. They aren’t the fastest, since we wand, but are the most consistent.
---
So kindly shove it out your ass.
---
Why do clueless people always feel required to comment?
---
Twinking may have started with pubstomping intentions in 2005, but by the time cross-realm bgs came out the 19 bracket was premade focused. Entire guilds would transfer battlegroups to play against the best [premades](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V85tzGg7gTo). 
---
Twinking is good for those who don't have time to sit in bgs farming rank 14/grinding raids yet still want competitive games. There's a reason the scene blew up late vanilla/TBC with cross-realm premades and eventually Arenas. Neither of those had anything to do with killing undergeared levelers all day. 
---
Twinking died with 450 professions in wrath, BoA gear, and as we all know the game just becoming bad.

Don't have WOW, never played WOW, just sorted popular by controversial. Reading this thread has given me almost 0 understanding of anything either side is arguing for.

BC was still awesome but introduced a lot of shit and was in my opinion already way worse than vanilla
---
Druids can be true hybrids when you get to aq40, you can tank some and then get to dispelling, healing.  
---
You can do that a paladin but you lose a lot more than a druid would lose and you need to be able to switch gear everytime (not in combat lol).  
---
The biggest problem I would say is the gear checks, classic is all about gear checks in PvE, PvP is a whole another thing.
---
Really hoping they fix this.
---
This has been subject of debate in different threads and I personally have no beta access but been following the debate and believe there to be a bug/oversight in the beta client.
---
This melee leeway apparently was introduced in WoD and since the beta client is infact built upon WoD patch architecture, this is likely a leftover/behavior that flew under the radar.
---
And no matter how much people defend that this was in Vanilla, no it was not. This kind of leeway was added for spells but not for melee attacks of mobs nor players. This also has nothing to do with Tauren racial attack range. This is a bug.
---
Yeah they were best in slot until season 3 came out. By the time most people got them though, season 2 was coming to and end.
---
&gt; healing-touch crazy mana-efficient

Do you know what rank is most mana efficient ? 4 ? 3 ?

---
Well I'll have the chicken then
---
Well said. My point wasn't to focus on the griefing but more on the fact that \*we\* as a community have moved on. Now, coming back to it after so long, I had just ASSUMED I'd be PVP and 'live with it' but it was a revelation to realize, no, wait, I \*could\* do PVE! 
---
My 'prediction' is really just the realization that many folks are likely coming to the same conclusion. PVE, today, will represent more of the game you want to remember. You'll have all of the PVP goodness you want in BG.
---
Will lots of people roll PVP out of inertia? Likely.  My point is that I won't be surprised if many who rolled PVP will choose PVE.
---
Well, obviously judging the current situation correctly is required to make such decisions properly.
---
If I don't know the current encounter, I'd rather play it save and top people up. But If I know the encounter then I also know whether to expect damage or not.
---
Beein OOM before the boss is dead also makes it more likely that someone whill die. So the whole business of healing consists of properly weighing the pros and cons of different courses of action and that's basically what makes it fun and engaging.
---
Your guild is probably gonna thing its hilarious haha go for it owo

I wouldnt be happy at all. TBC was worse than vanilla and Wotlk was way worse than TBC.

Loot matters again, quests are rewarding, theres always a cool skill/talent to shoot for, you are not a god that can pull 10 mobs at once, I am a weak little shaman in a vast dangerous world. Its so damn refreshing.
---
It's that pinkish area in the middle of the bar. You can clip your auto if you cast multi shot in there. I made an update to make that area just a single line because it was really confusing, now it's only somewhat confusing.
---
Yes I also remember threat being the limiting factor for a lot of classes. Rogues may not be the best example since they have both feint and vanish but threat wise hunters are very strong like you said. I wouldn't take the risk stacking fury warriors in Classic.
---
Well the classic one does seem shorter than the other. 
---
But I could be wrong. Would Need better screenshots.
---
Why do you assume Blizzard is lying about the reference Client then? :D That is a larger accusement. Can't everyone make a mistake and give wrong information sometimes?

I think Classic could really kill BfA (but mostly because BfA is utter crap). The player base for BfA is already too small. Two sundays in a row, I've looked for a raid to gear my alt. Sunday afternoon. Many people should play, normally. There wasn't even one normal pug raid in the tool. My guild mates wait several hours for a tank in a 5-man group. If the player base drops further, it will be disaster for retail.
---
Classic doesnt have to kill retail because retail keeps killing itself
---
I laughed.

The issue you'll run into with warrior is *kind of* similar, to be honest.
---
You'll have a hard time PvP'ing as a Protection or Fury Warrior.
---
You'll also have a hard time finding a raid group as an arms warrior. 
---
If you want to PvE and PvP both at a high level with the same spec (that doesn't involve healing), I would recommend going Hunter, Rogue, Warlock, or Mage.

I'll take a slice of this cake too then.

I would add an elemental shaman and even an enhanced shaman
---
I'd actually need to look up the cast-time's.
---
Was Rank 3 already the maximum-cast-time of 3.5 without talents?
---
I think the first rank with the full cast-time was the most mana-efficient once you had some healing-bonus on your gear. Without healing-bonus the highest rank was the most mana-efficient.
---
Most will quit. Those who know from the beginning what they are doing won't. People aiming for server firsts "suddenly realizing" that they don't progress fast enough and quitting - not going to happen.

Maybe you're right and wPvP ranking won't even be too popular. We'll see.

---
Mage pvp will be quite a different story though. Probably need to have like 15-20 stuff on bind including trinkets, managems and so on.
---
to actually raid in naxx you should be playing like 6 - 8 hours a day, so you can farm what is needed and get ready to do it, pservers had the dynamic respawn timers, so lets say black lotus had 5 min timer to respawn, in classic if they are not changing the timers it should be 2 hours. Resources farm will be more competitive, so get ready to spend more time online to get a chance to get those stuff that would greatly help your raiding experience.  
---
If you have written on paper what you will do every second online to only need to play like 4 - 5 hours a day but this will become a chore and won't be "fun".  
---
Oh and raiding naxx will take you like 4 hours, if your guild is those top end guilds it will take half the time tho.  
---
Casual guilds will not clear naxx btw, so if you are planning to playing in a casual guild don't even worry...
---

Judging by the direction the lore is heading, some catastrophe shattering Azeroth and the Factions breaking apart is a possibility, which is a perfect excuse for Blizzard to shut WoW down and make way for WoW 2.

Wait. Are you telling this guy to just rape his SO?

Looks fairly low end, but compared to the potatoes we ran vanilla on, should be fine
---
You make an assumption that retail players are all one way. No. This subreddit paints retail players with one broad stroke, as lazy and wanting free epics and uninterested in working for their gear...when the truth is, most are somewhere in between “1.12 with its broken class balance” and “BfA with its handout epics and WoD with its garrison mini game” . A lot of us want a game that looks like BfA but feels more like Classic. And as such, we will play both. 
---
They’re on one subscription so the success of one won’t harm the other. In fact it will provide valuable feedback. Blizzard spent too long listening to a vocal minority on forums and Reddit. When they see in a year classic vs retail player engagement, they’ll know what people actually want.
---
from a financial standpoint, it would be the reasonable decision for activision, more complete databases or saved old clients to develeop the other expasions too at minimal cost. makes more sense to bring back hyped content instead of developing classic further after naxx. (more sense for greed driven shareholders and dont you all have mobile phones "blizzard" that is)

It will happen more often on the streamer's servers, because they, as streamers have a need to create engaging and interesting content to their audience.

So they'll organize invasions, dueling tournaments, "kill the general" events etc...

Of course, it's not exclusive to the streamer's servers, but it'll happen much more often there

"Will this be fine for running classic wow?"

What is your definition of running? 60 FPS @ 1920? 1440p? 4K? 120hz? 144hz? 240hz? Certain amount of FPS in raids? Doesnt matter?
---
There are alot more to it than just running.

Not cool because you didn't include tanking as an option. All the tank girls are crying now, trying to hook up with you, but realizing you don't want a tank partner.

Anything is possible if there is enough money in it.  However, there are a few reasons why I don't think it will happen.  First and most importantly, I personally do not believe that vanilla will be that popular after the first 6 months.  Beyond that, the player base will steadily decline.  And there are many reasons to this also.  The nostalgia/casual people coming back won't stick for the long term.  Casual sells and vanilla isn't a casual friendly game.  The nostalgia folks will come for the old school fix but aren't like to stay beyond their initial sub.  Retail players will check out the hype, but they will run back to retail.  Again, casual sells.  There is a reason why casual mmos are not successful than hardcore ones.  When its all said and done and the hype explosion is over, vanilla will have tis steady core, but it won't be enough.
---
2ndly, Blizzard doesn't want vanilla to be bigger than retail.  Retail is more profitable.  IF vanilla does somehow become larger than retail, then slowly they will begin to add things that people don't want in vanilla.  Because if they aren't making money off the store in retail, trust they will being the store to vanilla.  In which, we would see all sorts of random account unlocks like pay money to have dual specs, or boost, or added mount speed... random shit that will make them money and turn vanilla is something you hate.  If vanilla became more popular, don't think for a second that they would just leave it alone and not try to milk as much money as they can from it.
---
And lastly: it would saturate the player base.  And really, do we really need 4 versions of wow?  No we don't.  Its too much and it won't make them as much money as people think it will in the long run.
---
I'm in STRONG agreement with literally everything 'Feral\_Meows' wrote. Well played, Mike. 'TheRealRecollector' could learn a thing or two from you. :b

You are still fighting mobs several levels higher than you, with chances to miss, resist etc. Even with BiS gear for a 40, their gear is on the low end for something like ST. I would never try to do ST at 40, even with BiS gear unless it was with solid guildies who I trust and going in I know that everyone will be willing to "chew glass" and stick it out to the end.

I'm more afraid of mount on 1, nothing else bound to any key.
---
It's 3 hunter spells because of how the hunter cast bar had to work, all of the settings text, the greeting, about 10 or so sentences in the .toc file, and main-hand/off-hand.
---
I made a script that takes in a file of sentences l, converts them using Google Translate, and dumps them into a localization file. Now Google Translate isn't the best so if people want to fix it's mistakes then I'm all for it.
---
I'm working on a fix for spell casters so I'll see if I can roll this into that.
---
Classic WoW is WoW.  You'll use same client and it'll just be another account on your list.
---
A toaster can run Classic WoW
---
Hopefully the issue has been reported on the classic forums. This is a huge issue.
---
No they wont, the only thing they're offering is server transfer. Thats it.

Does it feel bad to parrot phrases such as "oh you sweet summer child?"

&gt; Not true, the human racial of 5% spirit gives a tangible healing performance boost - both for the mana and also the +healing from Spiritual Guidance.
---
No it doesn't.
---
Even if you have 300 spirit (which is honestly a lot), that's 15 extra spirit, and a whopping +3.75 healing from Spiritual Guidance.
---
That's so small that you can't even notice it.

And my... bow?

If you try writing in "chapeau" in google translate you should have the option to have the computer read it out loud for you. If you've set the language to french, you'll get the right pronunciation.

That is true!
---
He wants to tank though, which means Axe skill is not as big a deal as for DPS. A ton of tank weapons are swords, not just TF. He also can't use Blood Fury. Hardiness vs. WotF is going to be pretty situational in PvE, avoiding fear without having to stance dance is pretty nice, and occasionally avoiding a stun will be useful. 
---
Horde tank racials are what racials should actually be like - minor situational advantages. War stomp is great for dealing with large numbers of adds, bit of HP never hurts. Trolls can get decent threat from berserking and the HP regen adds threat. But it's not like Alliance where Human completely trumps everything for both DPS and tanking.
---
Holy shit, this is blasphemy.
---
Get the pitchforks ready, guys!!
---
First off, like the other poster replied you conveyed your point extremely well.
---
Secondly, I have been studying network engineering and honestly find the figure a bit low. I trust in Blizzard assessment here, but considering the average online player amount of Vanilla time servers was around 3k people, for which to my understanding the servers were built for. Modern times it has been surprisingly much the same figure from what I have read, only slightly higher.
---
But even if they would go with aiming for the 3k players online average, the amount in beta is surprisingly low considering you could see buggy behavior with higher server load average that does not raise its head currently. Dunno :)
---
server transfer yes, race change/appearence change - no chance
---
The same goes for me, just do both. 
---
I have my full tryhard days in which I pre plan my goals on what to do, which quests/level I do for the day. If it stresses me out to much, I just take a chill day for exploring fishing/proffessions and stuff. Enjoy your ride while it lasts ;)
---
Lol nice.
---
But a PC with enough slots to hold 512 sticks? Woah! ;)
---
You should play pally. lol  
---
Dwarf if better in all aspects if you want to be pally. PvE, PvP, every-thing.  
---
You can go Human male if you like the looks, but dwarf is better.
---
Then you can just stay in Classic servers. No one is forcing you to move to BC or Wotlk server. There are people out there who rather want to play BC or Wotlk instead of staying Classic server forever.
---
Some of my favorite memories of leveling are SM. So sad when I found out they changed it.
---
If they do a TBC server i hope that it won't be from start in the latest patch.
---
Especially when you look at 2.3. Before this patch, yes, it's Vanilla perfected in some points.
---
Ofc if they do it MUST be separate from Vanilla
---
Lets hope not. It's kind of important for the server identity to not have people transfer all over the place. However due to cross-relm battlegrounds, this is already going to take a hit ..
---
&gt; and no paid mounts 
---
I really think that mounts are the least of the problem, as you need to pay gold for the skills to ride them anyway.
---
Haha same. Bought a cheap e-machine, upgraded ram, and eventually got a graphics card. That thing kicked ass for about 5 years before it kicked the bucket.
---
Yep. I've been pretty much everywhere aswell. Hyjal, IF Landing, outside of every instance that allowed it etc.
---
My biggest achievement was probably getting to GM island back in early TBC when it was on the same map as Kalimdor.
---
halls of the skanks
---
Probably because people are not capped at level 40 on live servers, so nobody is grinding level 40 BiS and even if they did they would probably be closer to 45 or higher. What you are seeing is what happens when level 40 is endgame.
---
It took the first guilds 3 hours after launch to down him on private servers... You guys have to take into account that people know all the strategies, ESPECIALLY the elite guilds.

All of the classes had far more viable abilities at their disposal. Mages are the best example since spell types weren't locked out. Even the DPS classes who could function perfectly if played with an xbox controller still had a lot of crafty utility options. Classic wasn't over complex, but it was far above what exists now. Even the classes that have other abilities outside of their core don't generally need them.
---
I don't know what it was but I preferred the EQ2 Crossroads in the Commonlands.

https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/30-year-old-boomer
---
You mean I can’t ninja loot stuff then get a name change?
---
Fixed in retail.
---
This post, and many...MANY others like this one, is what is going to be the deathblow to Retail after Classic launches.
---
Retail players will migrate in DROVES to Classic. I don't think that (except top hardcore guilds) raiding will be a thing in Retail after Classic launches, for the vast majority of guilds.
---
The COMMUNITY aspect is what will impact Retail. Friendships will either be lost, or entire groups of friends will move to Classic...because the community exists ONLY in Classic. There won't be a reverse process.
---
Classic will probably launch with 6-7 million players, and will retain half of them 1 year down the road. Retail will simply be a ghost town...I think more than half of current Retail players will FULLY switch to Classic, or they will spend most of their game time in Classic.
---
Retail players REALLY don't see what is coming...somehow I am sorry for them, but this is how things work. Retail MUST either die, and a WoW2 to be launched, either be DRASTICALLY reformed and redesigned.
---
And this can only happen if Classic is a major success...which it WILL be. If there was any doubt before that Classic will simply blow Retail out of the water, now it's almost crystal clear that this will happen.
---
Yep!
---
They won't have any store available on launch.  But trust that if vanilla is popular enough and people aren't spending money on retail anymore, then the store will eventually make its way to classic.  However, it is unlikely we ever get to that point.
---
A player in full PvP gear wouldn't have the slightest chance to compete against a PvE geared player DPS wise. Stop making up this garbage. Compare the items yourself end tell me in which world a rogue could reach the hitcap in full PvP gear. Just because PvP items have stats and are purple it doesn't make them as good as PvE items. Only the weapons were good, for some classes slightly better than the PvE counterparts. The other way around players with T5 gear had a huge advantage against PvP players in the arena who only had access to Season 1. I still wait that you name me the PvP items that were better than their PvE counterparts besides weapons. I feel bad for your Raidlead if you really had players that raided in full PvP gear. Could be the reason why people think TBC was so hard.
---
Lol What did I say that was remotely "hyper-defensive"?  
---
I mean, I kind of get it.  You're one of those emotionally retarded people where whenever anyone disagrees with you, they must be *that horrible kind of person*.  I thought that a streamer's group killing a boss in a dungeon ten levels higher than him was mildly impressive.  Even though I don't really care about streamers, in your eyes I must be streamer fanboy because that's the only way *anyone* would say something *remotely* positive about something one of them did.
---
Have you ever considered a therapist?
---
&gt; rarely sustain it
---
Wait what? DPS implies sustained damage, not the top damage you can record in a few seconds at some point in a fight. 
---
Why does it seem like people stating numbers for Vanilla are speaking in another language? What is the sustained DPS that classes did for long term raid fights counting the very beginning to the very end, not just burst sessions?
---
Did you take the gnome picture from a pserver?
---
Apparently there's actually a size modifer for gnomes only that pservers hadn't used. No idea why, but if you go on a TBC server gnomes are classic beta sized again.
---
But with improved overpower you can pretty reliably keep deep wounds up. So it's a 20% do increase overall, very difficult to get that with 3 talent points
---
I'm one of those people. That's why I'm telling you that people will not stick around without any new content after Naxx.
---
Now with mechnical keyboards we dont even need to spam the key anymore. Just press 1 and watch some tv.
---
The absolute best site to find helpful tips and advice for all your favorite games!
---
meanwhile on the beta i routinely cross people of other faction without either side engaging eachother, even in contested area, cause WPvP is a chore when you are trying to level up.
---
Classic is running the retail client so if you cant run retail youre going to also be unable to run vanilla
---
Hey man I think we might be a good a good fit for you.   [Blood Shot Eyes Discord](https://discord.gg/CWxJvGd) Stop by our discord.
---
are you dumb? lol holy shit
---
This is due to spellbatching as it also counts melee swings, as spellbatching seems longer then orginal vanilla this is the result.
---
Some dude added me and called me by my real name and said ”f***ing k y s” after I killed him, he was lvls above me too.
---
People will be able to do that in classic too, I suppose
---
Kinda unsettling
---
Make drink water a very easy to hit keybind when leveling, and as others said finish the last bit of mob hp with a wand
---
holy shit that was hilarious
---
What are you doing blackfathom depths for at 40?
---
Ok got it.  Don't like something... Boomer.  That's some quantum level insults going on.
---
It’s really not that big of a deal for rogues.
---
"we'll see"
---
Sure. If we didn't have a decade+ of Vanilla server launches with gated content to use as a metric.
---
But we do. So I'm not ignoring precedent.
---
Sky ain't gonna fall, my dude.
---
Spellbatching is a separate issue. This happens even if two targets are moving at the same speed at a constant distance - it has nothing to do with timing or spellbatching.
---
My questions is not about "emulating streamers" its about whether or not speed leveling is necessary to enjoy the game to its fullest, not sure whats so hard to understand? 
---
Is a simple question.
---
Pvp servers are generally more popular yes. And raiding is also equally popular on pvp servers! Pve is just for people who don't like to be killed/fight out in the world.
---
You also realize that those fused wirings will increase in price over time. You farm these for a level or two and your bank will be filled with an appreciating asset that you can sell once the server develops.
---
Hell no. We lost in 7 to them off a fluke shot.
---
What they are doing now makes us look good.
---
Probably not that great. APUs aren't great for gaming.
---
Lol how are mages broken?
---
That is purely anecdotal, and provides no real evidence.
---
can we have a barber shop at least?
---
Paladin
---
I don't think they caught that you're focusing on tanking. Horde race choice really doesn't matter for tanking, the differences are absurdly tiny.
---
client doesn't mean art asset.
---

---
Thankss!!

Another 100% serious post made by someone being 100% serious.

Holy nice shit post
---
Be careful, some of the comments here suggest that classic will run on old settings like private servers do.  
---
However, truth is you would need a relatively ok pc if you are keen to raid with 40 others or do serious pvp  
---
The one you posted is fine but do not be mistaken that even a 15 years old pc will run smoothly. This is because essentially we will use the BFA set-up which means new graphics and a bit more pressure on cpu and ram for high population instances like world pvp and raids.
---
The winner makes the rules.
---
Yeah, my frustrations with retail were definitely leaking through there. I don't inherently have a problem with retail, it's a decent game in its own right. I'm still bitter that rather than launch WoW:Raidfinder Edition they killed off the MMO we loved in order to use that existing population to launch what amounts to a totally different game.
---
My best friend is tanking...we don't need two tanks and bro's before hoes.
---
&gt; Then it just snowballs from there and eventually even people who were reluctant to play it will try it because it's the thing that everyone is doing. 
---
This will 100% happen. What is unknown is how BIG this effect will be. I am expecting roughly 30% to 50% of the current BfA players to play Classic as their main game. Sure, not overnight, but I think that October 2019 is going to be the month when Retail dies...in terms of active players, not being shutdown.
---
Maybe it's just different mentalities now, different players. That will suck if it's the case
---
So you are calling yourself perfect?  Smooth move, Jay26 is the new legend27
---
worse for other classes
---
Give it time.  I mean, assuming it hasn't already been done yet.  There's a good chance it has, considering that searching "warcraft" on a certain video site turns up an alarming number of hits.  Good luck sifting through them all, though.
---
HEAL THE GRAYRAGE, THEYRE ALL TARGETING ME! I wish I could find that soundboard...
---
it'll be Jay27 in a month.
---
I’m so excited too! It’s going to be great!

Ask her if she'd like to try it with you. Fingers crossed that she loves it as much as many of us when we tried it the first time. Then you can be addicted together! Good luck.
---
Not at all. Give it a try sometime.

I would watch this over and over.
---
REAL QUESTION; WILL TAUREN BEAR SIZE FOR DRUID BE NORMAL a.k.a. BIG or scaled down like the private server trash change where they make it extra small
---
First half of your reply was completely unnecessary though.
---
&gt; The amount of gold was balanced around the fact that you could only do them once a day.
---
They artificially constructed a problem (these quests give too much money) and then solved that problem with making them only available once a day? Come on, that's not an argument. (It also isn't one for making grind so tedious that people rather buy loot boxes, another way of constructing a problem and then "selling" a solution, that helps the developer (WoW: they need to make less fresh content by slowing hard core players down and make a game "look" more active while the players actually do not have fun but do chores, other games: they make money through selling loot boxes).
---
&gt; It also gavd people a reason to log in and made the world more active.
---
It **forced** you to log in if you wanted to keep up with anyone else. Yes it made the world more active, by making more people doing chores just to keep up. Daily quests was what you did immediately after log in so you would have done them as fast as possible, so you could do the things you really wanted to do... No one, really no one with a clear mind wanted to do them because of how much fun they were, be at least honest about that.
---
&gt; You could still do daily quests twice a week and get your rewards later.
---
Or I could look at this, shake my head and quit, because it is no fun to realize that a developer forces me to log in daily or luck out. I couldn't even get the best ammunition for my hunter until the next expansion where it was worthless...
---
Someone said it best:
---
"It's not a little "thank you" for playing each day, it's clocking in for work so that you can have fun later."
---
I want WoW and other games to take a step back from that game mechanic. In Pandaria even the most hardcore daily quest farmers were screaming to Blizzard to stop it and so they had to backpaddle it at least a bit. 
---
TBC started it and I am just glad it is not much of a part in Classic. If it will be a part in an TBC Classic, I will most likely drop the mouse on it again and play something else.
---
Tbh no one plays AV unless it AV weekend and even then everyone just premade zergs it for fast honour and rep anyways
---
Just....no!
---
Bingo. The beta is pretty unique in what people were invited, its purpose and the overall vibe. It will turn into a bloodbath come release.
---
You're crazy friend, why does it matter if she logs into retail or league of legends or literally any other game you can play on a pc. She can't play classic if she's getting ganked non stop, so she plays something else, pretty simple.
---
Depends, if there's someone who is just as dedicated and less awful then he won't be getting it. Rank counts your points per week against the points of other players on your faction. If you lose 20h per day you might still get less points than someone steamrolling everyone in his premade for 14h a day.
---
just like all the other abilities listed, its only in classic!
---
I remember when BC was actually out and how much people used to shit on it.
---
I think a lot of people are in this same boat right now.  Most people played this game when they had time but no money and now they have money but no time.  I'm planning to find time to play it but my friends all say they wont be raiding.  Personally, I'm convinced that we're going to be doing all kinds of shit they didn't expect and I'm hoping that they'll get back into the groove once they realize the game takes a lot less time the second time around.
---
Ironforge was where it's at.
---
Flexxing on the pillars of the bridge with your new items or mount was always fun.
---
I'm sorry but the pathing : [https://youtu.be/79RqTEmUjLI?t=131](https://youtu.be/79RqTEmUjLI?t=131) on Hydrospawn is really really stupid.
---
It's like a bug.
---
You had to lag out your client for that, right? I never tried that.
---
i heard that they are open for it, if classic is holding it's own. they would release tbc and even wotlk.
---
Eh? Not really. Game seems to be doing fine, once everyone got the doomsaying out of their system. Slow updates aren't really the death of a good game--if they were, I feel like vanilla private servers wouldn't have survived existing for over a decade, doing the same stuff over and over again.
---
if they have retail, classic, and tbc that would be aweful the player base would be spread too thin
---
I built mine for about 750 and it'll tear through most of the newer games. I would highly recommend building rather than buying. It's cheaper
---
He said “one of”
---
I got all A's in my online courses my final semester during TBC and played a LOT more than 5 hours a day.
---
Well, give one.
---
This! :D awesome video! Now I’m even more hyped about it haha 😂
---
Why do you say “we want”, when you have no substantial evidence to back it up past your own opinion?
---
retail WoW has been dead since cata, so that answers your question
---
It doesn’t necessarily only apply to amount of time played.  By your personal definition as long as I kill heroic raid bosses  in 9 hours or less every week I would still be casual.
---
I would argue you could easily be casual and still play 20+ hours a week.  You can have a lot of free time to play, but your end game due to skill or effort might be Alterac Valley.  Or you have 15 characters across 3 realms but none are over  level 40.  Or you are in a raid guild as friends and family and you just enjoy the social aspect and help out by farming for potions for the raiders or something.
---
There are so many ways to enjoy the game, and I certainly don’t consider casual a derogatory term in wow since probably 90% of the players would be considered casual.  Its a lot easier to define hardcore imo, min max pvpers and progression raiders who put winning and progress over everything else.  Also not a bad thing at all, just different strokes.

Makes sense, and good to have it there! Thanks for clarifying.

17? damn when did you start, our monday post here seems pretty dead :(
---
Dying.. psh

It’s the U Got That music video with anime girls and Ricardo.  
---
I’ll let you decide if your boss wants to see you looking at 2D women with psychopathic expressions.
---
I'm someone who prefers BC over vanilla, but I'd still rather let Classic run through all of its phases before considering what happens next.
---
Not going to happen.
---
If you can't see yourself playing WoW classic in 2 years, well, maybe classic isn't for you? 
---
Your plan would split up the playerbase immensely and Blizz would have to maintain 3 different game states which they already stated they don't want to do.
---
I just want classic. Couldn’t care less about BC or wrath 🤷🏾‍♀️
---
I have the numbers to back it up. More players played BC than Vanilla, and more players played Wrath than BC
---
This has to be the most entitled thing I've ever seen spoken on the internet.
---
23k? Nice cherry pick. It appears your nervous that retail wow is coming to an end.
---
It’s not the gear - it’s the principle. Get rid of that shitty habit early.
---
It’s actually starting from a discord I’ve been moderating for a few years. So it’s a lot of people I’ve k ken for a while.
---
Nice. I’m not looking to run insane graphics, I just want 60+ FPS and I’m happy
---
Yeah, like that is any kind of indication for your propsed "plan".
---
I think they will want to see how successful the Classic servers are before they do anything. What if these servers are ghost towns 6 months after launch? You really think they are going to throw money at BC?
---
&gt; But they do not keep servers open for all time when that population is only going to dwindle 
---
Maybe not, but they can merge them if they're absolutely dead after a while. "Pure" servers. That way you still have that character on a version of the game that doesn't include New Game+ bullshit that many people don't want. They absolutely will not remove the ability to play Classic, even if they add BC servers, fresh servers, 1.14 servers or whatever.
---
Good point
---
They are absurd, rhetorical questions that should frame your concerns in an appropriate light. 
---
Level as you see fit and you'll have fun. If you have to PUSH yourself super hard, you could burn out easily. You might not even GET to 60. There are advantages to getting 60 early - if you want those I can lay them out.
---
By fine I’m looking for good FPS. Graphics don’t mean that much just want decent frames in dungeons and raids
---
Is this a clever use of mechanics or an exploit bug ?
---
This is amazing, are you considering taking outside submissions?
---
And they can still get a Druid following them stealthed.
---
&gt;Shadowpriest is not a class
---
Shadowpriests are monsters in pvp.
---
5 man could easily cc her though
---
Classic is harder by definition because it requires more effort and endurance (time) to achieve the same task. I’m talking leveling, farming, getting gold, gear etc. that’s not to say I view that as a problem. Its this whole debate about the word harder as if it hurt ones pride.
---
And in my time in classic, I’ve literally never played a character that it was one ability used and no others. I feel like that’s an over simplification.
---
"soda plans to do MC in the 2nd week of launch."
---
LOOOOOOOOOOL
---
Best bear wouldn't trade.
---
Yes. I used to disable them when heading north
---
It’s not an purely anecdotal is the same anecdote is being repeated over and over again on the forums. The active player base for retail has been decimated over the past 6 months.
---
I always hung out in either IF or SW back in Vanilla.
---
This time around Ill be hanging in the tram between the two mostly. Waiting to gank someone who is tagged!
---
How can you possibly objectify how long learning takes. It's so different depending on what you're learning
---
Not really, hamstring kiting has always been a niche technique.
---
World pvp in retail is a joke now. I saw a group of 5 allies doing world quests in legion while I was on my bear. I engaged them alone just to see how I would do against them. Out of the 5 of them, I got 8 kills before they killed me
---
Well after BWL I am planning on re-rolling as a blood elf dwarf.
---
Brave browser is awesome, it has all of that integrated from the get go
---
I really do not like the factions communicating so easily.
---
Ka'anu Reevs?
---
heirlooms killed the game and world pvp, change my mind
---
Hardcore PvP I guess.
---
How is it a burden? Deep wounds is a low priority debuff so it's what gets pushed off first when target hits debuff limit
---
For PvE: A lot of their dps is tied into pet dmg, and keeping a pet alive in a raid is actually realy very hard. You have to know exactly when to pull them back so they don't get recked by an AoE move, and when its time for them to die as healing them and keeping them up would be less efficient than spending the rest of your mana/time (its a channel spell in vanilla) on bow/gun dps. If you have a guild that'll heal the hunter pets, ive seen some pocket healers for the lock groups spend some time on hunter pets too when bored, its a bit easier, but the mana efficiency is still the most important thing to their dps.
---
For PvP: They have a retaliation for everything it seemes, the "we do everything, but don't do anything the best," a really good Hunter can win almost any 1v1. They have the most CC out of any class, and do good burst dmg, that is so nessesary for PvP, (they just can sustain it in PvE) Theyre very like Enh Shamans, they can absolutly destroy you quickly but they can outlast anything.
---
You will get to know who are the good handful of Hunters if you pvp a lot, thats where they will set themselves apart. Most people from my expereince who played hunter sat in PvP spec until they got  [https://classicdb.ch/?item=19406](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19406) DFT, as the change in dps was not perceieved as worth the money.
---
More players played those games because not many people heard of WoW and also in  a lot of cases their PCs and/or their internet could not handle the game. More subscribers does not equal better game.
---
I was with you until the “participation medal” stuff.
---
Haha hey, how’s it goin. Yeah, me and Phireant. I mainly ran an Orc Shaman and Human Fury Warrior. He did an Orc Warrior Tank and Human Rogue.

I think the farthest we made it was about half way through OG Naxx.

I was playing a Korean MMO back in 2003, along with 15-16 IRL friends. In 2005, WoW was launched in EU, and one by one, everyone of my friends moved to WoW. It only took ONE of them to drag 15 people from an MMO to another.
---
I was stubborn, I had invested too much in that Korean MMO, and I was the LAST one to leave. I didn't liked Vanilla graphics, I didn't liked the characters design, I didn't liked the slow pace.

BUT, since I was basically left alone in that Korean MMO, and all my friends moved to WoW...I was willing to give it a shot. I was 100% SURE that I won't like it, and will go back to my initial MMO.
---
How WRONG I was...everything that I didn't liked before became IRRELEVANT. My friends were there...AND A LOT of other people. So many people...The game was extremely popular, my friends were there...and pretty much everyone else was friendly.
---
My fear of letting go of my 2 year+ old MMO for a newer one simply vanished. I realized that this new MMO is VASTLY superior, and even with lower graphics and weird characters, the community was the main drive for me to just LET GO of 2 years+ of commitment on another MMO.
---
If stubborn guy like me was able to let go, I am sure a lot of people will do the same for Classic. There is simply no way that MANY retail players will "see the light". Not all, ofc, but many will.
---
Is it funny ?
---
Yikes..... They cant just release BC or Wrath lol.
---
Even though its a version of the old game, the client has changed a ton in the recent years meaning that they have to re implement the DBs to the new client for each iteration of the game. You're looking at 1-2 years for each expansions re-release AFTER they start working on it. 
---
This isn't going to happen and you need to get this out of your head real quick unless you want to be extremely disappointed. 
---
Sure some people want BC and wrath but I dont think ANYONE but you believes its a possibility before Naxx is finished.
---
Any kiting class tbh
---
LMAO.
---
Well so far mages are destroying instances with their aoe and utility. Don’t even need a tank just 3 mages a lock and a healer to mass pull like 20+ mobs at a time.
---
Well, if all those players would leave for BC, they'd likely leave without BC too as it implies they will tire of classic. So the players that want to keep playing classic in perpetuity will lose those players regardless.
---
Tell me he was an [orc](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=otCpCn0l4Wo).
---
Yes they were
---
No its just something younger people can say to trigger older people and clearly it works.  Its a simple joke about being out of touch with the times, its been pretty popular on this subreddit specifically.
---
Might as well add custom skins and transmogs there.
---
The look of your mount in vanilla is a status symbol, not a symbol of your wallet size, but your time and dedication to the game. 
---
Transmogs, paid mounts and skins of this sort is the bane of customisation with meaning. Meaning gets lost when you don't feel a strong investment in your looks. 
---
I don't have a study for it, but I'd hypothesize that a player would be less invested in the players in-game cosmetics if these were purchased with outside currency not related to the game, rather than earned ingame.
---
Priest are biests at lvl 19! 
---
I always had a rogue too at lvl 29! Poisons were crucial!
---
They also said thattheywere not going to bring Classic back. Who knows what the future will bring?
---
Original AV did not feel good to me. I’m glad it’s the 1.12 version. Korak was cool, but the rest of the stuff was beyond tedious.
---
They already have the tech for it because they are able to release Classic. They don't need to reinvent the wheel twice.
---
Very true. They have so many tools compared to everyone else. Especially against warriors..there's literally no way a mage with a brain can lose to a warrior 1v1. Keep the leeway. No big deal
---
I farted once on the set of Blue Lagoon!
---
Orc - Lock may be very strong if spimp spec is manageable in classic
---
This has absolutely nothing to do with spell batching.
---
the pc wont have any issues, it may can happen that huge effects like 40 man raids fighting can lower the fps. 
---
imo most important is, that you concider getting the biggest bang for your buck. so whats the price of this one? 
---
if you are willing i can also can customize you one. but you need to build it by yourself. dont be worried, with sone yt help its super easy, it's like building lego in expensive mode
---
Ironforge. Always.
---
Yeah, no, leave me out of this "we". I'm fine with Classic, and if Blizz wants to add content beyond that, my vote goes against "No Changes" this time around.
---
As much as I welcome TBC and more after classic, I want them to be separate servers. Regardless whether classic exist forever or players leave for TBC expansion, Classics's active playerbase will dwindle to unhealthly numbers but that's okay. The best solution that I can think of is:
---
Instead of forking off on new servers with copied characters for TBC and beyond, Blizzard should open "museum" where players can preserve and play their classic characters indefinitely. This could combine numerous servers into just 1, or very few, "museum" servers. Now sure this server would be quite dead, but at that point, you prolly don't have much to do anyway. The main purpose if having an option to go back and reminisce about your characters. 
---
And if you want an active community to always play in, then that's where TBC and beyond comes in to play, but why stop there. They could also roll out custom server projects, even if temporary or seasonal. And they could also do anual/seasonal Classic reboots as well.
---
It's not AWFUL, but it really is 6 talent points because it forces you to take rend talents. It also doesn't take attack power into consideration as far as I know based on the tooltip.
---
The lost opportunity cost is that you lose 25% damage (which as far as I know does benefit from attack power) of enrage. Mobs have 5% crit chance against you. And you lose 30% dps increase of flurry.
---
Taking all that into consideration I would rate it overall worse. Would you disagree, am I missing something?
---
So I guess in classic it will be old farts (horde) vs. middle aged men (ally).
---
You’re not getting tbc or Wrath.
---
Best idea i can give you is  
---
Level up to 10 on seperate zones.  
---
For him he is at dwarf starting zone and you are at human starting zone.  
---
And once you both around 11-12 you'll probably finish your both starting zones. From there, he can take the tram to stormwind. Meet you there and you guys can go to Westfall from there. Thats Human's 10-20 zone.  
---
Big chance it will be overcrowded in launch.  
---
Or you can take the tram to ironforge and meet him there. So you guys can go to Loch Modan to level together. Thats Dwarves level 10-20 zone  
---
The map and the atmosphere and the view is hella nice. But for leveling its not that great.  
---
Or you can go to Darkshore. From level 10-11 onwards. It will be a quite run i must say. Thats Night Elves 10-20 zone.  
---
And thats exactly where you want to be.  Quests are easy. Quests are close. Its hella great around. Night elf musics. Classic warcraft vibe. Anything you ask for. And I KNOW you both want to have saber mounts. I know it. You cant lie. So you need darnassus reputation. There you have your Darnassus reputation.  
---
And you guys can take the rest from there. Have fun in Classic already!
---
As a healer? No
---
Simp?
---
what?
---
Thanks. I’ll check it out. It’s probably a little premature to commit to anything, but am really just curious what’s out there
---
There's a great video interview where John and Omar discuss The Burning Crusade and Wrath of the Lich King classic servers. 
---
They simply state that the reason Classic WoW happened was not just because Omar and the team found a way to implement the server data efficiently into the modern system, it was the community.
---
The community United together and collectively called for Classic WoW.
---
They stated that they are happy to make these servers. But they also specifically said, they NEED the community to unite together and call for it as ONE.
---
This hasn't happened, even now in this post take a read of how polarised people's opinions of TBC and WoTLK are, this is why it won't happen.. yet.
---
&gt; like daoc, ao, uo, eq, ac etc, our guilds were missing so many key members. Health of the games just plummeted and most people jumped on board to WoW 
---
Replace daoc, ao, uo, eq, ac with BfA, and WoW with Classic WoW, and 2004 will be repeated in 2019. I have no doubt that this will happen, again.
---
They got linked in patch 1.9. They weren't before that.
---
Alright, every other answer is a joke answer, so since I was curious as well, I looked it up.  Here's [an article](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/22/world/middleeast/trump-glowing-orb-saudi.html) about it, but I'll try to distill it.
---
President Donald Trump, King Salman of Saudi Arabia and President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt were at the opening of the Global Center for Combating Extremist Ideology in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.  The globe was basically just decoration, but the three of them touching it seemed like a good photo op, like, "Look, we're working together to combat radicalization globally."  Only they apparently didn't think about how the Internet likes to go wild with joking about photos.  The center's purpose is to help spread information so that countries can work to combat the radicalization that leads to terrorism, so it's actually a good thing.

Ironforge is convenient for travelling but SW once you can count on summons or portals for the Only/Need buff.

i only engange if someone fucks me over or is unfair attacking someone 2v1 or aimilar kinda shit
---
Good work on finding this one. The video evidence from old vanilla leans pretty heavily in favor of this being a bug. Hoping you reported this on the official forums.
---
He almost had 2k life and once the ccs went through, he shielded and straight up healed himself :D when they would have timed everything, maybe they could have taken him down :D i remembered that one day, we played like 20 bg‘s and he haven’t died a single time :D he was a machine tho
---
NO FACTION CHANGE, NO RACE CHANGE
---
WE WANT VANILLA NOT BFA!
---
Blizz will definitely do it if they see there is financial profit to be had.
---
ooo has anyone tried this in the Beta?
---
To be honest I keep only thinking about getting into the roof walkways in Undercity still, completely forgotten until now about getting over to GM Island. The other one would be the crazy zig zag swim in and out of the game map to fall/get under Kalimdor.
---
If you want to look at the very surface level details of the situation, sure.
---
You're right, it really is all about expectation. Vanilla's wonky, incomplete specs have given rise to a place for players to experiment. Protection pally tanking 5 mans is a way to mix things up. Enchancement tanking is a challenge. These things for better or worse were part of vanilla and apparently going to be part of classic.
---
The problem is that it's perfectly rational for a new player to roll up a paladin, see a tree devoted to protection, a tree devoted to damage, leverage all of the associated meta-knowledge about how a paladin plays from every other fantasy game and think that a paladin is a tank or dps. The game doesn't even do any favors to them, these specs are great 1-59. 
---
Vanilla raiding is just a totally different game though, and most players won't find out till they get there. The game itself does not teach you through mechanics what you should expect at the end game, why would we expect players to know?
---

They were linked once added, but didn't even exist at first in other cities. I remember as a nelf having to make that dangerous journey to IF after reading about this auction house.
---
If there's nothing beyond that, why wouldn't you.
---
The answer to all of this is a bunch of warriors.
---
Can you put extra keys in your bags or you have to drop the old ones?
---
You should take the time to read about how Classic WoW is even possible if you think it's only about reinventing the wheel. The fact we are getting patch 1.12 for Classic WoW is actually somewhat arbitrary. Plenty of videos on it you can find.
---
Leveling takes a pretty damn long time, then gearing up takes pretty long after that. If you want PvP gear, that's an extra grind. 
---
I would focus on one main character first, personally.
---
 I mean, the market made profit so I guess that fine :) I remember some leather bracers with agy on them, oh god they were so freakin expensive because BiS

It's a copypasta from a Hearthstone card a few expansions ago for the mage class:

https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/509brv/does_playing_babbling_book_make_anyone_else/
---
I just adapted it.
---
Looks awesome man keep them coming!
---
I've been extremely tempted with a dwarf rogue. A friend of mine is saying they want to go classic gnome mage so it would be good for an easy meetup. It's just I know if I did I'd be side lined for human rogues because of that damned sword specialisation making better dps. AND EVEN THEN the idea about not specialising in swords and going something less sort after like mace and dagger is apparently redundant because the mace stun is worthless in a raid.
---
I was in undergrad 03-07.  Played more than I should have and still had friends and graduated with general and departmental honors.  Just have to commit to school taking priority over gaming, which means sometimes skipping raids the nights before tests.  
---
Now, if you were looking for the go out every night and party college experience then yeah; wow probably doesn't fit, but I didn't have money for that anyway haha.
---
Not animation but the bow sound works pretty well, not so accurate tho
---
If you fell a tree, it'll take a bit of time until it hits the ground. Its fate was decided when the hewing began, however - not when you feel the thud through your boot soles.
---
Dang both sides? When you do classic let me know where you end up!
---
Wooohooohoohoosh
---
It is not going to work. The current player base adamantly oppose ANY slowing down, any added effort and any removals of QoLs.
---
If you THINK that Retail can be saved, you are delusional. You can't implement everything in one expansion, and expect your player base to stay. It will take 2-3 expansions to do that, and even that might not be enough.
---
What will be the point in making Retail like Classic....WHEN YOU ALREADY HAVE CLASSIC?
---
No, retail will get MORE of the same, and slowly die (I don't see more than one expansion before Retail goes to mobile) or it will need a Cataclysm 2.0, that reverts everything, and it will instantly die, because everyone will quit.
---
Oooooooh, that's clever. What's Firerogue? Total noob here.

hhahahahaahahaahaha

But then it's hard to pick just one haha.

What else you gonna do on beta?

With decay on the price of items bought, so if someone new comes along and get a bunch of upgrades no one wants they aren’t fucked for all eternity.

Just compare the beta size to BFA. Take a screenshot at the same exact wall in the level 1 zone. If they are the same height then that reference client is borked.

Why? A PVP server will do just fine.

Common sense can *always* be applied to objective observations - such as the differences between the sun and the moon, or sports and videogames. It *cannot always* be applied to deduce the motives of complex organisms who are irrational and make choices based on many inputs that you aren't privy too.
---
Essentially, I am just lazy and didn't feel like writing out all the ways video games are different from sports. Seeing that the differences are pretty obvious, I felt like people could use their own faculties from there.
---
nope the majority of my time was on Burning Legion (US)
---
Because WoW became more popular and they couldn’t choose if they want to play BC or Vanilla or Wotlk. Wtf is wrong with you that makes no sense
---
Looks good.
---
if it gives me a weapon like that hell yeah!
---
Dwarf priest heal &gt; heal &gt; others
---
Yeah we started off as Alliance - made it like halfway through MC, then rerolled horde. Found an awesome guild there where we cleared BWL, then the whole guild rerolled on a fresh server as alliance and basically ended up quitting once that guild broke up halfway through Naxx.
---
But yeah, I'll let you know. 
---
I think he's planning on rolling a Priest, I still can't decide if I want to do Warlock, Mage, or Rogue.
---
or the dps
---
Yeah, haha, that's the trouble. 
---
But if you become an alt-aholic you'll never make any meaningful progress on endgame.

Kappa //

my favorite part of the fax monkey is he casts about 6 spells and is getting the low mana warning to pop a mana gem.
---
This will be a fine addition to my collection
---
Why *not*? If the RP tag is just to designate a place for roleplayers to congregate, why not give them that option on a PVP server?
---
This ain't it chief
---
Before they nerfed spell power for lower ranks I was healing dungeons by spamming rank 1 flash of light and it was impossible to go oom.
---
Yeah, and it'll only take an other max lvl friend to help you twink out your 19, at least for the BiS gear from dungeons. And you'll have plenty of time to gear em out while waiting for BG's, then you can just jump right in with all the advantage.
---
I def did this in vanilla but not sure how much I'll be staying busy with at 60 in order to twink out a lowbie before the BG patch.
---
I **HATE** world buffs.
---
And before someone says '*just don't use them, easy*.' Yeah, it's not that easy. I plan on playing on  the highest level, despite world buffs being a major pain in the ass. And I would be quite disposable if I refused to use them in my guild.
---
&gt; don't really see how it was the start of retail.
---
BC did some things right (viability of specs), but other things really wrong (flying, badge gear). If there is a place to use Classic as a starting point for a better WoW, you need to re-examine every design decision as early as 2.0.1 (possibly before that in some cases, e.g. making the unarmored mounts unavailable was a bad choice, in my opinion - it took something away that would not have hurt to keep), and re-orient everything from Classic as that starting point. That means that a "no changes" BC would already be a step into the wrong direction.
---
Lol they aren't reinventing the wheel right now. They are litterally going through EVERY asset and making sure it looks the same and functions the same as it did during classic. There are still tons of bugs out there that havent been fixed yet. Little ones yes, but they're still there. 
---
This shit will have to be done all again for each iteration of the game where more assets are added in. 
---
Im thinking this is a troll post now.
---
This guy knows whats up.
---
I agree, it was Cata.
---
Tanking requires that you care about your party. Trump would be an awful tank.
---
Hi.
---
-D.C.
---
I was mostly thinking of a general harder gameplay, and where rewards feel like one you worked for, and not something that is thrown after you nonstop.
---
**bahahahahahahahahahahahahahah**
---
Plural on anecdote is not data though.
---
Yes this one is a game changer. It also shows a polymorph timer I believe.
---
Yeah, unfortunately WoW has a lot of alt right people. It’s unfortunate that the ignore list has a maximum.
---
We could argue the other way as well: world buffs make the content more fun. Since it is trivial, what is fun is to push DPS.
---
I'm guessing you mean the Ony / Nef buff!
---
I've been on the wrong sites all these years theN! 
---
So uhh, ahem, mind telling me what site we are talking about here mate?
---
This would take 2 minutes to test. Make a gnome on beta and one on BFA and see if they are the same height. You don't need to mess around with zoom or any visual things. Find a wall that hasn't been changed and just stand them both up next to a crack. 
---
They shouldn't be the same height.
---
My guess is that the modern client in which classic has been recreated polls for updates to mob and player locations more frequently than vanilla.  This would result in more accurate representation on your screen of where the mob actually is according to the server.  
---
If I had to assume, this is an unintended side effect of better connectivity and other improvements made over time.  It may be as simple to fix as decreasing the poll rate, or it may be something they have to be more creative to "fix".  Or it could just be the new normal.
---
Im planning to creating the lvl 19 char before my main and when servers go live, I straight up run the the arena of gurus ahi for the trinket haha
---
Lol Jesus OP. Did a pserver player fuck your girlfriend?
---
On pserver we do ony, zg and DM. But in new raids they disappear inside.
---
Cleared every raid up to naxx multiple times without any of them. Cleared the raids with them, too. Both ways was fine and actually without makes you play better because you aren't apprehensive about losing your buffs.
---
We've been doing naxx and they aren't allowed there for 2.5 weeks yet.
---
It's fine, unsure what point youre making.
---
easy, Orgrimmar. :p
---
I agree,  the reason I was even asking is half my friends are horde,  other alliance,  and if I go horde and those friends stop playing it would be nice to faction over to alliance.  I do see the problem with it,  and I agree would be better to not be able to,  I was just curious if they said they were trying to. Bring that in or not,  know how blizzard is now.
---
That's business for you. You don't keep employees on the books you no longer need. Shareholders &gt; Executives.
---
Well that's why I was trying to limit myself to just 4. Hell 3 really with Crafter just being that guy who gets mail from the enemy faction. Then really 2 since after hitting max level on the leveler they'd be scrapped for parts to the PVPer and Raider.
---
Heirlooms speed up a tedious leveling grind that's not remotely fun the 10th time. Lfr killed the game,  too many people were happy to afk through there rather than learn to play and do real raids.
---
Lk had raiding perfect .10 man was easily puggable so was most of 25 man normal. There was also enough challenge there for proper raiding with heroic modes.
---
I do like the sense of "preserve this opportunity" feeling that the world buffs bring, once you have them you sharpen your mind extra to not fuck up and lose them. But overall i do think they ruin more than they bring happiness. Its annoying to sit logged out of your main to not ruin the runtime of your buffs. 
---
I like the PvP aspect of ruining other peoples worldbuffs though, adds another fun layer to World PvP, i dont mind losing them to PvP.
---
&gt; Go to an uncontested zone, don't stream, or play on a PvE server.
---
I'm not saying this in a confrontational way. Those are her options.
---
I actually think the way BfA does PvP is great, making it an opt-in or opt-out with rewards for opting in that can be toggled in Stormwind and Orgrimmar. The bounty system is fun too. The reason world PvP died in vanilla was because most of us got our fill in BGs. Flying put the final nail in BC but it was dead before that. The BfA system seems to have revived it to an extent, I’ve been leveling a rogue with it on and in even dead areas like Gorgrond there has been plenty of PvP opportunity. Of course, sharding is involved there, too, but the feeling is there. 
---
There will be a lot of PvP server tourists who tire of the toxicity and quit or re roll pve. There will also be people like me who just go to BGs and want to farm in peace, but who plan to start on a PvP server until BGs are a thing. 
---
Your point that people are over it, I agree, but nostalgia will drive high PvP server engagement for while.
---
Was 23k when i checked while writing the response.
---
I think engineering from the start is a huge waste of money. If I were you I would go mining+skinning and save everything needed for engineering then sell the excess mats. You can find 0-300 profession leveling guides online so finding out what to sell wouldn't be a problem. With money from skinning you can make a good progress through better bags and your mount. Also you are a mage so you won't have problem with your portals and hs to dump excess mats to keep your bags clear. Also look up for bag recipes online, most of them require mats you can collect without professions so its better to pay for a tip than a mark up on ah.
---
&gt; I'm just regurgitating 
---
Sums up the whole thread for me.
---
No, I'm really not. We've seen with Layering that Blizzard can service over 1 million players in Europe and the US with just 1 realm per region.
---
because why should the druid who can be a caster tank melee healer be better at casting or meleeing than classes that literally can't do anything BUT melee or casting like rogue mage warlock? That's not balance. You can't be tricks of all trades and also be master at them and specifically raiding is split into different roles and you want those in each role to perform to their maximum and that is healing, because the hybrid classes are specifically the only healers so that's what they are best at. Healers had to be hybrid or they would be useless in the world. 
---
Raiding in vanilla was just a small part of the game, most people didn't even participate in raiding, it isn't the raid simulator that later expansions became. I'm not saying that's a good or bad thing, that's just how vanilla is, so every spec doesn't have to be strong in raiding. 
---
Lastly TBC started to change this by making all the hybrid specs basically buff bots, they all gave super OP unique buffs so you were FORCED to have this that and what not. I think this is terrible design and they later just changed it to everyone doing the same damage. But with cheap respecs and dual spec they completely cucked pure dps specs, why pick rogue when you can have a druid do the same dps give buffs give utility and also be tank or resto if needed?!?!
---
exactly
---
pardon me for getting on my high horse but the types of people who say it's for instant gratification seeking normies are probably lfr raiders who don't have a high enough item level to even walk into a mythic raid
---
Fair enough, it took people like 10-20 days of playtime just to level from 1-60, though, I believe.
---
I always felt like Warrior T2 and T3 should be switched. The T2 set looks like it's straight outta Naxx with all the green and skulls.
---
I can’t say I respect these feats that much.  Yea the Grand Marshal Claymore was fucking ridiculous and you gawked in awe over it.
---
But a single player gaining Grand Marshal each week just means people need to plot and manipulate the system to obtain it.
---
You had to either account share and grind honor 24/7 or play on a deserted server with little competition.
---
Account sharing is a bannable offense.  So you either play by the rules and fall short, or risk TOS for Grand Marshal? 
---
As much as I love vanilla, there was plenty of flaws in their PvP ranking system.
---
We don't know what the actual server situation will be like.  If it's like actual vanilla, there will be new realms every few months, so it's possible in a year there will be a fresh realm for you to join.
---
Blizzard doesn’t release numbers anymore, we’ll never have empirical data. BFA is fine guys!!

Its doable on plenty of dungeons unless the boss is in close quarters with lots of adds. Its just too much even for a coordinated group usually.
---
Nochanges
---
I don't think I have heard anyone say that mark is the best buff in the game. On the contrary, I always hear it is the worst buff
---
Haha just a case of the blind leading the blind then?
---
Regardless of when, or if, they release BC or Wrath Classic, moving from one to the next needs to be a one way trip. No going to BC and coming back to Classic with flying mounts etc. Otherwise, you would be making Classic back into retail which is not what “WE” want.
---
Personal perspective though, I don’t see the point in dividing the Classic population that way. It would only diminish it’s longevity. Besides, the only major difference between BC, Wrath, and retail is that they go by much faster now when you play through them.

Who wants to world pvp when noone knows how gear/level/talent scale ? some classes oneshot, others do no damage. its a complete shitshow, your stats and abilitys change when you get in combat with a player and even blizzard is confused. I remember in legion I overhealed player damage in world pvp and duels with the passive healing my legendary legs gave every second.  disgusting.
---
No, I think it'll be around 1 million for US+EU, which we've seen Blizzard can handle with 1 realm per type per region very easily thanks to Layering.
---
stormlingx had some very good pvp content back in private server days
---
You can’t edit posts on reddit bud
---
Ha.  Damn autocorrect.  Yes.
---
I'd say more like the blind making me blind.
---
Yeah I was thinking my alt 60 would be a mage, but warlock keeps sounding so enticing. IDK though, I’ve played a 60 Mage before and the whole leveling process and endgame play is just so satisfying, I don’t think I could give that up.
---
Now I just have to decide if my main is priest or paladin.
---
Leeway and increased spell batching window is really gonna change the pvp meta in Classic.
---
Ironforge was the only major city with an auction house in the beginning. It wasn't until patch 1.9 (opening of AQ) that auction houses were added to all other major cities. Ironforge also had a very short flight path to Thorium Point from where you could mount and go to Blackrock Mountains in a straight line (with only 2 or 3 spiders on the way).
---
This attracted a lot of players to the city. It was the place to be.
---
Lovely stuff, thank you.
---
Welcome to bolvars Azeroth smh
---
Most players start in the first camp. Then they play in a guild that lets players do what they want. They see how chaotic a 40 man environment can be when more than half your raid is slacking, not bringing consumables, and ninja pulling. Then they either quit or end up like the guy in the second camp.
---
Managed to get my old account back after it was hacked circa 2009/2010. All my gear was still intact on my mage, it was nice to see all my alts again that I had forgotten all about.
---
I’ll post some screenshots of my toons later. 
---
Hit me right in the feels.
---
same as me, but skinning herba, then alch herba, then having alt with enchanting to DE.
---
it'll be a lot easier to level, you can then get carried through raids to get t3 bis and then proceed to 2 or 3 hit every class in pvp.
---
Problem is, world buffs do something really well, and that is engage the whole server community and the levelers in the whole game. If you're a lvl 30 running through Org when Ony head comes down, that's awesome. People are talking about which guilds are killing her and Nef first, you get to see all the raiders gather round the post, it's like a mini-server event. And in the context of leveling or pop, their not really that strong, as you're always at risk of losing them.
---
Where world buffs have a problem is in raids, and here private servers got it right. Just have the raid zone flush your world buffs. But rather than only do for a month, just keep this permanent.
---
Like the OP says, one of the key reasons why fury warriors are far to OP is due to how they scale far better than any other class. Without world buffs, this really only starts to kick in late AQ40, with world buffs warriors are out of control the second they step into MC in blues.
---
The way it was worded it inferred that at full potential they would be doing less damage, and that is what made them inferior, not the fact that they have mana issues. I was clearing up that
---
Some big crits in this video though
---
or the people going out of their way to grief a streamer specifically should just get punished? there's already rules against it.
---
I don't support it. But I also don't dicdate what's fun for others.
---
They can hold aggro on mobs in mc and naxx, so can warriors, so theres no reason behind gearing paladins instead of warriors. And everyone knows that paladins can tank 5 mans, but unless they have gear, they arent good.
---
I'm glad you won't get what you want
---
Bit of a correction for the Paladin section there; it says you only ever use max rank flash of light, but using rank 1 can be very useful once you've got good gear.
---
With ~900 bonus heal right now, and the Flash of Light libram, my rank1 FoL heals for ~600. 600 healing for 35 mana. I can spam it all day and never OOM because my regular mana regen outpaces it.
---
Also, when you are leveling and get Blessing of Light at level 40, you can use rank 1 holy light. Put blessing of light on the tank and just go to town spamming rank1 Holy Light, doing tons of healing for almost no mana, because Blessing of Light applies the same amount of +heal no matter what rank of Holy Light you're using.
---
ALSO....holy shock is fucking garbage, ngl. It costs a shitload of mana, does less healing than flash of light, doesn't scale very well, and has a 20 yard range and 30 second cooldown. Blegh. I went through all of vanilla content on my holy paladin and never found a time when something like that would be super useful.
---
No faar from it. From MC gear onwards you start using heroic strike.
---
Sunder does 260 Threat.
---
Rank 8 (pre AQ20 upgrade) Heroic Strike does 145+\[Damage dealt\]. Meaning you need average of 115 damage to be on par with Sunder. 
---
This is very easy to get and tanks in MC gear and raidbuffs will be critting 500+With heroic strike. Add to that heroic strike is cheaper and does not expend a GCD. True it overwrites your white hit giving you less rage, so if you are rage starved I would prolly prior sunder, however if you have medium to high rage gain it is always better, especially if you spec improved so it only costs 12 rage.
---
Rank 9 Heroic Strike does 175 Threat+\[Damage dealt\].
---
This means the tank should never sunder unless he is approaching ragecap within the next damage he takes (70+ or so). getting 5 sunder stack is dps warriors job. Each DPS warrior will apply 1 sunder at the beginning of each engagement.
---
Incorrect, if you look the higher the spell the higher HP per mana healed. You are missing the most important component, plus healing gear, otherwise downranking does not work. Read my comment below.
---
The stuff people can build with Legos...
---
I took 3 months of my time and paid for the full FFXIV game. FFXIV is basically BfA, with 100 times more loading screens and cut scenes.
---
It is EASY AS FUCK, got my Paladin to 70 in under 3 months...and ALL classes (but Fisherman) also to 70 BEFORE that. And if people don't know, classes is like professions...and there are 11 of them in FFXIV, and you can have them all on one character. There is no need for alts.
---
So, in under 3 months, I maxed out my Paladin, Miner, Botanist, Leatherworker, Weaver, Goldsmith, Blacksmith, Armorsmith, Culinarian and Alchemist, maxed out the Retainers, have over 60 million gil. I only slacked on Fisherman leveling, it's only 50.
---
Solo content is a joke in FFXIV, raiding up to extreme is also a joke. Making money is as simple as anyone can get. The community aspect is exactly as in BfA...it exists only in FC (guilds). They have LFG, LFR, and all the crap.
---
FFXIV a competitor for Classic???????? 
---
It is for BfA...but for Classic? 
---
What the hell are you smoking?
---
I want to use it as my desktop background but Grandma wouldn't approve. Thanks for your service.
---
If this is an issue of being easily addicted to games, and wow particularly, then you need to be super honest with yourself. You know you best. If you feel it will be detrimental to your life goals then I suggest not playing. Or finding some game that is less addictive, less of a time sink.

Hi, /u/iDylo

Unfortunately your post has been removed by our AutoModerator because it seems to be a poll. Unfortunately, we do not allow non-sanctioned polls per [Rule 7](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/wiki/rules).

Beastslayer enchant on a mage, nice
---
Do you need a CD key and thats it? My old acc was taken and probably merged and played on by foul peoples - would it still be possible?
---
&gt;r me interested. Initial class pick would have been mage, but I'll definitely go Enh mascot for a guild if using HoR.
---
I like your squanch!
---
Because there's simply not enough people to keep the realm alive. The change.org petition has what? 1.5k signatures? We've seen with layering that Blizzard is aiming for at least ~15k per server at launch.
---
&gt; You don't need to mess around with zoom or any visual things.    
---
Yes you do. Otherwise you aren't comparing like with like. Look up "background compression." It makes the object in the foreground look larger/smaller relative to their background due to zoom. As does angle, scale, resolution, and on and on.    
---
So you absolutely DO need complete consistency otherwise the screenshots are meaningless. This is exactly the kind of thinking that resulted in the OP's inconsistency:

I plan on 19 and 29 twinking. Some of the best times I had in vanilla were at those levels.
---
Pally
---
You want to play on the "highest level" but don't want to spend 15 minutes getting world buffs that help you tremendously to achieve that highest level?
---
Patch 2.0 virtually killed downranking as it changed the way plus healing bonuses applied to lower rank spells, if I recall correctly, ranks 6 levels  below you current level got a significant reduction in plus healing.
---
I did the same before AQ. Message a Gm, I was able to get my mage back. Still had fire resist enchants and everything.
---
Fishing alch herba is very valuable especially if you take a lot of time fishing and herbing while leveling.
---
They didn't clear ST. They only completed 1 quest. I'd love to see someone try to clear the entire dungeon though.
---
Qu'est ce que fuck?
---
Where have we seen this? If you don't mind me asking.
---
I used my CD keys, I gave the name of my main character, told them what server he should have been on, gave them the email and my name/address that the account was registered too and they were able to find it! 
---
Needed to show them a picture of my ID to prove that it was actually me, but was effortless, they had it back to me within the same day.
---
Hello potential future guildies.  If anyone remembers me from Uldum/Exodar servers I played the hunter Crunkjuice!  I think I will name new hunter Omegawolf though :) Dont steal this name you plebs!
---
I think you outlined why world buffs won't be an issue. One wipe and your week of buff farming is done. That alone will stop most guilds from bothering with them.
---
Further, most players aren't going to have multiple high level toons. They can't afford to logout for a week at a time to preserve a buff. And some people, you know, like to actually play the game.
---
Lastly, we don't know exactly how powerful world buffs will be. We don't know how they all stack, ps just guessed at it.
---
Naxx attunement. Zg enchants. Brood of nozdormu rings. Cenarion hold items. Also stuff from other reps for professions. It also becomes huge when you inevitably want another mount because horses are horrid.
---
Then stand them next to a dwarf. If what's you're saying changes how tall they are vs other things in the game, then their height is practically meaningless.
---
The classic beta has reignited my hatred for goblins.
---
Yes, you just have to have lower expectations for the type of guild you'll be in than you might have if you were no-lifing. You'll be fine. People always need tanks, it doesn't matter what level of progression they are (i.e. extreme casual or extreme hardcore).
---
I think the idea is that 3k is the max they would do on a layer, but they can start off smaller and merge them as players spread out more. Also, since a layer is an entire continent, the players would be split between 3 starting zones on each layer, so 500 per layer at the start probably isn't terrible. They still want it to feel full, just not so full it's completely unplayable.

&lt;Zz&gt; | Horde | NA - PVP |  6pm - 10 pm PST Sunday - Thursday (as needed) | Hardcore PVE and PVP Guild
---
**Who we are:** &lt;Zz&gt; is comprised of a core of 15 veteran World of Warcraft players, our leadership has cleared through Naxxramas on Private servers and has raided in top retail guilds such as &lt;Gentleman's Club&gt; and &lt;Midwinter&gt;. We are eager to find players that want to bring a hardcore mindset to Classic.
---
**Goals on launch:** Our first goal will be to achieve a **World Top 5 Ragnaros** and as such we are looking for people interested in leveling quickly and diving straight into the end-game content. We are confident that we can kill Ragnaros by day 9 if not faster.
---
**Goals beyond launch:**" Once we have killed Ragnaros we are going to be forming a second raid and doing split runs and once Phase 2 is released we will be pushing to have as many players reach Rank 14 as possible.
---
**Raid Times:** Scheduled raid times are Tuesday and Wednesday 6pm-10pm PST, Early on you can expect the weekly raid commitment to be only about 2 hours per week since it will just be Molten Core and Onyxia. Your schedule should be flexible and agreeable with raiding Sunday and Monday as extra raid days for new content releases and split raids.
---
**Requirements:** Raiders will be expected to show up to raids fully consumed and with an attitude that lends itself to working in a team environment. We're looking for players with competitive mindsets who will push each other to improve and overall better the guild. Members will also be required to have a level 20 Warlock/summoning alt for world bosses. 
---
**How to Apply:** It's as easy as sending in an application! &lt;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf48RsCpN17p0th0ZVUcx6V8QDDcbpnRgCpEBgFeQJTy5z_uw/viewform?usp=sf_link&gt;
---
Feel free to  DM me with any questions. We are always looking for exceptional and passionate players.
---
As far as I know yes. The bosses drop 49+ blues so this reward would compete with them afaik.
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject={{Kind}+removal&amp;message=http://strawpoll.com).

7 is Ret
---
IX is DPS warrior.
---
I don’t want a guild with world firsts and 20 hours uptime. Those two are mutually exclusive. World first is a 40-80 hour uptime thing.
---
Besides, I don’t want to play classic like a speedrun. That’s one of the things I hate about retail. Nobody ever has time to take things seriously. Hurry up to max level cause lvling sucks. Hurry up through dungeons cause they too suck early on. Mythic + are all races, so hurry up. I’ve been left behind half a dozen times in mythic plus...
---
People just lack situational awareness so they don’t notice their healer isn’t with them. Or that they are standing in a pool that does massive damage. Or that their team routinely pulls wandering mobs so maybe the tank shouldn’t pull the bare minimum and instead make room for the party to safely kill everything they pull...
---
It doesn’t make sense because dying always slows down groups far more than their rushing tactics.
---
There's two kinds of good actors. Actors who play characters so well you forget there's a person playing the role. And actors who play themselves and every role, but they're just so fun to watch you don't care. Keanu is #2.
---
Um mate. I said that engineering item do go over lvl 60 as gnome. Literally just repeated what I said.  6 demon trinket however, much appreciated the info. I was indeed looking at tbc. Cheers
---
Heh, I had issues doing this in pug groups recently on a private server.  Definitely took several attempts with a 50+ group and involved pre buying the blood from the AH
---
You should pick your main, get to 60 and then decide what you want to do.
---
Trying to plan 4 characters in advance when you've never played the game isn't likely to work out, by the time you get 1 character to 60 there's a very high likelihood that almost everything you planned will have changed.
---
[You can fit raid frames](https://i.imgur.com/JR0ABb1.png)
---
Wall jumping seems to be in, although it seems harder/impossible sometimes moreso than what I remember from Vanilla. Wallwalking I'm pretty sure is not doable though.
---
pshhhh, speak for yourself man.  I personally don't want multiple expansions of classic running at the same time at all.  I want 2 years Vanilla --&gt; 2 years TBC --&gt; 2 years WotLK and then release a fresh set of servers starting at vanilla again and go through the progression all over. After the second set of servers caps out, merge them together and start a 3rd generation.  Rinse and repeat for all of eternity and I'd be happy.
---
Dwarf's model is different between the two versions of the game. You need a consistent measurement. That way you should be able to over-lay the two screenshots, they should align 1:1, and the gnome should be the only variable.
---
Do you need 3 tanks when you have that druid with the expectation of trash tanking?  Aren't 6 fury warriors and 5 rogues a little overkill.  They'll have a lot of difficulty gearing up being in such direct competition.  Couldn't an enhance shaman be useful for nightfall holding and improved windfury (for the 2h fury warrior group)?  Feels like it could use another lock, just because.
---
&gt;Worst offender of course is DMF. When the Darkmoon Faire is in town, where you can get a 1-10% damage buff, which is distributed randomly. *This is on a 2 hour cooldown*. This means sitting around, logged out, and then logging back on every two hours until you get either a 9% or a 10% roll. I envy people who have never done this. DMF event lasts for a week, so you get one raid with DMF, and then you go reroll it and log out until next reset. I haven't played my pserver toon for 6 days and it's what has prompted this rant. Oh, and have fun when it's in enemy territory. 
---
Wow, my guild was top on our p-server, we'd go grab the DMF buff together and then just make fun of the guys who got the low %s. 
---
&gt;Furthermore, worldbuffs breed a speciel type of toxicity which I haven't experienced anywhere else in my years of gaming. Nothing will prepare you for the unmitigated salt of getting purged of your worldbuffs which you spent hours getting and days logged out for. When the MT dies to Vaelastrasz and the entire raid is threatcapped for the rest of the instance, fun times ensue.   
---

---
&gt;World PvP? People dedicate entire raidnights and ambushes just to strip the opposition of their buffs and making the instance they are about to run 2x harder and longer. If you are a DPS and you lose your buffs early you can just go brain AFK and mash your buttons - no way in hell will anyone be able to tell the difference on meters because you have 0 chance of keeping up.  
---
&gt;4.   Worldbuffs breeds a toxic raid atmosphere  
---
&gt;5.   Ganking and WPvP with the specific intent of stripping someone's buffs is AIDS
---
Who lets their MT be one of the sacrificed tanks? You have a fury or 2 throw on a shield and take one for the team. Also maybe for you you find it toxic, idk how I have never seen that side of world buffs ever in my time, just a bunch of friends who managed to get there early enough to run DMN with me so I could summon the slower guys to it cleared. If someone tried to steal songflowers on either faction, their own faction would be pissed about it, because the retaliation would be 100% worse. The WPvP aspect was the most fun part imo, only a few times did we get attacked on the way to BRM, and they were absolutly the best nights we ever. The leadership asked us to get nogginfloggers, invis pots, faps, and stun grenades on these nights. We would be hard to click, hard to whipe, hard to dispell/purge before we could whipe them or rush inside like little babies if we knew a few other guilds joined together to get us. I think world buffs make this exponentialy more likly, who cares about whiping a progression guild if they just walk in 5 min late beccause of you, who cares to make the enemy guild take an extra hour and start an actual rivialrly, I and many others do. 
---
I think the best place for a guy like you is just not on a PvP server, you seem to like the whole being stronger, and min maxing, but you hate the PvP aspect of it.
---
I don't know what you're trying to say, but I'm not arguing that. I just didn't like someone stating "There's NOTHING you can do about it."
---
I never liked world buffs although I have never been required to collect them. 
---
This post has definitely inspired me to lolpurge outside of instances and world buff locations.
---
I’m really looking forward to the hunter one :). Great job on these!
---
Na it just turned it into something funny everyone does now instead of just the assholes. In effect it's ruined that means of putting people down you just stomped because people doing it "just because" now. So if you want to put the other team down you gotta say something else otherwise they don't know that's what you mean, which was the point of saying it in the first place.
---
&gt;(WoW: they need to make less fresh content by slowing hard core players down and make a game "look" more active while the players actually do not have fun but do chores
---
Daily quests didn't slow the content for harcore players. TBC probably had the most content for hardcore players. 16 dungeons with heroic modes, two 10man raids and seven 25man raids in one and a half year. Additionally it introduced arenas.
---
&gt;I couldn't even get the best ammunition for my hunter until the next expansion where it was worthless...
---
What ammo are you talking about? You never could buy the best ammo from daily reputation vendors. You needed Violet Eye reputation in T4 (Karazhan) and Keepers of time reputation in T6 (Mount Hyjal). Both reputations ehere gained by killing mobs in the raid instances and notvthrough daily quests. Before that you used Ammo crafted by engineers.
---
&gt;In Pandaria even the most hardcore daily quest farmers were screaming to Blizzard to stop it
---
Yeah, because it was a totally different situation. In MoP all the valor epic gear was gated behind it. In TBC no one gave a shit about daily quests because the only items you could get where 1 or 2 okayish items that were worse than current raid gear and Netherdrakes / Nether Rays.
---
&gt;I will most likely drop the mouse on it again and play something else.
---
And most play will play gladly without doing daily quests because there is no real reward from it. And players who like them can do them.
---
As a hopefully Hunter main, holy shit please fix this.
---
And for some it's both. So what?
---
Mooncloth and Grave Moss, 300% return on investment guaranteed.
---
Nature resistance gear can earn you some good cash too when AQ goes live.
---
Pre nerf arcane explosion spamming skeram was fucking hard too.
---
People are just weird and want their thing to be the best and hardest.
---
If they can sheep it is super easy. I've seen 5x Mages do Live Strat no problem. They were geared however (BWL).
---
He only has 23 million subs... You not knowing who he is does’t negate his relevance.
---
I guess I should have classified that in the context of the 3 major class buffs that are brought to a raid. AI, fort, and MotW.

It's probably pretty subjective, but I'd say 12 to all stats + baseline resistances is better than int or stam.
---
Or they reverse it back to the way it was supposed to work like, and were balanced around. Tough choice hmm
---
You missed the point by a mile. Do you actually understand how and why downranking works? From what I am reading ppl have no idea.
---
As to lower cast times, you would never cast a healing spell rank below 20 and after 20 they are all the same cast speed. 
---
My comment was about heal and flash heal benefiting differently from plus healing. The guide failed to mention anything about that.
---
Guess we will be stuck with lagging servers on launch with ok population. Blizzard sadly cant make servers as stable as pservers
---
Yes they are lying. I posted the same thing weeks ago and it was down voted to shit. I don't know how people can see all the BFA behaviors in the beta and still actually think the game is using 1.12 data.
---
Hyjal lmao you've undone yourself
---
This.
---
fix pls blizz
---
This is easily one of the worst ways to present data. It’s all over the fucking place.
---
I think even 16/20 is a massive overestimation of how many raiding guilds will actually care about this. Most of the guilds out of the top 10 or so per server will be much more concerned with finding 40 consistent raiders than to min-max their composition, especially when it comes to races (class composition will be more important, generally). This is especially true if the raids end up being anywhere near as easy as private servers have made people expect them to be.
---
Hmm swore you could. Thanks bud.
---
New advice: delete this post and make it proper :)
---
Did you get lost somewhere in two lines of text? I will still use world buffs despite them being a pain in the ass. I swear, some of you apes on this subreddit have no chance of functioning out in society if simple two-line text is this hard to comprehend.
---
Assuming I go alliance, I'll be playing human priest on a good east coast PVP server.  My GF is rolling a human mage with me, but we'd have room for a rogue.  
---
Also taking a week off work for release.  I was in Death Dealers (my older brother is an OG that came over from DAoC and started the guild, I joined around when TBC came out), so I've got some experience with the old world.
---
To be clear you can’t edit titles. You can edit the content of text posts.
---
The bad reputation doesn’t actually do anything. People sort of made that crap up over time. Bunch of people would make blacklists and other dumb stuff but the vast majority of players never acknowledged these things.
---
You can change your battle tag settings so it doesnt show your name
---
Not really, it implies that they'd prefer BC to vanilla. If the choice is vanilla or nothing, they might stay.
---
That's exactly where I'm at; if they never release BC servers I'll still come back and play vanilla. I doubt I'd be doing that if BC was on offer.
---
OP certainly doesn't. Cool post though
---
Simple math and observations.
---
Oceania + EU + US = 11 regions, that's 22 servers not counting any RP servers.
---
Each Layer holds up to 5,000 players and there's a minimum of 4 Layers per realm, but during the stress test, we saw up to 6 Layers *per continent*.
---
Which means with just 1 realm per region per type, they can service at minimum 440,000 players online at the same time and potentially even more than 1.32 million players online at the same time.
---
This is not 2007 where the list will be 500 realms long. Thanks to layering, you'll be lucky if you live in the bigger markets (EU-English, US-Pacific, US-East, China) and have more than one realm of your desired type to choose from. Maybe 3, but that's it.
---
I’d go straight to BC if I could. But I can’t so I won’t. I will play Classic and love it. Then I will eventually play BC and love that even more.
---
**&lt;Shadow Clan&gt;**
---
Shadow Clan is a North American guild primarily focused on a semi-casual experience with like minded individuals.  Our goal is to ensure common motivation across all members, that being to maximize progress for time played.  We don't have the expectation that everyone should be playing all the time, but the time we do spend together as a guild should be aimed at dungeons, material/ gear farming, and raiding.
---
We want to foster a friendly community with clear goals each week.  No one will get left behind, but shouldn't drag the rest of the guild down either.  We aren't looking to be the best; we just want to be a presence on the server.
---
**Region**: NA
---
**Sever Type**: PvP
---
**Server Selection Criteria**:  Once a server list is provided by Blizzard, we're going to look at where the largest concentrations of players are signing up to narrow down our selection and then do a guild vote to choose the sever we'll be playing on for Classic!
---
**Faction**: Horde
---
**Raid Times (Eastern)**: Group Formation 7:30pm, Raiding by 8pm, Final pull no later than 11:15pm.
---
**Type of Guild**: Casually optimized guild focused on clearing available content within the phase limits.  
---
**Loot Distribution**: Weighted /rolls based on current gearing.  I.e. if someone is in an optimal gear set, they have less of a chance of winning, even with a higher roll, against someone with worse gear.  The reason for this is that Loot Council is too subjective when there are 37 other people involved and DKP is extremely difficult to track and subject to hording for rare items which results in people never upgrading gear.  It also allows us an attractive option for PUGs since they don't have DKP and would never win in a LC based system.

**Member Selection Criteria**:
---
We want other members that are able to get along.  There is no point being in a guild with people that are only looking out for themselves and create drama.  We are looking to progress at a semi-fast rate and to do that on a casual schedule requires clear direction and minimal distractions.  
---
The guild is not aiming to be the top on the server, but we want the server to recognize our presence through offering craftables/consumables, positive dungeon/raiding experiences, and a strong world presence.
---
If you're interested in joining the guild send me a PM or message me on Discord Distrion_#2079
---
here's hoping ony head has a 6 hour cooldown
---
&gt;  If Naxx was out for over a year and every guild had it on farm 
---
If Naxx would be out for 10 years, most guilds won't even be able to set foot inside. TIME is irrelevant for Naxx. You need to FULLY commit to grinding, A LOT, for consumes, raid 4-5 days / weeks, etc. etc.
---
You think most guilds, which will be casual, will EVER have the discipline and logistics to even go in AQ40? 
---
It is not about time, it is about players. Most players are casuals, and casuals won't clear Naxx even if they have 10 years at their disposal.
---
They just lack the commitment. And this can;t be solved by time.
---
"Every guild will had it on farm"....LMAO !
---
I think mages amp magic works the same way.
---
You wouldn't be sidelined at all, human dps increase is maybe 10% at best at higher tiers, not much difference, if you think about it another way if you do less dmg you have less worries about threat.
---
Confirmed to work on the beta? Mate

---
Thank you! Fucking hell finally someone gets it.
---
That's good, I don't have specific details just was mentioning what has been thrown around.  I remember the TBC launch was chaos.  Classic will already be slow enough to level without having to wait for everyone camping mobs.
---
Ofc
---
Thanks for the help guys. I think i’ll go for skinning and sell the mats so I can afford 60% mount and decent bags.
---
Might also just get mining but i won’t go out of my way to level it while leveling. Them at 60 i’ll remove skinning and get engi with mining.
---
child labour lul
---
So you're saying that because of angles, and resolution the size of gnomes on the beta looks the same to BFA but they are actually different? 
---
It's possible. It's not likely.
---
If the beta is any indication people won't give up after the first wipe.
---
It's just abusing mob pathing. He's jumping up and down from the ledge which forces the boss to run around.
---
My joke just went flying over your head....
---
Yeah, exactly, they'll never take it away now that it's here. Even if they have to merge servers after a while they will *always* let people play "pure" Classic with no BC, no NG+, no 1.14. Otherwise the entire cycle will start anew and people will be asking for "WoW Classic Classic".
---
It's an older meme sir, but it checks out
---
&gt; Im planning to creating the lvl 19 char before my main and when servers go live,
---
wait, how do you expect to create a lvl 19 before servers go live?
---
I love these. Do a hunter one!
---
They don't. The armours too high. It's harder than classic be. Crusade over.
---
I got warned by a GM that by 3-Capping Arathi Basin before the game began that I was "Exploiting the geometry of the game to gain an unfair advantage in PVP." So I guess jumping the fence, capping the Stables, capping the Lumber Mill, then slow falling down to the Blacksmith for a final cap (The last one was usually after the game started by a few seconds) is not permitted.
---
What if BC servers have way more concurrent players than Classic does?  We won’t know till they do it.
---
I think they will.
---
Ty, 
---
It just hit me, I thought with all the information classic will be easier but now I am afraid with all the miss information it will be much harder.
---
Classic isn't more difficult lol
---
One of my favorite Vanilla experiences was me and my brother duoing WC with our two hunters. It took about 3 hours and involved lots of respawns, but we did it.
---
Classic is not more difficult than retail, not even close. The bad rep meme only really applies to serious griefing or outright trolling. No ones gunna remember that warrior that left your group 2 months ago
---
So young and already addicted to dream dust.. Poor kid.
---
Phases will have a 4 month duration. Or 16 weeks, if you like. Some will have 13 weeks, some 18 weeks, some 15, some 17.
---
But overall, expect roughly 16 weeks between phases, +/- 2-3-4 weeks.
---
I mean even tanking in dungeons through leveling the problem isn't being tanky, it's ability to hold aggro and generate threat. Arms is imo way better even if you wanna tank a lot of dungeons. Ability to solo stuff? I can't believe you can kill mobs 1-on-1 more effectively than a DPS build.
---
This, it really isnt as intensive as some people make it out to be. If you are not the one to clear DM it isnt bad at all, 
---
Looking at this from a horde standpoint pre ZG
---
Land in feralas, takes 5 min to get to dungeon, walk through it and teleport out with a mage portal to org, takes about another 5 min. Logout and mess around on a alt, or just waste 5-10 min of your DM buff not the biggest deal really. Log on to get org buffs and fly to Felwood takes again like 5 min, grab songflower together and hearth to kargath, walk to BRM together.
---
get a good chair rated for 8 + hours, pay well for it your back will thank you. I am also suffering from a bad back, with the right chair sometimes one or two of my fingers i use on the mouse go kinda numb. Once I changed from a "gaming chair" to an office ergonomic 8 + hour rated chair my situation has improved and i dont suffer from any back pain at all.  
---
Best of luck.
---
I just recovered my account a few days ago. They didn't even ask any question I just told them the name of my character and the realm I was on, expecting an response where they ask some questions for details but they Just responded with we added it to your account. Fucking awesome.
---
Blizzard's Customer service for WoW is exceptional.
---
I recovered my account that was hacked in 2010. After it happened I just let it rot as I had no intention of playing anyway. Figured it'd be best locked since I had no interest.
---
Contacted blizzard 2 months ago and they were very quick in helping me recover the account. All of my characters were stripped, but it is what it is. I can't see myself playing the game as it has become so it doesn't matter.
---
Feel free to post your own data! It's pretty hard to compile an extensive video since almost all source material is 240-480p, and it takes a lot of context to understand whether it was lag from the player, lag from the server or leeway.
---
80% dropout in 30 days?
---
You are crazy. It will be under 30%.
---
Yet youre willing to level a new character on classic the same way you did all your characters on retail
---
Thank you for the answer. I’ll go for the mining/skinning until 40 mount
---
Id be really happy if we never saw a Wrath server ever again. The death of WoW.
---
I see. Thanks for the explanation as I was unaware of those numbers. However, wasn't the plan to reduce layering after phase 1? So the stress would increase over time if they did this right? Assuming playerbase remained steady.
---
Ironforge 100%
---
I would not have a Problem with that. People should be able to Play what they want to Play.
---
Shortly after classic sounds very unreasonable. Give them time. Especially since you want BC and WOTLK BOTH shortly after classic :D Don't be a greedy f*cker - you can't Play all at the same time anyway...
---
The Argument you made with "BC had more Players than Classic" and "Wotlk had more players than BC" is not a fair Argument. The game didn't grow because the Players thought it was better... New Players joined because it was WoW and not because they thought "ohh this Expansion Looks better than classic WoW I´m gonna buy it now" xD You see how funny your Argument sounds? :D
---
But yeah... Unreasonable but I wouldn't be mad if they did it
---
not at all
---
My hope is that people will jump to classic, bring friends just from word of mouth, and then the larger portion of the classic population will become login raiders in retail as they start to notice all of the little differences in what caused millions of people to fall in love with the game ages ago.
---
I hope this also helps to guide Blizzard in future development and changes for retail wow. At the Cataclysm launch, they did something that is never a good idea. They tried to fix what wasn't broken. The game didn't go from 10 million players to 12 million during Wrath because people wanted the game to change. 
---
They have a lot of data collected over a decade and a half and a lot of information on what worked and what didn't. Hopefully this will bring about positive changes.
---
Eh. I see what you are saying, but I disagree. When I see people saying the cute little Blizzard scripted messages for ggez I assume that person is trying to be a dick. People that aren't trying to be assholes usually just say GG or don't say anything. 
---
I guess it's not universal either way.
---
Haha
---
So you mean it's fine because they are limiting them? But classic won't do that if it's strictly #nochanges. World buffs will be available right at the opening of MC and that's a problem I'm my mind.
---
Wait what?
---
You're in the extreme minority on this one, so I highly doubt it.
---
Already reported on the [Beta Bugs/Problems Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bp61yw/beta_bugsproblems_megathread_report_issues_here/) (check the google sheets, especially the *Confirmed Mechanic Explanations* bottom tab). It seems that leeway is still bugged on the beta atm, hope blizzard correct it before launch.
---
Thanks a lot for this. I’ll do it this way

---
okay boomer..
---
&gt; Factions breaking apart
---
Ewww. Glad you aren't running the game, that shit sounds retarded. Warcraft is about Humans, and about Orcs, and about Humans and Orcs hating each other.
---
I was joking :( it was a reference to an April's fools in which they said an expansion for a game was coming, that also had the HOTS letters.
---
Roll mage and find out; it's clear you never played one.
---
Yeah, because it's a massive pain in the ass unlike anything else in the game. Like the OP described. RNGing a good buff and then keeping your character logged out for days is not a test of skill or really good for the game in any way.
---
As long as voice of the articles stay within classic wow. The Booty Bay Times loves good writers.
---
Pm me.
---
Yeah, I don’t plan on progressing my toons. With classic being announced I just wanted to log in and soak up that nostalgia for an afternoon haha
---
Its a stupid decision by blizzard imo, gnome can be a warrior but a man cant be a hunter, wtf
---
oh sure all this should be considered for hardcore cutting edge raiders. by all means take the top 1% push for gear and all that jazz. But at what point does it become trivial? Will the raids be as strict August 27 2020? how about 2023? This game is the game we will play possibly forever and to think the strict raid requirements will remain after a year or two or five or 10 is just ignorant. Sure you all hate the boomkin and enh shaman August 27 2019 because he doesnt help you achieve your goal of world first, but at some point your goals will be compete and your guild will break up or people will get tired of the same raids or same classes or same mechanics, eventually.  Some day, at some magical moment one of these off spec players might get selected as a tag along because you cleared the raid years ago back in 2019 on your main and now are just looking for a competent warm body dps to fill the raid.
---
Has this been tested or is it a pserver thing?
---
By the time they come around there's gonna be pug groups for Mc, Onyxia and maybe even BWL. Like there were in vanilla. Who wants to spend 500g on an item, which becomes obsolete the second you drop i to MC and get loot?
---
It is content, content most people will never do. 
---
Im not part of the no changes crowd, that's just silly in my book, that repeat the exact same mistakes.
---
that HotS logo on the tabards kinda ruins it
---
World buffs will be as available as they were in retail. You're not going to get an ony or nef head at the opening of MC and rend buff is pretty shit.
---
But yeah I always considered the dm 15% hp a bit op. Moreso than 3% crit anyway.
---
+1 for shadow priests!
---
We're full!
---
I simply pointed out that the current screenshot comparisons haven't been very convincing because a lack of care was taken when creating them. The fact that if you overlay them side by side the whole scene mismatches, means we cannot draw a very good conclusion about Gnome/Tauren's relative sizes.    
---
I have no idea if they're bigger/smaller, but nobody else seems to either. I don't think creating consistent screenshots is particularly difficult or time consuming, and I expect we'll have that sooner or later.
---
Honestly I'd like to see the dark portal not open at the end of classic.  I would really like them to split the time line and go a different route.  Going to BC will take us out of the world again which is something a lot of players don't want to do.
---
Add the RNG, and a casual guild that will start MC one month after release (casual players will hit 60 in one month or more), will need 3 more months for gearing up. And that is 4 months. AND that is if they clear MC every single time...which they won't. They will maybe have it on farm after 4-5 weeks of tries. 
---
They are casual, you know...
---
So, for MOST players, first phase have PLENTY of content even if it lasts 6 months. For others, less than 3 months. Expect a median 4 months duration per phase.
---
Cystal water? That's a picture I didn't need.
---
Ok, thanks
---
huge AGAINST warriors for a lot of classes, 5-8 kiting does not exist with this kinf of leeway
---
Holy shit this is next level haha.
---
**__What stats do I prioritize__**
---
440 defense is not neccessary for 99% of fights. Focus on a solid mix between threat and avoidance, looking especially at stam, armor, strength and agility. Remember that the limiting factor in vanilla is threat, not surviving - discuss your gear with your officers to ensure you arent gimping your raid. If playing alliance, remember that kings boosts stats by a significant amount along with ZG buff, so raw stats are quite useful.
---
Enchants should be the ZG Idol enchant in 99% of cases. If you feel that you can afford to drop the defense and HP (You are DWing most of the time) then put strength.
---
**__What does Defense do__**
---
Defense adds 0.04% block, dodge, chance to be missed, and parry, along with 0.04% reduced chance to be crit. It does *NOT* reduce the chance of a crushing blow.
---
well said, and thank you for the breakdown.
---
This seems condescending somehow.       
---
It's not like common sense just goes out the window when you play retail.
---
It's not about reliving old memories, it's about creating new ones.
---
Down ranking was still heavily utilized in Black Temple as a Holy Paladin ...
---
Did those jeans drop in Naxx? Cuz that ass is epic
---
You will, but every DPS rotation is significantly less complex than Retail.
---
Just remember, raids before babes.
---
There are other days to die as a warrior than just accidentally pulling more mobs then you can handle. Leveling in a level appropriate zone plays a part. Getting critted 3 times in a row can kill you, miss/dodge/parry/miss/parry can kill you, fleeing mobs can kill you, being undergeared can kill you. Warrior is a class that dies more than others while leveling, it's a fact of life.
---
Lmao. Why would they put a system back in that almost nobody wants? To please you? Just like your answer shows, you're incredibly selfish and egotistical.
---
What does a mechanical keyboard have to do with not having to spam the key?
---
Its about hitting as fast as you can with fire dmg spells/items using the stacking the debuff from the Arcanite Dragonling pet.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbmzehXURHs&amp;t=3s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbmzehXURHs&amp;t=3s)
---
I'm still treating Sunken Temple ptsd I've had since vanilla. It's hard to convince me to go in there. haha
---
heal per second
---
You don't need to worry about armor at all because it comes with your gear.  And ever upgrade will have additional armor on it.  You do not need to think about it at all.
---
Defensive points though, it is important to be capped and I forget what the cap value is.  Going above the cap has extremely nominal gains so have just enough is perfect.  Then you focus on stam, parry, block, dodge, etc.  But being defense capped means that raid bosses cannot crit you.  That is pretty much mandatory.  So your pre-raid gear should be focused around getting the def cap and nothing else.
---
10 levels higher, whirlwind axe is obtainable at 30. It's also tuned as a lvl 40 item because that's when the quest is supposed to be completed.
---
Please quote this definition of harder with soure.
---
In my opinion at least WSG should be available right at the start. The occasional BG while leveling is so fun. Who cares what the progression was actually like in vanilla. BGs was added late because they realized it was a good idea to add after some time. 
---
Is there any good reason why PvP and BGs are delayed in classic other than "that's how it was in vanilla"?
---
I’ve got blessing of protection baby!!
---
I love you
---
The buff should disappear when you enter an instance.
---
It’s all about spell and wand usage. Just finished a 60 mage and working on another around 16 now. On the 16 I drink every 6-8 kills which isn’t bad at all. 
---
If you level with a priest, you won’t drink until you pull wrong.
---
As you level you get Clear Casting which is huge
---
As a mage, it’s ok to take some damage and not blow your whole mana pool avoiding it. You can eat and drink at the same time. Better to do that when both health and mana are at 30% than when health is 95 and mana is 10.
---
speak for yourself.
---
Deus Vult is for you.  We raid Friday and Saturday from 11pm to 3am (Max) EST.  DM me for more details!
---
The goal was to get defense something around 440 which eliminates the possibility of being crit by the boss (which can one shot your tank, and wipe your raid).
---
These are amazing! Great work :)
---
Yeah ill play one character on classic. Two max. I have never been an altoholic I like you think it's bad for the game . I just think the fact in recent expansion NOT having an army of alts is a huge disadvantage especially gold wise is shit and hurts the game .
---
I much prefered life until cata when I barely had time to have a holy priest alt but I still had plenty to do on my main. Lfr streamlined the end game to a point that that's all some people do. People get max level,  go lfr,  get bored because lfr is shit ,  then they quit .
---
Imo that killed the game more than  heirlooms
---
For many players this might be true, but I would still keep in mind, that you might wonder after some time at level 60: "Why does this other rogue better in PvP against other rogues and warriors than me? Oh because of stone form..." or "Why is this guys dps higher than mine? Oh because of the human sword specialization..." It\`s just something I would relly keep in mind, not to be upset afterwards by the choices you make on your race.
---
I think he's referring to people that constantly leave groups, or play poorly with others in general. I didn't make blacklists or anything, but I do clearly remember avoiding certain people based on having bad experiences with them over and over.
---
This was, of course, before server mergers when the people on your server were contained. You could absolutely have a bad name on your server.
---
"I got what you need!"
---
Even so.  10 levels is a pretty big deal.
---
Blizzard’s clearly done some research to suggest no more than 1/4 of the players at launch will be playing 2-3 months later. Otherwise we’ll have long queue times, just like the days of old.
---
First off holy paladins never really benefited from downranking like other healers did. So yes downranking was used as an auto attack simply because they had no out of cast Regen. However, after the 2.0 change to plus healing there was no efficiency gain by downranking due to a heavy penalty.
---
Ya that's true. I'm not sure why it's this difficult to take at least similar screenshots.
---
People are digging up old vanilla screenshots etc. All we have to do is compare the beta to BFA. It should be very easy to make a similar shot, like you said. 
---
Oh well we will just wait for the next thread about this very topic to pop up. Maybe the next guy will get closer.
---
When you take "The best defense is offence" a little too close to heart and stick axes all over your armor.
---
But no it wasn’t it was changed and nerfed to base health in wotlk. It was too strong in TBC.
---
It's listed under confirmed game mechanic, and, while technically true, it wasn't a game mechanic in vanilla.
---
Hi, nice post,  
---
Could you tell me the addons you use?  
---
I would like to save them for later.  
---
Get a gang of paladin together in a dungeon. They won't die but won't kill anything.
---
I think BC/Wrath are likely better choices than classic but from a business point of view it really doesn't make sense to realease all 3, especially at the same time.
---
Food buffs, Elixirs/potions, weapon-stones/windfury and flasks are enough to clear anything in this game. World buffs are overkill unless you're going for speed clears.
---
Just watched that for the first time and it was amazing.
---
course they are. Just like they tested one elite mob (ogre boss from DM) and assumed every single mob has the correct damage values. Amazing.
---
nope, heirlooms killed the game more
---
 they would of made alts with or without heirlooms, but having heirlooms made low level pvp trash because of heirloom users
---
&gt; World PvP? People dedicate entire raidnights and ambushes just to strip the opposition of their buffs and making the instance they are about to run 2x harder and longer.
---
Sounds like I know what my and my felhunter will be doing
---
Rule 2.
---
SM more like S&amp;M
---
Did you try googling that error code? There seems to be a fix.
---
Yeah honor is being added in phase 2, so probably something like 4-6 months in? And then WSG and AV aren't being added until phase 3 which will be even further away. We don't know yet how long the phases are. Then AB gets added in phase 4.
---
&gt; I don’t want a guild with world firsts and 20 hours uptime. Those two are mutually exclusive. World first is a 40-80 hour uptime thing.
---
I just pulled a random number out of my ass, don't read too much into it.
---
For the rest of your comment:
---
&gt; I just want to enjoy the game not play past it.
---
Then don't worry about other priests. On one hand you seem unhappy with the healer role in general, not the fact that priest is oversaturated (which it isn't).
---
Just because you couldn’t or didn’t find a group means little. Your friends waiting on a tank means little. I have guildies that push m+, and some will wait inordinate amounts of time for a good group of people with similar/better experience. That doesn’t mean the game is dying.
---
In just saying that your argument of everyone would be happy is wrong.
---
Eww gross. I couldn’t imagine anything worse than having to choose between playing classic for the first time in 15 years and playing Bc for the first time in 12. 
---
You are very much in the minority wanting Bc and (lol) Wrath before this classic experience is done.
---
lol at the 2 votes for Darnassus
---
idk if they have these voices in classic, but the way the goblins sounded in wotlk was so great. i thought the cata update ruined them, especially females
---
&gt;RNGing a good buff and then keeping your character logged out for days is not a test of skill or really good for the game in any way. 
---
Guilds just drop thier own heads for this buff and scout out the songflower
---
As a kid I always pronounced it as 
---
CHA- like cha sound in chap stick
---
Pew- like pew pew 
---
Chapew
---
Um I had a 5 man in SM with 4 warriors and a priest. It was amazing. Cleave for days! CC just meant Constant Cleave. If your health dropped below 50%, Prot stance and put your shield on. It was amazing.
---
*bless you
---
For every non speaking german
---
Forest Bracers of the Monkey I believe. 4 agi, 4 Stam
---
We used to grief people on purpose all through vanilla and it never negatively affected us in anyway. Even in a single server, there’s just too many people to notice.
---
It was. Still neat though.
---
Hard to abide by that rule when single digit IQ users decide to chime in.
---
Do gotta farm rep for 15 AGI though =/
---
Yeah, the high honor gear is too OP to add that early. Needs to come in at the same time as BWL.
---
There's an argument for honorless BGs, but I'm not sure how many people would bother and how many would just *constantly* complain that they're pointless and beg Blizz to add honor.
---
They can fit sure, at the cost of about half your screen's worth of vision.
---
The picture is big and makes it seem like you actually might have a bit more vision than you'd think but once you scale it down to the size of your screen you can see that the small area of vision you have left is the size of 4 coins side by side, this is basically called tunnel vision with zero chance of seeing anything around you.
---
The raid frames share the same issue that ur abilities have, even worse tbh, with them being glued to each other the odds of a regular thumb hitting the wrong frame is high, you cant expect to spot heal like this.
---
Finally, plz show me where you'd place your threat meter/ hots/dots tracker or any addon that requires space, you can't use any other addons that need space because you have none left unless you want to use the last spot of vision ( if it can even be called that at this point).
---
I just don't see this as a feasible way of playing classic tbh, in fact it's not meant to be played on a phone , at best you can use it to check the auction house or fish but anything outside that would be highly unlikely to deliver satisfying results to either the player or the people in their group.
---
He is poking fun at duo leveling warrior or a 5 man of warrior only... there is a key word in your statement "priest"
---
nO cHaNgES
---
Login servers have been down.
---
I'm a #NoChange but i hope this is gonna fix. When you jump from a balcony it's ok but when it make the mobs run away for a tiny border it's "stupid" and nearly a bug.
---
It was also before cross-server dungeons, BG's, and/or a LFG tool.
---
If you wanted to do a dungeon, you would broadcast it in general chat in IF/Org.
---
People are going to start noticing that one guy constantly spamming "59 HUNTER LFG UBRS!"
---
smh. And Humans consider themselves "civilized." Letting a child live such a life on the streets, stealing from his peers.
---
When a Horde child develops a drug habit, we just eat them.
---
i dont even know what i am looking in that pic
---
I prefer to kill things as fast as I can. Bite I believe is the highest DPS per focus point. Bite is better for PvP, because you want to do burst dmg in PvP.
---
Rules aren't adhered to lol, they say no low effort posts and look at this place.

I really like this one actually, just make them behave like debuffs would still allow for people to use them, but remove the whole buff-saving meta.
---
Excellent contribution.
---
They would probably have to edit the terrain rather than fix pathing since changing pathing would probably not be easy to do without side-effects.
---
It is not stupidity at all,  here is the place to put questions and comments.I can comfortably say I have not spend my years . But, according to my opinion, rogue is cool but once you spot them, freeze-n-nova with ice mage would be "shocking".

For some reason when I was scrolling through I thought this was a cake until I double taked.

For anyone who wanted to see the clip of Tipsout saying hes a good dueller

Hmm I guess then. Someone may well beat you to it though, and it has a cd now.
---
Warriors get many more relevant quest rewards from gear while leveling.
---
By all means, find an Alliance one-handed sword from a quest reward anywhere in between Wetlands and Badlands. 
---
Warriors get so many good quest rewards while leveling to keep their gear current. For example the elite quests in Duskwood give a warrior a 2-hander better than Smite's and his first helmet. Rogues get literally nothing useful from those elite quests... or from quests in general. If you want gear upgrades you have to hit the auction house, hope there's something there, and hope you can still afford your mount.
---
\^ This. Blizzard is doing maintenance on both live WoW servers and their login servers, so it may be down until like 1 PM PST or something. Likely has something to do with the big DDoS or whatever happened last week when nobody could log into Battle.net.
---
I stand corrected
---
It's funny, cause all of the gladiators on my server in TBC farmed the arena for the trinket &gt;.&gt;
---
I have no idea why, but i miss hit cap.  It seems like an annoying thing, but i guess it was just something to work for.  
---
Also, you mentioned running heroics for that trinket drop you want.  I had completely forgotten about it, but man i farmed The Black Heart (i think thats the name, from the 5 man ToC dungeon) on 2-3 alts for quite a while because it was pretty damn good.  Though i dont remember if that was from the normal or heroic version.
---
I just realized i dont think i know the name of a single trinket from BfA.  My memory is shit, but i dont know if i remember any from the last xpac, either.  I think the last trinket i remember (not sure when it was from) was something from the end of some xpac or another that...gave a stacking haste buff i think?  Might have been class specific.  Compare that with Wrath (when i started) and there was the Black Heart (only used that on alts), Muradins Spyglass, Phylactery of the Nameless Lich, and probably a couple others i could think of if i spent enough time on it.  I remember the icon for at least one or two healing ones, too.
---
Man, about the only item i even remember the name of that from BfA is the Crown of Oppulence, (sp?) simply because it has a conjured item you can make.
---
I will say, on some classes, with no BoA gear, help from alts, etc you can still get a bit of that 'danger' from not pulling extra shit, having to team up, etc.  Its not as hard, but you can at least get a slight sense of it.  Granted, its more about not being annoyed and having to use your skillset to run away and reset vs dying, but its something.  You'll probably never get that with BoAs, though.
---
Being able to switch talents on the fly and take out the 'fluff' seemed like a nice idea, but it really does feel bad to go 15 levels without *anything*, or perhaps one or two things (getting mastery for some classes is a nice damage boost, but it doesnt change anything/feel better to play).  I miss putting talent points in.  Its something that i 'shouldnt' miss, but i do.  It just felt right.
---
I usually look for wow classic playlists in spotify when i get "the sug"
---
I can’t fucking see what OP is talking about
---
Don't forget juju's, Blasted Lands buffs, valentine chocholate, scrolls and pledge of loyalty buffs ;)
---
This is perfect. So much memories, listening this playlist and remembering all those videos!
---
Dwarf pally unkillable by any rogues.

Downvoting it to oblivion gets the job done in most cases.

I think it was lore based
---
Hey, a lot of NPC/Quest info comes from using the Wowhead Client specifically for Classic. Using Blizzard data, we can get item stats and spell descriptions in advance, but things like NPC locations, Quest descriptions, maps (and a bunch of other stuff) require people to complete the quest and then upload data. I'd imagine not too many people have done that level 30 quest yet so we don't have a ton of data for faction updates.
---
You can get the client here and read more about some of the other parts of the site requiring the client: https://classic.wowhead.com/news=291862/classic-wowhead-client-working-submit-your-user-data-for-site-npcs-and-quest-inf
---
I'm sorry, sir, but we're out of chicken. How about some ice?
---
you do realize the alliance players in this clip stole a horde strategy to complete the dungeon, right? They would have probably flopped around like a fish out of water without stealing the ooga gang strategy.
---
&gt;1. Worldbuffs trivialize already trivial content
---
If I'm doing Mc for the 50th time on the server I don't see why world buffs to speed dps up is a bad thing. You can't argue it trivalizes things if they are already trivial. World buffs adds a completley unique mechanic to vanilla, and that is zero death runs which adds excitement from clearing old raids again, completely organic unlike things like wrath undying titles
---
&gt; 2. Worldbuffs will be available in classic, day one, every single raid, trivializing progression, which is something pservers didn't
---
I agree which is why I support the pserver way of removing worldbuffs inside new raids for the first month for proper blizzlike progression. Maybe there's a better way like you have to kill last boss 4 times i don't know. 1 month of no worldbufs is very simple and does the job just fine imo.
---
&gt;3. Timers won't help a damn thing, they will only make it a much bigger pain in the ass to get worldbuffs, and all the more infuriating to lose them
---
Yes I agree which is I think the no cooldown system on pservers is way way better, that's why the cooldowns was removed in the first place, for better gameplay.
---
&gt;4. Worldbuffs breeds a toxic raid atmosphere
---
Sorry what? How?! Sounds like you were just in a toxic guild that did worldbuffs and you blame it on the buffs instead of the toxic players
---
&gt;Ganking and WPvP with the specific intent of stripping someone's buffs is AIDS
---
WHAT? Are you out of your fucking mind? Pvp is pvp and is good. Adding some extra modivation is not a bad thing. That's like saying "wpvp for ranking is TOXIC!!" Sounds like someone needs to get back on a PVE server, because world buff pvp is one of the best things about pservers, it produces the most amazing pvp events.

---
As for what to do. Honestly it's hard to say. I like the way pservers do it, but then again they are pservers and I doubt people would be happy with blizzard inspiring from them. As for removing them, hell fucking no, I refuse to farm molten core for 2 fucking years if I don't have some wbuffs to speed things along. Lastly there's the no changes which I'm also happy with. The only downside is raid progression with worldbuffs and for that well... Naxx was cleared within 2 hours on pserver launch, AQ within 1½. I've cleared all but naxx countless times I really wouldn't mind it was just no changes.
---
Because at the end of the day Classic is a very incomplete game.
---
Hybrids get a lot better in the next few expansions by which time Blizzard have had enough time and data to tweak them properly.
---
&gt; Lastly, we don't know exactly how powerful world buffs will be. We don't know how they all stack, ps just guessed at it. 
---
This is untrue, we have video from vanilla, they stacked, the values were recorded, on multiple sites.
---
People won't be logging for a week to save a buff, there isnt a reason to, if a guild requeiers a head drop buff for a raid they do it together.... if they need a songflower, they go together... idk why people think you need to get all these buffs solo then log out.
---
Yes, it appears blizzard forgot to invite me to the beta.  Unlucky
---
Take your real name off your btag?
---
its not important to be capped
---
Op farmers, you're right. Anything below 50g and I'm not moving my character. Anything below 1g and I'm not even pressing the portal or conjure food button.
---
Could be :D
---
Bad maths and pulling numbers from thin-air. Good job!
---
I would swipe right
---
I also listen to it at work. It’s great - I also really enjoy the WoTLK album. My favourite from classic is ‘Elwynn Forrest’ and from wrath its mTotems of the Grizzlemaw’
---
Dun Morogh, Elwynn Forest, Barrens, Desolace, and STV soundtracks throw me right back to being 11 years old again in 2005. I'm going to be BLASTING the game music when I log into Classic. So very excited.
---
2 weeks work vacation approved, gf has also been notified and respects my wishes to only be available for quickis no forplay in those 2 weeks.
---
i hope ill manage it to 60 in that time
---
If you are spamming sunder you are globals capped. 
---
Revenge 5 second cd better threat than sunder 
---
Shield block 5 second cd used on cd especially when bosses hit hard enough to rage cap you
---
Instant ability 6 second cd better threat generation 
---
When are you fitting in all these sunders you have to spam to hold threat on a boss?
---
I'm not going to say you're wrong, but you're making an assumption that they are making an assumption. Not exactly conclusive. Supposing they have done research, what could they really gauge that off of anyways? I guess my point is they could realistically have more than one of each realm type per region at launch to circumvent this problem. It would make more sense to launch with more servers, and if as you suggest 3/4 of the playerbase quits, then merge the servers at that point.
---
Whoa dude in all seriousness you should get that checked a doctor.
---
I knew someone whose left arm became numb one day and it progressively got worse. The culprit was their nerves in their spine, it had become swollen which disturbed the surrounding nerves which caused other problems like making half of their body feeling numb
---
Becareful!
---
How did that work for the items you got? Did you lose them if you lost the rank?
---
Beautiful, thank you
---
I always thought this was due to the lag (I'm EU, so playing on beta server from US brings normally higher with you).
---
This made harmstring/weapon swing peel impossible and not efficient at all.
---
zzzzzzzz
---
man its sad how wrong everyone here is, you prioritize threat, since almost all dps will be trying to do more damage very week
---
The only thing that ever takes priority is resist gear for fights that require it.
---
I said questing is a lot more difficult in classic, especially the first 20 levels. You have elite quests and people are still wearing white gear.
---
Your quality of group absolutely went down. There may have been a lot of people to group with, but the good ones definitely avoided you.
---
How do we know about the cd?
---
I prefer her original outfit, idk why they replaced her tabard with a solid red hanging cloth
---
On pservers you can dodge projectiles with fd, might be different in classic though
---
People have different definitions, really. Can’t really say one is wrong and another is not.
---
That was supposed to be RFD not BFD
---
When servers go live, before starting to level my main, I’m logging on my char that is going to be my lvl 19 twink and run to the arena to farm the crates :D
---
There's a little yellow box in the top right of the launcher that indicates there is a scheduled downtime.
---
/u/rollme
---
[[1d20]]
---
No, because the private servers are running a different client. There would need to be a private server that can run off the beta client.
---
I used to love twinking, but as I grew up, my feelings have changed on it. You're essentially setting up for being able to gank in battlegrounds. Fighting on even grounds has just consistently proven to be the better option for all in my experience, instead of being fun at the cost of other peoples enjoyment. Its not cheating, but its certainly not a fair competition. Twinks dont want to fight twinks, they just want to smash people that stand no chance, not because they're worse players, but because they didn't spend hundreds of gold on boosting their power levels way out of what was intended.
---
Angry blueberry
---
I suppose that's a valid argument. Maybe a solution would be to have honor and wsg at start but wait with PvP rewards untill phase 3.
---
I know that's not gonna happen I just feel it's too bad not being able to play wsg at 19, 29 etc with my main and that I have to wait so long for one of the most fun aspects of the game.
---
I lost all of my screen shots, but I think my favorite place that I ever got to was on the scaffolding/ledges that lined the top of the mage quarter in IF.
---
I expect the online gaming scene as a whole has changed.  People are going to do this more than you remember for two reasons.  1) You just don't remember the times people did this in vanilla as well as you do the times they didn't.  2) They really will be doing it more.
---
Today's gaming has been much less committal and much less personal. The worst days of general chat back in the day will be your average Tuesday.  People will be more loot focused.  Every 5man warrior will want to reserve half the drops in the instance for themselves and refuse to run any more after they've got their loot.  People will leave anything the second things don't go their way.  They will blame everyone else for problems, regardless of who or what the problem was, without any attempt to solve the problem otherwise.  Every request for help will be met with "what's in it for me?". 
---
This is just what it's like today.  But that's just my opinion, I'm an optimist.
---
So you're gonna do that at lvl 1-2? You're crazy!
---
That's a good point! That should still be a part of those Race numbers, of course, but yeah. Some are forced to play in those zones!
---
The name reservation thing is 2 weeks before launch, you'd assume they're doing that in-client, so you should be able to at least install them even if you can't tweak them in-game yet.
---
get rid of the shadow priest, pick another holy/rdruid/mage/lock

---
They said they you wount be able to right-click and add people to bnet that are a different faction from you in classic. You'll be able to talk to people from the other faction that you already have on bnet, but there is  no way of adding them ingame unless you already know  their bnet ID.
---
As for the instances, yeah that's what mages do. Every-class has something unique. I'm sorry AoE control is what mages get, I guess?
---
As for the duel tournament - anyone who has watched it can tell you many other classes could have easily won it. Also it's the player winning more than the class.
---
The issue is that with 40 people you can cover pretty every job already. 
---
Hybrids become strong when there is content for a limited amount of people that need to cover a very wide range of specialized jobs.
---
 Think of how the current dungeon design is 1 tank, 1 healer and 3 DPS. That is codified in numerical tuning by Blizzard. You need at least 1 tank and you the damage taken can be healed by 1 healer. There aren't dungeon that require 2 tanks and 2 healers.
---
In PVE hybrids don't bring value in being a hybrid because that flexibility isn't needed. Hybrid classes are brought as specialized to a specific role and brought because their class has some specific utility that is useful like a battle rez.
---
Same here lol. It’s funny you’ll both have a little stand off to make sure each other is chill and then go on with your business. I’ve barely had people under 40 gank me.
---
Yes, apparently it's forbidden to love old games and you may only play the newest version of everything.
---
Guess I have to stop playing Morrowind along with many other old games and play the new one instead because "Nostalgia" is forbidden.
---
Let's ignore the fact that maybe they are just the superior games.
---
If this was the old Blizzard, pre-Activision, I would agree with you.
---
There is no single answer for this. You use different gear sets for different encounters. The levers you are moving are defense, armor, avoidance, hp pool, threat (hit, AP, crit), resistances. Get as much gear covering these stats as possible, install outfitter, and learn how to tailor your sets for different encounters. This meta optimization game is what makes tanking so much fun in classic, imo.  It takes a long time for any arrangement of tanking gear to devolve into ‘BiS’ for all encounters. 
---
If you’re just asking about talents in the defense tree, I would say always get the armor buff 5/5 and get the defense buff only to the extent your gear leaves you needing the +defense.  If you’re raid tanking in progression you’ll probably want the +defense talent.
---
What? Are you saying you should be running damage gear to improve your heroic strikes for the minimal extra threat you'll generate from that?
---
Thank you for the info!
---
There going to be a lot of gears lvl 19. I have no interest in stomping lowbees. Why should I when I could stomp every low level with my main? I’m just interested in dueling ppl with a was jiggle level and doing some battleground against other geared lvl 19 chars :)
---
Haha I hear you, but I've played a healer for over a decade and sometimes you just can't outheal stupid.
---
If this bug stays, I’m out. Hunter is hard enough with dead zone aids
---
Tell that to the ret paladin's that cleared naxx and the frost mages that cant
---
We need that Dreadnaught super STAT my friend.
---
Think I called it a sharpie do I didn't embarrass myself, it's just as bad as saying it wrong
---
No. Different client and different addons. You can do it during one of the stress tests if you get in.
---
I dont know man, anyone can train a dog and learn how to hunt.
---
I'm sure it was confirmed somewhere it'll be on a multi hour cd. Similar to black lotus.
---
I really never saw Cata as any kind of downfall, everything they implemented in Cata was introduced in WotLK. Heroic raids (that were absolute jokes), phased linear quests, badge gear, dungeon finder, threat no longer really being a mechanic, AoE grinding heroic dungeons. People complain about the trimmed down talent trees and skills, but the root of the problem was all the overpowered abilities introduced in WotLK that rendered the older abilities obsolete, the problem was already present, they just came up with the worst possible solution that neither improved or worsened the situation.
---
I was really only angry with Cata because they made promises of great sweeping changes (like trimming the talent trees and skills being a great idea, but they trimmed all the abilities that might require skill and kept the facerolling abilities instead), but really they only furthered themselves on the path that WotLK laid out.
---
"Walk back idiot"
---
Yes of course, otherwise the crate will be farmed when all ppl reach that level haha
---
You're such a slowpoke you should have jumped on that hate bandwagon 3 weeks ago...
---
Minimum of 4 layers per realm going to 1 layer per realm means Blizzard believes 3/4 of the population won't be playing. It's not an assumption.
---
Some guy said something and you care?  I'm the best druid world, where's my post?

---
You should cut it after first "no kappa". It would fit your agenda better. The second time he repeated it and started chuckling, he made it an obvious sarcasm.
---
Yep. My point being - world buffs aren't necessary for clearing and guilds that will require them are going to be neckbeard / poopsock tier in terms of commitment.
---
Can you quantify the significance of "original timers"?  I don't remember what they were.
---
You’re a nobody and nobody cares what you think.
---
Because it had a CD in actual vanilla.
---
Note to self: 
---
name gnome mage Omegawolf, never play it. 
---
You're in.
---
It was a 5% of the stam after gear additives. This was part of why Horde druid tanks were so strong in TBC, because the Tauren racial played perfectly into their high health.
---
Mount requirements were changed to level 30 in TBC if I remember correctly.

Thank you! Looks like a day 1 thing then.

Thing is wow mobile is not inherently bad. If you could play wow at its peak on your tablet or switch why would that be bad.
---
Nothing about how wow has been designed is ok inherently "mobile" like. Hell if argue by virtue of being a subscription game it's kinda already screwed on that department.
---
I know theres been rumors of FFxiv on the switch and I'd love nothing more!
---
#NeverAgain all rogues get hunters mark dot concuss even if it means certain death for me
---
Well, at least you found the problem.
---
This really sucks for anyone without beta/stress test access. Which is basically everyone :(
---
I’d say 2-3 long raid nights with hard consume requirements and a more serious attitude and skill level makes it hardcore.
---
Most hardcore guilds don’t spend that much time raiding, usually casual guilds spend more, ironically. But it’s the attitude and commitment to learning the bosses, your class, and your raid team that makes a group hardcore.
---
I'm at work so I can't watch, but Tips jokes about his skill at the game all of the time and I'm assuming this video is the same sort of thing. Tips says that other people are better than him all the time.
---
Definitely just stick with what you enjoy. The best ability for most raid leaders is availability. If you can make all of the raid times and don't end up on the floor at the end of the fight more times than not, you're golden.
---
When you say it takes a lot less time the second time around, can you elaborate?
---
Perhaps you're just uninformed.
---
No one cares.
---
Imagine trying to do the hunter bow quest with this mechanic as-is. It will be impossible.
---
I always thought it just expanded when you got more keys indpendent from level, but you linked the patch notes so I'm wrong.
---
Chap-pew
---
Nah, you can't. People would rank and save buttloads of Honor in phase 1 and then just blow it all in phase 3 and have the best gear instantly. Even if the honor decays the rank doesn't, people will farm that lost honor up real quick. The only way they could do it is adding BGs that are purely for fun, which they *could* but likely won't.
---
Like you say, a shame, but at least you can spend a few months prepping by getting all the twink BOEs one way or another.
---
Hmmm, I guess you can use Gnomish World Enlarger, then enter cat form.  That would probably make engineering worth it.  Otherwise, a lot of the benefits of engineering, like grenades and possibly rocket boots, will require you to leave your shapeshifted form...I think.  I'm 90% sure on this but someone can correct me.  
---
You might rather enjoy professions which help supplement your class in other ways, like herbalism/alchemy, or enchanting.  The up side to herbalism is the +15 herbalism racial bonus you get as Tauren.  Alchemy is one of the most useful professions in the game for PvE, enchanting holds the BiS bear trinket, and it's nice being able to enchant stuff.
---
Don't get me wrong, I don't have anything against the streamers. Ultimately, it's up to me if I want to play on the same server that a streamer is playing on. And Twitch chat in general is a bunch of immature idiots with emotes instead of pitchforks. Twitch chat is only the way it is because those kids are hiding behind a chatbox.
---
But the fact that the Ooga brothers are all troll rogues and choose to hunt streamers is hilarious!! It makes my day when I see them ambush-blast some poor soul. Lol.
---
This is the type of world game play / "community involvement" that makes wow so fun. Thanks Ooga Bros!
---
why would that be something new? I'd say it was a 50/50 chance ppl didnt pvp when paths cross back in vanilla. I for one let the cows go. cows were always nice... trolls mostly too. something undead or orc on the other hand... you dont turn your back on an UD or orc unless its an empty husk on the ground.
---
Ah... That's actually a good explanation. A hardcore group might only raid 2 hours a night 3 nights while casual is 3-4, but the hardcore is also grinding out consumables and studying fights.

Spending more time outside the raid than inside it in order to clear it faster is beyond stupid considering how easy everything is. If a raid night is 4 hours long, why would you spend two hours farming buffs and consumables in order to have the raid end one hour faster.
---
ZG/Dragonslayer/Warchief's Blessing were on 6-12 hour cooldowns, meaning that you could turn in the quest and get the item, but the buff would not go out if it was popped within the cooldown.
---
This means guilds can't just pop on demand, but will have to work together or get buffs far in advance.
---
Kk I have no memory of how the CD on those buffs worked and wondered if their was some sort of beta wbuff test or w/e
---
Yeah, most of the duels venruki had in were super close, especially against the shammy and the warlock. Only ez matches were the warrior and rogue. Despite the supposedly broken leeway.
---
You weren't making the argument they were different though, if things that were different couldn't be compared, then nothing could be compared, because everything you might want to compare would be different by definition. Unless you really believe that no comparative examples are ever valid, that doesn't work.
---
You'll have to argue that they're different in a relevant way, specifically as pertains to how they drive market forces, because that was what the example was used for. And that doesn't seem like that's an objective observation in the simple sense you're trying to get away with using common sense for.
---
Sports are different than video games, sure, but toothbrushes and computers are also different, and yet you could still make useful comparative examples about the impacts of innovative technologies on the market, and you couldn't just outsource that to common sense.
---
And I still wasn't trying to guess at your intention, I was describing your behavior. Me doing that is at least as valid of a common sense argument as what you're up to, yet you're refusing me the use of common sense while you want to invoke it yourself.
---
Do you really think we can't describe social behavior without knowing the intent behind it? We can't tell if someone is bullying someone else, or if they're trying to calm someone else down, without knowing their intent?

Also no need for 3 tanks, get one of your fury to have tank gear or if your going to bring a feral druid he will be your third tank. A warlock with improved imp in tank group for buff. Healers need a shaman in their group for totems. Shadow priest also not needed as mentioned and if you must take one, throw him in a random group so he's not taking totem buffs from a mage.
---
Why is this still being posted when Blizzard has already said its due to the client and they are working on it?
---
Curious how this worked with his guild, too, unless it was one of those asshole alpha guilds that just fucked everyone over.
---
A priest can walk on water but Chuck Norris can swim through land.
---
If you're not a bleeding edge guild you're not going to notice the 15 second theoretical difference in boss kill time.  Play what you want.
---
bad bot
---
All of the above really. Also, warriors are very easy to control and manipulate. You might never know what a rogue will do, they have so many tricks up tbeir sleeve, and a good rogue can come out on top in some really bad fights, even 2v1 or 3v1. Meanwhile, if you get 2v1d as a warrior, you pretty much have no hope. You just get slowed, stunned, feared... you have *some* answers to those problems in your toolkit, but it’s a tougher time. 
---
With a pocket healer, and maybe dispels or blessing of freedom, a warrior would be much better than a rogue though.
---
Basicly just *health
---
If you are PvP, do whatever you like. They all have their pvp perks and the theorycrafting difference is smaller than your animation and lore preference.  
---
Very few tanking axes, and the ones that exist are noticably not as good as the swords (much slower, so slower rage).  
---
If you want to DPS, then you have an uphill battle as warrior dps tends to be saturated anyway.
---
It affects you whether you see it or not. I tanked in vanilla. I remembered every person who ninja’d or was just a general asshat. If I got invited into a group and one of them was in it I just left. Quickly followed with a message from the person who invited me. I’d tell them why, get an invite back and sure enough that player wouldn’t be in group.
---
Those people probably never knew why they got removed from the group. Their previous actions affected them. Doubt they thought it did though.
---
Looks like you have fun with the traductions
---
Very interesting.  Ultimately unhelpful for me though =/  Makes me want to go back to a pserver and see if I can find a similar strat for horde that will bypass the den of trials or mulgore.  Cause there's no way anyone's getting to level 5 in an hour doing the newbie zone at launch.
---
Lol... the hype is real. Just chill...
---
I started vanilla like a month or two before TBC talents came out and missed out on all that progression. Looking forward to blowing through it this year. Hopefully I can no life it for a couple weeks to level and get raid ready and find a guild whose schedule lines up with mine. Can't play so much these days without PTO lol
---
The assumption you're making is that they've done research indicating that. Again what would they even gauge that off? I don't see how they could conclusively come to that. They've demonstrated in the past that their assumptions were wrong(what company hasn't?) as well.
---
It was definitely a thing in vanilla and I'm sure if it didn't work in classic we would've heard about it.
---
Well I just saying, I think thats how they explained it. Not that I agree with it. I think the humans had a famous hunter and something happened? So no more hunters? Im fuzzy on it.
---
Or it could be a talent tree lets say for hunters..

You said classic is harder because you have to find groups on your own?  That's the most socially awkward thing I've ever read LOL
---
I would just create a second install of WoW and have one configured for mobile, and one configured for normal PC play.  Can set two separate desktop short cuts as well.
---
I stopped playing after Cataclysm for just this reason. Don't get me wrong, I tried it for a few weeks before cancelling my subscription. Picked it up again at BFA launch and played about a month, then cancelled again.
---
You laugh but I've been downvoted multiple times on this sub because I pointed out that retail gameplay is a lot more in depth than vanilla gameplay.

Ah it's been so long I forgot the ICD.

To be clear, what you're referring to is [Isochrony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isochrony).
---
The gist is, in syllable-timed languages like French, every syllable takes up roughly the same amount of time.
---
In stress-timed languages like English, syllables can have different durations, but the time between stressed syllables is roughly the same, and unstressed syllables are shortened to fit into this rhythm.

No. Once you bought the items while you had the rank you could use them if you lost a few ranks

Questing before sexting.
---
The very short answer is that they can play as hybrids, even in raids.
---
The longer answer, though, is that it's very sub-optimal in any "normal" situation.  Basically, the fights are designed that you won't need that extra on-the-fly tank or spot healing unless things go horribly wrong.  And of course, even when these situations do arise, the hybrid isn't operating at 100% of the capacity of the actual, properly geared and specced tank/healer.
---
I've had a resto druid save us from a wipe by going bear and tanking a raid boss for a few minutes (BWL tank swapping dragon), but considering we'd lost something like 3 off tanks (plus several battle rezes) up until this point, that's just not something you plan around when raiding as a hybrid.  Moments like that are memorable 15 years later because they basically never happened.  More likely, you'll try to be the hybrid hero and the impending wipe will still happen regardless.
---
For what it's worth, hybrids in Classic will absolutely be more capable of flexing in a raid mid-fight than they are in BfA, but that's a low bar.  Barring a niche fight or two that I can't think of off-hand, it will never be optimal, but purely a Hail Mary to prevent a wipe.
---
If it makes you feel better to think that. But I had zero trouble getting a group.
---
The art assets are all client-side.
---
Never count on having service on Tuesdays. Particularily in the AM. Or just follow the cs twitter to check:
---

---
If they never notice than it’s not really hurting them.
---
this is the dumbest possible take you could get from these numbers
---
I don't agree with OP but I really don't think this is correct.
---
Blizzard has way way more information about TBC than they have vanilla, and the fact that they have so far successfully taken a legion client and returned it to vanilla, a lot of the work is already done, now all they need to do is take vanilla and turn it into tbc, which will be a lot easier since there's very few changes and a lot of those changes you already removed from the legion client so you just add them back in, and with all the backup they started doing after vanilla this won't be hard at all. Obviously im oversimplifying massively, it will be challenging but nothing like vanilla, I'd reckon they could do it in like 3 months once the vanilla beta is properly bugtested and fixed.
---
A change.org petition is not evidence of anything. Emerald Dream is one of the most populous realms on retail, and as you pointed out, there is nothing stopping someone who doesn't roleplay from playing on an RP-PVP server.
---
pretty weird how beloved SM is considering it's literally (literally literally) in the tbc style hub area with 3 separate wings that are linear.  i see people shit on tbc loot hallways a ton but SM gets nothing but praise.  really makes you think
---
I hate that Legion gets lumped in with the shitshow that was/is BFA.   I love classic, I'm going to main classic...hell I'm full time raiding on a pserv right now....however, I *adored* Legion as an expansion.  BFA took all the wrong things from Legion and left all the good things.
---
You know im confused too, i keep seeing posts that the game is too fucking easy and that raids are trivialized by world buffs and stuff, but you still say nobody wants to bring some random balance druid? What is going here?
---
Way back in nax 40 we had many of our main raiders roll warlock and level to 20.
---
Why?  So you could sit in WPL by the portal and soulstone your mains.
---
I wouldn't assume that at all. Could be as simple as a web page with a drop down for realms and a fill-in box to type a name.
---
You are very wise. This makes sense. Adding wsg with no reward for it and no ranking does take away some of the fun I agree. I will have to wait and prepare a twink hunter and wpvp with my main in the meantime.

Hybrids absolutely can be hybrids... in solo and dungeons. There are issues in raiding though... every person has to do its job well, and every healer is essentially a hybrid, so they get reduced to their ideal job: healing.
---
But leveling 1-60 and even dungeons or UBRS/ZG is a big part of the game. Just because the really hard content has harder restrictions doesn’t mean you can’t play how you want for 90% of the game.
---
Let’s say you go shaman. You might be healing dungeons more than DPSing, if you’re nice, but you will still be meleeing when you have a moment, dropping totems, slowing people, tanking a mob with your shield if you get healing aggro.
---
Or via versa, if you are DPSing as a shaman, you’re not *just* DPS. You’re still dropping totems appropriate to your groups needs, cleansing debuffs and purging, and throwing out an off-heal when the healer needs some help. 
---
It’s just raiding where you have to do your job and pretty much just that... because there’s 40 people and they have to be managed like sheep to make the team work. But don’t let that stop you from playing a hybrid... they are amazingly fun and versatile for literally everything else.
---
It's also his own profile...
---
This is why the international phonetic alphabet exists!
---
French: /ʃa.po/
---
English: /ʃæˈpoʊ/
---
There is one hunter who tops the dps charts in his guild back on a private server and they are one of the harder classes with rotations
---
Alright, just haven't ever heard of it! Sounded like the mana version of sit-crit macro
---
ill also be  playing from china mate, same dilemma. was hoping there would be enough for a guild of english speakers in china tbh
---
Non-beta server or PIRATE servers?
---
That's my main gripe with OPs point. I agree world buffs are a pain in the ass, but if you're on a PvP server the only redeeming quality they have that actually spices up the world a bit is the extra sense of danger and vulnerability you feel while running from Point A to Point B before you disappear down your rabbit hole full of loot.
---
If anything the conflict that the buffs cause is an argument in favor of their inclusion, not removal.
---
Though IMO you just turn them off in raids and the game is overall improved.
---
once you hit the rank you were able to buy them. if you lost it after, you still were able to keep the items
---
You can collect gear for any priest build in 5 mans and don't underestimate (easy) raid pugging. 20 man raids and  Molten Core will be open for casual players, as people will organize plenty of pug raids for those.  They will provide a veteran main tank + raid leader to make the raid go smoothly.  Usually the catch it that they reserve some stuff for themselves, like Thunderfury bindings and  Zul Gurub Idols but that doesn't affect a casual raider at all, so it's a great opportunity for non raiders to collect some decent entry level epics.
---
Well the video I was referencing in particular was a shaman who had his entire guild helping him out with flasks/buffs/etc,. so it seemed like it took a huge guild effort to get that 25k crit. So yeah you'd be right lol
---
Thank you for your suggestions! I think I’ll make my way to the dwarf starting area and head to Loch Modan later on. It’s okay if the leveling isn’t the greatest, I think we both want to take it slow and just experience the game at our own pace. I kind of like the dwarves more than human, but I just cannot cope with the female dwarf running animation x) thanks again for your time responding :-)
---
As a rule of thumb, the +defense talent is better in the beginning and the +armor talent is better when you have most of the T2 gear.
---
He is referring to the DMF buff. Which can be gotten 1 week a month. So he cannot go reapply it this week. Rather then just raid with one less buff he has decided to spend a week being mad.
---
Non beta server retail players probably don't read this sub, so you are really doing nothing but hiveminding the common jokes and assumptions about what retail players are like.
---
Pretty sure they killed competitive environment.
---
Even Rich went to LoL scene and my irl friends who were competitive also said it was over
---
Of course lol
---
Darnassus.
---
It wasn't the most practical place beyond the fact I just loved haunting the wilds of Winterspring, but my RP guild back then was a Night Elf sentinel style guild so much of the RP I did (which was more than any other game activity besides world pvp) took place there. Good times, good times.
---
It could be, though it'd be pretty weird to login on launch day and see name placeholders with no character, like a "click here to create Thromkar!" button. Could well be, though.
---
&gt; You weren't making the argument they were different though, if things that were different couldn't be compared, then nothing could be compared, because everything you might want to compare would be different by definition. Unless you really believe that no comparative examples are ever valid, that doesn't work.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; You'll have to argue that they're different in a relevant way
---
That's fair. I agree - I probably should have done that if I was trying to win a debate tournament.
---
&gt; And I still wasn't trying to guess at your intention
---
This I don't agree with. You were more than describing my behavior. But I don't think we will get anywhere on this point. We don't know enough about each other to make these kinds of statements. I think my behavior was quite even keeled until people started attacking me and misrepresenting what I was saying.
---
source?
---
&gt; cross-server BG's
---
Cross server BGs are a 1.12 feature and in the classic release.
---
You don't pronounce a /w/ in those words either though. It just indicates a diphthong (an "oh" sound):
---
bow: /boʊ/
---
arrow: /ˈæɹ.oʊ/, /ˈɛəɹ.oʊ/, /ˈɛɹ.oʊ/
---
chapeau:  /ʃæˈpoʊ/
---
Is his toy still a doll?
---
Thanks so much, this is perfect!
---
Maining mage, will be chilling in stormwind in my downtime feel free to approach for food/drink but you have to tell me a joke.
---
"Highest level", as I specified doesn't mean just getting a lazy dmt/head/heart, it means logging out for days and days on DMF. If you are alliance, it involves getting summoned to a safe spot inside Orgrimmar, and being ready on an alt to mindcontrol cap yourself when WCB goes out - something you have no control over so you have to sit there to scout when it's going out, and then quickly log in and MC. If you get a resist, you have to wait all over again. It means keeping track of songflower timers and having summon infrastructure in place to conserve time as much time as possible on buffs.
---
This is the stuff you need to do if you want to bring full worldbuffs, and I don't want that.
---
Admittedly this is terribly selfish - but what is reddit if not a place to vent personal grievances and pass opinions as facts - I don't want this in the game at all, and I won't want it to function the way it does currently, so I don't have to do it. I could choose not to, but I won't, because the system is fundamentally broken.
---
You should prio offensive gear to hit the boss at all
---
Ahh that's cool. No 2 hour AV queues. Any idea on cross-server dungeons?
---
How do you pick which wow folder to launch from on the battle.net launcher?
---
Meaning you know where to go often times for various things while leveling.  You know the layout of the zones and aren't wandering around blind.  If you're doing raiding or dungeons, you know the phases of various fights and fight mechanics in general so less time is spent learning those things.  You generally know gear itemization and how to prioritize. And so on and so on.
---
&gt;There are people out there who rather want to play BC or Wotlk instead of staying in Classic server forever
---
too bad for those people, lol
---
&gt;very little raiding and be mostly in 5 mans
---
You can do that shadow with a healing set of gear.
---
If you're going for the guild main tank slot, you probably won't be able to raid with that schedule. If you're cool with offtank/dps status, you'll probably get a spot in a raiding guild. You just won't be the cornerstone of your guild's raid being able to happen or not. 
---
You'll always be in demand for 5 man / 10 man content, so you'll be very popular among your server's PuG's. If you can find a guild that has a similar schedule as your life allows, you'll be fine. 3 hours a day is just fine as long as you spend your time productively instead of sitting in Ironforge / Orgrimmar BSing with people. People always remember tanks that know what they're doing.
---
Rip.
---
Do the mage you'll have food water and portals.
---
Give it time.
---
This. Which is why I liked the 5 man instances more than raids even though I did not main a hybrid.
---
Nice, I've never tried that
---
WoW Retail has lost a lot of it's subscribers over the years, YES! No doubt about that. It's still by far the biggest MMO out there with FF and ESO. There is big difference between a game being dead and not having as much players as before. The only real problem will be that the current server structure will not work because players are to thin on different servers. But with their sharding tech, they kind of even tackled that issue. 
---
Even if WoW 2.0 comes out (especially if it is not from blizz) , I don't see wow dying in 5+ years.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong or what point I'm missing
---
Thank you :) x
---
Hello.
---
me and my gf are looking for a casual raiding guild, no rush, we want to enjoy the game.
---
Alliance, PvE realm. Thanks &lt;3
---
Greetings, travelers!  
---
I'm a Tank/healer fanatic, started out during classic, but only got my first max level character during the TBC era. I mained a protection warrior back then, but also leveled a hunter and priest to 70 then. I eventually joined an amazing semi-hardcore guild called Hexx, which only focused on the 10 main raids, trying to remain a small but tight-knit family. Eventually, everyone in the guild but me got his amani warbear, because I lost every roll, including during the very last run before the WotLK prepatch that removed the mount from the achievement. But lots of fun was had!  
---
My days of hardcore raiding (sadly) are pretty much over, but that doesn't mean I don't want to raid every now and then, at a challenging level (no LFR - thank you very much). So I'm wondering whether there are guilds out there who have a similar mindset as I do.  
---
I'm looking to play on a EU PvE or RP server.
---
I'm looking for a guild that doesn't require the players to invest tons of time (no heavy consumables requirements for every raid, for example)
---
I'm looking for a guild that has a calendar feature and where you can fill in the required spots on a first come, first serve basis. The raid leader will then decide on the day before the raid whether the roster is sufficient enough to go through with it, or cancel it, so people know they are not expected to show up for the raid. Loot would be somewhat DKP based, so people who tend to join more raids can gear up faster in order to ultimately help the entire guild progress through the raids. This means progression will be slower as some raids will have to be canceled if players have other responsabilities that night. But this is a guild that would focus on real life over a game, and create opportunities for game fun on the days people have a night off.
---
I'm mostly looking for friends to have fun with, organise ad hoc dungeon runs with guildies, help each other out,... So basically a social guild that has systems in place to still allow semi-hardcore progression raiding for those with busy schedules.
---
Instead of google translate, you can use wowhead in the other languages
---
for instance:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=75/auto-shot
---
now just put pt. before and you'll get the correctly translated term:
---
https://pt.classic.wowhead.com/spell=75/auto-shot
---
You can use that trick to check the skill name in all the languages you want, just trade the "pt." for "ko." for korean etc...
---
I can make the rest of the translations to ptBR if you want. Just send me a PM
---
4 buttons in PvP (jk) frost Nova, highest rank frostbolt ya got and then finish with the cone of cold. Watch the one shots trickle in!
---
Meh. Girls don't tank.
---
I don't remember that being a problem whatsoever. I do remember tanks dying and healers running out of mana being a problem, however, before the raid gets on farm status.
---
Fire Blast is Level 6. Have fun doing the Defias item quest, the Kobold cave item quests..
---
It's hard to level with a friend. You need to be almost always together for weeks. Level your alt with your friend.
---
1. get a mouse with a free spin wheel
---
2. bind frostbolt on mouse wheel
---
3. spin it realy hard
---
4. cats frostbolts for minutes
---
5. get a cup of tea while doing deeeeppss
---
&gt; spend an hour running around/porting/hearthing getting all the buffs
---
&gt;get ganked in BRM or someone fucks up and wipes
---
&gt;lose buffs
---
&gt;still have to do the raid in normal time
---
Why not just raid or spend time consume farming instead of chasing all these buffs?
---
Well you can go to both alli and horde, and do it 2x a month, but I agree he should have just waited to do it with his mates and take the random 1-10%
---
Kargoz made a really good guide for this. Worth watching...
---
[https://youtu.be/8YCBd1VZVb4?t=454](https://youtu.be/8YCBd1VZVb4?t=454)
---
Also, take into account the countless people that have resubbed in hopes of being sent a classic beta invite. i.e. me.
---
It would work pretty well with my Note9's stylus.
---
unless you alt and only play that toon with said friend.
---
Warlock, shaman, druid or mage could've won. Maybe even priest.
---
Two prot can respec fury. Remove two locks and two hunters for more fury warrs.
---
lol i believe he was undead but would have been amazing if he was an orc.
---
memeing about your country’s downfall is fun
---
Lol maybe grind gear that actually has a realistic chance of dropping.
---
so glad i'm not a min-maxer.  I'm perfectly happy (as are my guildies) with a couple of consumables and if we're lucky a couple of world buffs here and there.  We don't clear content quite as quick but... OH NO!  more actual game time and shared adversity!  a few laughs when someone dies on the first trash pull and loses their buffs!
---
wtf is the point playing a game that you consider beyond trivial anyway?  jesus christ
---
Your best bet is to import them from the retail version during the last stress test on the beta I was able to get in and a few of them actually worked while none of the add-ons used on private vanilla servers work at all.
---
For at least the first few weeks after the full release we are all going to be back into the dark ages playing this game with the *shivers* default UI.
---
They told me my account belonged to someone else now and there was nothing I could do.
---
Only raid tanks in classic are Druids
---
Arrr, Me Hearties! I be havin' some extra Treasure that i be givin' away servers.
---
If Blizzard released a mobile version with a properly scaled UI, I would actually love it.  
---
Not for raiding or anything complicated but for questing, farming or fishing it would be decent.
---
Lol I don't agree with your comment much either. 
---
Okay so they took a legion client, took old data from a backup of vanilla and transformed the source code / DB structure so it worked on the new client. They then had a very minimalistic working build where they had to change assets and functionality of some things to get vanilla to work. 
---
Well, now you're saying they have a working vanilla client so take that TBC data they have which is still from an OLD 2.X.X client and just put it into the vanilla client. It doesn't work like that. Sure they know the process and it will probably be faster, but it will still take some time. 
---
On top of that, they have all new class abilities, boss mechanics, assets and other shit that they have to put into this new legion client that will still require testing. 
---
Okay they may be able to get it done "faster" than classic is getting done, but 3 months? You're high lol. This is still a long process.
---
yeah i enjoyed the pvp brawls every raid night.  BRM was alive and kicking, not just a boring background for you to run through on your way to your next stat increase
---
because epeen apparently
---
If you level the mage first you'll have an easier time farming gold to help boost the leveling process for your rogue.
---
If I had to guess. You watched a video that rated the strengths of classes based on those 4 categories and now intend on having one of each?
---
To clarify 'crafter' is just a 'bank' their purpose is storage and convenient auction house management. Level one to 5 if you want to disenchant crappy green items for potential greater profit.
---
Druid heal fine and I will be maining one myself because I played one in Vanilla. 
---
You will have to down rank spells, you also need to be careful with your Tranq and max rank HT, they will pull threat very easily, theres a reason why the resto talent tree has 2 different talents that reduce threat with your healing spells.
---
Pirate server, Private server, "Non-beta" beta server... trash people from trash servers.
---
So we're basing this off of level 30 content? Lmao okay.
---
Yeah. Classic raids are not retail mythic raids. You don't need to carefully calculate which player gets what upgrades. I'm not playing in a guild that will do that over /roll or DKP.
---
Pserver players are toxic and whiney with their 2 month throwaway accounts?
---
15 minutes...HAH!
---
Because muh meters, hybrid classes would never get a raid spot unless they can compete in dps or healing, no matter how much utility they bring to the group.
---
I main a Druid, and for the most part I give zero fucks about competing on the healing meters as long as nobody dies,  and I can provide bufs, battle rez, etc I'm doing my job. I trialed with a couple hardcore guilds who didn't like the fact that I wasn't competitive on the meters. Life goes on!
---
2 shadow priests?
---
lmao whats poopsock tier?
---
Okay, full stop.
---
This is the *third* thread popping up mentioning something like realm reputations in a week, and I think someone needs to chime in here.
---
First of all, the amount of influence a bad reputation has on your playstyle is entirely depending on the *average player behaviour*. If 8/10 insult someone at some point, which is pretty natural in today's MMO communities, then a reputation for insulting will not get you locked out of anything. Essentially: if the community has changed since classic, so will the impact of any given reputation.
---
Secondly, and this is important, server reputation *rarely* served as a lock-out for people who knew how to play or had the right spec. A full tier 2 tank would still get into Naxxramas even if he had a reputation for being a dick. Rogues who ganked low level players and were trolling the forums *still had guilds*. You had some leeway on this if you were a desired spec or a good PvPer. 
---
Third, and this is something that I am personally waiting for to see the impact of: *server reputation can work both ways*. It can be an interesting way of getting to know troublesome people, but it can also act as a way for troublesome people in influential circles to cause a bad reputation for innocent people and lock them out of content.
---
Please don't overhype this reputation thing so much. It was a mediocre way to take care of the worst offenders, but few people *ever* cared if someone said "You dicks" four months ago and left your group. Even twice.
---
Right. Just saying, my english speaking guild mates say something that sounds like "shapoww" for me
---
When it's normally a net stop at the end, without a W.

Like that : https://youtu.be/7Zw4GZp5fzE

It works for all the words finishing by -eau , -au , -o.
---
Took me about 4 different try's to get my account, some GM's will go the extra mile some are just useless.   
---
had to give them the address of where it was created, possible email addresses &amp; then send them photo id / Birth certificate and everything.
---
Watch every negative comment in this thread get downvoted by the marketing department at blizzard with a thousand reddit accounts trying to push this product down our throats.
---
You can't expect a massive amount of people to hold pitchforks for years about the re-creation of a unblemished product prior to blizzard's corruption and then have those same people suddenly have a change of heart about playing classic on phones and whatnot.
---
If I had to take a guess I'd say it's one person using several reddit accounts to reply to their own thread and upvote themselves to the top while downvoting any negative comment said about it. 
---
What's next? cash shop and ads ? Please. I mean who the heck even thinks about making a classic phone version? since diablo phone failed now it's time to try with classic ?
---
Not counting Asia, there are 22 realms with more population than Emerald Dream.
---
22 realms might be all we get in Classic.
---
Whenever I want to browse Warcraft fan art I make sure that "safe search" is ON
---
Nope. That came much later. Late WotLK to early Cata, I believe. The LFD tool came in late WotLK.
---
The answer is. Balancing hybrids is almost impossible. Notice how when they did it on retail. All of the sudden even dps started getting self heal abilities. Looking at you recuperate.
---
Well luckily for you Blizzard made BFA. Vanilla is not for everyone.
---
* Guild name: &lt;Still Deciding&gt;
---
* Faction: Horde
---
* Server: PVP
---
* Guild Type: Casual/Raiding/Adult
---
* Raid times: Probably 2-3 nights a week. Will more than likely start 7pm cent and go to 10pm cent and will aim for like a Tue , Fri, Sat or Tue, Fri, Sun schedule. This gives people chances to do things they want without having to raid non stop , multiple days in a row.
---
* Loot System: DKP Hybrid system. I tried every system under the sun as a guild leader in vanilla and this was by far the best I saw. Loot system is in discord
---
* Loot Restrictions : Thunderfury : To the MT first, then OT Sulfuras : Will go to a Shaman for PvP (if you are a warrior asking why, you probably shouldn't apply) Atiesh : To a mage first, then priest / locks
---
* **About Me :**
---
I led an alliance guild as both the GM and raid leader upon vanilla launch through BWL. Im exceptionally experienced. I know every fight inside and out. Hell, I even popped eggs as a healer on Razorgore. The guild wanted to go horde shortly after so we switched and raided hardcore and got down 8 of the bosses in Naxx. I have done the no life, hardcore, raid to the bone thing. Thats not what we want to do this time around. We will raid and progress, but we wont be no-life ragers doing it. No baby hitlers running around. No drama. No shitlords. Above all we just want to have fun. We have a core of about 8 right now that played during vanilla. We all have kids now, careers, and families. We will get shit done but at an enjoyable rate.
---
Questions/Concerns :
---
If you would like to know more and talk about things, please, feel free to join the discord and talk! I have started putting together the channels for WoW. The DKP system is in the DKP channel. This is also my streaming discord, so if you aren't interested in any of that, stick to the Wow channels. Thanks folks! I hope some of you consider the guild. If you don't want to bother with discord right now, just DM me here on reddit or hit me on twitter.

Exactly. People calling me coward and pussy, lol ok champ 🏆
---
Ok nice, but the spriest will be oom in like 10sec. Then what?
---
Ya man it won't even let me access to Beta at all. Something about being a POS without a key.
---
You can download the client and sandbox in Google. Many addons won't really work without any NPCs, abilities, etc, but you can setup some of them.
---
Agreed. [MFW](https://i.imgflip.com/o63vh.jpg) I recently listened to someone in discord *reeee* out when discussing the potential of not having world buffs in classic because he could absolutely not stand the thought of being in MC for an extra 20 minutes during phase 2.
---
You forgot about the ever elusive Enhancement shaman tank. He needs 30 minutes between pulls, and a 3 minute agro lead, but it'll work!
---
The group of 25+ pvpers from back in the day are all going to roll rogue alts and name every one of them Robertpaulson with different ascii characters. I'm pretty sure you would appreciate that. 
---
When they ask the name of the rogue that killed them, they'll say....
---
I feel like you’ll only be able to choose 2 of those.
---
I kinda like that, personally. 
---
Something about organically forming a group just feels nice and makes the world seem more alive.
---
What about old Iron Forge? Anyone been there?
---
If this isn’t the number one comment by the time this post settles... then there’s too many youngsters on this sub.

flip a coin. if you're not happy with the outcome then I guess you know what you'll be playing
---
" I will gladly slog my way through it. "
---
Please remember that the real game is the journey to 60. That's what made WoW such a great game even for casuals. If you change your mindset from "I have to get to 60 quickly" to "I need that mf item from that instance/quest" you'll find the game much more enjoyable. 
---
Every reward along the way feels important partly because of that slow pace and item scarcity.
---
I've played on a few servers where people had to make a new character to get into groups because of their attitude.
---
beta male
---
No Korean, no shredder, no elite troll village, no gnoll village, no syndicate cave, no all-seeing eye...
---
Here’s a pretty serious question. 
---
What was the timing of the timer change. I could see it being an issue for AQ 40. But I’m fairly certain the timer change was implemented before Naxx. I would imagine that would be the same way here. 
---
Guessing the way people prepare for modern raids that this could potentially be a non-issue as Naxx was the one which required the most preparation.
---
... and when it was released MMORPG players said it was soft and easy mode compared to others at the time like Everquest.
---
Aug 26-27
---
Fine. Paladins only have one spec in premades or raiding. There.
---
If they do that then they will get blacklisted faster than you can say "Shite"
---
I'd go SPriest or Warlock. They are by FAR the best PvP classes in Vanilla.
---
Chuck Norris.
---
And it wouldn't suddenly come back when you log into classic either. To believe that the communities of both games will not both have the best (or worst) of both worlds is setting yourself up for disappointment.
---
Part of the reason for change is an extremely abusable exploit that existed in mob reach for a very long time:  
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBOCOfSyORc  
---
You could use this on raid bosses with big enough rooms.
---
Maybe a bit less, but for Alliance it takes longer to get to DMT.
---
Ya that ain't no 20% difference. It just isn't
---
Check out &lt;Ludicrous Speed&gt; Oceanic Alliance. Friendly raid times for those living in asia.
---
What about if it was in your parents name? and is it possible to merge a new and old account?
---
Might be a thing on private servers with lower populations. But that’s never been a thing when vanilla was current.
---
And anyone who says otherwise is just an elitist loser who is ruining classic wow!
---
I distinctly remember having the keys from Blacksmithing going into the key ring slot in vanilla, the ones used for opening lock boxes and shizz. Beyond dungeon keys.
---
No it is, I would argue it’s hurting them more cause they can never learn without noticing.
---
Chris handsome*
---
it really depends. there are lots of people who don't care if you're a priest or warlock, they'll still kill you
---
True. And this was before most people had figured out how to pvp, but it's just so much nostalgic goodness that I had to post it!
---
+Healing does not mean +Spell Damage and Healing.
---
&gt;spend an hour running around/porting/hearthing getting all the buffs
---
Like I mentioned took all of 30 min for 35 people to do it and all of 1h for the other 5. You do not have to be part of that 4-5 that clears DMN for the other 40.
---
Don't play on a PvP server if you don't want WPvP. Whiping is a legitamate concern, but untill then you get a massive speed increase to clear content you have cleared 40+ times.
---
I think I need some more info here, like using a warlock Spellstone? or is this point related to whiping?
---
I have a question about this too, do you mean start time or do you mean raid clearing time? 
---
&gt; Why not just raid or spend time consume farming instead of chasing all these buffs? 
---
I'll have most if not all my consumeables farmed for Naxx a few months in, the 1h-30 min before a raid I'll be clearing DMN to help those in my guild get their buffs quickly and easily. I already play a lock and and expected to be at places a bit early to summon people who are late/stuck somewhere. I see the these buffs as consumeables, just ones that need to be safeguarded a bit more than the others.
---
Blessing of Wisdom + Mana Pots and he will last longer than 10 seconds. With Paladin support, long enough to kill every other person who challenges him. Then he can drink and they can continue the ownage.
---
DPS warriors/druids are expected to tank. Mages are expected to remove curses. Hunters are expected to kite. Rogues are expected to.. pick locks?
---
Every class offers more then *just* straight output.
---
Ah ok, yeah, the original French pronunciation is just /ʃa.po/ without the diphthong
---
If that's from a private server it would be smaller than BFA
---
I’ve seen multiple people say it. I’ve argued with people about it here. And when you tell them that night elf was more common than dwarf back then (and humans most common by far) they just say that’s because everyone sucked back then but it won’t be the case anymore.
---
Here is an example I made to show why the above is necessary when doing comparisons with screenshots:
---
https://gfycat.com/inferiorshamefulcomet
---
I tried to scale the "Retail" picture to match the texture details of the "Classic" picture, and it shows the wall line is way off between them.
---
What you FAIL to understand, is that World Buff 6 hours CD in Classic, will entirely change the meta.
---
On private servers, if you wipe in a raid, all you you have to do is go back, pop another Ony head, get Rallying Cry, go to Yojamba, pop another Hakkar head, get the Spirit of Zandalari and you are GOOD to go.
---
In Classic, you wipe in a raid, you will lose the above 2 World Buffs (the most powerful ones), because the cooldown is 6 hours.
---
Do you see ANY guild waiting for 6 hours or so, if they wipe?
---
Yes, they can go and get DM buffs, and Songflower...but Rallying Cry and Spirit of Zandalari are the best ones, they are 2 hrs long and combined, they provide most of the healing and damage...and MOVEMENT SPEED, which in Classic is too good to pas.
---
The meta from private servers won't work in Classic, for most of the guilds.
---
Yes, the very good guilds (which are like 10% of the guilds) will NOT wipe as much, and they will fully benefit from the World Buffs. But ALL the other guilds will wipe, or have enough deaths among tanks, healers and dps to hamper their progress.
---
Most guilds will simply continue raiding after wiping, and won't lose 30 min+ to get DM buffs and songflower, again. That is for min maxing guilds, which will be in the very minority.
---
And even for those guilds, raids in Classic will take LONGER, because there won't be private server GMs providing gear and weapons for cash, there won't be world buffs whenever you want, there will be 14% parry vs 5.6%, there won't be Fury Warriors for maximum threat (they will be two-shotted by raid bosses), hence, maximum damage and minimum mana spent, and god knows how much more resistances raid bosses will have, if private servers got it almost 3 times wrong with Parry.
---
Yes, more guilds will use World buffs...but not too many more, because they will have to coordinate to be ON LINE with their full raid when a guild uses Ony head and Hakkar Head...and only min maxing guilds will be able to have all theyr raids ready for World Buffs.
---
This is how it is going to be in Classic : 
---
1-2 guilds per realm and faction will clear all the raids in first reset, an additional 3-4 guilds will do it on second reset, and everyone else (100+ guilds) will do it on 3rd, 4th, 5th and so on reset.
---
90% of the player base in Classic will NEED a lot more time to clear raid content. A LOT more time.
---
ALL GAMES are easy, if you are looking at the top 10% players. Method and other world top guilds are clearing mythic raids in first reset. Does that means that mythic raids are easy and EVERY other guilds will also clear them in first reset? NO. Top private server guilds will clear all raids in first reset. Does this means raids are easy in Classic and EVERY other guilds will also clear the raids in first reset? NO.
---
World buffs make no difference. A guild with average players will not benefit from World buffs...IF THEY ARE actually going to get them in the first place. Only TOP guilds will, but that doesn't change the FACT that most guilds WILL NOT, and they will wipe in MC for weeks, before clearing it. Same for any other 40 men raids.
---
I bet your mom isnt.
---
Imp. PoH, and Spiritual Guidance/Healing are extremely powerful talents. Which when combined with downranking (mandatory!) make you the strongest possible healer even at low gear levels (plus Scroll of Spirit can replace Divine Spirit). Throughput and regen are essentially interchangeable with downranking.   
---
That being said... You don't need to be the "strongest possible healer" for 5 mans and PvP. And Disc' brings plenty of utility (Divine Spirit, PI, even damage) to those scenarios which pays for itself.    
---
It should be asked what "kind" of Disc Priest. There is a Disc healing Priest, a Disc Shadow damage Priest, and a Disc Holy damage Priest. A Disc' healing Priest is only marginally less powerful than a Holy healing Priest, whereas a Disc holy damage Priest is a worse healer but can dish out the big Holy Fires/Smites.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja1j7xWpB3w
---
I still remember this Shaman with Sulfuras. I assume he only got it because nobody in a horde raid comp uses 2h maces, though.
---
Raiding is fine on a hunter. With the caveat that as a raid position. You are there to be a support. As in people want you for kiting more then your damage. So get comfortable kiting. I'm guessing though if you wanna be a hunter thats not an issue.
---
oh no it's retarded
---
I would appreciate this. However all these rogue will die, because this comp is too good.
---
Kinda where my head is at too. What grind spots you gonna hit? I have a list as well if you wanted to share
---
Yes. They are dead and aren't contributing anything.  That situation is the easiest way to define carrying someone through a raid.
---
And thus we reach the true toxic element of classic, which was also implied by OP. 
---
People want all the rewards with none of the work or potential issues. 
---
Has this issue not slowly been behind the worsening of the game since day one?
---
The laziest raid entrance of all time.
---
Best looking set ever made... I'm not even a warrior :(
---
Thanks for that :)
---
I'm from europe, so I'm just enjoying the show
---
It was discussed on Kargoz' stream a week ago or so I believe
---
Better with the Paladin support because they Paladin cover any weaknesses the Priest has, and vice versa. Trust me this comp is GOD tier.
---
I mean, it's one banana Michael. How much could it cost? 10 dollars?
---
Or step 3: hook the mouse up to a usb fan retrofitted with an RC car wheel. Step 4: Take the wife to dinner during the boss fight
---
If there's proof it happened in Vanilla, then there's proof that it's a bug and it will be fixed.
---
That’s assuming they need to learn anything to begin with. Some people enjoy fucking with people. But I’ve never been denied a group or anything due to these ‘bad reps’ I really don’t think they do anything for the most part.
---
Listen, when your Warcraft Tabletop Party wants to take on some Worgen, you make what you gotta make.
---
Fix it!
---
Brazzers
---
They just don't want to listen. They want something to be true so they will just ignore everything else.
---
It's a Grindgear Gorilla
---
I liked ST, it really felt like a true dungeon that you easily get lost in and can feel overwhelmed due to it's non-linear layout and interesting mobs. Only a handful of dungeons which give same feeling.
---
I'm at work right now, have the list typed out on a word document . First one was whelps in wetlands at 23 I believe. Another early 30s, one mid 30, and one mid 50's (EPL) so far.  I have a terrible memory, that's all I remember so far lol
---
Naxx will be tanked by furyprot warriors
---
Recommend taking skinning over mining for a while for easy extra cash. Mining will be way harder to do.
---
Obviously there are bad eggs in all communities.
---
The post just made it seem like a "us *true* fans" -type of post.
---
Because Hots don't stack and are not that efficient in raids it's rarely used in that situation.
---
Maybe even sooner raids
---
Well from what I’ve seen on pservers is the hunter will park their pet on the spawn and the pet will pick it up as it’s spawn. Tho ya moonfire spam is still probably faster but I was just saying the only thing that’s near competitive
---
It's like they can't even read or are refusing to because it doesn't agree with what they believe.
---
&gt; Guilds just drop thier own heads for these buffs 
---
Yeah...ON PRIVATE SERVERS. In Classic, you can't do that...you have to wait 6 hours before getting the next Rallying Cry. Same for Hakkar head.
---
One wipe, and say goodbye to the most powerful world buffs : Rallying Cry and Spirit of Zandalari. If you get the buff at 7 p.m. server time, the next buff is available, SERVER WIDE, at 1 a.m. server time.
---
As I said, one wipe, and the entire meta goes bust.
---
Are you certain that summoning within raids wasn't a part of 1.12?
---
I think its the same mentality I had when I was really young playing wow, when nerfs would come out for specific content I was having trouble with I would absolutly be extatic, now I just wish it was the opposite and things would be patched harder for more of a challange.
---
Priest -&gt; Disc is always strong - shadow is garbage for PVE but super strong in pvp 1v1's, in group PVP and bgs shadow has major mana issues.
---
Warlock -&gt; One of the strongest classes for PVE and PVP, never a bad choice
---
Rogue -&gt; Very good in both PVE and PVP, not as strong in premade bgs due to being outshined by other classes (but tier 1 flag defender)
---
Mage -&gt; Always a good choice
---
I don't know. I'm not even that big on the Scarlet lore but there's just something about the whole dungeon that gets me super excited. I guess it's partly due to the ridiculously good items that drop, especially for a woyer.
---
I also like the layouts, the fact that it's split into 4 different dungeons and the fact that it's right next to a horde Capital.
---
I think SM might be my top favorite dungeon. In fact, right now I'm playing on *[redacted]* just so I could reach level 35 and do them all. Not sure if I'll reach it in time before Classic launches but hey, it'll still be there next time I log in!
---
Awesome picture, either way!
---
&gt; as long as nobody dies
---
If you are doing half the healing of the other healers and nobody is dying, it's because the other healers are keeping them up.  I can afk as a dps and the boss might still die, doesn't mean you did a good job.
---
Username checks out.
---
I think they confirmed that. This just makes it more annoying to get though.
---
What's going on in that first fight?  It takes them both like two seconds to use BoF/Trinket.  Then the mage casting arcane missiles is somehow turning super precise but slow.  I've never seen mouse movement like that, and it's awful.
---
Basically retail WOW ended up being a good dungeon crawler but meaningless open world game.
---
You are set on alliance?
---
Yep had to summon outside, this is a bug.  Had a bastard lock that like to put the closet on the edges of open areas in BRM.  People getting summoned and falling into the lava was pretty funny.
---
Enh Sham w/ Sulf make the best pvp vids
---
Back in my day, we called people that played MMO's all day every day poopsockers, because instead of taking the time to get up and have a bowel movement they'd just poop in a sock, tie it off and call it a day -- all so they could keep playing with minimal downtime. 
---
It's obviously a joke, but given some of the crazy shit I see in society today it wouldn't surprise me if it were true in some cases.
---
If the name "Shadowfang Keep" is part of the designe I must disagree, I love everything else about it though.
---
Why in the world would you accept a Real ID request? This is doable in Retail only if you CHOOSE to accept it. I only accept a cross faction friend if its a normal battle tag request, NOT Real ID.
---
Also you can't right click add the other faction in Classic.
---
duuude, I do this too. but never find anyone who does the same. +20 spirit on arlokk and +22 int on (shadow wing focus staff has 40int). Just hoping someone tests if staff swapping is doable in beta
---
Do you have a list of gear set to encounter?
---
I.e Nefarian MT (stamina) etc?
---
I think with a proper taunt rotation 5 warriors could still do the job.
---
Yeah, well the mage just counterspells your paladin and now warrior is all up in your face and there is nothing you can do for 6 seconds by to eat MS and frost bolts.  
---
My shit tier combo just wrecked your god tier combo.
---
...but that's correct. Players were less experienced back then, and thus, didn't/couldn't make informed choices about things like that.
---
Now that we've had 15 years of experience with the game, it's common knowledge that Dwarf Priest is far more useful than the other races' Priest racial spells.
---
It's not impossible to get into raids as human/nelf priest, but guilds are always going to prefer dwarves because of fear ward.
---
That's fair once your warriors are geared to the point you can farm AQ &amp; BWL. 
---
Good luck tanking Vael with a mix of tier one and DPS gear, though.
---
We have a lot in common.
---
I vividly remember that we summoned people INSIDE Molten Core over edges and stuff for the luls. But I might be wrong. That said, trust in Blizz to do the right thing.
---
I guess you haven't played BFA, almost none of that is true anymore. "Who wants to world PvP when it sucked a year ago"
---
That being said, it does still suck, but due to phasing not the actual balance
---
And Menethil Harbor
---
&gt; For at least the first few weeks after the full release we are all going to be back into the dark ages playing this game with the shivers default UI.
---
Not sure why you think that.
---
There's already plenty of mods that work on the beta and even more with developer that plan to have them ready by launch.
---
&gt; You can't be an annoying asshole, etc.
---
If you were a full tier 2 tank with some know-how what he was doing, you absolutely could be.
---
Server reputation was a nice, *mediocre* way to control the worst things. Nobody gave you a permanent lockout for being annoying a few times over your classic career.
---
Yes, certain. It was added in 2.4.0:   
---
&gt;  Ritual of Summoning can be used to summon players into instances if they meet the instance requirements.
---
As a 33 year old, Spotify has been my gateway to the 80s. Basically discovering Tears for Fears for the first time. So good. Also my Zeppelin appreciation has gone from "familiar" to "big fan". It truly is a good time to be alive.
---
It could be. If something as silly as this could be out why not?
---
I don't even have to click the link to know it's Unbreakable!
---
Only true "hybrids" during BC were Ferals who could tank &amp; dps on the same encounter, same spec
---
I've been saying this to several friends who are considering rolling on a PVP server.
---
There's always going to be ganking on a PVP server, thats just a given. However, on top of that, there is going to be a fraction of the population that will have the mindset of "I've done all these raids and dungeons, I am just going to make a ganking Rogue and only gank".
---
I played on a PVP server in vanilla and while there is some fun to be had in World PVP, the headaches wipe it out immediately. There's nothing more annoying than being ganked, other than having to deal with gankers camping a guildmate or blocking an entrance to a zone or dungeon, and now you have to fly to the other side of the world to deal with one stupid undead rogue who doesn't have the balls to gank in level 60 zones because they'll get fucked up by players who can actually land spells on them.
---
Which is the bigger point of World PVP. You are either going to be severely disadvantaged against tryhard professional gankers, or you are going to be on the other side and severely overpower enemy to the point where it's a hollow victory. Oh? Having the element of surprise, PVP gear/trinket on, and full mana/cooldowns while this poor son of bitch is fighting two tigers, half mana and already used an important cooldown? I sure as fuck hope you win that fight.
---
World PVP will never be balanced, and the imbalance is what gankers crave, because at the end of the day they are looking for cheap victories, not real ones. It takes real skill to pick fights where you are the underdog as the ganker, and the amount of players who can actually pull it off is miniscule. The average ganker is just shitty, both as a player and probably a person.
---
Had to abandon my first 60 due to a bad reputation.  Ninja looted a dagger and was a general ass.  Learned from my mistakes and my 2nd 60 had a good life.
---
thank you
---
- mute germans
---
Bears were pretty OP in legion in world pvp, thats not the case in BFA. Unless you heavily outgear them and/or they suck of course, thats ALWAYS a factor
---
I'm not defending BFA, I just have to correct people saying its a joke "in Retail" despite the fact they're talking about the past, and NOT retail
---
You might see some retlols in the pve scene but will most likely not be seen as often in hardcore guilds in the raiding scene.
---
Bruh he's probably keyboard turning.
---
Carrot on the stick is the trinket to remeber my dude...
---
Always loved running around the main city as a low level and get that buff. I felt special.
---
It was already announced that it will be. Same for Hakkar head.
---
The most powerful world buffs will be on a 6 hr CD, server wide. As it was in Vanilla.
---
Paladins only have one spec.
---
White mans shampoo?
---
I play the villain.
---
And theyre both holy
---
Depends if you mod your client or hack it so others can see it too.
---
Yeah sulfuras is one of those few legendary's that has very little use inside an actual raid. I saw lots of Shaman's with it in Vanilla...
---
Really more of a "who pvp's a lot"? weapon than a "we're giving this to you for the good of the guild" weapon.
---
Technically more than 1 person can get it, but they all need to turn in the quest within 12(iirc) hours of the first gong
---
Obviously since people care about exclusivity they aren’t gonna wait around for others to be ready before they turn in the quest, but an equally hc player can get the mount
---
Shes probably still in melee range though
---
On A SIX HOUR CD.
---
I hope you know what this means.
---
You guys can’t be helped. Jesus...
---
I mean you keep two set of gear in your bags. Like a druid who have a tanking set, dps set and healing set.
---
I didnt play back then :(  
---
It'll be fun to have a whole new list of trinkets and stuff to remember, though :)
---
I am saying 16/20 *won’t* care. As opposed to 99/100 not caring.
---
Yes, retail is easier in that aspect because other people don't matter there. It's just me and my position on the penis meter. If I don't like the group I'll reroll it with a single button.
---
...don’t have a mount at 48? What does speed leveling have to do with not getting a mount by 48?
---
For many builds, you need to put 3 points into either Toughness (armor) or Anticipation (+Def) to unlock the third row.
---
For most situations, I would choose the armor over the +Def. Two +Def for one talent point is a poor exchange rate -- for comparison, Core Armor Kit enchant is +3 Def as an alternative to \~7-9 points in useful stats. It's only when you \_absolutely\_ need crit immunity (Maexxna) and your best gear is a few points short, enchants and all, that I would consider taking it.
---
The problem you will run into is in general the hardcore players want to farm the buffs and max their dps meters / run times. This leaves the more casual players for guilds that don't bother with the buffs. Yes, classic raids aren't hard, but trust me it is possible to spend hours wiping with retards even today. So the difference ends up being spend time farming consumables and world buffs and do a quick speed run of MC with good players or spend two 4 hour nights wiping in MC with retards.
---
It is actually a hard choice if you are trying to minimize time playing per week while still getting geared. Wiping with retards might actually mean less time if you can stay in pvp spec and not have to farm consumables.
---
Lul sixers
---
the delusion is strong here, with those stupid enough to partake that is. thankfully most of the country can call a spade a spade and we wont be dealing with trump or trumptards much longer
---
I was in one of these friendly/casual guilds in late vanilla to early tbc. I wasn't an officer but managing the guild looked like a nightmare. We had officers who had to step down or just quit playing because it was so exhausting. An undeserving person was promoted to officer as well. That sparked some animosity among the core players, which I was a part of. You'll have to have a large roster to have enough people to fill a raid but when a lot of people show up, people who didn't get an invite start complaining. When you don't have enough people to raid people complain about wasted time. Add to that recruitment problems and you have a bunch of burnt out officers. Just some pitfalls to avoid. I really do hope everyone finds their place. Back then most people didn't raid so maybe there's more room for casual raiding these days.
---
Yeah iirc. I had a lag-switch back then so was pretty easy :)
---
What??? Yea it was. I played on Spirestone Vanilla and it was a definitely a thing. I can see it being nonexistent on a higher pop realm.
---
Welcome! Take a name badge over there - punch and pie every 5th friday, and the newsletter comes out every 9th monday.
---
Yeah. I remember a lot of guilds ended up selling sherpa services that guaranteed the person who gets to tag along the Eye if it dropped.
---
This pic has a distinct lack of thiccness I can't ignore
---
rofl, nope, that would be against the rules :D
---
Jesus Christ look in the mirror.  Claiming other people didn't raid and calling them antisocial trash because they won't be taking non raid specs to raids?  Seriously.  Get a grip man.
---
Multiple times before it opened. Both with help of mage poly and various consumables.
---
Your comment was “you can do shadow in a healing set of gear”.
---
This is false.
---
Just an fyi, that pro tip won't be available in Phase1.
---
also great for shaming raid members that fall off the big tube in naxxramas after grobbulus. Imagine falling down and having  6 priests watching your walk of shame. Our priestchat then took bets on which of the blobs after Patchwerk would kill them :)
---
Adda boy Jay.
---
Oh yeah. Come of think of it. Inside the Tram aquarium is a nice one too that I did.
---
Well thats my preference, mainly because I played Alliance on vanilla and then rerolled Horde on TBC to join a enormous guild project  (that failed spectacular btw)...and played Horde from TBC till the end of Legion.
---
It still up in the air, since I have some friends, old guild members, people I met along the years playing WoW that will also play Classic so I kinda see who goes where and the ratio of people going horde vs going alliance and then make a final decision but my idea its go Alliance!
---
Why? Are you about to recommend me Shaman? If so, please feel free to sell me the class (it waws my main during Cata actually but I know close to zero about shamans on vanilla)!
---
Easy. I Dispel CS off my Paladin buddy, and he keeps me alive. The warrior will be rage starved from my PW:S while I rot them both away with SW:P and keep the Mage's barrier dispelled. VE healing + Paladin heals + Shadowform and I'm now unkillable. Pal throws a stun on the warrior.. or if I really need help... a BoP on me.
---
I keep Fear Ward on my Pal and dispel sheeps off him.
---
SPriest/Hpal would destroy Mage/Warrior. I don't think you understand how ridiculous SPriests are, especially against Warriors and Mages.
---
A great combo, but still doesn't hold a candle to paladin and warrior.
---
Jeez... it's like the N-Word in old movies... /s
---
There is over a decades worth of classic frost mage pvp guides posted literally everywhere over the internet! You could have pushed much fewers keys than it took to type all that out to search on google my friend
---
No it didn’t. Don’t act like people knew who you were or even cared.
---
Not for long though. Itll all be answered relatively quick.
---
World first
---
In a beta
---
Closed beta 
---
Yeah right
---
You could summon them once they entered Molten Core to your location, but from say Stormwind
---
I'm just a lone tank looking for a good healer. But everyone wants the good DPS 😔
---
You can make the bar as thin as you want and can choose between a flat or beveled bar. You can also remove the border.
---
Im leveling on the beta now with a mage / priest combat and it has been amazing.  Me being a priest, I benefit from the int buff and free water.  He benefits from stam buff and shield / heals.  Most of the gear comes from quests anyway and occasional greens but we haven't had any issues with gear.
---
Rogue is harder to duo with a priest, easier with a druid because you can't stealth past with a priest friend.
---
Also a shitty idea. I dont want my flask to be running out because the tank DC'ed and we have to wait 15min.
---
Ooga Oogas are one of the best things in beta. I love stuff like this. You never know when they are going to strike...
---
Holy hell hahaha
---
no, we dont
---
&gt; Not counting Asia, there are 22 realms with more population than Emerald Dream.
---
There are just 12 realms more populous than Emerald Dream in the US. Of those realms, only three (Moonguard, Wyrmrest Accord, and Area 52) launched at a later date than Emerald Dream. Two of those are normal RP realms and the other was a realm that received free server transfers from five overpopulated realms. Emerald Dream launched nearly a full year after the game's release.
---
&gt; 25 realms might be all we get in Classic. That's 1 realm of each type for each region. With 3 RP realms thrown in for US-East, US-Pacific, and EU.
---
I'm not sure where you're getting those numbers from, but ultimately it doesn't matter. Since virtually every RP-PVP realm launched much later than the game's release, I don't really see any evidence to suggest that a realm being labelled "RP-PVP" deters players from choosing it any more than a regular PVP server would.
---
Pretty sure could still summon people in instances, they just had to be inside the instance too.  So it wasn't uncommon to make them run and then just summon them to where the group was once they got inside.
---
Sure!
---
Hi, /u/Neuciler
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bzebrp/keanu_reeves_in_barren_chat/). 
---
Yes answered with more miss information. This particular thread is a perfect example.
---
Not only that, we're getting cross faction BGs extremely early. 
---
It will even affect world PvP since most people will see thousands of names on a daily basis. They will be less likely to remember people even on their own server.
---
I think you could summon people inside the instances if they were already inside.  You couldn't summon them from outside to inside.
---
If dwarves make up even 1/3 of alliance priests, I will be shocked. 
---
“Far more useful,” is kinda an overstatement. And if you think that people back then didn’t know that dwarves have fear ward, you’re smoking crack. People know about fear ward from the minute raiding started, and yet most raiding guilds only had one dwarf priest. Weird right?
---
Probably one of if not the most powerful combos if like you said, coordination is on point.
---
Westfall music is the mosr nostalgic for me. No idea why because it's not like i played in westfall a lot.
---
The music of WoW miggt actually be more nostalgic to me than the game. It's sad to see most streamers turn off the in game music. It's such a part of the experience for mw that i couldn't play without it.
---
Check out the long 3 hour music+ambience video's of each zone. They're awesome!
---
Instead of my number I’d give you my battle tag, and asking my dad for permission to marry me will require you to beat him in a duel.
---
English is not my first language but "you can do THAT, shadow, in a healing set of gear"
---
&gt; But the pvp tradeoff is immense. 
---
And for leveling speed. Or farming gold.
---
Orc Warriors level faster, farm gold faster and they are much more powerful in PvP..which also is WPvP, that also affects leveling and gold farming.
---
For tanking, is not a big deal...but tanking is not a solo activity. You will WANT to be among the first Warriors to level, so to be among the first to tank, and solidify your position as a tank, you will also want to have gold to sustain yourself as a tank in raids.
---
The differences might be small, on paper, but they add up in time.
---
If you are looking long term (and this is how you should look at Classic) choosing UD Warrior is probably the worst option that you could choose. Even Troll Warrior is better.
---
Depends if they're speed leveling or if it's a "hey we plan Sat/Sun when available, and Monday/Wednesday from 6 - 10 PM"  then they'll be fine and can roll an alt otherwise.     
---
If they are both rushing then they'll probably both be on.. or just grind mobs while waiting for the other so as to not conflict with quests.  OR just do a 2nd zone you've both agreed to do solo that is in the same level range.   Or go run a dungeon or something.  
---
If one is hard core and the other is casual then yes, you'll probably want to just level with them on an alt.
---
My plan is to recreate my original vanilla characters. Now I just have to decide which to level first.
---
I plan on ganking Alliance relentlessly! :D 
---
Love playing the villain :)
---
Tukui, titanbar, immersion classic
---
When I was leveling a shaman and I'd receive the Warchiefs Blessing on a stop to Orgrimmar it was really great. The buff made everything so much easier for me.
---
You gave a lot of good arguments why world buffs don't sound much of an issue. 
---
If there's entire groups dedicated to purging them from me why would I go waste my time to pick them up then? 
---
If the leader does ask me where my buffs are I can lie and say that the goons got to me.
---
Powerful leader takes minions long broadswords.
---
I have only seen old videos and have never done it.  It looks amazing.
---
That's the problem. I either go 10-12 hours a day, or not play at all :D
---
... it doesn't, not playing vanilla does
---
I've looked everywhere for someone else who abused this.
---
We used to call it the Hodge-step after a priest of the same name that kited the Lich King around his platform forever
---
Yeah this needs fixed
---
A whole new meaning to catching a second hand
---
Level 30 is definitely I indicative of endgame strength.
---
note: I agree in Classic Mages are A tier

He means you can be shadow spec with a healing set of gear on and be able to heal the 5 man you don't have to be disc.
---
Yes, he's getting crit every once in a while, roughly for an average of 778. This is in line with the normal hits he takes calculated from the attacks he blocked (375*2=750). This is also not what we should be seeing most of the times, because crits are 2x and crushing blows are 1.5x damage. What we are supposed to see most of the time is ~560 damage crushes, which is exactly what we see.
---
The mage does not get crushed nor should he get crushed, because he is dealing with an enemy the same level as him. There is also no "behaving as if he was lvl 60" shit, whatever you mean by that. 4k armor offers the same DR against level 60 mobs regardless of whether you're level 40 or level 60 yourself. The only difference is that it gives you a higher DR against lower level mobs. 
---
In short, Asmon is getting crushed with every hit he takes par for those that he blocks, dodges, or parries. The damage from crushing blows he takes is 1.5x compared to the damage from normal hits (ie blocked hits), which is correct. The damage Asmon takes from his crushes is similar or lower than the damage the mage takes from normal hits is because Asmon has some 4k armor resulting in +40% DR against level 60 mobs, with -10% damage taken from def stance on top of that, while the mage only has about 1k armor.
---
All in all pretty good! The only part I didn't like was when you spent a while just reading off the stats of items.
---
I guess im rolling warlock now
---
How is this even a discussion? I'm all classic but there is nothing in classic that pushes you in terms of decision making and mechanics like high M+ or mythic raiding or high tier arena.
---
For everyone that can't wrap your heads around this. Did any of you play PvP as hunter back in the day?  How many times i was screaming "He is not even close!!!" out loud when the warriors did a hamstring on me from a seemingly impossible range. I think this is totally plausible
---
Up until 50's it's pretty easy
---
I think what the other guy said is crazy:
---
&gt; TLDR; There are ample slots for "meme speccs"
---
I just remember clearly having 35-38 people around for raids more than a couple times. Competition for people can be tough with enough healthy guilds and the end of the day a competent body is better than an empty slot. 
---
I'm not saying we should flood guilds with feral druids and shadow priests but I think there will be homes for some of them. The dedicated people who log in early every single raid day and always come with consumable and help other guildies outside of raids with dungeons, attunement, PVP, ZG, etc. Those offspecs will get raid slots.
---
That's not a good sign, bro
---
&gt;I am very interested after reading your charter. Do you have any Warlock or Hunter slots left? I'm currently playing on the beta and deciding between those two. Thank you!
---
you are terribly misinformed.
---
I love it.  The music choice definitely brings me back.
---
*Shallow Mound*
---
I like how he says nothing else is so hard or annoying lol... There's tons of things harder than raid logging
---
Gotta make Razorgore commit fratricide.
---
Could easily program it buff by buff, as to not impact consumes and player buffs, just world buffs.
---
And I don’t see any evidence to suggest that a realm being labeled “PVP” would deter anyone from Roleplaying.
---
But as you said, there were never any RP-PVP realms on launch. So let’s go with the old #nochanges.
---
That's what I'm saying yeah. Watch us get downvoted though, happens every time.
---
whyareyoubooingmeimright.jpg
---
Definitely a big nostalgia trip for me.
---
frost mage pve is boring
---
Yea, for leveling tactical mastery is very valuable esp on a pvp server.
---
This was totally a thing in vanilla.
---
Yeah think you misread. I specifically said I don't want to take that part away, which is why I have a problem with most current questhelper addons because they're essentially what retail does. All I want is quest start icons mainly, so that I don't miss any quests. I want to read the quest text and figure them out for myself, that was the point. There have just been a lot of occasions while playing on a private server that I completely missed quests by not knowing about them, just because I didn't see the NPC.
---
Im still trying to think of some clever hunter name thats based off of it.
---
Been there,  ninja looted the all to coveted bag from magister's terrace and got kicked from the guild after it hit forums,  learned better after that going forward
---
How is it a burden lol?
---
At what level?  Leveling just throw on a sword and board and you're probably fine.  Once you get into the 40's/50's and definitely by 60 you'll want prot talents.  Raid tanking without prot talents no, you'll at best be handling easy off tanking.
---
Sometimes I am sorry for the people in this sub. Total ignorants. Fury Warrior tanks, Druid tanks, race doesn't matter, Axe skill doesn't matter because Thunderfury is a sword...
---
It's like it is going to RAIN with Thuderfuries....NO, IT IS NOT.
---
They cannot be helped. They will REALIZE once they are lvl 60, and they will be asked to HEAL, no tank, the raid leader WILL take an Orc/Tauren for MT/OT and not other race, and asked to stay Fury and DPS and not dreaming at private server meta of Fury tanking...because it's just a dream.
---
Hey new phone backround thanks guy
---
Reputation matters a lot more for pve than for bgs (though in most cases it barely matters there, too)
---
Your time will come...just change your Tinder lol
---
With proper coordination, any 5 characters could do the job, how well it gets done is the question.
---
I don't touch any form of pvp anymore. I haven't since wrath.
---
Vanilla PVP though... That was something altogether different. People died SO much faster and it rewarded a keen situational awareness and solid grasp of the functionality of all of your abilities. An outnumbered player could still come out on top if they were good.
---
Later they started breaking abilities game wide because the people that were bad at pvp couldn't be expected to learn or improve and I lost interest.
---
Druid is not super great for inexperienced players.  Better off with a priest imo.
---
I quit after I hit rank 11. I really just wanted the mounts and the grind to rand 12 and 13 would have been a nightmare.
---
I laughed too hard at this haha :D
---
So true cant wait to have this feeling back again :D
---
Well, what classes do they play so i can start a toon on their counters...
---
Comrade, you miss the point of healing. You do not do it for the glory of a flashing number. You'll do it because it must be done. You'll do it because nobody else can. And if you don't, raids will die. If you tell me that's not enough, I won't believe you. This is what has always set our people apart. A dozen years of sacrifice in our veins. And every healer must know his own suffering. I spit on the monsters who damage us, and I curse the price I have to pay. But I'm making my peace with it, now you make yours. And go into that dungeon. Because it must be done.
---
Should be fine. Half the healers back in the day were really that bad and not paying attention to the raid. Typically most raids were carried by 3-4 healers and the other 3-4 healers would just leech. 😂
---
Best: Warlock T2 (Nemesis)
---
Worst: Hunter T1 (Giantstalker)
---
&gt;I'm a #NoChanges
---
Funny how that statement is always followed by "but".
---
You'll never have any fun with that attitude.
---
pretty bad
---
you looking for a healer too?
---
You are 100% safe, the only thing they can do is tag your mobs.
---
Blessed images
---
Guess everyone will have to wait for that upcoming peer-reviewed research article about BFA's population before anyone can have an opinion then.
---
Not really.  You just need a good weapon early.  You can do ok with a hard hitting weapon and an Arms build even without good gear.
---
Streamer fanboys: Stop bullying my streamer!!
---
Like pvp and raids - warlock
---
Don't forget the variables. I might be able to read 20 pages an hour and actually remember them. I my capabilities into account here. I'm not saying you are slower as a fact. But you could be.
---
For some reason I always recommend healers for fiance's. It seems like a casual way to understand the mechanics of the game while still contributing. I'd potentially steer her in the direction of another healer as druids are the only class without a resurrection which may be necessary if she's still learning the basics causing people to die more often than battlerez CD resets. 
---
The shortcoming of druids in classic are, as mentioned, the lack of a rez. Also, (not sure if you're planning on raiding) but only the most powerful rejuv is kept on each target. Multiple rejuvs dont stack so only the one cast by the druid with the highest spellpower (I believe) is kept on the target. 
---
Alternatives to a druid would be priest, which is often considered the best Classic healer, or pally/shaman depending on faction. Pally  has a simple healing rotation, nearly infinite mana, and a huge tool trunk of helpful spells. Shaman are fantastic raid healers, also have a straight forward healing rotation, and supplement the group well with totems.
---
&gt; And you don't use that much axes as mt. 
---
Yeah...in MC. Go past MC and come back and say again that you won't use axes as much as MT.
---
Dont make her play classic wow
---
Not only what we are learning. But also who is the one learning. We are all different. Some people read and remember faster for example.
---
&gt; Ganking and WPvP with the specific intent of stripping someone's buffs is AIDS
---
Anything that brings further relevance to world PvP is a win in my book.
---
Is it really possible on Beta? I remember watching Asmongold the other day, and they couldn't summon into a dungeon (SM). My own memory confirm that you could not summon into dungeons in vanilla, however, you could summon people already inside your dungeon.
---
Until the healers are geared, then it's dual-wielding Fury warriors all day.
---
I'm saying that when you Queue for battleground and are seeing constantly different groups of people, you are less likely to remember the names on your own server.
---
If you get overwhelmed by different names often enough, each has less meaning.
---
Great reply! Thank you &lt;3
---
this isnt what you were asking...  
---
but dear lord the color schemes of AQ40 gear was atrocious  
---
an amalgamation of colors/designs from clowns and the 1980's
---
No one is denying spriests are really good in 1v1, but they do in fact go oom super fast, thats why you dont use spriests in group pvp.
---
I haven't seen Blizzard acknowledge this yet. Any link would be appreciated.
---
Depends no your definition of gameplay. For me, setting up and preparing with knowledge about the mechanics is gameplay. For others, it is pushing buttons. Neither of the two are particularly exciting by themselves.
---
If you make a genius build that works very well you will enjoy spamming that one ability ad infinitum. Just look at ARPGs.
---
woah there bud, frostfire undisputed champ here
---
While gearing up I don't think most boss fights are still 60 seconds long. Wont most be longer?
---
To be fair it's been a while since I raided in Vanilla, and didn't raid anything past MC on a pserver. But I swear most fights last a little longer than 1 minute.
---
😂😂 my dad isn’t sure what he wants to roll. He’s thinking a warrior. My brother will roll shaman but likes to switch from enhance to elemental. I will be rolling a Druid... or I’m considering a priest.
---
yes.
---
Half the time in my games then people doing ggez are on the team that lost. I remember before the changed it though, things had gotten out of hand. Seemed like every game there'd be some jerk "lol ggez".
---
Says the guy who advocates stacking every buff in the game to cheese all the raid content.
---
Here is the original post sir!
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bwqzql/here\_have\_some\_upscaled\_highresolution\_wow\_maps/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bwqzql/here_have_some_upscaled_highresolution_wow_maps/)
---
Yea they will,  but those people will be blacklisted from content by the rest of the server.
---
My big question was about raiding!
---
There is a difference between lag and leeway. The server and your client would often disagree on where your character was in relation to mobs and other players. This caused things to appear closer or further away than they actually were. This is **not** leeway.
---
...im a firm believer if due unto others....before they due unto me!
---
&gt; Wow, my guild was top on our p-server, we'd go grab the DMF buff together and then just make fun of the guys who got the low %s.
---
He is obviously grossly over-exaggerating how far people on pservers were taking this.
---
I agree with your thoughts for the most part. The buffs were a fun and flavorful way of getting prepared for a raid. I wouldn't mind seeing the buff timers get changed though so that they would continue to tick off when you logged out. 
---
You can pick and choose what buffs you want to go out of your way to get right before a raid. The whole logging out for hours at a time thing is kindof annoying.
---
I don't understand, please explain.
---
&gt;Which do you remember being gamechangers for certain classes?
---
Shaman T2 3 piece was BIS even during TBC until they finally nerfed it.
---
Was it VW DS?
---
&gt;Yea, I usually see a lot of these threads complaining about the game being too easy, no effort needed, etc. Most of those people haven't cleared much in retail, they shut themselves out of it because it's easy to do that.
---
It's not about that.
---
The game turned into all or nothing.
---
Either you can commit to a raiding guild, or you don't get to experience challenging content (not to mention M+ dungeons up to level 8-10). 
---
The leveling was slower, but fun for me, I had to consider my options all the time, and decide my priorities.
---
It's not like the game has nothing to it today. It's just that instead of keeping the good part and expending them, they reinvented the game over and over again.
---
The only thing that remained the same is the theme. When you play wow, the look is different than other games, and that has been consistent throughout the game.
---
Arms tanking isnt viable. Deep prot is good for like 95% of guilds and during prog for sure. Fury dw tanking happens later when threat is an issue. I dont think ive ever seen an arms tank
---
Trigggggered

Why’s that?
---
I'll give you my upvote for your contribution, I do recall this thread but the one I am seeking was posted before this one! It had level requirements for questing areas illustrating directly on the map.
---
This is the first time I feel a bit interested in having a Tinder profile. Never thought I could use it for finding people to play (games) with. It’s been so many years and I no longer have a guild. Feels a bit daunting to start looking for new people, especially when you’re a bit insecure about your CC abilities.
---
PeepeeHands
---
Holy Shock is a PvP ability, really. I never found a use for it in PvE content, either.
---
imagine unironically defending shitty gameplay because you can ignore the game by watching youtube  
---
Is this the peak of classic fanboy delusion?
---
&gt;No, it's the rules and confines that the game sets up. The game doesn't allow your to know where people in stealth are. The entire point of stealth is so people DONT know where you are. When you use means outside the game to find out where a steathed player is, you are acting dishonestly and unfairly in order to gain an advantage. Cheating. Fact.
---
If it were cheating, Blizzard would not take the stance that it is not. The creator of the game, and the arbiter of whether something is permitted or not. The game isn't capable of intelligence, the developers are. Perhaps you're confused about what fact means. You're not using the word correctly since your information is wrong.
---
&gt;Not that it's actually relevant, but where has Blizzard stated it's not cheating? The only thing I imagine they've stated is they won't police it.
---
They've stated it's not cheating. It was further up in this thread, use your eyes.
---
&gt;No one at Blizzard would agree that stream sniping doesn't fit the definition of cheating. The don't officially police it because they have no way to actually prove it 99% of the time lol.
---
\[Citation Required\]
---
&gt;But in other games, Hearthstone for example. Blizzard HAS banned players who constantly harass others via stream sniping, so you're even wrong in this situation.
---
We're not talking about Hearthstone. We're talking about WoW.
---
Because #NoChange shouldn't apply to bug. So yes there is a "but" because of this.
---
I do it for both.
---
Vael isn’t hard to heal, I don’t understand where people get that from. It’s just idiots who let inspiration fall off and skipping stoneshield etc.
---
The unseen hat is the deadliest
---
I cannot justify changing something so core to the experience. I'm really taking a slippery slope argument here. If you can type out a hefty rant that's good enough to make a change to world buffs, then just go ahead and make any argument about any change, fuck it, make that change.
---
World buffs are in vanilla. World buffs stack. There are cooldowns on the world buffs and it's a pain in the ass to deal with. Just like everything else in the game that's a pain in the ass to deal with. That's where the satisfaction comes in. I dealt with this pain in the ass, succeeded, and came out the other side with rewards of gear and epeen.

---
The ZG Priest set is pretty special: 0.5 sec faster Mind Control cast, and improved range on Smite/Holy Fire. Aside from idiots like me trying to make Holy Damage work in PvP, nobody else used this.
---
Best advice I can give you is to let her choose her own class.
---
Druids aren't weak at all, but if you're feral you need to farm Gnomeregan for the [Manual Crowd Pummeler](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=9449/manual-crowd-pummeler).
---
It also depends heavily on what she would like to do in PvP or PvE, and the spec she wants to play.
---
If she learns the class she definitely won't feel weak, because there are a lot of things you can do as a druid that no one else can.
---
If you want jack of all trades, it's definitely better than paladin unless you love right clicking things and hoping for the best.
---
I assume you also didn't like 1337 speak or other classics like omgwtfbbq and roflcopter?
---
I like all the warlock tier sets, especially on humans and orcs.
---
Keep in mind this is before summoning TV's so each summon is taking a soul shard, summoning an entire raid would minus the two people would be 37 soul shards.
---
thanks for sharing this! This is a much better guide for which rank to use than the fixed suggestions in OP's link. The OP's explains why to downrank, this explains what to use.
---
Allows 15% of your mana regeneration to continue while casting. Available as the 3 set bonus of priest and Druid t2.
---
I concur with this. It's not about the powertrip but the fact that there are entirely different metas every bracket.
---
Sign me up.
---
Expose Weakness, the Hunter T2 8/8 bonus:
---
You have a chance whenever you deal ranged damage to apply an Expose Weakness effect to the target. Expose Weakness increases the Ranged Attack Power of all attackers against that target by 450 for 7 sec.
---
&gt;Hard, not what I'd use to sum up classic, but then again classic is different to different people, it's simply a slower paced game to me. I will say it's going to be harder now because my attention span for some games are a lot lower, so it will take more "effort and endurance" to stay focused.
---
I summed it up as "your choices matter", not as hard.
---
And it's not about things being hard, but challenging. That thing that's when beaten makes you feel good, similar to beating a hard battle. 
---
One major difference would be the journey matters, and that you have the journey as well as the endgame.
---
Not getting a bad rep mattered, maintaining a good rep didn't.
---

I did this back in original vanilla with a remote connection tool. It was extremely laggy. Sending commands to my computer took seconds to register, but it allowed me to play at work. As a hunter I could kill stuff with pet and auto attacks so it was still okay.
---
World record is with 100% rested xp, gold from another char, someone who has worked on optimizing the route etc.
---
Most people cant get anywhere near to it if they tried and they dont. 300 hrs is an ok guess. I know my /played was more when I dinged back then..
---
Not allowed in raids. We need those debuff slots.
---
Like someone else said, when you massively out gear the content it doesn't matter and potentially the extra threat might be nice.  Of course you massively outgear the content and it doesn't matter.
---
No dude. Just no. Almost everything you wrote is wrong. You should not be participating if you know you are making stuff up.  
---
1. Weapon skill matters more for a tank than a DPS. In addition to other benefits, weap skill reduces mob's chance to parry which is something that only affects the tank, since dps hit the mob from the back and can't be parried. Tanks want to hit cap, and 5 weap skill means \~3 less hit you need to wear in gear. So, you can be hit capped and wearing tankier gear than say, a Tauren. There are many good axes throughout Vanilla and relying on getting TF is not a great plan.  
---
2. War Stomp is irrelevant in raids. Almost no mobs can actually be stunned by war stomp.
---
3. WoTF is worse than Hardiness. Warriors already have up to 2 fear breaks and hardiness is downright overpowered.   
---
Anyone who played a warrior  tank horde side would know this. Stop making stuff up
---
Lookup Vurtne pvp on YouTube.  He was an amazing world pvp mage from vanilla.  He shows his gear and all the special trinkets, engi gear and when he uses them.  
---
He was very unique at the time and its a fun watch.
---
Melee leeway was definitely a thing in PvP, most likely PvE as well.

It's even in the 1.3.0 patchnotes:  "Spells in PvP now have a slight increase in range and area of effect when targets are moving. This should improve the overall usability of spells and ranged attacks."
---
Extensive research on this has already been made that has confirmed this mechanic, you can read details of it here:  [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HmeFqag7dzkvibcbvcenWtY3XJLihmvmPNtlnqqsEEo/edit#gid=1338343229](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HmeFqag7dzkvibcbvcenWtY3XJLihmvmPNtlnqqsEEo/edit#gid=1338343229)

This is unlikely to change since it is working as intended.
---
Can't install the client yet. It's quite rare for anyone to be able to download a game client about 3 months before the release.
---
It’s ok man I’m getting medical treatment for my ailment. It’s brought on by spinal degradation. Im only in my mid 30’s and thought I was doing everything right in regards to lifting. I obviously fucked up somewhere.
---
Thanks for your concern tho.
---
Can't get anything yet if you're not in any of the beta/stress tests. I imagine it'll be downloadable early though.
---
It's only a few GB compared to the retail client, too.
---
Tremor Totem exists.
---
It’s is not about cheese, like many many have commented on this post, it’s about doing something that takes 1h in less time after you have cleared it 40+ times
---
The best part of it is that you can have multiple instances of that proc on the boss up at the same time.
---
Check willitclassic.com

Dead link :(

thighmane
---
Well you had unlimited mana, but it probably had something to do with countless guilds getting stuck and breaking up before they could complete it.
---
It's harder to tank, particularly when you need 5 geared tanks to do it and have to worry about fire resist at the same time.
---
Usually the client start the dowload a couple of days prior to release.  
---
Just start the client a week or so ahead of release and the client will download it for you.
---
"Priest"...oh now they're going down. Gotta secure the priest.
---
Came to comments to say this.  Warrior + paladin was unstoppable.
---
The answer is gear. You either have spell damage, healing or physical stats on your gear. If you just equip whatever you will do very poorly at everything you do the whole time through. I'd rather have a main boomkin.
---
Well, troll is actually the best threat. But Orc is second.
---
A lot can, but there are just as many that addons can't do.

Why would I log off to keep buffs to clear easy content? I want to play classic to actually play it. Content is easy enough without saving world buffs lol.
---
My guess is the leeway they had built in 15 years ago was offset by the pings/etc. Now that its much more trued up, the offset needs to be lowered. I could also be horribly, horribly wrong.
---
That's an extraordinary piece of work. Also I had no idea SFK had a toilet block with seven cubicles.
---
Don't tauren also get a 7yd attack range (vs other races 5yd)? Would that further affect this?
---
I mean to be honest, this was a whole joke. If i match with any chicks with this caption, i'll take it, but eventually, i'll go back to something basic like "gym, rugby, cooking".

I never understood the reasoning for this look, it's like a cyber spacesuit or something...

&gt;Does it feel bad to parrot phrases such as "oh you sweet summer child?"
---
who cares?
---
Like that dude who called me "TBC baby". Ironically, when WoW was first launched, I was still a soldier in active duty, and had no luxury of being a "Vanilla veteran", like this guy will even know what "Veteran" really means.
---
Why bother replying?
---
Not that I wish that on anyone, but after having attended more than 1 funeral of a friend I had served with, I really find it hard to be insulted by something like "TBC Baby". 
---
And I wish I was a "TBC Baby".
---
Class leaders are big jokes lol.  People making up roles to feed their ego.

I was under the assumption that this would count for world buffs ONLY, flasks and consumes would be safe.

If everything is good for pvp nothing is
---
Dont take ench for de. Make a level 5 alt and have them de everything
---
Super apparent in this video what is going on, I played a mage in classic and if I kited correctly there was 0 chance i ever got hit from max nova range.
---
They don't tho
---
Are you avoiding Judgement just to sound sophisticated?
---
Of the last day, yes :) Warcraft player humor is not for everyone :D
---
fucking legends
---
Leeway on spells is not leeway on auto attacks.
---
&gt; And I don’t see any evidence to suggest that a realm being labeled “PVP” would deter anyone from Roleplaying.
---
It wouldn't, but obviously having a designated realm for roleplaying helps people congregate and build a community around a few select realms. Which if the playerbase for RP-PVP realms is as small as you claim, should matter.
---
&gt; But as you said, there were never any RP-PVP realms on launch. So let’s go with the old #nochanges.
---
/rolleyes
---
It honestly blows my mind that you're going out of your way to argue against something that people clearly want and hurts no one to add. But you do you, man.
---
In a raid of 40 people it is better to have two seperate classes focuses on one role as opposed to two hybrids - think a priest dedicated to healing and warrior to damage would beat two druids trying to a bit of both.
---
The three hybrid classes have incredible healing specs so this is used the most.
---
Hybrids come into their own in PVP where you can be a:
---
Plate wearing holy knight blessing allies and smiting enemies.
---
Nature wielding shaman blasting enemies with the elements while keeping your allies alive.
---
Shapeshifting flag carriers frustrating and eluding the enemy while their team is kept rejuvenated.
---
Still even if you're not rushing, fishing is not mandatory
---
You don't dispel CS. CS when used against an enemy spell cast locks them out of all spells of the same type.
---
You better hope you can live through 9 seconds of warr and frost mage dps because that pally might as well be a npc guard.
---
They are rolling Vanilla out in phases mostly because it is easier for them. They can say it is for the vanilla experience, but it is really so they can test/fix things in phases. They are not testing/fixing Naxx issues right now because it won't be accessible. They cannot start BC and beyond before Naxx is released because after phase 5 they'll be starting work on Naxx phase.
---
Also as others said, they'll want to see how classic does long term first. Also consider new classic content instead of BC. I think you are realistically looking at no less than 3-4 years out for BC. With a high probability it doesn't happen. Most people will have invested in classic and would rather see/push for new classic content at that point. And people who didnt play classic, but would play BC are probably a small minority.
---
Ten storms and elements are the beat in the game
---
Nightslayer 5-set bonus with the Vigor talent lets you delete cloth wearers.
---
To be fair at first glance I thought your name was DownvoteOven.
---
Yeah, I'm not trying to downplay their achievement just make it a little more understandable.
---
i thought all mods on this subreddit just insta deleted everything that has to do with pservers
---
Though, in favor of removing world buffs, I don't think Thursday nights at BRM would be any less of a bloodbath if you took away the world buffs.
---
You have two factions and one raid entered through a choke point, world buffs arent the reason raids were gibbed.
---
Apparently only mechanical keyboards are allowed to use macros.. IDK.
---
Is it really Vanilla PvP without Drowning Pool's "Bodies" or Dope's "Die MFer Die"?
---
When you have 5+ of a single class, you need an officer to manage them. You can’t expect a raid leader to be able to know what all 40+ people are thinking.
---
Cool story, guess you just got lucky.
---
Armor of the Fang
---
(2) + 7 Nature dmg
---
(3) + 2 Staff skill
---
(4) + 11 healing
---
(5) + 10 int
---
The first bonuses aren’t horrible for very specific specs... And you could argue 11 healing and 10 int is actually dope for a level 20 set... except for the fact that the set is pretty much agility/str/stam, so you’d just have a hogepodge of stats, I’d rather have random greens over that.
---
So how can we confirm this wasnt happening in vanilla? When blizzard says it's functioning as intended, the burden of proof is then on us. This seems game-breaking
---
&gt;When everything is out in balance, yeah, private servers raiding is about 10 times EASIER.
---
10 times.
---
Arent you the same guy that made that massive post about Druids being terrible in Classic where you got disprove over and over until you made a new thread?
---
Still too stubborn to admit you are wrong I guess lol.

I only have 1 question, why a shadow? Sorry, but you dont need a shadow to boost 3 warlocks. Makes no sense...

&lt;Centrally Planned&gt; | Horde | NA-PVP | 9:30-12:30 EST/6:30-9:30 PST (Tues/Wed or Tues/Thurs) | Semi-hardcore
---
Introduction: 
---
&lt;Centrally Planned&gt; was formed by a group of folks who met playing modern wow, enjoyed each other’s company, and found communist memes amusing. 
---
Raid Schedule:
---
We will be raiding two nights a week 9:30-12:30 EST/6:30-9:30 PST and will pick between Tues, Wed, and Thurs when it becomes more relevant. We will use loot council made up of a mix of officers and a weekly rotation of raiders with a focus on gearing tanks and healers first. 
---
Player Expectations: 
---
We are listed as semi-hardcore because we all have lives and know some accommodations must be made for that. The officer core is made up of people who are neither in high school nor unemployed with the ability to no-life and play 24/7. That being said, we expect people to come prepared with consumables and arrive on time. As we only will raid six hours a week, we need to be efficient. Players should also aim for at least 80%+ attendance.
---
As we will also wish to continue clearing the raids after MC, the number of players using meme specs will be capped and approved on a case-by-case basis only after you have shown that you are willing to go the extra mile that is needed to perform.
---
The guild will be focused on the PvE content of the game but we are intentionally rolling on a PvP server as it is a pretty fun aspect of the game. 
---
On Culture:
---
&lt;Centrally Planned&gt; is centered around establishing a healthy and comical environment for those looking to progress through classic content with a semi-hardcore attitude focused on personal responsibility. We look to provide an inclusive atmosphere where homophobia, sexism, racism, and the like aren’t tolerated. You don’t need to have a bleeding heart, but if you can’t keep casual bigotry out of guild dealings, somewhere else would be a better fit. 
---
If this sounds like a good fit, come say hey on our discord channel
---

---
Hmm, are you sure armor damage reductions doesn't scale with level ? I could've sworn physical % reduction used to drop with every level gained ( so you'd need more armor for the same % reduction), maybe I'm not remembering correctly, who knows.
---
As for the crushing damage, if that's the case then I was expecting him to take more damage overall for some reason, the concept of being able to tank an actual boss 20 levels above your own without getting 1 shot regardless of spec seemed odd.
---
PS: BC was my fav content and I'd love to eventually see it again. Just think its unrealistic on the timeframes you are considering unless they invest in another separate dev team. Which seems unlikely.
---
"Increases the amount healed by Chain Heal to targets beyond the first by 30%."  
---
Normally, the second tick of your chain heal is 50% less effective, and then 3rd tick another 50% drop.
---
ime it was rare for individuals players to have a server-wide reputation, but guilds certainly did.
---
You knew if you gave your crafting mats to someone from a trustworthy guild, they wouldn't steal your stuff (and if they did, they'd probably get /gkicked for it).
---
Other guilds were known to be full of asshats and griefers. We'd definitely consider guild rep when choosing PUGs.
---
If someone was acting like an asshat from a good guild, we'd pass that along to their guild leader, esp if they were in their recruitment trial period. The sort of person who throws a temper tantrum in a PUG is unlikely to be a reliable raider.
---
People usually put a bit of oomph, so is it *sneeze* HEALTH!
---
About as many people that want RP-PVP want many changes to Classic that would "hurt no one". Achievements, LFG/LFR, Mage Tables, Soulwells, Dual Spec, etc.
---
You don't hear that argument being applied there.
---
Except if World Buffs are in Classic they will be 100% required on day 1.
---
I agree with the giantstalker being the worst! However, I quickly changed my mind one I started getting pieces.
---
This is was the effect of original tier sets when transmog and LFR didn’t exist. It didn’t matter how ugly it freaking looked, you were in love with it and proud to rock it.
---
I can't remember the last time my team lost and somebody ironically did 'ggez'. Most of the time the salt is so heavy they just leave immediately or start flaming.
---
was it added or mulitplied? just curious.
---
You cannot summon inside of instances (currently a warlock on the beta) what is this post for?
---
Yea Orcs are a LOT better than other races. Weapon skill is overpowered, they can also buff their damage further, and Hardiness is the BEST pvp racial in the game. So broken.
---
Always something to be learned mate. Even if you enjoy it still something to be learned.
---
Is it better ? [https://classic.wowhead.com/raid-composition#0ggvBshhjFsccccphhjFsyyycphjjFsspppwhhjFs](https://classic.wowhead.com/raid-composition#0ggvBshhjFsccccphhjFsyyycphjjFsspppwhhjFs)

---
As to the spellbinder fire res buff; it should have a cooldown to cast, on pservrrs it usually doesn't, making it easy to obtain. In vanilla I think it was at least a 1m cd, so your raid would have to split into 4 groups and spend ten minutes in ubrs just to get that buff.
---
Back in Vanilla, I played a paladin, and whenever I would duel geared mages, they would eat through my BoF, then nova into sheep for a frostbolt crit combo for 3-4k. Wait for shield heal, repeat.  
---
It was certainly possible to beat mages with a little luck, but the ball was in their court for the entire fight, especially when they could just poly and run away any time.
---
Actually not true. When the pvp system release you couldnt use the items anymore if your rank decayed.
---
They changed it later on so you were able to still use the items no matter what rank you were as long as you had the needed rank once.
---
See, it's already happening.

Just gloss over that shit if you don't wanna spend 20 minutes reading that's enough to get the idea.
---
&gt; all of those happen constantly on pservers and will happen on Classic as well. 
---
You can ninja loot on private servers first because there are 10k people, instead 3k, and you can "hide" in a bigger crowd, and secondly, because in 6 months you will start on another private servers, so you don't give a fuck on your reputation...AND you do it for FREE.
---
In Classic, ninja looting more than 2-3 times is the equivalent of rerolling on another realm. You will think TEN TIMES before ninja looting in Classic. You are DONE on that server. All your time AND money investment will be lost. Change faction? Sure, fork $20...and it will be for nothing anyway, because the other faction will also know your name, in today's world, with common discords and bnet friends.
---
Change your name? Sure, fork another $20...and again, it will be for NOTHING. People will still find out that you are a ninja looter.
---
So, before ninja looting, think about it : IS IT WORTH IT? And 99% will say : FUCK, NO, IT DOESN'T !
---
Will there be ninja looters? Yes? Will there be as many as on private servers? NO !
---
Because of all the reasons I listed.
---
What's the link to the rogue gear to look out for guide?
---
you could still play paladin on a pve server.

You weave in Aimeds in between autos. That's why slow crossbows like Ashjre'thul ( spelling? ) are so good. Because you can get an aimed in between autos without losing any damage.
---
You don't hear that argument being made because it's wrong. All of those changes fundamentally change the game, even achievements. Adding an RP-PVP realm at launch changes nothing to the game itself.
---
That's fair. I'll accept it.
---
You can tank with any race if you play correctly.  I played a NE warrior in vanilla.  I did all content up to Naxx and the first few bosses in Naxx.  I could tank just fine when asked to tank.  Its all about knowing how to generate threat and having proper gear.
---
&gt;and portals
---
eventually
---
There were multiple r14 human priests on my server, both shadow and disc/holy. Your skill is going to matter far more than your race selection.
---
I would be ok if RP realms got two names but it would probably fuck up whispers and invites
---
Ya that's pretty solid. Can obviously change around you see fit!
---
free food
---
what's not to like
---
Having a dying RP-PVP server get free realm transfers would fundamentally change the game too.
---
So smol yet so perfec.
---
I mean yes but it breaks the fear and ticks every 3 seconds. Doesn't prevent a fear only breaks it. So sometimes it pulses right before the fear and doesn't pulse again for a couple of seconds after the fear has been applied.
---
Rank 13 (and a 1/2) on the Elune server here (Paladin named Crystal). 
---
Totally can attest to what the OP mentioned. One thing that wasn't mentioned though is that at the very least on my server, groups/cliques kind of formed where a chosen person every week would be the main person to reach Rank 14. It ended up being pretty bad for the people who weren't within these groups. If you didn't cooperate, you were blacklisted from the main PvP groups. Sometimes you got in a battleground as a soloer, some people would intentionally lose a game so that you would get less honour points.
---
At least that was my experience. I vividly remember hitting rank 13 and then halfway to rank 14 was a soloer and getting a bunch of whispers every tuesday saying that I "ruined" their honour grind because i was consistently getting the top 1-3 spots in honour week (until people were intentionally losing battlegrounds when i was in one). 
---
It was a pretty harsh grind with lots of hours, and a lot of fun through. But damn there was also so much drama every Tuesday. (anyone else experience these type of things when you were honour grinding back in classic?). 
---
Not sure if i'll do it again, almost seems like the competition would be even crazier this time around
---
All his melee abilities are out of range(actionbar), both warrior and rogue auto-attacks each other from what looks to be roughly 7-8 yards away from each other.
---
Certainly is leeway.
---
If thats the case then im glad they changed it.  Previous beta builds you most definitely could summon inside an instance.
---
Same, plus checking my email and junk folder often in the vain hope of a beta invite. 😔
---
Yeah... visit 11k pop HorseRail private server Barrens Chat and it reads like Asmongold’s twitch chat. There’s a point when the population reaches a critical mass, and people feel comfortable being anonymous in a sea of people. Pair that with absolutely no policing of racism/spamming/threats, and you get a really horrible experience.
---
Basically, can’t wait for August.
---
Read his first sentence again.
---
Don't need to micromanage 40 people unless they're braindead.
---
...yeah, if you don't want to PvP except when it's "fair" (meaning only whenever you say it's OK to PvP), then don't play on a PvP server.
---
Some of enjoy the thrill and danger posed by enemy gankers, the rush of a desperate fight and surviving or winning, the challenge of picking your fights and avoiding clearly superior enemies, and yes, the cathartic justice of doing to the other side the same thing they've done to you.
---
&gt;The average ganker is just shitty, both as a player and probably a person.
---
Deciding people are shitty because they like different gameplay than you is pretty shitty.
---
True but we don't see any of the other cartels do anything of importance. The only goblins that have done anything since Cata is Bilgewater who are all horde
---
At work, so posting here to reference later and add to discord.
---
Look for 1.12 addons.
---
Google will give you about a billion sites where you can look.
---
True! But it effectively constitutes realm engagement as guilds needs to talk i believe. So might also be a good thing.
---
Play retail...  or go outside?  Whatever makes you happy!
---
It's lag and desync, not leeway. There is one laggy autoattack at 3:46, but both the warrior and rogue walked into eachother for to happen. 
---
Remember, leeway is consistent. They should be hitting eachother throughout the time the rogue is walking after 3:46, but they don't because there was no leeway.
---
Actually no, but I'll take that as a compliment. If you know a good vid I'd love a link.
---
Thata like ultimate druid leveling gear,giving you literally everyrhing you can ask for at low level and also giving you ability to tank dps or heal if needed
---
Kinda wish we could go back to that, honestly.  
---
Your mount felt like part of your identity before the change.
---
Will it be possible to turn XP gain off in 1.12?
---
Ah great, so your argument has come full circle now. Later dude.
---
Hey mate, I hope you make the world record for most degrees in the world.
---
No I mean like actual issues. Wand is extremely inconsistent to toggle. Pets have some really bad issues with passivity and combat. The last bit about DS is valid, but suppression wasn't maxed for me until 39.
---
You don't *need* any of that. Titans, inspiration (30% armor) and Stoneshield will solve all your gear issues by a metric mile. That boss is going to be blown away when BWL releases today because people know how to play, and we are five major patches in.
---
This'll probably go over about as well as a wet fart in church... but....
---
I want to be an enhance shaman specced into Enhancing Totems (+15% str and agi), Improved Weapon Totems (+30% AP bonus on WF totem), and Totemic Mastery (+10 yard range) swinging Nightfall to add a debuff for magic damage dealers.  As far as I understand, some raid compositions like to stack warrior DPS, might be handy to have enhance shaman specced to help other melee dps.
---
Is it ideal?  I don't know, probably not.  
---
Can it work?  Sure.  
---
Is it what I would like to do in end game raids?  Yes.  
---
Will I have to wait around to find a guild interested in a deep enhancement shaman to bring to raids?  Yeah, probably.  But I rather do that than be a chain heal bot all over again.
---
/ducks
---
like =/= mandatory, thats why you have skinning while grinding beasts, to keep cooking up. Each to their own I guess.
---
&gt;is not a test of skill or really good for the game in any way. 
---
Neither is making a Warlock farm a million soul shards and having them not stack in his bags, or having respec cost out-price the average player from switching specs with any frequency. 
---
And I'm all for those types of QoL improvements in Vanilla, but the problem is who decides what's worth changing? If any QoL changes are made then there will be people who throw a fit because something was changed, and then more people throwing a fit because the thing they wanted changed wasn't.
---
I mean there were addons during classics initial release
---
Previous beta builds? Do you have any examples?
---
What's great about vanilla is if you rage hearth or ninja or anything that people deem bad enough they can /world and call you out on your shit which will probably get you blacklisted from groups for a while, or if it's repeated behavior you'll become infamous and no one will want to raid with you
---
im saying the problem in raids wont be survivability that becomes the  healers problem and the warriors ability to use shield block
---
your entire raid will be threat capped thus prolonging the fight
---
basically the best defense is a good offense.
---
That's true. I would still prefer it didnt work that way because having buffs tick away while logged out would not solve the issue of world buffs really. It would just make it even more annoying to get them.
---
You win, the hardest 5% of content that less than 1% of players care about, in the game nobody plays anymore is harder than Classic.
---
Chapeau*
---
No, I can only say that I've been focused on normal +defense gear in complete MC and Ony. Only exception, for Kazzak I had some shadow resistance gear, he did not much physical damage.
---
Hes probably not in the minority sadly, i had my own list of 3 or 4 chuckleheads I wouldn't group with but I that was my own personal list from experience... I didnt look up any 'blacklists' and it wasnt like server wide knowledge who was a dick and who wasn't.... 
---
Now if you ninja loot some bindings as a mage or something you might become server famous and not get many groups. Normal griefing doesnt make enough news in my opinion to have a significant impact.
---
Always liked priest tier sets from t1 to t8 (when it became generic recolored cloth gier)  each and every set lookes special and amazing
---
So a lot of this depends on what your role is in the raid and how far into the launch we are. 
---
Early on main tanking, or even one of the primary off tanks you should be speced into prot. The prot tree grants a lot of mitigation along with threat increases talents like Defiance. If you're not speced prot in the beginning your raid must be extremely good, or extremely patient with your squishiness. 
---
Later on down the road as MT or off tank you have a little more freedom to go down prot and arms, but in my opinion some prot talents are still amazing to grab. Things like Last Stand, Defiance, imp shield block, anticipation if you're struggling with def cap. 
---
Ultimately I think all MTs should be speced into Prot. I don't think the fury tank spec is going to be too viable in classic since the /sit macros wont proc enrgage, and the high parry % of boss's. Arms is okay, but again if youre the MT you should probably be the best MT you can for your guild.
---
Ok ty :)
---
I'm used to the deadzone. I like dealing with the deadzone.
---
But the deadzone AND leeway? Just no PvP for Hunters, basically?
---
Smh
---
Posting to reference later. At work and can't add on discord currently.
---
Yes, his guild wasn't total NEETs, so they could play whatever they want. That's what he said. Vanilla content isn't hard enough that you need to minmax everything.
---
No special treatment for RPers. Say it with me now.
---
Lfr is harder content than most of classic. M+ is much harder. Im a huge fan of vanilla but youre fooling yourself if you think classic playerbase will overtake retail for longer than a month and thats already giving classic a mega launch. Theres no MMO out there that comes close to even current retail playerbase
---
I think I'd disagree until you have the raid in question on farm status.
---
This is where I stand pretty much. Content will be cleared regardless so worldbuffs adds some extra flavour.
---
Nobody outside the group will care if you leave early. The only people, if any, you remember are the ninja looters.
---
Posting to reference later, currently at work.
---
Just don't dude. If it's that much of a problem for you, just stay away. Seriously.
---
Now you’re just pushing it
---
I agree. Arms isn't a PvE specc at all.
---
Your example is stupid. The difficulty of Classic will be understood by ANYONE who will play it, the moment they play with bad players.
---
It takes ONE IDIOT in a 5 men run to make it a 3 hrs nightmare in Classic, and will probably no finish it.. In retail, even of ALL of the 5 players are IDIOTS, they will still finish the run in 15 min.
---
The difficulty of Classic is on par or harder than Retail. There is NO PLACE for mistakes. Just like in mythic raiding or higher m+ keys.
---
99% of the Retail content can be done by stupidly bad players. It cannot be done in Classic with JUST one of them being a stupidly bad player.
---
Classic is far more difficult...because bad players (which are the majority) are making it difficult. Retail is far more easier, because IT IS DESIGNED for bad players.
---
You CANNOT fail most content in Retail even if you are playing a melee Warlock. You will get through 90% of the content even if you are dumb as a rock.
---
Classic will be much more difficult than Retail, for over 90% of the content.
---
Yes and no. 
---
In theory if you get access into one of the stress tests or you're in the beta, you can download the basic addons you're going to use and set them up on that character. After that you just copy your WTF / Interface folders out onto your desktop and wait for the real classic client to drops so you can put them in there.
---
You'll have to update your addons to get them to work more than likely, but at least you'll have hot bar configs done.
---
So what do they need the warlock for?
---
It's not desync.
---
They aren't hitting eachother after 3:46 because the rogue is backpedaling, you don't get leeway if either player is backpedaling or RP walking, you would know this if you read the google doc.
---
He only got hit in the first place because he strafed briefly.
---
It didn’t happen to anyone. It’s one of those made up things.
---
FYI, there is no RP enforcement on RP servers. Y'all should just make one of the PvP servers an unofficial RPPvP server.
---
These people have the mentality that there is content waiting for us that hasnt been figured out for 15 years. You're good man. Roll a tank, e noy the game, you'll find a home.
---
All is revealed....
---
The guy asked about tanking raid content and here you’re talking about pvp racials and blood fury.
---
Cool story and insight into an alternative method to achieve rank 14!
---
No. Orc stun resist racial is by far the best PvP racial in the game. If you're planning to PvP and roll something other than Orc, then you're making a huge mistake.
---
Orc also the best for fury dps, because of the +5 axe skill. Warriors compete with rogues for swords &amp; daggers, so they will probably end up using more axes. I.E. [onyxia axe](https://classicdb.ch/?item=17068) fury warriors will have no competition for it unless there is an enhancement shaman.
---
I don't think anyone will avoid PvP completely. Why raid and not use the raiding gear for PvP? I think it's stupid to roll a troll for marginal better threat generation, while giving up the by far best PvP racial in the game.
---
Can they?  I thought you could use stoneform to prevent blind, but not get out of it while already blinded.
---
Think of Hybrids like a Prius. Let's use Druid as our Prius. It uses electricity to go for the most part (DPS) but sometimes it needs to swap over to gas (Off heal/tank) when it needs to. There's plenty of times where the tank loses aggro or the healer dies and a Hybrid steps up to ensure the team still works
---
new copypasta?
---
Sooo, see you in Classic?
---
Hope it works out for you and you’ll find your healer for life or someone for a bit of casual exp.
---
Still, there definitely should be a matching service for gamers.
---
Bump this because it’s important
---
You are the one claiming it doesnt work when people are sitting on streams doing it every day.
---
You post proof :)
---
More like due to lack of raiders in general. The hardest part of vanilla raiding is actually building a 40 man group that can raid on a semi-regular schedule.
---
Show me on the doll where the bad Blizzard touched you.
---
Netherwind Regalia (T2) 8-piece bonus was pretty amazing. 
---
&gt; 8 pieces: 10% chance after casting Arcane Missiles, Fireball, or Frostbolt that your next spell with a casting time under 10 seconds cast instantly.
---
Since arcane missiles counted each projectile as a separate cast meant that you had 3 chances for each channel to proc it. This meant that you could do some insane burst, this was never really BIS but really fun.
---
That's very similar to the one I was thinking!! Thank you very much :D Wish I had enough reddit currency to reward you lol.
---
It's been that way for as long as I've played WoW. I've always played on PvP servers and it was always a toss up whether people attacked each other. I remember countless times where my group was sitting peacefully with an alliance group outside a 5-man while we both waited for the rest of our parties, because we just wanted to do the dungeon.
---
I'd say BFA brought more world PvP to WoW than there has been in a long time. Between the crates that drop and the bounty system. I haven't played in a few months but whenever I wanted WPvP I was always able to find it.
---
NEVER apologize for sharing your thoughts. They have value.
---
They fixed it
---
Well said. This thread is full of RP-PvE carebares.
---
&gt; Aimed &gt; Auto &gt; Multi &gt; Auto &gt; Aimed &gt; Auto and so on.
---
That's what I mean, it's part of the rotation and doesn't pause Auto Shot. Like you said, you fire an Auto Shot pretty much immediately before and after an Aimed Shot. You cast it in between auto shot swings. 
---
When you said "pause" I understood you meant it would stop the auto shot swing.
---
BGs don't reward xp.... but no you can't turn it off
---
Once it hits your lips it’s so good! Come on honey, grab the kids, we’re going raiding!
---
And the comment I originally replied to was "it doesn't matter if your not in a top 50 guild"
---
My point was there is a big spectrum of guilds, it's not just "plays 100 hour a week world first" or "lets meme specs in they don't care it's just a game!". Most somewhat serious guilds don't fuck with meme specs unless it's their IRL friend and they make an exception.
---
The main tank I ran with in vanilla was a female, so your stereotype is now crushed.  Also, she was very good and taught me a ton about warrior tanking.  Great lady, great tank, great raid leader.
---
Healing Touch Rank 4, trained at level 20, gets the full +heal bonus and is .5 seconds quicker cast than higher ranks.
---
You might cast a Rank 1 healing spell in order to fish for a crit for the armor bonus if your talents allow for it.
---
You are correct, especially about the cast time information provided in the article. It indicates that you should use a lower rank in order to get a heal off "in a pinch" which is not smart as the heal size and efficiency would be negligible. For healing needed in a pinch you should use other available options i.e. use Flash Heal or Nature's Swiftness.
---
I honestly fucking hated world buffs with a passion.  one death and it all goes to waste.  One misstep off the flight path towards the instance and it goes to waste.  One group of enemies on my server and portion of the raid lose the buff.  
---
The only ones I really liked was the Nef and Ony buff, because we could clear up to a boss, get the two hour buffs, and then get one clean attempt to try and down the new boss with full consumes after we saw we were close and the raid understood where to not stand in the fire.  I'm still pretty sure they got removed on death and you got one chance with the dragon slayer buffs.
---
Making Azeroth Great Again.
---
15 spirit is definitely a tangible buff. If one piece of gear had 15 more spirit than another it would be a decent upgrade.
---
I assume you want to do PvP? In this case you'll have quite hard times raiding. If it is just about doing damage and tank some stuff, you could go fury like 5/31/15 or just a plain 20/31/0 (but this is only for off tanking)
---
imagine thinking getting world buffs is tryhard/ neckbeardy, got some real low standards there, how's bfa going?
---
You can down the first flame walker dude in MC with level 58 dudes in greens if you really want.
---
One, he said nothing about “no changes”. Two, there were plenty of addons in vanilla wow to do those things you listed.
---
So many retailer-RP-PvE carebares who complain because they dont have the time to invest into classic so they cry for the bar to be lowered to fit their schedule and Safe-zone mentality.
---
It's a damn good looking set.  Was honestly in contention for my number 3
---
No problem, hope it helps :)
---
&gt; If you are doing half the healing of the other healers and nobody is dying, it's because the other healers are keeping them up
---
Everybody in the raid has a part to play. It's a team effort, not a group of 40 individuals when raids are most effective. When someone is literally doing half the production of the other players, it's obvious that there will be limits on what they can do. But a skilled player can still keep rolling Hots on the tank or save someone from death with a well-timed big NS, or b-rez someone when the group needs it the most. It might not produce OMG numbers on the meters, but the difference will be felt in the raid.
---
&gt;Sure, this won't be every guild, sure the top voted counterargument would most likely be "LOL jus join a guild that doesn't do that KEK!" But I think everyone will be in for a surprise: When it becomes common knowledge how easymode this shit makes the game, I bet you that most guilds will require you to bring them, or at least a minimum of DMT+Ony+ZG. This is how the meta is on pservers, worldbuffs being so powerful means that guilds pretty much require you to bring them to every single raid, going as far as even the foulest shitter guilds will lootban you and kicking you for repeated offenses if you show up without buffs.
---
this is just not true, you must be living in some bubble in your guild/guilds on private servers. I've raided on private servers from nost &gt; early ND days, and my guilds never required world buffs (one of which ended up clearing kel'thuzad). Didin't require flasks either. Usually only the basic consumes like elixirs/potions. Some people would usually go get world buffs by themselves, and share the instance ID in like dire maul with others in the guild if they wanted it, but it was up to every person to decide for themselves if they wanted to do that. 
---
This is way more common on private servers than the top 1% that go collect all world buffs as a raid. And keep in mind on classic the community will probably be noticeably less hardcore than private servers, so requiring world buffs will be even less common, especially when they will be such a pain in the ass to get in classic compared to private. 99.9% of guilds will just not bother with world buffs. 0.1% of top speedrunners/hardcores will. 
---
&gt;And come on now really, would you want to raid in a guild that didn't bother using the resources available to them to improve their raid?
---
if getting those resources requires more time than they'd save you in raid times? hell yeah, 99.9% of people will be happy to have their guild skip world buffs, again, especially on classic when they will have a 6 hour server wide CD and would require insane nolifing/dedication to reliably get for every raid.
---
Giantstalker looks great on female characters.  It's the open thighs that make it ugly on dudes.
---
I agree. I have this whole “athletic” schtick that I emphasize with how I dress, so I think people think I don’t game, that I just spend all my time on the field or in the gym, when in reality, I sit in my DXRacer and play games. I wouldn’t mind a nerdy chick that UNDERSTANDS the concept of games and MMO’s and not the fake “I’m a gamer girl” facade
---
The biggest reason why this will not happen is that blizz is a business. Splitting the wow playerbase in 2 is scary enough. Now imagine splitting it in 3. No business in their right mind is going to do this until they have their backdoor analytics on what happens with the first split. Plus this is a subscription based game. You release new content to keep people who have completed things subscribed. In the past the transition from vanilla to wrath saw substantial increases in sub numbers. Since that formula worked they will probably emplore a similar strategy.
---
POM+Conjure water
---
So good even DKs are claiming it. SMH
---
Oh I see - like bugs. Yeah that would be frustrating.
---
Personally, I think you should max Suppression sooner as it will really improve your TTK and Uptime (based on your issues with Imp DS Procs). But that decision is of course up to you. When I level in classic I will prioritize these talents in this order:
---
1. Imp Corruption
---
2. Imp Drain Soul
---
3. Imp Voidwalker
---
4. Suppression (5/5)
---
The respecc to SL at lvl 42
---
Other than the main tank, who should be full prot until very late, you can off tank in raids fine in arms.
---
It's not optimal, but i ran something like this through AQ40 as a dps/off tank: https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/BTzNzEzQATAD8ASg
---
You can get rid of the defense bonus once you've geared up and move that to armor.
---
Notice that the only 2 big things you don't have are shieldslam and last stand.
---
Yeah, I was looking forward to world chat with restricted topics, largely because there is an election coming up and imo world chat is going to be a cesspool for a while.
---
You just described why Classic is great, in a nutshell. Players can't be easily replaced, so we take time to teach each other.
---
Plus, the same guy will be around later, so teaching him pays off for you as well.
---
Chat is going to be very similar on actual release.
---
It scales in the sense that 4k armor is +50% DR against level 40 mobs, but ~40% DR against level 60 mobs, so it is only dependent on the attacker's level, not your own. That's why your DR seems to drop when you level up. It always calculates the damage reduction against an enemy the same level as you in the character sheet.
---
Mc and bwl are easy enough it doesn't matter. Aq you'll start to notice a difference. For naxx, you really need to work on preparedness. Lower dps = more consumes to get through a fight = more gold your guild needs to farm. When you're spending 30+ prot pots a night, you're not going to enjoy having people pulling 300dps in your raid.
---
Certain ranks is not the same as different ranks.  A certain rank would be like healing wave rank 7.   You should have at least 2 ranks for every casted heal.
---
Ret uses different gear than rogues and fury warriors. You need a pally in the tank group either way for devo aura and/or Nightfall.
---
The amount of meat she gets is unreal
---
This, again?
---
Mage will be nicer.
---
We will need an update
---
Yup. If you were a dick back on the day, people would remember you and not play with you. So when people were toxic or scummy they would be punishing themselves later on. 
---
Ironic that players punishing toxicity is more satisfying than the  game creators.
---
It's a long hard road for mages, it was my main in Vanilla.  Got full T2.  I don't think I got any tier in Naxx unfortunately.  But man you look like a complete clown until Frostfire.  Enigma isn't terrible though.
---
Brigands have the run of these games. Keep to the side path; classic is just ahead.
---
This isn't a bug, it's working as intended. He is exploiting the correctly functioning mob pathing.
---
If you have that little self-control, perhaps you should find a new hobby.
---
I got one in the comments above. That’s about it lol
---
Oh, the blacklist guy dosen't know debuff priority. That honestly tracks.
---
What do you mean get ahead? Of what? Mining game?
---
Lol!
---
Yes, I see now what you were saying.
---
I thought they had mentioned that we’d be able to “create characters” early, not just reserve names, which would mean being able to actually choose class, race, features, etc. which would be in client.
---
I can understand your point but you need to realize that raid time is special time. You can't have 40 of your raiders online to clear raids at all times of the day, so you spend a little bit extra time outside of raid time, to make sure the raid time is more efficient, and you can clear all the content within the raid time. Goodluck clearing AQ BWL MC ZG AQ20 in a raid night without wbuffs.
---
Let’s go!!!
---
Lol somebody is butthurt.
---
Even then, 5 weapon skill is not really a "slight" difference. You have to wear roughly 3% more  hit so your abilities dont miss. This makes an orc warrior tankier as he doesnt need to wear as much threat gear.
---
gratuliere!
---
What if you're a male gnome named Homunculus?
---
Not really, you'll blow through all the content in a month doing that.
---
No-one did this shit back in vanilla. It only started when the pserver autists crunched numbers in excel.
---
Sounds perfect for you, enjoy the rabbit hole. But what do you do that you can work and game at the same time?!
---
&gt; I assume you want to do PvP?
---
You caught me red-handed.
---
Wow is like a 2 hour a day game
---
Either it's useless because it always gets knocked off or it's not useless and it's knocking something else off.
---
Yea if this doesnt get fixed I will have to switch mains. This will just destroy hunters in PvP.
---
&gt; don't think there's a mining trainer in Teldrassil, nor any mineral nodes there as well.
---
You remember correctly.
---
Okay buzzkill.
---
Of course I read the google doc - that's a bug on classic, that leeway isn't being applied while backpeddling or walking. I linked two clips above on how it's scuffed.
---
In the video, you can see them walk into eachother, into melee range. It might look slightly weird due to desyncing. No evidence of leeway, because it wasn't in the game.
---
you can effectively modify the art asset on your end. many people do this either for some extra transmog options... or to make stealthed rogue look like ragnaros.
---
also, the size of the hitbox doesn't depend on the size of the model.
---
Thats a really bad argument.
---
You dont require all 40 players to be online together in order to get buffs. Players can do it on their own.
---
The reason you want them is because the logistics of getting 40 players online, on time, and have them focus for several hours straight is difficult. The longer your raid goes on the higher the probabilty is that someone fucks up, disconnects or need to leave the computer.
---
World buffs significantly cut down on the time required for everyone to be on at the same time which means less chance that something unforseen happens mid raid. You use the buffs simply because the time together as a full raid is so valuable.
---
Lol - yeah you have a game on your hands.
---
If you only play one character then there is an "end" as far as big progression - there is always plenty to do and I recommend a pvp server :)
---
Blizzard Devs are all LIZARD PEOPLE! Wake up America! They are trying to steal all our cheese! Protect your cheese with guns sovereign citizens! /s
---
"They are trying to make money off you, keep you in the game for as long as possible."
---
UUUUH DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUH. This post is so laughable. See you Classic, self-proclaimed lion!
---
I’m in almost the exact same boat as you, only difference was I was still playing FFXI when vanilla came out. A bunch of my group left for vanilla wow but I didn’t have the hardware for it until TBC. Everyone there viewed it as the casual mmo as well.
---
I can’t wait, I tried the private server as well and it’s simply just a lot of fun.
---
Since he made the claim he has the burden of proof. I've only disputed the claim (with personal experience). I could upload a video later today but that seems like a waste to dispute a claim made with no evidence.
---
Perceptive of you…
---
If someone ever wants to PvP, then there's no point in rolling anything other than Orc. This goes not just for warriors, but also for rogues, hunters, warlocks, and shamans. If you're playing one of these classes and will PvP, then Orc is the only option.
---
Hardiness is by far the best PvP racial in the game. Nothing else even comes close.
---
Ele shaman&gt;S priest
---
Both with equal and leet gear obviously. 
---
Especially with a few nades, magic dusts, and rocket helm =P
---
Purge is too stronk against priests
---
My native language is neither french nor english, but for some reason it has always bothered me how there are "correct" english pronunciation of actual french words.
---
Most foreign languages have loanwords from english as well with their own "correct" pronunciation, which can also be quite annoying.
---
Respect the languages, dammit!
---
ZG buff isn't lost on death and 6 hour onyxia buff isn't going to chance shit. Do you know how I know it won't change shit? Because warchiefs blessing used to have a 6 hour cd on pservers for the longest time, and guess what, people still got the buff(well the melee's who are the ones who truly benefit from it), it just took more time which was annoying. And that's a buff that's harder to organize because it's part of the onyxia attunement, for rallying cry you have to clear a raid to get it, this means you can talk with people who have it and make a deal across your faction to not buff the buff on x even before the first guild starts raiding and then everyone who's raiding on that evening logs on to get it and logs off.
---
I don't think the small amount of time between hitting Darnassus and Darkshore is worth changing which profession you pick. Just do a small bit of catch-up mining once you hit the mainland.
---
I'd say so.
---
It takes most people between 10-20 days of playtime to hit level 60 alone. The world record was just under 5 days.
---
The "highest level" of WOW classic is going to be full autism like you are describing dude.  These psychos are going to do all the excessive and mundane shit you are describing just to shave seconds off kills in their speed runs that barely anyone is going to care about.  Just save yourself a headache and join a decent high end level guild that is going to get the barebones world buffs, but don't go full retard.  Like you said, the content is easy.
---
a different mentality yes.
---
Mostly people realizing 2v1 , ganking someone 10 lvl lower, or attacking someone at 10% HP after he just fought 2 mob... get really boring, really quick, for the vast majority of the playerbase...
---
Lock sets look amazing on every race.  One reason I'm tempted to main one.
---
&gt;Same for Hakkar head.
---
Any evidence for this? Onyxia/Nefarian head has a 6 hour cooldown because their heads are physically hanging from the gates of Stormpine or impaled in Orgrimmar.
---
ZG buff has no visual indicator.
---
Idk...early wrath was amazing,once ulduar patch hit and stats became free it became a bit shitty and toc was just a nail in the coffin(as i quit at that point i cant say from my own personal exp but from what i read it all went downhill from that point)
---
Did you ever watch unforgotten realms
---
How dare you besmirch the honor of House Prestor! I will run you through from nape to chops! *duel flag*
---
Is stolen silver bugged? Ive killed about 100
---
Yep.
---
Especially at launch when all the try-hards are rolling engineering.
---
I have this feeling as well. And the /r/wow sub is gonna be super duper annoyed by it. I am really curious about WoW's future considering the success this will be. Do they focus development on TBC/new vanilla content? Or do they still have main focus on the next big expansion to BFA? time will tell.
---
Right, so put away the Quel’Serrar and buy a blue axe from the auction house because you’re an orc.
---
What the fuck am I even looking at here
---
Are there trainers for mining in Darkshore?
---
Mark my words, someday you'll see an uprising from the downtrodden of Westfall and a Blackrock orc invasion in Northshire because of this.
---
Maybe this will shock you, but she is Onyxia.
---
&gt;ZG/Dragonslayer/Warchief's Blessing were on 6-12 hour cooldowns
---
Where is the evidence of ZG and WCB having cooldowns? I constantly see them mentioned as having a CD but nobody seem to be able to confirm this.
---
Glad it's not just me, I've never liked it.  The chest and legs look more like spandex than plate, the helm is dumb and the shoulders don't do anything for me.
---
Here is the proof that you CAN summon inside instances: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/437180429?t=03h49m55s

 I've never liked this set. The chest and legs look more like spandex than plate, the helm is dumb and the shoulders don't do anything for me.
---
gamers rise up!
---
Hey mate, don't waste your hope on such things. It's really not my goal. I wish I knew what my goal is :(
---
100% true in my Vanilla experience. The better players on my server knew most of the jerks and would avoid them like the pox. My guild (a large and popular one) would purge members who consistently screwed over others. It was rare but it happened. Server reputation was absolutely a thing and I, for one, am looking forward to that sense of community again.
---
Swipe right. Gonna heal alliance side. Looking for a dps to duo level, preferably a warlock.
---
Be one of the first guilds to clear Naxx and then keep clearing it for a few months until they release TBC.
---
I know how to pronounce it.  But it's much more fun to call it a chap-y-u
---
When do you suppose it got introduced into the game then?  
---
Are the TBC and 3.0.2 videos "desycned" as well? \^\^
---
There's no point debating over this, will just have to wait for blizzard to confirm it.
---
I would also like to complete naxx in Classic - With naxx being cleared and guilds being completely geared, I'd imagine they will be running it for a while.
---
It's such a long way to go for that so who knows how it will play out per server / faction :)
---
Funny how Anduin got older but these didn't.
---
Forgive me for being so blunt, but you have been proven to state things that are true in this subreddit a LOT. 
---
Please give me a source on world buffs other than Dragonslayer having a cooldown.
---
Being the IT guy at a small(15 employee) company. I keep the system stable and if there is any problem i usually fix it remotely. Even if there is "lots of work" it means i work 4-5 hrs max.
---
I don’t think 60s are going to camp 20s.  There’s too much to do at 60, and too many alts to level.
---
Highly doubtful they will release tbc
---
15 minutes? Mate you have no fucking idea what you are talking about and choose to be so confrontational.
---
DMF is random so you have to re-roll it dvery two hours. Songflowers could take your raid many hours if the six nodes are on 30 minute timers. FFS you could be forced to grab Paladin blessings for Horde via mind control in front of the MC entrance to do a 15-20 minute MC.
---
In vanilla only a small portion of the player population ever stepped foot into naxx before the expansion.  If you are wanting to be in a naxx guild, then you are probably looking at \~30-40 hours per week over an extended period of time.  That is if you are pretty efficient in your non raid times.  Naxx wont be puggable for a long time if ever.  If you want o be in a guild that can clear naxx then you are going to need some real dedication to the game.
---
His name is Kurdram Stonehammer, a Dwarf in Auberdine.
---
until you go oom after one fight. or until you fall asleep from your 5
---
button class. or until you reroll cause guilds can only bring 1 spriest. or until you realize you have the shortest range of any ranged class, by a considerable amt too. or until you get sick of having 1 peel in psychic scream on a hefty cooldown.... idk man, i love the class fantasy but in reality spriest is pretty lame. more power to ya
---
But he was in the instance being summoned further in the instance, that did exist at one point in Vanilla. The issue would be summoning people from OUTSIDE the instance into the instance which I do not believe works in the beta.
---
No, it really isn't.
---
This should just encourage you to have people you can call on when it happens. It kind of reinforces the "sense of community" everyone keeps referencing.
---
Yeah man this pic looks like shit and doesn't really show anything lol.
---
Love the dungeon set bonuses. Mages was chance to freeze attacker for 2 sec. Priest was chance to grant sheild when being attacked
---
Hey man, Stormwind is under threat and needs to keep their troops close. Westfall has their own militia and Duskwood has a guard force. We've got troops on the bridges and strategic routes, it'l be fine.
---
you wold be wrong to think that.
---
It can also affect cast times
---
When I was a shithead teenager, I programmed my Lego mindstorms to randomly press movement keys in AV so I could AFK
---
Stopped reading on hunter disadvantage "outdoors PvP".
---
Proof of these accusations?
---
Thanks for that. I can confirm that it no longer works, or at the very least it doesn't in SM Cath. I'll test ZF when I get home but I assume it's already been fixed or someone else is already testing it as I type this.
---
For me these types of situations weren't about hurting the jerks it was about not hurting good players with their presence.
---
!remindme 2 years
---
My goal is to play this game until star citizen is released, so probably forever.. :)
---
&gt; Probably 50-60k+ hrs over 15+ years 
---
60.000 hours over 15 years is roughly 11,5 hours/day for 15 years, wow lol
---
OP's combo has a good chance of killing any other combo, paladin warrior excepting of course. 
---
Paladin and warrior though can take on groups of people and keep going.
---
Oooh, warlock was what I was going to roll.
---
I can get to Reddit from work, but can't get to WoW sites.
---
This was my main gripe with the article too. Rank 1 flash of light begins to be very useful after you get a decent amount of +healing.
---
Paladin downranks too.
---
Yea only the brain dead can’t remember ever classes abilities and what gear they want.
---
I'm on the beta since a week now. I keep a casual multiplayer style ( no minmax, no unnecessary grind, no long sessions, no group decline ) and I've been surprised by the efficiency of groups, especially duos. 
---
I think group leveling is only bad for solo players. If you're the kind of person who likes to play with his crew after work it becomes an advantage in Classic. 
---
Sure you will ding 60 maybe a few weeks after those zombies who memorized Joana's guide but srsly who cares

|-|-|-|-|-|-|
---
It’s common knowledge in anything that people avoid things they don’t like. But the idea that the server comes together and outcasts these people just isn’t true.
---
Another one: https://youtu.be/44BlKx7N1pE?t=2531
---
Songflower is a nice buff that an entire raid is able to get from a single flower, and I understand that this was bugged in Vanilla to allow simultaneous clicking by multiple individuals. Or was it intended?
---
It would be great to be able to confirm this in Beta - I'm not sure that a solo player could farm the salve to cleanse a plant on their own, but maybe a party can test it?
---
You say you don't have any PvP experience as a hunter and then you state they're bad at "outdoors PvP"... You clearly have no idea what you're talking about.
---
Grabbing everything at the level OP is talking about is only for the extreme guilds that want to compete at speed running.  There really is no point to it otherwise.  The content in Vanilla is too easy to care.
---
Blasphemy
---
its not
---
What a stupid post
---
If they do a TBC server, I would bet on it being a completely new fresh start server ... I find it hard to believe they would splinter the classic community that badly... BUT I GUESS YOU NEVER KNOW.
---
# [Horde, EU, PvE server] &lt;The Muffin Vendor&gt;
---
Hello there!
---
“The Muffin Vendor” is recruiting people interested in playing Horde on a PvE server. We’re going to be making a guild for end game content, including PvE and PvP as well. That, of course, doesn’t mean we only want raiders and pvpers. Anyone interested in having some fun is welcome!
---
**Who are we?**
---
We’re a group of friends who have played Warcraft together after meeting about 7 years ago. We all played Vanilla at the start as I’m sure a lot of others have. We’ve got experienced raiders from all across the timeline of Warcraft, and we’re all avid fans of the Lore.
---
The guild itself has some background in vanilla as a raiding guild. So there is plenty of experience there as well!
---
**What we offer?**
---
First of all, we offer all you may need to make your levelling experience as fun and enjoyable as possible. From help with dungeons and group quests, to experienced players willing to introduce you to the game, to an active and bustling chat which will keep you engaged even through the dullest grind sessions.
---
Second, we offer a productive and organized environment to let you experience everything Vanilla’s endgame has to offer: dungeons, raids, battlegrounds and so on.
---
**What we are looking for?**
---
Right now, our core raid spots are covered, and we're seeking to expand our numbers - as well as potentially build a second raid to strengthen our progression. In particular, we're looking for **Holy Priests and Resto Shamans**, though other applications may be considered depending on their quality. Recruit prios may change from week to week so stay tuned!
---
**Rules &amp; requirements:**
---
* A patient, positive attitude. Vanilla content is less about your macros and more about your commitment. Respect your guildmates, listen to your officers, and we’ll go far!
---
* Consumables. We’re not going to be hardcore about flasks and such, but everyone can fish some sagefis/rum or get themselves a few potions/elixirs.
---
* English – or at least some basic understanding of it.
---
* Looting rules: We're planning to use a **DKP** system with **blind bidding** in order to avoid bid wars. **Loot Council** will be employed for **legendary items**. We believe this represents the fairest compromise between the needs of the guild and the needs of its members.
---
**Raiding schedule:**
---
We’re currently planning to have at least three weekly raids. Of course, these numbers depend on content and player/alt availability (such as in phase 1 when there’s only MC/Ony and people don’t have geared alts yet), but eventually we plan to have every major raid cleared at least once per week.
---
As far as times go, we're currently planning to raid from 8:30 to 11:30 CET. Earlier starting times may be considered for weekends, depending on players' turn-up.
---
**Where you can contact us:**
---
For anyone interested in joining, feel free to write an application on our site:  [https://themuffinvendor.enjin.com/](https://themuffinvendor.enjin.com/)
---
Excellent work on the site. When I recently restored my own site (https://shadowpanther.net) in preparation for Classic, I looked all around and your site was the clear winner for linking the thousands of items on all of my charts.
---
After giving it some serious thought, here is my own wish list for potential updates and improvements to your site:
---
1. When sorting quests by Level, the sorting function does not work properly. Level 2 quests sort after quests level 10-19, level 3 quests sort after quests level 20-29, etc. On the other hand, Sort by Req. sorts properly.
---
2. When selecting from a large number of items like all One Handed Weapons, the total items caps at 500, so many items don't get included in the results. Can that cap be increased or removed altogether?
---
3. Is there a way to default to Show All Comments? Or could you add a single click toggle to show all comments (preferably in date order, oldest to newest) rather than clicking each hidden comment individually? When I’m researching an item or spell, I want to see what everyone had to say about it in chronological order, not just those who got upvoted.
---
4. Would it be possible to incorporate the minimum quest level into the Req. level for an item, so when you sort items by Req. level they sort properly? Currently, all quest reward weapons/armor have blank Req. levels so they don’t sort correctly.
---
5. Could you include damage values (low and high) for weapons in the item stats filters and/or in the sort fields? Rogues are more concerned with damage values than DPS for their main hand weapons, so it would be very useful to sort by those values.
---
6. Could you display orange minimum skill levels for profession recipes in the Skill field? This information is very useful for players wanting to see at a glance the minimum skill level they need to craft items.
---
7. Reputation values for all quests are inflated. If you're able to fix those reputation values, would it also be possible to list spillover rep values for quests that provide spillover rep? If you need help gathering those correct values, that’s a project I’ve been working on in the Beta.
---
Again, keep up the great work with your site.
---
/salute
---
For spriest it dpends on the type of pvp. In premade they aren't as useful because coordinated healers will cleanse and shut you down. In wpvp and 1v1 fights yeah they are awesome. 
---
Warlocks are great
---
what does "keep the system stable" mean
---
I’m that cross faction guy who will stop and help you do that chicken escort in Tanaris and tell my faction that you are cool, don’t shoot. Cuz that shit is just mean otherwise.
---
&gt; Also, DO NOT roll for offspec against mainspec party members for dungeon drops.
---
If I need it, I will roll need.
---
I actually agree hunter is one of the weaker classes in vanilla, but disagree with most of these reasons.
---
You should have your pet stored in instances, and every ranged class has to worry about kiting in PvP.
---
Yeah but that was from weeks ago. It seems they have fixed it already. Here is a clip from today from StaySafe's stream where they had to go outside to summon one of his party member.
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/PuzzledFamousSushiOSkomodo
---
Believe me, I'll mitigate the MOST damage, the most you've ever seen
---
And I would bet they push all realms to TBC and allow a small window for the minority that don't want it to transfer to a single Vanilla-only realm.
---
That was essentially a group of level 30+ twinks using grenades and potions nearly every pull. Also, in both instances you’re talking about Venruki who has won Blizzcon and is a very experienced player.
---
you get mining skill with smelting, so you will catch up pretty fast without any extra effort.
---
I gotta agree. At least give the mage a good 10-20 head start. Mages really don’t need any gear to excel. Rogues are squishy, dainty, and fragile. A good new weapon from the auction house every 5-6 levels makes the leveling process infinitely better.
---
Haha same, this is amazing
---
Well yeah, Arionic#6023 on Discord then.
---
I've been trying to find a lock to duo level with for weeks. If you plan on playing ally, hit me up.
---
I don't think that would work, as most people would not know what it means.
---
Cause it’s real hard right? Buried deep within the catacombs of the Internet.
---

3. requiring a great deal of endurance or effort.
---
Ok, thanks. Sounds rather lame. "Cutting Edge" is that an achievement?
---
I mean the eagle can't be called if you're in a house, but it can be told to go into one. Works in my head
---
I looked all over my harddrives, and this is all I could find from vanilla. Sadly all my screenshots are lost.
---
2-4 day raid weeks? Lol
---
We will raid maybe two days a week and clear all the content within weeks of release. Just like we have been for a decade.
---
Waaait, does divine spirit not stack with a scroll?
---
Yes, read this https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bs7ks2/melee_leeway_retail_mechanic_in_classic/
---
Take skinning anyway until you can get to a mining trainer. Maybe herbing also. Just the cash you get from vending it all will net you a tidy profit. 
---
It was years before I realized that there are no mining nodes on Teldrassil.
---
Sorry, but why are you posting stuff you have zero clue about? Stop spreading misinformation. Hunters are one of the BEST world PvP classes.
---
that's a lot of effort for something that is wrong
---
I just can't wait for classic in general! I'm struggling to choose a class to play!
---
Shadow priests run out of mana quickly so they are better off teaming up with DPS to finish fights quick.
---
So my thing is, mining mats can sell for engineering and blacksmithing while skinning is pretty much only for leatherworking, so it’s less of a direct disadvantage and more of a trade-off/choice.
---
Male troll. So everyone can laugh at you.
---
I thought this account was retired...
---
A delay of what, 15 minutes? At that point, there's no point to them streaming.
---
Neither does Fortitude nor Mage's Intellect. But keep in mind the spells always offer higher bonuses than the scrolls do.
---
Not detrimental. Wotf is very good because no fear. Not as good as axe spec for orcs, or 5% HP and warstomp. I also imagine troll has great tank racials, since extra HP/5 and berserking attack speed, even the 5% beast dmg can help threat on some bosses.
---
Ultimately they're all viable and have a great place. It's what you want to look at and which mechanics are more important to you.
---
This is key, in my opinion. 
---
Personally I intend to screenshot everyone ninjaing/leaving groups hanging while maintaining a personal textfile noting people who do that sorta thing, probably even setting up a website for my Discord server to track it. 
---
Then if they get invited to an activity I'm a part off I'll just leave and do something else, if enough people from the same guild ninjas/leaves then I'll just start personally black listing their whole guilds. 
---
I don't care to follow some large blacklist someone else has made (at least without proof of reason) but keeping a list myself and listen to what happen to friends will make sure I avoid this sort of people.
---
AFAIK the wow client does the queueing of your spells if you just hit the button slightly before the end, so you don't loose dps due to latency. 
---
and considering most of us mash our buttons that is the case for most xD...
---
plus it is about the highest lvl of dungeon you can solo in high raid gear.  (some classes can at least)
---
Lol good one mate.
---
Mostly due to layering I’d say. I don’t think a unified server with a normal pop (like in Vanilla) would be quite as bad as PSs. And I know there will be plenty of trolls and douches, but at least people won’t be able to be blatantly racist for example, without fear of a banhammer. Also, the fact your paying for the game could be an extra deterrent.
---
Those provinces should just build a Wall! I mean come on, they are figuratively surrounded on all sides! #makestormwindgreatagain
---
Well they gut this CS department several times in the last 8 years, starting with Ireland, then San Antonio
---
So, you guys bid on things?  Is it zero sum?  How do you handle loot that people need, but they horde dkp for weapons and whatnot?
---
Even at low levels, I’d much prefer intel gear. Also, it kind of sucks that you need to run the place 4-5 times to even get the decent chunky stats.
---
"b-b-b-but BACK THEN!!!"
---
still backpedaling to that invalid argument, lol
---
"back then" people raided naxx with arms warrior tanks who had 0 points in prot, what's your point?
---
&gt;“Far more useful,” is kinda an overstatement.
---
yeah everyone knows 15 spirit is better than a 10 minute fear immunity :\^)
---
hey, thanks for doing this. it's super cool
---
Cool, beans, I’ll add you when I get home. I have rugby tonight so I won’t be on. Do you play any other MMO’s?
---
Perfect, shamelesly copypsta it
---
Depends on if you're ok with making alts, and if you like pvp. Those 2 things will be how I spend the majority of my time in WoW and they can keep you busy for a long time if you're into it (especially pvp)
---
It really isn't. 15 spirit will give you approximately 2 more mana on every regen tick, outside the 5 second rule.
---
And +4 healing is literally not noticeable.
---
just like real life 😭 no thank you!
---
In a 2v2 arena style fight spriest/holy would almost always lose to lock/holy and would lose to war/holy once past MC gear level.  Spriest doesn't really benefit from pally nearly as much as you think and would be better off with a rogue, warlock, or mage as a partner.
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Onyxia
---
Cleared all of those in Vanilla, consistently without wbuffs. Only time my guild even bothered with any was AQ, and it was Ony buff.
---
We weren't server firsts by a long shot. But we also died way too much to realistically rely on wbuffs. 
---
C'thun downed post-Naxx release with a few more upgrades. And a little under half of Naxx done pre-TBC. Again, without wbuffs by and large.
---
My dad saw the South Park episode, and a year later decided to let 7 year old me play. I didn't accomplish much back then, 13 years later I am still playing (and am definitely better)
---
I got to r12. Would have gotten r13 if not for having to join my family 2 weeks to Crete.  
---
It cost me my grades, my health(quit sports, got really fat, took years to take off) and any social life out of school.  
---
In short, 15 year old me hates your guts.
---
Hi my dad saw the south park episode, and a year later decided to let 7 year old me play. i didn't accomplish much back then, 13 years later i am still playing (and am definitely better), I'm dad.

Speaking of people ganking, i'm extremely confused why people keep lumping server rep into it. No one cares if your ganking the other faction, or even camping them for hours into oblivion, that doesnt effect your own faction whatsoever, who on earth is going to "blacklist" someone because they killed some poor alliance over and over in redridge??
---
It had quite an impact back then. 
---
There was a truce between the raiding guilds of my server back then to allow such a thing. Basically everyone was burrying the hatchet  in front of the entrance. If you weren't part of truce you where fair game.Before that truce it was common to have the entire raid go out, murder anything thats red and corpsecamp them 'till the stragglers where summoned. 
---
Also raids require attunements that could even easier been sidestepped with warlocks. Heck, I would probably just move a warlock full of shards and two helpers to every raid and just have them summon everyone from inside. Zero risk to worldbuffs.
---
They don't matter much. Each has different pros is all, and it's all about which pro you like more. No fear is huge, and 10 shadow res is great. Cannibalize will make leveling faster for you.
---
Play the model you want to stare at for hours.
---
Unless they plan on making more then I'd just buy it on eBay. Only option available honestly.
---
It's beta...
---
You are trying to disguise your opinion/guess as a fact. Good try!
---
You actually have no idea if the minority want to stay in vanilla or go TBC. And, even if it is a minority that wants to stay back... there will be another set of players who want WotLK (and some who stay back). And then there will be some who want to keep going and some who want to stay back. And, of course, not all servers will see the same people staying/leaving, and not all factions will see balanced numbers, so that would be a disaster. See how this is not a good idea?
---
You can't launch Classic and then turn it into a Quasi Progression Server without telling folks it's a quasi progression server.
---
I don't intend to raid, I've had my share in other games and I'm getting too old for it.
---
My goal is to be an incurable altoholic like I usually am in every game. I want to *eventually* level all classes and all crafting professions. It will take me several years, maybe over a decade considering my free time is limited.
---
Been a wow and Diablo 2 fan for years. I'm 31 and work full time so I don't have tons of time to game anymore. I'll be taking like a week off for classic though.
---
&gt; I understood you meant it would stop the auto shot swing.
---
it does. If you have a 1.50 bow and you use Aimed Shot ( 3 second ) you're not shooting while Aimed is casting. This was changed later in the game, probably post WOTLK.
---
They do not have a classic collectors edition. There is the original vanilla collectors edition from 2004, but that is a different than the game coming out in August.
---
Error 404: wife not found. :(
---
Good idea, never made an alt but that seems sensible
---
Killing it again! Hopefully shaman next!
---
This is interesting to me. My preferred thing to play at this point is druid, but the whole reason I'm interested to play classic right now is raiding. I've seen the world content but I never had a chance to raid before. So there are a ton of dungeons I never even went into.
---
I've been practice leveling a warrior on a pserver. It's a fun class. I'm enjoying it. I figure I'll roll a warrior when classic comes and try to make friends with some other people as leveling a warrior completely solo sucks. The whole idea to me is to play something in demand so that I'm assured I can see raid content. Warrior gives me the option of tank or dps and at least during leveling tanks are in demand. Sometimes I get whispers to join groups simply because I'm logged in as a warrior.
---
I dunno, I'll probably end up making 3 characters and leveling one primarily. I'm thinking mage with tailoring as a money making alt. Something with healing, probably a druid with skinning/herbalism. And then a warrior. 
---
I'm still wresting with: which one of those will I level to 60 first as my main so that I can see raid content? I probably don't have time to be the guild main tank. So does that mean I shouldn't bother with the warrior at all? Would I be better off investing in the druid? But then I see a lot of posts saying no one wants druids for raid content because their rez sucks.
---
You can reject the reality and replace it with your own, but this happened.
---
Hell, I remember there being a guild or two on my server that a lot of people would avoid doing things with because they were known to house trolls that were gkicked from other guilds.
---
After 2-3 years, the number of people that want TBC will outnumber the people that want Vanilla only.
---
The hardship goes to the minority.
---
Counter argument:
---
"Reasons to play a hunter -- Because you want to"
---
1 bear druid, 2 cat druids, 1 balance druid, 1 resto druid.  Literally nothing you can't do with that combo.
---
Shaman tier 2 or 3 would be so cool!
---
What’s the strat, all stealth classes?
---
I thought this too
---
well, you're wrong
---
I meant this one (updated my post): https://gear.blizzard.com/us/world-of-warcraft-15th-anniversary-collector-s-edition#specification-tab
---
FYI it isn’t the Classic CE. It is the 15th Anniversery CE.
---
Paladin + anything is a god combo.
---
Genuinely curious which part of this is lol?
---
It says edit profile in the photo.
---
Lies! All lies! How dare you besmirch her good name with such slander.
---
Go warrior or paladin
---
"I Got the best deals anywhere!"  
---
"Yeah, what ya want?"
---
I’m obviously 26, but I’ll be 27 soon. I’ll be taking a week, maybe 2 depending on if my boss allows it.
---
Now we know what's behind Shadow fang keep when you illegally exit the map.
---
Tanks will still get away with murder. No matter how shitty they are they'll still get people to group with them because the alternative is not doing anything.
---
I'll probably ding 60 farming crusader recipes if I choose mage and I can stay  close to the top levelers.
---
&gt; The game will break them of this habit. 
---
This is the absolute truth. Classic is DESIGNED to be a strong social game, around a small community. ANY player that comes to Classic without understanding this basic truth, will either comply, and become a part of the game...or he will not, and he will quit.
---
Either way :
---
&gt; Nothing really to worry about
---
Haha, I did I meant this with a grain of irony actually. I do enjoy challenging content. That's why I will enjoy PvP where Frostbolt is one of like 15 binds you need to use. 
---
There is something immensely satisfying about landing a Frostbolt crit in someone's face though. I don't know if it's the sound or what but I can't get enough of it.
---
The number of people who kept up with who to avoid was way smaller than the server population. People remember their circles avoiding people and don’t realize everyone else either didn’t care or wasn’t aware.
---
Yeah you're kinda braindead if you don't know all classes relevant abilities but I was referring to the individual players.  Could you give an example of a situation where a "class leader" is needed?  The whole concept makes no sense it's far too many chiefs for too few indians and different specs fill different roles while the same classes will fill very similar roles.  Instead of class leaders split it into 3 groups, healers, dps, speciality (which is the raid leader)
---
pretty sure your main interest here is blasting ass
---
So you're telling me that my gnome warrior will be useless? I just wanted to be different.  Lol
---
I've already responded to all your clips... on your main thread. Posting them here does nothing.
---
You can look at the difference in these and compare with any of your videos and you'll see they are not the same range. 
---
There is an entirely different code based on changes in expansions later on, that were not in vanilla.
---
You don't notice a lot of input delay using chrome remote desktop?  When I've used it from my work PC to home pc it was really terrible
---
And thats a perfect amount of time to get a 60 main, level an alt and deck him out in best possible gear
---
Looks like propaganda used to smear the great name of Prestor
---
Greifing people who want to raid isnt a very good reason to take away a feature
---
r/unexpectedlotr
---
and my Goblin Rocket Boots
---
Clear Naxx at least once, level a few alts. If they dont put any fresh content out Ill probably call it quits after 4 or 5 years.
---
There's a trainer in Auberdine I believe so you should be fine.
---
wtf is star citizen?
---
The page the OP links literally says:    
---
&gt; (*These mounts are not available in World of Warcraft Classic.)    
---
So they're quite correct. The 15 year collectors edition coming out in August is not the classic collectors edition released in 04.
---
Yeah for the constant HP regen. I want to try it as SM/ruin and see if SL is enough sustain.
---
False lies and propaganda!
---
Leeway was introduced sometime around Cata-Mop. The hunter deadzone was removed when Hunter's got focus as an energy resource instead of mana. This in conjunction with the way CC works actually improved kiteable for Casters as MOP/WOD+ were arenas people sitting STILL not moving spamming CC's. This then helped both melee and casters. 
---
In vanilla we still have the classic movement system and kiting mechanics in game. #No changes
---
It doesn’t matter what I think. You’re not asking for an example so that you can be convinced. You just want an example so you can further say how I’m wrong. I’m not here to have an argument. Resorting to name calling because someone did something wrong in a video game? Yikes.
---
Warrior , rogue,  mage and warlock are the cutest classes because Gnomes can be them
---
I wish I had given FFXI more of a chance but I gave it about 2 months before I dropped it. I couldn't get over the shitty feeling of joining a group full of pros who I couldn't communicate with while still trying to learn the game.
---
What does semi-casual even mean? Is it more casual than casual? Is it a point between hardcore and casual? Is there an official scale out there somewhere?  
---
Thinking logically - if the scale goes from not playing at all to playing casually to playing hardcore, semi-hardcore would be like the halfway point between playing casually and playing hardcore. In that sense, being semi-casual would be the halfway point between not playing at all and playing casually, yes?  
---
In that case, play whatever you want. Semi casuals will struggle to even reach 60.  
---
In the case you meant semi-hardcore, still play whatever you want. The beauty of classes being very different is that they all are a unique experience, and there is literally no way to tell whether you'd enjoy one over the other, previous history can be a strong indicator, but there are no guarantees.
---
just watched that episode a few days ago. Good stuff.
---
Love this so much!
---
And u reroll a while later because u dont get a groups/good guild. Welcome to real mmo
---
Pay to win space adventure where you're locked in 20 minute fight animations unless you pay real money for faster a faster ship.
---
It's been in development before you are born and it will still be in development after we die.
---
Classic WoW even brings back with it fan made WoW videos.  I love it!
---
I'm starting to see why you need a class leader to hold your hand.  I didn't call you names please follow the conversation better.
---
At least show the creators name if you’re going to take his content man
---
Bet this guy didn't even play vanilla much and is here shit talking
---
Yes,but ill be playing a level 29 char and rek those brackets
---
I love SFK, my favorite instance before Zul'Farrak and BRD. The werewolves howling on the outside really spooks me. 
---
Arugal mentions "the master" is that ever followed up on?
---
Thank you. Im not a native english speaker. Didn't know this meaning..
---
True, but I feel tauren, dwarves, and orcs have some cutie potential.
---
It was just a fun word. Can you even imagine the logistics of trying to poop in a sock?
---
Ah my mistake lol. I didn’t realize they were releasing an anniversary edition :p the statue looks really cool though and it’s a shame they aren’t including the mounts in-game for classic!
---
&gt;The flaw in DKP is you're awarded mostly for participation and not the actual value you contribute to the group. 
---
This is partly solved by inviting to the raid, but not always.  
---
dkp also has the problem of people hoarding dkp for weapons and whatnot.  They pass upgrades , because they don't want to risk losing the item they really want.
---
yeah? and except some bored lvl 39/40, there's very little PvP going on.
---
same as retail.
---
why do you think this will change on release day? especially with everybody in a hurry to lvl up?
---
Xaryu, Venturi, Ziqo....hello??  Do you know what twitch is?
---
But the Americans can't pronounce squirrel either.
---
Wtf is a squirl, America?
---
That's clipping.
---
It takes roughly 100 hours just to get to max level (and thats the record). So yeah I think you're good lol.
---
Vanilla is full of these strange pathings. Fixing them would be sad imo. I love using these tricks and finding new ones.
---
Shady nastys?
---
If you don't mind playing female character, gnome / human is the way to go.
---
Back in the day (quit during AQ opening in Classic), I don't remember my raiding guild prioritizing world buffs for MC/BWL/ZG. It was seen as a nice bonus, and we'd keep some Onyxia heads banked on certain characters but we rarely if ever went in with a full slate of buffs. Maybe a Flask of the Titans for the MT or something whenever we could but we made due.
---
We weren't the top raiding guild on the server, maybe top 3 (Alliance + horde). We were the second guild to clear BWL on the server. Progress can still be attained without tryharding and min-maxing everything, and I for one am looking forward to joining a guild with people of similar mindset.
---
in a free market, demand makes the prize . Give your brother something else nice and set aside some money so next time something like this happens you can immediately buy it on launch day
---
Like I said in the title, this just my experience. I mean if you dont want to get ganked or have to worry about it, dont play a PvP server. thats why i joined one, for the moments where you get guild v guild in open world, 5v5 or 40v40 at a dungeon/raid entrance. I personally dont get running a PvP server if you dont want to PvP or find open PvP annoying. but thats just me, other peoples experiences and preferences are valid and if you enjoy it, then more power to you
---
Imagine being an MMO nerd who insults other MMO nerds on the internet for being a smaller MMO nerd than himself. Congrats bro, you win the bigger no-lifer award.
---
I'm curious why wouldn't you play at launch?
---
You'll of course be at a disadvantage, but that's just true about any game... joining late to Classic won't be unplayable though :)
---
This is something I keep seeing brought up but I have no idea what im looking at.
---
Hi curious why wouldn't you play at launch?
---
you'll of course be at a disadvantage, but that's just true about any game... joining late to classic won't be unplayable though :), I'm dad.
---
I did too many graveyard runs last week.
---
It used to be 2x easier but it appears he has recalculated and it is now 10x
---
I'd hope they release TBC standalone, not connected to Classic servers
---
The eagle flies high in the sky and can't see through the roof. That's in my head. Good thing, fantasy is different for everyone :-)
---
8 set lawbringer, let the speed running begin.
---
Honestly, just want to kill some stuff, get bored and quit, get the urge to play again after some time, and actually be able to play again right where I left off. No new expansions, no new tiers. Just the same game.
---
One of the comments "TRUE genious this is rly rly amazin :) kind regards m8 :)....rly usefull find in wow....since..forever.." lol
---
I love it!
---
I'm hoping for original Classic content and not rereleasing the expansions over again.
---
I did not play shaman but I know warriors will #$@&amp;% your %$?! for a windfury totem.
---
Yeah, I always thought the idea of a UD priest a bit silly, despite playing several of them. (They do make some badass looking shadow priests though, especially after they gave us that broomstick mount for Halloween)
---
Worth picking up. While there might be more competition for nodes, also expect the price of ore on the AH to be considerably higher due to the number of people attempting to level crafting professions. The price increase should offset any loss of actual mining conducted.
---
That's simply not true.
---
Ignorance truly is bliss I suppose.
---
Good luck in Classic!
---
&gt; **Is it a game fit for dumping a lot of hours into it?** 
---
Hahahahahahahahhaha....
---
Yes.
---
A decade is a fair amount of time. So many other games have that longevity.
---
You’re a good man.
---
These are awesome, keep up the good work!
---
Still hoping for lock t2!
---
He said in a raid night not just downed in general.
---
Why not be a pvp warrior? Go Orc or Tauren
---
Yeah if you don't have time to main tank, r14 isn't even a question :)
---
Go troll priest or undead :)
---
Here’s my recommendation. As soon as you have 92 copper, go buy a Skinning Knife, train Skinning at the Leatherworking/Skinning house by the bridge east of Darnassus, then skin your way throughout Teldrassil (including all critters, like rabbits and deer) until you have a stack or more of Light Leather and several stacks of Ruined Leather Scraps.
---
Buy 8 Coarse Thread then return to the Leatherworking/Skinning House. Drop Skinning, switch to Leatherworking temporarily, convert all Ruined Leather Scraps into Light Leather, then craft yourself a complete Handstitched Leather set and 10+ Light Armor Kits. Then drop Leatherworking, take up Skinning again, and skin all the way to Auberdine until you switch to Mining, selling all skins and scraps.
---
Everything but the m+ part and that’s only around mid to high keys+ and because it’s beat the timer style.
---
You cannot be more wrong man. Yes, the majority never acknowledged those blacklists...but the majority were casual players, that didn't actually spend too much time in game...and they rarely raid.
---
Good luck being on the blacklist of good tanks and healers, because you will. You will run with subpar tanks and healers. You will not join any relevant guild. Your game will be screwed. You will be stuck in MC PuGs for the entire life of Classic.
---
All it takes is to annoy a lvl 40 tank or healer in SM...and that tank or healer becoming a core raid member in a guild...do that 10 times, with 10 different tanks and healers, and you ARE DONE. They have connections will other tanks and healers in other guilds...and your name will be on their blacklist as well.
---
You don't have to be on EVERYONE'S blacklist...only on a FEW, RELEVANT PLAYERS blakclist. Like tanks, healers, officers...
---
Will you still be able to play the game? Yes.
---
But you will be limited to IRRELEVANT content.
---
You have NO IDEA how much connections are between guilds in Classic....the relevant guilds. All it takes if to get one a couple blacklists of relevant players.
---
And it's over.
---
Well day 5 or 6 but true.
---
As an old vanilla hunter that cleared 70% of nax. I advise you to get into a guild. A guild will be better for social life and your active dedication to the guild will get you a more consistent place regardless of your damage l.
---
Pug raids are very hard to get into as a hunter. I had full tier 2 and had issues getting into a MC clear as they were unsure if my dps would be good enough 🙄 (Yea I am aware that such a person I was talking to was a dumb ass but it was not an uncommon thing).
---
Hunters do okay dps but realistically you are a utility class not a dps one past lvl 40. 
---
And marksman spec is what you will be forced into if you want to raid whether you like it or not. I only got to play BM spec on low tier raids and they were for more fun runs.
---
I pulled mobs, trapped mobs, kited mobs, tranq shot stuff and dps was the side role almost. 
---
Also realise that for every 1 good hunter, there was 20 huntards that make your life so much harder because it was such a common class that’s so easy to get the basics but difficult to master. Not Clipping your auto shot damage requires very aware timing and finesse and being aware when it was better to clip it for better damage was a thing too depending on your weapons attack speed.
---
FWIW I think hitting rank 14 probably requires no-lifing this game more than any other thing you can do in it.
---
Thanks, pal! Good luck to you too!!!! :D
---
Whilst some classes do have an advantage over others, skill actually has quite a big impact when it comes to PvP
---
A good mage can kill a bad warrior
---
A good warrior can kill a bad mage
---
I’d say just play what class you like the look and feel of and work your ass off to become good at that class
---
An official leaderboard for time to clear raids would extend the life of the game
---
And the girl says "STOP BEING A BABY!" or some shit while the little boy ends up looking like a little bitch.

Some SJW at blizzard saw this and said "NO. THIS NEEDS TO CHANGE. WEMEN CANNOT BE TREATED LIKE THIS IN GAEM".

---
#If you came to this post to get accurate information about playing a hunter in Classic - - - Turn around!
---
Half of this information is accurate, at best.
---
For one, Hunter's are wPvP kings alongside Rogues.
---
For two, Hunters are great in honestly all forms of PvP. While it may be true that they're going to be ideal in mass PvP and solo(duels)/world pvp, they are honestly great in small (wsg/AB) pvp match ups as well. You can destroy enemy squishies, drain their mana, control mid with your frost trap and concussive shot, and all around be an extremely annoying thorn in the enemy's side. If focused by multiple targets, YES, you will die. But that's true for most classes, and *frankly Hunter's are equipped well enough to prevent this from occurring in the first place*
---
Pet happiness...I mean come on. Its super simple and you get bonuses for it. Not really that big an issue.
---
Deadzone - This is what separates the mean from the boys. The ladies from the girls. Proper awareness of your deadzone is what makes a great hunter. It's the only class with this potentially severe drawback, but it's rewarding as hell to be good at managing.
---
Dungeons - As a hunter main, I was always in high demand for dungeons. HUNTARDS were very real back then, primarily for pet pulling. However, that's why your reputation was so key. Set yourself apart from the idiots, and you'll never lack for groups. Why? Because for one, you're zero competition to the rest of the group as far as drops are concerned. Your pet can salvage a wipe in some instances, and you're ability to CC and snare is key as fuck.
---
What this list is missing is the drawbacks to classic RAIDING as a Hunter. You have a rewarding rotation if managed right, but you scale poorly with gear and will go from middle-high in the dps rat race, to dead bottom for "pure" dps specs (not counting ret, feral and shaman dps). This is assuming of course there is no skill disparity where you are a keyboard god and your fury warriors, mages, rogues and warlocks are clickers and keyboard turners.
---
It will be non-mandatory and not even suggested for people in my guild to obtain world buffs/flasks/consumes etc before raids. I want there to be a genuine challenge and feeling of accomplishment when it comes to raiding.
---
Will we utilise world buffs? Maybe later down the line for certain bosses that we're really stuck on. Or perhaps just the main tank + a few early/chosen/key players will group to obtain wbuffs and summoned to a raid.
---
The real struggle I remember in Vanilla was getting 40 people in the instance for the designated start time, sometimes you get caught up in a BRM war on the way, sometimes select people DC or get picked off and need assistance.
---
People also don't always have their hearth set in the same place as others. 
---
It's a game, have fun!
---
Ps. I understand that certain people are completionists and feel enjoyment from blasting through content as quick as possible (or going for world/server first etc) and that's fine too!
---
Uhhh...
---
we're just really impressed at the amount of try-hardiness for easy content that's at best comparable to normal-mode raids.
---
Maybe  for your first AQ / naxx clear? but stacking world buff for MC and BWL?... guess some people have nothing to do with their day.
---
Back in the vanilla days, I was around level 15 when I saw a 60 mage in full Arcanist (tier 1) with an Azuresong Mageblade. Getting that set and sword became my top priortity back then and it took a few months but I got it and I was so proud. That's all I want to do again
---
The Prodigy. Always.
---
I'm trying to google search but were portals and teleport in 1.12?
---
Grew from keep to castle and the name just stayed for traditions sake? My guess
---
Because "keep" sounds better.

---
Check the videos, it's hard to capture in pictures. Basically, if the player and the mob is both moving, they have extended melee ranges compared to when they are standing still. This means that mobs or other players will hit you from further away if you are kiting them.
---
Also love how they “can beat any class in duels” (LOL) but somehow have issues in open world pvp. 
---
Because going from limited kiting range in duels to unlimited in outdoors pvp is somehow bad? OP is completely clueless.
---
How can I have no idea when I played it? And you’re giving all of this power to tanks and healers without considering the tanks and healers could be the assholes in question. The blacklist is just a way for people who got screwed over to pretend they got some sort of revenge.
---
Had a lightly twinked 29 hunter that was an absolute blast to play. 29 bracket was way more fun than 19 imo
---
Druid, Tauren or NE - it doesn’t matter. 
---
You can shapeshift into a panther/horned lion, bear, cheetah, evil walrus, and elkbearowl if you wanna go that route. 
---
Shits hella kawaii.
---
World buffs literally reduce time spent raiding and to trivialize raid difficulty.
---
You won’t even go rank 10 without time to maintank
---
Till 15 more years pass and you get the urge to do it all over again. The best part about classic is it should always be classic.
---
thats not how this meme works unless you're actually saying you're going to kill yourself
---
Also weird that so far most of the things weve learned about the differences point to pservers as overtuned to make up for the lack of things like a correct speed increse to bosses after they parry.
---
The first 35 sec of this is just amazing
---
the only 2 options are severely disadvantaged or severely overpowered? you're grossly misinformed.
---
Getting ass blasted
---
What if people want to play all 3 expansions? The vanilla players will clear naxx and move on to tbc and all the raids will be cleared by then, very bad idea and will not happen
---
What raid is mechanically more difficult in classic outside of naxx than any lfr. Vanillas figured out 12x over. M0 dungeons are harder than any classic dungeon at the start. When you outgear either they are both mindless. Heroic and even normal are harder than naxx ever was
---
On the PvE servers we called it raid AIDS and coming flagged to an instance would get you yelled at.
---
Didn't stop me from PoM Pyroing flagged horde outside of AQ
---
:) what a positive reply.
---
Because I wanna pve as warrior and don’t really see myself getting into groups and dps, and I hate raiding and pve as dps.
---
yes, a fucking flying wyvern would be a great classic mount &lt;.&lt;
---
Who? Me? You think people will raid 4 days a week?
---
It's not a bug, it's how pathing works in WoW.
---
Yeah, I was planning on using it to level engineering as I was leveling but the demand thing would stay true, thanks
---
Seems like an assumption that your mom would be sad.
---
I have time to r14, I more or less don’t have the desire to do all the things that require me to MT
---
That would be fucking great and it would make guilds go even harder.
---
The Blackrock invasion of Northshire broke my little human heart in Cata. I'm happy to be going back to Kobolds wolves and Defias.
---
Are you sure about playing Priest though? The other classes are a ton of fun as well, you should check them out :)
---
What I think they are trying to say is you think you want to play BC and Wrath, but you don't.
---
&gt;Raid Times (Eastern)  
---
&gt;: Group Formation 7:30pm, Raiding by 8pm, Final pull no later than 11:15pm.
---
yikes! =)
---
Extremely ambitious space sim MMO kinda like Elite: Dangerous, but much much grander. I think it's the biggest crowd funded anything ever at over $200 million. That's also its weakness imo, you can buy ships for real money which makes it pretty p2w unfortunately.
---
Cringe level 100
---
It does but it’s really not that bad, I got really close working a full time job back in vanilla
---
prob because a keep was just a small castle in wc3
---
IF IT’S RED IT’S DEAD.
---
? What lol

Nah you can rank 14 with a ret. They are amazing in pvp. The issue isn't that they are bad but, simply that the strats and teams they use are unorthodox. The issue isn't that they are bad in pvp. It's that they aren't "meta" for streams. So no one will play with them.
---
I have time, I guess I don’t have the desire to spend that time doing the things to MT
---
If you like both Shadow Priests and Warlocks, you should just play a lock, your life will be much easier. Better farming, easier raid spots, better scaling with gear, more utility, free mounts.
---
If you are torn between healing Priest and Warlock, I can’t offer any helpful advice as I have the same issue.
---
🤷🏽‍♂️
---
It is a suitable game and in a way not quite. It takes a while to level up a character from 0 to 60, if you wanted to do several classes then that will be a first good time sink. If you are interested in the vanilla pvp, though I am not sure of the exact details, getting to max rank is also a very long endeavor though it requires some collaboration with other players.   
---
Finally there is the raid content which is quite time consuming. The two issues are that there is a limit to how much you can raid per week and with whom and the fact that you have to be in a 40 man groups.   
---
Playing on your own in the world opens the chance of getting rare world drop items but there is not as much of randomness factor to the quality of the loot you can find compared to a  traditional action RPG such as diablo3 or path of exile. So, in a way, less of a linear curve between time invested/rewards.
---
From everything I have seen very few people want TBC. It was a shit show of an expansion that introduced so many things that killed the classic mind set and moved wow to what it is now. If anything people want new classic content.
---
It was a thing in Vanilla. I personally made 3 people change servers, because they were on my blacklist, I was MT and Guild master and those guys weren't able to join any good guild.
---
They were total dicks, and they deserved it.
---
Interesting - first time I've read that thought process - I thought r14 required more time consistently in a shorter timeframe than a main tank in a longer timeframe.
---
I used to farm Hydrospawn on my mage in vanilla. Granted, I had good gear (around BWL times). 
---
But I popped AP and just nuked him down. 
---
Sometimes I would die tho :(
---
There are certainly people who've played vanilla WoW 10+ hours/day for years. There are some titles and achievements that are only doable with that sort of time commitment (PvP Grand Marshall).
---
If you enjoy raiding, I'd recommend playing a warrior main tank. That is one of the more demanding roles that requires a lot of playtime. 
---
Most of the endgame content is raiding or PvP. If neither of those interest you, you'd probably run out of content after a couple of months. Raid content should keep you busy for at least a year or two (partially depending on how quickly Blizz releases the phased raid instances).

Suddenly nochanges doesn't apply here and private servers got it right lmao.
---
At least all numbers are significant again, unlike retail WoW unless you're doing mythic raid.
---
Don't joke about suicide
---
Yup it's pretty much a shaman weapon. Considering Bonereavers edge is better and, doesn't cost you an arm and a leg.
---
I've never tried mythic raiding but I believe you guys. You have my upvote.
---
I like how he has to state that he doesn't want to change the tiniest thing. Just in case the #nochange zombies come for him hahah
---
Thats not completely true...i always enjoyed level 19/29/39 brackets pvp not because the chance you face someone 9 levels lower than you but because it's entirely different game from max level pvp.
---
No mounts,no high level spells,no full talent trees no high level set bonuses,no people with "exclusive gear" (high end pve gear,high end pvp gear resilience in later expansions..)
---
It's pure pvp at its finest.Some of my fondest memories are from twink v twink premades in low level beackets.
---
didn't that shit have utterly crap proc rate?
---
male NE priest.  you can MC onee-chan to make her notice you and you have a nice bulge
---
I would be careful about team viewer, I think they were involved with some sort of data gathering scanda at some point. Can’t remember the details but I would maybe do some research on Google regarding the situation.
---
All I read is that you shouldn't roll on a pvp server.
---
Does Shadowfang Castle sounds a lot worse to you?
---
could also be like "Castle Black" in GoT to coversely be "Castle Shadowfang"
---
I think the best part of Classic is that it is an actual RPG. Content wise I'm all for the Classic+ content. I would prefer they stay away from BC/WOTLK.
---
In 15 years I may come back to it but I doubt it. Not if I finished everything. Main reason Im coming back now is because I never raided or PvPd in Vanilla and I want an actual RPG element to the game and not w/e retail has going on.
---
this was another heavy consideration of mine but i’m worried about the whole furry aspect of it. maybe though
---
Play priest so you can follow me around and, spam dispel magic.
---
Yep...
---
That is not hard at all. For a competent guild it should definitely be possible to clear the new raid in the first or second week. Naxxramas might take longer because some fights have high gear requirements.
---
Good luck with this mentality farming MC in PuGs forever. IF you would even get in an MC PuG.
---
TIL
---
Is this still accurate in 1.12?
---
&gt; The challenge of picking your fights and avoiding clearly superior enemies.
---
This is the disconnect. I can't ever understand the "thrill" of beating someone who clearly should. If there's no challenge, no reward, than what is actually the point?
---
The point is that you've annoyed or ruined someone's night miles away. There is a kind of morbidness to it, and at the end of the day WoW is just a game, so it's not the end of the world. However, if someone was blasting music late at night or talking loudly during a movie. That person might be "enjoying themselves" but it's at the cost of others, and that does in fact make them kinda shitty.
---
Shhhh.. not allowed here
---
True, I've had plenty of close battles in wPvP
---
So that’s why we had our Warchief as a final raid boss.
---
i dunno man, when the stakes are higher people make more effort to attack (if they are motivated by trolling) and more effort to defend to keep buffs
---
eg our guild used to group up and travel together.  if we weren't trying to conserve buffs we could have just run in whenever, then corpse-run into the instance
---
Not sure if this has been brought up in the blue stickie or here, but I think wanding is broken. I’be has issue testing in beta where when I’m wanding (autocasting), if I move which should automatically break my wanding autocast (prevent the next want “shoot” action), it doesn’t stop unless I’m moving right at its about to complete the cool down (since it’s a global cooldown). I have to either be moving which will cancel the auto-casting wand or I have to de-select it from happening. I don’t believe wanding should be on the global casting cooldown like other spells. It’s a ranged attack.
---
I don't know how most feel about this but I can't take world buff min/maxing all that serious. Content isn't hard so what's the point in getting it done a bit faster. The most unenjoyable experience that I can think of is playing/not-playing the game at certain times to min/max. Taking it to this levels reminds me of logging on everyday to just do daily's because you'll get left behind otherwise, then afterwards having no else to do. Fuck that shit and I will quit again when that's what the game feels like. The fact that raids are on weekly lockouts annoys me already and at some point the game becomes just login on tuesday, and again, if that's all I can do, I'll move on to another game again.
---
The best part of classic and what sets it apart from current retail is that there is so much content that you'll always have something to do for a long time. Some of those things might be easy to achieve goals done in days while others can be really grindy like rep rewards done for weeks. But as soon as my goals become restricted by some daily/weekly lockout and I have nothing else to do when I wanna log on and play, then that it and I'll just throw in the towel. Playing beta has reminded me so much about why I enjoyed classic, and yearn for more games like it today. 
---
In the end, I couldn't care less about world buffs to this extent, it just seems like a very unenjoyable way to play the game, and why play if it isn't fun.
---
hahahahaha that is fucking brilliant.  what a horrifying image
---
There’s guilds who literally focus on raid wiping other guilds outside of raids. Scuba Cops have great content on YouTube. 
---
https://youtu.be/idZNoAa3-xk
---
This is the best thing about world buffs
---
Even bear form and pre bear form are fine imo, much better then warrior or rogue 1-19..
---
I don’t wanna farm potions and run pve endlessly, or spend tons of gold respeccing all the time. It’s more about having more time to pvp and being able to easily get groups to pve when I get the itch.
---
Woah! very smart i will take this into careful consideration
---
I think Blizzard should wait. Allowing people to shift back and, forth. Will only make content last less time. Don't overwhelm people with choice.
---
Ya my vote is also for male NE priest!
---
Just cause a raid has mechanics doesn’t mean it’s harder. Normal/lfr have no challenge outside dealing with total morons who are apparently beating their head into their keyboards and calling it raiding. Most new raids even are figured out too that’s pretty much gone. M0 dungeons are so easy are you kidding me? You can just ignore mechanics and spam it’s so easy. Like have you done an M0? You can’t be taken seriously with comments like that.
---
Why. Just why. You can use any controller. Just use their free trial then see if it’s worth the money.
---
Well since you ask Louis, i find this ~~meatloaf~~ thread rather shallow and podantic.
---
&gt;  A full tier 2 tank would still get into Naxxramas even if he had a reputation for being a dick 
---
That is if ONLY become a dick after being full T2 tank.
---
Because if he was a dick since lvl 1...he would NEVER be in a good guild in the first place, hence, no T2 gear. Not even T1.
---
Found the No-Lifer...
---
With so many guides saying you absolutely need engineering, it will be one of the best profession to make gold.
---
Yeah, this mentality is different from Vanilla. For reference, my guild had 4H on farm back in the day, and was the top progression guild on the server.
---
If a guild was popping full consumes and world buffs on every fight, the server community made fun of them for having more money than skill. Before Naxx, NONE of the raids in the game require consumables. They’re as insane as OP says, too, giving huge boosts to damage, survivability, healing, etc. It trivializes already easy fights, so why even bother doing that if you want to enjoy the game?
---
It’s literally a matter of spending gold to unlock easymode. Fuck off with that LFR carebear bullshit.
---
My guild did 2-3 days, but it wasnt uncommon for guilds for do 4 days a week. Especially if it wasn't for that long. My guild would do atleast 7 hours a run, longer if we were doing well.
---
Yeah, I switched off of my ol' pvp server during Mists, since it just wasn't the same any more.  The players I remember ganking me back in Vanilla I respected a lot more than the flying ferals who can watch entire zones and corpse camp you for hours, dropping out of the sky to 1-shot you any time they felt like it.
---
And back in vanilla there were times where like the alliance and horde would organize large-scale pvp events in the Wetlands and stuff.  And the power differential between levels wasn't quite as extreme as it is now.
---
Most likely. It could have started with Arugals tower and the rest was basically build around it while the town grew to provide services. Or just for coolness sake.
---
If you're planning to quest in Darkshore, imo mining is a great choice. Herbalism is popular, but mining nodes won't be as hotly contested in NElf land.
---
Vaperware*
---
That game is never coming out. And, if it does, it will be a watered down version of the product that was promised. 
---
Think *No Man's Sky* times 10.
---
Yeah, I'm cynical. But I'm also probably (unfortunately) right.
---
Why does everyone that prefers one or the other think they need to justify it. No one cares, you can have opinions they you dont have to plaster on a public forum. Its not a personality trait, it doesnt define who you are.
---
Gotcha! That makes sense, and I actually am right there with you - I plan on pvping much more than the first couple tiers of pve.
---
I must admit this is pretty good explanation.
---
You live in Britain?
---
If consuming pop-culture and video games is the only reason for your existence, maybe you should pull that trigger.
---
also starshards is totally some magical girl shit
---
I hope they dont release TBC. It is by far my favorite expansion but I would prefer them roll out Classic+ content. Like Kara crypts. Or change TBC to resemble Vanilla more (no flying, no dailies, etc)
---
Why drop Skinning if it's my only profession?
---
There's nothing stopping you from playing in 30 minute chunks in classic.
---
Okay... just wanted to have a different kind of disscusion &gt;.&lt; each to their own I guess...
---
&gt;Nah, you're just clearly not interested in delving further into the conversation because I got you beat.
---
In terms of interest and perseverance, you absolutely have got me beat.
---
In terms of actual logic, and ability to understand it, I definitely 'have you beat'.
---
If there isn't a continuation of Classic, I will stop 2-3 months after Naxx is open. I won't play alts, and I won't replay the same content with an alt and PAY again.
---
No way.
---
You gotta play a class that gains a lot from pvp gear because post MC the good pvp groups want good geared people and most of that is in raids or the like. 
---
Rogue wont do because you need mc level gear, neither will hunter. Spriest could perhaps
---
Bug fixes are changes
---
It probably is a personality trait and does define who you are. Or the other way around. Who you are defines which you prefer.
---
That being said, nobody even plays BFA anymore do they? I thought it was just forgotten accounts and bots.
---
If i am levelling and healing as Resto Sham you bet your ass i am picking up DPS pieces. My mainspec when levelling is enh
---
really? i think the opposite of this will happen. I think the market will become so inflated with low level crafting mats (because everyone is gonna start trying to save for their first mount) that all those mats will devalue like crazy.
---
So, is it working in Classic ? Not obviously in DM since it's not available, but somewhere else ?
---
TBC re-release chances are close to zero.
---
Maybe because the name only references the massive keep in the middle of it. Names don't have to reference all aspects of the entity they are describing.
---
I swear to god everyone just seems to have mentally deleted Venruki's first fight against a Hunter which he only won because of the Hunter getting fucked over by a flagged Rogue who ate his Scatter Shot.
---
The complete same can be said about classic dungeons and raiding. You need 25 people with a pulse, the other 15 need to make sure their drinking bird presses 1 every now and again. Raids are better in vanilla because loot is slower to come your way unless youre tanking
---
You’re a great guy, aren’t you?
---
 King Louis XIV of France?
---
Agreed, in private servers the guys going for r14 would always turtle if it didnt go there way. Av's lasted from 1-4 hours usually. Thats more than enough.
---

Wouldn't this post be about streamers and streaming? Omg no we're part of the problem now!

Exactly...people who claim that WPvP was this constant battle seem to forget the delicate /bow dance. Where you spot a member of the opposing faction and /bow at them in hopes that they will receive the sign of respect and spare you.

---
Well boys, we found the exploit. Let's break the game so this can't be used anymore!
---
Yes I guess you're right lol
---
Is this in the springs?
---
Vanilla had vestiges of 'sticky melee' for a lot of its life.  It got tweaked and nerfed a few times and I think by 1.12 it was pretty feeble.  I had several melee classes and the server definitely got more picky and discerning (and quicker) about dropping you out of melee range, especially in pvp.  It was especially bad for cat form druid where you had to continually crawl up some dude's ass to have a hope of hitting him. And if you were one of those chronic jumpers, you had to break the habit because you jumping one way coupled with even a slowed opponent moving the opposite direction would cut off auto attacks and grey out your specials.  Also, in pve, some mobs just had messed up hit boxes. Rag had a messed up hit box for most of vanilla.
---
Well first of all I will try and get to 60. I was never a huge fan of the leveling and now that I've done it a few times on private servers I'm pretty bored by it. 
---
Then I want to hit rank 10 for the full blue set and when I'm there I'll decided if I want to go for something higher. My guess now is that I will, but I'm not sure if that remains. 
---
I want to get a reckadin alt to 60, get some gear on him and basically do nothing but one-shot fully world buffed mages on their way to raid. 
---
Then of course I will raid everything. I'm already the recipient of Atiesh so it will be a joy to assemble it. I've cleared Naxx before on private servers but I guess Classic might be different. Then I want to continue farming Naxx until at some point the server converts to TBC.
---
We generally do. If you feel a post violates our rules, please report it so a moderator can review it.

What about the opposite scenario?  The rogue you gave everything to leaves the guild for greener pastures.  Then no one has shit, and the guild starts over from scratch.

Pros: It's fun to play. This argument beats all others. If you find it fun, play the class.
---
People don't factor utility in enough and I'm hoping that changes with Classic as we explore more options of class combos and uses. Warriors would downgrade from plate because it affect threat generation due to the migration. A couple of hunters keeping their misdirect on the tank might negate that, allowing higher damage reduction to be brought to the encounter and freeing up the healers a bit more. By the same logic, it might allow other classes to main tank for a raid. The teamwork allowed by classic goes well beyond just socialized leveling and too often the focus on 'muh meters' shallows the teamwork aspect in exchange for bragging about big numbers and over-optimization. We're going to see more exploration and challenge runs (much like the leveling challenges) than we did in Vanilla because we're generally already familiar with the content.
---
This thread is literally the only one on the front page of new thats about streamers.  Hmm...
---
Oh yeah, forgot about that. That was a close call and unfortunate that it was decided by that. Still proves my point that mages don't get free wins except maybe against rogues and warriors.
---
I enjoy world PvP, and if someone gets the jump on me, I don't rage at them or react as if they are cheating or anything.
---
At the same time, if I'm trying to knock out  an emissary or something quick, and I see a member of the opposing faction I usually won't engage them.
---
I like world PvP more than I don't...so I'll roll a PvP server, and have fun with it.
---
I played vanilla, you don't get any gear passing to whoever needs the most. Dungeon gear is not raid gear.
---
Dungeon gear is not raid gear.
---
No I'm saying this is how it actually worked in vanilla.  I'm not a big pserver guy, I did this exact farm route (as well as one in the West wing using the ramp leading down to the tree boss) to earn gold for my Dreadsteed back in the day.
---
Personally, I think it's better to do that after the initial launch surge. You can clear MC in greens and blues without Engi. Then either pay for ore/etc and then pick up Mining after you're 60.
---
that blizzard keep making server after server for people who were too much of a bitch to play on a high pop server. Casuals should not be catered to
---
Probably. My hype ended like 3 years ago and that was like 4 years into development. I still follow it and I have a fanfiction series I keep up with, but I'm not paying a dime more.
---
Damn, totally not playing a hunter now. F that you scared me.
---
Interesting, hadn’t heard of any of that. I’ll say we’ve been using it for 1-2 years with no issues, but I only run it on my home server so even if compromised they’d not have access to anything but media files.
---
Nah, Sherwood a few Friday’s ago at a friends party.
---
I report most streamer topics since the majority isn't about Classic content and block thread maker. It might be a coincidence but after 10+ blocks the sub feels better.

You were right. I do like this.

Yeah, and I'm talking about games with server side movement where ping = input lag.

---
That is a point I though might be made, and I do agree to somepoint, but when you look at naming conventions of real world castles this is not how they are refered. 
---
In french they are refered to "Chateau de," in spanish/italian "Castello di/del/della," and in english they are generally follow or begin with "Castle."

I meant improved CS, assuming this was a blanket silence. My buddy doesn't get hard-silenced, he's too good @ juking.
---
An spriest can absolutely live through a Warrior + Mage for longer than 9 seconds anyway. With Dots rolling and Vampiric Embrace, Stoneform, Shadowform reduction, and improved inner fire, I don't think they can kill the Spriest in time. Meanwhile they are both rotting from the DoTs without any way to heal through it.

**\*\*Guardians of Tirisfal | NA | PvE | Alliance | Social &amp; Raiding Focused\*\***
---
\*\*Guardians of Tirisfal\*\* was founded by older Vanilla/BC players that don’t have the time they used to in order to play 8+ hours a day. We are focused on bringing back the old WoW Vanilla experience of having a guild that you consider close friends. I remember the days where I used to login and have multiple people greet me, and vice-versa. We are trying to re-create a tight-knit community where we all look out for each other. We’ll help each other with leveling, dungeons, and eventually all come together to clear end-game content. 
---
We are a brand new guild created for Classic, so officer positions will be available as the guild grows. 
---
**\*\*How fast do you expect people to level to 60? What else do you expect?\*\***
---
At their own pace! We truly believe that each person has their own idea of fun. Whether that be taking it slow and doing every quest, stopping and doing PvP for days, or rushing to 60 to participate in end-game raiding. We're here for it all.
---
We expect all of our players to be kind and courteous. All classes are welcome and no raid experience is necessary. We plan on building our team from the ground up, giving players that might have missed raiding in Vanilla a chance to experience it. Microphones will be preferred for raiding, at the very least for raid leaders. 
---
**\*\*Raid Information\*\***
---
Once we have more numbers in the guild we will have a group discussion on the most appropriate raid times once we reach end-game content. Potential schedule:

---
Sorry, but Rank 14 is easy when you're account sharing.
---
Every popular streamer will have someone to account share with for when they are sleeping. It's why the plebs are at a disadvantage especially this go around with speed leveling and Rank 14, it wasn't AS common to account share in Vanilla as it was harder to find people to trust.
---
Thanks for the answer, ill report anything I see. Post deleted.

Nah man.  I still remember a Suramar server pariah Lengaloids.  He fucked over an entire guild and was perma blacklisted.  Had to reroll on another server.  That was 15 years ago and I can guarantee I'm not the only one who remembers peoples names.
---
Pepperidge Farm remembers.
---
Get the r10 blue pvp set at my own pace and just enjoy pvp after that. Hopefully find a group or some friends to pvp with along the way.
---
Already raided MC/BWL/AQ40 in ~2005-2006 and hated it so I don’t plan on raiding unless I decide at some point I need t1/t2 for pvp.
---
Jalapeno and Mustard.

I killed 2 bosses in Naxx on retail and I didn't even know about 3/4 of these. I don't remember anyone talking about these, let alone my guild saying they were mandatory.

Yeah it's kinda lame they never specified this would be a limited collector's edition. It sold out on the Blizzard store before i even got to know about it and i check this subreddit more than once every single day. But I managed to get my pre order on a local store here in Sweden once they became available just a couple of days later.
---
So my advice would be to check with local stores and see if you're lucky. But honestly, at this point it's probably too late :(
---
I think Warlock/Paladin could be better than Spriest/Paladin in later tiers. But won't it lack the killing power of Spriest, I wonder?
---
the addition of flight paths at camp taurajo, revantusk village, morgan's vigil, thorium point, marshal's refuge, and cenarion hold.
---
huh, i've never actually seen that, but, that's probably one of the most accurate cosplays i've seen her do. her dragon aspects were spot-on too.
---
Was this ever any issue who got the 12/13/14 gear?
---
Or was it early
---
If I am healing whilst levelling as enhancer you better believe i am rolling on dps gear. Good luck finding tanks or healers otherwise
---
Druid is one of the fastest levellers man, only slightly behind locks and hunters, they have one slighty hard class quest in bear form and one annoying one for seal form. Cat form dps is high and does not even need a finisher if you itemised for str/ap and not agi. Smoothest 1-60 imo, also you have gank immunity from 30 through travel form :)
---
If someone is healing or tanking a 5-man I have no issues with them rolling on the gear that will help them in their solo/questing spec. That's probably the main reason they are running the instance.
---
That does seem to be every class guides modo, "these professions are nice but if your thinking of raiding or pvp you need engineering"
---
&gt; A castle is a fortified structure surrounded by walls with towers. 
---
No it is not.
---
&gt;A **castle** is a type of [fortified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortification) structure built during the [Middle Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages) by predominantly the [nobility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobility) or royalty and by [military orders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_order_(monastic_society)).  
---
If you tore down every part of the castle except the keep, the keep would now be a castle in itself.

A castle is literally by simplest definition a fortified home.
---
That’s pretty much how it was in 2004/2005 era too. Some places in particular were really bad for leveling (stv is pretty infamous), but a lot of people as you got higher didn’t bother anymore. World “pvp” as in ganking just isn’t fun. What is fun is a bunch of people trying to push and take over a questing hub held by the other side. These are different things and a lot of people who didn’t play back then don’t understand the difference, I guess.
---
Also works for not getting invited to other groups
---
Leave the dungeon group in the instance, wait 1:30 minutes (perfect time for a quick bio break/grabbing some Doritos and Monsters), save a HS cooldown and gold.

The year was 2008, I was returned from the navy for 6 months, and my friend was due to get married to his college sweetheart.  I, being the renowned bachelor planner, was in charge of finding a gentleman's club of shady repute.  Hark, 2 cases of New Glarius Spotted cow deep, the wedding party drives, quite drunkenly to a club in the boonie town of Earl in northern Wisconsin. Our Destination, the Jack of Spades.

The dancer, a 105 lb half Chippewa half white girl, spins, and ascends that shiny poniard like some sort of bendy  valkyr. With fire in our eyes and "Paralyser" thrumming in our ears..

It depends when your guild is going for an MC clear. You are gonna lose so much time going off the path for nodes that will be competed for as well.
---
The #1 goal of launch if you're in a guild that is demanding Max Engi is getting to 60. Worry about Engi then and pay for ores. Especially if you're a class that can AoE farm like Mages to make gold while also picking up Mining at 60.
---
You could probably make the argument that Shadowfang "Castle" is the combination of both Shadowfang Keep and Pyrewood Village together. That way, even though Shadowfang Keep is pretty elaborate for a keep, it would still technically be the "keep" or at the very least the inner defenses of the "castle".
---
Now granted, the defenses, specifically the walls and palisades, are not directly connected, but it'd probably still be considered close enough for the distinctions to stick.
---
I am kinda on the fence about engineering or lw for a hunter. Trying to level leatherworking as I go. So this might persuade me more towards that.
---
The keep alone would be considered a castle at that point
---
Zach Fischer draws these cosplays with Nigri in mind. That’s probably why it looks so good, because he drew the cosplay well enough for Nigri to recreate!
---
Because shadowfang castle sounds stupid and the wizard lives in the keep, the goal is to storm the keep and kill Arugal.
---
Awesome video dude!
---
Hey man
---
Classic half is hilarious, feel like the BFA one should have had one of them phase out just as an attack was about to land.
---
I would say it started as the main tower then expanded and the name didnt change. The goal was the guy had a fortified place off the beaten path to experiment on the worgen.
---
Careful now, we all know how rare mages are right? Better pay up!
---
I was not asking a question. I was making a statement. Nothing but stam on the dagger, spirit and agility but no str on the plate helm, agility on the cloth helm.

That guild remembers probably. I’m sure with some effort he could’ve stayed on that server and got a new guild unaware of what had happened.

Back in my day *shakes cane* I had to MC horde on my priest and type to them via /emote. I did this one time gave a horde guy our vent info and he came and chatted with us for a while. A nice Australian guy.

For range, you have Mind Soothe - it's under utilized and can help with SPriest range problems. All I need is to get my DoT on the enemy and it's GG for him anyways. SW:P alone can almost 100-0 a player.
---
Psychic scream isn't my only peel with this comp, the Paladin can HoJ for me, BoF, BoP, etc. Plus I can kite Rogues with Stoneform and Mind Flay their faces off.
---
I understand everyone has different tastes... but SPriest boring?? You have so much Priest utility that I can't see this EVER getting boring!
---
This works, but I believe it restarts the HS's cooldown again. But I'd definitely do this rather than paying the fee.

Yeah, and then I went through your comment history and saw you thought classic wasn't a 60 cap. Stopped caring after that

I think the tank rolling on a 2H while leveling is fine because he's probably going to use it more than he'd use a shield anyways, but at 60 you should make it clear you're going to do that before you start the instance.

Thats what I assume for SFK I bet at one point the town and the castle were connected converting everything into a castle town, and the pervious castle into a keep. 
---
That does not excuse all of the other keeps I mentioned though, SFK was just one of the smaller ones and I used it as an example to show how small a castle can be, while trying to argue the overall point.

It's a strange one - The most obvious reason would be (as someone has already pointed out) was that it was originally just a keep, which was then later fortified and eventually became a castle (albeit a small and basic one), but kept it's name for tradition/ease.
---
The problem with this is that it wasn't originally called Shadowfang keep. Infact I can't find any reference to any name other than 'Silverlaine's Keep' named after it's Lord,  Baron Silverlaine. It only took the name Shadowfang Keep after Arugal and his worgan took over.
---
So maybe Arugal doesn't really know the difference between a castle and a keep?
---
I believe 100% it has consequences in that circle of players. But what about the people on that realm not in that guild and the people who don’t use the forums?

The last half of TBC felt like the casualization of wow to the point where no matter what path you took or how much you played you could become within 10-15% as good as any other character in the game. 
---
What was the point of keying and learning all those fights in SSC, Gruuls lair, Magtheridon, Tempest Keep, Mount Hyjal.  Coordinating with 24 others to overcome them, farming herbs and flasks for hours after every raid, if a similar level of power could be achieved in a fraction of the time with 1-2 other people?  Or they take away the steps needed to get into BT. You nailed it with t5.5 badge gear and zul aman, i had forgotten about how those allowed you to get high quality pve gear later in the expansion for a lot less effort and less people.
---
I was a dagger rogue my entire life from molten core through tempest keep, there wasn't enough swords to go around and i wasn't the chosen rogue for glaives. Officer in guild says i need to get season 3 swords because they are somehow better than any of the raid drops ill get because i won't be given swords anyways. As an above average but not amazing pvp player i got to above 2100 (can't remember the exact numbers) i think several times, just shy of enough for the weapons. Yeah part of that is bitterness but part of it is also the reality that pvp gear was percieved as so strong i was forced to attempt to get it to satisfy the higher ups in my guild. It is entirely possible that the season 3 swords were better dps than my raid acquired daggers minus the illidan dagger which i didn't have at the time. 
---
I feel like more effort that goes into raiding and coordinating with other people should be rewarded more. Why play 500% more than others to become 10% stronger than them. The effort to reward structure became out of balance. TBC is the expansion where the path to power went from 40 people to 25 people to 5 or less all in one expansion. To me thats what killed wow the most.
---
My thoughts are the same as they've been since vanilla, even after witnessing the overanalyzing of fight mechanics and metagaming that takes place on private servers. **It's just simply not a problem to the majority of the players.**
---
World buffs are not going to be a big issue in classic. As always, the guilds pushing to be on top will probably coordinate and require them, but pick your poison... Top end raiding has historically always required heaps of time spent outside of raid to min/max your character. In vanilla, it was consumables and world buffs, and requiring engineering. If you don't want to game at that level, you don't have to. A lot of people won't game at that level despite the rhetoric that a lot of people have around here.
---
So many people on here and the official forums talk as if metagaming is a standard. It's just not. I consistently point it out on every thread like this, but I'm going to do it again.
---
To this day, right now even on private servers, over a decade after the actual game was out and with all of the knowledge that we have of class mechanics and the PvE encounters, **there are still guilds that wipe in molten core.** Bad players have existed since games were first being played and they always will exist. It doesn't matter how much knowledge is out there regarding the game.

Essentially turns your  healing wave into chain heal.

I enjoyed Pally healing so much all the way up until the end of Wrath when they did the CATA pre-patch. They ruined Holy Pally for me and I haven't been able to enjoy it since.

The 8-set priest T2 makes Greater Heal a super strong spell, especially when combined with the priest ZG trinket. 
---
The 8-set warlock T2 gives you threat reduction, very nice for warlocks since they don't really have any other threat reducing abilities or talents. Unfortunately the full set is so bad you'll hardly do any damage anyways so you don't need the threat reduction. Thanks Blizz.. 
---
The 6-set paladin/shaman T3 causes your heals to give a buff to the player healed; 700 armour to warriors, 80(!) SP to mage/lock, mp5 to priest/druid/paladin/shaman and attack power to rogue/hunter. Very strong buff.
---
I love reading about this "world buffs" required nonsense and the tears that ensue when said buffs are lost.

You seem pretty chill here, what did you do back in wow that makes you think people are talking about people like you in this thread?
---
Ive found flat DKP the best way to go. Its only suceptible to collusion, which in my experience, only happens on crap items that no one really wants to bid for anyway. With flat DKP, if no one really wants it, min bids will get it for them and people get the gear they need.
---
Ive used EPGP, which is OK, but seriously dissuades people from bidding as your prio gets ruined every item you take. Its very bad for hoarding for certain items, but its good in that people dont get too far ahead in DKP.
---
Zero sum sounds great on paper, but in practice I dont think it works very well at all. Ive used nDKP and it has the same problem of people hoarding DKP as EPGP does, but has a host of other problems that you have to work around. Whenever someone leaves the guild with negative DKP and they stay in the system, it creates a positive sum system.  This usually happens with new people that trial for a few nights, get a few pieces and get a huge negative and then leave. This creates positive values that get worse and worse the longer you raid, which means the more veteran you are, the more DKP youre going to have permanently. If you delete quitters from the guild, you arbitrarily subtract DKP from the people that were in the raids with the quitter and shift the DKP list. While usually its nice to know youre being rewarded for killing bosses, in zero-sum, killing farm bosses feels extremely pointless, since if you DE everything, you get 0 DKP.
---
Generally when people hoard DKP, you kind of just let them, as usually the next person down needs it anyways. In the rare instance that a good piece of loot drops and no one bids, Id usually get mad and start threatening that I was going to inspect gear and pick someone to take it, someones always put a bid in after that though.

Nobody will get fucking WorldBuffs for MC, BWL. And by the time AQ and Naxx rolls around people will be overgeared as fuck.

I am rolling PvE for the reasons I listed, I am just making sure that people don't get suckered in to the fantasy of what PVP servers "could be" and the actual reality of what they actually are. A pain in the ass most of the time, with a very few sprinkles of "hey that was actually a fun fight".
---
The magical level 35 vs level 36 fight as you both come up to the last raptor for kill quest in STV, what they paint it as. 
---
The more probable reality is that it's going to be a bored 60 rogue or mage who no lifed it to max level, purposely to avoid being bothered by PvP while leveling, and ironically coming to punch down on low levels, just out of boredom.
---
All decently put together guilds were connected.  Everyone new everyone.  That's why vanilla was so special.  It's like trying to get away with being a dick in a small town.  Your parents would find out from Jimmy's aunt.
---
Hell even Horde and Alliance guilds on the same server were connected to a certain extent.  If you wanted to ninja something or be an asshole people would find out and you would not be able to make it into PvP premades or into any raiding guild.

Why not focus instead on accents which actually butcher words, such as Scottish? I've never heard so many hard Rs in words that don't contain a single R.

There are plenty of good axes. You don't need to use Quel Serrar. You can get a better weapon than Quel Serrar before Quel Serrar even releases. Or you use Quel Serrar until you get a good axe. Whatever you want to do...

Feels like getting 40 people to spend a few hours every week jumping through hoops to get these buffs would require more effort than getting these 40 people to spend an hour longer in the raid.
---
What about shadowpriest/warlock? Curse of tongues/mana burn/drain the pally, spell lock him, and curse of exhaustion kite the warrior?
---
Honestly, I would recommend leveling solo until at least level 6 (i.e. around the time when you'll be directed towards Goldshire/Kharanos. The early quests had much easier drop rates (or just had quotas), so grouping wasn't a huge boon. The zones were also built assuming you were playing the game "normally", so if you were, say, a dwarf hunter in elowyn forest, you were going to have to run to Stormwind to train (remember, you didn't just learn skills automatically). This was even more of a concern if you were trying to level with a druid since the NE zone didn't have paladin, warlock, or mage trainers, and no one else had druids.  
---
Back in the day I remember 1-10 taking 2-3 hours when I'd roll an alt, and 1-6 is going to be less than half of that time. My wife and I are playing horde, but we aren't planning to meet up until we hit the Barrens at 11-12. If you're dead set on leveling together I would each make an alt that's the same race as your partner's main, and then just take turns leveling to 10 together. Even if you never play the alt again, you'll probably want some bank alts anyways.
---
It made things easier, from all accounts.
---
Most fights don't heal, and MS will knock off other debuffs that are more important.
---
I mean let's just take some rough estimations:
---
On average, the trash items you get from higher level dungeons, 40+, could net you between 1-4 gold, not counting potential AH gains, just pure vendor junk.
---
A rune of portals costs 20 silver. So, in reality, you'll be paying a v ery, very small fee for  a huge time saver and convenience. If all 4 of you pay the mage 10s each, and that's being cheap, he's already made his rune back + 20 silver on top. If you give maybe 40-50 silver each, that's a huge gain for him, and still a minimal loss for you.
---
So yes, next time you get portaled, just pay up. Unless it's really free, then just jump into that shit!
---
Just turn them off for raids, problem solved. I don't see any downsides to something like that.
---
Yeah I can be wrong ofc, but I see noone explaining the extended part reasoning, everything seems batched, from looting to quest accept. The extended leeway might have to do with the "general" batching and not for only spells etc. 
---
If you know the REAL issue, then sure let people know but no one seem to give a decent explantion for it.
---
You can’t create characters from different factions on the same realm in classic. Sorry mate.
---
Nope same faction and same server only.
---
Wait, is this a thing in retail? When the fuck did that happen?
---
&gt; Now that we've had 15 years of experience with the game, it's common knowledge that Dwarf Priest is far more useful than the other races' Priest racial spells.
---
It was as much common knowledge back then as it is now. The only thing that changed is that you turned from stupid casual to someone who pre-checks for optimal builds.
---
The only difference you actually might legit apply is that on release day, the knowledge was not there yet (And I have no beta-posts or similar seen where they advocate to go dwarf). Anyone starting somewhat after the first raid was cleared had no "legit reason" to "not go dwarf", yet they still did.
---
It will just repeat, with probably a slightly more increased number due to better coverage of the topic. Few dwarfs because ugly, lots of humans, lots of nelfs.
---
&lt;Eye of Insanity&gt; **[A] [US] [Pve] [Pacific] [Hardcore]**
---
**_Introduction_**  
---
Eye of Insanity is a guild formed specifically for those who want to be the best on their server and have fun while they do it. We are looking for competitive raiders who enjoy pushing themselves and their guildmates to always be improving. 
---
**_Goals and Expectations_**   
---
Be repectful of the time that everyone puts into getting together. Have consumables ready, do your research of the expected fights, be online and ready to enter the raid at raid time, and be willing to change and adapt as needed during raids. 
---
During raids during any strat explanation or boss pull, chatter is to be kept at a minimum and everyone should be focused on the task at hand. It is expected that everyone raiding understands that the good of the guild is priority number one, and loot will be used to help us succeed as a whole, not just individuals. 
---
**_Guild Culture_**  
---
Classic WoW is very much a game based around community, and having fun, and we want to keep that atmosphere in this guild. You can both be committed to efficient raiding and still like the people you play with. This is an adult guild, so expect adult topics, some swearing etc.
---
We do expect members to be respectful of each other and the fact that people come from a variety of walks of life. Any racism, sexism, homophobia, etc will not be tolerated. There's no ban on talking about controversial subjects, but try not to get divisive over politics, religion, etc. We all share a common interest in Classic WoW, and the golden rule applies here. We are all adults, and there may be people you just don't get along with. We expect people to be able to handle themselves in a mature way. Anyone causing drama will be removed from the guild. 
---
We interview each member in voice chat to make sure that everyone will be a good fit for the guild and for each other. 
---
**_Raid Information_**  
---
We raid Tues/Wed 7:30-11PM Pacific, adding Thurs as needed (which is unlikely until Naxx is out).
---
We use a loot council comprised of the raid leader, role officers, and rotating members of the core raid team. 
---

"English: /ALGEBRA/"

word
---
This gave me one of those deep chuckles you never get tired of
---
&gt;I think that hunters are probably the most unwanted class in dungeons for two reasons: 1. Your pet can many times pull packs accidentally, resulting in wipes... 2. Everything a hunter can do in a dungeon can be done just as well, or better by other classes
---
1) The *smallest* of problems and literally applies to every other class as well. Anyone can fuck up and cause a wipe, accidentally pull extra packs, or not see a pat, etc.
---
2) Ok, tell me one class that can do *all* of those things that hunters can do, I'll wait. You need to tell me a class that can:
---
* Offtank
---
* Kite
---
* Pull and drop all aggro
---
* Hard CC virtually all mobs
---
* Increase move speed of entire party
---
* Survive wipes, and wipe recover with engineering
---
In a dungeon you have **5** people, not 40. The versatility of hunters is what makes them one of the BEST picks for dungeon DPS, I think it's insane you'd call them one of the worst...It doesn't matter if another class can do one of those things better; you can only bring 3 dps classes. Having one that covers all the bases is amazing.
---
but... but.. That was Bruce Almighty...
---
&gt; If I have a horde character as my main, and an alliance character as my alt, would I be able to send my main's gold over to my alt even though they're in two different factions? 
---
No and Yes
---
You cannot send it via the mailbox or trade it, but you can use auctions in Bootybay and Gadgetzan to put high prices on cheep items to transfer gold, those goblins do take a % though.
---
I can't imagine why some that received a bunch of death threats from gamers would be afraid of gamers.
---
You can do it through some creative thinking and the neutral auction houses...
---
You can use the neutral AH, but the cut is like 10% I think.
---
This is the only way
---
That's only on PvP servers.
---
This is just as anecdotal as the person you are replying to. Blizzard has said they are open to the idea of TBC as a "what next" after classic. The content is already created too, so it is easy money for them. I think you are foolish if you believe (and trust) Blizzard to make classic plus content that will be any good.
---
As a vanilla hunter main I fell like this is this post is about" dont roll hunter because I don't want competition".
---
Buying arrows it's not that bad, and it pays for itself how easily you can farm as a hunter,
---
Pet happiness,as your pet loyalty raises you will spend less and less meat, like 1piece per 30min or more.
---
PvP it shines 1vs1, small bg, big bg, world PvP, you name it, and you can easily control more than 1 enemy, traps scatter shots slows, even pet for drawbacks, or pick engineer if you want extra cc's/gadgets.
---
In pve your damage will be good/great in phase 1 to maybe 3/4.
---
Seems at odds tho just cuz the majority of streamers are horde to go along w pop of beta as well
---
That's only for pvp realms. If you're on a pve realm you can.
---
You could risk it by putting an obscure item on the neutral auction house for a ridiculous price then purchase it on your character of the opposing faction
---
You can't even have a horde and alliance character on the same server unless you have multiple accounts.
---
You need to L2P noob!  Better start practicing that Conjure Mana skill cuz that's all your going to be doing!  LoL!!!!!!!
---
Mulgore is great because it just feels like home and Stormwind still makes it in to the workout rotation.
---
You right. I assumed. My apologies.
---
*Judgement intensifies.*
---
Same reason you'll find something like longswords and broadswords used universally for generic 1-handed swords.
---
The devs didn't know any better and things were chosen because they sound cool.
---
I’m hpal and pvp with my spriest friend and we fucking own, we can easily take on 3 people of any class. 
---
Still not as strong as me and some of my warrior bros, but very powerful non the less. 
---
Only thing I would say is you won’t have blessing of wisdom at all. Downtime between BOP and freedom you’ll have blessing of sacrifice. Putting wisdom on you is not good enough to counteract the potential for CC on the Paladin
---
Because Scottish isn't irritating to me I guess.
---
Blizz confirmed 1 faction per server
---
A lot higher than the chances of classic plus content.
---
You hear that, Blizzard?  GrokFu is fucking OUT if you don't get this fixed!  You have 14 days.
---
However you can put a white item on the shared auctionhouse for alot of gold with the character you want to send gold to and buy the item with the char on the other faction. 
---
Beware though, I think the shared AH takes a higher cut.
---
People of Ironforge! It's time for a SEXY party!
---
You’re missing the point. No one cared about your race back in Vanilla and no one will care about your race in Classic. Just let the man play undead because no racial is as good as the pserver tryhards make them out to be.
---
The fuck are you talking about. You are NOT able to summon inside instances.
---
Bad dad bot... oh wait
---
I enjoyed Wrath quite a bit, but you're not wrong in that it was the beginning of the end. Too many changes started to make it easier. I continued to raid through it, though. Cata is what killed the game, for me.
---
Give me free shit (that costs you money btw) or I'll never group with you again!  Oh no...
---
&gt;If no one wants to bid dkp on an item, then greed rolls,
---
seems like another avenue for exploit.  You get together with all the other people that want an item, and just tell everyone to greed it.
---
And we'll make the Blackrock clan pay for it.
---
Me and two of my friends made 29 warrior twinks and we would all focus on guy and just insta kill them. That shit was hilarious.
---
!Remind 78 days
---
That is true! Head canon is best canon, but everybody's canon works differently
---
Classic video, right here.
---
I'm in beta, and I have noticed playing Mage isn't as free as Vanilla.
---
 Sometimes even 2-3 melee mobs below my level can cause issue and force me to just do a basic single target rotation because I have to eat more melee attacks than I should be.
---
I can think of at least 10 variations to holy that have a use in PvE and PvP.
---
For pve?
---
I'd like to see this magical PvP server where people no 60s every go on a ganking spree in a lower level zone, gankers wait until you finish a mob and heal up, someone says "you know what, I got 10 levels on this guy, better hold up" and someone says "hey xXlegolas420Xx" you sit back, let me 1v1 this guy, it's only fair.
---
Either you are on one end of that dynamic or the other, and the fabled two players meet each other on the road and proceed to fight is not even going to be half of the PVP fights a player will have. 
---
And everyone knows that this is the truth about PVP servers, and yet they like to pretend it's not, because it's advantageous for them to convince players that it isn't.
---
How can you kill that which has no life?
---
It would be pretty shitty.
---
Come on dude literally anybody can edit wiki
---
Most content was crushed with no world buffs, people wearing pirate hats, and 4 or 5 people AFK on /follow.
---
Definitely should add one more resto Druid so they can be assigned HOTS one to MT and the other to OT. 2x battle rez’s and 2x innervates will keep your integral raid members alive and your top DPS from going OOM. I’d swap it for one of the resto shamans.
---
Not really a risk, if you post some grey item for a bunch of gold and someone buys it before you, that’s a straight win.
---
I thought they fixed that. It was an obvious bug and one of the first things reported on Day 1 of the Beta.
---
On a recent fresh launch me and a group of paladins did the whole verigans fist quest. 1 tank 3 dps and me on heals. It was easy but I’ll admit that obviously DM / &amp; SFK aren’t really the most challenging and you only need to go to the entrance of BFD
---
This isn't information or facts, it's my opinion.
---
If the problem is that your raid keeps wiping due to bad players, I would try to fix that problem head on. Find better players. I had success raiding back in the day as a pretty casual player and never had even heard of this process. Raiding wasn't so difficult.
---
Absolutely, “pvp happened on a pvp server” and ninja looting are not comparable.
---
Can we get a confirmation from someone? 
---
Thank you btw
---
&gt; SW:P alone can almost 100-0 a player.
---
[https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=10894/shadow-word-pain](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=10894/shadow-word-pain)
---
Right ... are you fighting grays ?
---
Add a third of damage with the talent and whatever spell damage a dot takes you're still very far from killing anybody with SWP.
---
I agree, no one should play hunter but me.
---
Yooo this is how you got away from mobs when you were low HP
---
Run away and use the keyboard turn buttons and snake your way, and the mobs will just get stuck while trying to follow your path. 
---
This was like every day business for me as a Warrior
---
I don't know how anyone can perceive any accent as more infuriating than the Australian accent. Even hearing an Australian talk gives me this instant rage.

Nm looks like everyone is confirming it lol

/r/classicwow: NO CHANGES!
---
Also /r/classicwow: HERE'S A LIST OF CHANGES!
---
Hi, /u/DenasKnight
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bzg6vq/hello_there_seen_in_fightporn_sub/). 
---
In WoW Classic, you’ll have the following character limits per WoW account:
---
A maximum of 10 characters per WoW Classic realm
---
A maximum of 50 characters across all of the WoW Classic realms in your region
---
Only one faction per realm on PvP realms
---
No overlap or regard with the character limits in Battle for Azeroth
---
You’ll be able to have up to 50 Battle for Azeroth characters and up to 50 WoW Classic characters at the same time.
---
My b, looks like you should be able to on pve
---
The down vote button just isn't powerful enough to express how much I dislike this comment
---
Frost spec was the best spec, but it will be nice to be able to go fire again and still have a low rank frost bolt on the bar for slows. Before someone decides that this is far too complex for my limited brain and gates them behind spec walls.
---
Had forgotten about coming to raid while flagged.
---
Hunter, lock, and mage most likely. Maybe shadow priest. The key to solo was usually exploiting ledges and using range attacks.
---
Because that’s not really how it works, you can get the majority of the buffs that matter in 15-20 minutes and then save 1-2 hours in the raid.
---
Top geared feral druid comes to mind.
---
Other than that maybe hunter and warlock with a lot of kiting cc and aggro bouncing between you and pet
---
I honestly really like the idea of War Mode in BfA and I would even be in favor of implementing it for Classic WoW, but with a few changes attached.
---
There is a few things that I really dislike about War Mode and if those could get fixed, then it would be awesome.
---
1. Different phases. I really don't like that people who have WM activated are in a different phase than the rest. It causes an unhealthy split. Imo people with WM should stay in the same phase as everyone else with the only difference that PvP is enabled for them.
---
2. Bonus XP is a bad idea. WM should not give any PvE or leveling benefits. It only fosters the mentality of people turning on WM for that extra quest XP, while not really wanting to engage in the actual PvP. Instead they should think of a few different rewards for WM users that are actually PvP-focused and encourage players to PvP each other.
---
If those two changes could be made for WM, it would imo be the best solution for WoW. I do like World PvP, but honestly... sometimes there are just times when I only wanna quest and level in peace, you know.
---
Would it stack with the 15% mana regeneration while casting from Druid talents?
---
The hots not stacking sounds sucky.
---
Unless you played vanilla you really don't know how strong a warrior/pally combo was.  Warrior/Pally beats any two classes in vanilla period.  The lock would not last long enough for you to kill the warrior, which is what you would need to do to win.  Pally bubbles and you can't touch him.  Warrior has intercept + freedom and two ways to break fears. A stun from the pally to shut down one of the casters and hamstring to keep the other close.  The fight would be over before the bubble breaks.  This doesn't even use any consumables (free action pot) or any engineering tricks either.    
---
Now... If the warlock is using a succubus, then they might have a show, but I think it would still go down roughly the same way.
---
If a mage ever pulled that, it's a snap hearthstone for me.
---
Good shout I didnt even think about the swords when doing this post, really reinforces that point
---
It's about 1 year and 6 months.
---
So, I give it 5-6 more months before I am bored or burned out.
---
Nope, Canada.
---
I don't get the effect in dead Zone . Could you explain please?
---
I dont think mages can solo bossess.
---
Trash mobs sure,bosses not so much.
---
I think he meant he’s out of the Hunter class. I’m with him, it would screw over Hunters and make people choose other classes that aren’t doomed to be heavily disadvantaged by core game mechanics.
---
It's not semantics. What you described is clipping.
---
I know what you mean after your reply to my first post, but someone reading that could believe you cast Aimed Shot, then you have to wait for Auto to "cast". Like 3 sec for Aimed then 2.6 sec more for auto (if the weapon is 2.6 attack speed).
---
But all good, man. Don't worry about me. I'll show myself the way out. ;)
---
Even if your hs is on cooldown, it will reset the cd to one hour.
---
Behold, the glory of still being able to throw fireballs and use arcane explosion as a frost mage. Even though you don't need to generally, it's wonderful to know that you could if you wanted to. This last sentence summarizes my disappointment with the current state of all of the classes in retail.
---
Yeah, will see.
---
The difference is he gave his post a meme title and the crowd goes crazy.... Because reddit is full of goldfish.
---
Don't listen to this jerk, *I* think it is a neat idea and appreciate the obvious effort you put into it.
---
I am not saying anyone HAS to do anything. If you want to play undead bc you like the aesthetic, all the power to you. But he is asking because he wants an honest answer. And the honest answer is that weapon skill is quite good. Most people will probably pick an undead and never look back. But, some people will actually end up regretting their choice as they realise they are inferior in both PvE and in PvP and their chosen racials don't feel very useful.
---
If you play your UD tank the same amount as another prospective orc  tank in your guild, and get similarly geared to him, then he will either be tankier than you or putting out more threat than you if you are equal skill wise. This could lead to him being the natural choice for main tank over you. That also makes him the natural choice for Thunderfury over you. That might not be something you are very happy to find out after leveling your character to 60.
---
This is coming from someone who has played Night Elf Warrior for a long time.  I love being Night Elf, but I have to go extra try hard to make up for my choice of race. In Classic, I will probably roll human.
---
&gt; Is the same thing possible to do by just watching the animation?
---
No. You could time it but it takes a LOOOOT of work. 
---
And when Improved Hawk Aspect procs that goes out the window.
---
Nah, the aussies are cool imo. Don't get me wrong, some American accents are cool. Boston isn't so bad, texas is alright, but the standard one and california are terrible.
---
uh, money? that's the whole point man... believe it or not, at the end of the day Bliz doesn't give a fuck about you. They want your cash.  If the server costs them more than it makes them, it will not exist. simple.
---
Seems like the leelag has been building up for about 15 years of vanilla and now on beta its finnaly starting to hit u more aat longer distances...
---
Must be somethin bliz can do to keep that leeway smaller and mobs hittin you from 2 miles a way!!
---
Thanks! so much hate on this sub sometimes.
---
Sure does.
---
Unpopular opinion that will be buried in this thread -
---
You don’t need world buffs, people will clear most new content week 1. The game is radically different now than in 2004 and players are much better than they were.
---
Faxmonkey ftw
---
More misogyny directed at a women with power from the gaming community.. what else is new
---
Most of the LFG people will be weeded out by level 20. If some of them do make it to 60, they will be forced to change habits.
---
Alliance are the the bad guys though!
---
What do you think of Ynarri White Dwarf?
---
This might come as a shock to you, but for the majority of people, they made their character before they started raiding.
---
Did you get rewarded based on how long you were in the bg?
---
Wouldnt a druid with innervate be better?
---
Sorry I'm a less petty person than you?
---
It's because attunements weren't supposed to be a thing in the original design. You were supposed to run 40 people through UBRS to enter the portal behind the Rend arena (where Nefarian runs off to during the fight). Same thing for MC (portal in BRD) and Naxx (portal in Strat).
---
But when they decided to cap instances to 10-15 people that would have meant running in 10-15 at a time which would be ridiculous. So as a QoL change they added shortcuts.
---
I dont think you understand how burden of proof works. You are right that you have to prove your claims when you make claims that goes against what is well known.
---
This is not the case here. If I claim the sky is blue then I dont have to prove that if anyone disagrees. But it's funny how your army of spergs downvoted me when you were caught being wrong.
---
&gt;Right, so put away the Quel’Serrar and buy a blue axe from the auction house because you’re an orc.
---
How did I miss the point? How was I supposed to glean that the point of this sentence was "noone cares about your race in Vanilla or Classic"? You make no sense.
---
Esfand did it on stream. I can send a link of the clip this evening
---
And then you realize he had no clue what he was doing and was poorly itemized.
---
Most classes bring something to the group that costs them gold. Pallys druid and priest have item that cost gold as reagents for their buffs. Rogue poisons costs gold. Tanks take damage and therefore have to repair gear even in a wipeless run. You are expected to use the utility your class brings in dungeon groups without being stingy over 80 silver.
---
This is fantastic. Thank you for sharing! It will be my go to guide in August.
---
Hi guys,
---
EU - Alliance - PVE (prefer but not mandatory)
---
I’m looking for a PVE-focused guild that’s planning to level hard but raid easy (ie. not going crazy with world buffs and consumables). 
---
Due to family duties I can only raid from about 10pm - 1am server time, so quite late by European standards. I’m looking for a guild that is planning similar raiding times.
---
My main will be a Druid, preferably full tanking spec or a mix of tank/healer. I’ve been playing since the original beta, and am currently loving the new one!
---
Gotta love the level 120s camping hellfire peninsula for 2 hours.
---
On the flip side I was in the #2 raiding guild on my server for most of Vanilla, then later the #1 guild for parts of AQ/Naxx (and this guild, Ascent, was the world first Raq kill guild so its not like they weren't super-hardcore) and neither guild was hardcore about getting these buffs. I feel like the Ony/Nef buffs were the only ones we went for and even then it wasn't a requirement.
---
But then again I was a resto Druid so I guess it wasn't important to get a lot of the DPS buffs. I know I wasn't forced to get the stats buffs, though.
---
So yeah I saw every fight in Vanilla raiding except the last 2 Naxx bosses (quit WoW before my guild got past 4H) without being a hardcore buff raider.
---
LOL. Look at this guys we have a Prophet over here. Take your prophecies of doom and begone.
---
what is dead may never die
---
Woups! I stand corrected.
---
This names a lot if sense. In wc2 the main human building went townhall, keep, then castle. 
---
Using this in game terminology it makes sense SFK is a keep and not a castle such as Stormwind
---

---
Take everything fuck everyone
---
TBC is its own amazing system as well. It brought the beginning stages of a lot of issues but it's quality of class balance and raid content easily compensate.
---
easiest solution is play on a non pve server.
---
Yes, I am aware. That doesn't make it any lazier, though.
---
We did this with Ash'jre Thul, literally everyone with a hunter alt in our guild had it, AQ was out before our first ERB.
---
Arise my champignon
---
The leeway doesnt effect the dead zone at all. But because hunters have to kite everything this is going to make life of a hunter so much harder.
---
If you like contemplating stuff like this checkout /r/warcraftlore. This is right up their alley!
---
I already did and leveled to 5. But i dont want to take more yet,want the real classic xD
---
We delete comments/posts naming private servers (except Nostalrius) or asking about how to play on private servers and in most cases will redirect main posts related to them to r/wowservers.
---
Lets give this a shot
---
I used to blacklist players with ignore. I had to get an add on for a longer ignore list
---

Generally roll for what role you are in. If the group has no need for the side item then tell them in advance.
---
Depends on the group, but if say a priest rolled on Cape of the Brotherhood... without saying it prior it might not be great
---
I agree with you, something should be done with world buffs and raiding! Someone mentioned just removing world buffs in instances and I would totally be done for that.
---
Upvoting this comment so it gets attention. Game mechanics like this disadvantage certain classes and just make the game look wonky. You shouldn’t be able to melee someone from 25 feet away.
---
People these days think they can just open up Google Paint and slap Onyxia's name over Lady Prestor's model and fool people.
---
I DONT WANT WARLOCKS SUMMONING ME INTO DUNGEONS I DON'T WANT TO BE SOMMONED INTO! Fix it blizzard,.,..
---
are you able to summon them once they zone in? cause I remember being able to do it once they hit the instance.
---
You don't need reagents to buff if you individually buff also I carry every group I join.  Pay up or lata bish
---
You're forgetting the cast time. At 75g per hour, which any decent AoE mage can accomplish, that portal costs 20s for the rune and 20s 83c for the cast time, plus another ~20s to create the water and recoup the mana.
---
Anything less than 60s for a portal is robbery.
---
It's almost as if there's a lot of different people frequenting this subreddit.
---
You completely missed the pt.  It was fun for you back then, because you didn't spend hours farming buffs.
---
The secret to playing together, roll a character solely to play together. It sounds like you realize you and your friends play schedules will be a bit different, so rather than have the temptation to play when he's not around, just have a dedicated partner character and a dedicated solo character.
---
Not directly. You'll need to use a third party and the neutral AH in Booty Bay. Ex. Alliance character posts garbage grey for 300G, Horde friend buys grey and you reimburse friend for appropriate amount. Alliance character collects 255g (300 minus 15%) plus the deposit.

Roll need unless you wanna be ninja’d
---
I'm totally going to create a guild like that in PVE Europe server for casual players like me that don't have time to farm between raids because of work.
---
The only change i'll make is that we won't forbid using consumables for those who want.
---
Being tank i'll think i'll farm for flasks
---
;)
---
I roll on anything I want and I justify it by being better than the group.
---
I don't think anyone has ever argued that ret paladin isn't decent in worldpvp
---
Where? I cant see him because the druid is in the way.
---
Atiesh baby! But realistically I'm probably just gonna have a good time with friends and not set any hard goals for myself or my friends.
---
How would this be beneficial for the other people?
---
Take it at your own pace and enjoy it. Some people enjoy speed leveling, and that's fine. Not my thing, personally.
---
I loved this show
---
I think you usually only have one hunter with the debuff up though.
---
But the fact that we are so polarized shows that your argument isnt valid either. We didnt co.e together as One to ask for classic wow. I never asked for it and a lot of retail despise it. It only took maybe 10k on private servers for blizzard to realize that they could make money off people who were playing their game for free. These threads show exactly that a large portion of people want tbc or wrath. I did ask for classic I wanted a good version of wow. I consider up to wotlk as good versions of wow. They gave me classic so I will play classic with the Hope's of the next two expansions coming out. 
---
Blizzard has the numbers of when people joined and quit. And anecdotally from this sub it's clear that a lot of people like the first three expacs. It's likely that they will listen to players once again and offer the next two expansions and only the next two. They know cataclysm was the down fall.
---
Id rather have a bear tank for 5 man grinding any day. Way better dps, and they bring a buff, cc and better AOE threat. So, if you dont care about 40 mans, you can totally bear it up.
---
Can't wait for Blizzards sassy blue post saying 'we tested it, it's authentic.'
---
I saw every raid boss in Vanilla (except the last 2 Naxx bosses) without being in a guild that required these buffs or spent any sort of time fucking with them. Maybe some random DPS would get whatever they could but it wasn't a requirement and we weren't out as a guild helping eachother get these buffs. We were just raiding at raid time. If you could get a buff before raid time, cool.
---
This was in 2 different guilds. Both of which were the top 2 raiding guilds on my server (Medivh, which was PvE which made getting the buffs even easier). The guild I did Naxx with was also the guild who world firsted-Rag so its not like they weren't hardcore.
---
Yep, I just think it's really interesting how polarizing the community is.
---
I do agree world buffs make things trivial. But they are part of the content, and some people are going to want to put in the work for them.
---
The resist gear is still going to be a barrier for a number of fights, along with artificial barriers (such as quintessence for rag)
---

What am I, Trump?
---
There's no disconnect. You just have the typical reddit gamer mentality that if you don't like something, it's not enough to simply not like it: you have to justify to yourself that your opinion is objectively correct.
---
Unfortunately this is a completely subjective thing, so in order to justify your "objective" belief you just make up bullshit assumptions about the mental state of literally everyone on PvP servers, and also ignore the fact that it's an optional gameplay mode that everyone on the server has signed up for.
---
You can also get in a casual guild not full of retards and clear mc in just 1 night though still spending several hours in there
---
Agreed.
---
I plan to clear Naxx as a human warrior tank, then hope to start on a fresh server if we get them on a horde priest not sure which race yet. 
---
If the GM grind gets less crazy as servers age I might try for it one day. 
---
As our group doesn’t plan on more than 2 raid days I’m giving us 2-3 years before we are fully BiS on our Alliance characters. After that who knows. Hopefully we get BC by then. If they give us fresh servers every few years I could see playing classic for a long time.
---
Locks need soul shards which are annoying and fill up bags.  Mages make portals food and water.  The choice is clear.
---
(Vaporware\*\*, no? Because it’s about as concrete as vapor)
---
It was not right, or even close to Blizzlike, but it's a change that improved the gameplay experience tremendously... For a month.
---
Even a stopped clock is right twice a day.
---
Yes its possible,no its not a problem
---
It was nice that they changed it with cata, but now that it has been longer that the boy chased the girl... It seems wrong ^^
---
A some related anecdote from 2005ish, I used to farm Tyr's hand on a rogue using crippling poison. If I ran around a melee mob in the right way, I couldn't use melee abilities but my autoattacks would still happen, and the mob would not be in range to attack me. I could farm mobs without losing hp
---
If you want to play a warlock then play a warlock. You will learn how to play it as you level. They are a decently easy class too. Hard part is making bag space for soulshards
---
&gt; I'm sorry but the pathing : https://youtu.be/79RqTEmUjLI?t=131 on Hydrospawn is really really stupid.
---
That's basically the story of hunters soloing Tribute.
---
If you want to play a warlock, play a warlock. They are bad ass in classic. No idea why your friend advises against them. They are way more fun to play than mages in my opinion.
---
Since you just have to own a sub I don’t think they will.  Plus all of us with mini diablos want to keep our coolness sacred haha

After hitting 60, I want to invest time in developing a science-based, 100% dragon mmo. I expect it to take 2 years.
---
Both are great, IMO. IIRC, Warlocks start a little slower, but can get pretty insane sometime right around or right after T2.
---
You don't need to buff everyone anyway, just the tanks and a few tank healers. That's enough to trivialize the fight.
---
I think the logical response to that though is if I'm tanking I should charge the party every time I die for repair bills? I know some tanks try to require first orb on Live Strat runs, but for the rest of them? 
---
I guess you can always ask for some silver for the mats, but really it seems more of a way to irritate people at the end of a dungeon.
---
Depending on your internet service, a VPN is probaly necessary to get a better ping time.
---
Quit being reasonable and yell at someone 😂. Seriously though, if anyone had offered me tbc I would have been ecstatic. But they didnt and they still offered one of the good versions of wow so I will play it and wait for the inevitable expacs
---
You'll be gimping yourself in 1 area or another but depending on your spec it won't be too bad.

---
Most classes have a hybrid build that will work in PvP and PvE.
---
Unless you're a main tank, main heal, or maybe clearing world first content you'll need to spec into a build that isnt viable in PVP.
---
There are only a few builds that arent very viable in PvP, like Holy Pally, Holy Priest, Resto Druid, Prot Warrior.
---
Do you think they would mind a cross post?
---
Once everyone has all their gear from a dungeon (above bwl) the damage meters are not your friend.
---
However that's a long way to go. And as hunters are underrepresented in raid (maybe 2 max 3) the road to maxxed out gear is often easier for you than let's say mage/shaman/fury warrior.
---
In pve you are to dps what druids are to healing ; occasionally functional (enough to be needed) but underperforming stats-wise (beyond bwl).
---
In return you get a character that stands out in pvp, leveling, making money and most important for me : class identity.
---
Add everything up and hunters are a strong choice,to the point that if you enjoy playing them, it's no choice at all.
---
Classic isn't even out yet, they are not going to talk about anything after it right now.
---
That is the truth, but at the same time... WoW did have a good endgame and was smoother.
---
Some of the classes and specs while easy to play were hard to master and for the longest time theorycrafting  and understanding the rotation needed and how to execute it while in any situation kept people going.
---
Honestly, I think it's a reasonable assumption, why would blizz make a new webpage to allow us to create characters when they could just launch the server and not let us actually log in.
---
Hunter is one class where if you spec right you can still be quite competitive in both PvP and PvE
---
If streamers don’t know anything you think reddit would be more informed? Didn’t just want to use google?
---
&gt; Is it possible to do both pvp,pve, wpvp raids etc on all 1 character?
---
Yeah. IMO Hunters, mages, warlocks, and rogues can do all these things at a high level with the same spec. 
---
I think the other classes tend to run into some problems, though.
---
Just have all buffs drop upon entering an instance.  How is this hard.
---
back in wrath (before LFD) i had a list of people i would never invite because they either quit, or were dicks.

Have you learned nothing from the past?  Sending too many troops out in the field is how Stormwind burned during the first war.  Had we resolved to hold these walls above the concerns of the outer realm, we would beaten the horde during the siege, and saved millions of lives.  The brotherhood only exists because the former king failed to defend the heart of the kingdom and we were forced to rebuild it at great expense.  
---
I trust Lady Prestor's reports that the frontiers are well provisioned, and that such attacks by the blackrock and difias are merely meant to force us to misdeploy our valuable forces.

Two or more level 60's at Rank 10, Naxx cleared.

My casual vanilla raid guild had raids 5-6 days/week (most people only attended a few of those). Our raids were usually 3 hours, sometimes 2.5 if we started late.
---
* MC
---
* BWL Night 1 (plus Ony)
---
* BWL Night 2
---
* First half of AQ40
---
* ZG
---
* AQ20
---
Sometimes we'd have alt runs on the off day, so it wasn't unusual to have some raid event going 7 days a week.
---
In RNG we trust
---
Tried Bing but didn't turn much up, we don't have Google in my Country
---
I find mages to be a little more boring, warlocks as fun both bring something unique to the table. The choice is yours believe in the heart of the card yugi
---
I don't really see the problem. If these buffs are trivializing content that is already easy in itself, it sounds like they really won't be that crucial to have. You're definitely not going to be able to keep up with true min/maxers, but that's not such a terrible thing if you're not a true min/maxer.
---
This is how I felt about the Cata pre-patch, too!
---
If something doesn’t turn up much, do you think it’s happening?
---
xrealm is cancer, period.
---
"Future of Classic WOW" Magic 8 ball replied most likely. I'll take that as a good sign
---
Sounds interesting. Drop SWP and heal through damage. At what level do dungeon bosses do too much damage to heal through? i.e. a one shot. 40?
---
These look like names I'd see on a corpse
---
wpvp has never been a thing and never will be...  It's been 15 fucking years already.  Just let the dream die.

---
Having to farm for shards isn't close to the same level as 'now I can't log in for 6 days to keep my buffs'.
---
&lt;im Klo brennt noch Licht&gt;
---
...how did I miss the point? You spent a long time buffing up for the raid, but you couldn't just teleport inside to the boss, you had to run through the *World of Warcraft* to get there, and you might run into a *war* or a single bloodthirsty *warrior* in that *world*. I see this as a positive for immersion and realm relationship building.
---
Agreed! It was a crazy fun bg, but if you had to leave before it ended, you kinda felt you wasted 8 hours. If just all active participants would receive the bonus no matter if they were in the bg or not at the end, it would have been golden
---
this.
---
... but seriously, just roll on it. you're healing for the group. you're entilted to the loot. it's not your fault that Blizzard's itemization in Classic dungeons is piss-poor for Holy Paladins.
---
This is the most likely outcome. The will give people the option to move forward and some will want to stay in classic. They will join servers if population becomes a problem. And eventually they will probably open fresh servers for the guilds and hardcore players who enjoy the fresh race. I dont know why it's so hard or contrivirsial to understand that they will most likely release their two kost loved expacs that follow the original story line. They have the data about what happened to the game when cataclysim came out. They wont move past wotlk but they definetly will give the people what they want. And a lot of people will continue to pay 15$ a month if you give them new raids and fancy new gear.
---
Vanilla warlocks didn't have a closet.  It was only the single summon spell.  I don't know why they'd be using the warlock summon closet in BRM during WotLK.  The summoning portal (closet) wasn't added until patch 3.0.8.
---

"Major implications for wPvP" as in you would kill an opposing faction member before an entrance, they would release, run back and resurrect right before entering the raid without you ever touching them again...
---
All this did was delay some guild's raid by 10-20 minutes, depending on the raid's entrance. Onyxia was the easiest to get to, BWL the hardest.
---
It has zero implications for wPvP, ganking people before the raid's entrance is the worst excuse for world PvP there's ever been.

We usually did Mondays before reset and Wednesday for the main raid. MC BWL AQ20 ZG on farm, AQ40 was completed but not comfortable to place on farm yet. Naxx we didnt get into since people were being lazy with attunement.

Thursday and Sunday was for the 2nd raid group IF they weren't running same days as us (to race the main group).
---
Ill take near impossible achievements over the current state of "everyone gets a title because we are an accessible and inclusive game" every single day of the week
---
I played in Vanilla both Lock and a Rogue as well as tank Paladin in TBC along with both previously mentioned classes and I remember how "sharply" you could kite even with melee classes when the mob was slowed etc..
---
It is good to hear from a beta available person that I am not imagining things when I look at these videos closely, being "I do not remember that kind of behavior...".
---
I'd like to finish Naxx, but realistically, I'll keep playing as long as my friends are playing, and I'll probably quit whenever they quit.
---
&gt; It's not good gameplay, and it's not something I think we need the n'th degree of in Vanilla WoW for it to be successful.
---
It's also a player-made problem.  They aren't necessary.  If some people feel like they *need* them to squeeze every last ounce of optimization out of their character, that is their problem, not mine.
---
Awesome! Thanks for the link
---
Paladins can live for (almost) ever, have some AOE and can heal themselves with Plate armor.
---
This strategy probably tops out at SM.
---
Rogues and druids can stealth past some higher level dungeons and kill targeted bosses.

&gt;There is tons of discussion about Old AV. As stated by many posters, the 1.12 version of AV was more well received by the community. The reason is simple. Old AV gave poor honor rewards. The battles lasted so long that you would often never receive the end match bonus. Players avoided Old AV, because the honor gains in WSG and AB were way better. Matches were shorter which allowed players to earn the victory bonuses. 
---
Tbf its going to be a lot harder to earn the rep w/o having the time to just farm it. 
---
I think the change helps us in 1 area, where there are plenty of  other options to farm honor, other bgs/ worldPvP, but will hurt us when it comes to getting the needed rep for these things. The extememly long games allow for much more rep gain at the cost of honor, imo and it was a fair trade off for 1 of the BGs. Later when the armour and items gotten from AV started to under compete gear dropped in raids it made sence to change it to honor based vs rep based. When it starts that way all it will do is make it much harder to get the items people play the BG for.
---
PvP is the only way. Its always been the only way, especially during TBC when you were on the Isle of Quel'danas doing dailies and it became a gigantic Horde vs Alliance. That shit was so much fun.
---
You can't just stack buffs that easy, they are on a cooldown and on mid to high population servers you can't expect them to be available everytime you want to raid. With the relaunch even more randoms and casuals will be able to raid, so less buffs for everyone. 
---
They only last a limited amount of time, you know how much trash is in classic raids and how long it takes to travel?
---
Accidently run into world pvp, step of the zeppelin etc. and they are gone.
---
Also for progression raids it is common to wipe often. It only needs one out of 40 players being brain afk or someones hunter pet etc. 
---
40 people led to a lot of breaks because of real life issues, telephone calls, visitors, one goes afk, 20 more grab a drink or go to the toilet, and when you came back someone managed to pull half the raid trash. 
---
People compare vanilla too much with private servers, difficulty will be more than enough. They will only be mandatory for hardcore worldfirst tryhards on low pop PvE servers.
---
I always liked enchanting because it's easy as hell, you don't really have to go out of your way to do it, and you can usually make pretty solid money doing it. 
---
IIRC, cooking becomes insanely valuable sometime around AQ, also.
---
One of the best things about Classic is the variety you can get out of the talent tree systems. It’s easy to research the cookie cutter builds, but players are *still* finding new talent specs that revolve around hybrid builds. Play with the talent calcs on the classic DB and find someone online that is familiar with that particular class.
---
Why are they in a modern looking house?

---
I'm doing Herb + Engi. There will be plenty of alchemists, befriending one means you don't have to level it yourself. Engi is in part for pvp purposes, but sapper charges are so stupidly overpowered for many encounters.
---
I get what you're saying but this bugs me just as much. I get irritated at odd things, I know.
---
Before we go all "YOU'RE RUINED ON THIS SERVER YOU HEAR ME ***RUINED***" at launch because the tank rage-quit DM let's all remember that jumping into Classic a lot of us have forgotten these things and become accustomed to the way dungeons play out on live servers. People never played early WoW will have an especially hard time settling into the reality that dungeon wipes are okay, not unusual, require communication and coordination to prevent, and that they need to learn how much time to set aside to complete one.
---
The game itself will nip this problem in the bud for the most part. People will adapt or quit long before their server reputation comes into question.

I don’t understand what you’re trying to say here.

Why should a Hunter store their pet for instances? The only reason I can think of is because this prevents bad hunters from accidentally pulling.

Blizz has already said if Classic is a success they would consider TBC and Wrath servers.
---
Does that mean a forced Classic to TBC to Wrath or 3 separate server options? That we don't know and neither does Blizz.

With Classic still months away we most likely won't hear anything until next year's Blizzcon.

---
I wish so desperately that we would only be able to bring worldbuffs into raids part of the time, maybe during the DMF week only. 
---
It is the perfect fix, because world buffs are the most toxic fun-destroying life-destroying thing in the game, but once In a while is not so bad. And, I know there are speedrun enthusiasts who would be upset if they were gone entirely. 
---
If this doesn’t happen, I think the only way I will be able to play the game is if I just purge people’s buffs all day every day until the community agrees not to collect them anymore.
---
I hate worldbuffs. First weeks of naxx where they are disabled on private servers are heaven.
---
PVP, and that's legitimately it. I don't really have time to do the PVE thing. I swore off raiding ever since I did it hardcore from TBC through WOTLK. Completely burned me out and felt like a 2nd job. I just wanna log on with my friends, do bgs, world pvp, at our own pace.
---
They could have a hard drive to record the streams then upload the vods later.
---
An illusion? What are you hiding?
---
They aren't going to top dps meters until aq40 naxx. But they're still really good. And summoning, soul stones, pets are super awesome to have. Awesome pvpers too. No reason not to play a warlock.
---
Either way this post was a success I have learned information that I did not know before.
---
I played a Mage in Vanilla and really loved it. I’m gonna roll Mage again for my first char in classic. I was always envious of Warlocks tho (kind of a grass is always greener type thing, and locks seemed to have a pretty substantial upper hand in a Mage vs Lock 1v1).
---
Your friend is probably saying to avoid Lock because of the soul shard farming. And I think that’s reasonable tbh, but Locks also have pets and life tap, which are both amazing.
---
I don’t think you can go wrong either way. Play what you want or make both!
---
It's *never* been about needing them.
---
I had a friend on wow, one of the best players ive ever known, who i met in a guild. And he would play After the Burial, Veil of Maya, Acacia Strain, Misery signals, Black dahlia murder, through open mic into his ventrilo, and he absolutely changed my perspective on metal music during vanilla and bc. 
---
I was listening to avenged sevenfold and escape the fate etc and my life positively changed for the better (and i became a guitarist because of it).

---
Yes you can, it's just a complicated process involving black market AH in booty bay
---
You can't make these comparisons without knowing the pings of the players in both examples. WoW uses client side movement prediction so on your screen you always appear farther away from stuff than you actually are. The beta is full of Europeans playing on an American server with 150+ ms ping so the effect is going to be especially bad for them. If you are comparing a 60ms ping vanilla PVE video to a 150ms ping European beta tester you are going to see stuff like this.
---
This is such a load of bullshit.
---
I can maybe remember 5 cases where a player went so overboard that the whole server ignored them.
---
Otherwise there were ninja looters guild hopping and players getting poached from other guilds and besides some whining nothing really happened.

I respect the effort for a troll tbh

Did you forget the /s?  I honestly can't tell anymore.

I come from a neglectful home. I never brushed my teeth as a child. So the habit is still one I'm forming.
---
In addition, I have come to realize that WoW is a powerful compulsion for me. It's escapism. I used it as an escape as a child, literally spending every penny I had on cyber cafes to play it. I used it as an adult to escape dealing with my depression.
---
My depression is heavily tied to my hygiene, and personal care. My "standards" are so low, due to growing up surrounded by cockroaches, that escaping my problems led to me living in a trash heap. I cleared out seventeen bags of trash from my studio apartment. I am leading a clean(er) life without WoW. I do brush my teeth. I regularly bathe. I got a gym membership.

Will I risk it all in August? Yeah, probably.

I think his main point was that it was dumb that to play "optimally," he has to not play at all to preserve his world buffs.
---
Which is stupid.
---
The answer is to see how ridiculous this behavior is, making significant investments of time and energy for a relatively marginal short term benefit. Recognize world buffs are nice but not required, and then move on with your life.
---
But a rogue replacement costs 0s 0c!
---
Personally, i love the swagger of a whole raid/guild grouping up and dropping a dragon head and then all porting/hearthing to their raid with the whole city sending them off.  It makes everyone really focus and bring their A game to preserve the buffs for the group.
---
Old rules are tank then healer then dps.

Tank goes first as has huge repair bills in classic.

Thanks for the info

It was night and day difference with the threat per second TPS this druid would do compared to the warrior tanks.... our DPS did not have to hold back and could burn bosses  a lot faster because of it.

If topping dps charts in some raids is all you care about, I would say you missing the point of this game.
---
Actually what that means is that if you raid towards the later timezones on your server (like a westcoaster on an NA server) you will have to account share to ever get buffs, unless you save them from the weekend.
---
no changes
---
If by start slower, you are referring to the leveling experience, then you couldn't be more wrong. Warlocks are top tier levels.

All that Hunter experience and he still doesn’t know how to play a Hunter. Classic Huntard, folks.
---
I’m sure the mage recuperated the portal cost during the dungeon.
---
1. In duels, you choose the terrain. That means there are no hills or walls or other obstacles that prevent you from kiting. 
---
2. In duels, there are also no mobs you can agro which can daze you, giving you a great disadvantage.  Since as a hunter you are the one who does the kiting, you have a much greater chance of aggroing a mob, than the person chasing you.
---
3. As a hunter you have to worry about: Your health, your mana, your pet being alive, your pet's happiness. That is more things than other classes, which is a disadvantage in an unprepared scenario such as world pvp. In duels these effects are not present, since you can prepare all you want.  
---
These 3 points describe that there are disadvantages for hunters in world pvp compared to dueling.
---
I'm not saying it's the same. The point is that where is the line? Farming shards and having to fill your bags with them is a pain in the ass that adds no benefit to the game that letting them stack to 5 would take away. And I say that as someone who doesn't/won't play lock and has never farmed a soul shard in my life.
---
Let's say buff acquisition is a 10/10 on the pain in the ass scale, and soul shards are a 5. It's easy to say just change the 10 and not the 5. But what about something that is a 9? or and 8? Where does Blizz draw the line? I certainly don't think the game is better with the buffs being the way they are, but there are plenty of things about Vanilla that I don't think make a better game.
---
And?
---
Yeah, that AdministrativeZebra is an ass
---
&gt; At that point, why are you bothering with full consumes nonstop to clear MC/BWL? Its the same logic, why spend all that extra time on wasted consumes for content that's piss easy
---
That is exactly what you do as a ret paladin, to do a fraction of the DPS of a warrior. As you said, if you don't min/max consumes on a paladin, your dps is terrible. Well, your DPS is terrible either way, but still.   
---
You say you took a deep dive into the raiding scene, but did you actually play as a ret? The DPS is god awful.
---
If you're the healer, people won't have a problem if you roll on cloth with +healing.
---
People *will* have a problem if you roll on cloth with +damage and healing, though.
---
To humans, the natural state is abhorrent, and should be replaced by civilization. Progress is good, magic/science (the engines of progress) are also grand. 
---
You can actually see this dichotomy across all the race/class combos. The progress oriented humans, gnomes, and undead can all play mage/warlock, but get locked out of hunter. The tradition oriented tauren, trolls, orcs, dwarves, and night elves can plan hunter. 
---
The two stand outs are orc warlock, and troll mage. Warlock makes sense given the orcs recent history until very recently, demons were literally in their blood. Trolls, on the other hand, are an interesting case because they've struck a balance between the natural and the arcane. Unlike the night elves, they didn't have a civilization definin
---
By writing " Any sort of HC raiding or PVP " I meant Any sort of HC raiding or HC PVP. I do have experience in casual PVP. I am sorry if the wording was not obvious to you, I will edit that part.
---
Nah, I mean as far as power scaling goes. 
---
I feel like Warlocks are a little weaker from T0.5, then really start getting insane somewhere around T2 or right after that.
---
Literally on the first Vanilla AND first TBC clip you posted with Rogue vs. Warrior there is no observable "leeway behavior" that is being discussed here. There is a very clear and distinct range at which the attacks stop hitting both directions, \*that does not fluctuate one way or another whether the targets are moving or not\*. AND is much shorter than what is observable in many clips being posted regarding this issue.
---
If you watch some of the clips provided in other comments, a very good demonstration being [this](https://www.twitch.tv/norththemage/clip/AssiduousAmericanHyenaArsonNoSexy?filter=clips&amp;range=7d&amp;sort=time) one, the behavior is notably different. Auto attacks have this "rubber-banding" effect is what I like to call it.
---
And the ranges in your clips are not nearly 7-8 yards. The range in the clip I posted is around 8 yards. There is a notable difference.
---
There is clearly leeway mechanic that was implemented way after Cataclysm present in Beta.
---
Feral is for stealth killing bosses. Specifically BRD is pretty easy, even while in terrible gear.
---
Pet classes do have the advantage though as you said.
---
It seems very greedy to charge your group mates for a portal. I get random ones people ask for but not that.
---
*Orc Shaman pops Reincarnate and Frost Shocks you from behind.
---
Sure you can dream up scenarios where you might take a ret over some rogue that refuses to respec. But, if you are in a guild with players of a similar level, that just won't happen very often.  You are basically assuming your guild will have bad players, or attendance issues.
---
Mages CAN depending on the terrain. They have to use/abuse terrain for kiting.
---
Same but in wrath without down ranking.
---
We would stand on the Org bank and spam heals until we went oom. Good times.
---
I think I’m vanilla this is true. But now people know how good warriors are. There will be 10X the amount this time around.
---
&gt;If we didn't have a decade+ of Vanilla server launches with gated content to use as a metric
---
It's simply not true. I think the first private server ever to release honor system without BGs was opened in the end of 2017. They've always staggered raids but never BGs (or items, before Nost anyway).

The real WPT is always in the comments.

Good post OP, I particularly liked your idea on changing what buffs stack, to force players have to make decisions on which buffs they want to bring to a raid.
---
I dont think it will matter though. People wont take your word or the words of others. Most people haven't experienced Vanilla in 13-14 years or never and want to have an experience exactly like Vanilla untarnished by any revelations that have been discovered since then with zero exemptions. I understand the sentiment well since if one thing is changed, why not others.
---
People will come to the same conclusion to your post eventually, but it will take time. At some point during a lull (maybe after bwl and before aq), after clearing MC for the 30th time and bwl for the 20th, people will start to really question the fact of how happy they are spending 3-4 hours prepping for every raid. 
---
Many will argue "My guild wont require them", and sure, you may be right. But when you see other people walking around with Rag loot or Nef loot day 1 of release of that content, while you're still struggling on other bosses, you will probably reconsider. When you see friends clearing farm content in 2 hours and think back to your last BWL run that took 5 hours across 2 raid nights to clear for your 20th run, you will probably reconsider. 
---
It's easy to argue against it because sitting on your chair now, watching people play beta on Twitch, all you want to do is play Classic. "I don't mind having to play a game I love more to either get the buffs, or take longer doing the raids". But a year from now, when you've cleared everything 30+ times, you will realize that due to world buffs, you have wasted hundreds of hours either farming  buffs, or spent those extra hours in raids compared to people that kept their buffs and finished faster than you.
---
Reddit doesn't like taking advice. Groupthink causes people to hear no evil until they see it firsthand. Testers complained about things in BfA beta and reddit ignored it. Once they experienced it firsthand, we got where we're at today. The same will happen in Classic. The overarching hivemind mentality right now is "Streamers are bad and Classic will be amazing" nothing else is allowed. Give it a month into Classic and you'll start seeing posts like "Vanilla isnt my kind of flavor, but I see why I other people like it, have fun." Then 2-3 months later you'll see outright hostility.
---
Sorry for the rant, getting tired of the reddit circle of life if you haven't noticed.
---
lol...I did get a "This guy is a Troll" vibe but hey it's the internet people are braver when there's no actual interaction involved
---
I need the money more than them.  They'd just spend it on something stupid like portals.
---
Which is basically what op asked. You can easily kill almost all bosses as feral
---
Right, it's a meer'r.
---
You're just making it clear you havn't played tank dude.
---
You didn't even talk about the night you got it lol.
---
Mind soothe doesn’t work that way. It reduces mob aggro radius, not PC attack range.
---
How do you kite a boss that cant be slowed in a closed arena type encounter?
---
As long as you can survive shifting and popping a heal or two on yourself yes. The only thing is your mana will become an issue over time.
---
I see! Thanks for the information!
---
While the only paladins I expect to see will be lying face down under me while I drink, I can confirm that I have no issues sharing cloth healing gear with main spec healers, regardless of their armor allowances for their class.
---
Esfand is a real man's man. And by that I mean I love him 😍
---
I get it but are you actually being a hybrid in this scenario besides providing buffs? Your basically tanking the whole time
---
Is it pronounced tomato or tomato?
---
Take a look at the raid tier sets and play a Warlock.
---
How is this a cheat?
---
Why do you think noone will be able to fill raids with proper specced players?
---
 I'd suggest two things. First, formulate a plan for the professions you'd like to have while leveling. Personally, I'm going to go with two gathering professions to give me a leg up in terms of gold gain while grinding to 60. From there you'll want to think about what you want for your end goal. Your end goal may also dictate which gathering professions you choose to start out with (if you go that route).  
---
Alternatively you could go herb/alch and get that out of the way to alleviate pot/flask costs. Anything works!

"Its obviously a joke" 
---
I dont know man have you ever played EQ
---
I don't think I am spreading misinformation, but I am happy to change my mind about a couple things if you state sufficient counter points.
---
Rape joke, racist joke, statutory rape joke.  Classy
---
Casual ;)
---
So I would not go 3) since in classic you can only track 1 resource at the time.
---
My thoughts on 1) leatherworking is nice and all but only really gives you pre raid items (which can help a lot to get in a Raid). during the raid you will be needed for Onyxia cloaks, and a few valuable skinning. However I think there will be quite a few rouges doing that (or they all go Engineering for PvP)
---
As for 2) alchemy is always a good choice, you have a cool down which is always needed and sought after. If you have herbs left you can sell them since everybody is going to need them. (Or sell the potions...)
---
But it heavily dependents on you willingness to farm.
---
Closet or not, they could definitely portal people off the edge - i portal people off the rocks in hellfire all the time - and in the instance they didn't fall off the rock, they were stranded if they didn't have flying.
---
TBC was great.

Welcome to the internet?

Shamans don't only have 1 spec either: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja1j7xWpB3w

Here is a raid log breakdown, note that this is MORE diverse than usual. LOL.
---
You're being asinine about the 'definition' of the word 'harder' using one of MANY definitions you decided to pick.
---
&gt;Difficult to understand or solve.
---
There actually was a LFD tool added in during TBC. You still had to physically run to the dungeon though.
---
Wait, so does that means it's a poke-your-mom or digimon?
---
We're not just borrowing from French, though. The Normans came over and our language was never the same afterward.
---
We don't just have our own pronunciations of French words, we have our own definitions, too :)
---
apparently you do need it because this is the barrens...
---
We were &lt;Thundering Pantload&gt;. After having that name for a few years Blizzard forced us to change it.  So we renamed &lt;Panting Thunderload&gt;.
---
In a min/max guild, you realistically won't be running 8/8 T2 because there's more important debuffs. 
---
If you're less serious about raiding though, it can get really interesting if you have multiple full T2 hunters. On [current biggest pserver which I can't name because of sub rules], AFAIK there can't be multiple instances of the buff up at the same time, which lead to the meta of having only 1 hunter running full T2 and having the others run full T1 or something for more raw damage+benefitting from the proc.
---
It stacked [in vanilla](https://youtu.be/MS71t-aWAMw?t=138) though.
---
It's pushing me much more in the direction of the single target build for launch, especially considering the competition even if it was working as it did in Vanilla. But yeah you can have your hands full even with just a few Melee mobs. Especially before cone of cold.
---
Even back then it's not like every fought every time... you can pvp or you can ignore eachother, it's a normal thing..

Hard to make a CE for a free game.  You just need a sub.

Please provide a source
---
Yeah but aren't you like 30?
---
You gots one of them chappy-ass hats?

Instead of adding in some separate programming logic, just make the worldbuffs themselves undispelable debuffs. Easy peasy.

Dire Maul West Tendris Warpwood (tree boss). There's the sides of the room, which has brutal mob pathing. You can jump on the ledge and the boss walks up to you, jump off, and the boss has to walk all the way to the bottom and around to get to you. You can then jump back on the ledge and repeat for eternity.
---
This also happens in Dire Maul North, the final boss has this kind of pathing (but mostly used for groups for the healer to kite the caster add)
---
Much older than that... Dont you have somewhere else you you can go and be boring?
---
you seem salty
---
i hope someone wipes your raid buffs right outside the instance
---
That's true, but it also took a pretty damn long time for that ring &amp; weapon to become obsolete for a lot of people, IIRC.
---
You know damn well blizzard would have 86'd this shit, if it had became the meta in 2005.  You are just exploiting to trivialize the already trivialized game.  It's kind of sad and pathetic really.

Can you recommend the Side, race and build? Gender makes no difference, I hope - but I installed and tried the current version client meanwhile, and that hunter girl of the blue race is pure sex, her voice especially.

Well there is ample supply of videos at the moment in this very thread that work towards proving this melee leeway behavior was not present in Vanilla and TBC era.

I also played extensively during these times as well as in WotLK and Cata, and I have very distinct memory of the behavior with kiting ranges during these times. This is something very different (I have not played after Cata, at which point the melee leeway was introduced AND announced as well).
---
But I will say that memory is not a valid proof of anything here, so that point IS moot from my part. But the videos do not lie. And also patch notes do not lie, or at least we should be able to trust them. Melee leeway was added way later as a mechanic with its own patch note.
---
And since the beta client is based on the WoD client architecture, there is a very plausible case for this much more modern retail behavior having slipped into the beta client.
---
&gt; having respec cost out-price the average player from switching specs with any frequency.
---
I actually do think this is really good for the game. A good money sink and it makes your talent spec matter. If I could lock people **permanently** into talent specs, I would.
---
I am here for the Masses, comment appreciated
---
"It's the internet so racism, rape and statutory rape is ok!" - Your logic.
---
You have to consider most of us in beta are 2004 players. We were around for the community days, I’d wager the majority of BFA players either weren’t around or have forgotten the ways. Beta is not necessarily an accurate representation of what live servers will feel like.

I am. Grow up.

It’s okay to have an opinion. Just don’t state it as if it’s fact. It’s not.
---
Purepwnage was better
---
Fuck that, attack them. FIGHT FOR HONOR!!!
---
My expectations aren't particularly high. I want to tank and at some point I want to do it i a Raid. If that's a Raid full of twinks, what the heck, I don't care^^
---
Faction and Race is personal. Gender aswell.
---
For the average player Race makes no diffrence and with your main goal of being a farmer it doesn't matter. Hardcore PvE or hardcore PvPer have there "best" picks but just play what you think looks best.
---
You can pick between Nightelf, Dwarf, Tauren, Troll or Orc.
---
Great work!  Love that people are using their time efficiently while waiting for vanilla! :)
---
No, no changes having your head over your shoulder 24/7 brings in immersion and makes the gameplay more engaging! If you don’t like it play a PVE server
---
Boy, what an absolutely breathtaking loading screen.
---
Can you link to information about this build?
---
Not if everyone keeps ganging up on her, calling for her head.
---
&gt;I want to try it as SM/ruin and see if SL is enough sustain.
---
Isn't "SL" soul link and not a skill you'd have with SM/Ruin? is there a diff "SL" I'm not thinking of?
---
Hey Molgrim, nice to see somebody from my old server, we probably fought some matches in BG against each other. I totally forgot, maybe you remember who got R14 on Horde side on ZdC? Kriton? Pekahe? I have no clue, I can't remember or did just nobody get it back then?
---
Doubt you remember but I played a Orc Warrior named Kretak.
---
Hunter tier 1! Just because I think it looks cool! After that we’ll see.
---
Did something similar related to WoW Classic a couple of weeks ago, didn’t really work sadly
---
so u like world buffs? xD
---
&gt;Lastly, worldbuffs breed a speciel type of toxicity which I haven't experienced anywhere else in my years of gaming. Nothing will prepare you for the unmitigated salt of getting purged of your worldbuffs which you spent hours getting and days logged out for. When the MT dies to Vaelastrasz and the entire raid is threatcapped for the rest of the instance, fun times ensue. World PvP? People dedicate entire raidnights and ambushes just to strip the opposition of their buffs and making the instance they are about to run 2x harder and longer. If you are a DPS and you lose your buffs early you can just go brain AFK and mash your buttons - no way in hell will anyone be able to tell the difference on meters because you have 0 chance of keeping up. And last but not least, you can wipe 10 times in a night due to player mistakes, but I guarantee you people will only remember the first person which fucked up and stripped everyone's buffs.
---
this is actually my primary motivation to playing classic
---
i absolutely *cannot wait* to make people have to play the game on "normal mode" instead of easy. the unmitigated salt over being stopped from trying to trivialize a 15-year old with very simple mechanics is such a huge motivator for me.
---
i *will* be arranging buff-spoiling groups on my server. possibly scheduled weekly to follow the big guilds. i fully expect this to result in emergent meta and very interesting social dynamics in the server community.
---
People should assume you’re getting healing gearbox if you join the group as heals. However, while you shouldn’t expect to be allowed to roll on DPS gear, you can ask if you can roll for X piece when you join, and confirm with the group that it’s okay. 
---
Example: LFM SM Lib/Armory - need heals! /whisper: Hey, I can heal for you, but I’d like to be able to roll for Ravager... is that cool?
---
Either nobody in the group needs it and they say yes, or the one or two people who do need it let you roll for it anyways because they’ve been waiting 15 mins for a healer and just want to go already. OR, they flatly tell you “no”, and it’s your choice to find another group, make your own, or just tag along anyways without a shot on Ravager. 
---
Just have a little bit of tact and courtesy. Most of the time, even if you’re not tank or heals, it doesn’t hurt to ask the leader or the group if you can roll on something you want.
---
Because people like to plan ahead?
---
We already know the Vanilla timeline, what's after that? Progress to TBC? Create new content? What? 
---
It is probably going to be 3 years for the timeline for classic most likely, I think a slower progression might be better. There's going to be a ton of players who never experienced classic, and we don't want to rush those players as gear is so much more of a necessity.
---
I like how you decided to completely ignore my example and just call it 'stupid' and provide no elaboration or reasoning of merit.
---
I guess I should just do the same then.
---
YOUR example is stupid.The lack of difficulty in Classic will be understood by ANYONE who will play it, the moment they play with anyone who isn't mentally handicapped.
---
huehue.
---
The rest of your post is just nonsense.
---
Having to fight 1-2 mobs at a time while casting one/two spell and using your wand because of how regen after 5 works isn't challenging...unless you are challenged.
---
&gt;The difficulty of Classic is on par or harder than Retail.
---
&gt;99% of the Retail content can be done by stupidly bad players.
---
This is just a snuck premise. 
---
You call levelling "99%" of wow content, and/or consider it content AFTER you are vastly overgearing it. This is STUPID.
---
Heroic dungeons are hard (relative to vanilla) at the start of an expansion, and m0 goes far beyond the difficulty of vanilla instances.
---
Heroic raiding is already harder than vanilla raiding up to maybe Naxx. At which point mythic is just vastly more challenging.
---
On top of that, all of the vanilla raids (up to naxx) are tuned so that you can have multiple/many players in your raid performing sub par / non optimal etc.
---
Mythic raiding doesn't allow anywhere even close to that degree of slack. Even heroic (while relevant content and not overgeared/nerfed) won't for a guild that doesn't have mythic skilled players.
---
&gt; Retail is far more easier, because IT IS DESIGNED for bad players.
---
Actually, it's the opposite. Vanilla is designed and balanced for bad players... because everyone was (relatively) bad when they first played it, and advanced mechanics like raids have now simply werent possible.
---
It's not even worth responding to the rest.
---
If she just calms down and takes a deep breath...
---
Don’t take damage gear and don’t take spirit gear off priests. Other than that people won’t mind.
---
&gt; shave seconds off kills in their speed runs 
---
An entire raid having like 20% more hp and 20% more damage is "shaving seconds" now? Come on, dude.
---
Never even heard of the place.  Do you even WoW bro?
---
This is exactly how i feel about wPvP right now!!!
---
Just two minutes will do.
---
I always LOVED and still LOVE the boats and trams. They make the world feel so much bigger and alive. Wish they did more with that haha
---
&gt;  It's kind of sad and pathetic really. 
---
But being so upset about it to name call isnt... you are calling the kettal black mate.
---
&gt; You are just exploiting to trivialize the already trivialized game.
---
Exploit -  to make productive use of  - Marriam/Websters
---
Sorry if playing the game pisses you off lol... what should I be doing? Do I sit in org and do nothing to please thy lord, as anything else would be so tryhard it made me pathetic?
---
People have mixed opinions on this. From a large portion of the fanbase, TBC is where WoW peaked. Others WOTLK was where things peaked.
---
We need to look forward as to what is going to happen next.
---
That first login about to be magic
---
Well it’s be much better to tell them you’re rolling on DPS gear... *before* you start.
---
&gt;  If I could lock people permanently into talent specs, I would.
---
Why? What benefit does that add to the game? Why is someone who tanks for their raid group wanting to do some BGs on the weekend as a DPS spec a bad thing for the game?
---
If you /need your expected to equip the item because you need it. That's the protocols for every class.

As OP replied to you, I chime in. I remember having these "He is not even close!" moments. The key here is, that was never consistent behavior. It happened at whiles and then you could do exact same things you did and you would NOT get that "weirdly long Hamstring".
---
THAT is lag. Leeway is consistently replicate-able behavior of attacks having much longer range when both targets are moving. And that is happening in the beta currently. [This](https://www.twitch.tv/norththemage/clip/AssiduousAmericanHyenaArsonNoSexy?filter=clips&amp;range=7d&amp;sort=time) video is a very good demonstration of what is going on.

Godlike CC, utility and sustain reliably made a mockery of Warrior/Pally's 1-trick tank-n-spank strat. Theorycraft warriors like to tell themselves that 'locks, being clothies, are squishy - but really all they'd doing is revealing that they're carebears who only ever fought their raid-spec'd buddies in gurubashi.

You know how long it takes to find a group as DPS in classic? You certainly don't want to be kicked from an almost rtg group.
---
Yeah, let's all calculate and charge fees for all our skills because you know, that's how we build a friendly community. *clap*
---
"Joking about something and being accepting of something is the same" - Your logic.

Everything you just listed is entirely the hunter's fault if it happens. If the hunter has an IQ higher than the single digits, then they are able to prevent every single one of your points.
---
I get that hunters have the "huntard" stereotype but it'd be nice if you didn't assume we're all braindead.
---
Yeah, generally a tank healer would be like "ima roll on dps gear fyi" and the party would be like "aight" otherwise you're looking for a replacement which could take a while.

Because this is a fantasy game and it doesn’t matter.

wowhead is pulling the alakazham and thottbot data for comments so i'm pretty sure they were correct for most of the info in classic.  just have to put up with spyware adds.
---
I'm not sure why ret still gets so much hate, some things don't change i guess. With 20 points in holy you are a good support class that can offheal and you have the possibility of dealing strong burst damage, probably have to have engineering to improve the stun lock. 
---
Finding room for a decent mana pool to be able to throw heals and damage is hard though, i was in field marshal armor with bits and pieces from BWL and AQ40 and did okay vs pretty much any class in duels. Maybe the meta has changed a lot now but I remember even though you can get reset if you manage CD's can force blinks and a geared mage could die from ret burst, you make it sound like the paladin will never ever reach the mage.

Just want to share these from the beta for how it currently works. As you can see in the 2nd clip ping plays absolutely no role in this mechanic. https://clips.twitch.tv/AmazonianBlatantAlfalfaPanicVis https://clips.twitch.tv/ConsiderateFitLionRitzMitz
---
But you couldn't do this in vanilla and that is reason enough. Blizzard has commited to bringing vanilla back as close to how it was as they can.
---
Not sure what other people are going to say, but I really disagree with the healer not being able to roll on +damage/healing 5mans.  There aren't that many items that are just +healing.  The +damage/healing will also have int for healing, seems fair to roll on.
---
Obviously based on the amount of comments people think it matters a bit \^.\^
---
\#nochanges 
---
if i remember correctly most if not all these buffs are gone on the first wipe. Which means they aren't really that great for raiding new content, and they aren't needed for content you have on farm status.  I don't recall anyone really ever taking world buff seriously outside of saving their ony and nef heads  for the next raid night.

---
you want me to skip rugby? or do you wanna play when i get home?
---
..so your advice is to be a ninja so others don't ninja you. Yeah, that's great for everyone...
---
The informal rule has always been to need what is an upgrade for you in the role you are playing. Being selfish and needing anything you can equip is just worse for everyone.
---
Warlock's 5p and 8p T2 are laughable. First some nonsense to your pet. Then reduced threat - in a set with such poor stats that you're never pulling threat.
---
T1 is quite awful too but can at least be useful-ish in PvP.
---
He's right, but it was fixed like 2 weeks ago.
---
Had zero idea what I was doing and farmed the whole set on my priest for the + shadow damage 4 piece bonus lol
---
Aye.
---
In my case, this behavior strikes me as very odd, as I stopped WoW completely after Cata. Have not played a single minute since then, but I clocked literally thousands of hours during Vanilla, TBC, WotLK and Cata. And I cannot remember this behavior at all during those times.
---
But memory is not a valid proof of anything here with this subject. But the videos do not lie. I hope this will get fixed :)
---
Can you powerlevel on launch? (Hit 60 in a week or 2). If you do that, then go back to your normal schedule, you should do just fine.
---
Yea but the only reason people seem to want it, is to use it as a tool to greif others.
---
Yeah that's what I meant that you get more damaged fighting higher level mobs.
---
It sounds like you only want games to have politics you agree with? Boy stealing girl's toy = OK, but girl stealing boy's toy = not OK?
---
The 1.12 change has it positives and negatives, positive shorter queue times for Av instead of queueing and waiting for multiple hours. Negative, it’s not a true vanilla experience as AV was one of the longest BGs with all the fighting in fields of strife and turtles going on for hours. 
---
I can see both sides of this argument, I would like to see them use the true vanilla version for a time so people get to experience it and then change it. But in the end it’s up to Blizzard how this will all play out.
---
If I’m not mistaken, this also has a big impact on tanking. 
---
I don’t know if this is still the case but back the in the day when a tank wanted to move the boss but had to worry about breath, swipes, cleave, etc. we would inch closer to the boss. At a certain distance, all mobs and bosses try to correct themselves. The huge benefit this provided for tanks was that, even though the boss would move themselves, their hit box remained point at the target of their threat. So tanks were able to move dangerous bosses without putting the raid at risk. 
---
For positionally sensitive fights, this was a required tactic to master for hardcore raiding. 
---
TLDR: this change could substantially effect how bosses are tanked in classic.
---
pve servers lul
---
The informal rule (at least on alliance EU side) has always been to roll need on any upgrades for your for the role you play. If it's not an upgrade or for a different role you don't need. You can, however, also roll need for items that are an upgrade for your other spec but ONLY if nobody else in the party actually needs it.
---
I think we have a differing option of what a "well known claim" is. Don't know why you attacked me, if you were downvoted it has little to do with me. I'm sure complaining about it helps though.
---
Wish they'd do away with world buffs in raids, imo.
---
It just wasn't worth the risk in the eyes of any raid leader I've ever played with.
---
the only common denominator in all those groups is that you were in them.  you could just be an asshole driving players away from your groups.
---
Sometimes they just get reported enough.
---
This. Seriously having all the number buttons by your thumb makes things so much easier, no more stretching to hit shift and the number 9 on the keyboard, it will drastically improve your play once you get used to the mouse
---
Lol its just a bit sad is all.  I thought people outgrew rape jokes but I guess theres a certain demographic that never does.
---
Anywhere along the edge of Feralas that meets the ocean.
---
&gt; Find better players
---
His whole point is that good players will be attracted to more serious guilds with more tryhardy practices, meaning either he does this cancerous tryhard bullshit or he plays with retards who allow him not to.  
---
Finding semicasual pros is difficult.
---
eyeroll.
---
My advice is roll need on all items you need. I remember people trying to do stupid “greed” rolls for the whole party and some ass rogue would roll need last on your healing staff guaranteeing he gets the item even with a 99.
---
Good guy,have a upvote
---
so he can trolololol on people in their pve spec
---
Warlock 5p bonus for T1 and T2 was a total joke. Similarly the 3p from AQ20 had a similar Resist and Damage bonus to summoned minions. 
---
I always contemplating using the 5p, AQ set and the Black Book and trying to beef up a pet but never tried.
---
Imagine being the person who put up the linen for 1000g as a joke though and then they come back to their mailbox the next day :)
---
Crank view distance all the way up and go to the top of the watch tower at the Crossroads would probably be a decent view if you like that open plains vista.
---
&gt; So, is it a clever use of game mechanics or an exploit bug ?
---
Clever use of course. Pathing has always been this way. Mobs can't jump down, they have to move around.
---
I personally think the way it's being done is fine. I see all the problems you mention but I think you're exaggerating as well. If your guild had the main tank go first on vael, that was a bad decision. 
---
Considering the timers, I just say not as many guilds need to be such try-hards. Until naxx, you don't need to be so obsessed with everyone having all buffs all the time. I always get into "laid back" guilds that just wanna have fun and then 3 or 4 of the officers become buff-nazis and want to double the amount of time needed to raid just so to wipe and everyone lose their buffs. Then come to find out we can still make progress despite that. I say if it's the same thing just a bigger pain in the ass for try-hards then GOOD. FUCK EM! I'll still enjoy raiding.. I'll still enjoy the game..
---
Nope, IIRC it counts as a [suicide](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Suicide).
---
The sheer consumable cost of running Naxx was absolutely brutal. Unless you’re in a hardcore guild, it’s unlikely you will see it as most hardcore guilds without new content will quit and stop running it.
---
It’s just not even worth doing. Sorry.
---
I can’t tell if your trolling or being serious. I’m going to assume your trolling on layering because your butthurt about it and that your not just slow.
---
I don't think people assume they're all braindead, they just play the odds and would prefer not to risk it. 
---
Especially considering even if you send your pet in, there's a good chance it's going to go down from AoE in any serious encounter extremely fast.
---
This is gold lol
---
I just got to a random Playlist in yt,heard evanescence wake me up - instantly imagined rogue vanilla PvP
---
I'd like to see proof of people being able to spellbatch on songflowers on beta because I really don't remember this being a thing in real vanilla.  But it could be we just didn't know you could do it.
---
These guys are hilarious. They seemed to have really figured out how to write in orcish so that allies get the message lol. The clips with Josh were so funny. 
---
On a sidenote, i think what they are doing is the the best what you can do in big wpvp fights. Cut the resource lines, add some tasty bm to it and voila
---
I think it's safe to assume that a holy pally would roll on non plate healing gear.  First of all the itemization sucks so there isn't even that much healing plate anyways, second there's no bonus for wearing plate so some of the best healing equipment you can get won't be plate anyways.  If anything is an upgrade for your role you should be able to roll without asking.
---
For DPS though, you should definitely ask the group if you are going to roll on a melee weapon while healing.  As a healer they would hopefully be ok with it since you are needed.
---
Says someone who wants classic because BFA is too easy. Oh please.  
---
None of us are here for the casual experience. If there's a ton of worldbuffs available that'll double my strength, I'm a dumbass if I opt out.
---
The numbers don't add up. Yes things can work on private servers and as "blizzlike" as they try to be, they aren't true to form.
---
Consumables are going to be harder to get for one. So blowing hundreds of gold per raid just to compete is going to be a lot harder.
---
As myself, going feral, I am fully expecting to be healing a ton of the time. My guild wants me as feral, and they are few and far between.
---
RDruids are still in demand, are usually the lest played class, so play whatever style you prefer. You can find a guild as a druid, and raid as a druid.
---
Unstuck uses your Hearthstone if it's off cd.
---
I tried to do rfc on the stress test. As far as I know most of the players in my group was pretty new to classic itself. We wiped over and over again and people still stuck around. I had to leave after a while but in my mind they kept chugging along for a while.
---

I'd imagine they have hard data on this, and won't listen to the vocal minority of people no-lifing the game as a result.
---
that's the thing.
---
there's no honor in 2v1.
---
there's no honor in attacking someone 10 lvl lower.
---
there's no honor in attacking someone that's already at half health with a mob on top of him.
---
basically, it's pretty darn rare to have any honorable fight in WPvP... which  people eventually realize ( or reroll rogue ) and hence BG popularity.

People did not avoid AV because of poor rewards.  I remember people leaving raids because AV finally popped for them.  For many people AV was the most important (read: fun) thing in the game.

For pre-bis you I would say you should have more than 1 option for each, many people won't run strat 50x times for the chance at a random enchant drop, and would like to see some options that don't hurt too much.

Male of female? If the answer was either or doesn't matter go dwarf. Be unique go Female Dwarf paladin and crush everything. Go with the twin braids so when you heal in raids with it those bitches will be twirling in the fucking wind. It is wonderful 10/10 would recommend.
---
Agree, I hope they monitor the population for number of people at 60, number of daily logins and number of guilds who have completed raids to determine when to drop the next phase. I'm hopeful they don't rush it.
---
* 57-58 Alliance Hunter page 16 &amp; 17 Western Plaguelands is referred to as "EPL"  
---
* Also, when a new chapter is started, is it possible you could link/show which pre-quests carries over from previous chapters? So that people have a chance to catch up to the current point in the guide, because i started using it arround level 35-40ish, and it was rather hard getting into the guide at that point, because I didn't know which quests i was supposed to have/have done at that point. It would probably also be a good thing for people to check, if they have picked up all the quests they should've throughout the guide, as they're flying/riding to the new zone anyway.
---
Mine is &lt;hangin in a tree&gt; and then me and my friends named our chars tomatoes, apples, and so on. A really bad joke
---
World buff smuggling is always a growing problem in the streets of azeroth.
---
Ultimately I do hope they run statistics that allow them to do data gathering.
---
Queries like:
---
1. How many level 60s have set foot in MC
---
2. How many level 60s have downed Rag
---
3. Average profession ranking for level 60s
---
4. Etc.
---
However, they have stated they will be open with the community. I feel 6 months for each phase is pretty good. We’ll be sitting at 3 years until post-Naxx becomes a thing, which gives them plenty of time to roll out BC or Classic plus
---
So as a hunter the group must pay me for the arrows, or I will go melee for the rest of the dungeon?
---
There was only 20 months between vanilla launch and the release of naxx.  18 seema about right considering raids are all theory crafted and known entities.
---
yeah but the min-maxers are toxic and thye cant just play the game and enjoy it.
---
Stuff like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRRpChEtZrQ
---
No warlock is going to farm up an entire collection of shards for the raid night, on top of farming up an entire collection of shards for summoning the majority of a raid, JUST IN CASE a rival guild is outside pvp'ing. 
---
They couldn't summon in instances before, they shouldn't be able to now, but don't add some dumb half baked reason about why it would mess up world PVP.
---
You're welcome to get but I'm kicking anyone who gets out damaged by the tank or the healer.  As long as you're above that you do you brother.
---
Working as intended
---
They all where... Lol
---
At some point, someone saw it and thought "That's sexist. Let's make the girl take the toy" and to that, I say Shiiiiiiiiiiit that's some sjw shit.
---
20 months with no-lifing was still rough back in the day. I wish this time they’ll slow it down a little so we can savor it before it’s over.
---
Once you make roll out the next phase, that meta from T1, MC, and Ony is gone forever.
---
Mediablitz did. He was our OT.. we got a sever 2nd Cthun with him on Akama US&gt; he usually was cat forming trash, while our warrior/shaman was DPS tanking, and only bear beared and would swap to caster to toss out a heal or two.
---
I tried farming the chicken skulls on my warlock way back in the day. Never got it to drop.... after 76 runs I gave up. (I still have my notepad where I was keeping track)
---
i mean, yeah, just tell them you're rolling on the Intellect gear because you're a healer. it's not really that big of a deal.
---
For Stormgrade, it's less a castle and more of a fortified settlement/city ala Stormwind, Capital City, Stratholme, etc. The "Stormgarde Keep" you see on your map and when you zone in is most likely referring to the actual keep building in the center of the city.
---
For Durnholde, it was considered a "prison-fortress" before it fell into ruin, so I guess this could be called a castle. But, there might have been an effort on the lord's part to make a distinction to separate the lord's house from the prison, since if you take away the internment camps, the only buildings left are the keep and a tower.
---
For Nethergarde, as it appears in WoW, yes it's a castle, no doubt about that. But that might have been an oops on the WoW level designer's part, since Nethergarde Keep was first described in the RPG handbook Lands of Conflict, which actually described a proper keep.
---
For Tiragarde, yeah, that's a castle town, but like Nethergarde, I wonder how much of this is more the fault of the WoW level designers, since Tiragarde Keep was supposed to be a hastily constructed beachfront for the Kul Tirans, which would make more sense to set up a keep instead of a whole castle. 
---
For Stonewatch, well, I don't know why you included this one, since the only part that is referred to as the "keep" is just the keep structure. The entire complex (walls, keep and tower) is simply referred to as "Stonewatch".
---
Yes, make this a thing
---
Not only have I played EQ, I played the watered down garbage console version of EQ for the playstation 2. 
---
This isn't me btw: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PckWMDXSU6M
---
I appreciate the feedback! Nice to hear the opinion of someone who has raiding experience.
---
That said, I don't think you directly countered my points (with a couple exceptions), but rather added additional information.  
---
" For one, Hunter's are wPvP kings alongside Rogues. " - Do you disagree with my opinion that aggroing mobs and blocking terrain are a disadvantage for hunters? Keep in mind, I didn't say hunters were bad at world pvp, I said these two things are disadvantages. Maybe you interpreted it as me saying hunter suck at wpvp, but that was a misinterpretation on your part.  
---
" While it may be true that they're going to be ideal in mass PvP and solo(duels)/world pvp, they are honestly great in small (wsg/AB) pvp match ups as well " - I mostly agree with this part, but I meant "smaller fights" as 2v2,3v3 or 4v4 or fights like that. I did not mean it as 'fight in the smaller BGs', but rather smaller, segregated fights where you can't really hide in the crowd, thus getting focused easier. I stand by my point about being focused.  Hunters are indeed well equipped with disengaging abilities, but not well enough to prevent gapclosing against multiple enemies. If that happens, you are stuck in close range, and in that case hunter do worse than other classes and it can also feel really frustrating. I never said that the problem is that you die if you are focused.  
---
About pet happiness- Maybe you don't think it is a big deal, but it can be annoying for new players (who are the target of this post). Our opinions about pet happiness can differ, but its existence is a fact which I think if useful to point out to potential new players.
---
About the deadzone - I completely agree with you. The deadzone is one of the things that increase the skillcap and the depth of a hunter (I said these in the post), thus making mastering them feel rewarding, but it can be a major annoyance for new players, thus good to point out too.  
---
About dungeons - I agree about reputation and item competition, but I still think that other classes are better at CC than a hunter. Mages are better in both CC and snaring, and for example the succubus kiss is a far more reliable form of CC than a hunter's freezing trap. Remember, I never said hunter sucked at CC. I said others were better than him, thus greatly lowering the demand for a hunter in dungeons.  
---
About raids - I have no raiding experience (I stated this), that's why the post is missing a part about raiding.
---
I'm open for a discussion/debate, but with all my respect, I expect much much much more after beginning your reply with discrediting my entire post in brutally huge letters.
---
mobility..Druid!
---
Sounds like you’d fit as a NE hunter tbh. You get stealth snipes with shadowmeld+aimed shots. Also all weapons are hunter weapons ;)
---
Most people don't outgrow humour and I would pity anyone that ever does.
---
I was thinking Sac wouldn't be so necessary because I can dispel CC off him, no?
---
Mulgore.
---
Did you just invent a hypothetical scenario just to upset yourself?
---
With the amount of casuals playing and raiding, especially this time around, not sure this will be such a big issue.
---
Well my bud is set on paladin. Paladin/Rogue could work --- not sure if it's better than SPriest/Paladin though
---

It took most people 2 months to hit 60, and another 2 months to realize MC was bugged to the point you couldn't progress in it, too.
---
Never had any issue raising with my pet. Sure, it dies sometimes, but never caused a wipe. Limiting a player's DPS based on some perceived notion that hunters are automatically bad at their class is dumb. If my raid leader says I can't keep my pet out, I'll find a new guild.
---
You do understand that they are extremely over geared for that content. Even if they are under level the gear they have puts them over the top. If they had questing greens with no enchants they would be getting destroyed.
---
Get to max level, gear up a bit, pvp, gear up a bit better for pvp, get bored and stop playing. 
---
Basically, the same thing I did in vanilla, in wotlk, and in BFA  - just with a different class this time.
---
The guild! Such a great web series.
---
Badlands at night is something else... I don’t know what it is but I feel so immersed when I look up at the large rock faces and see the dark blue, starry sky.
---
Raids &gt; Grades
---
Get to lvl 60 ASAP and make a bunch of twinks for 30-39. I hope there is a large twink community in classic, I really miss guild vs guild premade fights.
---
This has been discussed to death. The values are confirmed correct. There is no conspiracy to make classic easier for those who play retail.
---
These are good clips of the backpedaling issue, backpedaling breaking leeway. But as far as I understand and remember, the whole melee leeway should not even be present in the Classic beta / was not present in Vanilla.
---
Um…. “Holy Pally, Holy Priest, Resto Druid” are all very viable for PvP….. No you wont be killing players directly, but Certain specs and groups with a full pocket healer are just scary! A Warrior with a pocket healer is bonkers, for example! 
---
Also in Bg’s when there is a few dedicated healers, the enemy team really feels it bc they wont be able to kill anything.
---
Just because people can camp entrances doesn't make it griefing. Someone else has already mentioned that you can just ghost walk to the portal, rez, and run in.
---
 A huge part of vanilla PvP is creating contention over limited resources, be it a dungeon, a quest area, or a popular herb route.
---
Judgement not being in your top 3 is like someone saying “I know people talk about MJ a lot but was he REALLY better than Moses Malone?”
---
Sunset in booty bay
---
What times are you looking to play at your schedule is similar to mine?
---
Many parts of my post are facts like the existence of ammo, pet happiness, deadzone. Also the advantages of a hunter like good leveling are self explanatory. These combined make about 70% of the post, so I am very interested why do you think this is **all wrong information.**
---
So no, you’re wrong. The reason these guys can go all out is a combination of knowledge of how to heal and tank in addition to them min/maxing gear waaaay more than you commonly would while leveling. There’s even been blue posts where they confirm this.
---
You want to play Undead, play undead, nothing wrong with undead warrior man :)
---
* [https://youtu.be/UYTaqxUVZB0?t=64](https://youtu.be/UYTaqxUVZB0?t=64)
---
I guess my question, is if there is so much evidence why do they claim it's "working as intended"? I had 140 days played on my hunter with extensive time invested in pvp and I also remember this melee leeway stuff very differently. Same with the over 200 days /played in TBC and the probably 30 days /played I had in Wrath before I quit.
---
I guess I'm just confused how the evidence clearly points to one thing, but they are claiming it's another.
---
"I'll rip the secrets from your flesh!"
---
Can't wait to farm the torturing poker!
---
It's why I'm playing Classic.  It's just a shame it's the 1.12 version.
---
Rogue/Druid is for double stealth, the element of surprise is brutal.
---
As for paladin/X, I would say paladin/warrior might be better. Warriors just need someone to strip slows off them (blessing of freedom), and scale really well with buffs (blessing of might).
---
As far as raiding and pvp goes (assuming you’re in a consistent/organized group) it is a very linear curve between time invested/rewards. Guilds only progress if every member of the guild gears up over time
---
I like the pvp aspect of them; that getting ganked on your way to the instance or gathering a group to ambush an enemy raid has noticeable consequences.
---
I dislike everything else about them and I agree that they're not a positive thing.
---
You don’t need to tell them you’re rolling on healing gear. I mean for DPS or some other offspec stuff, you should let them know in advance. 
---
I was just trying to make that distinction, since some people actually do think they can just roll on all specs as a healer, without telling anybody, and without any drama. Not sure if the poster you replied to is being serious or not, but some people do feel that way.
---
I find the lack of ska very disturbing
---
Tbf, it was 50/50 with every class except rogue, that rogue was 100% attacking you.
---
Marketing? Its included with sub to wow. You just need an active sub to play classic.
---
I love how you don’t comment on the other 2 points. It’s a yikes from me dawg
---
You have to lump all humor together to justify finding rape jokes funny?  There was a point in my life where someone saying butt would make me laugh but then I turned 7.  Now I think grown men playing with their own wands and making rape jokes are funny.
---
She didn’t say she received death threats. She said people said lots of really mean and hurtful things but the in the half that I read, she didn’t say death threats.
---
so youre gunna mind soothe ppl to death lmao alright bud enjoy. scream is still the only peel the priest has. enjoy using stoneform to kite, whatever that means. your only slow is a channeled spell that requires you to stand still, not much kiting going on there. you dont have any priest utility in shadowform and reapplying shadowform is generally gg due to your already terrible mana issues. only true point is that swp is indeed the strongest dot in the game, but with no other protection from dispells you wont even be able to gank lowbies with it. still one of the best 1v1 specs in the game but youre just a turret standing still channeling mind flay after mind flay. some ppl like being the strongest even if its boring as fuck, so more power to ya.
---
So an insanely try hard Paladin farming Manual Crowd Pummelers and popping very expensive consumes (Chilis and Shadow Oils), can ALMOST catch average warriors and rogues.   
---
What does this build parse like without those things though? How many Pummeler's are needed per raid to keep up? Obviously you fall behind on Trash right? Looking at his logs, he is near the bottom of the DPS meter when including Boss and Trash. Despite trying as hard as he does with consumes,  his dps is like half of the top player's DPS, not the 90% you claim.  
---
Just because he can high parse if the fight lasts the perfect duration and he uses ridiculous amounts of consumes doesn't really mean shit.  
---
Also, isn't threat going to be an issue for a ret paladin? They don't have vanish, or reduced threat from being in a different stance do they? So even outtputting similar DPS to a rogue, when tank is not threat capped they will still run into issues just like warlocks do right?
---
Probably optimistic, but I would assume Blizzard would weight community metrics over community QQ for determining phase releases. 
---
I.e. unique account weekly login, accounts with a level 60 character, number of accounts participating in 1 lvl 60 dungeon each week, number of account participating an Molten Core, number of accounts who have completed Molten Core, etc.
---
I'm with you in hoping that they dont just cater to the  1% World First Hardcores and Streamers.
---
Back when MOP released I leveled a monk with a friend.  We leveled almost exclusively via dungeons.  I didn't pull packs without cc.  I didn't pull whole rooms.  I pulled half the fucking instance, and aoe'd it on top on the boss,  The instances weren't nerfed.  I just had insane boa gear with good enchants.
---
The instances are tuned to be done with trash gear and dps specs.
---
There's not really a complied guide yet. It's been simmed and has some, but not a lot, of logs. The build was developed about 2 or 3 months ago, and there hasnt been a fresh server released since it was theorycrafted.  We just confirmed the last core piece works on the beta last week. I expect spelladin guides to come fairly soon, either before or after Classic launches. We have the data, we just need to compile it and upload it everywhere. 
---
The build stacks Spellpower and uses MCP or other fast weapons to increase the value you can get out of flat rate procs with SP scaling, along with SoR. SoR's damage is based on the speed number on the weapon, not your effective swing timer, so haste procs like MCP and Jackhammer give you much higher SoR damage than their swing timer. 
---
You can look up 'Spelladin' on youtube, Dexterbravo has some good testing for the build. He highballs the fuck out of his consumables and buffs, but the build is functional with a more minimalist approach.
---
That's true. I've experienced both the BfA community and the private server community. The former is antisocial and the latter is toxic.
---
The beta feels almost like a time capsule.
---
Rogues need to switch specs for pve and pvp
---
The storyline has been trashed since Warcraft 3. That story was just so forced and bad. Warcraft lore before then was brutal and dark.
---
Girls don't play video games.
---
You got about 1/80 of the way there!
---
I was lucky enough to have a friend back in 2006 who had his own credit card (spoiled beyond belief),  so i would scrounge up 15 bucks every month and pay him back and some months i couldnt even manage that lol.   But man, i got into so much trouble with my parents for playing all the time, they couldnt understand.  College was tough but i got through somehow by some fucking miracle.   But WoW was part of the reason i work in my current field.  It made me curious about building computers so i work in IT now.   So in a way, playing the game kinda gave me some troubleshooting skills and essentially paved my path in life.  I wish i was a network engineer so i could make more money but its such a hard field to break into.  I digress.   Were all getting a 2nd chance to play again and its gonna be great.
---
It actually does sound like he wants to play a hunter.
---
Holy paladin not viable in pvp lmao
---
Yes, I am, because just about every guild has bad players and attendance issues, even Naxx clearing guilds. The logistics of running a 40 man raid group are pretty stupid. A lot of the time you take what you can get. 
---
Without server transfers, you have a finite pool of raiders on any given server. as I said before, most servers can't field the kind of guild that can afford to be hyper picky about meta specs. There will be a couple, but not many.
---
Well, I’m glad it wasn’t racist... just thinking that makes me the racist doesn’t it? Shit...
---
Idk, I remember people getting bad reps and being discussed server wide. It’s not EVERYONE or even the majority but you completely could screw yourself over
---
The difficulity is indeed cringe and Nost had gotten their data from somewhere (their dungeons were harder)
---
Username checks out
---
I’m mostly worried about the power of streamers. I know everyone is tired of talking about streamers here, but they do hold power within the community and the devs do listen to them.
---
The issue with this is that streamers are no-lifers. While they have income from playing the game all day, I can only play for 2 hours a night if that. That person doesn’t represent me at all.
---
Great video. I was in &lt;Titans of War&gt; so this brings me back. I'm pretty sure we got revenge when they wiped us outside bwl but idk. Also... &lt;Titans of War&gt; was on another level when it came to toxic players.
---
I am wondering if he wasted more time creating this account to post this or watching Asmongold?
---
Rogue.  Its the hardest pvp class to master.  But once you get it, you should never lose 1v1 to anyone.
---
If you want a more straight forward class though, then mage is easier to play.  Mages are very good 1v1 as well as in bgs as well.
---
Half the wow community can’t even clear a +10 in retail, I doubt I will have to worry about my reputation when they are busy forming a WC run while I’m doing strat.
---
Meh. Seal Fate build will give you both at 95% effectiveness, IMO.
---
I am awfully surprised they had y’all change that! I assume someone just got jealous of how good that guild name was.
---
nope, I hate pets
---
&gt;i don't have 100% preplanned route and no xp with the areas
---
Why don't you get these while there's time? Would make 24-hour-long session more meaningful.

It's easier for 40 people to work for 2 hours independently than it is to get 40 people to work cooperatively for an hour.  Scheduling problems are inevitable, so shorter raid nights means more people can participate.

Let the true nerds handle this and figure it out, meanwhile we'll just keep playing and gaving a good time.
---
20 months is a ton of time. If you're hyper worries about what others are doing you've already ruined it for yourselves.
---
Back in vanilla I was a properly itemized Mage, which meant I looked like a clown.
---
This go around I don't really care to make progression my #1 priority. I'll likely have two sets. Primary set will be good stats. Second set will be full tier 0.5 since I never had the need to get it. I'm looking forward to completing all the quests to get the full set, and that will be the set I use when I'm hanging out in IF.
---
I'll see you by the mailbox in your full Arcanist /u/rawnkin
---
Nah. They’re just finding things to keep themselves occupied until the next Blue Post or Streamer Outrage.
---
No one actually cares.
---
I always remembered  seeing people in this guild called &lt;Sapped Girls Can't Say No&gt; and
---
&lt;It Burns when I PVP&gt;
---
I didn’t think so. I’m only one individual tho.
---
Depends on servers and how they handle layering. If we have 500 people per starter zone, 24 hrs straight could get you to level 20.
---
And that's on the optimistic end.
---
I’ll go along and assume quests are even going to be completable via layering. Also assuming servers are stable and you login.  I could see you getting to the 16-18 range if you don’t know what you’re doing.
---
Strange fruit...
---
I mean if you call 400 in prebis with 2 consumes awful, sure, but that's a pretty damn competitive rate in prebis. It's not a tier 1 dps spec, but it's worth the raid slot. Beats locks early and mages late, so as long as you're running either, you could run a ret without shooting yourself in the foot. 
---
I was on warrior at the time. I found the content to be pretty easy and the DPS checks were very low compared to what everyone could output. Sure, I wont hit quite as hard on War as I will on Pal, but that's fine. As long as I'm doing competitive damage within the guild, I don't really care if I'm at the top.
---
Thank you!
---
15~20
---
I'm looking into finding some time pre launch to plan something - issue is I'm super busy with work until around launch
---
People who get mad about jokes tend to just be stupid. And the anger comes from being too stupid to get the joke.
---
Lol you gather up like 30 min before raid time then get em all.
---
Nothing beats seeing a coordinated group of 40 raid geared players heading out together.
---
&lt;Nine Inch Males&gt;
---
Usually a day of gameplay got me to around level 20 (depends on the class and server pop)
---
Im trying to figure out which Class I'll play in Classic: **Mage or Rogue.**
---
Some quick points:
---
* I only played WoW for 4 months and it was during the beginning of BFA. A bit overwhelmed back then, so many addons, rotations, specs, etc. Felt like I was too late to the party, everybody knew so much, and I was just noobing around lol
---
* On BFA I played a bit of DH (main), Mage, DK, Warrior and Monk.
---
* Maybe I should roll a "beginner friendly" class in Vanilla? I dont know if thats even a thing haha whatever..
---
* I dont like to tank or heal, only DPS. Thats one reason why I chose these 2 classes anyway.
---
* I would PvE (raid/dgs) and PvP (open/bgs) ...
---
* Maybe I'll have 1 or 2 friends playing with me, but thats not guaranteed. And idk which class they'll roll. We would probably play Horde characters.
---
* I like both melee and ranged playstyles.
---
* Aesthetic-wise: Rogue gear/weapons are cooler. Mage spells effects/animations are cooler.
---
* You guys can ask me more questions if that helps you giving me a better advice idk. Thanks for the help!
---
**So what do you guys recommend: Should I pick Rogue or Mage? And why?**
---
Sugma
---
Lol players do it and it works fine
---
Being in casual guilds, I never fully cleared any raids other than ZG, and dabbled in the rest.  I would like to clear all of the raids .  No time frame.
---
The somewhere along the road heading south out of Darkshire in Duskwood. It just so creepily delicious!
---
With no exp ? Probably in the mid 20's. Good track with a fast leveler and good experience is like 30 at around 24hours, so mid twenties is pretty decent.
---
Most guilds will ask their members for world buffs.  Its a core part of raiding nowadays.  Its a nuissance ofc to brush your teeth everyday, but after a couple tries, it becomes more habitual and it just becomes a part of your weekly preparation.     You kill faster, less overall stress placed on guildeed and officers, you get more loot because you put in effort.  The benefits really outweigh the time and effort needed for world buffs.  Its a win win, but i totally get it.  We have players in our guild who dont get full buffs and we can still clear content, but everyone sees how much effort you put in and will be rewarded accordingly.
---
At best you will be approaching 30.
---
Parents were from the 80's, so lots of 80's metal/rock was played on the radio in the car. Not sure how different the stations are depending on where you live, but we had two old rock/metal stations to choose from. I was always a fan of ACDC, Zeppelin, Guns &amp; Roses, Metallica, Motley Cure, Ozzy, White Snake etc. because of them.
---
When the 2000's hit and I was in my teen years, I of course started liking and preferring rap like most kids. It became mostly 50 cent, Eminem, Jay-Z, SNoop Dogg, Ying Yang Twins, Lil Jon etc. 
---
Another decade later and while I still do listen to rap from that era and earlier occasionally, I have went back to old school rock and metal for the most part. I even branched out into other rock and metal bands my parents didn't even listen to and expanded into even more genres. I think I can say the only music I genuinely still hate and will just never like is country, but in general, you grow to appreciate more music as you age for sure.

The only real fun I had in cata was parking an alt somewhere far from org prior to the world change and then running him back on foot, exploring the brand new strange and dangerous world. I think my alt was mid 30s. It was the closest to reliving that first time exploring the world. 
---
I also did tier 1 raids on my main which pretty much sucked. Quit just before firelands and the dreaded raid finder.
---
Yeah that makes total sense especially after I led with explaining the jokes.
---
You have absolutely no idea how languages work.
---
But what’s the point of plowing through content? So, if we stick to 18-20 months, Classic will be over in a year and a half. Why would we need to barrel through content like we did in Vanilla?
---
I’m not worried about what anyone else is doing, I’m just worried that this is going to pass in the blink of an eye because we feel we need to mirror Vanilla’s implantation times.
---
It was very easy to fill a raid for our semi-hardcore guild all the way through the private server. It only started to get harder once Naxx came out and many people started leaving the server with Classic looming over head. I think this assumption is based on the time you spent on the server and not so much in what we will see in Classic.
---
Why play with retards when you can choose not to?
---
Check out kargoz or north's streams/YouTube content. They are working numbers on it now.
---
&gt; I feel 6 months for each phase is pretty good
---
Whole year of only leveling, MC and Ony? Not mentioning worldbosses because they're usually quite exclusive.
---
I think they'll just go with Blizzlike timeline, or a bit faster to avoid content drought that will inevitably come quicker with all the experience people have these days.
---
lol RP nerd, who cares?
---
Dust that notepad off, and put on your scholomance pants. You’ve got a shot at redemption
---
I would hope that Blizzard would create new servers for those wanting to progress into TBC. Giving players the option to “one-way” export their Classic server characters to the new TBC servers, leaving those that want to remain in Classic the option.
---
I say this because I can see a rift between those that want TBC but don’t want to level from 1 to max again.
---
I agree. I'm hoping they do a more relaxed content release this time around. Vanilla felt like it went by too quickly and I was no-lifing back then. My hope is that they'll stretch it out to about 4 months per phase - this way we could get to enjoy each content meta just a bit longer and get a few more weeks of raiding in. I'll unfortunately be more casual this go-around but I'm hoping I can form a decent guild with my old friends.

&lt;It's always sunny in Duskwood&gt;
---
are there water banquets in classic so that raids can get the water?  even the level 45 type if not the good level 55 type?
---
Yeah this seems logical when you factor in the amount of other people playing and assuming that you know what to do on every single quest.
---
It's not that simple though. You do have to PvP well and communicate with your premade pvp group and not be a dick etc etc. Also, Doing premades isn't solely roflstomping PuG groups 24/7. What usually happens is that you meet a premade for the first time in the day and you kinda check who is best by playing a full game. Usually a second game if you meet them again. It kinda depends on how balanced the previous fight was and how shameless and lame the group is because IMO those premade vs pug games are boring as well as highly annoying to the pugs. So I pushed my premade to fight other premades more often and we ended up becomming better and instead of us leaving the BG, the opposing premade left more often than not. So anyway, skill, communication and determination etc does definitely matter
---
You're talking about an 18-20 month "season" in a game. That's unheard of. It's insane long. 
---
It also can't last forever. That's part of what makes the time so precious.
---
They were great for small group BGs, IIRC.
---
By how much? In league you can be across the map in less than a minute. In WoW, it'll take an upwards of fifteen minutes just to get from zone to zone.

ZG Buff absolutely is lost on death.
---
Classic isn't being created to attract new players.  That's what retail is for.  Classic is being created to provide a different experience for retail players and to bring back old players.
---
If you are a current wow player, already know about Classic.  If you are a old player, it is likely you also already know about Classic.  Therefore, whats the point in marketing?  If you find out about retail, you will find out about classic in due time.  There is really no reason for them to market it any more than they already have.
---
Without planning it out and just going with the flow. I’d say high teens, maybe you might be able to break 20. There’s gonna be a lot of redundancy  and back tracking to get quests. Plus depending on layering and high amount of volume you may be stuck waiting for quest drops/mobs or skipping certain ones all together to try and get ahead of the curve. 
---
Idk though, for comparison I started a Druid on a private server and spent maybe a little more time than I should of farming leatherworking and also a super slow RFC run, and I think hit 15 in maybe two days at about 5-6 hours a day?
---

---
Sorry that is incorrect. You need sub to do PvP and sub is garbage for PvE. You can still seal fate for PvP (barely, you lose a lot of talents and it isn't worth it) BUT that build would suck for PvE.
---
Because rogues don't wear plate and can't tank dps is all they do and warriors still outshine them at the highest gear levels.
---
One of segments persona:
---
WoW player who refused and quit after TBC/WOTLK would like to play Classic again, how do you reach that audience of potential new-returning subscribers?
---
I think headmaster's charge is a more worthwhile endeavor.
---
Except blizzard thought it should be nothing more than a joke. (+1 to anyone who gets that reference)
---
Beats locks early and mages late .... only non ignite mages though right? And ignite mages are pretty common "late". I think you will be under both the mages and the locks on the DPS meters, despite needing the same gear as them. This is reflected in Mourtagh's logs.
---
Chill bro, guy.
---
Agreed... I want nothing to do with old AV.  Sounds good on paper, and I might be hyped for it for like an hour, but it was honestly complete shit with the vast majority afk, or gathering / fishing while letting their rep accumulate.  Really wasn’t fun at all in practice in my opinion.
---
And this would put that mage on my block list, if they're petty enough to force charge for portals who knows what other greedy shit they'd do. The only way I would pay for a portal is if I was in a main city and needed quick travel to a different one, I'd tip a bit. But it's usually customary for mages to open a portal to org after a dungeon. I would maybe understand "I only open one portal, I'm not opening one for org, UC, and TB"
---
Dude, are you enlisted or an officer...cus fraternization and all that.
---
everybody interested in the item / prestige / title do. It's one of several reason why WPvP died the moment BGs came out.
---
sure, there's always gonna be a fringe group of jerks who enjoy camping flightpaths or terrorizing redridge mountain on their lvl 60... but the majority of the playerbase have a very low interest in WPvP... as you can see on retail or in the beta .
---
Sounds good on paper but mana issues, interrupts, and kitebility make this mediocre compared to warrior paladin or rogue paladin. 
---
Any class with a Holy Paladin following them is one of the best combos in the game.
---
Yup. The top PvP guild on my server essentially based their entire warsong comp around supporting one warrior who turned into a fucking freight train with 1-2 pocket pallies, a priest, and a druid following him around.
---
"Stoneard" 😀
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_8iSRYlfr70](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8iSRYlfr70)  16:30 look how far away that feral druid is able to attack the mage.
---
I don't really like warriors unfortunately and I'm not a good one, so this isn't for us. SPriest is my favorite but I like Locks and Rogues too.
---
IMO it's fair to roll for *all* upgrades, be it for your current role or for leveling. After you finish that dungeon, you'll need to do quests, and you can't heal a mob to death.
---
But yea always better to discuss stuff in advance.
---
where was that announced?
---
There is more than 1 spec for classes?  I'm pretty sure most classes have the mathematical best spec and if you put your talents else where you are just gimping your pre made or raid.
---
Phase 1 will be released at Classic release, so we will have phase 2 6 mos after that.
---

Hey man if that's what you want to do.

---
Not all of it, but you’re right stuff like poly and different situational stuff like sap if you’re out of combat so I don’t have to use bubble to start a fight.
---
Even in fights where I have multiple paladins around me we bos each other because the most important thing about it is not using a global on dispel and being able to focus on the task at hand.
---
I hope there's no report players afk.
---
I remember trying to do some of the quests, go to mines, stay back and defend. I'd get reported afk and would have 60 seconds to run up north and tag an ally.

Azshara.. I love the coastline and the autumn foliage.
---
It was a joke but ok
---
I was gonna argue with you on that but gave it a second thought. Could be that the reason I like WC3 has more to do with the art style, riding on the success of WC 1&amp;2, the map editor and the custom map community (dota, tides of blood, TDs like skibi and so on). 
---
The story was OKish but I've always preferred a more gritty/unforgiving world (warhammer?)
---
I want to raid naxx as an elemental shaman, but finding a guild that is cool with this is difficult.  I need a hybrid-curious guild that will allow unconventional specs.  I am a good player, and would go above and beyond with consumables.

Sub is garbage for PvE, but I disagree completely you need it for PvP.
---
This is why you're not invited too birthday parties.
---
Ok, what kind of build would you go with for PvP without sub
---
I don't buy the toxicity argument.  Raiding already to begin with has that atmosphere of DPS charts and blaming folks for wiping.
---
World buffs is a core mechanic of classic. please Classic as is; it's still quite a pain to actually coordinate folks to get world buffs.  If the content is trivial without it, then people simply won't go through the effort to get the buffs.
---
Yea after watching a couple interviews with him I can see that he seems humble, also seems somewhat shy/awkward which might endear him to some.
---
But from a pure acting standpoint he isn't anything special. The day before E3 we were talking on ts about how many actors we were gonna see at E3, cause that has apperantly become a new normal thing. And just an hour before the xbox presentation we were talking about Keanu, my friend said John Wick was awesome and I said yea it was an action movie.... I just don't see why people get emotionally tied to him?
---
I can understand Carrie Fisher, or Mark Hammel. (yes I was a huge starwars fan)

Rogue, Mage and Warlock level 19 twinks here. It was never skill to outgear people and two-shot them, but I wasn't after honorable victories, I was after my enemy's crushing defeat. There is nothing quite like seeing someone rage-charge you over and over out of pure anger and frustration trying to get revenge. Completely ignoring the flag carrier and rushing straight at you only to fall over dead before they get me to half.
---
All Undead of course for maximum BM. /Cannibalize

Based on the values listed in [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1N7egLaBARP3vNpWooSQmcO0aSW301y1c5BBPbm0LhSU/edit?usp=sharing) you can optimally get to level 29-30 under good grinding conditions with 24 hours in-game played. Realistically if you no-life it without sleeping and limited bathroom breaks, you can probably hit the 23-24 plateau if you sit down and go for it.
---
Just started using brave 100% would recommend
---
He was right but they apparently fixed it some weeks ago as others have pointed out. Why the aggressive tone?
---
That seems fairly certain then.
---
Thanks :)
---
That’s so overused already haha
---
Shadow Oil is fucking DIRT cheap before Naxx. The only reason it's expensive is because they're components to GSPP. 
---
I'm sorry what, so Mourtagh cant beat Salad Baker players so you compare him to average warriors and rogues lmao. As I said, Salad Bakers and similar logs are distorted as fuck, and even then his logs are pretty good. Find logs with similar clear times and compare him. Paladin shouldn't really beat Warrior or Rogue, that's not the point of the build. We do beat non-ignite mages in Naxx, and warlocks in MC and BWL, so we're still in the running for DPS. 
---
I didn't say that Mourtagh's parses are perfect duration. I said that the Salad Bakers parses are distorted because they're damn near perfect. Mourtagh's parses are all over the place in fight duration. You're spinning shit way out of context at this point. The 2k warrior pulls are the PERFECT pulls, not 3k. We don't have perfect Paladin DPS pulls on just about any boss. We only have a handful of logs for the build by players worth their raid slot.
---
Holy damage generates less threat, and the Spelladin build generates less threat than AP ret, despite doing more damage. We're always below rogue by some amount threat isn't really a huge issue. Warriors will always run into threat problems before we do.
---
&gt;The issue with this is that streamers are no-lifers. While they have income from playing the game all day, I can only play for 2 hours a night if that. That person doesn’t represent me at all.
---
You are thinking about it all wrong then.  Blizz team doesn't listen to the no-lifers, they list to the 2 hours or less crowd.  Why?  Because people will less time are more willing to put money into the game in order to catch up.  That's why mmo's are catered towards casual.  Casual is where the money is.
---
Proof?  Just look at the time line of wow.  With each patch, the game became progressively more and more casual until we got the retail.  
---
If blizz intends on making money... they will never listen to any of these "no-lifers" you mentioned.
---
I imagine a huge motivation for getting raid buffs is perceived performance during the actually raid. A few world buffs could make the difference between a DPS topping the meters or not, so it's not surprising people spend time acquiring them.
---
Yep that was the point 😉
---
LMAO
---
I think each phase represents a season due to BiS changing from phase to phase. They’ve been working on this game for a few years now, I feel like it’d be a moronic business decision to have it all over in a year and a half. Additionally, the longer Classic is it gives them more time to work on expansions or Classic content.
---
&gt;It also can’t last forever. That’s part of what makes the time so precious.
---
This is how we’re in the mess right now. We all missed Vanilla and it passed us by so fast. Why would we do V2 Vanilla blazing fast also?
---
I've used all 3, and subtlety is the best, but you can still easily get by with a SoF dagger build, and you can even get by with a combat swords build, although not as easily.
---
Yes that's a decent comp for 2v2 because the rogue has good tools for dealing with multiple people at once (eg two high burst dps) but its still way worse for BGs than pal/war.
---
Because loot man. It's a snowball effect. Let's say world buffs aren't required for your guild but you have a small core of badass dps that get world buffs every week. These people will outperform you in every aspect. Loot in vanilla can be really rare. You can farm BWL for a year and only see one Drake dang talisman, or nefs tear or any other really nice item. When an item like this drops do you think your guild will give it to you, someone who doesn't perform as well or try as hard as these other dps in your guild? Why do you deserve to get an item over them when giving it to them means more performance and is overall a better decision for guild progression. Do you expect to get good loot just for being a guild member or do you want to get loot because you perform well.
---
Competitive nature is big. If someone is smoking everyone else on meters in raids then soon enough people will start doing what that guy is doing because they don't wanna get beat every raid and they want a shot at good loot.
---
Loot is the carrot and the guild controls the stick.
---
There is a good reason for them NOT to market it: Taking people away from retail. Yes, they are both included in the same subscription but, while Classic will have 0 pay to win mechanics and 0 paid cosmetic items, retail has all that AND expansions that they want the masses to buy. The only reason they are even bringing Classic WoW back from the dead is to capitalize on all the new accounts made and hope that some of these will want to get into retail and fall victim to their predatory "micro-transactions".
---
Lol less than 100 total guilds in the world actually cleared naxx 40 during retail vanilla (less than .1% of all players). I don't think "people had already gotten Naxx on farm" at any point during retail vanilla, for any guilds, on any server, in the world. At least, depending on how you define "on farm". Sure some maybe had 1 or 2 bosses "on farm", but most definitely not the entire raid. Blizz at one point said less than 1% of all players downed even one boss.
---
I'll give it to you that I didn't consider everything when I posted that previous comment.  I also pvped quite a lot, up to rank 11, but it was also 12+ years ago so my info is all going off memory here.  If you can keep constant CC on the warrior then you could beat them, but that isn't the easiest task.  I know locks weren't the squishiest class.  Lock/Pally or lock mage could have been rough.  I don't think lock/druid would have won in vanilla, but in tbc, maybe because druids had cyclone.  Lock rogue could win if the warrior was stun locked the entire fight.  That fight would come down to if the warrior could burst down the rogue between stuns.  Pretty sure resto shammy wouldn't win.  And it isn't just tank and spank.  Its a combo of stuns, slows, and fear, with the durability and movement of the warrior/pally.  A lot of it could be that most of what I am remembering was later in vanilla as well and I had pretty good gear by that point.  Warrior without the gear wouldn't be able to do it. But when you can 2-3 shot people, its a different story.
---
how else do you explain it?
---
&gt;I suck at roleplaying
---
And humour
---
World buffs make dying much less desirable and promote huge world PvP fights. 
---
Raids are easy anyways, but its much more boring to do them when you know that dying won't affect anything.
---
Michael Scott would not stand for this sjw crap.
---
Or just people who are unimpressed by low effort rehashed jokes that add nothing to the discussion.
---
One of the two.
---
Thought this was fixed in vanilla at some point, used to summon friends into lava in IF all the time. If it wasn't fixed in vanilla but later I hope it returns!
---
I'm not going to lie as someone who is playing hunter and has played hunter, this post is full of bullshit.
---
A money laundering scam, cleverly disguised as a dumpster fire.
---
who buffs outside the instance?
---
Easiest question ever: Shadowprey Village in Desolace
---
Did you expect logs from Vanilla?
---
&gt; This looks like its not even using real Vanilla numbers.
---
Or maybe people are better with more optimized gear than they had in Vanilla. If you don't like evidence based on thousands on parses and prefer your own faulty, ignorant recollection of events from 15 years ago, there's not much the Universe can really provide to change your opinion.
---
No, ooga gang found certain evade spots and pull strategies. Also boss strat like the 2+2 blood.
---
yeah I was one of those grouped people whispering a solo-er like you :D No drama though, I just asked him if he wanted to join our group, have an easier time, have a nice group of people to talk to, and end up having to grind less. Because this solo player was putting us to shame with his insane numbers haha. I guess you did the same? If I remember correctly, he ranked 1st in some week and judging from my messages with him, he grinded 100k more than we did, while he went solo and he wasn't even an impressive PvPer.   
---
The numbers he was pulling was unhuman though. He shared me a sad story about him having a terminal ilness and wanting to help his nephew reach r14.. Looking back at it, chances are that he was just making up some excuse for the account sharing he did :\\ Anyway, he ended up joining us (most of the time), never talking, just doing his thing. After I finished the grind and left the leadership in other hands, I heard he continued to become r14 by mostly playing solo, which is kind of impressive on the one hand, but on the other hand shows how heavily account sharing influences the honor ranking system :\\

By Stoneform kite I mean Stoneform removes poisons and gives immunity to them - for kiting rogues. You do have other priest utility in Shadowform, including Mana Burn, PW:S, and Dispel.

What could be a better caster/Paladin setup than SPriest/Pally??? Warlock? But you wont have the burst ??

Agreed. No shame in ignorance, we were all there once. I'm really looking forward to reciprocating the kindness shown by the dude who took 18-year-old-huntard me aside and taught me how to play properly by paying it forward in Classic.

---
When deciding to attack people I ask myself ,would the fun exceed the hassle and does the enemy deserve to be killed
---
i see the point you are getting at but in the end you are trying to use your lack of playing time as a good reason to hold others back. It's pretty selfish.  
---
you freely admit you will be playing casually and in the same sentence state that you don't want to be left behind. Thats not how this works... thats not how any of this works.
---
&gt; Worldbuffs trivialize already trivial content
---
Then don't worry about them, the content is already trivial.
---
&gt; Worldbuffs will be available in classic, day one, every single raid, trivializing progression, which is something pservers didn't
---
Cool, let the autists do their thing right from the get go.
---
&gt; Timers won't help a damn thing, they will only make it a much bigger pain in the ass to get worldbuffs, and all the more infuriating to lose them
---
Every buff in the game has a timer, what do you want, some way to get the buff(s) when you want them without losing duration or something?
---
&gt; Worldbuffs breeds a toxic raid atmosphere
---
Thats completely dependent on the types of people you choose to raid with.
---
Don't play on a PVP server then.
---
You bring up interesting points, but I don't necessarily agree with them.
---
" The *smallest* of problems and literally applies to every other class as well. " - No it does not. Maybe only to warlocks. It can't apply to other classes since they do not have a pet and this point was about pet aggro. I hope I'm being clear here. I am not talking about bodypulling mobs in dungeons, but rather the hunter pet AI making shortcuts which cause accidental pulls. You know this if you played a hunter.
---
I see where you are coming from with your second point, but I disagree. I think hunters doing a variety of things is indeed a plus, but doing the important tasks reliably is more important than being able to do a bunch of things in an 'ok' way.
---
 I mean:  
---
Offtank: Paladins and Shamans are better tanks. Hunter pets are not good at holding aggro even as off tanks. They can be 'ok', but do you really need an 'ok' offtank? I doubt it.  
---
Kite: I agree hunters are excellent kiters, but mages can kite well too, while being much better at CC than hunters
---
Pull and drop aggro: Every warrior tank can use ranged weapons, thus pull himself, making 'pull and drop agro' not a needed thing. Hunters only started doing this in BC with the introduction of Misdirection which actually directed aggro at the tank.
---
Hard CC: I honestly don't understand this point. Please explain.
---
Increase move speed of entire party: Important to note that if the party members get hit, they are dazed. This means that aspect of the pack is only useful when running greater distances without encountering mobs.
---
Survive wipes, and wipe recover with engineering: True, if you are engineer.  
---
Track all rare spawns immediately: I agree, but you can only see tracked mobs on the minimap, which is not a huge range.  
---
I dont think that a class that can *kind of* offtank, can do a really not needed 'pull and drop aggro' move, increase the party's movement speed by 30% in a low amount of situations (only post-wipe runs come to my mind) and survive wipes IF he has engineering is a class in really high demand for dungeons. Also other classes have many other useful traits for dungeons too, so I don't think that 'doing okay in many situations' is a strong motivation to bring a hunter on a dungeon run.
---
Non-ignite mages meaning every mage not keeping the debuff on the boss. There is only 1 parsing mage per raid, and paladin beats every one that's not the Ignite holder. 
---
Consecration+bombs is great AoE. Holy Wrath in Naxx is also very good. Paladin is always passively cleaving, and our cleave has SP scaling. 
---
We have &gt;5m mana uptime while staying competitive with no potions or runes. We can downrank Consecration as needed, it's a huge manasink and there's deminishing returns on mana/damage on higher ranks, it matters more that you have it down than it does having it down at max rank. With runes or mana pots we can sustain max ranks for 5m+.
---
I think wanting to see logs is really fair. I cant fault you for that. I'm not sure if I'm as hardcore as Mourtagh, but I've done some minimalist testing with only a couple consumes and no MCP, it does pretty alright, all things considered. It's not as good, but that's to be expected. All the build really needs is Chili and Shadow Oil, which isn't too bad.
---
I thought there was always leeway in PVP
---
How did you know they were "from retail" lol what does that term even mean? Did you come to the conclusion that: someone is being shitty in one of my pugs, must be a retail wow player cause all retail wow players are impatient, immature kids.
---
I seriously don't understand why people on this sub shit on people who play retail as if it's some kind of personality defect. I also don't understand why liking/enjoying classic is seen to be some sort of positive quality that makes you a better person.
---
Are you sure that info is correct? WSG is already out in the beta and running smooth. I get why they would wait until honor is out to release any of the BGs, but that order confuses the fuck out of me. I know they had trouble with AV, so I would have expected it to launch last, and no idea why they are having trouble with AB and launching it last instead.
---
It's impossible to patch away all of the edge cases where you can summon someone to their death, just a matter of finding the right conditions :)
---
Why a Hunter?
---
You can't even do it what is this fucking post
---
I was able to do it on the floating islands in Nagrand so it made it to tbc at least.
---
Will zones scale at all?  To clarify(not sure if it's needed, but I will), If I recall, Duskwood for example, was a level 30 zone.  If I'm level 60, in Duskwood, will I just be annihilating things as I pass through, or will it be scaled up to 60, rendering it and all other zones the same difficulty in terms of mobs and such?
---
I was thinking about going alchemy &amp; enchanting on my priest but now that Truefaith vestments have been mentioned, I may do Alchemy &amp; Tailoring and then drop Tailoring after I get them + bags for all of my alts. I plan on having all of my alts with herbalism to supply my priest and skinning to not be broke AF.
---
Maybe the vitriol every person got when asking for Classic for over 10 years? The fact that people are trying to paint retail players as blameless victims is ridiculous. I don't really care about assigning blame, but to suggest there's no blame to go around is distorting reality.
---
One time on a PS I was killing Frost mages with my max level drawf warrior while they quested in un'goro .one logged on to an alliance alt to flame me, retorting was easy
---
I got rid of it. Only took 3 years. Oh well.
---
I loved TBC. Its by far my favorite expansion. The zones and Wpvp objectives were amazing. Loved the class balance and I hope we get some of it back (especially since I'll be feral tanking).
---
But yeah flying kind of killed the random pvp encounters you would get. 
---
I also hated Daily quest. I dont want to feel pressured everytime I log on to do an hour or two of quest before doing anything else.
---
Hey, you're welcome :)
---
Don't drink and drive! /s
---
Yes, I pulled the entire group above us even though im stealth, and because I am a rogue, I sent my warlock pet in to pull 6 mobs. Very good reading skills you have.
---

---
Because you don't spend 4 hours on a "modern" classic raid night.  Full raid buffs clears MC in times ranging from under half an hour to just under an hour.    I've done a leftover Nefarian from the night before+MC+Onyxia in two hours.
---
Full raid buffs could clear Ony+MC+BWL with time leftover on a 4hr raid night.

---
your innocence is endearing
---
It's not about how devs were ahead of time, it's about how most modern AAA projects degradated in terms of gameplay and engagement. Almost all old AAA games are super fun to play. They have soul, interesting gameplay, great soundtrack and engaging story.
---
This day game industry is about businessmen making money, back then it was enthusiasts making art.
---
I completely agree! I find playing a hunter fun too, I will probably play one as an alt for chill leveling and farming when classic comes out.  
---
One correction: Misdirection didn't exist in vanilla.
---

---
This isn't a product, and players have been talking about/doing this sort of thing since at least Wrath.  Calm your tinfoil hat.
---
Don't know if ahead of their time is the way I would put it but they created a quality, timeless game. Plenty of NES games would fall into this category imo, HOMM3 comes to mind aswell. It's a testament to the skill and hard work of the developers but to say ahead of its time feels wrong. If they were ahead of their time they would have put out added micro-transactions and released Fortnitw 15 years ago, not WoW.

You can make the same argument for a million things in Classic. Private server players exploit all kinds of shit that nobody thought about back in Vanilla. Imagine if Blizzard went around changing all that.
---
And this is why you should play on a PvE server.
---
Your point is valid. Everyone will be selfish here, so hopefully we find somewhere to land to appease the masses.
---
I know that the vast majority of players will be casual this time around due to being older, so hopefully a minority (like I said) doesn’t spoil it for the majority of players.
---
bis means best in slot.  So you list what is best there.  I'm sure there are lists that have more than one item per slot, but then its not a BIS list.
---
Classic wouldnt be over in a year and a half.  A raid that most people never saw will be released in a year and a half.  
---
Even if everything was released at launch you can still work through it at your own pace.

---
They weren't ahead of their time, quite the contrary they used design philosophies that have since been lost in time, philosophies with their roots in D&amp;D and other pen and paper RPGs.
---
When developers stopped trying to emulate the pen and paper experience is when the whole genre of RPGs took a turn for the worse. Depth and long journies are becoming increasingly rare.
---
The story was fine until mop.  I wouldn't be interested in anything past wotlk classic, maybe mop.  
---
Doesn't matter either way, because changing things cost money.  We would be lucky if they just do tbc classic without any changes.
---
As a warlock I did just that, both 14 years ago in vanilla and later on a pserver.
---
You will never be the best in anything, but you can be decent in everything. 
---
I think a hunter is similar.  You bring utility to PVE raids, with Tranquil Shot and some other fringe cases and do average dps.
---
In PVP you can be great, depending on your skill.  And you can solo a lot, farm easily if tha6t is your thing, a true jack of all trades.
---
I remember being flasked for most stuff but our only time intentionally world buffing was for killing Loatheb. It almost trivialized the fight. We went from a best attempt of ~28% to a kill with the buffs.
---
Make Stormwind Great Again
---
The wall we’ve built in Westfall has been highly successful thanks to my tremendous leadership. We made the pirates pay for it with the money they looted from us which was a HUGE win for my administration. 
---
It’s a shame what happened to the orcs great leader, Garrosh. Maybe the people of Orgrimar will get it right this time by letting their very smart and powerful Sylvannas bring greatness back to their city.
---
Absolutely. I always hated 'The Guild' as it seems a bit too fake. It's pure cringe.
---
Ah I see you'll be rolling dwarf.
---
Sorry - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_m4lVmyDsc is much better one. You can find various videos of classic druids soloing roccor and various other bosses. I just copied the first link. This one should be better.

I didn’t play vanilla wow. What was the bow quest?
---
The first few guild seasons were really good, they kinda lost their way after
---
It was an example you nitwit, I was pulling numbers out of my ass.
---
I have to disagree about TBC flying ruining the game and being responsible for today's game state. If I recall correctly, even if it does have some cons, they did pretty well introducing them I think. I remember having much more pvp and overall player interactions in TBC regardless of flying, really because of how the world was designed and how the flying mounts were expensive.
---
Flying mounts were really hard to get and it was even harder to get epic flying. I believe a lot of casual players had the 60% speed one which meant epic mounts were still better in many occasions. Nothing like now where we use our flying mounts to move like... 5 yards away. Yet, they were still an insane reward and the feeling was great.
---
The Outlands were designed with flying in minds. Flying was a core new mechanic and they did put some thought into it, rather than just unlocking it. I remember still having plenty of interactions and pvp, because we had plenty of pvp zones to deal with. For instance, I remember hours and hours of pvp in Nagrand because of Halaa or pvping to get the zone buffs like the spires blessing (or something like that).
---
I see your point, but this does bring up the elephant in the room. We don’t know what Blizzard will do after post-Naxx. They may make Classic plus, so I’ll easily be able to do like you said above or they roll out BC to all servers. We have once blazer through Vanilla and are into the expansions....
---
I mained a **holy** priest with alchemy &amp; herbalism during vanilla. If you're planning on going the same route, I would not choose a gathering profession. I had a difficult time with higher level mobs just to get to the herbs. That's why this time around, all of my alts will have herbalism to supply my main. And I plan on making a ton of alts. 
---
I loved being alchemist, though. I handed out potions and elixirs to my party and it just made the dungeons go a lot more smoothly. I'll be doing the same when classic comes.
---
That’s pretty cool hopefully we see stuff like this especially since I plan on druid’ing
---
With no experience you'll be barely level 20. But if you've done it before on private servers or on the beta and know exactly what to do then you can get close to level 30 in 24 hours.

Why I specifically pointed to PRE-BiS
---
The second worst part of it is that "après qu'il est mort" is inexplicably correct and in fact of high brow old timey literature level. Awkward sounding and unusual to a contemporary French speaker though.
---
Many natives would have mistakenly used the subjunctive here ("après qu'il soit mort")
---
Can I drink and wow?!
---
Booty Bay Booty
---
It wouldn't be impossible, just a lot harder.
---
The reason why World of Warcraft classic was so successfull, is because the developers made the game with their hearts and not to make as much profit as possible. 
---
If they fix alterac with all the npcs and the elementals everyhting is fine for me.
---
House Prestor, hmmm. I wonder if she's related to Lord Daval Prestor. Weird how he disappeared that time Deathwing showed back up for a while. Oh well, it's probably nothing.
---
We don't even know what their plan is for after the content is done. They could make fresh server or go on to BC etc. 
---
How long do you think the content can last?  If they make it 2 years or even 3 years there would be so much time between each phase people will get bored and leave. The content can't be stretched that much, and I'm not convinced stretching it will make it better.
---
It honestly feels bad that you think so little of me. I wanted to help out new players, not eliminate competition for gear. I will play a hunter in classic but it will only be an alt, and I will probably never do dungeons with it.  
---
Ammo, Pet happiness and deadzone can be daunting for *new* players. Maybe you think it is not big deal, but it can be for them. This post is not about talking crap about hunters, but pointing out disadvantages.  
---
" you can easily control more than 1 enemy, " - I disagree. This is only true if the enemies do nothing to counter them, which is never, or only if they are really bad.
---

Its literally titled "Interactable BIS spreadsheet for each class"  YOU put pre in there.
---
Wrong. :)
---
Haven’t had a single leaver on beta yet
---
Just no, no one guild will control world buffs and you can not hand in the quest to get the world buff within certain time frames from the last buff. I.e If Onxyia's head hanging up you can not hand in the quest or get the buff.
---
The world buff meta will be dead come Classic, thank goodness. And all the 'pros' that talk of 14k buffes health is bollocks, without the buffs they will not be able to trivalise the content. I am not saying that the people that having be clearing this content on PServer will struggle. Nor do I bare these people any ill will as many where the vocal minority for so long that helped make classic happened. But they have abused a mechanic on Pservers that just did not happen in vanilla and will not happen in any way the same manner in classic as it will not be possible.
---
The weak retail-kids will weed themselves out.
---
Gazoon Tight
---
for me, world buffs make the raidloggers actually want to play the game more. its fun seeing guilds going to get worldbuffs, and its great fun purging their world buffs. its great coordinating guilds to pop the dragonslayer buff. its great having top tier guilds still do past raids, and the drops for the world buffs is one of the reasons.
---
i dont think they should change them
---
Yeah I think this is the best solution, honestly.
---
4 hours was a very common raid night duration in actual vanilla, so you weren't pulling that completely out of your ass regardless of what you say.  Besides, my main point was it isn't a small decrease (25% or less) to your clear times, and you don't spend more time outside than you do inside.  You spend 15-30mins getting buffs, and it cuts your clear times in half or even further.
---
Actually knowing who you fight with and who you are fighting against added another dimension to the BG's that was indeed more enjoyable. For me personally, it meant I could weigh my options on what to do in WSG much better than what could be done without knowing the skill and gear level of any of the opposing players. Also the inclination to play objective vs the inclination to zerg midfield is different with each player so vs some (pug) players I KNEW that some player would probably be defending flag and I would know whether a fight would be in my favor or not. 
---
I actually enjoyed these mindgames the most so I was sad as well when cross-realm was introduced. Not as sad enough to use the word cancer for this but oh well, I suppose gamer language is somehow predicated on using exaggerated terms.  
---
Perhaps the biggest reason why x-realm is a bad idea is that the sense of community is degraded, which has a ton of negative effects, in this case: AFKing during BG's, not defending nodes, not defending flags, not healing. These kind of things are better not to do when you have to maybe instance with the same players later on or need some profession or help in some other way later on. This is exactly what nearly all of the beta classic wow streamers and YTers are saying, that they 'somehow find themselves whispering other people and helping them out with quests or dungeons, forming friends'. Being a vanilla player myself and later on became a sociologist, this was no surprise at all and I'm glad we're getting most of that structure back in classic. Sad that they're doing x-realm BG's, but happy because of lower queues.
---
&gt;This means, in effect, that aoe grinding for mages (and kiting in general) is harder if not near impossible. Mobs will hit you from max frost nova range, making it close to impossible to Cone of Cold and run around the mobs.
---
This displeases Nudvik.
---
Was watching Venruki leveling through SM and someone suggested they run into the instance to summon since they were getting ganked by alliance outside of SM to which the response was “can’t summon inside instances, they fixed it.” Also, two weeks ago at some point I read a post about someone who tried to summon inside an instance and failed. No blue post or anything about it.
---
I'm not talking about raids there's a bunch of mages in raids someone's gonna make a portal boss.
---
Everybody wanted the Lobotomizer/Unstoppable Force, too.
---
Upvote for interesting diversion. Solid evidence. I am of the camp that "castles" in WC3 were large, hulking stone structures with several towers. Anything else was a keep.
---
Toggle off your run and you should be okay to play.
---
Um at what point in WoW history has the alliance been the “bad guys” compared to the people eating zombies/trolls, the magic enslaving blood elves, world destroying goblins or the multiple genocidal warchiefs? Go ahead I’ll wait.
---
Whipper root tubers could also be simultaneously looted. Some players in the top guild on my vanilla server invited me to their ventrilo so I could follow them around and coordinate looting. If we ever failed to loot at the same time we just closed the loot box and tried again.
---
Mulgore is definitely up there for me.  
---
I've also always have a soft spot for Winterspring.
---
You don’t already!? I like to mix my alcoholism with my altoholism
---
I think if they made the buffs last maybe 50% longer, but made the timer run in real time instead of played time, then this issue would be greatly mitigated.
---
God she is a fox
---
So based on what you know from ret theorcrafting, do you think *realistically* spellpower ret will be competitive DPS for progression and farm? Or is this still just a shot in the dark right now?
---
yes, I was mistaking because they were released closely together
---
Don't make us mansplain this to you.

I remember my first time showing up to raid BWL with my guild and there was two Horde guilds getting ready to go in. We obviously couldn’t understand what was going on but the groups were speaking to each other in say chat all starring at us and our guild leader was like “we should probably leave” as we were going back to the flight path we passed another alliance guild and went back with them and there was an all out brawl. It is still one of my most fond memories in vanilla. Oh, and we wiped on Vaelastrasz obviously 😂.
---
R/wooooooosh on myself
---
Well, to be blunt, Blizzard has not been the most fan-friendly company since the times of wow launch (basically 2003 onwards). It has always been slow to admit mistakes and even blatant bugs, it has been very focused on this vision of theirs and in most of the beta tests huge effort has to have been put to "prove" a bug/feature that does not seem to work fluidly.
---
I am not at any level of the mind that Blizz is some great evil etc., I am still and always have been, a huge fan of their games, they have provided me with exceptional customer service over the years, but I have also worked in customer service industry for more or less a decade, and the fact is there is a lot of "hardheadedness" on the company's part at whiles.
---
I think what I am trying to say is that more people with beta access should post to the official forum, link/refer to these topics and threads, provide the videos that there are etc.. I am not subbed currently so I cannot put my own effort towards bringing this to their attention.
---
Their comment of working as intended might honestly be that this is something that they have not referred in their code at all/this feature might be so deep in the code that it actually does not stand out. It might really be that they have had no reason to specifically compare the movement behavior of their 1.12. reference client to the Classic build or that this has flown under the radar because there IS a leeway mechanic for spells *and only for spells* present in original 1.12..
---
Hi All,  
---
Small but skilled group of friends here looking for a home with an existing guild or to pool resources with another group(s) looking to start a guild.   
---
*5-8 total players LFG / Alliance / US / PvE or PvP Server / Evenings-Weekend Raids (\~7pm - \~10pm PST) / DKP/EPGP/Responsible Loot Council* 
---
Details about me:
---
* Warrior Main for 14 years
---
* I am in the beta and have leveled one Warrior to 29 and another to 34 so far
---
* I was an officer, main tank, and warrior class lead in vanilla in my guild &lt;Coup&gt; on Shadowsong-US. We had multiple server firsts and progressed from MC through mid-to-late Naxx. 
---
* I am still a member of that same guild on retail (all of the people coming with me are as well)
---
* I would prefer a main tank/leadership role in a guild, but I can be flexible and OT or DPS as needed
---
* I currently plan to go mining/engineering and switching to blacksmithing/engineering later when I can support the cost
---
* I am planning to take a week (or more) off of work around classic launch and hope to reach 60 within 3 weeks of launch.
---
A bit about my friends/guild members:
---
* Currently looking like 5-8 people will be joining me. Currently looking at 2-4 raiders in addition to myself.
---
* We also have some (2-4) casuals that want to hang out, level, and do dungeons, and while they are good players and have extensive vanilla experience, they don't want to drag a progression raid down if they can't commit to a schedule. 
---
We *are not* looking to be an insulated clique within your guild, we are looking to integrate fully and hope to find a great group that we can contribute positively to.
---
Things that we aren't okay with:
---
* Toxicity
---
   * Immaturity and goofing around is fine, but we'll pass on spergy, racist, sexist, homophobic or otherwise awful and demeaning behavior
---
* Streamer-focused communities. We hope to avoid streamer realms entirely if possible.
---
* Groups looking to emulate or be slavishly devoted to the "Private Server Meta". Most of us are fully aware of the PS meta, and we like to min/max, but there's limits to my sanity and listening to people gush over their private server speedrun record and the like is not interesting to me or my friends.
---
Final Note: 
---
* My friends and I considered starting our own guild but decided not to initially because we are concerned about the relatively small size of our initial base of people. 
---
* If you find yourself in a similar situation where you have a core group of friends or guild members that are relatively serious about play classic and want to do progression raiding, but you don't quite have the numbers to start on your own, and/or if you find the idea of running a 40 man guild on your own daunting, hit me up and maybe we can pool our resources start something together.   
---

Q: How do you reach the audience of people that no longer play any Blizzard products, no longer are involved in any mmorpg communities and don't follow any gaming news websites/forums?    
---
A: You don't, because they're not going to play Classic.
---
Classic+ is my dream. Would play it on my death bed.
---
Were you SM/Ruin or glass cannon Destro?
---
Nice! Definitely forgot about escape the fate -- great addition!
---
Talking to the players in party chat while you are running an instance or completing a quest together. Also being in a known non-beta guild. It is easy to tell the two apart just on playstyle alone as a noob or a new person would not have any knowledge of the game and would not know that the norm would be to quit on first wipe as it in retail. Retail = go go go, my game my way, vs. orginal vanilla (not all but a large amount) players who may have completed the quest already up to a certain point and stick around an extra 30 minutes until you are caught up to the part they are currently doing. Each has a certain method of doing things and it's easy to tell them apart.
---
7 maybe 8
---
Because your guild master will yell at you if you don't.
---
&gt; Why do people not try out private server?
---
For my part, I've simply never had any interest. They may be running vanilla content but they're not really the vanilla experience. Between the latency, the massive global population, the fiddling with respawn timers due to the aforementioned, the more min/max-y mentality of the community, the impermanence of the servers themselves and the hinky ways they're sometimes run (and monetized); it all adds up to something I just don't really have any motivation to play.
---
I have a similar reaction to the CoH server I read about the other day. That was a game I dearly loved and would give just about anything to play again - or even better, to play a sequel building on everything the first game got right. I don't think I'll ever forgive NCSoft for unceremoniously pulling the plug on it (and the team developing it) like they did. All that said, I'm just not really interested in trying that server and I have no idea why.

Just stop, it's pinsamt =/
---
Same, tbh.
---
CoC kiting is probably my favourite thing about playing a mage. This isn't an insignificant change, it's completely killing a core aspect of vanilla.
---
They have to change this...
---
Sure there is. Classic. 
---
You are telling me shit like 1200 dps over 6 seconds on an MC boss has nothing wierd going on? 
---
I changed to other servers (or is that different private servers) and saw drastically lower numbers too. Usually with actual boss fight length times.
---
I mean, I know private server numbers are only slightly off at most, but you can't deny that to someone who is used to like, the current WoW logs that make actual sense this might seem a bit fishy huh?
---
I don't think I was so much doubting 1.2k dps in Vanilla as much as I was doubting it was a normal occurrance. I mean that is like saying 1 million dps is the "high" in BFA because a DK did it with optimal gear and setup in the MDI.
---
&gt;I feel 6 months for each phase is pretty good
---
rofl
---
You got downvoted because you're 100% wrong (both about burden of proof and warlock summoning), and you're being rude at the same time.
---
Take it back! When I was 15 this set looked so cool! 😭
---
I appreciate the feedback! Why do you disagree with the reasons?  
---
" You should have your pet stored in instances " - Yes, but that is a plus thing to pay attention to, which can be a disadvantage for new players
---
" more or less every ranged class has to worry about kiting in PvP. " - I agree, but I honestly think that other ranged classes are better equipped to CC the enemy and start running the other way when getting close to mobs or blocking terrain in a world pvp situation.
---
Man, they booted that mentality out even in D2.  Aside from the 1 talent reset per difficulty the game shipped with, they eventually added a way to craft a consumable from mats from off bosses because rerolling a brand new character every time you wanted to tweak your talents was fucking dumb and everyone knew it.
---
Feel like you didn't watch the video.
---
Therapist: "Have you met them, face to face?" 
---
You: "I can hear them, its good enough for the blind."
---
No it means raids will go without.
---
Sure.  But it's not a requirement on 99.99% of raiding guilds.  I was in Naxx raiding guilds and we didn't do half of what OP is complaining about.  It wasn't necessary.  If more people hadn't quit because of BC announcement we would have progressed even further... But when some of your best geared people leave you do need a buff or two to make up the difference.
---
If you progress naturally and your guild doesn't get sniped it's best players you shouldn't be requiring these ridiculous conditions to raid.
---
Yes this works 100 %.
---
&gt;Do you disagree with my opinion that aggroing mobs and blocking terrain are a disadvantage for hunters?
---
No more so than other classes. You have track beasts, track hidden, feign death and frost trap to control the environment. Double points if you're NE and can open on some poor bastard from shadowmeld. I think you're greatly overplaying the downsides here. You don't need a football field to kite someone to death, and anything that aggro's you, can easily agro the enemy instead, or *next* when you do FD.
---
&gt;About pet happiness- Maybe you don't think it is a big deal, but it can be annoying for new players (who are the target of this post). Our opinions about pet happiness can differ, but its existence is a fact which I think if useful to point out to potential new players.

As opposed to Warriors ass-level-speed in leveling, Paladin's nearly-as-bad warrior leveling, Warlocks soulshards, Mage's perpetual OoM nature? etc. etc. This *is* vanilla we're talking about. Every class just about had some sort of class-based drawback. Pet happiness was just not on my radar as an issue worth concerning myself over.
---
&gt;About dungeons - I agree about reputation and item competition, but I still think that other classes are better at CC than a hunter.
---
Not really bud. Remember, you have 3 dps slots. Mage or warlock is a given, and you as a hunter are an enticing option as a mail wearer. You've also not address the wipe-saving potential of both your pet grabbing agro when needed, or FD resetting when possible. Additionally, hunter dps requires no ramp up time and is more than viable against other DPS classes. And finally, I disagree still with you claiming other classes have better CC in a way that makes them overall better than hunters. Ice trap knows no enemy-type restrictions. Sheep is pound for pound the best CC *in most circumstances*, but we've already established you're bringing a mage anyways, more than likely. A hunter is an easy pick for a 2nd CC, regardless of enemy type. You can also peel/kite a rogue mob out of the aoe pack, and freeze it safely out of range of splash damage.
---
No offense mate, but while its clear you did *play* a hunter, it sounds as if you weren't really a *good* hunter. I'm not saying that to be an ass either, because frankly the majority of players in Vanilla were bad, and demographically Hunter's had more bads-to-goods than other classes.
---
&gt;If you manage to snag a nice buff, you will be logged out until raid. 
---
Na, I won't be.
---
&gt;I have no doubts that Classic will overthrow retail. None. It's bound to happen.
---
You and I live in very different worlds.  Because I have no doubt that classic will become stagnant within the first year and retail will continue to dominate the mmo world.
---
No doubt of course that the opening is going to be monster.  We got private server people salivating over this, plus thousand of nostalgia people waiting, and all the retail folk playing looking to see what the fuss was all about with classic.
---
But the nostglia people?  A lot of these people are like me.  We haven't touched an mmo for years and its unlikely that we will have the time to play classic the way it was meant to be played.  We will be there to relive the nostalgia, but most will gone when the initial sub runs out because... we ain't got time for this shit.
---
Retail players?  A lot of them will run straight back to their retail characters within the first week.  Why?  Because classic will be too slow for them.  Like with the nostalgia crowd, they don't got time for it.  There is a good chance that a lot of retail players have bought a lot of boost and other things for their current characters as well.  To throw away all of that money just to play a character for which they cannot spend any money on to progress?  Not likely.  Retail players will flock back to retail because Classic won't be able to offer them a game that make sense to their needs.
---
So are really left with?  Predominately: private server people plus a small percentage of retail players and a small percentage of nostalgia people.
---
The reason why vanilla eventually turned into retail is because that's where the money trail led them to.  Hardcore gamers don't pay for shit.  They pay their subs, but beyond that, they are willing to play through thick and thin to get the rest.  Casual gamers?  These are the guys that are willing to toss a few bucks to catch up the hardcore people.  So if you follow the money trail, vanilla in the long run won't be profitable.  History says, casual games make more money than hardcore games.  And if Classic doesn't rule the bank, then it won't be bigger than retail.
---
IF by some miracle you are right and hardcore takes over this casual mmo world in regards to player base and popularly... what we will see is this:
---
"You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain."
---
IF retail starts to falter and people flock to Classic... well, that is really bad for business.  Because that means no is buying boost, or mounts, or pets, or whatever anymore.  And has Activision keen on making less money?  Hell no they ain't.  If no one is there anymore because retail is dying, then guess what?  The store comes to Classic.  Slowly, but surely, Classic over time will begin to resemble what we know today as retail.  The money trail does not lie.  If Classic is &gt; than Retail in regards to player base and popularity... Classic will then begin to sell boost, and pets, and mounts, etc.  My guess, they will keep things like dual specs on the money market as well.  
---
So if you want Classic to remain the game you love, you better hope it doesn't become bigger than Retail.  But like I said, once the dust settles, I have no doubts that Retail will reign supreme.

An option that I highly suggest is getting skinning instead of engineering for the first 20-40 levels (so long as you aren't twinking), so that you can sell the leather on AH for a bit of extra dough to work with. If you only use it to level 20 you don't have to get journeyman, although journeyman is pretty cheap to get anyways. Just save all of the mining materials you gather in your bank or something and pull them out later. The only issue with this is that you won't know if you need to farm mining a bit more to get whatever better thing in engineering (i.e. running out of copper just a few levels before being able to use your supply of silver), so you might have to go back to some spots and grind that out slightly more or buy the mats on AH.

tHaNk YoU yOu ToO

Lol you clearly know fuck all
---
I grabbed the clips from Xani's stream but the other vods from the BG show the same thing. 
---
He had at least 2 warriors and a rogue 'executing' him at points and survived consistently at 1hp.
---
You can literally see multiple overkill messages in the combat log when he hits 1 hp.
---
&gt; You are telling me shit like 1200 dps over 6 seconds on an MC boss has nothing wierd going on?
---
It's actually closer to 1200 dps over the course of a several minute fight. You're sorting the data wrong and I can't be held responsible for your poor evaluation of freely provided information.
---
Raid heal as 0/31/21?
---
If you manage to get all the world buffs and all the consumables in 15 minutes you're essentially superman, it would be very impressive to say the least!
---
Only their death will bring you honor!
---
&gt; doesn’t spoil it for the majority of players
---
how would someone else's progression spoil anything for others?  
---
if you aren't even ready for MC how does BWL, or AQ40, being released change anything for you.  
---
It's not like MC goes away when BWL is released  
---
if we're being completely honest here, content releases actually help casuals catch up. Now there are pugs, now raids are easier, now your 5mans go faster, ect.
---
There was a horde premade on my server (Gilneas) that would get near instant queues due to faction imbalances and they would pick and choose who they went up against.  When the BG would pop one or two of them would enter and if they were going against an alliance premade the rest of them would decline to enter.
---
They pretty much just farmed unorganised PuGs all day every day.
---
Yeah I think WoW did that to itself. It could have had a better balance of competition with LoL if most people could participate in it. It just bullied away PvP'ers by mistreating it from the start. It's was acceptable in Vanilla, but never sustainable. Ilvl and stats needed to be removed. You could make an arguement for Gear Uses. But the current disadvantadge is to great to overcome. Also there is not a system like LoL where you can play against other of the same lvl's in a well balanced team equiped with several roles. WoW PvP is a chaotic cluster fuck where ultimately we all get pwned by the PvE'ers.
---
WoW never got killed.. It still lives. It just widened its player base when it was so succesfull. Allot went to Aoin. Some came back and some stayed, but WoW would be different game forever and their original design philosophy would be doubted. 
---
MMO's are not out of gaming. They just have different names. But games like The Division, Desitiny, Monster Hunter World ect are still very popular. WoW is grown older and has a model that has remained a dependent source of income. Allot of income. The game is still getting new players. It's slowly dieing due to its age and bad management. 
---
Imo.. WoW should have been released on Console this generation and it would prob have been the biggest game on the console of the generation. You could have even gotten creative on it and there would have been a ton of options. Final Fantasy is a pretty decent game and did not only do well based on its name. It ofc helped getting attention.
---
For sure, I did that as a shaman back in the day as 0/30/21 and it was fine, but I’d like to be focused on actually healing and getting the most out of through talents.  I won’t be pushing tier 2 or 3, but definitely UBRS, DM and .5 for fun when that hits.   Possibly pugs of MC and AQ20.
---
As far as I know and remember, supported by the patch notes, there IS a leeway mechanic present in Vanilla for spells *and only for spells*.
---
The melee leeway mechanic was added way after Cata. I remember somewhere in the other thread, reference to WoD patch notes mentioning the melee leeway specifically.
---
And of course memory is not proof in this, but I quit wow completely at the end of Cata and never remember having experienced fluctuating melee range when moving - not moving.
---
Not really, it just means your guild has a good summoning infrastructure.
---
Yes. I believe they also get hit from farther away from other melees as well though, but I could he totally wrong on that.
---
THIS! So yeh, I joined wow early in TBC and stopped playing in Nov 14, right after WoD released. This wow classic, which I just discovered today, has me pretty excited 😁
---
Oh nice. I didn't even notice that!
---
Feels like it's probably some kind of spirit of redemption bug.
---
Is there a macro that auto-repeats, or do you have to keep clicking it?
---
So according to my testing you need round about 11/12 hours to hit level 20 of you know what you are doing. If you don't know the game then it will take a lot more time. If you level like a pro I would say 28/30, if you are new to the game you will barely hit the 20s
---
apply rank 1 rejuvs and let them purge their mana away. gg
---
been in quite some hardcore guilds. Our hunters used pets.  Except when they didn't use them because the particular boss fight made pets useless. In other words:  you are right.
---
It's a bad thing for RPGs, yeah. There is pride in forging a character that you had to suffer for. Pures in games are so fun because they're so magikarpy. A pure healer had a TERRIBLE time leveling but would be all the sweeter at a high level as a result.
---
So very my perspective and what I miss most about wow 😁
---
D2 as in Diablo 2 or Destiny 2? Because Diablo 2 didn't allow stat/skill respecs last I checked.
---
yikes
---
Experience counts for a lot. My first 60 took 26 days. My second took 10. Even today, my 1-10 times vary between 1h35 and 8h45 depending on whether I’m speed-levelling or chilling and working on my professions. If this is your first time, I recommend taking your time and enjoying the journey. This isn’t retail where the game is designed entirely around the end-game experience. This is an experience to be savoured.
---
Lol dude what?  5 phases at 6 months each is LONGER than the original vanilla timeline from November 2004- January 2007.  Why would they need to make it longer than when the actual game launched?  3 months per phase is long enough.
---
mainly bosses I guess. Void can tank level instance bosses, if you watch your agro a bit. that plus the fact that warlok aoe is at least respectable.

Add health/soulstone for sticky situations and you got yourself a 5th group member

Yeah, I've had to put the pet away for specific mechanics/pulls, but never the entire run. Gimping your DPS is a good way to fail when progressing. If someone's pet keeps killing the raid, you replace them.
---
Yeah there will definitely be a bunch of cool unique events like this on the streamer server, but will it be worth the  “Twitch community?” *epic rap battle voice* YOU DECIDE

Of all places I learned about isochrony first from an impossibly date 1930's British vid. Realizing that to be understood in another language you have to adopt its rhythm more than the local accent has been a total game changer.
---
I think the idea of World Firsting WoW Classic content is laughable.
---
Personally, I'm in favour of them being removed when you enter a raid instance.
---
It's the easiest solution to what is obviously a problem.
---
See my other reply above.
---
Yes, because your girlfriend liking the first 15 seconds of one of Vanilla's songs means that current retail WoW is doomed.

Come off of it.

I just got my human warrior to 36,got whirlwind, now I'm really Ripping things to pieces.

There's no way I could be waiting till August without nrthdale, I don't know how you very patient people do it.

Just play a class/race/faction that's different from what you plan to play on classic and it won't spoil anything.

Priest mains everywhere yelling #nochanges

It's the Steve Jobs quote. Part of what made older game development so much better is that the development teams were typically given a lot more free reign over where they wanted to go from a creative standpoint. This meant they could pour their hearts and souls into the development of the product and make the best product possible. As the success grows and the financial impacts start to be known, the financial stakeholders/shareholders start to get more involved in the process and instead of turning out a product with the primary questions being "How can we make this more fun?" it becomes "How can we get more people liking this so it can make us more money?" More than a decade later, Classic Wow became BFA thanks to this mentality. 
---
Companies continue to ignore Steve's wisdom. I don't even like Steve Jobs but damn is he right about this concept.
---
You convinced me to roll a hunter in Classic.

Why the rush to lvl doe

**EU \[Alliance\]**
---
**What i am looking for:**
---
* Raiding Guild
---
* Guild activity , social aspect  , having fun.
---
* 2 Days of raiding per week (8pm - 11pm  MEZ/MESZ)
---
* EU Alliance -&gt; Server i dont care
---
* Guild  that allows off meta stuff (Since i need a challenge from the classes  for myself) -&gt; Will be playing a ret pala or feral druid (Yeah i will  heal , offtank whatever is needed and will min/max to be viable and not  dead weight that needs to be carried)
---
**About me:**
---
* Did  play WoW in vanilla (As a rogue , in all content from MC - AQ40), did  play in BC/WotlK activ. And some times in Legion &amp; BFA (always  raiding to max that is for me possible without a guild). So i am a  multiple expansion active raider. -&gt; Multiple high end raiding exp in  other mmorpgs aswell (SWtoR , Eso)
---
* I know my shit (class) and when i suck with it i will learn it . I will come prepared for raids and will help my Team.
---
* I  am father and working from home. So except for the raiding days i will  be playing on separate hours every day (Sometimes in the morning,  sometimes late night and so on)
---
* I  am a social guy, so discord is nice. Trahs talking is nice. Im always  here for some open pvp , bgs , dungeons or just funny stuff. Playing  should be fun. But i want to get the raids done and i hope we can be a  little serious here. If we are good and beat everything with yolo, i  dont mind if we are talking shit when we do it. I dont like drama, but  when it happens i try to solve things rather then fight like a dick.
---
\-&gt; PM me, comment and we can talk

Warcraft lore before then basically didn't exist.

No im only intrested in classic as it was ive seen what happens when they start adding expacs i dont want to live threw that bs again

Well, given that that my 256RAM, intel Pentium 3 processor, and whatever the hell graphics cards my dell came with ran vanilla into tbc just fine 15 years ago, I have no doubts that a 4gb ram and i5 would be able to handle classic just as well.
---
I state many points in the post. Which ones do you disagree with exactly?
---
This is a great point you bring up I hadn't thought of before.
---
I've been trying to figure out when they would logically bring out the next phase. I would be content with phase 1 lasting 6 months then every other phase after that being 3 months apart. I would rather have them space the phases farther apart than closer that way we can enjoy 1.5 years - 2 years of consistent content release.
---
We'll see...
---
How is a year and a half blazing fast?  The game isn't OVER in a year and a half.  Just all of the content is out in a year and a half.  If you're too slow to clear the content in 3 month phases (of which the second doesn't introduce any raids, which makes MC and Ony 6 months) then ok?  The content isn't gone.  You can still do it.  People will still be playing 6 months after Naxx comes out.
---
I play nelf and I’m always above human rogues.
---
Raided as a hunter in Vanilla. It can get somewhat boring for the optimal rotation, depending on your weapon. When I got GM Bow it was a lot better as it felt like I could do more while weaving the quick AS.  
---
The main thing to remember, is you will not just strictly be balls-to-the-wall DPSing. You will need to manage threat depending on the tank's level, and you will likely have special assignments like kiting and pulling. Classic raiding is less about everyone insane DPS, and more about honoring mechanics that your class fits - for Rogues, Mages, DPS Warriors, that's their role, and unless you're one of those classes/specs, don't worry about the damage meter too much.
---
I think I had the AGP version back in 2005. I don't think motherboards have AGP slots anymore.
---
That piece of shit used to make cs:source freeze all the fucking time and make me hard reboot constantly. And there was like no support for it. What a piece of shit. First and last ATI card i ever bought. Hope the lead designer on the team for that graphics card found work outside of engineering cause he sucks at it.
---
Well the main issue with the old AV was caused more from the decaying honor you got for killing the same player in a 24 hour period. After 10 kills of the same player they were no longer worth any honor at that point the ones that had been killed or counted towards most people in the BG on the opposite faction were effectively just meat shields, gave no honor and were just there to disrupt the opposing faction. This generally happened 30 minutes - 1 hour into the game. At that point no one was worth honor any longer and the honor rewards for AV was a lot lower compared to the other BGs based on time invested.
---
( That being said, if you came across the same players in multiple BGs in the same day you ran into the same problem. )
---
Anecdotal evidence is nothing. If you'd been playing Human, you'd have ~5% more damage.
---
I remember my first video card.
---
I'm fine if each phase takes two years. I have other things to do besides play WoW. The Monster Zero and lawn isn't gonna take care of itself.
---
It's a bit like D&amp;D crossed with Warhammer. It costs a shit ton of money and then you get to play in your imagination.
---
Yeah I think I am done here, sorry.
---
But classic does have spell batching...
---
Still rushing. In ten years, the game will still exist. Why rush to phase 6 then proceed with 50 years of no updates?
---
Majordomo Executus in MC can drop an item that starts the quest for a hunter (Ancient Petrified Leaf, I think it is called).
---
You take it to the petrified treants in Felwood and it starts an epic quest chain that involves tracking down invisible demons across the world. Once you find them you have to kill them, but they basically one-shot you or your pet, so you have to kite them until they die. If anyone tries to aid you they despawn.
---
Reward is the epic hunter bow (Rhok'delar) and staff (Lok'delar).
---
I feel like melee would never be able to attack anyone if there wasn't. I understand there are patch notes referring to spells leeway.

Funny alot everyone is assuming this guy is straight, i read the dps/heal thing as top/bottom

Absolutely. It's really understated how prosody is so much more important than getting every phoneme just right when it comes to sounding like a native speaker.
---
Different engine though. Just because the game looks the same doesn’t mean it doesn’t have different hardware requirements. 
---
From what I’ve heard it is much easier to run than BFA but more expensive to run than vanilla was
---
Post should be removed as this has been fixed for a while.
---
The slower releases of phases creates a meta like you see in Beta currently. You temporarily suspend the rat-race and everyone just has a blast running around in full T1 or people who are slower attempt to catchup during this lulled time.
---
I’m not sure why everyone here is rushing towards the finish line.
---
both in fact.  Or to be precise  DS/Ruin too.    SM/Ruin is priority early in your raid career, and the Destro build is really fun once you are already decked out in decent epics to melt some faces.  (and by that time it usually isn't that important if your raid dps goes down a bit, as everything is on farm)  I would switch back to Sm/Ruin  or  DS/ ruin when we did speed record runs or new content was released. Ds ruin was the best once you had really good gear.
---
I mean, i am straight...but ok.
---
There'll be logging websites, so having something 'official' wouldn't really make any difference. Anyone who cares enough to try will be using and watching the unofficial websites.
---
**AT YOUR SIDE MY LADY**

Because if you spread out MC and Ony to over a year you'd be bored out of your mind?
---
Hey now, fishing and random mob farming in AV is a legit way to pass the time.
---
This. Ferales still gives me the old wow feels. It was my favorite place to just explore back in the day and I still level there for nostalgia sake.
---
Or people who hate Ben Stiller as an actor.
---
You realize that the majority of people wanting to play Classic are people who originally played it in Vanilla right? They were probably 12-18 when they picked it up... which makes them early/mid thirties now. Most of them will be married with a kid or two and a full time job. That leaves very little time for WoW. 
---
Most people will be able to put in 10-20 hours of WoW a week. That's going to be average. So fuck off with your whole "lack of playing time" bullshit... people probably have a life as opposed to you. 
---
Blizzard should cater the release of the next phase to the majority of players - when the MAJORITY of people have a level 60, when the MAJORITY of people have run MC a few times, etc.
---
have sex
---
I'm surprised no one thought of "Soil - Halo" while talking about WoW Vanilla
---
Diablo 2, and yes, you get 1 respec per difficulty from literally the very first quest in Act 1, and now we have [Token of Absolution](https://diablo2.diablowiki.net/Respecialization) so you can go farm up materials and craft it in the cube to respec as much as you're willing to farm/trade for.
---
Rip Enhancement shamans :(  
---
On a serious note though, really awesome stuff! Will recommend to the guidlies! :D
---
Look at the DPS composition for the top parsing mages. Every single one in probably the top 50 has ignite rolling on the boss. The mages that don't have the Ignite debuff are doing damage in the 800-900 range, IIRC. I'm willing to be wrong on this one if you can link me logs to prove otherwise.
---
If they don't do TBC a team will gear up for a massive fresh TBC launch and it will be the biggest PS that has ever happened.  
---
And then predictably Blizzard will launch their own after seeing how successful it is.   
---
I think it's far more likely Blizzard just does it on their own straight up though.
---
Nah, mate. I only get to play on Weekends. I'll be lucky to hit 60 in 6 months.
---
Weird. Like a bug with power word shield, healing and spell batching. 
---
I wonder if you could heal itself with spirit of redemption and keep yourself alive lol.
---
If you wipe in a pack pull just past the mobs YOU SUK!  But if u gquit the dungeon becuz of it, YOU REALLY SUK! These retale newbs need to act like they've got sum sense and take response abilities in dungeons!!!
---
It was my favorite by far.  I would farm it over and over at 60.   All human mobs meant tons of money, cloth, drops to DE, etc.  They were organized well in small groups and the only downside is that humans run, but the casters could be burned quickly also.
---
this is gold
---
Way ahead of you.

Brazzers set... gives bonuses on unequip

They should.  Anything they would have changed before should be changed.

this is cute because its just like the old EJ DPS calc

If both targets were moving melee range was an extra 2 yards, this was implemented to help buffer against latency melee issues afaik

With no experience or practice or planning? 15, maybe 20.

World buffs have pro's and cons. Mostly cons but ill highlight the biggest pro.
---
Time spent during raid nights will decrease drastically. 
---
The dealbreaker for most of the filthy casuals (myself included) will most definately be the grind. Blasting through the content with world buffs will alleviate the pressure on a household as where without, you'd be spending 2 or 3 raidnights while with buffs most guilds will do one main day where MC/BWL/Ony will be the priority in the beginning and after it will become AQ/BWL and other raids in optional other days.
---
I like it.
---
Everyone acts like all this is brand new when they've had access to the same content for 15 years. "Hype" is like a drug. You're all being brainwashed/tricked into believing you're going to experience something fresh and exciting. After a week to a month it's not going to feel that way anymore. That nostalgia you feel? Sadly, by playing Classic again all that nostalgia becomes non-existent. Our love for something in our past, when revisited creates new memories and replaces the old. We're literally going to be ruining our untouchable love for this game and franchise by meddling with time-travel. Our present selves will perceive the game in a new way and we'll forget how we felt about it prior to it becoming our current addiction. What I'm saying is - the Warcraft franchise is about to fade into the abyss, for it is no longer a love for something nostalgic, it's a love for something present. Most of us avoid popular things in the present. World of Warcraft will be looked at the same way people look at Fortnite right now because it will be talked about by everyone. People will begin questioning why people think the game is so good. You just walk around and do some quests until you're level 60 in 5 months? Wow. Just imagine, in 5-10 years people will be nostalgic about Fortnite. It's a never ending cycle of nostalgia for something in our past. Bringing back Classic was a mistake. Our love for the Warcraft franchise will dwindle and crumble before our eyes the moment we get bored of playing Classic. For some of us, that might take 1 month. For others, 2 years. Either way, we will be replacing new memories with our old ones. We have doomed this franchise. Turn back now, the apocalypse is upon us.

From what I saw on a few other posts it's using the engine from Legion, so whatever those hardware specs are. Could be wrong but that's just what I've seen.
---
I would like it more if honor was more normalised, so you could pick which bg you liked based on the gameplay rather than which one gave more rewards.
---
Probably way too unrealistic and out there, but I'd like to have a character of each class leveled to 60 - and even gear them out in full post-Naxx BiS gear.
---
Of course I realise that's probably not so likely, but it's at that stage I'd feel as if I've "completed" Classic WoW....and I'd probably still keeping leveling alts even after all that.
---
Dont listen to this guy, enchanting is not usefull while leveling, the reason you pick skinning is to vendor the skins for gold for mount at 40. enchanting will make you lose money unless you research what disenchants into what compared to the vendor price. just skinning and go go go
---
The problem with all these bis lists is they invariably are based off some old private server list which had different itemisation or completely wrong stat weights - as a result there are generally several entries per class which are not bis. If you want to find out the true bis, you should go to the classic class discords and ask there.
---
Are we assuming the servers will stay up? Cause otherwise.... maybe level 5.
---
Yes, and I’m open to suggestions.
---
Thanks that helps!!
---
It doesn't work and someone else is fucking around in the file??
---
Thanks that helps!
---
White teeth 😀
---
Staying feral til 60 and then going resto should be just fine. Not being resto in sub 60 instance basically just means youll use more mana every pull. So more mana breaks.
---
Level as feral and just collect healing gear then you can jump right into 60 content as a healer.  You might be kinda undergeared but undergeared healers aren't so bad for dungeons.
---
I think you are overestimating how much time your normal player will have.
---
Let’s say your avg. player in classic was 14, which makes them around 30 now. If they have a wife, kids, career, home, etc...they can maybe game 10 hours a week.
---
This means this person will take 6 months to level to 60 if the average /played time is 10 days.
---
LOL you're the asshat going around calling people selfish because theyre trying to encourage Blizzard to cater to the masses instead of the one. 
---
Get some therapy.
---
The question was "how can someone say they don't like streamers but still use them to make content." That was the answer. It's possible to make fun content as a hobby, or you know, just for the fun of it... without it being a job.
---
Hyjal.
---
Maybe it was like that and we all misremember. It's all coming back to me now... Priests use to have cheat death but it was a hidden skill at a certain level. Just like warrior Regen and the tauren hitbox.
---
I try, brush em 3 times a day, floss at night and rinse after I eat.
---
I'd get fired if my boss knew how much time I wasted today making this in Paint.
---
No need to assume. They already leaned towards casuals and that's how retail ended up the way it is.

They're not inconsistent at all.  However you just contradicted yourself in this reply, weird.

right, but that doesn't mean in wow classic there won't be raids going in before the first reset to get tranqshot on their hunters with level 54 priests.
---
&gt; I would hope that Blizzard would create new servers for those wanting to progress into TBC. Giving players the option to “one-way” export their Classic server characters to the new TBC servers, leaving those that want to remain in Classic the option.
---
Honestly the biggest problem i foresee with this is that theres a good chance the Classic servers will be left with significantly fewer people and end up pretty dead.
---
Granted, you have that issue no matter what if they release BC, whether its new servers or character copies/moves. (unless they actually make everyone go on to BC, so the server wouldnt really bad 'Classic' anymore....which i dont see them doing)
---
I dunno.  Thats still probably over 2 years away no matter what they do.  Im just going to block it out and enjoy the game when it comes out :)

I generally have a very stiff ignore the player if they are a shit player rule and I know a TON of other people who do the same. When theres no longer a hundred thousand people and you're stuck to your server pool, and you're an ass or a rage quitter, yet wonder why you never get a response or are randomly ignored by players or peoples just "Seems to not see your spam for a dungeon/guild". Hopefully now you'll now why.
---
We had an 03 running a wow guild back in the Navy circa 2005. I was an e3. Things did get weird, so it didnt last.
---
But shareholders weren't the ONLY reason why vanilla turned into classic.  WoW WAS losing subscribers.  And if you followed the money trail, casual gaming was the way to go in order to keep the game alive.  The reason why WoW has been around for 15 years is because they followed the money.  If they followed the "hearts" of the developers and consumers, WoW would have died by the time MoP hit.
---
Not saying this concept is wrong, but its also not 100% right as it wasn't the only factor.  What consumers want has also changed.  This is mmo's that play themselves - lineage, or any mobile mmo - are able to make as much as they have.  Its why twitch is as popular as it is.  Haven't you ever thought about why twitch became so popular?  If someone told you that you could make thounsands a week by letting others watch you play a videogame without any context, you would think its the dumbest thing you ever heard.  But its not.  It works.  It works because kids these days would rather watch someone play videogames than to actually play themselves.
---
So its not just stakeholders came in and took the life out of the game.  Consumers changes as well.  And there would be no life at all of the game didn't change with the consumers.
---
I've been conflicted about War Mode. On the one hand it brought me back to a feeling of great WPvP battles. War Mode + World Quests and Incursions have spawned plenty of large conflicts, and with no flying (until 8.2) it reminds me of old school WPvP engagements. I don't know about other experiences, but people were pretty hyper aggressive in War Mode, at least at first.
---
Then shard balancing got screwed up, Alliance bailed on War Mode, Horde who don't care for PvP jumped in to get an easy 10% bonus, unbalanced incentives were introduced to bring in reward-chasing Alliance, reward-chasing Horde got angry, and it just became a whinefest within the community on both sides. I wonder what would have happened if they had no buff at all from the start? Like I just want people in War Mode who are only in it to PvP, not get buffs or items. It's like playing a game of basketball, but half of both teams hate sports. It becomes no fun for anyone.
---
its about getting out of the melee range. the added leeway, that was only added to melee in cata+ increases the melee range by about 50%. (usual &lt;5 yards + ~2.6 yards leeway) when it is active.
---
Lag already has a similar effect from time to time making it harder to distinguish between them. 
---
The main problem is: we have leeway from cata+, but obviously not class balance from cata+.  Which throws some things upside down.
---
Stv
---
It's like game theory... If you think they will never be able to kill you back you gank them because they are taking mobs you need, if you think it would be a back and forth of them waiting until you are low and killing you then it's faster to let them live and do the quest concurrently. Sometimes I finish my quest and gank the other faction guy there as I'm leaving
---
This is about tbc
---
Only expansion you will have to buy is BFA to play live. Don’t even have to pay retail for the base game. Comes with the sub. They changed this I Legion or WoD I can’t remember.
---
Classic also comes with the sub. So 15 bucks a month and you can play Classic. 
---
Only real pay to win now is the token/gold system and gold means almost nothing now...

---
Totally untrue. Get out of your delusion.
---
Wont matter, since you cant rename our character and there wont be server transfers.
---
It really won't effect anything tho
---
&gt; It took most people 2 months to hit 60
---
Its still likely to be that way.  I really doubt the majority of the population will be speed leveling.
---
Maybe it wont be 2 months, but even with playing every night expect to take a good month, and even with a job that requires 10.5 hours of my day (minimum) i still have more free time than most because of being single/childless.
---
&gt; It's just simply not a problem to the *vast* majority of players.
---
Emphasis added, and I entirely agree. Those who want to play at the bleeding edge are going to do as they've always done. Designing the game around them is how you get Wildstar.
---
I'm going to role on +dmg and healing if it's an upgrade

Tinfoil hat much? Like when we send weapons to Syria and isis grows strong it’s unrelated...
---
I can see where he comes from though.  I thought the same on vanilla till right after LVL 30.   When a gnome mage set me straight after I lost a goldshire duel and said "meh hunters are more for PvE and not that good in PvP". After getting cursed out and yelled at by the gnome he showed me the way. I've been spreading his hunter gospel to any hunter that was willing to learn.
---
&gt;I wouldn’t mind a nerdy chick that UNDERSTANDS the concept of games and MMO’s and not the fake “I’m a gamer girl” facade
---
Dude I wish you good luck with that. What you described kinda applies to me too, people usually don't think I'm a heavy gamer and I'm proud of it. 
---
Finding a girl that understands games has to be great. Maybe you'll be luckier than me, because my second, and last so far, girlfriend I had in my life broke with me because, you know she hated games. She thought they were stupid and for kids (just like my father by the way used to say), even though I was playing games only in my free time and when we had a date or something, I was always there on time. Like I always found time for her, I never stayed home so I could raid or something.
---
However for some reason she hated games so much she eventually told me if I won't stop with games she will break with me. I thought she was joking but nope, dead serious. So I told her it's my business what do I do in my free time and this is how we broke up. I was pretty fucked from that for weeks.

What? The manual was like half backstory that built upon more and more epic things and places you encountered in the game. Things like finding the tomb of Gul'dan, it was intense.
---
Although, if you didn't play the first few games or read the manual it would seem like it.
---
Harz fear
---
Blizzard has every intention of figuring out a way to convert Classic players over to Retail.
---
Lmao what a deluded clown
---
Of course I remember your name =)
---
Great work! Grim Batol raid would be fun to have in game.
---
Classes do kind of dictate what you do though... Do you want to heal? Playing a warlock probably isn't going to be the right class then.
---
Now I imagine epic level 1 battles because 200 people had the same idea. I would watch.
---
Guys... I think Cdew is playing shaman right?
---
Agreed, I’ll go back to my lair even though food never comes in by itself
---
Yes, exactly. It was all in the manual.
---
This was my answer. Stranglethirn has the nice Forrest look with lots of water/fishing/animals/beach. Even cooler if you’re a horde (or troll) in my opinion.

It, like many guilds if yore, was formed in 2005, and spanned several expansions.
---
I saw this happening to the enemy team watching Hydramist's stream as well. I think he reported it and hopefully others did as well.
---
Factor in congestion and if on a PVP realm the threat of attack.  That’s the real keys to the city here.  20-25 is what I’m thinking a high end estimate would be on a PVP realm with a far more realistic outlook of 15-20.  Then the next 12 hours will see diminishing levels per hour based on higher exp requirements so if you’re VERY lucky you’d be hitting 28-30 in the 24 hour range.
---
Thanks. This conversation is so much better since you got here.
---
I used to nuthug the guild Nurfed and Vhell tanked Golemag as disc. he had a lot of tank gear though. I'm sure there's a 30 pixel video out there of it.
---
“Why is there one in the tree” 😂 no changes!
---
If you know what you're doing and 1000+ people aren't doing the exact same thing at the exact same time.
---
I think they are releasing a 15 year old game, that doesn't have all the quality of life "improvements" that people have gotten used to
---
Hunters biggest strength in PvP, is their ability to kite and abuse their movement speed and range advantage. Thus a hunter prefers unlimited kiting range of wPvP, as opposed to a duel; where they can’t kite duel to limited dueling range. Mob Aggro is so easy to avoid. Hunters are extremely strong in BGs as well, and actually have many tools to get distance when someone comes close: Trap, wingclip, shattershot, BM stun, counterattack, PvP trinket if you are snared.. 
---
Pet feeding is not an issue. Once your pet is loyalty lvl 6, you rarely need to feed your pet. 
---
Hunters are in demand for dungeons. CC is very important for dungeons. Only a few classes have reliable dungeon CC. Did you know that hunter trap is the only CC that works on EVERY type of mob? Try to have your mage sheep an Undead mob, or have your rogue sap an elemental. Oh wait those don’t work? Trap does. Did you know that some very important dungeons like UBRS, prefer hunters for their kiting abilities? Hunters who actually know how to use their pet can also help with offtanking, like if a mob gets pulled onto the healer. Oh and Hunter dps is actually very good, top 3 in the early phases. 
---
Ammo: If you make a habit out of refilling when you vendor stuff you will never run out of ammo. 1 less bag slot isn’t that annoying. Warlocks have 1 less as well; and many classes carry multiple sets of gear and/or regents in their bags so they have limited bag space as well.
---
Genuine question, why did you *not* cooperate? People like to make the rankers group out to be some sort of malicious evil group that is sabotaging games or whatever, but I've been in plenty of them both back in retail and on private servers and really the group is just a collection of people currently ranking. There aren't any hard demands other than:
---
- Don't be a dick. And trust me, frequent PvP'ers have high standards when it comes to classifying someone as a dick.
---
- Respect the order. This is only really applicable to R12/13 people. If you're going for #1 standing as anything below that you're just being a dick as it barely makes you progress any faster through the ranks while you are blocking a guy nearly there.
---
People seem to get all upset about the order, but really this whole thing is no different than just waiting in line anywhere at all. I really don't understand why people seem hellbent to classify this as malicious.
---
Frankly the only time that there is any reason at all for drama to occur is when two guys hit R13 at the same time and both want to go for R14. That's a pretty awkward situation, but also one that generally can be worked out if players are just upfront about their aims well ahead of time.
---
And anyone R11+ is exceedingly likely to get invited to the PvP premade simply on account of making a name for themselves + how frequently they're online, so there's tons of opportunities to make your aim clear and establish a plan in advance. People are generally more than willing to work with whatever your desired rank is as long as you don't try to cut in line.
---
Not that it’s relevant on this sub, but it was Syrian *rebels* that were sent weapons by the United States. Not Syria.
---
But then spell batching kicks in and he shields himself. lol. "It's seems I've died...I'd better shield myself... There we are good as new "
---
You're welcome.
---
Well cost of dev have skyrocketed since the mid 2000s, wow was already suffering from it and that is part of the reason there were never wow killers.    
---
The more expensive the less risk adverse the studios and editors become, less risk means less trying things that can be very divisive since it is going to cut your profit and exclude some players. 
---
   But great games are the ones that provides a vision without concession.
---
Im willing to bet that the average time to 60% will be significantly faster (tho not twice as fast) - a lot more people will be using addons and people are A LOT more used to googling stuff when they are stuck.
---
Didn’t write the Syrian state did I? 🥳
---
Can’t help it, the people need to know
---
Well said!
---
&gt;Just remember that this probably won’t happen ever again  
---
They are going to keep making phase 1 servers down the line to make new seasons for players that didn't experience day 1 classic.  That way people will always have a fresh server experience.  There is no source, it is just what is going to happen to keep subscribers that really enjoy the fresh server experience.
---
At fresh 60 gear levels cc will still be needed regardless of knowledge. A tank can't eat 3-4 mobs hitting on em
---
Not Cdew
---
My favorite zone has mountain giant poops in it.
---
I believe it will be a competitive spec outside of speedrunning. I believe that a paladin player has a higher importance on consumables than other classes, but doesn't have to farm disproportionately more, it's just vital they have them in the first place. 
---
If you're looking at hyper competitive clears, I don't believe a ret is necessary, the arguement that holy overlaps on utility on a stronger spec is true and I wont deny it. HOWEVER, I'm all but sure that ret can pull more than its own weight in progression and on farm.
---
During progression, having the extra cleanse, BoP, auras, and other utility is really fantastic, coming from a DPS slot. Pal doesn't lose huge DPS by using its utility, it just can't really offheal without gimping its DPS, but the SP build has very good offhealing for emergencies. I would say that ret DPS on progression does viable damage, it's always beat by 3 or 4 classes, but it can do its job, and it comes with the intangible benefit of being a support class as well, so a good ret can come in fucking CLUTCH on progress. 
---
On farm, the shorter the boss fights get, the better Scrolls get, and the more ham you can go on mana consumption. Ret is mana gated pretty hard, and while you have control over expendature via upranking and downranking  consecration, the more max rank spells you can spam, the better off you are. The shorter the fight, the better off Paladin is. Similar to prog, you can also allocate mana to a partially supportive role and can be added to the cleanse or other utility assignments. 
---
The DPS is upper middle of the pack overall, but it's good enough to warrant a raid slot. It's better on progression due to the intangibles and support kit. A well timed LoH, BoP, or offhealing can save the raid on hectic fights. The less the guild knows a fight, the better ret's intangible value is. 
---
Paladin is a generally really fucking useful class, the question for ret viability was never in utility, it was always in raw DPS througput, and now we've figured that out. I think the class has more useful potential outside of sims and in raid encounters where they can both DPS and support as needed. Most of my points have been on througput and overall DPS, rather than utility, but you cannot overlook it when assessing ret. 
---
I seriously doubt speedrunning or hardcore guilds will be playing many, if any, rets, simply because they don't need to. That said, hardcore guilds don't usually bring upper middle of the pack specs in any expansion, they stack the best of the best and say fuck it to everything else, even if upper middle of the pack is perfectly fine for 95% of guilds. IE in Legion 7.1, Frost DK was middle of the pack, UH was bottom, super hardcore guilds didnt run Frost DKs, even though they were perfectly viable for the content. 
---
Spelladin looks a lot like TBC paladin, where you dont do as much damage as pure classes, but have fucking incredible support capacity ontop of pretty solid damage.
---
Of course i remember you, i even found a screenshot:  [https://imgur.com/a/lJCtX2U](https://imgur.com/a/lJCtX2U)
---
Flagged. Hah!
---
is that for demon seed quest?
---
It's mostly used to overcome certain hurdles, Loatheb for example, let's say on your first raid night of the week you only do noth and heigan from plague quarters (and easy other bosses). Then the next raid night you have everyone get buffs before the raid and start off at loatheb, hopefully one shot him without massive casualties and still have a little advantage on next bosses.
---
It's only really something you get when you know you won't die for the whole instance (and thus shaving off clear time) or when you start off at boss that's a bit harder to kill.
---
No, I didn’t. Feel free to explain how I did otherwise I’m going to assume you’re just trolling.
---
Around 20, eveything will be slower due to the amount of people.
---
I just tested with shaman shocks on beta and they do NOT reset the timer.
---
As far as I can tell things like paladin judgement/seals and shaman shocks do not reset swing timers.
---
I want to test lightning shield as well to see if it's class specific or spell specific but that's level 8 or 10 I think so I'll grind that out later tonight or tomorrow and report back. 
---
I suspect it's class specific so instant cast spells for paladins and shamans should NOT reset swing timers but everything else should. Pallies and Shams are basically melee/caster hybrids so I could see these two classes being the exception as they have to use both constantly and would find it hard to fit auto attacks in otherwise.
---
Not sure about that, but I hear she gives epic head.
---
SM being strath more ?
---
No RP option? :(
---
okay, this is epic
---
but seriously that's like 3 months worth of RNG
---
If you're competent, turn up on time to an event someone else organised and do fairly simple mechanics - it's worth it!
---
Yeah that is what I am hoping for as well. It seems like a sensible solution to keep everyone happy. It will depend on what happens in terms of numbers. If classic turns into a ghost town after 6 months then TBC will not happen at all.
---
Yeah I did the same thing in vanilla, lol.
---
I really wish I played them now &gt;.&gt;
---
Crusader alone got me my epic mount.  Easy to grind solo for that recipe.
---
Largely the same, you'll be wearing a lot of cloth as shammy but there are also a few scarce mail pieces that are all yours. In the end the gearing process for both will be very comparable
---
No, and fair enough. You are technically correct in that arms were sent to Syria geographically. I’m just making the distinction clear.
---
Don’t worry you’ll get fired when you’re take a week off for server first 60
---
I remember having to hold a bunch of keys like a shitty janitor.
---
A joke? Blizzard deciding to switch things up in their rework of the old world? Idk, there are an infinite number of reason why someone at Blizzard chose to make that change. Deciding that it can only be due to evil SJWs says more about you than it does about Blizzard.
---
More or less the same. Both are easy if you have a nice tanking buddy.
---
If we’re waiting on someone playing 2 hours a day to clear MC or BWL we can expect Naxx in 2056
---
Yeah I logged into retail and was surprised to see it has remained largely untouched.
---
&gt;Nothing will prepare you for the unmitigated salt of getting purged of your worldbuffs which you spent hours getting and days logged out for. 
---
I want world buffs for this reason alone.
---
Medivh literally started the entire conflict and sold himself to evil and attempted to commit genocide.
---
Arthas literally kills the most Holy of Knights, sells his soul to evil, and attempts to commit genocide. His actions are directly responsible for Sylvanas. 
---
Glenn Greymane sold out the Alliance by quitting after the second war ended. He sold his people out to a wizard that ended up cursing his people and ultimately ended with the death of his son. 
---
Lord Perenolde sold out the entire Alliance during the second war, and his subjects aided Ner’zhul in his plans to open even more portals leading to more bloodshed and death.
---
But yeah, Alliance people are squeaky clean.
---
I could go on, but I’m sure others will give more examples.
---
#ForTheHorde
---
I'd say priest is easier. The gear is built with the right stats but sometimes you'll need to get leather or cloth and that can be a contentious issue in pugs.
---
Guess yes since you just compete with...hunters hehe.
---
What i would like to know is..how does shaman fare in elemental using ghealing gear? Not talking about raiding or dungs since i like healing..was thinking more about wpvp and farming.
---
Im really torn about going drood or shammy
---
Just because someone is followed by a bunch of 12 year olds doesn't make them relevant.

My gaols depend on Alter Valley most likely. I'll probably do dungeons, BGs, and maybe raids casually. If they ever roll back AV to 1.10 or earlier then I'll be spending most of my time in there...
---
Otherwise.... alts. Lots of alts.
---
&gt;Warcraft lore before then was brutal and dark.
---
On one hand, sure. On the other hand, Warcraft 1&amp;2 is basically just Warhammer Fantasy but Blizzard's spin on it. WC3 carved its own path, and still has bits and pieces of that brutality. Arthas does literally purge a city full of civilians, murders his own father, and brings ruin to his own kingdom. It's not that forgiving. 
---
Setting aside the tone, I actually like the world-building and story told. ROC and TFT are great stand-alone stories in my mind, Arthas basically being a telling of the rise of Darth Vader without being filled with cringe (yes, I know, it's treason then). Humanity not being shown as an all-good faction - humans are bigoted and mistrustful are years of war with the Orcish Horde. The story only started to go down the shitter with WoW, where the Alliance became Lawful Good and the Horde became Chaotic Good with no grey anywhere except Sylvanas and Garrosh.
---
DPS casters will hate you, then, just like hunters would hate rogues who roll on bows because they’re good stat sticks.
---
It is hard to know at this point, but I for one would be interested in doing Naxx at lvl 60, and that is hard to get to casually in 2 years. But yeah it will depend completely on how popular the different options are. I would have thoguht there would be enough people to keep at least one classic server going, as long as that was economic. Server merges after TBC comes out would not be too bad.
---
Our guild had a lot of pvpers and we would delay raid starts for 30 or 45 minutes specifically to farm the Alliance guilds as they zoned in to brm. Sometimes we'd get wiped and sometimes people could just lag through the dragnet. Great times.
---
I guess I gotta be more precise next time, on another subreddit
---
I'll say there was very little filtering for guild names for the first couple months of wow.  It was crazy how long some of the basic names were cool until someone was triggered and reported someone on the internet for being crass.
---
\&gt; You know some bitch at blizzard/someone's sjw girlfriend saw that and bitched until it got changed. 
---
No, we don't know that. It's an assumption you've chosen to take as fact despite there being no evidence whatsoever to support it.
---
As nice as this is, we also have [WoW Classic BIS](http://www.wowclassicbis.com/)  too.
---
Not saying your sheet isn’t nice, but some might prefer the other side if they aren’t interested in a spreadsheet. It may also contain different, but still equivalent gearing options for some roles/specs (I’m not sure, I’m on mobile and haven’t checked).
---
Also WoW Classic BIS has accommodations in gearing based on Orc/Human (again not sure if your sheet does that, since mobile).
---
Add all the unnecessary consumables stacking to that and you're easily looking at hours of work for a single raid.
---
Everything's a product or service these days and it's marketable , this thread right here is legit advertisement.
---
I mean who the fuck even wants to play classic wow on a mobile outside , maybe a total of 3 people who somewhat can't access a pc for some reason, this shit is diablo all over again , nobody asked for it and nobody wants it.
---
Blizzard's obsession with pushing their entire platforms into mobile is just the next step in squeezing out more profit out and appealing to a larger audience , this is the exact same strategy they've been using for a while and the same reason why a lot of their games are going to shit.
---
Classic is supposed to be a haven from all that bullshit, it's an mmorpg and it's not made to be played on a mobile like some tetris game, if you want world of warcraft candy crush then you can go ahead and play BFA which already has mobile access.
---
For real, getting the full .5 set might be pretty fun to do this time around.
---
I don't think anyone is arguing a point of an entire server ignoring you. 
---
The point is, if you have a large number of good players that avoid grouping with you you will have a much harder time progressing.
---
No, title was linked to your current rank. But you got the title of your highest rank back in BC.
---
There is no fair competition in pvp. Even at 60 people who spend the time to raid nax will literally one shot a fresh 60. The exact same can be said with twinking. That is the point of pvp. To win and to blow people up
---
Nice! 1.13 isn't that super secret though, it's in beta right now :)
---
In the sense that we didn't really stop watching The Guild at any point, yup!
---
Streamer luck incarnate.
---
Yeah i feel the TBC version where everyone passes each other in the middle without fighting and rushes to the enemy general was the best.
---
As a gnome I always let taurens go, they were always really chill. Same with trolls. Undead &amp; orcs were hit or miss. Then you had the outliers who just killed anybody on sight, gnomercy for them!

---
&gt;  I was going to explain them all, but I just realised you probably don't care at all since you only wanted to know whether Benediction is good (although I could keep going if anyone does care :
---
I care.  It's been so long and I've forgotten basically all itemization, but ana/bene was and still is my favorite item of all time (I still have it in retail, and I use the xmog whenever I get to equip a staff).
---
I am so tempted to play a priest again in classic but there's so much more meta info out there now that I am worried about shadow scaling terribly past BWL gear...  Well, also the fact that I would prefer to heal in raid, heal in premades, but play shadow in wpvp or solo queue, kind of makes me want to play a warlock instead and try something new... but then I have the fun shadowbolt-only rotation in raids and I dont start scaling well till AQ or latter from what I hear, but at least I wont be ass later on or spending 100+gold every week to respecc.
---
Months away so hopefully I can make up my mind :O
---
Stress tests were hosted on a different realm
---
I assume it was the Rogues Do It (...) guild name. Are you gonna report every undead rogue that backstabs you or teabags you? Lol.
---
1. you have to consider that getting all these buffs also takes time that you could have spent in the instance reducing their overall time save. This ofc does not apply to the trivilizing part of them.
---
2. The cooldown IS a way to limit them. Especially early on when noone has another max level twink. You have to choose between preserving a world buff or logging on your character where you could farm buff mats or even BiS gear should you still miss some.
---
Since you said you were playing p-servers: Have you ever played a server with broken (= too many) herb/ore spawns? Suddenly flasking was super easy and everyone did it. 
---
Compare that to only one black lotus spawn per area and suddenly things change drastically. On (over-)populated servers with limited spawns only the "competitive" guilds still required flasks, since they became scarce and thereby expensive. 
---
(And no easy gold farm does not fix this, the amount of black loti stays the same, so an increased amount of gold would only drive up the price)
---
Thanks, was looking at it wondering when the extra FP at the top of SV, at the top of SG, in Ungoro and silithis were added.
---
Plot twist, she's not the one taking it up the bum.
---
Heh u know the original 😂

I was using an interactive map that was not the in-game one to find all the "keeps" and I guess that one was just a bit mislabeled. Really enjoyed reading this response thanks!
---
Nom nom nom 🤤 the sweet sweet tears
---
Plagueheart is my favorite hands down.
---
That's my way too. I never start fights myself. If I get engaged and I deem it was fair (similar level, 1v1, full hp and not fighting a mob), I'll fight that person every chance I get but only under fair terms. If I get engaged in terms I deem unfair, I'm going to purposely go out of my way to ruin this guy's day for the next hour.
---
It's a tale of two WoWs, really. I always felt that Vanilla was built as a tried and true MMORPG, but the end game and min maxing were never fully realized or thought out by Blizzard. It was bursting with ideas but lacked balance, and as such the players distilled it to its most efficient form. It was also Blizzard in their boss mechanic infancy, big hard hitting damage sponges.
---
Retail WoW as an environment is so **fucking** realized and bursting with depth. Dungeons and Raids are engaging and fluid. We lost the freeform of talent trees, but get smaller talent choices to build different playstyles within a specialization. We lost our access to spells outside our specialization but gained a lot more synergy within the one we choose.
---
It's a give and take. And I miss the "MMO" sensation of Vanilla as much as anyone. IMO it was a superior experience (especially for me, in 6th grade). But in terms of Gameplay they have made humongous strides.
---
You already referenced Shad so you've already got your real life answers for things. 
---
Like Marrasuhri said, fantasy stuff just ends to use the wrong names for things either by mistake or because it sounds cool. And, although SFK is a reinforced place of residence and therefore a castle, Shadowfang Keep has a better ring to it than Shadowfang Castle.
---
there’s this fella called wedc iirc
---
By the Light it should be mandatory for every citizen to take a trip to the Stone of Remembrance monument at Stone Cairn lake in Eastern Elwynn. What are they teaching these days in the Mage Quarter? People don't know their history anymore.
---
stamina int and spellpower is about all that is important to a lock leveling and endgame.
---
I still have the books from back in the day LOL
---
Not if you stack Agility which you should do.
---
Agility = More crits = flurry = attack speed = more frequent WF which also crit more often providing more burst. 
---
It is a NICE loop.
---
Also gives you some armor and dodge which is nice.
---
rogue t1, particularly the helm, looked hella cool. pretty much looked like a ninja, nice and sleek...except for the boob shoulders

Hey folks.  
---
28 year old Mage looking for a laid back EU Alliance guild on a PvP server. 2-3 raid nights prefered but not required, \*however\* due to my work schedule I won't be able to attend Monday-Thursday every other week, which makes it impossible to commit to anything other than casual attendence, so keep that in mind.  
---
Personally I'm fine with it since more than anything I'm looking for a guild, not a raid team, so a fun group of people that I can enjoy cracking some beers with while slaying pixels is my main priority!
---
I intend to go pretty hard on launch, meal-preping list and at least 8 days off from work already taken care of, super hyped! \\o/
---
Even in wrath I can count on one hand the times I actually pvp'd someone while in the initial leveling rush.
---
Why realize you're wrong when you can just double down on everything?
---
What are you talking about my dude?  Are you having a stroke?
---
Do you have a link to any videos or text explanations?
---
I was a gnome lock from WotLk-Legion.  Master Ally race, nothing but the best and brightest that filthy continent has to offer.
---
The Isle is why I finally moved to PvE. That place was way too small to be on the smaller faction.
---
With a perfect leveling route in ideal conditions, I've seen people do 1-30 in 24 hours /played. 
---
Without a good route you'll get level 20-21 in ideal conditions. The conditions aren't going to be ideal, so I can't really say for sure. But I'd guess about level 17
---
At this point I've seen so many problems related to their version of spell batching I'd wish they just leave it out if they can't get it right.
---
I mean ever since the unbreakable video there's been infinity enhancement shamans waiting to play vanilla again.
---
stamina and intellect are pretty good
---
How the fuck does alliance gank horse at SM, that shit is right next to UC
---
Didn't it only start losing subscribers shortly after Wrath, the point at which most players would agree the shift between oldschool WoW and modern WoW took place?
---
r/whoosh
---
This is a good point and makes me feel better about it.
---
Certain phrases are better than others, like coup d'etat vs cul-de-sac.
---
None of that happened DURING World of Warcraft though. A full generation has passed since any of those things in the time line. So again.. I’ll wait.
---
Hi, /u/Miguethor
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bzi7c0/never_played_vanilla_im_thinking_about_being_a/). 
---
It would also wipe world bluffs affecting the other guilds ability to run the instance
---
Pure classes don't really have to do with respeccing though. If you want to level as a holy priest because you take pride in it, you can still do that. Forcing everyone else to do that for an arbitrary reason that they don't care about doesn't make the game better though.
---
Almost every RPG being made in modern gaming allows some kind of respeccing, whether its a single player RPGs or an MMO like WoW. Even a more traditional CRPGs like Pillars of Eternity and Divinity allow you to respec/retrain your characters. They do it because it makes the game more enjoyable.
---
what rogue? *stabbed in back*
---
If you figured out how to get world bluffs inside an instance please let me know how
---
You sound ike you assume there will be no new players for classic. I really hope this is not the case. I'm hoping for a lot of new young players like us back then to play classic and possibly even create their own way of playing due to thinking differently.
---
Most of the gamers in the world are young because they have the most time, no reason for this not to at least somewhat be true for classic.
---
As long as youre not wearing strength gear u will be fine
---
Holy FUCK. 
---
THANK YOU FOR THIS!!!! This site is fucking perfect

ℹ️ **Introduction:** If you’re looking for some pre-BG PvP action or you’re a PvE raider who’s looking to put that gear to some good use whacking Alliance in the face with it, you’re at the right place. Everyone earns their roles here, whether they’re Social, Raiders or PvP-ers.
---
👀 **What we are looking for:** Players of all different schedules and backgrounds willing to be part of an amazing community regardless of how much time they have on their hands to play this game.
---
🎯 **What we are aiming for:** Clearing all raid content, acquiring all epic items and scepter and be one of the most respected guilds on the server. We aim is to be decent in PvE without tryharding and sacrificing the fun aspect of playing this game in order to spearhead the advancement of structured WPvP in the Classic WoW community.
---
❓ **What we expect of members:**
---
* As a PvE raider: Knowledge and desire to improve in your class, as well as getting to level 60 and able to raid within 8 weeks.
---
* As a WPvP raider: Show up at 3/4 of our weekly WPvP raids.
---
* As a Social: Participation in various social activities. (recruitment, social events, writing a 5 minute report etc.)
---
You are free to choose any combination of those roles within our guild. Currently recruiting all classes.
---
📅 **Our Raid Schedule:** Current plan is min. 3 major raids per week. (1 WPvP raid + 2 PvE raids) with Loot Council. Additional details (such as raid times, spots etc.) will be handled after the game launches. The WPvP raids are not to be mandatory, but they will provide an advantage as a Raider in ties against other players when deciding for loot. Our timezone will be around GMT+1 (CET/CEST).

Wow ambitious goal trying to collect almost every piece of armor and weapon in the game.
---
Why would the Scarlett’s be the one in the background...?  Should it be random players?
---
Don't burn out, burn up!
---
Probably thinks he's gonna be the next Guardian lol. What a joke.
---
23 million followers. All of them able to make a Sub makes him relevant to the conversation bud.
---
There totally will be new players, which is more reason to slow the phases down. Most new players don’t have WoW on their radar right now and probably won’t until a few weeks/months after release due to everyone streaming it on twitch.
---
Just because you and I are tracking the release of WoW, does not mean young players give a rats ass about it currently. My nephew (13) and bro-in-law (16) didn’t have a clue what WoW really was. The younger generation will take time to start playing, so its best we slow the process down so people aren’t lol’ing over the fresh spawns with T3.
---
I'm unironically inspired
---
Thanks. I understand Int at end-game, but during leveling there are a lot of DoT's, Wand shooting and rare spells. Does Int increase the tick-damage for every DoT? Otherwise - how it gives benefit?
---
Apologies for stupid questions, but otherwise I'm risking not to get any sleep until I figure it out in my head.
---
I think you can be pretty sure this is a joke man :).
---
Am I missing something here? I'm trying to connect the dots but I think I need more of them.
---
Better than jumping through a window to get to Molten Core?
---
The only argument I have is these weren't core to the experience. Literally no one I played with in Vanilla including Naxx40 guilds knew about these or cared enough to farm them.
---
we all know
---
Ahh, I had that macro as a healer because people used to do that a lot in Vanilla. Usually ended up with me the target of the mobs agro. Sheep whipped the agro table back then and healed the mob. Not sure if it still clears the agro table in Classic like it used to.
---
the queues in modern wow is a big reason why I hope we can log into both versions of the game.  Wait in queue in modern while I grind some mobs in between on classic.
---
Shroud
---
And I think cdew ;).
---
If you say so.
---
That's how i should have said it xD thats my point haha

Now, this is awesome. If you ever need a fifth dwarf for classic release, I'm there. 
---

Same, I thought it always looked stupid af.
---
Hi again. Great work on your guide. Thank you for your effort :) if i were to give some construtive critics i’d say you could make it even easier to follow by using different fonts/sizes for different tasks n stuff. Like bold white means: move to x area and stuff. Anyway greeat job
---
As a shaman 🤣? 
---
Gl hf with that
---
I think server merges would set a LOT of people off in the Classic community.  Server identity is one of the big reasons people wanted Classic, and having to merge them down the road would get a lot of backlash.
---
Thats a lot of why theyre using sharding at launch, so they dont have to make extra servers and then risk them dying off.
---
IMO, if this turns out to be a major hit again and they get the sense there will be that form of longevity, the next iteration of WoW will be somewhere in between Classic and modern WoW.

end of story
---
Lol, I think some people are being asinine to have started the debate on someone using the term harder when it comes to classic. I’m not making up my own definitions for the word.  “Requiring a great deal of endurance or effort” and that does describe the classic experience as a WHOLE, not extracting one specific area of it, as you seem to do.
---
Again, I’m looking forward to this experience in classic. But I also fully realize it’ll require more effort and endurance to get where I want to be than it requires today, just starting with the leveling to 60, mounting, farming, professions etc . Not even getting into building gear sets for encounters and finally raiding.
---
Maybe a bit late, but I have a question to ask as well. I'll mainly be focusing on PvP as resto so something along the lines of 8/12/31 with 3 points in Reflection. With this spec you spend about half your time in caster form and the other in bear or cat form. I've read somewhere that druid feral abilities don't count as "casts" and therefore 5 seconds after you shape shift into bear/cat you start your mana regen from your spirit, however your mana regen from mp5 doesn't work, that's only for caster form. Is that true? With that being said, what's more valuable, mp5 or spirit gear or what would you estimate the ratio to be? I played a bit on private server with BiS pre-raiding gear and I OOM pretty fast in duels so I'm trying to figure out if spending more time in caster form with mp5 gear is better (whenever possible) or if I should focus more on spirit gear and try to spend more time in feral form for the spirit regen. Thanks in advance!
---
I put my kids to sleep with the Elwynn forest, STV and Night Elf zone music.  They now ask for the Intro music from all the expansions.
---
There are 4 Stam 4 Agi versions. Or there were in TBC atleast.
---
One of the best things about old AV was the terrible honor gain rate. It meant the players participating were there for the fun of it not because they could grind out honor.
---
The version we're getting is the most neutered version before TBC. They could at least go back to 1.10 when it still had no trolls but kept many of the guards. The 1.12 version completely killed the theme of the BG being a warzone and made rushing the general FAR easier and more common.
---
You dont even need that much int as you can tap and convert health to mana.
---
For leveling imo its sp&gt;sta&gt;spirit&gt;int

---
Knowing the people that you're playing against is the best thing about vanilla BG's, imo. And yes, it absolutely does not help that cross-realm BG's only put the bar of just how much you have to grind higher. Back in the day it was pretty standard for BG's to either flat out die or near enough die during the wee hours of the night. You could comfortably get some sleep and not lose out on much honor. You still needed to farm a *lot*, but it wasn't nearly as inhuman as it was during patch 1.12.
---
Was playing on a pserver last night (I didn't get beta), I'm a level 27 mage.   
---
Was leveling in Ashenvale with the sound turned down and watching The Office on my second monitor. Not paying attention obviously. In comes a 10 player gank squad made of lower levels like 19-22ish Alliance. They kill me easily before I started to pay attention. I don't know why but it infuriated me that lower levels ganked me while I was dicking around. I shut Netflix off, ghost walked to my corpse and cracked my fingers. It was game on.  
---
After rezzing I literally buffed up with everything I had: sagefish, fort potion, elixir of wisdom etc. I then went hunting. I was looking for like 10 minutes and losing hope. Thought I lost my chance for tasty revenge. But then I crested this one hill and all of the sudden BOOM, the whole sqaud was there in front of me killing some furbolgs. I blinked in and Nova bombed them. Killed their Warrior almost instantly. I silenced the mage trying to poly me and had free rain on those fuckers. They tried running but I tracked them down and slaughtered EVERY. LAST. ONE OF THEM. It felt so satisfying that I went to bed right after and slept like a baby.

I don't know why but this game is awesome like that. Can't wait for classic.

They're pretty much the same. Most of your BIS gear for healing as a shaman is cloth.

There, all better.
---
I guess but I already am paying for a Google phone on a monthly plan and I think I can just add that to it so I would only be paying a few more dollars a month so it's not that bad anyway
---
Dots cannot crit so int does not effect them, having a larger mana pool is useful because it saves to saccing HP.
---
I want neither. Add a Classic+ realm or something, leave "my" shit alone.
---
AV before the 1.12 nerfs was one of the most fun things to do in WoW, imo. That version pretty much killed it for everyone but the rank grinders. I know everyone wants the trolls back but even 1.10 would be an improvement.
---
Thanks so much for the amazing write-up.
---
The story, acting, dialogue was all really cringeworthy wc3, in fact comparing it to Darth Vader is pretty close.
---
Ok.  Is the content going to disappear by the time you get to 60?  Do you want to have MC and Ony as the only raids and wait until you finally completed them in two years?
---
Dungeons went from intricate designs to loot-tubes (although the difficulty was on point)
---
Arena Points kinds killed BGs and Resilience killed casual PvP
---
Optically the expansion was ugly as shit, with Nagrand being the only exception.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
TBC had great story elements going for it (Illidan, Outland), great spec variety and great difficulty (heroics, raids) but other than that I don't think it was a particularly good expansion. I do think these things are important which is why I also rate the expansion highly but I cannot rate it higher than classic as it introduced so many things that turned out to just become the first steps to the awful game it is today. Flying being the obvious worst offender here.
---
Tks mate u help me make my mind
---
Totem of the Grizzlemaw ❤️❤️❤️ Wrath soundtrack was killer too!
---
spirit is amazing with imp drain soul and should be considered as main stat. Int for higher mana bar is pretty nice aswell, allows you to basically play for longer until you eventually have to eat+drink, exactly same thing for stam bc of lifetap. spellpower will be very rare while leveling.
---
There is almost no threat of attack in the first 24 hours. You may not even leave the pvp safe zones. Even some places like ashenvale and stonetalon are fairly separated till late 20s.
---
Hahah ya no kidding.  It looks like it lasts forever in the beta. Looting looks like a giant annoyance.

So cool! I one day want to be able to do this.
---
Wow peaked at like 11 million subs. You really think 23 million people will sub to it because a single streamer plays?
---
Does anyone in the beta have Pendulum of Doom yet?
---
If you Google Shaman vs Paladin vanilla, you always get the answer that Paladins are better because they're more efficient and has OP buffs.
---
Well, it's true that as a Paladin you're more mathematically more effective overall but it's very difficult to be of use when all your shit is purged aaaaaaand you're dead.
---
Each spell has what we call "spell dmg coefficient". Dots spells has it too but it's generally lower. As a general rule, the longer the cast time, the bigger the spell coefficient.
---
Now what is that coefficient? It's a percentage dmg the spell will do, related to your main stat.
---
If you want more details and math, seek class guides over the web, there's many.
---
Awesome
---
I don't know about other people but I played AV for fun rather than for the honor gains and it was the first rep I maxed by a longshot, even with the days long matches. The rank grinders are what killed it and the changes in 1.12 were pretty much just for them.
---
Ok.  So what's your point?  The content is still there.  By your measure, you'd take around two years just to gear up your character for the first raid.  Should we have MC and Ony as the only raids for two years?  
---
The game progression isn't based off of you.  The content doesn't disappear.  If you can't play enough and want to experience it at your own rate you can.
---
Especially for a first time player...
---
Keep it on a separate server and don't force it like they did with tbc :)
---
Same here. I used to say gaming was my primary hobby, but these days I only really play D:OS2, and that only when my brother and our friend are available for our multiplayer campaign.
---
Indies are great and all but gods I miss the middle market.
---
If they do introduce seperate servers for TBC, and about half or more of the population migrate to them then server merges are probably the least bad option. But that is a long way down the track. I think it is better than doing a server conversion to TBC or not doing TBC at all.
---
There are a Ton of hypotenticals in there though, and it is going to depend on the state of classic in a year or so if we get TBC at all.
---
from my experience i like world buffs. when we progressed we would always lose the world buffs, but on farming content its nice to go through raids quicker.
---
That is a well written line.
---
That looks pretty bogus or am I missing where you input your class?

&lt;SAPPED GIRLS CANT SAY NO&gt;
---
Yup, I wish more dungeons were like this, brd, and Mara. I like the idea of non-linear dungeons that are practically zones themselves. Not made to purely for clearing and looting, but exploration and discovery.
---
Pets don't scale at all with anything. Dots damage doesn't scale with crit% or int. Everything scales with Hit (up to cap) and Spell Power.    
---
Therefore Hit% and Spell Power are your best stats. Followed by Crit% -&gt; Int -&gt; Stamina -&gt; Spirit -&gt; Agility (Dodge). I don't have an exact conversion factor (e.g. 26 SP == 1% Crit). If I did it would be rotation specific anyway.
---
Every one of them gets downvoted 6 feet deep too
---
The game starts at 60 man. Why waste time getting there.
---
It will be a "hit" and be successful.
---
Zero reason to do tbc or wotlk... if they decide to waste their time on that, keep it off the classic servers - allow people to choose to go there instead of adding it to the classic servers.
---
There is no reason to leave level 60 in wow.
---
I think you just need to handle it.
---
Thanks everyone! I love this sub being this active - I think I got my answers! :)
---
And second proper raid after 6 more months. I.e. a year of MC and Ony, like I said.
---
Oh? That would be sick if it's true.
---
anyones who played private servers recently know you dont want to spend hours upon hours in zg and mc and bwl after doing it for months to years. its nice to go through them quicker
---
For leveling, if you go with the classic "Dot Dot Dot wand" strategy, I've had the best luck with a mix of spellpower and spirit gear. Int doesn't really matter, because you're not really ooming from doting, and stam is basically as useful as int in that regard since you can just fill one with the other. I HP/5 is incredibly good if you can get ahold of it.  
---
I actually think that the Imp drain life is a trap, because casting drain life stops your regen, so with a decent wand you're better off just perpetually doting and wanding and letting your impressive passive regen do the work for you.
---
End game, just look up a pre-bis list. You're gonna be casting a lot of shadow bolts and have no hit talents for it, so Hit and Crit (for imp shadow bolt) become very desirable.
---
Never watched it. Can't stand Felicia Day.
---
There was a difference but I don’t think it was huge. The difference is that certain abilities weren’t in Vanilla like they were in TBC. Paladins had crusader strike in TBC which made a big difference for them.
---
I think it’ll be a pretty close comparison between the two honestly.
---
I kinda agree. But they have to keep adding stuff for the game not feel a chorus. And they have to do it without making the actual content worthless
---
This is classic so post Naxx would be something else. It just wouldn't belong here.
---
Yeah, the 20% int from HOTW and 21 in resto still allowed me to HT pretty efficiently.
---
They'll probably have servers for each expansion eventually. Hopefully with the ability to copy your character from a previous expansion so that you don't have to start completely over.
---
I am interested. Message me
---
So every retail player is to blame for someone calling vanilla wow shit or something? Because I always thought that if people want it then blizz should release it, especially if it doesn't even affect me in any way.
---
r/classicwowplus
---
Spoken like a true Orc. Zug Zug buddy. Zug Zug.
---
It will forever be cha-poo to me, I don’t care to change.
---
They don't have to keep adding stuff...
---
I don't understand why people can not comprehend the fact that BFA is still available and they will release another expansion next fall.
---
If naxx isn't enough content - "modern wow" exists and will continue to exist.
---
If they decide to do any post naxx content - make it optional and do not add on the Classic servers.
---
Not sure if anyone has mentioned it, but Cdew.
---
Venruki and crew had just attacked and killed a group of alliance, flagging them for PvP. They went out to reset and change talents and there was a group of alliance that had come. Basically everyone in the beta was farming SM
---
Well there was also the constant threat of a higher level swooping down at ~300% and womping you out of the blue. Depends on how early you leveled I guess
---
Okay the abilities makes sense as to how it would be easier for a certain class or spec to level but I remember redoing my 1-60 experience during wrath and it seemed so much easier than the TBC experience as in a noticeable difference of XP gains while questing in zones or out leveling zones that I previously wouldn’t have.
---
If we can confirm he is deep holy, then this is most likely the case.  I saw spirit work properly in pve, but maybe it is bugged in pvp or maybe bugged with BGs since spirit probably is a weird mechanic in terms of not sending your spirit directly to the graveyard on death.
---
No it doesnt it starts the moment you load the game up dont be delusional, every1 rushing for world first in content thats 15years old many delusions going on
---
Isn’t it split by class? I suppose it doesn’t matter without achievements
---
&gt;I will be a dirty casual player this time around and I seriously don’t want to be left behind because people are plowing through content this time around.
---
I don't think you understand how games like this work...
---
You’re just going to the opposite pendulum here. My point is that the game progression for Vanilla seemed rushed, due to BC being released in early 2007. Additionally, a small minority of player base will power through the content and start demanding new phase releases.
---
When you have longer phases, you create a meta like you see here in the beta. They seriously stopped all leveling at 30 and streamers are having a blast doing random crap. A longer duration of phase will allow hardcore players to gear up their mains, alts, professions, and casual players to just catch up.
---
Why do we need to power through content? What is the reasoning to not suspend the rat-race for a second and just have fun?
---
Also good for shaman for the same reasons
---
I think Rag will be a neat WF, because 90% of it will be a 40 person team racing towards 60 from scratch. Even if the raid itself is lame because everyone knows every mechanic from 10 years ago, the leveling grind before will be pretty unique and watching under geared level 56s wiping on should be entertaining
---
Recipe itself or multiple usages of the knowledge it gave? :\]
---
It's wrong as an FYI. If you don't really care, it's an amazing website. But it's not totally accurate.
---
r/monkeyspaw Wish granted, but you now have a giant growth _on_ your penis.
---
The leveling process is the grind the game starts when you get to the real content
---
&gt;your army of spergs downvoted me
---
Like this guy just went and texted all his friends to come downvote an idiot on reddit. Get over yourself
---
It was either a 25% or 30% flat nerf to exp required. The net effect was 1-70 was about the same time required as 1-60 before.
---
I'm there  and just use these spreadsheets to answer people
---
Wrong again
---
It would be really strange if they did that. The population of the previous xpansions would slowly fade and people would demand seasons. 
---
Then you have legacy servers where they store all the higher levels, new servers of all the xpacs. Add in RP and PvP servers and it turns into a mess.
---
You would actually need a better interface just to know which kind of server you're looking at.
---
Okay that would make a lot of sense. That’s what it felt like for my Wrath play-through in comparison to my BC
---
No but it’s very possible several thousand could which could easily add to many players to 1 realm.
---
In case you want a straight forward answer they’re referring to World buffs falling off and not player buffs.
---
I think they tuned 1-60 a bit faster when TBC came along, but I didn't notice a significant difference when I leveled my alt at that time.
---
When you eventually hit max you'll find out
---
 Don't sweat not knowing now.
---
About 10 months after TBC released (patch 2.3), the experience required from 1 to 60 was cut by about 18%.
---
This is extremely manipulative. Giants have a small melee hit box. They are a poor example for their striking range
---
Applying the enchant...
---
I do actually. The reason Vanilla was a “hardcore” game was because it was rushed. At the end of the day, you can casually play and gear up in full T-3. However, you cannot gear up into full T-3 if you have a timeline of 20 months like we had in Vanilla.
---
There’s nothing wrong to slow the game down a little so that the majority of your players (casual) can have time to catch-up before progressing to the next phase.
---
No problem. I sound pretty definitive because most of what I'm talking about has been tested, at least on a theoretical level, and most has been practically tested, we just need more full raid logs at this point to show compiled proof of concept. I'd say just keep an open mind to ret. You dont have to jump on the bandwagon, in fact, I would consider it generally unwise, at least until we have more logs and definitive compiled proof that the spec is more than just a few private server logs and some dreams. My general goal with posting about it is to open eyes to the reality of the spec. I dont want to say it's the best thing since sliced bread, but the ret build that will be used is incredibly new and doesnt have huge exposure.

I logged into my alternate account just should I could upvote you twice &lt;3

VICTORY FOR SYLVANAS
---
the plan should be to expand level 60 content, and avoid those trash xpacs at all costs, I hope they choose that path lmao. tbc and wrath and everything after that was complete trash
---
Scarlet did nothing wrong
---
Which ones are wrong? I know some of the healers ones can be preference (sometimes you are okay with less of one stat in favor of another and lose negligible performance).
---
Lol ok mr knowitall what ever you think just dont cry bordem after the first 12months once youve rushed everything
---
It was 18%.
---
4,084,700 XP needed to hit 60 before patch 2.3.
---
3,379,400 XP needed to hit 60 after patch 2.3.
---
Really, a porn reference? Is this sub not above that?
---
As a warrior I want spirit and agility on plate gear since it gives you good regen for out of combat and good crit for generating more rage.  Str doesn't reduce my in combat time as much as agility nor as much as spirit reduces my out of combat time.  This changes once you are doing dungeons or raiding.
---
Not really. It could all be handled in one client or a different client for each.
---
If in the same client just select from a drop down which category you want and be on your way.
---
It will almost certainly happen. Vanilla is great and all, but people like the other ones as well. While there is a lot of overlap between some, the populations will balance themselves out fairly well after the initial surge.
---
People didn't stop playing on private vanilla servers just because private servers existed for other expansions.
---
It's not that your ideas can be fun to discuss it's just that this gets posted 10 times a day.
---
being fine with not changing the game so you dont have to spend more time in zg/mc/bwl after months and years is group think. no i came up with that on my own
---
I could honestly see BC/Wrath servers being more popular, simply because theyre a bit more casual for endgame content.  Thats especially nice for an aging demographic full of people with careers, kids, etc.
---
I dunno.  Like i said originally, this is still probably a couple years away, and as you said...it'll depend on how well Classic does.  We'll see, i guess.
---
WC was meant to use Warhammer IP iirc but they couldn't secure it
---
I'd imagine depending on your level of maturity and age, Tinder is not going to be a very productive place to connect with Wow minded people. There is a wow guild discord which seems like it covers a lot of time zones and playstyles. 
---
That might be a good place to look: https://discord.gg/HNT7UPq
---
For what it's worth my wife is really interested in Shaman but is afraid she will struggle with all the spells. Her reasoning is I used to get mad at her 15! years ago when we very first started playing WoW... Which was true at times, but man that was so long ago. I asked her if I had ever got mad at her in when we played in legion and she said no....
---
From what I've found most people are pretty understanding, as long as you are upfront with needing guidance / patience, and not doing something really challenging. If you true to pretend you are a pro and do things poorly, sure there might be issues, and some guilds have much higher expectations, but a lot of them are very reasonable.
---
I'm sure you will be fine! (depending on class, hunter CC can be a bit challenging, compared to most classes, and people love to hate on hunters, so maybe hunters you might get yelled at more).
---
Was this the one you were looking for?

What a waste of time
---
They wouldn't have needed to change anything if there were no rewards for PVPing.  PVP rewards ruin PVP.
---
Reign means sovereignty, or having authoritative control over something (typically a nation or population.) I suppose both meanings can be applicable to the idiom.
---
YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Fuck yeah, thank bro
---
If they add more classic content it will be BC then Wrath. It’s the easy road. I don’t see them doing Classic Plus when they have come out and said they are making Classic a “Museum Piece”
---
And I never said there won't. The question is the ratio of the demand and offer. And since day one there is very limited amount of gold in the economy I doubt anyone can make it rich as you also limited by your small amount of capital.
---
You can make a few tens of gold for sure, but I don't think there are a huge buying power available.
---
1-60 was the same at the launch of TBC.  the nerf to XP happened in patch 2.3.
---
You can see the amount of XP needed per level on this page (pre 2.3 table half way down the page):
---
https://worldofwarcraft.fandom.com/et/wiki/Formulas:XP_To_Level

Hi Hospital i'm dad
---
1-70 at TBC launch is the most daunting leveling experience in wow so you'll be fine.
---
What's the basis? I remember leveling through it in Cata, but do you feel yours is more accurate? What have you done better? This is a question of curiosity, not doubt! It looks dope! I just wanna know how you came up with it.

No leeway of you are walking backward
---
From the Grammarist
---
**free reign** The usual spelling of the phrase meaning freedom to do as one pleases is **free** rein, not **free reign**. The latter is a common misspelling, and it almost makes sense given **reign**'s meaning (i.e., the exercise of sovereign power).
---
All jokes can be funny. Just accept not everyone shares your sense of humor. Sorry it offends you, but some people have a darker sense of humor and joking about that stuff can be quite funny. Doesn't mean they agree with the "joke" or whatever. People are different, we have different humor tastes.
---
It's like they put this in the game just to make up for keyboard turners handicap.
---
&gt; You don’t need world buffs
---
Even OP says the content is "trivial" without world buffs, but then goes on to complain about how much his game is ruined by needing to have world buffs for every raid.
---
Vanilla is like a game of Dungeons and Dragons. It's designed to be about the journey and if you try to min-max in an extreme way (like getting every world buff) you're going to have a bad time.
---
And Laintime :)
---
It was not easy but still one of my favorite memories of the game. That 50-60 area was by far the most challenging.
---
any chance you're about to have a reeeeally convincing sex change?
---
If I got bored I wouldn't cry about it. I'd just play something else. Only children complain about a game being boring.
---
I'm not offended boss.
---
I think what people forget about Classic is that there's no catch-up system aside from the slightly better options in ZG/AQ and the dungeon loot added later on. But you still basically have to go through MC-&gt;BWL-&gt;AQ-&gt;Naxx progression, regardless of when you start.
---
The only out is if you get carried through it by a guild, but it's still RNG to get yourself geared up.
---
Good job, just gotta do it again come August
---
Norge!
---
This will be the only monumental task. Get everyone to 55-60 and get okay gear, then down Rag.
---
Outside of that it’ll be like “cool”
---
... so what do y’all do? Just hang out at that keep in durotar ?
---
Yea, there are some FP missing that where introduced over the course of vanilla.
---
Yes, that's good a lot of enchanters level their skill.
---
So you want it to be more like bfa?
---
Vanilla launch to Naxx was 20 months.  18-20 months like the OP suggested was too fast would be the most reasonable speed to be honest.
---
&lt;Lobstas Go Peench Peench&gt;
---
I've never been part of a guild that bothered with world buffs, and we downed bosses no problem. I think you're really over stating this issue.
---
I remember a player named Sixis from Vashj. He had a wildcard type personality and talked a lot of crap. He had such a bad reputation that he had to resort to making his own guild and become the GM in order to run dungeons and he was a priest. At one point he had such a bad reputation the only thing he could do at 60 was solo PvP or farm thorium veins because no one wanted to raid or do a dungeon run with him.
---
They should be able too since its nothing new but the limiting factors that could make a huge difference is the reduced threat in classic compared to private servers &amp; general itemization.
---
Also any other potential differences between private servers &amp; classic that may not have been seen yet.

Lok'tar Ogar, brother!

Let me hype you up about the Horde, right good and proper.
---
You don't want chaos? Great. There is no chaos in the Horde. The Horde is not about chaos. It's about brutal *efficiency*. Orgrimmar's buildings are as they are because they get the goddamned job *done*. The Forsaken literally clawed their city out of rock just to fucking *survive*, man. You know how much pain and anguish exists within a Forsaken's mind, having achieved sentience after enslavement to the Lich King? A whole hell of a lot, I tell you what, but they've got a job to do, and that job is survival (and pure, unbridled vengeance).
---
Survival is the name of the game. The Horde is a band of merry misfits, just trying to survive in a hostile world. The Orcs didn't want to be here. They were literally brainwashed by a bunch of fucking demons that shattered their homeworld and drove them insane, but they broke free of their bonds and, as a reminder of their former enslavement, impaled Mannoroth's big fucking head on a sixty-foot-tall pike. The Darkspear Trolls, maligned and hated by their kin for the grave sin of daring to help non-Trolls, eke out a meager existence on a pile of small islands. The Tauren find peace with nature in a small enclave surrounded on all sides by desert. The Forsaken, cursed with their very existence, struggle just to keep on not-really-living and not-really-dying.
---
They find brotherhood and camaraderie in their shared suffering, and they fight for honor and the hope of a future prosperity.
---
What the fuck does the Alliance have to offer? Ancient, decadent cities of their long-dead ancestors that they claim credit for, when in recent generations their legacy has been little more than xenophobia and racism? When Garithos, made leader of a full regional contingent by sheer chance, utilized his role to damn the High Elves and let the Sunwell fall? Or perhaps when the forces of Stormwind, instead of focusing their hatred against a literal intergalactic army of demons, decided that it was really the Orcs' fault that the Second War happened, and proceeded to enslave them and put them in concentration camps? So blind to incompetence and nepotism in their ranks that the highest elite ranks of Stormwind host not only the daughter of Deathwing but the nascent Twilight Father? And the Gnomes and Dwarves tinkering away in a mountain, giving fuck-all attention to anything north of Grim Batol? Or maybe the prissy and ancient Night Elves, screwing about in a magical tree in the north of nowhere, so incompetent in their racial history that they lost both Azshara *and* Nordrassil? Well of Eternity kaputt and all? And despite having millennia-old expertise with the machinations of the Burning Legion, they still don't prepare properly for Archimonde's assault? Nor does Dalaran, when the Kirin Tor are besieged "without warning", having conveniently not only ignored Medivh's warnings but also ignored the fact that he was possessed by Sargeras in the first place and also they're a bunch of goddamned super wizards? Might as well just put a big ol' bubble around their city and pretend they don't exist so that they don't have to help out any of the besieged citizens of Lordaeron.
---
The Alliance's legacy is inaction, their birthright unearned and their morality tainted by base prejudice. They lay about, and when threats arise, they continue to lay about until it's too late to do anything but damage control, and then they blame their problems on the funny green fellows and throw them in camps. They're corrupted by the malaise of prosperity, and their shining cities belie their slow downfall.
---
Who do you want to be associated with? An army of downtrodden, abused underdogs fighting for the right to live and assembled through fast bonds of wartime brotherhood, or a bloated bureaucracy of racist, snobby malcontents who abandon their allies to the Scourge and pretend themselves wise merely because of the age of the bricks beneath their feet? I prefer the underdogs. For honor! *For the Horde!*

Yet he still retains his chapeau

I changed loads of stuff, including moving large amounts of land and removing stuff, this is about two thirds the size of the twilight highlands. 
---
This is just how I feel the zone would have been designed with the vanilla ethos, with a clear road network, simple zone theme, connection to other zones and a much more stable political state of affairs (the world isn't ending in 10 different ways if your character doesn't show up)
---
The water elementals in STV dont do any damage if you put dampen on yourself. You can level from 34 all the way to 42 by just AoEing them in groups. I did exactly this.

Comparing the plight of modern MMO performance and ability to retain players to Twitch's business model is and apples and oranges comparison. Yes, there is a market for people who want to watch others play video games. However, streamers aren't exclusive to MMO's as people watch tons of other genres like battle royales, fighting games, FPS, etc. 
---
Mobileshit games attract lots of people strictly because of their "you're playing without really playing" model. It's fishing for the lowest common denominator level of player. If your goal is to make money, and only to make money, by all means make some phone tier gacha game that plays itself. Blizzard was traditionally not a developer who participated in this market and made deep and fun games like Diablo 1 and 2, Starcraft, Warcraft, and WoW. People who like the MMO genre like it for the socialization aspect, the illusion of "working hard to get good rewards (progression,)" and good gameplay. Classic WoW had all of these things. BFA does not. I get it that companies exist to make money, but companies that produce GOOD products produce long-term value. Blizzard needs to return to their roots.
---
That thing only works in Retail because you can instantly queue and get teleported into a new Instance. In Classic that won't work. Its always more efficient to power through a few wipes than to look for a new Group.
---
1-60 in early TBC vs 1-60 in 1.12 vanilla was about the same. TBC brought some class balance changes that probably sped up leveling for some specs/classes.
---
Later during TBC xp-to-level 1-60 was nerfed so people could catch up to their friends in outland a little faster. I was leveling a prot pally when this change happened and there was a very tngible difference.
---
I don't believe they touched XP to level or anything like that 1-60 until some point later in TBC, I don't recall it launching with leveling nerfs.
---
You're acting like the game will shut down when naxx is cleared.
---
See this is the issue, you just don't know much about hunters.
---
&gt;It can't apply to other classes since they do not have a pet and this point was about pet aggro. I hope I'm being clear here. I am not talking about bodypulling mobs in dungeons, but rather the hunter pet AI making shortcuts which cause accidental pulls
---
Any class can body pull. If you aren't a dumbass, hunter pet pulls should be just as rare as someone body pulling. You pointed out that they might run around if you take shortcuts... again, that's on the player, not a failing of the class whatsoever. You have several ways around it, with EotB and dismissing. Don't be a tard and it's a non issue.
---
&gt;Offtank: Paladins and Shamans are better tanks. Hunter pets are not good at holding aggro even as off tanks
---
Who gives a shit we're talking about DUNGEONs here, not raids... There's only 5 people, you aren't going to be split DPSing and need to have the pet hold aggro OVER anything but the healer, which they absolutely can do without any issues. All they're there for is to split damage so that the healer can focus on the tank and throw a renew or something on the pet while the rest of the party thins out the pack. Again, the fact that you think these are good points shows that you just don't understand why different roles and options are useful, or where they should be applied.
---
&gt;Pull and drop aggro: Every warrior tank can use ranged weapons
---
Holy shit, you seriously have no clue what I'm even saying... They can instantly drop all threat if they pull aggro. I'm talking about pulling aggro, something that can straight up kill other DPS classes like warlocks who do not have the ability to reduce threat. It also lets you do things like ice trap in the complete opposite direction without having to have the tank spend 30sec trying to regain aggro on the whole pack... Like, if you don't see how this is useful, I don't know what to tell you. You clearly are not familiar with vanilla wow.
---
&gt;Hard CC: I honestly don't understand this point. Please explain.
---
You don't know what CC is? Seriously? Ice trap, poly, hibernate, etc. Hunters have access to a hard CC with ice trap and a soft CC with scare beast.

&gt;Increase move speed of entire party: Important to note that if the party members get hit, they are dazed. This means that aspect of the pack is only useful when running greater distances without encountering mobs.
---
So you've never wiped in BRD or mara and had to run the whole group back through cleared zones I take it? This is extremely useful.
---
**TL;DR: The issue is that hunters are a high skill cap. You have not figured out how to play a high skill cap class. Hunters are a bad pick for you, not everyone.**
---
Your argument is ridiculous, you state that both raids are easy and require consumables. 
---
If raids are easy and you don't need them then literally just find a guild or make one that doesn't have wb as mandatory. If people want to spend hours farming and not playing their main to get a speed record time how does it affect you in any way? One of the things that makes vanilla great is despite your character limitations there is always a way to get an edge, whether it's from a health pot, an agility fish, taking engineering or autistically stacking world buffs. 
---
World buffs were always in the game, classic wow (for the mean time at least) must remain as much of an emulation as possible to prevent blizzard from bastardizing it again. NO CHANGES
---
Absolutely but yeah most were pretty bad compared to crusader and mongoose.
---
I had a 20 lock back in MC, so that I could summon people to the Hydraxians in Azshara.
---
1.13 is classic
---
It has a pre-bis option, Jesus Christ did you even open the sheet, fucking people have to always chime in when they don’t know 1% what they’re talking about...

Can you add me on discord. Doing yard work at the moment.

I would love to do an all Paladin rp run of Stratholme. It would be glorious. All the blessings, all the auras, all the judgement effects. Though I wouldn't mind bringing one Smite Priest along just to see what kind of damage they can do with Sanctity Aura and Crusader up.
---

Chapeau.

Wrath gave at least 30% XP gains when leveling.
---
Any site where you can create your own gear list? Haven’t seen phase1-2 PvP set lists yet
---
I think you are looking at top overall parses for individual bosses, whereas I am just looking at where Murtaugh landed on the DPS meters after running Naxx with his guild. Yea he out damages some mages on some fights. But overall, he did not beat many mages in DPS for the raid. I am looking at it in this context because I understand he can push his dps really hard with Crowd Pummeler for an individual encounter. But, I know he will be unable to keep this up for the entirety of the raid. In the end, a ton of the raid time is spent killing trash and so I think DPS for the entire raid is an important number to look at. 
---
Sure he pulls 90% of rogue dps in a couple fights when he is popping pummelers, but let's be honest, noone is farming enough pummelers to have it constantly throughout the raid. In reality, it looks like he is more at 50-60% of the rogue's DPS given the amount of pummelers he farmed, and his gear is near BiS.
---
At peak times in Vanilla, you might be raiding BWL, MC, AQ40, Ony and multiple 20 mans all in one week, for many resets in a row. You are already raiding a large amount of time, now you have to farm pummelers, chilis, and shadow oils for a time proportional to that time as well. Something's gotta give. Either your damage tanks in MC because you don't have pummelers, or you are going like insanely hard with your consume farming.
---
Check out HighWarlordStino on twitch.  He's hilarious and just really entertaining to watch.  Always questing and queuing BG's.
---
Guild v guild pvp with world buffs on the line is one of Vanilla's best moments, imo. Summoning people directly inside an instance just further erodes the game's "wild west" feel.
---
He said 1-60. There were no flying mounts in Azeroth in TBC.
---
Why are you responding in German to someone speaking french
---
Shitstorm inc for that mongoose
---
Exactly this.  ZG was the only catch up mechanism in Classic, which is still a raid and actual content.  It's not like TBC with the Isle or WotLK with tier rewards from heroics.  It's all content that can forever be played.
---
HighWarlordStino
---
Luxthos
---
I like it. Nice work! They definitely try too hard to create an Alliance &amp; Horde compound &amp; route.
---
After people have multiple max level characters, what's the purpose of new mid-level content? I almost think you'd need to add races &amp; classes to convice people to roll alts so that they can experience the new content. Otherwise, you may just run into a bunch of 60+ leveling in a 35-50 zone. I'm not really against it, though. I'm in the "increase the level cap" gang. I do, however, think they need to keep servers at the 1.12 level. Even if it dwindles down to 1 or 2, it always needs to be there, because that's the purpose of the project lol
---
Was there really? Because I remember that flying was only possible on Outland and you had no fear of a high level swooping down on you when you were in Azeroth.
---
&gt;People didn't stop playing on private vanilla servers just because private servers existed for other expansions.
---
No they stopped playing when they got old and something new came out.
---
You're clueless about icetrap. You don't run in and place it on a mob. You put it down, let the tank pull, then distracting shot the cc target and have it run into the trap. 
---
Then as soon as it's available again you FD-Trap nearby and let it run right into the second trap.
---
Hunters have some of the best dungeon utility.
---
Streching will open up the possibility to let the casuals play both versions of the game. I highly doubt Blizzard wanna kill their prized cow for a year. A slow progressed classic will be a good secound oppurtunity for the bored masses.
---
People in beta chat got angry at me for saying this as well.  I don't get it.
---
From what I can see their size is different and appears to be 0.5 inches shorter like its mentioned in the size charts.
---
But its hard to tell because the camera angles on each picture are slightly off. The Classic picture has more of a downward angle and the Retail one is closer to strait on and slightly to the left more.
---
While I agree, there's still a lot of storylines they can maintain in classic, such as caverns of time can be opened, with its own classic focused instance/raids, hyjal was still ready to be populated, and hellfire was slated for classic.
---
You don't start outlands at exactly 60
---
To expand on what I was talking about, I want challenge runs. I'd watch the world first Rag kill by a 40man all in white/grey gear. Or the first time a 10 man raid kills Rag. Things like that sound interesting.
---
But you're on a forum writing about true nerds instead of just playing and having a good time?
---
You can’t just ignore the years immediately preceding WoW to make an accurate judgement on the “Good Vs Evil” debate. Context matters, and you’re willfully ignoring a lot of context to prove a meaningless point.
---
Imagine it being 1937 and saying “Germany’s done nothing bad. They are all amazing and obviously the good guys.”
---
Yeah, let’s just forget all those atrocities they committed that in WW1, they’ve been without fault since 1920. And they will never do anything bad again...
---
I want a fucking leaf. I saw 4 of the bastards drop during my time in MC. We had oodles of goddam eyes, 50% drop rate my ass. 
---
We weren't very good, plus I didn't have a lot of time to play to grind out something better than the cast off Striker's Mark I was using (no one else wanted it and I couldn't get a CSC to drop for my life), but goddammit if I didn't show up to every raid and earn my fucking leaf. But my guild decided it was off of DKP and went in order of seniority, and I was the 5th hunter. I literally did parts of the quest for our most kite challenged hunter who got the leaf before me, but I couldn't get a fucking leaf myself.
---
So with my luck I'll have cleared Naxx before I see one.
---
same here, although ironically in 3 weeks i'm going on a night out dressed as a woman and i'm gonna look hot as fuck
---
This is actually the first zone of many I was thinking of making (it's one of the easiest because the twilight highlands exists). I think there are 12 places where the lore, space and assets could be used to make a vanilla zone, to create kind of an expansion, that was still vanilla, but like expanded.
---
I'm not sure if it would be worth making though (7 upvotes lol).
---
Horde PvP Central US.

[The blue set in question.](https://classic.wowhead.com/item-set=520/ironweave-battlesuit)
---
"hate" sounds like a very strong word for finding a tv show to be a bit fake.
---
what is farsight totem? you mean sentry totem?
---
no u
---
&gt;  I’m not making up my own definitions for the word.
---
Good thing you just confirmed that, since nobody made that claim in the first place.
---
Regardless, if you find farming herbs difficult then whatever. if you want to define difficulty as tedium and spending extra time doing simple and menial tasks then go for it.
---
Something tells me you don't actually mythic raid at any reasonable level in retail wow these days either, so your view of difficulty of content is pretty skewed.
---
You also decry "extracting one specific area of it", but the reality is that there is no difficult aspect. The raiding and pve as a whole is a complete joke, and extremely simple. 
---
A game doesn't have to be hard to be good, and it doesnt have to be hard to be fun. Classic may be good, and it may be fun, but it isn't difficult. To think it is, is simply delusion.
---
No you both
---
This is so true, just yesterday I was looking for a healer in SW for DM. I also asked guild and a few responded with, "Whatever you do, do not group up with so and so even though they are a healer. They joined my BFD group and dps'd the whole time, went oom so we wiped when the tank died then bitched in chat how we are all noobs for wiping in a low level dungeon."
---
RRREEEEEEE
---
Wait...am I remembering WoW Raids wrong...
---
Coulda' swore Warlocks summoned inside of MC?
---
15 years, memory on specifics (esp on a class I never played) a bit fuzzy, but I coulda' swore....
---
You still get honor in a 2v1.
---
So the thing is the increased time line was nice on the private server such as ND but at the same time it was very detrimental as well. There were guilds that had gotten only 1 binding drop where as others had gotten many at naxx time. Because of the shortened time line it hurts the farming process. I hope they launch it in an organic feeling time line that is the correct balance and time between patches that will allow hard core players to get he gear needed to push through naxx.
---

You guys/gals are the best. Thanks!!
---
That red whelpling pet from I think the Wetlands? I ended up selling it for a bunch of gold and my 8 year old brain bought every piece of leather gear from the auction house that looked cool. It did not matter the stats, only the look. I only got to level like 28 on that Orc Hunter in vanilla due to my age but I remember freaking out when I got this.
---
Best reply in this thread. Actually explains why being an orc is better. Not just for performance but the regret of maybe not getting what you want because you chose something that's not orc. Which is imo the most important part, not regretting.
---
What part is it you don't agree with? Rank 1 meant rank 1 up until mop when they made the new system. Sure, a couple of teams could share on some BGs, but it was still a whole lot more sparse than it is with the new system. The old rank 1 titles actually meant something.
---
Staysafe is a bro
---
&gt; In terms of interest and perseverance to dicuss something without understanding the importance of seeing both sides of an argument (even if you thoroughly belive you are correct) , you absolutely have got me beat.
---
More projection, again lol. 
---
&gt; In terms of actual logic definitions, and ability to understand them, I definitely 'have you beat'.
---
If you say so lol. 
---
&gt; Oh your very simple mindset in a nutshell... Thank you for putting it like that for me, you have only made it easier.
---
As in you've offered nothing compelling. Nothing of substance. Nothing with any sort of evidence to support your assertion other than, "that's how I feel". 
---
Whereas I've given you examples. Shown you the issues, the potential solutions, and why they worked. It's a fucking roadmap lol. 
---
You've done nothing but said, "here are my feelings, and they have merit because I felt them" which if you haven't figured out by now is not a compelling argument. 
---
&gt; You still don't understand the difference between opinion and fact,
---
I outlined it a bunch of times in my previous posts that you clearly didn't read even though you've had a couple of days to do so. 
---
My mistake was assuming that most posters (yourself included) actually had something ***aside*** from their opinion, or how they felt about the game. It's nothing but feelings, and you can literally not have a discussion based on feelings alone. 
---
&gt; but I honestly believe that explaining it to you again is going to erode more brain cells of mine than you stand to gain.
---
Assuming you have enough to erode to begin with.
---
&gt; If you are just a troll and really aren't this stupid, I congratulate you on holding my attention for this long! You successfully trolled me
---
Classical deflection. Notice how you've slowly moved from engaging in any sort of conversation or talking on the points, and instead resort to ad hominem and wholesale ignoring points made. It means you're done. 
---
You literally only have your fee-fees about this game to fall back on and can't take criticism about issues with the game. You can't understand the problems and why they were changed to begin with. You can't understand why it was changed because ***YOU*** liked it, so why doesn't everyone else? You can't understand why, from a business point of view, a company would want to change a product to benefit ***THE MAJORITY OF THE USERS***. 
---
I honestly don't know why I wasted my time on this. It's akin to trying to convince an anti-vaxxer to vaccinate their child.
---
My luckiest was probably zulian tiger mount from zg. And ashkandi from bwl, these are not world drops though
---
Hahah yeah just realized that was BC. 
---
I was shadow/holy human priest in Vanilla and I was all herbal/arch so I forgot the enchants lol.
---
I see what you did there
---
neckbeards, neckbeards everywhere!
---
I don't mind fighting it out with someone who really wants a battle... but as with much of life, it's the assholes that ruin it for me.  If I've just spent a while having some guy hump my corpse with his friends for jollies, sure I'm going to nope out, and then also nope out of the next few potential encounters. 
---
Call me a coward, but I also seek to fight similarly geared enemies in general - slowly grinding a tiny amount of a well geared opponent's health away on a newly levelled toon while they wipe the floor with me just seems like a waste of time.  Where's the excitement if the result's already a given regardless of skill?  Fights where you're both actually taking damage are much more interesting to me and I'll stick around for those.
---
It’s up there. I feel shadow craft takes the cake though
---
Blindly following the list is a red herring. Just because a piece is on the list doesn't mean that it is optimal at that moment. A great example for this is the hit cap. If you have all the gear that it shows you will obviously be hit capped, but if you have only a few then it is probably a better idea to go with something not on the list, but with hit rating instead.
---
If you look into it very hard there are close alternatives for many slots, but to really argue those you have to be an expert at the class in question and the difference will not be huge.
---
Also, stay out of the fire
---
The idea behind this is nice but that's extremely minimal info so it's not of much use
---
they already tried to cater Warcraft to the masses and look where that got them.
---
They picked out such basic and generic things everyone most likely already knew. I can see how it’s difficult to create something like this but surely better differences could be pointed out
---
Why was the first alliance 30 a mage that aoe grinded? This whole thread is confusing me as someone in the beta who has seen mages aoe grinding seemingly just fine.
---
I prefer  &lt;JFK was AFK&gt;
---
They can be... take druid for example. You can spec partway down in the resto tree to get swift mend and spec the rest into Balance or Feral for DPS or emergency hold this guy tank.
---
But, while this is possible, in a PVE scenario its not always viable. Most people want you to do either healing, DPS or tanking, not jack of all trades because in the long run its detrimental to your character and group.
---
Here is an example of a bear hybrid spec ( Not the best but an example none the less )

---
That whelp spawn will be my first pitstop to farm gold :D I just stumbled on that place doing some research last night (Frostadomus video)
---
He said it's a 1/1000 drop chance so you did get pretty lucky! Even if I don't get it to drop, the leather/greys/greens I find will bring in a bunch of gold. Getting the pet drop would be the cherry on top though
---
Not really. Tanks acquire a reputation just as well and since tanking is a lot more difficult in classic the bad ones won't find people to play with. Keep in mind that the difference between a good and a bad tank in Classic is enormous. 
---
It all sorts itself out. 
---
Oh, and the alternative is never "not doing anything". Not in the first half year at least.
---
It’s just a model...
---
Did this need an infographic?
---
&lt;Sapped Girls Cant Say No&gt;
---
I'm honestly not too worried about this. Between the time it'll take folks to hit 60, plus the time investment present in *each and every* dungeon engagement - from travel, to preparation and finally running it....I expect the game will quickly weed out folks who do not have the requisite patience for this kind of stuff.
---
Sure, assholes will still exist and not everyone will be nice or very patient...but we're not going to see retail levels of popping into a group, and popping right back out at the first sign of imperfection.
---
Actually in the Classic timeline is when he firsts meets Valeera. She is one of his gladiator buddies enslaved in Dire Maul with Rehgar.
---
Is this a private server? If so which?
---
They won't do that because nobody except you wants that.
---
Honestly you're the most egotistical idiot on this subreddit. Please shut up with your stupid opinions because of your "pro" status in a game from 2004. Nobody cares about you.
---
Skullflame shield, sold it for 500 g
---
There were no valid rolls found in that comment. See my help file for more info.
---
Oh I thought he was talking about some additional stuff they were putting in. Didn't realize they were calling it 1.13
---
Not sure it matters in a world where giant talking cows shoot lighting out of their hands.
---
Some people never played classic, so yes.
---
Professions aren't really the money makers in WoW. They are more-so residual income. If you want to learn about making a lot of gold I'd recommend youtubing videos/podcasts on WoW Classic Economy. There are a few podcasts that I've found very informative. Frostadomus is one of the more knowledgeable names I've stumbled across.
---
Well yeah, most bis list means it bis for most situations when you have that entire set. We just have to assume people know how to contextualize the pieces and their bis viability considering the rest of their gear. Only a few items are generally bis regardless of other gear (cough Lionheart Helm cough).
---
Fake news
---
Not OP, but pretty sure they meant pre-raid BiS, which I agree should have multiple options.
---
Ain’t no one going to be pvping in the first 24 hours.
---
You just queuue AT the same time.   You wouldn't get all 40 in of course but most.
---
I would have to disagree with you on that one. There is definitely a game to be played at 60, but leveling is certainly part of the game too. Skipping the sub-60 content is robbing you of a ton of content in this version of the game.
---
You can literally [hamstring kite mobs and hit them while they can't hit you](https://clips.twitch.tv/AmazonianBlatantAlfalfaPanicVis).
---
"really won't effect anything tho"
---
No, but to suggest there's no reason to the animosity between the different playerbases is just dishonest.
---
Good for you. I was reading the wall of no for years before they announced they were giving in and releasing this.
---
I wouldn't say talents are "vastly more complex", considering there really wasn't any complexity then and there certainly isn't now either. Cookie cutter is a thing for a reason, with very little real optimal variance outside of the obvious weapon specs and such.
---
Seems very circle-jerky when things like that are added instead of keeping it factual.
---
Not sure if this will answer your question. We won't be raiding with a feral tank. If no one wants a peice of gear for mainspec it will be considered for pve off specs first and pvp off specs third.
---
We will either do an alternative offspec ladder or 
---
/roll for it or auction it off or disenchant those items haven't decided.
---
It means some top guilds will try to coordinate it and then get really butt hurt when someone else comes and does the turn in "off schedule".
---
I’m not saying wipes won’t happen, but the fights are not new and everyone knows the mechanics.
---
Hell yea!
---
This is certainly an exaggerated perspective.  I agree with some of your points in isolation but flying is NOT the root of all wow problems lol.  Not even close.
---
What 12 places are you thinking?
---
&gt; Paladins had crusader strike in TBC which made a big difference for them.
---
They didn't until level 60.
---
The amount of dreams you may have just shattered :(
---
Pretty much this. There are a few exceptions where you can buy mats and sell the finished goods but they are rare. People also don't seem to calculate auction house cut, or deposit if you don't sell, when they rant about how amazing X items is to sell. 
---
If you can get your hands on certain patterns early on you can make money with profs. You have to get lucky tho.
---
I forgot that Demon Hunters were a class for a moment, counted them out and still couldn’t remember what class I was missing
---
You fuckin do you lad!
---
Wouldn’t amount to the number I’ve had mine.
---
I just started D:OS2 and I can only imagine how awesome multiplayer is in that game. Lucky you! :D
---
Didn’t talent resets start at 10s?
---
Thanks for the tip! I’ll look into it.
---
I’m a “serious casual” player. I do my best and will focus on what I’m doing, but it has to be fun. If it becomes a chore or stressful, I’d rather do something else. I mean, I can grind, but I don’t want the social aspect of it to become too demanding. Yelling is definitely a big no no. Though now I’ve realized that not only might someone get angry if I don’t do things perfectly, now there’s also streamers recording everything so that 13 year olds can point and laugh as well. So that’s great.
---
Can't wait to just jam out to Coheed while playing.
---
So you think by catering to the 1% who are hard core, no lifers Classic is going to be successful? 
---
Thats the whole mentality of "you think you do, but you don't." Meaning that someone else, someone more experienced, someone who plays more than you knows what should happen with the game.

I'll play as healer and my friend will tank. Our rule has previously always been that anyone can roll for anything they need while in leveling dungeons. At 60 we will run with masterloot and let damage dealers reserve specific drops from bosses and we will run the dungeon as many times as is needed until items drop.
---
While grinding my troll mage in the 50-55 range (I found it much more relaxing and engaging than questing) at one of the undead overrun farms in WPL...not gahrrons withering, it was one with zombies instead of ghosts... a Myrmidon’s Signet dropped. Couldn’t believe it, my first epic, aaand....useless for my class.  I had a feeling if I linked it in guild it would get communismed away from me so I sent it to a secret bank alt and hawked it in orgrimmar, a tank in a top raiding guild gave me 550g for it and I bought my Forsaken green warhorse mount.
---
I got the stockade pauldrons and the flurry axe on my warrior while leveling. Equipped them both while never tanking.

I really had a hard time with the Grammar in this. I say this as a constructive critique. With the images and lay-out it seems like a lot of work went into making this, thus Id advise a native english speaker do some basic editing for grammer if you want people to take it seriously
---
Pretty sure their hitbox is indeed bigger
---
It won't be Classic anymore after they add something after Naxx will it? What will phase 7 be? At that point it's no longer Classic... so yeah in that sense the Classic game will shut down, just like Vanilla was shut down when BC came out...
---
Underworld band from some mob in STV. Saw the Baron mount drop but didn’t win the roll.
---
Yeah, you're right.    
---
\&gt;  Retail players need to understand that Classic is a lot more difficult with pulls
---
It’s also the theme of the location. Sure, by definition it’s a castle. But since the theme is ascending a single keep to kill the madman.
---
(Plus keep sounds better, and you can’t just call everything “such and such castle”, that’s boring after a while)
---
If you’re in the USA you can get this done through fedex for 79.99

Bravo.

I'll be grouped from 1-60 playing a tank with a healer. If anyone drops the group because we wiped they won't get invited back. Because it's going to happen.

* Multiple expansion progression raider, leadership experience

* Druid, Priest, Rogue, and Mage..depending on needs of guild
---
* Exceptionally skilled healer and Rogue as DPS.

We both are steelworkers that work 4 on 4 off 12hr swing shift, this would mean our raiding schedule would vary depending on our weekly schedule. We both are looking for a casual, semi-hardcore guild that is looking to grow into a solid, established, reputable guild.

Yokes you took that way more serious than you should have. You fucking nerd.

The proffs aren't what make you the money, it's the items required to craft certain potions, flasks, armor and weapons as well as enchants that sell well.
---
A lot of what you can make money off of drop from mobs, grinding and farming certain mobs/dungeons is the key.
---
This is one of the most uninformed comments I've read in years. Great work.
---
Getting admitted to a mental hospital for playing too much WoW was way too real.

Hi, /u/pluto1998

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bziym0/asmongold_they_are_stupid_degenerate_retards/).
---
It's just a little bit picky if you ask me.  The only level range that you are comparing right now is 58-60 Vanilla vs 58-60 TBC. Saying that you are under "Constant threat" without specifying a level range pretty much implies that you meant the whole leveling experience not only a certain part of it.
---
He asked for 1-60, not 58-60.
---
I remember grouping with good tanks who were shitty people as dps, though, because we've already been looking for a tank for 30+ minutes.
---
A guild group I was in had the first sequel serrar drop on the server and I ended being in 2 other groups that saw it drop. I’m not sure on horde side, but for alliance I saw 3 out of the first 4 drops for that quest thread. First one we sold to the top raiding guild for 2500g.
---
I mean if I could be playing classic right now I wouldn't be on the forums either. But here we all are.
---
I advise caution. I just read the very first sentence of the priest section and it says you will never downrank renew and only ever use max rank which is competing for the most retarded thing I have read all week.
---
Still does! He's pretty much on the forefront the classic pvp community.
---
Is there a caluation of what Gold was worth on Vanilla vs Now?
---
Like adjusting for inflation how much one gold got you then vs now?
---
Man, if you think the Vanilla talent tree is "vastly more complex" you should just take a look at what it was in WotLK.
---
i only have a few years left until the kids are out, classic might do the trick!
---
That’s too long but even if you go with that no new raid comes in phase 2 meaning we sit on the initial two raids for 12 months total by phase 3?  Say goodbye to classic if you try that the population dies.
---
Holy shit that site is great
---
Swifty us an idiot 😂
---
Exactly.

First off, I play horde so my quest knowledge is lacking alliance side.

Warrior WW weapons aren't viable while leveling until 35-36 because you have to kill a 40 elite.
---
Also here at the end is plenty of weapons for your rogue https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rvvzg5JLgcGb7H8dveGb0FSQ60Q6sKP9dcLPoonRRhk/mobilepresent?slide=id.g448cb83946_0_432
---
ill be taking my sweet time with you
---
Can you buy gear with honor points the way you could in TBC+?
---
Nah. Doubt it. Wont effect anything. It's settled. We will keep it.
---
So you want them to fundamentally alter the flow of the game so that super casual players can keep up?
---
I say 'super' casual because they can't keep up with 6 phases of content over 1.5 years.
---
Defend the keep against horde incursion. Horde quests send them there, when they go to attack the NPCs we protect them on character. Often times, they'll attack us and then we fight!
---
FUCK OFFFFFFFFFF
---
Not going to lie, seeing those paladin and shaman tier sets triggered some nostalgia in me. T2 was just so good (granted, it came after MC so probably anything was going to seem awesome, might be some nostalgia goggles there). Good content, great looking art, PvP balance was in a great place (raider vs non-raider, physical vs magical, various different classes etc), BRM was still the place to be, etc. Ashkandi was dope as hell. Like, what could you ask for? Dragons are just friggin cool.
---
People talking about 1.13 - give me a version of the game spun off from Phase 3/4 or just give me TBC. That's my thought on that topic.
---
Northern Lordaeron - North of eastern plaguelands, filled with Scarlet crusade and Scourge
---
Ulduar and Gilneas - Similar to how I changed the Twilight Highlands
---
Mount Hyjal - Similar to the original intent of the zone in vanilla, basically just finishing it.
---
A zone to the east of burning steppes - Blackened like the burning steppe and searing gorge, but on the coast, lots of pirates, dark irons and black rock orcs. Probably put a goblin town as the central quest hub.
---
A long coastal jungle zone running from blasted lands to stranglthorn below zul'gurub- Lots of ravines, gurubashi troll ruins, naga and pirates
---
A stormy bay behind stormwind- surrounded on all sides by high mountains, south side of the bay held by the humans with a garrison to protect the back of stormwind, glacial flows on the north side with frostmane trolls, dark irons in the mountains on the east side, the deeprun tram runs along the bottom of it, provides a high level run that allows travel between stormwind and blackrock mountian
---
They did talk about adding new content at the end! It was a possibility as they won’t say for certain before they understand the numbers and figures after the initial hype to see the continuing run rate of players.
---
Unless they do season servers. Which would be awesome.
---
This page should be stickied
---
Okay, then maybe we do phase 1-2 for the first 8 months. 
---
This is leveling time and MC and Ony. People are not going to be leveling as fast as you think the will.
---
I just don’t want the content rushed and the minority in the community demanding short phase times.
---
Figured I’d not make another post and ask here. What about any streamers playing druid?
---
The average age of WoW players in Vanilla was actually mid-twenties to late thirties meaning the average of those players is now somewhere between 38-48.  Assuming the original crew comes back, like I know myself and others are, it’s going to be a very older crowd playing.
---
There are actually reasons to spam lower than lvl 20 ranks.
---
1.	It could be the bit that saves the tank when you are oom and moat healers are dead
---
2.	It can cost less mana than you regen
---
3.	most importantly: They proc buffs. Namely Inspiration for priests
---
Instead of playing with your snake while waiting on Naxx pulls, spam r1 heals on your assignment.
---
Sorry I didn't clarify that "it depends on how early you level" part. It depends on how early you switch over to outlands. 
---
58-60 is part of 1-60. Those are actually the two slowest levels. They make up more time than the first 10.
---
Carrot on a stick is not in the thumbnail. I deny your list.
---
We've got Mourtagh's commentary on that specific run and his computer was basically melting on that run. The gap between pulls where he's on point and running into technical issues is very, very apparent. The theorycrafting discord had a stream link for that very raid and he had to cancel the stream because it was straight up crashing his computer. 
---
As I've said, we dont have full logs, only partial logs. Only a handful of these naxx fights are pushing ret to its limit. 
---
The first 3 bosses he was crashing the fuck out, Thadius was a legitimate pull, Noth and Heigan are real pulls. I'm fairly sure Loetheb was a scuffed pull where he didn't use the consume stack. IIRC he said fuck it after those and opted out of MCP due to technical issues. It was supposed to be a flexing raid for him and the stream fucking died. He's outright sitting on a few fights just due to technical problems. Gothik fucks Ret really hard, he doesnt use full consumes for 4hm because it's a DPS throttled fight to begin with. IDK what his deal is on Saph, and KT isn't wheelchair melee friendly. 
---
He blows all his MCPs on a few fights and has split focus outside of those 3 fights. With a better setup, he would do better across the board. 
---
It doesn't really give me a great look to use scuffed as fuck logs as proof, but it's the best we have at this point, and we can look into the context of the pulls. I think one thing you can do is look at how fucking scuffed his setup was and see that he was generally middle of the pack in his Naxx guild without MCP spam. 
---
Gothik fucks Ret really hard, he doesnt use full consumes for 4hm because it's a DPS throttled fight to begin with. IDK what his deal is on Saph, and KT isn't wheelchair melee friendly.
---
Man, furries are one thing, but *scalies*?
---
Eventually, the theory is that they may move on to BC or Wrath, but mainly, Classic will be Classic. There isn't going to be any "new" content, because the "new" content for Vanilla WoW is, well, the expansions they already made. 
---
If people want to play something newer than Vanilla, there's the modern live servers. Understandably, that doesn't really include anything after Cataclysm, but that's why people want "Classic" in the first place. I know they're going to start with just Molten Core and such and add more raids in a progressive fashion as time goes on, but there's no plan to add "new" content because they already did from Burning Crusade onward, and they can't very well have two completely different paths of progressive content additions. Considering people have been playing on Vanilla private servers pretty much ever since expansions started rolling out more than a decade ago, I think there's still a significant playerbase that doesn't mind not getting any "new" content.
---
I always loved how the army was nowhere until tbc.
---
I know it won't happen again. That's why I'm trying to do things *perfect* this time around.
---
hahah epic mamee
---
litty lets get some 7's
---
It was directed generally at playing casually. Meaning if you want to heal, you can play as any class and not to worry about playing a specific healing class. Obviously he wouldn’t play Warlock if he wants to heal.
---
haha litty sick and epic im loling so hard :joy: :100: :okhand:
---
Hoooooo
---
Noob question. How do you get good enough gear for pvp without doing raids?
---
'The talent system are'...
---
lmao
---
better be fixed or ima start doomin
---
I’m level 40 in beta, I didn’t rush, and I’m not a streamer.  People can level as fast as I think they will and then some.  8 months is far too long.  Your base that will stick with classic will all be 60 by no later than two months after launch.  Anyone hitting 60 after that is a true casual.
---
Run to the center
---
i hope DM buffs aren't a thing, fucking boring. I like all the other ones though
---
I feel like most of those things are universally known even by people who didn't play vanilla. I mean, does *anybody* not know about things like talent trees, paladin/shaman being faction-specific, etc.? Maybe they wouldn't know that you can't race change, but surely only the most ultra-casual dude who barely even plays is oblivious to most of these facts.
---
Huh. How do you get there lol
---
Another coastal zone north of darkshore and behind moonglade - An allaince night elf town for allaince, shattersapear trolls provide a horde quest hub, covered in mists and a lot of naga
---
A bay next to thousand needles and dustwallow marsh - Lots of pirates, neutral pirate town is central quest hub 
---
A high sided ravine connecting southern feralas to un'goro - Filled with dinosaurs, huge trees and trolls living in the cliff walls 
---
also condiered taking azuremyst and bloodmyst isles and just removing all the draenei stuctures, quests and NPCs as a low effort way to create 2 zones with like 10 quests
---
It's not supposed to be of use to newcomers, it's supposed to be for classic fans to remind themselves how cool they are for liking classic.
---
I can see a great shaman name coming out of this
---
I like it. But you’re not invited.
---
"Nyehhh, why would you wanna be ganked lul. PvP servers are filled with basement dwelling neckbeards that do nothing but gank lowbies, wahhh.."   
---
Who am I? :D
---
'The Gold is'... :P
---
It has a pre-raid bis option, which is still a bis list, which is 1 item per slot.  Idk why you are so angry and defensive, but my point is still a valid.  These lists are titled BIS which means best in slot which means 1 item per slot.  Don't get so worked up.
---
/hUG
---
The beta is a very small pool to sample from, and we can argue those are some of the most hardcore players of all of us. 
---
It’ll be a miracle if I hit 60 before 3 mos....
---
I think flying in the old world (not Outland or Northrend) wasn’t added until Cataclysm?
---
Cannot fucking wait to purge peoples buffs on my shaman...going to be glorious
---
I don't think this is a troll, which is the sad part.
---
Interesting connotation. I’ll keep that in mind
---
You see guys looking for gamer mates on Grindr quite often if that’s helpful.
---
Two foreign speaking people on my last private server pissed me off to an extent that I focused on leveling my horde warrior, installed unitscan (plays drums of war as soon as they are in range) and relentlessly bullied them until they legitimately quit the server.
---
It was not quite like in the movies. I was perhaps ten levels ahead but they were a Paladin and a Warrior vs my Warrior that was like 10 lvls ahead. And they often had help from a priest.
---
It was persistence that made them quit. I would not let go of it on their journey from lvl 20 to 45 and eventually they apologized and hoped I would stop.
---
Sure, and that means you’re playing casually.  Nothing wrong with that.  Now if BWL comes out at 4 months (it won’t) is that impacting you?  You’ve been 60 for a month, maybe you’re just starting MC, it’s not going anywhere and BWL will be there when you’re ready.  There’s no reason to argue for holding back those who are finished the content, within reason, to wait for those who want to crawl to the finish line.
---
Well my friend was helping me grind my way from 59 to 60 on my first character. While grinding the ruins of anderhal, he got a dwarven hand cannon and an orb of deception. I was so pissed. He stole my rng!
---
Yeah, I dunno. Tbh, any route they take, I'll give it a shot. If classic stays classic and that's it, I imagine they'll get a couple years outta me. If they go on an alternate reality expansion path, I'd be down for that. Emerald Dream, anyone? If they go on to tbc and wotlk, I'd go along for that ride also.
---
Shards do not stack.    
---
You are basically down a bag slot like hunters, but get larger shard bags from quests and/or tailoring.
---
A very significant portion of your dps (especially while leveling as BM) is ''next to no benefit''. Ok.
---
Don’t know why this made me laugh, what sorcery...?
---
A Tiny Black Whelpling while questing in the Badlands. When I told my guild idea they said it was super rare. So I put it on the AH for 100 G with no buyout for 24 hours. The next day I was amazed that It had sold and my end was 978 G and some change! So I literally said thank you (!),  jumped up and started dancing, and then ran off to buy my mount.
---
I think some people are just too excited and feel the need to ask anything
---
&lt;Ten Silver&gt; (price of guild charter)
---
At some point certain yiff really jumps the shark if you know what I mean.
---
People get them because they are in competetive guilds and wanna be the mage/warrior/etc that does more damage than other mages/warriors/etc in their guild. Also, in guilds that dont use DKP the loot council usually gives the best drops to the best and most dedicated players and the easiest way to determine them is through raidlogs which show damage and healing done by each raidmember. Personally I wish they would just get purged by entering a pve instance.

Is there a wow lore subreddit?

It really started with BC, it was just the majesty of vanilla shown through the changes in BC.  It was in Wrath that the changes really began to dominate and fundamental change the game.
---
&lt;Naga Stole My Bike&gt; was a guild on our server. I wonder if I'll see it again.
---
Looks like heaven to me
---
Ohh boy
---
Depends on what actually sells. Best combo would be alch/herb/fish to make flasks / resist potions / pvp potions, selling profession kits and, depending on what herbs/oils/food sell better than others, being flexible with gathering mats.
---
Wait what the actual fuck. Lord Daval Prestor was Deathwing and his family is still respected advisors of the king???
---
No, soulshard did not disappear.     
---
However health stones, soul stones, etc. are conjured items and will disappear.
---
And 14 years ago NOBODY had played classic.  Why deprive them of the exploration and discovery we had?  It’s a huge part of the experience.  Plus why would they be on r/classicwow if they were the type to not know the information in that graphic?
---
I mean I wouldn't even place streamers in the equation personally. I plan to try to avoid them as much as possible. If it's a really large streamer you will likely know who they are, or can look them up. If they are a no-namer, ohh well. 
---
The older people are, the more mature people tend to be (not always ofc), so as a ~35 year old, I try to just avoid really young / immature people in games. Most adults I've played with have been very patient with people as long as those people actually try to improve (results not as important as intent). 
---
I would probably avoid guilds aiming to be the top few %, but there will be a lot of working adult guilds, and there is a lot of time to learn how to play from 1-60. We might even get an open beta, but not sure how likely that is, but there are places to try classes if you look. Even just messing around, that can teach a lot.
---
Greetings!
---
Huh. I never played Vanilla so it was just my guesstimate after reading all the posts about people saying how much they loved vanilla as a teenager.
---
Anyways - who cares lol. 
---
I think we can agree that MOST players will be playing casually. To OPs point, blizzard shouldn’t cater to the +|- 10% of players that are extremely hardcore and burn through content as fast as they can.
---
2 gathering professions will net you much more gold per hour of farming than getting a crafting profession generally speaking.
---
They didn't change 1-60 until 2.3. If leveling felt faster it was more likely due to class mechanics changes that came with 2.0
---
Does it explain why they are making those decisions, specifically the launch order of the BGs, or just what order?
---
To be honest, I would advise you to let go of any illusions about Raid progression. it's not gonna be like vanilla, where clearing BWL or AQ40 takes 4 months.
---
And I'm not saying this because of the private servers. yes, developing the meta for 15 years and training every boss and every class helps a lot, but there is also gonna be: 1.12 Itemization, 1.12 Talents, 2019 Server infrastructure, 2019 Internet broadband connection, Professional Content Creators whose Job is to inform you about everything classic, an **extensive** database of theorycrafting, specs, BiS-Lists etc. and even if you don't consult BiS lists, there's always gonnabe at least one player in your raid team (provided you do get the 40 players together, which today is still as hard as it was back then) that is going to tell you what gear would be good and where to get it.
---
So a castle is just a broad term, while a keep is the more specific term. A castle can have keeps, but not always. A keep can be a castle itself, but it doesn’t make it not a keep.
---
Did you seriously just assume her gender?
---
Millions of people played WoW in classic, always trending upwards, so yes there were a lot of teenagers.  That said there were obviously far more young adults with disposable income, the true target market of a subscription based game in the pre-gaming is accepted by all era.
---
It's okay, I laughed
---
&gt;I hope they're making a montage of sorts. 
---
This or streaming.
---
Ganking streamers definitely looks like cheap self-promotion.
---
Having fun!!!! Realistically I doubt anything beyond the occasional dungeon and PvP at the end game are very likely for me.

What would be the epicenter of lore in Ulduar, Gilneas, Uldum
---
Live the dream Jay, we're all cheering you on.
---
Not really. For what it was, people put points randomly and still played fine. For top end everyone had the same thing and didn't change it, ie cookie cutter builds. It wasn't complex at all to put points into something that you though was cool or would help you, half the time you do that you end up with a cookie cutter build by accident anyway.
---
There's nothing complex about putting a point into something that increases damage by 1% x5 and then crit by 1% x3. Current talents actually have meaningful impact on either how a spec plays or what it has access to. Not complex either, FWIW, but definitely not less complex.
---
I guess Troll it is ; )
---
REEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Sodapoppin(on vacation), and Stormx
---
14 years ago we got to know the systems as it rolled out in front of us.
---
Spell ranks were a thing back then, coming from modern day WoW, people might think there are no spell ranks.
---
People might think talent trees are simple compared to now.
---
People might be from modern wow and start reading this subreddit for research purposes prior to dropping in. The infographic might be posted elsewhere not just here.
---
What else would I claim if you write such obvious mindfarting bullshit?
---
No, you didn't raid, and no, you didn't play in Vanilla. And I pity every guild stupid enough to invite you. Please find a pile of wannabe-pro-minamaxers, because no guild with decent people in it deserves to be polluted by this crappy behavior.
---
And now get lost kiddo, you're boring af.
---
Some are just born better than the rest of us
---
There will be too many guilds to coordinate with and it will not be manageable to do so. Maybe some extreme servers will be unlucky enough to have those that will try. I am strongly hoping the Pserver elite will all go on a server I do not choose. They are too toxic about this sort of shit especially as for them it will directly affect their experience of classic whereas everyone else just will not care.
---
I work for blizzard .. yes they will .ok go fuck off now.
---
I could see a Twilight Hammer dungeon in the northern part above Darkshore, then a TH raid in the twilight highlands obviously. Could be interesting!
---
Was there any previous lore to Blood/azuremist isles?
---
4 Paladin RP run with lvl 1 gear smite priest, protect the president.
---
You are ignoring the endgame here. We’re relying on Blizzard here to not somehow screw this all up. The faster we blaze through classic content, the faster we get Classic plus with micro-transactions or expansions to just get back to where retail is....
---
Right.  And no one ever dies because you can simply walk away and reset bad encounters.  I know exactly how priests leveled in vanilla, in a party.  I guess you can level slowly and inefficiently by soloing as a support class but that's not how it's meant to be played and it certainly won't give you the best experience.  What was the point of your original comment anyway?  Did you come to this subreddit just to tell people who find the game challenging and engaging that their wrong? That your experience is more right than theirs?  Gtfo with that toxic shit and leave people who enjoy the game alone

&lt;Gnomosexual Pwnography&gt;

Nice Crossover meme with all thr Banjo Hype going on
---
well he's comparing to retail wow where you have like 7 single point options
---
Ouch
---
You’ll never see “Classic Plus” because that’s some insane notion the community, and a very small subsection of it at that, cooked up.  The BC servers will happen, then Wrath, etc.  You’ll never see “new Classic content” because that’s money the shareholders want spent on developing the actual retail client.
---
&gt;You are thinking about it all wrong then.  Blizz team doesn't listen to the no-lifers, they listen to the 2 hours or less crowd.
---
Pretty much bang on.  
---
What blizz should do is not listen to anyone, and just make the game they want.
---
Thanks fam!
---
I’ve been watching frost for a few years now, he’s great! I’ve seen this video he put out and the memories came flooding back and I heard stories of how other lucky souls got this to drop too. Best of luck!
---
Orb of deception!!!!! Is that BoE? I forget
---
I’d*
---
T3 pally!? Maybe the helm is bad, but the rest is clean.
---
I’m a mostly heterosexual woman, but I do remember from my early WoW days that someone thought I was a gay man. So, maybe it would be the place for me? Certainly would be thinking outside of the box. Or just a case of outrageous catfishing.
---
I didn't cooperate because I would have had to wait several months to have my place at rank 13/14 (and by that time the rank 13/14 gear wouldn't be as good as it was, or the titles less prestigious). 
---
Also there was another thing that these pvp groups didn't actually realize (at least on my server). The person who did get rank 14 wouldn't be helping the others in that pvp group afterwards. They got their rewards now so why "waste time" grinding and helping all the other plebs waiting in line? So the people you made the agreement to wait in line for several weeks after aren't the same people when it is supposedly your turn. Will they respect that agreement? Nobody really knew, and I wasn't willing to take that risk. Many of the people in these pvp groups never got rank 13 or 14. 
---
A lot of horde would tend to skip out by /afking on premades anyways and you would miss out on honour as well (at the time you could only kill a character 3 times to get honour with diminishing returns. At the 4th kill you barely got anything). So playing solo was better, more efficient and guaranteed better gains if you had the time to play. 
---
There were definitely other times for drama to occur. During the end of summer. The summer holidays were ending and people would have a lot less free time to honour grind so there was a lot of diagreements on who would be next in line. I totally remember this hunter that quit the pvp group because of this and asked me for help. By that time i got my rank 14 and decided that the weapons weren't worth it since i like Field Marshal as a title better than Grand Marshal. 8) Not sure if that all makes sense but that was my thought process! 
---
If i do go for the titles this time around i'll probably play a hunter or another paladin.
---
PvP between two max level guilds on a PvP server isn't "greifing"...its PvP.  They have PvE servers for people who truly hate it.
---
This is cool to see as someone who quit after Wrath. I didn’t know how much they changed. They got rid of spell ranks? And the talent tree is less complex?
---
This is my porn.
---
So we plow through the content and BC servers are introduced. Your server’s population dwindles because of half the player base moving on to BC. My entire point is this won’t happen again, let’s not go flying through it again.
---
gilneas would have the initial prompt of bringing gilneas into the alliance, and then have main questlines probably about the run up to the worgen curse appearing more and more, and the forsaken insurgents trying to destabilize the region 
---
I wrote ulduar but meant uldum, probably wouldn't have ulduar in classic
---
Uldum would have a lot of old gods stuff, large numbers o pirates, and probably a rep with the Aqir for mounts and gear, wouldnt have a al'akir raid, but would allude to him and leave it open to be something in the future
---
I'm so happy for him that they're releasing Classic. He's been so devout to the game for years and it's nice see him getting a fraction of the recognition he deserves
---
I'm not saying it will work, I'm saying it will create toxic forum drama.
---
the fuck you talking about bitch?  the "second week" is not the same thing as "never" is it?  fucking moron.
---
No information on hunters or professions? Fail info graph
---
Those who want classic, like me, will stay with classic.  Those who want BC will move on to BC.  It’s inevitable.  The idea that you’re “blowing through content” by making Classic last 18-20 months is insane.
---
and in the first 24 hours, any enemy faction you run into are just as focused as you on xp, not pvp
---
FYI, almost noone is spending 3-4 hours prepping for raid. The feels bad is more like this: You spend 30 minutes prepping for raid with your whole raid group. On the first pull, you accidentally rip aggro and die. Now you are stuck without buffs underperforming bottom of the dps meter. That's what feels bad. Its like your whole raid is written off because of one mistake. And that isn't necessarily a mistake you made. Your tank could screw up or a healer could lag out or something and you just ruined your performance for the raid.
---
stillpine furbolgs, some dead humans sailor ghosts, lots of night elf stuff like a lodge and some ruins, probably more of an RP thing to make the world feel bigger than too much leveling
---
Yeah I can't see me wanting to play hunter if these go forward to live

&gt; TBC and beyond really didn't "fix" hybrids either so much as it gave them the ability to excel at a single role like a pure class
---
I remember hating that. Druids could do EVERYTHING and compete or surpass a class that can literally only do one thing.
---
Felt enormously unfair. Not to mention fucking harvesting in flight form. I literally leveled a druid to max just to abuse that broken shit.
---
I don't remember all the bosses I used to solo as a mage but I did do quite a few. Trial and error really and especially terrain dependent. I use to farm Lord Incendius for the Ace of Elementals. (fire ward and ice barrier helped with that). There were small ledges you could run around the room in and he had abilities that gave you time / you could move out of easily. But yeah like you are saying terrain dependent really matters. There was a couple more but that one I used to run when bored.
---
Does scatter still Dr with freezing trap?
---
stripping someones buffs is bad? this is one of the most fun and tactical ways to stall a rival guild on their raid night. get good lol.
---
good fucking luck with loatheb
---
Weird that Hunter and mage aren't the first mentioned on every comment here. Hunter and mage are THE best farmers for bosses and AOE respectively, specifically for things like maraudon and DM. 
---
Otherwise lock and druid.
---
especially after seeing that other guy bitch today about how annoying world buffs are to farm and how he has to stay logged out for 6 days at a time to preserve them.  would love to kill that dude the instant before he zones in.
---
I get you're trying to be witty but you should know that what you pointed out was a typo and not grammar

Using levitate to rez people over the pools of filth in Naxx, another good one.

I forget the name but the epic yellow cloth robe that dropped around 40+. Pretty sure I got it in hinterlands.

Retail has tight gameplay loops, and few social rewards.

Classic has sandbox-type gameplay and strong social rewards.  
---
Both are competitive in their own way, but different types of players will succeed in each archetype ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

Well, only time will tell. I’m sure they will crunch the numbers and see what they say. I’m looking it from a casual player’s perspective, which will be the majority of players this time around.
---
However, I do imagine that Blizzard will pace it on the slower side to keep those subs going.
---
I dont understand why you're getting so much hate over this information. This is basic information for people to read about hunters. I'm not necessarily an expert on hunters, but I'm leveling a hunter (currently level 38) in the classic beta, and I didn't know about a lot of these things. I would say, a lot of people who don't know about the classic hunter class make good use of this information. It's useful! Thank you for sharing!
---
And they learn by playing the game. Not by having their hand held and giving them warnings about a new game they hadn’t played.
---
Good bot.
---
The monotony of world buffs was a legitimate part of the vanilla Warcraft experience.
---
If the mission statement of Classic WoW is to be as true to the original game as possible, I don't see how you can justify a suggestion like this. By your logic, one could easily argue for putting caps on consumables, making shards stack, or increasing the drop rates on legendary quest items.
---
Well u didn't get it maybe 👀
---
Ya it was pretty valuable too
---
Best thing would be an addon that allow you to put a reason for ignoring the player. It can be hard after a while to remember why someone was ignored.
---
Was just making a joke, no need to justify yourself
---
  As a hunter main myself, I can tell you that hunters should never be competitive in raids as they sort scale well. What you're there for is giving 100 ap  to your group (so you're forced to play 31 mm) and to kite and tranq. But if you join a really casual guild (like guilds that allow rets and moonkins) you can raid as pvp spec, or if there's too many hunters (which there will never be tbh)
---
It doesn't work in read-only mode, it does work if you open it for editing.

Masterloot in a dungeon? L o fucking L

---
Hey guys, just as a fun thought experiment, what about Multiclassing in WoW?  
---
I know I know, I'm with the #nochanges as well, but what would the game be like if you could level up in  different classes? For example, as a Warrior 40, Mage 20? The way I see it you'd visit a class trainer of a different class, do some quest, and  be on your merry way. Whenever you'd gain subsequent levels you'd get to  pick which class you level up as.  
---
Maybe postpone your class choice until after you visit a trainer so you don't make rushed decisions in leveling up in combat.
---
&gt;Errinys
---
That's a name I haven't heard in a long time. Stumbled on the old Thrall kill video and stumbled down memory lane.
---
What makes you think they're actually going to be adding to classic?  I really doubt they will.
---
I find talents more straight forward than what they did in mop and beyond. You know that talents in one tree will  have synergies with each other.
---
The best part is that they give you those little rewards and a small to moderate bump in power at each level.
---
&gt; I’m looking it from a casual player’s perspective, which will be the majority of players this time around.
---
It was the majority of players the first time around.  That doesn’t change anything.  You’re over estimating how long these things all take. You’re not talking casual hours at 2 hours here and there you’re talking basically unsubscribed.  The vast majority of those who stick with classic post launch will not be doing &lt; 8-10 a week.
---
&gt; However, I do imagine that Blizzard will pace it on the slower side to keep those subs going.
---
They’ll pace it to coincide with BFA/RETAIL for the reason you mentioned.  That means expansion to Retail next August and whatever is next for Classic the August after that.  24 months, mark your calendar.  Now we just have to divide that up by phases.
---
&lt;Grand Theft Kudo&gt;
---
I abhor it then.
---
I really don’t see blizzard going into phase 2, 3 months post launch. Maybe 12 months later, but I don’t want to see some stupidly quick 3 months of we unlocked aq and now a new patch is out. That’s waaay too fast for a majority of players who would still be 7/10ths the way through clearing or getting the rep grind done.
---
Yes. this and also the priest's tier 2 set bonus "50% chance to fade upon getting hit". I loved it SO SO SO MUCH! It was my favorite set bonus as a priest.
---
The Green Tower - got it on my hunter... think I sold it for 30g :/
---
&gt;  Not by having their hand held and giving them warnings about a new game they hadn’t played.
---
You mean like modern WoW that holds your hand 24/7 so people are used to that?
---
Maybe a bit of information might prevent global chat being spammed 24/7/365 with things that can be provided in I don't know... an infographic?

Your downvotes are the amount of RP player who will /ignore you
---
I like it but I’m just gonna pull out my old game guides and use those. I’m gonna pretend I don’t know anything.
---
Shadowfang! Used to farm the shit out of SFK for it. Did probably close to 100 runs and then got 2 of them on back to back runs one day. Gave one to my twink and sold the other for a buttload of gold.
---
Not many bosses mages can facetank for sure! And I agree elemental damage of two kinds mages are able to avoid at least!
---
&gt;On private servers, if you wipe in a raid, all you you have to do is go back, pop another Ony head, get Rallying Cry, go to Yojamba, pop another Hakkar head, get the Spirit of Zandalari and you are GOOD to go.
---
I have literally never heard of a private server guild doing this. From your first sentence, you are wrong. The entire like first half of your post is talking about this point that never even happens so I just ignored it.   
---
But then:  
---
"And even for those guilds, raids in Classic will take LONGER, because there won't be private server GMs providing gear and weapons for cash, there won't be world buffs whenever you want, there will be 14% parry vs 5.6%, there won't be Fury Warriors for maximum threat (they will be two-shotted by raid bosses), hence, maximum damage and minimum mana spent, and god knows how much more resistances raid bosses will have, if private servers got it almost 3 times wrong with Parry."  
---
You know there is plenty of people who remember tanking in Arms spec in Vanilla. There are videos from Vanilla of people dual wield tanking bosses. You have zero evidence to back up this claim that fury tanks will be 2 shotted by bosses. In fact, it makes no sense at all. If I can clear MC in prebis gear with a shield on , then when I get full Tier 1, I can get away with taking off my shield to tank the same bosses lol.
---
Druid and rogue are definitely the most vulnerable of those listed, but I included druid because any decently tough (why I left out priest, and suspect Shaman might work) healer that could push the warlock's sustainability over the edge into 'unbreakable' territory without themselves quickly succumbing to the Warrior's onslaught would draw out the battle long enough for the SL warlock's strategy of attrition to dominate.  
---
Also, SB crits could 2shot everything save for the heartiest tanks, and Nightfall allowed 'locks to cast them back to back with no cooldown in between. Doing so was (occasionally) more bursty than PoM-Pyro, although it couldn't be initiated at-will. I saw more than a few sad paladins who watched their warrior go from full HP to dead all within the space of a single heal's cast bar (Albeit a very, very long cast bar. Curse of Tongues, lol)
---
You fuck off nerd no one cares
---
O like the alternate extension idea
---
You aren't a liability unless there is 5 hunters. You max need 3 hunters for kiting and tranqshotting, could probably so it as 2 hunters. Hunters doesn't get that much dmg from gear and their weps doesn't get upgraded that much like other classes.
---
How are you already high enough level to even be in those zones, along with everyone else? You don't start co-mingling with the other faction until your mid-30's in STV &amp; Hillsbrad.
---
Just do aranite bar and salt cds if youre lazy and want free gold
---
So people are used to hand holding so we should continue it?  Idk about that but hey if you need help researching how to play a game then go ahead. 
---
But you think the people who are too lazy to use google and instead uses the global chat is gonna use this?
---
But +dmg isn't a stat stick while leveling.
---
A lot of the multi-zone intercontinental quests are class quests you actually need to do sadly.  There are of course some skippable things too but there’s a lot of those quests that see great, even mandatory, rewards attached.
---
I agree but think the cheap self promotion is the wrong way to look at it. I see it as hilarious and fun content with "community involvement", whether they're the ganker or the gankee. (I may be misinterpreting your comment as a negative) - either way a surprise ganking by 3 troll rogues is awesome, even if it happens to me, I'd laugh :)
---
Sincerely,
---
Horde mage
---
Ah but not what I said though. I said during the WoW time line. 
---
Look at the actions done over the history of WoW not Warcraft as a whole. The mana bomb, The Tree, the destruction of Gilneas, South Shore, the destruction of Pandaria.  Look at the actions done in the past 14 years. The alliance has done very little evil compared to the tons of full on evil shit the horde has done. 
---
All in all both sides have done evil things but the horde has been actively lead by 2 homicidal maniacs.
---
That's fair, initially read it like you were against it even existing.
---
I like this
---
Most escort quests at least.. Don't know if such a guide really exists, Joana's guide as always is pretty good on this but it is a more comprehensive one.
---
Yeah, you made me think, hang on a minute I’ve seen guys looking for gaming buds on Grindr it’s definitely a thing. Where I live there’s a great local gaming community on Facebook too.
---
Can confirm - did wipe in 2005
---
Oh man, some of the runing around quests are the best, especially if you read up all the stuff. Legend of Stalvan is absolutely amazing
---
RPPVP is a casual middle ground for people who want a little taste of both at once but aren’t hardcore in either direction. I think it’s fair.
---
Ok cool, I'll add them to the list of spells. Thank you for this!
---
Eggroll.
---
Most escort quests at least. I don't know if such a guide really exists, but Joana's guide skips some quests and that should give you a pretty good idea on those. Though, as always, Joana's guide is quite a bit more comprehensive than what you ask for.
---
Mumbo great name for a shaman.

I'm going to try to reserve it lol

You dont seem like a well balanced person doe

No its the right place. Thanks
---
&gt;people in this sub "Omg stop asking simple questions, look it up!!!11" 
---
&gt;someone makes a simple to understand slide basic FAQ for new people
---
&gt;"OMG NO HANDHOLDING DonT give them INFO" 
---
It's not like this spoiled the entire game lol. It's literally just explaining some key differences to people that just want to know some basic info about the game they might want to play. Someone coming from Retail might not know any of this. 
---
It is helpful and I could see this being something you'd post in your Retail guild discord to explain some Classic core features.
---
Any quests that sends you in a zone youre not currently in i skip for the moment and complete other quests in the area.then i go back and finish the following quest (or not,depends if the quest is essential as in giving plenty of followup quests or amazing q rewards)
---
Use your logic and dont jump zones for a single quest
---
I used to be in a guild named &lt;STDs are BOP&gt;. I liked that name, but someone reported it and the GM told us it was “Mildly Offensive.”
---
Also, if they had failed the encounter, they would have to reset, right?  
---
That's honestly nutty.
---
So anyone gonna be the hero and list them out or this the usual skull of impending doom, boomerang, FAP list?
---
Ultimately I’d like to get a full T2 and T3 set. Then I’d help farm raids and do a lot of PvP. I struggled to hit 60 before TBC came out last time so it’ll probably take me years to get there.
---
You should clear mc in less than 4 hours and the dings in 1 hour. Bwl shouldn't take more than 6 hours at first. When you get gear, mc should take 2 hours for the non hardcore speedrunners. Bwl should  take 3-4. There's a big difference when it comes to aq and naxx. But they shouldn't take more than 20 hours to clear the first time.
---
probably because of no beta.
---
You do know that this information is available without this picture right?
---
But sure. Keep making up literal fake quotes to back yourself up. It really helps your argument when you make up a quote.
---
Makes sense. I think my memory of it is a bit clouded, and mosts quests are generally worth it if you logically set out a path that doesn't let you run back and forth forever. Think that logic was not all that present 15 years ago.
---
Does anyone know if it was valuable?
---
Took the words right out of my mouth lol
---
I definitely have trouble understanding the logic behind putting effort into getting world buffs. I got them occasionally in vanilla, but no one in my guilds ever made a big deal out of them (including when we were trying to progress in Naxx). Putting in hours of effort to save significantly less time in a raid does not make any logical sense. The only exception I can see is if you're trying to do timed speed runs or something.
---
Kevin Jordan touched on this in the recent classicast.  The problem was that they didn't want to make them too powerful so they nerfed them quite a bit in comparison to pures. So they ended up having to use the talent system to force them to conform to a raiding environment so they would actually be able to participate in a meaningful way.
---
How is this World of Warcraft related?
---
I thought I remembered using summoning stones in Vanilla but it was implemented in very early TBC.  
---
I guess I'll have to level a warlock alt to 30-40 before working on my main.
---
You would have to start from square one and completely reimagine the game. The game would become another game. I want this game
---
I believe it to be true, guess I'll chill out on the idea and go with the flow of the game, try not to be my own biggest obstacle and it should work out fine I guess.
---
Mongoose didn’t exist in vanilla it came out in wod.
---
This is praxis

I don't see this being meta in Classic. Players who went through the hassle of joining a private server are not representative of Classic population imho. I doubt this will be an issue for most relaxed guilds. I don't mind letting speedrunners have these options come Classic.
---
&gt;Seems like the player base wouldn't last long if they didn't.
---
Then you sir, did not play vanilla.
---
There is no need for new content.
---
We don't want level increase, we don't want more BGs, no more raids.
---
We want MC --&gt; Naxx.
---
We want Classic. 
---
Anything different or new can be put on separate servers for those that want it.
---
This can be posted on /r/mmorpg for people interested in classic. And who is to say this won't come up on google? High chance it will.
---
And this isn't hand holding, this is being aware of some key differences that might be knee jerking otherwise.
---
Thanks, I think with some common sense I'll be able to figure it out. Worst case scenario there's at least story attached and herbs around.
---
Jesus, some people are acting butthurt about a simple attempt to inform/remind people. If you don't need it, just ignore it.
---
It's hilarious that people think Blizzard will make Classic amazing, and then shit on it.
---
i don't get your statement? what does this mean? pvp on a pve server?
---
I’m thinking I’ll twink out my alt Priest but it’s gonna have to be 39 coz I’ll be funneling all my cloth over to level tailoring and enchanting and you can’t progress professions far at 19, unfortunately.
---
Having a gaming buddy network that worked a bit like a dating app would be great, though. You could list your gaming style preferences, other interests, what you’re mainly looking for in a buddy and if they should live close by or not. Maybe my perfect gaming buddy is out there somewhere, but I don’t have the means to connect with them!
---
Stormstrike is a 20 sec cd in vanilla? In tbc it’s much lower.
---
Jesus, some people are acting butthurt about a simple attempt to inform/remind people that this info is already on the internet. Everywhere. You can google “did vanilla wow have dual specs?” .
---

---
The devs apparently said Classic+ is a possibility. But hey what do they know!
---
Raiding is all there is to do?
---
Under BWL, which also comes out in phase 2.
---
People keep saying this but it doesn’t make it true.  Provide the link to this mythical dev interview that does anything more than acknowledge the community has brought it to their attention.
---
Yeah, release fresh servers 6 months after Naxx has been out.  After those new servers get to Naxx, maybe start thinking about post-Naxx content.
---
How does it compare to mc or the pre bis gear?
---
Fuck that quest.
---
Jeez, have some trust in our authorities
---
Who knows, maybe she's a very nice lady
---
So ammo is not  a big deal at all, just buy some before every raid or make a level 1 bank to store them, if you forget  it every hunter uses the same ammo anyways since there aren't any good guns. And it aren't a big deal while lvling either unless you have no idea about what's going on and doesn't check your bags. 
---
Pet happiness doesn't mean anything when it's rank 6 (best friend) then you just feed it every time it dies, and it honestly isn't a big deal it it does 100% and not 125% dmg in raids. Same while lvling, they eat a lot when you first tame  them but they don't require that much attention after a bit. And they don't just suddenly run away once you're best friends. I've had my pet die 5 times in a row at unhappy and it was still best friends rank. People really over exaggerate how much they run away.
---
Just look at when stuff originally came out and just assume players are better now and stuff will take less time.
---
MC/Ony - Nov 2004 (launch)  
---
BWL - July 2005  
---
ZG - Sept 2005  
---
AQ - Jan 2006  
---
Naxx - June 2006
---
Some of those gaps are pretty big, but I could see them doing something similar, or slightly faster.  Roughly, it was a little over a year and a half.  Post Naxx in 18 months as you said is actually fairly similar to what happened in vanilla.
---
You're going to have explain it a bit more. So you can only ever level up 59 times but you can split it between any two classes you want?
---
This isn’t hand holding?
---
Making a picture so that people don’t get confused over a video game isn’t hand holding to you?
---
Where’s the picture explaining how to turn on my computer as well since you guys assume people don’t know how google works and will instead spam global chat?
---
Project ascension?
---
If you make a Spotify playlist, please share it here so we can follow it.
---
It looks more like a guide for retail fans who want to feel good about liking the current version more than the classic version.
---
I bet everyone would just use it to look for sex. :P
---
Yeah right, what are you suggesting?
---
It's not like after Lord Perenolde every royal is a traitor!
---
They forgot the part where Classic has 3 identical rogues that will gank you and tell you to go back to Retail.
---
Bwl is after Mc. 
---
Mc is after prebis gear.
---
I was thinking more like every 9 months or so start a new season. Characters on season servers have the option to move to regular servers at the end of the season. You could have progression leaderboards and everything.
---
Because it aligned with how classic was. They could release all bgs on day 1 if they wanted. Bgs didn't exist at the start of vanilla wow, or honor for that matter. So they are holding the release so it resembles how the original classic wow launch was. Wsg and AV came out either at the same time or really close to each other. AB was later on added, idk the exact time tables but you could Google for more info.
---
It was around 150g at the time. There was a rare spawn in DM that dropped it a lot so it wasn't incredibly rare.
---
&gt;I miss the times when games were created by nerds for nerds.
---
Dang that's a good line. Now they're made by shareholders for whales.
---
For raiding it's probably worse than prebis depending on you class. Like if you're a warrior or warlock you're going to need a shit ton of +hit for prebis whereas pvp gear doesn't have much hit. If it's itemised well for your class (like rogue for example) it's fairly similar to tier 1 (MC set).
---
Neat! I'd love to see more speculation like this.
---
You and me both brother!
---
No one is rushing, but what's the value in waiting around after the starting gunshot?
---
If you stretch the releases far enough that the majority of your playerbase stagnates, it's going to be worse off for the entire community than the benefits of allowing casuals to keep pace with more dedicated raiders.
---
And even at that, what does it matter if casuals progress slower?
---
Any boss that you can reliably one shot without dying and loseing your buffs is not at the highest level, it's farm content.
---
1.14 Content confirmed.
---
Nope.. BC / Classic two different games. Don't care about BC. This is a Classic subreddit.
---
I don't know about that. I've been watching mages in beta very easily kite huge packs of mobs without being hit. And they cine from very close range without taking damage
---
Ya it was pretty valuable too.
---
That just made it worse
---
Would like to get Lok'Delar.
---
Also to have a rogue with Thunderfury.
---
Pretty much! You start at level 1 in a class, of course, but could theoretically get 59 levels in a different class. Or maybe the feature is unlocked at 10, or 20? I don't know.  
---
I think a Warlock/Paladin would be ridiculous. Basically a healing, demon pet summoning death knight kind of thing.
---
That or Rogue/Mage.
---
I was briefly in Chupathingy in mid-late Cataclysm. Unfortunately I don't recognize the folks listed. In Cata I remember that Ramses (Shaman) was leading the guilde and that Hubavec (rogue) and Mx (Shaman) were longtime members. Possibly also Ching (priest). 
---
Maybe you'd recognize some of these names: https://imgur.com/x48HWYx
---
I get where the no-lifers/race-to-the-finish people are coming from, and I get where you're coming from, too! 
---
I'm in the middle; I'm mid-30s, married, have a house and job and all the responsibilities that come along with those things. I usually have a good amount of time in the afternoons/evenings to play, but nothing compared to some of the no-lifers out there. I think a part of me wants to rush to the cap so I don't get left behind, but the rest of me just wants to try and enjoy the game for what it is.
---
I just want a release schedule that lets me feel like there's no rush to get things done. 
---
It'd be nice if my husband could play and feel like he'll still be able to do things when he hits the cap, too. He's a PM and we're barreling into construction's busy season, so his phone loves to ring 4am through 8pm all week long through, like, November. :| But I suspect a more relaxed release schedule for the phases won't do anything to help fix that issue. 
---
The playerbase is aging and we all have more responsibilities! But there's no way I can expect Blizzard to cater to people like my husband who might pop on the game once a week. I don't think I personally would get bored, if I found a fun group of people to play with, but I'm certain a lot of people would, and the game drying up between content patches is the last thing I want. :(
---
It was so good they made it into a Talent for SV in TBC.
---
Didnt blizzard make a post yesterday stating they wont enforce rp rules?
---
Cut your losses
---
I’m playing on very busy PS atm and if you /who in any area I’m typically seeing one Druid total. You’ll be in demand especially if your willing to tank dungeons leveling up.
---
Depends on your class. Hunters have a great R10 set with tons of crit and it's on par with BWL/ZG content.
---
Does Method determine the patch cycle on retail? No? Well than dont worry about it.
---
Dude holy shit get over it and ignore the picture if you don’t need it I don’t see why this is such a big deal to you
---
There is much more and I won't call old talent system complex, complex talent tree is shit like in PoE
---
Go back to your private server, vanilla was never that tryhardy.
---
Ascension did away with barriers just about completely. Instead, I'm suggesting fixed paths and ability progression as-is, but being able to get multiple classes.
---
And T3 Shaman. Particularly Tauren Shaman.
---
I feel like this is a MUCH bigger deal for you. Why are you taking a picture so serious?
---
Eh, sorry, but the R14's did their task of helping others during the earlier ranks. The fact that you were unable to place any trust in people and got burned as a result is just fully justified. I also have no clue where you're getting your timespans from. I've never experienced the queue being longer than a month. People cannot be expected to stick at R13 longer than 2-3 weeks so anyone suggesting the queue is longer than that is bullshittig or has a really dumb PvP group in which everyone believes they can hit R14 and everyone calls dibs. People need to be ready and waiting at R13 to call dibs and that should naturally limit the queue to like 3 weeks. If you can't be ready then R12/13 is simply the end of the line for you.
---
And returning to the Trust thing... Honestly this is still just identical to standing in line literally anywhere. I mean the people ahead of me won't help me retain my spot in line and the people behind me I dunno about yet, so I better cut the line and just don't give a shit because I'm more important anyway. Sorry but I have still yet to see someone whine about the queue and not have brought the problems upon themselves by their own behaviour.
---
That’s generally what I used my ignore list for. That way it was easy to check while in game.
---
Respect for putting up with toxic kids like you while sucking their cash; a true masterpeace!
---
You’re the one telling me and others that a priest is horrible for solo leveling when you’re wrong. They aren’t amazing, but they are one of the more efficient, with the least downtime.  Is it fun? That subjective and can be debated. But you aren’t required to level in a group at all. Warrior aren’t either (and they at THE worst solo leveling class).
---
As someone else said, and I agree, Vanilla and Classic are dangerous, not hard. They are less forgiving to fuck ups, but that doesn’t make it challenging.
---
As for engaging, that very much depends on your class/spec. A priest for example, that primarily wands and uses SWP, it’s not engaging. You spend most of your time in one spot effectively just autoattacking a mob.
---
I wasn’t toxic until you tried to insinuate I had no clue what I was talking about. I’ve leveled a priest in vanilla, I know what it’s actually like. You, however, are talking out of your ass about something then trying to backtrack and call me toxic for letting you know how wrong you are. Rather appear toxic than plain stupid.
---
There will probably be only one Oceanic server.
---
Most of my wipes at least in private servers were regular ass pulls that just went sloppy.
---
How could a mere adventurer such as yourself know what sort of advice the lady prestor is giving to your good king

Male toon? Human.

Female toon? Dwarf.

I found this video on an old hard drive and thought I'd share it here.  It includes a cluttered UI, bad framerate, ability clicking, and keyboard turning.  A true vanilla experience. :)
---
As nature intended.  Are they bringing back old ZG and Naxx?
---
I seem to be waaay older than everyone on this reddit. So my question is, how did you get your parents to pay for the subscription? Were you rich or was there some kind of blackmail involved?
---
This is a pretty unique situation we the people have created! 
---
I think it’s important to remember that we are in uncharted territory and regardless of what random strangers seem to bark online, their opinion, essentially, doesn’t matter. 
---
The main aspect no one seems to be talking about, is that Blizzard will have to balance two distinct WoW games. This has never happened before. 
---
Will classic and retail co-exist? Or will they compete against each other? 
---
At launch they will coexist. But, after several months, data will drive this paradigm. And ultimately, profit will drive data interpretations. 
---
Your participation in classic will add to the data that suggests Activision needs to focus on revenue streams for classic which includes the possibility of new content. 
---
There seems to be a lot of concern about streamers. This is silly. There are dozens of impactful streamers and possibly hundreds of YouTube personalities who are being used. They are being used for free advertising and building hype with no risk to Blizzard. No art team, no PR team, no advertising team, means there’s no overhead and no ad space costs. 
---
This is a direct contradiction to BFA’s release. While “Daughter of the Sea” was amazing in its own way, it cost money for no direct revenue. 
---
Blizzard knows streamers are a cheap resource for broadcasting out, not a voice of the community for taking in. 
---
Play the game you like, the way you like. In the end, content progression, or not, will be based off your actions and not your Reddit posts.
---
SPELL BATCHING
---
You'll always remember the sex though. It'll even get better as you age.
---
I was thinking about this very thing in the shower this morning. I never would have thought after leaving WoW at the start of Cata, that I would someday look forward to coming back and running sm or dm again some day, I am very much looking forward to this.
---
Rogue stealth walking animation is wrong.
---
Does anyone concern about faction balance on classic? I feel like we can end up with horde/alliance only servers.
---
Most of the escort quests are not worth it because of all the RP walking.
---
&gt;None of us are here for the casual experience.  
---
Sure we are. I like classic mainly for the social changes, getting rid of cross server/lfg/lfr and the like (personally I'd like to  get rid of xrealm battlegrounds too, but we're using the wrong patch for that).
---
He’s bi-spectual
---
I accept the new Banjo Kazooie meme.
---
Are you being serious right now? You can’t have never heard of the barrens. Maybe you should ask yourself if you even WoW. This has to be trolling.

Thanks for this having trouble getting this to work properly even when downloading it and running it locally on the PC.

---
Nope! This was in vanilla on Dark Iron. My first to 60
---
Talent trees are now like 3 choices per tier and instead you pick a spec.  So like a frost mage has the same 3 talent choices as a fire or arcane mage at each tier, but they learn some frost specific passives and spells as they level up.
---
Trying to decide if you're being sarcastic, or not? You can still flag for pvp anytime you want.
---
Should do Druid/Rogue Warlord set -- the flaming shoulders would look pretty cool in Vector I think.
---
Don’t get your hopes up, that’s how we ended up with 10 expansions in the first place. This is very common for a lot of other games too. Everyone flies to fast and devs quickly release stuff to keep the minority that puts the majority of hours and money into it.
---
No one knew at the time

#CLASSIC
---
Has there been any blue post about services?  I’d be willing to be a small pony that we eventually get race/faction changes, even if it’s not there on launch.
---
Machine gun rhythm perfectly explains the way XQC speaks
---
What? If that would be the case you would see something like "The talent system are vastly more complex... but you have the same amount of viable builds as on retail". It's absolutely neutral.
---
How do you say portmanteau

Unfortunately your post has been removed by our AutoModerator because it seems to be a poll.

---
Do you have experience with a balance druid yourself? If so how did you choose your professions during lvling? Been thinking more about it the past few days and may opt for a resto spec in phase 1, and then shift over to balance in phase 2 when better gear is available. But yes I have heard engineering is very good.
---
Not sarcastic i just don't know/get most stuff. I can play on a Pve Server but still change later?
---
Just a heads up - yes, I know Classic+ servers make some people upset. It's a hypothetical third server option assuming it wouldn't effect pristine realms. Yes, I know Classic isn't out yet (again, rather, since it was finished in 2006). It's just a for-fun poll.
---
I guess we could compare quest rewards / repair bills / raid consumables?  I cba though.
---
isnt BWL phase 2?
---
That just sounds equally very strong, but this time with a thesaurus.
---
The warlock list has quite a few incorrect choices.
---
That would be a Death Knight.
---
Rogue/Mage would be meh...
---
A Rogue that could wear Plate however and heal....
---
ROGUEADIN!
---
Its about MC gear
---
Ah yeah my bad - bgs and bwl are out at 3
---
&gt; Making a picture so that people don’t get confused over a video game isn’t hand holding to you?
---
There isn't much detail, some quick information to be aware of.
---
It's not giving you full walkthrough "Do A, click here, do this, go here for this item, then talk to XYZ". THAT is hand holding. It is doing far beyond "here's something to be aware of", and information that is found in the user manual.
---
Again this isn't just for people who browse this subreddit, have played on private servers, or played back in the day necessarily. This is for those who haven't.
---
... you play games much? Lots of people treat chats as google.
---
"Why do we need to power through content? What is the reasoning to not suspend the rat-race for a second and just have fun?"
---
truuu
---
I started in TBC. Were there really no summoning stones in vanilla? How did 40 man raids even begin?
---
I played orginal vanilla WoW and forgot that paladin /shaman were faction exclusive.
---
i'm going to play tauren shaman, 30/0/21, all elemental baby
---
Not much detail but enough details to be important to make a picture.
---
Look at the words they use to describe the changes. They are all presented as a burden or a limit compared to retail.
---
I still want to know if achievements will be added. Pets you've collected in retail like collectors edition ones will they come over? Will we have a stats page? Stuff like that that isn't so obvious.
---
Wait what? Are you saying you want that then?
---
You do know by saying that you agree with me right?
---
I got The Untamed Blade and Claw of the Black Drake in the same BWL run on my warrior. probably my most memorable day in gaming.
---
I wasn’t gonna bother with this, but you caught my comment in time so fuck it. I’ve seen you comment on this more than anyone else, getting mad because someone posted a picture online trying to help people. I don’t know why you need to be such a cynical asshole getting upset over this, but get over it. OP is trying to help people who need and want it.
---
Warlocks
---
The same guy is on Asmongold's stream right now, and he still can't die: https://www.twitch.tv/asmongold
---
Banjo hype?? Where
---
They are popular, but from what I saw undead/Druid or warrior/Druid were our nasty matchups in TBC. Granted, warrior has fear, but you’ll be stunned by a warrior far more than feared.
---
I can see both sides. I know the stun resist got nerfed but at least there’s a 5% meta gem, so it wouldn’t be that different in the end.
---
And in better more demanding guilds, ya just showed up on time.
---
Always bench warmers ready to take your place.
---
It differs from expac to expac the inflation between classic and WoD was enormous though
---
Ok so do you get max rank of spells you unlock or are they limited to your level in that class? If you have 40 levels warlock and 20 levels in mage does that mean you can only cast rank 3 frostbolt or what?
---
&gt;I’ve seen you comment on this more than anyone else
---
...because I get people like you who keep adding in their 2 cents like it means anything, of course im going to reply to people who reply to me.
---
But you getting mad at me getting mad is making me laugh so let me put on a shocked face as you call me angry lol
---
Don’t you only get to cross level a class with 2 levels in DnD? Might depend on which version.
---
Cant say I've ever heard of it.  Is it near ironforge?
---
Too bad I'll never get a raid spot
---
You sir are an idiot

It's seven bullet points.  At most.  So many things are turned into "infographics" that are just a waste of space.

Nice. I really wish more people would upload their old pvp vids from vanilla. It's really helpful for beta testing because it can sometimes be used to compare behaviours of mechanics and stuff. :-)

I always found /golfclap to be EXTREMELY effective on gankers.

In fact, I even macro'd it and have had rogues stop *dead in their tracks* once I started to emote it. I'm talking dead-to-rights I'm done for they're levels higher than me in STV and I /golfclap and WHAM. Dead. Stop.
---
Something about it man, it really gets to 'em.
---
*hhnnngg*
---
Also skills cost money now so factor that in if you’re wanting to save some gold!
---
The name sounded cool and Blizz went with it.
---
Let me just consult my crystal ball and get back to you on that one!
---
Idk how Nintendo wrangled the Rareware license back from Microsoft. I didn't think I'd ever see another Rare title on their platforms, maybe there's hope for decent games on the N64 Classic if they ever release it.
---
Don't speak for me please. I don't want that.
---
I doubt it considering even exalted BG reps give better gear than MC
---
“vastly more complex”
---
I luld
---
Well I would be happy if this helped in some way.  It can be hard to make out some of the things happening because of the low resolution, but that was the best my computer could do back then lol.
---
While leveling, healing gear won't do you no good. So rolling on damage items (things you actually need) is justified in my opinion. 
---
People getting mad about that don't understand leveling progression or are just mad that why have to share.
---
you got your panties in a wad over a youtube video?
---
Yeah why not just copy the DnD multiclassing rules while we're at it!
---
Not if it's a racial favored class. At least in 3.5, not sure about 4.0
---
I predict there will be lots of night elf hunters, just like in 2004
---
Tbqh it depends on what class we talkin about. It’ll be easier to have your ony mc gear at the start of phaSe 2 than farm R10 through world pvp
---
Can't you just tell us what they are directly so we don't have to listen to some guy ramble on in 1000 words what could be said in a few?
---
I'm sure aoe grinding is just fine once you have Blizzard in your arsenal.  Probably have to burn Blink to escape all the melee hits or backpedal apparently, idk.
---
makes me hope their relationship gets better with this :)
---
I hope he stabs the other guy and leaves him on the ground to bleed out.
---
Super cool
---
And boy are they in for a rude awakening hahahahha
---
Ooga!
---
I mean, personally, that sounds perfect. But I'd rather place the long term health of the game and strong player retention ahead of the phasing pacing that I'd prefer. Hopefully those that plough through content will have a similar outlook
---
the discussion is complexity not meaningful impact. you can argue today's system is more meaningful, impactful, engaging, whatever else you like about it. but you can't argue picking 7 talents over the course of 100 levels is more complex than vanilla's system. that's just simply incorrect
---
I think it’d be worth seeing if some really old items could be recovered. Might be sitting on some serious treasure.
---
Many people were able to reclaim stuff like the WotLK pre-patch set during Legion, if that tells you anything about how far their data can save back.
---
I'd love for them to implement this...or hell, even a gw1 version.
---
I think raid, not instance. Who cares if someone uses world buffs for world first SM run
---
Hack him?

So what's incorrect about what's been said in that specific post exactly? Not the "10 times" thing but that actual statements about difficulty. I'm not trolling I'm actually curious.
---
Exactly!!!
---
The unfortunate truth is that no one has hard data on this.  We only have Blizzard at their word, and the bottom line is that we also know the average internet connection sucked ballsack back then.  
---
What seemed 'ok' back then may not seem so great today.  I am sure it is off, but I am not sure it is as far off as some seem to be claiming.

---
I apologize if it was misunderstood then
---
The Hyjal zone terrain was in Vanilla but blocked off from legales means of exploration. It’s likely that Blizzard intended to add NPCs, quests, a raid, and other content in a later patch, but had to scrap that idea because of timelines. Instead, we got a development of the zone later.
---
I would guess that this map was designed in the earlier stages of Vanilla development and not corrected before it shopped.
---
Sure, if you guys don't want wbuffs that's fine. You need to understand that Vanilla is a game for melee and casters scale far better with wbuffs than melee do with wbuffs. With Classic having lower armor than other places out there you will need to understand that the DPS gap becomes even wider between melee and casters. Yes, your Warriors won't be doing 3k DPS anymore in MC on some fights, but the gap between what you and your Mage buddy could do will be further apart than with wbuffs.
---
Keep that in mind.
---
Just watched the last episode today, for the like 10th time.
---
I don't really care which way it is, because I don't mind people treating chat as google. But your statement was:  
---
"... you guys assume people don’t know how google works and will instead spam global chat ..."  
---
People do exactly this.   
---
People even go to places like Reddit to ask questions that they could very easily google.
---
Then my dwarf rogue will be named Gubber.
---
Yes, they’re releasing content in “phases” so ZG, Dire Maul etc won’t be there at launch
---
I was on Mal’Ganis too, cool to see it up here
---
The "no dungeon finder" is such a meme honestly. It gives away that boomer scent from the info.
---
Current endgame content in retail: raiding (no dungeon finder), m+ (no dungeon finder).  
---
There's a group finder instead of the spam in the chat, but I'm pretty sure there'll be one for classic as well on the web (like there is for autochess - qihl.gg). But even if there won't be one, it's arguably a plus. Scrolling through chat spam is awful.
---
There's a decent chance of somebody replying with "lol what about lfr u retard" and if you really think that LFR (and heroic/normal dungeons) is endgame content then you never played retail and therefore isn't allowed to voice your opinion on the subject in the first place.
---
Yea, that happened in early 2005 when loot lag was still a thing.  They did fix this by like 1.3~ along with the upgraded servers.  
---
Unfortunately, we have videos from the early days, middle, and late days of vanilla and just as many anecdotal stories from many people that contradict one another.  The bottom line is that you were not able to 'effectively' hamstring kite or cripple poison exploit by the end of vanilla.  
---
There are also videos of mages farming hearthglen and still getting hit quite a ways despite enemies being nova'd, and most mages would nearly die every time they rounded enemies up because of it.
---
I wish I could experience this
---
I guarantee they will implement meeting stones. I may have played late vanilla but I *never* got lock summoned. Not once.
---
This is correct
---
You could have amazing utility, but it would probably be trash from an end-game min-max point of view, since the strongest end-game builds all specialise in one field, and sacrificing your top end damage/healing/tanking abilities in order to get some worthless low level abilities is pretty counterproductive.
---
The good abilities are, again, those utility effects that are still good at high level without scaling. For example, speed boosts, utility buffs (Unending Breath?), and certain other abilities that only have one rank.
---
It could be interesting in PvP though, where you could get stuff like dedicated flag carriers that are specced to get every possible speed boost available in their bracket.
---
The exceptions are armour and weapon proficiency, which don't translate well to this system. I would guess that you can learn any weapon from any of your classes, but the WS cap is limited by your levels in classes that can actually use the weapon, and multiclassing any weapon based class with something that can't use the right weapon would suck, a lot. But, dropping a single level in Warrior or Hunter opens up a ton of stat-stick options for Druids. If a single level in Warrior also unlocks leather, chain and shields, then Druid 59/Warrior 1 would probably be an excellent tanking build.
---
Overall, good for Feral Druids. Would make twinking more interesting. Worthless for most classes at raid level, since you end up losing your most important stuff. Probably fun for casual players that aren't interested in end-game progression.
---
Is there a place we can find the schedule currently? What patch is what? I don’t remember any of it anymore.
---
When he brings his own 2 liter soda and cup nonchalant in to a restaurant getting lunch with the guild...man now I wanna rewatch this show
---
The resolution is actually quite good compared to most other 2004-2006 vanilla videos lol
---
Did you even read the comment chain before adding your 2 cents?
---
The guy said that this picture would be good so that people wouldn't spam global chat with simple questions. By saying that people will do it no matter what shows how pointless this picture is because the information is already out there.
---
Word brutha - Tauren Hunter here and same.
---
Yes, but it's also true. I'd rather people knew exactly what they're getting into rather than complain later.
---
This has not been talked about at any point lol...
---
I speak for all the people who is gonna split classic community into BC and Wrath in the near future ;)
---
That background music.....
---
r/warcraftlore
---
As if I needed reminding
---
bae lyfe
---
There is an issue with that, if you only can play 2 hours a night, and don't have any other time, raiding shouldn't be a priority for you, I'm not familiar with raid times in classic so someone can correct me if I'm wrong but you are looking at minimum 3+ hours on raids probably. So if all you want to do is raid I hope you can find a guild that can work with your schedule so you get what you want out of the game :)
---
I think there will be more warriors than before. I don’t think everyone realized the potential of that class on release back then because of how hard they were to level compared to other classes.
---
The only point I usually disagree with is the "more complex" talent system. Sure, there are more boxes to put points in, but it doesn't really give you more flexibility than retail WoW specs/talents imho. It's more an illusion of choice than anything really.
---
BLACKED
---
The issue is that it did happen, but perhaps not to the current degree.  
---
A lot of people seem to be forgetting that after 1.3 (very early in vanilla), you could not do things like effectively hamstring kite mobs as a warrior.  You would typically take a couple auto attacks as you ran away even though it didn't 'look' like you should. 
---
We have people who have merely forgotten and/or have played on pservers which further strays from how it actually was.
---
With that said; the question for me is whether or not that should have been the case?  Bottom line is that the game was designed around crap internet speeds and piss poor computers/laptops back then.
---
I would also add more info such as:
---
Zone levels don’t scale (I learned this as a lvl 13 undead warrior wondering into WPL)
---
You can purchase your slow mount at 40 and the fast one at 60 (and they are WAAAY more expensive)
---
You need to learn your second level of armor skill.
---
Pallys and warlocks have quests for their mounts
---
Your best in slot may not be your type of armor class (IE: a high level warrior using chain instead of plate)
---
Almost all classes need all stat values (exceptions are warriors and rouges not needing intellect and having less use for spirit) those are also the only classes without mana
---
Every class has a ranged subweapon except pally/shams who use other things I can’t remember the name of
---
Many pieces of gear don’t show up till strangely high levels (no shoulders till 20 normally and no trinkets until around 40 or so)
---
Elites are nearly impossible to solo
---
No cross-realm play
---
You can toggle pvp on some servers, but on others it’s always on
---
Some NPCs are not tethered (they will chase you forever)
---
Twinks run the battlegrounds and victory depends on what team has more players do the 1 correct strat
---
Please tip your mage/warlock taxis
---
Stats have soft and/or hard caps (15% hit rating comes to mind)
---
Proper order of blame: hunter&gt;warlock&gt;who ever died first (not tank)
---
Dragons have tail whip and cleave
---
NPCs can crit you
---
Your spell elements matter (resistances and enhancements can affect individual elements)
---
Killing a player doesn’t stop their DOTs
---
lol 😂 good luck on that

"The issue with this is that streamers are no-lifers. While they have income from playing the game all day, I can only play for 2 hours a night if that. That person doesn’t represent me at all."
---
Hey look it's the US government! 
---
Sorry for the off topic remark just couldn't help it that was too good.
---
..Wasnt the very first 60 ever in WoW a shaman?
---
Wotlk was my favorite expac but i was young and do not remember the talent trees! How different was it?
---
Hmm, so he knows how to replicate it, and he's abusing it :(
---
So this is a bug/exploit and it's more than batching.
---
I played warrior and no lifed it in vanilla and TBC.  In both iterations you could not hamstring kite effectively like you can on pservers.  Yet we have tons of people claiming to the contrary on this subreddit.. probably never even having seen or played vanilla first hand.  
---
I also remember watching my hunter friend (from afar of course) kiting one of the mobs for the bow quest, and if he was anything closer than max range he would pretty much get 1 shot by a melee attack from a range that made absolutely no sense. 
---
We all have anecdotal evidence is the thing.  So many of these videos we've seen shown as supposed 'proof' aren't showing every possible contrast or situation that can arise, nor are all of them post 1.3 when they further added range compensation.
---
&gt; When killing players in a party or a raid, everyone in the party/raid get an equal share of the Honor gained per kill.
---
You are likely right, and unfortunately a lot of people on this subreddit are in denial and most of them probably never played vanilla first hand outside of a pserver.  
---
Things like effective hamstring kiting and poison exploits were not a thing in vanilla after 1.3
---
You sacrifice it and remain petless to maintain the buff.
---
I don't know of a calculation, but have friends that have told me that:
---
1) 1000g in Classic was about $150-200
---
2) 1000g in BFA is worth about $0.15
---
Gold is worth 99.9% less today.
---
Hey thanks asshole.
---
I was deep into twink scene during tbc, wranglers were the best. Bought for around 3000g...
---
Some guides make it sound as if the amount of damage dealt to the HK assigns different amount of CP. is level and rank more important?
---
This needs the clip: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urNyg1ftMIU
---
"CHRONICLE OF THE ANNOYING QUEST", best WoW web series along with the guild. Power through the first couple of episodes as the vid quality and voice acting get better
---
Completely forgot about that disgusting piece... thanks for making me remember omg.. not. Lol
---
Right on!  What guild were you in?
---
If you pull 4 mobs in retail you face roll them if you pull 4 mobs in classic you die, hows that not more difficult
---
I dont know about people not realizing Warriors potential. Need to remember your [World of Roguecraft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXX8URSUWm0).
---
I was one then, and so I shall be again.
---
There was always some form of what we are seeing.  Idk if it differed mechanically back then as opposed to now (likely due to newer engines), but enemies always had... funky ranges to say the least back then, and sometimes not always consistently.  
---
People need to keep in mind that we are playing a downported game as well.  This isn't vanilla remastered, it is BFA engine downgraded into a stripped game, based on whatever vanilla data they have.  Which keep in mind is clearly not 100% all there considering some of the crazy differences we've been seeing. 
---
For example... new engine does not allow for skeletons of players to persist very long, yet in vanilla they had to have lasted around an hour long (maybe longer).  Why isn't something like that there despite data most likely being available?  Because the engine is not allowing it to function.

Nothing but ganking crusader farmers at scarlet spellbinders and farming recipe myself too. Good times
---
Hope so.
---
O O G A !
---
The only question I always have with this: how about mp5?
---
I'm especially talking about shamans, as they don't have a mana regen during combat talent like druids and priets and have to benefit the most from the 5 sec rule.
---
So with ele and enh you want to frontload dmg spells so you don't have to cast anytbing for a while and you mana starts to regen again.
---
Isn't this the same for healing? Just cast the biggest rank heal spel (don't overheal ofc) and just let your mana regen after 5 sec etc...
---
I’m so hyped to revive my old 19 rogue :)
