Decent podcast man, good effort.

Hey now people don't need to know about this ü§ê
---
He is trying to get rank 3 while he levels but hes also trying to level as fast as possible. The reality is there is very little difference between the leveling speed of Fury and Arms. And if you get ganked and die while you are leveling because you can't intercept the mage, then you just got set back way more than you gained by being Fury. He still got to lvl 60 in 5 days /played on a warrior. So maybe if he was Fury and noone every ganked him he would shave like max 5% of that off.  Maybe that is relevant if you are super try hard. But for the vast majority of players, the difference in mob kill time is completely negligible. If you are on a pvp server, you will run into enemy faction at some point or another, and in Fury you will likely get dropped if they open on you.  
---

---
Also, as has been said many times and you continue to ignore, /sit to get crit is likely not going to work on Classic. This makes Fury far worse and essentially removes anything you gain from being Fury over Arms. Fury is only marginally faster than arms with /sit to crit working.  
---

---
It's 6 seconds.  On a 1 minute CD.
---
Worst case you will still be able to take off your gear, die, and run back. It's slower but probably still faster than other forms of farming depending on your class.
---
At the moment I‚Äôm pretty regularly listening to, naming just 5, Fivethirtyeight Politics, Stay Tuned, Imaginary Worlds, 99% Invisible, and Planet Money. I guess that would be top 5. 
---
Well, SotC is supposed to be good for procing Weapon effects, Enchants (like Fiery) and Trinket ‚Äúon hit‚Äù procs, and more JoL, JoW procs. 
---
It gives you an extra 40% swing speed while nerfing your swing damage by 40%‚Äîyou can tell the devs wanted this to be ‚Äúthe procing Seal.‚Äù
---
The huge blunder during 1.9 was misprogramming SoR to behave as two separate weapon swings instead of one seing + a Holy dmg effect. This means you‚Äôre constantly double-procing all of the above. 
---
SoR wasn‚Äôt fixed to not be a second weapon swing until 2.0.1 I believe.
---
the hero we don't deserve 
---
Lol. No.
---
It‚Äôs cool, man. I‚Äôm not trying to assert you‚Äôre doing it wrong. I‚Äôm just trying to say I‚Äôm not your target demographic.
---

&gt;When Classic hits you WILL be rock-hard !

You don't need to get hard if you never leave your PC
---
Ask for pve specs, get detailed pvp spec
---
I won‚Äôt be looking up the fights and really want to find a group of people out there who want to figure it out themselves. If I can‚Äôt then I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôll raid. 
---
Oh, yeah I shouldn‚Äôt have said sheep lol, I just call most CC effects sheeps, haha. It‚Äôs basically a second HoJ. But you‚Äôre right, at 60 it‚Äôs not even going to matter. Might as well throw that last point into Vindication. 
---
Oh no I totally get that, all good!
---
I sometimes use the smart speed feature in Overcast, but I don‚Äôt really enjoy speeding up podcasts. Most content has an intentional rhythm and pacing that gets disrupted when one messes with speeds, in my opinion. 
---
I‚Äôll tell you this much, my inbox today indicates that the product is well received. 
---
How I make a reminder bot. Help a classic entusiats with no internwt conection for the next week
---
This sounds to difficult, like having to compete for mob tags on launch or be clever about going to less congested zones during launch.
---
Better to solve the issues by leveraging Activision Blizzard's technology like sharding.
---
"Holy warrior" always seemed so cool to me. Sad that they weren't viable :(
---
"I'll believe it when I see it"
---
The motto for Classic. Here's hoping for the best.
---
Nah right after I'm done with my master defensio :)
---
I have the same issue, I feel so tired after work so I end up laying in bed watching GoT or youtube for 5 hours straight, wanting to get up and play a game but never have the motivation.  Though, I would play the Private server I got to 16 on, but I don't want to ruin the experience further/get burnt out.  Goodluck figuring it out man.
---
I hear what you're saying.
---
But it's simply not going to be the case for most players. I played during retail Vanilla and I play on pservers. I'm in a Naxx progressed guild. I know more about Vanilla than I knew possible.
---
And yet I still feel the magic every time I ride my mount into a zone, every time I log on even.
---
Not everyone wants that. That‚Äôs the whole point of this post. Give everyone the launch experience they want by letting them choose which one they want.
---
You want sharding, some people don‚Äôt. I can‚Äôt convince them that sharding is better and I doubt I could convince you no sharding is better. The point is to give you both what you want.
---
 Enjoy that Nelf Hunter  roll.  It will be epic.  
---
I plan to bargain my souls (wich I was collecting) to get more time to play.
---
That's interesting... that wasn't my experience on [REDACTED] server.
---
But I can see what you're saying. At least you can bank your cloth for a bit.
---
That being said, there is some things that people overlook when they talk about fresh server economies:
---
Inflation and opportunity cost.
---
People understand that gold becomes less valuable in time because of inflation, but that also means that gold is far more valuable (you can do more with it) in the beginning.
---
So even if you're selling cloth for less than you would in a month, the gold and silver you get *now* is far more valuable.
---
And opportunity cost means that if you don't have gold *now* you miss out on a lot. Having just that bit of more gold early on means that you can do so much more, buy up important mats, afford your epic mount earlier (which is so important).
---
Personally I'll only be leveling first aid and will sell most of my cloth (keeping enough for some quests like the outhouse quest in Searing Gorge).
---
Someone else in the thread finally said it:
---
&gt;Also the spawned mobs from engienering gets scaled with your engineering skill. So at 315 skill you are spawning level 63 mobs. (Mechanical chicken/dragon)
---
So it's far from irrelevant. Also note that if you're engi just for PvP, you should still level it to max level (300) and not just enough to use battle chicken (in tier 1 content) because your battle chicken will be more effective if you're 300 engi.
---
Man reading this suddenly made me sad thinking about how some industrial farms are treating them. Glad someone out there is dishing some love as well. 
---
&gt;hard to imagine they can't optimize it better when they know the end goal and what to expect.
---
It is hard to believe that Activision Blizzard does so amazingly poorly.
---
It's 2019 and they still can't make PvP in BfA not lag, with "better technology."
---
The big thing is that the new technology is largely a cost cutting feature, using less server resources idling, and not really a performance gain.
---
A whole server blade would be used for each realm back in retail Vanilla, at every hour of the day, whether there is 20 or 2,000 people online.
---
But with modern infrastructure, everything is outsourced onto clouds, so only as much server resources as is needed at that moment is used.
---
This makes it orders of magnitude cheaper to run at times, but performance can and does suffer.
---
This is why it's perfectly realistic that Activision Blizzard wouldn't spend the money needed to make Classic run even as good as Vanilla, let alone better than it, in these large world pvp scenarios.
---
Right click *reported.*
---
BURN IN RIGHTEOUS FIRE
---
Based on how Heroic Lich King progression went, I could just see Blizzard banning anyone who used SoR if they had JoL/JoW up.
---
&gt; That just isn't accurate.
---
(Shrug)
---
Lots of other people who seem to know what they are talking about say the opposite of what you are saying. And what they are saying accords with my memory of how things went in retail.
---
So I suspect you are repeating things you have heard from pirate server apologists which are factually wrong. Pirate server players seem to have this need to rewrite history to make their servers more blizzlike than they are, possibly to add a false gloss of credibility to their pirate server achievements. Clearing content seems to mean more if you pretend that there were no really major mechanics changes that made it far, far easier than it ever was when it was current in retail.
---
Good luck finding a guild that will give you both Thundefury and Atiesh!
---
Honestly, it's changing. I can't speak for all industrial farms, but many are trying to improve their conditions. It's really hard though. As more and more people want product you need more and more product. The obvious result is industrial farming on a wicked scale. Sometimes even such that the animals and people are mistreated. But with things like organic produce, which has its own problems, and cage-free policies, farms are able to offset the cost of lower volume sales with higher profits. Before if you didn't produce enough you simple we're unable to survive. Now you can enter these overall niche markets.
---
It's not all roses and rainbows though. Cage free doesn't mean well-treated and organic doesn't mean healthy. Research the brand if you care.
---
Hi Mechanon84,
---
Thanks for the feedback, I'm definitely more than open to it and have made changes in the past based on constructive criticism.  However, the length of the show is a bit near and dear to my heart.  
---
I'm more than aware that I'm scaring some listeners away that see the length of an episode and react with a laugh and a 'Fuck That!'.  And I don't begrudge them at all for not wanting to tune in to the show.  It's a lot to take in.
---
But, I guess at the end of the day I'm just making a podcast that I would enjoy if I were listening to it, and long form has been fine by me in the past if the topic is something I'm invested in.  It's also made up of 3-4 different segments that people may choose to pick from. So, imagine a one hour podcast with 2 hours worth of bonus material? :P
---
If the show isn't for you, then no hard feelings at all! Luckily there's plenty of options out there for all of us as we wait for Classic :)
---
Let me guess, you only played Vanilla on private server. Or, you made it to level 40 back in 2006
---
Yeah, they hearth but the human stays behind. He‚Äôs the only one who drops gear. 
---
&gt;  "Bro get me some more kung pao chicken while you rez" 
---
Lmfao alright this one tickled me \^\^ You are right man, I too miss the good old wholesome days without all the distractions of today. 
---
Good read. 
---
Having a standing desk that can go up or down has helped me a lot with this.
---
See you September 22nd
---
I'm fasting and now I really want to break if for kung pow chicken 
---
You should archive this post. Will be fun to look back at 1 week into launch. 
---
I feel you man. I try my best to buy organic where possible, specially when it comes to meat and eggs. Having worked in the greenhouse industry I know at least a little bit about how most organic farmers take the extra steps to lessen the burden we put on our surroundings. 
---
And you are right, its not that simple, in my naivety I initially thought cage automatically meant good conditions - this is not the case. In the end its about learning where your products come from and voting with your wallet so to speak, or at least that's what I attempt to do.  
---
Sadly they over used that model and killed it for me. Now the ZG two hand. There‚Äôs a sword. Even ashkandi. 
---
I think theres a few things going on there. But suffice to say the druids in my guild get gear faster than anyone else (mainly cause we only have 2). One thing is ret pallys want fury warr and rogue loot, which is the most contested by far. Druids gear slightly differently and have less crossover with the other melees who are in every single group. 
---
I dont see druids as bad healers. You are less incentivized to have a bunch of them but a good druid will still top meters(not that meters are the most important when healing). They arent there just for mark. Their single target healing is very strong and they bring innervate, thorns and battle res. They also bring sleep, decurse and depoison. Hibernate is irreplaceable in BWL. I think playing druid well is a bit harder than pally or priest and you see lots of bad druids. But I would always want at least 2 resto, three if taking a feral.
---
Like what? Are you legitimately trolling now? I literally just posted a thorough, elaborate explanation of the only changes between 1.11 and pre-1.11 as well as 1.12 as is written directly in the patch notes and you disregard it and quote me saying it's inaccurate? [https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch\_1.11.0](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.11.0) it's right there in the warrior section as well as the relevant articles concerning the changes in threat mechanics in 1.12.   
---
You're either a troll, in which I will stop responding to you, or a really misinformed moron who just can't accept that people got miles better at a game after playing it for over 7 years. Either way, I'm done with you since "debating" with you seems pointless if you have no actual evidence to back up any of your claims other than what "other people" say. 
---
It's an Altar of Storms
---
I love it when a nature spell hits like wrath, that crunch sound haha
---
Yes, I've never done the fights besides naxx in Wotlk. I plan on just listening to the RL for directions and reading up on super important fights. I got shit on for saying this stuff on a fight video posted a few weeks ago because I was advocating going in blind. Seriously?   
---
Why do people post boss videos 8-10 months ahead of time? Can they please put spoiler? Ive never stepped foot in molten core and can't wait to do it with my own two feet.
---
I'll be honest. I don't try to buy organic at all. While I respect the sort of people who care so deeply and sympathize with them, I'm far more pragmatic on the issue personally. We have to feed humanity, and sometimes that's not a pretty thing.
---
What is this abomination, quickly ret paladins cleanse this post!
---
Honestly, raids only want one thing from Paladins and it‚Äôs fucking disgusting
---
Fights even close to this scale won't happen if this subreddit's vocal majority gets the 2.5-4k population they want. 
---
We already know sharding shouldn't be used after launch. I see videos like this and [holding the mountain](https://youtu.be/UPnMFJiOxT4?t=13) more as reasons to have good populations. 
---
Glad someone else remembers 
---
Too bad any 2-Hander except Nightfall and Sulfuras is garbage.
---
That's cool too :) I think for me the major motivation to buy organic is to lessen the amount of byproducts that comes with the product and through that into myself and my wife, so I guess that could be viewed as selfish. 
---
Again its a nuanced picture, with many different opinions and agendas from all sides so in the end its up to the individual to decide whats the right path for them somehow. 
---
Whoa this became deep all of a sudden LOL. Apologies for that I sometimes drift off on one.  
---
Gah, that's something I anticipated but was unsure of. I'll probably alternate depending on the availability of Arcane Crystals then.
---
Most important thing for leveling paladin is getting a second monitor so you can watch porn
---
It's nice to have a deep conversation sometimes. :)

I was SO happy when got the Whirlwind Axe...omg, after killing 392848923498 elementals
---
Commenting for later :) ty!

Same. 
---
Weirdly enough im getting "tension headaches" if i stream with cam, but if i straem without a cam or just game i don't get it. I think maybe it's cause i try sit more straight up or something, but honestly not even sure.
---
Was that a fart between coughs because you pulled that straight out if your ass
---
I agree, and I wholeheartedly enjoyed it &lt;3 
---
Hells yeah, that's how I used to roll.
---
Was it fun? How about stamina while leveling? I'm not going to do it now because I like tanking too much sadly so I'll carry 2 sets like usual
---
time to open a PATREON OH YES GIVE ME THE MONEY OHHHHHHH
---
They‚Äôre starting areas really are the best. I leveled horde in vanilla but always had alliance alts. 
---
Wew, thought you were about to go over the top dramatic there, glad you pulled it in.
---
Oh, that‚Äôs nice!
---
You‚Äôre wasting 39 other players‚Äô time by not knowing what you‚Äôre doing and potentially wiping the raid because of it. 
---
&gt; Why do people post boss videos 8-10 months ahead of time?
---
Because they‚Äôre posting them when they upload it. 
---
&gt; Can they please put spoiler?
---
It‚Äôs not hard to not click on it. It‚Äôs not a spoiler. 
---
People act like having to go back to BRD etc. later in the game is going to be too confusing or unintuitive for the gamer moms &amp; pizza dads to handle. 
---
It's really not. 
---
What‚Äôs stage#2?
---
Lol the whole wasting 39 other people's time bullshit. If I can do a mythic raid I don't need "study" vanilla raid bosses. Clearly you didn't read the part where I said I will study the important fights if needed. God it is pointless defending people wanting to keep raids fresh who never experienced it
---
Omg, pls do a sulfuras? üòÄ
---
This pic is so cool, had a big drawing notebook with this pic
---

It pretty much was, for alliance tbh. Blood elves could ret pretty well.

Itll be fun until you wipe on Garr 10 times in a row

Josh, I LOVE the long podcasts. Seriously I can do a bit one day bit the other, or perfect for long car rides.
---
Keep up the good work 
---
Not sure if any of you guys are out there browsing these forums, but damn, do I miss you guys.  Hope all is well!
---
I'm sure you can figure it out, find a late night raiding guild or as you said roll US server.
---
I spent a good park of WoTLK doing the opposite of you - living in the US and raiding with an Aussie guild till like 4AM. Worked out great.
---
Trying to decide between gnome mage or undead mage. 
---
I was a hardcore raider in a couple of expansions but mostly focused on PVP.
---
I definitely want to raid in classic but will be pvping a ton aswell. 
---
just cant decide if i want WOF or 5% int from gnome...  
---
been leading towards gnome but i hear horde ie so much more HC in pvp in vanilla.  any suggestions?
---
Sorry man i already won this thread go home lol
---
I'm actually disappointed that the arrow isn't a sword.
---
Thanks for the wholesome read :p
---
&gt;  i already won this thread 
---
Imagine actually typing that.
---
I've had diarrhea with more substance than that idiotic fan theory based on a snapshot that was likely taken in July with a character named July. Why in the fuck would Blizzard hint to a release almost 9 months out when they barely even had 2 zones up and running at the time? Why do people actually believe this?
---
That makes sense! I'm probably slouching over my laptop too much.
---
How do you justify not buying sotc when the judgement increases the damage command/righteous does? You dont leave sotc on you judge it once then throw on something more useful.
---
I remember some ppl mentioned it before, and I'm sad I missed it, as weeks long AV are among my best memories about Vanilla.  
---
That said, I don't think I'd enjoyed it that much without everything on the outside : pexing, quests, world PvP, farming, raids.  
---
All that are meaningful activities "games in the game" tied to each others and make them all enjoyable.
---
Oh man that picture makes me want to log back in after not playing for a few months.. The wait for classic is killing me
---
Quality stuff right there. 
---
Yeah, I don't get it.  I've always winged raiding, and I've never "wasted 39 other players time" doing it.  I wanna see the content for myself, listen and coordinate with my RL and friends.  It's not like I want to raid hardcore...  Just wanna have fun and experience it for the first time.   
---
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **1st Cakeday** Stfuppercutoutlast! ^(hug)
---
Why would you limit it to 25 when you have slots for 40? 
---
Also, nothing can ever replace the epic feeling of raiding with 39 other people, regardless of how easy it is.
---
People also don't realize I enjoy a raid with honesty I can share with my RL. I'm going to be honest and tell them I don't plan on "studying" raids unless it's living bomb mechanic or something. If my RL demands me to watch videos for every boss, I will either tell him no or find another guild. It's like telling someone who plays DotA then need to go watch the pros play several kinds of hero classes before they touch the hero. Let me fucking experience my failures myself please. I can own up to my own shit
---
I'm sure some raids will be done with less than 40. AQ40 and Naxx, you want all hands on deck. 
---
Thank you !
---
Yes, but there wouldn't be any reason to unless you wanted the challenge.
---
Mages will always be wanted in dungeons and raids. Hunters will only be called to fill specific roles, like tranq and kiting fights. 
---
Hunter will have an easier time leveling, but mage isn't a bad choice either. Both are fun classes, but I think hunter is more fun to play in a lot of ways, simply because of some of things ridiculous, but fun things that the class can pull off, such as kiting world bosses.
---
Mages are more valuable to raids the longer the game goes on and scale a lot better. Mage raiding is pretty boring though, since you mainly spam one spell over and over, with very little modification to that. Hunters are still necessary, but if it weren't for tranq shot or a few other uses, raids would bring even fewer. Mages probably have an easier time getting 5-man groups as well since they have a great CC and can make water/food for the group. Hunters won't have any serious trouble finding groups though since they're still good and bring a lot of utility. 
---
Both classes can make pretty good gold. Hunters can solo dungeon bosses to make good money. Mages can AoE farm some dungeon packs in a similar way. Mages can make a little bit of side money selling food/water and portals, but it isn't anything too serious. 
---
I'd say that both are enjoyable to play for somewhat different reasons. 
---
So much nooby green gear. I love it. 
---
This is why people need to be so much less up tight about MC and entry-level raiding. You can get by with whatever and just have fun (within reason).
---
You sound like a loser to me.
---
4-5 hours go by so fast I hardly notice. I'm more concerned about drinking enough water throughout the day.
---
If i recall the bosses item amount on drops doesn't change wheter you have 40 or 10 people in your raid, so 2-3 items for 40 players seems a bit off to me that's why i was wondering if it was possible.
---
We can only pray that they'll release the original AV. Unless I'm missing something here
---
I‚Äôm not at my desktop right now but other folks have done the math and even *if* you get a full 30s duration on JotC (pretty much only on dungeon bosses) it‚Äôs extra damage buff is lackluster compared to blasting a mob 8 yds away with JoR before switching to SoC and wailing for 10s. 
---
There is some super hardcore Seal juggling you could sometimes get away with on tanky mobs, but with the amount of GCD downtime and the fact that mobs just don‚Äôt last long enough for JotC to really flex, it‚Äôs a bit of a wash. 
---
Also, remember that you have to cast it over and over on each mob. This means the DPS-per-mana while leveling against regular mobs just isn‚Äôt worth. 
---
That kind of pushing a narrative is not surprising, especially for low-traffic niche news sites that need the eyeballs for the ad revenue to stay afloat.
---
They added a whole lot to the game. Increasing the rivalry, influencing gameplay in both pvp and pve. They were also a source of identity to the factions, being a sort of hero class exclusive to each faction. As far as lore goes, that is an integral part of the whole experience of the game that means a lot to me. I'd rather have unbalanced gameplay as a result of the storyline, than have the lore be sidelined in favor of balancing. 
---
gear  
---
Well, I guess I mean for progression raids. Obviously for Onyxia and MC after farm status, dropping raiders for that purpose makes sense.
---
I really like [this smite spec](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bVMhsZchtccrVxx) for healing and farming.  It's got enough points in the holy tree that you can heal anything.  Take 5/5 spirit tap, so you will never go oom while farming.  Spirit tap with spiritual guidance has nice synergy too, so you will have some huge holy fire damage.  You just need farming set that maximizes spell damage and spirit.
---
Creating faction identity and a real difference in gameplay made the game better. Having solid lore made the game better. 
---
Stretching the lore to make money made the game shittier. Belf paladins never really made sense the way they made them. They're kind of evil which is the antithesis of what a paladin is.
---
Yeah, that racial interrupt made pvp as ret fun
---
Thank you!
---
From an individual perspective, being in a raid with less people might give you better chances, but from a team perspective, gear is gear. There's no difference if one warlock gets an item over another. Yes, you can do MC and Ony with less than 40 people (my guild started going into MC with 29 people, and we downed rag with 36 (side note, if you're a "meme spec" player like ret paladin elemental etc, this is the best time to join a guild. they'll take anyone to fill up the raid and if you're loyal you'll have a good case for sticking along once they progress further)) but that's probably not going to fly in BWL and definitely not in AQ.
---
It's okay baby, I brought Blessing of Protection!
---
are you the gnome?
---
This is very true. And honestly, I'm not sure if all the Ret hate was just left over from vanilla, OR if there numbers were actually bad. Because from what I saw, they did fine. Granted, that's from a sample size of one.
---
Blood Elves to Horde (instead of ally) was pretty lame lore-wise. But It was an easy way to give horde Paladins (and a 'cute' race). So it made sense. 
---
Draenei were basically a lore blackhole, but Alliance needed shaman.
---
In the end, I think it made sense to give both factions all classes -- WoW was insanely popular and balance for top-end guilds started to matter a whole lot more. PvP balance as well.
---
Nah.  I'm the human with the red hair and oven mitts on - Bleu.
---
Where'd you get the Sulfuron Ingots and Lava/Fiery cores?
---
Bless you!
---
It is. People who played in vanilla weren‚Äôt really understanding of how it played and itemization. You can hit the 3-5 spots in BWL with BWL gear as long as you know how to play. And in PvP 21/0/30 is actually really strong for premades

40 raiders = more utility, more safeguards, faster kills, faster raids.
---
Imagine being a main tank and paying those repair bills because only 28 people showed up to the raid.
---
Over the years horde and alliance have become way to alike. This helped drawn that line in the sand and make an even bigger distinction between the two factions. I know when I played Paladin and would encounter an undead in world PvP it always felt really cool.  Seeing a shaman as an alliance player was always cool too. Having the factions be so different from each other really gave each side more faction identity. 
---
This could be a cash cow, my mind would be blown if they allow performance issues unless the entire server is in one zone via AQ release.  Its 100% possible, private servers don't have an issue with large scale battles as bad as retail with sharding.  It'll be a completely different game plan from the get go compared to instanced sharding
---
Pretty much this. Though I will say that nobody really cares about one class over another in 5-man groups, if you know how to play your class, you shouldn‚Äôt have any trouble finding groups.
---
I'm going 1/29/21 Druid, it's a very versatile build. I plan to offtank/DPS feral in raids when possible and heal when not.
---
When I played a mage I used to get tells the moment I logged in for dungeon groups.  People loved my CC, damage, utility and water.  As a hunter, I generally had to make my own groups or face getting a group with a second hunter to compete with on loot drops.  Using hunter CC in dungeons is frustrating since if it gets resisted or breaks you're pretty much SOL until pretty late into leveling.
---
However, I did very little dungeon running with my hunter.  When I hit 60, I picked up the AV crossbow and up a few blue crafted items, walked into the MC and was #3 on the damage meters(pretty new MC running guild).  Walked out with 4-5 epics.
---
I found mage leveling a bit frustrating.  When I leveled there was no +damage gear, so it was a bit slow.  I also discovered that trying to kill higher level mobs is quite hard for a mage due to the very large number of resists they get. Sticking with yellow and green quests is bests.   Rogues killed me a lot while leveling.  Trying to solo elites wasn't happening as a mage due to resists.
---
Hunter leveling was pure joy.  My leveling spec was also and overpower PvP spec, I could kill mobs 5-6 levels above me, I could solo kite elite mobs to death (I kited all the elite hunter mobs in STV), and FD is the biggest run back saver in history.  Oh, and I ate rogues for breakfast.  Ganking me generally required 5+ levels or 2+ people and even with 2+ people I generally won more than I lost.
---
Players will like you a lot more as a mage than as a hunter.  Even if you're the world's greatest hunter, you'll be forever stained by a large number of huntaids that play the class.  I only really got respect for the class when I dominated the damage meters in raids or was pulling dungeons in speed runs. I also did some outstanding kiting in BWL.  Otherwise, the things you do are just a lot less noticeable than what mages do.
---
I can't really speak to that, but I remember SoB making for a pretty good time in PvE.
---
I'm not saying you're wrong, I have no clue. But when I go on youtube, and watch videos by people on pservers  (like Tips Out) all of them say ret is bottom barrel!
---
I'd bet good money that when the cam is on you're putting a bit more pressure on yourself whether you notice it or not, and maybe that's getting you a little more hyped and therefore a little more uncomfortable. 
---
Not to get too "new age"-y but I think if you keep tension inside you without relaxing, your body will react.  Every time I start to get headaches I just dial it down a few notches, drink water, and take a break from screen time and it works like a charm.  But that's just me- but I'd encourage you to try and pursue whatever might be wrong.  If you have a headache it's your body's way of saying "something is wrong" so you should listen. 
---
I play a lot on the only relevant "instant 60" private server and most paladins go reck/ret so people definitely know about reckoning in general!  Holy/reck is different but perhaps an even better spec for BGs because you still have great damage potential and heals are WAY better.  Ultra support class
---
Yes, it's possible. I remember clearing MC with 28 people in vanilla. However, a group of ~30 with pre-raid bis would struggle unless everyone was fully buffed with flasks. It's definitely possible once you gear up a bit.
---
I'm not a huge lore buffs so I can't speak to the blood elves, however I do feel like their presentation waa done well. Vampires are after all very pretty, but still very much a monster (at least in modern tropes). Though, how much lore they needed to rewrite to get them there I have no idea! I agree that blood elf paladins do feel weird.
---
I feel like it would have been best to give paladins/shamans abilities to shore up the desparity between the two. I agree with one of the other posters about them feeling like faction hero classes, but I do understand the fustration of feeling like content is restricted due to something out of your control.
---
This is of course with out making the two classes red/blue copies of each other. 
---
We appreciate your feedback on this matter! In order to help reduce costs for our GMs we have automatically blocked player communications from being visible for you. Have a wonderful day. Activ-Blizz.
---
I cant wait for the salty pms whining that I‚Äôm reserving sellables in runs I tank. Yummy tears mmmmmm
---
I‚Äôve played both classes on various servers. Sorry if this is wordy....
---
Both classes perform extremely well in pvp, in open world pvp, group bgs and dueling. They both share a lot of utillity and have a high skill ceiling. Both classes can decimate opposing teams in bgs if they‚Äôre allowed to sit back and free cast. Mages possess a larger amount of CC ability when they‚Äôre focused in group combat, they can ice block, frost nova, slow, shield and blink away (or just spam arcane explosion and take everyone down with you)... alternatively, if the hunter is focused by a group it relies on pre set traps or outside help, they also can‚Äôt dps because of their deadzone. If enemies can close the range, mages obviously have a better time. As always... engineering help immensely with both classes.
---
I can‚Äôt speak to hunter PvE as I quit the server not long after dinging 60. However, the rotation is simple... but hard to master. I live in Australia and latency plays havoc in perfecting your shot timing. When I raided as other classes however, hunters roles seemed to consist of traps, kiting and tranq Shotting. Hunters aren‚Äôt renowned for great dps... BUT...Regardless of how well the average hunter performs, if you can achieve great numbers respective to your class, and because hunters are required to perform specific roles, you will be a benefit to you raid. 
---
I spent a lot of my time on Nost as a mage... While it is true that mages rotation consist primarily of frostbolt spam to achieve solid numbers.... there is a great deal more to set you above other mages. Knowing when to utilise AOE, slows, perfecting your placement, cooldowns, trinkets, raid movement, professions... all count in the race for top dps. ‚ÄòHey, can I get some water?‚Äô Gets old very quickly.
---
Both classes have great gold farming potential, I‚Äôd go as far as to say they‚Äôre probably the 2 best solo farmers in the game. 
---
Hunters are second to none while leveling. Fastest and easiest. 
---
Mages on the other hand can be crazy fast levellers via AOE. The gnolls in north redridge, the rotting orchard in Duskwood, Go‚Äôsheks farm, Pirates cove.... you can farm your way to 60 lightning fast. However! You aren‚Äôt alone in the world and it doesn‚Äôt even take competing mages or the opposing faction to halt your AoE. A single innocent friendly warrior, grinding mobs one by one, spending 2 minutes to kill a single mob, is all it takes. You‚Äôll pull the entire population, only to have a single mob spawn mid pull and daze you... aoeing can be the most frustratingly rewarding path to 60. It won‚Äôt be a viable method for quite a while because of the population at launch.
---
On the other side of the same coin, quest/grinding your way to 60 as a mage can be very slow. You will spend a great deal of time drinking, as opposed to hunters that have next to no down time. Mages do however, have a great quality of life in their movement... blinking across the map adds up over great distances, and every other class will be jealous of your ports. 
---
Mages are always welcomed in dungeon groups, they bring buffs, water, cc and AoE. Hunters on the otherhand, somewhat carry an old stigma of being sub-par players... while I never bought into the idea (never had a huntard roll need on my weapon). I can kind of see how their abilities leave themselves open to problems.... their traps can break and can‚Äôt be reapplied in combat, their pets pathing can wipe groups (often leaving the FD hunter alive, to add insult to injury), accidentally leaving pet taunt on, their best rotation can break cc, they can be rendered useless without ammunition, people get dazed if they leave aspect on. This isn‚Äôt to say theyre the only class with issues.... but they possess a lot of ways to be accidentally labelled as bad. 
---
One example for mages... mages that stand with healers, pull threat and frost nova.... you are the huntards of the Mage‚Äôing world!
---
Apparently my comment was removed because this sub is stupid with some rules. Check out Drakova or Esfand (he‚Äôs great). The issue with private servers is the scripting is generally trash, doubly so for Ret, so honestly if they weren‚Äôt on the two or three well scripted ones it‚Äôs likely true that Ret was bottom there. My paladins on other realms often did 20% less overall damage then my pallies on the few good ones. 
---
As a guild that was competing for server firsts, the way we fought Ragnaros, Vael, Razorgore, and Nefarian (and probably a couple other fights) seems incredibly stupid with hindsight.
---
It took us way too long to really understand the mechanics of some of those fights. 
---
What kind of info does it have in it?
---
And WATCH THE FUCKING TAIL
---
MANY WHELPS. LEFT SIDE. HANDLE IT!
---
Different from TBC?
---
TBC is a smooth continuation of the design decisions started in Vanilla. It just appears from the outside to be punctuated. 
---
How should I express this?
---
So, patches *feel* like individual monolithic design boxes‚Äîbut that‚Äôs an illusion. For example, the Shaman and Paladin revamps that were supposed to be implemented in Vanilla got pushed back to TBC for scheduling and production reasons.
---
Similarly, many of the things developed for Vanilla had to be pushed back (Karazhan anyone?) and slated for a major patch at some point in the future. 
---
There‚Äôs a continuous line of design and development behind the scenes that becomes distorted into this punctuated patch paradigm from the outside. But that‚Äôs not actually how development works. 
---
So this idea that you can snip 1.12 and then throw out all the work that was being done behind the scenes and somehow expect something better for a ‚Äúnew‚Äù 2.0 seems like a pipe dream to me. 
---
Honestly Jaina's story is justifiable. I always looked at her like Upham from Saving Private Ryan. He tries to not kill and lets that German prisoner go only for it to bite him in the ass later on, making him pick up a gun and finally kill him at the end of the movie. Jaina let the Horde be free, only for Theramore to be in ruins.
---
The whole "doomguard" aspect is off, its not a pet it's a gimmick, the appropriate uses of both dg and inf are slim to non
---
Thanks man. 
---
It's fun with friends. Not just about gear. But also if you raid with only 20-30 people getting geared up you will hit a dead end when you go up against a dps check in aq or naxx. There should be plenty of time between teirs to sufficiently gear up a raid of 40 + alternates
---
Progression is when you most need the gold though
---
Group swapping mid fight for Mana Tide is an option, though
---
Releases at the perfect time. I'm graduating from College in May and will have plenty of free time outside of work to play :D
---
If you tank often enough why not take holy shield instead of the crit cooldown
---
I have 3 monitors.  And multiple computers.
---
One task at a time. When I played I never sat down thinking I'm going to play for 8 hours, but one thing leads to another and before you know it the day is gone. I'm also incredibly obsessive. Long grinds typically have no effect on my morale. I'm not sure exactly why, but I seem to be hardwired to enjoy watching small incremental increases eventually add up to something tangible.
---
Taladriel and She'd have some very well known guides, known for tanking and cat respectively
---
Was this on frostmane?
---
I'm actually a fan of how blood elves were handled. They're a race which so heavily identifies with their victimization that they came up with a new name for themselves to remind themselves of everyone they lost. Their pride in this identity is derived from spite and a drive for vengeance (we will endure, we will destroy anyone who will oppose us, you hear these lines constantly just clicking on npcs), and while they hold their homeland dearly, you see in the starting zone that they've been forced to cannibalize their history (siphoning magic from the mana wryms, putting down the treants and lynxs, wretched turning academies into the mana equivilent of drug dens, etc.) Calling them "cute" and leaving it at that kind of ignores how zealous and ugly they are, as people. There's a lot going on.
---
As for them joining the horde - I think this was primarily championed both by sylvanas (who both reached out to the blood elves and used her influence to vouch for them among the other leaders) and the leaders of silvermoon who saw it as a necessity to reach outland. The obvious conflict between the blood elves and the forsaken and horde is actually pointed out in the game itself. You see in the bizzarre two elves protesting in front of a crowd, pointing out that it was the horde who invaded them in the second war and how sylvanas is a shadow of her former self. Eventually, an agent of the magistrate is summoned in and mind controls them to repeat slogans of serving their glorious prince Kael and destroying their enemies. I think people also underestimate the effect of a national humiliation - the fact that it was the alliance which had them imprisoned was enough to, in the right moment and with some manipulation on part of their leaders, drive them into the arms of the horde. 
---
The blood knights aren't true paladins, at least until the final patch of TBC. In the class quests the trainers will point out that they can't naturally tap into the light and they instead have to draw their power from the Naaru. Their epic mount quest involves them burning down the church in strathholme and slaughtering a bunch of paladins basically out of spite, and the warcharger they give you is basically just a normal horse, not the redeemed spirit of a horse formerly used by a death knight like the alliance get.
---
I'm not seeing how that's an unpopular opinion. We want classic. If people want change and further progression, retail is there for them. 
---
Ahh, I miss the days when Warriors thought Arms was good for DPS.
---
My unpopular opinion is specifically that Classic is going to be niche. 
---
I say it because I‚Äôve seen some pretty wacky claims on this sub recently that Classic is going to get WotLK numbers and sink retail and cure cancer, lol. 
---
To shreds you say...
---
Can you make this a tattoo black and white
---
Thanks!
---
This is fantastic.
---
I want to be an effective and resilient healer, and I'm willing to suffer during the climb to 60 in order to achieve that goal.  I want to thrive in dungeons and in PvP.
---
[https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxurxstxMt0x]
---
At the moment, that's my plan.
---
Does Blessing of Kings always trump the others?  That assumption prompted me to forego Improved Blessing of Wisdom.  The extra Stamina seems vital for PvP.
---
I may move points from Anticipation to Improved Concentration Aura.  How often will it come into play?  It's necessary to take Improved Devotion Aura in order to reach the next level of the Protection tree, so I feel obligated to make use of it.  In addition, Devotion guarantees additional armor, while Concentration offers only a chance to ignore interruption.
---
With all of that said, Pursuit of Justice is very tempting.
---
More like the serial /spitter will see this in their email:
---
"You have received a large amount of reports from your fellow players and have been squelched."
---
&gt; I'd rather have unbalanced gameplay as a result of the storyline, than have the lore be sidelined in favor of balancing. 
---
Thank you. This 100%. Same goes for creativity and RPGness &gt; balancing.
---
Does Blessing of Kings always trump the others?  That assumption prompted me to forego Improved Blessing of Wisdom.
---
The fact that private servers run by Russians in their mothers' basements runs better than BfA should be a big red flag having people question the future state of Classic.
---
Blizzard has been researching, practicing, applying matchmaking systems for years, which are present in at least Overwatch and HotS and retail WoW. It's a pretty tough thing to do and that's why gamers still complain about matchmaking (but when do gamers ever stop complaining when it comes to PvP competition). It'll be easier done in Classic than those other games because there's not even a rating system to perform calculations on. Here's a lecture if you're interested https://youtu.be/-pglxege-gU
---
Holy warrior...dressed in all cloth.
---
I love doing dungeons so I've never had bad gear from 20 - 60, but untill then or if you are planning on speed levling you will be very weak. You kinda have to and should use hamstring kiting while killing mobs. Wpvp on the other hand, if you get to open with charge + hamstring then you might win, if not most classes will kite you down. Atleast untill you learn intercept. 
---
Go make a Vanilla WoW Diablo 2 clone
---
&gt; Like what? Are you legitimately trolling now? I literally just posted a thorough, elaborate explanation of the only changes between 1.11 and pre-1.11 as well as 1.12 as is written directly in the patch notes
---
This is like someone insisting that they have a bunch of equations proving 1=2 and that unless you check their homework for them and find their error you aren't allowed to disagree with them.
---
I'm not checking your homework for you, I'm telling you that there appears to be a strong consensus from people who played at the time that 1.11 was the point where tank threat got so over the top that the best DPS class became one with no threat mitigation just raw damage. If your attempt at theorycrafting gets a different result that probably means your theorycrafting is wrong.
---
&gt; You're either a troll, in which I will stop responding to you, or a really misinformed moron who just can't accept that people got miles better at a game after playing it for over 7 years.
---
Well, a game based on an attempt to emulate the original game with a lot of guesswork and mistakes and unavoidable major inaccuracies.
---
I'm not taking it as proof either, but to your points... Blizzard can gain internet points if they do release it on July 16th by pointing out how they leaked the date months ago. Plus, they lose nothing if they miss the release date, since it wasn't official. Win-win. People believe it because the theory makes sense, and they already stated summer 2019. July 16th is in the summer, so I'm not sure why the 9 months out point is valid. Summer release was official.
---
The tension created when Shamans and Paladins cross paths in the open world is not to be underrated.
---
Class antagonism blended with faction pride instantly switches on, and often leads to intense fights where both parts go all in fully focused. This is unique to vanilla.
---
I'm looking forward to these encounters once again.
---
&gt; I think theres a few things going on there. But suffice to say the druids in my guild get gear faster than anyone else (mainly cause we only have 2).
---
Did I not just say "you want one or two around for paw buff and that's it"? You have two.
---
I can see that in raids given there are so few of them they'd gear up fast. But despite that nobody in the pirate server community seems to be saying "you'd be crazy not to stack more druids, they gear up fast!".
---
I'm not sure what point you think I am making, that you seem to be arguing against. Nobody says you want zero druids in a raid, or that druids are useless. Just that you only want one or two because that's enough to get the thorns/brez/paw benefits and once you have those benefits any further druids in the raid are a bad use of a slot.
---
If you scroll up, I was not saying druids sucked, only that mages and rogues are still worth playing in a world where druids suck a bit less.
---
Thanks man, I'll check them out. Maybe I'll give pally another try. It is my favorite class! And it's totally possible that I just wasn't doing it right last time. I mean, back then everyone sucked. Plus, from what I remember Pallys were still fine for tanking 5-mans.
---
Hi all, actiblizzion here. Today we are shutting down our automated squelching report system to further cut costs. This is a company not a charity and we want to spend as little as possible while we rake in the millions. Thank you for your understanding. You can enable reports and squelching by purchasing the bundle in our app store. (Must purchase app to be able to use app store).
---
However it's a blizzlike solution however u look at it. I rather phase first levels than having every Q item shared or whatever pserver thing u wrote 
---
I leveled with a friend who tanked all the mobs while I supported him, I had REALLY low health, not gonna lie, when he had around 6k I had around 3k, I was extremely squishy but hit like a truck and healed like a truck, it was a ton of fun, as a paladin if I ripped threat or had mobs on me I could bubble/bop myself and normally live, I was able to heal my friend, myself, and doing DPS without ever going oom because I had so much int, it was awesome, if you level with a friend I HIGHLY recommend Gorilla gear as a paladin, it's awesome, easily the most fun I've had in WoW in a long time haha
---
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **7th Cakeday** Undoer! ^(hug)
---
Yeah its a give and take I guess.  Divine favor is pretty nice to have guaranteed holy lights are pretty cool
---
That's not a bad idea. Also, some classes are rare to find someone good with, so it might be a good idea to rewatch those fights.
---
I beat most druids I fought as a hunter, but every now and then would get jumped by an extremely good feral and lose. Took me a while to finally match him (fucker was good at getting away), because he was the only really good feral. Would have been nice to have video 
---
As an archer and a bowyer i can assure you this is no more ridiculous than 99% of the bows in wow. It is staggering how incredibly bad the archery is in WoW. 
---
Regarding your weapon list: What for 51-58 and what for 60 if Alterac Valley is not in the game yet, and/or I simply don't do AV?
---
I'll give it a look, I doubt it's super applicable to classic wow but it sounds interesting regardless! Thanks :)
---
It won't be, the case you mentioned is much easier, just wanted to point out they already do more advanced stuff so I'm sure they're technically capable of it already. I'm a data nerd though so this video is interesting regardless
---
Hmmmm, where do you see that?
---
Spec in this game matters less than gear. If you have an off-set of a gear that has spell dmg or whatever you need, then you'll be fine. Worry less about spec, but take some points into account like grabbing Spirit Tap for a Priest, for example.
---
But yeah, gear is really the only limiting factor. Worry less about spec.
---
For 51-58, if you can‚Äôt get the spear then learn to love your Lightforged Blade. 
---
At 60 the BiS weapon for Retribution Paladins is either Blackhand Doomsaw from UBRS or Arcanite Reaper if you can‚Äôt get Unstoppable Force. 
---
That‚Äôs as confident as I am talking about lvl-60 Retribution though, because I personally respec to full Holy. 
---
I think you and people in this thread are missing the boat. There are good spec ideas but the real important part of this is gear. You can be full spec Resto druid with every, single point in the Resto tree, but if you have a full set of +Spell Damage blues from 5 man's, you'll be set to farm. Gear is always more impactful than spec.
---
Take the advice you find in here for spec, but just know that the items is what makes it work more than some precise allocation of talents.
---
That mage on the left is definitely wielding a Perdition‚Äôs Blade
---
Ginger men? Or ginger women? Or ginger bread?
---
[This is finally relevant again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1t0A1cqGcw), but yes, rogues were widely agreed to be OP in classic, in PVE as dps, and PVP because of the everything.
---
Our first kill on cthun was 39 back in the day. So something something sometimes also.
---
But for mc pretty sure it was 20 people playing and 20 people with they dick out
---
Meming, at this point in content perds blade is rotting 
---
In premade pvp Shaman is arguably the strongest class in the game come AQ40. 
---
Early server WSG premade vs premade the paladin is king. But elemental in AB ( main competitive bg ) and later in WSG is the scariest thing you'll face.
---
The world will be a living squirming mat of rogues, but that also makes it more appealing to be a rogue.
---
People who know what they're doing and are well-geared could clear Molten Core with 25ish people, but it's making things unnecessarily challenging. And that's the only raid you can get away with that few of people below the cap.
---
The real answer is that while people have min/max the game to kingdom come, that many encounters still need at least close to 40 people, especially in the higher tiers.
---
Back in the day, there was always a lot of trash talk and balance complaints of people because for many players, their only experience, of a shaman as an Alliance player was fighting them in PvP, so their knowledge may have been limited and players of one faction always thought that the unique class of the other side was busted OP.
---
It was kinda cool for flavor I guess. But I think Blizzard eventually got rid of the difference for fear that raid mechanics would eventually start clearly favoring having one of the unique classes over the other.
---
Awesome work OP.  Simply awesome 
---
Both classes are fun in pvp, and both can be extremely annoying. They can perform a lot of similar roles
---
- polymorph is better than freezing trap for single person cc. Along with frost nova and slows it is like you can freezing trap (only better) and frost trap with entrapment at the same time. Hunters are still great at cc in pvp, though
---
- both are great at disrupting healers. Hunter pet with fast attack speed along with intimidate and/or scatter is nice. If close enough, can also fd/trap. I think mage has a slight advantage. Though, since healers generally have talents to cancel out a lot of the disruption from pets, where as counterspell gives you a window to burst people down
---
- damage depends on how fresh of a 60 you are. A fresh 60 bm hunter will destroy most including a fresh 60 mage. Mage scales better, though, and gains an edge after bwl. Hunters will always be great against clothies, though.
---
- I feel like hunters can do a bit more as support. Flares to keep healers from getting jumped. Tracking to help find flag carriers or call out incoming. In a direct fight I would pick a mage, but I would always want at least 1 hunter in any bg group.
---
- I felt like hunter was more involved, thus more fun. And at high end pvp there is very little margin for error. Hell, just kiting in world pvp is hard as fuck sometimes. Hunters mark enemy. Pay attention while cheetah is on so he doesn't shoot you or nade you. Track beast to avoid mobs, change it depending on where you go. Now he's running away, wait he was just trying to lure me in. Fuck, I aggrod something and now I'm dazed. Scatter/trap person on me, put pet on the mob, now back to max range. Shit gets intense
---
Betrayer of humanity! 
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; ‚Ä¢ Microtransactions can suck but are one way a company can increase revenues without increasing subscription costs. A company like Netflix is pretty much stuck having to increase their sub price (like they just did).
---
This is true but WoW's subscription is kinda insane when you think it about it. In the beginning it was seen as necessary to support the infrastructure and in return players got regular content updates. 
---
Legit no one else can get away with that model anymore. The rest of the industry has moved to microtransactions because they're *free to play* games. I'm not sure the WoW sub still justifies its value proposition.
---
Peronslly, I don't care what happens to the casuals. Clearly if the game was working for "casuals" the sub number wouldn't be dropping. Why change what we know works. People don't want sharding, they don't want cross realm, they want their plain jane vanilla back. Nothing more nothing less.
---
Genuinely curious: will this happen when Classic comes out? I know there are serious chokepoints in AV but will games really last all day? How often will it happen? I imagine a fair amount taking a couple hours but how often will we see games that last overnight?
---
eh, again, i'm not really fighting the fury vs arms thing here, i'm stating that you shouldn't get the 5/5 cruelty then go into arms if u are sub 40 and have chosen to go arms, as it is better to get to the next level talents quicker than to get the crit.
---
Can't really argue that, I still had a great time in battle groups and recognized people from different realms. Yeah you couldn't meet in world but still got to know people and have fun in a PVP state. I think it will become the case if some of the realms die down after a year or 2 of classic
---
Ahh, that's what you were getting at, now I understand you :)
---
Not being able to multi shot is gd torture. 
---
I do think a good hunter will out cc a good mage in dungeons, though. You can fd/trap to reapply, and your pet can offtank an elite for a bit. Especially if you are beastmaster. I was always survival, also, and those trap talents are really good in dungeons.
---
Is it just me or is that people that want to play warriors are very, very concerned about minute details about leveling and being strong and min/max everything?
---
Like I can't see a single other class being this obsessive about this kind of thing. 
---
Plus, the real thing about vanilla is that gear matters more than spec. If you have a decent set of tank gear, you'll be fine.
---
in vanilla they do a spin, during eviscerate anyways
---
thing is people still use cookie cutter specs in retail, especially in PvE.
---
maybe you swap out an ability here and there for a different boss, but how is that interesting? that's not "defining" your character's specialization, it's literally just following a guide to do a boss.
---
The Instance is good
---
I have severe autism, so it's more like I have to motivate myself to not play for 12 hours at a time.
---
The biggest gamechanger for me was learning how to move well and assigning sufficiently fast/comfortable keybindings for my left hand. Unbinding back pedal, circle strafing, jumping, and having my hand on the mouse 100% of the time...that kind of thing.
---
Also learning how to position myself in a fight and set up easy routes to "begin a kite." Example, you run up to an ongoing skirmish. Dont just drop off your mount asap, take a second to get next to some LOS. If they switch to you, dip behind LOS and you are gone. This is an obvious example, but recognizing the opportunity in the environment is a big skill itself.
---
Min/maxing your gear, spec, etc. is great but mostly you just gotta "get good"
---
watching GoT is never a waste of time
---
This guy gets it.
---
Also agree. That's why they have the job... usually..
---
Yes, always. After we get geared my raids sell loot/runs to players. We could take 5-10 extras without issue.
---
1.12.1 patch you can do MC in greens and a few mara/dm blues. You dont need 40 prebis players to farm it.
---
Well, how is his wife holding up?
---
There was a post about it a day or two ago and it was very convincing. 
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs rough in the beginning because their is very little true ret gear early on. 
---
Kek I won't miss the "international"(chinese) """""community"""" at all.
---
I'd love some no lifer, EST living, PvP oriented, Shaman playing, microphone having, discord using PAL to play WOW with, lmk! can post previous exp, I play war/rog with friends that play ... other classes ... looking to incorporate a SHAMAN into my lifeeeee, blessed be windfury totem, in 1 extra attack we trust, amen.
---
Yes, in war, loss happens, but not in Warcraft, apparently. Azeroth (and Draenor) have been in a perpetual state of war for the past 30 years. Yet somehow both factions still have the resources and manpower to clash against each other again and again. If the world and its writers knew the concept of consequences, there should be noone left to fight anymore. All the Alliance vs. Horde conflicts since and including Cataclysm make zero zense.
---
Thinking about it, the world in vanilla and BC seemed a lot more war-weary than it is now. 
---
&gt; However, do you think that this added something beneficial to the game?
---
Sure. Faction asymmetry if great if the game remains balanced, and the fact that nobody you could talk to played the enemy faction's class meant they were a lot more alien than the classes you were used to running dungeons with. When I was a new Horde player I had no real idea what paladins could and could not do even when I had a good handle on every other class.
---
&gt; Do you feel the game was better off in BC when both factions had access to the classes?
---
On balance, yes.
---
Keeping shamans and paladins balanced was impossible, Blizzard could barely balance the classes that both factions had. And when you did get a decent balance the next patch to either class would mess it up again.
---
Also, fundamentally, totems suck in PvP compared to blessings and there's no way to fix it without making totems overpowered in PvE. But blessings were just better anyway which is why (along with Fear Ward) Alliance is just better for PvE in vanilla as well as better for group PvP.
---
Cutting the Gordian knot and giving both sides both classes was the only lasting solution. I think it was a bit hacky making Dranaei shamans, I think it would have made more lore sense to give that to Dwarves, but you have to sell xpacs somehow so making the new class exclusive to the new race made business sense.
---
Blood Elves are awesome and their lore makes perfect sense. Fight me.
---
The best scenario is a rogue throwing together a strat run for the headband or DME for the bow and has every party member but the tank assembled but wants to reserve the item.  Simply join the party, tell them to PM you for an invite leave and snipe their other dps/heals.
---
You are right. But still the question is worthless because no one have a chance to give a usable answer. You know, like trying to explain what a woman is thinking.
---
Lit
---
on the left side of the screen it says "reactivate" 
---
In short:
---
1) You don't gain any EXP in Battlegrounds, that's a WotLK implemented feature.
---
2) This has nothing to do with "tokens", as you can say by the name of such items, that's a reputation reward for playing. The ones you linked is Arathi.
---
3) Yes they are, Cross-BG was a thing at the end of Vanilla.
---
Did you play Frozen Throne? Having BE in Alliance would make even less sense. If they didn't go Horde then they would either be a neutral rep faction or hostile mobs.
---
Alterac yeeeeeeeeeees.
---
Sadly I doubt they use the original alterac. But the endless battles would be hilarious for Christmas. 
---
We can't infer much from that graph in terms of accuracy. We don't know the methodology, nor confidence intervals etc. From a statistics standpoint, what makes it accurate to you? To me, this looks like a simple nonlinear regression which a) becomes less accurate the further the predictions are away from the last known datapoint, and b) author has no loss function to test estimated variable from true variable for those that are known. 
---
Speak for yourself, foobar for life my dude.
---
No changes.
---
Every miss with a 3.00+ second weapon makes you more of a man
---
ultimately it comes to no changes, but hey don't let me stop you from brainlessly repeating memes.
---
except it doesn't, its literally just an arbitrary oversight that puts especially warriors/paladins at a incredible leveling disadvantage for no reason.  I don't want to change the end game at all hence the decay part of my idea, is it possible to have a discussion about this or is it just always the Pavlovian response of "no changes"?
---
My guess has been late August/September so you might be screwed.
---
Wtf is going on in this pic lol. The feral Druid is auto attacking the warrior out of form. Theres another Druid in lvl 1 gear. And a gnome lock channeling his aoe on top of that one Druid. 
---
/Welcome followed by /doom whenever I duel someone in a bg/wpvp
---
Cheers. Will do.
---
Also, paladins and warriors have the fastest 1-10 for experienced players, along with shamans. Hit is not their problem, the lack of good weapon quest rewards is. As seen by warriors being awesome when they first get whirlwind axe, until it starts getting crap in the late 40s.
---
Also the danger of dying is one of the things that makes classic levelling engaging.
---
Adding a passive hit% doesn't make it any less dangerous just less tedious, start it at lvl 10 if that's really your hang up on the idea, at the end of the day you won't be able to just face tank mobs just because they add a 2.5% hit chance at lvl 10 or whatever, you'll still have to hamstring&gt;rend&gt;strafe&gt;repeat.  Can we stop conflating tedium with difficulty please?
---
It‚Äôs not though. They already plan to start sharded servers then revert them to unsharded. So 1/3 servers start as they already plan to do, and 1/3 have dynamic respawns, and 1/3rd have ‚Äúno changes‚Äù launch experiences.
---
WoW is a MMO, warcraft 3 is a RTS game. They're completely different types of games set in the same universe.
---
Yeah, that's why the old system was interesting. Allowing you to make choices allows you to make *mistakes.*
---
Following a guide where someone figured out all of the details for you takes all the fun out of it.
---
And as I said, sometimes they got the details wrong too.
---
Do you do some sort of sport or do you not drink enough?
---
The headaches might not be related to sitting at a computer for too long. 
---
Do you play on a laptop?
---
Usually I take breaks, whenever I want, because I'm not 20 anymore. But your symptoms sound alarming. 
---
No, its not a grahpical update, it will hopefully be an exact replica of the 2004 version aka vanilla.
---
that hunter is pure vanilla flavored hunter.
---
Same here I'm done with school in april and have half a year free time then.
---
Cant help too think about the magneto meme, i said the real Obsidian edged blade. Not this crap.
---
Awesome!
---
Ah dude! I was going to post this a few weeks ago but totally spaced on it.
---
But... it does make it more difficult? If adding hit % makes it easier, the opposite is true. And if something is tedious it's *by nature* more difficult- and that's not to say it's the best manner to make things difficult. I don't see a reason to add hit % other than to make it easier to level, and there are plenty of other things that can be done for that. Warriors / paladins grouping make a big difference for a lot of classes-  mage / priest / rogue, able to tank hits and finish quests faster. 
---
I think there would need to be a stronger argument for making that kind of change than simply "it sucks getting unlucky occasionally during a certain level range and dying a few times more than average". I know that paraphrasing comes off a little condescending, but I'm just trying to emphasize that it's a relatively minor inconvenience that's mitigated by gear and leveling. Unless I'm misunderstanding your point. I've leveled almost every class to 60 and didn't feel warrior or paladin hit % was broken. It just takes a different mindset that other classes. 
---
If devs are willing to make that kind of specific change to address a minor issue with warrior balance while leveling, then they would be making changes anywhere and everywhere. 
---
You are mixing 2 different games buddy:)
---
Looks like he has the shadow fang keep caster shoulders haha
---
What's the point of adding hit %? For which classes? Rogues are by no measure an easier class to level than paladin, so why not give them a boost also? Alright rogues don't need hit % to level, so lets give them something else instead. It's just a bad desire / request, in all fairness. Some classes excel in PvE leveling, and others are much more desired in PvE leveling - you're not going to be waiting for a half hour + because you can't find a DPS... but you may be waiting that amount of time for a tank.
---
Do we have any actual wizard on reddit? Are the mage spells realistic? :)
---
&gt;or it being an absolute death sentence if you pull 1 extra mob.
---
YOU FUCKING DIE TO A LEVEL 9 MURLOC AND YOU WILL LIKE IT
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say hit is much of an issue if you know how to quest efficiently as a melee class.
---
If you‚Äôre fighting mobs your level, it‚Äôs gonna be slow, the mob‚Äôs avoidance is gonna be an issue, misses will happen, glancing blows too.
---
Mobs 2+ levels higher are gonna be a nightmare and soloing two of them may be a death sentence.
---
But, if you cycle your questing, cast a wide net geographically and focus on killing lower level mobs you will excel. Prioritizing green quests is a must, those mobs get chewed up fast by melee classes.
---
I leveled a warrior on a popular private server in about 7.5 days /played this way and managed to avoid a good amount of that headache, I even spent majority of my time dual wielding which is supposed to suffer even more from the lack of hit%.
---
And as previously mentioned by other users, you gotta use the best weapon you can. You should replace your initial weapon at lvl 5 from the vendor for example and continue to upgrade as much as possible.
---
lol they are not removing flying or arenas from BC or WotLK.
---
Well, happy to have reminded you, lol.  Bask in the jealousy of my 4 karma!  
---
oh if i could be 15 again xD
---
Very helpful, ty dude! 
---
Well because they have stealth is the biggest difference.
---
Well because paladins have mana and warriors have rage is the biggest difference.
---
I'm in a "guild" (group of 30+ on discord). The majority (myself included) didn't raid in vanilla, some didn't even play during vanilla. The whole philosophy of the guild is: 
---
1: to smell the roses while leveling, enjoy the proces, take our time. No rush, no guides. 
---
2: Start raiding after around 6 months when everyone is 60. No rush, no guides.
---
What each individual does we don't care about. But tactics during raids will be a process of discovery, not copying a kill video on youtube.
---
Of course, if we are stuck on the same boss for weeks we will look up tactics, but only as a last resort. And the way people on reddit are talking about MC and Onyxia it seems we will be able to handle it as long as we are disciplined.
---
I know of guilds who did this even during vanilla. They raided content without looking up tactics beforehand, even though those tactics had been posted online for months. After all, it's much more fun and rewarding figuring something out for yourself.
---
I tried to turn my boss to a sheep, didn't work. LFG any work, am hungry now can't conjure stuff out of thin air either...
---
God this game was amazing back in the day. I still remember going over to a buddy‚Äôs house after school and seeing who could get the farthest without dying. Thanks for posting this
---
HPala can farm undead. Resto/Feral druid can likely go farm bosses from mid-tier dungeons, all can do herb/alchemy and stuff. Shaman can go ele/resto to some extent. But in the end you can make money without mass killing mobs.
---
I just  played it a few months ago for the first time, still fun to do.
---
Okay sure, my point still stands though. Nova bandage only really applies to melee. And if melee touches you, you are already done. Once a warrior or rogue gives you hamstring/crippling poison, there is no way out. So you shouldnt theoretically lose health if you play the matchup correctly or, once you do, you shouldnt need to refill it because they wont touch you again. 
---
And yeah I know the real wPvP is a lot more complicated than that, but the point is that FA definitely isnt useless, but it's not as useful for mage as it is for a lot of other classes.
---
elemental shamans are the best for this in my opinion
---
Ganking lvl ?? locks who are questing and low. 
---
What does stealth have to do with recourse?  You're undercutting your own argument.
---
Maybe I'll just take the time to mess around and see what kind of build I can put together early game.
---
I'm pretty sure majority od players (aka the zerg) is currently around the silk levels, so it makes sense its cheap. Wait for few more weeks and it will go up dramatically.
---
Hopefully it will be a graphic update 
---
Except druid are actually good raid offtank and are preferred main tank on a few boss.
---
I also love paladins and dislike healing. But you only have to heal in raids. Yes, its a big part when you reach 60, but there is no other class that can do what a paladin can (wear plate, hit with a big 2 hander, bubble, heal, dispell, stun... Their kit is amazing) so i will gladly take that tradeoff.
---
Thank you for both of your ideas. I think I will start a rogue when vanilla hits.
---
I wasted much time on this back in high school.  Hadn't thought about it since really, until the classic announcement came.
---
on my warrior i always liked getting them super low keep hamstring and rend up while i shoot them with a bow and do /train.
---
this time im maining a lock so maybe a single dot and curse of exhaustion or fead and /cheer? idk ill have to see whats a silly way to kill someone. im gonna alt a sham or a druid so maybe get them low and let searing and earthbind totem slowly kill them 
---
&gt;Why would you grind grey mobs stupid?
---
When I say grind I obviously mean grinding efficiently. Ofcourse you can have no downtime if you hamstring kite a mob for three minutes. Acting like a smartass dont really contribute much.
---
So let me spell it out as clear as I can since using your brain is too hard.
---
You cannot EFFECTIVELY kill mobs as a warrior with no downtime if you kill similar level mobs.
---
As stated above warcraft 3 reforged and WoW classic are two different games and genres however Classic World of Warcraft and it's first 2 expansions are heavily based on the lore and story of the Warcraft RTS games. Personally I played the original Warcraft 2 and Warcraft 3 RTS games before World of Warcraft released back in 2004 and in my opinion the overall theme and feel of those games, including early versions of WoW are what I consider to be the core of the entire IP. 
---
they're not that stupid, there's shit tons of free money to make with classic servers and they won't ruin it for a cash shop. They know the classic community won't tolerate that
---
Go rogue man don‚Äôt go Priest or everyone is just going to want you to heal. Rogue is a fun class in PvP and PvE. The stealth can make a lot of quests  really easy and they also have things like pickpocket and poisons that add a lot of flavor. As a rogue you get to choose when to engage and are also capable of getting out of a lot of sticky situations. 
---
What does stealth have to do with hit %? You're not making much sense.
---
I had to buy them from the guild bank. I was massively in debt by the time i crafted it
---
Toggelable in that case.
---
The WoD models made Humans and Night Elves entirely unplayable. You SEEN that Nelf male run animation?
---
Me too... can't wait.
---
Preaching to the choir. I did play both in the 2004 beta and in vanilla.
---
Definitely toggleable, and definitely not the new models, just higher res and better quality versions of the originals. 
---
I used the bracket percentages. you need these approximate standings to gain arround 7000-8000 rank points.  
---
R10 is 40000 RP which means that 7000-8000 is required to eat up the decay once you hit the 30000 range.  
---
Even if it doesnt work it doesnt stop instance farming, it just slows it a bit. Nothing can stop people from hitting a macro to strip their gear and suiciding, or just drowning themselves in Mara.. Not to mention instances like DM:N don't even require you to reset because farming the bugs/boss/dogs happens right near the zone in spot, so you can just walk out.
---
Finding 5 fellow lowbie hunters and viper stinging the mana off lvl 60 mages. Seeing them scramble not being able to retaliate.
---
Dude you brought rogues into the conversation all I've been doing is unwisely answering your asinine questions.  You clearly can't even keep track of what your saying, so that makes me done with this conversation.
---
actually the mage is a priest. and the priest is wielding the heal dagger from the AQ opening quest chain reward.
---
as I never had the goal to progress fast I can't even tell how much exactly. at least 3 months.   
---
although I did drop some or gain next to nothing occasionally in the 8-10 for hitting a too high standing. 
---
I hate AB so AB weekends usually set me back a good bit.
---
The main problem with Challenging shout (ranged aoe taunt) is that unlike regular taunt, it doesnt "give you" the threat of the current top target but instead it just temporarily forces all nearby target to attack you for 6 seconds. Also the CD is 10min which means you only get to use it once, (maybe twice if the fight gets prolonged) Same deal with Mocking blow.  This all means that if you dont manage to build more threat than the currently highest threat player, then boss will switch back to that player after the challenging shout or mocking blow expires.
---
Oof. Ok, here we go...
---
&gt; for especially warriors and paladins 
---
Especially. Did you mean specially? Exclusively? If so, edit it or use the proper word next time, and if not- then you are opening this hit % up for other classes, so this is your own argument I'm waging with you.
---
&gt; unwisely answering your asinine questions 
---
How everyone in this thread feels, I imagine.
---
What the fuck are you trying to achieve with those hashtags. Rofl
---
Thus, the *"(in varying degree though)"*
---
And this is exactly why I love the classic community
---
20 people failING TO **LOOT THE FUCKING DOG FUCK**
---
I can't wait to roll a hunter, so I can roll need on everything again!
---
Rofl. Yes this ^^
---
I was told at the time by my groups that they couldn't tank raid content since Crushing Blows would kill them. But hell maybe they just didn't want to lose an Innervator, I dunno.
---
I wanted to, but at 29 a girl took my virginity.
---
Re replying cause last one was removed because of private names, but I did it on two very well known servers (one that was shut down.) Now the economy wasn't nascent which made it much easier for the ah, and 8 did run SM quite a few times in the end because I liked it. 
---
What has no changes got to do with pavlova? Also no, no changes 
---
Ahhhhhhhhhh. I thought he meant unsubbed from the subreddit
---
To put it simply, if it is a change then the answer is no.
---
cool, poor book
---
&gt;  it should be possible to make just raid of 20-30 people to have more loot per player am i wrong?
---
It's not about reducing the raid size but reducing the time it takes to clear each raid instance.  MC and BWL can be done in 30 minutes by competitive guilds
---
is this supposed to be funny or somehow good content?
---
If you like challenges, why stop at blind? Raid blindfolded!
---
Priest PvE: you will be healing, dungeons are usually more fun to heal than raids
---
Priest PvP: as shadow you melt faces (= one of the scariest classes to play against), as healer you will be loved by your teammates. The best spells you have in PvP regardless of specc are disspell and PW:S
---
Rogue PvE: equip your two swords and slash at the closest enemy
---
Rogue PvP: Sneak around looking for a target. If you see a sitting caster, one shot him. If you see anyone out of position, stun lock him to death and then gtfo before you have a million dots on you that will kill you
---
Honestly both classes could not be more different, totally depends on what you want to do. Both classes share one thing: They are about average levelers and can farm okay, but not exceptionally.
---
I‚Äôm in a similar position. Love tanking but don‚Äôt have the schedule to consistently raid.
---
I did consider rolling druid given I will likely be only tanking 5-10 mans. But then as the months tick on (classic is forever after all) the druid will be less relevant if I do decide to raid on the side.
---
Like you guys, I plan to aiming for a fury warrior set and will get prot pieces naturally on the side.
---
I think I plan to start level 60 life as arms as it will enable me to pvp/farm casually and still tank 5 mans.
---
I‚Äôll respect fury once I have the gear and will look at casual raiding.
---
Good luck all!
---
Well i don't miss this one bit, makes the rep grind take forever.
---
But my point is that your not going to use tailoring until lv 60. So while leveling spend the cloth on first aid, and then once your lv 60 just farm it again. Your a mage you can grind cloth quickly. 
---
Imo being able to first aid while leveling is more useful than having tailoring while leveling.
---
We don't know for sure if cross-realm BG's will be in. Blizzard has made no mention of them as of yet. They were in 1.12, but it's also a highly controversial change at the very end of vanilla. Personally I think cross-realm BG's in levelling brackets may be good, as in the long-term levelling brackets tend to die out (although that takes quite a while).
---
In general I detest cross-realm BG's though. The moment they implemented it in retal, BG's lost practically all their lustre to me. The levelling brackets were the only interesting ones to me after that, as you could at least sometimes recognise names in there.
---
Well there's like a couple of million others that feel the same way, hence WoW only has 2,5ish million subscribers left.
---
BGs will not be in the game at release
---
I like the music videos 10000x more
---
Dismounting people by turning them into icky gnomes
---
I preferred AV after they changed it to be honest, most of the combat was largely pointless and the ‚Äòbig battles were just people spamming their AoE which isn‚Äôt exactly fun or skilful.
---
Max feline swiftness and you're more useful in PvP as a WSG flag carrier, because even with LOTP talent ferals are a bit lackluster in damage. This build looks like you want to be an annoyance but still not really useful in anyway.
---
Shred build kinda sucks without clearcasting and the extra crit from LOTP.
---
OP may as well be asking for the lottery numbers
---
Maybe it will make streamers chose PvE servers in Classic, which will be a win for most. Sooo, I'd say it serves a cause :)
---
Sure toggleable content, but I'm not a developer so I can't honestly know what they will do with classic wow. 
---
 
---
Pick a seal and auto attack.
---
Heal as needed.
---
Most people are running the cookie cutter specs. Alot of people are not. After a year of vanilla most people were looking up guides back then as well. 
---
Guilds might not raid more than two days when there's only MC and Ony. But they certainly will when ZG, BWL, AQ20, AQ40 and Naxx is out. If you think any guilds except for the hardest of the hardcore guilds will progress and do farm content with 2 days a week you are mistaken. If you think you can progress in AQ/Naxx with less than 35-40 players you are mistaken. 
---
We are currently progressing in Naxx, and we have many players still needing MC gear, we have a ret who's out-dps'ed by tanks and we have a couple of people in blues still. This is not uncommon. This is a fact. I dont play other games, so I wouldnt know about the situation there. So i guess private servers are the exception if you say so. 
---
If you're even on this subreddit it means that you are more hardcore and more interested in the game than the average player, and as a concequence the opinions and topics here are colored by that. 
---
he's got an axe in his hand though. Druids can't wield axes in vanilla.
---
frost nova blanket cs bomb cone of comd pom frostbolt fireblast
---
Camping hotspots with a group of friends. The north entrance of BRM is great for this.
---
Lmao Kotick doesn't give a shit which game is on top, as long as it's his. And classic WoW is pretty much free money since they get all the content for almost no work.
---
saving for later
---
Mind controlling people off of ledges. Maybe make them dance a bit first, or cast some buffs on my own character, muahaha.
---
why have stam buffs? if your hp rarely even goes down?
---
lol yeah, its like trying to avoid finding out who won the Super Bowl... good luck!
---
I remember a patch in TBC when the imp's firebolt was boosted to insane levels (by accident I guess) Combined with the book, my imp did more damage than my shaman friend of equal lvl.  They quickly fixed the bug though. 
---
Removed - rule 1.
---
That's interesting, tanking is the 1 spec I didn't try on my druid in vanilla/tbc. Didn't have the confidence back then but I wouldn't mind trying it now. Kinda assumed it's only good for 5 mans, nice to know raid OT is perhaps an option too.
---
What about just having the free server transfers?
---
If you play on a high-pop realm, a server transfer to a dying realm is available and free.
---
Great! Thanks a million
---
You're just confirming to me that you had no idea what pre-cross realm bgs were like, your arguments are just fantasized scenarios based on false pserver imitations.
---
I played vanilla as horde on a pvp server, the queues were impossibly long, the only way to grind honor was to farm tyrande and varian, if was too laggy to raid. When we did get into bgs it was always a stomp, so the limited honor was easy to control.
---
Unlike private servers, you are faction locked, so rerolling meant playing on new realms. Once cross realm bgs came out, queue times dropped to 5min, and server identity was far from lost.
---
We knew the good guilds and premades from the other servers and started developing strategies against their playstyles, and the trash talk on battlegroup forums was brutal. No identity was lost. I have no idea what you're going on about with streamers, alliance paladins ect... You realize horde have the easiest time pve with windfury, right? There was no phasing in classic either so not sure what you're talking about.
---
Just because you have no job or don't like streamers, doesn't mean you know what's best for a healthy game. You're going to want people with jobs and life's playing, so you have someone to beat and feel good about yourself. 
---
now i wanna see your ui. it has to be all kinds of horrible
---
People advocating for incremental changes to Vanilla can already play that: BfA, the culmination of all the additions made to Vanilla.
---
Let Classic be classic.
---
When MC gear is not useful anymore, guilds still want to do it for the Thunderfury chance  (BiS tank weapon)  Some guilds I saw going for the double strategy:   make two 20 man raids for MC, to double your chances.  In practice these raids often had a few more people, up to 25 each, because you would take some extra alts along or friends from outside the guild that were interested in the gear that the main guiildies don't want.  (note many of these 20 'core raid' member were already alts.) 
---
Using terrain features for stealth instead of hard game mechanics. Hiding underwater, over hills, in bushes, behind trees, and whatever other terrain is available to me.
---
&gt; That's because private servers have more content available to them than retail did.
---
actually, thats a fact regardless, yea in a varying degree they tried but its how it is, and the talents are a huge gamechanger
---
We must go deeper...
---
Nice
---
incase I pull agro, means I can take a couple hits.
---
Honestly no, I think it was a poor decision. Having one special class each really didn't do much for this supposed "identity" IMHO. The factions identity came from Horde being a ragtag bunch of barbarians (that have a point obviously) while the Alliance saw themselves as this righteous force that fought for the good. Honestly if your entire identity is crushed because one class option was added, you didn't have much identity going on.
---
Mechanically as well it was poor design. In raids everyone had a purpose and place, a time where they mechanically were needed. Except Pallies and Shamans, because you can't require a class a faction doesn't have, you can't balance around their presence, they just sort of are there. So neither were that strong, and it didn't matter if they were weak.
---
Same for PVP, sure there were times and places where either became strong but neither could really be allowed to excel because some vague semblance of balance was needed, letting either rampage unchecked would have been stupid.
---
Could the eventual adding of them in TBC have been handled better? Yes of course, IMO even without new races it could have been done. If you could have been a druid in touch with nature, no reason why you couldn't be a shaman, in touch with nature. If you could be a warrior, no reason why you couldn't be a warrior that found god. Doesn;t have to be the same god.
---
Faction imbalance in a 1-10 zone, who‚Äôd of thought ?
---
You will still see lots of people even with sharding, where are you people getting the idea that it won‚Äôt be?
---
Look at the demo ffs, people everywhere, but not so much you have stand around for 2 hours trying to tag a mob.
---
If you dont really feel like healing, healing will ultimately feel like you enable others to play the game and it becomes a chore.
---
That's how it was for me atleast. I leveled a shaman to 60, healed preBiS dungeons, healed raids and I never felt like I actually played the game. I made it possible so others can play.
---
/camp will almost 100% not going to be in Classic.
---
Instance reset will almost 100% be in Classic.
---
[I use to go with a healing touch build for resto druid](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0x0xcMxsZZxxckxqo) that was "fine" at solo'ing things in the open world. 
---
You pretty much just spam healing touch so you have almost 0 raid healing other than down ranked healing touches, You just sit the tank which a priest or paladin are better at but most people are not too picky when it comes to druids. 
---
Viable? Yes, Optimal? Lol no. 
---
start with dumb or simple combos.  
---
frostnova, cs, frostbolt, coc.  
---
forstnova, run away, pelt with frostbolts etc.  
---
frostnova, sheep, run away.  
---
the basic stuff.  
---
at first, don't even think about what your enemy is doing, just do your thing.  
---
now everytime your dumbed down playstyle failed you have to reflect on why it did.  
---
its a simple way to learn what you can or can't do against the other classes.
---
duels help here alot.
---
and well, if everything else fails then there is always PoM pyro for you.
---
Ever consider you just don‚Äôt enjoy the game as much any more?
---
I‚Äôm 29 and have zero problem spending 12 hours in front of the PC before I even know what‚Äôs happening.
---
I always think of [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja1j7xWpB3w&amp;t=62s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja1j7xWpB3w&amp;t=62s) when pala/shaman antagonism is mentioned.
---
Unbreakable wrecking a T2 paladin which comes to TS and whines about shamans being OP. Never gets old!
---
That gnome in the middle is a smart one, she has 36 servants! 
---
helping some allies with their pulls, using psychic scream and mind control. the life of a priest is a fun one. 
---
They barely even did anything, where‚Äôs the fun?
---
I‚Äôd rather be out trying to 1vX

Here is the current advertisement for the guild:

---
The GM. :)
---
We're not discussing the most profitable way to make money but the less time consuming in the long run.
---
OP want to be able to log for 25min and make 50g, so being able to make 4 transmute is nearly the only way to do it. I'm pretty sure the CD is 24h and not 48
---
I hope your guild will keep some record on how it goes, once you start raiding,  I think it is a nice idea, but in practice it's impossible to keep out all knowledge. 
---
What rustled my jimmies so damn much with Draenei was the fact that I was a gnome mage main.
---
Therefore my gnome looked like retarded midgets with their little stupid gadgets when a fully fletched space ship descended on Azeroth. 
---
It's like a musketeer charging a todays soldier with his M16. Just felt stupid for gnomes to be this sidelined.
---
you get downvotes yet you are fucking right.
---
these "will there be..." threads should be deleted by default.
---
they serve no purpose.
---
Suiciding means corpse runs. Everyone did it back in Vanilla.
---
Gold making by dungeon farming will be as fast as it was supposed to be, not how it is on private servers. yes, it won't stop it, but it will be enough to be acceptable for the economy.
---
I‚Äôm in exactly the same spot. I‚Äôm thinking I‚Äôll do both but Paly first. Paly gets free mount and I‚Äôll be doing herbalism and alchemy. I‚Äôve never raided so I think Paly healing will be easier (?). For my Priest I‚Äôll take skinning/tailoring at 60 and enchanting. But if I‚Äôm healing either way is there a point doing both? Maybe I should stick with Paly and do herbalism &amp; enchanting?
---
if you don't want to heal, don't play a priest. even the most hardcore pvp shadow priests should pop out of their shadowform if the situation demands it.
---
as for priest pvp... they're wrecking balls, no other class can sow even nearly as much chaos and confusion on the battlefield. 
---
But most gameplay is still in visuals. 
---
From your viewpoint tauren should be alliance because of their peace talks, chill nature etc. 
---
But they are big brutes clobbering people with giant maces from a gameplay perspective. I preferred and still do that the horde are the "uglies" in vanilla. 
---
I always felt in awe when approaching tauren ingame and felt threatend by undeads. 
---
In Europe that is very easy, my mother wouldn't even know what sport the super bowl is. 
---
they're literally called blood knights. to each his own, but I personally rather like the lore behind them. 
---
They didnt have to rewrite much. They faced constant racial profiling and their elite units were used a canon fodder by alliance Grand Marshals aka the generals of the alliance.
---
Garithos sends Kael'thas with the bare minimum of units into a suicide mission he could only accomplish with help of the naga. 
---
This made him a war criminal and court martial deemed to execute him.
---
Good chance I‚Äôm gonna roll a priest this time around and I‚Äôve never mind controlled someone off the BRD chain before. Should be a good laugh the first time around 
---
don't quote me on that, but I'm pretty sure druids can farm lashers rather easily. barkskin + hurricane, then shift and kill the rest. 
---
The bell being anytime anyone dares to suggest anything no matter how small, here comes the auto response from the mindless herd.  Message is clear, wax nostalgia and retail bashing is all you guys want, understood.
---
Gnomes are the best! My main is a Gnome Priest and if I had the patience I‚Äôd roll a Gnome Warrior for sure.
---
In vanilla the nature of the factions was very well reflected in the hero classes (pala/shaman). 
---
Signature support spell for shaman is windfury  and purge both 100% offensive spells whereas paladin's are bubble and freedom. Bubble being defensive and freedom applied on friendly warriors offensively or mages/WLs defensively. 
---
Having a big 2hander as a warrior and windfury in your back can really just oneshot a purged enemy priest or other clothie. 
---
I felt ingame it was a huge difference between both factions and I liked that. 
---
Paladin is a better support in the end, but shaman is a lot more fun for me personally.
---
great read! also have some of those memories. never forget!
---
I don‚Äôt want to bash retail at all, I still actively play retail. 
---
But no, blizzard has openly stated there will be no changes in classic and that‚Äôs the way it should be at least for the first few years. 
---
I‚Äôm in the same situation as you regarding a Dwarf Priest and it‚Äôs making me lean into Human Paladin. I went on a private server at auto lv60 and devised a Dwarf I can live with - grey hair, blue eyes, long ponytail, large diamond beard. Maybe try that?
---
On progression, guilds will bring 40 people because they "need" all of them.
---
Once their member get some gear they'll split the raid in two raid like for Onya instead of going with 40 overgeared madman they'll go with two 20man raid
---
I agree so just say no loot swapping ever. You give the piece to the wrong person? Tough shit deal with it. Every ticket with any request to swap loot should just be binned without even a second thought. 
---
For Alliance Dwarf if is a must unless your in a raid with lots of Dwarfs and it wouldn‚Äôt matter but the Dwarf Priest will always be first pick. 
---
I‚Äôm not sure why Undead is the go to for Horde the Troll beserking ability seems better to me for raids (I‚Äôm not a PvP player).
---
Nope. This was Shattered Hand.
---
Thought this was gonna be trash but ended up finding it entertaining
---
It's funny watching that happen to alliance since I never do it, But gets done to me.
---
The base miss rate with 2hander vs the mob of an equal level (assuming you are keeping up the weapon skill within 10 points before the cap) is ranging from 5 up to 6%. 
---
If you can not handle this number and don't understand how weapon skill mechanics work and why you should have a "weapon upgrade plan" and the reasoning why it's so important, then these classes are probably not for you.
---
pretty much what this guy said.
---
Another useful tip is to train 'staves' - A lot of staves are actually really good for warr early game, for example the WC staff is much better than any other 2h weapon you can get around that level :)
---
May be an unpopular opinion but: knowing from worldchat that a specific area is being camped and then avoiding the hell out of it
---
But he talents DO change. And you‚Äôre ignoring that to try to have a semblance of any ground to stand on.
---
I provided you with 3 examples of talent changes from a single patch.
---
You seem to be saying that ‚Äúthe names of the icons in the talent tree didn‚Äôt change pst 1.6!‚Äù Even though the way taking those points affected your character did hange.
---
It‚Äôs the effects of the talents that matter, not what theyre called.
---
And, even if I agreed with your retarded position about the definition of a talent change... now you‚Äôre in a position where you need to justify items being progressive, but talent trees AND abilities being released in their 1.12 variant.
---
Seriously, you‚Äôre becoming more and more retarded every time you post.
---

This is what I played at school in the computer lab while dreaming of being at home playing WoW. I think I was playing it on onemorelevel or something 
---
do they not have that scroll of resurrection thing still?
---
It's a guild on the big private server. They gank players under level 20 with level 60s and make videos bragging about it. They had an interview on countdown to classic where they talked about how awesome they are for "keeping world pvp alive". It's truly pathetic. 
---
Because we're called Worriers ;) for real there's so much talk about how many warrs there'll be, so I'm keen to figure my plan
---
thought this was gonna be something to do with the chicken escort quest hah
---
Hicks with sticks part 2! (Ganking in farm outfits)
---
Overpower critting rogues
---
lol, a few months ago there was an STV farming location video - the crystal basilisk cave.
---
I went there at the appropriate level and there was a Horde player farming too.  I helped him kill the first mob and then we began taking it in turns to tag and kill each mob.
---
We did this for about 15-20 mobs before an Alliance duo came in and killed him instantly, lol
---
You're still wrong in the context of the thread. Sure if you dick around at level 40 for an extra week you'll get your mount. At that point most of the people will be ahead of you and will have enough gold to throw at the AH. However, that's a different story. The best thing you could do is get to 40 and have enough gold for your mount, but hey, play the game the way you want.
---
I have played priest and rogue extensively since TBC, and now I'm playing them both on a private server. Boachi's response is spot on.
---
I find Vanilla rogue to lean too much toward burst with poor mobility, survivability, and utility (at least compared to later xpacs.) I am a rogue at heart but the old school gameplay can be unfulfilling for me at times.
---
Priest has some particularly powerful abilities that are keeping me entertained: Psychic Scream is amazing, PW: Shield, and Dispel Magic. Having a two buff offensive and defensive dispel is absolutely huge in Vanilla. (Also the only Horde healer with magic dispel.) I love playing Disc/Holy or Shadow. As Shadow I can play as a fully functional healer/dispeller, I just go OOM faster. You completely wreck in 1v1, too.
---
My only issue with Priest is the buffing. To fully self buff I actually go completely OOM and am very vulnerable. It takes a lot of time and water. The high mana cost of buffs does have a very cool side effect though: People actually appreciate buffs. A large portion of the time, when I buff someone with PW: Fort, they actually /thank or buff you in return.
---
ability changes aren't talent changes moron. learnt he difference.
---
Reminds me of Terraria, which btw is great game to check out while waiting for classic if anyone is interested. There are some similar hooks and other things to wow in that game, so people might enjoy it + its very cheap game with hundreds of hours of content.
---
Quote: "Edit: This list is currently for the private scene but it will be updated to fit the official Classic servers, once Blizzard announces something final."
---
On private servers AV's are either rushed or prolonged for 1-3 hours depending on how eager the factions are to win. Guessing we'll see a mixture on classic.
---
Dangerous game friend, I will Soulstone and Healthstone and your day will be ruined! (not to mention, maybe get a void sac in there somewhere)

Except ret paladins are useless unless you commit Esfand levels of autism and even then you'll be parsing mediocre as fuck, paladins are healers fam
---
Constructive : Just cleaned out opinions put out in a proper readable manner without any childish , "if you dont like it , its not for you go play TBC / Retail" stuff.
---
Unbiased : Lets say i main warrior in vanilla and dont want the meta to change. Saying something like, **" I loved playing warrior , it was fun and hope to do it again , there might be some unbalances in some areas but i just think its a pandora's box and things might go terribly wrong with blizzard changing other stuff one by one."** 
---
is pretty much a subjective reply , and that is **unbiased**
---
Funny enough a majority if not all people said somethings along the lines of , " dont want to open that pandora's box" while acknowledging the imbalances , which helped me understand that more people fear blizzard fucking up and not that balanced gameplay would be bad.
---
If you think that warriors and paladins are at an "incredible leveling disadvantage" without extra hit, you shouldn't play one. Paladins especially are basically autoattack to 60, they're not hard to level, and warriors have a slightly harder time leveling in exchange for being the only real tank and still being a beast at PvP and PvE, dps-wise. If you don't want to deal with leveling a warrior, don't. There will be more than enough warriors who have no problem with a slightly more punishing time leveling.
---
We don't need any more incentives for people to roll warriors, about 20-25% will roll one either way, so why make leveling piss-easy?
---
By the way, just because I can't help it...If you can't kill 2 mobs at once as a warrior, you really shouldn't play one. Like at all. Before level 20, alright, you shouldn't pull more than one mob. But around level 20 with at least a little bit of green/blue gear? It's not that hard.
---
You didn't factor farming time into the equation before.
---
What's wrong is that if you give them an inch they'll take a mile. It's a shit precedent.
---
The meta has changed a lot. Tanks on private servers tend to wear DPS gear since TPS is more important than defense cap. Hell, sometimes people tank without a shield.
---
That was a rhetorical question. Joana's guide is explicitly for hunters.
---
To be fair, none of them would use maces anyway. Aren't exactly many good +agi maces floating around.
---
It does though. Brings player confusion and picking "wrong" server and blizzard does want that considering there is already such a thing (server type).  
---
I will only do quests appropriate for my class/race. So atiesh is not relevant
---
Also, this may help someone with your schedule that clearly enjoys PvP in the past but wants to do PvE now... you don't need to spec full prot to be a good dungeon tank or raid tank, as there was a really nice and popular spec used by many warriors in Vanilla.
---
31 Arms, 5 Fury, 15 Prot (1/3 imp Shield Block and 4/5 Defiance).
---
That build has almost as much threat generation as a pure prot warrior, and almost as much raw dps/pvp viability as a pure pvp arms warrior. You don't lose much from each. You also gain Sweeping Strikes for tanking which is nice.
---
This build means you can throw on tank gear and tank all the 60 5-mans pretty much as well as a pure prot more or less, can tank raids as an OT (bonus points if you buy a Nightfall Axe for hamstring spam DPS when not tanking) and you'll have a great time in Battlegrounds as the 31/5/15 is perfectly viable for Arms PVP.
---
ismeckye's suggestion is probably better (particularly with how fury and prot can share a nice sow 1hander) but the above is a nice option if you think you might want to spend spare non-raid time doing BGs.
---
I feel you, but the social dynamics of vanilla were defined by the class hierarchy. 
---
Also paladin had a top tier niche as pvp healers. Nothing else even came close by a long shot. 
---
It's not a precedent for change at all, considering both were present in vanilla, and it's a compromise between the two.
---
Prepare for disappointment if it stays full classic. IE horde wall climbing to get into the back of the alliance 4 minutes into the game, and map done by 10 minutes.
---
Observer nerds have AV  (and everything) down to a science.
---
Taking my healers to faction quest mobs and healing them while the enemy faction attempts to kill them, not understanding why their target keeps getting full healed.
---
Yeah, I really like the lore of blood knights myself. It bothers me how once the Sunwell was restored, blood elf paladin lore just became generic, I liked the edge they had to them up until then.
---
I'm less convinced on draenei shamans, though.
---
Bind conjure water to the mouse scroll up+down and watch TV while rubbing that lil badboi

I just don't like the ears, all of other aspects I find cool.

So many nightelf males, BLBUFUHHHHHHUUU.....sorry i puked
---
Just be aware that A LOT of people will have played vanilla private servers for years when they join Classic.
---
No one ever use gear score though. Thats not even possible in Vanilla.
---
Priest with Perdition's Blade? Excellent choice. \*SMORK\*
---
Yea, because dps warriors break the game now and have threat issues. So the only important factor is how much you can enable your warriors.
---

Hey, I‚Äôve been in Retro WoW but I can‚Äôt work out what to do or who to speak to. What dungeons should you run and how to get in a group. Any advice?
---
I wasn‚Äôt young then and I‚Äôm a lot older now :S
---
Ignite mages have way more personal DPS than fury warriors though.
---
Is it viable to get the whole Tier 1 set or is that never gonna happen in reality?
---
You had 3 60's before BC even launched? That's some fucking dedication.
---
I couldn't stand leveling a single alt until at least the 2.3 item/xp revamp. Before that the only other chars I made were lower level twinks.
---
same fam same but the more I see stuff like this more I realise there's a tun of us thinking the same so it'll be an all or nothing thing. Like we all stay and it turns out there's heaps of us or we all end up going and there's none of us xD 
---
This seems delusional to me. It wont slow it down by any measurable margin man. And if it did, we would just use the group invite trick to reset instead, thus saving the time since we KNOW that method will work.... Or farm DM:N and BRD and other runs that don't require restarts for efficiency.
---
No matter which way this swings, if you are expecting this to slow gold into the economy you are just wrong. Players will do whatever brings that gold per hour. Which one is irrelevant.
---
Classic is Vanilla. Should be Vanilla. Not Vanilla+ ("changed for your pleasure" :P). It's a historic artifact being brought back into existence (as best as Blizzard can do that, of course).
---
It absolutely doesn't matter how good, bad, balanced or imbalanced it is. (A lot of people think it's good and want to play it as is. If you are one of them, then play it. If not, don't. The end.)
---
&lt;Hate&gt; (EU, Horde, PvP server) is recruiting knowledgeable raiders and pvp-ers.
---
About us:
---
Back in the days of glory, &lt;Hate&gt; was one of the top dogs on Boulderfist-EU (2006). More than a decade later, friends and old guild members are excited to announce that &lt;Hate&gt; is still alive!
---
Having a fine legacy at both Raiding and PvP, &lt;Hate&gt; scourged Boulderfist-EU, being nicknamed the ‚ÄúHigh Warlords Guild‚Äù, since we had the biggest amount of R14 players (names like Quatro, Zoby, Efe, Artificial, Hiphopyoyo, High come to mind). On the PvE scene, we almost cleared AQ40 and reached Naxxramas, and if we wouldnt‚Äôve been a bit late to the party, with TBC around the corner, these raids would‚Äôve been toast too. On a side note, we invented several strategies that are used even now, ahh, the times when everything was at first hand and you couldn‚Äôt possibly find tips and tricks like today...
---
Anyway, our plan is to rebuild &lt;Hate&gt; and push the envelope even further, aiming to assemble a very competitive raid that will last from first UBRS raid till Naxxramas. However, should be noted this time we‚Äôlll use a slight different approach and not go for the full hardcore experience. Instead, &lt;Hate&gt; will start as a semi-hardcore guild, thriving to build a really tight community of talented players that will be able to overcome everything. Now that we are older (but wiser!), we are fully aware that WoW Classic is a game that doesn‚Äôt evolve around who clears Molten Core fastest, but around which guilds still exist by the time serious stuff like AQ40 and Naxxramas is released. And as you probably know by now, statistics are quite grim: over 70% of the starting raiding guilds fail at clearing Blackwing Lair. Hence our approach.
---
Therefore, if you trully know that you are a talented player, don‚Äôt be shy and join our Discord server, available at https://discord.gg/8HqvwAK 
---
May this be the start of something truly spectacular.

i think things, that makes anything special, was a important in wow. its an element that went away part by part in wow expansions. everyone can do everything now. (almost) i find it much more fun if you can not do everything. decisions should matter. if i decide for horde, i cant play pally. if i decide for orc, i cant play priest. if i play a rogue i cant heal myself. it was something that made you feel special.
---
Maybe but I doubt it. Guys like that really think they are good. That streamers the type to probably insult PvE players, so I think him and getting ganked are a perfect pair tbh. I think its hypocritical to play on a PvP server and complain about WPVP and ganking (unless you WOULD play on a PvE realm but cant because none exist but when classic launches there finally wont be an excuse anymore).
---
When looting corpses and doing the quests was still a big thing.
---
You think it was fun, but I revived the experience in private servers not long ago and it gets old pretty fast. (like, first 2\~3 days and that's it)
---
It's just a mass of players hitting each other with AOEs and sniping players with low life for hours, eventually you get a single standoff when you're trying to farm some herb or following someone trying to sneak his way, but that's it.
---
Progressive content has not been confirmed yet.
---
Blizzard sucks, as a company. There are still great people there, but their tendencies to bleed out money from their customers over the past 5-6 years just made me have zero faith in them.
---
World of Warcraft is in the worst place it's ever been. People just seem to hate everything Blizzard tries to do. Titanforged? Azerite Armor? Horrible concepts! Blizzard trying to fix issues that aren't existing. They somehow forgot that **they** are the developers. They need to make a game they think is awesome - like they did with Vanilla, TBC and largely WotLK.
---
Diablo III was dead on arrival. Blizzard decided microtransactions was the best they could offer to a devote community that continued to play Diablo II despite no major updates for nearly a decade. They just took a huge shit on them and gave them the worst possible release a Diablo fan could expect.
---
I have no doubt Blizzard will manage to fuck up Classic WoW or straigth up cancel it. Hopefully not, but right now, Blizzard have less credibility than EA Games and just a few years back, not even Valve could reach them. Such a massive set back from the best and biggest game studio in the world.
---
Pretty much this. If you get a strong team or people wanting to follow orders so they can farm, the game ends really quickly.(like it was back in the day)
---
&gt;any cookie cutter DS build would be the way to go
---
And this is why 15 year later the majority of WoW players are still awful at the game. Cookie cutter builds LUL they are for the casual player who doesn't wish to learn a class.
---
Killing gnomes. I mean who isn't looking forward for this? Every other alliance race wishes they could kill gnomes, they get jealous they can't. 
---
FOR THE HORDE! 
---
the overall post was just funny. As some one who usually makes long posts, imagining the effort that went to write that stuff makes me lol.
---
&gt;Most people are running the cookie cutter specs. Alot of people are not. 
---
A big majority are running cookie cutter specs. Which is my entire point.
---
&gt;After a year of vanilla most people were looking up guides back then as well.
---
Some might've, but again, a huge majority weren't.
---
&gt;  If you think any guilds except for the hardest of the hardcore guilds will progress and do farm content with 2 days a week you are mistaken. 
---
This is literally shown at every private server release. Even the casual guilds not having the hardcore mentality, but merely request their members to show up in correct gear, enchants and buffs, absolutely cruise through BWL and most of AQ40, with the exception of a few bosses. On top of that, ZG raids are usually only a real 'guild run' in the start, but very quickly transition into being optional and something you do outside of raid days if you desire.
---
&gt; We are currently progressing in Naxx, and we have many players still needing MC gear, we have a ret who's out-dps'ed by tanks and we have a couple of people in blues still. Many of us dont have the best enchants on everything, many of us arent using every consumable. This is not uncommon.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; This is a fact. I dont play other games, so I wouldnt know about the situation there. So i guess private servers are the exception if you say so. 
---
That is absolutely uncommon and not the norm. As I said in my last post. Most guilds would not accept that, especially not at progression, unless you're actively recruiting, which is weird for newly released content. The fact that you're still progressing in Naxxramas must mean you're playing on long abandoned servers, where only a  fraction of the private server community play. Most people have moved on to two much larger servers/projects which is a much better representation of how the general private server person plays the game. This is a fact.
---
&gt; If you're even on this subreddit it means that you are more hardcore and more interested in the game than the average player, and as a concequence the opinions and topics here are colored by that. 
---
You're using your own guild as an example, playing on a server where barely anybody plays, compared to the biggest server(s) out there. That's a terrible way to try and validate your opinions about the general private server player. 
---
Same here... I honestly hope they release it early in the summer so i can get as much levels in before school starts up again. I wonder if summer break is a factor in thier release date :/
---
Every Rogue in that guild had to have had one by now, if they wanted it or not. 
---
It was still a good dagger at AQ time frame though. If I wasn‚Äôt raiding I would have continued to use it for pvp.

I wonder what he looks likeüòÇ
---
I kinda disagree here, now i'm not a big streamer or anything but i'm 100% going to roll on PVP server. I think every big streamer wants to do the same, but they just know that this will happen so they won't do it. 
---
But i think someone like sodapoppin will still roll on a PVP server he just only plays on off stream because he loves world pvp, that is what you will have to do if your a streamer, either that or you have to be prepared for people ganking you.
---
I myself will roll PVP 100% early into the game you can always go to areas where u cant get ganked (like barrens on the horde) u can level quite high there. Later on you have problems though if it's your secondary char and lots of 60's already.
---
Unexpected fights at dungeon entrances waiting on people to show up. 
---
In BFA certain classes are overrepresented in Mythic+ runs because the game is not balanced. In every new PvP season different comps do better than because the game is not balanced. 
---
This applies for every expansion since Vanilla. They have tried to balance the game since 2004, and it‚Äôs still unbalanced. 
---
 You have to understand that perfect balance is antithetical to World of Warcraft. 
---
The fuck are you talking about? I never said they were you fucking retard.
---
Use Dartol's Rod of Transformation, and join the Furbolg master race. The only true masters of the northern forests !
---
Well you don't dick around that much because there's xp in dungeons. Since you can run SM around 37 you're not waiting a week at 40 at all. I was one gold short on my first play through when I dinged 40. I'm n'y next o'e, just by knowing a few grinding spots I'll be way ahead. 
---
/played?
---
I see you get transformed for 3 mins. Does combat or anything break it?
---
Getting good is leveling using a strategy tailored to the class you intend to level, not hamfisting yourself into a guide you'll only be able to follow somewhat well at best.
---
I was about to say "damn, what is up with this guy" then he brought up Call of Duty and now I fully understand.
---
I've played hunter/priest/paladin/druid and will try tauren shaman for classic. I enjoy trying new classes and quests that come with those classes. I would advocate trying a new class.
---
The harder to level, the easier to find a raid spot. You're being too myopic to see the full picture.
---
Avoiding it
---
I played a Rogue main vanilla, but played a priest in raids and pvp as well. I also played a pvp‚Äôr shadow priest throughout WotLK. 
---
Rogue was a blast for me, in MC and BWL I would top damage charts and would compete with arms warriors and mages for highest damage. My gear translated easily to pvp and although I had a pve spec, I still dominated pvp. 
---
Leveling wise, it was such a small part of the game for me, but it isn‚Äôt as easy as a shadow priest. I found that it took a while to level because it‚Äôs tempting to stealth all the time which makes you miss out in gridding quest mobs as much. 
---
Finding groups is harder as a Rogue because there‚Äôs a lot of them and you have to compete with other dps for group slots. But make a name for yourself through pvp and dueling outside IF or Org and you‚Äôll make friends in good guilds.
---
When you beat 90% of a guild in duels and hang out with them in game, they will most likely want you in their guild for pve or pvp.
---
As a priest, leveling was easier and finding groups was easy. In raids, they are more fun imo. As a Rogue, I spam 2 buttons, as a priest, you have to monitor your entire group plus help heal other groups if their healer is oom or dies. It‚Äôs more dynamic.
---
What sucked about playing priest was that I was pve spec. Once I left a raid, I had no desire to pvp because I hated healing pvp, I wanted to melt faces, which was difficult when you are geared and spec‚Äôd to heal.
---
A guild with only 30 consistent raiders will fall apart once AQ comes out. It's a terrible idea.
---
As a fury warrior this is true, but you'll still be really suboptimal without edgemaster's.
---
ur body is all sore after sitting 2 hours? why?
---
True, however you can still follow joanna's as a warrior. Add in some dungeons a long the way since you're going to need the gear anyway and you're set. 
---
Nope. And I am 45. I do get burn-out if I play for long consequetive hours straight, but not from one longer session.
---
So what I will do in Classic release weeks when I have all day to play is take frequent breaks. Play for an hour, do laundry, play for an hour, go outside to do shopping, play for an hour, run a few miles, take a shower, play an hour...etc
---

---
For those who seem to think he's serious, it's a copy-pasta with different wording.
---
looks sick :D
---
Thanks for the response - this is really good advice overall. I'd not really considered a lot of the PVP motivation for the basic 21/0/30 build but definitely agree that the 20/0/31 options above would be much more suited
---
For pve its debatable in this case with divine int vs spiritual focus. There were some raid encounters where it was needed but not a huge amount and given the fast cast of FoL anyway you could usually do okay on these with just a 50% conc aura, but YMMV.
---
Was it confirmed that Sanctity Aura didn't affect the procs from Seal of Command? I only started playing Paladin shortly before Wrath (I was a prot warrior/bear druid in Vanilla) so wasnt aware that it was so jank back then.
---
After progress, all the serious guilds will do split runs of half mains, half alts/socials, to get more valuable loot to mains, so you are not wrong.

---
this exactly
---
/camp is private server thing. So no.
---
It's sad because it's true.
---
Well, as far as #nochanges concerned, I hope they keep patching class balance all the time in Classic. That's a big part of vanilla too after all: Never knowning what ability is adjusted and what class is the new favor of the month.
---
\#noQoLchanges fine by me.
---
It does not matter if it was by design or not. If it is not a bug - it should stay in classic.
---
it does not only increase pet damage but also pet armor by 100%, which makes your Voidwalker a tanking beast
---
at least the felhound gets 1 resist (or 2?) per level, so with master demonoligist he has some serious resist. T1 set bonus can buff that even further
---
That's why I can never play a Hunter. I want to feel like my character is strong, not that he has a strong NPC friend. 
---
This reply may have just convinced me to roll warrior instead of rogue
---
&gt;However, I have no trust in Blizz at the moment to do something like that and not fuck it up  
---
You say that yet it was your beloved Blizzard from back then that made all those trash specs and left them like that for 2 to 4 years.  
---
Makes no sense honestly.  
---
According the census, surprisingly few people pick hunter as their main, so currently  what you see on pservers are hunter alts for farming stuff probably.
---
I don‚Äôt know why there is so much talk about leveling. That is such a small part of the game imo
---
Nope, that's the beauty of it.
---
And it has no cooldown, so you can reapply it as long as you want.
---
One thing that breaks it is mounts.
---
And you also must be careful not to complete the quest that gives the rod to you (but you can abandon the quest to free the slot in your journal and the rod won't be destroyed).
---
Well, since class overhaul is a huge part of vanilla, I hope they do some class balance patch every few months like they did in vanilla. Because that's the real vanilla xp after all: Never knowing when it's your class to shine for a while.
---
I would take a mage over a hundred for a five man dungeon any day of the week and twice on Sunday. The free water, CC, and AOE they bring are invaluable. That being said, I wouldn't turn away a hunter, they do some stupid high DPS while leveling.
---
Ice, Blade, Sun, Frosty, Twinblade
---
All those cool sounding short words or that could represent your class.
---
Comic names like Moo (tauren), Pinky (gnome with pink hair) etc
---
For hunters, combinations with shot: Darkshot, Deadshot etc
---
And of course, lots of famous vanilla player names (leeroy comes to mind)
---
I bought a physical copy for myself and my gf last year to study up on. Awesome book 
---
Yes, my guild was dedicated throughout MC and BWL but once AQ came out, we fell apart completely. Then I went full pvp mode.
---
No idea. I hardly ever use it. Need to shift to caster to cast it and when I do, it's normally time for an emergency heal.
---
Maybe for PvP so you can make distance.
---
This is a great idea. Best of both worlds. Even better if you could customise your own queue times in the UI.
---
So if you never want to play with people from outside your server you wouldn't have to.
---
Not to be a stickler because it doesn't matter, but [Improved Leader of the Pack](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Improved_Leader_of_the_Pack) is what you're thinking of for Feral.  I played Feral Druid a lot, so it sticks out to me. :P
---
But yes, one of the reasons TBC is supposedly the "best" expansion is because Classic had the most and most serious broken things of any era of WoW, and TBC finally fixed them.
---
Except for maces.
---
Looks like a pretty reasonable spec tbh. You've got most of the necessary talents. You can probably drop 1 in Shadow Weaving and put it somewhere else. Mind Blast CD is pretty important though since it's big damage. Not really sure what you could drop though to take it.
---
Depends. If we're going DMW a freezing trap is great. In general traps are great and especially so at places where mobs cant be polymorphed.
---
Downloaded it, thanks for sharing.
---
Perfect balance can never be achieved in a class based mmo.
---
Regular balancing would just change the meta once in a while, which in my opinion is nice. (It gives every class a time to shine and a time to cry :D)
---
Glad you like the idea, I wouldn't like to see it customise-able though - simply because we're all human beings and we all follow the path of least resistance. 
---
Everyone should have the same playing field imo - equally, there may be some level of wintrading/dodging/exploiting if you have the option to swap between xrealm and server only. Would have to be policed pretty heavily.
---
"buy and stock orders" Was this what Guild Wars 2 does with its marketboard?  If you're unfamiliar with Guild Wars 2's marketboard: When buying something like a crafting material, you don't look at individual listings.  You simply buy it as if it's an NPC shop, and whatever seller you bought from is largely random and unknown.  Undercutting is literally not allowed by the game, if I remember correctly.  This makes buying and selling completely stress-free, and I wish every WoW clone ever did this such as FFXIV.
---
 RemindMe!  3 hours
---
Is there any "final" version or what is the farthest one jn development? I loved this little flash game especially when I came back every once in a while and it was longer!
---
East coast, but I'm all about: Glory to the Alliance!
---
Disagree, as I won't really be in cat form while carrying. 
---
This a pretty standard PVP build with some of my own tweaks to suit my personal taste. You don't need to min/max to be effective or outplay someone.  
---
casters get just as many resists, as melee do misses at early levels.
---
Just try to level on quests/mobs that are the same level and below
---
memories
---
Nah not imp leader, was more looking for a way to buff their DPS. But yes you are right with your second part
---
I mean who could blame you. World PvP amongst relatively equal level players is one thing. Walking into a camped gank fest is another.
---
I am with you. I have no faith what-so-ever in Activi$ion (calling them Blizzard is a disgrace). I will be playing classic if they don't ruin it.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if they force you to buy retail expansions to play classic, so they just churn them out. $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
---
Thanks! Will definately check them out.
---
When you get to the point where you can raid MC with 25 people or so, chances are those people are already geared out and just going for the fun/thunderfury/sulfuras.. so you might as well fill those last 15 slots with people who would put the MC gear to use.
---
As a fellow fps junky, and previous wow junky, I have noticed that the better I get at fps games the worse I get at fighting/ mmo pvp games. I don't know if its the same for you or not. The modem twitch reaction shooters reward you for noticing any pixel movement and reacting it's nearly all muscle memory and very little thinking, and I think after years it literally rewires how your brain interprets things. I used to play wow very competitivly in arena and always did very well. Then when I quit I played nearly nothing but fps games. Some years later ESO online came out and even as simplistic as its combat was compared to wow, it took months for me to get to where I felt comfortable competitively. 
---
For classic? Yes
---
We've been asking for classic for years and they've ignored us because they follow money only. It took them having such a steep decline in retail over the years that they are questioning the longevity of the game. 
---
Do we want classic WoW that blizzard created? FUCK YES.
---
Do we want 'classic' WoW that is littered with Activi$ion garbage that we've come to expect from nearly all of the retail expansions?  "Don't these guys have wallets??" Activi$ion would be asking themselves.
---
Well you don‚Äôt have fun then. I‚Äôll be in my guild where we can do what we want. Because I don‚Äôt have to do what you want or think is meta. 
---
This guy is straight out of 2005.  
---
Even clicking on his 1-5 spells lol  
---
Shadowmeld drops you out of combat? Nevermind then, that shit is pretty good. 
---
A side scroller with pixel art based on Warcraft would be badass
---
Is there a place that has the base stats for all the demons? I can't remember how big of a deal it was for people to try and kill your pet. I just remember being excited for pets getting stat scaling in tbc because it was a big deal in arena
---
If we're theorycrafting then half-assed solutions that don't achieve all that much don't seem worth discussing to me.
---
I want to see for myself just how usefull Will of the forsakens can be
---
Oh, I figured he was a fire melee mage 
---
Why did you write a post then apologise for it and give a weird excuse?
---
Week one STV, when there aren't any Lv 60s yet.
---
I get what your saying, but it only takes one member to have raided during vanilla to explain the whole fight. 
---
It‚Äôs been 14ish years and I still remember every strategy from Onyxia to BWL to MC. 
---
&gt; If it is not a bug - it should stay in classic.
---
This is where it gets more philosophically interesting, because there exist grey areas when it comes to mechanics that clearly weren't intended, and they blur the line between what is a bug and what is a programing error.
---
My favorite example is Paladins' Seal of the Crusader.
---
SotC is supposed to be good for procing Weapon effects, Weapon Enchants (like Fiery), Trinket ‚Äúon hit‚Äù procs, and more JoL/JoW procs.
---
The reason being, is that it gives you an extra 40% swing speed while nerfing your swing damage by 40%‚Äîyou can definitely tell the devs wanted this to be ‚Äúthe proc stuff‚Äù Seal.
---
Seal of Righteousness, on the other hand, is supposed to be the ‚Äúdeal more damage with a fast 1-hander‚Äù Seal. It adds a fixed amount of Holy damage to every swing you do. This is in contrast to Seal of Command which adds the chance to deal 70% of your weapon damage as a Holy attack, making SoC the ‚Äúdeal more damage with a slow 2-hander‚Äù Seal.
---
The huge blunder came during 1.9 when they changed SoR from a *chance* to deal its fixed Holy damage, to 100% always deal on every swing. What no one seems to have noticed at the time is that under the hood, this extra Holy damage behaved mechanically as its own ‚Äúweapon swing.‚Äù 
---
This meant that SoR effectively doubled your chance to proc all the things that SotC was meant to proc 40% more.
---
Now, to be totally transparent, this was finally fixed in 2.1.0: ‚ÄúSeal of Righteousness: This seal will no longer cause additional chances for weapon procs to trigger.‚Äù
---
But I think it's interesting because it falls in the grey area between known bug and design oversight / programmer error. At what point do you keep something in that was never intended to be?
---
aCTuALlY
---
Well would ya look at that
---
Reason for writing post: keen for feedback
---
Apologise: unstructured thought process, badly formatted
---
Weird excuse: for the exact reason of the excuse
---
Hope this helps üëç
---
Sorry, but this post was removed because we don't allow streams of private server content (Rule #1).
---
did you Fraps it though?
---
I may be wrong, but I am pretty sure that camping level 20's as a level 60 doesn't "keep world pvp alive", it gets people to quit the game.
---
CD for essence transmute is 24 hours, arcanite is 48. They "share" a CD, as if you use one, the other gets put on CD as well. 
---
You do what you want either way, but this is a terrible way to generate gold. 
---
widescreen monitor? a PC good enough to do video capture? *IN 2005?!* 
---
whoever did this, I really envy their life.
---
05-06 newgrounds was the internet at peak performance 
---
They confirmed a "preliminary" roadmap at Blizzcon. It might change, it might not. But I highly doubt they'll change it completely to "no progressive content at all".
---
That argument always struck me as retarded. Within the logic of the universe, the mage spells are realistic, cause they follow the rules of totally normal magic. 
---
Within the logic of the universe, bows are supposed to obey the laws of physics. Since they clearly don't follow the laws of physics of the warcraft universe, they're unrealistic within the context of the warcraft universe.
---
No point playing a priest if you are not going to like healing
---
You can look at the success of FFXIV to attest to this.  It's a pure, unabashed WoW clone (at least of the Wrath era), designed basically like a My First MMORPG.  For anyone that's played WoW there's virtually no difficulty until Savage (hard mode) raids, and even then, they're at best like Normal (now called Heroic) raids in Mists.  And yet, even with the game being the Easy WoW, as I call it, it's incredibly popular.
---
Just look at Cataclysm.  The raids were ridiculously overtuned (though nothing like Classic Naxxramas), and so it's no surprise to me it's the least popular expansion.  The harder you make something, the more exclusive it becomes.  Exclusivity means shutting people out, and you don't want that in an MMORPG or at least not too much of it.
---
Sounds reasonable, although you don't need to be in prot spec to do dungeons, so it might be advantageous to be in a dps spec for solo content while you are still gearing up.
---
Even if you mainly dps in raids, off-tanks are needed on occasion, and those who make sure to be prepared for such events are appreciated. 
---
A reasonable guess is July 16. It would be a bit of an easter egg, but not unlike blizzard.
---
There's another grey area: features like guild banks.  They were slated for vanilla but the devs simply did not have time to implement them and still meet the ship date - and as any software dev knows, once you go into production, your ability to add new "nice to have" features gets significantly diminished.
---
Should features that were in the original vanilla design, but missed the ship date, be included too?  Are guild banks "game breaking?"
---
Personally, I believe any and all bugs should be fixed.
---
&gt; I love buffing random people because in classic buffs can make a difference. I love making people portals because the time they save is significant. And most of all, I love giving people water and bread.
---
Well you're in luck because your Mage rotation in Classic is going to be:
---
Conjure Water &gt; Conjure Water &gt; Conjure Food &gt; Conjure Food &gt; Arcane Intellect &gt; Frost Bolt.
---
unrelated but this reminds me of in T11 when I found out that if I held my Nightfall proc, my doomguard would start instantly firing off his doom bolts, outdamaging my character for the duration. 
---
i even ran some weird drain life proc-fishing spec and told nobody until...
---
Hotfix (2011-01-18):¬†While Nightfall is active, Doomguards will not instantly cast¬†Ôøº¬†Doom Bolt.¬†
---
:[
---
You kinda proved my point though. You're likely not going to turn away any decently played class (unless you're all 60, trying to gear up for raids, and have 2+ of that class already).
---
The only weapon a Hunter needs is pre-nerf Lupos
---
Yeah, but I'm excited to invite a mage to my 5 man group. I'll accept a hunter.
---
We're Hunters, we don't care about your feelings. :) 
---
Yeah looks like most people aren't familiar judging by the downvotes and comments, I got a good chuckle out of it

That's amazing then, I am definitely going to get it :). Thanks :D.

Curse of Weakness on low level Warriors and Rogues

lol just joust as a warrior and you'll be fine. if this is an issue for you then I'd recommend not rolling warrior.
---
Locking down redridge killing all lowbies in sight
---
Haha. Yeah, I know. :/
---
You def want an int set for dungeons. Not saying you buy a shit ton of stuff on AH, just keep drops with int on it. And already at 40ish level you can have some bonuses.
---
Ah, I see what you mean.  I was focusing on the "mana regen" part.  Then yeah, you'd be correct with Predatory Instinct, which was basically their Lethality talent that Rogues always had.
---
I reckon the worst part is that you have to cast it for 0.5 seconds!
---
What do you mean by the patience? What's wrong with it?
---
is that a spellpower rogue on the far left? the one wielding perditions blade? 
---
Hmmmm... Hopefully it'll work out haha.
---
Very very op. They're already so stupid in warsong
---
by girl do you mean ewe?
---
At the same time, cross-realm BGs are virtually necessary after what we've seen on private servers. Premade BGs with que dodgers will absolutely ruin PvP if we don't have cross-realm to keep the PvP activity high. It's unfortunate, and I wish it wasn't the case, but blizz either has to put in some other restriction on premade dodging (which they should even with crossrealm, since people will still do it, it will just be less damaging to the pvp community), or let the PvP slowly die as people dodge like crazy to push their rank 14 grind.
---
Yes, only race better would be Dwarf
---
He's providing sources to prove his point. You're like "lots of people of the internet think I'm right".
---
Yeah sure actually trying to refute his point would be "checking his homework".
---
I'll use that excuse the next time I don't wanna look at evidence, thanks.
---
Looks awesome! 
---
I use that for a lot of my 2H sword mogs for lower level characters
---
They're gonna miss one person if they start at 0 and end at n - 1.
---
    int[] people = {3, 6, 9, 12, 15};

    int peopleOutside = 5;
---
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; peopleOutside - 1; i++) {
---
        people[i].signCopy();
---
    }
---
So:
---
i @ 0: people[0] has signed copy, 1 &lt; 5 - 1, i --&gt; 1.
---
i @ 1: people[1] has signed copy, 2 &lt; 5 - 1, i --&gt; 2.
---
i @ 2: people[2] has signed copy,  3 &lt; 5 - 1, i --&gt; 3.
---
i @ 3: people[3] has signed copy, 4 !&lt; 5 - 1, i !-&gt; 4

---
Aaaw, look at that guy, nice! 
---
I agree with this entirely.  However, /camp was a real thing that was simply another command for /logout.  If I remember right, back then, logging out did take you back to the entrance of the instance if you were solo or every other party member had left the party.  I always assumed the game deleted your instance ID with no one online in the party and so it creates a new one for you upon logging in inside the dungeon.  Does /camp do something else on private servers?
---
Wait, you're telling me a mage in raid doesn't even have to deal damage, just make food and that's it? Sign me up\~ xD
---
All the people on my friends list were mages for water XD
---
Thank you op
---
LANs are something I feel bad that the younger folks never got to experience(or at least not as much). It really was the highlight of my teen years.
---
I remember going over to my friends house a few blocks away and carrying my PC the whole way. Then going back for my monitor LOL. We played all night and around 4 or 5am I got my second character(gnome warlock) to 60 by grinding for firewater in winterspring. Another time when I convinced my paladin friend to roll on dal rends main hand(he had no idea). Looking back I feel pretty bad about that one. I was a jerk. Various WC3 lans where maybe only one person had a legit copy of the game. Searching the internet for custom maps. From Dota, Elemental TD, Dark Deeds, random TD's, Hero Siege! 
---
Now that we are all in our late 20s I don't think I'll have that experience again. I hope I can put together a guild that has the same attitude about the game so that its as if we were all in the same room but over discord. 
---
Yep, I remember that, although in my experience it wasn't wellspread at all until towards the end of TBC, like about 2.3.  That's basically why they added Reset All Instances to the Player Menu later on.  And it'll definitely be there in WoW Classic.

Oh no. I meant i never went raided  far on pservers. The only thing i can prove to you is that i got rank 14. Look at my armoury. As for rest,  youll have to take word for it since my other mage when restored had the same problem my mainsake had - missing or corrupt data. Both were also naked. A gm told me super old accounts didnt port over correctly. Heck it says i never set foot in mc lol.  Again, theres a reason why i don't want to pvp or raid ever again. I burndt out for a reason. 
---
Now addressing that me not playing vanilla much is out of the way, i already agreed with you in another thread. Private servers have raised the bar obscenely high on average. There is no question your average player is better than your average vanilla player. 
---
But that's comparing apples to oranges. I vanilla you had the top x% that knew theorycraft etc. Vanilla also had a wider demographic. If compare the top x% to pservers they're wont be much difference. Speed running yes. Knowledge no. You'd have to kill me to do aq40 again for fun. 
---
Finally. I liken the private servers to figure out a formula given a finite set of variables.  Its like building a boat and bandaiding all the holes. And then you have bandaids on top of bandaids. 
---
And finally pservers dont know about mage aoe nerfs that happened pre 1.12. Did blizzard revert them 1.12?  I dont know. I stopped doing it.  My point being that there were tons of undocumented changes as well.
---
At the end of the day  we will agree to disagree. Im skeptical about private servers, you swear by them.   Im one of the few left who actually progression raided in vanilla and pvpd and wasnt age 16. But Lets not discount what the x% actually knew eh? Vanilla was a very easy game to figure out. 
---
Dranei could've easily been a Horde race, actually.
---
I believe that was really their only selling point after you got used to the rift system, although rifts were absolutely the most amazing thing in MMORPGs at the time.
---
Banding together to fight a higher level player whose ganking everyone was always fun. 
---
Tbh once you get past Molten Core and BRD fire is probably the preferred spec for mages. It's just the fire resist counteracts other possible specs. 
---
Fire is a pretty fun spec and you can definitely level very comfortably up to about 30ish with it (you can continue after that but at that point frost is just better for solo questing and grinding).
---
I've learned to kind of enjoy the monotonous rotation. It allows me to divert my focus less on what I'm doing and more on raid mechanics, positioning, and just enjoying the art in a dungeon, as well as the general vibe of mowing down bosses with 40 people.
---
Wait, are you playing on a private server rn?
---
I‚Äôve dabbled but I‚Äôm not going all guns until classic. I‚Äôm rolling either a Priest or a Paly. Unfortunately neither can be a gnome.
---
I just have my TV next to my computer .. watching and grinding at the same time ;)
---
No they won't. You don't need 40 after the 1.12 nerf due to classes. All the additional nerfs on top of that in Classic from Ion will simply break Tier 1 and 2. We will raid with 20 and sell carries for bad gear like mage tier 1. The less reputable guilds will pug people and exploit them with loot sharing while reserving.
---
**You are asking people to gear twice as slow in heavily nerfed content from 2004. It's not going to happen. Ion already broke WoW Classic before it launched.**
---
The additional nerfs are Itemization, spell batching landing instant heals, OP DM gear at launch that was better than BUFFED MC gear a lot of times. Also we will have an obscene amount of gold for consumables and wreck the economy from Diremaul jump runs/solo farming.
---
Enjoy. Hardcores will have about 6 months of fun then have a gigantic gear edge we never had in vanilla and you will all quit. I don't blame you. Until then we are going to streamroll you into the ground in a sabotaged classic so Ion and Brack can get you back on the Microtransaction gravy train and modern WoW, while they tell you that a vastly changed Classic is "no changes" and that they were right about rose tinted glasses.
---
When that happens never support this company again. See you on Nostalrius 2 with accurate boss armor values.
---
Shadowmeld eat/drink in the tallest bush you can find in STV.
---
Dueling is your best option.  Duel the same individual over and over and try to beat him.  This will make you learn, that instant cast that shamans have can interrupt my spells.  Look up what totems to kill, etc.  I spent days upon days dueling outside orgrimmar in classic.  You lose a bunch, but eventually you start to learn how to use your entire arsenal to kill individuals.
---
First main was NE Hunter but I will be rolling Human Male Mage on launch, not sure what I will name him yet 
---
The fact this post is downvoted shows just how manipulated this forum is from online marketing. Anyone who played WoW knows how nerfed this content is and that all guilds will be doing split runs until at least AQ due to Ion ruining Classic raids with all his changes.
---
I don't think you can define vanilla like that, sure it may mean that to you, but vanilla meant many things to many people. For me, vanilla was an experience. I remember having to spec innervate and I also remember using the black book and having my felguard solo people. For better or worse they were both part of the experience.
---
 More importantly vanilla was a struggle, your gear sucked, YouTube didn't exist, talents were a mess, nobody knew the fights, and world buff stacking wasn't a thing. 
---
With the power from 1.12, DM, world buff stacking, the game isn't going to feel like vanilla. As such I think they either need to do progressive patches or they need to rebalance the bosses to accommodate for these things. I want MC to feel like an epic battle not a Tuesday night chore at least not for awhile. That's vanilla for me.
---
Are we talking about end game here or random 5 man dungeons?  40 man elite guilds or casual guilds? There's a huge difference. You can basically play any spec you want in a 5 man dungeon. 
---
Elite guilds are looking for efficiency. They only want 1 shadow priest for shadow weaving debuff. Where as a more casual laid back guild will be a lot more accepting towards having multiple shadow priests in a raid. 
---
I'd say generally it's a lot easier for a healer/tank to find raiding guilds and do dungeons as the demand is way higher as the majority of the population is dps. 
---
Just play with what you like.
---
Don't forget that gnomes have a few advantages in PvP, as well. Escape Artist is definitely nothing to gawk at. Also in general, gnomes are small, so detecting/targeting can be harder, which is really really helpful for a glass cannon class. Couple that with the +5% int buff, and the fact that alliance (in my private server experience) has an easier time finding PvP queues, I think it's worth it to roll gnome.
---
Another thing to consider is if you wanted to play a paladin or a shaman down the line.
---
That's fair enough haha, do you think its worth it to go and see one to try out my class?
---
Eu &gt; Na 
---
Just because of this. There is nothing more statisfying that hearing and irishman and a bulgarian argue. Than have some germans starting to calm them down, but sounds like hes angry aswell. 
---
I loved the server community. We formed our guild right before BWL was released and everyone talked crap to us. But when we had the server first Nef kill shortly afterwards and I was the first on server with CTS and Bloodfang shoulders, I got multiple whispers saying congrats from people I never met.
---
It was an awesome feeling. We were literally racing another guild for Nefarian and we killed him 5 minutes after they wiped at 2%. 
---
Frost for me. It was the raid spec at the time but I also prefered the more defensive style in group pvp.
---
Druid. You go half into resto and balance. You don‚Äôt take swiftmend. 
---
a bit too early into the new patch with raid tier  
---
Fighting that big NPC that spawns in AV.
---
Wralock, maybe? Similar to a style you're used to (mage), but with the added bonus of being pretty strong in PvP, and you could probably solo a few instances easier than mages. 
---
Personally I have most experience on mage but I loved my experience with warlocks. Affliction is a really fun spec, and getting a free 60% mount would help with the time issue.
---
And the subsequent 100 times.
---
My main in Vanilla was a female, undead mage named Tundral. 
---
My main in Classic will be a male, troll warrior.
---
found this https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/579313
---
Definitely, look to Reddit and YouTube for how to set it up. There‚Äôs an auto lv60 one that‚Äôs handy.
---
I remember a time, while I was fire specced, I was clashing with a warrior in open pvp a few times and one times he attacked me in his molten core fire res gear. He did less damage but also took significantly less.

(... only slightly /s)
---
Cos in TBC you can roll Horde.
---
My first toon was a bald human mage. I quickly regretted not giving him hair (despite thinking it looked cool on the character creation screen) and searched the auction house for a head piece to cover it with. Dismayed that the first available headpiece wasn't until the mid lvl 20s I abandoned that toon at lvl 18 and started a female night elf rogue. She would never make it past level 32 because I spent all my time ganking horde in Hillsbrad Foothills.
---
I swear I‚Äôd play a pixel wow, it‚Äôd be like tibia basically lol
---
He said he is a casual that will barely raid if at all. Ret Paladins are tied as the best melee class in PvP blues and a Arcanite Reaper/AV Hammer. Enhance will be better before that due to all the hunter gear in DM that is "enhance" gear. 
---
Raiding? Yeah no one wants you. They are fine in PvP. They have burst and utility. Most ret paladins are bad and never use their utility. If you want to just be "dps" in a BG play an enhance Shaman. You can play selfishly and not hurt the entire team.
---
Both are "good" though in mediocre gear. Ret is better in wpvp and 1 v 1's and enhance is better just running around a BG.  
---
It's all about time. Early on isn't worth clearing it with 20 people because you are undergeared which means it takes more time and a higher chance to wipe. And by the time you geared enough to do 20 man MC's your whole party is probably geared to the teeth. Most of your core members do not need gear and they are attending for raid attendance, gearing alts and bindings. 
---
I think they added pallys to horde and shamans to alliance in TBC because they couldn't find a way to balance the factions in PVE with such vastly different classes and that was the easiest solution. 
---
Mage is probably overall the best class in the game. 
---
You know that guy who is just good at everything and even excels at a couple particular things?  He‚Äôs the mage if real life. 
---
Healers are always in demand. Check out the picking your class google doc in the OP of this thread. Might help you with your healer split decision. 
---
Paladins are a bit pigeon holed in their roles, whereas priests can do MT healing or group healing. Shamans are fantastic group healers. Druids are good all arounders but take a surprising amount of time to master the playstyle of mixing ranks.
---
Paladins have the added bonus though of being pretty flexible in their roles. You can have ret sets and be a holyret PvP pala, swing your bigass sword around and shit, and your armor and HP is higher than everyone else. 
---
So in conclusion, I recommend reading the doc and trying an instant 60 server to get a feel for what you prefer. 
---
I played a Draenai hunter on a TBC private server. Then later on in retail I played a night elf hunter, human mage and night elf druid untill MOP/WOD.
---
For Classic I will be going for either dwarf priest or paladin. Still have 6+ months to decide probably ;)
---
I am one of those people who leveled around 30 chars to 20 before I ever chose a main. I‚Äôm obsessed with picking new classes and races. Might be my biggest flaw as a wow player. First true main was a gnome warlock ‚ÄòNomie‚Äô on Eredar. I‚Äôm only learning now that it was probably my main because of how easy leveling warlocks was in classic... but I do love the warlock and have had it as my main ever since.
---
As they brought in char, realm, faction transfers I have probably played as every possible combination of warlock on 3-4 different realms.  One thing remains. All of my pet names are still the exact same as when I got them at lvl 4, 10, 20, and 30 in vanilla. Makes me very nostalgic. I‚Äôm down to do it all again.
---
When WoW came out I leveled just about every single class to barrens level.  Then promptly quit the game since nothing really clicked.  I started back up a couple months later and the only two classes I hadn't tried was Warlock and Priest.  I mained Warlock and leveled him all the way to 60, it was a blast.  I love playing him, PvE and PvP he was dynamic and powerful.  I knew I made the right decision, until I started raiding.  I met some guild friends who PvP'd a lot and would sit out front of Orgrimmar and duel a lot.  My Priest friend who was really good was unbeatable dueling as a healer.  I can still remember him shielding, DoTs, and then wacking them over the head with his benediction.  Even some of the best rogues couldn't beat him (rubberducky comes to mind).  Then watching him heal in premades and raids I knew I fucked up.  I should've rolled a priest.  He was beast in solo pvp, beast in group pvp, important AF in raids.  It inspired me to play healers from then on, turns out I was a pretty beast ass healer.  I raided with &lt;Redux&gt; Spirestone and we were top 50 US at one time (actually #1 guild with only a 12 hour raid week).  This time around I'm rolling priest and its going to be glorious.  Although I much preferred the play style/talents before they redid the priest talents.
---
Your attention span seems impeccable.
---
That's what a lot of people do. You can make a surprising amount of money from DEing shit high level greens. Just get your char to level 5 and you can disenchant literally everything.
---
Gnome warriors are an underrated choice. Humans have the fantastic racial weapon skill bonus but if you're nice and good at the game no one will mind :)

Can you link this build?

Whelp, I'm convinced

Wand. Or Siphon Life.

This might depend on "wall jumping" capability, but fighting people off the roof of the Gadgetzen Inn. Or if I decide to main a mage again, be the one getting chased off the roof of the Gadgetzen Inn. Overall fighting on the outskirts of Gadgetzen felt really good, like an extended bar fight that spills out into the streets. 
---
If cross realm bgs are in i just won‚Äôt bg. There is no community. You can yell and scream and say whatever you want because just like lfg/lfr you will never see those players again. 
---
Just admit it. **You are** **a PVE server player on Alliance, since you mentioned AV. Also you are 100 percent exposed as a liar now. Horde was always the faction with less players and never had a queue in AV in PVP servers.** It's why Horde almost won BG's btw. We were PVP focused players who wanted an actual challenge with numbers. 
---
This was a Alliance specific problem, especially on PVE servers. The reason was all the PVE related gear in AV and because Alliance had a much easier time raiding due to blessing of salvation. Alliance Horde populations on PVE servers were a joke. 
---
You chose to roll a PVE server. The modern game is all raiding and PVE. Go play it. Stop trying to ruin the old game. I guarantee most PVP players will abandon Classic for private servers if Blizzard caters to you. **We don't want to play with you.** 
---
If Blizzard does this have fun going bankrupt. We have the boss values now. We are not going to play a broken, ruined classic due to streamers and carebears. You have a game. It's called BFA. YOU created it. Play it and support the game and company you helped ruin or watch them fold.

The biggest advantage you get out of tailoring is probably the Bloodvine set, and the Robe of the Archmage. Both are great pieces, but pre-BiS, and will be replaced with later content. 
---
It does help to have tailoring to have easy access to great gear as you level up, and you can always grind and sell for profitable patterns.
---
Tailoring is not very lucrative, but engineering is even less so IMO, and quite expensive. But, there are obviously great rewards to engineering and it's a fun profession. I think engineering and mining is a good combo for you. Mages and warlocks are pretty great at grinding as it is, so that will probably be your primary source of income until you get enough gold to play the AH.
---
The glorious Paladin has always been my main, too. Love that glowing ‚Äúbanana‚Äù armor :)
---
Bless you, just mentioned how Horde needs more Troll Warriors this time around.  Weren't nearly enough in classic, especially them tanks that had a sweet spin move animation
---
I'm all for World PvP, but more generally I appreciate a PvP server environment that includes players working together and communicating. Even if that means communicating danger areas. It's like a fantasy character getting a warning about "Watch for the bandits on the southern road, they've been bold lately!" Then again I may just be a very specific and weird kind of nerd. 
---
Actually im looking forward to it.
---
No chinese farmers that grind everything. 
---
When you get up to an ungodly hour the chances of other freaks like you are significant smaller.
---
My first toon was a Dwarf Priest. :) My friends talked me into leveling one because they were having trouble with Onyxia and needed Fear Ward. My one friend was very convincing telling me how powerful I would be in Shadow Form in PvP. I just went with it and enjoyed it. I had no clue what I was doing, but fortunately I met a lot of nice people along the way that gave me tips. Eventually I got the leveling up to a science. Pull with mind blast, use shadow word pain while back peddling, use mind flay over and over until they came, then wand. Apparently I was so efficient someone was watching me and then whispered they reporting me for botting. I was so scared and I did not want to lose my account! I messaged a GM explaining what happened and they told me not to worry and that I was okay.
---
I also was on a PvP server and this may sound mean but one of my favorite things to do was kill a horde who was mining and then steal their mining node. Lol!
---
Grouping up as a 40 man raid, zerging BRM to zone in to a raid.  Then camping any alliance players we find until the entire guild is ready to zone in
---
I play ally mostly but went horde on my most recent pserver and ohh man are the differences apparent. I can‚Äôt wait to be ally again in classic. As alliance anytime you passed someone who could buff you got buffed. You didn‚Äôt ask it just happened. On horde no one does that. At least it‚Äôs very rare. Horde seems to be more of a whats in it for me kinda thing. I know alliance has bad players too but the community on horde side just seems to be so much worse than alliance. 
---
She's probably a twink.
---
Lol yeah... 14 year old me was not exactly a dedicated player. I never made it to 60 before TBC despite playing the entire lifespan of vanilla.
---
Apart from everything I've written about [here](https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;t=903), probably summoning the fuck out of everyone in Trade chat in a city like Stormwind and letting the chaos unfold. 
---
Not just the Gingermen, but the Gingerwomen and Gingerchildren too
---
It's a sheep. He's making a bestiality joke for some reason. 
---
Maybe consider Tauren? Get called a Kungen wannabe all the time lol, but I think it helps if you want the hulking warrior kind of vibe. Warriors on the horde side are all badass choices.
---
Ouch, would've been better not to know, then...
---
Uh... Can YOU read? They have the leaked player subscription data, which says 1.7M subs. They have their weakauras use data. They combined those two together to realize about half the player base uses weakauras. They weren't backing into the original leaked data by guessing their use ratio.
---
[First part seemed fitting.](https://youtu.be/Oz0ClMzhkAk)

Yesssss, I‚Äôve played through this so many times. My go to when I couldn‚Äôt play WoW.

That's... really interesting. I've never seen/heard of that happening, lol.

Not everyone will have played vanilla recently. The vast majority, imo of course, will not have played pservers. There will be those who did and it will be apparent. There will be a ton who take their time and have no idea what they are doing. I know people on pservers who never played vanilla before. Just because someone played on a pserver doesn‚Äôt mean they know what they are doing.
---
so, yes.  Ewe

Why would they release it at the end of summer. Bunch of people have total free time around that time (kids, students...) so they would miss out on opportunity.
---
&gt; At what point do you keep something in that was never intended
---
If it was not working as intended, i think it is safe to treat it like any other bug.
---
As opposed to a content creator with a monetized channel that pretends he is not unbiased? Give me a break.
---
One makes easy money due to imbalance done on purpose. Example. Limit just spent 9000 US to compete in PVE against other top guilds in the new raid due to faction changes. 
---
The other is a real MMO without MT's to ruin the game. 
---
Kotick and Activision is when MT's came to WoW champ.

same reason they released last 2 expansions at that time?

Back to actually using the friends list
---
Filthy alliance scum

Fair enough, that makes sense.
---
Blackout proc'ing with shadowguard
---
Okay, I have it down to three classes: warlock, shaman, or warrior.
---
I have most experience with a mage, and some experience with a warlock. I don't want to tank, but I'd be willing to heal because the shaman playstyle seems really attractive to me. 
---
Warlock pros are that I have the most experience with it, I'd be able to comfortably find a group, I enjoy affliction, leveling would be a breeze, and a free mount isn't something to gloss over. Cons are that I kind of want a new, fresh experience, and I've already had a few higher level warlocks (played one a 70 on a TBC private server). 
---
Shaman pros are leveling isn't too hard, finding a group as a healer is pretty easy, and it's just a really different/intriguing playstyle compared to what I'm used to. Cons are that I'd have to heal at high level raiding, and while I think it'd be fun for the shaman, I've just never healed in all of my WoW experience, and don't really see myself as a healer.
---
Warrior pros are that it's really different, I like the armor style, and tanking while leveling would be an interesting experience. Cons are that leveling a warrior is a bitch and maining one is even harder. As someone who typically is a little strapped for gold, I'm not sure how I'd grind, since I'm used to mage packfarming. 
---
I think I'm leaning towards warrior, but really just afraid to call it. I really want to do a 2H Fury build, and swing a bigass axe around with juicy windfury procs. Thinking about Tauren, just so I can be a shaman later on if I want to.
---
Thoughts?
---
My main all the way through Vanilla up to and including WoD was a Tauren Warrior, he took a break in Legion as I didn't really like Warriors in that expansion, but I returned to him for the sole month I played BfA.
---
For Classic I'll be rolling a Troll Mage though, I do have a shit ton of memories with my Tauren Warrior, but from playing on private servers I've fallen in love with Mages, and my brother is already rolling a Warrior too, so I don't really want to step on his toes.
---
Pallys are just as fast if not faster than mages at dme. You can kill 2 packs at a time and hit lockout in 20 minutes. 
---
Horde are ugly 
---
You know what they say.. don't reinvent the wheel. Ret for sure. 
---
There are plenty of great specs for paladin but the problem is you can't access them until you are pushing level 52 which kinda defeats the purpose. 
---
The best two skills out of the prot tree (Reckoning and Holyshield) is all the way at the end. 
---
Holy paladins won't get Holy shock until level 42 at the soonest. Basically mind numbing SoR + Aoe grinding. 
---
[33/0/16 ](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sExu0gotZxf0t) seems like a great gimmick but is going down the whole holy tree for Holy Shock really worth it? Nah. 
---
21/0/30 or 20/0/31 is a staple build for a reason. 
---
If you wanna be fancy I'd put in 16 into ret and then work your down the holy tree for Illumination/Divine Favor and then back into the Ret tree. 
---
Hahaha thank you for the advice 
---
&gt; Classic is Vanilla. Should be Vanilla. Not Vanilla+ ("changed for your pleasure" :P). It's a historic artifact being brought back into existence (as best as Blizzard can do that, of course).
---
Classic had tons of changes to class balance. Classic isn't just 1.12. Classic was 1.0 until TBC. Tons of balance happened in between then.
---
Retail. Undead rogue main. 
---
Classic. Undead rogue and Tauren Ele Shaman. I'm just bored of mages which has always been my main alt. Orc rogue is better but I am not playing that model without tmorph and intjection no longer works in the new client. 
---
FYI, there is an 8-bit version of Molten Core that was made after Blizzard made an April Fools joke.

---
I feel like this sub would love it. 
---
You really hit it on the head regarding the monotonous rotations. With less emphasis on nailing perfect timing of all your dps abilities, you're in a better position to sit back and actually take in everything that is happening and watch what people around you are doing. When raiding a bit on live it really felt like I was playing the game alone since I was so tunnel focused on my own set of abilities and cool downs that I didn't have the opportunity to look up and see the bigger picture.
---
I grinded a character on retail to GM during 1.12 and from what I remember you weren't able to buy the items once you deranked. The GM weapons were expensive too so I could barely afford every single weapon. 
---
I forgot Tauren could be Shamans in vanilla. Guess I just didn‚Äôt see many running around.
---
Okay you do you, then.
---
Too many people confuse the "true vanilla experience" with just being a stupid 13 year old who didn't seek out any information on the forums. 
---
Corpse running from Redridge, Southshore, and Menethil because horde were killing innocents long before Darnassus.
---
i actually played this xd
---
I have a question, other discussion in here said going 1 hand and shield is still good for pvp, but I see you had points in 2 hand specialization. What would be the point of a 1 hand and shield in this case? Tanking dungeons? In that case would it not make more sense to pvp with 2 hand and keep 1 hand and shield in bag?
---
All day AV's basically stopped happening after the major AV overhaul. 
---
Old AV had tons of NPC everywhere so it was nearly impossible to by pass them. You seriously had to push as a group to take a flag. Then the revamp came out where they removed most of the NPC's and changed the flag location and opened up path ways. 
---
Yeah loved grouping at grom Gol base camp and flying to thorium point as a raid. Being a massive train of death killing all the alliance on the way in until you ran into another raid. Then it turns into let‚Äôs do MC tomorrow 
---
I just played a mage and hunter to 20 on pservers. Mage first, very fun and blink is awesome. 
---
Then I played hunter and realized that I think I like it more. The average fight just takes so many more buttons. Hunters mark &gt; Pet attack &gt; auto shot &gt; serpent sting &gt; arcane shot &gt; cast growl from pet to maintain aggro.
---
Mage was a close second but I just dont want to make water for everyone even though it's highly valuable and feels useful. 
---
Thats disrespectful to your Orcish mother
---
My very very first "main" was a BE warlock, but only got him to about level 14 or so. My first "high-ish" level was a Tauren hunter named Barvil. I was probably like 10 or 11 years old at the time. I was a super annoying noob. I remember there was this one guy that I had on my friends list and we kinda chatted but for the most part I'd just whisper him random shit and he'd just politely acknowledge me, lol. Not sure why he didn't put me on ignore, but he didn't.
---
The funniest memory from that was that there are a pair of rocks in STV near the arena that look like boobs. I called them boob rocks, and let everyone within yelling distance, general chat, people walking by, and that guy I was whispering that I discovered the boob rocks. Realistically they were just two adjacent protruding mounds.
---
Ah, Barvil. 
---
I had most of my "main" raiding, PvP, grinding, etc. experience with a human mage named Falicity on Drenden, in late TBC and through WotLK. But Barvil was the source of my true early WoW memories.
---
So in theory, this is a true hybrid build that can tank, heal, and dps/pvp?
---
I don't recall whether you can change group compositions in combat.
---
Neat, I don't think that worked on pservers and I don't recall from vanilla live.  I was confusing the troll boss loot with the orc lock, I was specifically thinking of the voodoo mask which I knew didn't drop from the human.  Thanks for explaining!
---
&gt; Does it get harder past 10 for regular questing?
---
Yes.  The trick with warriors is you need to get ahead of the curve with your quests.  Try to always be killing mobs 2-3 levels lower than you are.  Killing equal or higher level mobs is hard for a long time unless you're being fed gear by a main.
---
&gt; Will I be able to win in WPVP while leveling?
---
Once you get into the 30s, and particularly if you get the Whirlwind weapon early, you can really take advantage of some classes.  Different classes become powerful in PvP at different times, so it will be touch and go.  Also, as always, warriors are gear dependent.
---
You gotta play the strangletheon fever expansion
---
It's current rank. Not highest historically. 
---
You definitely could in vanilla, they might have changed it in a later expansion. I remember the interface being very clunky/buggy though, so you would have someone not too busy like a ranged dps officer or a dead officer make the switch and not your main tank
---
My very first toon, and the one I mained throughout my WoW career, was Zonzede, Dwarf Paladin. 
---
Since I wanted to play Ret and not pay 50g every time I wanted to do so, I leveled Zonzedette, Female dwarf Paladin. 
---
Then I decided to play other classes. Enter Zonzephyr the Rogue. Zonxena the Warrior. Zonzelda, Priest. Zonbonjovi, a Hunter featuring Zonzilla as his raptor pet. Deathknights being added gave me Zonzedead. Before I quit in Cataclysm, I created Zonzeus the Shaman, Zonzaftig the Mage, and Zonzuul the Warlock. When I resubbed for a month during Pandaria, Zonzen the Monk was born. 
---
I have a theme. Since I terribly miss vanilla Paladin, I'll likely be rolling up Zonzedette again, for the epic braid physics.
---
No, I don't feel that way at all. What I like about horde is the disparity between the member races. Tauren fit in the horde and Blood Elves fit in the horde, but that doesn't mean that they're similar or cohesive. 'They're alike, so they should be on the same side' is something that applies to the Alliance. What's appealing about the horde is that you have two races as totally unalike and culturally, morally, and historically unaligned as the undead and tauren. Just understanding each other on a fundamental level is a challenge, yet they have to work and fight together. There's conflict and tension, which is interesting. And Blood Elves fit well into that dynamic. Visuals are important, absolutely, but I don't think having one elf race ruins the horde's visual theme? It's like the smurfs having one female smurf, ahaha. If you put the blood elves next to the humans, dwarves, etc, you'd think they're just another high fantasy elf race, but next to orcs, minotaurs, undead, etc, you think "oh, these are the 'bad' elves, aren't they?"
---
I like the "uglies", too, by the way. I don't mind looking at the blood elves but my go-to for my characters are tauren and undead female.
---
I love killing horde as a gnome. They get so upset.
---
I think most people here are too old to be twinks anymore.
---
These claims of 30 minute clears speak directly against my personal experience playing WoW during Vanilla.  With the guild in mostly T2 we had MC cleared in 3 hours.
---
I can't imagine people in BiS clearing the zone in 30 minutes, or a group of 20 BiS clearing the instance at all. 
---
Granted i didn't progress through MC during the 1.12 patch, but the content was challenging and the guild only got faster/better due to a mixture of gear upgrades and practice.
---
My first character was a Male Tauren Hunter who reached level 40 before I joined another server to play with friends where my main was a Female Tauren Resto Shaman and I'll be rerolling that same character when Classic comes.
---
cs=cold snap? Why are you using a 10 minute cooldown right there? The only spell it would reset is frost nova, and you don't even use it again.
---
I was just saying how I never really saw Tauren shaman in my server. I also very rarely saw Female Tauren, so you might have the most unique idea lol.
---
I played a hunter back in actual vanilla i think it was on a pve server. Used to go to starting zones and tame some low level boar and name it something like Bloodsnout or just whatever the boars there were called. Used eyes of the beast and walk it around the area so lowbies hit it and they get flagged then I ran in and slapped em. Either that or using Dartol‚Äôs Rod in lower level furbolg camps and walking around until someone mindlessly questing hits ya and do the same thing.
---
Lmao love the names. Does it mean something to you or was it all from the ole RANDOMIZE button? 
---
Yeah, and this is the biggest reason why TBC sucks ass. Adding shammies and pallys to the other faction completely wrecked the faction balance (TBC being extremely horde favored) and made factions generally less unique, especally how they played in raid.
---
Blizz should never have added the classes to both factions, and instead tried to keep the factions more unique. Everything went to shit the moment they decided to add a shared capital, tiny continent, portals to everywhere and flying.
---
Keep it classic, keep it RPG. Balance is not the most important factor of RPG games, I don't give a shit about world first races or PvP rank leaderboards. Just fucking keep the game like any other RPG as much as possible with exploration aspects and unique characters and factions. 
---
If I see a Tauren warrior staring at the boob rocks I‚Äôll know who it is
---
I tried that on the pserver recently and it didn't work
---
Doomsday clock to no life inc.
---
What makes you think that WoW bows aren't supposed to use magic?
---
Yeah, maybe I'll name him Barvil too.. in memory of my old toon :) 
---
&gt; These claims of 30 minute clears speak directly against my personal experience playing WoW during Vanilla. With the guild in mostly T2 we had MC cleared in 3 hours.
---
Mate honestly?
---
What do you think 14 years has done for peoples knowledge of the game?
---
I'm on my first private server and we do MC/BWL in about 3 hours total.
---
We also get ZG buff, DM Tribute buffs and Onyxia buffs.  Then people are individually buffed as much as possible eg Spirit of Zanza and all consumables
---
It's easily achievable, don't be so naive to think your vanilla experience is anything close to private servers.
---
As I said, I'm on my first pvt server and upon hitting 60 I received a massive culture shock:
---
1.  very few warriors willing to tank, they're all in leather to do max dps.
---
2. People running UBRS upto Rend with items like Truestrike shoulders on reserve.
---
3.  Lava runs done hundreds of times until Ironfoe drops.
---
So yeah - full T2 doesn't cut it these days, not when every single person knows what true BIS is and will run instances endlessly to min-max
---
Elemental shamans were way better though 
---
Please explain how TBC was extremely horde favored.  
---
Shadowmeld isn't very good at avoiding gankers. You have to see them coming before they see you, not be in combat, and activate it. Then hold still and hope they don't get close enough to detect you, which they can do from a mile away cause shadowmeld has a shitty stealth level. In practice it almost never works out. I only ever got shadowmeld to work offensively for ambushes.
---
#snap
---
Blizz makes some for Enh Shamans.
---
You said druids are the worst healers and that you want one for mark and thats it. I disagree. 
---
I'd have to log on it again. Wasn't fast though, a bit under 3 days I believe. It was two years ago. 
---
It does NOW. but it didn't in vanilla. You can't shadowmeld in combat until a much much later patch, I think in WOLK.
---
Blanket counterspell I think they mean. Can't cast while afflicted with CS
---
Wow, you're probably the first person I've heard who isn't a fan of TBC.
---
Adding pallies and shamans on the other faction was controversial but honestly, it wasn't too big of a deal I feel. To me, the addition of Blood Elves and Draenei as playable races was weird, as belves was added to the horde largely because they needed a "pretty" race. The lore didn't really add up.
---
That's highly respectable. I mean it.
---
However, you can't release an "experience". There is no going back into the past. To be flippant, why don't you play Dark Souls if you want a "hard experience"? I hope you see the point.
---
*Especially* because "Vanilla" can mean so many things to so many people, there is absolutely no way to satisfy all of them, even if Blizzard tried to create an "experience".
---
But that's not what they are doing. The only sane thing to do is to bring back the *game*, as best as it can be. Of course even that can an be nit-picked to death but there is a quite clear reference. They have the original 1.12 client and server. Classic should work like that. They have said they will do just that. This is the best thing which can be done. As I said Vanilla was a historical game. It's important to be available to be played by anyone.
---
If it'll be easy for you, well, that's that then. It's to be expected.
---
That makes more sense. Thank you. 
---
I also get a chub when they try to vanish after rend
---
Lmao yo true
---
They have generally better racials for both PvP and PvE. Orc are extremly strong in perticular with their atk power bonus AND pet damage (which is really important in TBC). Tauren are the best tanks still, Troll's are good. Belfs have their free mana/silence and superior ret pallys.
---
Alliance have some good ones too, but its still horde favored.
---
And again, Outland is a tiny miniscule continent that doesn't work well with two factions, its simply too fucking small and everyone is crumpled up so you get servers which are either horde favored, or a few ones that are alliance favored. It just doesn't work that well with 50/50 populations, which works in vanilla btw.
---
Just take a look at any TBC private server, they are always horde favored, and some even force you to roll alliance to keep it like 60/40, otherwise it could be even worse.
---
No, because lots of the trash pulls are only 2 mobs.
---
Horde racials are better.  
---
First true Main was a Blood Elf Hunter who I played from early WotLK until WoD. Though my first character I put a lot of time into was a Gnome Mage who only made it to level 42 or so in Classic. I plan to be a Gnome Mage and finally do right by that character I leveled so inefficiently and abandoned all those years ago.
---
I started in 1.10 at the age of... 12 I believe. Didn‚Äôt hit cap until a few weeks into WotLK, so I‚Äôm really looking forward to starting fresh and enjoying all the things I wasn‚Äôt able to 13 years ago
---
Eh, I agree with a less inflammatory version of what he's saying, and am still a huge TBC fan. TBC killed a lot of stuff that was good about vanilla, but it also delivered the best version of class mechanics, raid mechanics, and itemization that the game has ever seen imo. So he's not wrong, but man what was good about TBC was so good.
---
It ruins the horde theme in TBC absolutely. On TBC servers you often have 50% belfs, 30% undead and 20% rest.
---
I really like the PvE aspect and structure of TBC, but I am not a fan of the "world" aka outland, and lots of other  shit they added in TBC.
---
I don't care about arenas either, but for PvE content TBC is probably a 10/10. But for the rest of the game I like it less than vanilla.
---
Still easily the second best version of WoW tho, as I despise wrath even more.
---
The good ‚Äòold days. Thottbot was a blessing and a curse, while wowhead is a lot easier, always will have fond memories. 
---
Searing point is going on lockdown the moment a warlock, priest and warrior hit 60. Better go Quest in Kalimdor. How fun!
---
Here you go, this would be a few extra points in prot to get improved RF and be a more effective tank.  Otherwise it's the same as I described. 
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sqLudxoZVGzIcdx
---
You could tweak some points here or there depending.. Like if you are purely PVE, forget about the improved hammer of justice cooldown and go into toughness for more armor or anticipation for defense.  Personally I prefer toughness over anticipation. 
---
Holy tree has some choices too.. I only do 4/5 spiritual focus, because with improved conc aura 2/3 you still have 100% pushback immune when you have conc aura active, so you can spend the extra points elsewhere for a slight bonus.  Personally I also like the lay on hands talent rather than the stun/fear resist but it comes down to preference.  
---
But with improved RF and the shield bonus talents, you will be able to tank pretty well but missing holy shield is a little rough.  If you want, just go to full 20/31/0 which is basically the same build take away divine favor and a few filler talents in holy, and add in to prot to get up to 31. 
---
&gt; biggest reason why TBC sucks ass
---
TBC was the absolute best.  Karazhan, Black Temple, heroic dungeons, arenas, interesting zones, and making hybrids viable in PVP/PVE were all great.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ajddkk/is_there_a_viable_hybrid_healer_someone_who_can/eexo7wh/
---
reckoning wasnt intended to be used as turning off your auto attack on someone and store crits and unleash it all at once. it got nerfed from infinite stacks to 4 but still it was not intended to be used like that in the first place but blizzard kept it in the game
---
Just because Vanilla was patched, absolutely doesn't mean that it can be changed further. It would cease to be Vanilla then.
---
Blizzard can pick and choose from 1.0 to 1.12. They chose 1.12, for two main reasons. The first is that they don't have anything else. :) They only have the 1.12 data. (To be complete, there were hints that they have a little more but little peaces from other patches are not useful.) The second is that they felt that 1.12 is the best version of Vanilla. It's their game, they get to choose.
---
Classic is not a new game. It's something that was. Making it "better' is not the goal.
---
I feel like you played a different game than I did in TBC.  You're not wrong about the racials, but Outland is not a "miniscule" continent.  Sure TBC was the beginning of the end, but it was  still a solid expansion.
---
Also the paladin seal that horde got v the alliance was better too I believe. small but still something.
---
I remember just searching for items so I could track down the drop mobs and farm them for auction. Was good stuff. 
---
I understand what you're trying to get at, but at some point you have to think of game health. The existence of bloodlust was a huge factor in TBC raid groups. While you and many others may not care about the sport of it, leaving shaman as a Horde exclusive would affect faction balance. If you were a raider, it would be silly not to be Horde.
---
Having the same classes on both factions doesn't make it less of an RPG. If you really want elements you should be able to choose a faction, with more than two options, as any race.
---
More importantly wrt guild banks, Blizzard has become far more hardcore about cracking down on account sharing than they were during vanilla live. That's going to be a problem in a game that doesn't provide an in-game way to have a shared guild bank without account sharing.
---
Racials.
---
Every bc pserver end up with 80% horde because of that unless they do thing like giving free epic flying mount to alliance and even then its sometimes not enough.
---
DPS is iffy- you will not be able to DPS in pve because a huge part of your damage potential comes from reckoning.  But yeah, PVP is fine you are a heals/support class with damage potential if you get great gear.  
---
But yeah tank is very doable with gear, same as heals. 
---
Begone thottbot! Actually wait, come back, we love you!
---
I‚Äôd happily pay double if the game ditched it‚Äôs microtransactions and moved back to quality releases and an emphasis on fun and epic feeling. 
---
I gotcha. To me TBC was overall better than vanilla due to the classes becoming less restricted. Paladins in TBC were not only healbots but we're also able to tank efficiently, for example.
---
I do agree on the RPG aspect though. That has only been watered down since vanilla.
---
I think this is well said. Not everyone will and should have the same keybindings... there‚Äôs no one answer as to what the best binds are. You should bind your keys based on your personal preference. OP mentioned he plays shooters at a high level. So do I. That‚Äôs the reason why I would never unbind my s key. Back pedaling and keyboard turning are bad. But a tiny back pedal when you hit the s key for a split second can make the difference from being out of los or not, just like a shooter. Personally I don‚Äôt mess with w,a,s,d as those are core movement keys for almost every pc game that have been around forever. However, I highly recommend rebinding q and e as you don‚Äôt need those buttons to strafe if you use your mouse correctly. Really just boils down to personal preference. Then rebind all the keys you use in a shooter like f,g,r,z,x, etc. I can‚Äôt imagine having rank 1 frostbolt bound to the mouse wheel... that‚Äôs so excessive lmao.
---
&gt; Classic is not a new game. It's something that was. Making it "better' is not the goal.
---
I'm saying there is an entire range of class balances they can do and have it still be true to classic WoW.
---
Don‚Äôt have to remember shit, just go on a private server and play it!
---
My first ever character was a undead Mage called Nightburn (I know, very edgy) created about a week after Vanilla EU launch. I stopped playing about 4 months later, he was around lvl 50.
---
In Classic I will main a Warrior because I very like the Fury playstyle and you can get in groups really fast as a tank.And a hunter alt ofc for farming.
---
My first main toon was a night elf hunter named Furioso. I remember I copied the name from a player I saw while watching a friend play Anarchy Online, which ended with me being asked multiple times a day if I was Portuguese, or just being whispered in portuguese, which I dont speak.
---
Synergy was optimal in TBC, i hated the combination of buffs. Broke my heart when Might and Battleshout and Str of earth totem no longer stacked.
---
It was a fantastic way to learn about various items in the game and was sort of the early version of simulation crafting that is everywhere today. There was another site I believe that existed around this time, but can‚Äôt recall it right now. 
---
Long story short I learned a lot about items and questing from this site. Probably spend untold hours during early WoW on there. 
---
"Hey check this out! Thottbot says there's a 50% chance for this blue item to drop off the elite stegosaurids in Un'goro!"
---
What class/spec can beat SL Lock in 1v1's? 
---
Hey, we already have one on Discord, [it works perfectly.](http://prntscr.com/mc456l) 
---
&gt;I feel like you played a different game than I did in TBC. You're not wrong about the racials, but Outland is not a "miniscule" continent.
---
It is when people get flying
---
Oh of course they're supposed to use magic. For all sorts of things, strengthening or making more springy the material they're made from, making them easier or harder to draw, going faster, arrows on fire, all sorts of things.
---
That doesn't change that they still have to be shaped like a bow to function like a bow. The thing has to have some sort of tension on the string going forwards, and if you make it the wrong shape all the magic in the world isn't going to make it work.
---
Except I suppose it could \*\*not be a fucking bow\*\* and just telekinesis the arrow away. But if that's the explanation you want to go with, that means there's literally no reason to have an actual bow involved, ever. You just take your "make arrows go fast thingy", probably shaped like a fucking wand, and point it at the arrows you want to "shoot".
---
Idk, they coulda maybe gone for a different race to give the Horde, but bloodelves fit the best canonically. The lore does add up, or am I missing something massive? Their #1 GOAT bloodelf Kael'Thas pretty unequivocally aligned himself against the Alliance after they betrayed him. In the classic WoW maps, Silvermoon also borders plaguelands territory, and so they have mutual interest w/ the Forsaken as well. Not sure what lore doesn't fit
---
As a proud representative of Eastern Europe, this is what I was playing back at home while dreaming about affording retail. 
---
I too would like the class balance to be mixed up every few months.  In vanilla Blizzard instituted a series of semi-informed attempts to balance the classes. It was inevitably the players who figured out the new optimal play styles and things never ended up working exactly as Blizzard intended.
---
Wow is now a finely tuned machine with nearly zero wiggle room for the players and this is exactly what vanilla would become as Brian stated.  The only way Blizzard could tune classes the way they did in vanilla is by introducing a random element to the patch process.  This is not a realistic possility although again it would be nice.

Here, you're using alternative universe "I'm in my 50s definitely my 30s!" Lothar. Please appreciate original Lothar pre retconned bastardized lore.
---
I only ever asked the dps to wait to 3 and they could hardly do that. I wish they'd give me 5 :(
---
If you dont use flight paths all the time, you can just fly to max ceiling, stop the time between areas and tab on desktop and reenter the game with pinpoint accuracy without ever having stepped onto the surface of Outland. 
---
That's pretty small from a gameplay perspective.
---
I can't unremember them so, no. 
---
It's unfortunate but I don't know about "ruin", lol. You're free to hate them of course
---
I must say as a rogue mages were my bane and getting kited was no fun so I mostly let them live when I saw one in the world.
---
This thread, and others like it, seem to suggest that the main experience people will have is going into MC for the first time and clearing it easily in epic speed run times. I really feel these claims are false.
---
There might be a specific set of players, groups from pservers who already raid together, perhaps already practiced in MC from their pserver, who might be able to do this, but it will not be the typical experience. And I think people reading this will wonder what is wrong with them or their guild, when this is not the experience they are having.
---
Vanilla raiding was a series of gear checks. If your raid did not have the DPS or the tanks did not have the HP then you did not progress. You can say all you want about years of knowledge and BIS gear not in raids, but players will need to put effort into obtaining BIS. Your not going to turn 60, enter MC and clear the zone in an hour.
---
When your guild is sitting in T2 or T3 and you enter MC, it does become a faceroll. But then MC isn't really content that matters anymore.  
---
I can't claim I have experienced trying to first time progress a guild through MC with the 1.12 patch, as my guild was tackling it in like the spring/early summer of 2005, but I feel this perception is really off.
---
If people have taken the time to farm BIS for the whole guild, then they put in a lot of effort already to enter MC and they are not these "Fresh 60's" that you claim to be facerolling content.
---
If the guild starts MC after obtaining ZG/T1.5 gear that trivializes the zone to the said degree, then their first raid was ZG not MC and they put in a lot of effort to "Catch up" to make MC trivial.
---
You are not going to have a random group of 40 people who just turned 60 within days of each other just walk into MC and clear it in 30, 60 or even 90 minutes.
---
Remindme! 3 days
---
My friend and I both made ne warriors with similar names and leveled all the way up together. We both tried to max out our crit chance as dw arms warriors as high as we could  because we had no idea what hit rating was. I still have no clue what I'll play this time around, kind of depends on who else I'll be playing with probably.
---
Yea on my rogue I would always see high tier guilds and be confused why their armor was all hit rating. I was stacking crit too.
---
10/25 raiding of the same content was among the worst choices Blizz ever made. The warping effects that you describer are the implications of no longer reliably having a variety of classes and specs. 10man was at its best in kara and ZA where the content was designed differently with smaller groups in mind.
---
I‚Äôm noticing a lot of NE hunters as first toons lol
---
I ddn't realize private servers would have an evolving meta considering the game doesn't update. Huh.
---
TPS over maximizing defense sounds sensible though. I remember lots of horror stories with DPS spiking their aggro over the Tanks. Brrr..
---
Looking for this guild for Europe! 
---
That‚Äôs a good plan. I was thinking of rolling either mage or hunter alt for farming 
---
Well, I've always been a casual quite invested into lore and the feel of the game. I could live with undeads being 40-50% of the population because after all humans were the race populating Lordaeron, darkspear trolls inhabitating a  small atoll and human/undead: tauren ratio is basically white: native american ratio, so it all fits. Orcs were the remnants of a once mighty invasion force scattered and trapped on Azeroth in small clans like Thralls and the Frostwolves that had to band together. 
---
But by lore standards belves shouldnt be 50%+ of the population. I might as well play alliance if I want to have most groups to consist of me and 4 pretties and myself, there is a reason I play horde, because I cant stand gnomes in my group. It does not make for enjoyable casual gameplay.
---
that's how you end up with even worse state of the game than retail is (majority horde for top 1% players)  
---
or you end up with situation where blizzard has to design encounters around shamans and paladins or where certain encounters favor each  class and then making the same number of encounters favor the other class, making it much tougher on them 
---
Every vanilla server I've played is always heavily horde favored too. Like a 3:1 ratio ESPECIALLY if its a pvp server. 
---
I am the alliance equivalent of this guy. 
---
Alliance UK warlock looking for pvp server 
---
They don't really have an evolving meta anymore, but people figured out a lot of stuff over the years that wasn't known during retail vanilla.
---
Stupid twitch thottbots  
---
allakhazam?
---
luckily wowhead will always mean what you think it means.
---
Well, you could still have a minimum limit on customisation. So you HAVE to wait 10 minutes (or w/e the arbitrary time limit they set is). But you can choose to wait longer, or never go Xrealm.
---
I think a lot of people would choose the Never option
---
&gt; Aren't exactly many good +agi maces floating around.
---
You say this like this has ever stopped a hunter from rolling on loot before &gt;.&gt;
---
Right? Holy Paladin were great, but ret paladin were easily countered by many classes. At least as compared to how strong elemental shammies could be. Double crits with nature‚Äôs swiftness and heals was a lot better than ret paladin in most cases. 
---
You could not just let a elemental shaman cast on you. It was bad news. You could let a ret paladin, even if you couldn‚Äôt get him off of you. I remember dealing with many a ret paladin on healers and just ignoring them unless they *really* knew what they were doing. With elemental shaman, you better get distance or LOS or you‚Äôre in trouble. 
---
Wasn't that Everquest? It all runs together. 
---
Tbc was great and all but it was the start of flying mounts and they are still a shite idea. 
---
Mind controlling hordies off of thousand needle lift, zeppelins and more

There's a wowhead from a thottbot joke there somewhere.

---
LMAO, stopped reading there.  Learn to read before you reply, especially learn to read before you write a pointless essay based around your own misunderstanding
---
I understand why they are bad for world PvP but man as someone who plays on PvE servers they're great. 
---
People played horde because the character models looked way better. 
---
Humans had the most powerful pve racial, horde tended to have the best pvp racials.
---
Classic was balanced in favour of allies slightly - Paladins were better than shamans. 
---
I don't know how long this ago was for you, but the larger ones in the past few years had always had ~55-45% or better split. The current two good servers have 46% or 53% horde, with the few before this also having similar distributions.
---
Why does everyone forget that humans had the best pve racial in game.... you couldn't beat human rogue/warrior dps except on certain bosses where the timings favoured the burst racials of horde. In any long drawn out continuous tank n spank, +weapon skill owned all other racials for dmg.

I raided on a Paladin for nearly 2 years. 50 days played time on a pserv blizzlike. Cleared Abom wing and everything before it.
---
Ret is viable. However it is viable under *EXTREME* circumstances.
---
- They are very gear dependent. At least AQ40 ish gear in order to do well. A decked out pally in T2 can do alright as well. If your damage is hurting, try slapping on a [Nightfall](https://www.wowhead.com/item=19169/nightfall). Your raid leader will be less reluctant to let you come because you help the casters that way.
---
- They will almost never beat a rogue, mage, or warlock with similar gear and skill. You *can* top the charts on specific fights, especially in Naxx, but those fights are extremely rare and you will be min maxing your rotation like a mad man. It is a very difficult climb up the meters.
---
- It takes a lot of skill and practice to do well on a ret pally. Not everybody can do it. You can't just smoke a fat J and relax for raid, which a lot of classes (like mage, warlock, and some healers) can do quite easily.
---
- They can offer a lot of utility, like BoW on the boss. However.. a skilled holy paladin can do that too, so you really need to emphasis your importance to the RL by having it up constantly and being an asset to the raid. 
---
- Because of their extreme niche, and because their utility is very one-tracked (one paladin can do it all) you will almost never see more than one (if any) in any progression raid. If you're the second ret pally in any guild worth its salt, expect to get sat. A lot. Unless they're struggling to get people, but even then you might get sat in the middle of the raid if it's a progression kill.
---
- Unfortunately due to their stigmatism, most raid leaders will just say no flat out. Unless that raid leader is a pally him/herself, or has at least played a pally and knows wtf they're doing, there's a good chance you're just gonna get turned down right out the gate.
---
It works in various spots like the hillsbrad mines, just tried it the other day and it was a derpfest
---
Strength doesn't increase ranged damage, but remember that players can switch weapons midfight. Imagine getting up close to a hunter and then immediately getting whacked with a Sulfuras.
---
I was a fury warrior so if I didn‚Äôt wait until 5 I would usually be met with a crushing blow to the face and a walk of shame.  
---
i hated those nerds that were so against classic servers lol. like they got some sort of joy saying no blizzard will never do it EVER
---
Yep that was it! I kept thinking al jazeer and knew that was wrong. 
---
Flying was ok in TBC because it didn't trivialise content. They also had cool flying related content that could only be accessed by flying, and flying was a fair investment that wasn't necessarily accesible as soon as you hit 70. 
---
I think TBC was a great expansion personally. 
---
You can viably level a mage just fine with zero talent points. It would still be faster than warrior.
---
For single target questing nothing beats the frost wombo combo.
---
WPVP while leveling mostly comes down to who starts the fight (as opposed to who was in the middle of fighting a mob) and all that matters are escapes. Frost has an edge when it comes to escapes and preventing escapes, but again all that's really going to matter most of the time during leveling is who was at 20% health when the fight started.
---
No joke I was asking for this exact content like yesterday or the day before. Subscribed. 
---
Yes, mage do well in every spec, better than most of other class actually.
---
It's just that frost AoE build is insanely good.
---
Fire is great cuz lot of damage but you'll have to drink more than frost and be pay attention to your dot in instance.
---
Arcane is good too, less than fire imo but still do the work. You'll be casting frost/fire spell tho
---
How much of an advantage does the alliance have with holy paladin vs. elemental shaman? Genuinely curious as you seem quite skilled.
---
LOL yes. Old school model brings me back. I got bonereaver's edge after OEB too. That one never got updated. BRE will be always be my favorite sword.
---
I had a set of alphabet dice I used to generate NPC names for tabletop games. Rolled Z-N-Z-O, rearranged the and sounded out the rest to make Zonzede.
---
Then I decided when my alt was getting camped, I wanted them to know for a fact that it was My main who came to camp them back, hence the rest.
---
Yeah, as a healer. But healing in most mmo's is boring to me.
---
Then double nevermind, shadowmeld is useless.
---
Thank you, koruptedone, very cool!
---
I think people overstate how flying "ruined" the immersion in TBC. In my TBC experiences while leveling, no one had a flying mount. Until several weeks into 70, most people didn't have flying mounts. And when people did have flying mounts, they were slow speed, and usually they were still visible in Shatt and zones alike. 
---
I think the changes in TBC made a lot of sense. Increased class balance without making the classes feel too samey, and ensuring that each type of player can engage with an interest (faction grinding, dailies, heroics, raids, and a much more thorough PvP system). In a lot of ways, I think, flying encouraged more world exploration in how it was done in TBC, because while there were plenty of zones, the zones weren't really that large, but they were densely packed, and the questing system encouraged player exploration, so I found that by the time I had my flying mount I've explored a lot of areas on foot, and actually just engaged more with the world from a higher up vantage point. Zangarmarsh, blade's edge, netherstorm, shadowmoon valley, and nagrand had various ways of making the zone feel more 3-dimensional so players could get a lot from flying in them.
---
While they had introduced more ways to engage the player, I still felt like I was thrown into the Outlands. There wasn't much handholding, the quest were honestly more interesting and more engaging, and the zone styles were unique and beautiful. Raid mechanics got a boost. There was still flexibility, and freedom in the heart of TBC IMO. 
---
WotLK spread out the zones, and made them more barren, which I think hurt the case for flying mounts. They didn't do as much to force the player to explore, and cold weather flying wasn't too hard to access for people who already had epic flying / a bunch of gold. 
---
For me it was the introduction of the LFG system, and especially later the LFR system, overly intricate class balancing, and the hold your hand pop up combat system that just made it lose engagement for me. Top that off with an unclear direction in lore, blizz just completely lost touch with the "throw you into this world" feeling that made players intrigued in the first place. That being said, I enjoyed Wrath, especially the first half of it. But with things like Trial of the Crusader, it became obvious that the game was... changing. I didn't have to raid to have raid level gear anymore, which felt very cheap.
---
heh
---
It wasn‚Äôt actually balanced though.
---
I thought the joke was that neither side had anything of value, but apparently I'm pretty seriously misremembering class balance based on the discussion here.
---
Mostly. I would call it handy. Not useful or useless. Just Handy.
---
I remember playing Ret in TBC and after a few dungeons with some random he said "I used to think Ret was a joke but you've shown me otherwise". I also topped damage on a Magtheridon half guild/half pug raid which must've been pretty embarrassing for everyone else involved.
---
Sample size 2 now :)
---
Omg... So many wasted hours. 
---
And as I've said, they have chosen 1.12. So not much to chose any more.
---
I agree. As much as I'am hyped for classic, my favorite expansion was TBC, I quit after they introduced Wraith as there were too many things I didn't like anymore.
---
TBC wasn't the perfect WoW I imagined but it got pretty fucking close.
---
* Class/Talent balance was great because they managed to make more stuff viable w/o dumbing the game down (as they did with pretty much every exp after).
---
* PVP was better in general allthough I disliked the emphasis on Arena. I find BGs a much more compelling, balanced and tactical mode and I always felt like it was a huge bummer that PvP was so much Arena focussed.
---
* In general combat mechanics improved, they added more interesting mechanics for NPCs (learning mainly from Naxx) and for players.
---
* Solo grinding for pre-raid equipment improved by giving a smoother powercurve.
---
* 5mans improved for both casual and hardcore players.
---
* Raiding was *much* better. Shrinking the raids was a huge QoL improvement w/o making the raids easier. Raid progression was smoother and more interesting. Kara/Gruul/Mag was a much better raid introduction than Oni/MC. Gearchecks were slightly smoother. T2+ improved both in style and mechanics over Classic.
---
You can always join the Discord server for European Classic fans/vanilla old-timers (https://discord.gg/SdVt9zN). There are already few guilds recruiting and many more will surely come about the closer we get to summer. Anyone is free to join!
---
&gt; You can viably level a mage just fine with zero talent points. It would still be faster than warrior. 
---
This hurts because it's true. QQ
---
Ah i remember that... was more of Atari 2600 style then what most people know now as 8 Bit gaming :D
---
I tried the hillsbrad farms and that fort besides ratchet. In both cases I targeted the mobs but when the heal went off it healed me instead of them
---
Can't say I remember seeing a lot of female tauren who were not druid that's for sure
---
Elemental shamans were great in vanilla, the other side should say holy paladin to match.
---
Gross, and completely unappropriate...
---
Retail vanilla was more often Horde favored too but actually not in numbers but in skill. *In general* people who were looking forward to PvP naturally chose Horde, so you often had more "competitive" players on that side.
---
There is no class balance in classic
---
It doesn't take an absurd amount of time it's like 6 days playtime or so or a couple of weeks of 12 hour sessions 
---
Pulling lots of melee mobs, flashing my ass looking like a prome target for a rogue to gank. Then impaling them on my porcupine quills.
---
Yup. I remember spending hours grinding murlocs on the east coast of Swamp of Sorrows with my priest, because Thottbot stated they had a higher than average chance to drop Furen's Boots. Needless to say, 2 full levels and never got them.
---
I'm sorry that sarcasm doesn't translate well through Memes.
---
My main was a nelf rogue, back in 2004. Loved the class, despite its flaws (lack of self healing and lack of aoe bothered me but still).  Will roll human rogue in classic, i prefer alliance and i love rogues.  
---
I'm remembering them as being bad at raid dps, and simple but effective in pvp, definitely the best of the hybrids. Vulnerable to silence and easy to focus, but still solid. It's probably just that it's been so long that they've faded into the background bias of "Hybrids were shit in vanilla."
---
Technically my first character was rogue, but it took so long to gouge-backstab mobs to death that I abandoned it and started a hunter that I mained for the duration of vanilla. 
---
It wasn't until later I understood that I was supposed to use swords or maces instead for levelling. 
---
Ah, thanks! Good to know
---
we were on the subject of sheep.
---
I think the joke was that they were only available for one side of the faction as opposed to both sides being able to have a shaman n pally
---
sir, as [consumercommand](https://www.reddit.com/user/consumercommand) said above "TBC with no flying mounts.  That‚Äôs pretty much it. I'm already going warrior gonna stay in my chair till I get thunderfury blessed blade of the windseeker and then maybe get some sleep 
---
because we were talking of mage spells, and sheep
---
Yeah, I think ret was viable in TBC. It just had too much stigma left from vanilla.
---
I agree with all this but I'm not sure how later expacs feature dumbed down classes vs TBC (in a pve sense anyway). TBC classes were basically as simple as Vanilla. 
---
Front backstab did not work in the Classic demo. It did not work in retail Vanilla. It exists due to, essentially, bugs in the private server code. 
---
I mean, that doesn't necessitate balance though. Being mutually exclusive is the only time things can be balanced or imbalanced, right? That's just... different? Things have to be different to make a balance joke.
---
There is no class balance in BFA
---
Or. You know. Maybe she hates them because they blew up her city and murdered everyone there. 
---
So let me see if I have this right:  
---
Rogues are scissors, Warriors are rock. Priests, Druids, Hunters, Mages, Paladins, and Shamans are paper. Warlocks are Mushrooms. Paper beats Rock. Scissors beats Paper. Scissors also beat Rock until Rock hits level 60 at which point Rock becomes an unstoppable killing machine that also beat Paper and would beat Scissors, but it can‚Äôt find Scissors because Scissors is invisible.  
---
So Scissors beat Paper and avoid Rock and that is called ‚ÄúBalance‚Äù
---
Orcs also had +weapon skill?
---
Well yeah ret paladins are more viable than ele for raiding, because it‚Äôs nearly impossible to raid as ele for a variety of reasons. Difference is that ret is D tier raiding and D tier PvP but ele is F tier raiding and A tier PvP.
---
It either drops or it doesn‚Äôt. Sounds about right to me. 
---
Son of Hakkar is soooo fun. I used Lupos until it got nerfed in 1.9 on the unnameable server because it was just so busted, but Son of Hakkar is like a new and uniquely fun brand of busted, even if slightly less busted.
---
perfection
---
The only Thott I'm fuckin with. 
---
We were not.  
---
I replied to this:  
---
&gt; [Do we have any actual wizards on reddit? Are the mage spells realistic? :)](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ajiggc/because_every_weapon_is_a_hunter_weapon/eewp3sz/)  
---
There was no mention of sheep in their comment, and there wasn't in mine.  
---
This guy plays classic. 
---
I completely understand your logic and mainly agree with you. Flying mounts nearly broke wpvp, you just fly past people.. wut u gun do m8? PoM Polly me then slowfall/ice block? Pretty sure eventually they made it so you were immune to poly while on a flying mount. I enjoyed all of the PvE and Instanced PvP in tbc, don‚Äôt get me wrong. If I was going to run around and cause chaos in tbc, I would be running to a capital city in Azeroth. Tbc leveling was enjoyable too. 
---
Didnt this get patched?
---
I thought you were talking about Twitch there at first
---
Not sure, this seems to be an opinion piece and imho I feel shamans are better. Never played pally until tbc when horde could roll one.
---
My first character was a Night Elf Hunter called Blobbyness (I was 13 ok). I made him sometime in 2007, I remember spending all my silver on white vendor armour, not being aware that I could tame a pet and when I discovered the talent system at level 14 I didn't realise there was more than one tree. I remember feeling enchanted by the Nelf starting zone, finding my first green item (malachite lol) and having a moral crisis as to whether to roll need or greed - what could it mean!? (Of course I rolled need.)
---
Fast forward 12 years and I'm a dedicated Horde player. For classic I did some testing about six months ago on a private server to see what class I liked most. After getting all classes to about level 20 I have decided to roll an Orc Rogue and an Undead Warlock as my mains. Despite the folly of my youth I want to still take my time, but I'll be trying my best to play these classes to a high standard also. 
---
My focus will be getting to 60 first and foremost with the intent of enjoying world PvP mostly. However I'll be doing everything I can besides grinding high honour ranks and hardcore raiding in AQ/Naxx. 
---
&gt; I can't claim I have experienced trying to first time progress a guild through MC with the 1.12 patch, as my guild was tackling it in like the spring/early summer of 2005, but I feel this perception is really off.
---
The game balance in 2005 was drastically different than 1.12.1. Secondary stats were rare on pre-raid items in 2005. They were not rare on pre-raid items by 1.12.1. 
---
Your experience is comepletely different than what people will see in Classic, unless MC is substantially buffed to compensate for the additional power a moderately geared, pre-raid, max level character will have in 1.12.1 or higher. 
---
I do fine as a warrior, but not everyone does and I was thinking of how we could make it a tad more bearable or at least lower the skill ceiling on it but NOOOOO \*rings bells\* \*NO CHANGES\* good boy.
---
There is more balance in BFA than Classic
---
Depends a bit on gear level. Early server the shaman brings a lot of dmg even with low gear &amp; windfury totem for the horde warriors  while the paladins healing is pretty weak with low gear, basically a dispel bot that brings utility with freedoms &amp; bops. Keeping low geared warriors alive vs shamans can be rough but as the server progress and the warriors get more geared alliance can basically outlast horde in wsg/AB. 
---
Tdlr horde is very strong early with shamans but gear changes everything in favor for the alliance. In big group pvp paladins bring more with their kit
---
Orc was by far the best race for the class I played at the time. And in wrath every bis two hander except for in ulduar was an axe.
---
There are some people who min/max to an extreme and worry about maintaining a certain XP per minute rate and all this jazz. It's kinda toxic almost.
---
This mentality, sadly dominates a lot of Classic WoW Youtube content. Maybe it's self-selecting where the only people watching this stuff on YT were people who were going to do this whole efficiency obsession, but I worry it'll become mainstream. Literally half the charm of vanilla was just people doing whatever they want at their own pace. 
---
well. I stand by my original comment, that your girlfriend is a sheep. because you have yet to prove she wasn't. 
---
What changes are being made that ruin classic raids?
---
Only one I can think of is loot trading. 
---
but there was in the thread.  And these comments were right next to each other
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ajiggc/because_every_weapon_is_a_hunter_weapon/eewq59x
---
I remember running around Mulgore on my tauren warrior and i couldnt complete a quest and i whispered a guy for help and all he said was thottbot.  I was so confused at first ...decided to google and rest is history.
---
clearly, I just want ez mode trash retail wow because arguing that is easier than arguing the actual point holy shit you people are obnoxious.
---
Only in premades or with good players really. When you get into random WSG and you notice both Paladins are rets and only BoP themselves, then it's more of a detriment.
---
&gt; By the way, just because I can't help it...If you can't kill 2 mobs at once as a warrior, you really shouldn't play one. Like at all. Before level 20, alright, you shouldn't pull more than one mob. But around level 20 with at least a little bit of green/blue gear? It's not that hard. 
---
wow why you were pontificating there you actually discovered my point almost.
---
Hi, /u/ithilras
---
You can't buy the items once you derank, but you can still use them if you already bought them
---
[deleted]
---
First character: Undead warlock.
---
Current character: Worgen Druid.
---
Favorite Class of All Time: Druid.
---
Have played all classes and races since 2005, however.
---
Camping thousand needles grimtotem area as a stealth class. Not only is the corpse run like 5 minutes, but the final chain in the quest for the area has an escort that can be killed easily.
---
My record on lightbringer is 5 level 60s trying to find me at once, and trying to help the swarm of lowbies to get the escort done.
---
Yea 6 days played time is 148 hours... meaning if you play this game like it's a second job 40 hours a week it would still take you about a month to hit 60. 
---
This just isn't true in general, lol, in BC horde had much better pvp racials, the best for warriors(orcs) , the best pallies(belfs) , the best for shamans(orcs), the best hunters(orcs), the best rogues(ud/orcs), the second best druid (xD), and the best casters in PvP(ud) , although I think gnomes had an extremely slight advantage for PvE casters.
---
In classic the main advantage for the ally side in PvP is having exclusive access to Pally healers, which gave your team another magic dispel in BGs and fast, reliable, and tanky healers. Where as the horde had to depend on priest for all of their magic dispels, and it was still close, once you introduced pallies to the horde(the best pallies) the alliance just couldn't compete.
---
In PvE there is still a huge debate into which faction is better in classic, and from what I understand, the horde have better clear times in the earlier content (MC/BWL/Ony) because of windfury totem and how obsurde warriors are. In the later patches however, the damage on alliance warriors gets extreamly high, negating  rage gain issues, and the threat mitigation blessing from pallies means that they can go full H. A. M. where as horde warriors reallllllly need tanks pushing their threat through the roof.
---
Melician, Human Warlock. I wanted to be called Death at first but that was taken. Then Malice. But that was also taken. Then Malician. No dice. Probably should've given up on the whole "malice" thing looking back.
---
I'll be a Human or UD rogue in Classic. Name depends on which faction :)
---
They've choosen 1.12 as a client/server base... It's not 100% 1.12, as people have already noticed.
---
Do you want classic or 1.12 classic? I want classic, and I'm not picky about what version of classic it is. You seem to only want 1.12.
---
Kind of strange to be extremely narrow on your exact classic preference.
---
Yea there are more "viable" specs. What sucks is that classes are broken down into sub classes and the customizability of a spec is nearly dead. 
---
Fighting without any honor whatsoever while leveling. Ganking players regardless of number with my fellow rogue brother. Waiting for the enemy to pull and being low on health.
---
And then watch them relog their main to look behind every tree to spot us. /hug them.
---
Rince and repeat. 
---
We have pretty similar goals! 
---
Is that slur a modern occurrence? Not a native speaker.
---
Maybe we were on different pservers- I know it definitely worked in vanilla so it will hopefully make it to Classic. 
---
They did Dark age of Camelot as well!
---
Gotta be NE. Flips for days.
---
I'm definitely maining a priest come classic. If I'm going priest then I'm too min/maxy of a person to not pick dwarf for fear ward and desperate prayer. I really enjoyed pvp in 2004-2006 when I mained a mage, and as time went on I steadily transitioned more and more towards raiding, and eventually raid healing. I figure if I'm still looking to raid heal and pvp, then shadow priest for solo pvp / leveling and holy priest for group pvp /raiding seems like a really solid plan.
---
Are you german speaking?
---
I might recommend horde. We may not look like much, but we got it where it counts kid.
---
Tauren aren't the best race for tanks, at least in classic, I can't speak for TBC, but tauren didn't have the threat output that #1 orcs could produce with axes, or #2 trolls could put out with berserking.
---
I personally like what BFA has done with classes. Each spec is completely different. I hated being a fire mage using arcane and frost. It just didn't make sense. Now a fire mage is full on fire. I know a lot of people don't like it, but it makes perfect sense to me.
---
Skinning a devilsaur and having people rage whispering me 
---
The answer to your direct question is Yes, if you de-rank you can no longer buy the corresponding PvP grind rewards.
---
The more interesting question you're asking, though, is, 'Will there be updates to the PvP rewards?'
---
I am willing to wager the answer to that question is No.
---
They went on to make wowhead, didn't they?
---
That‚Äôs my plan (besides being alliance scum)
---
You forgot the horde patrol wrecking your shit when you try to kill some bear for the hunters lodge! 
---
How could I forget that?! I did cut like 3 or 4 things tho, I couldn't find anything funny about the dig site or ogres or the kobolds for instance. Bingles lies in my heart and was very memorable
---
No I understand why people would enjoy it. Simply a difference in preference. I just feel like you lose your identity as a mage and just become a pyromancer for lack of a better term. But like I said, different people like different things.
---
It'll be nice to have the option to play both versions tho. I think that's going to be great, even people like myself who quit a long time ago will mess around on the current product, hell I'll probably even raid a little.
---
Just play Blood or Havoc 
---
Don't forget horde had better faction specific abilities as well.
---
My first toon was a NE Hunter. I deleted her because I hated Darnasus and couldn't figure out how to get a pet. I also deleted a human (too crowded), and a dwarf before I found my home in TB with my Tauren druid and decided I was horde. My slow internet liked lonely Mulgore, and I thought the plainstriders were kinda cool.  My first MMO was EQ. I was in my 20's and had several kids on my friends list who would send me stupid messages about dumb shit lol. I didn't mind because it was funny and enjoyed being immature and goofing off. Besides the goofy chatter slacked off if we grouped up and did some serious grinding.  WOW was different though, the immature kids were just toxic little assholes who enjoyed trolling so I avoided and ignored kids in WoW.
---
Couldve done some ISIS related thingi with the dark iron dwarves trying to blow up the dam and the ogres have some item needed for the defusion of the bomb: [https://classicdb.ch/?quest=278](https://classicdb.ch/?quest=278). 
---
It's quite interesting really but Ive only done it once, because its a lot of walking with very little reward.
---
Nevertheless I like the picture. Loch Modan is dear to my heart!
---
Dude, stop...
---
My first main was an undead rogue as well, and his name was Darkvegito. I ended up rerolling to a paladin half way through vanilla though, and a paladin would be my main from then until I quit in Cata, and briefly when I started playing again in February 2017. I wound up levelling a druid tank by October, which is the toon I became MT on for my guild through Legion. I took BFA as a chance to go back to my paladin though, and I haven't regretted it.
---
That said, I plan to tank in Classic, so a warrior it is for me. :/
---
...a gnome warrior, to be exact. ;)
---
&gt; Wow, you're probably the first person I've heard who isn't a fan of TBC.
---
tbc is constantly shit on here.  mostly with purely subjective criticism that people deem as objective reasons why it sucks.  as if vanilla is some untouchable gem that didn't introduce half the things people complain about from tbc
---
You guys are convincing me to roll an elemental shaman for classic....
---
"In the thread someone said a swear word, so we can all swear freely."  
---
No, that's not how it works, one checks their comment, and who they are sending it to, **before** submitting.
---
I see Thottbot, I upvote!
---
Hey, haven't they said that they will make a wowhead classic version, that will look like Thottbot? Or am I mistaken?
---
It's really difficult picking a favorite zone from vanilla but after typing out the later half of this post I realized it's 100% Loch Modan for me. 
---
On my first ever character, dwarf warrior, this is where I met up with one of my future best friends who was a night elf hunter. I remember we had to call each others house using a landline since we didn't have vent or cell phones yet and I remember him freaking out as '??' level crocs were chasing him through wetlands. 
---
I'll never forget get swarmed by a million troggs at once on the islands looking for bingles lost tools or getting globbered by ol sooty our first attempt and the feeling of accomplishment when we eventually downed him with the help of some other adventurers. 
---
1.12 lets you buy based on your highest rank.
---
Prior to the patch the system was such that you had to get everything within the week you hit that level which was insane. I‚Äôve made the comment before that we would often loan money to high warlords to make sure they could get the weapons they wanted.
---
The patch changed it so that once you deranked you could still buy stuff at the highest level you attained. I hit rank 10 and deranked go around 5 by the time I quit and I could still buy the whole PvP set.
---
Thottbot is the reason I bought the cheapest 15‚Äù lcd I could find... dual monitor setup with the ‚Äúmassive‚Äù 19‚Äù crt I used for WoW. 
---
That quest chain is basically satan. 
---
It'll depend whether my guild from K1 reforms or not
---
What information was I supposed to glean from that shitty image? 
---
It's really hard to choose. I haven't leveled a toon in the while so I try my best to recollect anything that stained my memory. This is why I advocate others making these, I feel like someone else could do stv justice
---
They have chosen the modern client/server as the base. :) They just import the 1.12 data and change the code (or add back the old one from 1.12) to support it and behave like Vanilla.
---
I want Vanilla and not something "rebalanced" or "made better" or "improved". Fortunately Blizzard agrees.
---
Why do Scotsmen wear kilts?
---
Because sheep can hear a zipper a mile away.
---
I can't remember which content creator it was, but I do remember someone showing a community poll for people who planned to play classic, and one of the questions was exactly this. "Which faction do you want to play on?" The answer was something like 51/49, which I found pretty surprising.

Admittedly it's a small sample size of a specific kind of the playerbase, but it is at least a little bit reassuring. The problem with server lockouts is that if it does end up imbalanced, it feels really, really bad to try to log on and join your friend's server and be told you can't. It feels almost as bad as being told your friend can't play with, and what feels the worst is, 3 hours to 2 days into your character's life, you find out that your best friend isn't able to play on the server and give up on it.
---
So yea, I don't want population imbalance. But lockouts feel really bad, and by the time you've implemented one on the server in the first place, it's very likely to stay imbalanced forever, simply because new players will find themselves outnumbered and experienced/informed players will know not to roll there. Hopefully there's a clever solution to this problem that I'm not seeing, because "Hope that the players end up balanced," even if it's statistically likely, isn't a good plan.
---
Here‚Äôs the flow chart for determining which class to play
---
1: Determine which class would be the most fun to play.
---
2: Pick said class.
---
But to answer your question, every class is always relevant in every raid as they all have utility and skills that are invaluable. Hunters do fall off in DPS a bit due to the way their damage scales on skills and due to the lack of a lot of really good ranged weapons (there are some but it‚Äôs not like swords, axes, maxes, etc).
---
Just don‚Äôt worry!
---
Gnome warriors are hilarious! (Also escape artist helps so much against mages)
---
If you're arcane spec, is arcane missile your main nuke? Do you ever cast firebolt, or frostbolt for anything other than the slow?
---
Yes their dps falls off but guilds always need to bring at least 2 for the tranq shot. Raid spots are usually pretty competitive since they are easy to level and are a somewhat popular class in general. 
---
Is frost shatter combo better for single target leveling than fire?
---
Oh yikes. I met a few toxic kids but my experience was mostly positive with the vanilla community. I wonder if you just picked a bad realm or something.
---
Give it up mate
---
Oh man this takes me back. WoW was a completely different game before they built in quest tracking. Thottbot was your savior. Thottbot knew where Mankrik‚Äôs wife was. 
---
I know the classic developers have said they want to release a vanilla-like experience without all the vanilla-hassle, do we know yet if there‚Äôs quest tracking or no? I would both love and hate to run around blind in the barrens again
---
ywn live a comfy life fishing on the loch every day and eating thelsamar blood sausages
---
it hurts 
---
I agree it's not feasible to release an experience, but to tweak a few things to mimic it as best they can would be a good thing as long as it's done responsibly, take pre 1.12 raid parses average then post 1.12 raid parses and buff the bosses by the difference. Release DM and zg later since their gear is way better than it should be for that point of the game, and release world buffs as a catchup mechanic. 
---
I'm not taking about making things dark souls levels of hard, (although I am a huge fan of the series) I'm talking about helping players who have never played classic create new experiences to rival ours. My teenage brother will be playing for the first time, I want him and others like him to be able to remember it like we did, struggling and overcoming adversity. Not buffing up and steamrolling content.
---
The bad ones were later on in the game. Vanilla was pretty chill mostly.
---
Daggers give you Ambush. Also known as "knock a mob down to 25% in one hit and Eviscerate to finish them off. I wouldn't trade it for anything.
---
Bad at raid DPS is correct because bosses had nature resist and they had no way to manage mana. Simple but effective doesn‚Äôt do them justice they would absolutely melt things in PvP. Proper positioning and they could obliterate a health bar every 5 seconds.
---
/taunt ofcourse.
---
My first character has also been my main for the entirety of my wow playing (though that's been pretty spotty the last 8 years - I also seem to pick the bad exps, skipped MoP, came back for WoD, skipped Legion, tried BFA v briefly).
---
Yasrielle female gnome warlock (with the princess Leia hairstyle). Didn't really rp but the simple concept that inspired younger me when making it was the idea of some tiny hooded figure in a tavern. They throw back the hood and look all cute and innocent until they start throwing around all sorts of fel energies.
---
&gt; I want Vanilla and not something "rebalanced" or "made better" or "improved". Fortunately Blizzard agrees.
---
You keep saying this, why do you argue against a strawman? We are saying use class balances that existed in vanilla. That by definition is vanilla.
---
You seem to be argueing with yourself.
---
&gt; Fortunately Blizzard agrees.
---
Ha, blizzard already is making unvanilla changes. They don't agree with you. I'm Ok with the sharding, loot trading, no spell batching myself, but it clearly isn't vanilla, so no, blizzard doesn't "agree". :)
---
Whaaa that‚Äôs awesome you‚Äôve stuck with her? Mind telling us her /played?
---
He's not arguing that he wants a hard experience. He's saying that bringing back vanilla exactly as it was, will not feel like vanilla as it was then. That things like tuning boss difficulty to make them harder will actually make them feel closer to vanilla than leaving their stats as they are.
---
I'm undecided on that sort of thing, to be honest. I'm not sure if I think they should be changed in an attempt to preserve the feel, or if there's no point in trying and dev time is better spent on other things, since raid progression will never feel now like it did then, even if we can get closer.
---
The point I'm trying to make though, is that they're not arguing for a hard wow or an experience catered to him. He's arguing that certain changes make the game feel more like it used to than leaving them the same.
---
I like NE well enough. My dream WoW toon would be a human druid. That'll likely never happen, though.
---
Several warriors in tank gear with 2hers.
---
Many paladins in t2 shoulders.
---
So. Many. Corn. Sticks.
---
Classic guild confirmed. :+1:
---
Unless the rogue gets a one shot in, how do you lose vs them as a mage tho?
---
This is incredibly accurate. Not only are they equally balanced, in every instance I've found, their population is always tied!
---
The problem is that if they just rerelease 1.12 as it was, then they've already failed. There will be catch up items in 5 man dungeons better than some MC gear. The PVP gear will be insanely strong. Raid progression will be very strange since we'll start with nothing and have every raid released, or alternatively, pvp gear and dungeon gear will be better than MC gear, and MC will be the only raid.
---
I want an accurate representation of vanilla, which I think is the same thing that you want. The problem's arise when you realize that just putting up patch 1.12 onto a server doesn't really recreate it properly.
---
https://youtu.be/aXKntiaMLWY?t=415 is a common pserver bug. Will not happen in Classic.
---
The honest answer is that I don't currently have wow installed, though I am eagerly awaiting classic (despite general Activision nonsense otherwise tarnishing their brand). As a result I don't know the /played but im pretty sure it's quite a bit (over a year) since I started at 1.5 or 1.7 (whichever was ZG release).
---
‚ÄúWHY BLIZZARD WILL INTRODUCE TOKENS AND HOW IT WILL RUIN CLASSIC‚Äù, my personal favourite. 
---
Pallys are the best scaling healers in classic, because every crit they have they get 100% mana refund, so by Nax they are the strongest healers.
---
At least thottbot didnt run adds that murder your computer or browsercoin mining garbage. Wowhead is a plague. 
---
Lot of tanks were using daggers until like AQ (where you got good fast 1h weapons to get threat).
---
But when the threat issues are resolved the more gear you get, the tastier that 5% bonus HP becomes.
---
A lot of people started in 1.12. They didn't experience the "real" Vanilla?
---
But it's moot. Blizzard only has the 1.12 data. They said they'll hold it "almost sacrosanct". Some rebalancing is not impossible but I *highly* doubt they'll do anything of the sort.
---
Classic will be flawed of course. Vanilla was flawed too. Everyone can have their "ideal" version of Vanilla but there is only one objective standard. How was the game when it was live. We can at least hold Blizzard to that.
---
Meh, you purposefully ignore what I've written. No point continuing this. :)
---
It has general intro, ‚Äúyour first day‚Äù, basic game mechanics, class info, quests and maps, list of all equipment and a bestiary.
---
If you want a guide for the dungeons specifically, there‚Äôs a guide called the Dungeon Companion. I found a scan of it someone else made.
---
&gt;I understand what you're trying to get at, but at some point you have to think of game health. The existence of bloodlust was a huge factor in TBC raid groups. While you and many others may not care about the sport of it, leaving shaman as a Horde exclusive would affect faction balance. If you were a raider, it would be silly not to be Horde.
---
So don't add bloodlust then? Or just put it on the mage like they did later anyways. Bloodlust was thematic for shaman, yes. But could just been a single target self-buff for enhancement shamans.
---
&gt;Having the same classes on both factions doesn't make it less of an RPG. If you really want elements you should be able to choose a faction, with more than two options, as any race.
---
But it took WoW down a different route it would never recover from, which is "objective balance" as opposed to keeping it more in line with typical RPG's where shit up in the air and thats okay.
---
I honestly never even knew this existed way back then. I spent more time than I care to admit trying to figure things out on my own.
---
that hoe over there, thot, its like a softer whore or slut. slang
---
How is this a fundamental question
---
No. You use Arcane Power and frost spells.
---
I know what he is arguing for. And I said that's impossible and foolish to aim for. You can't get back a "feel" or "experience" or anything of the sort.
---
(Well, you could create an entirely new game to try and achieve something similar. But Classic is not about that.)
---
Big fan of Vanilla but I can't honestly see how it will be bigger than current retail.  You basically will get a small sub set of players from the past who will come back to relive the moment and maybe a lump of players from retail who are curious. 
---
If Blizzard can increase subs by at least 1 million because of Vanilla Wow, I think it's a success in my book. 
---
Don‚Äôt worry you won.
---
Just link the video it's not great in text form
---
What about pre lvl 40? Is arcane worth anything before your can get pom or AP?
---
&gt; one of those people who leveled around 30 chars to 20 before I ever chose a main
---
Same same.  The game was new and I wanted to try it from different angles.  I had no concept of the endgame or what was ahead, just what I had tried and what I was doing in the moment.  
---
Playing the game at level 20 was enjoyable.
---
Bj under the desk while you're playing? 
---
Arcane can be decent because of Imp Wand and Arcane Concentration. It‚Äôs still worse than Frost, particularly after Shatter comes online. Fire is far too much downtime. 
---
You can do something like this, using the most damage/mana efficient spell available for each level but after this point you have to make a decision between pumping Imp Arcane Missiles or going deeper Frost and then at 29 a respec to full Frost is ideal:
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#ocrVZZ0h
---
Yeah Thot only really became a thing in the past few years
---
A lot of people started in 1.12. They haven't played Vanilla then?
---
But it's all moot. They don't have older data. They only have 1.12. If you think that's not enough then you'll have to act according to that.
---
Classic will be flawed. Vanilla was flawed. It'll still be a very fun game, which deserves to exist. If you feel the need, you could try to ask Blizzard to create a "Vanilla+" for you, by rebalancing Vanilla, etc. Good luck but please leave Classic out of it.
---
Private servers are not classic or even close. 
---
There is a known bug/exploit on all pservers that allow paladins to hit like trucks. They are overall the best class on pservers. 
---
Paladins do not come close to that on classic.
---
Good on him for teaching you to fish instead of giving you a fish
---
Pretty sure twinking died when Blizzard segregated them, though.
---
Why do people say warriors have an insane spike at 60? Not before? 
---
I mained a rogue in vanilla, a hunter in tbc and a dk in wrath through bfa.
---
Very tempting to do rogue again. Amazing at pvp, arguably the best pve dps, and basically zero responsibility in raids. Life as a rogue in vanilla was reaaaaaaly nice. My only fear is that they will be very overpopulated. My backup plan is either mage or warrior.
---
Absolutely!
---
Lol no, flying, arenas, smaller raids, loss of faction classes, old content made irrelevant, all terrible
---
I mean pretty sure nearly everyone levels with a frost aoe spec, not arcane. You can do whatever if you want but it's hard to say that arcane is good or better than frost.
---
Seriously though... I remember coming back at 60 to stomp the life out of em out of spite. 
---
Loved thott so much. Playing before the days of wowhead was a unique experience 
---
&gt; meld drops you out of combat? Nevermind then, that shit is pretty good.
---
Yeah, but it doesn't wipe threat so if you break the meld while still in combat to drop threat but nothing picked it up if comes back to you. 
---
 I think wowhead is bloated trash ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
Yea to play rogue in classic you will need to play very competitively or get a good guild early to guarantee you raid spots.
---
Eh, if timed right vanishing can allow another opener (Cheap Shot) even if a DOT is applied, you just have to vanish then Cheap Shot like, right after a damage tic. I used to do this with warriors all the time. 
---
My roommate (60 tauren druid) and I (60 troll rogue) would stealthily follow questing horde lowbies in STV, unbeknownst to them. When the inevitable level 50 Ally ganker attacked the easy target, we would reveal ourselves and /no, bewildering our low level compatriot and scaring off the enemy.
---
Watch milksteaklol on Twitch. Shamans are OP. In premade pvp, shamans and warriors windfury will destroy any alliance premade. 
---
I don't get why you'd be upset about a res run but fine with just not inviting any class that needs the item reserved. At least in the res run case you're being straight forward and letting people who need other gear join.
---
Then again, you should only do res run it you already have a tank or are the tank imo, trying to get a warrior to tank and reserving an item they need too will never work.
---
Tauren Shaman, Urak
---
I didn't RP much at the time, I was too busy trying to play every class
---
I'm about 90% decided on Orc Warlock for Classic
---
Nowadays people understant to play it fast. Basicly just a race with minimal def
---
Blizzard wont care, they will offer $30 realm transfer as the only solution
---
This was one of my favorite things. I used to run UBRS CONSTANTLY trying as a rogue to get Felstriker and/or the Eye of Rend (I think I got the Eye of Rend but it was quickly replaced) and I would just hang out solo at BRM jumping nearly anyone unfortunate enough to go passing through. 
---
And FFXI.
---
It's coming back but it was bought out by Wowhead. Gonna be filled with ads now I guarantee it.
---
My first ever toon was a human male warrior named Uther.  Which should have been a paladin's name of course, but I clicked on warrior so that was that.  I remember comparing it to other classes and thinking Warr was limited and boring.  Nothing above level 30, mind you.  So in hindsight, yeah, that makes sense: low level warriors suck. 
---
I played a tiny bit of mage, druid, paladin, and warlock before settling on priest to main.  My friend saw my indecision and quietly nudged me toward dwarf priest (rather selfishly on his part, i might add) since he knew more about the game at the time.
---
In Classic i'm going to play warrior again.  Push through the leveling pain to get to godmode.  That is, unless I play mage.  Or maybe warlock... hmmm...
---
Depends entirely on how they do it. If it's every server they obviously - but If it's incremental like I'm suggesting then I can't see it being an issue.
---
Wowhead was perfectly fine for the first several years it was ran. And then someone ( a company I assume) bought it out for around $1M and started making a ton of money. 
---
All in all still love me some good old school thottbot. 
---
&lt;*undecided*\&gt; | Alliance-leaning | EU | PvP | Semi-hardcore   
---
I'm forming a guild with some friends. Most of our group is unfamiliar with vanilla, so if this is you and you're looking to play with similar-experienced people, give us a shot. We see ourselves as semi-casual, because most of the group is inexperienced. We're still aiming at decent progress through raids and PvP (premades). LC will handle the loot during raids, done by the people most familiar with the game. Raid times haven't been decided yet. We're trying to form a core group and we'll make certain decisions  (such as raid times, name) with the group. So if you're also new-ish and willing to experience vanilla with a group, shoot me a message.
---
NEED maxes in game. Half mace, half axe, full bad ass.
---
I abandoned my dwarf priest at level 4 or 5 because I couldn't find the injured dwarf to heal for the cookie crumb quest leading to Kharnos from the starter valley. He was just off the road, but dammed if I didn't search for an hour or two before giving up and making a hunter instead
---
I would argue, no, they haven't. If they started vanilla 3 months before vanilla ended? They probably didn't hit level cap, let's be real. They certainly weren't raiding or pvp'ing at any high level, which is the point of the discussion on changes like retuning bosses and progressive release of dungeons and raid content.
---
They 100% intend to release on that date. Can they deliver, who knows. Not even themselves since they only hinted at it instead of saying it.
---
Wait till Deathwing messes everything up though 
---
In group PVE ie 5 mans, people will constantly beg you to heal and then will be butthurt if you don't want to. Same for any class that can heal, really. Same also for DPS warriors who just want to chill and swing their big ass axe in a dungeon for once and not tank. After 20 minutes of looking for a tank/healer they're gonna try to pressure you. You can shrug and be flexible and heal or you can put your foot down and say no, I WILL be throwing shadow magic and mind controlling Scarlet Monks in this dungeon.
---
As a rogue people only expect you to kill shit and typically aren't worried about how you do so until it comes time to roll for loot. It can be refreshing not having to worry about  filling another role you don't particularly like or worry about having offspec gear in your bags.
---
Sharding in the first 1-2 weeks and loot sharing are great tbh. Loot sharing has always happened in classic aswell, as you had to contact a GM.
---
You forgot a few things like nerfing 15 year old content numerous times over private servers to make it easier than LFR and ruining the community.
---
\-itemization that Blizzard refuses to let interns do
---
\- patch release which is completely wrong 
---
\-DM destroying the economy
---
Have fun for 6 months though and make sure to parrot Brack and Ion's revisionist history as "rose tinted glasses" which influencers like Towelliee will claim was legit. You will be so far behind us hardcores doing split raids with 20 people and selling carries for easy gold that you might as well quit. In real vanilla would have probably been the year and a half mark...
---
TBH I think a post like this would work much better on xpoff.com. They have a classic wow section in their forums.
---
NA Alliance 29 Disc/Holy Support Priest name TBD
---
I don't have experience in Vanilla, but I made a slew of twinks in TBC before the ilvl 35 rule/libram restrictions were put in place. I'm definitely excited to bring some offensive support to my server.
---
best.lvl.area.ever
---
might be a big reason why i will play alliance :P
---
I may have misunderstood you to begin with. I guess that‚Äôs ok... but I‚Äôd still rather just be my server. 
---
This guy is a god! And what a sexy voice
---
A Human Warlock named Daphnee. I was 17 and shy, quiet, the "good kid", so I made a character that was basically the antithesis to me. I just loved playing as someone who commanded demons, rained hellfire down on her enemies, and sucked the souls from those who has the misfortune of coming across her.
---
I haven't decided what I'll play in Classic yet. I've mained a Holy Paladin for a long time, and I have friends who want me to heal for them, so I'll probably end up doing that or a priest.
---
Draenei shamans never meshed with me, but Dwarf shamans is inspired. The dudes literally used be to be made of earth. I'm also a fan of the Tauren paladins.
---
I dont think we are capable of holding blizzard to anything, I'm not even sure they are capable of holding their selves to anything. As excited as I am for classic I still have a little ember burning in the back if my head, telling me not to get too invested in it, because they have been known to pull the rug out from under us.
---
well wowhead owns Thottbot so...
---
"Gotta go to Thottbot to figure out how to be a good twink." Is likely to get you some funny looks these days.
---
Good luck selling raids in a game that's already easy and with no cross-server groups. 
---
In before ret paladins come in with their victim complex even though reckoning bombs literally one shot classes like rogue in a stun they have no pvp trinket to break.
---
They are so delusional they ignore that the vanilla wow leads said Paladin was made to be easy mode and they STILL think they have it harder than everyone else.
---
Undead Shadow priest named Ralgedi - been my main since vanilla, will be my main again in Classic ;-)
---
Rp personality is ‚Äúif it‚Äôs red it‚Äôs dead‚Äù :D
---
You're memeing right
---
No he‚Äôs probably right. 30 minute speed runs will not be the way average players in Classic experience the raid content (at least in the beginning).
---
It's been a thing for at least 6 years.
---
Source: graduated 6 years ago and people were saying it while still in school.
---
I [made a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/99d1rl/patchwerk_wednesday_pvp/) about the various updates PvP had received. Here's a quote from Patch 1.6
---
&gt;Honor system reward items with a rank requirement will now require a lifetime "highest rank" of that rank, rather than requiring the character to currently have the required rank.
---
So, if I'm reading this right it's lifetime highest rank, not current, that determines which items you're eligible for (have a bit of brain fog going on right now so if I'm reading that wrong someone correct me.)
---
My question is, though, as you can see in the post there were ~3 updates to the Rank 14 rewards throughout Vanilla's cycle. As of right now based on Blizzcon information PvP rewards will not be available at launch, but will be available in [Stage 2 of staggered content](https://imgur.com/a/r9JKF82)...but which version of rewards are we getting? 
---
Are we getting the items w/ stats as they existed in 1.11, their last updated to put them on parish with AQ? Or will they stagger the stats like they did in Vanilla's life cycle. I.e., they get released w/ 1.6 stats then updated when AQ is released, or are they going to release them w/ the stats as they existed in 1.12? 
---
I don't think they've said anything specifically about quest tracking but considering their design philosophy for Classic, I can't imagine they would include it.
---
Well, as I said, it's moot. Blizzard only has 1.12 and they'll not likely to retune anything.
---
And if they did, how do you know it would be to your liking? Or anyone's liking? That's what I'm trying to say. Classic is not a new game. We have a known point of reference (however flawed you or anyone else might think it is). The goal is to recreate that. Trying to "improve" or "rebalance" it would only lead to where no one would be happy. We wouldn't have Vanilla (whatever version). And almost assuredly we wouldn't have a good game either. It would just be a mangled something, based on Vanilla. (Just look at BfA if you want to know what you could expect. :)
---
I'm pretty sure it did in 1.6.
---
"Want to be able to heal without having to spam one button".... bad news on that one lol.
---
I will play the master class. Priest dispel magic is the goat. Any one claiming Shadow Priests are not the best pvp class. Will be proven liars. As I dispel their sheeps and, blocks of ice. The rage and denial will explode. They'll be claiming how wrong I am. Even as all my allies unhindered by the fruites of their cc slit their insolent throats.
---
In a perfect world, I'd love it to be just my server too. However, realistically it won't work for a lot of servers. I ranked to 14 on a popular pserver during the summer last year on the overpopulated faction.
---
Now, this rank was 30 minute queues constantly and this was only with a 55-45 ratio. Imagine how bad it'd be on a server with a big streamer on one side, just as an example. Or one that naturally ends up as 70% ally 30% horde. It'd just be an unenjoyable play experience in pvp on both sides, this would go some way to alleviating that.
---
My first character was a Gnome Warrior on good old Cenarion Circle. Loved playing that character and it remained my main through cata.
---
When Classic comes out I am looking to go either Human Paladin or some flavor of bear druid.
---
The experience of jaded 1.12 veterans on private servers does not extend to retail refugees used to LFR and returning players who may not have logged in for a decade. 
---
Your first three points are legit, but I think your meds wore off after that.
---
Wow comics were essential to the game play function of vanilla. I believe they even used comics to build the backend of vanilla wow's code. 
---
for the second time lol, nobody especially not me said fresh 60s can clear MC in 30 minutes.  Learn to read
---
Orbnaticus
---
Yea we need more Druid tanks! Warriors aren‚Äôt the only ones. (Prot paladins are a joke though)
---
you mean duels or arguments?
---
I couldn't fit all that on the meme, so I picked the big 2.  
---
Lol, I just found this thread! Thanks man :)
---
You mean like in current WoW? You have no idea how bad the modern playerbase is as far as being socially retarded/lazy. They will 100 percent pay for carries and for tier gear we don't even want because DM blues are better, which is another huge F up in Classic.
---
Enjoy those 40 man raids bud. I doubt anyone in them can even afford devilsaur with how much we will ruin the economy due to Ion's incompetence or purposely sabotage of Vanilla to make his current garbage WoW look good. The fact he is a lead shows Activision yes man Brack wants this to fail in the first place.
---
Go ahead and attack us for it, but it's how things are gonna be. We will see ourselves as helping you guys to. Ion and Brack will get fired faster and maybe they will do this right. Or? We all play on Nostalrius 2. We win either way. You are the ones who lose.
---
Lol, sup Hoff :D
---
Ohhh I wanna be a spookyboy 
---
I like how your motivation is proving people wrong and tilting your enemies lol
---
Exactly. If Blizzard was like it was when they created Vanilla, with everyone working on the game working on Classic, we might wanted to let them "improve" it. (I'd still think that we should get an (almost) exact replica of Vanilla, for historical purposes.)
---
But current Blizzard? They should just stick to recreating 1.12. At least that's know to be good, with all it's flaws. If they started to "imrpove" Classic, that would be the death of it.
---
Dwarf shamans are good, like you said they have the strongiest natural tie to Azeroth, I only wish Blizzard had given them the option of Wildhammer tattoos when they were added into Cata.
---
They've already changed mechanics in the beta? It's incredibly easy for them to include tiered progression. It's as easy as editing drop tables and closing instances. Dire Maul being in classic WoW at launch will make the game worse. Including it will not make it more like vanilla.
---
I member 
---
Kralnor?
---
Second person in this post to say their friend wanted them to go dwarf priest lmao. Guess that makes sense.
---
It's foolish to just assume that they won't.
---
1) The classic crowd likes no flying.
---
2) They now have 2 products to market to 2 different groups.
---
3) This relaunch of WoW is ultimately going to take a different design path in some, if not many different aspects from retail 
---
4) Reworking bc, wrath, and Panda land in order to accommodate no flying is 636374 times easier than developing new lands in new expansions, so the manpower needed would be a fraction of what's needed when developing all new stuff.
---
And finally, one of the biggest reasons we have is:
---
5) The devs wish that they had never introduced flying in the first place. This is their opportunity to redo WoW and never allow this aspect of the game to ever appear in.
---
So basically, the devs want no flying, the classic crowd wants no flying. I would say it's a very high probability that classic never sees flight.
---
Kraun is 100% right here. Shaman base damage is outrageous at the start of a server but they then diminish somewhat until bwl/zg patch when then become insane again.
---
I'd say the advantages ebb and flow throughout vanilla and it swings both ways as to which is strongest. 99% of the time the team that plays better will win through, and faction won't completely influence that.
---
The simple fact to change the debuffs from 8 to 16 is a huge impact on the raid itself. MC won't be the same with 8 debuffs.

It also wrecks the meme because now you understand just how ruined Classic is even before launch. I also didn't mention the broken servers on modern infrastucure that can't handle 100 players on screen. Meanwhile on Nostalrius with dirt cheap servers where Activision's Bobby Kotick isn't nickel and diming you...

You aren't getting Vanilla WoW. You are getting a broken, nerfed timewalking event that will be rushed and where everyone but hardcore players is screwed in a few months. Then they will do cross realm BG's to ruin the community even more due to everyone realizing it and leaving.
---
The kicker? You are defending a selfish, unethical, disgusting, company that took over Blizzard and kicked the CEO out who made WoW (Mike) and you are doing their dirty work for them, attacking the fanbase with a clue who knows how screwed Classic already is due to Ion/Brack.
---
He definetly won :wink:
---
Talk about cringy...

The issue with "sharding" is that it is a cost cutting measure. This is what the credulous don't seem to understand. When we fight about it. We are arguing in good faith over game play. In reality though Blizzard is not. They want sharding because, from their end. It is a far cheaper and, more efficient way to host the server.
---
So when Blizzard tries to get sharding into classic in any way. We recognize it for what it is. A ploy to put a cost cutting measure in the game while hiding that is in fact what you are doing.
---
To use a metaphor. We are a 16 year old girl. Blizzard is a 16 year old boy. He is currently pleading with us. If he can just put in the tip. To which I reply "LIES, DECEPTION!!"
---
Not everybody likew mage (or caster) gameplay, which is good obviously. Also mage is boring until level 20ish but picks up quite a bit when you get more spells and some talents
---
Yea, my raid group had a feral tank way back in the day. Looked really fun. Its definitely on my radar as an option.
---
I really enjoyed my Holy Paladin alt back then too. Healing was fun and I could tank 5 mans with it as well (super mana intensive though). I have a bunch of friends who want to roll warrior so I figured I'd try something else this time around.
---
every army needs a chef
---
Your ignorance is astounding. The server I played on doesn't even exist anymore. To assume you know its ins and outs without me even telling you its name is flirting with delusional grandeur.
---
I don't know. I think it's psychological! All the frustration from leveling is suddenly unleashed in max level battlegrounds. Suddenly, he stops cutting his hair and begin to furiously smash opponents. At that point, the metal music in the warrior player's house becomes so loud that nothing can stop him.
---
They haven't "changed" mechanics in the beta. They just failed to recreate them exactly. Any difference from 1.12 is a bug they already said they'll try and correct.
---
And it's incredibly easy for them to mangle things, yes. They don't have the data. They won't start to guess at how things worked.
---
They will do progressive content rollout. They won't do "progressive" mechanics or item rollout (which would be completely idiotic anyway but that's an entire other discussion and I won't do it, sorry :).
---
Do you, by chance, play the trumpet?
---
Which bit? The pet being taunted, or the pet following in stealth?
---
I have a feeling there's likely a number of pserver bugs that we've all gotten used to playing with/around - however, I think it's hard to say with absolute certainty what is correct and what isn't when we're basing things off memories from over a decade ago.
---
Personally I hope both of these things work on classic as it adds another dimension of skill to the game, particularly for warriors who can taunt pets to break incoming Cc.
---
lol you might even think I'm wrong about priests being the master class but, the reality is you would always want me on your team. How many priests is gonna follow you around screaming. UNBOUND UNBOUND ARE MY MINIONS!! NARY FROST NOR FRIGHT SHALL TOUCH MY FLOCK!!! TEAR THE HERETICS LIMB FROM LIMB!! 
---
I mean I guess I can make the connection. Takes a few jumps though, from: Any real wizards? -&gt; No, I'm not a virgin -&gt; but apparently now he *did* become a wizard, turned a girl into a sheep and had sex with them. Maybe they lost their wizard powers because they broke a wizard law about using polymorph for weird bestiality stuff? I don't know. A lot to unpack in this story. 
---
Every class has a spec that can bear a rogue in 1.12. They suck in BG's outside WSG in a premade where they are meant to get a flag carrier druid to blow cooldowns.
---
They are still a lot of fun and the people who play them simply don't care. The bad people who are going to play them will all quit at 60 when they find out they are trash in BG's and that people actually use engineering/consumables now and realize that the dwarf racial and orc racial exist. 
---
As for the 30 minute thing - you‚Äôre right, you didn‚Äôt make that claim.
---
While checking on that, I also went through the rest of your rambling, stupid, pointlessly aggressive post and you spent the whole time implying that players in Classic are going to be doing raid content in a way that is similar to the current meta on private servers - which is most likely wrong. Private server players and 1.12 veterans will be an insignificant minority in Classic.
---
I hope you get paid for this. If not? LOL.
---
I haven't seen an ad on the internet in years. Block that shit.
---
Rets thinking they can be a contribution to a raid is delusional. A rogue in blues and greens will do more damage than a decked out pally in aq gear. 
---
A good guild would never allow a ret to raid, 39 people have to suffer because some asshole wants to autoattack? Guilds break up for far less. 
---
My first char ever was a gnome warlock on a vanilla p-server.
---
My future classic main:
---
Human Priest or Mage. (Roleplay server for sure)
---
Name is in progress.
---
Btw, looking for a guild. (EU) 
---
I get that as NA on a EU based server. If I don‚Äôt pvp on eu time I basically can‚Äôt at all. I‚Äôm more pve focused now but if it‚Äôs smaller server caps with same server bgs i might start pvp again. For me it‚Äôs all about the community. If it negates that I‚Äôm typically against it.
---
Sure, demo and not beta. The test. Sharding wasn't replicated wrong. It was added. They are on record as discussing how and if to use sharding. 
---
Anyway, I'm done. Apparently half of my argument is idiotic, unworthy of talking about, and not even feasible to do. Who knew that editing drop tables to make sure that items in UBRS aren't better than the one's dropped off of Rag was so hard?
---
I don't see that as much. Most of the consensus I've seen is that it has better class balance and pve. And a lot of people want tbc servers, too. 
---
My biggest complaint was that I didn't have the world pvp experience I had in vanilla. Still loved arenas, though. 
---
They're only using sharding at the beginning because they know the population will drop off dramatically after the first few weeks when everyone realizes how slow paced the game is. 
---
If you were in charge would you set up a massive server base that you know will quickly become unnecessary or use sharding as an interim solution to handle the release spike? 
---
Flying was bad.  
---
Arenas are a fun alternative to BGs and optional part of the game.
---
Smaller raid size meant less dead weight and easier to form stable guilds.
---
Old content always becomes irrelevant with game progression...MC gear gets replaced in AQ40 and Naxx, that's not a negative.
---
Camping entrance to ulduman.  Longest corpse run in game I believe.
---
Actually a majority of what he posted wasn‚Äôt specifically addressed at what you said. And the part where he mentioned the 30 minute clears (the part directed at you) - he says 30, 60, or 90 minute clears, so you took that out of context.
---
The general gist of his post was accurate, and your post was stupid, needlessly aggressive, and the parts that had a point were wrong.
---
Kek.
---
When you announce that you want to run a dungeon and you want have sole rights to a (typically a very rare, desirable) drop it makes you look greedy.  You expect others to put in the effort but not share in the reward.  Sure, maybe you don't need anything *except* the one item you're trying to reserve while the potential competitor might need everything else, but denying anyone the right to roll on a rare drop feels like a dick move.
---
If, on the other hand, you're advertising a group and you say, "LF heals &amp; RDPS for BRD", you don't need to announce that you intend on being the sole Ironfoe contendor and nobody needs to know.  If you need some MDPS and you get whipsers, at that point you can say, "Hey, I'm running this only for Ironfoe, all other drops are yours.  Cool?"  They can say yes or no.
---
I don't disagree that it's basically the same thing, it's just merely a matter of perception.
---
Ah shit, forgot my Amulet of Ghostspeak.
---
&gt;Publicly traded companies in America are legally bound to maximize shareholder value. This is slightly different in Europe.
---
I am in my last year of law school and recently took corporate law. Just wanted to note that (based on my understanding and experience) while this statement is true in terms of black letter law, but it is kindof misleading and/or could incite incorrect thinking. 
---
Here is an example off the top of my head: someone may read that sentence and think that Blizz-Acitivision are legally required to sell-out as hard as they can to increase the value of their shares, or that, since mobile presents such a lucrative opportunity in gaming, they are legally required to pursue mobile. 
---
This is not entirely true as corporate officers have a significant amount of independent agency, and may attempt to maximize shareholder value by implementing long-term and secure strategies etc. 
---
My point in bringing this up is that you shouldn't look at this and think that Blizz-Activision is tanking because they are legally required take steps that are alienating their fan base. 
---
Yeah, comminity in vanilla is everything. I disagree that smaller server caps aids this though.  I feel like the comminity is even more special on the big servers like nostalrius etc.
---
This is just subjective personal preff though. I'd actually love to see Blizzard implement different server caps. Have the 3.5k pop servers to be as close to vanilla as possible, then have medium size servers at like 6k pop, then megaservers at 8-10k pop. Caters to everyone then.
---
Isn't it funny how the people who actually played private servers and kept demand for this game alive are going to be the ones getting fucked when it comes out
---
Yes?
---
They work with the limits they have. They don't have earlier than 1.12 data. They can't bring back the whole experience of Vanilla from release until TBC dropped. So they don't even aim for that. Some people argue that that's not enough. Well. I think that's delusional. :)
---
I'm just happy they are bringing back Vanilla, as best as they can. MC might not will be exactly like it was in 1.1 but at least it'll be like it was 1.12, which is the best we can hope for.
---
Didn‚Äôt wowhead acquire them and copy the info over? I wish they left it as it was.

People so easily forgot how bad the first year or so of WoW was connection wise.

Personal loot is the greatest quality of life change that has ever been added. Fuck all the way off with your dkp and loot council. 
---
I wasn‚Äôt being sarcastic - as an objective observer he won and you lost the argument. I don‚Äôt usually cringe when someone beats me at something,
---
I remember there used to be a lot of grumbling on forums from mages because everyone‚Äôs tier 1 sets had fire resistance on them so in BGs raid-geared players routinely had a passive 60ish resist to fire which was enough to be annoying.
---
Pretty much this sub in a nutshell.
---
I was going to edit what I wrote but now I‚Äôm going to double down.
---
I‚Äôm no changes except for the addition of maxes.
---
Yes! Big chungus there is a reference to ol' sooty!
---
Best analogy for server sharding I've ever seen.
---
Only front edge progression guilds care about strict spec make up. MC farm runs can be nearly any spec and server pugs are common eventually. Once ZG is out, there will be server wide farm runs where any spec will do fine. 
---
It's more important to just have built a proper gear set per spec and have all of your consumables.
---
Players just need to use common sense. If a casual guild is trying to clear a raid with minimum outside help and aren't pushing consumable requirements or intelligent pre-bis setups then your spec becomes far more important. By this I mean something like a shaman or druid healing using a hybrid spec. The character with the better gear and intelligent game play will do better due to the common spectrum of skill and preparation in casual guilds.
---
Their network is been built around sharding. 
---
They are putting in cost saving measures in place in case Classic doesn't have enough players to pay for a dedicated support team. It's the reason why they are considering loot sharing and sharding but nothing is set in stone until the game releases or we have a beta.
---
Blizzard isn't going to release Classic only to lose money.
---
WoW: Classic is not going to be WoW2
---
Totally true regarding the loot.  The loot trading system will introduce some trades that wouldn't have happened, but it won't allow any that couldn't happened under the GM system we had in vanilla.  It just doesn't make a lot of sense to have someone manually check stuff the game can already automatically do.
---
I am very against sharding, but if it's allowed only in starter zones early on it's an understandable evil I can deal with.  Starting out an MMO is a shit show, so I understand why they are looking to ease up the initial rush, even if I am not a fan of the solution.
---
They scale with gear better than any other class 
---
Look up thot on urban dictionary
---
Ha! Excellent
---
Now that puts mmo into wow. May it be like that this Summer, without killing the hamsters that run the wheels of wow servers. 
---
It‚Äôs not like you get free gear once u hit 60...
---
Priest
---
PVP Heals (multiple specs) Hardest healer to play but the most ability to outplay people. Lots of tricks.
---
PVP DPS Shadow is the most OP caster in the game given how easy it is to play. Only SL Lock is close. It can run out of mana though in BG's. It's EXCELLENT in wpvp and as dwarf or Undead and even troll or human is one of the best 1 v 1 classes in the game. Don't be Nightelf though as shadow. It's a bad move.
---
PVE Heals Most ability to outplay people. The best priests, like tanks are the backbone of a guild
---
PVE DPS You probably aren't getting this spot. Don't bother. 1 priest per raid as shadow with 16 debuffs.
---
Rogue
---
PVP Good one on one, but not the best. EXCELLENT in wpvp due to being able to choose fights. Probably the worst class in BG's in a pug.
---
PVE second best melee in 1.12. In vanilla they were best melee until AQ and outgeared warriors by then so warriors really didn't catch up until late AQ Naxx. They are still very good, but pretty useless in a 5 man and getting pre raid will be hard unless you know someone or are very social. Reason? There will be lots of fury warriors tanking and they need a lot of the same hit gear, including leather pieces and same weapons. Warriors are a much better choice if pve is all you do. Can tank 5/10 mans as dps spec and guildmates will love you.
---
I played a hunter in Vanilla and I don‚Äôt remember people bringing that many hunters to raids. Of course, I didn‚Äôt raid much, so I‚Äôm not an authority or anything, but I remember hunters being brought more for trapping and kiting adds. And most comps only brought one or two hunters at most. For Horde (I played Ally in Vanilla), I always heard they would rather have a shaman in the melee group for WF totem. So even if it gives melee ap, which I don‚Äôt remember it doing, it still doesn‚Äôt sound like that big a deal. Also, 0/21/30 was viable in pvp as well and a lot more fun imo. So if you did both, you could use the same spec and not have to pay 100+ gold every week.
---
I get what you are saying. 4-5 years ago. I would be on your team. My problem here is that at this point. Based on every other thing they are doing. It is very clear that Blizzard is communicating in bad faith. They have made way too many moves this year. That show very clearly just how much the culture in Blizzard has changed. From we make great games. To hey we are a business.
---
My point is not that I do not share your opinion. My point is I believe Blizzard is being very disingenuous here. I think if we let them slip in sharding at all upon release. They will suddenly have reason after reason why they can't move it to the old server style. The change will never happen and, eventually the players they manage to keep will accept it. Blizzard wants sharding because from a business perspective it is better for them. That is what I believe and, it's not going to change unless Blizzard takes even one action to show that they are still themselves.
---
&gt;In vanilla, people didn‚Äôt all show up with flasks, and pots, and BIS gear. 
---
If you were in a progressive raiding guild then you 100% did have these every raid. Once a raid is on farm then you don't need all the consumables but if you are progressing then we used an addon to check that every player had the consumables in their bags.
---
People don't want off spec classes because they want to one shot everything and have no problems but the reality is that you have about 10 spots that can be filled with off specs and still clear everything. A good off spec is definitely better than a shitty main spec that stands in the fire but you can just kick the dumbass and get another that won't. That being said 10 more main spec players makes everything go that much faster.
---
The ability to use off specs starts to dwindle once AQ40 and Naxx comes out.
---

I remember doing a group quest in the barrens and it was for a escort for a elf or something. The respawn was ages and we waited and chatted and for the next week anytime I‚Äôd say something in general they would pipe up from out of no where or we‚Äôd run into each other. Not just in the barrens but a lot of places. Makes the world feel a lot better. 
---
lmfao what known bug exploit is this to allow paladin to hit like trucks? 
---
No. Only warriors, mages and priests are allowed to raid.
---
No hunter ever has visited a raid beyond BWL.

/s

This is the correct answer. Why would Blizzard try and maintain faction balance when then can just make you pay $30 to balance it yourselves.
---
I have yet to meet a person who contacted GM over a dungeon loot drop...

---
Calm down satan.
---
Of course it is. I don't see why you don't think it won't be. They'll maximize profits on this endeavor just like any other. That includes catering to the fanbase of classic.
---
Played a night elf hunter, really wanted the name Scribbles since kid me thought it was funny. It was already taken so of course I didn't give up but did what every1 did back then - add a z or x so I became Scribblz.
---
I loved and still love hunter because they have pets. Even if their spells sucked ass I'd still play hunter because of my animal companion. But on top of that they have a really fun class fantasy in classic, having traps and trackings. They are even really useful in vanilla! For example ice trap in dungeons or when hunting quest mobs and using your trackings. Felt so cool to be this hunter in the group tracking down monsters and leading the group.
---
Played my hunter from classic to Legion but this time I'm really trying to play something different and I'm most likely going to  play a prot warrior. I like leading my groups when doing dungeons and just the idea of having this big badass plate armor and a cool two handed weapon on my back for PvP sounds awesome.
---
Going from leveling with a hunter to a warrior is gonna be a drastic change lol. GL
---
Haha yep, I did try a warrior on Nost and made it to lvl 30. It's so much slower but still really fun especially in dungeons.
---
"Skinning a bear should aggro every bears".  I'd forgotten that gem.

       "Their network is been built around sharding." That is core to my point when I say they won't change it.

       "They are putting cost saving measures in place in case Classic doesn't have enough players to pay for a dedicated support team." This times a million goes directly to my point of Blizzard changed. Are you kidding me here they have fallen so god damn far from "we make great games" to "hey man we are just a business" That they won't even take a risk on a sure thing. The idea that classic wow could lose money is bannanas stupid. If you don't have stones to gamble on something as sure a thing as classic wow. You have no business stepping into the massive shoes of old Blizzard.

I did once. We had two people in the run with nearly identical names and they were both the same class. I gave it to the wrong one and had to contact a GM. Was fixed without an issue. 
---
I would say that 80% of what I see in this sub looks fondly upon TBC.  Most people admit that it was the beginning of the slippery slope to BFA, but still hail it as a good expansion.
---
You sir deserve more upvotes
---
If elemental wrath gear (Nature Wrath) is in game, it is more efficient to level as elemental. This also allows for far easier dungeon healing if you build a healing set along the way.
---
I literally just tested leveling a shaman as both Enh and Ele on a private pve server. An elemental glass cannon build using gobs of nature wrath gear and Int will do considerably more damage on average over Enh spec. Until you get +hit, Enh (and windfury) is subpar. Although, level with the spec you enjoy the most. I merely am here to reveal the how they truly play. Enh likely is better prior to wrath gear being in game.
---
DO NOT underestimate the power of Nature damage gear. Those green pieces are viable Pre-Bis slot alternatives over blue pieces you have to grind for over and over in dungeons ... just like +healing gear.
---
My current elemental shaman at level 52 has over 200 nature/spell damage (just a touch of +healing) and I just logged off grinding some level 50-51 mobs doing an average of 300+ dps, 600+ if a crit goes off, 1000-1500dps on 2 or more crits or if I purposely burst. I can kill 2-3 mobs in the time an equally geared Enh shaman can and can kill 6-8 mobs before drinking using my most efficient damage to mana attacks.
---
Due to Nature Wrath gear this efficiency is superior to Enh right out of the door but of course you need to obtain the gear (AH camping) but nature wrath gear is typically pretty cheap. If you go Enh, DON'T fall for the Windfury meme. Without +hit, your misses and glances mean NO Windfury procs. Rockbiter is your higher average dps choice for nearly your entire leveling path. One Rockbiter crit will likely do nearly as much as a windfury proc without crits anyway.

What do you mean ‚Äúonce a raid is on farm‚Äù? Curious 
---
No matter the stage in classic, rogues are one of the best 1v1 classes. 
---
In BGs thou, rogues are a lot less effective. You are less valuable in group vs group battles, because once you are out of stealth, you are like a fish out of water. You get kited easily, and you are squishy. 
---
You just have to play to your strengths. You are great at guarding flags, assassinating enemy flag carrier, and stealing objectives like bases in AB or towers in AV. 
---
People rolling rogue this time around thinking this is the world of the roguecraft of old will be in for a surprise. Others classes got much stronger by 1.12, making all fights more challenging. 
---
I get WoWhead whenever I level my gfs character.

As much as I loved those videos I will never get over how whiny Warlocks were. For how much Warlocks dominated mages (non UD ones anyways) I could never understand how delusional they must have been to think they were somehow so garbage that they're not even considered for the rock paper scissors
---
So the first time you are doing a raid, its called progression. Its new content that hasn't been totally worked out how your raid will do it. After you complete said raid a few times it becomes easier and easier as you get all the gear you need from it. When it is not longer producing any wipes and its pretty easy and everyone knows what they're doing the raid speeds up and its just "farming" because you need a few things from it for certain people or rare drops etc. 
---
So when you haven't beaten all the bosses in a raid yet, you are considered in "progression", meaning you expect people to be on their A game and listening to instructions/using full consumables/non meme specs.
---
When you have beaten the raid a few times and everybody has a little bit better gear and has the fights memorized, you are still running the raid to "farm" the rest of the gear for the players that didn't get it the first go around.  Since your team is reflexively better at the strategy and better geared, you can sacrifice using some consumables, or your shaman can go elemental spec or something.  Yeah it's not optimal but there's more wiggle room when everyone knows the fight.

Except those server transfers don't balance it, they do the opposite.

People get server transfers to move to high pop servers from bad servers, not to move to low pop imbalanced ones...
---
I'm just going to go wherever Moon Guard goes.
---
\+healing gear is vastly superior to increases HW cast time. Improved cast times on heals are a crutch in dungeons. Shamans have LHW for a reason. Only in raids do you need to worry about the best mana efficiency. Any spec for any healer can heal dungeons. Just need Int and +healing and a modest consideration of mana use. The greatest increase in mana efficiency comes from +damage and +healing gear (in their various forms). Healing is further enhanced by how good the mitigation is on your tank making +heal gear even better.
---
I've always thought the lore coming from WC3 pretty well-supported BElves joining the Horde. They were pretty staunchly anti-Alliance by the end of Frozen Throne as you mentioned, and like you said their relationship with members of the Forsaken (particularly Sylvanas) as well as their position in the world made allying themselves with the Horde a very sensible choice from a strategic standpoint.
---
What I *can't* justify in my mind lorewise still is the Draenei joining the Alliance. Even after their retcon it still seemed kind of strange. Personally I'm more bothered by the fact that their lore changed than I am by the fact that they joined the Alliance.

What would you want Blizzard to do exactly? Just curious what your solution is. 
---
You join a server, play for a month, all the tourists quit and go back to retail and you're stuck in a 75/25 server. How would you propose Blizzard prepares for this? 
---
It is extremely bloated and loads much slower than literally any other website I visit

I said Horde had better pvp racials, was same in classic and in TBC.
---
The rest of your comment isn't something I stated wasn't true, and yes Paladins were considered slightly better than Shamans. 
---
Camping the fuck out of soys and feasting on their tears. 
---
The real problem with lockouts is that they won't do jack shit. Retail players are going to quit, and its going to fuck the ratio in just about every server, even if you have a hard population lock at 50/50, two weeks later it could be 20/80. 
---
I had a gnome warrior named Tinkywinky with big pink hair and mustache. Loved killing people with that toon
---
Why is ele so bad at raiding but such a threat in pvp?
---
It was a tradeoff. The Horde seal made Ret damage good enough to justify taking one in a raid for their utility. The Alliance seal was amazing for tanking. However the difference between Rets was bigger than the difference between prots so Horde pallies were arguably slightly better off overall.
---
In some aspects, the streamlining was better. But I long for the days when I could play as a PVP Frost death knight with a gargoyle and howling blast actually winning a strand of the ancients match
---
Don't you see, your view is wrong. Anything that isn't 1.12 exactly isn't true classic.
---
Blizzard hasn't changed anything (Except all the things they did change... But we won't talk about that).

Fury warriors are going to be using swords, same for the highest dps rogues in classic, so humans are going to be doing more dps in general.  
---
ITT: people who don‚Äôt get the joke

That is what it's going to say across Blizzards tomb stone if they don't get their shit together.

---
i've played in top 20 private server guilds (so we cleared all content, just not that fast and not with the intent of speedrunning naxx or anything) with enhancement shamans, feral druid tanks, ret paladins, boomkins, etc. the only reason top end guilds care so much about comp in top-end guilds is so they can get the fastest clear time, and having a fury warrior over a ret paladin is going to be better for that.
---
99% of retail classic guilds will have multiple spots in a 40 man raid for shit tier specs, it really won't matter. the 1% is people speedrunning. anyone who refuses to invite a geared enhance shaman to their MC run when they have 39 other geared players is just buying into reddit/youtube hype about needing perfect raid comps and probably hasn't played the game extensively before.
---
That‚Äôs WHY Classic is great.
---
You must know your counters and pick your fights. Lock rekt druid, druid rekt mage, mage rekt warrior.... well everybody rekt warrior, unless warrior have pocket pally then he rekt everybody 
---
Fuck ‚Äúeveryone‚Äôs gotta be equal in wpvp‚Äù lol. It‚Äôs so much fun playing within the rules of classic, needing to know your opponent
---
The worst is ‚Äúwe made everything 50/50 and normalized your gear just mash buttons and you should get 50% win rate‚Äù that shit is boringgg
---
Yea nothing quite like having your spec balanced around kiting and then getting slapped with slow immune mobs that invalidate 50% of your kit
---
No one wants to play on a shitty PS
---
Blinging out your Gulch Pally Twink? Not without checking Thot.
---
First, just the official numbers left us at almost half of peak subscribers. But according to OP
---
&gt;"I then trained a regression SVM using all the keyword trends. The reported error is over a 5-fold cross validation." ... "The way to avoid [drop in correlation] is to use a holdout validation test"
---
I've never studied machine learning, googling these terms doesn't show any red flags, and the comment section seems to accept OP's justification for tests chosen, so I'm inclined to believe it. 
---
Lastly, the model's error is shown 2004-2015 &amp; it remains within the ballpark without systemic bias. It doesn't need to be definitive, I'm just saying that it's very reasonable that for the last 3 years, the overall path has indeed been a slow, downward trend. 
---
Twitch streamers are another issue. There will be cataclysmic population imbalance on whatever server Soda and the Classic Cast bois roll on. 
---
"NO CHANGES!" meanwhile they wont be goin back to their old pc, old modem, lack of knowledge, not use thottbot right away, mod right away, use things like reddit to organize, etc.
---
Whoa now, that smiley face is a classic! "I think that's delusional. :)" Nothing quite like baseless assertions, followed by insults, followed by that smiley face. It's great.
---
Almost all bosses have high nature resist, which makes them not viable by itself, but they also have no synergy with other classes and have no method of mana management. 
---
But they have the highest burst damage in the game bar-none which makes them cannons in PvP. They can obliterate a health bar every 5 seconds

I loved Scarlet Crusade. We were a small tight knit community. Small communities are great. Pservers need larger pops because of the different regions that play on them. When EU goes to bed NA needs a healthy pop to be able to do things without EU. In classic I assume there will be more than one server and servers for different regions. Because most people on a server will be in generally the same time zones or very close to it smaller pops are ok. 
---
There is a special place in hell for you.
---
Goddammit!  I corrected that ‚Äúfacials‚Äù thing to racials.  Oh well, I‚Äôll keep it unedited for comedy‚Äôs sake.
---
Everybody thinks this until you start playing TBC again and realizing, Jesus, it just wasn‚Äôt as good as I remember. 
---
I went through this phase, my buddies went through this phase, tbc has this awesome memory but simply doesn‚Äôt compare to modern day vanilla.
---
ramming everyone into one new area, allowing teleporting, flying mounts where you just get dropped on and rekt, or you have zero risk travelling around the world just fly up straight pick a direction and leave to go take a piss..... 
---
People like to romanticize TBC, I was one of them, but Classic is just so much better than TBC.
---
You just can‚Äôt beat classic. Goes downhill the moment TBC hits and beyond
---
That's a top 10 anime betrayal 
---
Not saying that smaller pop isn't ok, but the world feel so much more alive with more people in it. I just love that 
---
Some of the ads on Wowhead still get through my uBlock
---
Exactly the same private server experience here, so seconded
---
&gt; Hopefully there's a clever solution to this problem that I'm not seeing, because "Hope that the players end up balanced," even if it's statistically likely, isn't a good plan.
---
Well and the statistics can be tricky, as just because there's an overall 50/50~ split doesn't mean that split will be evenly distributed acros servers. I think you see that as well, as once any server starts to tip it will make people less likely to roll on that server in favor of the smaller faction. You see pretty frequently that when people look for servers they will sometimes ask people "Is it balanced, or is it in the favor of the faction I want to roll?" It's hard to control people. 
---
This is your opinion, which is fine.  But to say definitively that one is better than the other is dumb.
---
Are you a troll just here to trigger Classic pleople? If not what the fuck is wrong with you people???? Loot sharing is a major difference from contacting a GM for item transfer. In the Real vanilla without loot sharing 2 friends in a dungeon group wont Roll on each others item drops and contact a GM to Get it transfered. It is to much effort to Get the loot.
---
But in the loot sharing version everyone Will abuse this and it Will ruin the toghetherness feeling of vanilla Wow. If loot sharing is in Classic i Will be so dissapointed.
---
I dont Get Why everyone cares so much about the 2 weeks of sharding... it doesnt matter. Of course sharding is garbage but when its only the launch weeks who gives a shit. 
---
r/iamverybadass
---
Yeah it's particularly fun when the actual class you are playing is the worst of them. Not even speaking for myself, my class was fine in PvP. But your comment is very short-minded.
---
But it should be quite simple to get an add on.
---
How does the Fireball DoT do 60% of the damage of Fireball? Did it scale THAT well?
---
Absolutely. I didn't want to drag on the post much longer, but that's part of what I mean by "even if." The other parts being, I don't really think it's statistically likely in the first place and, even if it is, statistically likely for a given server means that one of the servers in the group is probably going to be unlucky.
---
I think the big issue with current WoW is that it's designed in a way that is not cost efficient. When they implement a new raid that content only really remains relevant for like 5 months. The content is designed to be expendable. I could see new content working if the developers shifted their focus to getting more out of less. Stop making old content obsolete!
---
Who is the worst of them. God help me if you think paladins weren't strong as a MF'er in classic.
---
Seriously don't listen to that kind of comment. They are in their private servers meta. at least 50% people won't give a shit about their meta and won't min max. See polls that have been done in this sub reddit. And keep in mind many people that will return are like you and won't have any clue more than in 2004-2006.
---
Ele cant keep mana for long PvE fights but can burst well for PvP.
---
IN what world? Ret pally still has cleanse. This is how classic pvp works. Dispel Magic&gt;Cleanse&gt;Everyone else. If your paladin knows how to use cleanse. A Ret pally out classes any form of shaman by a lot. Unless you are only talking about 1v1 pvp. Nothing in classic is stronger then ending the onerous 45 second long CC spells that abounded.
---
vid was nice btw, hopefully classic will have decent pre vs pre games and not just 99% pugs/dodges
---
Lottery really works the same way. You either win or you don't. 
---
Overall the feline swiftness talent is more useful than the shred talent if you plan to go 1/29/21 since 1v1 you'll be basically unkillable because you can kite melees and catch mages etc thanks to FS. It also helps flag carrying by giving you some more initial burst speed to rush through the middle field with sprint.
---
It all depends on style of play but I personally enjoyed maximizing the WSG flag carrying power and flag defense utility with FS + NS survivability.
---
This is the fun part of druids that they are actually really versatile and can support many styles of play.. Maybe I should still roll a druid again instead of a paladin..
---
You talking about warriors?
---
They had it shit till mid 40s, then they slowly get better until becoming one of, if not the biggest beast ever in PVP at endgame.
---
So you suffer early but if you‚Äôre in it for the long haul warrior is king.
---
Opposite if hunter, starting strong and finishing arguably closer to bottom of the pack.
---
There are ups and downs to every class friend but they all balance out in the end. That‚Äôs the beauty of vanilla. 
---
In pvp you don't need "extreme circumstances" to make the Ret pally op in group pvp. I'll tell you how to do it. Macro cleanse onto your key board on every bottom. Then slam your face into it. You will get a concussion but, free of the tyranny of CC your team will win/
---
After they‚Äôve progressed through the whole thing and killed the final boss, they will start to have an easier time on it. They‚Äôll start to gear up and then it‚Äôll be ‚Äúon farm‚Äù because it‚Äôs not challenging anymore it‚Äôs just a box they check off of things to do. You can start bringing some other not so hardcore guild members and just chill. 
---
I remember getting my shit rocked by rogues so many times leveling through to 60 on a pvpserver in TBC.
---
Thinking about going druid this time so I can both hide and do a little ambushing of my own later
---
I think almost ever player is against it but blizz doesnt want yo spend the resources on the GMs to deal with the tickets.  If it makes it live the best solution is having a strong guild and playing with them.  And if you want to PuG run yout own groups.  
---
part of it is the semantics of the word 'viable'.  you really have to define what people mean when they want their spec to be 'viable'.  some people seem to only take a narrow definition of viability to mean pve raid dps.  which is antithetical to classic in my mind, as i see every spec in wow classic as viable in one way or another.  raiding isnt the only content.  i mostly blame Ghostcrawler-era development (wotlk-mop) for giving this line of thinking an audience when WoW was meant to be a role playing game with unique classes, roles, and specs.
---
the other piece is the sort of raid leader culture. you say you can complete most of the 40-person raids w 25 competent people and that's probably true, but if you fill those last 15 slots w ret paladins or whatever, what does that say to those 25 people who showed up in a more raid-appropriate spec?  it's a sort of social contract to all put in similar amounts of effort or attitude.  while you *can* carry those 10-15 people, do you *want* to?  it's probably best not to worry about this too much, but hopefully you can see how some people could get their panties in a bunch over issues of fairness.
---
also, sometimes people just want to be douchebags on the internet and tell you how great they are at things.  i suspect this is a decently-sized portion of it nowadays.
---
You have to also consider the audience in this sub. Just by virtue of being here 6 months out from release asking questions and being curious you're going to get a skewed set of responses. Just like private severs have a higher average skill level than classic because people had to jump through extra hoops just to log in. These are all people who are more likely to want to be better. If people go into classic without the advantage of all the information that's out there and don't bring a reasonable raid composition then it's not really going to be trivial content to them. Everyone had to find out the hard way the first time now it's just those who chose to. 
---
Side note. I haven't raided retail, but I'd be interested in hearing someone's opinion on the difficulty between current raids and vanilla naxx. From someone whose done both. MC is absolutely a joke in terms of difficulty but naxx was truly another level with a lot of mechanics and different checks along the way. Meme specs will not see a lot of daylight there. But that's fine too, naxx isn't everyone's goal. 
---
I find the community is far more trustworthy, agreeable, and fair than these forums would have you believe. Ninjas won‚Äôt come out of the wood works strictly because loot sharing is an option. My 2c.
---
Even though playing priest has never really appealed to me, I still kinda want to roll one just for the glory of mind control
---
I said I was not speaking for myself. And I mained palret.
---
dont worry, historically alliance outnumbers horde about 2:1 (with exception of a small handful of servers). moderate faction imbalances actually make for a unique experience -- as long as it isnt 6:1 or something crazy it can be really fun to be moderately outnumbered.
---
the lore of the horde in classic wow was that they were the 'underdogs', and it was something that did a lot to contribute to faction pride.
---
Imagine if folks were forced to only use only the originally available resolutions.
---
It boils down to making sure you have the most efficient classes taking up raid slots.  Why take an enhancement shaman or ret pally when you can replace those slots with another rogue or warrior?  Why take an ele sham or boomkin when you can get another mage or warlock?  Shamans and paladins are much more effective to the raid overall as healers.  
---
Does this matter much for MC, ZG, and BWL?  Not really.  But if you want to push AQ40 and Naxx you are going to want to maximize your raid's efficiency, and bringing optimal specs of each class to raid is a big part of that.
---
&gt; I‚Äôll take an OOMKIN who is literally OOM than a dead mage in the fire.
---
In this example of course you want people to stay alive, but if your mage is dying a lot then it's the player that is the issue, not the class they are playing.
---
&gt; In vanilla, people didn‚Äôt all show up with flasks, and pots, and BIS gear
---
They absolutely did if their guild was any decent and they were pushing harder content like AQ40 or Naxx.
---
Id like to read some of this aswell
---
Till all the retail players vote to make leveling easier and vote for even more catch up mechanics or LFG or other terrible ideas.
---
Compared to retail mythic raids, anything will appear easy...
---
Summoning random people or people in your party to spots where they fall off cliffs or into lava was always a fan favourite. 
---
NE hunters can melds in neutral towns and slay horde with their pet.
---
The guy who got me into WoW played a Surv/BM hunter with a heavy emphasis on melee and rocked at WPVP. He'd do the normal shooting and kiting but whenever a melee class, managed to get to him, they'd be met with a bigass axe. A lot of melee classes think they've got an imminent victory when they close on a hunter and aren't prepared when one isn't trying to run away.
---
Give it to me daddi
---
Ah fuck that's brilliant!
---
tbc was ok, but inferior to the vanila... 
---
nerfing attuement quest chains and heroics wasn't best design decision... not to mention flying mounts killing world pvp as well as arenas... resiliance was also in retrospective bad idea (speaking as rank14 human paladin and orc warlock gladiator from tbc). I like resilance back then but when i think about it now ... it was just bad. 
---
People are confusing "viable" with "optimal". You can clear all raids with a handfull of "empty space" so that means that all specs are "viable", and longs as you bring a lot of optimal specs also.
---
Eyes of the beast doesn't break shadowmeld? Do the neutral guards not just murder the pet?
---
People will always do what they are invented to do. Under loot sharing, there is a stronger incentive to ninja loot than there was in Vanilla.
---
Lol don't take me too seriously I am basically the prophet of Cleanse and, Dispel magic. It's half of what I rant about on here lol. People trying to claim other classes is better then the Master class of priest. Or his mighty little bro the Pally. Are fools and, I intend of casting all of their sheepseses and, icey traps back into the nether from which they came
---
Wait until 6 to 12 months after release, and only allow accounts with a lvl 60 character to vote. That should keep the casuals away.
---
&gt;  In the Real vanilla without loot sharing 2 friends in a dungeon group wont Roll on each others item drops and contact a GM to Get it transfered. It is to much effort to Get the loot.
---
I mean, is it too much effort? One of the Nost devs did an AMA a couple weeks ago and he said that 1/4th of their GM tickets was about loot transfers. That's when they made the decision to just outright ban all loot transfering.
---
Rogues can attack someone or a pet in a neutral town, get them to fight back and flag themselves, and then vanish. They can also sap someone when the boat or ship arrives, causing them to miss it.
---
I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not alone!  HE WAS RIGHT THERE?!  How?!  How did I not see him?!
---
They said at blizzcon they will not touch the numbers or databases. So it‚Äôs most likely they will be in their updated form.
---
Explain?
---
When LFG appeared it was heralded as "WONDERFUL!" so no, democracy is awful. You can not trust a large group of people to make informed decisions. They will pick the easiest not the best. 
---
curious why you say +axe is 'obviously' for 2 handers?
---
there are several 1-hand axes that work just fine, are there not?
---
#teamnochanges
---
&gt; I know the classic developers have said they want to release a vanilla-like experience without all the vanilla-hassle, do we know yet if there‚Äôs quest tracking or no? I would both love and hate to run around blind in the barrens again
---
If there's a mod (or 12) for quest tracking folks want to use, more power to 'em.
---
If that shit's integrated into the game Blizz dun fucked up. I want to have absolutely no idea where my quest objectives are beyond quest text describing how to get there and my own fuzzy memories. As it should be.
---
I mean, is it really too much effort?
---
One of the Nost devs did an AMA a couple weeks ago and he said that 1/4th of their player tickets were about loot transfers. That's why they made the (unblizzlike) decision to outright ban all loot transfering.
---
Excellent! I never even thought about the boat/ship sap thing, that is delightfully devilish 
---
When I down a foe in honorable combat I give them a /salute.
---
When someone rushes past me while I fight the last three mobs in a tower and ninjas my chest I favor them with a /sigh.
---
If the zeppelin arrives and I see people AFK near it on the dock I like to do /cheer and /train to make a lot of noise so I can hopefully grab their attention.
---
Question will also be, do ppl actually want balanced servers. I know quite a few ppl that actually moved to 90%-10% servers because they wanted to dominate a server. I reckon that some players want balanced, but that there also is a big group that probably wants to dominate their server.
---
Also i don't think its only retail players that will quit, a lot of players will quit quite fast after launch i reckon, not only ppl playing retail. 
---
I always love this!  Warlocks are mushrooms.  Still cracking up.
---
I almost prefer less people. Makes it feel larger and less crowded. Plus, you know the people in your faction and brings everyone together. Makes your friendships more meaningful.
---
The system works well for old school RuneScape.
---
I've always wanted Sulfuras on my shammy. Hands down the coolest looking weapon in the game in my opinion.
---
Honestly. I'd rather have a meme spec than another of my own class to compete with for gear.
---
The thing I thought was funkier about p server raiding was the main spec priority rules. Want to go dagger, but you have two amazing swords? Best put them in your bank and do less dps unless you want to hear "sorry, you are a sword rogue". Saw the same happen to "healers" who weren't even resto, just healing because the raid needed it.
---
I would make sure I can roll on specific items before agreeing to join a raid just to avoid those kind of scenarios
---
&gt;Thoughts?
---
3-5  months of leveling is not for everybody
---
5 hour BRD runs that fall apart just before the Emperor  (and you REALLY want that Hand of Justice trinket) are also not for everybody.
---
This doesn't even mean they don't like it,  it might just mean that they don't have the time to play for more than 1 hour at a time. 
---
I haven't played retail since 2008, I love the grindy character of vanilla, but even I have to take extended breaks from raiding in vanilla because I can't dedicate 4 hour long evening play sessions a few times a week for an longer period of time.   And I don't have children. 
---
I'll have to look into that. I am vaguely familiar with OSRS, but is it supposed to be a faithful recreation of how old runescape was or is it a new game in the style of old runescape? I see a fundamental difference. One is a reivial of an old game and the other is a brand new game. Classic is supposed to be a recreation. I don't want to see it evolve the same way a new game evolves because that just leads to the current retail. 
---
I'd agree that it's about 90% your last sentence.
---
This got patched. We used to summon super annoying people to the giant cliff in Hyjal. But I remember they changed it so you couldn't do this anymore but I don't remember when.
---
We don't know, but it would be the dream for many players.   And Blizzard will follow the money.
---
There are several unused zones on the vanilla map + Caverns of time.      Enough potential.

There is already a classic version of Wowhead, and it doesn't look like Thottbot. It's incomplete though as they work on it leading up to classic release. They did tweet a graphic a fan made with Wowhead written in Thottbot font, but that might have just been a joke or for hype
---
Not really black and white. People are incentivized to using flying mounts... sure. I disagree that having the option to screw over other players will make me or others WANT to screw over other players. There are a lot of cons to being a total asshole in an MMORPG. Being straight up kicked from guilds, group content, friendships. In true vanilla fashion people will remember you.
---
I have over accidental rolls and ninjas.
---
Commenting and saved
---
Ulduar
---
Loot sharing may make dungeons like SM Arm and UBRS a shit place as those few ninjas that also happen to have a friend pull some toxic shit.
---
But once you're passed the early levelling and preBIS gearing phase, it'll be nice to have around for when your guild's ML fucks up.
---
Maybe Loot Trading should be restricted to raids only.    
---
Or even scrapped for Classic altogether.
---
But assuming that it's here to stay and that you're planning on sticking all the way to Naxx.    
---
Then the negative side of Loot Trading is really only going to affect your gameplay for a relatively short amount of time.
---
In a similar way that levelling is only a small fraction of the Classic content.
---
But then you don't alt tab back with a night elf hunter camping your body
---
&gt; but if you fill those last 15 slots w ret paladins or whatever, what does that say to those 25 people who showed up in a more raid-appropriate spec? it's a sort of social contract to all put in similar amounts of effort or attitude. while you can carry those 10-15 people, do you want to?
---
Hits the nail on the head for me. I can‚Äôt stand the attitude of ‚Äúif you can clear it with 39 players, you can clear it with this deadweight enhance shaman!‚Äù for this exact reason. 
---
If it makes you feel any better, I was corpse camped numerous times for doing this
---
Ublock origin and r/pihole
---
Lol this fucking guy 
---
Because that‚Äôs not a ‚Äúret‚Äù thing. It‚Äôs just a paladin thing. If a paladin is trying to kill me, he‚Äôs usually not cleansing. Which is why, in groups, ret tended to be pretty subpar. 
---
Additionally, when casual or semi-hardcore guilds start to progress in aq40/naxx, alot of people will fall off the bandwagon due to the effort needed preparing for those progress raids. Its a lot of farming and money, and most (except for the really hardcore) guilds will lose a lot of members. All of a sudden getting 40 people to attend each raid will be very difficult, and guilds will start to bring along people in meme-specs and shitty gear just to fill up their raids. A decent oomkin with battle rez is better than an empty spot or bringing the 14th rogue in.
---
2+ mid 20s hunters. AoC is one of the earliest strongest movement speed enhancers, and you can attack from massive range. Hunters take turns engaging and running away, you can harass the opposite faction levelers easily.
---
&gt; TBC [...] delivered the best version of class mechanics, raid mechanics, and itemization that the game has ever seen imo.
---
Agreed. *Mechanically,* TBC was solid gold from beginning to end, more or less.
---
Flavor-wise, however, OP is absolutely right; TBC sowed the seeds of virtually all the changes to come that ultimately killed WoW as an RPG.
---
My hope is Blizz eventually figures a way to take inspiration from the good parts of BC and WotLK while still keeping to the Classic style. That said, if I have to choose between a rich, flavorful RPG with shaky mechanics and no balance to speak of or an artfully balanced mechanical masterpiece that makes tofu taste like chocolate cake by comparison, I'll go with the FASA RPG every time.
---
Without starting another dumb thread for this type of question..
---
I want to play a rogue since I never have (played classic through wotlk) but it‚Äôs been so long. 
---
What raid utility do they bring? Are they a desirable dps? 
---
Burst like *crazy* when it goes right. And it goes right pretty often compared to other classes. They can also off heal really well in a pinch.
---
They have two main weaknesses in pvp. One, getting locked down and not being able to get away to cast (shocks and teammates and well timed heals help a lot here) and two, not having a real incapacitating CC. But if they have space to cast, they are nasty. They also oom a lot, but everyone did in vanilla.
---
My very first character was a NE Hunter which I only got to about level 30.
---
I tried a bunch of different alts but after seeing some Rogue Stun Locking videos I decided to roll a Dwarf Rogue and stuck with it all the way to 60.
---
I did a few MC raids with it but trying to play a melee class with 600ms was impossible.
---
So I rerolled an UD Mage on the new Oceanic realms. Which I played all the way through to Cata.
---
I've since played a NE Druid and Dwarf Priest to 60.
---
-
---
I'm currently leaning on the idea of playing a Mage again.
---
But playing a Priest has been so nice. Just because there's much less competition for tier pieces.
---
If I do make a Priest again I'll definitely make a Mage alt.
---
Hmmmm......
---
Well, if that's the case then we're going to be seeing R14 items that are as powerful/rivaling Naxx gear before AQ is even out. 
---
Now, considering how time consuming it is to reach rank 14 I doubt that this will break the game, we're not going to see hundreds of people running around with it, but it does make me a bit nervous. 
---
They only care about the gear that is for hunter. All the gear.
---
Since each boss in MC only drops 2-4 items it takes awhile for 40 people to all get geared up. Imagine that 1 boss (Say boss 2) drops a must have DPS caster item. If you have 10 casters in your raid, you will need to kill that boss at least 10 times to get the loot for each caster. HOWEVER, each boss has a loot table of like 6 to 10 items it can drop when killed, so you won't always get that DPS caster item every kill. So maybe your guild would have to kill that boss #2 20 times before each player has that caster item.
---
 I don't know how true it will be in classic, but in 2005 progress (in general) looked something like Week 1: Boss #1. Week 2: Boss #1 and Boss #2. Week 3: Boss #1 and Boss #2 and Boss #3. And so forth, so by the time you were at boss #8, you killed boss 1 8+ times.
---
When a guild is ready for the next tier in content, like BWL, it doesn't mean the guild should stop clearing MC. Remember, all those DPS casters could really use that 1 cool DPS item that Boss #2 drops. Now that the guild can clear all the bosses in MC, it becomes a matter of practice and perfection of strategy when you run MC. And each week you run it, you get better at it because A) You have more l33t gear (some pieces from BWL in your raid too) and B) your guild is pretty well practiced in how to defeat MC. 
---
And so you can consider MC on "farm" when the content is run for specific upgrades for players and/or new members, but the difficulty of the raid has become trivialized due to the gear level of the raid and the experience level of the raid in that zone.
---
The joke is that the "obsolete" server architecture Blizzard is so afraid of investing in is cheap as all hell by now.  Private servers have revealed a lot of bullshit, haven't they?
---
I want to try meme spec raids because it'll be well... fun. Like, just get a whole bunch of ret paladins and smite priests, stack JotC and do the thing. Sure, if it doesn't work it doesn't work (and if it does then that's pretty awesome) but I'm more concerned with having memorable experiences with the game than anything else.
---
You're not the only one, lol. Hell, even I, a fellow rogue, would get jumped from time to time. 
---
Population imbalance for sure, but I wonder about the faction imbalance. It doesn't seem immediately obvious to me whether the majority of viewers would roll on the opposite faction or not.
---
&gt;There are a lot of cons to being a total asshole in an MMORPG. Being straight up kicked from guilds, group content, friendships. In true vanilla fashion people will remember you.
---
And yet there was still ninja looting in Vanilla (albeit it was pretty rare). Interestingly, it became more common once paid name-change was a thing.
---
My point here though is that there will be marginally more ninja looting because people have a stronger incentive to do so than they did previously. It's a pretty basic truism.
---
As long as you still feel that way when 3 of the homies ninja your BiS. 
---
They will get shitlisted publicly.  Just like they did in vanilla. 
---
I wish I could quote every elitist asshole to this comment everytime they show up.
---
I mean - it‚Äôs easy to be snarky but I don‚Äôt see you refuting anything he‚Äôs saying.
---
On a similar note, grouping with people asking for help in world pvp. Met a lot of people that way when leveling
---
Fuck, havnt seen that one in a while!
---
/Moon is by far the best emote
---
Warriors are not near as bad as anyone else made them out to be. In fact they are pretty damn strong specifically if you have a good weapon
---
Well... It was also a different time right? I mean information wasnt as readily available as it is today. There wasnt a curse gaming website to get addons... There werent prevalent content creators outlining builds and showing footage... You had text based forums similar to Reddit, just as you mentioned the WoW forums. Just look at these forums as an example... How accurate is the entire body of information? Its awful. You have a couple of people who know what they are talking about and then an overwhelming amount of people talking out of their asses or people with an emotional investment in their argument. There wasnt really any data mining and combat logs only became a thing in the final portion of Vanilla leading into BC. The reality is that people were influenced by a VERY small minority of famed players who wielded a CRAZY amount of influence. Swift inspired an entire generation of warriors to play as Fury. Sure you had arms warriors in PvP but after Swifty became a thing, you seen an over representation of Fury given their poor performance in PvP compared to an Arms warrior. This was the same for enhance shamans after the unbreakable series. On my grind to 13 I seen a HELL of a lot more enhance shamans than I ever saw ele and look at their power! Ele might just be the most consistently bursty spec in the game. It was a different time and thats exactly why no one can relive it. If you want authentic vanilla, you would need a time machine.
---
EXP boost to the faction with less players if the population drops to a 70/30 ratio.
---
the advantage of frost is that the mobs never reach you. I think frost is vastly easier than fire for leveling.
---
I understand it though. Unless people are loud enough blizzard usually won‚Äôt listen.
---
If you do roll a druid, you should try root someone under water. You'll be safe in aquatic form.
---
I tend to have very average players in my guild in Retail. Since we are a casual guild that also happens to raid. 
---
MC with those average folks, with 1.12.1 gear will not be difficult. 
---
At most we will have a few wipes as people learn. Just like we did with Heroic Kin‚ÄôGaroth or normal G‚Äôhuun. Both of which are substantially more complex than anything in MC. 
---
Tru fax yo.
---
(It is funny that you bring that up. I was thinking the same thing myself the other day.)
---
Very nice, onetime I was walking around them I got ganked the end.
---
Its when you shift your focus from obtaining levels to obtaining gear to continue progressing your character. They dont literally mean you ding 60 and become super strong
---
In 2005 I too rolled an Undead Rogue, Dagothloki (I had just got done playing Morrowind and liked Norse mythology) on Arthas US (this wasn't my first character, though, I rolled a Warlock on an RP server, didn't like how it played and learned I couldn't PvP on an RP server, so switched it up). 
---
Playing a rogue again, even though it's "the same" I'm not as absent minded as I was 14 years ago, at least I like to think so, so I'm going to "right" a lot of "wrongs" I did while playing back then and enjoy the nostalgia while it lasts. 
---
But I do plan on playing alts and actually leveling them to 60, instead of abandoning them ~30 like I did back then too....
---
Dude people like us that really love the MMORPG part of wow are in the minority compared to the dungeon crawlers players now days. People just dont play for the same reasons anymore. They want instanced content that gives you the "best" part right away and it better all be balanced or people will get offended 
---
Yikes issa no from me dog .
---
I remember not knowing alt tab and exiting game looking up something, getting back to game, and not remembering what I looked up. Then I exit out of the game, Thottbot it, write it down, and re enter the game. It‚Äôs amazing I ever max level. 
---
Spent 2 hours as ele fighting a ret across stv. Not one death. 
---
My single favorite memory from wow. 
---
Big plans
---
Thinking back on how I played my rogue is very bad lol. I went for a haste build with crit. So I could pump up my attack speed 200% with CDs but no hit rate meant a lot of those didn‚Äôt land.
---
Its not dumb because its obvious that is his opinion and it should go without saying. 
---
There one of the top dpses i know that by info even though i havent played. But theres alot of them so there might be more competition but dont worry about dps
---
I believe there were a ton of vanilla quests that had minor errors like this.
---
Is this where we make exaggerating posts?
---
That's another thing to consider, I don't really know. I'm not sure if Classic will even have enough servers available to be able to offer a server that is severely off balance. We might only have like 10 servers split between all the different types. 
---
Hunter popularity is kinda odd.They show up in high number on various server censuses, you'll see tons of random ones out in the open, but generally when you are actually lookin to group with other humans for 5mans and raids hunters are often scarce. The non-alt non-farmbot hunter population actually seems about right for the high end demand of the class, so I wouldn't worry too much about raid spots.
---
Actually the tactic was to get within range of fire blast dismount and cast followed by slow fall. In almost every occasion they will die from the fall damage. Flying also made corpse camping easier btw people forget that. As a mage I could literally force a player to get a gy Rez if I wanted to secure a grind spot. This is how broken world pvp was and yet another reason why I quit the game. The flying was great for the first day or two, then all the flaws became very obvious 
---
All the graphics, UI and stuff like that should be upgraded to modern day, while keeping original items and content alone.
---
draenei are aliens, does not make sense for them to have a connection to the elements
---
Even the easiest levels of mario are failed if you try playing them using a banana as a controller.
---
No, don't link the dude playing dark souls on a banana.
---
No
---
RIP Fear ward ;(
---
That's not loot sharing, that's lootmaster.  
---
This post has no specific complaints. What exactly about the UI is so much worse? 
---
All of the large private servers have close to a 50/50 split (according to their own statistics) which is a good sign, I think. 
---
I remember you! I played a noobelf rogue called Timy! 
---
If you are interested by druid tank, you should read this : https://www.dkpminus.com/wow/guides/taladrils-treatise-on-druid-tanking-in-vanilla/
---
Also feral can get high dps alliance side with power shifting but it take a lot of effort to come close to the top (but it's possible), you can look for shedo for that.
---
In a podcast with the pirates of the pancreas trolls, they brought up druids and entangling roots to drown people. Hide out in aquatic form anywhere where a quest has you swimming deep underwater, and when people try to go up you root them and watch them drown.
---
That's the most retarded comment I've ever read here 
---
&gt; I dont Get Why everyone cares so much about the 2 weeks of sharding... it doesnt matter. 
---
Just wanna comment on that:
---
Blizzard never said sharding will only be used at launch. They have never said they will not use it as permanent feature whenever needed... That's why people care about sharding and that's why people are worried. They have never talked about 2 weeks either, what they have said is "especially at launch and in the early zones".
---
Your income will scale linearly just like the investment will (as a function of alts).
---
It can essentially boil down to, do you expect 70g/week to net you more than 48 hours of farming, it will at some point, but that point is very far in the future.
---
I think the fact that tier gear drops makes every class viable. Otherwise guilds would take much longer to gear up 
---
Farming the materials yourself doesn't impact profits at all.
---
Lolol
---
Fun fact: 
---
Allakhazam data was extracted to make private server item databases. 
---
This comes from Ludmilla and wademu days. I have no idea what emulators they are using today. 
---
The more you know!
---
And then theyll namechange and be golden.
---
Damn this has got to be my favorite one so far, it's like you're roleplaying as some horrifying deep sea monster
---
Aggrael said " I have yet to meet a person who contacted GM over a dungeon loot drop... " and I said that I did once. I guess its a raid drop but raids are dungeons. 
---
Aren't the Classicast ppl trying to solve that by having Staysafe and Esfand go Alliance and Tips go Horde on the same server? Then again i don't know if the Classicast ppl are going to make that much of a impact. I'm seeing quite a big of negativity going to them at times from ppl on the sub (and other subs) and i also think their audencies are relatively small when compared to ppl like soda or asmon. 
---
I dont have a solution , but Paid realm transfers can be pretty harsh on the community as a whole. You can ninja all the gear you need then transfer to another server where you aren't blacklisted. Top guilds can poach thunderfury tanks from other servers. Generally people will just act poorly and less friendly when they can switch communities on a whim.
---
I mean.... ele shamans do one shot people.  Can‚Äôt cleanse something that‚Äôs dead.  This is coming from an alliance only perspective too.  Rets are good, but let‚Äôs be real here... if your holy pallies and priests are relying on your ret to cleanse then something has gone wrong.  
---
So for one i find the targetting system while healing horrible. But i suppose its many things. Mostly that were fixed with add ons in 1.12 like raid frames/health bars/ threat/etc. 
---
Features people had from add ons blizz had added into their basic UI at some point. 
---
Yea. Thats a no from me, partner.
---
Locked. Private server mentions/discussions are not allowed. 
---
Thiccbot
---
Stories from my last private server hunter: not particularly good, but I thought they were a little funny.
---
Any time someone falls for feign death is pretty funny in my book, especially when my pet is still standing around like a doofus. I got ganked by a 60 while I was 45 in ferlas, and I pulled a FD. He stood right over my corpse killing my pet that was attacking him, and then ran off. Managed to save myself a 15 min corpsewalk.
---
Another time, I saw a gnome accidentally pull three mobs in tanaris while he was already at half health. Definitely looked like he was going to die, so I figured I'd be nice and help. I pulled off two mobs and he managed to kill the last one with a shred of HP left. He gave me a /thanks, so I tabbed off to target him with a /wave... but forgot to cancel auto shot. Shoots for a crit while I'm typing, killing him instantly. Well, at least I tried...
---
This video was made during a time where warlocks were actual trash though.  Their tears were justified at this point in time 
---
A paladin can divine intervention an ally in the middle of a horde city and they have 3 minutes of mocking before it wears off.
---
I‚Äôm not sure if you could dance in the safety bubble though. 
---
This was fixed quite quickly, but in the early patches of vanilla as a priest the improved power word shield talent reduced the weakened soul duration from 30 seconds down to 15 rather then increase the amount absorbed.  You could also bubble any friendly target regardless of them being in a group with you or not.  Priests would sometimes grief another priest when they pulled too many things and were frantically running away trying to survive by hitting them with a rank 1 shield that gave them 30 seconds of weakened soul. 
---
Hunter Alliance NA PvP
---
Looking for a guild with raid times starting at 7pm ET, twice a week (mon-thurs preferred). Mature audience preferred, no racist barrens chat bullshit. 
---
I'm looking to be a core member of the raid group to secure my spot as a hunter through progression. 
---
I'll be going engineering most likely for those reliable jumper cable rezzes. 
---
I love pvp and am looking forward to mastering my class as best as I can in the off time. 
---
*asks question out of genuine curiosity*
---
*gets downvoted*
---
I love this community 
---
Well guess that sums up my warrior or rogue class decision.
---
Yea...nope. 
---
As a backstab rogue I stacked attack power and AGI, but didn't pay much attention to hit in my pre-raid gear. Fortunately the tiered sets come with it so I was in the clear once I started raiding, well, with the second raid guild I joined in mid-late 06.....
---
Never heard of pihole before, will look into it. Ublock origin doesnt do anything for the loading time as every visit for quite a while has been with the extension installed and on.
---
I remember stalking around Ironforge/SW with a few friends, going back and forth through the deeprun tram. At one point, I got separated from the rest of my group while running away from Alliance and had to wait for the next tram. I kited alliance around the room, missed two different arrivals because I was on the opposite side, and once I finally got on one of the carts, another alliance player followed me on. I was both a caster and pretty awful at the game, so now that I was forced to fight someone one on one and in melee range I was basically done for. When I was less than 25% health and the tram was probably less than halfway through, the rest of the group was finally able to get out of combat long enough to summon me. I sighed for relief when the prompt came up, and smugly typed /wave before hitting accept. That poor alliance got absolutely murdered when they finally arrived on the other side.
---
My memory is not that good,  I have been playing in vanilla 2005-2006  and more recently on several  pservers.    I still cast my shadow bolts when mobs have reflection on  :D  (examples include Major Domo adds, and various Aq40 trash mobs...)  luckily healers are so good these days, they can take care of a clumsy warlock.   
---
At least I seem to have mastered the art of dodging Deap Breath.  
---
It seems that my head has only space for a certain amount of boss fights,  maybe 25 or 30 or so.  But if we include the 20 man raids, I now  have to remember something like 1+ 5 + 10 + 10 +8 + 8 + 12 == 56 , not counting outdoor world bosses, which I ALSO always misremember despite killing them quite often.    I guess there is a reason I play ranged dps, haha..    
---
Mages can sheep or R1 frostbolt an enemy faction member who is trying to flee from multiple mobs. This often results in a durability loss death.
---
Warlocks and priests can fear enemy faction members into hostile mobs.
---
Anyone can hit a leveling warrior with one tick of a linen bandage during combat so he has to wait to bandage after the fight.
---
There are so many ways to mess with an AOE grinding mage (and I've suffered them all). Warrior or priest who uses fear to disperse the pack. Warrior who hamstrings one mob so it breaks from the pack. Rogue who kidney shots me during blizzard. Other mage who blizzards the pack I'm rounding up before I can tag them. Other mage who sheeps me mid-kite. AOE mage is very vulnerable to "friend" and foe alike.
---
Twinking will be alive and well in classic, as it is on private servers. 
---
yeah I tried that while soloing Sunken Temple as a lvl 60 warlock, but the 5 minute cooldown means you can't rely on it for trash pulls, or you would be there all day.   It is very nice on some boss fights.   But I was not able to clear as much as I thought I could do, maybe I am just bad these days or I had other gear in 2006 
---
Yeah I knew it was something to do with a mage and slowfall lol. Is it just the damage unmounted them? So other classes could do it but only a few could survive it. Has been a while heh
---
People won't balance though. People will go for the ones that start to appear high pop (as insurance against drop off)  . . . Only it'll be really clear which will be high pop, meaning a handful of massively crowded servers and then a load that are DOA
---
yep pretty much, if you didnt have a slow fall you would also die but you still got the HK, 
---
Pihole blocks at the DNS level. It's a cool project and goes well with browser blocks. Also, if you use chrome, you might want to consider changing. Google announced they ate going to be crippling ad blocker extensions. Pihole at home is cool. My mobile apps no longer have ads
---
Blizz still won't listen even if we are loud enough. BFA forums were calling the expac a mess for *months*, then they deleted them and said "What feedback?" 
---
Loot sharing has already been given an explanation and isn't going to change, as much as I want it to. Sharding is still up in the air but Blizzard is going to make their decision based on technical issues, not what the players want.
---
Ouch all that AOE mage interference sounds brutal. Do most of those cause you to die or just have to run away?
---
No you are right a Shaman once in a blue moon can implode someone. So can just about every other class. That isn't not unique to their tool kit. I do agree with you as well Holy Pally &gt; Ret Pally. All of that being said I can tell you from horde side. You only have priests to dispel cc. I can also tell you as a priest mainer who basically has an orgasm every time he casts dispel magic on a CC'd allie. I spend most of my time as a sheep lol. I would love for a bubble boy to help me bear this burden lol.
---
If you are doing normal/heroic raids you are not an average player. If you clear heroic raids you are far above average, probably in the top 10 or 20 percent of players. Because retail is so antisocial it's easy to end up in an echo chamber where you think you are an "average" player. 
---
If you want to experience the "average" retail WoW player - go attempt LFR on Sunday night sometime. Or que for a few heroic dungeons shortly after a new patch/xpac etc. Its actually hard to differentiate the people who cant even do basic mechanics and the people who are trolling. Its also important to remember that even though retail content usually has several "mechanics" per boss - many of these can be safely ignored or defeated with a cooldown or a mobility skill sub-mythic. 
---
The handful of these people persistent enough to make it to 60 (like 6months - 1 year in) are going to form gigantic cesspool guilds on every server that sit stuck at MC/BWL/Ony for all time. For them, the basic but unforgiving mechanics will be "hard." 
---
Honestly, if an opposing faction player does pretty much anything to you it fucks over AoE pulling. If you‚Äôre leveling through AoE farm you often need 90-100% of your mana pool to clear the pack and Mages are entirely too squishy to be hit by a big pull, even once.
---
What Bioware did during SWTOR beta is a better plan IMO, but I don't think Blizzard will do something like this.
---
They had a guild program on the beta forums several months before launch.
---
Guild leaders could create their guilds and recruit. They had to specify their faction, server type of their choice and an optional list of guild allies and enemies.
---
Players could create their main char, choosing names, race and class, and they could apply to a guild.
---
At launch each guild was assigned a server, taking into account balancing factions and possibly keeping together allies and enemies.
---
Nothing was mandatory of course, but if leaders created their chars on the assigned server, their guild was automatically created and given to them.
---
Also members who created their chars on the server, were asked at login to join the guild without the leader/officers intervention.
---
He's partly right. 
---
Arms needed healer, fury could stand well on their own 
---
Oh you all mock and, laugh at me now but, when I am on my priest astride my mount. Dispelling all of my allies woe's. People going to see me riding up like. "I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him."
---
Where are all the skeletons?  I would expect there to be a fair amount of skeletons littering the ground for a first time kill.
---
I would prefer blizzard making the same decision. - Blizzard saves their money to Get more Ferraris
---
- Nobody ninjas with Extra Rolls from friends and transfers items Because its not possible
---
- some loot mistakes gets made and some of os gets annoyed and salty but seriously it is worth it in my opinion. It happens so rarely Why even Care .. 
---
its not like its a MAJOR catastrophy If a loot mistake gets made.
---
Hm, dilemma for me. Not being able to trade the loot ruins immersion somewhat, since it makes sense if you can, but if it goes against Vanilla design philosophy, then it will impact the experience in ways we can't fully predict.
---
NO CHANGES
---
Whatever happened to un-mediocre? He got sued by Blizzard and stopped making the flash games but I haven't seen anything new from him in a while.
---
An excellent question.  One that I don't have an answer to.
---
My guess (I cannot recall from all those years ago) is that we raided on a Wednesday, failed to kill him, and then returned on Thursday to one-shot. 
---
That sounds probable to me, but I honestly cannot recall.
---
Don‚Äôt even need eyes just sick your pet on someone.  The guards will kill the person when they attack your pet and try to kill your pet but it will bug out cause you‚Äôre invisible so they will stop and reset.
---
I did it with a cat so he could stealth as well but I‚Äôm sure it works with any pet.
---
i've been doing my best to stomp out "you need a raid consisting of 30 warriors, rogues, mages, and priests with an exact balance of the other classes" sentiment, because it really just isn't true outside of the people doing [sub-90 minute Naxx.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OL7s_H5xBik) Which I still have a shitload of respect for, those players are all dedicated and great at the game. Unfortunately, other people apply this guild's (and other guilds like its) standards to their 8 hour per week casual raiding guild (hypothetical or not) and it leads to other people thinking they won't be able to do MC if they pick a druid. 
---
a lot of misinformation about classic that needs to be wrangled in a bit, imo
---
So two problems with this. The first is that it only works on super dedicated players, a small percentage of us. Most people won't fill out the survey, and if it is made mandatory (which is a bad idea), they still won't choose to look at the results and adjust.
---
The second problem is that your acting under the assumption that people would use this to self-balance, when if anything they'll use it to create the imbalance. It'll almost certainly create at least 4 to 6 servers with &gt;80% dominance by one faction.
---
I raided a ton on a private server until recently so I feel like I should know but now that I think about it, maybe one of the graphical settings being lowered stops the corpses from rendering on the client to improve framerate.
---
I had a veryyyyy similar encounter like this when i stumbled into Azshara with Azuregos walking around. Will never forget the feeling of danger and awe that added to the game for me.
---
I almost abandoned my druid, who ended up being my main forever, because I couldn't find the cave for the bear quest. Stupid young me misread east as west and was hunting in the water.
---
Fortunately, the next character I made was so blessed ugly that I came back to the druid after 15 levels on a lock. 
---
Um what?
---
Why?
---
Sounds like a rogue that lost all his rolls to a hunter.
---
Mind controlling people off the Thousand Needles lift.
---
No, my point is that loot sharing is the system of being able to trade items with other people in the group without limitations for 2 hours. That created a community of premades all rolling on the item, technically nullifying your chance of getting it, and then trading it to their friend.
---
He's saying that buying a server that can support 10k people isn't very expensive. We don't know what Blizz will do about server pop and such, but there's not really an excuse to not have something that can support a lot of players at once without sharding when the tech isn't more expensive
---
Why would a paladin trying to kill you not use cleanse? He has 3.8 seconds to kill before the next swing. Could you imagine how broken a Ret paladin would be if he suddenly had all of these crazy good offensive spells? A Ret pally is meant to be a big meaty support DPS. The reason it's not a good as a holy is because holy is specialized. Ret by it's very nature is not.
---
The only way they would be able to make a Ret Paladin with some really strong aggressive teeth. Would be to remove a lot of their support spells. Which is what they did in later expansions. I can't say they a wrong for doing that but, for my taste it just made the class feel like another "dps". 
---
Personally I would much rather pvp in the style of play Ret used in Classic then the one in modern. If you wanna cleave people Warriors exist. If you wanna be able to Mash people with your hand of rag but, still be able to save your buddies from power debuffs or Oh shit situations. The paladin is for you. I played a Ret on nost. I didn't have god gear or anything as my priest was far more progressed. However I couldn't imagine playing my ret paladin and, not having abilities like BoF, Cleanse, and BoP. Feature prominently in my play style.
---
Shit like this is why I really wish they'd rework the pvp system somehow for ranked BGs, or at least throw out real rewards. This is the kind of gameplay that WoW deservers, but occurs once in a blue moon because while your premade is having an epic slugfest with the opposing faction's premeds, the other premeds on your own faction (you know, the people you're in actual competition against) just made 4x the honor you did by stomping pugs who just sat down and let them overrun them.
---
Running my lvl 1 twink gnome to Mulgore and hope that a naive Tauren dares to attack me  :D

Back before quest trackers showed you where everything was for the quest, me and my brothers would always use thottbot to find where certain quest items you had to pick up were. Good times

i can't wait for classic. instead of being drunk alone. i can be drunk with friends in loch modan
---
OMG, drunk / high leveling is such a nice smooth burn. I cannot wait. Let me know if you're playing rp-pvp server!
---
No, I just wanna play vanilla 
---
Try adding ghostery or privacy badger on top of ublock.
---
My favourite pvp story doesn‚Äôt even involve members of the opposing faction... it‚Äôs still player v player nonetheless. 
---
I was AoE grinding the Worgens in duskwood on my mage. It was quiet and there was no competition. All of a sudden another mage appears and spam sheep‚Äôs my mob, I barely made it out alive. I return drink and try again.... and once again he sheep‚Äôs the mob, a brief ‚Äòwtf dude‚Äô back and forth begins and he tells me this is ‚Äòhis spot‚Äô. I purposefully pull another pack for him to sheep... allowing me to gather some photographic evidence.
---
 I had made an enemy that day.... well more specifically, I‚Äôd made a ‚Äòfriend‚Äô 
---
I decided I‚Äôd make him regret his actions by following him around the globe sheeping as I went. I friended him on my main and would quickly switch when I saw him log. I did this for weeks! I basically ‚Äòno-life‚Äô on wow anyway... so setting aside an hour a day for revenge was well worth it. His reactions to my presence mimicked someone going through the 5stages of grief... the best being the threat of getting his horde main! That never actually arrived. In the end he tried to bargain with me or buy me off. 
---
The guy never made it to 60.... he quit around 49, just a few levels short of the safety of DM lasher farming. 
---
I like to think, that if he plays classic and another point in time arises to troll his own team.... he‚Äôll think twice. 
---
It really doesn't.  I can see what point you're trying to make, and it's invalidated by the launches of later classic-oriented servers that had far, far more players on them than Nostalrius did, and the listed donation numbers for them paint an incredibly clear picture about the whole fallacy of sharding-saves-us-money claim.  It doesn't even do that; at least not on a scale that a large business would be able to feel, even one that is trying to pinch pennies.
---

Why take any rogues at all when you can take fury warriors?

I'm Excited for both, TBC was the best expansion to me, but I'm just excited to go back and play Vanilla and experience the raids I couldn't back then when I was on 56k and in a rural area.
---
As somebody who raided back in the day and in current retail the last 3 expansions. I can saw without a shadow of a doubt Current wow raids are much harder and expect far more from the average player than Vanilla raids. 
---
The number of mechanics, the order of them, how punishing they CAN be are much harder than vanilla wow raids.
---
Look at this video of a Heroic boss in the current raid. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byI1hOhKRe4
---
There are 3 rooms with different mechanics in each that are additive. so the mechanics in room 1 are also in room 2. Then room 2 adds in more mechanics. Room 3 has both room 1 and 2s mechanics while adding even more. There are winds that push you into fire that will kill you. Fire on the ground spawning often that will likely kill you if alone, if you are stacks on others you will be hit by their fire as well. There are adds, that have to be silenced and killed quickly. There is raid wide damage that hits the whole raid when people go from one room to another. Lasers that go across the room that you have to avoid, else you'll die. Then finally in room 3 there even more lasers from the sky, timed with the side lasers we have to avoid. Oh I also forgot the boss has a from AoE the tank has to move out of and position out of the raid.
---
And as somebody who cleared the current Raid on Heroic, this is a rather easy boss. Don't forget Mythic(the highest raid difficultly) adds even more mechanics. 
---
No boss in Vanilla wow has anywhere near the number of mechanics that this one boss does. Of course more mechanics doesn't always mean a more hard boss, there are bosses later on that have less mechanics but are much harder. I am using it as an example. The amount of raid awareness that even average raiders need on retail is far more than one needed in Vanilla. 
---
To be fair I never raided naxx in Vanilla I got a few bosses into AQ40. I can say that Naxx on paper look much more like a retail raid in terms of mechanics than anything before it. Bosses that stop healing and heals have to be timed, that is something I have seen over the years on retail. Bosses like 4H that require some very careful tank swaps, yup seen that on retail(tho not 8 tanks). Bosses with 2 rooms and kill orders and things like that, are far more "retail like" than any other vanilla raids.
---
If I could get my retail raids core 10 members and just copy us a few times until there is 40 of us, we wouldn't have any issues with mechanics until Naxx, and issues just being needing to see the fight more than 3 times before we have it down. 
---
Any hardcore raider in current wow I image will find vanilla raids to be very boring, in terms of difficultly and variety of mechanics they need to remember. 
---
In my opinion, because of the fairly easy nature of vanilla raids up to BWL and the amount of players required, we'll see a lot of pug for MC and ZG early into the game. 
---
While what you say is true, and a very knowledgeable and very well played feral druid for example will definitely compete with a mediocre fury warrior, you simply can not know if someone is going to be a good or a bad player based on a whisper and quick gear inspect.
---
So what kind of criteria do you think most players will come up with when it's time to make that 40 men squad? Here are a few examples that come to mind, based on behaviours from other MMOs, that I'm fairly certain will happen on Classic as well.
---
* Is the guy playing a "meta" class? Aka did he research the imbalances and flaws of this vanilla era and pick his class to be efficient? *There's a chance that this guy put in the extra effort to read about his class, his gear choices, his rotation (= probably good).*
---
* Is the guy well geared? Correct pre-raid items? Correct enchants? Multiple epics? *There's a chance that guy researched how to be the most efficient with his class, even if it's a "memespec" and is very involved into the game (= probably good).*
---
* Memespec? Wrong gear? Wrong enchants or no enchants at all? No consummables? *This guy doesn't seem very involved into the game, not very knowledgeable about his class. For a raid leader trying to form a decent squad for the evening, being kinda responsible for the time of 39 other people, this does not seem like a reliable player (= probably bad).*
---
You can't know how good or bad a guy is going to be before playing with him. When you're flooded with whispers to form that 40 man pug for MC and you only have a few seconds to inspect each player and pick your line up, you are forced to take shortcuts when it comes to selecting players. This type of selection happens nowadays in pretty much every MMO and it was also very common during TBC and LK where people pugged a lot of Gruul, Magtheridon, Sartharion and Archavon, Onyxia (80), Trial of Crusader etc.
---
No matter how theoretically easy MC is nowadays, you want to put the odds in your favor and not waste everyone's time so you'll try and stick as close as possible to what a meta raid comp looks like, for you and everyone to feel confident about the success of the squad and because, assuming every player has an average skill level, there's a very high chance that meta classes will outperform exotic builds in the end. Sure, you may feel frisky once in a while and invite that feral druid because his gear choices are impeccable and you suspect he'll do a great job, but that's always going to be a small number of slots in your squad.
---
NA/Horde/Not sure/Probably sub rogue (is that even viable?)/super casually
---
Modern raids tiers are all tuned around twitch/reaction speed gameplay. Basically jumping in or getting out of different colored circles really fast while spamming your 3 button rotation.
---
Class are shallow, homogeneous, and are designed around 3-4 button rotations similar to MOBA gameplay.
---
There is no difficulty curve upward through each tier, they are all tuned to the same level.
---
It‚Äôs clear Mythic raids exist only to keep streamers, influencers, and addon developers playing the game. The rest of the game is tuned for stroke patients.
---
Reaction speed is the only criterion for success, there is little or no hard gear progression/dps/hps checks like in Naxx.
---
Since everything is cross realm, there is no such thing as localized competition. If you can‚Äôt keep up with the best in the world you‚Äôre irrelevant. I mean, you‚Äôre irrelevant anyways because nobody can tell you did anything notable (no visual progression in the game).
---
I was actually really betting on that emerald dream expansion after BC.
---
I did say my share of "It's an upgrade"
---
I remember running into Un'Goro at way too low a level to try and farm some Thorium, and getting introduced to a certain roaming t-rex...yikes.
---
I only raided very little of Naxx40 during actual real vanilla.  Couple bosses in each wing.  I did do everything else, though.  I also raided a bit at the mythic level in WoD, cleared *everything* at heroic level in Legion, and cleared the first raid in BFA before quitting.   I don't remember enough of actual Naxx to compare, but I'd say in terms of complexity C'thun is *easily* as "hard" as a modern raid boss if not harder.
---
Wowhead is so good to us 
---
I'm afraid you're bit too optimistic. People will abuse what's abusable.
---
if the Enh shaman has nightfall it's not even so bad.
---
When I was leveling up my priest I spent quite a lot of time grinding in Desolace just for the peace and quiet. One day I met an UD priest. He killed me. I rezzed and killed him back. We were really closely matched, so we both decided to duel for a bit. You could talk to people in leetspeak back in the day, so we sorta were able to chat a little.  We must have dueled a half dozen times, probably breaking even. It was a blast.
---
It was just a neat moment of going from "see red, ded!" to "oh this guy is kinda good, I better start trying" to "you've earned my respect, sir, go about your travels!"
---
"Say what you want about retail, raiding is objectively more difficult." That depends on how you view it. Modern wow at it's hardest is indeed more difficult. That being said you are ignoring two important factors.
---
Firstly most people do not do Herioc or Mythic raids. A vast majority of players end up just doing raid finder. Well classic has no raid finder easy path. Only one path. That path may easier then the hardest road in modern but, as it's the only road. It is the only road people can take. So in conclusion. For about 95%+ of player. Classic raiding will be harder then anything they have ever experienced.
---
Also remember as well. You used to bring 40 people. Old raiding used to be more about friendships and, comradery. If you remember in classic you used to actually raid with your idiot friends.  So guilds were less segregated then they are now. I can't explain how much fun it used to be to try to help my idiot friends no get themselves killed. Old wow allowed for a better blending of skilled and, unskilled players in raids.
---
I think one of the things so many people hate about modern. Is that it feels so all or nothing. Either I kill myself getting to the point where I am accepted by the super HC raiders in Heroics and, Mythics. Or I go 100% casual and, raid finder. The old game used to have casuals and, HC's taking on shit together. Obviously I'm not counting world first style guild which would still need to be all HC.

EVUL lol

First risky link click at work of the day 
---
Really interesting video, but this shows just how reliant people are on addons to tell them things.
---
I'd love to play WoW where addons were completely disabled and everyone was on a level playing field.
---
You don't think that login queue priority is enough of a carrot to get many people to fill out the survey? At launch that could mean the difference between getting into the game after a few minutes versus hours of wait. 
---
Regarding your second point, I guess it doesn't really matter whether the populations end up balanced or imbalanced as a result of this. What matters is that people got to make an informed decision and pick what they want. If people want to play on a 80/20 server and this scheme lets them select for that, great! All that matters is that the players end up happy anyway.
---
It boils down to the same issues.in retail where certain specs were viewed as dogshit and are not accepted into m+ groups (enh shaman, spriests).
---
Until those classes received buffs so that the community had the opinion that they were good again, then they got accepted.
---
Back in vanilla when most people knew very little, everyone was accepted. This time around this group of pseudo-genius wow players will think that they know best and won't invite sub optimal classes.
---
However with vanilla, for the average player, it's not about world/server firsts. It's about having a very large group of friends to play a game with.
---
I r investor
---
The absolute worst places for abuse of Need Loot Sharing will be for BiS items. Nobody gives a fuck about SM loot, but you'd better believe Dickbag the warrior and his 3 Uberleet friends are going to roll need for those Truestrike Shoulders.
---
My problem with this is allowing WHO gets to do this. 
---
If there is one who is allowed to raid in pvp-spec there will certainly be more the next week, especially if they go for #nochanges and doesnt change the QoL with cheaper respec like on some pservers. 
---
Its one thing if you are sitting in AQ gear and doing MC for TF but entirely different if you are playing on the ‚Äùhighest tier raid‚Äù available at the same. 
---
Not saying it cant be done.
---
I just don‚Äôt understand people‚Äôs fear that their groups will be full of groups of friends that will box them out of loot. Is that common in current wow?
---
I played with friends from vanilla-cata and the thought of doing that never even occurred time until I saw it being complained about here as an absolute certainty that would definitely happen.
---
See, if you doing this as same level. It‚Äôs cool. But if you just messing with someone lowbie in stv as a 60, you are fucked up. 
---
I am not saying it‚Äôs not allowed, if it is pvp, it‚Äôs all game, but still doesn‚Äôt make it cool. And a normal person should not find enjoyment in that kind of abusive action. 
---
You usually die. The exception is pirate in Tanaris because the mobs won't chase through the water (like all good pirates, they can't swim). Most other classes can't catch up to a blinking mage in the open water.
---
&gt; Personal loot is the greatest quality of life change that has ever been added. Fuck all the way off with your dkp and loot council.
---
I respect that that is your opinion, but fuck everything about it
---
&gt;wademu 
---
ooh damn that one... nothing was working. Most talents were broken, and spells weren't resisting at all!
---
The majority of LFR mechanics are, and have always been, more complex than the mechanics in MC. 
---
I‚Äôll concede that the margin of error in both are different. MC has easier mechanics, that are generally easy to figure out and avoid. But they‚Äôre usually harder hitting than LFR mechanics. 
---
But again, LFR is more complex. 
---
In addition rotation priority, and the fact that classes have a lot of procs to deal with, means that baseline play is harder now. Since you can‚Äôt just spam fireball or shadowbolt. Whereas in Vanilla, you can with many spec, in raiding. 
---
So, again, as a guild master, and a raid leader, that has been raiding since TBC, I disagree entirely. 
---
I did with my Hunters leaf, the Finkles Skinner (off the beast) IIRC, and a couple tier pieces. The 0.5 ones not the MC ones. I also had my helm ticketed and transferred, but that was a looting mistake in a guild run. I think it was off of Rag? I cant really remember details but I did it a lot in classic. 
---
I see people do this on a private server called retroxxxxx. Is this even effective? Or can tank actually farm with this ‚Äúthorn‚Äù gear set? Like warrior, of course pally already does aoe farm.

Ya dude! Spells took like 1-2 seconds to actually cast lol because every action was queued up for the next one. 
---
There was no multicore anything back then!

Once Wademu used up 1 core, that was it! People used to seek out single core CPUS with high clock speeds to run Wademu. The quad cores would perform 1/4 as fast because Wademu was single-core.

I remember looking for the arena tournament gem vendors in stormwind... on non-tournament servers, of course
---
How? All that is is a Nost dev saying launch was stressful and bad on Nost. It was, nobody is refuting that, but since then, other servers have launched with 8-9k pop and have run more or less fine. And those are private servers. A company like Blizzard should easily be able to afford servers much more capable.

My first wow moment was running to Ironforge for the first time in the beta, and seeing that massive statue. I had played MMOs before (Dark age of camelot) but wow was a thousand times cooler. 
---
&gt; In the Real vanilla without loot sharing 2 friends in a dungeon group wont Roll on each others item drops and contact a GM to Get it transfered. It is to much effort to Get the loot. 
---
LMAO, you are delusional. Its no work at all... Jesus do you guys huff and puff and end up out of breath after clicking a button on the UI and typing a single sentence? Some of the stuff you guys consider hard work is crazy... I would expect that from a retail player... but from a Vanilla fan?
---
Please.... We traded items via GM all the time in Classic, I know because I did it. And it was never "too much work", especially in comparison to running the damn instance 10 more times to finally win the drop. 
---
Lord have mercy, this place is hilarious.
---
Private servers have nothing to do with mobility and rogues were never good in BG's outside real vanilla 1.1 patches we will never see in Classic where items like Barman Shanker were "bugged" to be = to something like an AQ level dagger at release. Normalization was patch 1.8 I believe. It nerfed rogues hard and made warriors do this. Not a private server video. It isn't a "private server meta", it's patch knowledge which people now have.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAR1CsAXLCw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAR1CsAXLCw)
---
You are the one basing 1.12 and Classic on the past that doesn't apply. It's like POM Pyro. There is no double spell trinket in 1.12. **Rogues and Mages were definitely OP in early patches.** In 1.12 they are mainly utility in a BG. Mages still can burst someone down in a shatter in a 1 v 1 situation though. So can a rogue. The rogue just needs more cooldowns as the BG spec they run to be useful irritating the druid. Sometimes they can down that druid with the coldblood. Depends how good the druid is.
---
Also you complaining about my comment with "meta" is even more ridiculous because rogues are only good in a premade for that one purpose. PUG's, which you seem to want to base this off of? It's the worst class you could play. When I want to lead BG's I hop on my Ele Shaman and warrior, lock, hunter. When I want to troll people I play my rogue. Why? Cus I know they are raging and have a built in excuse when they lose. It makes it even funnier. 
---
The only thing other than chasing a druid I can think of that rogues are good at is AV towers. They are not a good 3 v 1 class though. Even 2 on 1 can be hard depending on the classes. So it's hard to actually hold that tower. Druid is actually better in that role. You could argue human rogue is good at AB ninjaing, but that's only against bad players. You can do the same thing on a mage that also brings more utility. Hunters are better at D and stupidly better at O. 
---
I am in no way saying you can't do well in a BG on a rogue though. Never underestimate how bad people can be. I have led kills on a naked human rogue on a private server that has better players than retail will have in a AV. Keep in mind that there are a lot of sub 60 players there though with no pvp trinket and that any GOOD ranged could have had 300 killing blows to my 100 in the same time frame. Put a good hunter in AV and it's goodnight. They can go like 300 and 0 without dying, while you die 30-40 times on that rogue lol.
---
1. There are a multitude more mechanics in retail raids. You can ignore a third of them in heroic, half in normal, and all but 1 in LFR. Mythic is mechanically harder than Naxx but tuning is about the same. Tuning is lax on all other difficulties to the point hard gear progression has been effectively removed from the game. "Hard" now means reaction speed. 
---
2. Every class has a teleport or can launch themselves 30 yards forward on a short cooldown.
---
3. Every class has defensive cooldowns.
---
4. There is a built in guide that describes every detail of every mechanic for every boss.
---
5. Class design has been simplified into the ground, comparing primary stat values is now the answer to everything.
---
6. Modern computers invariably run WoW on 60 FPS with vastly superior and more stable internet connections.
---
7. There is a fully monetized industry for posting video game guides/data mining/information on the internet. 
---
8. Generally speaking, most tiers from Classic &gt; Wrath (excluding nu-Naxx) were "easier" than current Mythic but harder than current heroic, when all of the above is taken into account. They were also more rewarding, objectively more fun, and challenging enough to be a feather in the cap for the best players on each realm.
---
Inconsequentiality and romance does not a Mary Sue make.
---
&gt; She barely had any character.
---
No offense but, uh...  Maybe replay Reign of Chaos.  She's one of the most important and influential characters in the entire game, certainly as far as the protagonists are concerned.
---
Her character changed completely.  This isn't a "life lessons" type of thing.  She is NO stranger to horrific tragedy, and yet the woman who once saved the world by reconciling with the Horde, now eagerly wants to commit genocide _against_ the Horde and its constituent races.  It's nonsensical and, frankly, the only reason it's happening is because Blizzard needs more story to contrive.
---
Used them for FFXI constantly.
---
Or maybe Thottbot was just ahead of the curve.
---
BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON???
---
You could still summon people to a drowning death though after the fix right?
---
If you level mage like other classes, fire is fine after 30!
---
It's just a frost mage can AoE farm after 30 (if done right and mana management is on point) so it's slower 
---
See I can't get behind that. I'm playing on Nd right now which peaks at 13k or so. I know all the guilds, and have met so many good people. This is why i'd like to See blizzard have small medium and large servers. Something for everyone in there!
---
you're missing the point  
---
sharding isn't only to handle the server load, its to enable people to actually play the game instead of just sitting and watch everything get tagged and maybe complete 1 quest per hour  
---
Yeah I hope so too, I have a feeling they'll do something to the queue system to alleviate the dodging problem, adding deserter for dropped queue pops and multi queue that drops other qs when you enter a bg would fix it.
---
Thanks, I'm really glad you enjoyed the video 
---
That doesnt mean we dont still yell, scream and kick our feet when they push unwanted changes. We need to *hope* they listen to us better than they did with BfA.
---
&gt;dual monitor setup with the ‚Äúmassive‚Äù 19‚Äù crt I used for WoW.
---
haha I was running thottbot and temperature monitoring programs on the second monitor
---
you think it will, but it won't
---
No idea about Warrior. For Paladin, I paired it with Demon Forged Breastplate and Seal of Light for a surprising amount of healing. Often I'd drop the weakest bits (ring and gauntlets) for spell damage gear. 
---
I'd see how well the breastplate works on a warrior. If it does, they should be able to pull it off.
---
I think current wow just gives you personal loot and no one really rolls for anything. 
---
Likely not. Blizzard seems to want to keep this whole thing close to the chest until release. Aside from the beta period during/around blizzcon, we‚Äôve seen nothing in the way of ‚Äúpublic testing will happen‚Äù or ‚Äúalpha period will be‚Äù. If they were going to have another beta/alpha period, they definitely would have announced it.
---
&gt;Thottbot knew where Mankrik‚Äôs wife was
---
no, it didn't.
---
It actually didn't, it knew only "NPC location" and "object location". There was no NPC named "Mankrik's wife".
---
We were totally l33t

A grinding alt makes no sense from an arithmetic perspective. If you're a fast leveler and take 6 days to level the alt, you could have farmed 3600g at 25/hr. Which means that you need to farm on your new alt for 6 days at twice the rate of your main to break even...only after wasting 12days of your life are you starting to get ahead.
---
Make an alt if you want an alt, not to farm... 
---
What do you think they are better at than priests, paladins and shamans? Longevity? Spot healing?
---
Which addons do you mean? The Vanilla ui by standard is very very limited, you don't really have a choice but to use addons to fill in the information gaps! A lot of stuff you use addons for in vanilla are things that were incorporated into the game later, enemy castbars for instance.
---
Glad you found the video interesting! :)
---
I see both sides... everyone has their preferences. I'm pretty sure I feel the way I do because my server was small. 
---
Mine is definitely duskwood.
---
I believe this was MadSeasonShow, who is about the only youtuber who makes classic WoW content that I enjoy. Highly recommend his videos to anyone looking for a nostalgia hit
---
I agree to an extent, but providing blizzard work the queue system in a way which doesn't allow for dodging then it becomes less of a problem, in that case everyone should face a relatively equal amount of premades and as such the better teams will pull ahead.
---
Pre vs Pre is a really under appreciated facet of the game but as much as I love it I wouldn't like to see a rewards system. Maybe something that tracks a teams' win-loss rate and gives them a ranking on an external site would be cool!
---
In fact. The pressure to end the game fast adds another dynamic to it which I enjoy! 
---
Imma keep it real wit'chu chief. All I remember of that place is the big tiddy idol icon :u
---
*Waiting intensifies*
---
Oh that's what you meant. Well, I kind of get it, but that's more a question of preference. I'd rather have everyone on one "shard" and then have to group up and fight for mobs for hte first few hours/days than have sharding, splitting the community. The launch of K2 was some of the most fun I've had on private servers honestly, I grouped up and talked to a lot of really cool dudes, some of which I still talk with, even if it took us like 6 hours to get to level 10.
---
And if you only limit sharding to certain levels or zones, you just move the bottlenecks further up to when you get to zones/levels without sharding. 
---
But again, that whole argument is, in my opinion, just a matter of preference, where as the argument over server capacity shouldn't be, that is just a matter of not accepting poor excuses from a multibillion dollar coorporation.
---
&gt;so I'm not sure why the 9 months out point is valid
---
Developers hate committing to dates before it's necessary, and a lot can happen 9 months out. If reading "The WoW Diary" has taught me anything, it's that it would not be smart to commit to a specific date 9 months out for no reason. 
---
But you're right they can back out at any time as this wasn't "officially stated" so it kind of cuts both ways. 
---
I forgot thinks were a thing lol
---
They don't chunk out fat heals but they sustain the raid and ease the burden of the rest of the healers. Their unique utility spells make them invaluable to the raid. I honestly think that if priests and paladins weren't HPS meter whores and actually healed people who needed to be healed only  instead of wasting mana on someone who is going to heal to full from a HoT anyway, druids would top the meters.
---
If name change is possible, then it won't be vanilla.
---
What's a retail patch have to do with classic?
---
Iirc didnt they say it was to be released in summer? So wouldnt that technically exclude September? Or are they gonna play the ‚Äúseptember is half summer anyway‚Äù
---
Same here, I was primarily playing within guild with friends and if I did pug I just didn't have expectations about it.  I do remember a lot of people trying to ninja loot or roll need when it wasn't needed, but I don't think a small increase in that is worth not being able to solve legitimate loot issues.
---
I guess I would say to anyone who is really scared about that find a good active guild and it just won't ever be a concern of yours.
---
My first char was a gnome mage, got to around level 40 then rerolled gnome warrior and play that all through tbc till wrath came out, Gonna go Either Dwarf or Orc Rogue for classic though, cant wait to be a sneaky boi
---
I really doubt most of the people prefer that.  
---
Also keep in mind that a lot of people will be trying it for the first time, so blizzard also has to make game playable to them.  
---
I also played on K2 launch, and after not being able to do much for an hour or two I just decided to sit out day or two until people leave.  
---
People won't have that mentality with something they are paying for on a specific timer.  
---
&gt;And if you only limit sharding to certain levels or zones, you just move the bottlenecks further up to when you get to zones/levels without sharding.
---
Won't be a problem. A lot of tourists will leave and there will be a lot of people that can't play for very long or are slow at leveling. 
---
Loch Modan, from a Horde point-of-view, was the zone that we ran through to get to Badlands / Uldamann, and for some of the Horde slackers, Kargath.
---
Earlier this summer, I decided to play Alliance and levelled a little NE and Dwarf hunter.  Yes, two -- because I wanted to see ALL of the starting zones, the quest lines, and experience Vanilla WoW as an Alliance player with no quest assistance.  Yes, I was that n00b.  And it was wonderful.

Somehow, I landed in Loch Modan, at the dwarven compound, and found all of my quests, or so I thought.  Got the regular ones out of the way with, thankfully, not dying, explored the mine (!), got the spiders, the bears, and found the wonderful outpost where the vendor sold me the BESTEST blue boots with +agi on them!
---
Ran into those traveling "Hordes" that still killed me, did the elite bear quest, gathered as a group for the elite Ogres, and then found the dam, it's questline and followed it to the very end.  I killed gators, those folks on the island for the four, quest items...  And actually had a great time in the zone.  
---
Well done, Alliance; well done.
---
Duskwood will still / always be my favourite Alliance zone, though.
---
But the Loch -- yeah, it's up there.  That damn dig site, though, gave me more headaches than I care to remember.  But worth it, well worth it.
---
Because they aren't going to want to compete with themselves. Launching a major retail patch at the same time as Classic would be a big mistake. Different demographics, but there is enough overlap there that they wouldn't want to cross the streams.
---
I don't know if it's a funny story but it was funny to me. I was pvping a warrior on my priest in Thousand Needles (still not sure why he was there lol) So we are on top of these laccolithic buttes and, I'm already at half health fighting the natives. Well I know I am going to lose so I jump off the cliff ceding the ground to him. 
---
I figured I'd levitate down and, finish the Kolkaur quest and, then go back.... Except the ass hole followed me down. What made it super funny to me is on the way past me. He white hit and, executed me. I lived by like 3 health and, he landed in the dirt and died. I just kind of sauntered off like "What can men do against such reckless hate" Levitate I guess lol.
---
I mean the majority of September is technically Summer. So I would include it.
---
Everything has 50% drop chance. 
---
Either it drops, or it doesn't
---
&gt; I honestly think that if priests and paladins weren't HPS meter whores and actually healed people who needed to be healed only instead of wasting mana on someone who is going to heal to full from a HoT anyway, druids would top the meters.
---
That wouldn't be surprising. Any class that had an instant heal that healed as much as a full HoT would top the meters, which is equivalent to what you are asking for.
---
&gt; Being the best or worst healer shouldn't be just about raw healing output. If you ignore utility, then you aren't looking at the class as a whole. The reason we have so many paladins in our raids is because of blessings, and shamans because of totems. These are mechanic that rewards taking multiples to raids. Druids don't have such mechanics. Doesn't make them bad.
---
I think that's a creative definition of "bad". I mean, what is it to be "bad" in your role, if it is not to have mechanics that make it "not good" to bring you?
---
‚ÄúOnce in a blue moon‚Äù you mean every time Chain Lightning comes off cool down? 
---
I mean, I could have said that thottbot knew where her beaten corpse was but that seemed a little dark for a trip down nostalgia lane. 
---
Should also consider add-on usage now 
---
I'm pretty solidly split between shaman and priest. I know the group I have will need a healer, and I like the utility from shaman. On the other hand priest is quintessential and we dont have one. Any input for either class would be awesome
---
Ain't there a place called Andorhal?
---
Haha good one
---
that majority of june is also spring, but most people i know still consider that to be summer. generally speaking the equinoxes and solstices is only used to dictate astrological seasons. Meteorological seasons tend to change on the first days of the month. meteorologically, fall starts sept 1st and ends nov 30th in the northern hemisphere.
---
True, it would be more effective after you got ganked at least once, and Shadowmeld after you ressed far, the ganker will probably won't bother guessing where you are if he is on the top of your bones. Then you could use the gnomish cloaking device or an invis potion to get in cover and mount up to escape. Still, one death and then getting away is still pretty handy compared to not even being able to get away lol.
---
Are you being serious?
---
Got a few, but the first one that comes to mind:
---
I, a level 48 Warrior, am grinding at southern Tanaris on bugs. Comes along this level 51 Paladin, stuns me, and we start battling it out. I manage to kill the mob I'm on, potion and start fighting him. He's keeping up heals and taking me down slowly (I'm using 1-h and shield). We both get low on health and he is out of mana, he desperately uses his Lay on Hands, and I pull my secret weapon. I hit him with my [Horned Viking Helmet](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=9394), he's incapacitated for 30 seconds, I bandage, eat, get to full health and charge back at him. He can't take it and bubble/hearths. I'll take that as a victory.
---
I used that Horned Viking Helmet for a long time. Such a great tool to have when you're on a PvP server.
---
It‚Äôs brutal. Wowhead is garbage. I have 16 GB of ram and it would regularly run chrome up to 10 GB of ram and almost freeze Wow when I played Legion. 
---
Fair point. So maybe August is more likely. Guess it depends on their definition of "Summer". Hopefully they go with the Meteorological definition you mentioned! 
---
That's because this isnt a debate.  Not everything has to be an argument, bud.
---
Well I can pretty much tell you never played a shaman. All of that being said if we are whining about a class that can consistently one round. Why don't we talk about a class that actually does that? The mage.
---
Other then that. List of classes that can 1 round in great gear. Literally everyone but paladins and, Hunters. List complete.
---
If it's as done as they claim and they mean to keep their promises of limited changes it would be smart to get some of us "testing" soon, both to ensure it's as bug free as they claim and gauge our reaction to what they have done. The longer they keep us in the dark the more suspicious people will get, and the more accusations will go around suggesting they have ruined the experience and trying to hide it until it's too late.
---
1. I disagree with being able to avoid mechanics in Heroic. While progressing they cannot be ignored once a raid is on farm, then yeah how fights are handled can be changed to ignore some mechanics. As for LFR I agree 100% basically everything can be ignored save 1 or 2 things depending on the boss.
---
2. Not every class has that, but compared to Vanilla this is more or less true. Nearly every class has at least 1 "escape" some are better than others but I think every class has something. 
---
3. I think this is true. All the classes I play do anyways
---
4. Gear yes, it's all about whcih stats are best for your class and spec. Like my pally wouldn't take a 10 ilvl boost if the new piece didn't have haste on it. Otherwise it would be a net loss of dps. Rotation depends on the class, but generally there aren't too many abilities. More buttons to press than Vanilla wow. I know it's an easy go to, but frost mage in vanilla basically spams one spell. On retail they have a few spells and good times to use them, frost bolt, ebonbolt, ice lance, frozen orb, blizzard, all of those are used in fights.
---
6. Very true! I remember doing UBRS on a crappy laptop(befor emy other PC) trying to kite the last boss with like 10 fps...good times
---
7. Yup
---
8. As I said I cannot compared anything to naxx, as I never did it nor mythic as I haven't done other than a few bosses in mythic in the last 3 expansions. But I find current Heroic to be far harder than old school AQ40 and BWL. Not to say AQ40 is easy, easier to me.
---
Personally I'm a big fan of both loot sharing and sharding. So don't forget to count me too blizz.
---
Duplicating my old characters.
---
im pretty sure its the same model and colour. 
---
I'll solve this for you. Pick any casting class other then priest. Activate Hero Charm, Activate TOEP, then activate all relevant class buffs. Cast your best "stab" spell and, watch the explosions. 
---
Not sure if there is a right answer, but this feels like it. Sounds like your saying they traded class design and rotation decisions for cool down management, and while they upped the mechanics they dumbed down the UI to make those mechanics manageable. 
---
Has nothing to do with the modern servers turning into a lag fest with 80 players on screen. Also Nostalrius had 10-15,000 players on at a time. To put that in perspective each server from Vanilla WoW had around 3000. They weren't doing Blizzard load. They were doing 4-5 times that. Of course that was hard.
---
My OP has nothing to do with sharding starting areas and everything to do with modern server infrastructure being a joke to save a few pennies. Modern WoW servers simply can't do what 2010 WoW servers could. It can't even get close to it.
---
How can you have not seen this exact comment like twenty times this week, let alone in five years?
---
To me summer is July and August. Schools are out, people take summer vacation then, and it's normally the height of the warm weather we relate to summer. I'm hoping as early as possible clearly, but August makes the most sense as many of the expansions came out around then I feel, would need to look
---
I have been trying to explain this to people on private servers for so long I have given up trying, I will simply not be forced to do it to raid as its not essential.  I will always have my class appropriate buffs in terms of enchants and pots or even a flask if it was really required, but I am not spending half an hour collecting DM buffs and songflowers for some fool to pet pull a trash mob and wipe half the raid before even the first boss, or your guild gets NUKED inside BRM by a pvp guild literally waiting for you because some guy is streaming the raid and spamming global with the link.
---
I do kind of understand the TOTAL hardcore speedrunners to a point, but they are not trying to beat the boss they are trying to beat the clock
---
A demo is by no means a beta, and it wasn't called that either. Blizzard usually have betas, and I find it unlikely that Classic will not have one. If it is closed, they dont need to make a big announcement, just send invites. Or for that matter, they might plan on telling us in a near future.
---
That's because you have a lot of time to think between autoswings.
---
&gt; guilds always need to bring at least 2 for the tranq shot.
---
Except huhu which only requires 1 hitcapped hunter to be tranq'd and Gluth whose enrage can be completely ignored. You really bring hunters for kiting and to have ranged dps/trueshot during AQ/Naxx. They still provide decent damage but they will never top the charts at that point.
---
Well you saved him the repair bill at least :)
---
To be honest If they had a program that could randomized spawn locations and loot and such it would be automatic. They wouldn't be the first game to use something like this.
---
I meant that as a reply to
---
&gt;  Though twinking has somehow lived on through all these years/expansions
---
Of course twinking will be alive in Classic. Because BGs wont give exp by default. 
---
Haha love it 
---
that July 16th patch date though.... 
---
I know you‚Äôre memeing but I‚Äôm legit scared they will add tokens and it will 100% ruin the experience
---
Decent melee DPS.
---
* Don't have to worry about threat like warriors do because vanish resets threat.
---
* A kick, always wanted for certain bosses.
---
* Stuns, useful on bosses like Sarthura in AQ40
---
No raid utility otherwise, only pure dps. From my pserver experience, rogues were the least in demand class. By the time my guild was having trouble gathering enough bodies to keep farming naxx after we cleared it, we'd have issues fielding every class except rogues. We'd even need to bench them because we'd have nearly 10 of them showing up every raid night.
---
Yeah no.
---
Why should you ever be allowed to trade SOULBOUND items? I mean it's bound to your freaking SOUL!
---
Idk when, but they made it so xp off toons que into normal xp on toons in retail. Too bad gear means nothing
---
yeah exactly by that stage the game is like Counter Strike its just based of reaction timing skill. Not what I want in an RPG!
---
They don't have mechanics that are "not good" to bring them. They just lack mechanics that reward bringing a whole bunch of them.
---
That's like saying tanks are bad because you aren't rewarded for bringing 10 to a raid. Or saying warlocks are bad for the same reason.
---
My first ‚Äúwow‚Äù moment was flying from Stormwind to Ironforge. At that point I had only been up to level 10-20 zones, but you fly over Searing Gorge and Burning Steppes, including the Altar of Storms. Really let me know that I was in for a whole lot more.
---
Oh, they reversed the change? I had no idea, I haven't played retail wow in a long long time. Did that not bring back twinking? What do you mean gear means nothing?
---
So someone who, for all intents and purposes, reserves an item but never actually says so in public, is fine to you? 
---
That's even worse. Also, something that you might not have considered is that usually, res runs are made by people who bring more than just 1/5th of the group. Sometimes they're the tank, which saves the other group members half an hour of spamming /2. Sometimes they're overgeared for the content and only needs that one item, which makes the dungeon much easier on the other 4 members of the group. Sometimes it's a 4/5 or 3/5 guild run just needing one more person, again speeding up the recruiting process and making the dungeon easier on the people joining. 
---
For example, there's very little chance that a fury warrior builds a Ironfoe res group unless he tanks it or brings a friend tank with him. 
---
I think being open about it from the start and advertising that an item is reserved makes the decision easier for all parties involved instead of having to do it in PMs or even ignoring people who whisper you who might need the item as well. 
---
Also I feel for the paladin in your story. If the group was advertised as "Runeblade res", he probably wouldn't have joined and be fine or accepted it and it wouldn't feel like a betrayal. Kind of a dick move imo, without everyone on board, to change the loot rules on the fly. The majority agreeing is one thing, but I'm sure the majority comprised of classes who didn't need it in the first place, and it's easier to let rare loot go to the tank because he's such a nice guy when it's loot you don't need in the first place. 
---
Don't they always use PST? That's just as good.... 
---
Did somebody say [Thunderfury, Blessed blade of the Windseeker]?
---
&gt;Why in the fuck would Blizzard hint to a release almost 9 months out when they barely even had 2 zones up and running
---
Was mostly referring to this, in that Blizzard has already committed to a summer release. Seems weird to point out they have little done and wouldn't be ready in 9 months when they already stated it would be in the summer sometime, but yes a specific date for that far out is definitely not normal.
---
oh my god what a gem. Thanks for sharing!
---
If you have a gnomish cloaking device or an invisibility potion already, why do you need shadowmeld?
---
And in the scenario you mentioned, the ganker would not have to look hard at all to find you. He can tell you rezzed when your corpse turns to bones. And the stealth level for shadowmeld is really low, so even if he was the same level as you he wouldn't have to try hard to find you. If the ganker has a bunch of levels on you he could see you from miles away still. 
---
You're not thinking about it the right way. If I have a meme spec and a good spec in raid applications then it's likely the meme spec will be declined. So by playing a meme spec it will be harder to find a place to raid.
---
The second problem not talked about is realm caps. People on private servers are used to massive realms with lots of raiding guilds. If the pop cap is like it was then you will not loads of raiding guilds to choose from. If you play a meme spec then the good guilds are more likely to ignore you and the only place you can get a raid invite is a C tier raiding guild struggling in BWL.
---
So it's not that you can't raid as a meme spec but you can end up in a position where you can't progress as far as you want because you are less desirable.
---
But... but... but...  newer technology is better! You just don't understand!
---
* BfA crashes with a 40 main capitol city raid *
---
You.. you just don't get it!
---
Or like saying hunters are bad because their DPS sucks (post MC) and you only bring them for tranq shot. Oh wait, that is what it is to be bad! To lack mechanics - like good DPS or good heals - that reward bringing more than the minimum necessary.
---
Modern servers turn into a lag fest with 80 players on the screen, because:
---
1. The game no longer buffers actions in 400 ms chunks.
---
2. During combat character produces more actions/AoE effects/other bullshit then an entire Vanilla raid used to.
---
Yeah. Hench the AlakhaZAM. :) of course it isnt zam network anymore now it is rebranded as fanbyte
---
This is happening because there isn't any news. There has been complete silence from ActiBlizz since Blizzcon.
---
I mean if you take that argument to the extreme then rogues are bad. Ideal raid comp would take a fuy warrior over a rogue everytime. Maybe take enough to disarm in suppression room but that's it. 
---
