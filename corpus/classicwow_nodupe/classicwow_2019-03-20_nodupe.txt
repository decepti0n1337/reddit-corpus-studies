??? I am countering his stupid post and saying that it makes no sense, which is what you are stating. I don't like the new AV either. Basically they apparently lost the armor values for those mobs and health and pathing and quests and don't want to try to recreate them.
---

---
I am not super upset about it or anything because I was Horde and I like playing melee. AV was the only BG we ever lost...I imagine more people will roll orcs/undead now that the one BG they won is gone. This is not including premades, but premades crush pugs on either faction. We will probably have the same imbalance we have on TBC private PVP servers now that AV really doesn't matter and we took away Alliance's winning bg.

&gt; Paladins can tank dungeons, and that's about it.
---
&gt; Not having taunt, poor threat regen, poor itemization from raids, just means that anyone raiding with a paladin tank even with salvation is going to bore themselves to sleep over not being able to dps.
---
Not true whatsoever. This is what I really hate about this subreddit. So much misinformation. I tanked in a hardcore guild for three years on ED/Kron0s as a MT/OT.
---
First off because I know a follow-up comment is going to say this: if you try hard, look up best in slots, figure out the most optimal way to play your class, bring consumables with you to raids, utilize the utility given to your class, be proactive in raid fights, etc **then any class and spec combination is viable**.
---
Now regarding Paladins, they are the best off-tanks in the entire game.
---
* Concecrate is absolutely ridiculous. My OT Prot paladin would go into the [garr fight](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/pretbc/images/8/8b/Garr.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20091111123907) and could literally hold aggro on all 8 of the mobs no problem. Warriors can only SORT OF do that by spamming Demoralizing Shout, using items like Immolation potions or [Force Reactive Disc](http://classicdb.ch/?item=18168). In fact if a paladin has that shield then his AOE threat is even more insane. Raid trash is a piece of cake with a paladin. MC often has four mobs clustered and a prot paladin can often handle three without any problems. **Remember, Warrior's can't thunderclap in defensive stance**.
---
* Paladins don't need a taunt, because the raid leader would never put them into a position where they NEED to taunt off the main tank. No raid is going to attempt having a prot paladin tank Nefarian. What about fights where you need to taunt off the MT? There's actually not that many of those. Most times a fury warrior in the group can perform that role for a second, get the debuff or w.e it is and then swap back to dual wield. The problem people have is they think that Protection Warriors and Paladins should be interchangable. It's really simple, **Protection paladins are your AOE tanks, Protection warriors are your single target tanks**. You use them differently.
---
* Prot paladins scale with gear more than any other class. You can't really have full blues and go into MC and OT. It doesn't work like that. You need to start getting those really strong epic items and mix them in a proper way. You want to try to get a lot of spellpower without sacrificing too much in terms of defensive stats. Don't worry about mana consumption. **With a proper raid, fights will end before you run out of mana with mana potion on cooldown**.
---
* Prot paladins do extremely well in Naxxramas, Undead Strat, and Scholomance due to exorcism. With proper gear it hits like a truck and with Righteous Fury you pretty much have full aggro on anything that gets exorcismed. Holy Wrath is also quite strong. Scholomance also happens to drop amazing pre-raid items for Prot Paladins such as Deathbone.
---
TLDR all the weaknesses of Paladin tanks don't apply because you don't use them in the context of where those things would be needed. A well-prepared paladin tank will be invaluable as an off tank and will make fights with adds / trash packs a breeze.
---
You're thinking of 2.3. I thought it was WotLK but after looking it up, apparently 2.3 was the patch that removed most of the remaining elite NPCs and additional warmasters. That's the Zerg patch, and Blizzard even buffed it back up a bit later on because they nerfed it too hard.
---
At first I hated this, but then I liked it.
---
Do you have a phone?
---
I'd occasionally find myself doing this in tbc and wrath.  It was always nice to log into the sound of drinks and backchatter, then the tavern music would kick in...  I felt like I (my character) had just spent the night relaxing, having a few drinks and ready to take on the world.  
---
That's quite slow for days played.
---
I wish i new, because the class i want to play changes like every month and i don't want to become altholic, i want a main class and to stick with it.
---
I want a melee holy warrior which is supposed to be rest. 
---
I like how you’re telling me to choose a class for what I want which is precisely what I’m doing.
---
I want to be able to do damage as a ret that is viable enough to do raids as ret and not be forced to be a fucking healer. 
---
You literally just contradicted yourself lol
---
Healer is your ultimate raid carry.
---
If you only need to bring 1 healer because they're so damn good that's a bunch of extra spots for more dps.
---
Dps is ultimately limited by your tanks threat.
---
Your tanks threat is limited by their gear.
---
If your healers suck he needs to wear less threat gear and more defensive.
---
But if your healers are great all the cogs line up perfectly and the machine works overtime.
---
One class poll with the faction choosing first would be smarter.
---
So it's ok for others to be assholes (in the context of this thread) but my response is taboo? Lol. You sound like another redditor who can't use applied logic. Enjoy your cake day downvote tool.
---
You've played on shit servers btw. But regardless, you don't need a fucking paladin tank for dealing with some aoe packs, it's completely unnecessary and wastes a raid slot. Heard about engineer shield ye? Use it.
---
From a prophet on the first page...
---
"50 gold says that, before six months pass after WLK's release, Wintergrasp's "PVP" is gonna end up the same "let them win"/"More honor, less time" garbage AFK/zergrush fiasco the BGs are nowadays."
---
Right on the nose, for both Wintergrasp and later Tol Barad.
---
No, no it isn’t. It’s sad that devs have to hear people like you spew nonsense.  This is a fine patch for AV. This was not nearly as Zergy as later renditions. 
---
Yes it does. It's BiS for feral DPS because it enables power-shifting with the mentioned talents. It isn't ever outclassed by anything despite the low stats.
---
&gt;every raid is gonna have a shadow
---
This is a lie. You need to have a decent amount of warlocks to make shadow weaving worthwhile and you would rather have a holy/shadow weaving hybrid healer priest applying this debuff if you really need it. 
---
Even if a guild manages to stack enough warlocks and decides to put a shadow DPS priest then that sweet spot is going to be taken by GM's friend. 
---
Real vanilla this real vanilla that, this is /r/classicwow, we don't discuss vanilla we discuss classic, that game to come.
---
I told my boss I'm going full South Park mode for 2 weeks when it comes out. I'm an HVAC tech in the south so it'll give me a nice break in the middle of our busy season.
---
Immediately 
---
I’ve already quit my job in anticipation. Summer starts in April ffs 
---
People who call Forsaken the Undead and not Forsaken make me sick.
---
Also floppy tongue best.
---
Pretty sure Priests want to weave in an auto attack in between wand shots anyway
---
Not until we get more information about servers.
---
And... a warlock? Yes?
---
Are they even doing progressive loot? As far as i can tell they never really said anything about this other than they are not allowing relic slots to exsist until the content was released.
---
This seems to be right in line with that idea that they arent actually going to go and redo the item database stuff but are instead just going off the 1.12 and turning things on or off based on launch windows.
---
When I played during tbc I did not have a single av that lasted longer than 30 minutes. It was all rush the boss and ignore the players.
---
Someone clearly hurt you.  Oh, and thanks for further proving my point.  
---
Yes!  Please forgive my omission!  Honestly any player that's good at their class makes a world of difference in a 5 man.
---
My name predates the game.
---
I tried getting into Runescape sometime during 2006 I think, but it didn't stick.
---
Lol
---
What’s the alternative? No matter what rendition of AV, people will be upset. 1.12 AV is still fine and you’re gonna play regardless of what Blizzard does anyway
---
Look Druids are great tanks. I plan on being one. But I don't think it's warriors who "can’t handle competition" bad mouthing Druid tanks lol. It's people who don't realize in what ways Druids are Great Tanks.
---
Druids do not make great MTs, can they do it? Hell yes. Should you have a warrior MT instead? Also Hell yes!
---
Druids are amazing Dedicated offtanks. 40 man raids are large and a lot of tanks are needed, but not all of the time. For many many bosses you only need 1 tank. So the 1-2 prot specced off tanks will slap on some dps gear and dps. Then sometimes you need a lot of tankts for some bosses or some pulls. So some of the fury warriors slap on a shield and go help tank. A Druid will be better dps than a prot warrior offtank who has to dps, and will take less dmg than a fury warrior who has to tank. All the while being able to Heal/Innervate/Decurse/Abolish Poison fights as needed. 
---
If we are putting tanks in terms of Tiers. I would say
---
* Warriors Tier 1
---
* Druids, Tier 2
---
* Paladins Tier 3
---
* Shaman/Voidwalker/Hunter pet Tier 4
---
Druids are not as good as warriors as a PURE tank, they just aren't meant to be either. Druids shine because we can change roles and adjust to the fight as needed.
---
Is that whitemane's chapeau? Classic.
---
Even with old AV you wont get that. People just seem to not realize the playerbase wont be complete dogshit again.
---
Without Natural Shapeshifter you aren't "power shifting"  in any meaningful way.
---
tbh I'm just indifferent to it. Whether it's 3 days-AV or rush-AV, once you did a couple of times it gets stale.
---
If people are gonna complain that they can’t play AV for 18+hours at a time, then you can’t change those people I guess. This community has a strong presence in 30 year olds who need to grow up. I’ve seen multiple posts on the forum with people saying “Oh 1.12 AV? I won’t touch this game.” If AV is your entire classic experience, that’s very sad. 
---
STOP!
---
I can't be reminded right now! I am saving my excitement until the release.
---
Dude you need to do a bit more research, you're just completely wrong.
---
Ferocious bite consumes all of your energy, so you powershift after that, and immediately have 80 energy (when timed right). Powershifting is \~40% greater DPS than the regular cat rotation.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
You just ignore them?  For what reason?
---
If they fake announce it on April 1st as a joke I'm gonna be soooo pissed
---
The entitled whining in those comments and also the cross realm update before cracked the window in me about the people in this sub, so many want their special private server version of the game or with different patches modified and mixed together its unbelievable. 
---
They announced classic and said its 1.12 and thats whats gonna be they will just timegate things.
---
The VERY VERY FEW who actually played it back then dont have perfect memories and it was a very small time frame. It's the people who changed, evolved, got better over time and that's why AVs became shorter because they wanted to rush things out. Even in TBC there could still be many hours longs AVs.
---
Even if they would release the old version it would still be rushed and fast because of the small groups of private server elitists who care about  points per hour  efficiency and stuff and they want to end quick to go to the next one
---
The true rose tinted glasses are not about the game, which is gonna be the same, its about the players who are different now and want to be efficient will run through everything as quick as possible
---
Am I the only person who dosent care for AV at all? I am here for my ring or my 2hander rep and after that I am playing a real BG 
---
What do troggs smell like? I would guess like old wet dogs and morning breath
---
What I find sad about the anouncement is that Classic is an opportunity to go back and play what has been lost. I stopped playing in TBC because the game was already moving too far from what I originally liked about it. Part of what was lost at that point was the old AV. Classic was the only chance anyone ever had of being able to experience that again, and the post today killed that hope.
---
Umm yeah no shit. It requires a few key talents (including natural shapeshifter) and and items (like wolfshead helm) to work. What is your argument here? 
---
He speaks for me too, so
---
Yea if i had a fast wand would do two wand shots then a thwack. Slower wand go 1 for 1.
---
Spinning crystals boys
---
That depends on what tactic you mean.  You could not just zerg past the Field of Strife when AV was first introduced.  There were huge packs of NPCs that roamed all over the place and slaughtered people.  There were land mines.
---
Personally I would put in an the oldest AV I could recreate, and have it not grant you any honor or rep.  People that wanted a war would queue for it, everyone else could ... do whatever it is they do.
---
The thing is, people do actually look fondly back at AV and remember those classic battles.  There are loads of people who had hoped they'd get to relive those long grindy AV days.  Not a single person was thinking of coming back to play Classic in hopes of playing 1.12.  
---
Honestly pick whatever you fancy, it's not big deal.
---
1,000,000% What's the point in bringing back something....that's almost exactly the same as retail, only without reinforcements?
---
If you don’t make a floppy tongue undead, how would you spin him around on the log in screen and watch his tongue flop around?
---
You wouldn’t be able to. So don’t do it. Always make floppy tongue undead.
---
You sound like a spoiled child that cries because mommy got him a medium fry instead of a large. This is the majority of whiners in the classic forums, unfortunately. This is where this generation went wrong. 
---
There was a few times as a warlock I had somebody ask me to make water.
---
There's nothing more insulting you can say to a master of the dark arts. Do I look like a mage to you?
---
Bonus points if it's a healer. In these scenarios I purposefully tap after every single pull and keep my life total as low as possible forcing them as mana starved as possible while keeping myself fine with lifedrains and healthstones. Somebody dies? Make sure the group knows it's entirely the shitty healers fault.
---
Depends on the crowd, I'd wager overall that 60 in 8 days played is quite a bit faster than average for classic, I've regularly hit 15 days on Pservers despite min/maxing my leveling while focusing on it due to also doing things like world pvp and professions.
---
You gonna make me sit n watch the entire vid just to break down how low effort it is... Bet. Be back tonight w the update on how you "defending the grind" on this 10:12 vid cause "working." I respect the grind. I don't respect low effort self promoting 
---
It really bothers me that they don’t repeat in their bluepost discussions the WHY AV was changed throughout Vanilla and why version 1.12 was considered to be the best version by the original Vanilla devs. 
---
There are really good reasons why AV ended up where it did in 1.10 - 1.12 and pretending like all players remember why is ridiculous. 
---
It leads to stupid opinions, like not having the data. 
---
The bluepost makes it clear: This is what the devs have believed is the best version of AV and reading the archived discussions from back then it’s easy to see why. 
---
Unless I'm missing something they're not changing anything with the itemization, all items will be in their 1.12.1 state but will have a progressive release. 
---
That is pure 1.12.1, just because they gate off content and items doesn't mean its not 1.12.1.
---
When people mention world buffs and the crazy amount of different stacking consumables, I lose majority of my interest in raiding
---
Also world buffs disappears if you die, so you only have one attempt in progress raids with them, and if it’s on farm, then it’s not like they are gonna matter. Maybe I’m wrong in this, but that’s how I see it atm
---
Misleading poll since 1.12.1 is just the baseline and and we have progressive which is now 1.12.1
---
&gt;dps/healer class that can go either way depending on the build
---
Realistically not happening in vanilla. If you pick a class capable of healing, then you will heal in raids. Dungeons are a different story though.  If you want to have an easy time getting into raids then it's warlock as DPS or literally any healer (especially dwarf priest).
---
&gt; You've played on shit servers btw. 
---
Back in 2011-2015 there was nothing better.
---
&gt;But regardless, you don't need a fucking paladin tank for dealing with some aoe packs, it's completely unnecessary and wastes a raid slot. Heard about engineer shield ye? Use it.
---
This is honestly just ignorance. You act like one warrior with a Force Reactive Disk can hold AOE aggro vs. an entire raid of t2 geared mages and warlocks using blizzard/hellfire. It's not possible outside of Challenging Shout. [Here's a clip of me tanking that encounter using two Force Reactive Disks as a warrior](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/44803839?t=01h57m51s). We had to use multiple warriors to do it because using one is just nearly impossible outside of using things like Immolation potions or other weird trinkets. One geared prot paladin could tank them completely on his own. If you don't believe the theorycrafting then you're going to have to wait until you see one in-game for yourself like I did. 
---
nochanges^frommyfavoritepserver
---
It's not necessarily bad but people feel the need to point out that it is low effort content making money off of hype (trendsurfing) and stretched to 10 minutes so you can get ad revenue out of it.
---
Everytime I play the Blizzard world map in Overwatch and I hear that WoW music I get goosebumps and have to stop and appreciate it for a little while. We're coming home! 
---
People do over exaggerate how many mobs in mc/bwl are immune/high res fire. It's not that bad, but it's still like over 50% so yeah you won't really be using fire even as a fire spec. And fire is a group spec. You are useless on your own because you need to stack 5 scorches and keeping ignite up solo is borderline impossible. 
---
So either you find a way to deal with being a frost cuck until AQ(you can do ZG as fire though but hardly worth to respec for). Or you can choose to maybe play something else until ZG comes out, then raid ZG as fire mage and transition into 40man raids with the release of AQ. Honestly you could probably join a guild with full prebis + Zg gear for AQ. 
---
Nothing beats classic Org. Nothing! Zug Zug
---
Imma carry a BOE green shield around from now on and trade it to any warrior who says he doesn’t have one
---
(Anakin meme) “From my point of view the alliance are evil”
---
The guy is talking about pvp you idiot.
---
You’re right about healers but they will still be popular due to scarcity. DPS will be a dime a dozen and only warriors get taken seriously as tanks. If you want a guaranteed spot go healer or go warrior.
---
I lost all my Vanilla Screenshots, along with most of BC many years ago :,(
---
Nah, im playin on pvp server
---
So I could enjoy killing people in TM/SS for hours, but not in AV?  You didn't have to finish the battle.  People dropped in and out all the time.  You weren't supposed to be there for the whole thing.  AV was a war, and you went in, did all you could for as long as you could, then left.  And it was OK.
---
What fucking shit server is this? The adds not exploding when garr hits 50%? LUL
---
Yellow? Check out Mr Moneybags over here with &lt;600ms ping
---
crossrealm is the reason we cant have 3 days av
---
we dont want crossrealm and we dont want 1.12 av
---
Those are the only names I have ever heard for the circle
---
World bosses/pvp is where the fun long fights are at. If I’m in AV I’m there for a quick honor boost. Plus there’s still a lot of fun with rush AV like backcapping and whatnot.
---
This is why when I read discussions about dungeons, raids, dragons, etc., I *wish* classic was starting at 0.8 and working it's way up.  So that folks could realize just how hard WoW was in the beginning, how much of a challenge it was, and what expectations were of players in a group.
---
I'm afraid it's going to be "raids in greens" clearing MC and half of the population just logging out.
---
AV needs to be the original, where the NPC truly hurt, did some serious damage, and you needed your recruits to help win the game.
---
Plus, think *creak* I could stay awake for another all nighter.  :)
---
This is so stupid and infuriates me so bad when I'm on my warlock. You are a healer. You have spirit on your gear whether you like it or not your out of combat regen is higher than mine. If I'm sat drinking for 10 seconds during a pull that's less dps on the mobs. That means the tank takes more damage and ultimately needs more healing. Obviously if you're oom I'm gonna stop and drink but if you're sitting at 80% mana and you're not healing my life taps I'm not gonna group with you ever again.
---
Thank you for saying what needs to be said. 
---
1.12 is when Blizz started making dungeons, raids and BG's "one-size fits all."
---
But, I’m just gonna life drain...
---
Heal me if a mob is up my ass
---
2.3 removed almost all elites, extra warmasters, and added reinforcements.
---
That's the zerg patch, sometime mid tbc, that you're remembering.
---
lemme guess.... you either havn't played classic, have been a kid at that time, or came late to the party?
---
Wonder how shit memes get more upvotes than very useful topics like this.
---
Thanks for your job! 
---
The meta has changed. Most PServer AV games last less than 20 minutes
---
He never argued anything...that was his first reply... you should read the posts before you reply.
---
I guess we just played a different game then because I did plenty of AV even during the 2.0 TBC prepatch which changed the honor system and allowed you to buy pvp epics with honor, and the AV matches still weren't boss rushes like in retail.
---
TIL everyone who wants classic is spoiled! why even bother leveling when you could go on retail right now pay for a boost and play av?
---
the reality is if they keep doing dumb and lazy decisions(like this one) people will just go back to private servers, except this time theyll have all the data to be perfect replicas of actual vanilla wow
---
I like how forcing unnaturally long games just for the sake of increasing length constitutes epicness and fun. 
---
For someone who doesn’t pvp, is AV a good place to get xp?
---
The PTSD that is navigating through Kalimdor.
---
Lol the "someone clearly hurt you" meme response. See how hard I'm laughing? HAHAHA. You should totally get some mad internet points for that sick comeback brah.
---
Prove nothing.  You might as well say "I don't like your opinion and anything you say I'll just insult you with the reddit equivalent of 'and you!' "
---
awww.  Unfortunate.  I don't have many but there are a few more I managed to save over the years.  They range from this first one up to December 2005.  I might have some odd random ones for the years that follow somewhere else, but it would take a bit of searching if they even still exist.
---
It wasn't in classic but my friends and I were able to force turtles with about 6 of us defending at Balinda when we were bored.
---
Um ,yeah, no shit? So why does everyone only mention Furor?
---
Also btw you can buy the eye for anathema so you don't even need to clear MC. It drops every other week(50% droprate), and guild only has so many priests. As for ZG yeah you probably want to do it for the heart of hakkar, you could try talk with a guild about joining their run, getting the heart and then popping it with them for the buff. It shouldn't be too hard a month or two after ZG release.
---
Honestly even without you should do very well as a solo shadowpriest. 
---
Blizzard has also stated time and time again that they're sticking to 1.12.1. So thinking otherwise was unrealistic and getting your hopes up for something that wasn't going to happen.
---
&gt; Nobody consented to ninja looting, people deliberately wiping their own groups or raids or other forms of deliberate dickery. Those are thing which are possible within the limits of the game code but also not okay and not "valid". Unless you mean something weird by "valid".
---
lol you just keep repeating the same thing. It's like you keep saying "You can't be a dick! Stop being a dick!" while I'm saying "I sure can be a dick, just watch me! Who's going to stop me from being a dick? Oh that's right, nobody!".
---
I mean he can listen to who he wants but your info is bad. Yea a T1 progression guild is going to make him be some hybrid shadow healer. That being said if you actually took the time to listen to him. You would realize he is never going to be a T1 raider.
---
Secondly I am not sure where all the warlocks went in your fantasy but, they will have a healthy population on retail classic. For a casual dip the toe in raids. Shadow is fine and he will be able to find a guild. I have managed to everytime. 
---
Well PServer players are in for a treat when they find out that the average classic player hasn't trained to perfect their zerg strategies over the last 10 years.
---
Regardless, your experience does not match mine at all. The recent pservers' AVs have been hated for the very reason that they often take 3+ hours. I've been in plenty myself that went on for more than 10 hours.
---
What?
---
I was just being a little silly in my first response because of your obnoxious tirade.  The way you keep getting your feelings hurt is comical, but also a little concerning.   
---
Again, you’re clearly a delight. 
---
That's great, you blew up all your mana in a raid for a very minor, short-term, DPS increase.
---
Also, you should be keeping Rip up.
---
You are missing stuff. Progressive itemization  has already been confirmed.
---
It's more efficient but the trade off is you are draining your gold and in order to be "efficient" you have to check yourself every 5 mins. You could make more gold by actually killing bosses. Or if you wanted to afk for longer, you stand at sand crabs and only have to check every 15 minutes.
---
PvP on the other hand is very skill based. Mess up a switch or special and you aren't going to "one hit" anything. People have gotten so good that it seems unfair. It's mostly their fault for PvPing on 1 def pures. No shit you're gonna die fast with 1 def. But it's cheaper than PvPing on something with some defence so that's why people do it.
---
yeah, I'm a bit let down, but oh well can't expect everything to be perfect for just me, plenty of people hated super long AVs.
---
For anyone wondering why all this focus is on the 10 minute mark, it's that it's a "sweetspot" where youtube lets you place a second in-video ad, effectively leading to increased revenue for anyone who watches for 10 or more minutes.
---
Blizzard has the impossible task of delivering something that everyone wants, when what everyone wants is different. 
---
They don’t need the average classic player to know and perfect the strategies. All they need is a few leaders.
---
agree
---
Shit, not even on private servers do people listen to a word anyone says in raid chat. Sounds great, would love to see that one day!
---
Cata was tough on healers most went oom.
---
Oh, haha. Good one lol.
---
\&gt;shadowmeld is too gimecky
---
Lol the amount of times this will win you fights in world pvp, flags in bg's, and other scenarios is very high.
---
Greetings from Tarentum!
---
They've announced that they're releasing items in intervals but I've yet to see anything saying they're touching stats. 
---
If you have something that confirms this I would love to see if but from every blue post/panel I've seen they're not touching stats.
---
I liked the old AV, but I was horde and it's pretty much the only BG we ever lost that was a PUG. If I was Alliance I might be more upset. If this takes away/changes the one BG they did well in though, I don't think that's a good thing. Might lead to much less incentive to play Alliance on a PVP server. 
---
Again you're wrong. Do you even try to fact check? Why are you going around arguing and spreading misinformation?
---
1. Power-shifting with the proper consumables (all mana users will be using mana pots) easily covers you for most content. You only run into downtime (oom) issues in some Naxx bosses where the fights run a lot longer. Even still, the regular cat-dps rotation obviously doesn't use mana, so why wouldn't you powershift as much as possible? Have you thought this through?
---
2. Rip is generally not allowed due to the debuff limit, and is only a DPS increase over FB in roughly the first half of the expansion. FB ends up surpassing Rip but not by too much.
---
Correct, I was too young to experience. Am I missing the point? Was it really THAT good? Putting that much time into it really felt good? 
---
I understand that Blizz has been catering to casuals, and I guess I can understand why people are upset. What I don’t understand is that a lot of people on forums/Reddit are saying they won’t play Classic at all because of this. 
---
That was before they upgrade Staff of Jordan. It later had 22 spell power instead of 18. It is also incredible that you have it at 40, because level 40 mobs are the lowest level that can drop the staff.
---
How much honour do you lose from a DHK? I remember an old video where a guy farmed NPCs to test it and didn't even lose 1 rank.
---
If only they has the ability to patch that waterfall...
---
I think one thing private servers show us is big changes to gameplay aren't really a big deal breaker to the vast majority of people. People love to get upset about stuff when they're theorycrafting, but for people actually playing the game big changes can be easily accepted depending on what they are.  
---
  
---
Where's the PS community outcry over frontstabbing, or /sit, or hunter rare pets, or weapon skill rates, or bag drop rates, or DM farming fixes, or increased black lotus, or world buff limits? Because these things are way different on Nost core than vanilla, but no one really gave a shit. Because they were happy playing Vanilla PS edition, and accepted if it's a bit different but has little effect or is a good change people really didn't care.
---
how often do you win on resources though 
---
You know each patch had an enormous amount of bugs, right? So by rolling back to 1.0 you would be delivering a more buggy, unfinished version of the game. Plus, most people who played in Vanilla will have played 1.12 and therefore be playing what they remember, whereas few started at the very beginning.
---
Bringing Vanilla back at all was a huge undertaking in terms of making it compatible with the current game engine. You basically want to make them repeat that for every Vanilla patch when most people are more than content with playing the latest, most finished version of Vanilla (like the majority of private servers, too). Ok then, see you in Classic in 2022, I guess? I'd rather they not spend an inordinate amount of time and resources to satisfy such a niche group of pedantic sycophants like yourself.
---
I believe mine was from Blackrock Depths. The boss fight in the little arena. It was a mail chest piece for my hunter. 
---
Is it FUN to do less damage than the tank? Is it FUN to make Molten Core take twice as long as it needs to so you can look a certain way? I don't get it. 
---
Kinda hard gatekeeping there 
---
It's coming! Soon! ^TM
---
I agree.
---
Though I would say that one of the biggest drags to vanilla has ALWAYS been the old AV, I personally don't like it very much, but it's a big big thing, and I think it's silly of blizzard to ignore that.
---
I mean, no guild worth it’s salt will let you bid on caster dps gear during progression. Even in casual guilds those go to the dps to help with the raid effort. You can ask for gear all you want, it will just make you look bad.
---
 Off specs usually get geared once the raid is on farm, which for a casual guild can be anywhere between 2 to 5 months roughly (usually on farm means clearing the raid 2-3 times at least). This is not always the case, but it used to be a pretty common rule.
---
That doesn’t mean you won’t get any gear until then. you will probably get some healing gear too once all the holy priests get their tiers, not bad to have; also if you’re lucky you might get the priest ingredient from MC for Anathema. also you’ll be saving up DKP so when the doors open for your bids you’ll be like
---
spending heavy and gearing like a boss.
---
 The idea of a casual guild is specifically to let you get in as a healer without a heal spec. Don’t expect them to actually take you as an active dps role unless they have a ceazy amount of warlocks and want your shadow damage debuff. You will be in the back, along with all the other druids, shamans and paladins who dream of more but are stuck on healing duty.
---
I suggest being up front when you join the guild about your intentions. This way you can pvp between raids and get your rank up for the blue pvp set. Not sure how good that is for spriest, but for most healing classes that’s the first proper pvp set. 
---
If you don’t mind healing and find a decent warrior in the guild, holy priest + arms warrior is one of the deadliest combos in BGs and one that will easily get you high in ranking. I’ve seen holy priests riding warriors up to rank 13. Once there you can just buy all the gear you want (assuming you have gold), respec shadow, and start melting faces. The advantage to this in combination with raiding is you get high in pvp without having to actually spend any money on gear. 
---
Holy priests are also very sought after by premade pvp groups, arguably second only to paladins. Again an easy cruise to high rankings.
---
I understand that your main attraction is shadow, but if you want to be good at priest as a whole you should not ignore it’s other components, especially since priest is the strongest healer in vanilla. if you just want dps, go rogue but remember there will be dozens of rogues, all fighting for the same raid slots with little to differenciate them. So idk pick a sassy name?
---
More than I should , less than I would like 
---
Druid has the strongest class fantasy imo. If you go Nelf, do your best to stay on Kalimdor as much as possible to really have the feeling of taming the wild. Or don’t, you do you :)
---
Whether or not it was objectively good isn't why it's sought out by people hard. It was the uniqueness of the experience. Changes that came later turned it into a more bland, although more accessible/grindable(honor, rep) experience. I'm not really interested in grinding for much in Vanilla, just want to get gameplay that I miss back, gameplay that I can't find in retail. 1.12 AV is very similar to retail AV, only difference being a few elite NPCs scattered around + the reinforcements. Yet even in retail most matches I'm in don't end with reinforcements anyway, it's the ease with which you can rush through enemy territory that is the issue. 
---
That's me. I never really did battlegrounds in vanilla except once in awhile. Most of my pvp was world PvP. I couldn't see the appeal.
---
Killing people in TM/SS is for fun and doesn't give you much rewards. AV is a bg with a set goal of killing the commander to win. You get reputation and gear from winning AV, which you do not get from world pvp.
---
If I remember correctly, they don't have it.  I believe 1.12 is the oldest version of AV they have. This is based on old conversations on Blizzard forums from years and years ago, when we tried to get an old version way back when.
---
The community has almost never mentioned pre 1.8 AV at all until this post. I don't really get it other than thinking maybe most people cared less about AV than I thought.
---
I consider back-capping salvaging a fun experience from a boring (yet quick) experience. The reason back-capping is fun because it actually gives you the PvP element of BG, but I'd prefer if we were all engaged in that instead of a few people focused on holding/retaking the first few towers. 
---
To get an epic that nice is like having a gm float down from the sky and kiss your forehead. 
---
Warlocks don't heal, FYI.
---
&gt; Correct, I was too young to experience. Am I missing the point? Was it really THAT good? Putting that much time into it really felt good? 
---
In short, yes
---
Haha I salv people all the time and ignore them when they ask for another blessing. That’s my job gang, not yours.
---
Warlocks love salv tho 
---
Enjoy losing? Enjoy gimping yourself? I don't get it.
---
/u/onan covered the first part perfectly; systems and content are different thing. They are time-gating content; there is no indication that they are time-gating systems.
---
It is safe to assume that since it's the 1.12 version of the game, which had things like cross-realm battlegrounds, that those things will be in classic WoW until confirmed otherwise. 
---
And anyone actually crying about cross-realm battlegrounds can fuck off. It was a Vanilla feature and it was hugely requested and lauded at the time. Any perceived fault with it is utterly intangible. This is what's hilarious to me; people campaigned for Vanilla WoW and now you're all fighting about what version of Vanilla WoW you'll get, including these batshit insane proposals of mix-and-matching content and systems between different patches (so much for \#NoChange, right?). 
---
Can anyone explain the 1.12 AV to me? I did play back then but im really unsure what the difference is exactly. Is it not gonna have all the NPCs and big elemental bosses etc?
---
Staff of Jordan Peterson.
---
Effect on Equip: Makes you want to clean your room.
---
I did most of leveling in the 40s via dungeon runs. Didn’t start questing again until Western Plaguelands. Still I don’t remember any other epics until MC
---
It's when DM was added for easier gear grabs for MC.  AV and several of the BG's were changed to make them easier and/or to be able to get BG gear.  Ditto with the removal of many of the mobs in dungeons that were still just too hard to beat.
---
I wonder if we could get so precise with our strike that they can't do anything about it. Even with 30 people standing around them, 10 rogues ambush and he's dead.  
---
It's just a fantasy of mine right now but I think we could make it work.  
---
I'm not going to say old AV was incredible. But mob style pvp was something you're only going to get on rare occasions outside of AV. Yes it ruins your grind to exalted. Personally, I can live with not getting Exalted until a couple months later because I thought AV mob style was fun. 
---
What's your opinion?
---
Lmao all these people thinking that when Blizzard said they were getting patch 1.12 they were actually getting 1.12 except for features x, y, and z... then acting surprised when **they are getting 1.12**. 
---
I played thru vanilla bc and wrath. I remember getting to I think the 2nd to last boss in ulduar and the rogues were floored that they had to maintain a kick rotation. Like never heard of it, couldn't do it, argued it was impossible.  Literally after three wipes I said "what's going on with the kick rotation?"  and they were all "what the fuck you talking about "kick rotation"?!  you don't kick in the (dps) rotation idiot!" They were a cocky bunch of muh dpsers too and we wiped so many fucking times cause they were wrath babies.  tbh I don't think there was maybe three people in that guild who played vanilla even tho they all lied and said they did.  One of the better guilds on the server too. Wrath was toxic.
---
The elite NPCs' were always avoidable. It's the removal of the non-elite NPC's that covered almost every inch of the enemy outposts that made rushing more challenging, thus discouraging that behavior. Before reinforcements came you could still get long turtle matches if some people defended successfully, but it was the introduction of the rush mechanics being viable (and preferred by people who only cared about their honor/hour rate). There are avenues for farming honor that will still be more optimal than AV, so I think it's preferably to keep AV as a unique experience rather than a faster one. 
---
Up to 18? So, not always increased by 18, but 1-18?
---
Trained to perfect? You just follow the zerg. The handful of experienced players \*should\* defend the towers being capped. That's how it works on retail, there's no reason to expect even more understanding from Vanilla veterans. 
---
You only duel people in your group? 
---
What 
---
forums bitch about every change regardless 
---
[removed]
---
I don’t really have an opinion. I’m going to play the game regardless because it’s something I know I’ll enjoy. Never been in love with PvP, so I guess my lack of knowledge is leading me to question why others are upset. 
---
You don't know what the game will be as it is still being developed. Actual vanilla is fine to discuss. Your private server info is actually banned by the automod where my comment got removed just by mentioning the name of one. So I'm more on topic than you are. Cool? Cool bud, have a nice night
---
Before BGs, we PVPed for the sake of PVPing.  When AV came out, I PVPed there for the sake of playing AV, not because I could get rewarded for it.
---
Only against low skill players.
---
If you see a open node in ab, 9 times out of 10 there’s a rogue or hunter guarding so you don’t just go “la di da” and try to cap ASAP.
---
Same in WSG, you shouldn’t just assume it’s open and not expect a stealth rogue or a aim shot at your head.
---
World pvp it doesn’t beat stoneform at all. If you’re ganking someone as the hunter you can sneak up on them anyway, if you are being ganked shadowmeld doesn’t help much. You feint death then go invisible but can’t move, not much use in that when they can just run to where you are.
---
It’s fun sometimes but doesn’t compete with stoneform.
---
Pretty sure they work in queue.
---
So if he’s in dire bear  
---
Then your heal crits  
---
That means 25% of the total after adding 360%.
---
There are some instant-60-not-so-official-servers, if you want to test this theory out. *Or so i’ve heard.*
---
&gt; If AV is your entire classic experience, that’s very sad.
---
AV was end game content for a lot of classic players. End Game Classic didn't have a lot of content. Most guilds only saw MC, ZG, Ony and maybe a bit of AQ. Top guilds would focus on BWL/AQ40 and maybe sell MC runs on the side. Outside of those weekly raids, there were only a handful of dungeons to do, farming mats/recipes, and pvp for the casuals. WSG and AB were fun, but depending on your server, you might run into multiple premades if you weren't in one yourself. AV was a good place to turn for casuals. It was sort of a pvp arena with PvE objectives, and with 40 people per side, dying didn't feel as punishing. Plus AV offered an epic riding mount and epic weapons for all classes which were pretty much BiS until mid/late MC, so if you weren't in a guild doing MC, AV offered the best rewards.
---
The content people really want from classic, and even current retail, wow comes from the community, playing with friends, and helping others out. Without that tight knit community, classic wow will feel the same as retail, with less to do.
---
I think even the weakest class isn't many rungs down from the strongest. But there is a weakest, and overall I think it is paladin. I'm sure you destroy lots but a good warlock or priest, equal geared, that's going to be a bad, bad time. I imagine a good hunter with the jump is also going to dance around
---
People think they want a 10 hour AV.. until theyre in one. Half the fucking players in the game are afking on the sidelines while the range spam their aoe as far as possible in between both groups of the alliance and horde. Yet 95% of players dont even bother charging in because guess what? You wont be getting honor if youre dead or waiting to res at a graveyard. Its actually encouraging, especially as a melee, to basically sit in the back and watch the other faction while they watch your group look back at them. Whoever the fuck finds this as some magnificent part of the game and is only wanting to level to 60 to experience this form of gameplay is an idiot. 
---
So, can someone sum it up what does this mean to someone who've hardly been to AV in his career?
---
&gt; Can you prove to me that 1.10-1.12 didn’t last the longest?
---
You were the one making the claim that 1.10+ had the longest run during vanilla, [but since other people already did all the work I might as well link it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b2zg97/alterac_valley_in_classic/eiw7xni/)
---
Talking about just a single (patch-)version of AV; 1.8. has the other versions beat. Though it was close and 1.11 was only one day behind.
---
However, since you talked about 1.10**+** we might as well also talk about **pre-**1.10.   
---
 
---
* **pre-1.10:** 294 days    
---
* **1.10. to TBC pre patch:** 252 days    
---
When Classic was announced, literally no one thought, "I'll return so I can play the 1.12 version of AV!"
---
Is it FUN to bitch and cry over what someone wants to play? Having a Ret Paladin or two isn't going to make or break a raid, relax buddy.
---
EU players will still inevitably have ridiculously long AV games when they go against turtling russians.
---
Damn that’s a really judgemental comment, if you like old AV you must be a 30 year old man child. 
---
In regards to the time problems, I'm in the same boat, I work from 4pm to 10pm most nights on weekdays, prime time for raids.  So i'll probably be doing tons of PvP and 5mans instead, and maybe some raids on weekends if I can!  Which is fine with me, I never wanted to raid hardcore.  I just wanna be viable in PvP, which I hope I can without raid gear.
---
Because he is right. As much as you people love to pretend otherwise, early AV was deeply flawed. Plus, in the end he is just conveying the positive side of using 1.12. The reason he stated at the very beginning was they are aiming for clarity with the rest of WoW classic, which is patch 1.12. It would make zero sense to start making a Frankenstein's Monster out of Classic WoW by stitching various content iterations together.
---
That’s not what I was insinuating, but go off I guess. 
---
Lots of people, the subject is brought up nearly every day or two.
---
There was the same poll on [barrens.chat](https://barrens.chat) and warlock was spearheading there too. I'm still surprised, why are lock so popular suddenly? It was speculated to be at the end of the line, not on top of it.
---
Thats because you probably didnt get to grind with the good players that grinded out to exalted in just a couple of days of spamming. Once the majority of good players were done grinding the rep then you were left with a couple of somewhat competent leaders but the rest of the players were mostly shitters. 
---
I don’t ignore them. The point that a few others have missed is that during trash pulls, I specifically play in a way that conserves mana. I exploit the 5 second rule, use only my most efficient heals, and even bandage myself if necessary. I expect the DPS to do the same, so that we can finish the Dungeon in the next 5 hours. If a warlock wants to life tap to 5% hit points, then they can stay at 5% hit points. If I’m ever overflowing with mana, I’ll heal them. 
---
Nah man, most elite NPCs are not avoidable, they're stationed at both towers and graveyards. If you want to capture those (which you do, because warmasters fucked shit up in vanilla), then you'll have to take on a good portion of them. You're not wrong that the non elite NPCs played a role too though.
---
I totally agree with you, in theory, that AV doesn't "need" to be viable for honor farm or anything. The problem is that, in practice, without at least 30 players on each faction willing to do the BG at any given time, none will happen. I've had AV die out completely other than during peak hours, even on private servers with 5-6k people on. As fun as AV might be a few times just for the experience, fact is that without any meaningful rewards people will just stop playing it. And an AV going on for 48 hours means that 99% of the people who queue for it won't get those meaningful rewards since they're so back-loaded into the end of the match.
---
"First half of the expansion"
---
Classic is an expansion?
---
Considering you can shift faster than mana pots cooldown... I don't really see your point as to how those will cover you.
---
Also, it's classic... All raid fights will last longer than you think.
---
Works on pservers but we will see in classic, Ive heard that it’s suppose to be attacks and not spells. 
---
Its not the pserver people complaining, its the casuals. Trust me
---
To summarize this thread:  
---
"No changes!... unless it's something I don't like then PLEASE CHANGE IT BLIZZ!"
---
Just because you didn't think that doesn't mean nobody did. 
---
you don't want crossrealm you mean
---
Ok.
---
So.
---
Let's say the druid has 1500 armor (just a random number).
---
So Dire Bear Form increases this by 360% so that makes his total armor 5400.
---
Now Inspiration increases this by 25% so that makes his total armor 6750.
---
Right?
---
Definitely. Just ran zf on a pserver with a rogue, ret, and mage (war tank druid healer). Between sheep, interrupts, and stuns, I barely needed to cast one rejuv per pull. I was spending more mana on starfire than healing and we finished in less than half an hour 
---
I think I'm dead set on Warrior. I always ended up tanking in retail from wrath until the end of mists when I didn't like how they had fights. I was a pally tank then but I enjoyed talking in cata on my warrior, and in classic warrior is the true tank anyway. 
---
Plus it will feel good to be desired and there's a good chance my wife will play a shaman to heal so... Yeah that will be great. I expect us to be in very high demand later on 😀
---
At what level do I need to consider an actual Prot spec? Only at 60 or around there (BRD/Strath/Scholo etc)?  My plan is to level arms since the trick everyone says to do with Fury (the sit macro) was not a thing in real Vanilla; also there's a good chance we are going to a RP-PVP server if there is one for the best overall experience. 
---
Sorry but they were garbage
---
&gt; 50 copper more
---
Screw that. You think I'm rich or something?  
---
I walk all my mail to it's recipients too. Wayyy too expensive otherwise.  
---
You want to dig into old patch notes if you want the best answer.  To sum it up though:
---
* 1.5 - Welcome to AV.
---
* 1.6 - Tower guards respawn way slower, so they're easier for you to take.
---
* 1.8 - Huge chunks of land and NPCs were removed.  There is a boss at SF though.  All NPCs get a massive nerf, making them 15-30% weaker.
---
* 1.10 - Fuck that boss at Snowfall.
---
* 1.11 - Most of the NPCs, fuck those guys too.  Everyone else got massive HP nerfs.
---
Since everything is weaker and has less HP, you just blow them all up.  Especially considering that gear stats/values have only gotten higher by this point.
---
Lol you've donated money to these guys.  
---
I create content in my toilet, sometimes twice a day.  
---
Oh man you're down here defending the video length too. I *know* you donate to these guys.  
---
If pservers are any indication then it's possible, just harder.
---
The only way to truly recreate proper alterac valley is incentivize players to take objectives and defend your own objectives with honor and rep rewards. But this is best done when there's proper guarding of stuff, so that things are defendable and you don't just rush through taking all objectives. 
---
&gt;the only tank in vanilla with a taunt (single target aggro/threat generator) is warrior. There are other reasons why they are the best tanks, but that’s the one I see most common.
---
&gt;
---
Druids also have a taunt btw, and can be just as good in a 5 man dungeon. In raids you are correct that warriors are the main tank for most bosses, but druids can be very useful here as well as an off tank. 
---
Just to clear up the taunt thingy. Other than that it was a pretty good explanation. 
---
I would also add that you shouldn't feel too scared to try tanking a dungeon while leveling. Just make sure you have a shield if you are playing warrior, and take it slow the first time to get a feel for it. 
---
*angry scuba cops noises*
---
Someone correct me if I'm wrong but I believe it is worded that way due to how co-efficients work with spell scaling. Direct 100% scaling on all spells would be broken.
---
Okay let's run with it. We shard Shadowglen etc, the average player sees 7 or 8 other people questing, jumping around doing their things... Everything is Great. None has to wait around for anything there are plenty of mobs and quest objects for everyone we breeze on through the starter zone. Best MMO Launch ever! 
---
Then we enter Teldrassil... Uh-oh. Can you picture it? The incomprehensible mass of players exiting Shadowglen with their Package for Dolanaar. 
---
So really, when you say "shard the starter zone" you end up having to shard indefinitely until the population buggers off. It is antithetical to the shared realm experience they seek to recreate with Classic. I don't think they will use it. 
---
Can you tank Molten Core as a druid? That's about as far as I suspect I'll play, tbh.
---
Getting downvoted because apparently people approve of a 40 on 40 cross realm BG where you don't know anyone, interact with anyone or fight with anyone. Yeah this is totally what I remember from Vanilla WoW in AV. Totally represents it and is "no changes".
---
Imagine being Alliance in Classic WoW when they lost all the other PUG BG's and the one BG they won a lot is now PVE Looking for Raid. Starting to wonder if the community on this reddit is real people. **How could anyone want this crap?** 
---
I think 1.5 would be interesting to see, but its not a great version of AV.
---
The one i actually remember was between 1.8 and 1.10 where its the 1.12 geometry but Korrak is there and reputation is split beween the entire raid group rather than just for the person that killed someone, that had the most "tug of war" feel because people were basically farming for stormpike/frostwolf reputation, not for the win. I think when most people remember 24 hour AV this might be the version they remember.
---
Post 1.10 I feel is most similar to how AV was for a long time, where the two armies avoid each other. 
---
The problem is that it is possible.  
---
That's the case in all AVs nowadays. Ally just runs past and resses outside Drek and Horde uses the backdoor to skip the bridge. 
---
So what you're saying is that the problem you are describing will only exist for the first week of launch?
---
Okay then...
---
Ask for help too! 
---
Some of us are happy to come goof off and kill mobs with you cause we know that can’t be fun every raid. 
---
Plus healthstones are tasty 
---
Mmm yes. Give me that zerg AV so I can get that rep grind done as fast as possible and never return to the crap BG known as Alterac Valley. Shine your love upon me triggered nerds! (watch how fast this gets buried)
---
You must be new.
---
Exactly. I’ll be the first to say I’m glad they are picking 1.12 version, that’s the version I’m most comfortable with and remember the most. Games are 40mins-1hour usually and it’s a bit of a war but also realistic. I remember getting frustrated at earlier versions and just going afk or leaving a weight on my forward key so I didn’t afk, just to get honour while I watch tv. It was just too long.
---
Everyone has different opinions, and this is he version I like
---
You litteraly have no idea what you are talking about?
---
Making up random shit to prove a point?
---
DM was on launch in EU and 1.5 months after launch US.
---
Stop the nonsense...
---
Paladin lvl 20 quest gives you a two hander that is insane. 
---
It lasts till lvl 36ish from lvl 20 and from 20-28ish you will straight demolish everything. 
---
Can't believe I don't get my Gnome scalps. What a bunch of twatcopters. 
---
No this is skewing the truth so much.
---
This is premade vs premade, both groups are just grinding honour so it’s a race. Both teams have everyone geared and dedicated tanks and markings, this does not happen in a normal av.
---
Look how many people have unstoppable force and look how geared people are, in any normal AV you will have half the people not even 60 and no coordination at all, this wouldn’t be possible.
---
Stop trying to be salty for no reason
---
The mage buffed you Intellect! You could at least show some actual gratitude. I swear... you give them one finger, they suddenly demand you be their personal guard.
---
Druid healer/feral hybrid for raids and pvp
---
Hunter for cash farm
---
Maybe then rogue for stv stravaganZa
---
That probably takes more effort than re-hashing a blue post for 10 minutes. 
---
If you are going to quit classic WoW because of 1.12 AV yea 
---
It was mostly that we were new to the game and didn't exactly know how it worked. I remember the fights where we tried pushing eachother back, but it's just because we didn't know any better. 
---
It's fun to think back and remember, but it's not coming back even if they release another version of it. 
---
So it sounds like these changes led to the emergent behavior of zerging. Do you think implementing 1.5 AV in classic, for example, would prevent players from zerging? 
---
I suppose my question is, will AV be minmaxed in the same way many other areas of the game are? How much of the existence of multiple day AVs was the result of the players themselves at that time, and how much was due to these changes?
---
By the way, I'm not suggesting I know the answer to this I'm just genuinely curious. 
---
My experience on private servers is that if it's pug v pug then Horde wins 99% of the time. If it's any premade v pug the premade will 100% win. If it's premade v premade Ally will win about 80% of the time. I think the difference lies in that you can slowly drip enough Horde players through the backdoor to capture the graveyard outside Van. Alliance however requires close to the entire raid to actually get through the bunker and camp to get to theirs. And when they've actually captured the graveyard outside Drek, players have to repeatedly die and ghost walk down there, or ghost walk down to Drek graveyard, alt+F4 out of the game and log back in so they get ressed there (this works on private servers and I have no idea if it'll work on classic). So for pugs it's much easier for Horde while Alliance have it easier with premades.
---
Strange... It sounds somehow... Familiar...
---
Was it not possible pre-1.12?
---
Maybe don't do that
---
Don't cut yourself on that edge.
---
Whats AV? 
---
Maybe they’ll make him a mod in their twitch channel if he donates a little more. Then he’ll have a real friend.  
---
I have a healthy fiber intake. It's pretty effortless.  
---

So AV pre-1.12 was considered "the golden era" of AV because it was basically a huge turtle fest. The games would last anywhere between hours to days. of course this was fun because it was just a huge battle of endless pvp
---
With the introduction of 1.12, AV received a bunch of nerfs to make it less turtle-like. A lot of the NPCs got armor/hp nerfs, GYs were moved around a bit, and other notable NPCs such as Korak were removed in an effort to make the games go by faster.
---
What ended up happening was that players on both factions started running past each other and zerging the enemy base since it was much more accessible, and AV turned into a base-war. There was less PvP to be had and it was basically a race to see who would down the enemy boss first. 
---
this change heavily favored the alliance because the alliance have much easier access to the horde base. The horde base is basically a big ass camp of huts and towers that people can run freely through. On the other end, the horde have to go through a bridge chokepoint all the while getting hit by archers from the bunkers overlooking the bridge, so it makes much harder to win the race.
---
PERSONALLY, i think this change makes no difference. I think that the meta for AV changed, and people eventually learned that zerging was much quicker for honor than turtling for hours. SO i think that regardless of which AV we would've gotten, the meta would've been the same and it still would've been a zerg fest no matter the patch we ended up with.

I’m na. So we didn’t run into the eu pop much. Plus, my guild didn’t get killed. We gave them a shot at kazzak and they couldn’t do it. Ally was far better than horde. Not all horde but the majority. Well at least my guild was. We ran to raid entrances as a unit. We landed at the fp as a unit. 
---
Even if they put in the original version of AV, eventually, in theory, everyone would be fully Nax geared, and could then speed run AV.  But at that point, why would they even bother? Their Nax gear would be better than what you'd get from AV anyway.
---
For me AV was never about grinding out gear, rep, or rank.  It was about a glorious battle of 40 v 40, slugging it out in an epic war.  I have played literally thousands of AV games.  It was never about the rewards.

Depends. We'll see what blizz does.  Remember, all the instances on private servers are from the nerfed version of vanilla that came out pre BC. 
---
You can be irresponsible if you want, won't bother me when you die prematurely.
---
I feel like this is true. My first experience with AV was in BC, I stopped at 60 to farm it for the mount, and I was so proud when I finally made it. I remember some long AV's from that time that felt epic, and that was a great experience. My memory is foggy, but it sounds like 1.12 has a few extra NPCS to the BC version I first played, so I'm super excited for that!
---
I think there is plenty of room for long AV's with the 1.12 version, that aren't retardedly long.
---
Blizz is making the right choice here, if they set in stone one of the older verions with hugely strong NPCs and day long games because of that, theres a risk no one wants to queue after a month or so of it being introduced. I think that's what they are trying to mitigate.

Dropped during a dungeon (think SM but fuzzy) and I was the only caster in the group. It was an upgrade so I asked if I could have it since it was an upgrade. The people I was with said sure as long as I equipped it right then and there. Ran the rest of the dungeon just fine.

Classic won't be 100% 1.12 anyway, so why can't people ask for the older version of AV? It's been pointed out as the favourite by the community a long time ago!
---
Thats so cool!
---
Because pre 1.8 AV was what many people remember as being THE vanilla AV, the reason people speak so fondly of vanilla AV and shit
---
Now sharding needs to be removed
---
You also got honor from the PVP in AV, and rep by way of objectives and turnins. You did not need to be there at the beginning or the end. Then came the cancerous MoHs, CRBGs, zergs, "let them win" assholes and AFK sponges.

Wanting earlier versions of vanilla av isn’t changes or anything. That’s a different thing entirely deciding on what to use that was in vanilla. 
---

---
I really doubt we're getting crossrealm with russians in classic...would ruin the whole sense of community.
---
I'm a TBC-baby and I have been totally out of the loop about Classic lately. Can someone explain really quick what changed for AV in 1.12?
---
I totally agree with you and it seems as though many believe the decision to implement 1.12 AV ruins that beloved aspect of AV. Because zerging is perhaps the most antithetical to the idea of an "epic war", I was curious how this announcement would lead to that gameplay. 
---
Really appreciate your response! 
---
Everyone who is mad and raging yall did it to yourselves. They have explicitly said we are getting Classic 1.12 as this is the earliest and most complete version of classic that they have. #nochanges amirite? 
---
&gt;Is there anyone here that would even care?
---
There's a large portion of no changes crowd that ree any change is made to the core 1.1 game. Good example would be the shadowcraft boots, they are a rogue set but host intellect. These same people reeing over AV changes are going to ree over the items not being reverted and changed each patch.
---
Av is garbage anyways. We got old Gods to kill.
---
I always considered "no changes" to be applied outside the confines of WoW Classic, meaning no new content or new balance changes or features
---
But everything that was *in* Classic, should be evaluated and used to make the best version of the game possible. This is not it, obvious to anyone with a pair of eyes. There is no contradiction to be had here, unlike the Pikachu meme on front page suggests
---
Rushing AV games is the first hint of *Modern Retail WoW*, where the sole reason anyone did was for virtual currency and loot. That is how the game today functions in all its facets and do i even need to tell you how miserable that is? It becomes a task, a grind, something you do as fast as you can just to get rid of it. That is not positive or decent content.
---
Sadly i think this subreddit seems to lean more to the side of the "positive" Youtube WoW Content creators, who are scared to death to raise any meaningful questions or criticism. Anyone who has played this game knows that fast rushing AV sucks, yet they are all dancing around it.
---
I loved PvE race AV, with a small band sent to slow down and annoy the other team. I'd take it over snooze fest multiple day AV where it just came down to who had the most people afk out at once.
---
&gt;Nah man, most elite NPCs are not avoidable, they're stationed at both towers and graveyards.
---
The first ones? The rush strategy is to run straight to the relief hut, then back-cap to bypass all the defense near the center of the battleground. And a single NPC has the potential to chase, hit, and dismount a single player in a large rush group. A bunch of smaller NPCs can dismount several players and get them caught by the defending players before they group up with the rest of the rush group, and weakening the rush group itself. 
---
&gt; The problem is that, in practice, without at least 30 players on each faction willing to do the BG at any given time, none will happen. 
---
Certainly a concern I share with a lot of WoW things, but in my experience AV had multiple instances running even before it was nerfed. I would hope that it could at least maintain a single instance (all that's needed). 
---
&gt; Bascally, I believe there's a balance to be had. I don't think anyone can presume to know exactly how it'll pan out after 12 years of nobody seeing the previous iterations of the battleground.  
---
Agreed there as well, I'm making arguments based on what I believe will be the case, but I won't assert that I know what will  happen. This is how I remember things happening over the years, but Classic will follow a different pace and meta. 
---
So if you want to play AV, then killing the commander should be your priority as that is how you win.
---
Well at least you commit to your *style* of trolling, I'll give you that much.  2/10 for the back-peddling though with the "I was just being silly" response.  If you're going to troll you gotta commit to it.  But clearly you feel the need to just keep digging yourself deeper into that metaphorical pit of Reddit bravado.   
---
Who exactly are you trying to impress with your continued comments such as "Again, you're clearly a delight."
---
"It's not the destination, it's the ride."
---
I think it’s because most people don’t realize how far AV has fallen. I played AV on a private server, and couldn’t even recognize what I was playing. There were no quests. No one kills the towers. They just rush straight to the enemy base, don’t cap a single graveyard, and kill the commander. It’s not PvP. It’s a PvE Zerg that takes zero thought. But, it’s not the AV 90% of us played during retail. 
---
If you manage to delay them for a few minutes it may just be enough for your team to secure the win. It's not like you need to hold them off forever. You can also hold towers/recap towers. It's not like alliance win all the time. Usually the best coordinated team wins. 
---
They weren't happy with AV but that doesn't mean the changes were for the better. Especially come TBC, their changes were mostly aimed at equalizing honor between BG's, rather than entertainment.
---
Furthermore, one should acknowledge that the feelings of the playerbase back in actual vanilla is not necessarily representative of the Classic community.
---
This update embodies my greatest fear with Classic, it seems Blizzard are always either meeting or falling short compared to Private server, whereas they should be striving to meet or exceed private servers.

It's possible and still optimal to zerg in terms of honor per hour no question, and the meta focused on that even on private servers that implemented past versions of AV. However with more NPC help on defense it's easier to defend so when people do want to defend and draw the game out into a real battle they will have more success.
---
AV is the worst anyways. I just want to grind it on AV weekend, hit exalted, and then never have to go through the nightmare of turtle games again. Gimme that Unstoppable Force. 
---
If I'm understanding this correctly, at 315 skill glancing and normal blows deal the same damage?
---
This is a bonkers opinion for a forum that is almost entirely here to critique and pick apart the changes for the re-creation of a 15 year old game.

People don't want old AV because private servers has old AV. Private server has old AV because vanilla players want it.

---
I agree with that but it doesn’t mean it should be horrendously bad in  dps though
---
Thanks! Appreciate your insight. 
---
No only vanilla fans should have the right to replay their favorite game.
---
^^/s (but seriously some people here actually think this).
---
Yeah mostly true.  But for practical purposes in instances, you didn't just get to healbot.  Like if your group wasn't great, you definitely had aggro issues and yeah priests had fade, druids had cower, pallies could bubble and shamans could drop taunt totem, even so you could still (and often did) have aggro issues on that same pull because your tank and dps were just taking too much damage through stupidity.  A lot of instances in vanilla seemed like if things started to go badly, you could focus up and recover **or** if you missed the opportunity to get it under control with cd.s and/or smart play, it evolved to the next level of chaos, which meant another big effort to control things, and if you missed that, it just started death spiraling.  Healers also had to budget mana pool so, worst case, they could ensure that at least they were the last one standing when the pull ended.  Also a lot of times you had to maintain cc as a healer, shackle, hibernate, etc.  Also you had to worry about mob abilities and range. Like for example if you got frogged in zf, that was pretty much a wipe with no trinket, or dino.s in mara, almost guaranteed one would get loose and silence you.

Well to be fair, theres a proxy discussion going on about AV 1.12 on the Private Server subreddit, and they cannot come to a consensus either.

Some people like 2 day long AV's, some people are saying no one wants that, just give me my marks and lemme out.

The rest are complaining that even when PServers implemented old AV, people still rushed the bosses anyway, LOL!

Statistics.
---
So play a different BG. I used to love that there was such variety available, but then by 1.12 AV felt not much different anymore from AB and all the amazingly fun slow paced battles were gone.
---
This is something I can listen while grinding out on OSRS.  Dope.
---
You’re right but mage has leeway, meaning it has other spec to do dps whereas ret is the only one for paladin and it should be modified in such a way that it’s viable for pve, though I’d like to point out that it doesn’t have to be up there with warrior or whatever 
---
I'm the guy reporting you all while spamming bg chat that the game is over 5 seconds in
---
I personally dont think its wrong to ask. I expected 1.12 because they did after all say that was the base like forever ago. But if they were to implement old AV I wouldn't mind at all really.
---
WOTLK was good but it could’ve been better. Heroics were too easy, previous raid tiers became irrelevant for the first time in WoW, TOC was kinda meh, GS and ilevel obsession, etc

---
Is there something in the background not working correctly? Or am I ignorant of Ramstein the Gorger not being in phase 1.
---
It wasn’t impossible, it was harder and less prevalent. 
---
We definitely aren't alone. I did AV only enough to obtain some easy to acquire loot and exp (on alts) and I moved on. But its very clearly important to some people, so I don't want to belittle it.
---
Just FYI, the reason you're getting downvotes is that because without WOTLK scrolls enchanters are at the mercy of the "generosity" of tippers.  Just look up "Adam ruins tipping" on Youtube and you'll see why the mindset of tipping sucks balls.
---
The reason you see &lt;your mats +5g&gt; nowadays is because a lot of the desired recipes are rather hard to get.  They require killing specific mobs, camping specific vendors, etc.  Sure, if someone is trying to charge you +5g on "Beastslaying" enchant, then tell them to go f\*\*k themselves.  
---
While you say you tip "generously", in reality it doesn't matter. (And I doubt you do).  The next person (if they followed your rules) would probably tip 0 and use the excuse "Well It's my mats, all you're doing is clicking a button!"  And to the enchanter they'll have a wash on income because you tipped 15g, but the next 2 people tipped 0. 
---
&gt; hate being told how much I have to give 
---
Don't ever grow up then kid.  You'll hate going to a nice restaurant with more than 8 people then. (forced tipping %)

Shadowmeld isn’t gimmicky when it allows you to sit nodes and the FR a million times betrer than a dwarf could ever hope to. Stoneform is only useful in 1v1s vs rogues, hunters and UD priests.

So you took patch 1.8 changes and just added 1.1+ even though they’re clearly not the versions people are asking for. 
---
Nice sleazy maths there dude. 
---
The fact is, the version of AV that the devs have chosen existed longer than 1.8- and 1.5. 
---
Oh you mean Classicast? I wonder how they got "spotlighted". Let's ask a Blizzard employee.

They now even have an actual Activision/Blizzard employee through MLG (Rich Campbell) with them in their Classic clique to go along with the incestuous Method who has cross employment with MLG (owned by Activision).  I love Esfand took credit for something that was complained about instantly (4 phases) with 100 posts on the forums with phases.
---
But, yeah I am done with this reddit and Blizzard. Either forum manipulation or astroturfing is occurring and you see this crap all the time from companies who are caught doing it like EA or everyone loving a movie like The Last Jedi on that reddit and any criticism was spam downvoted. I thought Blizzard was better.  I guess I just need to accept that Blizzard died the day their CEO left.
---
The shining light is that Activision is so out of touch with reality they think the fanbase of these streamers is more than a raindrop in a thunderstorm or that most of Asmon's fans (which is really all Classicast has) even played or will play Classic WoW. They are mostly kids, many of whom don't play WoW, who apparently Blizzard thinks they can trick into buying revisionist history. The backlash for people that spent MONTHS getting to 60 and waiting for AV to come out only to find out AV is ruined is going to be bigger than Diablo Immortal and it won't be kids. It's going to be people with money that actually pay for the subs.
---
See you on Nostalrius 2. Posting here is a waste of time and I don't want to give traffic to these clown content creators or Classic. Classic is going to be busted with a population of like 70 percent Horde on PVP servers and 80 percent Alliance on PVE servers and cross realm won't fix the problem unless they pit PVE against PVP which will make that 70 and 80 percent even worse.
---
Then dont watch it, simple.
---
They want it changed, but to a different version that still existed in vanilla. #NoChanges was about not having changes beyond vanilla. 
---
Huehuehuehuehue
---
Why does anyone play any class? There are numbers of reasons and they're all different for everyone. For me, it's because that's what I played back in Vanilla and also the class fantasy. Warcraft 3 heavily inspired my choice back in the day and still continues to. There was nothing cooler than Uther &amp; Arthas using the Light to banish their foes.
---
I started 3 months before Cata and just learned how to warlock in the talent trees to have to forget everything I just learned lol...  even did the water totem for a shammy alt lol! 
---
With the staggered release of content it would be interesting to see if participation and review warranted a BC server to either clone a toon too from a classic server and then similar for a LK... but that would be four to five years from now perhaps?
---
Oh.  Well, I thought you meant you would just refuse to heal them no matter what.   That's certainly different then not healing up a life-tapping warlock lol.  
---
I joined WoW in TBC so I've never experienced those hours long AV people advertise loudly. It seems an invitation to people just "hang around" or even afking, contributing nothing to the objective.
---
were goin home brahs 
---
TBH they were lowkey manipulated by the demons and brought to Azeroth by Sargeras/Medivh. The ingame horde isn’t the horde it was back then. 
---
OMG BUT MY PRIVATE SERVER SAID IT WAS 100% BLIZZ-LIKE!
---
Nice
---
But they heard this subs clamoring for #nochanges to Classic 1.12 
---
The balls were merely a setback.
---
I’m impressed you are responding to the questions involving the 10 min duration.  Bravo sir.
---
Why do you keep assuming it’s permanent?? it’s literally typed out that they will only use it for launch..
---
Science bitch
---
Thats just shitty uneven av with no objective. Give me real pvp, thanks. 
---
Time to run an instance can absolutely be cut in half with a good group.  Twice the xp/gold/drops.  So many times you'd be "I got an hour, I can run X once." then your group is good and 30 minutes later you're like "we're done?! how?"
---
This is low effort af.
---
+ bombers mines everywhere that almost one shot u 
---
Remember, if you ever wanna see a TBC/WOTLK server, classic has to be successful first. So support it and cheer on classic players with all your heart, otherwise you may never see you favorite iteration 
---
The Nostalrius wave was huge (over a million accounts created) roughly 3-4 years ago. When Kern brought the petition to Blizz there was hope... If a TRUE classic server was coming... we could bide our time.. 
---
And then.. ever since Blizz confirmed it- we have spent the last months saying goodbye to our loved ones and the world outside. We know what is coming. Oh yes... Only too well..
---
Yep
---
&gt; I think that the meta for AV changed, and people eventually learned that zerging was much quicker for honor than turtling for hours. 
---
You're exactly right. 
---
The AV meta changed right at the end of classic during the TBC prepatch. When the rank/decay system changed to honor points. R14 gear and weapons became rank unrestricted and were available to everyone. It became all about Honor per hour in order to get the gear faster because R12/13 gear were upgrades for a majority of the non-raiding player base, especially the weapons, which only cost 75k honor points. 
---
However, I'd really only consider that the final nail in the coffin. All the changes over the many patches to AV contributed to the meta changing. Reinforcements, weaker NPC's, removing NPC's, removing elites, shifting GY's, etc.

Good luck with the propaganda Classicast and Activision. Enjoy the stock falling when the real users find out what you did a few months into Classic.

Just done with this company. They are worse than EA now. At least EA is out front with paying streamers a million so we know they are shills. Activision does it all under the table, spotlights streamers under the table and tries to manipulate people and insults their customers intelligence.

The best honor per hour is a premade Arathi Basin.  People going for HWL didn’t step foot in AV except for a break from AB.

LOOK HOW EMPTY STORMWIND IS
---
Correct, 1.12 was when rushing the enemy base, with 80 players running past eachother, and ZERO PvP happening became meta - and has been for 13 years.
---
and this is why I've been asking about the AV version since the day classic was announced
---
1.12 is not the best version of AV - it's actually next to the worst(with reinforcements are the worst)
---
I played in vanilla, I started at 1.5, the npc nerf SUCKED - and korrak must be in AV. real vanilla AV is one of the most important aspects of the game for me, it flat out does not exist. there is nothing like the battles that last days and days. I would pay extra for the real vanilla version of AV
---
I think it’s both
---
My hopes are that we get Classic Vanilla, TBC and Wotlk
---
I thought they released an update like this just a week or 2 ago?
---
PVE people got raids.
---
PVP people got AV.
---
AV was end game for PVPers.
---
It is though.  People are gung-ho for that 1.6 AV.  Which I can't understand because it was still a zerg on the pserver I played on, except if you join late or die, you're fucked because you can't get past the mines and the elites without dying, especially as a clothie that gets 1-shot by mines.

" It was just one of many ways that classic WoW made people **not results-oriented.**  "
---
Not true at all, i dont how do you come to this really, really factually wrong idea.
---
People always take the path of less resistent. If old AV  would be implemented the majority of people IS gonna play AV cause it rewards the most honor/best for farming.
---
The only big difference is that people know almost nothing about the game back then and info was scarce. Thats go for alot of other videogames.
---
This can be seen in other areas as well. The reason why people for example are less likely to leave a dungeon in the midst of it and/or kick you is they would waste a fuck load of time to get a new player in there. Not because the vanilla game community is nicer or because they are less result-oriented. Quite the opposite infact, this is providing far better results.

After all these years the only thing on the character pane that I did not recognize was the stormpike insignia, but that makes sense because I played horde.
---
&gt; Thats just shitty uneven av with no objective. Give me real pvp, thanks.
---
TIL you need in-game structured systems in order to have fun
---
&gt;Ahahaha
---
&gt;So you took patch 1.8 changes and just added 1.1+ even though they’re clearly not the versions people are asking for.
---
&gt;Nice sleazy maths there dude.
---
No need to be rude. It's not my fault that you're not able to comprehend (or are willfully misunderstanding) the comment that I linked to. The numbers don't account for anything pre-1.5 (as that was the AV release patch).
---
But to break the numbers down a bit more (per patch):
---
**pre-1.10:** 
---
35 (1.5) + 63 (1.6) + 27 (1.7) + 85 (1.8) + 84 (1.9) = 294 days
---
**1.10 until TBC pre patch:**
---
84 (1.10) + 63 (1.11) + 105 (1.12) = 252 days
---
Why not do both? As you level up your char, you should also level up on your social skills and health!
---
Hre hre hreeeee, ah ahhhriiii, bah ti buraaaa, be puroooo, bah purooo OOOOooooooo!!!

Maybe I missed something but all I read was korok was removed.... I don’t think the sky is falling and maybe you should get some fresh air.

What private server had old vanilla? Best I've seen are 1.12 servers, WITH 1.12 AV, that had shit like Korrak spawned at SFGY that was easily killed with 1-3 people.
---
Have fun in your 45 min queue trying to get a 40v40 going without cross server BGs. 
---
While there’s not a huge difference between 1.10 and 1.12, there’s a but more difference between 1.5 and 1.8. 
---
Seems kinda unfair to lump those two in as if they represent the same experience. 
---
Out of left field here and tardy but... u must be a pleasure to group with.  
---
\&gt;thinking that wage determines competence and that companies won't just pay the lowest possible amount they can get away with
---
A true example for all would be paladins to follow
---
Really tho. They changed at because it was bad right? Who ACTUALLY wants to play a battleground for more than an hour or so anyway?  
---
We'll get TBC and Wrath if Classic is even relatively successful, it's the obvious progression from Blizz' perspective since they'll have the infrastructure &amp; team for it. It's free content steeped with nostalgia, Wrath even has character services. It's got Blizzard written all over it.
---
Why would I want inferior pvp? People who think of hillsbrad as the pinnacle of world pvp are so clueless. The appeal to world pvp is a dangerous world with organic encounters, not lining up and making a shitty Zerg that only ranged characters can enjoy. 
---
Wish there were more votes, but not too surprising. On this sub, we a response bias from all the die-hards. Some less hardcore (never did MC or aq40) players such as myself prefer the 1.12 version, but dont have the heart to speak up on 5 different "no changes!!!" threads
---
Yeah that surprised me as well.  I never raided.
---
Oh. I’m not sure Druid had a taunt. I never played them as I struggled with multiple action bars. I knew they were viable off tanks though. 
---
Wow. That's like 2 weeks of leveling or more

---
I can recall a time circa Burning Crusade maybe 2007 or 8, that my battlegroup(?) summoned the treant, and for the next week and a half all AV games were 2-4 hours as everyone was trying to summon.
---
I think, if the server wants it, the server will get long matches.
---
Surprise your healer is a paladin
---

---
Gold shire
---
not to be nitpicky but its a slippery slope. a lot of changes that blizzard made werent for the better, but it happened anyway. if were gonna go down that path then it can easily turn into "lets change this to this because it was for the better"
---
Only thing that sucks is when factions are imbalanced.
---
I have many screen shots from classic where I was in queue for 8+ hours without an AV game.  Horde would always lose on our realm so they stopped queuing unless a guild wanted to do a premade. 
---
I think some of these concerns are way overblown, 10min AVs? Not so sure that can be backed up. Wish there had been some pushback on that assertion and discussed a bit more.
---
And what stops the 5man rogue backcapping in this 1.12 version? That was not elaborated on at all and makes no sense to me?
---
Something that wasn't touched on, what happens long term if AV's last half a day like these guys seems to want? How does this affect people queueing for AV a month after its release? There's a real risk that AV dies because it takes way to long to complete, and no one wants to bother.
---
Yeah, there won't be progressive item stats, you better bet on that. Blizzard has stated multiple times that they only have the DB values of 1.12. I don't see a universe where they embark on a Nost-like expedition to the deepest archives of the internets to try and dig those up. And while they _could_ potentially dig up the raw visible stats, they cannot find drop rates or proc rates, because those are server-side only.
---
And it's the same with pre-1.12 AV: there is no _original data_ on the stats and pathing of the old NPCs, the old quests are gone and would have to be recreated, etc.
---
Classic WoW is meant to be a playable museum piece, a perfect recreation of what WoW 1.12 was, and that means working off of the _original data_. If the original data doesn't exist anymore, Blizzard will not (and in my opinion should not) guesstimate it to fulfil some BlizzNost fantasy some people around here have. They will make some concessions where they make sense, such as using a far more secure 7.3.5-based client or releasing content progressively, but they're not gonna make shit up like Nost did. Nost was concerned with gameplay experience and didn't have a choice anyway; Blizzard is gonna use 1.12 data and if that doesn't exist, bye Felicia.
---
Whether you agree with that or not, it's been made very clear that that is their stance.

&gt; So that folks could realize just how hard WoW was in the beginning, how much of a challenge it was, and what expectations were of players in a group.
---
Vanilla WoW has never been hard. It was only perceived as such because for a vast majority of its playerbase, it was their first MMO. They played on shit machines, with shit internet connections, had no idea what they were doing or even supposed to do, and the game was an incredible time sink from start to finish. For players that had any sort of prior MMO experience and the time to spare, Vanilla was easy. Stop perpetuating this bullshit.
---
Oi, shut ya' pie holes, nerds. The whole lot of ya
---
Most answers to this are going to be speculation and subjective. Are you talking PvE, PvP, solo, casual, min/max? As far as meta changes, the biggest would be that other classes can tank besides warriors more effectively. The lines blur a little more and classes become less specialized in how they help the team. Some classes are good no matter what. Warrior, mage, priest will always be good in their respective roles across every expansion. If you're gut is saying warlock, I'd maybe go with that. It's somewhat of an interesting class in vanilla tho, cause they have no spell hit through talents and no threat drop/reduction. That said, if you're going mostly PvE, I'd advocate for Alliance since Salvation really helps them. If PvP focused, probably go horde so you don't have to deal with WotF.
---
Everytime i see these polls i answer differently :p
---
The ride is the entire point of Classic.  No one is trying to world first a 15 year old dungeon.
---
&gt; lol you just keep repeating the same thing
---
That is what happens when you don't respond to an argument that demolished your position. It keeps getting repeated until you get it.
---
&gt; It's like you keep saying "You can't be a dick! Stop being a dick!"
---
Close. "It is entirely possible to break the unwritten rules of a game without breaking the written/coded rules. You are a dick if you do that".
---
&gt; I'm saying "I sure can be a dick, just watch me! Who's going to stop me? Oh that's right, NOBODY!".
---
I guess you must be bad at reading comprehension. My entire point is that you can be a dick without breaking the explicit/coded rules. If you really want to be a dick. If being a dick to other people gets you off. If that is the kind of person you are. You can do that.
---
Nobody said the rules would stop you. Because the entire discussion is about people who use the rules as their tool to be a dick to other people.
---
Last question I have since you have been so helpful. Any suggestions of professions, either for leveling and money and finally for when I'm 60 and going to pvp ?
---
No worries, can't expect you to remember everything from 15 years back.

Some great counter points, I wished they had sprung to mind but I had to rush to work and couldn't extend the call, I do apologise for missing these, they would have been great additions.  
---
I'm guessing the 5 man back cap thing might be map related? I'll have to ask the guys.
---
The 10 min thing does intrigue me as well, I know zerging became the norm in a way, but not sure how long it would take.
---
I too wondered about the appeal of the days long AV match, as hearing about that kind of thing back in the day had me staying away from it as a filthy casual.
---
90% of my in world time was from 05:00-10:00 local time.  I had just graduated and always had interviews/meetings/bullshit every afternoon and evening.  I wouldn’t get home till 23:00 or so.  I liked mornings a lot Bc of the slack pop and very very few “little kids” playing that time of day.  I had to log at night to raid of course but my farming and whatnot was always a morning thing.  The AH was great in the morning too. Lag in the Org AH was an issue for me do mornings were great. 
---
It was almost entirely the people playing, not the mechanics of the battleground.  You get plenty of zergs on pservers with old AV, complete with minelayers, elites everywhere, etc.  And when I was playing in retail Vanilla, it was fairly late on, after ZG release, with no mines and easier patrols.  It was still a long back-and-forth, although Alliance usually won because they had the better choke point.  In fact, on my server, the zerging started with horde, because we realized we either won fast or lost slow.  We'd grab 1 or 2 gys and then go straight for the kill.  Skipped Belinda and the aid station entirely.  But interspersed with these were games with 10 or 15 people on defense that ended up in day-long slugfests.

This will still happen. Dhks only really punish people going hard at the pvp grind. Once they get their gear they’re free to murder all the npc’s they want without consequence. Raiders don’t even worry about their dhks.

This is the ONLY thing I will miss about my old busted machine I used way back.  It did have a killer sound system.  The new box will hopefully be way better as far as performance but not nearly as much power to the air.  Of course back then my pc was still the center of my home entertainment world.  I never listen to my pc for music or movies anymore as I have much more convenient and frankly much better to look at/listen to options but once upon a time all my music and movies lived on a 5 pound brick of an external hd.   
---
For me, playing a 36 hour battleground sounds terrible. I'm glad they are going with 1.12 version. It sucks some people won't get it if they like it but this version sounds much more tolerable to me. 
---
&gt; Being stuck in AV is for 3 days might be fun for the first couple of times, but over time it will lose its appeal and less people will queue for it, resulting in massive queue times or it just not popping at all.
---
I'd argue otherwise. Look at the modern games which are popular, a lot of them are Battle Royale type games. Blizzard would be smart to cash in on the Battle Royale hype and give us the Epic Battle Royale type AV. Obviously, not battle royale because of factions, but with AV full of elites and NPC's, it adds a certain dimension to the zone being alive and dangerous, not just because of other players.
---
Players queue into AV because they want the epicness of a major battle and fight, not because they want to rush to the other teams base. At least, they used to...
---
Be real. Most of the people here pretending they loved early AV never played it.
---

Pservers had frankenstein versions of AV because we don't have info with pre 1.12 AV, but at least they try.
---
Thanks for the reply. Would be interesting to hear some follow ups if you have the chance to.
---
*definitely wants to play like that*
---
Conversely, does anyone actually enjoy what AV has turned into?  Yeah it's more efficient or whatever, but who is excited to play AV for any reason other than the easy honor on AV weekend?
---
The old AV, weird and janky though it may have been, at least had some people that *loved* it.  Which sounds a lot like vanilla WoW in general to me.
---
If u plan to never (rarely) solo and u love grouping and healing then go priest.  It’s gonna get plenty of groups and u don’t have to slog through the grind as a solo priest.   
---
&gt; Because the entire discussion is about people who use the rules as their tool to be a dick to other people.
---
No, the discussion was about playing like a dick is the "wrong" way to play the game. What was that you said about reading comprehension?
---
Profession you gotta go engineering for pvp. It's so good.
---
As for 2nd, I'd recommend something that makes you gold. Something like herbalism would work well for making gold while wpvp'ing.
---
You can go skin + herb while leveling for a bit of extra cash and then level engi later, but I don't know if it would be worth it.
---
You kinda proved his point there with that video.  AoE classes/Ranged classes clearly benefited way more from that mass world pvp than others did.  
---
I remember when Borderlands came out, and I told my friends, "why would I want to play first person Diablo?  I'll just play Diablo." And then WoW became third person Borderlands.

For the record, I loved Borderlands 1 and 2 once I got around to them.
---
Yo if you pee and it lands on ya balls...it must be REAL cold outside

In those type of engagements melee aren't useless. You simply have to hold back a bit and engage stragglers / make space. Charge/intercept mages who try to move forward, etc.

The AV update released earlier today said "PvP news *very soon*" which roughly translates to "*within a week*". I'd expect something on the PvP release timing by the end of the month *at the latest*. 
---
I think you’ve been afk today if you think no one really cares 100% about av.  Which is.... the joke.

Those games are over fast. If anything they are the opposite of an open-ended tug of war that could go on for hours or days.
---
Thanks. 
---
For five man's....a good tank can totally carry a group but neither dps nor a healer can.  A good tank sets the pace, provides the strategy, marks mobs, assign cc, pulls, silences casters and tells people when to step out of the fire.
---
But in raids it's a little bit different mostly because top tier healers will let you run with fewer healers and more dps.
---
I pally healed from vanilla through mid bc.  And I prot warrior tanked from early bc to wolk.  IMHO tanking requires far more skill than healing and it's not even close.  Healing is mostly standing still and clicking on grid or whatever raid frames.  Tanking is a dance with you and the mobs or boss.   High finesse.  I'd rather heal than tank in classic mostly so I can drink.
---
Nah, I been here fam. Same #nolife grp as always. Nothing's different from the response to this blue post from every other. A few people get wild, and the most vocal are the upset ones. Doesn't change that this announcement has about a 5% pull for the majority of players.

Uhm yes...and without russians.

I'm kinda torn. On one hand low lv pvp is awesome and bgs can give more of that, but on the other, I prefer wpvp and leveling, and pulling people from the first week or two from leveling and out in the world zones sounds disadvantagous for my wants...
---
Isn't that in the future?
---
Good point there. 
---
"Don't play undead." -Alliance Warlock
---
There's half-assing something and then there is dealing with pedantic sycophants who are demanding the universe and more. Going through each patch cycle would mean 12 different testing cycles and deployments a, probably leading to a diminished, half-baked experience with more bugs, ultimately simulating something that a miniscule amount of people are pushing for when most people are just interested in it for the classic experience.
---
It's funny seeing all this revisionism about how 1.12 was somehow not really Vanilla or a lesser experience. It was the latest, most refined version of the game. Blizzard put together a new team to focus on delivering an authentic Vanilla experience, and they spent a couple years doing so by testing and refining the content and design of 1.12 in the modern engine.. Expecting them to potentially invest years in replicating that for each Vanilla patch is madness. It's an unrealistic expectiation, period. It's outlandish to call the Classic WoW development half-assed; there were so many ways they could have actually half-assed it such as just doing it the way private servers do it and rigging up a half-working repack of an old patch. Instead, they invested thousands of man hours in developing an infrastructure for running an ancient version of the game on the modern engine.
---
I think it's likely. I think TBC has a huge fanbase and expanding to make TBC should be easy and basically free money with low risk.
---
As for changes?
---
All the hybrid specs (healer classes dps spec) became viable and strong. In TBC they now bring unique bonuses to the raid and you pretty much want one of each. So one shadowpriest, one enhancement shaman, one elemental shaman, one ret paladin etc.
---
As for pvp well it's completely different because pvp becomes about arena mostly. Warlocks went from being broken in vanilla, to absolutely retarded strong. Rogues went from being strong in vanilla, to almost warlock level retarded strong. Rogues do shit dps in most raids tho.
---
As for doing big deeps it's pretty much opposite of vanilla. In vanilla melee are the best and hunters and casters kinda suck, with warlock and hunter being the worst. In TBC like I said it's the complete opposite. So if you want something good you probably wanna go something in the middle like mage.
---
Everyone considers gnomes to be the bad guys.  It doesn't even need saying.  When people discuss this, they mean "who *else* is the bad gyu".
---
Easily you can tank anything in the expansion as far as I know not 100% on that. Like there might be one of two bosses you can't tank but feral druid is 100% viable. As an off tank at least one is optimal.
---
Many people confuse viable and optimal. Druid is a viable raid tank and an optimal dungeon tank. A warrior conversely is an optimal raid tank and a viable dungeon tank. 
---
If you wanna tank. Druid is a 100% viable option. Especially if you are willing to be an off tank. 
---

I can't help but think of [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-NjZp7Aurg) whenever I see that staff. I know it was named after Kevin Jordan, a WoW designer but I still associate it with the song ever since I payed Guitar Hero II.

Thanks, this is good advice! All the ones that should be bound, are those bounded to spells and what not?
---

So they make their living reporting on news like this, and the natural course of discussion takes it longer than people like. This is a bad thing. Noted.
---
So if a group of voices started demanding the return of Cross Realm BGs to Classic (because it was in Vanilla), is that “\#NoChanges”?
---
People never referred to it as 1.8 AV but plenty of people talked about "old" AV and how they enjoyed matches that lasted long enough you could come home from work/school and re-join the same battle you were in that morning.  This isn't something brand new no one cared about before.
---
they are bound to literally anything that you think could have potential use within a time sensitive situation "ie combat".
---
Can you find 3 people who said that?
---
People are just voicing themselves being disappointed..
---
Dw bout it you still figuring lots out
---
Yeah, Humans freaking suck!
---
Either way I’m dreading farming Lei of Lillies when it’s made available 
---
How is old AV best for honor farming? You barely get objectives and you get diminishing returns very quick. Old AV was the epitome of doing something fun which doesn't necessarily give you the best character progression (outside of the awesome gear rewards, which however take longer to get with old AV)
---
And yet here you are...
---
Seems to be a lot of controversy with this. Why not do a compromise and have cross server bg weekends like a double xp weekend where matches pop constant and so you can have weekends w 2 day Friday night to Sunday morning AVs and then weekends where they pop every 5 seconds. I’m probably crazy tho.
---
If you read zone chat in barrens, it was more like heavily used gym shorts. Odeur de toxique.
---
LOL... you did NOT disappoint... thank you!
---
I mean if they do that it's really cool but, I dont know that's its a bug. The waterfall is frozen which means it registers as a solid object. Being able to walk up it isn't a bug. It's just a shit use of terrain. That being said. If they patch it that would be great. 
---
Removal of body parts loot is combating botters? The fuck is this garbage?
---
Spells, with the most necessary being bound to the keys / binds you can use quickest. Also things like pet attack, pet follow and pet abilities should be bound. Consumables you use in combat, trinkets, mount, and other useable items should also be bound. Lower rank spells (for warlock this is less a factor) are also a thing.
---
What an outrageous load of shit. Making an ancient patch work on the modern engine is a god-damned miracle; it's something that takes a dedicated team and a ton of time and effort. Laziness would be doing what the private servers do; Blizzard actually had to reimplement most of 1.12 and recreate an authentic experience with the modern engine. Maybe if you had ever been in software development and worked with legacy code you wouldn't post something so breathtakingly ignorant.
---
Sure, theoretically they could have reimplemented all of Vanilla, provided people were fine waiting years longer for Classic for something so minor. That would be a huge undertaking. It would also be half-assed in some perspectives because they theoretically have the manpower to redo every single patch ever. Hopefully that helps you understand the concept of unrealistic expectations. Being cheap/greedy would entail not doing it at all because it's a huge cost area with a very uncertain outlook for actually gaining and retaining more players. Pretty fucking ridiculous to try to pin this on Activision, too, since the prospect of Activision micromanaging Blizzard's IPs is outlandish to begin with.

Congratulations on demonstrating why cherrypicking an older version specifically for AV (while the rest of the game is 1.12) is a bad idea; everyone wants a different version.

I agree, we should be duking it out in Hillsbrad and STV, I think they should(and probably will)add bgs later.
---
The quality of the gear alone should be enough reason to hold off on releasing it.
---
And my axe!
---
you might want to check out black desert 
---
For sure. Though it is a pretty cool thought to allow the vendors in before the bgs... Just to give lowbies some cool gear rewards for wpvp

Dig in 
---
I'm very disappointed we are getting 1.12.1 AV. No more battles spanning multiple days.
---
You know this is going to be the excuse they use when people flood the forums about how Classic WoW is not hard enough. "They just picked a late version! It was brutal at the *start*". In some ways it was, but the vast majority of the difficulty was artificial. You can already see the pivoting happening in this discussion; people are arguing that somehow 1.12 was not "real" Vanilla and they should have done every patch, which is pretty outlandish and unrealistic.
---
I feel bad for the developers making Classic; they are learning the true extents of purist pedantry.
---
It was not so much unfinished as it was exploration / exploiting.  But, does anyone remember getting into the water inside deep run tram? I vaguely remember someone going inside and looting the underwater chest near the monster
---
🎶You've got a fan in me, Oh you've got a fan 🎶

For more accurate polling representation. You'd collect more numbers and information, which should be the goal of the poll
---
Mr Smite in DM suddenly started dropping Righteous Orbs to get people’s Crusader-enchantsments going faster is what I think he’s talking about /s 
---
I searched for "quit", 3 results none had anything related to not wanting to play classic. Can you show an example or two of people saying this? Because I'm not digging through this garbage. You made the claim you have the burden of proof.
---
Right, but it didn't work and that's why it was changed. 
---
If you die in a group fight, then you are sent to the GY alone. You might not be able to get back to the main group without crossing NPCs. It's not fun to sit there doing nothing because you're trapped in no man's land.
---
Exactly, as much as I love vanilla wow and aware of how time consuming it is, sitting in an 10-20 hour long AV is something the minority has time for. I get it, it’s not for casuals and a casual won’t clear AQ40 most likely. But the hardcore no changes people make it out to be so that I have to quit my job, delete friends irl, invest in lotion and tissues and a shitbucket... ffs, we are getting classic back, try to enjoy it instead. 
---
Blackrock Mountain is also solid but I can't just walk straight up it, have it be so that you can't stand on it
---
The anticipation is making everyone on edge, I don’t think this sub can take it much longer.
---
I have no idea on item guessing, well, some, but I am tired.. but take an upvote for the work of listing all that out! Fun stuff. I am jealous as I can't get access to my old acccount, forever lost. feelsbadman
---
Damn, 5 pieces of Shadowcraft. Don't delete that. Preeeeetty rare, since most people destroyed that set at some point or another.
---
I agree.  My main concern is that I plan to start my twink build right after mount is paid for.  
---
wrong sub 
---
i did it for my IBS and occasionally pity tanked faction leader.  das it
---
Don't be afraid to ask people questions in game. Ask other warlocks for advice, group up for quests, let your 5 man know you're new and could use some guidance or feed back. 
---
Most people will be more than willing to help you out as long as your sincere and receptive. You'll get better that way and make some friends. A few people will be elitest assholes, but that's their own insecurities showing, so fuck em. 
---
Not really. This means we will get information soon, it does not mean classic is coming soon.
---
Yup. No matter what they do, they're gonna be crucified by their community for some minor insignificant thing that people probably misremembered anyway.
---
My #1 facepalm moment is still the outrage about sit-to-crit not working in the Blizzcon Demo. Yeah, no shit Sherlock, that's a buggy as fuck private server mechanic that _might_ have been in the game sometime prior to 1.6 or so. Certainly wasn't a thing in 1.12, but because every private server has it, it must be the truth.
---
Readying my strategic popcorn reserves for when the tryhards find out that world buff stacking pserver-style actually won't work, and what a complete shitshow the original Black Lotus spawns were. Nom nom.
---
I'd be shocked if they didn't release TBC in the future. Classic's development has been them making tools to import older data into their new systems. They'll have the tools and have the data, and the experience of having done a new old game before. 
---
3 updates in 19 days btw
---
I’m not digging through it again either it’s a joke you’re obviously taking a little too seriously my friend 
---
Would the staff of Jordan actually be considered to be a Pre-Raid BIS staff because of the spell power?
---
I play only old games now. Fallout 2 just now. 
---
Glad to have that clarified. That means I'll be able to save my sub fees for something else.
---
Tanks and Healers are important of course. But the DPS are the most important cog in the raiding machine. Here is why:
---
I'm going to be using chess as an analogy, it's a little crude but bear with me, hopefully it will make sense once I explain it. You're probably imagining the tanks as the King or Queen, and the DPS as pawns right? Wrong. The *tanks* are represented by the Pawns, the healers are the Bishops and the DPS are the Knights. The pawns protect the important pieces and take the brunt of the damage, the Bishops support the pawns and the Knights and the Knights make the game winning plays.
---
Without excellent DPS the raid would go nowhere, Blizzard added enrage timers for a reason; to prevent guilds from stacking too many healers to trivialize the content.
---
I'm getting a little sick of tank and healer elitism, sure without good tanks and healers the raid wouldn't go anywhere either, but ask yourself this. When the boss is at 1% and you have one combat rez left with 38/40 people dead, who do you revive for that clutch moment? One of the tanks? No. You revive a DPS.
---
I know this is going to tilt some of you but it's true: Healing is not that hard. It was a little bit challenging before people started using addons but with modern clickable interfaces and QOL UI elements that practically do your job for you, this was especially true during vanilla with addons like DeCurse.
---
Tanks in Classic have it pretty easy too, all you need to do is just spam Sunder Armor, dump rage with Heroic Strike and maybe switch stances now and then by pressing a macro. Sure tank swapping can get a little complicated, and I'm not denying that Four Horsemen is 100% a tank fight but aside from 4H, there aren't that many moments where a tank is the primary deciding factor in whether or not the boss is killed.
---
DPS? They need to keep track of *a lot* of stuff, resources (mana, energy), consumables, changing gear for certain fights, positioning during a fight and of course, aggro. Sure not all of these are exclusive worries of the DPS, but they get it the worst.
---
So yeah, don't snidely insinuate DPS aren't as valuable as the other roles, they are in fact the most valuable. Once you start raiding for any length of time you'll come to realise this too.
---
Okay. But this seems like a lot of armor, no? Is it a viable strategy for a priest to build crit chance to maximize this Inspiration triggering with a bear druid tank? Regardless of how stupid it is, it seems like a fun combo!
---
What’s the point of the poll if it’s leaving out what is probably a pretty significant part of this sub?
---
It was YOUR claim that wolfshead helm didn't stack with fervor, and that powershifting wasn't worth while, so YOU have the burden of proof, and have to supply evidence to support your claims. Not the other way around. 
---
TBC saw druids undergo a huge balancing which would distort all of the math there. Many talents were changed and scaling for various stats and abilities too. So no, you can't use TBC theory crafting in vanilla. Lmao.
---
If you had actually just asked about power-shifting instead of clutching at straws trying to discredit it (when you clearly know nothing about it) I would have happily obliged. 
---
Here's the guru Shedo's guide so you can educate yourself:

I’d rather they give us as close to 1.0 AV as possible, please. Shredders, mine fields, EVERYTHING. This is the true authentic vanilla experience. I want day(s) long epic AVs. Fighting at a choke for days, kiting entire zergs to mines to watch them all die, summoning epic npcs to push into the alliance or horde base to finally move some ground. Desperately defending from the enemies summoned champions trying to hold your ground.
---
Leaving the battle, going to bed, then waking up and joining the same struggle again? Man, that felt so good. That was such a cool feeling I’ve never been able to get before. Then once you finally break through, capture their final graveyard and enter the boss room and win the fight? You felt like you just won a decade long journey, and remember the people in /yell trying to organize and give orders. You remember the enemies who tried so hard to hold on and not lose. There were heroes on both sides, and it felt like a real battle.
---
All of this felt so EPIC and an experience you haven’t been able to ever get again in WoW since the massive nerfs. Give us our truly unique experience that’s the AV I remember from my times playing Vanilla back in the day.
---
AV went from a massive battlefield - a true war where every persons contribution mattered all over the entire huge map - to a a centralized zerg on a single objective where you ignore PvP to end the game faster due to all these nerfs over time.
---
You can get 15 min PvE rushes on live servers, and have been able to for over a decade. Classic should be where you experience the unique versions of how content originally was.
---
GIVE US DAY(S) LONG TURTLE AVS! GIVE US OUR EPIC STRUGGLE INTO THE HORDE OR ALLIANCE BASE BACK! GIVE US WHAT MADE THIS BG WORTHY OF ITS EPIC TITLE!
---
Or maybe it’s just not a very good joke to him? 
---
My answer to that is no. I can’t stand what they did to AV
---
It’s not that their asking for it,  it’s that their freaking the fuck out like this wasn’t even on the table before.  Their acting like they just announced xmog or something 
---
I can't imagine sitting for the required 18 straight hours to complete old AV was good for your irritable bowel syndrome, man.. 
---
I think we're seeing more regular announcements because Blizzard is listening to the debates about choices being made. So they're trying to calm down some of the fires by announcing changes to a previous plan or clarifying their reasoning. I don't think it has anything to do with a release date.
---
hahahaha.... wow, good point.
---
Obviously that too, but he’s clearly taking it too serious asking for sources of the joke specifically?  I’d say that’s taking it serious 
---
dad jokes for $1000 Alex
---
That was one very small specific sect of the Forsaken who did that against the orders of Sylvanas but ok.
---
*fingergunssunglasses*
---
I don't know why you're getting downvoted, this is definitely feeble and pathetic.
---
exactly, catering to the elitists rushing it for exalted items not for the fun of the game.
---
"i dont have time for this, let's make it quick". if you dont have time for this go do something you have time for, i enjoy a long AV battle. i dont feel the need to finish it today.
---
rushed AV is trivialized content, why would you shit on your own game?! 
---
&lt;(\^1.12)
---
Are you saying that the people who made the game should make an experience similar to the people that pirated the game?
---
“Boy, are you retard?”
---
DHKs punish people who want to do something like raid a major city. removing them could open up alot of potential world pvp. There are millions of ways to grief players in vanilla and I don't think  being able to kill some quest givers would make much of a difference.
---
As a healer you need to predict incomming damage, watch the group/raid HUD constantly, watch the encounter &amp; mechanics, manage your mana. It is much heavier on the multitasking side than tanking. Shamans and especially Palladins have it a bit easier than Druids and Priests but they all have in common that the reliability and output is much more skill dependand than the one of damage dealers. 
---
Comparing them to tanks is kind of difficult. Tanking is often just as faceroll as DPSing and other times it is really hard. What they both share is that these roles are unforgiving. You can really distinguish good from bad healers/tanks when things get south. This is strictly for PvE though. In PvP the ceiling for every class/spec is much higher and more equal.
---
Exactly. Wrath was the end of World of Warcraft.
---
This is what I want. I want to play 15 minutes of an AV and log out. Work the next day and come back to AV 16 hours later and it's still going. I hope to God they don't ruin this as it was my favorite aspect of vanilla.

Whatcha waitin' whatcha waitin' whatcha waitin' for?
---
Yeah that's what I figured. I play OSRS and the community is great. I'm expecting the same for Classic Wow and I'm excited.
---
Because some people have put Classic WoW on a pedestal and can't possibly fathom anything less than the 'true' experience. And anyone that wants AV's that last more than 2-3 hours, obviously has nothing better going on.
---
I enjoyed fast AVs.  It was fun to race the other faction to beating down bosses back when that was the only option.  
---

How about you just educate for the sake of education, rather than get on a high horse about. I mean, really, if your ego wasn't so huge you would have just linked that video and been done with it. :V 
---
&gt; Frankly I don't see anything wrong with a crafter charging for their service if you bring the mats. They went through the effort to level the profession and get the recipe (assuming dungeon/raid drop). They should be compensated for their labor, and a service fee guarantees that rather than relying on people to be good natured enough to tip.
---
I think it's a power thing. USians have a culture where the tipper has power over the tippee, and some people get off on this power. When someone they see as beneath them says "Nope, sorry, you pay a fixed price that I choose and if you don't like it then too bad" there is a role reversal, the power is now with the person setting the price.
---
Some people, as you can see, hate this loss of power so much that they will cut off their own nose to spite the enchanter and reclaim their sense of power. They end up poorer but they are happy because they think they have hurt the person who tried to assert power over them.
---
Is 1.12 the same AV, where you'd join Friday night, leave after 4 hours, sleep, and rejoin the same game the next day?
---
You also need to adapt as a great tank, depending on your group. Can you be more aggressive, go faster, play more defensive? Along with all that you have to know the instance in and out to excel, the healer doesn't. You also need a 360 degree view and like I said, play based on the group.
---
A healers game is much more the localized. Good healers are great but healers have no control over the dungeon, and will be less responsible for a wipeless run than a good tank who can forsee and avoid wipes.
---
I mean humans in Warcraft descend from the vrykuls, which were creations of the Titans along with the earthen (which would become dwarves with the curse of flesh). So humans and dwarves are related in a way but it's very far back in history.
---
I'm talking about World of Warcraft.
---
I'm not so sure. The hyper optimization will likely spread via contact, as people angrily flame others for not following the zerg rush.
---
I like the actual idea of scented candles for zones. As an ambiance guy the older i get I'm surprised I haven't thought of it. Thanks for the idea.
---
I would if you didn't have to grind it for the marks. The grind is when the big long battles become a true detriment. 
---
I'm assuming you meant BIS, not that you played alterac valley to support your irritable bowel syndrome?

Prepare yourself for 3 day long AV

He means binding the hearthstone to certain points.
---
Put me on follow, I dare you. I'll hook your ass on a lamppost so fast. 
---
I'm a rogue, period. 
---
If I gank you and you kill me back one time, I will ruin the next however long I feel like ruining for you. I'm very petty and hypocritical when it comes to this. You kill me one time I will miss sleep until you stop showing up or get away somehow. 
---
All it's going to take is one time for someone to ninja something from me and I will need on every piece of gear that drops, forever. So first deadmines run will ruin this most likely. 
---
I am an honorable rogue until you fuck with me one time, than I'm petty as fuck to you from then on. 
---
Don't mind me just RPing my class to its full potential. 
---
Also I'm a gnome just because I know they make people mad and disgusted. 
---
Yea your 10 seconds to drink is fine, we can keep the pace moving. My 10 seconds to drink means the tank has to stop.
---
Trolling is a art.
---
blackrock depths for me
---
just wait til they reveal that you will be able to get high warlord by playing less than 8 hours a day. heresy.
---
Razed naga! All I ever needed
---
I tried, but you consistently ignored people who tried to educate you by doubling down on your false claims or changing your argument. It looks like you did the same in the Paladin Tank thread, and the result was the same.
---
They weren’t that good.  It was basically Proto-wintergrasp/other pvp areas.  It was an overly engineered mess that involved trying to get players to do the boring parts of PvE like gathering stuff instead of encouraging people to go smash a guy in the face.  The one redeeming factor was that it was a better arena to fight in than the plains of Southshore and Hilsbrad.
---
Wrong 1.12 had battlegroup pvp
---
I disagree. 1.12 is 1.12. End of story

Good lord stop whining.  
---
Since Wrath was the high point for total subs, going to say you aren't the only one. 
---
Yes but op was just asking why horde is seen as evil.
---
Yea, I think I am actually gonna try this. mostly with scented candles if I know I am gonna be in a zone for a long time.
---
It means naxx
---
Still the horde and do you think the alliance cares? Forsaken killed Bolvar.
---
Hard call. If my crew goes Ally, Lock or Rogue. If we go horde, Lock or Sham.
---
You tried? Son, you didn't try to link *anything* to prove me wrong. :V 
---
Glad to hear that YOUR game experience is the important one.
---
Yah, I was just being pissy cause the one word reply.... 😉
---
I see (since I posted) that they use to have you going back to your bind point and not running back to your body before April 2004 when they changed the FAQ.
---
Oh yeah yeah! I remember now. Each form comes with a few abilities. The others you have to learn from the class trainer (as well as rank 2+) I remember cat form came with prowl. I remember something that you could only use outside be annoying at times. Thanks for the refresher :D
---
if you are emotionally challenged it doesn't mean the rest of the world is whining.
---
The people that made the game need to meet the standards of the people that pirated the game?
---
Have you actually paid attention to anything blizzard has said, or do you just read the headlines?
---
Think you replied to the wrong person...
---
I was in Indominous. That guild no longer exists. I don’t even play on that server anymore. Indominous was originally “we did it”. I was in Broken later. We rolled as a unit everywhere we went. 
---
ok then, let's pour all the raid content at once since 1.12 is 1.12.
---
&gt; I was just being pissy
---
Strange thing to admit over something trivial.  
---
They are more or less the same.  The horde was building itself up for years after opening the initial portal to Azeroth before sacking Stormwind, and they are doing it again on Kalimdor.  The fact that this time they conquered and drove out a bunch of pigmen and horsepeople doesn’t change the fact their MO is conquest.  
---
Do you blame entire races for the actions of a few people IRL too? I hope not.
---
Not really? Pissy is light hearted, that's why I winked... perhaps you are taking it too serious.
---
I actually bought that mouse and it was just too overwhelming. I ended up getting the one with 2 thumb buttons on the side and just use alt and shift modifiers for it. So it ends up being like 6 buttons instead of 2. I like it better. 
---
Can someone explain this to me?  What's the difference between 1.12 AV and the ones that other people are wanting?
---
can you quote the part where i talk about my game experience?
---
&gt;This is the true authentic vanilla experience
---
"1.0" (it's 1.5 btw) is not the version that was in vanilla the longest, so that's simply not true. 
---
They’re ‘recalling’ it from PServers. The meta is much better known now and people just zerg and use the wall jump. 
---
Source: played pserver and vanilla. 
---
Will take 3 days off + the two weekend days. Will get as far as I can in those 5 days (shit in traffic cone etc.) then go back to normal life. Playing maybe 2 hours a day max, 4 on Saturday.
---
No, I don't accuse the rest of the world. I accuse you, here, in this whining baby post you made loool
---
Yes, there's also time stamps if you just want to hear about something specific.
---
You can be good at raid DPS, just not as a ret paladin. That doesn't mean you can't do it. It means you wont be top tier at it. It also doesn't mean you have to raid as ret. There are other specs paladins have. Don't try to bend the game to what you want. If you want to raid as ret, just find a good group and uninstall damage meters. Ezpz
---
Decisions were made. It doesn’t mean they are shitting on the game.   Can’t please everyone. 
---

*In Alterac Valley*
---
I sense a pun in there somewhere...
---
Reporting is generous
---
&gt;Is it not gonna have all the NPCs and big elemental bosses etc?
---
Yes it is.
---
These two comments sum up the changes from 1.5 to 1.11:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b2zg97/alterac_valley_in_classic/eix4co0/?context=10000
---
"Salivating"
---
It’s not 1.12 though. It’s just a baseline. They clearly can and are willing to mix parts of vanilla’s life cycle to make a better game. 
---
To some it was a problem, I liked it personally and it seems like a lot of others here did too
---
Yeah I remember warlock being very strong towards the end of BC for both PvE and PvP. My first thought was warrior tank because I know they are strong from vanilla through BC but I also know there is room for basically one in a 40 man, which has benefits and detriments. I couldn’t recall if rogues were any good for PVE in BC though. My memories of that time are pretty slanted by the people I played with but I remember hunter and Druid tank being very strong also. 
---
People would be pissy if it was the other way around too, Blizzard has claimed that they don’t want to manange Classic much after release.
---
And contrary to what this sub is trying to say, not everyone shares the opinion that pre-1.12 AV was better lol.
---
Forgive my bad memory, but what are salvation and WOTF?
---
You didn't take a single screenshot until lvl 43?
---
I feel a lot of changes that blizzard made WERE for the better. That's the issue at hand... So much is a matter of subjectivity. 
---
Right. My main goal with these thoughts and this post is to try and determine a class where I don’t want to reroll. Plan on keeping the same main from vanilla to BC but I also hate being a shit class lol 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b31wr3/dear_blizzard_for_many_of_us_long_alterac_valley/eixmoby/
---
That’s not how it was and you didn’t have to sit through the whole thing.  AV was a the best true “war battle” scenario the game ever had.
---
Keep in mind that for a long while you had to actually queue up where the BG master was so there was always tons of folks waiting around to join.  There was no cross realm BG’s then, so at this point you would know the toon names of people on the other side.
---
You would sign up, fight as long as you could during the time and leave.  It was just the servers horde vs. alliance beating the hell out of each other for bragging rights.  The fact that you couldn’t just rush it and win is what made it distinct and fun.
---
Can someone tell me what the major differences are between the different AV’s? what’s 1.12 AV like?
---
Wow it's been a long time since I heard the term "KoS list". I forgot those existed because of the sharding and cross realm BS
---
I'll take the old AV over the boss zerg any day. It was fun to slip in for a while  to try and push with the pve quests NPCs or take towers. It felt like slow grinding mayhem, good for a nite cap or just to kill some time. 
---
you're having problems reading? i didn't said you accuse the rest of the world, i said that maybe you have a deformed vision.
---
next time dont bother replying, just type *loool*. prolly 6th grade is still a challenge.
---
also ad hominem cause arguments and critical thinking are not available at that age. so yeah, my daddy will beat your daddy any day because reasons.
---
Technically all the top dps mages in MC are arcane, people refer to them as frost mages because they cast frost spells as arcane spells are generally pretty meh.
---
So you:
---
1) never actually played the versions of AV in question, and
---
2) don't actually like pvp at all.
---
Nice attempted backpedal, but no. You weren't "questioning" anything, you just jumped directly to declaring that anyone who cares about this thing of which you are profoundly ignorant is "sad" and "needs to grow up."
---
For the record, I'm not even one of those people; I'm fine with any vanilla version of AV. But your apparent inclination to convert your ignorance into baseless namecalling is rather uncharming even when directed at others.
---
Exhibit a: This post.
---
r/ChoosingBeggars
---
They are staggering content, not the state the content was in. They've said they're planning on doing the same thing with raids. They will release raids in the order they came out before, but they plan to release the 1.12 version of them.
---
AV literally changed every patch since it was released till 1.12... Do you really expect them to physically change the map every patch cycle, changing boundaries, npc's, etc.?
---
In phase 3, would it be patch 1.5 or 1.6 AV? Phase 4 be 1.7 or 1.8?
---
It's only real if they saw Mankirk, not Mankrik.
---
you know you can find a guild in any other game and probably have just as much fun if you miss having friends
---
real talk, my undead rogue had the deathstalker bands, full chin. when cata came out I was missing my chin, so I threw on one of them metal bad boys.
---
Bro. I know you're sad about 1.12 AV. It really is going to be okay. Each of your responses shows me just how dear this is to you, and how triggered you are by it.  
---
I'm here for you. 
---
Paladins get Blessing of Salvation (exclusive to the Alliance in Vanilla). Buff that reduces threat generation by 30%. It actually lets someone put out 42% more damage on the boss before pulling aggro from the tank with how math works. WotF is Will of the Forsaken. It's the Undead racial that allows them to get out of sleep/fear effects (making it annoying to pvp against if you're a warlock).
---
Guaranteed epic to wear that will last till \~lvl 60 vs 20% chance of a free mount. I think you chose wisely. 
---
it also doesn't mean those decisions are good choices. and if they are bad choices maybe they are shitting on their game. or maybe they go the "cut off cost" policy.
---
Thats kind of the point. Vanilla WoW didn’t have QoL features for finding groups, and you were stuck on a small-ish server with 3-5k other people. It forced socialization in ways that modern games don’t.
---
Nice shot though, pretty low hanging fruit.
---
thx for coming, you can leave now.
---
*loool* - still no arguments or logic
---
Specifically someone from Classicast if I had to guess
---
Every time I reminisce about hamstring spam it’s a stupid Night Elf jump spinning over and over, prancing about like a ponce.

you don't understand the word "quote"? :)

Did you hear that they're going from a 3 phase to a 6 phase plan? They listened to the community about what DM would do to class balance in early raids, so they announced they would release it in phase 2, so it's more "blizz-like".
---
Just because we get the 1.12 version of all the content doesn't mean it's rushed. It means they have a small team, and want to release the game some time this decade instead of making every instance, battle ground, raid, zone, quest, etc. exactly like it was for every patch as we go along. They have to pay their programmers and internal testers and probably want to 1) make most of the community happy and 2) make some profit for their work
---
No. You're trying to make the class do what you want. Paladins heal in raids.
---
If you want to dps pick a dps class. 
---
I unashamedly play my Undead as a corpse eating baddie
---
they can change it every stage as they are releasing new raids. 
---

Like a cat playing with his prey. Pretty accurate feral RP.

Classic WotLK confirmed!
---
They have stated from the beginning they are reverting back to 1.12. They then state they are releasing AV at 1.12. Why is everyone pulling their tampons our early? This isn’t some one over on us. Shut up already 
---
I can completely understand how a lot of people can see it as low effort content, but from the flip side these guys have two choices.
---
1.  Make a fast video that can be put up hours or a day after a post.
---
or
---
2. Make a well produced, structured, video with any number of visual aid resources that could be used which would take days to produce.
---
The first allows for videos to be put up while the context is relevant, while the second is more researched and articulated.
---
I'm not sure which I "prefer", but I don't think I mind either way, and I personally like channels that do a little of both.
---
&gt; N don't bud me, pal

 &gt; They listened to the community about what DM would do to class balance in early raids, so they announced they would release it in phase 2, so it's more "blizz-like"
---
i don't see how is this relevant to the topic. i never said they don't listen.
---
 &gt; Just because we get the 1.12 version of all the content doesn't mean it's rushed.
---
you didn't understand what i said. rushed as in they are introducing the versions that can be dealt with very fast - trivializing content.
---
 &gt;  make *some profit* for their work

---
Because of the forsaken. I mean, there's a whole questline in hillsbrad that basically just revolves around committing genocide against the humans there while trying to deveop a new plague. One of the first undead quests you do has you testing dangerous potions on a captive dwarf. Taking a walk around undercity will reveal both a human woman turned into a mind slave and a group of captive humans forced to fight abominations for the amusement of the undead there. The forsaken may not be the scourge, but from a human perspective they're almost as bad. The horde would seem way less like the "bad guys" if not for the forsaken.
---
So much this. But I take this as a reason for no changes though... if we make lots of small changes saying "hey this is just to improve quality of life" or "Blizzard would have done this anyway"  I feel like that's just Blizzard doing Vanilla "reimagined". Which in itself is fine, but my experience of the vanilla community has shown people want to play vanilla again, not blizzards attempt at making a "better game".
---

Bruh, we have had two blue posts in the last 9 days. That's a lot and I have a feeling it's only gonna increase. 
---
I started college towards the end of vanilla and really didn't have time for much outside of raiding obligations. I honestly hadn't realized until all the recent discussions, that AV had been changed so drastically towards the end. I was very much looking forward to the old epic 4+ hour long slug fest I remembered. Very sad :(
---
Not that im surprised blizz took this route but classic AV is a trip. Classic as a whole is a nostalgia trip for many and fucking day long AVs and stalemates were a part of it an a memory for tons of people who played it. The version we ended with was the best battleground but old AV is special. I havent seen any outrage about it yet but it isnt all BS about nothing. Old AV was a part of what vanilla was
---
still avoiding, huh?
---
Irritable bowel syndrome?
---
Not a dank meme 
---
Or the Australian version:
---
Hamstring! You are out of range.
---
Charge! Target to close.
---
People just whine, bitch, and moan at anything. They haven’t changed anything from the version that was available at 1.12. Yet people are crying “oH mY GoD ChAnGeS”
---
&gt; Shut up already 
---
i agree. ppl like me should be banned. dont forget the report button.
---
Jesus Blizzard didnt kill your uncle. They are putting in a version of AV that came out AT THE SAME TIME as the patch classic is being released on. “NO CHANGES EVER” but wanting older AV is literally a change. You people need to chill the out and just be happy that wow classic is being released at all. 
---
I'm personally more worried about the community. I worry we'll take all the negatives of today and lump them into classic. I'm hopeful though. 
---
Dude. Grow up. Read a book or something.
---
Can? Yes. Would it be worth all the work? Maybe.
---
Would they see more subs because of it? Maybe. Would it be financially viable? Definitely not.
---
If and when classic shows itself to be a long term sub retainer for blizzard and the community starts to  ask for older versions of content they might consider it.
---
Most of the community wanted classic to release a year ago. You can't blame blizzard for wanting to release an official quality game in a reasonable time period. If that means some *minor* corners get cut (like only getting the 1.12 version of AV), then so be it.
---
I turned mine into tier .5 in 1.10 :(
---
Part of what made it old AV was that nobody had any fucking clue what to do. You were presented with a map full of players and objectives and you really didnt know what any of them were for. Tons of people didnt even know how to actually win. Things like this we wont be able to recreate in vanilla becuase WoW was what got millions of people into MMOs/RPGs. People just arent noobs to this type of game like they were in 05
---
still cant sustain that with logic so just throw the insult in there.
---
so you're accusing me of being stupid? heh, funny
---
I like this place. It is good :)
---
Haha Nice roll, he had no chance you doubled his roll
---
You’re melodramatic.
---
Nobody said to ban you. You just have a stupid opinion. Bashing something that isn’t even released. Calm your sweaty tits nerd 
---
I love this idea so much! I did a bit of research, and I have a suggestion for what I think might be the ultimate version of this concept: fragrant oils. 
---
I'm very seriously considering buying a diffuser such as this one:
---
https://www.amazon.com/ASAKUKI-Essential-Ultrasonic-Aromatherapy-Humidifier/dp/B01MR4Y0CZ?ref_=fsclp_pl_dp_1&amp;th=1
---
Next, gotta find all the oils.
---
I'm gonna be starting in the elf zones, so something like this for example seems perfect:
---
https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ashleigh-Burwood-Lamp-Oil-Fragrance/dp/B075JGPQ27
---
I'm even more excited for classic now! Thanks OP!
---
Old AV where you had to queue at the portal and matches lasted up to a day or more because mobs were tough and people were noobs back then compared to today. Blizz made the right choice IMO but old AV is and was a huge part of old vanilla. It was a war between the factions on a server. As a Queued PvP Battleground it sucked but it was a place to go have huge battles against your opposing faction and IMO that was dope and one of the many factors that made the faction divide and loyalty what it became. 
---
In a perfect world the hunter leads the 5 man.
---
Have they actually said that? I just thought they said they're still thinking about how to roll them out and that rewards wouldn't launch in full in phase 1.
---
yup, really on topic :)
---
i would like to inform you that i am growing up while reading a book while typing this. who would've guessed?! 
---
happy?
---
A dps warrior can still taunt things off the healer if need be, idk, sounds fine to me, no reason to discriminate the arcanite reaper dreamers out there
---
&gt; PERSONALLY, i think this change makes no difference. I think that the meta for AV changed, and people eventually learned that zerging was much quicker for honor than turtling for hours.
---
This I agree with 100%. Half of what made vanilla what it was, was because people were noobs and most had NO experience with RPGs or especially MMORPGs at this point. People didnt really "get the point" so to say like we do today. Even if there was Old AV then someone would figure out the best way to cheese it for the most honor then share it online and it would spread from there and soon it is the expected strat for any future BG. Thats just the name of the game now. 
---
That is because it's irrelevant outside of the auction house or unless you are on an RP server. He's also likely on a dead shard.
---
I guarantee if Blizzard brought back pre-1.12 AV, before they nerfed NPC health and removed the elites, it will be same shit show it was back then. As mentioned, no private server has been able to replicate the "real" AV experience. But, 1.12 AV without reinforcements is still good. AV is Alliance favored. Almost makes me want to roll Horde to win. Almost. I'll be farming WSG anyways. ;)
---
NA here, but I had a potato computer at one point. 
---
As a priest: shadow word pain! Target out of range. Mortal strike hits you for too much damage. Power word shield! Auto attack hits you. Auto attack hits you again. Execute hits you for your max health total (900 absorbed)
---
Gaping holes.
---
This is weird to me, though. A benefit of being a warlock is waiting less time for slow and lazy fuckers. The shard is not really much of a cost and it saves you your own time. Besides, it's not like you're "reinforcing bad behavior", all those people Will continue to be that lazy regardless of if you make them waste everyone's time. 
---
You sure that wasn't the smell of rotting centaur flesh in Desolace?
---
First of all stop being so condescending. Saying someone having an opinion must mean theyre some 30 year old who needs to grow up or that if they want to play the game this way or that is sad is just ignorant and doesn't further any discussion on the topic. 
---
The thing is pretty much nobody played the entire BG but it was epic to work towards something, go to school/work, then come home to continue on the effort. If you didnt like PvP turtle wars then you didnt have to play or could go to either of the other BGs that are quicker and more straightforward. 
---
you should be arrested for not having show extra action bars enabled
---
Excellent post. In response I'd like to ask you, and anyone else vanilla knowledgeable, about some specific class quirks to help me decide.
---
I'm a rogue player. It's just the fantasy that clicks with me. As a player, I also tend to like added restrictions or choices that further define my character. Specifically for Classic, I don't want to be the same sword wielding identical combat spec rogue as everyone else. Can you speak to the viability of playing only daggers? How does that look during the 1 to 60 process? Is it miserable, or only slightly inconvenient? How does it look at 60? And in pvp?
---
I've been toying with the idea of playing prot warrior simply because I don't want to be left behind by sweaty turbo minmaxed melee dps. I love minmaxing as much as the next rpg fan, I just can't bring myself to play generic pleb rogue #46248.
---
Thanks in advance for any replies, if there aren't any, I can post this in a more suitable place. I just felt like formalizing my dilemma in writing somewhere.
---
Yes, you're the only one...
---
You're hella salty for no reason lol. We're on a thread talking about PETTY shit we do in WoW...
---
You can doubt me all you want but it doesn't change what I actually do, and I'm quite secure about my gameplay habits which is why I'm sharing here in the first place...
---
What did you think I was gonna say? Fuckin over here talking about eating out at restaurants as if I'm buying Dreamweave Gloves for 8 😂. Also talking about OTHER people's tipping habits as if they have anything to do with mine. 
---
You need to loosen up man, that vein on your neck is getting a little pronounced.
---
It's either that or chuck norris jokes in barrens chat pick your poison
---
Its more sandbox progression based, whereas WoW is linear.
---
I started out playing it as a grind for the white wolf and the awesome items. The ice barbed spear is a godsend to warriors needing an easy/free weapon. 
---
However, while I started it for the rewards, I loved old AV. Spent days on end playing it. It was like a secondary world. It didn't feel like a battleground, it fight like a whole nother zone, an amazing one. 
---
Iron jaw master race
---
I think you are right at the beginning but i think it will progress once a strat is "figured out" and shared online then 60-70% of players consider it the right thing to do and push it on to everyone else. Basically how every meta works in any game lol
---
&gt; i don't see how is this relevant to the topic. i never said they don't listen. 
---
It's relevant to show that their plan from almost the beginning was to release things in their 1.12 state, but to stagger the release date to mimic the vanilla timeline.
---
If you mean "rushed content" means 1 hour AV instead of 48 hour AV, we have a very different definition of **rushed content** which usually is describing things like superman 64, where they had about 15 minutes to design a game to match a release time and just wanted to get it on shelves regardless of quality.
---
&gt; you've lost your sense of proportion if you describe billions as "some profit" :)
---
You've lost your sense of proportion if you think anything less than billions will convince Activision-Blizzard they made the right choice and to continue to service the realms instead of saying "well, we did it, so stop complaining. no one played when we remade it"
---
I mained a Tauren Enhancement Shaman for both pvp and raids all the way through WotLK, and it was both a blast and incredibly frustrating lol.  I'm debating whether I want to put myself through it again because I love the class fantasy, or try something new.  Maybe a Warlock or Rogue.
---
Ya, warlock seems way too high.
---
1.12 AV is good. No reinforcements, which killed the spirit of the whole BG. NPCS can be rough, but manageable. It'll still require a lot of people to take down Drek/Vann, a solid core group plus a fuckton of DPS making corpse runs. I don't see the issue.
---
Old AV was epic, day-long battles. Maybe it wasn't loved by everyone, but I think we can agree it's way more interesting than the PVE rush garbage it turned into during wrath.
---
The fuck happened to #NoChanges? This feels like you all want to have your cake and eat it too.
---
2 can be as bad as 1. Its the loneliest number since the number 1.
---
Surely they should all be scented Vanilla?
---
Give us as close to 1.0 AV as possible, please. Shredders, mine fields, EVERYTHING. This is the true authentic vanilla experience. I want day(s) long epic AVs. Fighting at a choke for days, kiting entire zergs to mines to watch them all die, summoning epic npcs to push into the alliance or horde base to finally move some ground. Desperately defending from the enemies summoned champions trying to hold your ground.
---
This is probably the best post on the topic I’ve ever seen. Brings me back man...

---
Potion in the bag with thistle tea is either jungle remedy or elixir of posion resistance
---
&gt; So are you saying you want Naxx in at release and no AQ launch event?
---
Nobody said that.
---
&gt; At this point I have to wonder if this isn't astroturfing/forum manipulation.
---
Yikes.
---
&gt; Maybe I am just underestimating how stupid people can be and how easily they can be manipulated by content creators with such curious logic.
---
Oh you're one of those "free thinker" types, the ones that think that anyone with a differing opinion must be parroting a streamer/influencer.
---
Wait, are you an alt account of the same sperg that was crying about astroturfing whenever they got downvoted a few months back? Man that guy was a riot, love how similar you sound to him.
---
They are too busy dpsing, trust me
---
 &gt; Would it be financially viable? Probably not.
---
in the same note maybe it will be financially viable. if it's *maybe* then it goes both ways, right?
---
 &gt; If and when classic shows itself to be a long term sub retainer for blizzard and the community starts to ask for older versions of content they might consider it.
---
prolly if they gonna invest a little in it maybe they can get a bigger chunk of the private server population that has been there for ages. maybe they can call in the profits instead of waiting for the profits to come to them?
---
 &gt;  Most of the community wanted classic to release a year ago.
---
most of the community wanted classic 10 years ago. they've kept playing for all these years. looking back one more year doesn't mean much :)
---
 &gt;  You can't blame blizzard for wanting to release an official quality game in a reasonable time period.
---
realistically i cant blame blizzard for anything since they have the actual data on the business, the demographics, the reach blablabla. but i can still express myself, freely. i can still mock the 12 yo that says that i'm stupid, ugly, is fucking my mum etc because i decided to go against the wave, bubble, the flock with valid concerns.
---
also realistically corporations will fuck their customers with every chance they get. ;)
---
DM came with 1.3.
---
Dungeon nerfs were way before 1.12, and before 1.10 even.
---
Easy pvp gear was during the TBC prepatch.
---
Stop talking out of your ass.
---
&gt; plenty of people talked about "old" AV and how they enjoyed matches that lasted long enough you could come home from work/school and re-join the same battle you were in that morning. 
---
That is definitely what I remembered and loved about it. If classic isn't going to have that, that's a bummer.
---
If you spec fire, you'll have to arcane missel spam through MC and BWl. Fire spells full resist on most of the mobs in there. It's lower DPS than frost, but depending on your guild you can probably get away with it if you want.
---
Honestly, you just kinda have to get used to the idea of getting stuck as frost spec for the first half of the game. 
---
I rolled a mage later into classic as an alt and my guild was raiding AQ at that point. However, this was an alt, so I was taking it to MC/BWL/ZG in farm raids. I was PoM pyro build all the way, it was too fun to delete someone on cooldown. My DPS was decent enough in MC/BWL, just not as good as it should of been.

---

---
Ah right. I played alliance so I knew about salv just forgot. That 42% thing I didn’t know. That’s cool info :) thanks 
---
&gt; If you only finished 50% of something you still got like 30% of the reward you would have gotten for finishing it. Nowadays if you lose a BG you might as well have not queued at all.
---
That's the big part, I think.  Modern WoW could be fine if things didn't feel like an absolute waste of time when you lose.  I was doing Rated Battlegrounds for example, and in order to progress towards the season mount, you have to get wins.  And you have to get those wins above a certain rating.  So even if you got 2 wins in a row, if you dropped below 1400 or whatever because of a loss, those are useless wins, and now because win rate is generally 50/50, you're more likely to lose again anyway.  Not to mention that wins bring in less points than you lose from losses.  So in the end you have like a 90 win/50 loss.  And I'm personally playing with PUGs, or groups I've found online, and they're not really reliable and they're not better just because they're in groups.  I was really determined to get that hippo, but I ended up giving up at about 70%.

---
I don't really know why blizzard tried to change AV into a typical short-form battleground. They threw out something completely unique in gaming and all they got in return was something so unfun it led to the addition of BG queue vetoing.
---
Though I never played classic nor any private server, the speak of the legendary days long AVs from people who seemed to play the game at the time always seemed such a cool thing to me and honestly was one of the main things I was looking forward to being apart of. I really hope the meta doesn't become a zerg like modern day wow.

you're telling me to shut up and i'm melodramatic?! :)

CONEHEADS

All this reasoning about old AV being a drag doesn't make sense. In the same way you could argue that classic was a drag and so on. Of course all the patches and changes were made with the player community opinion in mind. Yet, this is the part where it's easy to slip toward the classic "You think you do but you don't" argument. 
---
I, for one, am not fond of AV played solely via blitzes, without regard for tons of activities originally designed in. The loot looked gross to them! What a logic! 
---
While it's understandable that 1.12 is the version they are using a basis, but if there's going to be content time-gating, might as well tweak AV towards the older style to some extent. 
---
I fucking knew it was the same guy. 
---

Get 40 horde and 40 alliance on your server to all queue at the same time under the condition that nobody completes any objectives and everyone just meets up in the middle for 10 hours. 
---
Problem solved. 
---
If people tipped well in the first place, then the crafter wouldn't feel the need to do this right?
---
I'm being petty/stubborn because this isn't how it was back on retail vanilla on my server. Maybe that community had healthier tipping habits?
---
Since you wanna jump to conclusions and make it cultural, how come this wasn't the case on my US server back in retail but it was highly prevalent on private servers when I finally played alongside EU? 
---
You say I see crafters as "beneath me" which is purely conjecture, yet your comments indicate that you see people from the USA as power hungry and corrupt.... 
---
*Wailing Caverns intensifies*
---
&gt; I think that the meta for AV changed, and people eventually learned that zerging was much quicker for honor than turtling for hours.
---
Didn't you get honor from PKs in vanilla, not BG wins?
---
priest walking by dropping fortitude and not rez'ing is even funnier. 
---
&gt; The rest are complaining that **even when PServers implemented old AV,** people still rushed the bosses anyway, LOL!
---
Thats why this whole discussion is stupid. If people want a version of AV that won't turn into a rush fest, it needs to be AV 1.13. Because every previous version of AV is susceptible to rush. 
---
Uhm, guess I should be the odd man out here and say that you probably shouldn't get so caught up in the game that your real life goes in the dump. It's dangerously easy to fool yourself that the game world is all you need, especially one as large and full of promise as vanilla WoW.
---
I dropped out of college the first time largely because of video games, WoW among them. I don't really *regret* it, because there wasn't much I could have done - still had a lot of maturing to do - but it definitely would have been better for my long term prospects if I'd been more responsible.
---
lack of trust 
---
You try to code a 2017 video game engine to be compatible with assets from 2006 that were only compatible with completely different client-side and server-side code while making sure to remove as much 7.2.5 residue as humanly possible while also fixing errors, rewriting the serverside code from basically scratch, adding in the modern anti-cheat and anti-bot code, while picking through every single archive of every small little detail (some of which may not exist, so you'll need to average out eyewitness accounts which are somewhat inaccurate), to make sure it is as close as possible to what it was like in 2006.
---
Yeah it's not too easy.
---
This blizzard 
---
Do you even game bro? Everyone knows a PvP instance isn't epic unless you can play in the morning, go to school, watch two episodes of of Zach and Cody, and then comeback to the same instance still going on. 
---
Can confirm. OP is the only one. Ever.
---
They never said they were using 1.12 wholesale, but as the base.  This is obvious as they are not having every single raid, dungeon, and battleground in at launch.
---
This is such an absurd statement. People want Classic, as in Vanilla, as in no changes. 1.12 AV isn't bad and I don't have a problem with it but I can see why people would be upset.
---
I haven't seen anyone say that, but not playing a videogame because it's missing something significant isn't man-child behavior.
---
This feels like a bit of a over statement sure its not the best news but its not the end of Azeroth.
---
But Blizzard do please give us AV in its original terribleness.
---
They aren't taking it away. They're just not giving it back.
---
I didn't enjoy either version honestly.
---
I just wanted to get exalted asap then never return.
---
I grinded exalted back in 1.7 and it was a slow and painful grind.
---
Doing it again on after 1.11 on an alt was so fast in comparison, so I'm not mad about it being the 1.12 version. 
---
In my selfish opinion of course.
---
They shoulda' just released classic servers (like 12 years ago), and then made WoWII like they obviously are doing now. And it still won't be the \*perfect\* game, haha.
---
 &gt; If you mean "rushed content" means 1 hour AV instead of 48 hour AV,
---
were talking 20 minutes AV not 1h. i'm sure superman 64 is a great story but not gonna google it right now.
---
&gt; You've lost your sense of proportion if you think anything less than billions will convince Activision-Blizzard they made the right choice and to continue to service the realms instead of saying "well, we did it, so stop complaining. no one played when we remade it"
---
yes, we clearly have different definitions. do you think that if classic will make  say 3mil profit they will close the project? i mean you do admit that million is microscopical compared to billion right? so they will throw away that million because it wasn't billion? 
---
&gt; "well, we did it, so stop complaining. no one played when we remade it"

maybe no one played it because you made it dogshit? because you thought you were saving money by damaging the game and thinking that you will repair that with PR, astroturfing and influencers?

PServer AVs are 1.12 aren't they?
---
&gt;Why would I want to go back and play the same shitty BG I can play Today
---
Yeah! good thing we can go play arathi basin and warsong gulch to get that fresh and unique vanilla experience :)
---
They're the same sperg that were crying about [astroturfing](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9yqtg9/how_blizzard_created_the_leaders_that_now_speak/) and Classicast and talking about [reporting the mods of this subreddit to the FTC](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9ysckf/this_reddit_is_now_engaging_in_shadowbanning/). This isn't anything new, they're just using this announcement to propagate their conspiracy agenda.
---
Everything you just mentioned (mobs in Field of Strife and land mines) are in AV on private servers. People still zerg to the boss while maybe killing a general or two. 
---
&gt; Sincerely, ~Everyone that wants a better version of AV
---
That's a weird way to spell 'vocal minority'.
---
It wasn't done earlier. 5-man Loatheb was only possible after the 2.0 patch. That's when that video was made.
---
Four Shadow Priests in one group with Vampiric Touch gave them essentially unlimited mana, allowing them to go balls to the wall with their damage, which in turn allowed them to keep the Warrior alive with just Vampiric Embrace.
---
Not gonna lie. My fresh 60 Ret Pally's first purple was TuF thanks to several dozen PvE races over two AV weekends. 
---
indeed it does, and there is an armor cap (I just don't know the value) but you have to keep in mind that armor becomes less effective per point the more you have. 
---
Thank you for your contribution, Activision employee
---
I played both and here is how i recall it.
---
Old AV: Fantasy war effort between the factions. Very ineffecient way to farm honor but noone cared. Many quests and lots of stuff to do. A completly new zone to check out.
---
Quotes: Push the enemy back!!! we almost have reinforcements ready. Rogues did you capture the mine? Damn they have a rank 14group, we need some more healers to the frontline or they will push us back. We can still win this if we work together. 
---
New AV: A race to see who can farm honor and Rep the fastest. Still ineffecient but just less so. Not a zone just a BG.
---
Quotes: Avoid fighting the other faction at any cost. You fooking morons why did you fight them at the bridge. Im going AFK this is BS. Report anyone not at bossfight they are idiots. What are you doing the quests for. Try next time to run around the zerg and not fight them at all.
---
I think the safe bet would have been to put in Old AV and change it if no one likes it. Some people like PvP just because it is fun. They are the ones that would see Old AV in the game. Old AV well be forgotten if Blizz does nothing to save it. 
---
Why would you regret that?!?!
---
I mean his comment came off dickish but he's also not wrong.. and your response doesn't really counter his
---
Man, I thought 1.12 was the reinforcements patch. I'm fine with everything else besides putting a limit on how long they can last. It's not like there won't still be turtles.
---
This is beautiful! Would it be possible to get a version without the dotted lines, added zone names and levels etc? Just what you would see viewing it in game.
---
&gt; Can anyone explain why 1.12 AV will lead to this disfavored playstyle, and why pre 1.12 AV would not lead to that playstyle?
---
Probably not.
---
I think most of what people "know" about AV is fourth-hand folklore they repeat to each other, or distant memories of early retail before strats were worked out.
---
There was never a version of AV where the NPC mobs could stop a coordinated 40-toon zerg. This is just common sense, if the NPCs could do that then battles would have literally never ended.
---
So the critical question is whether the general mass of people queueing think they will get more honour per hour farming HKs in pitched battles or zerging for the enemy boss, and the consensus seems to have fixed on it being better honour/hr going for the boss.
---
No amount of backporting AV to earlier versions will change this player behaviour unless they make it so that the rewards are clearly better for fighting the enemy zerg than they are for ignoring it.
---
That spec. Combat, using a dagger, shoot gun is on the hotbar way ahead of other important stuff, Adrenaline Rush nowhere to be seen, at level 43.
---
Okay I ate dinner and then completely forgot about the writeup... Until now... So here it is.
---
DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT PLAY HORDE, I Have played VERY LITTLE horde and everything I am about to say about shaman tanking I have read or researched. I have not experienced, so if it is worse/better than I am saying. I am sorry but this is my impression. As far as paladin vs druid I play and have played for over a decade now as well done massive amounts of research and seen plenty of in-game dmg meters etc etc etc. But all of this is only my own personal view so please know I do not claim perfect knowledge, I can be wrong. I also want to make it clear that this is a veteran/experienced players understanding, not more than that.
---
Okay so I will start with my least knowledgeable, shaman. Shaman talents the first time I went and look at them and now every time i look at them make me laugh so hard I fall out of my chair. There are talents that make you think wait why the fuck is that a talent. (2h wep spec, Like LUL respec lose all wep skill.... LOL) There are a handful of talents that greatly influence your ability to tank, like 5% block is decent, 5% dodge, 10% armor, the ability to parry. (21 point talent to just gain the ability to parry.... Fucking LOL) these talents probably are not a must to tank early-mid game, but id say mara (mid/late 40s) and on they would be very very helpful. They have plenty of spells that give high amounts of threat which 20 yard range, threat gen on a short cooldown is SUPER useful. As well totems to beef up your defense you really wont take that much damage from lowbie dungeons. Shields generate about 50% of your armor while leveling up, this number can drastically fluctuate as if your shield is underleveled compared to your gear or overleveled. If you have per-say commander's crest at 23, itll easily make 60% of a shamans armor. Having access to a shield gives decent mitigation not amazing but decent. The additional effects such as lightning shield and other spells will give shamans better versatility tanking than per-say a warrior at the same level.  
---
That is a huge wall of text so I decided to start another one, i am expecting at least 3-4 more since this is a full write-up. Shaman overall tanking is fine to later content, then I personally do not have much info on how they tank level 60 5mans so maybe a shaman player can clarify. Now to Ret-Paladin, or retadin. Ret is boring as fuck, this is the thing ret-paladin is MOST known for. You right click a mob and wait 20 seconds before pressing any other buttons and then move on. In late game pve you right click the boss and bubble out of mechanics its fucking dull. Some people enjoy it sure, they can who cares its a game. Now how much damage does a ret paladin do? From my experience try-hard rets do about middle of the road damage. They are reliant on having the right gear, and the right consumes etc etc like every other melee. So it is very very easy to tank your dps on a ret (not having hit cap, etc). A boomkin will out dps a ret paladin for probably the first minute of the fight, maybe two until the boomkin runs oom and then starts having to pot or melee to get mana or whatever else they are doing. This will cause boomkins to fall off in longer fights, and not do really enough to be competitive in mid-range fights. Feral with power-shifting and certain items can do decent dps, ive had a feral druid very consistently behind rogue/fwars. He never passed them, but he was right behind them. The biggest problem with feral is they dont get good itemization, especially later in the expansions. They get some help in aq40/naxx but nothing like other dps get. Warriors in naxx gear start doing oogle stupid damage but feral wont keep up.  
---
Tank specs for paladin/druid, they are both very very viable in 5mans, paladin tank is sooo good at aoe pulling, and if they have a mage they can be very quick to repull larger packs than a warrior could handle. Druid is similar but they take very little damage (from absurd armor values) from packs/bosses in 5mans. These do not translate very well when it comes to boss tanking, since no taunt/defensive stance/potions/shield wall/berserker rage. things that just make warrior the best endgame boss tanking class.  
---
Now what else do these classes bring, because this is very very important. A shit paladin/druid in a shit spec will still always bring VERY useful utility to a raid. Paladins bring an aura (60fr? OP) and a blessing. (Unless you have more than 5 paladins then you might run out of blessings) Lay of hands (a full heal essentially), Divine Intervention (as useful as a soul stone), Blessing of Protection (get out of a jail free card for a dps), judgements (Judgement of light and wisdom can be very very useful.) Tons of really good things paladin brings. Now lets look at druids. Combat res, so useful if you are in a progressing raid, newer guild, anything that might have a random person die. Can also be used like DI on a dead rezzer so that they can take it after the combat and rez everyone if there is no SS. Innervate, this spell is fucking bonkers good. The problem with boomkins/ferals is sometimes they will be greedy and keep it for themselves for casting/power shifting. If they are good and give up the innervate to a healer it can be an insanely good tool for a raid. Boomkins give 3% spell crit to their group. This can be decently good, like 4 holy paladins getting shitloads of mana back because of the bonus spell crit. Or warlocks/mages just unloading into the boss. Its not amazing, its not terrible, same thing for leader of the pack.  
---
So in the end, Paladin can tank/dps/heal endgame content fairly well. (They are amazing healers which is why everyone pigeonholes them into that role). Druids can tank/dps/heal endgame, (they are not amazing any of these roles actually... they are similar to paladin tanks, maybe a tad better, weaker dps than most dps class, and their healer is weaker than paladin/priest so they are typically seen as secondary healers or filler spots). Shamans can dps/heal (their dps isn't that great in pve, similar to boomkins where they go oom to quickly, but i've heard they are okay healers).  
---
They can all pretty much do every role leveling by when it comes to end game they are lackluster in any aspect when compared to other classes. (except paladin, which is considered one of the best healers) The most versatile class in terms of end game content for top-end players is warrior. It is the only class with 3 beautifully viable specs for every (pvp/pvetank/pvedps) aspect of the game (except healing).  
---
If you want to get into pvp the skinny for that is, ele shaman make you go boom, tank shammy is shit but them enhance 2h windfury 1shots, rshammy is annoying af to kill. ret pally will fuck your backline up and be really annoying with blessings/bubble, protpally will reck bomb the shit out of someone on your team and thats gg for them, holypaladin will be the most annoying as noone will die unless you focus them but then they bubble and top everyone off anyways.... Druid boomkin will just triple crit someone and then drink, feral will be an unkillable flag carrier best in game, rdruid will be very annoying as they can shift into bear and be tough to kill while still keeping everyone around them alive. All three of these classes all of their specs are fun in pvp and very very useful. But having so many fucking abilities makes them very hard to manage and know what is optimal in any given situation.  
---
Now im sure this way longer than you expected.... It took me over an hour to write it lol.
---
I associate the smell of food cooking at a taqueria near my house to raid nights. I would always seem to get a burrito on those nights... for the sustained energy of course lol.
---
I remember feeling so happy when I let that little sucker out of the cage. It was probably the first quest that I ever felt that emotionally. I HAD to complete the chain. I think I was probably 13 years old, long time ago...
---
If I remember correctly there's also a little cinematic? 
---
If you look up the item, even in 1.12 it still says "by up to". 
---
Changes! (Change it back to previous patch.)
---
Silverlight dawg, you pk? me neither haha
---
I mean, it's an imagery thing right. D&amp;D or LotR give us associations with some of the races.
---
I would say there are no "good guys" but in my experience Horde players often have the same view regarding their faction as "right".
---
Mage is the one class I would recommend the least. You'd have a delay on every cast and mage in PVP relies on timing and quick reaction. If you take a full second to blink/nova that warrior that got in your face, you can lose half your health. Also you're going to have a bad time against casters like warlocks/spriests.
---
Rogue would be a complete pain to PVP with because of the lag. You'd have to overlap your stuns to make sure your target doesn't end up with an opportunity window between CS/KS.
---
Warrior wouldn't be too bad in terms of how affected they are by the ping, but it might be an issue if you have to react quickly and taunt if you need to offtank something in raids. PVP is less about quick timing like Mage/Rogue and more about decision making and not overextending.
---
Hunter is the least affected by ping IMO. Your pet at lower levels can almost solo other players and deadzone isn't that big of an issue when you have trinket, scatter and FD--&gt;trap to get out of most situations. Deadzone isn't that big of a deal as long as you can get a feign/trap done. It shouldn't be too hard even with high ping, unless your enemy is spam clicking your corpse to keep you in combat.
---
&gt; Another benefit is the tier sets seem to do well for pve hunters as well as pvp?
---
Yep. Full T1 then T2 is BIS for PVE and BIS for PVP unless you get R12/13 gear. Big difference compared to other classes who would only use their (full) tier gear in PVP like mages/warlock.
---
&gt; And the specs for raiding and pvp can be similar?
---
You can PVP just fine with the standard 20/31/0 PVE spec, although going Deep MM with points in Surv will be better for PVP.
---

Whats wrong with org? Standing on top of the bank and dueling out front is what I'm looking forward to... I like the dusty grunge hole.
---
AV was one of my favorite things to do in game, so I was devastated when it was changed. Very much looking forward to this.
---
I won’t be following joanas guide exactly. Just using the outline of efficiency. And no I do not think I’ll be able to match a hunters played time on a warrior at all! Hell no! I don’t think I ever claimed I would either but if I did that’s not what I meant. Also to your first point I’ve leveled about 4 warriors so I understand fully how they work and how long it takes. I’m basically saying I’m trying to get to 60 within a week or as close as possible. I should maybe edit that post because I’ve had to explain this a few times
---
Or my favorite: half of each team turtles for about 20 mins while the other half take out towers and cap bases. Then defense is largely abandoned as the true PvE race begins.
---
ye, i love osrs and WoW equally, just really different games. osrs almost reminds me of stardew valley at times lol
---
Man, I plan on playing horde, starting a &lt;Asmondead&gt; or &lt;Asmonganked&gt; just sounds great....
---
Distract was super fun to use and I feel like people sometimes didn't even know what you did. I remember in one BG I believe it was AV I saw a guy auto running out from his base on a long stretch, I just had him do a 180 and watched as he ran all the way back into a wall. Could also do it when people were near edges and hope they'd fall off.
---
&gt; If people tipped well in the first place, then the crafter wouldn't feel the need to do this right?
---
It might be a cultural thing. I am from Australia and I find the whole tipping culture weird and frankly bullshit. If most people tip 5g for a thing, I will just charge 5g for the thing. It saves so much time and effort, and it means I don't have to deal with the "oh dear I spent my last copper buying the mats I am so poor QQ" people.
---
I found when I charged fair fees most people were fine with it and a few people even tipped extra.
---
&gt; I'm being petty/stubborn because this isn't how it was back on retail vanilla on my server. Maybe that community had healthier tipping habits?
---
What is healthy about it?
---
&gt; Since you wanna jump to conclusions and make it cultural, how come this wasn't the case on my US server back in retail but it was highly prevalent on private servers when I finally played alongside EU?
---
Beats me, I do not claim to be an expert on pirate server culture.
---
&gt; You say I see crafters as "beneath me" which is purely conjecture, yet your comments indicate that you see people from the USA as power hungry and corrupt....
---
You said that, not me. But if the shoe fits, wear it. I said *some* people get off on the power of deciding what to tip, and get massively butthurt by crafters daring to set a price.
---
I do not understand any other possible reason why a person could be so massively butthurt by a person charging them a fair price for a service which is *less* than they were willing to pay as a tip. They are offering to do it for you, for less than you planned to pay, but this enrages you to such an extreme that you are willing to waste as much time and money as it takes to find someone else and pay them more? That's weird, dude. Seriously.
---
Ah, you right. All the streamers I'd love to gank the shit out of ate going to roll PvE for sure. They know.
---
Are you ok
---
If you're comparing yourself to hardcore levelers or super experience people then yeah. I'm gonna go ahead and venture that the average person that will be playing Classic will take longer than that, though.
---
Hell, I've played a private server or two and know the leveling pretty well and I'm gonna take my time anyway and do a lot of the quests and zones that I don't usually do even though I know it will take longer as I know quite a few other people will be doing as well.
---
I remember that the AVs on privat wasn't super rushed. It was a lot of zerging in the middle while a few persons farmed..
---
Most AVs took around 1,5-2 hrs to finish.
---
No its the casuals majority complaining
---
not when the shitters will be turtling you at choke points
---
I vaguely remember but back then when you enter a new zone wasn't the name of the zone in a shade of colour specific to it's territory that would pop up in the middle of the screen ? example - a horde entering elywnn, it would come up as red, not that white colour, orange for contested territories etc
---
I can see you trying to keep up the same lifestyle and going hardcore - which will lead you to try to bot to keep up.  Then you will be banned and then quit classic
---
You don’t know what no changes means. You’re right that it is easiest for them because they actually have the data for 1.12 versus spending a large amount of time to replicate the 1.5 AV which would accomplish fuck all, because its not 2005 anymore and hardly anyone will consistantly do 40 hour AV’s.
---
Why do you trying they changed it in the first place lol?
---
1.0-1.5 AV, please. I can play 90% of a 1.12 on retail for over a decade now, I can't play 1.0-1.5 anywhere for over a decade.
---
BALLS OF STEEL
---
Esfand was a *streamer* on youtube. Just because he didn't stream on twitch doesn't mean he wasn't a streamer.
---
Yeah lets please the people who already have a retail version of AV with another retail version and screw over 1.0-1.5 AV lovers forever...
---
I think one of the first questions should also be which faction you want to be on. I don't really hate any race (except for gnomes) so i couldn't choose a side just because of a race. I like both paladin and shaman without a preference. It just came to the fact that I feel more at home with the Horde. Their general lore, cause I liked it more on WC3. I like the cities a lot more. I like their leaders. That's the first thing i chose when thinking about my main. Following that I decided a Tauren because it's the race I like the most in the Horde, and feel like I really need to like my mains race cause that's what I get to see all the time. And with all that taken into acount I finally ended up with druid. 
---
No, barely anyone likes AV. The problem though is that what people don't like about it (being a PVE rushfest) would not change even with the old settings. The long battles existed because of how ignorant most of the playerbase was.
---
The changes Blizzard has made to AV have *never* been enough. What we would actually need to make it fun are *custom changes* (omg triggered) with the goal of producing the old meta.
---
This would definitely require actual changes to the geometry of the map, probably changing its size, *definitely* fixing the garbage undefendable Horde base, and a huge de-emphasis of the victory bonus (probably also don't punish players for leaving midway - and also some kind of daily bonus that can be achieved even in a game you weren't there for the start of).
---
At the present time I don't think Blizz has the appetite for that so to me the best solution is to just leave it as a high honor/hour and rep/hour zergfest for now, let the crowd that just wants their reward be happy, and then revisit changes post-launch once a lot of people are exalted.
---
1.12 AV just makes me think they'll fuck up more of Vanilla.
---
I want the version of AV I haven't been able to play for  over a decade. Give 1.0-1.5 please.
---
Are we just gonna ignore the party chat? People saying Thank you and bye...where has that been!? 
---
I have no idea how I even played the game at all with that setup haha
---
So much wrong with this thought process, its getting tiresome responding to the anti “no changes” circle jerk. The idea behind it is to want Blizzard to deliver the game with only things from within the vanilla timeframe(1.1-1.12). The fact that things were changing during vanilla is irrelevant to an attempt at emulating the game from the 2004-2006 period. We don’t want then to update and fiddle with the game as if they were developers of the time trying to improve it, we liked how the game was and want that. They have said in so many different phrases that their intent is to deliver an authentic vanilla experience, and specifically will not tamper with the 1.12 data. No changes is the only sensible position and has been the bedrock for the movement for years. 
---
You haven't seen anyone saying that because it's kinda impossible to quit something you haven't even started yet :P
---
I agree with you -- deciding that you don't want to purchase a product or service because it's missing a feature is just normal consumer behavior. There's so much competition out there for our entertainment dollars that we can afford to be very picky. That's just the current reality companies have to operate in, and it's not the consumer's fault, nor is it their problem. 
---
No thanks, current Blizzard can't balance ANYTHING and ruins everything they touch.
---
Just don't change anything until after launch then. Once everyone is actually playing the game and has had their fill of 1.12 I'm sure discussions of "improvements" will happen, much like OSRS. Then you can have polls with 75% (or more) thresholds for changes, etc.
---
All of the classes sort of have their niches.  Here's my take.
---
 Rogues are a dime a dozen unless you're top tier King shit. As a raid leader I would often forgo rogues in favor of other DPS depending on what I already had. For example, if I have 5 rogues in mc, I definitely do not need another. They are typically "hard" for people to keep on dps for some reason. After about a billion rogues getting out dpsed by a tank, I don't think too fondly on them. Of course that's a reflection of the player not the class. But I'd always be skeptical of rogues because they are prone to being garbage. - that's not to say I haven't had great rogues either, but it's like for every 10 I'd recruit, only 2 would improve and perform well.  They are really bad for casual players.
---
  Mage, can keep DPS solid especially in MC fairly easy, only real problem is their Mana management or agro potential, both of those things are pretty easy fixes though... To some extent.  I love having a good mage with me through the whole level experience. 5 man's sheep is King CC, pvp they are pimps, not as good as lock but hey... 
---
Hunter is going to be a no no in my book, they are almost completely replaceable and you basically never needed more than a handful in the guild. Although for pvp maybe ineffective, they're fun haha. 
---
 Warrior is the easy best pick imho. They are easily the most sought after class in groups/raids and their DPS is second to none assuming the tank can keep agro. They wreck most classes in pvp with few exception - although those exceptions completely dominate them. 
---
In my opinion, warrior and rogues are the more tedious classes to level, mages are pretty easy, hunters are very easy.  But that is not all that important to me. 
---
It's not even out yet and you neck beards are already working up a sweat. How about you try it out first when the time comes, then speak your mind. God damn fucking ungrateful assholes. Just be happy we're getting this game back, what the fuck are you all contributing but criticism? Shut your cake holes. 
---
Pre dire maul yes
---
All you nerds would be complaining it's too long in no time. People just like to say shit, don't fucking play then it's totally fine with me and others that don't give a rats ass what AV they use. This meme is amazing btw
---
t-they know monkaS
---
That comeback was weaker than your chin. Try again. 
---
"depraved people craving video game updates" This isn't as good a defense of mostly mid 20+ adults aa you think it is, even if you use the correct term "deprived." It's a vidya, nothing more.
---
My first epic was a BOE as well! I won Felstriker with a roll of 4 against another Rogue during an UBRS run, and I had that weapon for quite some time.
---
I've got a loose schedule for exercise, play and food. 
---
I won't play hardcore (as in min/max, leveling guides, no dungeons, no fishing) but I will play a lot.
---
If it ever feels like a slog, I have plenty of around-the-house things in the backlog... Or I could work on one of the alts.
---
why didn't you put 1.6, 1.8, 1.10 and 1.11 in? This makes people who don't want 1.5 or 1.12 either unable to vote, vote for something they don't really want or voting on 1.5 just because its the "other" option. That makes this poll's answers pretty misleading.
---
I like your style, man. How do I add you?
---
We got 3 now! 
---
10 days to 60 was the average for Nostalrius IIRC, my played time goes up heaps from AFKing whether its a rez sickness or life-stuff..
---
My playtime to 60 will be a minimum of 12 days.
---
I’d have to say that 1.12 AV was by far the worst change in Vanilla WoW by a couples orders of magnitudes. I’d rather the whole game be 1.6 or something than have 1.12 AV. 
---
AV was a memorable experience early on. 1.12 was the same shit fest we have today. 
---
I was being hyperbolic, hence depraved but, don't think any of it needs defending since that's my whole point, no one really gives much of a shit about this AV change except a few vocal individuals
---
I may be a nerd but me and tunein are going to be R14 before your normie asses :P
---
&gt; is the lack of precise release date a sign it's not close or what? 
---
Depends on you definition of "close".

If we take that data as a basis, we're at least 2 months away from the release. If the two most recent expansions are any indication, the release could still be more than 4 months away. But until we get a date, that's just speculation.
---
\---
---
Regarding the more regular announcements: They're finalizing the design decisions for classic. They'll likely want to get the word out on the more pressing matters, before we get to the testing phase (PTR / beta / stress test).
---
3rd? Link?
---
It is just somehow different, right? The first guild I joined also ended up being the guild I raided with, and I was just semi-randomly invited at around level 27 because I dueled a guild member and they thought I was skilled. I didn't even know raiding was a thing at that point.
---
Obviously it's just one of those things that can't happen twice, but specifically searching out a social guild feels less... good, idk. It's just how it is now, 14 years later.
---
and thanks for reading! :)
---
That kinda depends on your raid group man. I've been in guilds progressing that would soak as much gold as I had into repairs, pots/flasks, enchants etc.
---
 I've also been in top tier guilds that literally paid my server transfer, paid for my naxx attunement, and supplied all my mats for enchants and pots. Literally wouldn't even take tips from me - just expected me to return the favor as guildies needed it.  One guild would summon their alt to the instance door and would log that toon for enchants and pots when needed. It was really really awesome to get a new main hand and have mats and an enchanter right there waiting for you. 
---
 Realistically, most decent guilds will not cost you tooooooo much in terms of raid expenses, unless they're underperformers. In which case, don't buy pots and stuff because likely nobody else is. Just LF another guild.
---
Depends on the world economy and what raid.
---
You can expect to drop up to 100g for a progression raid.
---
For a farm raid, you can expect to make 10-40g profit.
---
Your commitment to the Horde dies with such traitorous thoughts. Come back before your stray too far. Zug Zug brother
---
why is this useful?
---
An art*
---
Bro you gave me a contact stroke from this
---
Sure are a lot of us round here...
---
It all depends on the servers economy.
---
But, if your guild is competitive you're probably looking at 1-2 flasks per raid + various resistance potions + other less expensive consumables + repair bills + possible respecc costs.
---
I've seen flasks go for anywhere from 40g - 150g, resistance pots for 4g - 30g... it'll all depend on your server economy.
---
The only viable reason to make changes to Classic is if Blizzard said they're going to release a few realms that go all the way to Wrath.
---
Outside of that I fully agree that they should stick to what was originally planned, which is no further than 1.12. The moment they deviate from that mindset we open pandora's box and we'll know longer be sure of what will and wont be changed.
---
Kind of misread what he said. He said 9 days. But in the last 19 days we have gotten 3.  I have listed them below

It's **really** hard to comment on this just yet.
---
It's safe to assume you will need to bring *some* consumables. Like, at least wizard oil on your weapon.
---
But flasks might be extremely expensive in Classic. So expensive that it's untenable for guilds to require them.
---
Flasks require black lotus -- and they were ultra rare on 1.12. [Black Lotus] was on a 1 hour respawn. I believe there were only 4 zones that Black Lotus could spawn in, too. So you're talking about a *very* scarce herb. 
---
If Bliz doesn't up the spawn rate (And I'd reckon they won't), I don't think you'll be required to flask up for raids. 
---
And warlocks don't really need mana pots (demonic runes can be dope to use instead for a double-life-tap, but they're BoP anyway).
---
Lol 3 mil yes they would fucking close the project
---

I really hope Blizzard follows Jagex's lead with regard to conservative, community driven changes.

So sharding for the first 30 minutes, then for the next several hours, struggle to get anything done?

I'm curious, from when does your epic day-long battles memories come from ? Vanilla or private server ? Because when i played on nostalrius there was absolutely nothing epic about those battles. No one did AVs except for when AV was the BG of the week because of those day long BGs. What would happen is that we would call the orcs on wolves (orc side), everyone would try to win the bg from there and if we wiped, well fuck because half the people would leave. From the 20 left, half of them would afk in hope to be there when the bg ends and the 10 others left would just camp/defend with almost absolutely nothing happening for days ... How is that epic ?

---
Vanilla.
---
In Sweden it gets dark way before the equinox and nobody here defines autumn starting 23rd september
---
I lvled warrior as prot through most of my very first 60 journey in vanilla wow.  Only roll warrior if you intend to raid honestly.  You will end up spending most of your time doing content at nearly double the time it takes for other classes.  When you get to 60 you still suffer from being kited by nearly half the classes, and partner this with warrior being the most gear dependent class it means that if you arn't in raid gear you probably will die to someone in blue gear.  There are going to be so many warriors in classic, and they will be very sad.
---
Props, both sides to this meme have merit to their argument. While there are theoretically some improvements, many people enjoyed classic as it was &amp; don't think marginal improvement is worth risking the good that's there.
---
At the end of the day, some people will enjoy it &amp; others will long for the path untaken.

Your high latency will be a huge issue. Friend played on OLD DSL around 180ping.

Hunter worked best. Melee was unplayable. Casters and hunter at least land hits at that latency even if you miss some cooldowns but sticking to a target in melee you miss a lot of hits that should land.
---

what is LC?
---
&gt;and then sell the account for \~50-300$
---
That seems like a horrible use of time, the 1-60 world record is 4 days and 20 hours, you could probably make more money wandering the streets and picking up pennies. 
---
Lock is far more useful with crap gear.
---
Depending on how expensive it is to get the mats for leveling engineering and then crafting the consumables, wouldn't mining be better to be taken from the start with skinning?
---
This was my very first epic while grouping as a hunter with a rogue killing the raptors behind gurubashi. I ninja'd it. I was 12 and I actually feel bad now lol.

I remember I got this drop farming. I put it in the AH and a guy messaged me and begged for it for like 100 gold less. My dad was trying to get me to keep it in the AH but that gold sounded so sweet. I was awful with money in games. Good thing it didn't transfer to real life.

Accurate.
---
There's no need to optimize yourself from level 1. This is a game, so I hope you get to enjoy it! That said, many people enjoy doing their best. When you're leveling there's no pressure, so feel free to feel things out, but there's many areas to look into:
---
Gameplay: Getting good at hotkeys, movement, a sense of your cooldowns &amp; timers, and sense of the mobs around you
---
Leveling: Following a guide for a more optimal route, using the hearthstone well, maybe some tips on good gear to pick up along the way (most notably wands), etc
---
Warlock specific: Understanding good talent routes, proper dot choice/management, knowing what spells to get/avoid, when it's worth skipping class quests, recognizing what mobs might be resistant to certain spells, knowing when fear is helpful/harmful, etc
---
For macros, I don't have any on-hand - there is one nice warlock macro for discarding surplus soul shards, but I don't have any macros off-hand. When classic releases it'll be a different format than how vanilla was, so don't bother getting those fancy 1.12 scripts.
---
For addons, the different format means we aren't really sure what's going to work or how long before addons flourish.
---
I guess I didn't really answer anything, but there's more helpful people out there. Hopefully I gave you some more specific questions to ask
---
This could be quite a big deal depending on whether or not they do go with this system. If the items that were already in but updated in 1.10 start in their post update state with only the new items removed we'll see a very different path to pre-raid BiS as compared to retail/private servers. Some of the updated versions are incredibly good. Here are some examples.
---
There are obviously big changes like Gladiator's Chain https://itemization.info/item/11726
---
There are much lesser known ones like Demonshear off Balnazzar, which in its updated state becomes a rock solid engame PvP weapon for warriors, as good as Arcanite Reaper or IBS.
---
-Demonshear https://itemization.info/item/13348
---
Others have quite an large impact on BiS such as
---
-Brigam Girdle https://itemization.info/item/13142
---
-Skul's Cold Embrace https://itemization.info/item/13394
---
-Deathbone Legs https://itemization.info/item/14623
---
and the epics off rivendare and drakkisath which were nasty till their speed was updated
---
-Blacklade of Shahram https://itemization.info/item/12592
---
Conversely, there are items that I didn't realise were updated so late, such as Gyth's skull with apparently was hot garbo until 1.10 despite it featuring as BiS in every pserver I've ever played. I don't think many people were aware of this one.
---
-Gyth's Skull https://itemization.info/item/12952 (I think this is correct, because it wasn't around to be affected by the universal reduction of +def in patch 1.7 all other items like golem skull helm were)
---
When you think it’s going to be some easy karma... Oof. 
---
If PvP is your true vanilla passion. Your calling, then you ought to choose a good PvP race aswell because the racials make a big difference there aswell, but more on a personal level. Gnome escape artist for example, or Tauren warstomp, or Orc hardiness, or UD wotf.
---
Retail AV. Technically there isn't a time limit and reinforcement limit, but they never get hit on retail anyway.
---
No, that's 1.5
---
Hunter and possibly mage can pvp pve without respec
---
Initially hunter may be as popular as rogues cuz they will be first characters as farmers then people make the real main
---
For raid invites while there may be more rogues there are also about double the raid slots 
---
I've tried retail AV already, and time limits and reinforcements have never mattered there. What's the meaningful difference between that and 1.12 AV?
---
OTOH, I have never played original AV, and I have wanted to for years.
---
No changes means don't add anything that wasn't in vanilla. You might be surprised to hear this, but WoW patch 1.5 was actually in vanilla.
---
Dude. This is fricking amazing. I was gonna say like don't sweat it lol, I'm working on my own thesis currently anyways. This is seriously awesome man, thanks so much. 
---
No changes was always about only considering things that existed within the time frame of vanilla wow. (ie. no sharding, no loot trading, no flying mounts, no wow token)
---
It's not inconsistent to be for "no changes" and be against 1.12 AV in favor of an earlier version.
---
having to walk to dungeons :( 
---
just kidding. I didn't play vanilla but i heard there was no available quests "!" on the mini map so i'd have to choose that
---
As one who played AV from release, i dont think you are right here. Not every decision blizzard made was for the better, i mean, theres a reason people want the vanilla wow back again. All their "quality of life" improvements is also what drove wow to what it is today.
---
The old AV was long yes, you could leave one in the evening and the next day you could rejoin that same bg. It was frustrating, it was fun and you actually felt like it was a battle and not just a BG where people pass eachother to do some objective.
---
Reinforcements was a cool idea and it made the battleground more exciting. And you could spawn big bosses to help you in the battle. In the field of strife you had to stand there 10 man and channel a summon while others had to defend you. That was amazing.
---
Just because blizzard changes things, doesnt mean that its for the better.
---
AV used to go on for days. You could login in the morning and still be in the same AV at night.
---
During vanilla? People say this is impossible to do because private servers jack up the rep gains.
---
How are Blizzard supposed to pick and choose particular elements of every patch and expect no one to get upset? They simply can't win here. I don't really fault them for sticking with the plan of consistency in the patch.
---
Yeah but as a warr dont u need the epic crafted gear to get guild invites? I feel like you gotta be super tryhard and some of the pre raid bis cost maybe even more than epic mount
---
Speaking of money how do warrs farm gold? Their raiding is very expensive. And iirc you cant pvp with those fury specs and no decent guild brings an arms war.
---
There were Russian dominated realms like Warsong in vanilla and they most definitely were competing with other servers.
---
Literally "You think you do, but you don't"
---
At least 1.12 AV is an actual contest in who can coordinate better. The original AV was just a contest in who had most people online around the clock. 
---
Here's the trick if your AV turns into instant rushfest: send your mages and hunters to defend at stonehearth bunker or iceblood tower. This forces the other faction to do the same or lose every single game. From there the games will be a lot less rush.   
---
But I guess that would require coordination.
---
are u some sort of content god that deems whether something is actual content? amount of effort into a video doesnt automatically make a video good or bad. i personally just like esfand's personality. id rather watch him talk into a webcam with 1 take rambling about whatever comes to his mind, than someone who spends hours making precise editing and condenses the information to the absolute minimum. thats just my personal preference, its not right or wrong or anything. clearly many others share the same viewpoint, or he would simply get no viewers. im honestly sick of seeing these 'content police' posts. if u dont like it, dont watch it.
---
It's okay, OP. I'm a little salty we aren't getting 1.5 AV, too.
---
How's classic's sound design? Have they actually added deep bass to spell sounds?
---
&gt; Well to be fair, theres a proxy discussion going on about AV 1.12 on the Private Server subreddit, and they cannot come to a consensus either.
---
Turns out, designing game systems is hard and communities rarely have the endurance and collective intelligence to succeed in it.
---
**Who knew?**
---
So old AV was a microcosm of vanilla WoW? How can anyone be against that???
---
Quick google search gives me 1.8, I started in I think November or December of 2005. I must be old cause I can't remember AV being any different until much later.
---
If you have any questions about any line of what I wrote, I can go into more detail/give examples. Everything I stated I have more to say about. This is like awkwardly shorthand for every single thing I could write on this topic... But I am someone whose been reading these subreddits for 3 years, and read virtually every piece of every guide released about classic... lol
---
Are you implying it isn't?
---
LF an Australian-based US (Region) guild.. i’ll be playing Mage and a Warlock or Warrior alt. Plan on PvPing to at least R10 and raiding heavily when the game comes out.
---
I’m free constantly and plan on sinking time into this game.
---
The weird thing about raiding is that it is actually cheaper to pop all the elixirs and pop potions without hesitation and to clear the content in a timely fashion than it is to bumble around for a few hours constantly wiping.
---
Downvote and move on guys.
---
I see you fell for it. 
---
If you ask someone about "old alterac valley" the answer they give you 100% won't be about what was there in 1.12
---
This sounds cool, do you have a video of it?
---
I dont get what you mean with double the time. Is it cuz of how big the loot competition is?
---
Tell him streamers are going to play.
---
Okay, there were different iterations of AV where it was an epic long battle, but 1.12 is very very very much not one of them
---
Warlock
---
If you wanted bgs it would have been shaman
---
Yet Blizz never said we're getting 1.5...they have steadfastly said since the beginning we are getting 1.12. 
---
I would love old AV but I have never held out hope that Blizz would patchwork Classic with different versions of Classic. "Oh this feature will 1.4, this zone will be 1.2, AV will be 1.5, this raid will be pre-nerf."
---
It's all the sanctimonious fake anger I have a problem with. How can you be shocked and dismayed that Classic 1.12 will be in a 1.12 state?
---
Exactly. I don't expect to race with friends when they have tuned cars and I'm in a stock civic. Sure I'm.a damn good driver in this analogy but even the slightest mistake and it's over. I have a small margin for error. Now tether us together as a team and I'm holding us back. 
---
It's not personal. I can go race with other people or get bored and move on.
---
If this is a live retail character check the value on some of those items. If they don't exist in the game anymore you could sell for lot's of gold to fund game time subscription used for when classic comes out!
---
Yeah, I’m definitely hoping the streamers will hook onto the game and give it a more “flourishing” appearance. No one wants to get into a game people think is irrelevant. 
---
They have literally never said we were getting 1.12. They said they would be using 1.12 as a framework. If they were giving us just 1.12, we'd have had it months ago.
---
I'm angry because one of the first things I got excited for when they announced classic was old AV, and now they're telling us we aren't getting that.
---
I checked my retail account when they had a free weekend
---
I got really upset when I noticed barely 5 people in Org around the bank and AH areas. Quit quickly after that.

The reward for playing a hybrid is that if they ever make it into T3 they are pretty OP.
---
We had a druid in full bis naxx. He could solo tank MC in resto spec. He was unkillable. In PvP it was hilarious.
---
They have CLEARLY stated they are not doing any cross-realm BG's...
---
No you don't need epic gear, just crushing capped really for the most part.  Back in the day, pretty much you take any warrior into the guild that wants to tank and has even moderately intentions to gear up. Unless your guild is pretty solid or really warrior heavy. You can get crush capped from 5mans (and 10/15s depending on ud/Ubers) fairly easy.  Typically servers were starved for tanks. 
---
That being said, warrior gold farming isn't optimal probably versus other classes, but you can always just accept a bit of gold to tank instances... If some zf group has been waiting an hour for a tank that isn't online... They will pay you haha. 
---
Raid kiting didn't really happen pre bc from what I remember... Just trank shot.
---
Addons will do it so no biggie.
---
I am disappoint. 
---
Warriors dont get easy spots in raids especially tanks cuz few are needed
---
You think you do but you dont
---
- someone who doesn't know the difference between using a patch as the game and using it as a framework
---
It removes some psychological incentive to have those epic battles when NPCs are nerfed/removed. We can still have those battles in 1.12, but with less game design wedge towards it, it will probably be less likely. To me 1.12 is fine if it turns out people actually fight the battle instead of rushing, which we will have to wait and see. I will play regardless, and feel there is no need to complain about something that isn't even sure it is going to happen!
---
I'm just sick of seeing it. I'm still down with no changes, but having a single profession being totally essential for PvP is just silly.
---
I think people are forgetting the margin for error on new raid content is nothing. Maximizing your raids chance of success is important. One person slacking or taking a bad death can be a wipe. 
---
These elitist threads are hilarious. In wotlk we had a decent percent of casuals who were useless but it didn't matter until Lich King. Then our casual group imploded and we rocked a 10man forever after.

Dwarf is better

TL;DR bitching about a BG that you wont even have access to before your vacation you are clearly wanting to take off is over isnt a good reason... Also its not anything like the retail one, and if you think it is go play fucking retail and realize you are blatantly wrong...  
---
First off, are you shitting me? 3 weeks vacation time? If you spend 8 hours a day for 3 weeks you only hit 7 days played time. Which is below the average played time for level 60. But lets just say you are going to relive your vanilla fantasy and enjoy the grind and enjoy the exploring the world etc etc. You arent going to be 51 to go into AV before your vacation time is even up...
---
Now you are back at work after your 3 weeks you finally hit 51 and you hop into AV, but lets just say they have pre 1.8 version, you play for 3-4 hours and your team accomplishes virtually nothing while you guys aoe and get aoed down. You spent the entire time after you got home from work, to get nothing, maybe a handful of AV rep, but you enjoyed getting two shotted by a level 60 rogue over and over again for hours. Now lets say its 1.12, if either side turtle you will have the SAME exact massive aoe v aoe fest and you will get the same experience... Except maybe you actually finish an AV or two godforbid... And get some marks and extra honor.

Hi [r/classicwow](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow)!
---
I'm interested in joining a group/guild of people who are looking to enjoy classic as much as I do. Not only at the destination of hitting end-game, but as well as the journey of the leveling grind. I started wow the last two weeks of vanilla and TBC was the expansion I spent the most most time on and I feel being part of a community and having main group of friends was the main reason. Since wotlk, I haven't ever really felt the same feeling in wow. I feel classic is the perfect opportunity for this.
---
I will be rolling on Alliance PvP(/RP-PvP) for certain. I would be flexible in my class choice between a Warrior, Mage, Priest, Rogue (preference in that order). I haven't really been in any sort of even "semi" hardcore raiding environment since tbc, but I feel like with recent changes in my life I'll have the time to finally return to that type of commitment and look forward to playing my part in a team. Ultimately in classic, my goal is to both enjoy everything the game has to offer while trying to be the best player I can be.
---
My available raid times would be any day of the week (Mon-Sun) 9 pm - 1 am CST OR (Sun-Tue) Anytime of the day.
---
Thanks for reading. hmu on discord skarvon#0773

You were lied to son!
---
&gt; and that's un-attractive
---
fuck that noise, have fun
---
What's Warfront? 
---
&gt;Reinforcements was a cool idea and it made the battleground more exciting. And you could spawn big bosses to help you in the battle. In the field of strife you had to stand there 10 man and channel a summon while others had to defend you. That was amazing.
---
This is what I mean. You and so many others are mixing up two completely different things. "Reinforcements" as in summonable bosses/wolf riders/wing commanders etc. are still in the 1.11 version. Reinforcements as in the victory condition mechanic introduced in patch 2.3 does not.
---
&gt; You want to allocate enough time for that, but also leave room for other activites, because you are an adult with responsibilities.
---
In this case you should put aside dungeoning, or join a guild where everyone knows what to do, instead of pugging.
---
Most people have no idea what they want because they don't have any knowledge of what changed in which patches of vanilla. These are the people that believe that spamming #nochanges means they'll get exactly what they get from &lt;insert name of private server here&gt;.
---
Most players are low skill casual tho. Its not like you gonna play in pro tournament servers.
---
That was wall jumping, not wall walking.
---
quick reminder that everyone should try to unionize their workplace
---
Yeah, this, also people bitching that they aren't doing older versions clearly dont understand it isnt about the ability to create it... They can create whatever shitty patch they want, you know how I know? They did it 15 years ago, on a razor toaster...  
---
They chose 1.12 AV, its a CHOICE they made. Like you could give any version of AV and this reddit would flood with hate post about how its the worst possible choice and "I am so disappointed in blizzard and their laziness"
---
omg i think i know what youi mean...
---
I meant for dps
---
Disappointed in hearing this. I wanted the old av will all the strong npcs it truly felt like you were in a Warcraft 3 game
---
its just as bad as announcing an upcoming announcment..
---
Save gold during farm raids, you'll purge during progression.  More hard core guilds will require more consumables but on average will get to a farm state much faster than more casual guilds.  
---
Can't give you an exact amount of gold since that depends on how the economy shakes out, but I'd guess about an hour of farming for every hour of raiding will keep you positive over the long run. You could cut back, but if you want to get all the way through naxx it really really helps to build up a warchest early on. 
---
Sharding is absolutely a necessary evil. I wouldn't even want to imagine the hell a streamer would go through if sharding didn't ake place b/c it takes less than 5 people to utterly decimate the questing experience.
---
Other than that, I'd be fine with a handful of realms that progressed to end game Wrath, but nothing more.
---
* Deserter debuff for not accepting BG queues (punishes dodgers)
---
* World buffs removed when entering raids
---
* Slightly higher population servers
---
Maybe we interpreted differently. When they said they finally found the only surviving vanilla WoW version in some backup file, that it was 1.12. That's the only complete version they have. I took that meaning that's the version we would get. 
---
Well, maybe once Classic is up and running they will task a few developers into recreating AV 1.5.
---
Some people liked the macro aspect of the battleground, and contributing your little corner to a huge war, even though the micro aspect of the BG wasn't great. If you wanted to smash people in the face, you had WSG, AB and even world pvp.
---
Bust it is then. 3day AVs are now really antiquity. 
---
My strongest memories/most nostalgic moments in games are tied to fragrance. When I started one of my favorite MMOs I had purchased a new perfume (Givenchy Ange ou Demon Elixir) - and now I can't smell it without thinking about the \*experience\* of starting a new game, and that thing that can't be replaced or recaptured outside of those circumstances. You know - not knowing all of the systems, trying to figure out the UI/market, the awe/wonder of a new zone/lore/etc., everyone being on the same page for the most part - and the heightened sense of camaraderie that is absent in established titles. So now, whenever I start a new game, I wear a different fragrance.
---
Candles work too - although it sucks when they get discontinued. I started playing BDO when I had Bath &amp; Body Works Carribean Escape candle &amp; wall plug-ins going, so it achieved a similar impact/nostalgia hit, but It's not quite  as impactful as perfume/cologne (for me, anyway).
---
The vendor one with lots of armor
---
Myep you have to do that
---
Essential oils are nice, but the only downside is that good blends get rather expensive. The Thieves scent from Young Living is really good - but so overpriced. 
---
\&gt; Clove, Lemon, Cinnamon Bark, Eucalyptus Radiata, and Rosemary essential oils that fills any space with a rich, spicy aroma 
---
Brother Pluto, have you not heeded the ancient prophecies? 
---
In years gone by, Orcs and Humans fought at the Dark Portal. Escaping their dying homeworld, the mighty Horde pushed the Alliance scum back [across the great sea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZU-n8UZM5Cc) (but like... North Accross the Great Sea... Maybe the Thandol Span  bridge didn't exist at time or something, idk). Seeing their enemy flee before them only further spurred the bloodlust and we chased the humans north. There they defeated us. Enslaved us. Rounded us up and threw us into captivity. [They sealed off the dark portal.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8c8psj9RFM0) My brother, our arrogance was our undoing. 
---
Our allies, the Amani trolls abandoned us. The goblins sold us out. Without Gul'Dan's magic, the Ogers would not serve the Horde. My brother, it was Orc and Human alone once again. And so we fought. And we fought. And we fought. We fought, and we clung to the old hatreds.
---
[Until the day the sky rained fire.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72UbFQO5-m0) 
---
Do you know the story from there Brother Pluto? Now it was our turn to flee. To set sail to the forgotten lands of Kalimdor. Thank the elements that our beloved Warchief was able to do what few Orcs have done: he swallowed his pride. 
---
That was the lesson learned in the Third War. Did Grommash swallow his pride? No. And it was nearly our undoing. 
---
Do you know who it was that soothed the fire in Grom's blood, my friend? 
---
It was Jaina Proudmoore. A human. 
---
Many tales are told among the Horde, of Cairne and Thrall beating back the infernals and Felgaurds of the Burning Legion. Many more are told of our brave Warchief, and mighty Hellscream, [entering the canyon to defeat Manoroth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3kmcEa4rms), and save our people. 
---
How quickly we forget that it was Jaina, and her human allies who stood alongside Thrall and Cairne as the fire rained from the heavens. Who channeled her powers with Thrall to end Grom's bloodlust. 
---
What kind of woman was this? 
---
A proud warrior, who would stop at nothing for victory?
---
No. The proud humans were dead then. Dalaran had fallen. Lordaeron too. The humans that were left were not proud, they were survivors. Like us. 
---
How did the third war end, young Pluto? 
---
Did the Horde rise up and crush all who opposed us?
---
Did we vanquish the demons alone?
---
No. 
---
We stood shoulder to shoulder with Elf, Human, and Tauren, and together held fast [until Malfurian had set his trap.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66m8sQY4pNg)
---
What would the Warchief say to you now, brave Pluto, to hear that you would only see Alliance as enemy? Have you not learned the lessons that have been passed down to us in these bloodsoaked tomes? 
---
You are Horde, Pluto. You will always be Horde. But it is not wrong to see the world through Human eyes. Through Elf Eyes, or those of the Dwarf and Gnome. That was the lesson we learnt, [Four long years ago...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlVSJ0AvZe0) 
---
Follow your destiny my brother, whether it be Alliance or Horde now, you will always know where you came from.

Help a brother out here - which version is 2 day long AVs?
---
Well, I'm now thinking not Druid, and probably not Shaman. Any thoughts on the tradeoffs between Priest and Paladin?
---
Dude, are you comparing the virgin night elven uncommon beard with the chad dwarven legendary beard?
---
It's easy to find a guild, it's hard to find a fun, tight-knit guild that you can form memories with. The majority don't build those ties, and if you're lucky they have one or two small cliques that actually do things together. 
---
I think I've found maybe 3 that fit within that category in almost a decade. 
---
I'm an offtank for bwl mc ony and i don't use any consumables at all. The main tank isnt using anything too... You don't really need anything for these unless it's progression.
---
This is what being a cunt looks like.
---
Yea, had a friend that ran a HUGE vent server, 1000+ slots for this giant multigaming community they ran.
---
So one day me and another mutual friend invited a bunch of Brazilians or some such, I think we posted the server IP all over some free vent IP site or somesuch and like 100 Brazillians kept coming in and chatting and when he'd ban them, even more would come, they'd never stop.
---
&gt;brush your teeth
---
Me not that kind of orc!

Yeah, I can totally see why they made the choice, it's just not the correct choice for me as customer.  
---
You spend more than 5 times the time watching their videos than you do opening MMOC or the forums to find the post and read it and develop your own thoughts on it. it legit takes 2 minutes of information and makes it 10+.
---
&gt; Sharding is absolutely a necessary evil.
---
No.
---
Arise my champion 
---
Losing block is better than being crit on boss. A crit is 200% damage, a crush that you can push with block (but have to be critted to do that) is 150% damage.
---
Threat ? You only lose one auto attack if you have the recknoning talent.
---
If a paladin want to aoe tank then sure def isnt usefull, but if he want to attempt tanking a raid boss he better be def capped.
---
Priest dps is more of a joke than paladin, and brings less to the table. Priest healing is really good, just make sure you a good race if you want to minmax. (Don't go night elf unless you don't care then do whatever lol) priest explodes in pvp, but shadow can be deceptively beefy. Dispel makes them great on alliance since its our only purge.
---
In pve healing they are arguably both amazing and necessary. I wouldn't put one above the other. In pvp paladin is better but not by much, plate gear and a shield go a long way in pvp.
---
Both priest and paladin are super useful, paladin I'd say has more utility and priest has more raw healing prowess
---
Thx for telling me what LOL means. I've seen people use that for 18+ years and never understood what it means. Great comment man.
---
I loved AV, I loved summoning bosses and having huge fights in the center to protect it. As a hunter at the time I have almost 100k honour kills thanks mostly to AV. 
---
World of warcraft is much more action oriented, especially with vanilla wow's worldpvp, you almost always need to be on alert and you have to worry about your gear and possibly potions and whatnot as a failsafe for being more gank resistant, then again you can also group up but syncing quests at different levels is a little fucky so it has less co-operative capability, sure you could argue that you can play PVE realms but PVP realms offer both fully fledged PVP and fully fledged PVE, while PVE servers only offer battlegrounds PVP and fully fleged PVE.
---
With runescape, sure you have the wilderness but the majority of your fun is going to be spent in areas where other players can't kill you, but runescape really doubles down with the risk, if you die in the wilderness i believe all your shit is gone (please correct me though if i'm wrong, haven't played rs as much as wow and never really spent time in the wilderness) 
---
While i really do enjoy both mmo's greatly, they are very different games, and i could understand why a fan of runescape would not like world of warcraft and vise versa, and it's possible this may be the case with your friend, but i would encourage him to at least get to level 20 and to have played some dungeons and whatnot for him to have a good idea of what most of the core gameplay is like and if he actually does prefer the game or not.
---
Getting addicted to a video game is mostly primal, illogical and instinctual, it's not about how the game objectively is, rather it's about how that person enjoys that game, it's how it feels to them, not what it is, you could explain for hours on end on what superior features world of warcraft has objectively over runescape, but at the end of the day if playing runescape is more fun for him and wow is more boring for him at his core you'll never get him to like wow, i learned this through the fortnite phenomenon, while i do not enjoy it at all to any extent and no matter how many times i tried to play it and attempted to enjoy it, and why i objectively think there is not much to do in the game, and why i do not understand why the game has so much popularity, i learned that the amount of fun is ultimately down to the eye of the beholder, in other words personal preference.
---
A good way to try to understand this is like imagining you're a robot, and you have all the cognitive and physical capabilities as that of a normal human being, with one condition that you cannot experience the satisfaction of sex or masturbation, you'll see plenty of people doing it and talking about how amazing it is but it'll never be fun for you as an individual, so you will never understand the greatness of it.
---
Mostly premade coordinate to rush or you get lucky. But if it's gone 1-2 hours already then kt6probably won't be finished for a long time. And I'm talking 12 hrs plus
---
If I want to do dps I should be able to do so using a dps spec..
---
Reason why you don’t see warriors and rogues complaining they can’t heal is because they weren’t meant to do so in the first place...wtf kind of comparison is that?
---
Well the av is. Just an older version
---
There is a big difference between *"changes I wouldn't like"* and *"changes that would make me quit classic"*.
---
Sharding levels 1~20 is likely *not* a dealbreaker for me. But sharding the first ony head, or big world pvp, or the AQ event... That could be quit-worthy.
---
Population limits being increased is something I wouldn't quit over. As long as herb drops and respawns were put on nobs to make it "feel" right. (But, I'll be honest, I wouldn't mind queues either)
---
1.12 respec cost is something I could live with. 1.12 AV is something I could live with (although I prefer 1.10). 
---
If they did minor changes post-launch to fix """exploits""" (like ez DM farms, etc) -- I could live with that.
---
Yea man no problem! :) :) :)

It seems like you don’t understand if having specs, if there is a dps spec that means paladins are meant to do all 3 roles as the player would choose. 
---
Your logic would make sense if I were talking about a rogue where they are meant to do dps as they have all dps specs
---
Free mount and easy leveling makes it a great first character choice, especially when you're planning for long term. 
---
Option for modern graphics, similar to what exists with the „classic“ options button. For me personally the old models can remain in 2005 and I’ll choose the highest settings possible. But then again I don‘t care enough to complain. 
---
Free mount and easy leveling is my guess.

This AV announcement  perfectly showcases the community's hypocrisy. Classic is only Classic when they seem fit.
---
Hate to break it to you fam, but everything and anything up to 1.12 is Vanilla, and therefore it's Classic.

You know what isn't Classic?

---
Garr has 8 adds if I remember correctly. But they can be banished easy and a few can be tanked by whatever misc warriors you have laying around, the kite isn't really required but it can work.  
---
 Selling tanking isn't consistent gold but hey, it's something. Mining/skinning can do you well as gold income but that's if course not specific to warriors.
---
Has tips out done a video about this yet? 
---
That's the one I want :D
---
These super long AVs were only a thing in the early days. I don't remember super long AVs, especially when cross realm PvP was implemented. 
---
#nochanges
---
I like how many of you guys are like an echo chamber, constantly screaming “don’t try to bend the game to your wants”
---
If blizzard wanted paladins to just heal they wouldn’t give them tank and dps specs.
---
I don’t want them to change the game to my preference, it’s literally asking them to fix the damn dps spec..
---
Backstab in vanilla was working only from behind. Do you need anything else?
---
You planned your next 2 years?)

Mightiest of tendons.
---
if we want the av where people just rush to the end never do any of the objectives such as turning in armor ect. and have no real challenge in terms of pve we could of just played battle for azeroth. People wanted the long battles with the feeling of being a solider in Warcraft 3 in classic. I am definitely disappointed in this decision but I see why the did it. Private servers were doing a hybrid of the two diffrent versions
---
If Alliance rogue: Use distract on people moving along the narrow pathways in Thousand Needles. You can redirect them and force them to run off the ledges to their deaths.
---
Might do that on a pvp server, but this was PvE.
---
the one lost in the past where people didn't figure out how to rush it efficiently yet.
---
Yep... https://youtu.be/jwKCNtAxL8Y
---
Very true. It seems to be the Rolls Royce option for scenting it up. I have no idea if it's worth it or not; I have no experience with essential oils.
---
They already said that they only have 1.12 data. Then they piecemeal reveal that they "decided" to base Classic on 1.12. It's weird. Just say: "We were fortunate to discover this backup of a backup of 1.12 so we can create Classic. So Classic will be Vanilla 1.12. The end."
---
nah I never did that, always hotkeys.  That's just all I used at the time ;)
---
Tanking is hard I agree, but the only thing they have to do alone is pull and set the pace. Everything else you said can be done by anyone else in the group and probably should be done more often so tanking doesn't feel like a thankless job. This is the biggest reason we have so few tanks for 5 mans; they are expected to be shouldering almost all of the responsibilities when in reality the burden can be shared.
---
its sad honestly, the way the playerbase idea of the game has changed, i dont go to AV to grind honor or items or w/e, i go there to play PVP. what a novel concept, playing the game for the sake of the actual combat gameplay rather than just being strung along after the carrot on a stick reward system.
---
people minmax hard these days especially on private servers so there is no real going back, but unfortunately with this version of AV we really will see very few long AV battles.  even on private servers there was still quite a few long ass games you could get into, turtles and whatnot but yeah mostly everyone going for rush. the mines, the npcs, etc did make it alot harder, at least like 15-20 mins because you had to take out some towers because the commanders would absolutely reck you
---
Only on private servers that is
---
I don't think so.  It was a long time ago.  I know this is the first I remember saving and the earliest screenshot I have that survived all this time.
---
Is it? Never played Priest so wouldn't know. What mechanic in classic wouldn't allow that?
---
&gt; If your main concern is gold you're still better off going herbalism, but you can always switch professions along the line.
---
Agreed, but in the context of leveling. i prefer mining due to the bag space issues.
---
My planned progression is mining /skinning while leveling --&gt; mining engineering to build all the engineering goodies, then engineering / tailoring to build all the tailoring goodies / once everything is built i can settle with engineering / herbalist
---
i completely agree with you, unfortunately, many of these radcal blind classic fans want no changes no matter what.
---
Its ridiculous that they dont see how merely buffing the specs wouldnt cause a massive domino effect. They literally blow shit out of proportion. 
---
For example let me talk about ret paladins, if they buff them to the point where they are finally viable and can compete against the other dps, it wont do any harm at all. 
---
**i need to hear why the hell they think buffing the ret paladins will be harmful.**
---
Assume:
---
- Playstyle stays the same
---
- they will still be slightly weaker than other melees as "hybrid tax" to warriors, rogues, etc.
---
Im hoping that blizz will be reasonable and see the flaws that the mass try to ignore.
---
That is what I fear will end up being the case. I suppose ultimately it’ll just be a coin flip as to whether or not that innate illogical side grabs him and his interest. Time will tell. 
---
&gt;The rest are complaining that even when PServers implemented old AV, people still rushed the bosses anyway, LOL! 
---
I can attest to this. Whether AV was an infinite grind or a rush fest depended on the players who were in there. The thing that stops super long matches is the reinforcement system, which they left out. I mean, games sometimes ended up a grindfest even in tbc, and the game would end on reinforcements.
---
&gt; 5-man Loatheb was only possible after the 2.0 patch.
---
I wasnt talking about 5man loatheb. I was talking about using shadowpriests to keep the tank up in normal raid.
---
i need to hear why the hell you think buffing the ret paladins will be harmful.
---
    Playstyle stays the same
---
    they will still be slightly weaker than other melees as "hybrid tax" to warriors, rogues, etc.
---
If I had a dollar for every time someone said this regarding classic...
---
This.
---
ret paladins are a joke and rely on chance
---
awesome
---
A real OG 
---
are you saying that a con to that is that it will increase more competition for certain gear?
---
I hope i didnt understand that because right now that sounds obnoxiously stupid
---
Invite him to something, a dinner party idk. 
---
Honestly I like the older long version of AV, even a rush took 20+ minutes because of the towers, npcs, and what defence stayed behind  like rouges and druids to backcap, maybe some hunters an ranged to do as much damage to the first wave of enemy offence trapping and fearbombing them into mines.
---
blizzard should reconsider this imo,  just pure rush with no chance of long battle is off putting. one of the first fond memories everyone brings up about classic is always without fail oldschool long AV matches.
---
yeah there are always those people who play this game like its a damn second job (only job for many of them lol) who are only there for quick items and rep, these people will complain endlessly but i believe they are a vocal minority.
---
 Most people want old AV for the big battles with wave after wave smashing against eachother pushing back and forth between towers, stalemating, ninjaing and backcapping, gaurds who will absolutely fuck you up if your alone, archers on the walls and in the bunkers who will snipe you down, minefields that will 1 or 2 shot you if you weary off the path. the really epic siege. not just, who can bumrush van or drek the fastest 5-10 minute honor farm, thats fuckin LAME honestly
---
Im myself toying with the idea that ill use 2 accounts myself (in classic). Just to have mage(s) with portals (+food+drinks) and warlocks with summons on the 2nd one. Trying out multiboxing could be fun.
---
I would still need 1 extra person for summons, but im sure guildies will have L20 warlocks in key positions too.
---
Does it become less effective or does it have the same rate of EHP per point?
---
I think in LoL for example 100 armor was 50% reduction, in other words the enemy hitting you lost half of their damage so they went from 100 to 50.
---
if you took that character with 100 armor and added 100 armor, well the second 100 armor reduced the enemy hitting you by half again so it took the 100 damage, halved it to 50, then halved it to 25.
---
The second "set" of 100 armor only does 25% dmg reduction, but that's still 50% reduction.
---
I have no idea how armor works but I am curious about this.
---
thats is not what he and many of us are saying... 
---
let me put it plain and simple.
---
You see classes like mage, rogue, warlock? 
---
Those are meant to be played as dps no matter what.
---
Priests, paladins, druids, etc. give the player the option to play the role they want and it should be viable. Saying that a paladin is not meant to dps in a raid it going against blizzards whole design of a hybrid class.
---
&gt; But why kill when you can kite ;)
---
Its safer, faster, easier and ppl like buffing their dps numbers. That part of the fight is so fucking boring, that it gives at least something to do.
---
Dude
---
Find something productive to spend your time on
---
&gt; considering the DM run also takes around 25mins
---
90% of the DMT buffs you get you are leeching from cleared runs, making it more like 5 mins. You have 5 guildies go clear it and then 15 guys comes just to get buffs. Or you can even BUY a cleared ID and nobody needs to run it.
---
I didn't start with WotLK, I started with WCII. Then WC3, then WoW, then TBC and finally the culmination of it all, WoTLK.
---
Lore wise it's easily the best, and it's got some good gameplay too. 
---
The others are right though that dungeon finder killed WoW.
---
Yes yes and yes
---
&gt;  **even when PServers implemented old AV,** people still rushed the bosses anyway, LOL! 
---
well atleast if we have the earlier version its more likely to have at least SOME non rush AV's this would satisfy more people right? the "we want the marks/honor/rep" crowd gets their &lt;30min games most of the time, and the "we want a 6-12 hour siege battle" crowd still gets their fights now and then.
---
with the later version i would wager 95% will be rush with that 5% being the odd turtle.
---
Im on the long siege oldAV side myself, i want to see all aspects of the battleground utilized again, summons, npcs, mines, etc etc. if i can only play for an hour or two then i just leave the BG when im ready. sometimes its nice to spend a whole comfy day in AV tho and not see anything past the fields of strife.
---
rush 40 people to kill the boss in &lt;10min is not ideal for me, the pve boss rush is shorter than even a game of ab or wsg. AV is a huge battleground, the fight should be huge
---
Lower respec costs would be a change I’d like to see. I’ll accept 50g as that is what the cost originally was, but I won’t enjoy it
---
Preach 🙌
---
having to play as holy paladin and raids isnt playing the class, you cant even use prot before you start a raid because the raidleader finds another warrior to offtank.
---
Stop acting like vanilla is flawless, realize that there are some specs that need tweaking
---
We going to use 1.12. Then announces they will also use 1.12 for AV.... wow. This is outrageous, 
---
I dont see many ppl going to get another buff if they wipe (unless they suck and NEED it). Sure, you might want to refresh a buff after like a full AQ40 when going to clear BWL+MC afterwards if you have the extra heads.
---
Dunno, if you had asked me about the CD, i would have said 2 hours too. 
---
No biggie, as i almost always play a healer, i can get a buff 1-3 days before the actual raid, as im grinding/playing mostly on alts anyways. Just makes having extra mages and warlocks more important to move around the world faster.
---
If it is 6 hours, im sure ill play on 2 accounts, i can sit my main in capital and play on alts while fishing for the buffs.
---
Looks interesting and I'll probably try it.
---
But there's some bullshit in there too.
---
He lists the worst TPS and TPR warrior skills, doesn't mention the threat modifier from defensive stance or defiance, and concludes that shaman threat is king. 
---
i want the best vanilla, not the old vanilla where nothing was done to NEEDED changes.
---
19 minutes. Holy crap
---
200g+ per night of progression
---
is there a source saying that was the reason why they gave pallys to horde?
---
Yeah, I recond having the guild organize ppl to make lvl20 warlocks at key positions will be more common. Most people wouldnt want to pay an extra fee.
---
I didn't mean to say every tree has the same viability, balance in vanilla sucks we know that. My point was if you play a paladin you have to do every thing a paladin does, including healing, you can't avoid a piece of your kit because you don't like it, same goes for dps warrior who refuse to tank.
---
please tell me how buffing ret will fuck it up..
---
I think AV that existed in Vanilla is pretty Vanilla like stuff. If the iteration of AV is not the best for you it doesn't mean Classic team is wrong / people wouldn't prefer this iteration over your preferred one. Glad you voiced your opinion but you don't speak for all of the Classic community. Some of us aren't upset about the AV or have negative opinions about Classic team. 
---
Both versions of AV are authentic, it’s just the older AV had more heart to it. Would be nice if they had the old AV for a few months come release and then change it to the later one. Then after let the community decide which they would prefer. Perhaps a happy medium between the two? This is a big bummer.
---
AV 1.12 is not the worst of AVs. Yes it’s not ideal for the purists, but it’s still leaps ahead from what is now on retail.
---
You can still get the cosmetic version of both Shadowcraft and Darkmantle, so I would not regret upgrading it to 0.5. I still got 8/8 original Shadowcraft and the Darkmantle Bracers though. :-P
---
They'll overdo as they've shown time and the again they can't be trusted.
---
Also Ret is a good filter for retards who insist on playing stupid broken specs expecting to be carried and take weapons away from people whove actually earned them.
---
Crazy nostalgia when going through the wallpapers
---
And funny to find this:

Another point. In private servers you have mass number of players in each timezone. In Classic you will have european servers, US EAST/WEST based servers. Vast majority of the non goldselling player base is within 1-3 hours in the same timezone as the "server time".
---
Making PEAK gaming hours to be just that, a huge peak in server population. You dont have the private server, when europeans log off, US takes over.
---
And they could change the CD's, if they choose to aim for higher than vanilla like server populations. Not talking about 10k+, but like 4-5k pop compared to back then \~2-3k.
---
You have WSG to play if you want a zerg.
---
You are assuming this because im not for a zerg? You realize you have WSG for that right
---
i can't be the only one who was thinking Finkle's Skinner was in the OH...  =)
---
and WTF is versatility?
---
WHAT DO YOU TRYING
---
Its also just lame because it was cool to loot a piece of the enemies body, like why would you not implement that??
---
I dont mind having to heal at times as ret in a raid and i highly doubt ret should be healing considering thats what the healers are there for. 
---
the concern is mainly the viablility of ret you can expect a ret to heal when their dps is so damn low, heck they may not even get to sneak in a heal beause they will also get swapped out for another dps 
---
We had a new mage use fireball on Vael, not once noticing the resists. End of the fight the mage class leader was checking meters and calls him out, thinking he afked the fight. He got given a hard time for the rest of the run and never logged in again. 
---
Yes it was mean, but he was told to spec arcane/frost before raid, and didn’t notice every spell resisting. 
---
Both are great choices! Druid 
---
Then play god damn retail.
---
There is a difference with the "no changes" when its about AV. Because the older iterations of AV were in the spirit of Vanilla, it was not a zerg and made for memorable battles. The 1.12 AV is basically just AV in retail, it is **not** in the spirit of vanilla. Its just a zerg made to reduce the time it takes to complete it. 
---
This is the exact mentality that ruined retail WoW.
---
Oh wow, didn’t realise 1.12 was that bad.
---
in Iceland, we definitely don't have 3 months of summer.
---
When playing in the older AV it felt more like an epic battle. I didn’t care for the rewards all I cared about was the battle. Summoning the bosses escorting the flight guys back to your base so you could summon flying units. Farming harnesses to summon wolf riders. Having to team up with a bunch of people to take one bunker and chilling in it till it burned down. All of this made it feel huge.
---
*Play with him*
---
The answer to all life's questions.
---
You are thinking about the zanza potions, i think. Heart always persisted through death, but the +50 stamina potion only first did. Later it was changed from 3 tokes to 1, the same time you would loose at death. Dont think the heart buff was ever changed, but not sure, it was a long time ago.
---
Unless you are mixing it with ony/nef HEAD buffs.
---
lets see the source. (you wont link it because it literally doesnt exist)
---
its in 1.12.1 dont be shocked when it happens
---
No changes 
---
At your side, m'lady!
---
I think it’s more the case that this is the 100th post about it, while a minority will be disappointed by 1.12 AV the majority most likely can live with it. 
---
The whining gets infuriating when people cry for news, get news, cry it’s not the news THEY wanted. 
---
Personally I think the Classic Team fully understand what classic should and shouldn’t be, they’ve got a hell of a lot more data on it then anyone else and there’s not much we can do about it until it’s in front of us. 
---
Had hoped after the details of the pve side, they would do the same with bg, but oh well.
---
It's not going to be a major issue. Some things should stay in the past like 1 weekend long AVs. 
---
My stormwind on live is not empty, just thus guy on a dead server
---
I appreciate the advice, but there’s no way that would happen. My folks would crucify me lmao. Like I said, I really only see myself playing twice a week, and I’m good at staying disciplined when I want to be. YouTube is the real killer of my time tbh.
---
And its not even about the fee, you dont have summoners in example felwood songflower locations etc. Or lets say certain outdoor world bosses.
---
Haha nice one! 
---
Someone has to clear it, EVERYONE has to travel and run though for the buffs, combined time for the run and 35 (NOT 15) others travelling and getting the buffs?   
---
Oh not to mention 5 people clicking the same songflower wont work on retail servers so you now need everyone to run around felwood looking for spawns, this is a private realms bug that wont work on classic
---
as they said several times, they will work closely with the comunity so as long as the community asks for reaonable buffs to ret they should be able to do this right this time.
---
dont be so closed minded to improvements out of fear of the devs fucking up the game.
---
It literally takes way less effort to do more damage than a paladin as a warrior. you cant say a paladin doesnt deserve a weapon when they put in way more effort just to even try to be existant in the raid dps meter. 
---
People who actually earn something put the effort, playing a ret pally with all your effort still wont get you a weapon while some half assed warrior will take the weapon instead
---
Every class has a spec that is the best for raids. Some classes are lucky that they might get 2 or even 3 variations for raiding. I understand you want higher dps for paladins so they can be used in raids, however this is a slippery slope. Buff ret and surely you have to buff balance Druids too. And sub rogues. And arms warriors. And enhancement shaman. And beast mastery hunters. And others I’ve probably missed. 
---
Buff all the classes to do similar dps and now you have to adjust bosses to account for the different class/spec make up that is now being played. And to make all classes viable for pve we probably need to remove debuff limits too. 
---
This is a little exaggeration, but can you see the point? Blizzard is releasing an old game, that has a defined balance/meta. Making one change here, and another there... you’ll end up with different game to classic. And that’s not what the majority of people looking forward to classic are wanting 
---
Ok, so "ONLY the changes i like", got it.
---
&gt; Someone has to clear it, EVERYONE has to travel and run though for the buffs, combined time for the run and 35 (NOT 15) others travelling and getting the buffs?
---
To be clear, most get summons to DMT and mage teleports out. So travel to dmt, not so much. And since its the first buff you usually get, it doesnt matter if you travel there.
---
Oh No, that is such a tragedy, I really so hope they reconsider. I hated it when they nerfed
---
Well, that looks *thrilling* and was a real *tear-jerker*.
---
....Why do we want to do this content, again?
---
Your gonna petition Blizz to look into a possible inactive name on launch day?
---
SO now your locks have to farm 35+ extra shards, how long does that take?  The run still has to be cleared by someone.  You are literally showing that the time it takes to get the buffs combined is actually MORE than the time you are saving by having the buffs.  I have raided ALL content except Naxx and have done that without any world buffs OR EVEN A FLASK.  The content does not require all these buffs, especially when 95% of people here claim the content is a faceroll.  
---
If you are so poor your entire guild needs to collect raid buffs to clear content then thats up to you, I am just saying ITS NOT SAVING YOU ANY TIME.
---
M I C H A E L 
---
Honestly, I'm not certain about anything anymore. I played in retail vanilla but I have always played ALOT of private vanilla servers so some memories and recollections kind of merge together.
---
I have stress until June, than I'm good to go.
---
That's the thing though, they will mingle sometimes and what casuals consider "hardcore" isn't necessarily hardcore, but this subreddit comments about things would make you believe that if you say no to oomkins, shadow priests, and enhancement shamans in your raid then you're absolutely a min/maxing tryharding no-lifing wannabe hardcore elitist jerk who is going to hate this game because Vanilla is all about the journey and not the end result and [insert 20 more minutes of regurgitated bullshit].
---
I think it would be way more helpful to try and portray the middle ground and fix their "you either accept me in the raid group exactly the way I want to be accepted or you don't" attitude - while also explaining that most serious raiders are only going to expect them to play their raiding spec, show up on time, and maybe bring some consumables with them, and if they can do that they can probably raid with 95% of all guilds anywhere. 
---
There will not be any 8 hour long AV's
---
Guild banks.
---
Slight tweak to late stage PvP rankings (increase % of players that can attain ranks 12-14 so it's not as insane).
---
And, slightly controversial, but apply the BC tanking buffs to the hybrids. Let the Palys and Druids tank! This effects gear drops (since no good plate has both defensive AND +spell effects) and boss fights (boss fights need to be tweaked to deal with consecration), so I'd get if this was never tweaked but in all honestly, it wouldn't drastically break anything. It would likely make it better since it's awesome to have Paly and druid tanks. 
---
I started in BC but looking forward to Classic. Don't get me wrong I liked BC but it was sad that the 2 continents were basically irrelevant.
---
I'm something of a scientist myself
---
Night Elves do that even with Hamstring? lolz I gotta roll one
---
Planetside was exactly like this; the same feeling of just being a small cog in a big machine.
---
It's baffling how Blizzard does not seem to get this...
---
I forgot bout that point, but all I'm saying is I've done it before and it's hella easy, all you need to do is throw in a ticket and you'll have your name in a few hours
---
Gonna do it for alts
---
They actually said they do.
---
I actually recently did just this with my cousin. A huge runescape, SWG, and DAoC fan, I'd figure it would be easy for him. Problem is, he started as an alliance warlock. And I kinda pushed him to go that route. It was too much for him and he quit at level 22. In this case, a lock was just a little too complex of a character for him to really enjoy. 
---
So my advice: encourage your friend to play a mage or rogue since they are both really easy to get into, are a blast to play, and are pure dps so spec isn't to big of a factor. 
---
P.S. I've got nothing against locks but they are a complicated class, especially for a first time player. 
---
1.12.1 AV isn't the worst thing ever, but I'm afraid it might set a precedent for what's to come.
---
&gt;people were cool with 1.12 no changes  
---
That's not what the community behind a classic re-release wanted.  We existed, though smaller in number, since BC was released.  I always wanted a more or less exact re-release of vanilla content as it was originally released/patched.  The exception being simple bug fixes which weren't implemented until later in the expansion.  
---
Only after vanilla private servers became really popular did people start to push for 1.12 across the timeline.  
---
There's no reason they can "revert" 1.12.1 changes to AV to line up with their content release schedule. A "full" 1.12.1 Classic would have all content unlocked at day one but since they aren't doing that, you can soundly argue that they should try to mimic other changes that occurred in patches that line up to their content release schedule. 
---
I think it's a shame if they aren't trying to do this and it would be an even bigger shame if the main reason was because they don't have the game source from before 1.12.1 which would mean they would have to manually add in any map changes (which they can easily get reference for in a sandbox server) 
---
I wouldn't mind, if blizzard
---
* expanded the graphics options in both directions (quality ↔ runs on a toaster from 2004).
---
* added some of the newer interface options, especially if addons are already providing that functionality.
---
* made a limited version of the web-api available for classic.
---
I was a filthy casual. But I had a tonne of online friends. 2 of them were in this great guild, and I made a tonne more friends there.
---
I was pretty decent at the game (no where near elite tho) and just really enjoyed hanging out on discord with them.
---
And those fuckers.
---
They bought me my first epic without telling me anything.
---
Just showed up, upon request, in front of my favourite city (Undercity!) and they gave me Brain Hacker. 2 of them had saved up for it.
---
Gosh, community was EVERYTHING back then. How I miss it :]
---
I think this is an important point.  The people who loved the 'old' AV are likely to be the people who long for 'old' WoW, before everything was spoon fed to you.  
---
Er don't know anything yet. Also, just avoid stvietnam.
---
Dwarf Priest cause I love that while levelling I can help people as I go along, see a warrior pull 2 mobs and it’s getting dicey BOOM. Have a heal bud!
---
 It’s a small gesture of good will that makes someone’s day a little easier (or a lot depending on the graveyard location) it’s just a great feeling knowing they were probably ready to sigh from dying and now they can smile and carry on! 
---
As a future EU PVP player I'm not concerned, but I understand your fears. Just stick to pvp servers and hope for the best.
---
payo
---
Mining only works well with epic mount first
---
Skin what? Dunno if you can do devilsaurs and you likely gonna be ganked by rogues and hunters there
---
Whatever you do don’t hold their hand
---
this is 2.0 minimum but that doesn't change much 
---
I joined an 11hr av a few months ago, never underestimate peoples ability to turtle av
---
I remember a bug in TBC where alliance in our battlegroup got matched with a russian horde battle group (and vice-versa) for a week or two.
---
Both factions on my battlegroup lost pretty much every BG, the Russian pcs had unrenderable names (everyone was ???????-ServerName) and looked like they were hacking/teleporting around the map due to lag. It was ridiculous.
---
1.12.1 and 2.0 wasint diffrent only that Vanndar died faster due to 2.0 talents but u still rushed it in 5 mins.
---
Because nobody specifically memorized what version was associated with what patch.  People who long for *old* AV are referring to the early interation(s) of AV, before 1.12.
---
I think weapon traders will come in a different stage despite being the BG itself 1.12.
---
So it's not necessarily a game breaker.
---
i think fel armor was introduced in TBC :)
---
That tells me nothing. 
---
I'd love to see some random early wow stuff sprinkled into 1.12 classic.  maybe 1 weekend a year when we get captain placeholder and korrak back, or a few months at the beginning of a server where we can still buy unarmored mounts.
---
This almost certainly isn't true. What phase BGs are in decides this, and I seriously doubt it will be Phase 1.
---
It's seems pretty common sense the bg reward weps will be content gated into a later patch. Both the reputation rewards and hero quest rewards are very strong items that invalidate huge amounts of pve content. Why would you think they will be available at launch?
---
This is cool.
---
Add class search and maybe ilvl and required level :)
---
Bingo, couldn't put it any better.
---
Rogue player here.
---
It's quite simple, I love meele dps. I hate ranged dps. It's just my personal playstyle. 
---
I got like a mage in wotlk, but I found it super boring to range dps. 
---
You have to be on your toes, have some movement skills and be aware of your CDs in Pve. 
---
PvP you can kill people in one stun rotation or just vanish sprint and leave, if you can't take them down. 
---
You can just walk into an enemy city and annoy the other faction. 
---
I think stealth is the best skill in the game. 
---
The clear cons of the class is the amount of buffs you have to farm. You can not be afk daydreaming, you need to be on your toes at all times to do max damage and also kick is a super powerful skill.
---
Also every raid is designed to murder meeles. 
---
And also getting equipment isn't going to be easy. 
---
Finding groups was a non issue for me, I got invited to groups, since I was pretty good. I think that goes for every class. If you got a good reputation, people put you on their FL and invite you. 
---
Rogue is in my opinion for players who want to stealth through the world, do things that nobody else can, but also have a lot of time on their hands. I couldn't even play a twink, that is how busy I always was with the rogue. 
---
I know Blizzard won't have the manpower to pull it off, but it would be cool if 1 or 2 of the PvP servers they released came with 'old' AV/BGs (queue at portals in the world), that being the only difference between the other PvP servers.
---
This wasn't ever allowed in vanilla because of this exact reason. It's pretty dumb, being camped really isn't ever a problem, so I dunno if they will restrict it again. If you're that scared of being inconvenienced for 5 mins then go for it I guess.
---
I played a lot of AV before Korak got removed and let me tell you, AVs back then really lasted for days. There was so much stuff to do and every time a new Av started people ran like maniacs to snowfall to get Korrak for the Spear Quest.
---
It was a fun nice Bg for doing some alone stuff or just join with 5 of your pals and do some little things. I always got the impression that taking graveyards/towers was a thing but you could help your team by just killing players and turning in the body parts of your enemies.
---
I had to take a break and played a little bit after Naxx release and boy was the bg different. Battlegrounds generally were quicker, maybe except for WSG because there was no timer. AV ended usually on the same day once an Überguild joined the BG in force and just murdered the enemy general. What I noticed was the decreased amount of honour that bg awarded. You had a lot of guards/lietenants guarding stuff and they awarded a lot of honor for killing. In 1.12 there were hardly any noteworthy npcs left so things like a Cavalry attack or Air attack didn't ahve the same impact. 
---
Zerging was always a thing. I vividly remember a spirited defense of Alliance(I was a warrior) of Belinda and we defenden her for over 3 hours and the Horde just threw bodies at her. We only beat the Horde back once we got some Ram Riders to help and then Forestlord vs. Icelord battle started in the center and the point of battle shifted.
---
Another distinct change that I actually welcomed were mines. Before they were removed, you could really die rather quickly to cheeky hunters or mages standing in mines and you running at them like a retard. I died so many times to mines, it was not even funny.
---
AV will certainly be min maxed no matter in what state it is released.
---
I played different versions both on private servers and on retail vanilla and even pre nerf AV you can zerg and it is in your interest to do so from min max point of view since it gives more honour and faster reputation. It is a long way to exalted reputation.
---
Pre nerf AV though was much harder to zerg and mostly organised groups would do it. They simply clear faster than opposite faction. AV ends in about 7 minutes. What happens in PUG usually is that some people are semi afk, or herbing/fishing etc and some are committed to "turtling", this results in only like 20ish people actively pushing, so with just 10ish people defending and NPCs it is enough to cause a stalemate.
---
Difference between versions of AV is how hard is it to stop a PUG, because a PUG can not stop a good organised group in any version.  And it is notably easier to stop a PUG in early versions of AV, sine NPCs are stronger. Also add to this that people back then simply had way worse gear/internet/pc/knowledge and you would get almost always a stalemate.
---
For me personally I don't mind 1.12 AV. Multi day AVs can be fun, but they can get annoying too really fast. A lot of people are not much into PvP (especially 40x40) and rewards are really good for PvE. In 1.12 you can cause a stalemate with a good group anyway, just that games will end sooner on average.
---
AHHHHHHHHHHH
---
THIS MAKES ME WANT CLASSIC SO BAD
---
Reddit, the gaming community desperately needs Classic WoW to save it.
---
I actually believe Classic WoW will end every BR that isn't Fortnite.
---
i wasn’t trying to be a dick with my comment i was just saying you can find a tight knit group of friends in other MMO’s, not just this one if you were holding out for it for that reason alone
---
I had forgotten how people would actively ask for the imp so they could have the Blood Pact buff. :]
---
I want to play a healer, and I'm really going to miss dual spec when I want to farm.
---
No xrealm bgs would not only be accepted but welcomed as it's how the game was intended to work. It existing does not address a core issue, rather it addresses a symptom of one, and it has no need to exist since arena will not be present. 
---
I could tolerate a few specific class changes. The game isn't going to be fundamentally different if prot paladin or feral have a taunt, and a taunt alone isn't enough to really fix either spec. I doubt baking some sort of mana regen system into 31 prot really breaks anything for paladin, either. Would giving druids an out of combat res really break anything? No way, and the class could use a bit of help regardless. 
---
DM likely needs it's gold farming nerfed. 
---
I wouldn't really be upset with gear tweaks, either. It's kind of stupid that hunters have like 4 viable weapons at 60. 
---
Just because we're no changes doesn't mean there aren't multiple ways the game could be improved. The issue is that will blizzard come to the correct conclusions and would the player base help to steer them towards what is correct? That answer is almost certainly no, which is why I would never actually advocate for any of this. 
---
People need to understand there's still tons that we don't know.
---
If the community doesn't want the weapon trader in.. Then just start posting it.
---
People need to realize the community's opinion will really change what Blizzard does.. Unless it's just a terrible decision ex; "WE WANT SHARDING." 
---
I don't think they'll have the rewards etc. in the game at launch lmao.
---
Hilarious, thanks for that comment. I'm faction-neutral btw, both rock
---
nice pet bar placement
---
Ah Desolace, love it or hate it
---
100yard range and shadowmeld. 
---
That's the exact situation I was thinking of when I wrote that part. Should be fine healing in a dps spec till about 40 but after that it'll get expensive
---
I feel like we need to push retadins into their subsections. Can I call a vote? 
---
This is so sad. Alexa play despacito.

I want old AV just so I can say "told you so" when people start bitching about it.
---
Hi, /u/dalejayok
---
I swear i was going to make the same identical meme. Good job.
---
Uhm, which private server had the original mines and archers and all that? I've never seen that.
---
I know you can't say the name, but has anyone actually tried like 1.5 AV on a private server? I'm pretty sure it doesn't exist.
---
Isn't pvp being Introduced in a later patch anyway? This isn't going to be an issue on launch.
---
Why do elves have such *amazing* eyebrows?
---
AV isn't going to last days anymore. People have hyper analyzed this game to death. Optimal strategies will be found and even the old versions would be done in a couple hours max.
---
Most people are guessing July 16th it seems. All speculations tho
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ais8pc/classic\_wow\_will\_be\_released\_on\_july\_16th\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ais8pc/classic_wow_will_be_released_on_july_16th_and/) 
---
I bet good money that an overwhelming majority of players won’t hit 60 in 8 days played. Even 10 is going to be rarer than not.
---
No changes. Play retail. They literally made the wrong decision with available yesterday.
---
Replay warrior if you want 2 handed DPS.
---
I understand what you're saying, but it's fine for people to discuss this, I don't understand the issue. Saying that we're gonna play it anyways so it's fine it just eliminating all discussion, what's the use of that?
---
Isn't the whole point of this forum to help tell Blizzard what we want and how we want it? They changed progressive itemization because of the feedback, what's wrong with saying people prefer pre 1.12 AV?
---
Stop trying to drown out legitimate discussion.
---
Well it isn't a weapon you buy for rep or battleground currency. It is a quest reward weapon.  
---
That's why I'm concerned about it. If they drop AV too early it will break the ranged weapon gear progression  
---
You've seen *MULTIPLE* posts? So a couple posts out of what, thousands? Tens of thousands.
---
Get real dude. Almost nobody is saying that.
---
Also I don't know if you played old AV, but nobody played for 18 hours. You played a couple of hours and came back the next day to the same BG. Get off your high horse.
---
I'm totally content with July even if Summer starts in June.
---
I think July does make since it's right in the middle?
---
thanks for linking the post
---
This seems cowardly, wasteful, and ultimately pointless. Ganking won’t be enough of a problem on 2.5k-3k pop servers to warrant this move.
---
Plain and simple, I like it
---
That’s good advice, it’s definitely a game where the sense of wonder and adventure is most captivating. 
---
Well 1.12 AV is not even a pvp battleground, it's more like a short 40-man dungeon with 1 boss.
---
It wasn't when it was 4 phases, why would it now that its 6 phases. Dunno what OP is on about 
---
You're gonna need to explain that one. 
---
It's what we've previously been told yes
---
Another funny thing with that is that warlocks and paladins will not be able to get their special 100% mount until DM release except if they drop 1k on a regular mount.
---
Ganking isn't gonna be as big an issue as on private servers with 8-10k pop. 
---
Very interesting you mention that. I’ve been considering if it’s best to let him go with what his instinct is. Or if it’s better to advise certain classes for an easier, more fun Introduction 
---
Fair enough. Different means to the same end though - getting where you weren't supposed to be
---
Good job it isn't launching with av then. Next.
---
Interesting take. I’ve never though of it like that, and for some reason never dug into Kalimdor like I did the Eastern Kingdoms. Is there still room to explore and level in eastern kingdoms as a Nelf? I think Stranglethorn might be my favorite zone in the entire game. 
---
Lmao god damn this is gonna be a hard choice. Fortunately I have more than half a semester to think about it! 
---
Yeah I can't wait to play and stop suffering through shit posts about stuff that isn't true or snowflakes wanting to raid as meme specs and do 20% of other people's DPS.
---
It doesn't work. The bosses die easy. Korrak is only done for that quest. 
---
Can't wait to dupe epic boes lmao
---
All are good for pvp, they all do different things. Warrior is the only one that has a bit of trouble because he needs a babysitter but when you do get someone to heal/cleanse you, holy crap is it fun. 
---
Mage great CC
---
Hunter (not great CC) but decent damage, some fun meta stuff you can do and mini pet game. 
---
Rogue. Well. Rogue. 
---
All will be decent- great at pvp but it’s not like it is in live. You will always be feared by warlocks and shadow priests so get used to it. 
---
I think you won't be able to rush like this until mid/late AQ with 40 geared players and a very strong tank.
---
Dunno mate search it. It's posted 9 times a day.
---
Damn I still have PTSD from pallytanking.
---
Mages refuse to even attack without BoW, or just blink into nova+ crit CoC+arcane explosion spam before you even reach the mobs, and claim pally can't hold aggro.
---
Classic will be full of morons, but this time I'll be ready.
---
The only way I'm buffing people with AI is if I'm running somewhere and don't plan on fighting everything. If someone ASKS me for a buff when questing then I probably will, but I'm not just gonna slap an AI on a warrior so he can level his weapon skill 5% faster.
---
I'm mostly just ribbing ya lol but yes I've had 1 or 2 names released like this too.
---
Because they made it very clear they know we don't want sharding, they don't want to use it since it's not a part of vanilla and they they'll only use it at launch.
---
You can basically heal them to full with a single heal. It's way more efficient than them drinking.
---
$11
---
Great and great, it's okey for some HP regen but it doesnt give that much.  Other stats are better.
---
But ofc, at earlier lvls. If the staff increase your damage a lot and have stats good for a warrior. Sure. But if you take an +int staff because it's a bit better than your axe, you're a douche.
---
Why do US government contractors pay $300,000 a year for truck drivers in Syria?
---
If they can just pay whatever they want why dont they just pay like .....$40,000 all your doing is driving a truck...anyone can drive a truck
---
Labour skill set scarcity is what determines what companies will pay you and nothing else. Google doesnt pay people under $150k total comp for developers for a reason, because they would only get garbage developers
---
That's not gonna do much against a mage :P
---
But tipping is a silly American thing. The rest of us like to know the price. 
---
I thought about getting another pc for wow classic when it releases, but playing on pservers I'm still getting 60fps on my hp envy 15t that I've had a couple years. So honestly there is likely no need to get a new computer
---
Let's see if Blizzard will listen to the community on this one.
---
I love how ganking is always underplayed.
---
&gt; If you're that scared of being inconvenienced for 5 mins then go for it I guess.
---
More like "if you are that scared of being unable to do any quests in redridge for an evening, then go for it I guess".
---
I'm gonna miss the good parts of PvP servers for sure, but lets not make it better than it was.
---
Monitor, keyboard &amp; mouse. You’re already set 
---
How is Spriest a mana battery in vanilla? 
---
It's only fun for one or two times, after thst you'll wanna pull your hair out. 
---
From my limited knowledge, the Horde are basically more or less morally ambiguous as a collective. They all exist with each other, connected by a sense of camaraderie and honor rather than some higher power moral justification for a political agenda. This is why I play Horde. The Alliance have done a lot of similarly fucked up things, like Orc concentration camps, Troll genocides, murdering of innocent Tauren, complete and utter dejection of the Forsaken based on practically nothing but vain observable physical characteristics, expulsion and neglect of an entire race of elves, and so on. The only difference is that the Alliance likes to justify their actions by "othering" the races they see as lesser, creating a false sense of a "holier-than-thou" attitude in relation to any race that doesn't join their circle jerk. The Horde has its faults, and certainly a deeply problematic past, but at least they don't try to deceive themselves into thinking they're making greater good actions as a collective. The Horde exist to survive and thrive. The Alliance exist to dominate and subjugate. Sorry for the rant.
---
You couldn’t transfer from pve to pvp in vanilla, hell I don’t think you could create a character on the opposing faction on a pvp realm. 
---
People want no changes from Vanilla, not no changes from 1.12. Any content pre 1.12 is fine. Nice strawman though, enjoy the circlejerk guys!
---
Thought that was sort of a joke. That’s like me asking for my Dell desktop with 512MB of ram back to play classic wow on
---
Giving druids a rez
---
They won't use the same client as private servers do, check the minimum requirements for Legion or BFA for a more likely estimate.
---
Dude's trying to give you suggestions but you apparently have the answers/counter to each of his points, even though the things you say are completely strange and lacking of proper thought.   
---
Why? It's better to have an offspec healer than no healer.
---
Most ferals indeed have a few points in resto tree but I don't have any, yet never had any issue healing leveling dungeons. Gear matters more than spec for druid healing.
---
Guild banks, transparency is easier if all members can open it and see for themselves, would also let me manage it without wasting an alt slot and having to swap characters to manage it
---
With AQ gear you could 10 man vanndar
---
1.12 talents / debuff priority system / 1.12 item stats along with only 1.2 content is already a big deal.
---
1.12 was not balanced around MC being the endgame content. It does indeed need to be rather "easy", as it was back in the day, but I would accept minor number tweaks to make it slightly harder.
---
No world buffs inside raids is also a change I'm fine with. Currently in pservers, getting wbuffs is practically a mandatory annoying task that also trivializes some bosses.
---
Respec costs are fine either way. 50g respecs encourages hybrid specs and increases class/role identity. Lower respec costs encourage pvp. I can live with either.
---
DM farming could be a huge problem to server economy in the long run. I'm pretty sure gold farming in DM is something blizzard would have fixed if it was too popular back then. We'll see when classic comes out.
---
Then hello 30 frames open world, 8 frames raid.
---
New feature in BfA. It's a 20-man instance that's unlocked by a sort of timed mini war effort. Like in Alterac Valley the point is to kill the enemy general, having to capture points and collect resources in the process (which in turn can be used to buy upgrades for your base and give advantage to your team). Currently the two released warfronts are Arathi Highlands and Darkshore. The faction that controls the zone can complete quests in that zone until the enemy faction unlocks the warfront again. Here's the problem: they're PvE. This itself is not a problem, but it has as the unfortunate result that the "defending" faction has no way to actually defend the zone, putting the warfronts on an eternal rotation. It's also impossible to lose a warfront and yet they take forever, making them kind of boring and predictable. While retail players still like the idea behind warfronts, as they exist now they're considered failed experiments.
---
Oh yeah I from the Balkans would just love play with people who don't speak English, thanks.
---
You think you poo..But you shart
---
I'm actually beatanking in pservers. Problem is, we don't know how reliable pserver data is. Most actual vanilla druids said they REALLY struggled with beartanking even after the armor patch, they were just too squishy.
---
Another part of the equation is raiding. We know druids are bad main tanks and okayish off tanks in pservers. Do I wan't the hassle of playing a suboptiomal class for a role? If the raid is good it won't be a problem, but isn't that getting carried?
---
"hurr durr masterrace" memes aside, but current gen consoles aren't powerful enough to run wow.
---
Not exactly, sometimes guilds would organise and turtle for hours to grind honor, I can see that happening again 
---
The lenght and epicness of AV you are in totality depends on tactic of your team, not on version. On horde side, you can prolong it by at least 30 min all by your self. 
---
The overhelming majority settled for 1.12 and no changes. Lets keep it that way.
---
I loved old, turtle for days AV, It is where I had the most fun PVPing in the game, along with wintergrasp.
---
That said, it is gone forever. Even if blizzard implemented 1.5 AV, people would just rush it, the players have changed and there is no going back.
---
What I would do is implement a 1.13 AV, to please the most people posible.
---
Just 2 changes: 
---
\-First, remove the black lotus that spawns in the middle.
---
\-Second, Add back Korrak, and put a stack of 5 black lotus 100% garanteed in his loot table.
---
Now people could just rush to the boss for honor...but most will clash in the middle for a battle for korrak before doing so giving back some old AV nostalgic feels before the rush begins again.
---
Just my 2 cents.
---
Yes. Spells with longer spell casts get the full buff, while instant spells (like frost nova or fireblast) get less. This ensures the relative strength of each spell during the whole gearing up process and does not make casting time spells irrelevant later on.
---
I believe you. But you need to be full gear from BWL/AQ, which take time. That's why i said mid/late AQ.
---
Atm we don't know either when AV will be release.
---
I never got it with my human mage even though I wanted it sooooooo bad.
---
^ I agree with this. People now know what to do to and won't be farming kills in Field of Strife for the sake of it. Unless they like doing it ofcourse. 
---
On my vanilla home realm (Executus EU) we fought for hours on end just to keep the Horde from capping Snowfall GY. Most players had no idea why we fought there(me included) and it created scenarios like this which indeed lastet for 12h+;
---
 https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/41qzaa/oldschool_alterac_valley_slaughter/
---
Cos otherwise it would trivialise early content. Why should you get raid quality gear without raiding.
---
In that case give me free rank 11 war mount at rank 3.
---
I do this too, but you end up in a conundrum.. if there are stupid wipes again, do you follow through and leave? If so, you're part of the problem aren't you? If not, then they know you weren't sincere and they'll go back to not trying. 
---
Its a catch up mechanic, would not make sense to have it in at the start no? 
---
Back in Vanilla there were no russian servers. 
---
Except for one that was claimed by russian community (Warsong EU?). 
---
But tbh nowadays people try to join one-sided servers since it's most effective for PvE progress (and top PvE guilds/streamers are usually there). Not sure how PvP would work out. 
---
I play on a Dell XPS 13 9370 with a 13" screen with 0 issues.
---
If raiding presents issues I'll buy a 24" 1080p monitor.
---
Fingers crossed we get the WoW Launcher back :D 
---
If people really are in it for the community shouldn’t they be able to find other pieces of content BESIDES AV to form a community around? Because if not, they’re not really in it for the community. 
---
The day before I will probably make sure to give everyone I care about my utmost attention, so they WANT me to leave them alone the next few weeks. Mindgames. 
---
I haven't seen many people talking about this, but personally i'd love to have these mounts added to the game since they are part of vanilla, they could let it for 1 month or until next phase so people can have a chance of getting it before it gets patched.
---
No the colors are randomly generated
---
If it's anything like classic servers there will still be quite a few AVs that drag on for several hours, but maybe that was a side effect of super high server pop.
---
Maybe if you're in front of the crowd.  Chances are most people will be much more slow than that.  Especially if they aren't completely familiar with the terrain.  I believe my first 60 had around 18 days played.  I ran every dungeon along the way and explored everything I could
---
No u
---
This version of AV was the one that also made people quit playing AV =/ And it was only the longest by ONE DAY. And 1.5 to 1.8 versions were almost identical with smaller changes, together that version of AV (the one people remember as epic) is the one we want..
---
Old school AV was a selling point for Classic, having Zerg AV ruins that.
---
&gt; If you are so poor your entire guild needs to collect raid buffs to clear content then thats up to you
---
You are missing the point, currently doing AQ+BWL+MC in one 3-3.5h raid. Its saving us time inside the raid instances, it saving us consumables. Getting the buffs you can do over 1-4 day period, whenever you like. You can prepare with couple of friends or do it solo. And what do you gain by it ? Fast, easy runs and it minimized the time when everyone is REQUIRED to be online.
---
Getting ZG+Ony buff is PART of the raid time, optional buffs like DMT, SF etc you can get on your own. 
---
Were getting buffs to minimize raid time (while not going nuts on speedrun skip tactics). If you prefer doing it slower on multiple days and without any buffs, good luck with that.
---
Ps. Our locks dont do the summoning to DMT/felwood, its our own L20 alts that do that. You can spend few gold to BUY a cleared DMT id. Or a summon to there if needed.
---
Usually people will watch personality-based streamers for the humor that person provides, rather than high-end gameplay. I watch both, to each his own.
---
Will it be possible to add items with random suffixes ?  - would be usefull for some twink brackets // farming spots
---
I think it’d be a nice nod to have both available for Classic. Don’t make into some levelling rushing achievement. 
---
I mean it does suck, they know exactly that people have been talking about the old Alterac Valley for a decade, the old Alterac Valley is almost synonymous with Vanilla Wow.
---
I'm readying the piss-bottles as we speak.
---
More seriously, though, I don't think I'll play much at the start. I always find the first 20 levels or so very tedious and demotivating. 
---
The real fun for me usually begins at Level 40 and I take way too long to reach that point.
---
Don’t you guys have forums ?
---
It probably won't even be an issue tbh. Just avoid them when they're live.
---
Whats so weird or hillarious about it tho? I think its more weird to think that 1.12 is PERFECT for EVERY ASPECT of the game..
---
I'm not going to google it for you.
---
Would be neat to have.
---
Won is the lonliest number 
---
Im filtering for other answers
---
Idk if it's your thing, but The division 2 has been scratching that itch for me until classic arrives. Looter/shooter. But trust me as soon as classic comes I'm dropping all other games.
---
Releasing 5 different versions of the same battleground is really the only way.
---
Confusing as shit but literally no other alternative.
---
I could never play on a PVE Server, your missing out on half of the game content.
---
Auto attack still on button 1. Now thats a first character if Iv’e ever seen one
---
But when you keep making those changes, you end up with what we have now in retail.
---
There's a REASON why WoW had the particular feel and style and gameplay that it did back then. Yes, things were unbalanced, stuff didn't work. It took longer to do things. But it added flavour to the world.
---
Ditto lol ice barb then AFK out 
---
I'm not either. 
---
The one thing i've always wanted but will never have 
---
Unless classic attracts more casual players that pservers never could. 
---
No it's 3rd. 
---
Warrior
---
Pally/shaman
---
Anyone got actual pictures and not sprites
---
Trash blade is also pretty great for tanking. Aside from Serithil (spelling?) with 100 armor, from memory there aren’t any defensive stat weapons pre-raid. The extra attacks generate more rage, for more threat generation can be useful 
---
Well, I heard that at some point Blizzard make Sulvanas the season facto bad guy. But I meant in classic. The factions were much more neutral back in classic
---
my initial plan for classic involved a new pc, but now i'm thinking that's the last thing i'm going to upgrade.  currently looking at chair and desk replacements, as well as finally moving up to two monitors.  shopping sales over the last year or so has yielded a top tier mouse, mechanical keyboard, and headset.
---
even still, i am not prepared.
---
so it is possible
---
As a guy who's gonna play druid healer.
---
Nahhhh. Looking forward to not having to run back and be rez bitch every time.
---
I want to play ~~Classic~~ Vanilla for the nostalgia, fuck me right?
---
Yeah me too man
---
It’s the sole reason I don’t consider Druid over priest or shaman atm. Nothing worst than waiting around for a single dps to run back in a 5 man cause no one can rez : /
---
Yes yes 1000 times yes
---
That's not true it would be literally impossible for healers to raid.
---
Yes! If your card has a bass out get a simple subwoofer. Try to get one with a variable cutoff so you can tune it to your other speakers and your room.
---
not if you have done the ride a million times before.
---
Horde wins by defending and wiping the alliance at the start, its just they refuse to def
---
I cannot decide between Hunter, Mage and Priest. 
---
Played Gnome Rogue through all of vanilla and TBC so definitely want to try something else.
---
Not even decided between Alliance or Horde yet if I’m honest. 
---
Not sure what I will do at end game but most likely casual raiding and PvP as I don’t have the time to raid 4-5 times a week like back in the days when I had no responsibilities. 
---
I expect a guild of parents, with full time jobs still be able to do some raiding and clear most of the raids this time around due to better pcs/connection and knowledge so hopefully I can experience all of that again somewhat. 
---
I don’t think I’ll have the time to absolute min/max with professions and so on (tailoring for bis robe, then swap etc) so I’m looking for something that will give me a rather comfortable levelling experience and at the same time be fun and somewhat challenging at end game but not too gear independent, farming gold should be of some ease as well. 
---
The more I type this I’m realising that either Mage or Hunter should be a more realistic choice then Priest, unless I go shadow but that will limit my raiding chances a lot.
---
Some guidance would be of help. Two professions I can stick with from 1-60 that’s viable - alchemy / herb I guess is always good but engineering could be worth the hassle as well.
---
Orc Hunter? Troll/UD mage? Human Mage? Human Priest? Dwarf Hunter?
---
I just keep spinning between all the options constantly.
---
I remember on my Shaman, I finally got dual wield, but only 1 weapon was attacking. I opened a ticket.... It turned out I wasn't supposed to continually tap the attack button on my task bar....
---
Gimmeh that rotting corpse for EPL.
---
Because it was a catch-up mechanic.
---
The most fun of world buffs is laughing at the melee dps who die on the first pull, effectively wasting an hour or so if their time collecting the buffs. 
---
Or as a fury warrior, not dying on a messy pull that kills all the other fury warriors so you’re guaranteed to top dps for the bosses. 
---
Coordinated ganks on opposite guild factions before they raid is the best, stopping their buffs and pissing them off. On a small private server with only 2 raiding guilds on each faction, we as top horde would go and pick every song flower when we see them land in dark shore. Or have everyone logged out on ZG island and one rogue watching, then all log in simultaneously to aoe them down while they are waiting for heart. 
---
I still remember the day they destroyed av back in classic and my hate posts are still saved in the old forums. I hoped something would bring back old av, but this change breaks my heart and makes it clear we are NEVER getting old av back. The saddest thing of all is that people defend this action by blizzard. You can’t have “epic” stuff when you design them to cater everyone.... then you get “common” stuff...l
---
I would love to play healer. But I am also worried about how I am going to make money if I can't farm very good.
---
Can anyone help me out with ideas? 
---
https://www.warcraftmounts.com/retired.php 
---
thats the best i could find, you can go to the classic ones and click on them to get better pics
---
It's beautiful.
---
Why do you assume we will have BGs at launch ?
---
There's a difference between being susceptible to rushing, and being rushed every goddamn game. The version on most 1x vanilla servers often produce hour long games (but definitely not the 12+ hour ones).
---
just play a PvE server
---
Yep. Probably between 4 and 5 months between launch and Phase 2. Even fastest top guilds, that by some miracle will have enough lvl 60s in 2 weeks after launch to start raiding, they will still gear up in MC and Ony 4 months later.
---
It's just not enough gear for 40 people.
---
And that is for the fastest top guilds.
---
90% of the guilds will not even start raiding in first month.
---
Source? I’d be interested to read that.
---
Yeah, bout 80-90% will pas 10 days/played.
---
I'd say somewhere between cross server play and auto dungeon finder.
---
Flasks are crazy expensive, thankfully not really needed outside of progressing aq40/naxx. 
---
The only thing you really need are resistance potions. Some consumables like Stoneshield Potion for tanks are very strong and fairly cheap, so might as well pick them up. Food buffs are nice, but not a big deal. You can clear the 3 raids for around 10-30g of consumes, depending on raid, most of which you wont actually use and can save for next run.
---
They only have 1.12 data. Were these in the 1.12 data?
---
Also, I don't know how it worked. Did this *change* into the later version? Or did you get to keep this and show it off later?
---
If it changed, it won't be in Classic, for sure.
---
They share GCD
---
So it finally happened...
---
Kronos is undertuned and not reflective of what classic will be like.  
---
Isnt that the case for most classes though? Class quests being really annoying (according to u) and a chore to buff etc
---
Having to be in discord or w.e with 39 other people is the one thing I’m not looking forward to, I’ll probably end up rage quitting guilds that don’t enforce push-to-talk only.
---
They were introduced in Patch 1.0, but yea they kept it appearance and they are in the 1.12 data.
---
Most likely the game will run a little bit *better* then the old client.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGQ8w46JOL4
---
Looking forward to the inevitable “I geared up my X (off-spec class)” why do I keep getting kicked from raids,
---
Well, then it's up to Blizzard to include them or not. We'll see.
---
Not much, for a very long time.
---
Reason is flasks. There won't be any for sale for the first 5-6 months. And if by some miracle there will be flasks for sale, they will cost A FUCKING LOT.
---
Like 200g each.
---
People won't sell flasks outside guilds for a long time.
---
So, when you take away the flasks cost...the other consumables are peanuts. Well, 30-50g / raid, but peanuts compared to a 200g flask.
---
You're correct.
---
Really disappointing. I started playing in tbc and was looking forward to experiencing old AV.
---
Part of a PvP server is being ganked and accepting that. Makes it feel all the more worth it once you hit 60.
---
If you want to level on a PvE server that's fine, but I wouldn't bother transferring after that.
---
Endless AV was dog shit
---
You could roll a paladin, good aoe farm if you have a good shield 
---
Yeah so right now i’m leveling in DWM I think? The one with Theramore in it, I got killed twice not paying attention and wasted close to 20 mins running and 5 minutes drinking..
---
Ganking is a time-wasting monotonous thing but i’ll level 2-3 characters at a time and log over when I need to tbh.
---
Yeah, all iterations of AV suck
---
1 month isn't even enough time for most people to reach 60.
---
Try to less to be the director and more to be the walking wikipedia.
---
Some of my friends also started playing wow with me,.
---
Let them enjoy the game by themselves as long as they are fine with it. If they only use 3 Buttons let them play that way, the moment will come in which these 3 Buttons aren't enough to get everything done. Don't explain them their whole rotation while still being in the character selection. Be patient with them answer questions if they have any. If they don't have questions don't flood them with information.
---
Casted my Renew, About to cast a Mindblast then PW:P on a mob and then some dick instant casts (mage fireblast etc) tagging the mob, then runs off to continue fighting his own one while I have aggro. So I fade and watch a shit mage die. 
---
You’d be surprised the amount of people struggle with just two mobs even on a class like a mage
---
You gon act like a bitch, you gon die like a bitch 
---
The average gamer will take MORE than three months to hit 60.  I am VERY experienced, and have been playing casually on a private realm maybe 2-3 hours a day at that rate it takes THREE MONTHS to get to 60.  Why would Blizzard release the second content phase before MOST players have even hit level cap?
---
I’ll be honest i’ll be playing classic for fun but the idea of queuing into a day long AV that gets turtled and we lose sounds like a fucking nightmare when I just want to farm the rep.
---
I actually did the Frostwolves rep in premades during Lk so this version will be pretty good IMO.
---
Reminds me of the time I rolled 99 on the briarwood reed and some other guy rolled 99 too, rng gave it to him for some reason, I had been trying to get it for 2 weeks and that dude had just hit 60. I rage quit and did not log in for 2 weeks.
---
With todays simcrafting we will know for sure soon.
---
Guess you never played retail vanilla 
---
That's why it doesn't make sense though.  
---
Tier 1 gear pales in compared to tier 2. So released a sub tier 1 gear for catch up when Tier 2.5/3 is released?
---
For the time and gold you're spending, it's just easier to just buy gear/craft/grind av rep.  
---
Catch up might have worked back in \~2005 when most people were noobs and only 1% of players really got aq40/naxx.   
---
Don’t you understand son? I want no changes (except for the few golden changes I personally suggest)...
---
&lt;— that is how this sub seems to feel.
---
If JP was my Dad i'd suicide 
---
Yes, the rogue player in me agrees pretty well with this. I'd rather be in a raid party of rogues camping world buff parties at key areas in world pvp than be in a pve raid world buff chasing world firsts. I had many fond memories of stealthing around doing rogue only activities.
---
My main concern is the potential of the average player to be past the threshold of knowing how to counter rogues and make them feel less effective and fun to play. But chances are the average classic player being similar to what we had at the end of origional vanilla.
---
I think I would lose my mind being the last couple of dudes not logged out just running against a wall.
---
Interesting, I suppose it wouldnt hurt to have both a warrior and hunter leveling at the same time and seeing which one I naturally gravitate towards. Also hoping for close servers for sub 200 ping.
---
Ooooh, how do I farm as paladin? 
---
Most players outside the US (and also a shit ton of US players) because of the date weren't level 60 in Vanilla when DM was released. It didn't break the game for them, did it?
---
All that schedule screaming is only to please pserver players. The rest of the population won't care about that in the slightest.
---
My point of the above post is specially in regard to the fact that some of the delayed content are things like 5 mans, level 60 class quests, mostly non raid content, is content that should not be delayed, or at least not too much. Most of us don't care at what speed they release raids because as you said we won't be fast, we won't be rushing endgame PvE (because there is a shit ton of others things to do), but we do care about things like DM, T0.5 and PvP. Do not mix everything.
---
Never read a source anywhere but the overall consensus is that balancing raids, bosses, PvP etc. with shamans and paladins in mind just became too much of a hassle. 
---
What are the penalties for dishonorable kills?
---
Love that white Mechanostrider. I've never seen it before.
---
How else would a Paladin play the game? 
---
From beginning to to the end of your post, you gave me goose bumps!
---
When DM releases there is the timeworn mace [https://classicdb.ch/?item=18376](https://classicdb.ch/?item=18376). 
---
I never liked Thrash Blade for dungeon tanking, because normally you aren't hit capped when farming pre-Raid and missing a 2.7second swing can really mess things up. 
---
Don't think that will be possible, I would consider it myself though if it was :P but I feel you, assuming the population will be about 3kish on the servers ganking won't be that much of an issue, with that being said if it turns out to be 5-10k i'm playing on a PVE server. 
---
Community is 90% of the game. And tbh, sometimes looking at the private server forums (and this one) i worry a lot. But then i remember, when the game is launched, i dont have to think about these anymore. I can just play and let the toxic fucks around here argue all by themselves. 
---
- shaman gear not dropping for alliance and likewise paladin gear for horde
---
- rather than sharding, I’d much prefer dynamic spawns of mobs/quest items
---
- pre selecting talents in game option
---
- a long shot but a god damn flight point in northern stv 
---
Classic is all about uneven conflict. Differences in player level, gear, class power, professions, consumables, player skill, and racial abilities all come into play. Any handicap I give myself by way of racials I just have to make up for in skill and other areas.
---
I dunno if it is or isn't, I gave my opinion on it because I played shaman a lot in vanilla all those years ago and there's no way I'm subjecting my self to that pain of playing one again this time around. 
---
I would be really, really sad if I cant get the unarmored wolves anymore for my tauren. :(
---
I tanked ICC, Firelands and a few other raids in the day - I’m so close to rolling a Warrior as 2nd toon so I can get some primo-tanking goodness.
---
You can absolutely go full on retard turtle mode in 1.12 patch AV too.
---
There was a quest throughout vanilla which you could do to hand in your unarmored version and obtain the updated armored version.
---
If you didnt do it, you kept the unarmored version. Some select few people still rock the unarmored mounts in retail WoW BfA
---
No, nobody is because this Doesn’t get posted at least once a week.
---
Lmao, are you serious?... 
---
if Blizzard actually enables this.... no thanks.
---
No, vets were not a class in classic #nochanges 
---
&gt;  You act like one warrior with a Force Reactive Disk can hold AOE aggro vs. an entire raid of t2 geared mages and warlocks using blizzard/hellfire. 
---
Yes, Warriors with Engi Shield can hold aggro vs. an entire raid of T2 geared mages and warlocks. I did that every single time in MC, dozens of times.
---
Ah, yes, can't wait for the player housing patch.  Any day now...
---
What, are we catering to streamers exclusively now with design? Lol go away troll.
---
&gt;  I wouldn't even want to imagine the hell a streamer would go through if sharding didn't ake place b/c it takes less than 5 people to utterly decimate the questing experience.
---
*Oh no, not the streamers!*
---
Holy shitballs, what a fucking shitty argument, fuck off. 
---
Damn right, I'm triggered.
---
&gt;They only have 1.12 data
---
No they don't, their repo goes all the way back to the 90's
---
How so? World PvP still exists on PvE realms.  Go look at this video of my vanilla server back in the day when we were outnumbered by alliance:
---
https://youtu.be/l07tc2jafa4
---
The only difference is as we just talked about.  Ad hoc pvp and "fun" (subjective) griefing moments like mind controlling someone off cliffs are rarer but still happen.
---
Male Night elf on that mechanostrider is BIS
---
Yeees, give me my ivory raptor!
---
All of those things were added after launch, ALL of them impacted on the difficulty of current content.  Should we also add ZG at launch?  Should Naxx be available from launch because nobody will have the gear to clear it for a year?  You are literally trying to turn classic into a private realm.  
---
Dire Maul allows 40 people to use MASSIVE buffs, PVP offers BiS gear (for the whole game) for some classes, tier 0.5 is literally junk for almost anyone that has stepped foot in any raid content. If you want them all in from launch please explain why you are gating ANY content behind staggered releases.
---
Man, Druids are good tanks...but same tier as Warriors? 
---
I mean, even if you are biased toward Druids, you still have to admit that Warriors are superior to Druids for tanking. They just have to many advantages over a Druid.
---
Warriors are tier 1, Druids are tier 2 and Paladins are tier 3.
---
Shamans should not even be considered tanks...because they aren't.
---
&gt; pre selecting talents in game option
---
What, so it automatically selects the next talentpoint when you ding?
---
The Winterspring Frostsaber for Alliance remained unarmoured at epic level. One of the main reasons it was so cool compared with the armoured vendor ones.
---
Slow and steady wins the race in vanilla.
---
A tank's job is to **get aggro** and **mitigate damage** first and foremost. Dealing excess damage for a tank is a far, far *lower* *priority* than holding aggro and blocking damage. 
---
The best tanks to heal are ones that take damage slowly and steadily. That means blocking, parrying and dodging as much as possible, in addition to having high stamina and armor. 
---
I recently watched a guide on **dual wield tanking.** 
---
I know you CAN do this with the right gear and buffs, but i'm not really convinced you SHOULD. 
---
It seems to me that buffs such as a greater stone-shield potion would go much better in conjunction with a shield rather than as an effort to replace one.
---
Any extra volatility in the damage you take is going to absorb the healers attention, and that attention is usually always needed elsewhere, like healing AoE damage, moving out of hazards, crowd control etc. 
---
Getting through a dungeon with zero wipes is nearly always going to be faster than a 'slow' run. 
---
Were Taurne even allowed on wolves?
---
I think they could easily implement it, and I hope they do. It would fall pretty well in with their progression if they have unarmored mounts available before phase 2
---
&gt; Respec costs are fine either way. 50g respecs encourages hybrid specs and increases class/role identity. Lower respec costs encourage pvp. I can live with either.
---
A PvP spec active in BG's would be nice compromise I think.
---
Wait are you serious? Lol I was being sarcastic.
---
Torn between warrior and druid. Used to play paladin in Vanilla.
---
Want to roll a class that can tank, while two my friends roll a healer and caster dps. Raiding isn't that high of priority, probably going to be focusing on leveling, BGs and doing dungeons. 
---
Warrior leveling is a huge turn-off for me, while druid seems like a breeze and a lot of fun. Warrior tanking seems more interesting than bear tanking. All the utility spells as a druid beats warrior. Plate+weapons &gt; leather. Want to play dwarf, but have to play NE as druid. And so on.. I'm not sure I'll ever make my mind up. Any help is appreciated!   
---
I am torn between undead rogue and orc warrior. I played rogue from vanilla to bfa and enjoyed it the whole time but I can’t decide if I wanna stay with old reliable or move on to something new this time. 
---
you havent played retail AV versus russians i see. They let you cap everything so its only leader left then they get 600 kills and win the game (:
---
So even though no epic pvp gear will be available on launch do you think the blue 6 piece set will be available?
---
They didn't disappear, they just stopped being obtainable.  Players still have them today.
---
Don't die. I just did try the fabled lbrs from start to finish with a druid healer on pserver and it was fine.
---
&gt; Modern WoW could be fine if things didn't feel like an absolute waste of time when you lose
---
We're an extra step beyond fixing that now. Most content just became a "means to an end" during TBC/Wrath, where doing 90% of something was only marginally better than not bothering at all. Most of the content in the game since then has been a means to an end; a grind through content nobody really likes just for the reward at the end. 
---
But instead of fixing the "means to an end" philosophy, they kept it and simply removed the end. Now everything is a pointless grind towards a small reward that will never get you anywhere because all progression is meant to be an endless random treadmill with no agency. This happened in both PvE and PvP where a middle-tier currency became invalid or removed (honor points from anything other than winning BGs, badges to add deterministic rewards to PvE), control over your loot was removed (no arena vendors, no master loot) and a large amount of RNG is introduced to the system to make it that much more drawn out (PvP lootboxes, emissary lootboxes, mythic+ lootboxes, titanforging).
---
I'm the first person to want WoW back in that "journey, not destination" paradigm but they've made a very conscious decision over the years to first remove the journey, then remove the destination to create a spinning-wheels-in-mud simulator. 
---
I could definitely see that. I considered just having him start off on his own and joining in a dozen or so levels down the road to not make him feel dragged along. 
---
Aside from half your info is wrong, what's the point you're trying to make?
---
Joining the Horde comes with a free lifetime subscription to InfoWars.
---
Something tells me u wont enjoy questing a whole lot if u think totem quests are bad
---
Is that x-perl? I loved that UI addon.
---
It depends if you want to optimize your dps.
---
Ofc you can go with 10 shards, but getting shard on every mob is a dps loss
---
Can you un-spoiler that? You have to click each several times on mobile. 
---
At some point they were rather later in the expansion.
---
Tauren could then ride kodo and wolves. 
---
Raptors and undead mounts were always unridable however I think the R11 mounts could be ridden by all.
---
This thread needs more controversy.
---
I vote unarmored versions are available only from the WoW: Classic Collector's Edition.
---
Not to be the bad influence here but. FUCKING SEND IT BUD!  Get that new PC and have the ultimate vanilla experience!
---
This is only relevant to people with nothing going on in their life.
---
Kept in TOTAL radio silence, haven't released ANY information, not even one message? 
---
What is this nonsense? You clearly haven't been following the updates they've come out with recently which directly answers all your concerns. They've literally stated what they are working on, what they've accomplished thus far and what they prioritize moving forward, *and* given a firm indication that classic is to be expected this summer. 
---
Your hysteria is unwarranted.   
---
Do they use /spit or do you? Because if you are /spitting as you are bubble hearthing, your kinda just spitting inside your own bubble making a small pool of saliva at the bottom.
---
It was a joke that J. Allen Brack made when he announced Classic on stage at Blizzcon years ago. Right after the video of Chromie.
---
Speak for yourself!
---
I'am a huge PvP fan but "old AV" isn't something I or any of my friends want. Old AV was a fun occurence in the sense that it was broken. It is fun to talk about it in hindsight, but WoW PvE is already heavily grind focussed. When we queue for PvP we don't want that. We want a different fast paced experience.
---
The rebalanced AV is already extremely long. "New AV" can go on for 2+ hours easily. Play one or two and you fill a full evening, three or four and you fill a day.
---
If you want the real "epic" then organize city raids! Speak to the guild leaders of your faction, organize a date that is outside of most guilds raiding dates. Announce it to the opposing faction with in an RP-like/funny forum post. On the date ask/invite as many people as you can that are uninformed.
---
Then you will have the real WoW PvP epicness of a huge, chaotic PvP fest and it is all community based. Let BGs be something we can queue and plan for with a reasonable time-frame.
---
Indeed, in fact it is possible to tank as a pally earlier and earlier as we keep refining stat weighs/items. 
---
Players are resorting to impose challenges on themselves to keep it interesting like leap frogging threat to counteract taunt needed bosses. 
---
That was my first epic too! 
---
&gt;&gt; Would it be financially viable? Probably not.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; in the same note maybe it will be financially viable. if it's maybe then it goes both ways, right?
---
Yes, but not in a 50-50 way. 
---
Obviously you didn't raid when I said since the beginning that it's fine that they do what they want with raids, and make the phases longer if they want. But dealing with non raid content such as DM, T0.5 and PvP is a complete other matter.
---
Hardcore players won't see the difference with or without DM, as won't the other players exactly like in Vanilla when  ALMOST everyone had access to DM when level 60.
---
&gt;  If you want them all in from launch please explain why you are gating ANY content behind staggered releases. 
---
I've never said anything about putting anything at launch, did I? Just earlier in the phases, or make phase 2 happen rather 2-3 months after release than 3-5 months.
---
&gt; You want your classic experience over in a year? Even Nost followed an accurate time line, and now you asking for it to be shortened which is EXACTLY the reason wow has been dumbed down to its current state 
---
Yeah yeah "but but IT MUST BE LIKE IN PSERVERS REEEE" I hear that all the time. I know. Thanks for your input.
---
I saw the sarcasm, but I do legitimately believe streamers give a game presence and a illusion of life that makes a game feel more worthwhile to participate in. When there’s figureheads essentially broadcasting how much they’re enjoying the game, it I believe subtlety persuades people into also enjoying the game more than they may naturally. 
---
you can only gather a shard when a mob is on the last 1-2% health, WHY does raid dps matter on trash that is about to die?  You obviously dont play lock and dont understand how simple this is.  You can even send your shadow-bolt and cast drain soul while the bolt is in mid air and ZERO dps loss.
---
Right? Rogues 0.5 was the best in the game. 
---
An earlier version of AV would be perfectly acceptable.
---
Thats....actually a very good tactic.
---
Considering Orc Warlock as an option, but my biggest hangup is probably professions since cloth classes gain so much from tailoring. 
---
Something like a Rogue can go mining/engineering but im really not sure what to go with Tailoring. Not a fan of enchanting which is a common suggestion. 
---
Well the horde are trying to cut down my forest.
---
There isn't even a contest.
---
Classic will be vastly superior to private servers, in all aspects. There isn't a SINGLE aspect where private servers are doing it better. And even after the private servers will get all the data from Classic...they will still be worldwide servers AND will have to have 4-5 times the population of a Classic server, while still not providing permanency and customer support.
---
So...Classic will absolutely be a superior product.
---
You might think that 50k players on a server, with 8-10k concurrent players is superior...in reality it is not. You might think that a worldwide server is superior to a regional one...in reality it is not.
---
I played on both Blizzard's Vanilla and private servers "Vanilla".
---
Won't even touch the private servers once Classic is out. 
---
Warrior leveling is very hard, druid is amazing. Warrior max level is amazing, druid isn't nearly as good at anything as warrior. Can you handle spending 30-45 seconds missing autos and dying to NPC's one or two levels higher than you? If not, druid is probably going to be good for a starting main and mabye funnel weapons and gold to your warrior after you establish your druid.
---
This is a video game. You need to calm down.
---
TRYING THEY CHANGED IT LOL?
---
We have not been told how far apart the phases are yet still people are saying its too slow.....
---
I am not the one asking for Dire Maul at launch, even though it would benefit me as a mage more than ANY other class as my farming is reliant on the mage water.
---
PVP is ALWAYS available, however the rewards NEED to be gated because the 1.12 stats are literally AQ level.
---
Tier 0.5 I honestly dont care where that is on the schedule because the gear is junk for almost every class in every slot.
---
Got killed in popular camp spot on PvP server while ‘not paying attention.’ Complains about...something? 
---
The 4 set bonus on T0.5 is very strong for some classes. Looking at agility equivalency values for a rogue, full T1 is 302 MAEP while full T0.5 is 291. There's not much in it since the T0.5 set bonuses are weak for PVE. While you're replacing gear you have to remember that going from 6xT0 + 2xT1 to 5xT0 + 3xT1 is quite a nerf because you lose the 6set bonus of T0 and gain the mostly useless 3set bonus of T1.
---
I don't know how this is for other classes, but for rogues it's a catch up mechanic that helps you reduce the amount of DKP you need to spend since you can go from T0.5 &gt; T2 rather than T0 &gt; T1 &gt; T2. 
---
For PVP rogues who don't raid it's also very decent - 404 AEP compared to 343 AEP for the R10 PVP set and 331 AEP for T0. It sits halfway between R13 and R10 PVP sets.
---
Sure, the developers wanted an epic 40v40 battle which is why they made it. But then they realized it was a nightmare to balance l, which is why they slowly shifted it into what it became in 1.12. I'd much rather have the devs of Classic focus on other things than spending all their time trying to balance how old AV would work on the current downscale patch. Ever hear of the old gold farming strats in the mines where you could farm hundreds of gold doing nothing productive towards the battle? Now imagine 10 people on each side doing that instead of contributing. It's the little things like that that make me understand their decision.
---
Mojo so dope
---
I hope you're not able to do this. If you want to play PVP at 60, you should have to play PVP 1-59.
---
Why would you bother transferring to a pvp server when you are obviously not cut out for it. 
---
I have not played on private servers but I did play on alot of new vanilla servers in the good old days. From what i remember first couple of weeks  ganking was not really a problem most ppl wanted to level. Sure som wpvp happened but eaven if you lost a fight there where seldom corps camping and almost never more then a 10 level difference. After like 2 months or when you started to level an alt those 60 rogues started to appear 
---
You are thinking about the source code. They have all source code back to Warcraft 3 (or even earlier, don't know).
---
They explicitly said that they don't have earlier data (as in, models, textures, animations, databases for drop rates, spell values, etc.). Back in the day they only had two versions. The live one and the development one. Once they were satisfied with changes in the development version (like, for example, they changed Fireball damage from 100 to 200), they pushed it to live and that's it.
---
Sometime before they started on Classic, someone discovered a full set of 1.12 data in a "backup of a backup". That's when they knew they could create Classic. This was talked about at Blizzcon.
---
1.12 is vanilla too. If there is 1-5 different versions of a bg, THEY ALL ARE VANILLA LIKE. 
---
There is no way they can please everyone, so they have to pick one. Makes most sense to pick 1.12 as most of the data is based on it. Its literally least amount of work to get it going. Everything else needs development time.
---
you need god my friend
---
Interesting point of view, but in the end it's all about dps. Your tank helps the dps taking no dmg and have to move less and your healer keeps the tank alive ( or the dps ).  Tank and heal roles where developed after dps and many RPGs embedd these roles into your character through skills or equipment. 
---
Take common single player RPGs: you heal through pots and mitigate damage through dodging or blocking or absorbing or even kiting. But you need to KILL your enemys so in the end it's always about dps. These rules apply to solo questing too and that is why heal/tankspeccs only shine in group activity.
---
Can’t wait to incorporate everyone’s favorite memory of wow. I mean it won’t be classic but I’m sure it’ll be fun. 
---
They literally are giving us 1.13. Its named that. Every last bit of actual data they have is 1.12. To make it work with new datastructures, new client and new server versions everything must be rewritten. No data is being CHANGED, its made in format that the client can handle.
---
That takes time.
---
If you want to do ADDITIONAL changes to the data, that takes EXTRA time and EXTRA testing. 
---
If you have to shard to see people, then it's a factual statement to say his server is dead.  Please let me know if I'm missing something.
---
Idk. If they put it out for a short time, I would find it unfair to the people who don't have enough time to play.
---
Personally I would have one as prestige object in my bank and end up not using the kodo, since the newer epic kodos look just straight up badass.
---
If they always make them available on the classic wow annivasary, I would be down for that. It wouldn't leave anyone behind. 
---
It would be easier if you just google it. They can recharge mana in vanilla 
---
Not overly. There is for the opposite. Zip from Durotar, jump when your over land in Tirisfwal and Rez in Deathknell.
---
The best I can think of is probably a few strategic deaths that Tele you to a spirit healer where you can Rez, avoid the Rez sickness and skip some running.
---
What happened to #nochanges ? Justify a change, by doing additional changes ?
---
Jeesus fucking christ. This community doesnt DESERVE wow classic. 
---
Except these mounts still exist in the game, they just can’t be purchased. They can still be used and learned.
---
Surely multiboxing isn't allowed? If it is then fair play to you.
---
Personally I hope Blizz don't allow it, multiboxing totally cheapens the value of having a level 60 toon. 
---
It's not needed to clear content in the first place, it's needed to clear content in *timely fashion*.
---
backup raiders waiting for their turn to replace drop-outs
---
I know i fucking loved long AV's... when they felt new. After you saw a 48h AV once, if you got into one you just literally left the second you noticed it is a long one. And cursed the game to hell if the NEXT one you joined was the same one you just left.
---
AV battle royal event. 
---
Herbalism - gives you some income
---
I am no vanilla expert, I started in WotLK.. but I also wanted to go enchanting for classic but people told me it’s a big time and gold sink which doesn’t even become profitable unless you are in a guild as the dedicated enchanter who is gonna get fed the good raid recipes. Otherwise it is more worthwhile to just find an enchanter for your gear. Unless you truly have your heart set on it. That’s the beauty of vanilla, do what you like :D
---
Tailoring also pairs excellently with a gathering prof for gold, why not take mining for money as u level and then you can have all mats needed to level engineering for PvP at 60?
---
It'll take around a week or two for people with no life. I think the server first on the last realm got it in under six days, sleeping four hours a day and playing for 20 hours stopping for only food/water or using the bathroom for the toilet
---
Use shadowburn instead, or searing pain during the mid air SB.
---
You obviously didn't play lock in a HC guild, you don't understand that I'm talking about optimization.
---
I love old AV and wish it was in Classic but mostly I’m disappointed that tiger riding, raptor riding, etc isn’t in the game, tbh. 
---
"We will not be implementing sharding in anyway, ever. " - Blizz  
---
Until we see that, they are not listening.
---
lol they are way too difficult to gain for them to be catch up
---
they are meant as a goal for people who want to pve but not commit to 40man raiding
---
Forgive my ignorance but what is sharding?
---
What if you are a druid and you are teleporting between moonglade and your leveling area over and over? Your room will smell like six different things at once lol
---
No I never played in a heroic guild because I quit retail before heroics existed. I have however been raiding vanilla since beta
---
Not as hardcore as a fresh server. Sure some people might reroll for bloodelf or draenei. But overall people will have known each other and their guilds for over 2 years by then. Maybe even longer. 
---
I can't imagine leaving my ig friends behind for some better racials.
---
Fresh server, where you don't know anyone seems to be a very different situation.
---
cant do it, Only dwarf and gnome, even the pvp one you couldnt use. I do believe this was changed in Wrath.
---
Pre cataclysm Desolace. 💜
---
It’s fine just kill some Magram to contribute to a long fought civil war between tribes. 
---
Ahhh desolace the first zone I remember well. The feelings of hate for the Gelkis Centaur and amazement at how barren the landscape was.
---
Vanilla is not an expansion. Sorry I'm a grammar Nazi but it really grinds my gear.
---
I swear if my realm (frostmourne) ever appears for sale I'm buying it
---
Mmm...no...They would just announce BC is coming out soon, you get extra time to prepare a level 60 orc for the new xpac...You aren't going to worry about having a level 1 orc right at BC launch. You are also jumping the gun by two and a half years assuming BC rerelease is happening...
---
Sounds like a very good plan.
---
Haha oh god, don’t even. 🙈
---
Anyone feel free to correct me, but if i recall correctly you won't be able to buy them.
---
The blue pvp sets require a certain pvp rank first and foremost. You will be able to get the rank through world pvp as honor will be ingame from the start afaik, but you need the marks from the different bgs to buy the gear aswell. 
---
So no bgs = no bg marks = no pvp gear.
---
Torn between Hunter, Mage and Rogue. I played Mage during TBC which I really liked and played Rogue at BFA, but I think Rogue play style is much better in classic?
---
Also torn between trying out horde, but want that sweet Westfall / Deadmines nostalgia
---
I'd say put them in loot boxes you have to purchase. 
---
I disagree. I suspect two things would be true if the released a TBC Classic:
---
1. The population of both Classic and TBC would suffer due to splitting the player base of an already niche game. This would inevitably imbalance factions for both games.
---
2. Blizzard would never force Vanilla players to upgrade to TBC. They might allow a character copy, but they would create all-new realms to level BC characters on. 
---
Tanking in vanilla wow was one of the most satisfying and rewarding things. I remembered being able to do a 45 minute Baron run on my dwarf warrior tank who was proudly wearing a full suit of hard fought BiS solo player gear, with valor shoulders, lionheart helm and draconic defender, the works. The successful run earned me a good reputation on the server and a spot in a raiding guild where I got to experience some end game content for the first time.  
---
Healers are definitely more important in the PvP world, but I think the PvE world is the tanks kingdom  
---
yes you totally can, just need exalted reputation for it. 
---
I already have a beast gaming PC. When classic launches I’m going to buy myself a 35” ultra wide 1440 monitor. I have a 32” 1440p now for most games, but wow really shines on an ultra wide.
---
It is up in the air at this point. Would love to get me an Arctic wolf though.
---
Can paladins solo heal all 5 man dungeons?
---
Currently I'm at 53 with 10 days played. I haven't been on 'normal' xp since like level 40, I've been on 'rested' xp state since.
---
I don't do BGs or lot of owPvP (especially past STV nobody is doing that for some reason) I just do a lot of dungeon runs to do all the quests in an instance.
---
I never said they are not in the game. That's why I asked. (And were answered multiple times that they are separate from the later models and are in the 1.12 data. :)
---
So it's up to Blizzard to include them or not.
---
I mean a 200$ used PC will probably get you 60fps. The only worry I would have is the Mac overheating.
---
Was it possible to die let's say near Orgrimmar and run and resurrect at the graveyard in the Valley of Trials or would I get teleported to the primary death graveyard? I vaguely remember doing so in STV in Vanilla but it has been years.
---
I prefer owPvP over BGs anyday, everyday, on every MMO I've played (TERA also didn't have BGs initially and I loved it)
---
Make character -&gt; run to Zep -&gt; ??? -&gt; arrive in Durotar -&gt; Die -&gt; respawn at Spirit Resser in Razor Hill -&gt; Run to Valley of Trials.
---
Imo you should a few of the kill quests in Deathknell as those will be easy to complete at launch and if you do it you'll prob be level 3 close to 4 when you arrive in Valley of Trials, which will make the quests there easier.
---
Yeah, already had that slow leveling experience with my paladin, and the idea of Travel Form, heals, stealth and so on just seems so much more appealing. 
---
I'm probably only going to have time for one character, which why I'm so torn. Warrior might be the "better" class at max level, but the road there is so fucking long – while druid leveling just sounds fun
---
Oh yes, it would be so nice to see. I absolutely love NE unarmored mounts!
---
Kevin wants it back.
---
Not to mention the open world dungeon that troll temple is, filled with elites. With 5 people (one being an overleveled pally tank) we steamrolled the place a week ago but it still felt awesome.
---
Thats the point
---
It's cross straps for casters, they don't need eyes the feel the mana flow. Glow eyes for rogues.
---
Laptop and gaming is horrible for your posture.
---
At my age it needs to be super comfy. 
---
I want to lean back and enjoy and not have back pains when I stand up. 
---
That would be lame. IMO
---
Definitely recommend leveling a character each to 15 or 20 on a private server, it'll take a few hours extra but getting a warrior to level 40 will take days and it makes the opportunity cost of being like holy fuck dude I can't handle this
---
...another 20 levels to go? ya thats another week of /played lol
---
Yeah after a while it's hard to touch the keys
---
That's why I need a comfy maybe not gaming chair but a good office chair
---
Thats massive!
---
daium I wish I still had my first screenshot :) was in the swamp of sorrows after buying a full grey plate set (!!!) from one of the orc vendors - I thought I found some kind of OP loophole in the game and walked around like a god haha
---
I JUST MISSED AGAIN
---
THESE FUCKING CONEHEADS
---
I don't really think they sell for that, but the only one at ebay at the moment is listed at 4.000 pound ..
---
Are you retarded?  Did you even read what I said?  Clearly not.  And clearly your opinion is unpopular due to you being downvoted into oblivion.  But hey, keep using the "laughing/crying" emoji like some 43 year old soccer mom.  It suits you.
---
I feel like 5 druid tanks could handle BRD pretty well. They do more dps than warriors and have the ability to pre-rejuv/regrowth before the pull.
---
thanks, my dude
---
Raiding isn't about it being hard or easy though, it's about comitting the time. Adding catch-up gear in the start would be beyond stupid which is why they aren't doing it.
---
Yeh its the only one I've seen for sale in a long time but id probably pay that for frostmourne 
---
Pretending this stuff is clear cut and not open for discussion within the realm of vanilla patches is what is messed up. 1.12 is in no way some ultimate best pure breed version of vanilla.
---
This whole circlejerk about a perfect copy 1.12 being the only option is absolute horseshit.
---
Has no one told you? Disagreeing with someone and backing up that disagreement with examples and sources is borderline assault.
---
My man! Sounds like a Chicago raid
---
You're not wrong at all. :)
---
I would actually go as far to say that Retail WoW plays more like a single player game with minor grouping options.
---
I consider getting to lvl 4 before embarking to Durotar. I might get even lvl from discovered zones. I want to get as much troll reputation as possible as my aim is a raptor by a level 60 (giver or take 2 months for gold grind).
---
Ugh, I wish I had a good taco place around here. Taco bell isn't taco's.
---
We have a couple sub places there one that makes a pretty good one, but nothing that makes me want to go out of my way for it. I feel like Dallas probably has a lot of burger, and steak places, because ya know texas. 
---
I was half serious in this post but now I am definitely going to look into this! Thanks for tbis response and research.
---
Classic is going to be very memorable!
---
The last sentence sums it up.
---
Alliance are holier than thou assholes while the horde with have a very troubling past, are just trying to survive.
---
We all have different opinions and like different games.
---
I want to play Vanilla and you want to play something different.
---
Blizzard haven't exactly proven to be reliable in recent years.
---
AV?
---
This shit was pre raid BiS for Fury/Hunters/Rets.
---
I farmed it like ..forever on my warrior and never got it :(
---
Ah... that was my server. So you're the one who got it. Gratz
---
I'm undecided between troll priest or troll shaman. I know I want to play a healer but I'm unsure which is more fun for a new/casual player. Priest seems more straightforward while shaman a lot more intricate with regards to two sets of gear (one for leveling, one for healing), totems, and so on. Basically, more intimidating for a new player. I want to be able to find groups fast and not compete with too many people for loot. A fun leveling experience with lots of quests, dungeons and PVP is the main priority.
---
After being so certain on being a mage for so long and only now coming to terms with just how many mages there are and that leveling one *just* to make a *real* main is stupid I have decided to just play the thing I wanted to play and haven't played before. 
---
Paladin, my only question are what are my ways of making gold beside from mining/herbs as I plan to be healbotting for a good while at 60
---
There will be a "Classic" button in graphics settings which puts all the settings to what was maximum in vanilla. 
---
Some people need a daily blue thread saying "hey, release date is still next summer"
---
Should have sold it!
---
Why the downvotes? I have nothing to gain here, just enjoy the writing and helping Dutch players whose English might not be the best. 
---
Just curious, so I can change what it is you don't like.
---
Fishing the rare fish for alch recipes. I remember oily black mouth bringing in lots of gold.
---
There are very good pieces for more casual players who cant reliably raid BWL+ or rank to rank 12+.
---
For example Heroism chestplate [https://classicdb.ch/?item=21997](https://classicdb.ch/?item=21997) is not much worse than R13 chestplate [https://classicdb.ch/?item=16477](https://classicdb.ch/?item=16477).
---
The materials cost about 600-1000g, but that late in the server progression all classes can farm 50g/hour reliably, therefore the monetary impact isnt too much.
---
The whole quest chain is 25quests long and I needed about a week for all to finish. You could probably do it 3-4 days if you strategically buy ingredients beforehand.
---
Here you can indulge yourself in the questchain: [https://classicdb.ch/?quest=8926](https://classicdb.ch/?quest=8926)
---
Most parts are indentical for all classes, only a select few like killing certain bosses in dungeons are different between classes.
---
Most people didn't even get to experience AV in vanilla as it was a higher level bg so I doubt many people (though there are some) are connecting AV with their vanilla experience. 
---
I believe paladins can solo heal anything.
---
Was gonna hope so, bc I'm loving the face that for the first time ever I'm playing maxed out and I feel good.
---
Kinda happy about it to be honest. On private servers AV doesn't get played outside of the AV BG weekend because most people hate it. I may be wrong but it seems likely that the majority of people would prefer the old version of AV.
---
It was changed for a reason. The forums were full of endless complaints saying how bad AV was.
---
I'll try to find one but if you are familiar with AV basically instead of the horde team keeping to their right and going up their choke point thru the tight valley like blizz intended, they go far far left in the snowy edge of the map where some harpies are, ride their mounts up high onto a little rock and then make a very easy jump that lands them behind those alliance turn-in locations right next to alliance graveyard. Completely skipping the choke and getting a free graveyard cap with zero effort since the only alliance npc's they run into are those weak turn in ones and totally skip the towers.
---
Arguably the audience that actually wants this is even the 0.1% of all the people who want classic...
---
This still isn't the AV we have today. It still takes quite a bit of time to finish the AV but you're actually able to do so. Anything other than 1.12 AV would be ridiculous.
---
&gt; . 1.12 is one of the minority of patches where they were only useful as healers. 
---
Yes and Classic will forever be based on 1.12.1.
---
I actually went back and tried BFA (big mistake, its shite), however I must confess that bots were no longer an issue. That's one thing they do seem to have got on top of.
---
Old AV is apparently perfectly rushable. 
---
Lower level mobs with good drops like cloth and other auctionable items. Have high armore, a good shield, and lay down you aoe, think it’s called consecration.
---
If you really want me to disappoint you. I think I got it on my first or second run. I went nuts because I hadn't ever seen an epic drop before.
---
But that's not going to happen. Stats of items will be at their 1.12 values from release. Only thing that is progressive is when they are released. 
---
It was? I literally did nothing but ride around and herb. It was a super efficient farming method if you had mount speed enchants.
---
😂... Soon baby, soon!
---
That attitude is the reason why retail is the way it is 
---
Yeah I will be gathering for sure, but I was looking for a more braindead grind some mobs type of deal like are there some undead mobs that drop good silver in a dungeon I can aoe down ect ect 
---
I remember pally groups for strat in the day but I was never sure if it was for getting money or mats or just for the fun of it, or if it can be done solo.
---
&gt; This is the true authentic vanilla experience. I want day(s) long epic AVs
---
NO ITS NOT. This is an experience that very few people actually endured. I have played Retail Vanilla since the very beginning. I've done all the shit and those Alteracs were no fun at all. You had no impact. It was nothing but a stalemate. In the end, you've wasted your time.
---
Surely just doing "PvP" for such a long time can be fun - not denying that - but I'd much rather have them last an hour or so (aside from the cheese tactics) rather than days. 
---
I’ve been locked in since day 1. Warrior Tank, and Frost/Fire Mage. My girlfriend has never played but says she wants to heal since she loves healing in OW.
---
You can easily get that in 1.12 av just talk your friends into defending whit most of the raid
---
&gt;You are literally trying to turn classic into a private realm.
---
You are LITERALLY putting words into his mouth. 
---
I really hope rolls show up in Classic, instead of how it is in the demo which is closer to Retail: only showing the end result.
---
These sorts of screenshots and memories are made possibly by seeing everyone's roll.
---
Didn't it work like it does now? You have to burn the towers or the boss is to strong. 
---
It was fun and epic. But the problem is, if it is the only thing, it soon turns into boring game. Even the new AV quite often turns into a standstill. But instead of it taking 2 days to win or lose the game, it takes only 2-4 hours.
---
I used to hate the battleground patch, becouse to me it felt like it killed the world pvp. Well, didnt kill it but close to, TM raids and so on happened for fun now, not daily because people were more interested in killing people in BG's for honor instead of joining a city zerg that ends up in a lot off DK's.
---
They’re rolling changes out over a long period of time. I assumed BGs would go at the same pace or they’d implement them at a mid-point 
---
Skinning perhaps? Money maker and also some tailoring recipes use leather every now and again 
---
Think there are video tutorials on aoe grinding lower level mobs as a paladin.
---
There are quite a few sets or items that would mak 0.5 mandatory for either PvE or PvP. Helm is as good as BWL endless rage one for warrior, chest is nearly as good as R13 chest, boots are as good as slime kickers (which are only slightly worse than BWL Chromaggus boots).
---
The gear is not only catchup gear, it is REALLY good and you would be expected to farm it would be available from the start.
---
That completely beats the purpose and utterly takes away what makes them special.
---
Its a totally different game in Vanilla. If someone is a loot ninja. They very quickly get blacklisted and can no longer join groups, raid and even some guilds. Back in the day, there was a guy who was just plain trolling in Zul Farak, I added him to my black list. About 2 months later the guy was begging to join a raid I was in, and we wouldn't allow him because of his bad reputation. That one instance of him screwing with people in instances, ruined his future progression and end game, everybody knew not to invite him to groups / raids / guilds. I dare say the old system works better than the new loot system.
---
Can someone help me choose warlock over mage?  Or the other way around as well?
---
From my experience playing Vanilla as a terrible warrior trying to tank (people would beg me and insist that they could prop me up long enough to clear dungeons), getting the drops is the hardest part.  You can buy the bracers and belt off AH (they are BoE), but everything else is a drop from a dungeon boss.  Dungeons now take 15 or 20 minutes (30 minutes if your group is slow), but the classic Dungeons such as BRD took HOURS.  A blisteringly fast run through UD strat takes less than 45 minutes....my point is that the difficulty of obtaining your dungeon set resides in how much time and effort it takes for you to slog through the dungeons.  If you get a group of friends to play with regularly it's going to be pretty doable.  If you have to PUG every group, it's going to be a very tough grind.
---
After having played on and off since then, I plan on tanking again (hopefully less horribly), which will make groups easier to join, thus expediting the process as much as possible.
---
Takes about a week to farm all and costs 600-800g on average. It really is no feat of strength to do some dungeons later in the progression and piss away some gold. 
---
Wow, are there any more items like this that need some work but perfectly obtainable without a serious raid environment and comparable to better PvP gear?
---
I certainly won't be able to hit R13 lol, maybe R10 max.
---
Asking for dire maul and pvp from launch is a private realms thing. Didn’t happen on retail 
---
I dont have anything against it. However, I assume people would prefer this community to be as inclusive as possible. Meaning no one would want me to start making separate posts in swedish, someone else in russian etc.. 
---
Unfortunately I get the feeling that the caustic internet behavior that has stewed for the last 15 years along with the sense of smugness and self-assurance that will stem from most old school players will have distilled into a toxic sludge that will unfortunately rear it's ugly head in Classic when it launches.
---
In short, I feel like even with forced interaction, no dungeon finder, smaller realms and no cross-server realm play for dungeons and raids people will still act like entitled assholes and things like saying "Thank you!" and "good group! Catch ya guys later!" will be rarities.
---
The quests themselves can be done in that time, but you still need the drops from dungeon bosses first.
---
Gotta say I agree with Dwight here, and not the balding guy.
---
Fact: 1.12 is the definitive version of Warcraft.
---
Why arw you talking about patches and hyvrid viabliloty etc?
---
You made a post named "what do you plan to give your hybrids in exchange for playing a role they do not want to play?".
---
What does that have to do with retail, balance or anything?
---
WE KNOW THINGS. Classic will be baded on 1.12.1 just as private servers. So what are you talking about? Who cares what was viable in 1.1 and why do you make such an absurd comment like healers arw forced to play something they don't want to play and feel entitled to anything?
---
Well, it's a mix of aoe grinding with consecration and healing yourself while doing so. When diremaul releases you can do the famous grind where you kill the lashes(I think thats how they're called) and earn some super easy gold. 
---
Damn, looks like you're right. I could have sworn it was late vanilla, but it was early BC (or the BC patch in vanilla, which is the same thing).
---
That was in TBC and not in Vanilla
---
You should be stopping to drink anytime combat drops anyway.
---
Because Ray Rice hasn't gotten to them yet.
---
I don't think it was wierd at all.  You saw a good BoE Epic that was an upgrade.  You asked for it nicely as an upgrade. And you equipped it.  This seems like pretty normal behavior to me (for back in the day.)  These are the type of interactions that were common back then.
---
Nowadays everyone in these forums seems to think that someone in your position would say you were going to equip it, but then run off and sell it.  It's almost like people think the world randomly turned into a bunch of assholes.  (I mean they aren't necessarily wrong, if you look at this sub-reddit alone, if I had to group with 90% of the people here I wouldn't trust them further than I could throw them. )
---
Sadly no. This was the 1.12.1 post nerf version. 
---
If you die near Orgrimmar, you'll res near Orgrimmar.
---
They've said (not that they can't change their minds) that as long as there's a wow, there will be a classic.
---
That said, if classic brings in only $3mil then I doubt they would do anything but keep the lights on so to speak. If it started bringing in billions, and people were asking for more granular updates bringing it closer to the vanilla cycle, they very well could decide it's worth the time and effort.
---
AV is just for getting rep &amp; gear. PvP just gets in the way.  WoW pvp is terrible anyway you can tell it was added as an afterthought.
---
If you want a low time investment to be PvP viable go Hunter.
---
First off this is almost all pvp related, second I haven't exactly had great luck with these threads so in gonna ask some more in depth questions hopefully somebody who has more recent experience can help me out.
---
How do you even attempt to finance consumables on warrior horde side, seems like if you don't have a pocket dispeller you want to be chugging FAP nearly on CD, seems like it would the only way of making warrior viable without a healbot/dispel. Jump runs won't be in at release and nearly nobody will have the gold to pay for tanks for awhile. Other than traditional gathering/ah games do you have any solo farming opportunities?
---
As a mage, what options do have against a fap melee class or freedommed one, grenade into poly and hope nobody dispels him ? Or a feral druid?
---
&gt;has a MacBook
---
Oof.
---
That being said, all indications are that Classic WoW will be very easy to run. But since Macs have different APIs you can have a different experience.
---
People have made many comparisons and have seen that the demo client is even easier to run than 1.12. So if you can run actual Vanilla (playing on a pserver) fine then you should be able to play Classic on the MacBook no problem.
---
I would say hard pass but I plan to be a warlock so I dont feel I should make that call.
---
Yeah all the comments were saying stuff like consecration was working off attack power on those servers and stuff like that so I was unsure about those.
---
God gave you a non viable Ret tree
---
If you can obtain them until stage 2, it's not unfair to anyone. Should rank13 gear not be in the game because it's only for the people who can play 10+ hours a day for weeks in a row? 
---
I just recently bought the HP Omen 15" 
---
I'm in the same boat as you. I do not have space for a tower. So had to be a laptop. And after searching within my budget the HP Omen really came out best for me. 
---
I got to say, I'm really happy with it. So far it really performs very well. Much better then playing via a mackbook.
---
"Alright, 48 in vent, looks like we're ready to go. Lockdoc, let's start summoning."
---
"Lockdoc, let's summon."
---
"God dammit, someone get Lockdoc in vent.  How do we have 48 in vent, but Lockdoc isn't one of them?"
---
Fair enough! 
---
But from my experience (only pserver though as I only did a few t0,5 pieces back then), not many are interested in the items. Therefore just by farming preRaid BiS, you can obtain most items easily. 
---
For example pants are baron rivendare, chest is Drakkisath, boots are gargoyle in Scholo, shoulders are Rend which you will do 20times easily in various setups for warrior gear. 
---
Then you can buy 3 of the t0,5 pieces as they are  BoE. It's not too bad and not comparable to say t1 or full t2 which can take months of raiding.
---
Apex FortWoW
---
You’re not the only person, but you’re in the minority
---
What the fuck is the point of that comment? 
---
Let the tank die if they refuse to wait for you to get mana. They learn real quick after that trust me.
---
Well, the irony is that Priests were actually pretty much the closer thing you had to a clinical psychologist back in time. Which is far far away though.
---
I am sure it will run swiftly on my macbook pro BUT, what if I cancel my pyroblast cast with ESC? There is no ESC button mate it just stupid touch bar
---
No, basically giving you the option to confirm your talents before they’re set (believe this was used in wrath, not sure about tbc)
---
I dont remember that playstyle existing back then. Or if it was even possible.
---
I see it on those new class guides along with totem kiting/swing timer stuff.
---
If people were doing it in '05 they were way ahead of the curve
---
&gt; backup raiders waiting for their turn to replace drop-outs
---
Hate to be critical, but if its 41, and 40 man raid, it should be "backup raider", 1 does not warrant the plural.
---
It was a troll anyway ;)
---
Are you going to get any additional keyboard? My macbook pro has touch bar it's not possible use F keys and ESC
---
Same video posted at least once or twice yesterday. These are premade teams with some pretty sweet gear. Not saying the games won't be fast but this is fairly misleading.
---
And there goes my brilliant idea :)
---
I hope the webpage I'm about to post is not forbidden:
---
[https://legacyplayers.com/Armory/?charid=534318](https://legacyplayers.com/Armory/?charid=534318)
---
This was a warrior equipped with 100% crafted/pug raid gear. 
---
As you can see he only has AQ20, MC, ZG gear but he could hold his own very well. 
---
I had Zin'Rokh for 2hander and did well enough. Abit too much hit on this character in this gear though.
---
You are correct with them being BoE, buy a few and sell them for bulk come AQ however they can only be ridden by Dwarves and Gnomes.
---
In short: it became a rush to zerg the enemy boss. Alliance and Horde would literally run past each other and ignore any PvP just to get to the other team’s boss quicker
---
Streamers can't really play on a PVP server. So that's another great reason to play on PVP servers.
---
Based on your username, not only do I recommend being a lock, but you should prolly pick a gnomes as well. Locks will be played less than mages and they're easier to level
---
Take your updoot you filthy animal.
---
Diremaul was nearly at launch in europe. If you count the time it took for ppl to make it to L60. So for ~half of the wow population, it actually was there. In retail vanilla wow.
---
It the party chat that makes me smile.
---
Can't wait!
---
&gt; Remember, if you ever wanna see a TBC/WOTLK server, classic has to be successful first
---
Not necessarily. If classic failed and people made TBC/WRATH private servers, and they got so popular that blizzard had them shut down, there could possibly be a ground swell campaign that made blizzard make classic TBC/WRATH servers 12 years later.
---
Hype is driving me crazyyy
---
Been to Holland 5 times. I know all you guys speak better English than Americans!
---
Not really when they said they’re going to stagger patch content
---
Zerging wasn’t feasible until the changes were made
---
yeah 3 are boe and if you are lucky you can get the rest quick
---
some will roll for the items tho cuz they dont have class restrictions and they are decent for others
---
Exactly, and you don't decide that, the other faction does.
---
That.
---
No, retail is the way it is because the attitude of “I can’t hit 60 in a month, make it so I can.”
---
This guy is just saying “I can’t hit 60 in a month, I need more time.”
---
Which patch were archers removed in?
---
Agreed. This entire post is moot if they release AV in a later phase (like 4,5, or 6)
---
No reason to do it. Your MacBook has probably better CPU and GPU than pretty much all the computers on the market from 15 years back. That's how fast technology is going. It won't hold you down. If you want to have more fun and a sense of upgrading, just buy yourself a big monitor and a good keyboard. The computer will be fine.
---
14 years ago I didn't really grasp that a non-set piece of armor could be better than anything specifically designed for a class set.  I never heard the term "Best in Slot" until TBC.  I was mostly concerned with the prestige of owning a whole set of something (which I never got even close to in vanilla btw).  This time around it will be different.  I won't care what my character looks like, and I'll mismatch armor types to get as close to my BiS list as possible (pre-raid is where I'll end up most likely).  I feel like public opinion has shifted too.  People are going to be less impressed by a full set of mediocre gear, and will likely be more impressed by a carefully accumulated amalgamation of armor types for min-maxing.  
---
The need for Marks from AV didn't help it's cause really
---
Look if your new or just not very good just roll alliance its that simple
---
1.12 av lasted one day less than 1.8. Longer if you basically realize they used almost the same AV a few patches into BC.
---
So stop with this spirit of vanilla bs. I played in those days. The ONLY reason AVs lasted long was because players were bad.
---
You can Zerg every implementation of AV.
---
Also you people are forgetting 1.12 still has all the boss summons and everything.
---
Ofc they should be in. Literally doesnt require any coding from them, just change the sold mounts from vendors on later stage.
---
OK so I investigated this item specifically; it looks like in patch 1.5 they fixed these gloves to also give the bonus attack power against undead as ranged attack power, that's why my tool detected it as a change. They added another aura to this effect 'Equip: +30 Attack Power when fighting Undead.' that basically says 'also give 30 ranged attack power'. I could filter out these hidden aura changes/additions as they don't really affect the tooltip. When they do affect the tooltip the effect description also changes and that's a real change.
---
hey guys i found this video of a guild with naxx on farm using this meme spec so it must be viable right?
---
In vanilla? A decent bit. With today’s players and meta almost nothing. Zerging, no matter which, AV is the prime strategy.
---
This is what people don’t realize.
---
For those saying "its a catch-up mechanic"...
---
...wrong. It takes more effort than buying boe drops and only 1-2items on very specific classes are noteworthy.
---
This is true of ALL AVs stop spreading this nonsense bs. AV lasted so long because of bad players and the meta. All versions of AV can be zerged.
---
I guess? The whole post is about the good times back in WoW in a game that forced you to group with others, rather than use a streamlined matchmaking system where you need to actively break other players out of their shell—because gaming has truly become a drool-based activity where you sit in front of your tv and nobody talks. 
---
I didnt want to go into the state of gaming in the post, keep it light, but I was alluding to WoW’s unique ability to bring people together. Modern games don’t even come with text chat on PC unless the company devotes serious resources to text-to-speech. It’s just too bad. 
---
To his point, no, you cannot replicate that experience of a tight knot guild from WoW who spend a lot of nights just hanging out over voice comms. I’ve joined guilds in modern games, belong to several discord servers, and it just isn’t the same. 
---
The only replication I’ve seen is the private server scene. So yeah, I don’t really think his comment addresses my post, it just comes off dickish and uninformed.
---
I approve of cross realm AVs where I don't know anyone - with a constant stream of low level people and bad gear the AVs will not be 5min games so I'm expecting a ton of combat in there until at least halfway through the release of BWL. The rest of the time I'll be playing with people I know in AB/WSG premades, where individual skill and synergy with other players actually means something.
---
Classes that I consider playin: Hunter, Mage, Rogue.  
---
So I've usually played Hunter, and was certain that's what I wanted to pick, however now I'm unsure. I've read (too much) regarding the negatives around min-maxing and whatever, and realise that I don't really care about those things. So I'm going into the game purely to enjoy the different aspects of the journey.  
---
I'd like to be able to
---
* Do PvP decently, especially solo - BG's, World PvP (also while leveling). I don't care that much about Arena, but thats a bonus
---
* Be able to do PvE - Dungeons (5mans). Don't care that much about raiding, but considering everyone say Hunters are absolutely shit in raids I'm on the fence to choose Mage/Rogue instead of Hunter because if I do get to the point and choose to do raiding as well I'd like to be able to do it. Nothing hardcore, just clearing some content in a laidback manner.
---
* Be decent at farming gold - I enjoy grinding mobs, do runs for hours is simply relaxing and fun. So I want to be able to solo-farm gold alright. Heard all three classes are decent at this. What's the difference here?  
---
Are there any other classes that fits these requirements that I should consider? Spriest? Warlock? My plan is to just play casually and enjoy the game, take my time. So a few dungeons, BG's and World PvP and being able to farm gold decently. Appreciate all and any response.
---
The whole reason why people want these mounts today is because they're rare. The models themselves aren't anything special. If everyone has these in classic, what's the point then?
---
I had me unarmored Kodo on Nost before they implemented  armored epic mounts. I'm glad I was able to take the opportunity to get it, but objectively it's an underwhelming mount, imo. As a player, I don't notice other players' mounts unless they stand out somehow and the unarmored mounts don't do that. It's like having a $100k Honda Accord. Everybody sees you driving an average car without realizing that there's anything remarkable about it.
---
I’ll give you a pass :) the “if you really miss having friends” bit came off a bit dickish, though. 
---
Depends on the guild and the raid and how many consumables you're expected to have. I'd say like 8 hours a week of farming for progression in a semi serious guild.
---
A billion brazilians?
---
So, the retail mentality. Everyone gets everything for doing nothing. Unless i misunderstood you
---
Seeing the Zulian defender perfectly upright on that Taruen's back makes me want to vomit. 
---
Why did they ever change it to that from its awesome sideways model.
---
Played a bit on a p.server a few months ago to scratch that vanilla itch and what I have experienced there, about the 90%of the groups were friendly. There will be always some assholes 
---
Well to be fair, the post itself is in English.. But I get what you're saying, thanks.
---
If you're locked, what's the question ? What healer should your gf play ?   
---
If that's what you're asking, she should play a priest. It's got everything a healer would ever want and a (more-viable-than-other-hybrids) dps spec.
---
Shit gear hunter can always viper sting for the lulz and with good positioning can make or break a teamfight. Mage always has insane cc though.
---
Yep but you will have to create a US bnet account
---
AV might not be in the game at launch. It's likely that the Argent Dawn vendor will be the only source of high level refreshment.
---
Technically as stated by Blizzard phase 1 consists of content from patches 1.0-1.2 inclusive; patch 1.4 is phase 2 (1.3-1.4). Still remains to be seen how they're going to handle that, but for now I'm going by the patch numbers as they indicated.
---
&gt;How about you try it out first when the time comes, then speak your mind.
---
Have you been paying attention to retail recently? BfA has had absolutely massive problems with design problems that get left too late to fix, then never get changed at all.
---
If AV makes it to Classic - even in beta - in its 1.12 state, I guarantee that it’ll be too late to change it. Right now is *exactly* the time for people to be loud about what they want. The “wait and see” approach is not a realistic way to provide high-impact input.
---
I'm guessing that when the server is live, it will be full for like the first week or so until people see the time sink of it and go back to current servers. That's when I will start on classic. imo
---
Yes :) You can also roll on an RP server where you know people won’t be toxic, i’m not committed to that level of WoW yet, though
---
Those items can “titanforge” and they can have +43 shadow damage when another item with the same name could only have +20 shadow damage. I don’t think you can use a database for that. 
---
Ask Blizzard IF you can change your account status to NA after you move maybe
---
what Horde racials are so crucial?
---
Pretty nice build you made with just those items imo.
---
I think Priest is the best fit for you, in vanilla I leveled as shadow and switched to holy at 60, it was a smooth and easy experience. I was undead, so their racial that cleared Fear was amazing for PvP, and cannibalize helped save mana so that grinding had minimal interruptions. I leveled tailoring just to get mooncloth and made decent money, enchanting was an initial money sink but I made plenty of money at 60, especially after getting the raid recipes for weapon enchants. Plus, the priest spells of mind control, mind vision, and dispell are incredible in PvP, so there's plenty of challenge should you want. I will type more later, but feel free to ask me any priest questions. I'm also looking for a guild of parents that finish their casual raids by 10:30 EST!
---
Can confirm. Ice Barbed Spear and similar items were a “Win a game” quest.
---
"well produced"
---
They were in 1.12 so eventually they should come. Also, weren't they in the capitals only during weekends? I think that was a pretty cool aspect.
---
* Was the clock-alarm in Vanilla? That was convenient 
---
* It would kill the immersion for true newbies, but since it’s a 15 year old game, I wouldn’t mind the Dungeon Journal being available. 
---
No real point in rushing leveling to be honest. So waiting a week for the main rush to die down is a good idea.
---
Sometimes I feel like the only one that looks at Vanilla WoW for the entirety of it's existence. There are so many loud people who are either ignorant or are blinded by their private servers it's hard to talk about the game as a whole and not one static point over a 2+ year experience.
---
There's a lot of people saying "Blizzard said this, we wanted 1.12, this is what you get". I understand the literal sense, but the true answer is deeper. Vanilla was great as a sum of it's parts. Most people, regardless of patch, refer back to AV as the long hard fought battles that lasted hours or in the rare occasions days.
---
Blizzard has said they more or less are creating Classic as preservation of what once was. Memories of people are not accurate at the final patch format of the game. Yes I completely agree it's the best starting point, but something like AV should be easy enough to preserve how people remember it and not what's the easiest way to implment it.
---
I find it amusing how Blizzard has shown they're going to do progressive releases with dungeons even in mind, and are still discussing Bags where it could be reasonable to expect the same thing. And yet, we'll end up with the end of expansion AV that no one reminisces about.
---
I may have a strong opinion on this last part, but the people who are adamently against 1.5 AV either want their sugar coated version of Vanilla or were beholden to the ways of private servers. To a far lesser extent the ease of 1.12 makes some pretty exceptional gear far too easy to obtain. At least in earlier forms there was some added difficulty.
---
Dungeons used to be 15 man and even then rarely cleared.
---
And yes, Blizzard had to lower / nurf the dungeons to the point where the only time they were a 'challenge' was if you were in a bad group.
---
For healers and others, pvp gear wasn't easy to get prepatch.
---
Your own ass lips are moving.
---
More guilds cleared MC after the release of DM and it's gear and buffs, sweet lips.
---
Do you intend to PvP ?   
---
If you answered yes, then pick mage for Alliance, orc warlock for Horde. Stuns are a big thing for warlocks, and the orc racial is insane.   
---
If you don't pvp or don't care for racials,
---
Soloability: Mage for groups and slowable rares/elites, Warlocks for rares/elites.  
---
End-game viability: Both are great and needed in any group, dungeon or raid, you'll find a spot as any.  
---
Numbers: Mages pull out bigger numbers until later in the game, where Warlocks I think get a slight lead.  
---
Fantasy: Student of the arcane, or someone who wants more, and ignores the rules imposed by the kirin tor.  
---
Playstyle: Mage is the rogue of casters and warlock is the warrior. Mage is mobile, quick, all about kiting and outwitting. Warlock is defensive, immobile, all about controlling and outlasting.   
---
Fun: Subjective, I find warlock a lot more fun to play. If you're into suffering, you can drop infernals in Goldshire/Deathknell and see the crowd go wild.  
---
QoL: Mages are pretty much cheating when it comes to QoL. It's almost absurd how easy they have it. Warlocks get a free mount at 40 and a cool model at 60 if you're into that.  
---
15-man Strath, Scholo, LBRS and UBRS.
---
Yeah, and those groups would fail.
---
Nurf those dungeons as well as some of the other lower ones, add in a new dungeon with instant blue gear for a one-time run-through, and give a way for the entire raid to receive a buff prior to entering MC.
---
Yeah.  You weren't there, that's pretty evident.
---
&gt;titanforge
---
My initial reaction was "bruh wrong sub."
---
Removing dishonorable kills would be the #1 for me to get the average Joe to join city raids.
---
&gt; Aside from half your info is wrong 
---
Failed to mention any of my points and how they are wrong, a common theme with people who tend to pull shit out of their ass.
---
&gt; It's not like they are programming a new game 
---
They are writing code in the modern engine that can interpret old assets, the new engine is extremely different from 1.12's engine, there is an insane amount of shovelwork to do.
---
&gt; what's the point you're trying to make? 
---
That alot of gamers are entitled as fuck and don't know how difficult it is to port a completely different version of the game to a modern engine
---
&gt; 90% was already done 
---
I'd like to see where you've gotten this percentage, if that were the case beta would probably have dropped by mid january.
---
And along with DM came the new gear, the easy "entire raid" buff availability for those of you who couldn't figure out how to get all of Rag's sons down -- those were nurfed as well.
---
Items with specific suffixes don't really exists. They are a combination of the base item + the suffix stats based on the level of the item. You can find the base item and it's gonna say on the item (random bonuses) like this  [http://classicdb.ch/?item=9942](http://classicdb.ch/?item=9942)  but that's kinda useless. I've never seen a spreedsheet for the stats so i don't know if there's one. I would also be interested to see it if there's one.
---
'you care about slower content release, so we will modify it to be more representative of a true vanilla experience'
---
'but we really don't care what you want for AV so we'll release the easiest version'
---
IIRC they were there all the time in 1.12.
---
As Horde, you could climb all the way to the ceiling in the building the battlemasters were in while you waited in queues.
---
Getting a gear with a relatively good skin while being at weak level is one of the point i like in WoW Vanilla !
---
And look at the stats after DM was launched of how many guilds started to clear MC with the addition of gear, raid buff, and the nurfing of MC, especially Rag and his sons.
---
How about you actually going back and trying to kill Rag?
---
I agree. It would be nice to have them around for a limited time before being replaced by the armored versions. Ideally just long enough so they have the same exclusivity they had in vanilla and I can fulfill my dream of getting the white stallion.
---
Because NO CHANGES! 
---
Have you smelled a dwarf?
---
an earlier version of AV which was live for a longer period of time is also accurate 'nochanges' from retail vanilla
---
But again, those same people are the one advocating for #nochange. Unless they decide it's a good change, of course. OP is on point.
---
Those are by the way the same people that invoke the slippery slope argument to state that no changes should be made (although many things in pservers are wrong compared to Vanilla anyway, and probably more things to come when Classic is out). But for no reason it would not be appliable in that case? LuL?
---
The only thing I would like to see is, ***if 90%+ people recognize that 1.12 AV was a bad version*** (which is basically all retail AV versions it seems), and that it should be changed, ***then as 90%+ people recognize that Vanilla class talents, specially for hybrid class, are bad and that TBC talents are miles better***, I don't see why class talents (not class itemization) couldn't be slightly changed as well, to fit TBC.
---
Pure class players might not care, but hybrid main players do care.
---
Woah just take it easy man
---
That was a truly amazing read
---
Because that's broadly equivalent to when it came out in the original game.
---
It was intended to give solo/5-man content players a means of progression without getting into organised raiding.  Something for people who couldn't commit to a defined schedule or (more relevant at the time) didn't have PCs that could handle 20- or 40- man raids.
---
Tier 0.5 was a step up from the dungeon gear but trivial when compared to raid gear.  It was basically an achievement before achievements were added.  The gear made open world life at 60 a little easier for the people it was aimed at.
---
It was NEVER intended to be a "catch up" mechanic, the time investment it needed compared to pugging ZG/MC made it massively inefficient as a catchup for raiders.  True catchup didn't start until TBC introduced badge gear.
---
people wanted 1.12 with no changes compared to adding current retail features
---
in relation to earlier vanilla content, that was always a point for discussion 
---
OwO
---
There are a lot of things only available to those that put in the time.  
---
They were added just over a month after Battlegrounds were introduced originally. Highly doubt Blizzard is going to keep them out of classic for a month. 
---
Just purchased a 4K 32” it’s fucking huge. 
---
They were in Vanilla before 1.12.
---
I think they need to stay in. In PVE, if you can round up 5-40 people and travel as a pack to the dungeon entrance, you’re guaranteed to run that instance (lockouts not withstanding)
---
If PVP, if you round up 10-40 people and travel to the entrance, you have to wait for the opposite faction to coordinate and do the same. 
---
Queuing makes since for PVP. 
---
*Maybe people who haven’t done it since Vanilla don’t remember, but rounding up 5 players and coordinating your entrance to a dungeon isn’t always easy. Now try 40 people. Many friendships came from these hardships.*
---
if you want an AV zerg, there is a version of the game that offers that right now
---
if you want the day long war - it is not offered anymore. give the people what is not offered
---
In the meme Dwight is the one that is *against* just doing 1.12 AV without thinking about it, so you are contradicting yourself there
---
There was a time in WoW when you arrived in Orgrimmar after completing the 5-man Strath quest and/or Scholo quest with your blue quest reward -- and people were in awe that a) you and a 5-man could complete the dungeon, including the unnurfed Jandice -- and b) really, really wanted those items -- because back then it wasn't about "BiS" -- it was about learning your class, and working towards the best gear you could get -- and that took time, energy and skill.
---
This 1.5 AV isn't the original battle ground, not even close to it.  
---
1.12 isn't the original WoW, and not even close to it.
---
But this is the WoW that gave those who paid WoW $15 a month the most satisfaction versus the most aggravation / forum whining / and g-quitting.
---
And that is sad.
---
TBH I think hybrid classes are just fine. They each have a unique role or niche that they fill in both PvE and PvP that no one else can fill.
---
That's coming from someone who plays Druid, Shaman and Paladin on private servers.
---
Just because we're not topping the meters doesn't mean everything should be changed to suit us.
---
sstvNPC AV too hard
---
just NO
---
you will be screwing yourself over by losing the EXPERIENCE
---
If I were OP and I’m really going to leave the UK, I’d proactively do this at launch of Classic. 
---
Ping isn’t as bad as it used to be, so even if you get stuck playing on an eastern US server, you’ll still be fine.
---
When the discussion is clearly about AV from retail vanilla and how it was epic, then you go on a rant about AV in nost with the loaded and melodramatic '...How is that epic?', and finally get aggravated at someone else for making a pointless comment.... lol
---
I would have them available for a limited time and then replace them with the armored versions, just like retail. There's really no downside to having them available at launch imo. 
---
lel, when you can make a 2 macros that does \~optimized threat and link those to your mouse wheel up/down id say theres not much "dancing" going on. Especially in raids. 
---
While healing IS clicking on a grid, its too much more than that. You have to understand who to heal, why and how. When to cut your losses and most importantly in raiding, how the healers work as a group.
---
Best healers know their targets, THAT guy is a trigger happy dps warrior. If hes getting ANY damage, it means hes going to get killed in the next few seconds. But if you know hes really good, he will have LIP ready and you dont have to use CD's. Or its a aoe situation, if a mage has aggro, thats fine. Hes kiting, if he gets hit, you can already be late. So target him to see how the kiting is going for that clutch BOP / Shield.
---
Id say most deaths in raiding are based on personal mistakes on dps/tank/heal or healers not trusting each other/heal sniping. Lets say you are healing tank 1, hes not really taking damage, but you see tank 2 getting lower. So you start healing tank2 (even when he has his own heals). As soon as you do that, tank 1 gets crushed. Because you didnt have precasts coming to tank 1, you are now either late or hope someone has a big CD to use to bring him up again. Especially if your tanks are DW tanking, the damage can be spiky.
---
You can say the same thing about dps. The more dps you make without pulling aggro, the less tank takes damage and less healing is required. Less healing required more mana on healers aka you can pull the next pack sooner.
---
Its all a synergy where a good healer makes tank look good, good tank lets the dps look good and bad dps is... well just bad dps. :)
---
it was an aspect that has never been replicated, nothing like it is offered anymore. even blizzard has tried to replicate it with wintergrasp/etc but failed. pre npc nerf av is unique, just like the unique vanilla leveling experience. just because one person thinks vanilla is outdated and boring, doesn't mean others should not get to experience a game playstyle they want to. 
---
so you don't care about older AV, but if we want pre npc nerf av doesn't mean you get to determine what we get to play. if you disagree then I guess you're on the wrong forum and should play retail 
---
Just running to zep/off it will not affect your speed anywhere near as much as the fact how long you need to wait for the zep to arrive. You are talking of minutes, and even pushing for the nr.1 lvl 60 it wont matter.
---
I don’t have the specific talents but there is a build that is basically trispec 
---
Only dwarves and gnomes can ride mechanostriders
---
For PVP, there's no arena in classic, so you shouldn't worry about that. Otherwise, subjectively:  
---
World PVP : Hunter &gt; Rogue &gt; Mage. Hunters are an absolute joy to world pvp with especially while leveling. You have the advantage in most fights and usually end it before they even get the chance to retaliate. As a rogue, sure it's fun for some people... but I hate stealth and stealth users and think it's a stupid cowardly mechanic. Mages should be able to outplay pretty much everyone, except if they're out of mana. At 60 I'd say it's Mage &gt; Rogue &gt; Hunter  
---
In BG's, if you get to freecast, a mage or hunter is absolutely devastating, a rogue not so much. You can defend flags really well tho, so do with that as you may.  
---
Dungeons, I'd give bonus points to mages because they bring the strongest CC, food and water, and probably the best damage, basically people will love you. At the same time, there are a lot of mages and only 3 dps are needed in dungeons, so you should be fine with either rogue or hunter as well.  
---
Farming gold, it's either AOE farming with mage (needs respec), which is arguably the best gold making in the game (makes up for respec cost), solo runs as hunter, and pickpocketing as rogue. I think mage wins here... again...  
---
You could also consider spriest, but be prepared to heal if you don't want to wait longer for groups. Warlocks sure, but I'd suggest them more for someone who looks to get into raiding.  
---
Overall, to just enjoy the game, I feel like the most fun for you would be a Hunter. Both rogue and mage can get frustrating because if you're caught on the wrong foot, it's a bit harder to retaliate. Hunters have it easier in that regard.
---
internet is much better, play on other regions
---
[sstvNPC](https://static-cdn.jtvnw.net/emoticons/v1/1525252/3.0) AV too hard
---
Look up the names of randomized green items at the desired level on classic db then enter their names on wowpedia. The stats on there are accurate in my experience apart from a few minor quirks like +healing items sometimes also saying they give 1/3 the spell damage which wasn't the case until TBC.
---
As someone who never really experienced the old AV (I just never cared that much for PvP), I definitely dig the idea of being able to jump into the classic experience.
---
Otherwise... wouldn't you just play the current AV?
---
I assume you mean to say there will be no frontstabbing in Classic. That just means I will have to get behind my enemies. 
---
I remember the npc nerf patch, av changed at that point, just like when cross realm went into effect, av changed. I dont' remember the smaller changes, but those two made huge memorable impacts on av
---
I once leveled a Human priest up to level 31 only to delete it, I couldn't carry on and felt I was betraying my family.
---
My father and I have shared the same wow account for 12 years but once classic comes out I'm getting my own account and mailing myself all my live wow gold to use on tokens.
---
Then my dad and I are going to spend a week levelling together for the first time with 4 hours of sleep per night all week.
---
Can't fucking wait
---
No, quest objective is changed to an AV victory instead of killing Korak. The rewards are the same.
---
so don't play it, why do you get to dictate what other people get access to?
---
what if people were like that with vanilla, 'am I the only person that doesn't care for vanilla? I am happy with retail, they should just play what I like and be happy'
---
Gonna copy my post from above in case it helps you ..
---
Subjectively:

As I recall there where four blades for each server.
---
Loot Council, a method of distributing loot.
---
Im taking a scaled down version of your approach. 2 weeks off and dualboxing warrior+mage. Planning on prepping frozen/quick meals for the 2 weeks that can be eaten without getting my hands dirty. The idea is that I want to be able to heat and eat during flight oaths and autorun travel.
---
Oh I'll definitely be playing classic over retail for the most part
---
I didn’t make the post. Nice reading comprehension
---
Says the guy browsing a wow subreddit lol
---
If you are in any way frustrated with the grind in BfA, roll a rogue. If you don't mind grinding, having the hardest and slowest road to 60, tanking and being dependent on a good weapon drop, go warrior.  
---
As an incentive, warriors at 60 are the best tanks AND dps.
---
Meh, few others are in the same boat as me
---
youtube version? 
---
This is correct. Technically what happens is you get a quest to win AV. When you turn in that quest you automatically can pick up a new quest that is automatically completed, allowing you to pick from the usual rewards like ice barbed spear. So don't worry if you don't see the rare weapons in the AV victory quest rewards.
---
I'd be all for a series that follows 15 year Behind releases. Could even introduce a couple of quest lines that explain multiple timelines
---
Still unsure so...
---
What they tell us vs investors could be very different. 3 mil for a company that has 7.5bn annual revenue would be embarrassing and no doubt hurt their already hurt stock
---
pre npc nerf av was a battle, even lowbies could be an integral part. even undergeared players could be important. you could buff npc's, use them to help defend a graveyard/etc, you couldn't just get one person to agro the npc's and another to ninja the flag. you couldn't ignore the npc's - which slowed people down, and that gave people time to regroup and defend, which made REAL  battles
---
imagine the best mid field battle in wsg, multiply that by 10, add in npc's guarding the flag, and summon-able mobs to help push the other team back. when it was a good battle, it was unlike anything offered, it was the closest thing to an all out world pvp battle that would last days. there's a reason there are myths about it
---
gotcha. so this means on launch this weapon will be attainable.
---
What about the faction rep rewards like the purple weapons - also attainable from the get-go?
---
I remember in some pservers those quests and rewards werent available until later
---
&gt;the playerbase has already experienced the unpolished no changes journey-over and over-for more than 5 years
---
What does this even mean? Is it talking about pservers? Because I think it's well-established at this point that none of them are truly blizz-like
---
That's not true, there are enough private servers with earlier impressions of AV and even there everyone rushes trough the sides. The hours/day long AV battles are just a playerbase thing. You will only get an hours/days long AV if one side turtles in base.
---
Yeah they won't be so special the second time around when thousands and thousands of people have them.
---
They'd just turn into the Beanie Babies of WoW the second time around.
---
but but but, Warlock mount, pally mount, Quel'Serrar, 
---
Hi, may I ask what AV stands for?
---
I started in tbc and dinged a couple months before wotlk so it was awesome. The community was still there and the game felt very fresh and exciting. I haven't raided since but i was really drawn into all the end game content. Lately it's been lackluster 
---
I'm sure a big part of it is the fact I'm not longer in school and actually have to work 50-60+ hrs plus adulting etc etc less time to play since cata
---
There are a few threads of guilds posting LFG on this subreddit. Search a bit and they should be easy to find
---
&gt;  contributing nothing to the objective
---
pre npc nerf av had many objectives, 1.12+ av had only one objective - who has the most epic mounts and gets to the boss first
---
I agree streamers pushing shit for their own content benefit is terrible
---
but modern day blizzard is a cost-cutting profit machine, and it *will* push to the limit their ability to shard and reduce server cost
---
they have shown before, the line they walk has steadily moved toward the shareholder at the expense of the player
---
At this point, my expectation is they will fuck up sharding 
---
Goldshire / Razor Hill will never be the same, just like walking into major cities won't be either.
---
You are just a pathetic troll...
---
I don't care for race to 60 ;) I only wonder how much I can shorten the walk (avoid mobs).
---
Not on launch.  BGs are phase 2.
---
Oops! Thanks
---
Still unlikely to be available at launch, as blizzard has stated they don't plan on having BGs at release, although that could be changed.
---
Yet the 5min rush happen everytime on pservers.
---
ONE ACTION BAR
---
that's true vanilla for you
---
the rewards will happen either way, and if it's a slower process it feels like you actually earned it. that is the vanilla way, those who use the ease of gaining rewards as an excuse for a zerg av are missing the entire point of rewards in vanilla 
---
pre npc nerf av or nothing imo
---
No, it does not mean that. Nothing about just when battlegrounds are available have been set in stone. Very unlikely they will be up on day 1
---
It's amazing how many people (like OP) don't understand the concept of using patch 1.12 as a **technical foundation** rather than a complete replica.
---
That used to work but had been removed by 1.12.
---
29/11/11
---
Yeah my mistake for not realizing I was talking to a pathetic troll.
---
You got me!
---
You mac is probably good enough. I played legion for a few hours on a 2013 MBA. It worked fine.
---
But if it overheat and it becomes a problem buy a screen, a keyboard, a mouse and one of those laptop fan. I remember it made a big difference when I was playing lol on my old gaming laptop back in 2010.
---
I agree! Mounts used to my thing in WoW, untill Cata. Even in Wrath they overflooded us with crazy models and colors, and in the end there were few rare "flex"-mounts. Nowadays (retail) I have no idea if a mount is rare or not, and I just use standard mounts, cause those are the rarest to see someone use.
---
How did the Forsaken original epic mounts look like?
---
The standard Resto Druid PvP spec is [8/12/31](http://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zL0hZxGzoZVgcoeq0o).
---
There's not much variation because it's really just about picking up the most powerful points in the tree and there's not a lot of choices to be made. Any good Druid PvP spec tries to pick up as many of the most powerful talents such as Feral Charge, Entangling Roots, Furor, Improved Bash, Nature's Swiftness etc.
---
Druid AoE damage is basically non existent compared to Mages and Warriors who are usually relied on for AoE in mass PvP. The major jobs that any support/healer shares regardless of class is healing, dispelling and CCing.
---
I hope that answers your question.
---
Why did you take the time to type out all of that RP garbage at the top, and then not spell check your post? 
---
Alterac Valley.
---
Not trying to be condescending, but why do people think blizzard would use anything other than 1.12 after everything they have said?
---
&lt; This.  Also, part of the quest chain involves summoning a special boss in Dire Maul, so it can't be added before DM is opened at the very earliest.
---
There is no "Best Vanilla". There is either Vanilla or something different. Those are the only options.
---
Multiboxing has always been allowed.
---
Thanks Josh. Keep up the good work! 
---
I still use my white stallion on live when I play. I hope it’s available in Classic.
---
So far I don't think I need a keyboard. the Keyboard on the Omen is rather good. It has back lighting with different colours that you can set separately. So WSAD has a different colour of the rest of the keyboard. 
---
And you have 3 additional zones (left/middle/right) that you can all assign a different colour. However I'd say that's more of a gimmick then really useful. But the keyboard has a numpad and it's really designed around gaming. 
---
Other stuff I like is:
---
It has a Wifi booster. So it takes priority over other devices connected to that wifi router.
---
B&amp;O build in speakers
---
4K screen
---
And some other gimmicks that I don't really use (yet). Like a "performance center" where you can check the performance of you GPU, CPU, temperature etc. 
---
And you have 4x USB 3.0 port which is nice.
---
Of course I didn't say anything about the processor, SSD, videocard etc. But I presume you've checked that on the internet already. It's quite good. Probably not the best you can buy with money. But I've paid only 800 euro's for it, so you can't really expect i9 etc. But for a 800 euro laptop it's rather good.
---
It's not a catchup, it's the best gear available to a solo/5-man player but it's massively inefficient for anyone who has access to raids.
---
Lol jesus that'd be a long wait for just av
---
Perhaps. Again it depends on the mats of leveling engineering. From pserver experience it was never really expensive at all and didn't really make up for how tedious leveling mining is. 
---
Love your podcast, listened to them all.
---
If I could give one peace of advice / criticism I would say stop saying "fuck/fucking" to spice up your dialog, it sounds a bit contrived/cringey and not like you.

No they were permanent. I think you’re thinking of the battleground holidays. Each weekend emissaries from one of the battleground factions would show up in the capitals and that battleground would have increased faction and honour rewards. I think these were added in 1.7. 
---
Yeah I didn’t think it did. I guess we have to wait and see for classic.
---
I would love a youtube version as well, even without video if it is just audio only.
---
Hi, /u/lecorrele
---
I really don't understand why there isn't some weekends with the bosses that later left back in Alterqc Valley. 
---
Imagine your guild Ques up and surprise surprise this Saturday there's a Boss again and defeating him lets you skip part of a quest you got if you loot his corpse. 
---
Just an "every once in awhile" sort of thing. 
---
Not confirmed yet so no they aren't.
---
But it's safe to say they won't be on launch.
---
Npnp :)
---
In mass owPvP, resto hybrid will be the best if you are traveling with friends. Heals + DPS usually beats all DPS. They hop on you, you HOT and go bear. If not, spam spells.
---
When you are not around friends, balance hybrid or deep feral. With resto, you will suck at grinding or defending yourself from attacks for that matter.
---
Druid is the only race choice that doesn’t matter. There’s only one.
---
Yea, semi-troll semi-serious as any good troll. I think only wotlk fans should have the right to replay their favorite iteration of WoW.. 
---
But I'll still be playing classic!
---
No clue what someone would claim as optional.
---
I personally would want a lot of spell power, with a 29/11/11 style build.  Play a sudo-Warlock by Moonfire and Insect swarming as many people as you can between removing curses and poisons like Viper Sting from your allies.  This would really give you a lot of "AoE" damage and boost your own teams by not having tongues or mana burn issues.
---
Time to upgrade regardless
---
Ha, thats funny. MICHAEL
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't they explicitly say that the earliest version of data still available was from 1.12? Let's assume they don't have the data from 1.5, then that means they would need to re-create 1.5 AV, which would mean extra development time. Is it really such a huge problem that we're getting 1.12 AV?
---
Who are you talking about? I am german but I started playing at the end of BC.   
---
I want to know who it is!
---
In my old Vanilla experience, people played AV just to have something to do. In my PServer days, it was just "efficiently farming rep/honor". Which one will cross over into classic remains to be seen. People on Pservers were typically knowledgable and had been doing it for a while so it was more of a routine and obligation to do it on a new character. In classic, I'm not sure this will be the case.
---
Although, on PServers it would still occasionally turn into a 2 hour turtle on bridge so who knows.                                 
---
We won't have AV at launch so don't worry about that.
---
You hit the nail on the head. It was about the battle itself, not just zerging to end it. People actually enjoyed those epic battles. Some, obviously, did not and just wanted to rush the farming. I wish I had an old screenshot I took during one of those battles that showed Lok and Ivus both in the Field of Strife with both sides just going at it.
---
That's when bg's were actually enjoyable.
---
Thank you! This did help, gave a general idea of what I should do/expect.   
---
I was just curious about macros and addons since I have never used them before.
---
At least the reinforcements aren't in this version.
---
People coming form retail to classic will be like small children who lost grip on mommies hand half way across an 8 lane highway
---
The mounts weren't placeholders and their models were never updated (they were replaced with entirely new mounts), so your analogy makes no sense.
---
They should be available for a limited time just like they were in Vanilla.
---
Im running an i3-2120 and a ATI Radeon 6870 lol... it can still run BFA decently, its confusing.
---
I need to buy an Overwatch / MCC PC soon anyway so an upgrade is in sight.
---
GTX 1060ti(me) baby
---
Because 300k is the minimum that they can get away with pay attention
---
Isn’t that the same thing?
---
So don't watch it and move on with your life? You've already wasted the time complaining about it. 
---
I used to play Tol Barad a lot in Cata and the most fun I had was in the matches that lasted longest.
---
I'm not sure I can speak for anyone else in this but I enjoy having a good battle more than a clinical execution of the victory conditions.
---
&gt; To play healer in a 5-man group is also completely different than playing it in a game like overwatch where they are very much “support”. Many misconceptions are made about MMO healers from people coming from those team-based shooters, assuming it is a passive role where you stay behind.
---
Maybe it's different in other team shooters but no healer in Overwatch -- not even Mercy -- is a passive/stay-behind role. Between tossing out damage orbs, stuns, healing suppressants and booster beams, there's plenty for a healer (or rather, a  support character) to do rather than just "passively" healing.
---
As a person who played and will play undead again... it doesnt really affect me.
---
Would be really cool not only does it offer an exclusive item it rewards those veterans who are well versed in the content who will breeze through and get their epic sooner than most.
---
Same boat.  Trying to get all projects around the house done so I can focus on what matters which is classic wow. 
---
Can't wait to see how popular classic is.  I'm sure it'll have a giant burst to subscriber numbers but how sustainable will it be?
---
Well you can still spirit res near Org and run to Valley of Trials without any problems.
---
I heard a story about a girl who traded an “epic mount” for an epic mount..
---
Now i’m imagining the baby rolling around in a hampster ball while he raids..
---
I hope you're not referring to his Warlock leveling, because he's pretty much the worst warlock I've ever seen.
---
I stand corrected. Jeez that's a long time to level 
---
Mobile games have as good ground textures but they don't use any kind of texture smoothing. They also have shit camera angles and insist on putting your skills Al on the right side of the screen.
---
Agine playing on mobile and you have skill icons about a quarter the size of the nails on your this, Al ligned up on the bottom. 
---
Instead mobile MMORPGs have this stupid crap interface. Let me use BOTH thumbs to hit skills so I can turn the camera easier. 
---
https://androidcommunity.com/age-of-wushu-dynasty-review-a-martial-arts-mmorpg-for-your-android-device-20160115/
---
Check out the bottom right skills. That's how every mobile MMORPGs does it. (barf)
---
Sometimes I need to turn the camera and I literally have to stop using skills to do it. That's horrible! At least if I had them on the bottom of the screen I could still turn camera and use some of them, or even all of them.
---
Better yet pet me have a "turning band". That is a horizontal band running across the top of my screen when I'm in landscape so I can always pan right/left whether I have to run or use skills
---
blizz: we're using patch 1.12
---
blizz: naxxramas is closed
---
Old AV was sitting mid with the ornate spyglass ninja sniping corpse tokens from other peoples kills. THAT was vanilla 
---
Just a bit of info you'll see as you play WoW a lot: people like to kill things. Thats why there are 4 classes in the game that do nothing BUT kill things (mage/warlock/rogue/hunter) and there will always be an overabundance of DPS classes, despite the fact that the party make-up is 3 dps, 1 tank, and 1 healer.
---
Since the day that the dungeon finder came out (back in like...... idunno 2009?) if you make a tank on WoW and que up, you're likely to instantly be put in a group. Whereas if you roll a dps class....... you're likely to wait. For a decade now that has been a consistent truth.
---
Stevinioh from wowszene. I think he was still active during BC so maybe you know him. He also produced Allimania.
---
Looking to play a Holy Paladin once classic launches, I have no experience of Pally pretty much ever given my mains have always been Warlock/Shaman since I started playing in TBC.
---
Can anyone help me decide what race? I'm leaning towards Human given they have generally more useful racials compared to the Dwarf where Stoneform loses a lot of its value on a class that can cleanse, but at the same time I also consider a Dwarf wearing goggles to be innately funny (I blame Flintlocke) and I have good memories of my first serious character wearing them.
---
Could anyone give me a rundown on what professions to go for too? My default assumption has been Mining/Blacksmithing (armorsmith) to gear myself up and make cash from 60s, but a lot of people have been talking about Herb/Alch as being super useful for the class too, especially as a healer. Enchanting/Engineering is also tempting for similar money making reasons and Engi really helps in PVP + would let me get my beloved Flying Tiger Goggles.
---
Time to extrapolate the launch based in this. 
---
out of all the dumb posts I see on this sub, this is up there. No one cares.
---
Lmao. This.
---
In their defense not everyone is having or interested in those/these conversations until it actually happens first hand. They really just want to have some random ability that doesnt translate into much of anything at the end of the day
---
Oh, thanks.
---
NE, because winterspring saber and winterspring mount.
---
But for those of you sane enough to avoid that grind, being able to stealth with your pet is far superior in both PvP and PvE imo, just not for duels. 
---
Feign death doesn’t mean you won’t die, wisp form isn’t a negative as it will still save you time in the long run, pun intended. Treasure tracking is a negative since hunters have so many other tracking abilities competing with that slot. If you plan to mine or herb on that character it’s even more useless.
---
Night elf also has the highest base agility by a very small amount, and NE females have realistic bow animations, if that sort of thing interests you.
---
I want pre nerf AV too but this post is just silly rhetoric. The classic team has reversed design decisions in the past. You can try to articulate more effectively why you think they should put in time and effort (perhaps at the cost of delaying release) into giving us an earlier version of AV. Maybe something good will come of it.
---
Of course but nothing would bother a spirit on a way. I read somewhere that logging of could unbind you from a spirit healer but I don't know what it is based on.
---
More zone / questing paths.. i’m not concerned about time or efficiency. I havent played Alliance ever until recently and my Mage is currently lvl 38 but I have exhausted most of STV / DWM and Desolace.. any ideas?
---
You're not early, our raid guild now has 60 members and biweekly meetings.  Thrilled so many are guilding up and ready to go!
---
I was dreading the longer AV and soooo glad it's not going to be in there. I need some AV rep items for my PvE set and will need to farm some quick rep. Fast wins/loses is the best way to get rep (maybe tagging a gy or two as well)
---
No it’s “make it possible for me (everyone) to hit 60 in a month.” Versus “give me some extra time to hit 60.”
---
That i3 is still pretty capable, just throw 750Ti or 1050Ti at it. Of course if you want to go with an all new build there is no point but for budget it would be a decent upgrade.
---
Imagine they release progressive AV. Do you honestly think once they patch it up and things start getting removed and it begins to turn into 1.12 AV, that people will be happy? 
---
Not just that. If they're not time limited, like the previous poster is suggesting, then they'd just be another coloration.
---
The whole point is that you can only get them if you're one of the first to have the gold, etc.
---
Yeah, youre right.  I was thinking their 4 phase plan which had them in phase 2.  The new plan hasnt specified.
---
You're getting wooshed. I'm calling Jim Dwight, since he looks like him here.
---
I think this is spot on.
---
Once the dust settles and Classic has it's core players, I think we'll see a decent amount of positive interactions like we used to but nowhere near to the amount that it used to be.
---
The internet, online gaming, and society has fundamentally changed since the mid-late 2000s and the release of a retro era game won't change that. We'll have plenty of positive oldschool interactions, for sure, but you'll still have people acting exactly how they do in any modern era online game. 
---
I think the QOL is going to be the determining factor.  Thanks for the write up.
---
They would need to have 5 million subs from day one to make 1 billion in *revenue* the first year
---
I've tried getting back I to RuneScape so many times but they insist on using only point and click for movement. 
---
It also feels laggy and slow u like WoW. At least in wow when you point and click you move right away.
---
I have the white Mechanostrider Mod B on retail.  There's an achievement associated with it "Old School Ride".
---
One of the few people who bought their epic mount while the first models were the only option _and_ did not choose to trade it in for the shiny new ones when they were implemented.
---
Probably goes without saying that I don't want to see any of you who didn't get the original way have it unlocked on your retail account.
---
Defeats the entire point of what makes them special.
---
Here's a nilla clip riding it with one of my friends on his newer model https://youtu.be/QLHtXb-wh-U?t=19
---
I'm not the guy who's running 10 characters dog I was just saying gold matters a lot in vanilla. 
---
From my perspective even having 2 accounts + hitting rank 14 makes you more autistic than anyone I associate with so imo the pot shouldn't call the kettle black. 
---
AV on private servers I played on was always funny to me.  People would always talk about how much they can’t wait for day long fights on the bridge and what not, then it releases and everyone just rushes backdoor for rep.
---
There may be some people that want long games and such but seems the majority end up just rushing it.
---
No? How is "make leveling faster" the same as "dont change leveling, just keep old 60 mounts available for a little longer"?
---
Its not like they were originally planned to be removed either, its just something that happened. 
---
Progressive AV is a compromise. I'd rather have that than only 1.12. it's really a compromise for most people who liked a specific form of AV. Going off of a relative timeline people would have less to complain about. That's not to say no one would.
---
I’ll be honest, I played WoW from Vanilla to BFA and while I sometimes got bored or disliked a direction the game went - I have never come to the forums to complain about it. 
---
I’m sure there are dozens like me.
---
Nothing would really bother you if you were to just run there as long as you stay on the road and remain a bit cautious. 
---
Never heard about that logging off thing for the record so I can't comment on that.
---
Damn. It's been more than a decade since I was naive enough to buy a Mac (jk) so I don't know.
---
You can rebind keys, but I don't think escape debinds.
---
What you can do (at least in actual Vanilla 1.12, idk about Classic) is you can make a spell cancel macro, and then bind that to a key.
---
It will take up one of your keybinds which is a bummer, but at least you'll have it.
---
You could also use an external keyboard I guess. That's what I do on my Levono ThinkPad for long Vanilla WoW sessions, so I'm not so close to the screen.
---
I recently leveled a Dwarf Priest to 30 on PS and it was great. I’ve pretty much played Priest and Paly since launch but after playing BFA, going back to vanilla was sooo good. I took tailoring and enchanting just to get the wands then plan to leave professions until 60. I was surprised just how many greens that were bound already that I was disenchanting, however. The Dwarf treasure finder came in handy too.
---
You sound like a salty old grump
---
Tbh, same. I’m going to do the Frostwolves grind and going for at least R10 - I feel like a long AV would really turn a huge goal into an almost unreleastic goal.
---
I don't agree. I like the fucks. Keep them fucking coming for fucks sake. Also, he's an Ozzie so it would be weirder if there wasn't any swearing.
---
I appreciate the discussion that your very insightful comment adds. Downvoting isn't a disagree button.
---
I kinda think that's the case with all the iterations of the game, they all have their strengths and weaknesses which people brush under the rug depending on what their preferred class/activity is.
---
It's not difficult to reach level 60 and earn a thousand gold within a month.
---
Pretty much anyone can earn 50g/hr just from grinding random mobs in the world. If you farm for 20 hours that's 1k gold. So within a week of hitting 60 you could have that mount by playing less than 3 hours per day if you're efficient.
---
Being able to farm that mount is not an amazingly difficult feat in current year.
---
Big time fan Josh! Loving the content!
---
🎶Grey skies clouding up the things we used to see with wide eyes.  
---
Maybe everything was meant to be this way
---
Will it ever change.    
---
But are we stuck here on our own
---
[Chorus]
---
It's all gone grey.     
---
It's all gone grey.    🎶
---
For 40-60 dungeon tanking pretty much everything you need is a shield and the latest rank of Sunder Armor
---
The idea of DW tanking bosses is higher TPS (especially important on horde) so your DPS can pump harder. It's a pserver tryhard thing for speedrunning content that they absolutely blast through that very few people will do in actual classic.
---
Nah, not really. Just don’t rush. 
---
These are probably people who have played BFA where it becomes more and more apparent that The Horde (Sylvanas and anyone following her) are "bad guys".
---
I'm just hoping they have something planned for Sylvanas other than her being Garrosh 2.0. 
---
I agree with your assessment for anything pre Cataclysm, but post cataclysm, The Horde have been on a moral decline, recently getting worse in BFA. 
---
The grind is hell on a PvP server lol but so damn worth it.
---
Thats actually pretty awesome but I have hit a theshold in competitive Overwatch were if I want to progress I can’t play on console anymore.
---
I would be happy with 60FPS but I don’t see that i3 doing the job and it would be almost easier to gear up for 144hz. If I make a PC for Halo / Overwatch WoW will no doubt run on that..
---
Saying that though I will be keeping my old PC and my 13 y.o brother is going to be playing Classic with me. I may look into a 1050ti upgrade so my brother can have a desktop (over his school laptop) to properly play with me on.
---
Really looking forward to having a family member play with me.
---
You know. Sitting in my DX Racer chair with my Funko Pops behind me while I’m talking into a microphone.  
---
PRODUCED!!!!  
---
Stun resist on orc, will of the forsaken on undead, war stomp on Tauren, and aoe silence on blood elves are all strong racials. Blood elves just solidify their upper hand.
---
Especially when compared to Draenei racials... a 1.5s cast time HoT that can be interrupted and locks out holy?  That’s your answer to another interrupt for horde?  Then there’s shadowmeld, perception, and escape artist which are ok but not great.  Dwarf racials are the only thing worthy of most horde racials.
---
Pair that with Paladins going to horde and alliance loses their main edge that made racial imbalance less important.  Horde have had hands-down better racials since day 1.  It just becomes more painfully apparent when classes selections are mirrored and in situations where razors edge balance matters (arenas).
---
D2 has been doing it for me too. Character progression is pretty good and the gameplay is pretty fun as well.
---
Final Fantasy 11 Private Server, Division 1 replay and then Division 2. I'm set, let classic get delayed. I've been wanting this game since 2008 and once it's here then it's gone and I don't have anything else to look forward to.
---
Taking away the need for player interaction with 'quick play' features really changed things. 
---
Behaviour that would typically bar access to rewards a player seek no longer have consequence.
---
Character transfers, realm merging, name change, race change, With a realm system that hinges on community building in order to retain subs, these services and exciting new features really undermine that. 
---
This time around though each realm does not consist of a single "electricity guzzling machine". Maybe they will 'allow' realms with 200 concurrent players to live on. Heck, one sub ought to have fed a server-blade back then... idk.
---
&gt;Would they trade their level 60 decked out in full Naxx gear, ready to start leveling in Outland, for a level 1 orc with op racials?
---
I know I wouldn't. Some of the vanilla bis gear is actually useful in TBC. But honestly I doubt many people will care that much about this. 
---
I haven’t kept up with retail too much, but during Vanilla Sylvanas was being corrupted by Verimathras, and I feel like I heard about her being corrupted by someone else. I hope she gets a redemption arc, but I don’t know exactly what happened with her in BFA. 
---
&gt;The whole reason why people want these mounts today is because they're rare.
---
No Classic player cares what retail players do, or don't have.  Rare based on what metric?  Their rarity in Classic has yet to be determined.
---
&gt;The models themselves aren't anything special.
---
They look nice, so many people want to ride them.  I'm sorry you don't think they're fun.  This is just an out of place subjective comment.
---
&gt;If everyone has these in classic, what's the point then?
---
Everyone that had epic riding in Classic did have these at one point, and they weren't even taken away.  Players were just given the opportunity to exchange them for armored versions.  I see absolutely no reason these mounts wouldn't see a return.
---
No one is "going back" to current servers because no one is playing on them now.
---
Magnets, how do they work?!
---
This. 
---
I see this happening if they want to try rereleasing further expansions. 
---
I'm rooting for a bc expac so that there is a wotlk but i just don't see the numbers being viable if they preserve classic and tbc 
---
I can't wait to find out what day it will launch. Need to mark the calendar and find the right days off from work to start out lol. 
---
As long as you can run current version of wow, I can guarantee you that you can run classic wow no problem. 
---
But he said the models aren't special.  It's an unbeatable argument.  Lol
---
If you manage to be in the first group of 60s it means you'll be in high demand for dungeon groups. You'll be in that top geared elite circle before everyone else. I know of a guild that is aiming for a week 1 MC clear. 
---
Your best bet might be to just get an external keyboard. I'll most likely be playing on a MBP as well but gaming on that keyboard is a nightmare.
---
Nice. Btw if it handles BfA just fine now then Classic should be no problem either even if you don't upgrade.
---
They're only fine as long as you want to heal. But for some reason warrior gets a pass from the community, it's just fine for them to be both the best damage and the best tank but god forbid any other hybrids have two viable specs.
---
They prolly gonna be more blizzlike than classic is the way it's heading but owell
---
You can't resist Hamstring, it's a physical effect not a spell. It can still miss or be dodged/parried, though.
---
It will be August
---
Anytime you wipe and all 40 people need to reapply their consumes that's several hundred gold down the drain. World buffs minimize this.
---
Also just cause you never even used a flask it's likely your tanks were and probably a healer or two in order to carry the fights that went on longer than they should have if people played correctly. 
---
Added 'class:' operator for now, 'usable:' will take more work since I basically have to break it down into a complex query (e.g. for rogue it would be something like if it's armor then is it leather or cloth and not class restricted, if it's a weapon then is it an axe/mace/dagger and not class restricted, etc.).
---
*Sees minimap of pure red circles*
---
Maybe not...
---
I added class: and ilvl as a display/sorting value.
---
The biggest thing is going to be inflation of players on pve realms. Streamers like asmongold already said there is no chance in hell they'll be on a pvp server due to the ganking that will happen endlessly.
---
That's all fine and dandy but I distinctly remember the entire private server community asking for "#nochanges 1.12!" when the development of Classic began. They can't really be upset about it now. 
---
I personally advocated for a frankenpatch from day one but that only got me shouted down by the 1.12 #nochanges crowd. 
---
I’m co-signing this. Balance is garbage in WPvP and Druid’s are incredibly potent healers due to their mobility, utility, and damage mitigation or dealing potential. Let other people do the big numbers, your job is to keep the big hitters alive and sneak in a few hits when you can.
---
Added, you can now do type:weapon has:armor
---
Their downfall is lack of aoe healing and HoTs. As long as your group can avoid aoe damage its fine. Otherwise catching up can be a problem.
---
I dont think they would unlock it on retail if you get it on classic. They already said that about gear and xmog
---
Hunters really do fall off big time as more patches are released, as your pet just doesn't scale at all with gear. Considering what you have said here, I would actually advise against picking that class. If you want a similar class that does continue to scale, Warlock would likely fit your requirements better.
---
That'd be cool! if you have any ideas for a design send me a DM and we'll talk.
---
Pet tanks, he does dps AND healer because he has mend pet, first aid and a lot of minor healing potions from alchemy. Duh
---
Do yo think people will leave wow because of the pandas? Oops wrong expansion.
---
Please don't post about TBC, it devides the community. Post somewhere else
---
I duel the opposite faction in neutral cities like gadgetzan then /forfeit as their projectile is on the way to hit me. The guards get really upset with them for some reason...
---
Fixed the extraattacks mod being missing, thanks for pointing it out!
---
it should be like every other private server, where the first few months the epic mounts are non armored and after that they add in armored epic mounts
---
he didn't mention your name, so I'm going to assume that you speak for you
---
To add on to the PVP side, Alliance Warlocks tend to have a rougher time of it because Undead (one of the more popular races) can remove a lot of your CC with their racial. Not to say that you can't still be great in pvp (1v1 especially) you'll just have to work a bit harder than Horde members will in some cases.
---
That said Gnomes make for great PVE Warlocks with their extra 5% INT. 
---
Classic is built on the Legion client (and may be ported to the BFA client by launch). That means, it's running on a client with 12 years of optimizations over the 1.12.1 client. However, graphically, running on "Classic" settings, it doesn't visually look significantly different from roughly Vanilla/TBC/WotLK era WoW.
---
What does this mean?
---
We're running a game that's barely more visually complex than a 2007 WoW, but is as optimized as a 2018-2019 WoW. So, despite what people here speculate and even despite whatever system requirements Blizzard claims, I truly believe that Classic will run quite well even on 10-12+ year old PCs. I ran some tests during the BlizzCon Classic Demo and found the Classic client ran better for me than the Vanilla client, especially regarding low-end frame times (aka, dips/drops in framerate were worse on the Vanilla client than the Classic client).
---
tl;dr: we won't know until we get the beta, but I suspect any gaming PC built in the last 10 years will run it smoothly.
---
I don't think they should be included. Their existence in the game is controversial. There were players who had them and exchanged them for the new models not understanding the ramifications of that action. But now everyone knows and it would just be a race to get to 60 in time. 
---
From what you have said, Priest sounds like a perfect fit for your needs.
---
Because for Blizzard there's a big difference between:
---
* 50% - I want 1.12
---
* 50% - I want 1.5
---
And:
---
* 10% - I want 1.12
---
* 10% - I want 1.5
---
* 80% - Either one is fine with me
---
We haven't even had a proper beta and from what we know there hasn't been any real testing done at all. Fall release at the earliest is far more likely.
---
Wrong.
---
Even with 1.1 itemization on gear, most preraid gear is better than T1 gear, both pre-update and post-update T1.
---
But that still does not leave you with "literally no upgrades", there's still plenty of desirable items from the instance.
---
EVEN SO, Molten Core was not designed around players going in with full preraid BIS. This isn't retail where every single new raid has upgrades for every single slot of gear you're wearing.
---
You can't go wrong with any of these choices, but my personal pick would be hunter. 
---
Hunters have unparalleled soloing capability due to kiting and their pet. General rule is if you can kite it, you can kill it. Doesn't matter what level or the HP. Same applies to PvP. You can take on warriors 10+ levels higher than you as long as you keep your distance. 
---
In dungeons you bring great DPS and CC, not much more needed than that. In raids, you start off strong but have a falloff. Pets don't scale with your gear unfortunately. In MC you will be strong, in Naxx you will be towards the bottom. That being said, raids will always bring hunters for their utility. If fashion is important, you'll be able to wear your Tier sets as BiS. Other dps classes need to mix and match to get the most out of each raid tier. 
---
Don't know much about farming gold. I heard DM and Mara farming are possible as a hunter. Mage can AoE farm. Not sure which is more profitable. I don't think rogues can compete with solo gold farming compared to a frost Mage or Hunter. 
---
Skinning + Herb/Mining is my go to gold making method while leveling. You will have more than enough gold at lv40 for your mount. You can always switch to Engineering at 60 for PvP. Plus, Engineering gives you access to your most powerful ammo as a Hunter. 
---
I wouldn’t mind a threat meter being baseline. After all the years people have spent in retail not needing to worry about threat, I’m expecting PuG’s to be an ordeal.
---
If that’s too game changing, mailing multiple items seems harmless enough.
---
Fantastic! Already have both!
---
I'd still like to learn a bit more about tanking though, so I'm not such a noob.
---
That’s not classic tho 
---
Real answer? Play what's fun. Optimal answer? Hunter.
---
No, Gyth's Skull was a blue item from the beginning.
---
This sounds more like sharding is solving a problem, not creating one?
---
Why, as players, would we want a massive deficit of ore/herbs? It's just going to make gathering profs harder to level along with your character, and drive the price of very cheap (once the population and economy stabilizes) materials through the roof.
---
On top of that, it scales with the number of players; so it's not like we'll be seeing massively more materials hitting the market, since there's more people buying them as well.
---
Lastly, this is just for the lowest tier of materials. As soon as you start moving up to the next tier, it's a completely moot point. Oh no, people will be able to get to level 75 skills cheaply... what a game breaking economy change...
---
You are wrong he is correct.
---
Good luck leveling there, that zone will be most crammed out of all horde starting zones. Took me 2-3 hours to get to lvl 5 on a pserver launch. 
---
My eyes..
---
the majority of people wouldn't have the mounts in this scenario tho so 
---
You didn’t come across as a grump at all. Your post was well formatted and respectful given the situation. Ignore that other guy, and i hope you have a good day :)
---
&gt; but the people who are adamently against 1.5 AV either want their sugar coated version of Vanilla or were beholden to the ways of private servers
---
Jesus Christ this sub loves overstating things.  3 day AV's long AV's sucked.
---
Why don't you go play BfA then. Don't ruin my Classic.
---
Ashenvale.
---
Might wanna google that ...
---
Take my karma you dirty whore
---
Well I mean, they did burn down Stormwind that one time. Killed their King.... nearly wiped out the draenei. The list kind of goes on? 
---
Not once they apologized for any of that.
---
I wouldn't recommend a Paladin, especially not a Holy Pally.
---
Holy was the healing tree, so you will be lacking DPS significantly while leveling up. 
---
The best Pally for leveling is a Ret Pally, and even then the DPS is very stale and leveling can be very grindy. 
---
Pally's at end game are healers as well, no combat.
---
I had the meadow ring of the monkey drop in a group of two the other day and the guy rolled need after i greeted (he was a mage and this is +3 Agi +3 stam 19 twink ring). I said r u gonna equip that and he said yes. I said equip it. He didn’t respond, I repeated myself and he kept walking around not responding. He never equipped it. 
---
What i would do (and have done) is that if you arent tanking full time all the time, is to make a macro that does most of the work. Meaning if shit goes sideways you are good to go without thinking it.
---
What the macro should do:
---
* Change weapons to 1h+shield
---
* Put on defensive stance
---
* Start doing aggro building by just adding priority skill list.
---
I have that kind of macro bound to my scroll wheel UP. And on mouse down i have additional skills like shield block / heroic strike spam. You can after that tank by just scrolling up and down. Do tab targeting for multiple (low number) targets. And do like demo/battleshout with their own buttons (just spam battleshout if theres like 5+ targets but make sure your group is near to you to get the aoe threat from the shout).
---
This is just for you to feel comfortable doing everything relatively efficiently. IMO biggest challenge in tanking is actually start doing it. And i wouldnt trust the itemization that much, in most cases just plain %-HIT is the best tanking stat out there. One of the best trinkets ? Maraudon pariah +25 all stats on hit.
---
And best advice for tank novice is, dont worry that much if you loose aggro, its most likely the dumb ass DPS aoeing too fast or starting on wrong target. If they pull something, let them handle it. Just keep the mobs off the healer.
---
After you get comfortable in doing it all yourself, you can break down the macros into different smaller macros that give you more control on when what skill is used.
---
OP ask for masspvp and yall linking 1v1 and wsg specs dafuq...in mass PvP you're a healer, you don't need charge since charging in as a druid in mass pvp will get you killed and interrupting is not worth it nor is it your job to do, standing in the back and regrowthing everyone in the party+ spamming rank 4 healing touch is what you will be doing, fearie fire on all enemy rogues and a few roots when you got time for it, that's it. Here is the spec [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zj0hMZZxEcoeqmo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zj0hMZZxEcoeqmo) pure defensive healer and natures reach so you can fearie fire and root from far away without being hit. 
---
Why it has to be categorized this way? 
---
Is there purpose behind these categorization? 
---
That's you. Other people might be here just to keep up with the announcements and community content, and don't care about being armchair designers like the most vocal lot.
---
Was this recorded between 1.0 and 1.12? It was? Cool. Then it's vanilla.
---
The *only* way to get rid of rushing is to remove the Marks of Honor. Having a currency to buy gear that you only get when you finish the BG is what creates the incentive to rush.
---
It's a good investment if you have the gold. You can use it till you're 60 and find something like the Rod of the Ogre Magi!
---
These models were removed in vanilla and classic is based on the modern engine with modern assets, so literally it does require them to develop an updated version of the models. 
---
She burned down Teldrassil amongst other things.
---
Varok Saurfang and Baine Bloodhoof are pretty much in open rebellion against what she is doing as the current Warchief.
---
No that's not how this work at all lol
---
The Classic answer you are given, when "Hardcore Vanilla players" can't give a better arguement. 
---
The horde have invaded Ashenvale and are destroying the ancestral lands of the Kaledorei.
---
That’s reason enough to take up arms.
---
it's just DnD games reference.
---
I did, nothing there. I played in vanilla and my brother was a priest and I cant remember that he was ever a ‘mana battery’ back then. 
---
Maybe you can give me a source? 
---
Then why are you replying to a comment about 5-man Loatheb? :)
---
The video in question shows the tank being healed by 4 Shadow Priests only. They do the entire fight with 5 people. That wasn't possible until 2.0 and Vampiric Touch. Of course Shadow Priests were used before then, but they needed to throttle their damage if they wanted their mana to last the entire fight. Less damage = less healing from VE = you actually needed 40 people to kill Loatheb.

Frostmourne oceanic? Wasn't around in vanilla all the Aussie played on blackrock horde. Frostmourne was introduced way later when OCE servers opened and wasn't when they were selling these old server blades
---
I'll even go so far to say I just want a new game designed in the spirit of vanilla. Like a dungeon finder IMO was the worst thing that ever happened to the game, but I'd be happy to have something like a LFG group listing tool accessible from the meeting stones and inside dungeons for replacements. Similar to how you find groups in GW2. The tool would not have any way to invite, you'd still have to PM the leader/person and communicate.

You're beautiful, its true!

Wrong I've played on frostmourne since the day I started playing wow in early wotlk
---
That's a very toxic answer to be honest. Is that really how you want to have a discussion? Everyone who makes a point can go play BfA and everyone else is allowed in the circlejerk?
---
Instead of just writing that very bad answer take his points and give your opinion on his points.
---
yeah the community is why I played this game. All my friends basically quit by Cata, the rest by MoP. I have maybe one friend left
---
Hopefully the community-driven design of classic WoW will help me make new friends
---
Like the touch from mother I am so damn comfortable I never want to leave it. 
---
Ivory Raptor begs to differ...
---
Such ignorance. Justhere explained it pretty good. More player mean more shards but also more contester for the resources. Less player mean less to no shards and the normal amount of resources. There won't be an overflooding of ore and herbs.
---
There are pretty good arguments against sharding and for more servers (which should be fused later but that's a different story). Resources and the artificial bottlenecking isn't one of them.
---
Can you explain this one a little? I'm confused on why you need to do the blessing of protection and stuff
---
There was no “old” mounts for undeads.
---
I don’t think OP thought this out very well before posting
---
We don’t want a massive deficit of ore or herbs, we want the game relaunched EXACTLY as it was in 2006 during patch 1.12 with the same level of herbs and ore as there was then. The thought process you’re following is exactly the thought process that got us to the fecal matter that is modern retail. “Why can’t this be easier?” “Why can’t we have that?” “Why does it take so long to level up?” There is a version of the game that will fulfill all of your needs for instant gratification, it’s called BFA and you can live out all of your dreams in that version. Please don’t pollute our beloved Classic game with your casual, progressive nonsense...
---
i looked it up and saw all of the different versions of the game you could buy.........................
---
no thanks
---
I’m riding the hype train too, so I’m having trouble entertaining myself ‘till classic releases. 
---
LOL
---
Nothing he said can be refuted by your about starting in wotlk?
---
And you just made an overstatement yourself  3 day long AVs were extremely uncommon. I rarely if ever saw them going over a day. I also prefaced my statement saying it was likely a strong opinion.
---
Dual spec or at least lessen the cost of doing a respec. Guild banks would be acceptable. I can see arguments for a few other things.
---
I am going to laugh so hard at Ret Paladins and stuff stuck in Org barking for group runs.
---
1k+ HKs fighting on the road - all I ever wanted out of Classic AV
---
=\
---
Feral. Heart of the Wild + Nature's Swiftness (0/30/21) is the gold standard, but it has basically 0 offensive power. Run 14/32/5 if you want to be able to kill things 1v1. 
---
People talk about 29/11/11 like it's some top secret spec but I'm not a fan of it. Balance spec makes you better at killing melee but it's a sitting duck against casters. You should steamroll melee as a Druid regardless of your spec. You don't need to spec Balance to beat them. Feral still beats melee consistently while also giving you a much better chance to beat casters thanks to the improved damage in Cat Form - something Balance struggles with.
---
When ice servers opened up??
---
Maybe I mis interpreted, I thought it implied when the servers actually moved to aus 
---
That's literally what a catchup set is... useless to people already raiding but an easy way for someone to get geared for intro raids.
---
Don’t think it works that way. The new client allows for more optimization, but the graphics itself have less polygons.
---
Exactly this.
---
The honor grind is reallllllllll
---
A quick Google doesn't have frostmourne on the list of server blades sold tho so maybe you got me there friend

“Unfair for the people who don’t have enough time to play”.

I remember in retail vanilla 1.12 going into AV and being able to farm for the R14 weapon. If this is true in Classic, then it will completely destroy the incentive to rank in PvP unless AV is not added until the late phases of patch progression, I cannot remember if this involved farming AV tokens for that purpose. Throughout most of vanilla, AV tokens were turned in for bonus Honor and nothing more.
---
Stupid.
---
Fucking esfand
---
Wall of text of fluffy nothings, ending with a poorly veiled "1.12 is for casual noobs". Lol sure convinced me
---
Everyone wanted 1.12 and you're getting it, when the fuck did people clarify they wanted a different version of AV? Few months before launch IS too late son, give your head a shake. 
---
Hehe I'm sorry.
---
I hope they make a comeback.  See you on the front lines Horde scum!
---
10 hours in and only 900hks? I was in one 2 days ago. 3 hours, 1100hks
---
If I HAD to craft a solution, it would be this:
---
First, make a business decision: are you staying Classic only, investing a little to add TBC and Wrath, or investing more money doing OSRS and creating new Classic content. 
---
Assuming it isn’t Classic only, create labels to go on each realm. Each server name should read like:
---
* US - Scilla (Classic Only) - PVP
---
* US - MalGanis (Progressive) - PVP
---
* US - Moonguard (Progressive) - RP-PVE
---
* US - Blackhand (Classic Only) - PVE
---
Etc etc.  The progressive servers are subject, at some undetermined point, to be forced to receive “the next stages” of Vanilla, whether that’s TBC or new content. Classic Only servers are frozen in time.
---
This decision really has to be made before Classic launches.
---
WoTF is annoying but it’s not as bad as having to deal with BOTH paladins AND priests constantly dispelling your DoTs!  Plus fear ward. WoTF has a CD, and a huge percent of Undead players don’t react to a activating it to stop you from recasting fear. Alliance warlocks have that stigma about WOTF so there’s less of them, and more loot for you. Gnome is a solid choice IMO 
---
Marks is only partically why you want to finish games quicker though. The main reason people rush AV is because you get your rewards for winning, nothing else really, so obviously you want to win faster. That still counts (but to less extend) without marks.
---
Morrowgrain and Traveler's Backpacks as well.
---
You can find that av on theoppositeofsouth-dale. &lt;-- remove the - and fix the first part to know the server name.
---
As someone who ground out the Vanilla PvP system to the top, helllllllllllllll no!
---
AV was fucking useless in that incarnation. The idea of it was cool at first but it was an extremely inefficient use of your time if you wanted to make any headway on your PvP rank.
---
1.12 made it so you could actually win through co-ordination. Taking charge and commanding your team to victory in AV was easily one of the most fulfilling experiences WoW offered me.
---
Prior to these changes, it was just one long slog that never seemed to end. Good in theory, terrible as a game.
---
So what does that make your post? At least what I've said can offer discussion. I never claimed for my opinion to be the one and only correct one to have.
---
I probably won't have time to play at lunch anyway so I'm not worried about it.
---
Mmmmmmm refreshment
---
Because there are little to no self-balancing mechanics in place I think that given enough time all servers will naturally lean towards imbalance.
---
Agreed. It was straight out of Tron. Dope af.
---
Marks buy gear in TBC. Marks in Vanilla are just turned in for more honor. You get more honor from playing the BG itself than the marks. 
---
&gt; but you'll still have people acting exactly how they do on reddit.
---
FTFY :)
---
lol, such a bold assumption
---
&gt; Marks is only partically why you want to finish games quicker though. The main reason people rush AV is because you get your rewards for winning, nothing else really,
---
Right. You get 2 additional marks for winning.
---
You could link footage of a group in pre-bis running MC in 45 minutes too. A hunter hitting 60 in 4 days.
---
Believe it or not, conquering the game is fun.
---
In my battle group AV was 30 afks and 10 people playing the actual game. It was frustrating because you knew you’d never get a fair full game 
---
Ok, stop moving the goal posts.
---
First you said "It's going to ruin the economy!!! It'll be completely unlike the leveling experience in the original game!!!!" To which I pointed out that it won't. It'll be closer to what the game was like once it hit steady-state and wasn't flooded with low level players. It won't flood the market, it won't make it easier to level, it just makes the game actually feel like classic out of the gate instead of "waiting for mobs to spawn simulator 2019".
---
Now, your point is "I JUST DON'T WANT CHANGES, THIS MAKES IT BFA" which it just obviously doesn't.
---
Is it renewable from quest giver? Or is it a one shot quest?
---
Yes
---
While some items are powerful, they also cost the same or if not more than say a Lionheart's Helm or other high end craftables, nevermind the actual effort of going through all say 25 quests and collecting the initial Dungeon Set 1.
---
Its just another path for gearing, like PvP rank/rep grinding or Raid PvE progression. Its just small group PvE and likewise its stats are not based around just 1 role.  Raid PvE gear for hybrids is almost exclusively focus for healing, warriors for tanking, while PvP is based around high stamina and damage.  Dungeon Set 2, as such its gear is very generalist. Not enough Hit% to excel is PvE raids, and not enough stamina to excel in PvP.
---
Exceptions prove the rule, and just because 1 or 2 classes have a couple noteworthy items of interest, the vast majority of the items (the other 68 individual pieces of gear) are not so great or easily out classed by DM Blues, 1.10 gear loot table reworks, or just blown away by raid sets (appropriately) and pvp epics.
---
To counter that, what's the rush? The more time something takes makes things more coveted. Back then it was always awesome to see people decked out knowing it took time and effort. Look at BFA, that feel is gone because everything, relatively speaking, takes very little time to obtain in comparison.
---
It couldn't be just tuning talents. For instance, if you want Paladins to be viable tanks, they need the ability from TBC where they got mana back upon being healed. 
---
Ultimately, nothing prepares you for learning your class like constantly failure. I’d suggest that you acquire a sword and board at level 15 and rank RFC/VC again and again. Tank every chance you get.
---
By the time you get to 40, you’ll have the experience to see bad pulls and wipes a mile away. If you wait until 40, you may be over inundated by both the spell options and additional attention required to tank a ZF or Mara.
---
There’s nothing better than learning on the job in those first few dungeons. V
---
Buy two accounts and play both helping your warrior to 60. You can grind nonstop and then pick on at 60. Yeah, it costs more initially but you can dump an account after 30 days or how ever long you need to level. I two boxed a warrior and shaman for a while in vanilla and it was pretty awesome, though I hate questing. Most people hate grinding.
---
One of the many things no one knows for certain.
---
I don't recall buying gear with tokens until 2.0/TBC
---
From my recollection, AV tokens were used for bonus honor in vanilla.
---
A small squad (5-10 people) is the counter to an all out rush by the other team, and WILL win you the game.  An offense of 30 people versus 0 defense will win every time versus the 40 man rush versus 10 defenders at strategic points.  
---
It's a nice alignment chart reference but it makes no sense. Not even all Paladins are LG. 
---
Please use the weekly (Monday) LFG sticky post or checkout the Recruitment channel in the r/ClassicWoW Discord. Thank you!
---
Am i the only one that had that shit turned off?
---
I had an alert sound for someone joining/leaving, but never had it say the name.
---
Then you've not played much an hybrid class while doing something else than healing. I myself believe that no matter the offspecs you have (as long as it's not most of your raid and that we're not talking about protection paladin), a raid can do fine until naxx no matter what. BUT :
---
* The protection paladin tree is useless in 40 man raids, and even in 5 mans you're not tanking well because of the protection tree except 2-3 talents. It could have a taunt, have mana management talents. Most can be solved without itemization change.
---
* The ret talent tree could use a few revamp/additions to make it better, not necessarily higher dps, but more consistent / active abilities and with more incentive to take it in raid for support
---
* Moonkin lacks mana management tools, and does not bring enough to the table to bother bringing it either.
---
* I am not knowledgeable enough on feral, shadow priest and shaman but there are reasons why they are not really wanted in raid. Again, to me it won't break your raid if you bring a few of those in it, but there should be advantages (and disadvantages) of bringing at least 1-2 of those in raids, so that it makes sense.
---
Why would you assume Blizzard would make such small servers?
---
&gt; Marks buy gear in TBC. Marks in Vanilla are just turned in for more honor. 
---
That's true. I couldn't remember if the direct gear purchase was in 1.12 or 2.01.
---
Stop posting secrets, fool.
---
Lol, okay sick job deleting both your comment where you claimed to be a Vanilla pro from starting WoW in 2015 on a private server, and then the followup where you claimed I made this thread, which I obviously did not. I commented, I didn't make this post.
---
Enjoy the block list buddy.
---
Not to mention, at least going by pserv values, those drops gave FUCKALL for rep and just distracted people.
---
Exactly, the warrior is the most hypocritical case.
---
&gt;You might just have to accept that the old glorious AV just cannot be recreated.
---
People also need to recognize that old AV definitely was *not* glorious to many people, but instead just an unending, unfun time sink. I happened to like it, but I can definitely see the majority of the Vanilla population preferring 1.12 AV, which is why they picked it.
---
I never got into LUA hooks back in the day, but I was also much much younger and less experienced.  I'm seriously considering getting into Classic Mod-making for the sole purpose of creating server database blacklists if noone creates a blacklist mod.
---
Makes it so the warrior can't do anything
---
Well he’s alliance, so what can you do?
---
I saw one of these on display near my old home in Rochester NY at the Play Museum, was honestly beyond amazing to stand next to one of the legendary vanilla servers all signed by the teams that ran it :)
---
*tips helm*
---
I know Holy Pallies are the healing spec, that's what I want to do - they're probably the best PVP healers out there which is neato. Levelling isn't as bad as it's made out to be either if you abuse reckoning and they're one of the best classes for duo or group levelling too.
---
Heck, Arthas was a Paladin.
---
lol what if I don't want to fly to Thunderbluff or farm Un'Goro? :)
---
craZy, had a very similar experience exception I was an Orc hunter. solo-grinded leveling and always had fun spamming BGs along the way.  I too am looking to roll woryer, I've never tanked though. Is it really that much easier to get fury tanking and spamming dungeons rather than leveling via quests as dps? I just joined my first pserver ever after unsubbing to retail and fell utterly back inlove with the game. Vanilla is what I've been missing and retail was no where need providing that. With that being said I am super hyped about Classic and am in a similar boat as you, just cant figure out if I want to go orc or human 
---
here are your choices for launch day
---
a) 2 hour queue times
---
b) lots of dead servers post launch
---
c) sharding for 10 levels for launch
---
wow what a hard fucking choice
---
Streamers are simply an example people can easily understand when showing how quickly you can be trolled during Classic's launch.
---
On top of that I want Classic to be successful and hopefully bring in new players now that they can experience WoW's story from start to present.
---
I don't like any of Asmongold's content, but I'd be stupid if I didn't recognize his influence. He said on stream that WoW was terrible and suddenly 2k people "woke" and flocked to reddit anxious to share the new gospel.
---
Streamers, like sharding, are a necessary evil if we want Classic to be played by more than just a few hundred nostalgic old men.
---
Vampiric touch talent in the old talent tree, restores mana
---
things are happening, man.
---
The seeds are sold in Thunderbluff but it sucks when you run out and don't feel like traveling all the way there. The turn-in is repeatable for rep.
---
I don't mind farming Un'Goro Soil because it stacks so high but I absolutely hate running out of seeds.

Make a priest and level shadow at 40, prior to that holy w wand and spirit tap.  Then at 60 go holy/disc so you can get the spirit buff from disc tree, spell power from spirit, and 10% plus heals. Your healing gear set will have +heal BUT...you also collect +spell power gear and you can farm with that.  Holy grinding with good gear is not bad. Tip a mage to buy good water and you can nuke shit fine, or just go tailor enchantment profs and run a lot of instances. People will run RR strath runs for orbs and that’s more fun than grinding mobs. Or pick flowers. Trust me, priest is perfectly fine holy with spell power.
---
0 dead servers on launch, if anything, they will need to open more servers. I'm absolutely willing to wait for a queue. No sharding, period.
---
Yeah, clearly Tips is making videos because he likes making them, not because he just wants to do 10:01 and get ad revenue
---
&gt; People just seem to not realize the playerbase wont be complete dogshit again.
---
Having played on a pserv recently, I'd say that you're off the mark there lol.  The top end is better for sure and the average player is better on average, but there's still a metric fuckton of dogshit players.
---
Yeah, that was a TBC thing.
---
Mage. Sell portals and run 5 mans casually, no problems grinding.

\-sigh- Did you play from day one? When the servers launched? Did you have a charakter with herbelisem or mining back then? I'm all in for classic and let it be like it was but that won't work. You know why? Back then only a few people knew that you can learn different professions. Server crashed a lot and many people couldn't even log in. There was simply no competition. You loged in, farmed ten minutes and got kicked from the game. You waited, loged in again and gathered the respawned herbs/ore. 
---
That was casual, that was easy. WoW was never meant to have such a sucess. 15 years later will be way more progressiv with stable servers, well known strategies and guides as it was ever before. Sure I'm all in for classic but then you have to delete all memories and bring back unstabel servers. 
---
I'll never forget Nostalrius. We made groups of 10 and hunted plainstriders in the barrens.
---
stop presenting speculation as facts
---
A july release is very likely, so don't worry.
---
Ya there was a lot of dick tanks mainly because they got used to the end of wotlk speed pulls. I pally tanked so I helped the healers a lot with my broke word of glory heals.
---
Charge is really good to get away though. Charge critter/npc -&gt; travel form 
---
i was just basing my comment on the threads i see here every time i check lol
---
Bruh, these are the root WoW was built on.  You basically called Neanderthals dumb.
---
congrats buddy, but adults with things to do would rather not have to wait 2 hours to play a 15 year old game. 
---
short queues will be fine later on after the retail players leave, but at launch it will just make people play something else instead of classic. 
---
You could rush in every version of AV. With the knowledge we have now, the version never mattered. The end result will be two things: a rush game or mass AFKs fishing for a fresh game.
---
I know :P
---
epic meme bro wow haha
---
GREEN HILLS OF STRANGLETHORN 
---
Exactly in TBC! 
---
In vanilla Vampiric Touch did not exist. 
---
Might want to google that. 
---
Nothing will carry over into retail. Is what they have said so far atleast.
---
Dead servers *post* launch.
---
This guy funs.
---
Nope. If you have the time, availability and a rig that can handle raids, then D2 is a massive waste of time. You can pug ZG twice a week and MC once a week in dungeon blues to get better gear in less time.
---
D2 is for people who are doing solo and dungeon content with no intention or means of raiding at the 20 or 40 man level but have time to spare.
---
Perhaps late on a geared raider with cash to spare could boost an alt through some of the grindier parts, but the alt would still need full tier 0 in the first place, which is a huge time investment compared to getting a passable pre raid blue set and jumping into pug raid which will be commonplace at that point. 
---
&gt; I rarely if ever saw them going over a day.
---
Anecdotal
---
&gt; I also prefaced my statement saying it was likely a strong opinion
---
This is pure conjecture.
---
I mean, its one city out of...what...12 now?  Maybe more?
---
Just looked up the server he mentioned.  Its an RP server, so there IS NO SHARDING.  The server is 65% alliance (at 111-120), so 35% of the population wouldnt be in SW for any reason.
---
Also, im on a fairly dead server on live.  We have one guild that has more than one boss down in mythic (they have 4, everyone else has 1 or none).  My server has about 90% of the population of the server he said hes on.
---
Compare that to actual active servers and its night and day.  Stormrage has 6.2 times as many players.  Sargeras has over 5x as many....and thats for Alliance dominated realms when Horde is the more popular PvE faction by far.
---
Okay, so what does that make your 3-Day long comment?  To keep this pointed, what are you trying to add to the discussion?
---
No you get honor and rep for winning..
---
Really depends on your target framerate and how much you want everything cranked.
---
I'm hoping there's 165hz support even with the old models. 
---
A main tank not using consumables is just laughably penny pinching considering how massively it benefits the raid for the cost.
---
I will not hear your blasphemous swill, nonbeliever!
---
I want them! Make them available till second content patch.
---
Is this a troll
---
I'm not a fan either but I can see why people enjoy it. I don't like either AV once I'm ranked and exalted with AV I won't eveer play it.
---
I'm curious. How popular *was* WoW on launch day?
---
So in Vanilla, without killing Galv/Balinda + destroying Towers, Vandar is easily killable ?
---
I thought the "buff" system was already in place so you had at least to wait a bit.... Damn people are gonna do this everytime then :(
---
/sit macros for reckoning stacks won't work in classic. That is a private server thing, and wasn't a thing in original vanilla WoW. Sadly gonna have to do it the old way, just hitting things over and over and refreshing your seals 
---
I second this and am also wondering. Would be great if everyone started at ground zero. Imagine the beautiful chaos of old within those starter zones the first few days lol
---
Some of us enjoy maximizing our fun/honor rather than our honor/hr and find actual pvp battles fun.
---
It's not the version I was hoping for, but it is a version that existed during that era so I'm not too bothered by it. I really wish I could collect some night elf heads, though.
---
BfA is there for you :)
---
My friend also likes to say that prot warrior isn't so bad to level. he never gets a raidspot.
---
PS aren’t  retail. Retail was a completely different experience. PS popped up after people had already been accustomed to the bullshit Zerg strats. After classic I’m sure the community would be more then accepting of a day long BG, however that is conjecture and optimism and I do have a personal bias. Time will tell I suppose 
---
That would be 2nostalgia
---
Let's just asume you are not a troll. Yes, everyone will start back from zero. No gold, no alts, nothing.
---
Does anyone care about retail anymore? 
---
Also depends massively on the guild you're in and how many consumables you want to use.
---
Realistically, if you're in a guild can't do the content, it's not the gear that's the problem so consumables aren't really going to help the issue.
---
I'd suggest that 90% of guilds aren't going to require you to be drugged up to the eyeballs on pots and flasks, so most of the time raiding is going to cost you repair bills and not much more.
---
More dots!
---
They were placeholders for the replacement mounts. They were removed from the vendors. 
---
It’s not that big of a deal either way, but it really doesn’t make sense to include them since they were so rare to see back then. Instead of seeing the actual epic mounts we saw back in the day, we’ll see these mounts that post 1.4 were really rare to come across. Just doesn’t give the right representation of vanilla in my opinion.
---
I hope it comes out in August. 
---
New stat they added at some point.  I forget what turned into vers....defense?  armor pen?  Maybe a combo of a few of them they got rid of?
---
Its kind of lame.  Just a flat damage increase/damage taken decrease.
---
Feign Death. The hunter can reset the pull if it goes pear-shaped, can CC for 30sec, can slow/snare the entire pull and can do some deepps all while the tank gets on the threat list and other forms of CC are employed by squishier classes (sheep/shackle/banish).
---
Like I said in a perfect world.
---
&gt; Okay, so what does that make your 3-Day long comment?
---
Hyperbole to showcase how poorly designed AV was when first implemented.  A BG shouldn't take hours to complete, never mind days, thus why Blizzard tweaked it several times between 1.5 and the Burning Crusade pre-patch.
---
I'm pointing out how absurd your quote is. Equating people who want the updated version of AV, which was on live servers longer than the 1.5 version, to wanting a "watered down" or "fake" version of Classic is ridiculous.
---
Im not sure you will be able to obtain the raptor until they patch in the runecloth turn ins. There is not enough rep through quests alone to reach exalted
---
not bad but not a necessity in mass pvp. if you're standing 40 yards away from enemy and just healing you're not going to be hit much. And if enemy team close that range and you're forced to retreat, your team is probably losing the fight anyway. charging to get away in that situation is not going to do much, and that's assume you have something to charge behind you. Nature's focus to heal through the aoe and nature's reach is more beneficial in a fight like this. 
---
Ah well auto-attacking it is. All the same I'm still going to be playing a paladin, and I wasn't really asking whether I should play paladin in the first place.
---
Some fights require consumes.
---
For example if you're a healer on patch, you're going to be dropping 3 to 5 major mana pots, mageblood pots, etc.
---
If you're trying to progress on cthun, you'll likely be dropping nature protection pots and shadow protection pots.
---
And so forth.
---
Consumes sometimes make the difference between success and failure when you're trying to squeeze past that line.
---
With no loot
---
The real question is, who turned up his volume? 🤔
---
ofc not. there is a wheel of fortune, first 1000 account gets to spin it. youll receive value between 10-1000 gold
---
Not everyone had these. Almost everyone switched to the new models, and everyone who bought an epic mount after april 2015 could only get the new models. These mounts were only available for a very short period of time, so saying that everyone had these is simply not true.
---
Look up the term 
---
I really wish that *this* was how they implemented catch-up gear in later expansions. High quality gear doesn't *have* to require raiding but it *should* require work.
---
What's AV. I know I'm noob but Classic is all I've played and I want to be ready for release
---
i think i know what you mean. the guild decides whats best for the guild?
---
Start shooting with your bow, dear rogue :D
---
&gt; Streamers are simply an example people can easily understand when showing how quickly you can be trolled during Classic's launch.
---
I dont think anyone is gonna bother trolling random players at launch.
---
&gt; On top of that I want Classic to be successful and hopefully bring in new players now that they can experience WoW's story from start to present.
---
Its not like games didn't succed a before streamers was a thing.
---
I want classic to suceed too, but not at the cost of catering to streamers. The streamers exist for the game, not the other way around. 
---
&gt; I don't like any of Asmongold's content, but I'd be stupid if I didn't recognize his influence. He said on stream that WoW was terrible and suddenly 2k people "woke" and flocked to reddit anxious to share the new gospel.
---
And this is exactly the problem with streamers. Many times is their specific gripe/need for the way THEY play the game and *MAKE THEIR LIVING*, amplified by a bunch of religious followers, who as you point out, treat it as gospel. Doesn't mean its what is best for the game and everyone else.
---
&gt; Streamers, like sharding, are a necessary evil if we want Classic to be played by more than just a few hundred nostalgic old men.
---
This sub has 55k subscribers. 
---
I'd say the worst on your list, for things you listed you want to enjoy, would be rogue. Hunters and mages will be better for world pvp and farming. They will so have an easier time getting into dungeons. Rogue is one of bigger min/max try hard classes. Additionally you mentioned warlock or spriest. Spriests are GODS in wpvp, and warlocks are insane as well. Warlocks are like magical hunters, except more wanted. I feel like warlock would be a good balance between Hunter/mage/spriests. They can farm well too.
---
yes because "calm your tits nerd" deserves a quantum revolution in comebacks
---
&gt;Then you've not played much an hybrid class while doing something else than healing.
---
How can I take you seriously when you make such a huge assumption about me without knowing me or what I've done in the game? What if I have those things you claim I haven't? What if I told you I've tanked and cleared Naxxramas as Feral Druid, DPSed as Retribution Paladin and Elemental Shaman?
---
Our guild has had every wonky spec under the sun in our raids like Protection Paladin, Enhancement Shamans or Balance Druid and it was fine. If you have a guild filled with experience raiders and everybody shows up to raid fully prepared it didn't matter to us if they under-performed. As long as you don't stack your raid with too many meme specs you can get through any content just fine. 40 man raids were never so damn hard that there was no room for slack.
---
Minus the aggressiveness, why did it take you so long to form an actual, debatable opinion? 
---
Poorly designed, and shouldn't last a length of time is a matter of your opinion that you're entitled to. You also must acknowledge a fair number of people disagree with you. Is there a workable compromise that you could make or is that non-negotiable? I made another comment about having AV be progressive through its patches as they are presumably with all the rest of the content. Could that be a satisfactory middle ground?
---
Day 1 Classic Launch, yes it's a clean slate.
---
Are you asking if players can transfer characters into new realms that spring up well after launch?  The answer is we don't know.
---
Any new fresh realms should be blocked from transfers for a period of time for server health.  But there's no way to know yet.
---
Identity theft is not a joke, Jim!
---
Right. That's how a lot of people felt. 
---
Thank you for posting. This made my day. &lt;3 It is just beautiful, I can't explain more than that.
---
If you're playing current WoW on it, you are good.  When classic releases it will basically just be selecting a Classic Server from the server list I would imagine.  Why would you need another PC just to play the game you're already playing on your MAC?
---
Short answer: No it won't.  
---
Reason: Free realm transfers (happened in 2005 as well).
---
/thread
---
Hi, /u/catastrophicprophet
---
Sharding shouldn't have much of an impact on the economy. The extra supply should be offset by the extra demand from the number of people playing.
---
As for when that higher population moves over to non-sharded zones. The whole argument behind sharding at launch is a lot of people never make it past the first couple of zones which is going to be even more true for Classic because you're going to get a lot of people who just want to check out what the hype is all about. The population should naturally shrink to a manageable level.
---
Thanks for the lecture, very detailed insight here and lots of good information. I rate this summary a 7/10.
---
I read "can we get a fridge already" LoL
---
But a small and handy frigde besides the pc would be nice nonetheless
---
I guess it’s the same result guys... multiplication is commutative.
---
X * 1.25 * 3.6
---
I guess...
---
No, they will be restoring your characters from 15 years ago, giving you all your gear back and letting you wear that gear from level 1.
---
1) The rest of the game won’t be 1.12 for the entire duration of classic - raids, world bosses, dungeons, and certain gear that were available during 1.12 will be phased in slowly.
---
2) There are only 5 or so “versions” to choose from it’s not like Bertie botts every flavored beans where there’s literally thousands of options. Some people see advantages to the different iterations, which they can discuss, but nearly everyone who wants a version prior to 1.12 at least wants a version that can’t be zerged. While zergability is good for getting loot, it makes for a repetitive and bland experience, not entirely different from retail AV, and for is in such a state for similar design reasons. The only significant difference between retail and 1.12 is the addition of reinforcements, which doesn’t impact zergability, it only ensures that prolonged games can not occur. 
---
Yea, these mounts should be in Classic at the start then removed later in one of the content patches
---
&gt; it really doesn’t make sense to include them since they were so rare to see back then.
---
Dude... rare rewards were one of the best parts of old school WoW.
---
I gotta say, I’m confused. Seemed like a legitimate question to me. I’m curious why multiple people thought he was a troll?
---
If you actually have 10 hours to spare for an AV (assuming you've aged like I have), you should probably spend less time on video games.
---
I think you overestimate the amount of people who will get these. Remember, the classic wow subreddit is probably less than 1% of the actual playerbase who will be in game, and not even all of us will be getting it. I will be though.
---
Everything he said made sense. Have you ever done a port to get code that ran on an old system to work on a new system?
---
You have no idea what you are talking about
---
You're delusional
---
amazing
---
:)
---
Mage and rogue would be hard to be effective with high ping. Hunter wouldn't be too bad as you're not as ping reliant as you don't have an interrupt or on demand stun and usually defend in premades. Hunter is also really good at low gear levels and fairly easy to get gear on. If you get 8/8 T1 + Rhok'delar you're in a really good spot for the entirety of classic. Upgrading past mc gear isn't going to make that big of a difference for you in pvp due to the 8/8 set bonus (15% multishot damage). Xbow from chromaggus is one of the only exceptions that come to mind, but I'm sure there's more. I could usually kill 90% of people in bgs with aimed shot &gt; auto &gt; multi shot with that xbow and giantstalker. 
---
Well if we take into account the time between posts we can see they have been incrementing in exponential fashion. Given the limited number of relevant information pieces that can still be revealed before they run out of topics and the exponential rate of increase, I say it's just around the corner. Specifically, 👉🏻 that corner.
---
Frostmourne definitely existed in Vanilla as a separate category of servers for oceanic players. Albeit coming around a little later it was there. I can confirm this because that's where I first started playing WoW back in  2005.
---
I was wondering about that too honestly, looking back.
---
Maybe I just switched action bars or something, I have no idea what I was thinking!
---
Balance druid is in the same situation. Shadow priest, at a certain point, is similar because its dps is inferior to a lot of real dps specs. Why would ret paladin be allowed changes and not those specs I mentioned?? The slippery slope exists. 
---
And don't you think it would be dumb for Blizz to release Classic in its former glory, with no changes, "except for ret paladins balancing because of arbitrary reasons" (even though balance druid is in an even worse spot).
---
&gt;but human weapon specialization for raiding is hard to give up.
---
is it really?
---
Yeah. I really don't get it, the model themselves are "meh".
---
Faps are purgable/dispellable, w.e. When I was flag running, I would have to cover my faps with trash buffs so my faps wouldn't be instantly removed.
---
As for funding faps? Welcome to the struggle bud. You just gotta farm mobs or materials with herb/mine/skin, or get lucky with a rare profession recipe. You could try to farm crusader enchant or something similar to sell on the ah. But no one is gonna be paying much money for anything, which will also allow you to purchase cheap faps too, so it sorta balances.
---
I was lucky and had a premade throwing faps at me to run flags.
---
Er, exactly? These can’t be implemented without ruining the rarity aspect.
---
Boy some people sure get envious that not every class gets to perform exactly equally in every single way possible like they do on retail WoW.
---
Oh wait, the classes don't perform the same on retail WoW and they never have!
---
If there's anything I've learned from reading forums like this one it's that people use the class balance fallacy as a shield that they hide behind when they really just want their own personal favorite class to be the best.
---
Oh ppl weren't very sharp back then and wouldn't click it off immediately lmao
---
Don't worry, by the time you make it to 55, DM will be out.
---
That's a terrible point, then. Why not make the Scarab Lord title available only if the gong is rung within a hour after the war effort ends? I mean, exactly how long does it take you to fly to Silithus anyway?
---
Nice work.
---
However, the Stormrage 3 set bonus looks off. At what patch does it get changed to 15% mana regeneration while casting? Currently, the latest version using your search is 1.5 which still has mana reduction on shapeshifting.
---
Would be nice to have them as an option, and just leave them in the game. I personally never liked the look of the armored mounts.
---
&gt; Paladin, my only question are what are my ways of making gold beside from gathering
---
DME lasher farm
---
its a group of mid 50s non elites
---
&gt;Not everyone had these. Almost everyone switched
---
Use your head.  You can't switch from something you didn't have.  You're contradicting yourself.
---
&gt;These mounts were only available / so saying that everyone had these is simply not true.
---
Again, a contradiction.  Everyone had them, because there was no alternative for a period of time.  So that means everyone had them.
---
An OPTIONAL alternative was released.  Not everyone took that OPTION.  Someone in 2004 may have PREFERRED armored mounts then, and just like 2004, some players today would PREFER prefer to have unarmed today.  It was an OPTION and we should be given, once again, the same OPTION.
---
I love this kind of screenshots so much, they are a relic of time and you can almost imagine how it was playing back then 
---
If these are the only mounts in the beginning, then everyone who buys an epic mount will have one... Not a correct representation of how it actually was back then.
---
I'd go orc if it wasn't for not having salvation + dps buffs. With shaman you have to choose between windfury or threat reduction.
---
For tanking, make a macro to mark a skull. Thunderclap doesn't do much threat so don't waste your rage on it. If DPS doesn't focus the skull, politely ask them to dps the skull. Second time, they do it just let the mob hit them a few times. They'll learn!
---
It'll be easier to gear the lock. Ele is fun in the world, but you need some sp gear (DS2 is good).
---
Why take them out at all? Just to arbitrarily create scarcity?
---
It was a joke. The hardware of those old server blades is outdated, or why do you think they even replaced and put them up for auctions?
---
I totally understand what you mean... I want to play something that is somewhat needed in 5 mans. It would be cool to make friends and generally be helpful to others. Warrior is a top choice for that. You are the most needed role for 5/10 mans. Being a decent tank is very satisfying too and will just make people like you more. There is something visually appealing about it too. I remember always looking at geared warriors with some envy. If you can make some healer friends you can smash in pvp. 
---
Healers are not really as needed as tank. Mage is actually a solid choice for this sort of role too. Making water, porting after the 5 man, having amazing cc are all great for 5/10 mans. 5 mans will always be looking for a mage.
---
I'm hoping to have some of the same effect with candles. That's pretty awesome though. 
---
For me my strongest memories are linked with music. I'm a big music guy and when some songs come on my playlists or whatever from 04-07 I get hit hard by nostalgia. So I'm working on a playlist now haha 
---
Thank God i’m EU.
---
Careful friend, people here don’t take to kindly towards Mr. Tips around these parts.
---
What do you mean? He asked if a brand new game release started fresh or if you start with alts and gold?? When the new pokemon comes out do you think you start with 3 badges and a lvl 24 starter???
---
45 comments in 2 days with a high percentage of salty replies, impressive. Maybe I should spend the 10 hours on reddit like you.
---
Why is Ron Jeremy making Classic WoW videos?
---
For reference, the computer I raided with back in '05 had 256 mb RAM, a 40 gig HDD and I don't even remember the processor but it was a signle core one probably at 1 GHz. I mean sure I had like 1-2 FPS but compare those specs to even the shittiest computer today and they're light years away.
---
You'll be fine on your Mac.
---
Is it weird that I see this item, and I get flashbacks. But I can't remember any quest items from any expansions?
---
&gt;Its not like games didn't succeed a before streamers was a thing. I want classic to succeed too, but not at the cost of catering to streamers. The streamers exist for the game, not the other way around.
---
I agree with you.
---
If Blizzard decided to add Twitch or Twitter integration into Classic I would be handing out pitchforks and torches.
---
However, I still say Sharding is necessary for a smooth launch, especially when you account for all the tourist who'll only try the game the game in hopes Senpai will notice them.
---
Yeah I mean I bear tanked and tanked some raids as a warrior so I was pretty aware of them being dicks haha. Sort of thing where they don't say shit in chat and just run off and pull things expecting everyone to "not be noobs" 
---
I'm hopeful that if I get back into classic wow the community will be a little more tight and personable. People aren't going to play classic to do top end raiding as if it were a new release I don't think so I'm thinking it'll be a bit more chatty and just having fun with the old grind your ass off, &lt;90,000 crit damage times lol
---
I didn't say that all the specs need to perform equally. I'm honestly not sure why you're acting like I did. However, there's a huge middle ground between being absolutely awful and being the best. There's plenty of room for the worst specs to be improved a bit without being top tier. They don't need to try to make ret paladin, balance druid, or either shaman dps spec competitive. In fact, it's probably better that they don't try to do that so they don't overshoot and make them too good. But they could aim for, say, 20% below that instead of being 50% below.
---
Bfa rogue is waaaaaaay better than vanilla rogue. Hunter and mages will have an easier time grouping for dungeons and raids. Less gear competition for pre bis too. Also you'll have an easier time leveling and world pvping as a hunter or mage. Rogues are EXTREMELY CD dependent, and those CDs are 10mins.
---
Finally, someone got what I was asking for. 
---
Thank you kind sir!
---
Essentially, you can go into AV at level 51, run around farming for a while and then when your faction wins collect your quest reward with very little effort. Yay! Don't you feel like a special snowflake now?
---
You miss/parry less I believe, and this is before hit rating was a thing so it was actually really nice. 
---
Yeah I found out about WoW Classic yesterday.  Not sure what everyone is on about.
---
Starting with a fresh slate sounds great.  But transferring in characters with piles of gold would suck for balance.  
---
Looking forward to the imminent alignment arguments.
---
I've done plenty of fights (even raid fights) with only a tank and healer.  I can't recall succeeding on any boss fights with only DPS.
---
while rogue and hunter dont really need to respec
---
mages indeed make a lot more gold especially ZG farming and compared to rogue
---
Funniest part is I could legitimately believe real Dwight making that statement wrt korrak!
---
You know on the Druids not fighting over Druids thing, I used to level with my older cousin and when we were in STV I distinctly remember we were fighting everything and everyone except this one druid we came across who he we waved at.and wouldn't fight because of something to do with moonglade.
---
Maybe it was like a old superstition back on the day because he was always worried about our rep for some reason.
---
hard agree. they also shouldn't implement rivendare's charger, as more people know how to perfectly gear and play their class and thus will be able to reliably clear strat faster, thus having more chances at the mount and making it less rare. fuck it lets get rid of benediction and rhok'delar too
---
(obvious /s)
---
You should be tanking at every level as you level up, you can tank as arms just fine with a shield/sword. 
---
Disclaimer:  This may work on a private server (but probably not) and should not be tried on Classic WoW
---
Based on other comments you've made I'd suggest some kind of dock/stand for the Mac that has fans to help cool it down, you may want to get a keyboard as well so that you don't have to touch the hot keys on the keypad (do Macs support USB keyboards? I honestly don't know). ORRRRR you could do what I've been doing recently and get super obsessed with small form factor pc's, shoutout r/sffpc.
---
Says there guy posting "most people guess".
---
Assuming you are able to find this reddit you should have some experience with World of Warcraft or games in general. Maybe it's me or the other persons who called him a troll but somehow I thought when you start something fresh, something from point zero there shouldn't even be the question if it is possible to bring gold from  transfered alts. New items which weren't obtainable, pets, mounts, all the new stuff. How would you filter it out of the classic world with transfered chatakters?
---
Maybe OP is still very young and has no experiance with MMO's. That was the reason why I wrote more then just troll.
---
By that time we'll be playing Classic WoW :')
---
Bye bye Reddit
---
There won't be any ret paladins in orgrimmar, my man.
---
How do I get a friend?
---
just do it. you'll figure it out, it's not super hard.
---
Thanks!  I'll try and post a select few over the coming days.
---
It's nice to have at least some small memories of mine from those long ago days.
---
They're all pretty raw, unedited and very much spur of the moment, so they might not be all that exciting: but it does give a little glimpse into how it was back then.
---
Until his judgement was swayed and his alignment shifted. Paladins are traditionally lawful good.
---
You obv already know this since you played rogue vanilla to bfa, but bfa rogue is much stronger than they were in vanilla, especially compared to warriors. Warriors do more dmg, easier time gearing, easier time grouping, probably easier leveling than a rogue if you know what your doing (swing timer + mob kite), etc etc. Warriors are even better in the vanilla pvp scene (rogues literally defend flags, because they aren't great in group pvp).
---
All that said, I'd still choose rogue, simply because that's what I enjoy more. I've never had the desire to play a warrior.
---
Arthas is just Warcraft's Anakin Skywalker.
---
My lord that was a brain fart, but any meme spec will make me laugh. I wanted to say Balance but I cant recall if it had a hope! 
---
Ah that's right but it was just label OCE and was still hosted in US so everyone still just played on blackrock
---
 the initial talk was about the company making billions in general, not specifically from wow alone. *they are a billion $ profit company, i wouldn't call that "some profit"*.
---
making a billion from classic is beyond a wet dream. :) 
---
If you want my classic experience: create a rogue, level with daggers only and never buy evasion and vanish.
---
Level to lvl 60. 
---
That is my original flavor. 
---
Enjoy.
---
But I guess you ruined yourself with too many guides already. 
---
You would carry tgese with you and grow seeds every hour the  turn morrowgrain in to Thunderbluff or pressumably the night elves for other faction.
---
&gt; To be honest with you it just sounds like you want a different game from what you're getting. Classic has its flaws and a lot of people like it for all that it is. 
---
What about the AV discussion that is happening on this very thread which is the reason for what I wrote? Lol
---
Your answer to my comment doesn't adress any of the issues I said neither how they are different to advocating for a non-1.12 AV. It's exactly the same kind of matter. I already said that I myself do not mind about playing an offspec in raid or having some, it's even the contrary. But I think that way more because it's a game that has fantasy in it and that gameplay is important, and that no one should be prevented to play what he wants even in 40 mans raids.
---
Non 1.12 AV and 1.12 AV are 2 different things subject to preference. The same can be said between Vanilla talents and TBC talents. That's my only point. If you are advocating for one saying the other doesn't deserve to be touched, then you are an hypocrite.
---
Weapon skill reduces glancing blows in vanilla, which ends up being a huge dps increase in pve. I don't care much about min/maxing racials, but sword skill really is too good to pass up.
---
They could always do free trials for new players like they have in the past. Marketing on Facebook and Twitter could reach the younger crowd. I’m not sure the younger crowd would enjoy classic and I’m also not sure Blizzard wants to heavily market Classic. I’d be thrilled if they went balls to the wall with marketing though, I Hope Classic is a major success like OSRS was for Jagex. Regarding sharding I believe that it is okay for the launch. I know it takes away from the experience of Classic but at the same time if a completely new player logs on at launch because Classic was so hyped they are going to attempt to play for maybe 10 minutes and give up because the starting zones will be extremely over populated. Maybe I am underestimating the launch but I expect it to be to packed to actually do anything
---
Just assuming youre not trolling ...
---
You know what WoW Classic is? Its not the current WoW just set to Level 1 for everyone. Its the very first game that came out in 2004 before any Expansion got released.
---
People need to stop acting like vanilla is going to have the same learning curve as if it's a fresh game. 5 man's were hard because people *didn't* know their class, and resources were WAY more limited than they are today. Most mechanics were brand new to players then, but compared to the expacs, vanilla has pretty basic mechanics. Not to mention, it took a good computer and decent internet to have nice framerates and a low ping, which isnt a problem 15 years in the future. 
---
Right. Everyone who bought an epic mount until april 2015 had one of these. How many do you think actually did that? Look at the [playerbase graph](https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/1241945255815773287.png) for vanilla. And then realise that almost everyone that had one of these mounts switched to a new model, resulting in almost not seeing these mounts anywhere during the remaining period of classic.
---
We'll see these mounts EVERYWHERE for the whole period of classic even if they're just released for a few months in the beginning. Not a correct representation of vanilla.
---
dps buffs? What about orc racials such as axe special + rage? yea windfury is somewhat of a factor given that's what your shaman drops over threat reduction, i would agree. 
---
Really appreciate the tips!
---
Farming frostwolf rep would be easier with all the quests they removed in 1.12 j/s
---
You don't grind AV for ranking, go spam WSG or AB if you are trying to rank. 
---
Or you're on the far side or Org doing some blacksmithing and you hearth to get back to the AH area because you're too lazy to run.
---
If you want it to be as close to the original launch, then you may do the following:
---
12 am the servers open, you wait until 2 am (That's how long it took me in line to get the game). You go home and start installing the game. This will take you about 5-7 hours depending on the internet you had back then. AFTER this, you can login and simulate a que up to close 2 hours. 
---
After these 2 hours, you may create your own character, login and get kicked within 35 minutes of play, to then get placed in the 2 hour que again.
---
Repeat from que each hour/2 hours for perfect authentic Vanilla launch day!
---
Have fun!
---
That's a really nice straw man you've got yourself going there.
---
Who are you to judge people like that?
---
Your comment is completely irrelevant in this sub as WoW gathers one of the most hardcore community of people.
---
And somehow managed to set same keybinds for all actionbars.
---
And that can be super fun! For about a week! Then it's boring and you just want to finish your rep for the offhand or ring. 
---
TBH a trial account to 20 like nowadays would be perfect - 20 is a fair few hours in game time and will let people know if they want to continue or its too hard.
---
shaman is way more fun for me, if you dont plan to raid, you can do well in all three specs, and totem utilities and managment is really fun
---
Not rushing is the easy part. The hard part is convincing the rest of your team and the entire enemy team not to rush. 
---
I want the mount though? 
---
It’s not a priority for a lot of people. 1K is a lot to cough up when a server is new. 
---
Them damn BElfs. A scourge of their own upon the Horde.
---
What does any of that even mean bro. 
---
Yes, I clearly spent 13,3 minutes on each comment.
---
how so? if you argue that say, lokh'delar would still be relatively rare because you still have to level up to 60 and do a challenging quest, wouldn't the old mounts also be rare because you have to level up to 60 and farm all that gold WITH A TIME LIMIT?
---
That's sort of the problem though. As games get longer and longer, people just want it to be done, and start rushing.
---
Except for the day that someone ganks and camps you while you're trying to do all that and ruins your entire day because of it, and now you're biting people's heads off at work because you're so pissed that you had to leave for work and log out at the GY dead lol.
---
This is the wrong place to make such a comment...
---
Recreating EVERYTHING from 1.12 would be really stupid idea. They are gating endgame content precisely because of that. Imagine what would happen if Naxx was available from day one.
---
I played feral since wrath and have loved it since. Now I’m wondering is feral in classic similar to the style of what I may have played before? Or is rogue more of what I’ll be looking for in terms of play style?
---
as far as I'm concerned "guessing" isn't a fact
---
So I think we can agree that when a game is designed around the class model, classes tend to naturally arrange themselves in a spectrum and exist somewhere between being the worst at something, and being the best at something.
---
I will give a very straight forward and simple example for you to understand: It's probably fair to say that Priest is the worst tanking class in the game.
---
For some reason people seem to be fine with the fact that Priests aren't tanks. There is no expectation that they should perform well as tanks. Nobody ever complains that Priest can't tank.
---
But when it comes to classes that can perform in multiple roles, suddenly some people have to make a huge stink out of the fact that [insert class] happens to be the best at a particular role. Even though other classes *can* do it and/or performs just fine in that role just that they don't have **the** highest TPS, DPS or HPS.
---
Mages don't get angry and begin to complain when they're told that the Hunter will kite trash during Molten Core. But the second Paladin tanks aren't within 1% performance of Warrior tanks then all of the sudden this needs to be nerfed and that needs to be buffed or else how will I be able to look my 5 year old daughter in the eye when I tuck her into bed at night?
---
Okay fuckwit, I'm glad you just revealed you know jack shit about this.

Now sir please go fuck yourself
---
Both versions can take days to finish. The new one (which looks like will be implemented) nerfs some of the guards and makes it easier to cap the bunkers, graveyards etc. But that's not the main reason why the old AVs took days. That was because people were retards and didn't know how to play AV. Today we know better, so regardless of what version of AV is implemented, we'll just rush to the boss and farm the rep in a weekend never to step inside the BG again. Except perhaps to farm black lotuses and other trade materials. 
---
Supreme proof of this is that the old version is being used on private servers and they all rush straight to the boss and finish the AV in like 15 minutes. Do this about 30 times and you're exalted. 
---
I'm not gonna defend an argument I'm not making. It's not really a challenge to get to 60 and get an epic mount. 
---
AOE looting &amp; hybrid viability.
---
My limited inventory will never allow me to complete that quest. I'll have to create a mule just for those damn pages.
---
It just adds more utility. I play a little different. It could also be used to close the gap on a friendly melee out of range (by charging something between you and him), so you can get him heals asap.
---
Def not needed, but I couldn't see myself without it, especially in wpvp. The utility is too good imo.
---
&gt; they either can't accept that some classes tend to be stronger than others in certain areas 
---
Warrior class is way better designed and viable in ALL the areas it was designed **(3 specs, 3 different situation, 3 situations where those specs that godtier)** than ANY of the hybrid classes, which are at best only godtier at 1 thing : heal.
---
Stop trying to defend such flaws, you are ridiculous. It's totally legit to ask for class balance / talent improvement. 
---
What's the point of this whole series of quests at all?
---
Of course there's the herbs you get, a very small amount and generally low level herbs. So what's the whole point?
---
Rexxar evil.... makes me question everything about this chart.
---
I've hearthed shorter distances than that before!
---
Your right, let’s also remove Atiesh and the corrupted Ashbringer while we are at it. And benediction. Actually let’s just remove everything that isn’t in retail.
---
(Assuming you're a warrior)
---
Shield Block: The most overpowered ability you got. Get 1/5 in shield spec (don't need 5/5, just want the extra charge on shield block) and suddenly you're nigh uncrushable/crittable, reason is because a blocked (or dodged/parried/missed) attack cannot crit or crush you, so long as you don't eat more than two swings every 5 seconds. It's not fool proof, but it vastly devalues defense stat for instance.
---
Single target threat: Revenge is your best rage to threat ability, but not highest TPS. Shield Slam's your heavy hitter (unless you go for a maximum threat build in which case you wont have it, but that's the advanced guide not for beginners) Sunder Armour is your average filler, use revenge when available and sprinkle heroic strike in as rage allows.
---
Multi tanking: This is where things get iffy, AoE tanking is absolutely the hardest part of vanilla tanking. If you've got 2-3 targets you're best off tabbing around and using single target threat to keep them on you, keep a close eye on KTM. When we're talking 5+ it's battle shout and heroic strike all the way. Do NOT use thunder clap and demo shout for AoE threat, TC is a trap, does fuckall threat requires a stance switch and just, don't. that's the DPS warriors job. Demo shout is decent but has a fixed amount of threat to it spread evenly amongst your targets, more targets less threat per. Battle Shout works differently, it gives you a set amount of threat (like 40 or something, i'm not a numbers guy) per party member within 20 yards buffed with it, including pets. Loads of mobs? If there's a big fuck target him with heroic strikes and spam BS, just small ones tab around with HS and spam BS.
---
Taunts: Taunt is a spell, that means it needs 17% hit to not resist on bosses, an unrealistic goal but good to keep in mind. You have two other taunts, Mocking Blow and Challenging Shout at your disposal, they work differently however. Taunt puts you at the threat level of the mobs current highest threat target and forces it to attack you for 2 seconds, MB and CS force the targets to attack you for 6/4 seconds, but they don't boost your threat. CS is also 17&amp; hit chance, MB is a melee special so 8% plus dodge/parry chance.
---
General advice: practice practice practice, you'll get a rythm for it eventually, let people know you're the boss and you're doing things at your pace, get with the program or fuck off.
---
Your premise is flat wrong. Making changes doesn't just get you retail wow. Many many problems and situations happened to get us where we are today in retail.  Not just changes to improve the game. There's plenty of things and parts of retail wow that's just flat superior to classic and always will be. 
---
Personally I feel playing 1.12 isn't playing true classic. 
---
I agree there's a reason why wow had a particular feel. I honestly worry that that feel won't be anywhere near what it was for various reasons... The community, the patch starting, the level of knowledge and the lack of wonder/mystery. 
---
NO CHANGES!

Xperl used to give my gpu hard times...

 &lt;Classic Veterans&gt; - Alliance {NA - PVE/PVP}  Semi-Hardcore  
---
 Introduction: 
---
We are a close group of friends who have been playing WoW for many many years. Some of us are returning to the game because of the love for Classic WoW, we have players who have push high raid tiers, and players who have souly played for pvp ranking. We all enjoy having a good time and would love for some new people to join and help grow our guild for some awesome world pvp fun.  
---
 What we are looking for in members: 
---
we are looking to invite as many players as possible who just want to have a great time at classic wow and make friends. Once we have enough players who are lvl 60, we will begin to form a raid group for pushing content. Durring the leveling process we will always have people who are very friendly and willing to help out with dungeons/quests. A good majority of people are planning to "no life" WoW classic launch and reach lvl 60 asap. Wheather you are a casual player or a hardcore lvler, there is definitely a place for you in our guild.  If you are looking for some new friends who enjoy having a good time, then this is the perfect place for you!   
---
Discord:
---
 our discord is new but growing 📷 we have some information regarding each class that can be used as a reference when playing, and we always try to stay updated with all Classic News.   [https://discord.gg/WamKnvY](https://discord.gg/WamKnvY) 
---
I guess you'll have to wait and find out for yourself when you actually play the game for the first time that things don't work the way you think they do.
---
Just because some youtuber with 5k subs told you that this is how things are it's pretty clear that you yourself haven't even come close to playing the game yourself or you wouldn't be making these baseless arguments.
---
Well, obviously, if he is hell bent on a certain class, support him with that decision. But we all know certain classes are far easier to play then others. I'd never recommend a warrior to a new player since they are so painfully slow to level. As an alt, sure. But not your main. 
---
In the case of my cousin, we had a bunch of us starting to play at the same time and we really thought a warlock would benefit the group. So when he expressed interest in it, we were very supportive. But in hindsight, we should have pushed him more toward a hunter which was his second choice since they are (in my opinion) easier and funner to play. 
---
AV has so much potential but it's ruined by the backdoor and fence. Also you can only queue in as groups which means it's unreliable to premade. Best way is to have a raid queue simultaneously and hope most of them get into the same AV. I don't know how that will work on Classic though. If it doesn't work then Horde will just straight up win 90% of all games because the backdoor can be used by pugs while the Alliance rush requires a lot of coordination.
---
The frostwolf one? I just said rep was actually much easier to farm when there were more AV quests. If you mean the other mounts, you need R11 for them but either way 30 marks is 10 wins. That is a perfectly reasonable grind to get an epic, gated mount.
---
Only a Sith deals in absolutes. 
---
You just mad UD lock counters all other lock races :D
---
&gt; After classic I’m sure the community would be more then accepting of a day long BG 
---
People have jobs you know. There are already so many threads asking about whether raiding takes too much time / commitment. Do you really think such an AV version will fit that?
---
But better throw away all those non hardcore / non-nolife players, right?
---
Both Nost, Ely, LB and ND has the old version. Pretty sure KR does too. 
---
Actually pre 1.8 is where it was good
---
Exceptions to the rule. Nothing is difficult about the vast majority of Vanilla content, and the parts that are difficult are because of raid coorindination rather than DPS or Healing check.
---
Having some pots spare is always going to be handy, but people using flasks, food buffs, firewater, eco buffs, scrolls, blasted lands buffs and whatever else is a meme unless you are in the 1% of people who want to push for top parses.
---
Part of the dialect, I would say. 
---
Running Feral cat druid alliance. You letting meme specs in raids? Will I be kicked if im top 3-10 dps?
---
Nicely done. I state facts, but nothing to say from your part. I feel you.
---
The only one of the old ones I do want, the Mottled Red Raptor, doesn't actually have any replacement, making it's model actually pretty special.
---
The "red" raptor we got in MoP is brown, the new ZG raptor is darker red with tons of dark teal armor (which is a very different asthetic from the more orangey red and purple of the Mottled Red).
---
Private servers run 1.12 AV
---
World of Huntercraft
---
I always kicked myself for not buying one of the Arthas-US ones when I had the chance.
---
Whether those mounts are in at launch is quite literally what decides which race/class combo I play, so yeah, I really, really want these in, at least until the content phases reaches the point where they would have passed 1.4.
---
&gt;But the second Paladin tanks aren't within 1% performance of Warrior tanks
---
And this is where your argument fails. Nobody cares whether paladin tanks perform exactly as well as warrior tanks, they just want them to be viable at all. Paladins are essentially flat out incapable of raid tanking because of their lack of taunt or defensive cooldowns. This is exactly what I was talking about, there's a huge middle ground between where paladin tanks were at and where warrior tanks were at. Nobody is asking for or expecting the game to get perfectly balanced, they just want the specs to be able to perform their intended role to some degree. Paladins don't need to be just as good as warriors at tanking raid bosses but they should at least be capable of it. In exactly the same way, balance druids or ele shamans don't need to do just as much damage as mages but they should at least be able to perform their intended role even if they're only like 80% as good as a mage.
---
Yeah, it wasn't even really a problem on the pservers either. It was kind of isolated to STV and Tanaris. But gaaawdayum was there ganking in those two places.
---
The private servers use the old version of AV and let me tell you, people are still turtling around the bunkers and field of strife. 
---
I'm honestly curious - how is that possible? Assuming you play 18 hours a day for the first 6 days, that's 4.5 days of played hours, and then on day 7, assuming you have 40 members who are all 60, you can go and do MC with a smattering of random quest reward greens and blues? I thought the whole conversation around pre-raid BiS also applied to running MC - that you essentially can't do it unless the majority of the raid has some decent gear. I guess if you're leveling tightly with your guild you could knock out some lvl 60 5-man dungeons and get some of that gear, but by doing that you likely are slowing down your leveling if you aren't 60, and those dungeons take some serious time to complete, especially if all of the members are using sub-par leveling greens that they got during the mad leveling rush (I'm thinking about how in the Joana guide he says that most of the leveling is done with whatever you can handily find, because going out of your way to get better gear takes up valuable leveling time). I also remember having to run those dungeons a ton of times before I had decent enough gear to join a non-hardcore MC raid with my guild. I'm interested in people's thoughts!
---
Yep, ain't it great?
---
You're wrong. The whole no change stance is about things that weren't in vanilla. It's not "no changes from 1.12 " 
---
Area Man DIES From Too Much World of Warcraft??? This Story Will Give You Chills...........
---
Well apparently not.. AV has been out on private servers for several years now and people are still bumbling around farming honor in the middle while Horde is slowly creeping up the backdoor until they get a big enough raid to kill Vann. I doubt it'll change on Classic.
---
Damn dude this is one of the oldest pvp videos I’ve ever seen, and I’ve kept up with the scene pretty heavily.  The mage played pretty well for the time too.
---
It gave reputation I think.   And it gave me a reason to shout DRUG ADDICT! at anybody who kept doing this during raids.
---
Because the original 1.12 servers were that size (2500~ish). Ganking actually crippling your levelling in stv is a pserver meme. The difference between levelling with 2k players online vs 10k is huge.
---
Clearly a troll.  congrats to all that fed him.
---
Rogue. Wotlk feral was amazing and the first class I really fell in love with too (had mained shaman until that). It will feel so neutered compared to wrath, really not worth it. Rogue will be a lot closer.
---
Go away bud
---
This is one grind I couldn’t do and I tried, I made it a point to grind everyday day for no less than 2 hours and usually upwards of 4 and I was only half way there after a month. I just couldn’t stomach those same three quests for another month or so or grinding. 
---
Theres actually a weekly thread for this on Mondays.  Might have more luck there.
---
Also, faction, type of server, time zone, etc are helpful.
---
&gt;	If Blizzard decided to add Twitch or Twitter integration into Classic I would be handing out pitchforks and torches.
---
What? No. This is irrelevant. If blizzard adds sharding because of streamers, it would suck - Twitch integration, while silly, Wouldnt change the gameplay for the average player. Sharding Will. 
---
&gt;However, I still say Sharding is necessary for a smooth launch, especially when you account for all the tourist who'll only try the game for a week and those who'll only log into the game in hopes Senpai will notice them.
---
And I say dont spend time and money developing something that is not needed after the initial launch.
---
The first week will be a clusterfuck, and then it will sort itself out :)
---
No one forces you to obtain rank 13 in 2 months. Rank 13 is achievable 12 months of the year, whenever you have the time to put the work in.
---
Correct?
---
Someone has time in January, February and may. The next person has the time to achieve the rank in October, November or December.
---
Or is there a time limit to rank 13?
---
THAT is a huge difference. How about they unlock ranks for 2 months and everyone who doesn't get it in this specific time frame is out of luck. 
---
If they don't exist, then they can't be rare. Retail and classic will not be connected, so having these exist for the first month or so will maintain their scarcity in classic servers without affecting retail at all
---
Reputation for what? Just TB?
---
At the point of my first comment I didn't know you were a twat.
---
YOU ARE BENT FROM THE VENT
---
I think the rushes was a result of the game mentality evolving, not the BG. On private servers they run the old AV and people still rush to the boss. People just want the rep for as little effort as possible. If you don't premade AV then you'll be stuck in the middle for hours and hours. At least on the old AV you can fight Korrak every 2 hours.
---
no way you wouldnt be kicked lol, the game is about having fun. as long as we get shit done. no  one cares what spec you go
---
So it's not fair when Warriors are considered the most well rounded tank and also happen to perform well on DPS, but at the same time Shamans are the best healer of their faction and also need to place behind the #1 DPS class on meters?
---
I'd suggest you read the definition of the phrase cognitive dissonance.
---
Don't forget ghost wolf at lvl 20 which makes travelling a lot easier. 
---
No. How is lvling to 60 and farming 1k gold doing nothing? 
---
Everyone does the same thing to get epic mounts. What does it matter if you do it now or in 6 months?
---
Explain the difference?! 
---
You could still speed run that version, though. It wasn't impossible to win in &lt;25mins.
---
free realm transfers were off of high pop realms, werent they?
---
The concern this time around is that theres going to be a considerable amount of people playing early, and then it'll die off a bit as the tourists/people that cant handle the lack of QoL stuff leave, which will lead to the opposite problem that Vanilla had (constant growth).
---
That's because playing defense is reviled by the honor farmers &amp; rankers. Backcapping &amp; defending chokepoints are a legit strategy that can stop a zerg &amp; ultimately win. It doesn't have to be a dps race.
---
Contemplating on recreating my mains from Vanilla, NE Resto Druid and Gnome Mage. Been wondering if I should start off something new since now I know Human's racials are some of the best and I could go Warrior or Rogue. Human Priest is also of interest, but maybe I should go Dwarf for fear ward and really add some value to raids, or should I try a fresh start on Horde? Decisions, decisions....
---
Who said they would quit? It would effect how long I'll play though
---
From what I've heard on this sub, there are some guilds that are so good at MC, they can clear it in greens. 
---
Where's your threat meter?
---
True Dat.
---
I'm just wondering why useless mounts have to be on a timer. 
---
Thanks for all the input guys, a lot of good points. Think I’m gonna go for priest in the end after reading your comments. Dwarf or Undead remains to be seen. 
---
Professions is something I’ll have to look at a later stage but tailoring should be a prio due to BiS robe. 
---
Old AV sucked and took way too long to complete. Cry more.
---
I don't care about retail whatsoever. I don't think these mounts should exist in classic, since they were so rare to come across during vanilla post 1.4. If they're everywhere to be seen in classic, then that is not a right representation of vanilla.
---
The game doesn’t cater to you, you cater to the game. The exact mentality that made classic wow so incredibly addictive and interactive. With every expansion and streamline update we got farther away from what made wow so inherently fun. You want to play casually? Cool, do your thing but you have to accept that certain aspects of the game will become either unobtainable or undesirable for you. The hardcore players overtime earned gear and titles that not many players otherwise could have thus leading to notoriety and there’s something to be said for that. Stop acting like such a snowflake and fight accept that status requires dedication 
---
Having a hard time choosing between Warlock, Warrior, and Shaman. 
---
My primary concern is PvP. I initially was sold on Enhancement Shaman since that's what I played back in Vanilla and remember being really strong. From what I understand now, they're mostly a meme spec and not all that strong. 
---
So my next choice was the other big 2h wielding class, Warrior. After messing around for a few levels on some pserver I decided I really liked the concept of managing stances and mortal striking people to death was close enough in my heart and mind to WF proccing someone. But I'm having a really hard time with what I've read about Warrior being one of the worst classes in wPvP and 1v1 situations. Especially if they don't heavily make use of engineering, potions, and other various buffs. 
---
Warlock is really only in the running because it is a durable PvP class with strong burst options. Also, they wear their tier gear which is a huge plus considering my other choices will be in clown suits. 
---
Can anyone talk me into why Warrior / Enh Shaman are good choices? Any information on gearing the two since there are not tier pieces designed for them? Or can someone tell me that I'd be better off going Warlock as it ticks more "functional" boxes in what I'm looking for. 
---
That's just inappropriately condescending for no good reason.
---
Almost as clear assuming a nostalgic screenshot from 2006 on r/classicwow implies one would have the same free time now. Tragic.
---
Problem with elemental shamans is that they do nature damage. Nature sucks. Why does it suck? Because curse of elements and curse of shadows doesn't affect nature. That means you have no way of reducing the mobs nature resistance and don't get that free 10% damage boost. 
---
What.?
---
You can be passive aggressive to your mom, but if you have anything to say, say it. 
---
You’re not talking to the same person.
---
Also, if you go back and read that thread you will see the math broken down further, and see that your analysis of 1.8 being the longest duration takes a lot of bias to get to one day greater.
---
Don’t take my word for it, go read the thread. Don’t just accept the first thing that supports your view point and stop there. 
---
Just be prepared for a shitty nerfed, culled of NPC's and quests AV then because that's how it is post 1.8. and no this isn't from private server experience
---
Kings + Might + Salv
---
Mace/Sword (human) is more common than Axe. If I were a rogue, I'd take windfury since I can feint and vanish for threat management. As a warrior, I have no threat management outside of stopping dps. I'd be tempted to go orc if it was just about pvp though. That stun resist OP!
---
I mained a holy pally in vanilla. The leveling while slow was offset because I didn’t die as often as other classes. As far as raiding I was in a guild on the kilrogg server that cleared BWL and was well into AQ40 when TBC released. Never had success in Naxx unfortunately. Holy paladins are extremely useful for their buffs. While they lack an AOE heal vs some other classes you literally spam flash of light. It’s boring not going to lie. But if you want an easy class to heal on, that will always have a raid slot I’d say go for it. I will probably be doing the same. I would consistently be in top 3 on healing done and HPS even before I was geared out. This is me speaking from experience as someone who did it back in the day. Best of wishes and maybe I’ll see you on launch! :D 
---
they run out of mana when they blow their load on our face my bitch
---
Love the podcast man. Listen on my way to and from work.
---
So what? Goldmaking guides?
---
requires lvl 24.  that lvl 22 priest should have passed anyway
---
If you check his post history he's one of those morons you think's absolutely everything needs to be the exact way that it was.
---
The fact that certain specs on hybrids were just completely unviable was always a really bad part of vanilla and it's just so sad that a few tiny tweaks could make some of the hybrid classes a lot funner to play, but so many people that want classic are absolutely against it because I guess in their mind having dead specs is enjoyable and "deep" gameplay.
---
Jesus christ dude, no, you're putting words in my mouth. In what world does doing 80% as much damage as the top mean placing right behind them on the meters? That's still a huge gap but it would at least mean they're not a liability to have.
---
And I wasn't saying that it's unfair for warriors to be both the only viable tank and to be one of if not the best dps. My point was that it's hypocritical of the community to talk about how it's perfectly fair for hybrids to only have one usable spec and that's how it should be while ignoring that warriors get to be the best in two roles. *That's* cognitive dissonance.
---
I think that is the reason.
---
The kodo is ugly as fuck. I don't even care. 
---
This is how I got my epic mount on last pserver.
---
And pressumably Darnassus.
---
The first time around it gives XP
---
Private servers don't have pre 1.12 av data or map files, stop thinking private server experience means anything in AV pre 1.12
---
For me WoW Classic will be great because of the mechanics of the game that were better back then. The work to reward ratio was just right and the social interactions were better than currently. I am all up for a toggle to allow people to use new character models in the WoW Classic. It will not hurt the ultimate Vanilla experience fans and will satisfy the rest that, such as me, cannot bear to look at the butt ugly old dwarf models when I now have the beautiful new dwarves. If it will not hurt anyone why not do it? 
---
Sure, you weren't at all posting it to fuel the salty "I want 10 hour AVs back" tantrum. Just nostalgia.
---
I had someone a week or two ago say that a graphics toggle for updated graphics would absolutely effect them even if they dont use it.  How their character looks to other people is more important than other people enjoying the graphics in the game they choose to play.
---
I just cant fathom it.
---
You are bringing retail mentality to Classic. Stop it.
---
Real players didn't need a threat meter! Not when you can just call the tank a noob for not holding aggro while you burn through all your cooldowns.
---
&gt;Days/Weeks later we'll be running end game dungeons for gear.
---
Change that to Months later.
---
Has anyone else noticed ony deep breathing more since the patch?
---
Zug zug, Zug!
---
When it comes to race pick what you think you will enjoy the most. I was caught up on wanting to roll an undead warrior but also wanted to min/max. Watched a video on the undead starting intro and I am now 100% sure I want to play undead.
---
The man got the name Zug. Legend. 
---
Naxx was wotlk
---
Yes it is? Everyone who bought a mount pre 1.4 had an unarmored mount, so how is it different to have unarmored mounts until say phase 2 ?
---
THATS A 50 DKP MINUS!!
---
Mage - Engineering/Mining maybe? Arms warrior might be good, but a healer really amplifies their capabilities and it seems like you want to do a lot of solo stuff. Rogues are one of the best PVPers in vanilla, especially for solo where you can pick your battles, they do great DPS in raids, but probably are not the best farmers. Mage will allow you to have teleports, great DPS, solid PVPers, and create your own food/drinks that will certainly help with farming
---
I think I might understand you, but I'm not 100% sure.      
---
      
---
So let's say a rogue shows up to your raid. The damage he's putting out is below what you'd expect or hope, so you ask how he's specced. He tells you he's 0/0/51. You tell him there are stronger specs out there to be found, maybe list a few in chat. He says that's fine but he's not interested and he likes his spec how it is.         
---
          
---
Based on how I read your perspective above, this guy is an asshole. He's been told there are more effective specs to use, but he's not interested  in learning or pursuing them. Is that accurate?         
---
        
---
I don't think I agree with that, but I definitely agree that curating your own groups is the best way to go about these things.  It's a bit hypocritical of me, because  IRL I feel like people isolate themselves from dissenting opinions to FAR too high of a degree with socia media 'circles' or whatever. But in a video game where you only have so much time to have fun, and specifically  in an MMO where the people you surround yourself with impact it  to a significant degree, it seems  like a very important functionality to get the most out of your game time.
---
my favorite part of vanilla was forming a single file line with like 2000 other people to loot a quest item at like level 3
---
yes, and for the alliance it was for Darnassus.  
---
But repeatable, so it was a (slow) way to get exalted , but all bits help
---
it would be this summer, not next though right?
---
Neverwinter nights flashbacks. Good times. 
---
Yeah and the funny part is that I bet these people either don’t ever play those specs in question
---
You're telling me the frostsaber and the ivory raptor weren't anything special ? They were awesome
---
**Druid** plays a lot more like a true hybrid in Vanilla. The pure cat dps that you became used to in Wrath is not the Feral that you will find in Vanilla. You will have to branch out your playstyle and be comfortable in a lot of roles to play it optimally, acting more like a support-dps. Now Feral can put out some significant numbers if you're really into min-maxing, just don't expect to top any meters.
---
Some people like this version of **Druid** more, I happen to be one, but it is up to you to decide for yourself. If you would rather be a pure dpser I'd advise you to roll **Rogue** or maybe even **Warrior**.
---
Im actually fine with streamers having a hard time, but thats frankly because i dont give a damn about twitch.
---
Im more concerned with the fact that the vast majority of the playerbase are going to be people with only a few hours per night to play (if that), and having to deal with queue times and it taking 20 minutes to do basic early quests (even in a party) because theres SO many people there.  That will kill the motivation for a *lot* of more casual players.
---
I'd love to party with a mage or warlock too. Food is one of the most expensive parts of leveling a warrior. Mage has unrivaled CC in 5 mans with sheep and nova.
---
I'd love to group with a warlock as much if not more too. Lock candy for an "oh shit heal." Also, if you have a couple of rogues the lock can put up curse of recklessness on top of the sunders to remove a lot of the armor from the target.
---
Plus, we roll on different items! Every drop is a good drop. If you're a solid caster and find a tank you'll be set my friend.
---
Sadly, sharding in Classic will be a thing and there will be no mass PvP. I'd love nothing more than to see city raids happen again, but Activision's budget servers can't handle them.
---
&gt;Shut the fuck up. 
---
Man the classic community sure is looking great
---
Yes, vanilla content isn’t that hard.
---
I have no interest in playing the oldest version of AV.. AV 1.12 is fine by me
---
what an idiot
---
They aren't the best at two roles. They're the best tanks, they're not the best DPS.
---
Right now I am on the fence regarding the recent news of AV, on the one hand long AVs were epic and something I think back on. Being an adult having a job and responsibilities however wouldn't particularly allow for it. Carry on making assumptions about people though and spreading that salt a bit more. 
---
Raids, yes. Some of the minmaxing is overblown.
---
For pvp premade *competitive* it's likely a no
---
Omg RIP.
---
I do have Shadowmeld to survive being AFK.  It's the best casual racial ever!  Lol
---
Frankly, I would prefer prefer to 1.12 all the things no matter how much better earlier versions of individual features were.  
---
"Just give us 1.12" is a very simple directive, and there is real value in having such a simple directive.  You don't get any surprises that way.  
---
On Wednesdays I play Fallout 4.   Lots of mods to try out and I am home from work a bit early so I can do some extended exploring.   I like to return to various older games now, because when Classic hits for real I probably won't have time for those anymore. 
---
The mounts are very underwhelming and don't look any special or very different from the normal ones.
---
The armoured epic ones are much better and the only reason to get these would be that they are rare or are available only for short time. Honestly I don't see the appeal and no reason for Blizzard to put effort into including underwhelming mounts only to remove and replace them later.
---
They're the best in some situations and most certainly are at the bare minimum top tier in all situations.
---
Why would I be salty again? I don't want 10 hour AVs.
---
Swing and a miss, buddy.
---
I disagree with 1month I'd say on phase 3 (maybe 2 would be better) release to get rid of them. That way early birds and the like have plenty of time, but they are still limited
---
We also have the positives of knowing how to play the game now too
---
Not to mention auto attack on 1 
---
The best way to do this is in the search bar type increase nature dam.  This will pull up a list of spells that have 1-50 damage or whatever the range is. 
---
Here's an example: [http://classicdb.ch/?search=increase+shadow+dam](http://classicdb.ch/?search=increase+shadow+dam)
---
I wouldn't expect the requirements to come out until the release is imminent (maybe a month ahead at best). Testing performance should be a continuous thing for them, but they'll want to wait as long as they can before releasing requirements as to get the most accurate judgment possible. 
---
To be safe I would aim for the minimum requirements needed to run the current version of the game, but I would guess you could run it well on a much cheaper or older system. 
---
Yeah my very first level 60 character was a druid and I can't describe how much my heart sank back in the day when I realized I was never going to be allowed to do anything but he'll in serious content.
---
I really love the idea of turning into animals and stuff and was a longtime Warcraft 3 player and was really into the Druid lore.
---
I eventually became so miserable at the role I was forced into because of how bad the other specs were compared to other DPS classes that I ended up re-rolling and I had a very good time playing a mage after that but my very first classic experience was being super into my character and then realising it was busted and people on here say if that's a "good thing".
---
Even when I was healing I felt like I was constantly reminded that I'm not as good as the priesthood I'm just there to intervate them.  I was so Jaded by the experience that I never played my druid again.
---
If I want to play more social, I'll go mage.  
---
So “yes” you mean.
---
Lol there is literally just an orc hanging around with the name Zug. 
---
They're the best in early raid content because caster gear is awful and melee DPS gear isn't.
---
They're not even a top 10 finish after AQ.
---
You make no sense.
---
I never assumed or stated you wanted them, I said you are spreading general salt and also making ill informed assumptions. You should really try to comprehend what is being typed.
---
Pretending pre-April 2015 didn't happen and removing the option to have something that existed in 1.12 seems like a poor representation of vanilla.
---
I do understand more now where you're coming from.  But I still don't agree that it should be removed because players made a choice to make it uncommon to see for the ladder half of vanilla.  That to me is irrelevant.
---
Desperately want them
---
I think you're missing the point.
---
They should be available for a limited time, **just like they were in Vanilla**.
---
Hi! I am from the future (roughly 4-5 months or so) and have been sent here to speak on the behalf of all hardcore guilds. The answer to your question is: 42
---
My point was that you don't NEED 19 minutes to say "They're using 1.12 AV"
---
I doubt the team will limit servers to such a small cap.  They already said the reason they are using limited amounts of sharding is to address the “tourists”.  If you had 2500 people including tourists, you’re looking at entire servers that would have to come together to fill one raid even at peak times.
---
This isn’t 2004.
---
You’re more likely going to see closer to modern server caps.
---
Cant tell if trolling or not.
---
Prot paladins can be used in raids. We have both a prot and ret paladin in all our raids and it works fine. They really excel in AoE threat because of consecration, so whatever boss or trash has loads of adds it makes it so much easier with a prot. You can also choose a spec like [this](https://classicwowtalents.appspot.com/?talent=11215875_2_8055331j5c51335001551p) where you can both tank and heal as long as you have some gear and a lot of mana pots. Illumination is really strong but only if you have good gear. The point is that hybrids all have one spec that works well; healing. Then they have two other specs that are really unique and can do some very interesting stuff that nobody else can. With a proper prot paladin and a good healer you can smash your way through Scholomance or Stratholme so effing fast it's almost like a BFA dungeon. 
---
Ferals are among the best tanks, only a really good dual wield fury warrior will out threat a feral tank and that's while taking a huge risk with going dual wield instead of using shields. Feral dps is also decent and can become really good if you want to bother with farming MCPs. 
---
Shadowpriests are mainly brought to boost the warlocks, but they can do good damage too. Their real issue is mana, so they need to rely heavily on consumes and tailor their gear for the length of the encounter. In Preach's priest legacy video he shows a comparison of shadowpriests on a Ragnaros fight and a Patchwerk fight. On the raggy fight the shadowpriest is near the top because it's a short fight, while on the Patchwerk fight he's among the tanks. The same goes for boomkins. Great dps for a minute or two, then you might as well whack the boss with your staff. Shamans I have no idea about, I just know that an elemental or enhancement shaman in PvP is a scary sight. Trinketet and buffed a shaman can chain lightning several people into the ground at once. That's another thing people seem to forget about, the PvP rolls. We are so set upon PvE being the only playstyle. All hybrids are amazing in PvP. 
---
It's actually funny how many people want corrections to the hybrids instead of the pure classes who have some really big problems. A feral druid or shadow priest, maybe even a retri paladin will out dps any hunter in AQ and especially Naxx. And hunters can't heal, their only role is dps and after BWL they are the runt of the pure classes. So IMO they should fix hunters instead of the hybrids. 
---
That's exactly the nitpicking I'm looking for, thanks. It uses to be fine but something I changed lately regarding spell auras must have borked it; will look into it.
---
They were removed in an early patch in vanilla and therefore rare.  I dont see why it should be different this time
---
He meant be remembers this quest but can't remember any quests from any expansions :P 
---
You're talking to a bot
---
If you examine things on a case-by-case basis, then you leave open the door for more and more cases to fall in because of precedent.  And there's no reason Blizzard can't go back to an old case and re-open it.
---
I got Exalted with TB back during Retail Vanilla to be the first Horde server-wide to have an interracial mount... and just now am I learning this. FML and my wallet for buying all that runecloth.
---
You are comparing apples to oranges when you try to make the AV decision and dungeons to be similar.  The staggered dungeon release is simply they are either available or they aren't.  Making a 1.5 release AV inside of a 1.12 main patched game could create additional problems and risk that it's difficult to predict.  Additionally you could have new balance issues with gameplay when you break the sync of the patch.  It sounds to me like you just don't like that 1.12 was chosen as the release patch for Classic. 
---
D&amp;D alignments are stupid.
---
Correct , on BG launch they will be
---
None of this is correct. Weapon skill reduces the damage loss of glancing blows, and items had % hit on them. 
---
Oh no, they fall slightly towards the end of the raid content. I guess that settle it, they're basically on the same level as enhancement shamans, right?
---
It's 1.12 talents and gear (unless it's the blatantly over powered gear which is gated). The 50-59 leveling greens actually aren't super awful and you can easily do MC with them. You can clear MC with 20 competent, geared people; or with 30 competent people in greens. The guild I know going for it has been one of the most hardcore Pserver guilds. They've been rerolling characters over and over for the past few weeks trying to cement their leveling strategies. It's very easily doable, leveling fast will be harder than clearing MC itself.
---
Browsing a WoW subreddit and reacting to someone he feels is wasting his time.
---
As a tank, I'd love to group with a mage! We roll on different loot and each bring something unique to a 5 man. Then when we're done with the 5 man, I'll use your tasty buns to farm. :D
---
So in vanilla wow there are basically 3 primary camps, you have the lax players who take their time, enjoy the sites, do 3day av. You have the semi hard cores, who move at a steady rate towards end game but don't rush. And lastly you have the people that are only satisfied if they have top end gear/ accomplishment etc etc. It's different playstyles but there's nothing wrong with being a rusher
---
So you are using a nuclear weapon to kill a mosquito ?
---
I get what you mean. Pserver data may not be 100% accurate. But if there are changes to bear tank, at 1.12, I honestly don't think it'll be a huge difference. Not large enough to make Heart of the Wild bear tank unviable. Now as a bear, you do have to put in way more effort than a a warrior sure, but honestly it's worth it if that's the class you'll enjoy.
---
In that case I stick to true vanilla on pservers. I'm playing on one right now anyway. Not a huge miss for me tbh.
---
I just want to summon the big tree guy and the night elfs. I forgot their names.
---
Nothing I said here was the least bit salty about anything. You're seeing things which don't exist.
---
I see this question asked a lot, and I think I am going to make a video guide about the absolute basics for the noob tank. Tanking is extremely stressful when you first attempt that role, but it’s quick to learn. It’s not simply about “spamming Sunder Armor.” You can do that on one mob, but the moment you have to deal with three or more you will find you have no rage to hold anything. It’s about managing your threat by choosing the right ability, at the right time based on your incoming rage. It’s not as complicated as it sounds, but understand that every player is different with their own personal strengths and weaknesses during play. What one Uber Tank Guide works for one player might not work for another, so it’s important to learn the basics and understand how it all works, and build upon that knowledge to make what works best for you. 
---
Why are you spending all that money for G-sync? Were talking about Classic WoW here... the game runs on a toaster. Yes the client is newer but you don't need all this tech. It's just a massive waste of money to build a rig like this to play Classic fucking WoW :p
---
Say it like a man and I tell you why you are wrong. 
---
The most difficult part will be getting the drops for dungeon set 1. The quests for dungeon set 2 are reasonable, especially for a player-base that is more informed than we first were. I had no idea how to do a 45 min strath back in the day, but feel confident I can get it done by the time I'm looking to work on dungeon set 2. 
---
I agree there's nothing wrong, but you just created 3 groups. The AV changes could potentially only positively affect a minority of players.
---
MC will be cleared somewhere between Day 6 and Day 10 after Classic releases, by whichever group of dedicated 24/7 type players are most successful at executing on getting 40 people to 60 on a single server.
---
That’s why people say “a week.”
---
Here’s how this will play out.
---
Right now the top private server players know the game REALLY WELL. When the first 40 or so players hit 60, you can bet your bottom dollar that all 40 of them will be A) seasoned private server players with hundreds of hours of recent /played, and B) just much much better than the “average” WoW player in terms of game knowledge, raid performance, etc etc. We call these folks “the autists,” and eventually you learn to respect it.
---
So to answer your question, yes, the average “normal guild” would want to have some prebis and decent gear before heading into MC, they need it because they’ll be carrying tons of average players.
---
That’s just not the case for the first group of 40 to hit 60. They’re all really fucking good, no deadweight whatsoever, not one person learning the fights for the first time... yes, they can do MC with most players in quest greens.
---
Worth pointing out that the first warrior to 60 will have had a good 12-24 hours to grab some tanking gear while waiting for the tail end of the first 40 to finish dinging, and that will help a lot.
---
The really interesting question here has to do with servers. On private servers, the race takes place on single one mega pop server, so it’s not a guild per se that clears MC first—rather, it’s a loose group of the first 60s who then split off into various guilds as their slightly slower friends ding in the second, third, fourth week etc.
---
On real Classic, it will be a little different. Groups who want to go for the first MC clear will have to commit to each other and to a server, and then level together. Obviously, they can’t just take the first 40 from across all Classic servers.
---
The multiple server situation adds a really interesting wrinkle to the race. I’m stoked to watch it.
---
Being on top of meters because half the classes are wearing blues until AQ is on farm status doesn't mean they're overpowered. It just means Blizzard failed at designing gear for half the DPS classes.
---
Is this Swifty's incognito reddit account?
---
Overreactions like the ones from this AV post are just going to lead to less blue posts and less transparency... keep it all in perspective people. 
---
haha. Good friendly trolling.
---
I’ve heard no changes but never strictly 1.12.
---
Maybe he does not know about the game as much as you? I for one did not know if it was just a server on WoW or a new game or what, and had no idea if people would be able to transfer resources to the classic servers. To people who genuinely don’t know, you are the troll. Hope this isn’t a depiction of what the classic wow community will be like.
---
Pure speculation. I’ll follow the logic that Blizzard means it when they claim they’re going for authentic 1.12 simulation.
---
Setting a cap of 5000-6000 to cushion the blow of the tourists leaving and being left with 1-2k anyway isn’t a solution. You’ll have the same numbers as before but every server will say “Low Pop” instead.
---
They’ll need to do something clever with sharding, excess servers, and subtle merges in the first weeks and months.
---
How do you deal with the mana issues?
---
You're not getting raid slots because you run as fury, warriors tank. Not bc dwarf.
---
Give it six months, when things lax and people realize it's cool then you'll get a slot. 
---
But I honestly don't expect actual hardcore guilds from back in the day to allow it at the start. Maybe a guild with players from later in the xpac train who don't know better.
---
What he's saying is that he lacked general motor function skill as a child and therefore could not operate the mouse and keyboard. I assume he has since received physical therapy and is now (somewhat) able to.
---
Get ready to spam Sunder Armour, that is your bread &amp; Butter threat skill. 
---
Then Heroic Strike whenever you have extra rage. If tanking multiple mobs you can replace Heroic Strike with Cleave.
---
Hit Shield Block when rage is available as well. This isn't good for threat, but good for damage mitigation.
---
You can switch to Battle Stance and Thunderclap if not in terrible danger. You should also Demo Shout when given the chance.
---
You will need to practice tabbing and targetting the different mobs to keep threat on all of them. It helps if you're the leader in the group and you can mark up different targets.
---
Otherwise you will just need practice and the dungeons on the way up to 60 will be the perfect place for that.
---
I've had that monitor (s2716dg) about 3 years now. It's so good. Also, bruh a 1070ti+i9 9900k will obliterate wow at 1440p. I have a gtx980 and i7-4770k, and it demolishes wow at 1440p.
---
Honestly, thunderclap, demoralizing shout, your tab key and sunder, and taunt on the grave key. There, I spilled the secret of vanilla warrior tanking
---
No I make complete sense. Most of the player base didn’t know how to play the game compared to now. 
---
That's the best one I read so far. Thanks !
---
Your comments are just in general quite bitter, a connotation of being salty. After looking at your post history and abundance of down votes you would certainly qualify for an internet troll.
---
&gt; The game doesn’t cater to you, you cater to the game. 
---
As long as it suits you. Right?
---
Because it's totally reasonable for Blizzard to make it so AV last hours/day.
---
/s
---
AMD Phenom / Intel Core 2 Duo equivalent, 1gb RAM, gtx 9800 / voodoo equivalent
---
Hunters evil?? =\
---
I don't claim to be knowledgable about development. But I don't think it's too much to expect that an instanced battleground wouldn't be affecting other game elements. If they we're tied together, that would be a mess of programming.
---
1.12 as a whole is fine, that doesn't mean there isn't drawbacks. There were 11 previous major patches. God knows Blizzard hasn't always made great decisions in every successive patch..
---
You'll be fine yes.
---
You're gonna have to be awfully slow at levelling to get the raptor when you ding 60 because it won't be possible until later :p
---
Level 18?!?!

Bears, Blizzard, Blackrock Mountain.

I agree this change is better. After doing 2-3 Avs people wont do them anymore, or feel forced to for gear. There isn't much skill just a long haul slog. Oh you have no healers? You just get dicked on for hours

this is why I want to play mage, conjurings, portals, I also like to dps in pvp/pve. 
---
Okay here you go the key to tanking in vanilla. 1. Tab is your best friend. 2. Sunder armor. Now spam both of them. How i start normally is bloodrage demoshout or battle shout as they run in. Taunt your main focus target because 5 seconds for sure aggro on them tab to next target sunder armor, while using cleave instead of heroic strike. Then tab to next hit sunder again. Pop back to taunted mob and sundet 2x and a cleave off them then tab through the other mobs maintaining sunder. If someone pulls off you just taunt the mob and slap another sunder armor on it. All while cleaving until youre down to the last mob at that point start pooling rage for next pull. Rinse and repeat.
---
Bonus Honor = 43
---
Another way to learn how to be a good tank is to spend time playing a healer. It is a good way to learn the instances (which is super important as tank), and it gives you a way to see the difference between what good tanks do and what bad tanks do. You will very much appreciate the warrior who uses shield block for example, but also the value of marking targets, watching for mana, etc.
---
This has been my approach with a paladin. I spec hybrid holy/prot so I can heal or tank, and then when doing a new dungeon for the first time, I go as healer a few times before going as tank.
---
Sarcastic doesn't mean salty or bitter.
---
Now who's making assumptions?
---
You said it's because caster gear is bad while melee dps gear is good. How does that explain specs like ret, enhancement, and feral being so far behind? I'll help you out, it's because they're horribly designed specs. It's not about caster vs melee, it's about warriors being much better designed and balanced than the other hybrid classes but people here ignore that warriors get to be good at two roles while harping on about how it's a good thing that hybrids are only good at one.
---
Go back to your raid finder brother. You’re literally arguing that the same point as me except it’s from a more casual point of view. Look up the current subscriber numbers and compare it to classics and then let me know which one you think was more successful 
---
I appreciate the responses friend, cyu in classic!
---
Min/Maxing isn't as prevalent as people claim. You will be able to play whatever race you want. That's not going to really penalize you in the long run. If your aiming to be in THE TOP guild, then they might be a bit stricter, but as long as you can prove yourself. I wouldn't worry.
---
You answer like a 14 year old girl. Say what you mean like a man.
---
Also automatic BG grouping wasn't even a thing yet and reputation was split across the group for some objectives so people formed their own groups at the start of the match. Inevitably you'd have a raid of 20ish people and several smaller parties/raids. Some eventually joined up but it was rare to get everyone in the same raid until automatic grouping in... 1.12
---
Well to counter that, the items you get are replaced in BWL with some possibly lasting AQ. Only way I'd ever sink that amount of effort into a non-raid item would be if it was bis until Naxx or for the whole game.
---
Out of curiosity, what makes you say people would only do a few AVs? I continued to do them back in the day even after hitting exalted and obtaining all of the gear. Why? Because it was fun, it was end game content that was a giant battle. You didn't get that anywhere else.
---
I can go into more specific reasons why at least I found these major battles to be enjoyable. I also don't believe I'm the only one.
---
What?  Guilds love fury warriors.  You’re just expected to have an off tanking set for fights that need it.  
---
You should stop feeding him man.
---
&gt;The rest are complaining that even when PServers implemented old AV, people still rushed the bosses anyway, LOL!
---
They should just make one side always be a russian premade. Even on current retail they prefer to grind down the opposition near the middle, maybe capping one or two towers or sneak-capping the mines. Winning on reinforcements, or loosing, which they do like half the time in my experience. 
---
Check your feat of strengths pvp tab(?) On the character in question. You should see it there I think. What title do you have? Rank 10 would be Lieutenant Commander on alliance and Champion(?, Not positive, horde ranks are confusing) on horde.
---
AV rep farm takes literally a AV weekend if you play 10h/day. 
---
Exactly this is what I wanted to know.  Thanks.  
---
Agree with most of this but I'd add Balance (all specs, really) do fine against Mages. I wouldn't necessarily sit in the open and face tank everything they have against you, but with a bit of ranging and/or LoS, dots, charge and self heals hold up quite well if you find yourself in a 1v1.
---
Yeah they're replaced eventually, but the raids are going to be progressively released. If AV is out early enough, that gear would be exceptionally strong for a good while.
---
Either way, July is really optimistic. They're still sticking with the overly broad "summer" release for a reason. Summer doesn't end until late September.
---
&gt; I mean, games sometimes ended up a grindfest even in tbc, and the game would end on reinforcements.
---
They still do in retail if you play against Russians. 
---
I disagree, let the fucks fly free
---
This is a joke right? Wow, even vanilla, is not a hard game. People from retail will be fine.
---
I can respect that, you want to pose in major cities and have people whisper you. 
---
But at least we all can stop pretending it's all about putting in effort and time. 
---
Everyone can get lvl 60 and farm 1k.
---
Sarcasm could also be a connotation good call there I can see the sarcasm in your comments for sure, they all link back to same thing. You seem to be in general an unpleasant person to interact with and enjoy the attention you get by it. Have fun in classic.
---
In my guild we only had one, a fury war is like a shadow priest, they an use. It's not like they're gonna take over the dps slots over rogues, or even huntards
---
CoE really should buff nature :(
---
Thank you. You went straight to the point. Advice taken.
---
If you ever thought about making a video guide with different scenarios, like the ones you describe here and others, it would be well worth watching.
---
Yeah but thankfully it's not pre-1.12 AV. Otherwise it might take until those raids came out to even reach Exalted.
---
Yup!
---
Sure the old AV had it's flaws and a lot of people just wanted it over to get the gear. Yet the "new" AV is just a hallow shell of what it was. With more xp'ed players, I think the old AV will be just fine. 
---
Cause I have issues, it seems. What would be a good choice for 1440 gsync?
---
100+ player fights are virtually non-existent
---
earlier summer the better. come fall I work 45 hrs/week and part time grad school. the earlier the better and i'll be able to take some vacation off 
---
Just a single cap mistake turns it in to turtle mode😏 so much fun.... 🤩
---
They cant do it in the time frame allowed.  
---
Mage has a really good balance in kit. Can solo pve/pvp. Or can group.
---
Minor corrections: The era you're referencing is back before Strat and Scholo became 5man and BRS 10man, they all were practically minor raids (10-15man respectively). Even J Allen Brack got that wrong in his Blizzcon announcement speech (which gives me some reason for worry). Agree with the content tho.
---
I'm sorry to see you're so socially insecure that you need everyone to be all smiles to feel safe in a conversation.
---
Have fun in Classic.
---
It's not the greatest experience. The game runs good but with a lot of bugs
---
And not having them at all is the right representation of vanilla? That makes even less sense
---
waND NOW !!!
---
Oh, I misinterpreted it. 
---
I’m all for no changes to the levelling speed and having a brief window for these mounts. I think that they should be rare. 
---
I can assure you, it did not take that long. Hyperbole isn't helpful for people who may not understand what it was actually like.
---
I can tell you're a PvE player because you talk about the game as if PvP doesn't even exist. All of those specs you listed might struggle a bit in PvE endgame, but you're complaining about specs that were originally designed to be leveling specs. Yeah they don't perform as well at endgame raid DPS because Blizzard assigned end game PvE *class* roles, not *spec* roles. 
---
And Feral Druids aren't even as bad as you say. They can manage about 700-900 DPS on single target in BWL *and* they can tank. The real problem with Feral DPS is that they don't have any AoE, not that they lack damage.
---
Sucks that Enhancement and Ret aren't top 10 percentile of the meters or whatever you expected but that doesn't mean they're bad specs. You can still raid as those specs through all content just fine. People have done it a million times on private servers.
---
Problem for horde in a rush AV is we always loose.. Its only when alliance fuck up we get the suprise win
---
Fair enough. Either way it's not pre 1.12 AV so kind of a moot point. Sorry you didn't get what you wanted out of AV but some of us did. 
---
The healer is a sub focus. The tank is the true target and the healer needs to play better to not pull threat. Because that is an issue with vanilla. Tanking in general got a lot easier though the different expansions of wow. If you shield/prehot me as a warrior tank good luck with that aggro most of the time because of how the game works. Rage generation is a huge issue in vanilla as a tank. I cant tell you how many times on the private server i play on now i have to sit down to get crit so I can get more rage because of hoe geared my warrior is for 5 man dungeons. So healers need to be willing and be confident in their ability to let a tank get lower then half hp at the beginning in order to help them establish threat because we all know that the dps is going to give the tank zero time for threat.
---
They didn't really have exclusivity in Vanilla. Almost everyone upgraded them to the armour models when they were added and a quest came out to do so. The non-armour models weren't about being in a special club, they just literally hadn't done them yet.
---
Now you defined another shitty problem. I don't have a usb port and I am using my current mouse with a usb-converter which makes latency. Even I get Apple dongle it may not fix the latency problem and probably same applies for the keyboard which would be the worst thing in the game
---
Can you explain what this is and the benefit? 
---
Okay team, help me out here.
---
Priest, Shaman or Paladin?
---
I want to heal, and I want to wear armor designed for my class. I also think things like walk on water are so neat, and I worry that priest doesn't have anything like that. (I mained druid from vanilla to MoP and my favorite part of that was things like aquatic form, and flight form and teleport to moonglade, you know, things that really made druids feel unique. I worry that priest will just feel kind of generic). 
---
Couldn't agree more. I've tanked all 5-mans in vanilla, so I kind of know the basics. I have no ambitions of maintanking endgame, so I guess what I'm looking for in a guide is something in between Scarlet Monastery and Molten Core.
---
It basically gives you a free armor slot to put good gear that gives cool stats like strength in rather than level 40 gloves that give percent hit. 
---
Will easily do it then.
---
1) There is a huge difference between time-gating content and having content from different patch versions in the game at once. Use your brain.
---
2) Too bad. They need to be strict about sticking to one patch; if any piece of content is imported from an older patch version, not only is that a significant amount of development time and testing that needs to be devoted to it (it was an enormous undertaking getting 1.12 to work) but it opens the floodgates for people to demand x version of y feature for just about anything. Hell, people are already doing it with classes. The only realistic way to do it is to manually recreate the older AV types and that sets a precedent for vanilla WoW to effectively become a separate development branch from retail WoW, which is also something that is imperative to avoid.
---
1.12 means 1.12, period, for better or for worse (and I can confidently say that it's for better at least 99.9% of the time). While the prospect of a BG going for a period of *days* may get people excited, hopefully the nostalgic airheads of the forums will take a moment to consider the clear and obvious downside of BGs that go for that long. 1.12 AV still had quests, troop upgrades, and summonable bosses and not every game was a zerg. People were often spending hours in AV well into TBC.
---
They should be, the ivory raptor is the best mount in vanilla
---
Exactly. Classic community; yet here we are bombarded by stupid posts about “change this class” or “add this feature”. 
---
Wouldn’t be mad if Bliz said fuck it and scrapped it (they won’t, but in principle) since y’all complain about every little thing.
---
Play. The. Game. 
---
MAOR DAWTZ
---
I wouldn't call it moot. The game has not been released yet and they could still adjust design decisions. I imagine that since there are so many discussions about AV, this was a way to get the community talking about it more to see where people stand. That's not to say they will change how things are, but it's surely not final yet.
---
I'm glad you're happy, but some of us are still fighting for more of a middle ground, even if we don't get exactly what we want.
---
I will run it on a Mac...
---
Honestly... Yes.
---
That's a pretty terrible reason for blowing off a pretty good game.
---
Yep, there reached a point where instead of people shouting "JOIN AV IT'S FINALLY UP!" and have gleeful players spend days in there... you had people groan "fuck it's AV weekend, guess I should level fishing :("
---
I fully agree with 
---
&gt; the feelings of the playerbase back in actual vanilla is not necessarily representative of the Classic community.
---
The people who will play Classic in 2019-2022 are not the same people who played it in the past. Some will, but it is more of a tight niche now a days.
---
Some people need a reminder that summer is 3 months away and they still haven't done public testing.
---
It has no relevance to what we are discussing.
---
I like how RP wholesome all the player's names are.  Now I swear everyone has some stupid pun name.
---
not sure how this is just an assumption, theres a reason blizzard is not showing subscriber numbers, and also why they keep giving free membership time every month (its because nobody plays)
---
And that's a very fair assessment. Something I didnt really consider is how the synergies buff the other classes but not shamans.
---
huter top dps. FAKE NEWS!
---
I’m currently playing on a private server on my girlfriends Macbook Air from 2014 hooked up to a 55” tv with an external mouse and keyboard attached - it’s actually going great! I’m using ~medium settings and got 50-60 fps :-)
---
You aren't the only one but you are a vast minority. I've been following subreddits and reading about classic/vanilla for years now.
---
I am someone who would also do avs at exalted, they feel amazing especially summoning ivus. But the 1.12 vs 1.8 etc doesn't kill the large battle esque gameplay. You don't believe me? Recap stonehearth and watch the old style that appears.  Out of 40 players chat I can read about 30 always bitch if an av last longer than 30 minutes. Now a couple people say, ohhh I love this, so much fun.
---
Now there's a big argument about how the weight of players will shift from pservers to classic in mentality or playstyle. And im not going to join in this discussion we will never see the numbers so I won't attempt to argue one way or the other.
---
Fury warriors are some of the best dps in the game.. Hunters? lol
---
I don't think any of the common vanilla mangos db viewers support viewing suffixes. If you're handy with databases you could download it and look at the item template table joined against the random suffix table. Though the random suffix table in mangos is pretty bad.
---
One thing you can do is make a list of items you're curious about then look up their item ids on Allakhazam.
---
For example in the following url the item id is 7470.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=7470
---
Take that id then paste it into an Allakhazam url
---
https://web.archive.org/web/20060114191729/http://wow.allakhazam.com:80/db/item.html?witem=7470
---
The essence of AV, at least from my experience, is having to take out towers before the end boss. If you can just zerg the boss and kill them, what's the point of the BG anyways?
---
The towers being objectives means you can defend towers, which is much better gameplay than just turtling.
---
I'd expect that zerging the last boss is only possible when players are highly geared? Or is that possible even early on?
---
Edited above
---
Don't thunderclap for threat. (It doesn't do much.) Battle Shout/Demo Shout for aoe threat.
---
Make a macro to mark kill target as Skull. (Hopefully party members follows that.)
---
There is a lot to tanking, but if you follow those two things you are on the right track.
---
The only thing it rewards is an overwhelming amount of free time to play WoW. I’m a veteran, I’m gonna fuck up some Classic, but at a rate of only 8-10 hours a week; however, I also would love the original epic mounts when I do hit 60 four to six months into Classic.
---
I agree on your first point. Hope we'll learn what Blizzard has in mind soon enough. 
---
I adamantly disagree. I’m a no change believer, but at launch you aren’t even going to be able to enjoy playing due to the volume of players. I would rather up until level 20 zones be sharded so I can at least half way enjoy being able to play. 
---
No changes to the game, but man, that’s just one I can get behind. Then after the first month is over, turn off all sharding. But I do think it’s necessary. Only way I think it’s not necessary is if they release a very healthy number of servers to really spread the playerbase with.
---
It really fucking is. 5 weapon skill is almost 3% hit
---
The meta has changed.  
---
No problem. It’s always hard to tell if people are just trying to be dicks lol
---
So around level 50, you get a quest from the hippie in Thunderbluff or pressumably Darnassus to gather I think 60 Morrowgrain for "Morrowgrain Research" quest. You get some xp and some reputation. After that, the quest is repeatable for a small bit of rep.
---
You consume the seeds (Which you buy from that NPC) and use Ungoro Soil (Which you farm in Ungoro) and it creates a pod. Inside the pod is a chance for morrowgrain or some low to mid-level herbs. You can grow a pod every hour.
---
I recall getting a lot of Peacebloom and Gromsblood.
---
I've got an old receiver and a few old speakers.  I may wire up a 4.1 system just for the launch.
---
You could probably do the same pretty easily with some secondhand gear.
---
People are allowed to be bad. Do what you want.
---
Tarren Mill vs Southshore, World Bosses, raid entrace fights. There are plenty of videos of one raid wiping another PvE raid. Okay, maybe not 100+ but 70+.
---
I see a lot of answers here saying yes... in HARDCORE guild, this is not true. During the try hard period you will have to be optimal. Later, maybe.
---
But for PROGRESSION guilds, yes you will be fine.
---
There’s a huge difference between the 2
---
No one knows for sure atm. But they will likely be added to the game in the AQ patch.
---
If the mac is your work laptop maybe ask your workplace if you can switch to a real laptop? It would be cheaper and they could re-purpose that one for someone else
---
Vanilla tanking comes down to the pull/quickly reacting to things getting out of control.
---
To start getting used to tanking use the following rotation.
---
Mark skull kill target:  range pull skull, blood rage (rage generation generates threat), battleshout, (battleshout in vanilla is a major threat generator as it gives threat based on who you buff), sunder/revenge/hs/shield slam.  Don’t forget that you’ll need to tab over to the other mobs and generate threat on them as well.  
---
This rotation will ensure all pulled targets come to you, even if say a healer has a hot on you.  
---
Get used to using line of site when pulling.
---
Helps to add your target markers to your 1-9 on the keypad as well.  
---
Anyways lots to tanking in vanilla but hopefully that helps some.

Authenticator bag size increase. 
---
Honor theft is not a joke!  Millions of guilds suffer every year!
---
Are you planning on pushing high ranks in PvP? Is your focus primarily BGs or World PvP? The answers you get will vary a bit depending on what your goals are.
---
**Enhancement** **Shaman** is not a meme spec. It is just a far cry from an optimal one. Many tend to forget you have a lot more going than just your auto-attacks and Stormstrike. You are a hybrid, melee, spellcaster and support. They can be fairly strong when played well, but will almost always be inferior to **Restoration** or **Elemental** when played in a BG setting. In World PvP or 1v1 situations they do a lot better though.
---
**Warrior** is as you seem to have understood, a powerhouse with gear and support. Do you have friends you are planning to play with? Are any of them healers? Are you otherwise prepared to invest the extra time it takes to get consumables and engineering? A well played **Warrior** is scary, but a mediocre one will be kited until they pull their power plug in sheer frustration. 
---
**Warlock** is similar to **Warrior** in the sense that you don't really start building steam until you've acquired some gear. When you have though they are absolute monsters, but solo and in group. You have good damage, an incredible toolkit, with some of the best CC the game has to offer. They only become "bursty" though when specced into **Destruction,** a PvP spec many seasoned **Warlocks** tend to frown upon.
---
Of course all of this is pure speculation. We simply do not know how the player mentality and class diversity will look like in Classic. Maybe your server will be full of **Fire Mages**, **Balance Druids** and **Melee Hunters**. One can hope
---
Ultimately I would ask myself, what type of player do I want to be? Do you want to have the option to don a shield and tank a few dungeons? Are you partial to healing, just to switch it up? Go with your gut here, numbers and statistics will only  get you so far.
---
Good luck in your adventures!
---
"+ chance to hit" is very much a thing, and something dps warriors stack religiously, up to 15% or so (forgot the exact number), to the point where many of the best dungeon items for dps warriors are actually leather pieces intended for rogues, due to their +hit and +crit stats. 
---
Either way while weapon skill does give +hit, that's not the main reason it's good. The main reason is that it reduces your chance to get a "glancing blow" against mobs higher level than you (bosses are considered lvl 63). So 5 extra weapon skill is a massive increase in damage, several percent at least for a warrior (difficult to calculate exactly due to rage generation and stuff). 
---
Oh of course, man. You’ll have to zone bounce to level effectively without as much grinding. Plenty of time to pop over to EK for STV and such
---
Hence why everybody starts to rush. And the closer you get towards that 12 hour mark, the more people who will want to start rushing. (Realistically the limit for most people will be the 2 hour mark.)
---
It takes 5 seconds to google, and besides, it's common sense.
---
Like what, you think you could be able to transfer your 1 million retail gold to classic?
---
I'm sorry but if you're over the age of 8 it's pretty simple stuff.
---
I subscribe to the same mindset as you, but there's still a cost for progrwssion
---
Makes sense.
---
Any Druid spec can play that game though as long as they're wearing intellect gear. If anything, Feral can play the stall/LoS game better than Balance (assuming they're both wearing the same set of gear) because of the extra intellect from Heart of the Wild.
---
You don’t seem to understand why sharding is coming. 
---
There are going to be an influx of people in the starting zones that have no intention—you know what? Just watch the Blizzcon video. “Restoring Classic”
---
Nah, not really. It's my personal computer and I use it for work :)
---
I think its safe to assume that it will be similar if not identical to retail
---
We used to put a DI on people during raids and watch them freak out and reconnect over and over trying to move, while ignoring everyone telling them to dismiss the spell in chat
---
Druid is true neutral they care about balance of nature my dude.
---
You're right that it doesn't kill the large battles, but it doesn't incentivise it either. Elements like difficult NPCs can slow the gameplay down, but not stall it for hours. Keeping in loot drops from players for turn ins also rewards having longer encounters. With multiple elements that can slow down the BG length there is less and less of a reason for a majority of players to not rush for a quick finish. Hell it can get to a point where AV can be significantly shorter than a long contested WSG or even AB.
---
So yes, these fights can still exist, it's just more more unlikely without the incentive to.
---
I agree it's difficult to argue with the private server community. My personal best bet for my ideal experience will be trying to keep away from them, and streamers.
---
And once in a life time gets atiesh but this is a dream I dont dare to dream
---
Do you have usb ports? Or do you use type c to usb convertor for the mouse and the keyboard?
---
Ive been preaching shaman tank for years! Nobody believes me when i say it was viable so im so happy to see someone else spreading the gospel.
---
It was one of many catchup mechanics they added in per patch like ZG is a catch up raid. Same with AQ20
---
&gt; Only way I think it’s not necessary is if they release a very healthy number of servers to really spread the playerbase with.
---
And as Blizzard has already said, they would rather not do this because this would result in lots of low population servers in the long run, instead of a lower numbers of servers with healthy population. It's inevitable that the game will get a lot of new players coming in and checking out the game and will eventually leave. They won't be in for the long haul. So lots of servers will become ghost towns eventually, which would suck. Cause then everyone needs to deal with server merges, etc.
---
When I take a look at that, it says Sergeant. I mean, I guess I could be wrong, but I am nearly certain I reached Lieutenant Commander.
---
I have 2 usb ports, but i guess you could use usb-c or Firewire too?
---
This. I agree
---
&gt; With shaman you have to choose between windfury or threat reduction.
---
That’s not true. The guy doing Windfury for the Fury Warrior has to totem weave in grace of air with Windfury. 
---
Even D&amp;D players often consider strict alignments dumb.  They are meant to be guidelines, not rigid definitions.

&gt; DangerSpud#4341
---
just sent you a friend request!
---
I have a group
---
Agreed. And, although Balance works fine, I preferred the Feral variant too. The option of switching into form for some good non-mana-based damage was a lifesaver in a number of close/long fights.
---
If the guild leader is looking to get world first clears, he probably already recruited his full roster a month ago anyways. Probably requires 2-3 level 60's for split clear raiding as well.
---
Can you clear all content in the week it launches as a dwarf warrior? Yeah.
---
Or they can't. Life happens you know. You cross the street, get hit by a car, you have to go to a hospital for 3 months.
---
That is the point, I wanted to bring up. Everything in Classic is achievable at some point, of course with time investment, but WHEN you do it is up to you. It doesn't have to be in a timeframe. Unless it's like the Lunar Festival. Hence the suggestion with the WoW anniversary.
---
In the end, I prob just grab one for the exclusivity.
---
Priests have Levitate which is similar to water walking iirc.
---
Different account throughout the years maybe? My original rank 11 rogue is on a separate account from the one I'm currently on, so it doesn't show Commander to me.
---
Srsly? You downvote me, for sharing how I lvld back then? 
---
Relax friend, where in my post did I say anything like that? I said that's what I do.
---
Interestingly, my buddies and I never really used Vent. We always typed to each other or played in the same room.
---
Aww, you never pushed for the remaining half? Maybe you should have taken a month break from it minimum.
---
I think half of it in a month is pretty impressive actually.
---
I mean. If it's a nuke that hurts notging. more than that single mosquito then why not? It'll be beautiful. 
---
jontron, xyshina, chris, slamulous. PepeHands
---
Yes. You are correctly describing the welfare blue that was the IBS. Vanilla wasn't hardcore you NPC.
---
I mained a female gnome warrior in Vanilla and TBC. I didn’t tank until BC, but I can tell you the best way to learn to tank is join a guild and tank. I was asked to switch from dps to protection spec because one of our main tanks wanted to go back to playing his hunter. 
---
So I tried it out. It was a bit of a learning curve but my guild was patient and I soon found tanking more fun than dps. I loved being so small coming up the boss’s ankles 😜😜😜. I have great memories of tanking The Prince in Kara and Gruul. 
---
&gt; I would rather up until level 20 zones be sharded
---
Im not even sure its necessary to go *that* high, honestly.  Im not a huge #nochanges guy even, but lvl 10 would probably be sufficient, *maybe* even the starting areas only (where your character spawns).
---
I do think they should probably be ready to extend it to 20 if absolutely needed, but i kind of doubt that'll even be necessary.
---
/whoosh
---
Idk about dbm or the other one but personally I’m not using Add ons until raiding or pvp at 60
---
The first game in 1.5 AV lasted 4 days on my server
---
1.8 was a better game
---
1.12 is a lot more casual friendly version
---
&gt; When we're talking 5+ it's battle shout and heroic strike all the way.
---
Why would you use Heroic Strike over Sunder?
---
Resto shaman and prot warrior. Loved by experience in vanilla 
---
I will Join I plan On Maining a Melee dps Mage
---
why need anything other than dme tho?
---
lasher farm + a bit of herbing. Sometimes u find books too.
---
later in zg u can farm the first 3 bloodvines but u need an invisibility potion each run then /camp to leave without a 2nd pot
---
what do you think you said? you basically said you don't play av so you don't care what they do with it
---
how is that different from my example? some people enjoyed av, should they get to play the version that they enjoy? or do you only care about yourself?
---
Maybe, maybe not. It's really hard to say, how everything will work out, with how Blizzard created the stages now.
---
I think Rogues shine in the early stages of PvP. Just the way I feel.
---
Man its a good feeling when she finally comes down and you know its usually a kill at that point
---
Honestly to me a lot of this seems like a lot of noise from people who either weren't there or were too young to understand what was happening.
---
The changes happened yeah, and it did make playing defense a lot easier. And sure I might buy that changed the way AV was played, but it never felt like that to me. 
---
What it felt like was a bunch of people realizing that playing defense was a miserable, unfun experience which didn't even give you any significant rewards, and both sides tacitly optimizing their return on time invested by just rushing past each other. You either win or lose in 15 minutes which generates much more honor than a 6 hour long stalemate at the bridge.
---
I legitimately think this would have persisted in any version of AV, with stronger NPCs and more efficient chokepoints only making the PVE vs PVE experience take longer instead of making it the tug-of-war it was back in the day.
---
People who want no changes really need to temper expectations; there will be changes simply in the way other people play the game and there's nothing you can do about it.
---
Since I do not believe I have met my quota of hot takes, let me just say that the Rank 14 grind was horrible and the game will be better for it being changed.
---
&gt; Go back to your raid finder brother. 
---
I've not played since Wrath.
---
&gt; You’re literally arguing that the same point as me except it’s from a more casual point of view 
---
No really? Do you know what's the main population that's gonna play Classic? Hint : it begins with "cas" and ends with "uals".
---
I have a 1070 and a I7-8700k, i run every game i play at the moment at 1440p and 144hz on that same monitor.
---
No need for anything more than that in my opinion. Playing division 2 at the moment without any issues 
---
Then you will enjoy watching this https://youtu.be/9gpjtO8PMPE
---
As long as more than half the raid isn’t dead by that point anyway
---
morrowgrain is used for crafting herb bags too
---
It’ll definitely be huge on launch, off the top of my head the big streamers streaming it will be sodapoppin, shroud, asmongold, summit. 
---
The one thing he didn’t really cover is LoS pulling. It’s pretty self explanatory, but you should do it every pull. That’s where you need to be decisive and tell people where to be. I use a double jump to indicate. “Stand here. Hunter trap here. Don’t sheep until he passes that box.” You also want to mark mobs with a right click, you can hotkey them, but I’m not sure how. 
---
Getting into a 3 day AV is part of the fun. Time limits such.
---
Considering going MT for my guild, which means warrior. What am I expected to do as an MT (outside of actually tanking raids and dungeons)? Which professions would come in handy? Do I need BS for pre-raid BiS?
---
It's possible to Zerg because by 1.12 there were fewer, weaker NPCs.
---
I've seen plenty of subwoofers from old theatre systems at thrift stores. I'll keep an eye out for one and plug it right into the bass line out
---
Well tbh 95% of this sub wanted no changes accept for when it comes to AV. They are clearly timegating content so why should we get the 1.8 AV with added mobs and bosses etc? Kind of silly
---
or that one level 51 killing wolves to grind a level
---
Thank you for pointing this out.
---
how much do rogues make with brd pickpocketing until the barman?
---
how much is bloodvine farm? those first 3 nodes
---
or zg crocodile aoe
---
By definition of a hardcore guild no.
---
A normal guild that still does PvE raid content, sure.
---
&gt; Hit Shield Block when rage is available as well. This isn't good for threat, but good for damage mitigation.
---
Shield block + revenge is more threat per rage than sunder and even Shield Slam. It’s smart to lead with it. 
---
I think keeping lost of the guards would have been a good decision to keep AV interesting
---
a - I can get a type C mouse and there is no type C gaming mouse
---
b - My current method, usb dongle makes latency
---
and no firewire anymore, I have only 4 type c 
---
Yeah I made the mistake of trying to explain everything at once to a friend of mine while playing together. Now I just let him do what he wants and only give tips when he isn't enjoying himself due to bad performance.
---
do they spawn in the same spot?
---
I grinded Exalted in 1.5 and 1.6
---
It was brutal, but but I have about 24,000 kills on my pure PVE character JUST from those two patches.
---
Woah that’s a beast right there!
---
And make them titanforging up to super epic mounts.
---
I kept my Commander title all the way until I quit playing at the end of BC, it was the only pvp title I could select and it was the highest ranking I reached back when pvp titles were apart of the game. Perhaps it was another character you reached thank rank?
---
Yeah seriously.  Who's shelling out $50 for a reboot of an old game?  Im ok with the sub, as long as the game holds its worth over time.  But so many of the other xpacs sucked and I quit after a month.  Im not handing over $ until the game is proven a success (its not 2004 anymore).  
---
Nice I’m currently doing this quest and will see if I can bank in on folks like you! Supply and demand!
---
[Full raid composition/namelist](https://i.imgur.com/FzHPMgz.jpg)
---
Just for you :)
---
Damn these graphics look legit for back in the day haha 
---
Are you calling my tauren Druid Terrabull stupid?
---
I would agree.. but the division 2 is pretty trash lol, perhaps a 2/10 on a good day, but not even close to something id recommend spending money on. If it was f2p itd be half decent I guess.
---
Honestly, if youre leveling your warrior, just tank every instance once and youll learn as you go.
---
The basics and some tips;
---
Sunder gives high threat, youll learn how to manage multiple targets as you go, Revenge is the best for threat, but isnt always available.
---
Your healer is your life, save him above all else, if hotshot DPSers are hitting the wrong targets, they want to tank on their own and you can let them die if they really want.
---
Watch your health, potion if you have to, Hamstring and kite a bit if needed.
---
Charge pulls are great if youre not going to pull extra mobs with it, especially with tactical mastery, which youll usually have while leveling. A lot of warriors are afraid to charge pull anything in 5mans and they shouldnt be.
---
Especially when blizzard said there will be no cross play from classic to retail.
---
Did you even read the blue post?
---
If the DPS get threat it's their fault.
---
If the healer gets threat it's the tank's fault.  Either the tank didn't get enough threat or the tank is taking too much damage.
---
set a bad precedent and gives them a reason to fall back on sharding every, single, time, theres server load.
---
Server balance =/= server load. It's not about what you think it is.
---
I was worried for a while about playing a class that is saturated. Like no one used to play warlocks back in the day, so I was thinking of playing one to be social in the same way. However, I suspect now that everyone is researching the crap out of the game in anticipation there will likely be tons of warlocks. Trying not to think about it so much, but that kind of thing gets me. For this, it may be that tons more people play warrior, and honestly that is a great thing for the game!
---
What? This still happens in retail.
---
Scarab Lord Title wasn’t in vanilla.
---
For real this game has been floating on nostalgia for multiple expansions now. Almost everyone who subs to wow for the last 3 expacs is subbing because they want to play the game they used to. Instead when they log in. It's like some homoculus murdered their old friend and started wearing his skin pretending to be him. New wow is garbage and will be nearly dead in a year. It's a product no one wanted and no one asked for.
---
There were two people back in Vanilla/BC days that were well known in the tanking community and had some amazing guides out – Ciderhelm and Sartrina. Now you have to go digging with the way back machine to find some of their stuff. Here are some of the more popular guides:

---
Hope you find those helpful and/or interesting!
---
You realise things like enemy health bar text and enemy casts etc aren't shown by default in Vanilla? Not saying you can't play without that information (plenty did) but there's a great deal of QOL UI changes that aren't in Vanilla by default.
---
no changes as in - nothing added that was not in vanilla
---
pre npc nerf av WAS IN VANILLA - actually longer than nerfed npc's
---
it's not silly, it's a better representation than the bandaids added in the last patch for some things. so we should have cross realm at launch? so the items added/changed in 1.12 should be in the game at release? THAT is silly
---
but in the end, you admit you dont like/play av, so why are you even commenting? if we had classic wotlk discussion, I wouldn't jump in and give my 2 cents because I don't like wotlk and I shouldn't be able to modify that to fit my needs - when I don't like it anyways. same with you, if you don't like av, why the heck are you trying to advocate for it to be made a certain way - it doesn't effect you, stay out of it 
---
What's wrong with Alliance Warlock? I was 10 during Vanilla so I don't remember this. 
---
 What's wrong with Alliance Warlock? I was 10 yo during Vanilla so I don't remember this. 
---
Dwarf fury warrior... Hnnnnnnng. It doesn't get any better than that.
---
Priest means no compromising on armor design for stats (Paladin in cloth). Priest has MIND CONTROL. If that's not cool idk what is.
---
Shaman has a lot of off spec variety for the fun aspect. I can't remember if they have the second hearthstone in vanilla.
---
Paladin has a lot of utility that nobody else has, mostly blessings. Alliance is stronger solely because of BoSalvation in PVE  and 10 seconds of immune healing in PVP.
---
IMO priest is my top contender between all healers because I want MC.
---
There are guilds that won't take you because you chose Night Elf for your Priest.  They've told me adamantly on this very sub.
---
It's really a roll of the dice on finding the guild that fits your playstyle.
---
Which ones though? The minibosses defending the main boss was nerfed and there are fewer?
---
Or ar you talking about optional NPCs? I didn't play vanilla AV because I was only at 45 when BC dropped.
---
This. The only way you’d get a raptor before cloth turn-ins is if mounts are BoU. 
---
It will be just a welfare item now, sadly.
---
If anything, not having sharding sets a bad precedent for the future of Classic. Do you want another Diablo 3 launch? People being locked off of the vanilla experience just because of a desire for authenticity is a dumb idea. We all know there will be a ton of tourists and curious players who will want to try the game at launch, especially considering the very low pay wall to just try the game (regular wow subscription). Why make the launch experience worse for everyone? Nobody cares about sharding in the first few levels, I know that you understand this. And I know that yes, it could set a precedent. But sharding is unfortunately necessary to have the best customer experience possible and guarantee a future for this game. Let's not forget that Blizzard wants to sell a marketable product and one that crashes all the time or lags a lot is not very appealing.
---
Fewer overall NPCs and the remaining ones were all nerfed. So yes mini bosses and patrols and the sorts.
---
OMG I LOVE YOU
---
Its all about what values you’re allowed to read from the game and what actions you’re allowed to call.  It unlikely they’re going to unlock spell casting from being a protected function like it was on Vanilla.  
---
Good point. The mentality did change, OG AV was oldschool pvp adventure zone where AV itself was reward enough for players to join.
---
Players then wanted to min-max thier rewards pr hour and Blizzard complied. In a way that is the whole story of WoW from Vanilla to BFA. 
---
Will Classic be for the players with Oldschool adventure mentality or New school reward mentality. Blizz in this case is choosing new school even though, for alot of people, Classic is a way for them to return to the oldschool mentality. 
---
It might not be possible to return so who knows what is best. 
---
Yeah I realize that but I want to get that kind of experience that I missed. 
---
Man, I hate to be that guy but I missed this train.  Why the hate for him?
---
Is making any effort of all in an MMO considered hardcore? That is why retail has become what it is today.
---
I sure hope they'll be available at launch. I'm planning my character/questing route according to them. 
---
So if you wrote an addon that intended to have that function it simply would fail to run?
---
i think you would really like classic and you should give it a shot! one great thing about it is that a feeling of fun and meaningful progression can be obtained at any level and people who want to rush to max will be in the minority. so if you can only play a few times a week, something like classic might actually be better than you for live.
---
i agree with what other people are saying about not looking too heavily into guides and just going with the flow, and will also say to keep in mind that most guides you see now will have been made by the really REALLY enthusiastic people who've been playing on private servers for years and min/maxing their experience. so even if a guide says say... a priest NEEDS to be dwarf because of fear ward or an ally rogue NEEDS to be human because of weapon skill bonus, it's pretty small in the long run and this talk is usually by and for people who want to squeeze every last improvement out of their characters. which isn't a bad thing, but probably not what you have in mind
---
 Social activity is more of person than class trait. You can be 100% known rogue at a server  if you engage in all combats and ask every passer by whether you can help them with smth or ask for help :)
---
If it is a bigger upgrade for me than it is for you, I am not a douche.  If a mage is getting +2 int from getting the staff, but I am getting more weapon damage and some spirit, I think its fine for warrior to take.
---
Being able to talk to vendors/quest givers while in cat/bear form would be nice.
---
Lame AF
---
Yes. https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/classic-content-plan/120346
---
Theres nothing in there that indicates they are doing progressive itemization of stats, only when certain items will be released. They even use Titanic Leggings as an example at the end.
---
No doubt. I guess this is just one of those times where memory gets fuzzy. No screenshots unfortunately.

Addons existed in vanilla...

That's fair, but it's still not a good reason to skip a game because it has multiple editions
---
Hello, i want to know the pro's and cons for Druid an Shaman for leveling, healing in PVE (dungeons and raids) and some casual PVP. Also, how would you rank them in difficulty level for healing in PVE? It's too hard to manage mana and totems with Shamans? And healing without a normal rez for Druids? And what class do you feel is the most rewarding? 
---
Bad bot
---
Half the horde plays undead.
---
Undead have a racial ability called "Will of the forsaken" that can break fear/charm and provide immunity for 5 seconds.
---
Warlocks entire pvp kit is designed around using fears/charms to slowly wittle away at the enemy.
---
This gives alliance warlocks a severe disadvantage in pvp.
---
there's definitely still room on eastern kingdoms for a nelf, especially as you get to higher levels where you're expected to travel to different zones a lot for quests. and you'll be very happy btw because you spend a LOT of time in stranglethorn vale (source: played on a pserver recently and ultimately came at level 28 and left for good at 46)
---
There is no law stating that there can't be a battleground that last for hours and/or days.
---
It is completely fine with having one bg that is unique in such a way. For the faster bgs you have warsong Gulch or arathi basin.
---
Yea, didn’t want to get too complicated with Shield Block + Revenge. 
---
There is a lot of nuance to tanking and it can get very complicated with large mob groups + Cc etc...
---
Best bet is to just learn your skills while leveling and tank as many dungeons as you can.
---
&gt; No one forces you to obtain rank 13 in 2 months
---
And no one forces you to get those mounts. Too bad if you don’t get them. 
---
Yeah but a talking cat/bear is just weird.
---
I may change my mind soon since I've picked druid to play 
---
Makes sense. Thanks for the tip!
---
Hey folks, the eternal struggle continues! I have it down to Warlock, rogue, or shaman. I played ally back in the day so wanted to do horde this time around for a new experience. (sort of) I really want to have a decent open would experience and also have a niche role I can play in the game. Like open lockboxes for some side money, or summon folks with a fancy summoning ritual, or throw tons of unique buff totems around. I will have limited time, and don't really want to heal on the shaman. I plan to run raids in end game and do pvp. I tend to be more of a loaner in my adult life, so will need to be able to get around on my own until i figure out how to make friends again! haha
---
Pre-nerf came out 1.8
---
We are clearly starting the launch on a lower "patch"
---
And I said I dont care for it, but it is an important part of vanilla for me atleast for the gear and rep. 
---
You’d get an error message about that value or action being protected, depending on what you are calling.
---
Presumably he meant Cleave, which is a good way to burn rage on AOE packs as it hits 2 targets. It's still higher threat I think to tab-sunder between targets, but cleave is the best way of getting rid of rage if you're rage capped.

lmao time gating is not changing anything within the patch. Essentially all they're doing is not allowing you to enter the instances.
---
If you think them gating off content means they're going to make changes to AV then you're delusional. Ones a significantly more time consuming project than the other, especially when they have no reliable data to reference.
---
Them using titanic leggings as an examples means nothing of what they will do to certain items that were in from earlier
---
Lmao do what you want but they will sell it retail. I’m going to buy it day one for sure - been playing private servers casually for a year or so now but avoided investing because it could get shut down..
---
If it was only the pserver community that migrates we’ll still have a populated few servers..
---
That’s fine. I’m dabbling in Addon making and didn’t want to end up accidentally banning myself
---
Hey, that was what it dumped out of the WoW client for the resolution I was running at the time.  The image was not modified in any way since the screenshot was taken, I even preserved the filenames.
---
I'm torn between a human mage and a night elf hunter, someone help! I'd love to hunter but I have some concerns. 
---
I want to be able to participate in all raids, and I want to be able to do great in pvp.
---
Mage obviously has a spot in all content, but my big fear is that after the first couple of raids it's going to be very difficult to get into groups as a hunter.
---
I also hear that hunter dps drops off pretty hard. If I go full try hard on a hunter, am I going to be anywhere near a mages dps in some of the later raids?
---
Hunter pvp looks great, so I'm not too worried there.
---
Yeah you can really see how out of whack this sub makes people. They've been sitting in their echo chamber for so long they've started to dream up things that are confirmed to not happen.
---
 "most of the drop rates and locations will look as they did in the patches prior to 1.10, with exceptions" literally word for word in the post
---
A GTX 1070 or better will be more than enough for 1440p/144Hz for Classic. Those cards are mostly out of stock now though, so I'd get a RTX 2060 or RTX 2070. Grab 16 GB of DDR4 and a 9600k or 9700k and you'll be set. The 9900k is supermassive overkill for Classic.
---
Hey theres a really good website called "logical increments" (Google it) that help with computer building. We don't know but I don't think Classic will be require a particularly high end computer, so anything from the "great"/"superb" category should do just fine. Of course, its your money! And if you are building yourself a PC to stand the test of time so to speak then maybe it is worth spending more now. 
---
&gt; And I said I dont care for it, but it is an important part of vanilla for me atleast for the gear and rep.
---
yeah, vanilla was too hard, let's make everything easier. I want dire maul gear at release, world dragons up early, so I can skip mc content because that's all I care about is gearing up
---
Likewise, the feelings of the private server community are not necessarily representative of the Classic community either. There's a middle ground to be met.
---
Are you trolling? What does it matter if they lost all prior databases? They literally said this in the post "We’ve gone back and reconstructed many of the most heavily affected drop tables as they existed prior to the 1.10 patch"
---
Sharding does not mean there is only a single server. Please read up on what sharding actually means.
---
Let us be 100% clear on what the problem with zerging is. It is NOT that people rush to kill the enemy generals, all BGs are about that. 
---
It IS That people IGNORE fighting each other altogether, literally run past each other on the field of strife and go right to the general, ending the BG in minutes with almost no player kills on either side. 
---
THAT is something that only honor and rep grinders want, because there’s certainly no PvP involved in it. 
---
Probably my favorite part of classic: a Druid is a Druid, regardless of spec. Your baseline toolkit doesn't change no matter how you spec.
---
Lol what you so mad about? You only get a ring or a healing offhand from AV. not really that gamebreaking
---
Yeah I had two 60's in Vanilla and both took about 12 days played to get there. 288 hrs each. 
---
System requirments:
---
* A source of electricity (medium potato)
---
* A smooth rock to chizel out threat numbers
---
*  A chair
---
Sorry that you want the whole AV to be changed for you regardless of patch progression or timegating.
---
So much has changed since I then. Will they allow MAGA guilds, ya think?
---
Balance? They are not balancing shit bro. 
---
If they are using patch 1.12 as a starting point, that means they will have mounts cost very little and riding skill would be the bulk of the cost.  If this is the case, everyone would buy a bunch of unarmored mounts before they go away, making them more common.
---
you're the one saying you want it easier so you get your gear from there and can leave
---
I don't care about the gear, I want it to be gotten the hardest way, and I want the best version of AV. again, if you don't like AV, WHY THE F ARE YOU TRYING TO COMMENT ON WHAT VERSION OF AV SHOULD BE IN CLASSIC?
---
Yeah. I’m not using them. 
---
Yes. Paladins are great healers 
---
Okay so the private server community spammed 1.12 #nochanges for the entirety of 2018 and now that they're getting that they complain?? 
---
I don't mind farming the soil but sometimes I can't get back to town to buy seeds
---
How is that in any way relevant. I stated that it was speculation I didnt present as a fact
---
Shouldn’t be an issue unless you start dabbling in methods of circumventing those protections, but that topic is pretty advanced.
---
I prefer the armored mounts
---
I never said I wanted it to be easier, show me where I said that? I have played real vanilla AV (1.12 version and 1.8)
---
Don't really want to keep fueling this pointless arguing with you but basically you want changes catered to you and Im sorry that wont happen
---
Does PS4 pro not hold 60? 
---
Same!  I am so sad about this.  Wish I could see old journeys I had. 
---
Ye and Thousand needles :)
---
Absolutely, druids in general were more chill on both sides.  Of course in the beginning we all seemed to be more concerned with the backstory and lore.  Then druids became pvp all stars when wsg came out and tons of pvp tryhards leveled druid alts and of course that seemed to be the end of the chill druid era.
---
I’ll bet 4K is beautiful
---
Not everything is achievable.  You cant get get scarab lord on your on time frame.  You cant get rank 12+ if you have a job.  You cant get this mount if you dont level up quickly
---
Well the mounts got updated in patch 1.4 which was 6 months after launch so if you played back then you would have gotten it. I'm all for sticking with the original timeline.
---
Aye, I feel you man!  
---
All my characters have always been named "normally".  
---
Until Legion hit, and I lost all my hopes, so I went with pun names.  
---
My NB is "Nightgown", my HMT "Moodoo" (shaman), my VE "Devoida"...  
---
At least only three of them, I resisted with the others.
---
Man, I want version 1.3.2 of mages. Just because thats what I remember. Who cares about 1.12 kappa, shit retail version.
---
Everyone after AV post....
---
&gt; That means, it's running on a client with 12 years of optimizations over the 1.12.1 client.

It's not necessarily optimisation towards better PC performance though. Over the years computers has gotten a lot better, so Blizzard has changed some systems around to work better for the user, but requiring more computing power. Most of that is in terms of internet bandwidth, but I'm pretty sure some of that is also in terms of the performance of user PCs. 
---
A simple example of that would be the spell batching a lot of classic PvPers have been arguing about on here. It was originally designed the way it was to decrease (I think) bandwidth usage. But in later WoW expansions they changed it to be more accurate for the user in exchange for using a bit more resources. 
---
It's also part of the reason people in modern WoW with modern PCs still have just as massive lag when a lot of people are gathered in the same place as they did back in the day with much worse PCs. 
---
I did some tests on my shitty computer.
---
while vanilla wow works fine on around 50fps, modern wow on free test account scores below 20 on the lowest settings.
---
sad shit
---
Just ordered a sound card. Going to be hunting for a subwoofer so I can really feel my spells/attacks.
---
Upgraded gfx card and picked up a nice monitor.
---
Picked up a Samsung EVO 960 M.2 SSD which has a read speed of basically the entire original game per second.
---
All that's left is to load up on scented candles for each zone and setup key-bindings and macro keys
---
The only problem now is that the overall Vanilla core got 15 years older. We have kids and stuff to take care of, so we can't have day long matches..
---
That's all! If I had the time, I would defenetly enjoy it. 
---
I have to pick my vacation days in November. I chose the last 2 weeks of August I hope we are correct!
---
There is a huge difference between vanilla launch and classic launch. 
---
There will be a ton of players who are already paying for a wow subscription and decide to just check out what all the classic fuss is about. All they have to do is click download and wait 30 minutes. Thousands or even hundreds of thousands of people that will create characters and run around just because it is free and they want to check it out. A great many of those people won't play past a few days or a week before they go back to retail.
---
That is a big difference from vanilla wow launch where anyone who wanted to play had to drive down to gamestop and buy a physical copy, or wait for your preorder to get shipped to you.
---
The need for sharding in the 1-10 zones is mostly due to this kind of temporary tourism. Sharding won't be needed for tourism beyond 1-10 because most tourists won't make it past 10.
---
Bruh, they've stated time and time again that they're sticking to 1.12.1 because that's something they can recreate exactly how it was. 
---
They have all the reference data for what 1.12.1 was and are able to put out that product without guess work like every private server. 
---
I can 100% guarantee you that if they decided to make any other patches AV that people would bitch and complain that its not accurate. That's either from their nostalgia or because they haven't actually played pre 1.12.1 AV (I think this is the majority of people).
---
You're essentially asking them to make changes to the patch because you don't want 1.12.1, in a sub that was so vehemently #nochanges there's a portion mad that blizzard is obviously sticking to 1.12.1. 
---
Why not yell at them to do progressive itemization then or class balancing then? That's arguably a significantly more memorable time and worth more to "preserve" in wow than 1.5 AV.
---
Priest gets Benediction/Anathema, too, which is imo the coolest staff in game.
---
Same happens to me. But what I want to know is whether that very same thing will happen with Classic.
---
I think the turn ins from player items is still in 1.12 but the random greys are what they said were removed
---
Wow. That's fantastic. Something enchanting about the music, animals, environment of the zone etc. My second favorite is probably Ashenvale, so I'm hoping to get the best of both worlds. 
---
The turn ins from player items is still in 1.12 but the random greys are what they said were removed, source is they said wing commanders are still in the game.
---
You're missing the point.
---
Very few people leveled fast enough to have 1,000g by the time the original mounts were removed.
---
That made them a very exclusive/rare item.
---
Is the rex 2060 compatible with gsync?
---
That was ever in question.  Even the very first blizz announcement said progressive release. 
---
My question is why would blizzard release content that wasn’t in 1.12 state? Starting with 16 debuffs, 1.12 talents, whatever else that happens in 1.12.  
---
But pre-1.12 AV makes sense? It doesn’t follow from anything blizzard has said so far.
---
Part of my hypothesis is based on testing I did with the demo. I found the demo client ran much better than the original Vanilla client did on my admittedly very modern PC. I've recently expanded my PC hardware collection to run a ton of tests once a Classic beta releases, but until then, I'm just basing it on what information I can dig up and on my personal tests. So, I'm not saying you're wrong, but that I am still confident in my assessment despite your very reasonable counter-argument.
---
All RTX GPUs are Gsync compatible.
---
That's great to here! I always felt like I was being crazy outpaced in retail, and that I was just wasting my time doing anything that wasn't level cap. I'm really looking forward to every level being important. Thanks for the advice on the races and classes as well. I'm going to think long and hard about what just seems like the most interesting to me.  
---
#nochanges is a farse, there is inevitably going to be changes. Following things that already existed in Vanilla WoW is far different from asking for things that did not exist at all. I understand where you're coming from, but there's also a likely business case for Blizzard in how much time and money they want to invest into the project. They're a big company and smart, they'd be able to bring back older iterations of AV. Keeping it as it was in 1.12 is far easier and less time consuming, with added benefit of appeasing those who want quick matches for rep and badges.
---
Progressive itemization? Sure that would be cool, classes would be harder to get behind. Though from my perspective that's a much more difficult case to make and win than changing AV.
---
WoW also didn’t start as a Java based browser game....
---
This explains the "shot of malort." God that shit is gross lol
---
Yeah, he could google it, or he could ask Reddit. There’s lots of resources and why do you get to call someone else a child or stupid because they don’t pick the same resource you would?
---
And again, just because someone doesn’t know as much as you about a video game doesn’t make them a child, or stupid.
---
It’s pretty simple stuff.
---
Addons are less the issue.  The big one is the ui changes allowing conditionals in macros and things like castsequence and mouseover.  There’s a balancing act going on about what api should be restricted because it wasn’t open in Vanilla, and what should be unprotected because they weren’t protected in Vanilla. 
---
With either a hunter or a mage, you're going to tick both of your boxes there honestly. Both are competitive in PvP, and both are needed in raiding. 
---
You're correct that there will be a slightly smaller need for hunters in later content especially, but that doesn't mean they won't be needed at all. You'll still be able to find a raid guild and if you find one early on that you stick with through classic, problem solved anyway... 
---
Hunters (to my knowledge) don't scale quite as well with gear in the later patches as some other classes do. I can't speak to mage scaling with gear as I've never looked anything up and it would just be guessing on my part. Either way, both have a spot in raiding throughout vanilla, maybe mages a little more so than hunters. As for the meters, you'll find yourself under mages from AQ40 onward, especially in Naxx. But that isn't to say your DPS won't be competitive, just that you probably won't be beating the mages at that point. 
---
My advice is to just choose whichever one of those classes looks the most fun to you. Generic advice I know, but on all of the points you bring up, these classes are actually very close to one another. The biggest thing this will come down to is preference. 
---
Modifiers like Ctrl, Shift and Alt used not to be displayed in the actionbars. So if you bound them to Shift+1, Shift+Ctrl+1, Ctr+1, Alt+1 etc. it would just display "1".
---
&gt;people still rushed the bosses anyway
---
Anyone who doesnt think this is going to happen is fucking braindead. Any AV where the bosses dont get rushed just ends up losing all the players that know how to win AV. Every decent player who ends up in the neverending instance just bites the bullet and takes a deserter debuff.
---
Got bitched at for calling this out yesterday. idk if the hype for classic dragged in a bunch of rose-tinted-glasses idiots that havn't played pservers or if most of the people here really are so oblivious to the culture of efficiency that theorycrafting a game for a decade has spawned.
---
You may be correct, but when there's a Zerg, you don't have the time to collect enough to turn in before it ends.
---
So you’re saying something that is not a choice is actually a choice, and it’s a choice that doesn’t matter 
---
I’d like to play Druid balance but scared that it would irritate me cause of mana/having to shift form constantly.
---
I never liked bear/cat and would be happier with a rogue instead, I think.
---
Though I could always reroll at 60 and keep it for the professions.
---
I like healing too, but I think I’d rather do it with a priest.
---
How do you find priest for pvp? (All specs)
---
you are ok with the 1.12 version because it's the fastest way to get 'your gear and rep' = easier in my book
---
&gt; you want changes catered to you and Im sorry that wont happen
---
no, I played vanilla AV as well, and I remember what changes were good and bad. just like cross realm, it was vanilla, I did not enjoy that change - although you probably think you can grind honor faster with it so you like that change. 
---
I want the best version of vanilla, 1.12 was a good patch overall, but not all of the changes were good, and blizz has even admitted blanket releasing everything that was 1.12 is bad - so they are gating content(like they should) - that is not pure 1.12 either - but you're ok with that? 
---
I like AV, imo we have ONE shot to get it right, I would rather it be the version that is more fun and memorable. you don't care about AV, that's fine, but why are you going out of your way to prevent people from playing the AV version they enjoy? that's like someone who plays retail arguing why blizzard should not release classic servers - I wish you could see that. 
---
let me and all the other people who actually like AV play the version of AV we want
---
I think the modern client has some very limited multi-core support. Which could help a lot with modern PCs. But I think the main issue for lag is in extreme situations like 40-man raids and everyone using their spells and shit. And I think the way the modern client handles that is actually less performance-optimised than it was in classic. But again, just speculating, you have at least tested something, so can't really disprove what you are saying. 
---
It’s just a word... you’re hearing over the Internet. does it really matter? 
---
Using consecration in Prot spec?
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjDILhDYNU0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjDILhDYNU0) With less asmonshitter.
---
A downside to being killed? How dreadful! :rolleyes:
---
Did they actually mention summer release somewhere?
---
Gaaaaaawd I'm so excited.
---
You can single handedly stop zergs. Recap stonehearth, focus out healers, cap frost wolf before stonehearth is secured. All of these will force turtles instantly
---
I don't want them, they look fuckly.
---
I get the real epic mount in 1 month and clear MC :P
---
My point was about other people who don't have the time. READING COMPREHENSION.
---
I gave my reasoning in the very post you responded to.
---
So DME as a Prot pally using consecration?
---
I see ze?t i upvote
---
The idiot masses zerg in the middle, a few people grab a black lotus and dip, and hopefully a group of non-idiots on either side is able  to bypass the nonsense and successfully end the AV in a timely manner. If neither premade/organized rush succeeds then the game stagnates and sits around for days.
---
I'm probably going to roll gnome because while Human is min max for PVE imo pvp min maxing and having escape artist is way better than some wep skill, I plan on tanking in raids and pvping but pvp racials make a huge difference. 
---
Can't wait to get that crossbow, second best weapon in the game for hunters after Ashjre'thul.
---
The Division 2 is awesome. I’m having a lot of fun with it right now.
---
Someone wanna give this poor guy a link?
---
Based on what you've said, I'd recommend the rogue. 
---
Shaman will often (not always) be relegated to healing. You can take the path of greater resistance and play the game as enhance, but a lot of raid guilds will be looking specifically resto shaman. I'm sure if you look harder you can find a spot as enhance, but it's not guaranteed. 
---
Warlock is a very fun class and I think you'd enjoy the niche that you fill. Downside is the time requirement. When it comes to raid prep and farming soul shards, you'll have a lot more work to do than other classes to prep for your raids. Based on your limited time, this may not be the way you want to use it... If thats not a problem for you though, warlock could be fun!
---
And rogue... Admittedly it has the smallest unique niche among those 3 classes you mentioned. They have unique things they can do, lockpicking, pickpocket, stealth, etc... They just feel a little more generic than the other two options imo. However, they're great at soloing content in the open world, they're competitive in PvP, and sought after for raiding. They also don't have a lot of prep work like a warlock does, or at least not as much. 
---
I want my ancient frostaber to return!
---
I’m playing on Xbone and it holds 60fps but living in Australia and playing on console means the playerbase is so minimal - I hit the point were my options to continue ranking up are to buy a PC or move to America and one is more feasible then the other.
---
It was obviously because it was too popular and everyone liked it, so blizzard wanted to spoil the fun. 
---
It's an assumption, because there IS people playing. Maybe less than 5 or 6 years ago, but still. Otherwise WoW won't be listed as one of the most lucrative games in 2019 Q1. It'll be even more lucrative when Classic go live, but it's a fallacy to say that nobody is playing.
---
Maybe I was talking about a different game i'm about to play that far outclasses games that shard??? 
---
This is 1.12. Warlocks are very strong on this patch. People know this and that is why locks will be way more popular than they were in actual vanilla. 
---
A decent number of people had them, and the vast majority of people that did have them exchanged them as soon as the patch came out.
---
They were never designed to be a rare launch collectable, and only really became a thing as time went on by the sheer nature of some people holding on to them out of fondness or ignorance. 
---
It's the same with loads of WoW items. I have several items considered "collectables" in my bank like Dartols Rod. I don't have it because it's a collectable. I have it because it was a fun item to keep hold of and didn't want to turn it in.
---
Having a system where you create artificial collectables based on time-gates is not at all what Vanilla was about. If you like that sort of thing hang around for TBC and get your Hand of Adal/ZA bear mount.. or just play Retail. I'm sure there are plenty of time-gated collectables in the current game.
---
There will def be plenty of people rolling VC, WC, BFD, SFK for gear super early on.
---
Diablo 3 was bad because it was an unfinished game. It was a horrible game through launch up to current. I played hours upon hours it's bad. 
---
And why would you shard an already sharded 4 player game? Thats not sharding thats multiplayer.
---
and mmo has no sharding. It has servers, but no sharding.
---
I'm not doing anything except give my opinion, ultimately blizzard will keep it at 1.12 because they said they would have a good day I cant argue with some1 like U
---
This is the best thing about this screenshot.
---
Hey thats cool, you can have sharding, but I wont be playing it then.
---
Balance druids are really not a thing at end game in Vanilla. A lot of the tier sets only give healing bonus and not spell damage either. Casters are really limited to Warlock/Mage. You might like Resto Druid. It is what I mained in Vanilla. While they don't top meters, they are highly needed because of their raid utility. MOTW is one of the best buffs, HoTs bring a lot of value, and battle rez. Additionally, they are one of the most underplayed classes, so finding a spot should come easily. Also, they don't have to share much loot. Priests are good, but a lil squishy, nice thing about druid too in PVP is their mobility.
---
Define "Hardcore".
---
Admittedly, I didn't test raids in the Classic Demo for obvious reasons, so there's still a ton of opportunities still for things to fall apart with my ideas. And, you're right, multi-threaded optimizations came around in BFA, but as of what we know currently, the Classic client won't have those optimizations due to being on a Legion build. I am 99% sure they'll move over eventually, but I think the Demo actually didn't include those multi-threaded enhancements.
---
Man I miss the arguments about the stealth nerfs/buffs to deep breathe.
---
Thats great, but at launch and during all of the games release I wont be playing if theres sharding and neither will a lot of the no change community. 
---
Mana potions if things go on too long, good gear with some mp5 here and there, and again hoping your guild is good enough that fights don't drag on longer than they should 
---
D3 had other issues, but unquestionably the launch was chaotic and a failure, and that wasnt because of bad design in the game, it was because millions of people flooded it at the same time (thanks in large part to many WoW subscribers getting it for 'free')
---
Oh yeah its pretty funny.. lots of these sub-reddits are completely emotionally driven and irrational. Just go take a look at BO4 sub - they are usually demanding the season pass should be free.
---
I wouldn't be mad either, because its just a game lmao
---
I don't get as furious on the internet over discussions on reddit as you seem to get.
---
A lot of servers are going to die if they don't implement sharding for the first couple zones / week of Classic.
---
Don't be so short-sighted. 
---
I just wanted to see what the bot would do to it, thanks for sharing tho!
---
It was a horrible release because the game was half finished. 
---
Absolutely, I just don't want people thinking that you need 9+ different consumables and buffs to set foot into a raid. It's not a realistic picture of what raiding in Classic will be like.
---
I'm aware that's not the picture you were trying to paint, but I thought it needed saying if someone was asking about raid costs.
---
Then you're not talking about Classic WoW and I'm removing your post as per Rule #1.
---
Well the quest was level 40-something and once you got 60 gave very little rep (or none at all, can't remember). So you'd likely have to get that runecloth anyway. 
---
I'm the guy auto-running into the gate before the game starts, telling everyone to buff me
---
For addons, we aren't sure yet what will and wont be available.  In TBC they protected a lot of abilities like being able to cast spells from Lua to avoid decision making.  If you look at this link:  [https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/World\_of\_Warcraft\_API](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/World_of_Warcraft_API)   it'll show you which functions are protected / deprecated / etc. 
---
Some functions changed too from their parameters to their use over the years. So we will have to see what is available. Some addons will probably just be a minor update, while others may be overhauls.  It'll be interesting to see if they allow something like WeakAuras to run.  DBM should run, since it was available pretty early in the game's life.  
---
I think we will see a lot MORE addons than are available for pservers now, and probably someone will use the data from something like Questie to make a better or more unique set of addons.  Especially if the Twitch client is able to auto-install addons and manage updates like it does now we will probably see more.  
---
But they don't want addons that can be group finders working.  So an addon that I can start a group and "list" it somewhere and then have someone else search this list and join a group.  Even if they still have to be auto-invited / walk to the dungeon.  Features like that are built into bfa, but the functionality that someone could make that is available as well.  So they may change how some of those functions work, or protect some that aren't going to be protected on live.  We will see though.
---
&gt; neither will a lot of the no change community
---
Ironically maybe we won't need sharding thanks to these folk.
---
Everyone who wants the old awful hour long fights back probably wouldn't actually queue for that more than once a month. People may be remembering it fondly, but its probably just rose tinted glasses or the fact that accomplishing absolutely nothing for hours was just more fun as a kid.
---
Last time I was out at a work thing where the drinks were paid for, I ordered a shot and had all my non-local coworkers sip from it.
---
Wormwood!
---
&gt; Lmao do what you want but they will sell it retail.
---
Im confused by what you mean here.  Are you saying theyre going to sell Classic as a standalone game, and then also require a sub...?
---
I could have sworn they explicitly said it was going to be subscription only at Blizzcon.
---
Check out Outward, it’s a coop rpg that comes out on the 26th.
---
They are also on track to deliver Classic WoW this Summer, and as they have stated, 1.12 is the reference they are using for many of these design decisions which are not clear cut..
---
Sorry then threat isn't coded correctly on that server. Explain to me how a shield that ticks for 30 damage can hold off from mages whose blizzards can tick for 800.
---
I mainly used the no changes thing because its ridiculous to have ever thought that blizzard will be making changes to the patch content itself. They've stated that 1.12.1 will be the base for everything, yet people think they're going to change content because a few want them to. Its the exact same situation as the no changes arguments, you're just justifying it because it previously existed in the game.
---
&gt;Following things that already existed in Vanilla WoW is far different from asking for things that did not exist at all.
---
No its not, its generally the exact same effort because they're recreating everything in the new engine. 
---
&gt;I understand where you're coming from, but there's also a likely business case for Blizzard in how much time and money they want to invest into the project. They're a big company and smart, they'd be able to bring back older iterations of AV. Keeping it as it was in 1.12 is far easier and less time consuming, with added benefit of appeasing those who want quick matches for rep and badges.
---
Yes its a time and accuracy thing. Blizzard CANNOT get any other patch of content exactly like it was without the actual data to reference, and since we have no other information to go off of other than the only version of wow they have is 1.12.1 our only assumption would be if they were to implement previous patch content then they would be guessing while using the same data and methodology private servers were using. 
---
&gt;Progressive itemization? Sure that would be cool, classes would be harder to get behind. Though from my perspective that's a much more difficult case to make and win than changing AV.
---
Of course its more difficult because there's more data but they would be handling it the exact same way as they would handle AV changes.
---
So if you want 1.5 version of AV does it stay 1.5 forever? does it progress? What about the people that remember 1.12 (the second longest AV patch)? Why not 1.8, the patch most people are probably remembering? 
---
Its just plain smarter to tell people you're going to stick with one patch content, especially when you can get it as accurate as possible, because it sets expectations.
---
Have fun with your unauthentic version of the game that gets bastardized over time slowly by casuals like you who sympathize with shitty server load management systems.
---
You think that the community would get enraged if they announced "the old original, pre-nerf, 1.6 version AV"? 
---
More or less noone would object I think.
---
Later yo
---
Ah I see. That’s why I didn’t get it at all. 
---
dafuk, 95% of my content is related to wow classic buffoon.
---
&gt;ultimately blizzard will keep it at 1.12 because they said they would 
---
they also said 
---
&gt;you think you do, but you don't
---
it would take very little effort to modify the 1.12 av version to previous versions, add npc's back, increase hp/damage, revert a few quests and boom, everyone's happy
---
&gt; I cant argue with some1 like U
---
if me saying that people should have a chance to plea their case for what version of AV is outrageous to you, then yeah, I'm done with you too
---
That may be all you do between raids, but your average player isn't going to spend 200g per night on raids.
---
Thank god OP isn't on the dev team. What a disaster Classic would be.
---
Did northdale die? Lol. You're the shortsighted apologist here.
---
And yet here you are, the white knight to defend retards that can’t read. Thank god you’re here 
---
Heart of the Wild/Nature’s Swiftness is what I use for everything except raiding, that I go deep resto for.
---
Fuckin got me.
---
It will run better than vanilla wow would. Multicore utilization will be key here. 
---
did northcale die? no. 
---
&gt;What we would actually need to make it fun are custom changes (omg triggered) with the goal of producing the old meta.
---
Everyone wants the experience/old metas back but people don't realize that identical code just isnt going to give that to you.
---
&gt;"i dont have time for this, let's make it quick"
---
Man, I am not 15 anymore, I have shit I need to do. As much as I would like to no life WoW I just can't anymore. AV lasting 2-3 days might be something you can do, but I would literally never finish one, I just can't sit on WoW like that anymore. I am sure they are doing it mostly because they told us 1.12, and that is what you are getting. But also because they realize that a lot of people played this when they were growing up in high school and college, now they are in their 30's or near their 30's and want to relive parts of it with at least a little consideration to the fact that 15 years have passed. 
---
I am also going Mage this time around.
---
You no changers get so mad at the smallest things.
---
Honestly though, my opinion on their use of sharding is "uhh we couldn't come up with a better idea for server load so here's a bunch of ghosts"
---
Man keep that salt coming :P
---
I'm sure its doing wonders for your blood pressure.
---
I want prenerf wep balance, so you could take a 2.0 dagger and just oneshot everything. Tbh Id like to see fury warriors have bloodthirst where you have to kill someone to get it to procc. THAT IS the version I remember and I DESERVE. Btw, I also remember HUGE lagspikes and server crashes, good flavour and immersion, I want that. 
---
obv doing shit like that isnt feasible, and NO there is NOT a conensus on how AV was like in vanilla.
---
So probably that's not all he said. He probably talked a lot about AV as well.
---
It's HUGE. it's literally community at stake.
---
&gt; don't really want to heal on the shaman ... I plan to run raids
---
I'd say that knocks out Shaman, I think enh raiding will be an uphill battle, it is of course doable but I think you'd have to put more time in to it than it sounds like you want to.
---
&gt; I will have limited time
---
Lock way better than Rogue for leveling. Endgame, I'm sure someone will bring up soulshard farming, but IMO it's going to be a drop in the bucket compared to the overall time sink that raiding will be.
---
&gt; I tend to be more of a loaner in my adult life
---
Locks are excellent solo classes, you have great sustain and survivability, and when you do fuck up, you have soulstone.
---
&gt; I really want to have a decent open world experience and also have a niche role I can play in the game.
---
IMO every class fits this and that's one of the things that makes Vanilla so great. You can't really go wrong here.
---
I can't recommend Lock enough, it is an absolute blast to play, and excellent for solo. I am tempted to main one myself, and if I don't, my alt will 100% be one.
---
Blizzard realized people with a brain are just going to rush for the objective if they can. They cant help that. Dumb little things like wintergrasp showed up for the babbies that need their large scale no skill zergfests.
---
&gt; Scarab Lord Title wasn’t in vanilla.
---
If you get to the point that you realize you just said something dumb and want to delete your post, I'll go ahead and delete this as well
---
I’m impressed you have more then 10 keybinds. I used to shift +upkey for my healing spells too :)
---
Why? You're missing out on auction house tracking addons, UI upgrades, and extremely helpful gameplay addons like swing timers/autoshot timers/debuff timers; as well as DPS meters to optimize your grinding speed, threat meters if you have pets, and vendor price addons.
---
It's not like they make the game easier, or even feel aesthetically different, they just help you slightly optimize your playstyle.
---
\#nochanges is anything added that never happened in Vanilla.  The issue with AV has nothing to do with #nochanges. 
---
While technically correct in saying 1.12 is one of the longest singular AV patches. The experience from 1.5 - 1.8 was largely the same and to a lesser extent through 1.11. The point being looking at patches as singular points is not how Vanilla was experienced.
---
I had mentioned a progressive change to AV as it realistically occurred as a form of middle ground where I feel like more people who agree with than singular points.
---
If I'm being realistic, there's going to be more static elements like 1.12 AV that will make many unhappy. People can make claims about data and whatnot all they want, but it's all about cost. If people can show a reasonable business case their may be leeway. Without any discussion Blizzard without a doubt will take the easiest, cheapest, method of adhering to Classic and 1.12 values.
---
&gt; Dungeons used to be 15 man and even then rarely cleared.
---
You must have been on a terrible server or a terrible player. Dungeons were not "rarely cleared" with 15 people, especially when only UBRS was balanced around 15 players.
---
&gt; For healers and others, pvp gear wasn't easy to get prepatch.
---
Except it was, honor didn't work off killing blows. Stop posting off your misconceptions. The prepatch wasn't even Vanilla anyways.
---
&gt; More guilds cleared MC after the release of DM and it's gear and buffs, sweet lips.
---
The first MC clear happened a month and a half *after* DM released. If you're going to act like an ass, at least make sure you're not spewing complete nonsense.
---
You the man Josh, I loved hearing you chat with Kevin about Warrior and can't wait to listen to this one and more.
---
\*Laughs in Vanilla\* 
---
Personally I wouldn’t mind have unarmored and armored mounts available for purchase. It would add more diversity amongst characters, but doesn’t affect gameplay much at all.
---
It's literally just the launch to deal with the fact that classic wow is super hyped. There's no good ways to deal with a launch like this, compromise has to be made.
---
Well now you're just being ridiculous. There's plenty of downside to being killed in 1.12 AV. If you're pushing SP GY and your rez point is Stonehearth, that's a good 2-3 minutes that you're out of the action every time you die. 
---
Pre-1.8 AV is "literally one death and you are no longer useful for the next 15 minutes, after enough people on your team die so you can form a group to push through the NPCs again." That SUCKS.
---
How long will we have to suffer with 1.12 AV? One month?! Two months? Three months? Four months? Five months? Six months? Maybe even SEVEN months?! Eight months?
---
&gt; My point was about other people who don't have the time. READING COMPREHENSION.
---
And you've completely missed the point of Classic and MMORPGs in general. Too bad if you can't put in the time to earn rewards. You aren't getting them.
---
You had kick binded?
---
You're a god.
---
"Force" is a very optimistic approach. I would say slightly delay would be more accurate.
---
This isn't entirely accurate FourEcho. Shamans get a metric shit ton of nature resistance lowering on their BIS gear for the expac. Their problem isn't they can't put out damage. They can put out a shit ton of it. They have 2 problems that make them unplayable. The first is that they get 0 gear support until AQ40. The second is that they go oom hella fast. I could be a little off but I think even in your best gear you go oom in like 17 lightning bolts. Making you go oom about every 40 seconds.
---
The kind of funny thing about ele shaman and shadow priest is that they are both bad dps because they go oom so fast. However once you have the entire expac on farm. They are actually both very good dps because bosses die in 30 seconds anyway lol. Point is if you wanna raid dps don't play shaman lol.
---
I realized I liked cat form so much that I rolled a rogue and never looked back
---
Joe the warrior, epic
---
Thanks for all that and the explanations. Really I'm just trying to learn a bit so I can update/remake some basic addons for classic such as druidbar or various UI options.
---
One thing I'm trying to find out if you don't mind helping:
---
What's the point of the .XML?  I've written a Level-Up addon which gratzes a user and tells them the gained health/mana. I've just done it all as a lua file and forgone the XML entirely and it works fine.
---
So what does the XML do and why do I need it?

## &gt; Patch changes
---
* [Patch 2.0.3](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_2.0.3) (2007-01-09) added.
---
They are going to fall back on sharding every time theres slight server population load its going to suck. and it sets a bad precedent. 
---
You're either going to have to work your ass off to stay ahead of the population wave and be in the top 10% of higher levels, be stuck in the same pool as 80% of the population fighting over mob spawns and resources doing the same quests and taking forever to accomplish anything, or wait a week or so until the giant wave has moved away from the starting areas and be in the lower 10%.
---
I really want to play, but with real life and work I doubt i'll be able to stay ahead of the population mob...  I might end up just waiting a couple weeks myself.
---
Lmao you don't even need gsync with any of those cards running classic wow. You'll be maxed out at 144hz the entire time anyway, adaptive frame rate is pointless.
---
It's a 15 year old game with 15 year old graphics, a toaster should be able to run it even two secondary monitors.
---
Changing 15 minute into 1-2 hours I'd consider more than a slight delay
---
Classic no changes crowd. They want no changes unless it's something they don't like. We are playing on 1.12. But you want a different version of AV? Okay...
---
Weapon skill does nothing in pvp
---
oi
---
Those underwater quests with the elite murlocs in northern STV. So glad I'm playing shaman this time around for water breathing.
---
Not dealing with the launch problems, and repeating the horrible mistake that was the unplayable vanilla launch would set a bad precedent for me.
---
That's also a completely baseless amount of time. Context of where the battles in AV are, what GYs are taken and how much people are dying factor in.
---
I appreciate your level of optimism, I would love for it to be that easy to extend the game. But the reality is that we'd more likely see a 20ish minute game instead of about 15.
---
So everyone has mentioned that there's not enough quests to hit Exalted and the turn ins for cloth might not be around, but one thing nobody has mentioned is the faction wide rep for quests that got added in the later patches (1.10 I think), where you'd get 100% rep for the quest for the city it's for, and 25% rep for the others. So a quest that gave 400 UC rep now also gives 100 TB rep, 100 Org rep, and 100 Troll rep. If that bonus rep is in the game, you can hit exalted regardless of cloth turn ins being around.
---
You don't know that. Nobody here knows that. Nobody even knows if it's going to be in at launch. Chill. 
---
Same. AV is just a zergfest, I'm there for the rep and then in out. Grinded so many chars to exalted over various patches, don't really like any version of the place.
---
If Blizzard is this close to release, they’ve already developed a solution.
---
Marketing polls are reasonably accurate, especially when it comes to nostalgia projects (releases, reboots, updates).  They’ve got an estimate to the thousands of how many will play at launch, 3 months out and 1 year out.
---
It won’t be a huge challenge unless the number of returning, sticking players is significantly over estimate.
---
This was most definitely a top priority in the planning stages of this revamp.
---
I’ve only played destiny 2 with it. It’s pretty but intense on my machine. I7 6700k with 16gb ram and gtx1080 I average from 45-60fps mostly hovers in the 50s. I was joking with my cousin that those classic graphics are going to be silly at this resolution. I just don’t think that the old 2005 graphics are gonna look great that big lol. 
---
What would you like them to do about the gigantic wave of people playing in the first weeks to month? And how would your solution hold up after the first 1-2 months when most of those people have left?
---
Keep up the good work, brother!
---
I can tell you from experience, that, according to Blizzard, this is impossible. 
---
How about a bluetooth mouse and keyboard? I know Logitech makes some nice stuff, maybe that’s a solution?
---
Oh I plan on maining warlock so I can actually be useful. But for an alt I want to do something for shits and giggles.
---
I agree with you, but seriously man there are 5 of these posts every single day.  
---
You were actually correct there my bad! Just a sub.
---
Dont shorten it, stick to the road then. You should be able to outrun everything coming after you, the starting zones are pretty easy and most mobs are yellow, as in they wont attack you untill you do.
---
Absolutely that is also true. There will be a new community emerging. I have a feeling blizzard will fail on their ability to connect to them.
---
I'm doing the same thing. Very little new projects moving through the line... Solar Sales are so finicky.
---
&gt;Leave empty beer bottles on your desk for Ironforge and the Grim Guzzler
---
Implying it isnt already that way....
---
Buy them all in the AH on your ALT and send mail them to your main right before heading out to the camp for the first time.  That way you don't have to worry about collecting them all for the remainder of your time in STV.
---
Yeah, I said human is for PVE, I meant I would rather have PVP racials that don't do much in PVE rather than the opposite. 
---
So many people underestimate the Vanilla grind. Some people will remember the 2.4.3 leveling nerf (33% IIRC) but not the actual grind.
---
That‘s just a weak opinion based argument. Nobody likes to have an opinion forced on, one so stupid even more, and yet even more because it doesn‘t affect those people **at all**. 
---
It‘s the same as if I was wearing sunglasses with a blue shade and people would force me to stop wearing them because they don‘t like that their skin looks blue to me. What the fuck man. 
---
My man!
---
#NOCHANGES
---
Oh, wait, them running the same version AV as the rest of the game isn't a change... 
---
I always thought the remaster would release before classic wow.,, I think they know people will be busy with classic and not purchase the remaster if it were to release that way
---
If you think taking stonehearth is only a 5 minute delay you are either completely inexperienced or an idiot. Regardless im done arguing
---
Do both? 1.12 AV most of the time, and have month long events with 'long' AV every 3 months or so.
---
I want to have none of that and experience what the game is like with zero add ons. I’m not saying no one has to do exactly what I do. But until I get to a point where I literally need them I’d like to see the game in the eyes of people who had no option to use them. 
---
Mini bosses, turbo archers that basically 1 shot, etc.
---
Some of the class quests were notoriously horrible. The Alliance version of the Aquatic Form quest chain had one quest where you needed two halves of a pendant. You started in Moonglade.
---
The first lockbox was underwater in Darkshore, and the other was in the fatigue waters off of *Westfall*. You would do this quest in the later teens, if doing it at level. That's a long run.
---
I have the time. Learn to read, pls.
---
XML is just another way of defining UI elements. Particularly useful for when you have elements that can be statically defined. That is, if you have something like a button that's going to be created the exact same no matter what you can define it in XML instead of Lua. It's not required though so if you want to keep using just Lua that's fine.
---
For example, ElvUI is a large UI replacement addon and it only uses XML for UI 4 times (it uses more just for loading lua files so they just have to put the one XML in the TOC file).
---
Better to keep the door shut than to leave it open a crack and hope Blizz doesn't open it more. We also can't wait until launch to find out, as by then it's way too late to try and affect a change.
---
The only time i can see it even close to making a difference is for RP, and any kind of organized RP can very, very easily say 'Classic graphics only' if they *really* want to be that strict.  Theres just no sense in limiting the vast majority of players due to that.
---
Yea, it would be cool if they did /something/ to make them limited. 
---
There hasn't been any information on Reforged since Blizzcon which heavily implies that we won't see it before Classic. Since it has to be out by November 2nd, late summer/early fall is the most realistic time range.
---
I know it would make a lot of sense to release WC3:R before Classic to get people hyped up for Classic through the story. But there is no information so far to suggest that.
---
Oh yeah. Remember those few videos of people making afk machines with rotating fans so that they could stay in the AV all weekend while they were out of town? (And it still not be over) people bond over mutual struggles 
---
Mage Warrior or Warlock  - I want to PvP pretty hardcore and will definitely raid, I like being useful to groups (usually tank or healer) but I also want to effectively farm gold.
---
I’m leaning more towards the Mage but i’m going to be torn and probably leveling all 3 in cycles. Which would have the best time getting to Rank 14?
---
Thanks for the explanation. Greatly appreciate it!
---
Or they just use reason and chose something in the middle. Don't worry, if you don't join a hardcore guild you wont have 30 minute MC's and from my experience, no matter the version of alterac valley, there is both 15 minute AV's and 8 hour AV's
---
On the pull false I have had plenty of healers pre heal the tank and that is entirely on them. Trust me I am a very seasoned veteran of vanilla tanking.
---
same though! the overall pace of the game being slower also adds something to that, i think. like if it's gonna take you a long time to hit level cap anyways does it really matter if you spend like an hour fishing one day? i definitely feel much less rushed and stressed out
---
This is why I'm hoping for a small number of servers, and "robust" hardware to support high populations (without sharding).  
---
I do it for the good of all mankind!
---
I didn't realize having a disagreement makes someone an idiot. What part of there being variances in an AV match is inaccurate. Stonehearth is retaken, great, but what if snowfall is also taken. What if stormpike is taken already. What if the whole group is already at the boss and not dying? What if the Horde still has iceblood but Alliance has Frostwolf and doesn't need to double back and recap.
---
There are so many possible factors, but you're right, I'm the inexperienced idiot here. Making wishful claims does not make you correct.
---
Call of Water. Ugh
---
&gt;Bfa rogue is waaaaaaay better than vanilla rogue
---
Can you elaborate on this?
---
&gt;Rogues are EXTREMELY CD dependent, and those CDs are 10mins.
---
What rogue CDs are 10 mins? Aren't they pretty much all &lt;=5 mins other than Preparation? Plus you can shave 1.5 mins off Blind, Vanish, Sprint, and Evasion with talents.
---
Escort quests in general all sucked pretty hard. There were also so many low drop quests, like 1% chances you could spend hours on. But I didn't avoid any of them, completed every quest available to my class, race, and professions in vanilla. None of them are really that bad, just a grind.
---
if it means anything i started playing in legion.
---
There are no "rules" regarding addons, the only limits are built-in API limitations. 
---
Pretty sure they will be cutting the link between decision making and the action itself in Classic.
---
For example, originally in vanilla there were addons that automatically selected a target and casted dispel in a single click. 
---
They are going to limit that to just suggestion of the despellable target, and the dispel has to be done manually by the player. 
---
This is such an ignorant response. The time limited models fit perfectly with the design themes of Classic, AND it would make Classic a more authentic recreation.
---
Something tells me you're just butthurt because you never had one and you know you'll get left out again if they add them to Classic.
---
Both are great and only get better as new content comes out. I personally have always liked mages. AOE grinding is insane for leveling and can net you a lot of cash. 
---
The amount of people that think hardcore guilds are going to nix their skilled players for rolling UD rogue instead of Orc is actually hilarious and sad.
---
There should be about 0 interference *aside* from maybe humans / dwarf master race for alliance. Can't believe someone said premades are going to filter non-elitist races lol.... get out of here. If you have the gear and the skill, literally you're fine. 
---
People honestly forget that priests can dispel fear? What? Fear ward is a crutch, not a mandate. 
---
The notorious error 37 that caused people to be kicked from the game was entirely due to server problems. Nothing to do with the game itself. Way too many people tried to log in all at once. 
---
same omg i love ashenvale so much! there's plenty of quests to do + a dungeon and the atmosphere is second to none tbh, you'll love it
---
&gt;The experience from 1.5 - 1.8 was largely the same and to a lesser extent through 1.11. The point being looking at patches as singular points is not how Vanilla was experienced.
---
I agree but that's my point, we HAVE to look at it as a singular patch because we have no other information to go off of. Blizzard has made no indication that they're going to be making changes over time (minus the progression of content) so our only assumption can be that they're not going to. 
---
&gt;If I'm being realistic, there's going to be more static elements like 1.12 AV that will make many unhappy. 
---
No matter what patch you choose many will be unhappy, you're never going to win. 
---
&gt;People can make claims about data and whatnot all they want, but it's all about cost. If people can show a reasonable business case their may be leeway. Without any discussion Blizzard without a doubt will take the easiest, cheapest, method of adhering to Classic and 1.12 values.
---
No, discussion will not make blizzard change anything in this context. We're lucky that the board is even letting a project like this happen in the first place, they're not going to make changes to the game based off vague data and memories. That's a project setup for failure.
---
The perfect example of this is the warlock pet. People had no idea that that the pets acted differently than private servers and their memory, because the majority of players didn't play vanilla or if they did it was nearing TBC.
---
They're adhering to 1.12.1 because its the easiest path to getting the most accurate product for the least amount of money. Anything else will be expensive and not worth their time ATM. I get the feeling that the board is using this to gauge interest in its older games. I could see them trying it if classic is a smash success but to think otherwise is wishful thinking. 
---
Hi, the show is released on YouTube as well, just usually a few days later. Search for countdown to classic and you’ll find it :)
---
:( 
---
Damn thats alot od hunters, bet it was a quick phase 2!
---
It will be up on YouTube in a few days, I release there too, just on a bit of a delay :)
---
Calling common dialogue between gamers and people just fucking around cringey or contrived is pretty cringey. If I could give you a "peace" of advice, it would be to stop being so sensitive. 
---
&gt; The old AV, weird and janky though it may have been, at least had some people that loved it.
---
That was also BEFORE crossrealm BGs when WoW was a totally different game.
---
Before crossrealm, you could actually form bonds with strangers and make enemies of the Horde. Names were recognizable. Fighting in AV often meant fighting against your mortal enemies.
---
Then crossrealm happened and everyone became transient and faceless.
---
Why not just move to cancel your cast? Like just take a step to the side or whatever?
---
A lot of it is custom UI stuff, but it does have some other things like for including other files / scripts. 
---
Mind sharing those druid list? Lol
---
There's no quests I really avoid, but there's still many I absolutely hate. The ones that comes to mind instantly are:
---
1. A quest in Felwood where you have to bring lootable quest items to Undercity. The thing with this quest is that if you don't pre-plan, you will end up returning to Felwood just to farm more of the quest items. I got to this quest once when I was on a powerleveling "schedule" and hadn't slept for 25 hours or something.. and I had to return to Felwood not once but twice which took a long time.
---
2. A quest in Shimmering Flats which I can't remember the name of, but I think people know which one I'm talking about.  I think it was either Basilisks or scorpions that you had to kill and loot items of. If you're unlucky, this will easily take you 1-3 hours.. if you have just one more player doing the same quest it becomes even worse. I was unlucky when I did this quest and it took me almost 2 hours, while it took my friend just 20-30 minutes and we killed the same amount of mobs during the first 30 minutes.
---
3. Aged gorilla Sinew.. I didn't have a problem with this quest on pservers. But I remember this quest well from the vanilla days, horrible one.
---
“i hope you guys pwn em”
---
yep, that’s 2005.
---
Would something like [this](https://au.pcpartpicker.com/guide/csQzK8/modest-amd-gaming-build) be a setup you would be interested in? 
---
I hate battlegrounds, but this is really sad to hear.  If 1.12.1 is too similar to retail AV it will be just as boring, and I guess Ice-barbed spear + [other rewards](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?quest=8271) will be freely obtainable now which can hurt progression.
---
Don’t really care. Just want a release date. 
---
The problem is, Greens actually roll for their stats in vanilla. For instance a level 56-58 Helmet of Shadow Wrath can roll anywhere between like 33 and 42 bonus shadow spell power.
---
Basically the item name wont matter, Any high level cloth helm can roll *of shadow wrath* its just the overall stat you'd want to pay attention to.
---
consecrate is mandatory
---
then the lower your gear/level ( some people apparently go there at like 55 or whatever to also level)  is the bigger the need for prot talents. One of those blacksmith spikes on the shield helps a little bit too.
---
if you get like full blue gear or even epics then its doable with a normal holy build. Try to wear heavier armor with intellect ( gotta spam lots of consecrate) and some stamina ( you can heal but you get lots of delays cuz of all the hits)
---
You played RS in 2004 didn't you 
---
Aren't they using earlier itemization as well?
---
If the “no change” community continues to act like this, I’ll be glad if y’all don’t play. At the release of WoW their wasn’t the population and fan base it has now. You will never emulate vanilla WoW to the T. It’s not the same, it never will be. Stop trying to make it. It won’t. Millions of people are going to flock to this release. It’s going to be a crappy shit show without sharding. I don’t feel like standing beside 500 other players trying to get a damn pick from a cave.

I can't disagree with most of the points you're making, but I would like to point out progressive patches. This was changed due to community discussion. They went from 4 to 6 phases. Granted in comparison to AV that's a much easier change, but if people stayed quiet there's no guarantee we would have gotten that much.
---
I don't expect Blizzard to change AV from 1.12 and I understand their reasoning. But I at least want to make some discourse around it, getting people talking is better than staying silent, even if any hope is bleak.
---
Regarding the Warlocks pet thing, I never played enough of private servers to know how it worked there. But my memory from Vanilla on playing an alt Warlock was exactly as they stated, instant despawn. Not trying to flex or anything, but just wanted to say there are those who do remember things accurately. Maybe not everything, but definitely some.
---
It isn't the private server community complaining about 1.12 AV for the most part.
---
What about your actual job ?
---
Hi CygnusXYZ, thanks so much for listening and I’m glad to hear you’ve caught them all, you’ve unlocked the Countdown achievement! 
---
With regards to the swearing, you definitely have a point in that it’s happening more often in the show of late. This is due to me trying to loosen up a bit and actually sound more like myself rather than an uptight podcast host version of myself - which I was doing for the first 70 or so episodes.
---
So what you’re saying very much so makes sense, in that for a long time I didn’t swear and now it seems shoe horned in and not like me at all! However, I can assure you that this more casual/cruder version is much more like the IRL Josh, and I find it more relaxing to be able to speak freely rather than worry about watching my mouth. I do worry it may bother some people, and I apologise if it does offend slightly, but I do plan on keeping it up, without forcing it and swearing just for the sake of swearing.
---
Hope to have you keep going with the show regardless, thanks so much for the great feedback anyway, don’t worry about the downvoted, was important for me to hear regardless! Cheers.

Fucking escort quests where opposite faction can kill the mob.

&gt; Anyone else feel like this greatly demonstrates how out-of-touch Blizzard is what comes to RPG elements and flavor that people want to see in an MMORPG game?
---
Blizzard is a PC company, thats also why they are banning everyone for using naughty words, have to protect the children you know.
---
MC won't be 30 minutes and AV won't be 15 minutes.
---
This 60 minute video could have been a spreadsheet
---
Played a month after bfa and canceled. Game is trash. Free loot, constantly grinding content that you’ve already done for weeks just for 1% improvement. Just isn’t fun. Stop giving me free stuff. Make me earn it
---
Just go boomkin, throw a hurricane then snipe some poor bastard with starfall (:
---
No problem. I'm just saying in every way enhance is a garbage meme spec but ele can do a little stuff. They are always bad at pve but an ele in AQ/Naxx gear is really dangerous. Big problem with ele though is if you are wearing anything but Naxx/AQ40 gear you are unplayable even in pvp.
---
Step 1: Don't play immediately on launch.
---
Step 2: ???
---
Step 3: Profit.
---
people are not getting their epic mounts in the first month.
---
Go read up, son.  Dungeons were 15-man, and at the beginning of time, were very, very hard to clear.
---
Honor was hard for healers.  It's why they changed it to whom you healed, duh, because even back then, priests didn't have a killing blow.
---
Yes, the first MC clear happened AFTER DM was released.  See what a new dungeon, new gear, new buffs, etc. can do?  And that was ALSO the time that the amount of Rag's sons were reduced.
---
You really can't argue well with factual information, can you?
---
Okay, so I stated you are either inexperienced or an idiot not both. Making my claim to be that I said you were both shows your inability to read, so now im thinking it might be the latter... Furthermore, recapping stonehearth is renown for being done before relief hut is taken and causes turtling. Alliance got frostwolf and didnt take iceblood, so this is a sub 20 minute AV, where people are taking 5 minute graveyard capture of a place atleast 5 minute ride straight there, not including time spent in stealth or other means if you are going STRAIGHT there... Stormpike is already taken, which shows that the horde have pushed to the bridge and taken the graveyard which is a 10 minute minimum amount of time.  
---
You aren't going to get a sub 20 minute AV with any of the scenarios states except the one you stated "What if the whole group is already at the boss and not dying?" Well if the whole group is there and not dying then hot damn you have yourself a fucking unicorn of an AV game, you got 40 people to go to a boss with massive cleave and noone has died to him? Can I get a strawfuckingman argument class?  
---
Capping a base takes 5 minutes, if you are killing NO WINGMASTERS (towers kill wingmasters, 5 minute caps... each) you are waiting around 10-15 minutes for the towers alone to cap since you cant start them all as soon as the bg starts. if theres any defense recap etc you have to restart the 5 minute timer. If someone you get this perfect AV where noone dies or very few people die and they are all grouped, AND they are not waiting for caps, yeah you will get the 15 minute av you are bitching about. But that just isnt feasible when put in practicality. You will get games where they are 15-20 minutes because both sides just rush and noone attempts to force a turtle, but you will also get plenty of 1+ hour games where some people force a turtle and create so much fun for all the people who dont want hour long bgs...
---
Priest: UD for PvP, Troll for PvE
---
Mage: UD for PvP, Troll for PvE
---
Hunter: Orc for PvP, Troll for PvE
---
UD gets you WotF, while orc gets you stun resist, both of which are very good in PvP. Troll gets you berserking which is huge, and also gets you bow spec for hunter which gets you easier hit capping by a significant margin. Honestly, they're all pretty close, so don't feel bad if you pick a non-optimal class nobody will really care if you are 1-2% lower in DPS. Knowing rotation, BiS, enchants, consumables, etc. will be much more important.
---
Professions, engineering is basically an auto-take late game on hunters. It's critical for PvP, regardless of your class, but hunters get the jumper cable/FD trick which is pretty fun, it's easy to rotate in your bombs because of the downtime in the hunter rotation, and you can FD/trinket swap making engineering CD trinkets really strong on hunters. 
---
On clothies, you've got a lot more options. Personally I like tailoring on priests, since you need first aid even less than other classes, and you will definitely need to get it for the bloodvine set. 
---
Fkin Kaya Flathoof with like 10hp, if you can't pull all 3 mobs off of her pretty much immediately, rip
---
Just skip it lol it’s not worth it. 
---
No, 5-mans were hard because there were MORE mobs inside.  The pulls took longer, the dungeons took longer, and Blizz was hearing from the part-time players that they didn't want to spend all day in Scholo.
---
Hunter it is then. Thanks :)
---
Bro I'm just a farmer farming potatos. I thought I'd raise them and sell them to the living humans in exchange for meat since the animals don't let me get close. I just wanted to live like I was alive. 
---
*Sigh* if that's the way it's going to be 
---
(*Teleports behind you*) 
---
You made it personal kid
---
I've read some solid tips so I won't repeat them, but remember, you are the Tank. You are the leader, communicate what you are going to do. "LoS pull here" "pulling back" "target skull first". Decent players will follow and listen to what you say and ask
---
are you retarded? CRZ isnt cross realm BGs, CRZ is added in with phasing to make dead servers not require a blade to run for 10 people on a zone.
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Cross-realm_zones
---
before u pretend like you know what they're doing you should atleast understand wtf it is you're linking.
---
even search cross realm BGs on this very own subreddit, people begging them not to put it in because it was in 1.12.1
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/search?q=cross+realm&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=all
---
there you go, in none of these threads will anyone have any source on cross realm bgs because they haven't brought up the topic for classic literally ever yet.
---
talking about things like phasing/sharding/CRZ has absolutely nothing to do with cross realm BGs
---
Currently running a 1080ti with an i7-8600k overclocked to 5.0ghz, 1440p monitor @144hz. I got 300+ fps at all times on the wow classic demo just like any other computer would that was built in the last five years. It's all overkill. Stop flexing because literally no one cares.
---
It's not just that though. While that is all a problem one of my biggest issues isn't just you get stuff for free. It's that you earn it all alone. There was far less content in Classic and TBC but, people complained far less because they always had stuff to do. For instance After you pre-bis in classic. You then go right on to helping guildies do the same. Who does this in retail? They will just tell you to LFR or LFD for it. Then you just spend all day completely alone and bored.
---
So glad you got certified.
---
Throw more dots. More dots now.
---
MC will be ~20-25 min by experienced guilds, and up to 8 hours for the average pugs.
---
AV will be a backdoor zerg fest, as most PvE players want their exalted for the epics.
---
I want a hat that has a shitty blurry gold star and “Certified Piece of Shit” written in the worst font I can find. Then I will be complete! 
---
If they shard ANY TIME beyond the starter zones at the beginning, we can cancel our subs then. 
---
No reason to tinfoil hat until that happens. 
---
Fucking retarded, those quest items are super good and will hurt progression.
---
With Korrak you at least had to work for them, opposed to getting them entirely for free.
---
There's nothing about cross realm battlegrounds in either of those articles you absolute retard.
---
Looks like he has that sick ass tank sword quel thalas or whatever it’s called
---
Cuz they're all at my house 
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Picking scryers/aldor and OH attunement quest in TBC.
---
For vanilla I would say that dogshit troll bones/necklace or whatever quest in southern  STV, where you need like 25 and theyhave 1-5% droprate.
---
&gt; From what I've heard on this sub, there are some guilds that are so good at MC, they can clear it in greens.
---
I heard they call all do it at Lv1.
---
&gt; Dungeons were 15-man, and at the beginning of time, were very, very hard to clear.
---
&gt; Honor was hard for healers. It's why they changed it to whom you healed, duh, because even back then, priests didn't have a killing blow.
---
That has nothing to do with the prepatch.
---
&gt; See what a new dungeon, new gear, new buffs, etc. can do? 
---
Had nothing to do with DM release and everything to do with players being clueless. 
---
&gt; And that was ALSO the time that the amount of Rag's sons were reduced.
---
Wrong. The number wasn't changed.
---
&gt; You really can't argue well with factual information, can you?
---
You are arguing with your ass. I'm not going to bother talking to a wall.
---
Weapon skill does not reduce glancing blows. You'll always do 40% glancing blows against a lvl 63 boss with 300 or 315 weapon skill.
---
Weapon skill reduces the damage penalty from glancing blows. At 300 wskill, a glancing blow does 70% damage of a white hit. This penalty is reduced by 3% for each point above 300. So as a human with 305 sword skill you'll still do 40% glancing blows but those will deal 85% damage instead of 70%.
---
MC absolutely will be 30 minutes by any decent guild. even with item progression on servers just having 40 players who are lvl 60, not AFK and pve specced mc is a joke
---
Been playing warlock for 14 years, so want to try paladin this time around.
---
MC will only be that fast for the most hardcore speedrunners spending a lot more on consumables and other preparations than they should to make the run slightly faster. 1 hour is a pretty reasonable, consistent clear time for a hardcore guild that is doing the raid efficiently after it has been on farm for months.
---
There’s an alliance quest in SoS to get a book that will take an hour to finish. Many comments on wowhead talk about killing over 200 mobs before getting the drops.
---
well, hot diggity dog I had no idea. I assumed it was part of the gate opening. 
---
kudos! I don't mind being wrong and being corrected, so don't worry about it.
---
the naga ones underwater near BFD too.
---
Oozes in wetlands but i think the worst of all is the shaman water totem
---
That's the one I had in mind when making this post, glad someone else agrees.
---
I got a 4,5 year old GTX 970 and play on 4k screen + a 1080p monitor, just to show you how much overkill your budget is :)
---
The best thing you could do is wait until summer and get the  Ryzen 7 3700X for around 330$ + 200$ for a fitting Motherboard and 16 GB RAM.
---
Maybe make it an even 1000 $ and get a RTX 2070 if you really want gsync.
---
 1070ti+i9-9900k is not good at all. Always spend more on the GPU as a gamer.
---
The CPU I mentioned is much better and 200 $ cheaper (if the numourus leaks are remotely true) than the i9 if you are wondering if its worth the wait.
---
old-school click bait
---
the 20min timer is based on BWL progression, and it will probably be even faster after that.
---
And I am pretty most guilds will be doing consumables/world buffs raiding, Ony/ZG/DM/Songflowers + flasks
---
&gt;1. A quest in Felwood where you have to bring lootable quest items to Undercity. The thing with this quest is that if you don't pre-plan, you will end up returning to Felwood just to farm more of the quest items.
---
There was another part in Un Goro if I remember correctly. Never finished that one.
---
Yes, you're right - drop tables. An item dropping has NOTHING to do with the stats on that item. I have no idea where you're getting the idea that the stats will change
---
Its a meme my dude, lighten up.
---
You dont use the dynamite for extra dmg as a paladin its so you have a way to pull at range
---
Wand now!
---
"Drop rates and locations "- where in that sentence does it say stats?
---
lol
---
Well, I mean, that is the game. 
---
&gt;I can't disagree with most of the points you're making, but I would like to point out progressive patches. This was changed due to community discussion. They went from 4 to 6 phases. Granted in comparison to AV that's a much easier change, but if people stayed quiet there's no guarantee we would have gotten that much.
---
While I don't disagree they weren't using the original content gating as something set in stone. IIRC in the panel they were using the four(?) content drops as a starting place. Its very difficult to make any inference since they're so quiet but I can agree that discussion helped.
---
&gt;But I at least want to make some discourse around it, getting people talking is better than staying silent, even if any hope is bleak.
---
That's a fair point and I don't have anything against it, its just annoying to see people here getting their hopes up on things that have basically been confirmed to not happen. It really makes this subreddit feel like an echo chamber.
---
&gt;Regarding the Warlocks pet thing, I never played enough of private servers to know how it worked there. But my memory from Vanilla on playing an alt Warlock was exactly as they stated, instant despawn. Not trying to flex or anything, but just wanted to say there are those who do remember things accurately. Maybe not everything, but definitely some.
---
That's cool but you would have never had confirmation that this was 100% how it happened without classic being a thing. People can attempt to defend their memory while be incorrect but being that we have so little data on vanilla wow available it's extremely difficult to prove. This is why pservers are such an amalgamation and all different from each other, no one can prove exactly how things were. 
---
So many good 3 and 4 letter names. Rare and valuable!
---
YES! I need them. Up until a patch, or a simulation of 1.4 patch ofc.
---
1. ND population is a fraction of what Classic WoW is going to be. It's not as simple as just launching more servers at launch.
---
2. The demographics of players that played ND on launch day is not the same as those that will be playing Classic on launch day. I would classify anyone that takes the time to gain access to a private server as "hardcore" and thus, more tolerant of people with the congestion of a crowded launch. I don't think your average new Vanilla player would put up with that.
---
Okay there guy
---
&gt; Works emails sent: 2
---
Yes actually very much, I haven’t looked at PC Parts in over 5 years but have heard heaps about AMD / the Ryzen series. If I was to get a 1060ti it would be on brand recognition alone. What is the Nvidia equivalent for that graphics card? Either way I saved the parts list and will look into it.
---
So the 10 seconds to craft is worth it to save the 2 seconds it takes to run into judgment range?
---
Welcome to the light brother!
---
on pservers fury warriors rule supreme and in speed runs they take insane amounts of fury warriors. Maybe a bit of this is caused by off-tuned scripts on those pservers, but you can be sure that fury warriors will also be very good in claasic. 
---
Same here. Best wishes tho
---
A lot of fights require the rogue to use prep to win, unless you are fighting someone that doesn't use abilities, or outgear/level them. Even then it's gonna be rough fighting hunters, warlocks, druids, mages, etc.
---
On retail, rogues are insane. At least in bfa season1. Super easy to play, and does a ton of dmg, with good utility. Not CD dependent to do dmg.
---
Yeah that AV update was very disappointing.
---
Tells ppl to stop flexing but proceeds to tell everyone about his overclocked specs. Dude what r u jealous lmao maybe he’s just not that experienced with this stuff and people led him to that set up and is asking for an opinion? What was he gonna do not list his specs when it’s difectly correlated to his question? What r u broke? 
---
Runescape got the name from me.  I've been rocking it since '95 or '96.

Heya.
---
My "BiS" lists are kind of a mish-mash of actual raiding BiS gear mixed with substitutions I personally want to make for PvP.  I used the link below to start with, should be more useful to ya.

---
&gt; The time limited models fit perfectly with the design themes of Classic
---
There were no intended time limited features in Classic (outside of holidays which recurred annually anyway)
---
&gt;Something tells me you're just butthurt...
---
And yet out of the two of us you're the one making ad hom comments to justify your "argument"
---
The worst part is that if you die to the elemental in Silverpine, you have to go all the way back to southern Barrens to get another sapta.
---
A Brazillion of them.
---
&gt; and it isn't the game for me.
---
the good news is the private servers are going to be 100% accurate after classic is launched
---
I trust them not to use sharding after launch for atleast a year
---
The dragon parts of horde onyxia prequest
---
Broodlord is doable as feral. We would have our feral and 2 other warrior tanks fight for threat, as he’s not tauntable. Druid’s typically have more armor and health than warriors, so may be better equipped to take the MS
---
What is wrong with dwarf warrior for competitive pvp premade? You telling me gnomes only? 
---
As long as your CLASS -&gt; SPEC is optimal for raiding, your  RACE  really doesn't matter.    
---
Maybe some guilds spread some info that they want the optimal optimal characters, but they talk out of their asses and everybody is lvl 0.  If you are lvl 60, and can show your skill and dedication you will be accepted no matter what your race is. ( if they need your class obviously)
---
Classic will share the same sub fee with modern WoW.
---
Even if they charge $50 for the initial game purchase, there is a demonstrated desire for this game from the community. Blizzard has done their homework on this, they're not just wasting their time.
---
You just proved my point
---
IIRC, the Classic demo actually had better fps on max settings than Vanilla private servers had on max settings.
---
So the Vanilla WoW system requirements should be more than enough unless you really want to ramp up the resolution.
---
I think an AMD Vega 56 would be the AMD equivalent of a Nvidia 1060 Ti. Here is a video card [chart](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gpu-hierarchy,4388.html) that should help you put everything into perspective. This [page](https://au.pcpartpicker.com/guide/) also has a bunch of other builds that are calibrated Australians. 
---
Server infrastructure is definitely a lot cheaper these days. I'd be curious to see how much the infrastructure costs compare to the rest of the costs of running Ckassic WoW.
---
I play games for more reasons than, HOO KILL BIG BADDY.
---
&gt; end game dungeons
---
TIL
---
My mojo so dope, bitch 
---
jesus christ man just craft a bunch while you go afk to take a dump or something.
---
While I think what you are saying has a lot of truth and many people make silly comments about how "easy" wow classic is to make - you might be better recieved if you changed your tone a little bit. Not that you necessarily care or anything, just saying. 
---
for the love of god stop making threads about sharding and loot sharing
---
its so annoying
---
theres hundreds of them
---
isnt wolfshead straight BIS until deep into TBC?
---
But the time you spent crafting can be the time you go take a shit and get some food, therefore not wasted?
---
&gt; with exceptions"
---
You’re turning them into a levelling achievement, I can’t imagine anything more un-vanilla than doing that. The only reason these were rare was people upgraded them to something new. I was a very slow leveller and had one in vanilla, and then I upgraded it the day the new ones came out, like 90% of people. The only thing that made them rare was people didn’t realise they were going to unavailable after the upgrade, or at least because at that point no one cared.   
---
This BFA attitude that they are a super rare mark of being old school is retarded - they never were. Back in vanilla everyone had them.
---
prior to 1.10"
---
See its the other way round for me, Why play an AV thats over in minutes? Waste of my time so instead I wont step a single foot in there compared to how much I was excited to play AV previously. C'est la vie. Might just be my time to leave WoW behind. 
---
And don't get me wrong, I'll be happy if they do progressive itemization. I'm not against it. But with info they've given us so far there is no indication that that is the plan. Hopefully they'll do another blue post and say they will do it. But as it stands right now that isn't the case.
---
I honestly believe that I will find many players who play the "proper" spec and  they will be worse than feral or ret. I perfectly willing to give them a chance because I truly believe that it's better to have a decent player with meme spec than a moron 
---
Sounds alot like my job 🤟 Plan to play at work haha
---
It's easy to find examples of guilds taking longer to clear molten core. Here's a guild that has Naxx on farm, and you can see them casually blitz through AQ40 earlier in the video, doing MC in 50 minutes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQZKz-_8EsI
---
Yeah I got a pretty decent office chair, that's enough for me, but the thought of looking down to a laptop from my comfy chair, doesn't sound enjoyable.
---
It's just me, but I'm not a big fan of playing on a laptop. I just like the big screen and the bigger keyboard from the PC.
---
First Summer is not "right around the corner" This is the first day of Spring which means we still have at minimum 3 months. Give them time. I would rather they get it right at launch then pull a No Man's Sky, rush it and screw over the entire community.
---
Expect July some time.
---
I really wanted old AV, with everything in it, I want to be stick in there for a week.
---
I want to play a Feral DPS druid, do the tier sets for druid help at all with feral or will I be stuck using what ever I can scramble together? This is actually kind of a big deal because I am a super big aesthetic focused player 
---
Yea 30/21/0 is all you really need, blessing of sanctuary is huge for pulling two packs at once. 
---
That's the #NoChanges! movement in a nutshell. They just use #NoChanges! to shut down discussion on any change they happen to not agree with.
---
this. consumables give you way more power than gear. example being a spell dmg flask gives you more dmg than a full pre raid bis set including DM.
---
not having people be 60 isnt a huge issue either on offtanks/paladins
---
also most guilds that are going for world first are stacking hunters because they scale with very little gear and can power lvl people with mob tagging once 60
---
things might change though if the EXP coefficients from the demo stay
---
Warrior seems to be the favorit yet, there's gonna be a lot of competition for tanks which is good for anyone else. Actually i voted warrior too 😅
---
Could be. I think some folks would argue it is for power shifting.
---
Definitely won't pretend to have nearly the same expertise as the dude(s) who made this list.
---
One thought on this AV "situation" is, if we KNEW they were basing everything else off of 1.12....why the fuck would people assume AV would be based off of anything other than the iteration that existed in 1.12?
---
I'm just confused why so many people are upset by AV being from the 1.12 patch when, as far as we know, everything else in Classic will be based off of that patch as well?
---
yeah, that makes up like half the server population
---
i love the sabers, but i don't want to roll NE. The struggle of classic.
---
What a genuinely dumb argument.
---
Glad to see your raid went like mine did.
---
True, on pserver with tough NPCs, top guilds would just get a couple of BWL-geared tanks &amp; zerg to the end, killing the boss without even waiting for the towers.
---
I don't know how much rogues make honestly, none in my guild pickpocket farm they all mostly herb or run strat live.
---
Same with bloodvine I haven't heard of too many people doing this, they are only worth like 3-5g on my server.
---
Our mages only farmed crocodiles to get their rep when ZG first released then they went back to dire maul farming
---
and dm north I think it's first boss, dogs and then bugs too 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxdbQ2mgUfQ
---
and here is one in 18 minutes.
---
MC is usually good to speed-run with world buffs so you can conserve them and do MC -&gt; BWL on the same day, and using the buffs more efficiently.
---
Exactly what I thought haha
---
So? Are public test mandatory to release a game now?
---
Are they doing public test for the diablo 1 or warcraft 3 remakes?
---
The non-tank warrior is so common it’s a meme. You’ll fit right in. 
---
first, they didn't say all the loot tables were being rolled back to 2004. they are delaying the release of some 1.10 items and adding two more phases. We also don't know if they will be updating gear stats or going with the final iteration. (mage gear started out with a lot of agility for example). 
---
Second, there are good technical and logistical reasons for taking a middle ground. i don't see it as cherry picking. They were pretty transparent at the [classic panel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhKkP8LryYM) that they didn't have complete database data outside of a backup of a back up they found on a back up that was "final 1.12 data". In all likelihood, they don't have an earlier version of everything, or at least don't feel confident enough with it to present as classic wow. 
---
Just as an exercise, go back through all the [vanilla patch notes](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.1.0) and really read everything they changed between November 2004 and August 2006. Do you really feel comfortable demanding that they recreate all of that? There are literally thousands of changes made in two years because blizzard had hundreds of developers working on WoW. If at any point you think to yourself, well they don't need to recreate that, then you are also 'cherry picking'. I would bet anything that if 100% 1-for-1 authentic recreation was the only option they had to make classic, they would have never decided to go forward with this project. However, they know the majority of people want progression, so they are trying to do what is the biggest bang for their buck.
---
A bunch of trash pulls and some bosses require (or at least are simplified by) a large number of offtanks. You don’t want any more than 2 or maybe 3 prot specced tanks, but you need fury warriors with the gear who can step in to tank. 
---
As a fury warrior I was offtanking for probably half the bosses in every raid and 3/4 of the trash in AQ. 
---
Huh i always wondered where that ivory raptor came from
---
Quel'Serrar, such an awesome looking weapon...
---
Someone has to do it. You're the hero we need at this present time. 
---
Another warrior to add to the "don't whisper to tank list". But also warrior dps was viable and topped at end game from memory.
---
0/11/40
---
Id accept it. Yes the longer older battles are way way way more fun but I think most that want it would take it for a limited time rather than no time at all. 
---
You can tank dungeons as fury anyways, and your guild will force you to pick up tank gear just incase of nax progression, or if you need to off-tank certain bosses/packs with your CDs (AoE taunt 10 min CD, and shield wall 30 min)
---
Inb4 99.99% are fury dps or arms pvp.
---
Hi, /u/ClassicQuestions
---
Would be interesting to see what kind of specc these guys are going for yes
---
Is cenarion circle rep available to farm before AQ?     
---
This is regarding the cenarion herb bag
---
The Yeti Quest chain in winterspring, I always have to kill like 100 of them to get the 2 horns for the Second Part.
---
Also Running in Felwood is pretty terrible.
---
Yes, worth more actually. You disvalue or left out the value in leveling professions entirely. 
---
I already acknowledged that speedrunners can go that fast. However it's not worth it as they end up spending more time preparing for the run than they save during it. Most hardcore guilds do not run MC anywhere near that fast on a weekly basis.
---
It is if it means being able to pull 1 mob instead of 3.
---
I've seen this exact screenshot before actually. The orc with that name gave it out. Now if only I could recall where...
---
Enjoy the pain.
---
Could you throw dynamite whilst being hit? If so looks fun for tank aoe grind leveling.
---
You can’t access a lot of sites but you can access Reddit?
---
IDK about you, but I don't spend 10.25 minutes every hour shitting (time needed to craft the following hour's worth of dynamite)
---
Also, both Druids were usually resto and wouldn’t be able to kill each other anyway.
---
My tanking tips... 
---
You are the party leader, so take the party leader role (the actual crown that lets you mark targets, and kick dumbasses). You almost always have the choice or the clout to take it. Healer being the lead is also acceptable, DPS as lead is a red flag. 
---
Lead the party, you're the point man. Don't let your healer run ahead for fun and face pull a hidden pack, tell everyone to wait in the last fully cleared room and check everything out yourself. Gives you time to mark all targets and identify problems (units with silence, roots, insane debuffs, etc). 
---
For CC: Moon is sheep, diamond is fear or MC, star is shackle undead, triangle is hibernate or banish, square is freezing trap, X is sap. 
---
Establish kill order: Skull, X, triangle, square. ENFORCE the kill order, when 3 DPS are burning skull it will die so fast that it doesn't matter who tanks it. You get to start immediately tanking X and whoever's left that isn't CC'd. If DPS attack whatever they want, aggro goes everywhere, you have no rage, everyone but you ends up tanking the fight because you need rage to peel. 
---
If it's important to control the mobs, tell the team to wait before dealing damage. 5 seconds is usually enough of a head start to get a more secure grip on everything. 
---
Learn each class as you play with them, learn their tools and their tricks, so you have more tactical options in your mind for difficult pulls. Not everything is gonna be simple as tank and spank. Hunters can pull mob out of a pack with feign, mages can set you up with a blizzard kite or nova to help you mitigate, locks can tank enemy casters instead of having to pull them back, etc etc. 
---
Be polite, be assertive and ask for what you need, and kick bad team players. Guys who refuse to focus skull, guys who refuse to wait when ordered, DPS who think they can pull again and again without saying a word about it... these people are common, and you need to ask them one time to stop their bullshit, then kick them if they don't acquiesce. You can 4-man trash while looking for a replacement, only role that's difficult to replace is healer. 
---
If you're worried you're gonna come off as a control freak, don't be. You are a control freak. Control is your job, embrace it. 
---
You’re not a true wow player then mate
---
You can always voice this in groups if you want to try tanking. It’s always best to try out tanking on smaller scale situations such as group quests, or when grouping with others. Usually the first dungeon would be ideal to try tanking. I’m pretty sure it’s just a lot of sundering/revenge procs to begin (haven’t tanked in 14 years). I know there’s a bit more complexity than that but those r some main abilities. be aware that if you tank dungeons at 60 you are much more likely to reserve the gear you want for dps as tanks are scarce and you won’t be competitive with a tank warrior when ur trying to dps a dungeon for dps gear. I think some tanks would go as far as to not let you roll or find another dps to avoid competition. 
---
Old school AV was fun imo.  I want it back warts and all.  It was War.  A true meat grinder.  And War is hell. Hashtag *no changes*.
---
My endgame goal is PVP with minimal grind for gear. That rules out gear heavy class like Warrior.
---
The other thing to mention is that I enjoy a very aggressive play style. Jump into the fray, attack on sight, pew pew, kill.
---
So far I've tried Druid, Hunter, and Shammy. And I played a Shadow Priest in Vanilla.
---
I love the tanking with Druid, but I'm not sure about the PVP. Being the best at running away is not important to me because I like to stand and fight. Druids might be very durable and can fight 2-3 people while waiting for reinforcements but can they kill? Also OOM = useless. Even Priests can wand for sizeable damage.
---
Hunter is great for offensive play. The biggest issue is if melee, especially warriors, close the gap. Sometimes they resist fd/trap then its gg hunter. Granted, I've only PVP'd a couple of hours, as opposed to weeks on my SPriest so I've still got a lot to learn.
---
Should I just roll a SPriest for the best offensive PVP without sacrificing survivability too much?
---
If I don't plan on using engineering at 60, there's no value in leveling it if it doesn't help me get there how i want to.
---
Do you think everyone on the planet will be playing lock? I try not to let that kind of thing bother me, but it does from time to time. Otherwise I think you are right, I may be rolling this class at launch too. I like to have simple rotations in raids too. Free's me up to pay attention to other things.
---
I really enjoy massive battles where one side can turtle before starting to push through tbh. Its just a shame entire games will now be over in minutes. 
---
Apparently this guy wants to play 24/7 without a single second afk to craft items. What an inspiration. 
---
Because you should be in Solar Sails, not Solar Sales.
---
What? The exceptions they're referring to are drop rates and locations - that's the focus of that sentence. They're saying drop rates and locations will look the same WITH EXCEPTIONS. the exceptions are to the drop rates and locations. You're either messing with me now or English isn't your first language. Theres absolutely no way to derive progressive stat itemization from that sentence unless you're just messing around. 
---
But whatever, believe what you want, just don't make a post here in the summer after the games been released complaining that Blizzard lied or something. You're setting yourself up for major disappointment. 
---
This is with full Naxx gear, split run and using EVERY possible buff.  Guilds will not have access to this gear for over a year, so will NOT be able to do split runs like this guild demonstrated.  
---
Didn't say that. I don't want to spend 10% of my time spent 1-60 AFK while crafting.
---
[Screenshot from the end of the night](https://i.imgur.com/JiUlW8l.jpg)
---
other info:  first screenshot of that series was at 10:03pm
---
last was 12:20am, so the raid lasted about that long.  No actual shots of the kill that I could find(I probably died that attempt), just one of her at 39% and the head in Org so I think we got it.
---
Then why not skip it all and run into judgement range? You’re going to spend time lurking the AH, spending gold on mats to spend more time crafting these items just to pull mobs?
---
It was the only battleground I would enter due to the massive stall fights at graveyards and the bridge. Did not care for PvP one but but AV felt different even when you get jumped and murdered over and over. 
---
Boomkin is totally viable for these battles. Stealth to an advantageous position and look for the big crits with starfire. Wrath will give away your location if your hiding behind terrain or obstacles or some bushes. Surprise starfire crits are hella fun.
---
Hunter is a breeze to level. Not recommended for PvP in high ping situations. They can perform well in the hands of someone who is a truly skilled player, though.
---
Nice!
---
I was OT in an alliance guild for MC-Naxx and somewhere along the line, all of my screenshots disappeared. I have one good one standing out front of IF in my 'dualing' set, and that's it.
---
Was kind of bummed I didn't have more. :( Thanks for sharing yours!
---
I like this 
---
You can play any way you like, just curb you expectations accordingly.  Like, really curb them.
---
Big enough community might enable them to do this. Otherwise they will split the community and it will get bad.
---
Bro 3 months away for a video game release is literally right around the corner. Ever hear people say time flies? Lol 
---
We’re already approaching Q2 2019 and don’t even have a month. I do agree though I don’t want them to rush and product crap 
---
That's what I've been confused about. 
---
There will be people playing this game fine on some laptops.
---
Wtf?
---
You'll spend a lot of time waiting for a group, recovering from mobs, waiting for a respawn, etc. There's a ton of downtime available.
---
Pick what you like
---
fuck the tryhards
---
9/10 guilds wont care about race

---
I don’t know if this is a troll or not but I actually associate my WoW gaming with both a specific set of actions, smells and sounds.
---
Before I would play back in the day my mom always made me do my chores and stuff so I would clean my room up, eat some food and then light an “Apple Crisp” candle from Walmart.
---
I would then put on some foo fighters circa 06/07 and crack open a full throttle energy drink and get down to business.
---
I plan on doing the same thing this time around.
---
Which mini bosses though? The ones in the final boss' room?
---
&gt; just to pull mobs?
---
I wouldn't use them to pull. Paladins have 8 seconds during fights when they've got no abilities to use. Dynamite's great to toss in during that downtime for a boost in damage.
---
And with no need to buy level 40 mount, I'll have the gold to spare, and "/1 buying stones @ x vendor, COD" has very little downtime.
---
I assure you 70% of those warriors will never see level 40 let alone 60
---
Haha, totally glossed over that.
---
Well maybe lvl 20 will be end game for some.
---
I can't wait to fish while working 🎣
---
starting zones only
---
Uhh, they wipe multiple times in the video. Not just losing world buffs, but wiping in general indicates a lower raid skill level. I would be extremely interested to see their farm run in naxx. 
---
I've personally cruised through Molten Core in one of the later vanilla patches with 25ish drunk stragglers in under a half hour. Still fully buffed after raiding the higher tiers, about half the raid opted for an optional MC run since most of us didn't need anything from it and it was a joke at that point. MT only showed up for Thundfury chance.
---
We weren't even that hardcore, like I said most of the guild got sloshed on raid nights. If you don't wipe, have the buffs and know the mechanics, MC is an absolute joke in terms of the damage and healing numbers it requires, post nerfs. It won't be that fast at launch, but a good guild will absolutely clear in under an hour during progression
---
Tbh - if you play a war the best grinding spots will be taken by ppl leveling faster than you. 
---
Ideally you want low armor AND low health mobs which can be pulled one by one. This is the same for hunters - so you Will Be competing against them. 
---
Id shoot just for regular mobs on your way between quests. If you notice mobs dying fast, grind them abit. Also helpes Not getting bored grindng same mobs for 10h. 
---
Depending on which quests Hubs are available in retail classic Not much grinding ist needed anyways.
---
By this same logic, shouldn't you be a fan of LFG and quick linear dungeons too? You know, like all the content *after* vanilla wow. What's with the rush? Why not prioritize fun?
---
This is the first time I've heard #nochanges with regards to new additions. I've always heard it in the context of WoW's systems, balancing, itemization, etc.
---
I've not been on the private servers so the ui is a shock to the system. I completely forgot that item rarity didn't used to be shown with a coloured border around the item
---
&gt;Also you people are forgetting 1.12 still has all the boss summons and everything. 
---
Haha yeah but that was in the game for a long time. Good luck getting a game long enough for you to get a single armour upgrade on your troops. 
---
The robot chicken escort quests. The one in Tanaris was horrific enough for it's length and the fact that it ended in Gadgetzan so opposing faction members could simply kill the damn thing if they saw you coming, but if you were a Hordelet then the one in Ferelas required you to walk past a large Alliance settlement which was hell if it happened to be busy.
---
Why is the tank pulling if he's not at full health?
---
Sorry you're being downvoted, its a valid point and question. One that I agree with, really. That comment wasn't really about AV specifically, as much as it was about the overall game itself. It was just a reminder that the game is what we make it.
---
But the point stands, pre-nerf(s) AV was an important part of the end game classic community and one that a lot of classic players remember. People remember dinging 51, joining AV, being grouped in the same BG as max level characters for the first time, and being carried through the cave quest to get IBS/Wand. And while they were lower level, they may not be able to fight effectively, but they could still contribute by collecting supplies and materials from dead enemies and turning them in to summon wind/gryphon riders, mounted scouts, and summon massive elementals in the field of strife. None of that is in 1.12 AV.
---
They remember many epic fights as horde pushed from snowfall to Stonehearth GY, fighting past Balinda and trying to get up the ramp. Being choked at Stonehearth Bunker as Alliance res'd from Stormpike GY and rushed forward to stop the horde attack. Or complete horde turtles in Frostwolf Keep as they protected the relief hut. None of that will happen if the current AV rush Meta is allowed.
---
With 1.12 AV, a lot of the nostalgia people remember will be missing. I'd bet 1.12 AV is closer to retail classic than it is the nostalgic memory of AV. Without the pre-nerf iteration of AV, and if cross-realms are implemented, then building a community similar to the actual retail vanilla will be difficult. Which is why I think a lot of people are somewhat upset about this AV announcement, it is somewhat a step in the wrong direction.
---
Not necessarily. Recovery = eating, drinking, bandaging and can't craft, once recovered, on to the next mob. My route has little to no group quests or need to wait on respawns if I'm doing things right.
---
EXTREMELY polarizing. Yet to see someone who thinks he's okay
---
&gt;  I loved being so small coming up the boss’s ankles 
---
ikr? I always found it funny when little gnome had a fucktonne of hp
---
its hilarious in pvp too cuz you are slightly less noticeable
---
Oh you poor thing. You're at work, and you'd have to wait until you got home to do this research on your own.
---
Here, let me help you.
---
There was a massive poll posted a while ago where respondents said 14.8% would be tanks and 18.8% would be warriors. Assuming most of not all tank are warriors, then there are very few people planning to be arms and fury. 
---
You’re absolutely wrong unless by “decent guild” you mean hardcore speed runners decked out in near full tier 2+, max consumables and buffs, who have been raiding together for months. So likely &lt;1% of the community. 
---
The benchmark for a decent guild once MC is on farm for a month or so is probably more like 2 hours. 
---
Its not a change its part of Vanilla. An older part sure. If we are going this way about it just throw in a max level boost and all dungeons and raids let people get it out of their system in 2 weeks and everyone can move on with their lives. 
---
Leveling a warrior is really hard work. My first char was a warrior back then and it was rough. But honestly i was really bad back then. Lets see what happens after the release i'm already excited.
---
When your only mentality is either I spend hours-days in a single BG, or I won't do it at all... You are so bipolar towards BGs I hope they do not cater towards your audience. The middle ground is what they need to shoot for and that is what they have done. The AV's could last a couple hours if people force them too, or they could last 15-20 minutes with a good team.  
---
Like if you want this extensive long-term pvp combat, form a raid group and go raid a Capital city, or a smaller town etc. You will get large scale pvp, and enjoy the shit out of it. But gating all players from gear because you want longer-term pvp isn't good game design.
---
Interesting that Paladin is so low considering how popular they are on pservers
---
Going Prot Warrior, we'll see if I can survive the grind...
---
Friend of mine is going Mage and we plan on leveling together so I'm looking forward to doing some massive AoE grinding.
---
&gt; Same with bloodvine I haven't heard of too many people doing this, they are only worth like 3-5g on my server.
---
myea I guess its only valuable for a short time during the zg gear hype
---
Just rush past eachother and nuke the bosses. Wont be any need to go for GY's or towers. 
---
If there are more than 3 mobs, a Mage to AoE &amp; frost nova is helpful. Mage sure that the dps has a target to focus on, and make sure you have good agro. You will probably have to use feral charge to go after that mob who breaks off &amp; attacks the healer. Tab around &amp; swipe different things to try &amp; hold agro on the group. Demo roar is nice, but it has a long cd and you could die if there are too many hitting you at once (unless excellent gear.)
---
Tank 5mans and your group will criticize you and tell you what to do until you're good lol
---
On a positive note for you: you'll probably be playing on an RP-PvE server, so people can't follow their natural urge to murder you.
---
You had a very clean UI for 2005! 
---
Our guild leader and mt went arms after our first untamed blade drop.
---
He overruled all the paladins who wanted to go all in on it.
---
He went back to prot the next day.
---
I will not miss loot counsels. 
---
That's what I counted on as I remember that Trolls got some additional quests along the game. I have leveled a troll alt around patch 1.9.
---
Actually not sure how much of the guild is the same as the one from this video I was remembering, don't care enough to verify: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoVCxeJQYEU
---
Start of P2 and 4/5 of the top DPS are Hunters LOL
---
Because saying "based" on is not an exact mandate. Many people reminisce over the old, long battles in AV, not the quick Zerg finishes. As this existed in the original game there was and may still be hope that it returns the way many of us old timers that remember it.
---
I've noticed a lot of complaints about paladins lately, with regard to their low dps and limited combat options. But what players are forgetting is the main reason Blizzard programmed Paladins. Paladins were not designed to be hybrid Tanks/Healers, as many claim. Instead, paladins were designed to be played while downloading pornography.
---
Paladins have roughly zero combat interaction, thus making them the perfect character to play while downloading massive amounts of hardcore pornography. Simply target a monster, hit "1", and minimize your window. Then sit back and enjoy the amazing girl on girl action.
---
Because a Paladin takes about one full minute to kill any monster, you can leisurely browse the erotic and pornographic fruits of the internet without much concern over your Paladin's welfare. After a minute, I go back to WoW, and usually my Paladin is alive and ready to loot the corpse. This is what makes grinding so pleasurable and convenient for me; the ability to simultaneously watch girls have sex with each other and level up at the same time. I doubt any other class has such an elegantly designed system, and I applaud Blizzard for their foresight in crafting a character that I can play with while playing with myself.
---
DPS? Who needs it? The quicker I kill something, the less time I have to watch boobies. Combat Interactivity? Overrated. I'd much rather interact with the girls writhing on my computer screen. Yes, a paladin was created for the sole purpose of surviving a fight while you stream hot pornography directly to your computer. That is why we have the high armor class, healing abilities, and the low, low DPS.
---
As for PvP, nothing is better than getting into Battlegrounds and soaking up the honor points while I watch girls take their clothes off for money. Only the minimum interaction is necessary for a Paladin to perform, and it is this very quality that I love the most about my Paladin. I doubt Rogues get any time to watch pornography while trying to vanish and rack up combo points, and I bet Shamans haven't seen a single naked breast while figuring out which totem to throw down before choosing which shock they are going to cast next.
---
In addition to grinding, we have several defensive options during combat that also allow us the flexibility of downloading pornography. Hammer of Justice allows a quick 6 second glimpse at a naked lady while our opponent is stunned, and Divine Shield allows a leisurely 8 seconds of quality right-hand time. Indeed, Paladins have cornered the market on the pornography during playtime of World of Warcraft gameplay.
---
It saddens me that many Paladins do not take advantage of the main functionality of your character, and are in fact lobbying for increased DPS, or more combat options. These are all unnecessary frivolities that would only harm our pornography downloading efficiency. Instead, we should thank the fine programmers at Blizzard for crafting a character that is great to grind with while grinding your loins.
---
I mean the only way we can test your theory is by having an early version of AV no?
---
I mean I guess. You don’t account for any bonus damage granted, the math is still off. It’s one of those things you can do if you want, but I definitely don’t see dynamite making a big leveling difference. What’s the cool down, 1 minute in vanilla? It’s not going to be up every fight. 
---
It's mostly wishful thinking.  The previous update we learned they are willing to add items in the 1.10 patch to avoid having overpowered items in the game at launch.  This got us thinking they wouldn't use a flat 1.12 mindset for everything else.  So now I've learned to not get my hopes up from here on out.  
---
Old and New mount models?  Doubtful
---
Class quests implemented on their respective pathches? Probably not
---
Fishing Extravaganza at launch? Who knows
---
Progressive itemization for items that got upgraded throughout the patches?  Extremely doubtful.
---
Original and upgraded T2 skins?  Don't think so.
---
Original ZG enchanting process? Not a chance
---
Pre-nerfed +defense gear?  Nope
---
Pre-nerfed +sp/healing greens? Nope
---
No Majordomo chest at launch? Nah
---
Thorium Brotherhood quests / rep rewards at launch? Most likely
---
Big fan Josh.  Be good to see a Paladin based interview...I still want to hear from the horses mouth that Paladins aren't viable for classic raid tanking...
---
Weakens mobs massively to the point of easily being able to solo anything thats not a boss character as well as some changes to spawn IIRC that sped up the game so the quests to turn in for bonuses like ram / wolf riders and the giant boss guys were pointless other than the small rep. We will never see either boss summoned with 1.12 AV (Unless you premade 40 man it and all turtle I guess) 
---
I mean your guild did it wrong then,
---
My guild had two dedicated windfury totem specced shamans to go into the warrior and rogue dps groups. 
---
Today the pserver scene is people who know what they are getting into with the holy-or-nothing mindset. 
---
Classic will go a different way, with a large portion of the potential player base today who never saw the game when non-healer hybrid classes were outright rejected and ridiculed. 
---
I would not be surprised if Paladins, Shamans, and Druids in classic are more in line with their TBC versions than their Vanilla versions. 
---
The scenarios are as follows, going from most likely to least likely.
---
1) Rep spillover and Cloth turn-ins are in Classic from the start, as they were there for 1.12.  
---
2) Rep spillover is there, but Cloth isn't.  
---
3) Cloth is there, but Rep spillover isn't.  
---
4) Neither are in, making Raptors Troll exclusive.  
---
Personally I don't think you'll have to worry, unless you're wanting to get the unarmored epic Raptors as an Undead (which was never possible in Vanilla).
---
Nah each game will take at very most 20 minutes. 
---
Another offspec warrior joining the run as a tank and seeing such a "tanking denier" can even kick him lol.
---
Basically the sharding system should be active at launch in order to prevent starting zone overpopulation making leveling the classic way impossible (if you have ever tried playing on some fresh pserver, you know this - waiting hour to complete simple quest gather xy items from mobs)
---
On the other hand the sharding should be disabled no later than the first player hits 60 as the start zones with major cities are important places for world PVP events shuch as city raids, where sharding would make that impossible (I still remember absolutelly epic 2 hour battle for Stormwind on one pserver - 300+ ppl)
---
&gt;Your dudu is given quest to obtain water form?
---
I'd rather not have my dodo be liquid :(  
---
On a more 'on point' note: 
---
This will probably at least somewhat be me.  Im hoping to do dungeons and stuff as i level as well, but i wont be speedrunning.  Ill be playing plenty, but that wont all be grinding time....and frankly we wont be the only ones.  Far too much of the playerbase is now older, have way more responsibilities (work, family, other hobbies, etc) than 15 years ago.
---
herb and tailor
---
while you farm maraudon u can also get ghost mushrooms in the purple side
---
Start new
---
Do you think pre-1.12 AV will be sustainable? I have a feeling people will not be sticking around for those day-long battles.
---
A precursory glance at the raid frames shows massive difference in class distribution and names. I don't feel like making a spreadsheet either, but going by Naxx full clear with no world buffs and the shit show of the first groups BWL, AQ, and MC I would say the first video is either an alt raid or the B team Raid 2 group for the guild.
---
I'd definitely like to see the group from the Naxx video do MC, they would probably manage a sub 20min run and that would just be from having to run around the raid
---
Whatever you do, don't level as prot. You're not gonna be able to hold aoe threat against a mage, nor do you need to since all mobs will be chilled. 
---
Just use sweeping strikes + whirlwund/cleave and taunt/intercept anything that gets to close to your buddy.
---
Yeah you will have that with 1.12 AV. Its just a shame for people who wanted to play the fun long drawn out games. 
---
This is it, warchief
---
Thanks for the tips :)
---
Why cant they? Blizzard are making many many sweeping changes like loot sharing and sharding so fuck it all changes. 
---
If you don't want to tank but want to melee DPS just go rogue imo. Unless you're only interested in casual endgame content and PvP, but just keep in mind it'll be much more difficult to find dungeon groups. Other warrior tanks will avoid bringing you to reduce competition for gear.
---
Nah, there were elite captains and lieutenants which patrolled different areas of AV. The one I remember most fondly was the NE Lieutenant the patrolled the ramp in front of Balinda's room near SHGY. He messed my world up a few times. He might've even been the reason why horde always went up the ramp between Balinda and SHB instead of the ramp in front of IWB.
---
They should still be in the 1.12 version, they weren't removed until the reinforcement cap was applied.
---
rofl
---
I wish I knew about these. How much were they going for at the time?
---
Nothing about an 8 hour AV was fun. I rather enjoyed the 30-60 minute AVs that we had on private servers. Of course they were faster if you had a pre-made in there or one faction was particularly organized. Those incredibly long AVs were unreasonable for the amount of time you invested for the amount of reward given.
---
Druids really excel at being outriders, you kind of float along the sides of the battle with the rogues and pick people off one by one if someone targets you get the hell outta dodge and if they are dumb enough to chase you they will likely get picked off themselves. 
---
Rogues with proper Druid backing are beyond a menace they are a bona fide force to be reckoned with popping out of nowhere killing some healers and running back to nowhere as fast as they showed up.
---
Despite the 100+ Strat UD runs I had to endure to get my D1 legs and the tears I shed trying to complete that same dungeon in under 45 minutes subsequently (which is HARD), completing D2 is still one of my favourite WoW memories of all time.  So worth it!
---
That's specifically a problem with the pre-1.4 kodos being drab and difficult to distinguish from the 60% mounts which are themselves drab and close to indistinguishable. I think the white frostsaber, raptor etc are timeless mounts that stand out, not something I'd miss the chance to buy.
---
Nah, I only want an epic raptor as my first or second epic mount. Leveling in a Troll/Orc zone will greatly help to archieve that.
---
They did change the costs around in 1.12, didn't they? Like 100g for a mount and 900G for epic ridding skill?
---
You better bring some really solid dps, because any serious guild will want their warriors to have a tank set to help with adds/trash.
---
Interesting position to be in, I've never thought about the region limitations.
---
There are lots of other videos as well around 20-30min mark.
---
always something new
---
go horde and pick a caster
---
yeah mage is pretty casual and priest is good too.. both great dme lasher farmers.
---
herb and skinning then at 60 u can drop skinning for enchanting if you plan to farm dungeon bosses ( so u disenchant the loot) - u only need 1 skill level. Or keep skinning as its usable farming dmn first part.
---
I kinda fancy the AFK auto-attacking playstyle tbh, as I like to watch TV while playing, and the less buttons I have to press the better.
---
Even if it is slow
---
There needs to be a notice on the bg pop that says if its in progress or not &amp; how long it has been if so. Dodging an in-progress if its more than a few moments in shouldn't have a penalty. 
---
There is even a Joe!
---
Leveling as an engineer is really only worth it if you're a hunter. The ammo you can craft gives good bonus dps and saves money. 
---
Seriously. I've been recently playing on a TBC pserver while I wait for classic and it feels like I can sneeze and get a level. Definitely is noticeably faster to level. 
---
Boom
---
If you're damn near full rage during a fight, you're not doing it right. Rage dumping via herostrike or cleave were good ways to keep me aware. Tank for long enough and some shit will slip by you because the 5man or raid was just moving along too smoothly.
---
Hey! Thanks for listening, that Paladin PvE call has already been recorded and will be on the show in the next 3-4 episodes! :)
---
1.12 there might as well not be NPC's or locations on the map other than the 4 bosses. 
---
Yeah, they made the skill expensive but the mounts cheap, which makes a lot more sense.
---
If you're just after an epic raptor, you don't have to worry. I will say plan your route carefully though, as quests give diminishing returns on rep as you outlevel them.
---
Yes by guilds that massively out gear the raid.  I have been raiding since beta on retail and private realms.  I am telling you 100% nobody will be doing MC in under an hour until at least phase 2 and more likely once guilds have BWL on complete farm.  Also private realms are far from perfect, which means ANY run done on private realms cannot be taken seriously in terms of clear time.
---
Lol is this a reference to Dwight talking about the apocalypse to Jim? If so, gold
---
soooooo.... it reduces glancing blows? He didn't say it reduces the frequency of glancing blows. I would interpret "reduces glancing blows" as reducing the damage reduction. 15% extra damage 40% of the time is a pretty significant dps increase like he stated.
---
15man UBRS was the shit. Until you realized you had been carrying the hunter the entire instance and he couldn't kind General Drakkisith.
---
Yep, I get interactions like that quite often in retail
---
Locks also get healthstones for QoL, if you're gonna mention the mana geme for mage. 
---
I too am split on Mage/Lock (and shaman). Mage was my OG vanilla char, but I'll always regret not finishing T3, going for Atiesh, or trying the elemental build. Shaman I've mained since late BC, but I haven't played wow anything close to seriously since Cata. Warlock is the shiny new class that really intrigues me, but I'm afraid of feeling the grass-always-greener feeling when all the mages are teleporting, making water, getting tips for portals, etc and having fun with their different builds. Definitely more build diversity for Mage, but lock also gets the flexibility of same specs for PvP and pve
---
Holy shit, salv works way different in classic vs Wrath (when i started)
---
.........maybe.
---
&gt;I already acknowledged that speedrunners can go that fast. However it's not worth it as they end up spending more time preparing for the run than they save during it.
---
For MC alone, no. But as I said, its common to do MC + BWL (at least during progression), and then just gather all the world buffs (which you want for BWL progression) and then just speed-through MC and into BWL for better efficiency.
---
I am sure it will be a thing on classic realms as well.
---
&gt; Most hardcore guilds do not run MC anywhere near that fast on a weekly basis.
---
Think 20-30 min will be common for most guilds that are progressing beyond MC, maybe 40 min if they have low-threat tanks.
---
and I think they will do it on a weekly basis, as you always have the bindings, or people who need other random shit. And ofcourse the reagents for guilds, MC is just quick, easy , fun and you can go all out on DPS compared to BWL (super threat sensitive).
---
Speed-running MC might sound like a bad thing, but I think its really fun tbh.
---
[how to play paladin](https://m.imgur.com/7XQeZhp) 
---
You should definitely have gotten the highest rank you achieved in vanilla. If you watch Swifty’s pvp videos from TBC &amp; Wrath he’s always wearing the Field Marshal title which he grinded out way before BC release. 
---
&gt; Man, I am not 15 anymore, I have shit I need to do.
---
yes, we all do but you can relive it without finishing an AV every 20 minutes
---
you wont be throwing it on the cd every cd probably.
---
Wow, that definitely looks like a good start. Thanks alot!
---
The hotkeys for marking are in your keybindings list, somewhere down near the bottom.  I usually set mine to the F1-F4 keys.  
---
You can also watch Laintime videos if you want even more reasons to play a Undead Warrior
---
If you can propose a reasonable alternative, I think we're all ears.
---
The problem with this type of poll is you are only offering people one choice, out of all the players I know 95% of them have multiple characters that they play regularly.
---
I will be rolling mage priest and lock to start and then once I have those characters 60 and raid capable I will then start some more alts.  
---
We also dont know the player retention rates, we may start with 25% warriors and end up with 10% warriors after 6 months.  We also dont know the split will be even on every realm, it could be that some realms lack healers.
---
Polls mean nothing
---
Potential bug, I think some people put in tickets around 2.0.1. back in the day. Not sure how much it will do you now, not sure a GM would know what your title was that far back, but who knows might be worth the attempt. 
---
Also, is this for sure the character you got to rank 10 with? It is based on the character, not account. My alt at the time only got Sergeant, and a few old alts had private/grunt (whatever the horde versions were). Only my warrior (main) had Knight-Lieutenant. 
---
Why the TC hate? 10% attack slow is the biggest mitigation effect you can get vs. physical DPS, definitely worth the stance swap
---
I’ll look those up now, thanks for the info!
---
&gt; Prot paladins can be used in raids. We have both a prot and ret paladin in all our raids and it works fine. They really excel in AoE threat because of consecration, so whatever boss or trash has loads of adds it makes it so much easier with a prot 
---
This is all wonderful but, do you have actual examples? I remember myself tanking some trashes in 40 mans but it was so rare that it is not relevant to me. There is nothing that encourages to have a prot paladin tank in the long run let alone to gear one. The only reason you will use one in 40 mans is to troll / for fun, or in extremely rare cases like you mentioned.
---
&gt; With a proper prot paladin and a good healer you can smash your way through Scholomance or Stratholme so effing fast it's almost like a BFA dungeon. 
---
Just to be clear, I was talking about protection paladin in 40 mans raids. But I agree, I know even ZG is fine as a MT paladin since I did it quite a bit in Vanilla.
---
&gt; So IMO they should fix hunters instead of the hybrids. 
---
I totally agree that what happens to the hunter is scandalous as well, plus the fact that warriors in the other hand are the perfect hybrid. But when we talk about talent improvement à-la-TBC, it's benefiting everyone. The whole point is that people are saying that there is a good reason to not implement 1.12 AV. So as a reminder, class talent could use a revamp that, fortunately already exist, the ones from TBCs. This would solve many cases and would increase people gameplay variety and fun in general.
---
I am pretty sure stuff like healbot and decurse will work.  The only change they might do is change the ui to Post neef. ( you could set it so you only had to spam one button to heal the right target) after nerf you saw full raid and could click the one you wanted to heal. 
---
The stuff I want Is my old UI back and I had it working on a private 1.12 server just to test it out.  
---
and decurse and healbot (If I’m going to roll a priest again).  But I’m leaning towards playing the only class I never touched in vanilla Hunter.  
---
Raid assist well they where present in early game even dkp monitors. So I don’t think that will change either.   
---
Definitely the same character. Been trying to find some evidence, but I am not sure it'll be convincing. I have the old rank 10 armor, but that's still obtainable in game, so it would be pretty meaningless to a GM. I'm not too concerned about it. I'll just have to grind out a new title in Classic ;)
---
I have some google Docs put together by a fella named Taladril.
---
I have no idea the backstory behind this person, but they have a SERIOUS amount of information. The gear list is likely going to be useless, but it has a serious breakdown on threat in Vanilla and talent builds.
---
I have this so that in the off chance I need some incredibly in-depth looks at threat to help me in my (hopefully) casual raid scenarios, I have it. And now it's yours if you want it.

---
Shh.. dont tell anyone
---
Why on earth would you want to do this?
---
World PvP, has been the most memorable and enjoyable part of wow for me. Even past vanilla every new expansion I've had countless moments of this was amazing from world pvp.
---
And back to vanilla/classic, that's the thing I'm most hyped for. 
---
Aenigma from Burning Legion? I think I remember your name. Did you played in Sin or Eternal Prophets by any chance?
---
I like you mathadin, the more I read your posts the more comfortable I am in my choice of a herb alch Paladin.
---
Hey, It's 1000x better than a convenient 10:18 second video about a blue post that can be read in less than 30 seconds. 
---
have u tried doing the 45min run with raid gear people? friends or pay people
---
I'm not talking about winrate balance. I'm talking about fixing game breaking bugs, exploits, bug abuses, keeping it "fair". It was a nightmare due to the sheer size and amount of NPCs packed into the zone. There was just too much clutter to maintain and it was probably draining resources.  
---
Stays fun for me the whole time. I dont care about the marks or the honor or the gear, AV is the one BG that was fun. Go in with some friends and have a good time just exsiting and doing things. Sacrifice fun for efficent 10 minute mark farming sounds terrible.  
---
Taladril wrote the book on feral druid tanking.
---
Quite interesting reading. I can recommend it.
---
https://www.dkpminus.com/wow/guides/taladrils-treatise-on-druid-tanking-in-vanilla/
---
This is solely because only alliance can paladin. Same with shaman. If this poll was separated into factions you'd see paladin be very high.
---
1.12 AV is actually horde favoured since you can jump the back fence without any type of fight from the guards / archers. 
---
Nothing wrong with that, my friend. But actually I was referencing one of the most famous WoW vanilla machinima vide, search for "big blue dress" on Youtube.
---
Ever heard of a sleeper car?  
---
You take an unassuming car, lets say a grandma car or something, and you put a monster of an engine in it. When you're at a stop light in your grandma car and someone starts to rev up, you have a surprise for them and you smoke them on the green.  
---
That's what's so fun about a sleeper. Nobody knows.  
---
I consider the unarmored epic mounts to be sleeper mounts.  
---
the requirements are whatever BFA has....end of story
---
I agree, it will take longer until phase 2, but I won't imagine phase 2 being that far off, as people will hit 60 pretty early on.
---
&gt;which means ANY run done on private realms cannot be taken seriously in terms of clear time.
---
Private servers usually have 8 slot debuff cap on MC phase, so it will be probably be somewhat quicker on retail.
---
Adding it to my WoW Classic bookmarks, thanks!
---
Its the only BG I enjoyed becasue it was a big battle and was very rarely ruined by premade groups. Now you guys will be able to get your items after a day of play and we dont get to enjoy any PvP at all. It just seems a bit lopsided. 
---
Mmm mmm, I wish I still owned my Toyota Soarer
---
Can you please go horde so I can gank you. Thanks.
---
Games prior to 1.12 could end early too. The battleground can be a Zerg fest at any patch. It’s about player meta not the battleground itself.
---
Anything you wouldn't mind sharing on the warlock builds or BIS pre raid?
---
Sidas Bag...
---
The Sleeper Has Awakened. Escort a druid across half of Darkshore and half of Ashenvale at a snail's pace. Also, he falls asleep every 10 seconds and you have to blow a horn to wake him up. And mobs spawn to attack you. And you didn't notice that he fell asleep again, so now you have to go find him.
---
I agree with you that Warlocks will be much more popular this time around.  I think they were the last class to get reworked toward the end of Vanilla, and because of that they weren't played much because they simply weren't that great before then.
---
*Thoughts* 
---
Why are we playing here sunshine? you wanna build a rig in 2019 you build for VR or you build so you can build into it, my AMD 6300 brick machine I use for running MAME (Old fighting games) with a GTX 550TI runs current WoW at 60 and I don't see why it shouldn't run vanilla at 60 too.
---
Now if you want me to make you a classic brick with some sick neon lights and warcraft stickers on the cheap I got your back, otherwise get your battleship out of my bathtub, no offense.
---
Yeah that's fair, might be. Mostly just fighting against the ridiculous notion that any experienced guild with a future will clear MC in sub 30 minutes while BWL is still progression content.
---
People here who say how AV will be just a rush... I was playing on Stormrage EU back in Vanilla (after 2006 Q3) and I can't remember ever having a rushed AV. And I did tons of them, I was exalted before hitting lvl 60 it is by far my favorite BG. I think people just overestimate the relevance of private servers where players can rush. I think we'll see some very surprised confused people who think they are pro vanilla players and then experience REAL vanilla...
---
That guy is a douche.
---
The original client runs perfectly fine with integrated graphics in an old i5 laptop... With any HW capable of running recent games, you will be fps-capped by display refresh rate. To prevent tearing, you can safely turn on V-Sync - no need for any adaptive sync technology.
---
On private servers.   Id be very shocked if anyone clears MC week 1
---
Nah one of the things about realm transfers is that you could go from PVP to PVP but not vice versa
---
IIRC the Rank 10 armor is only obtainable if you also gained Rank 10 in Rated Battlegrounds. So maybe if you show that you have the Rank 10 armor, yet haven't done Rated Battlegrounds, that could be proof. 
---
A class that's great to grind with, while grinding your loins
---
Nah playing Path of Exile for the moment.
---
Eh, that’s assuming people will hit 60 in a month. Most will not! 
---
Honestly mate I recommend just dealing with your "fears" of tanking. Start small and work yourself up, tanking is not as hard as it's made out to be, and groups won't hate on you for making mistakes. You will enjoy warrior and overall the game way more if you just learn to deal with that.
---
Thats a really silly statement though, Its like saying you are a 30 year old man child becasue you wont play BFA. 
---
Man I wish someone like you existed for every class. Some of the best posts in this sub is your calculations, even though I will never roll a Paladin.
---
They don’t want retail players feeling “obligated” (by themselves) to play through Vanilla for achievements - and I really agree.
---
If people need anything to “draw them” into Vanilla, they don’t want to play it in the first place. 
---
I'm aware of diminishing returns that's why I want to get there as soon as possible but yes I'll have to play my route as in leveling in The Hinterlands etc.
---
I have to choose whether I'm convinced by your... not very elaborated comment, or by other super-elaborated comments up there saying otherwise. 
---
Hard thing to do.
---
"Would I rather be feared or loved? Easy. Both. I want people to be afraid of how much they love me." -Thrall
---
If people are really in it for the community shouldn't they be able to fine other pieces of content BESIDES dungeons and raids to for a community around?
---
Noone on this sub, thats why we want classic. 
---
Groups with caster mobs, ranged pull then LOS so you can stack them up easier and tab target sunder/HS. Helps if your engineering and have dense dynamite / iron grenade for big pulls where you don't have much CC as well, so your not in panic mode trying to save the healer and such. A big part of tanking is all about positioning.
---
I think the question is if you plan on being an engineer 300/300 at 60 than its worth it.  If you aren't planning on being an engineer 300/300 than its not worth it.  Duh
---
Feral DPS has very specific gear requirements due to the emphasis on hard shifting for more energy. Hard shifting is essentially the only thing that makes feral DPS work and in the early raids you can even compete with rogues, that changes of course as Vanilla goes on. 
---
Stuff like Manual Crowd Pummeler and Wolfshead Helm are bis due to the many quirks ferals have to deal with. Tier sets are not highly regarded by even orthodox druids but I can't imagine you'll get any mileage out of it as a feral druid either. Those sets are just not optimized for melee dps, much less the odd requirements of feral dps. 
---
How do you manage rage in that scenario?  The brief tanking I did in WC for a not-so-public server was that I was rage starved the whole dungeon.
---
It was my first time tanking in a classic environment, but I don’t know why I couldn’t generate rage to save my life!
---
Learn to tank. No 5-man dungeon group will bring you because the tank (most likely a warrior) will not want competition for gear. Its not that hard and once you get the hang of it it can be quite fun and you will make many friends quite fast. 
---
Depends on the person, This + loot + sharding make me not very excited.
---
&gt;less suck, more pro
---
=))
---
oh and that radiohead song linked in the description is the wrong one I think
---
in the wow video it sounds like a remix
---
I feel like all the people brushing over “to get to 60” either understate how much they actually played this game (like casually dropping 20 hours over a weekend) or have never played Vanilla without the XP nerfs (2.4 onwards every expac) 
---
I haven’t figured out which yet.
---
&gt;Step 1: Don't play immediately on launch.
---
&gt;Step 2: get parties filled with casuals and spend 10x the time of someone that claws their way past lvl 20
---
&gt;Step 3: Don't Profit.
---
FTFY
---
That's a lie they are telling us. They'll "change their mind" on this later. If BFA cannot handle large scale world PVP without Activision intervening, why would Classic be any different? They're both going to run on the same server architecture. 
---
Hi, /u/Firahlus5
---
I really want to play an enhancement Shaman this time around.  Back in vanilla I played a tauren druid and then a dwarf paladin.  I loved my paladin as ret/holy hybrid spec.  With the right gear, i healed just fine in dungeons and raids.  My only fear is a quick gear swap in enh spec won't be enough to do sustain a group heals.  I'll be casual enough this time I won't raid (maybe 2nd string buffer).  Should I try enh?  Are there any hyrbid enh specs? I hear enh is meme spec but I enjoyed my retnoob and made it work; is it possible to the same with enh shaman?
---
Most people have time for it. Problem is a few of you guys only care about the rewards at the end of AV and not the journey there. 
---
If you are going to rush out AV to get the items I get it but remeber you wont ever be going back. The change makes AV entirely pointless other than the rewards. 
---
Ooh I forgot about Levitate!
---
Not a three monitor setup :) I have a 1060 with three 1080 monitors and its has struggles now with wow on one :D
---
Talk about biting the hand that feeds. I got downvoted for saying the same exact shit.
---
twas pretty brave not to  sell it for mount money
---
So much masochists here... Warriors...
---
Rogue near the bottom
---
Druid near the top
---
Well we know this poll won't reflect reality lol
---
this is a legit strat for druids / shamans to bait out a counter spell / kick / pummel / shield bash / earth shock / felhunter bite. If your opponent is *actually good* they will most likely (the first time at least) instinctively interrupt you as soon as they see the healing hands animation (if you are doing it at the proper time - low hp, etc) and then you can get a free heal off. You can alternatively just stutter step your cast and risk it. Sucks when you do either of those tactics and your opponent has 0 initiative to interrupt you, making you wonder... wtf you just wasted your time doing.
---
Deep Ocean, Vast Sea is by far the most annoying/worst quest in the game. There's a reason it was voted the most annoying quest in WoW prior to TBC's release. 
---
people will regret chuck norris
---
its all 4chan altright memery now
---
but the good thing is blizzard retail wont allow toxic crap unlike pservers
---
YOU ARE GOING TO DPS ... VERY VERY SLOWLY.
---
AND BY SLOW I MEAN FUCKING SLOW.
---
Priests are unique in that dwarf gets a critical skill that smooths out many raid bosses.
---
Honestly no. You don't need BWL gear to tank this boss at all. The difference between T1 from MC and T2 from BWL is less impactful than people claim it to be.
---
Same question here, I tried doing RFC and outside of bloodrage couldn't generate enough rage to even sunder, and people kept pulling aggro
---
Unironically I am simply going to talk more. 
---
Sure I suck the big shit at being sociable IRL but this is kinda my jam and I am assuming everyone back in the same boat as me is heading to the same destination you know? 
---
I actually made a little hidden objective for myself to max out my friends list before I hit 60 because it's easier to make friends than time is a saying I absolutely adore.
---
Dont put them exclusivly on the PvP servers. 1 of each. Older AV is the only fun version of PvP that has existed in the game. 
---
Oh totally, and I'm not exactly losing sleep over it. I just feel a little twinge of regret when I see the Classic and TBC collectors editions side by side and don't have the third one to finish the set.
---
That said, you're absolutely right the first day rush is awesome and waiting would have dramatically changed my experience. I was one of the first miners into Sholazar Basin and made a fortune mining Saronite, crunching it down and selling gems.
---
From what I recall on my druid, you'll have pieces from sets and mostly rogue one offs.  i'm not a min-maxer so I'm not 100% on that.  I only remember T1 has lots a spirit and not much else.  I was tauren and I looked a little silly in rogue gear.  If you play NE I expect you to look like a NE rogue out of your animal forms.
---
go through this thread https://np.reddit.com/r/SelfAwarewolves/comments/b2ckd0/jordan_peterson_fan_putting_2_and_2_together/eirxbp7/
---
step 1) mark targets
---
step 2) dont have stupid dps
---
step 3) profit
---
(step 2 is a nigh improbability so good luck)
---
But almost every thorough paladin leveling guide I've seen recommends getting engineering for the 1-60 slog.
---
Hence me doing the math to see if it's a good idea or not.
---
I would extend it to be the story of gaming in general. It might also just be that most vanilla players are older now and don't have the time to doodle around in AV for 4 hours. Though I know there will be kids playing Classic as well, especially since the sub also gives access to BFA.
---
I think Classic will be a mix of both casual and hardcore. There will definitely be the hardcore private server guys, but seeing as relatively few guilds on private servers are hardcore, I suspect Classic will be even more casual. I'm probably gonna go a bit more hardcore than we're doing right now on my server. I don't really care if everyone is bringing consumes etc, I just want a raid full of people that are alert and not go afk in the middle of the raid....
---
Be the change you want to see in the world!
---
No changes Pepega
---
myep vanilla now will not really be much like it used to be
---
Smart. Might need a few more, that way you can use targets 1-4, sheep, ice trap, hibernate, and banish/sap. 
---
All about healing and evading, those fights are not common and are normally very 1 sided and over quickly
---
"watch TV" ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
?
---
Is this what you do? https://youtu.be/7D_eAtU4_DA
---
I dont think I had a single AV that lasted more than 20 minutes post 1.12
---
I could be wrong but most were over in 10-15. The only way I got to see the bosses anymore was to go in with a group and we would all rush the turn in items, They would make it just outside of the base before it was game over most of the time. 
---
He was a hardass and made a lot of dick decisions but he was a genuinely likeable guy.
---
some crap wand was my first raid epic too I think
---
the item nobody else cared for so it was gonna be disenchanted
---
DPS warrior has a lot of advantages over rogue. Far better sustained cleave damage, better group buffs, charge/intercept/intim shout, execute, recklessness etc.  
---
Rogue you get some fun stuff like stealth and sap/blind, but if you're just strictly talking melee pve dps there's no reason to be going rogue automatically over warrior.
---
It’s a good point. I played very little in cata and the realization came to me after the 3rd straight day that I didn’t leave stormwind: the game in the current state is the biggest single player game I’ve ever played. it isn’t a multiplayer game by default. 
---
What I mean by that is you can literally play 90% of content without ever talking to another person. You join queues, you do events, and if you want you never have to interact with anyone. 
---
That is the thing I miss more than anything about wow classic. Building my network of contacts to either pvp, raid, or do dungeons. 
---
Didn’t have the same experience but I do remember the last week of honor “not counting” as honor was not an instant amount gained. I was very sad as my enhancement shaman was rank 12 and had that week counted I am almost positive I would have gotten to rank 13. 
---
That being said I continued to be able to use my title of General until I sold my account (worst decision ever...). 
---
Spam wands
---
Any serious guild will be running 8 pure fury warriors at least. For the vast majority of raiding 2 off tank is plenty.
---
From the private servers I've played on, locks are always in demand. Don't be surprised if you find yourself as the only lock in pug raid like ZG/AQ20, or even Onyxia.
---
No changes
---
Lemme tag this one for later.
---
Confirmed, Voidwalkers better tanks than paladins.
---
If you want these changes classic is not for you.
---
Alright N00blords, here's the deal. Get yourself a cloth shirt and 5 red coolaids, run to the middle and greet them with your Master Yiiiit
---
Congrats!!! 
---
Escort quest in RFD. All 4 of you were about to start Mordresh - but wait, the fifth douche just started that jailbreak escortquest. D'oh!
---
Anger Management.
---
So many warriors arent aware of how ridiculously good this talent is. The Tooltip is wrong. It generates 1 rage per 3 seconds constantly, including in combat. In instances this means your rage bar ticks UP in combat, decays slowly and generally is just a lot easier to manage. Couple with the fact that you get 5/5 in Tac Mastery to get it, which makes stance swapping a breeze so you can Charge into combat if it's safe, and use Thunderclap without any rage loss, your first 11 points should go into Arms regardless of your chosen spec. 
---
Also, dont use Heroic Strike or Cleave unless you're above 50% rage or you'll be wasting not only the cost of the skill but the rage you WOULD have generated from the auto attack it's attached to. You almost want to forget they exist in most "easy" tanking situations.
---
Any Warrior build that doesnt include 11 arms for Anger Management is self gimping themselves for no real reason, as it helps so much in all the situations where you might otherwise be rage starved.
---
Just wish they'd correct the tooltip so people realise how good it was.
---
Hipster effect.   
---
Q: How do you know if someone wants to play druid in Classic?  
---
A: Don't worry, they'll make 5 threads in /r/classicwow about how amazing vanilla druids are.
---
Loving the show format lately. I was listening early on but got kinda turned off by the regurgitating of forum posts and the whole no changes stuff.
---
But the unique and original content/talkshow format is really awesome. Keep up the great work!
---
Anything Nessingwary. 
---
Sharding, Loot trading and then this. 
---
Its one shame after another to the point where I guess I am to old to play WoW and must move on I mean what will the next one be? Ill keep an eye out for one of those retro style MMO's people are working on, No hopes though. 
---
Because if you are spamming BS every GCD then you don't have GCD's left for sunder. Heroic strike doesn't interrupt BS, just adds to the threat
---
hahaha precisely 
---
This is you pulling a Dunning-Kruger 100%.
---
Solo? Yeah it's hard work. On a new server in a levelling rush where every zone is chock full of players wanted to group/heal/buff each other? Nah, warrior is pretty straightforward.
---
"Name Taken"
---
Corazu,
---
Thanks for letting me know, I too much prefer this format, and it was my hope for the show the whole time. The earlier episodes are quite different as I was just needing to build up a listener base and encourage callers, luckily now they’re kicking down my door to come on the show, never thought I’d be in that position! Thanks so much for listening :)
---
tank is at full health you obviously missed my first statement, of prehots or shields.
---
You're right, but people don't 100% attendance even in hardcore guilds. If one of the offtanking furies can't make it to the raid, you may have to fill that role. 
---
It also makes sence to have your lowest dps warriors as the offtanks.
---
Embarrassing.
---
I think i payed around €280.
---
No changes means only stuff include stuff that was in Vanilla, Notice how almost no one is upset over dungeon and raid launches being staggered on a faster timeline? 
---
We have many non blizzlike changes anyway like the loot ninja tool and sharding, At this point just go full changes tbh. 
---
I've always wished add-ons were disabled completely. 
---
Context? New player here.
---
I think I took almost that exact screenshot on my first character.
---
Why even post this here if you know the community is going to reject it outright?
---
That's not how it works, afaik. Are you using all 3 monitors to play WoW across all 3? Cause if that's the case, then that is understandable, but it's not in the scope of the question. He simply wants to have WoW on one monitor and use the other 2 for very not graphics/cpu intensive things.
---
So if an item got reworked in 1.10 do you think that item will be in the game prior to 1.10 or not? If so, will it have its pre-1.10 stats?
---
&gt;Its the only way to do it guys.
---
Nah.
---
&gt; turning off inbox replies cause i know im gonna get flamed. 
---
You flame yourself with pointless posts like this. It'll never happen.
---
Offensive and defensive elixirs to add soon to your world buff thing

I remember there was this bigdick hunter on our server who claimed he could solo Korrak. And then he straight up by kiting it while like 30 of us just ran around keeping horde off his back. 
---
Im good with a $15 a month only sub (no upfront cost).  
---
Ideally, you always are a bit ahead of your group. You are alreasy building threat on the next pack while they are killing off the last mob from previous pull. This gives you more time to build threat, and can allow you to save rage at the end of each pull to dump on the next.
---
True.  I only ever used skull and X to mark first and second focus, and moon for CC, really.  I would just switch skull and X around as the targets died.  But then again, I've never tanked in lvl 60 dungeons so I'm probably not a very good tank.
---
This makes the assumption that people who have stones are not using them for their own skill-ups. 
---
The most popular tank spec at 60 is fury prot and doesnt have points in arms. Its not gimping itself for no reason.
---
I for one would like you to go full straya with c words and slang I've never heard before
---
its got pushback but yes. can use it while moving as well. 
---
I played a priest on horde side in wotlk. Too young for vanilla
---
lets not start that. everyone has their own playstyle. 
---
yeah - my counterpoint to the "post 1.11 AV will not feel like classic" is that as someone who remembers AV still taking fucking forever.. I can guarantee you that you'll still get longass AV battles. 4 days? No probably not, but 4 hours, you bet. 
---
&gt;So, I have options of getting a lvl in 2 hrs played and probably getting bored, OR I can get your lvl in 4 hrs and have a lot of versatile experience and fun. I pick second option, and what is your choice?
---
Option 3: Doing 20-21 in 53 minutes instead :P I know I'm not your target audience but I read anyways, good post. You do you, boo. Have fun, it's your game.
---
you gotta sleep at some point. may as well get that addon that crafts all the items it needs to make other items you queue up and click it off before naptime. 
---
That's mostly a symptom of entry-level dungeons just because the mobs really don't hit that hard and the vast majority of your rage comes from getting hit. You'll notice as dungeons start to get harder that you're not as rage-starved. 
---
The other thing is you need to make sure that you establish aggro on the entire pack right from the start. If any of them start on someone else, you'll miss out on rage from them hitting you making it hard to build threat. It's much easier to *keep* mobs on you than to *get* them on you. For warrior, it's pretty easy to establish aoe aggro; just BS after pulling (with your entire party in range). With 3+ mobs hitting you, you should be getting enough rage to tab-cycle sunders and revenge at minimum. With bigger pulls and/or harder hitting mobs (which come naturally as you level) you get more rage to dump on HS/Cleave in addition. 
---
Additionally, I don't know if you were using Shield Block or not, but it's rarely worth the rage on aoe packs as it will get eaten up immediately and not mitigate enough damage to justify it. It's mostly only useful on hard-hitting single mob packs (where you will have more than enough rage anyway) and bosses (ditto, and it also greatly reduces the chance you'll be crit/crushed which is what makes it so powerful).
---
Funny how you misspelled Peeling the Onion. 
---
That's trippy as hell.. I played with Tipdrill a ton back then. Pretty sure I was the sole provider of your flasks during progression.
---
Did I? I still do!
---
I did screenshoted things like this. I screenshoted a lot.
---
Um, what? The 1.10 version of AV (slightly changed in 1.11 but not significnatly) was the version of AV that persisted all the way to Patch 2.3 in November of 2007.  
---
The reason people were able to rush it so insanely in TBC is because of the TBC talents and class changes. Those changes don't exist in Vanilla and won't in Classic.
---
its not recommended just for the dps, its recommended to give you more things to click on and a way to pull from range. 
---
fuck that escort quest in swamp of sorrows
---
Except for what he just said.
---
In the very patches the UI didn't bind with the 1, 2, 3, ... keys if you were using a French AZERTY keyboard layout. Not by default anyways.
---
I spent months clicking on a single bar. 
---
Thank fuck I wasn't playing a shaman.
---
&gt;the 45min baron run may be a bitch to do without raid gear
---
Nah you just need to be on top of things
---
I guess we were too cocky. When you think of AV and vanilla you think of epic large scale battles not the neutered version where you ignore other players just to nuke a couple bosses so you just kind of think thats how its going to be put into the game. Boy was I wrong. 
---
This satisfies my very specific blueberry stomping fetish ;)

[The real way to play a paladin](https://youtu.be/aX2JEKVn-U4?t=17)
---
You don't want all your Priest slots filled in by Dwarves.  They're only superior to Humans on the fights that have fear mechanics, which are few, and they're being suboptimal on every other fight.  For fights with fear, you should have Warriors that know how to stance dance, you can have your tank and rogues covered with a couple Dwarves, so even then you don't need all your Priests to be Dwarves.
---
Extend that to Human vs Night Elf, what's the difference?  Only 5% Spirit.  I'm sure some scub would stand here and argue that 5% Spirit across a couple Priests is the difference between world first blah blah, that's factually not true.  So now we're talking about a raid that must have a few Dwarves and basically an irrelevant mix of anything else they can get.
---
If you want to be in a hard core guild, does it matter what race of Priest you are as an individual?  Absolutely not.  There will be enough Dwarves and you don't have to be one, because someone else will and the raid won't suffer for it.
---
What’s with the r/colorizedhistory style captioning for every wow screenshot lmfao 
---
&gt; classic Dungeons such as BRD
---
brd was a raid
---
There are plenty of spots where I find #NOCHANGES to be a thoughtless whiny response, but a post like this is the perfect place for it.
---
1) Let the game release as it was, and stay that way in terms of core gameplay design
---
2) You list of desires is basically TBC prot paladin (which is when I first fell in love with paladin tanking myself, so I understand the love for it). Hopefully one day you will get that official Blizzard project.
---
My raid guild on Nost did 20-man ony while still in BWL. It depends on a lot of stuff obviously, but I'd think that if you are at least progressing BWL, 20 man should be able to do it.
---
Lol! I just design systems for permit. When no sales are coming through, I sit here. Probably gonna get written up for "not doing anything"
---
You need to be getting hit. If your dps aren't working with you, you won't be getting hit = not enough rage = can't sunder. If 2-3 elite mobs are hitting you, you'll be able to spam it on cooldown. 
---
But your healer is gonna want to heal that big burst of damage you take when you pull, and that will aggro all mobs = no rage = can't sunder = dps pull ahead in threat and tank the entire fight. So you also need to secure aggro with shouts first thing. 
---
i hope you realize the playstyle of warriors and paladins are completely different right?
---
Its stupid to just tell someone to roll something else when thats not gonna solve the actual problem.
---
They didnt make any mistake after all they announced from the start that classic will be based off of 1.12. People shouldnt be surprised that that AV is going to be 1.12. 
---
Having battlegrounds that last half a day will certainly kill any appeal for AV
---
1) Time-gating content and having content from different patches in the game concurrently are different things in the same way washing your hands and having water coming out of your faucet are different things. I agree they’re different, but if you time gate content by slowly patching in different phases of content, you’re going to end up with content from different patches in the game concurrently. Time gating is the reason, and having concurrent content is the knock on effect.
---
I pointed this out because it demonstrates that there are reasons by which having content from different patches concurrently may be justified. Here’s two good reasons off the top of my head that line up with reasons for time gating content; 1. AV has powerful rewards. The 1.12 version is easy to Zerg which makes getting these rewards much faster. This trivializes AV rewards and non-AV rewards of similar and lesser power. 1.12 was not the version of AV that was available for much of Vanilla. Later on when people had gear from earlier content, it mattered less. 2. AV changed substantially since it’s inception, many versions of it are unavailable for players to experience; versions that are well loved by some of the player base.
---
2) I understand these counter arguments, but class design is something that seeps into every corner of the game and having different versions all at once would require rebalancing numbers and rebalancing every raid encounter, etc. The effects from that sort of mix up would be of a different magnitude. There’s also no real benefit to it other than fun. 
---
Just because 1.12 is the starting point for the systems, doesn’t mean all systems have to be at 1.12. Designers realize this which is why certain content is time gated. Alterac valley may well fall into this category.
---
Stones tend to give upgrades for like 10-15 levels as a primary source. A BS might use 20 Heavy Stones from 125-139 for Heavy Weightstones, etc - but then what? ores are needed over stones like 3:1 or more for a lot of crafts, so there's often a surplus.
---
I loved it and had planned on playing it a lot. Now the games will last 20 minutes max its pointless there is no fun or large scale epic battles to be had when both sides just ignore eachother. 
---
Whats funny is you guys wont even play the BG anymore after getting your items from it. Ok got my sweet item in 5 hours of playing AV wont ever go there again. Whilst we also are not going there. 
---
The 1.10/11 version of AV was the persistent version all the way to November 2007, except for allow for a new 61-70 bracket. The class changes in TBC had more to do with the 5-minute rushing than the 1.10 changes. Then in November 2007 it all got blown up and reinforcements were added and the experience forever changed.
---
"Need to farm some quick rep" is the antithesis of vanilla. That shouldn't be the goal classic is built upon. Why are we catering to the people who are going to rush through the content rather than the ones who are going to stick around on the servers long-time?
---
*long comment about being WORRIED for you* &lt;— FUCK that guy
---
Also mods: DM won't be available at release.
---
My comment here was meant to be a joke reply to my earlier comment, about needing to go for a shit every hour 
---
That's not god thats just the original wow devs
---
BlackRock spire was. BlackRock depths as of spring 2006 was a 5 man.
---
It’s highly recommended for your health to step away from your computer every 30 minutes
---
For me it was so epic because you were fighting for your homeground - as a dwarf who loves the dwarven aesthetic, their architecture, the rams, etc, it was so dope to be up in these beautiful snow peaks and stone towers, and every class had a different fantasy to play out. For example, obviously rogues and ferals would infamously sneak around and try to cap stuff. Hunters had ample room to kite, to shoot from vantage points, towers, etc. Paladins and warriors were 100% in their element on the front line, just causing so much carnage and stalling their death for as long as possible. Ranged casters could pull crazy DPS on multiple targets from the backline, and when you did get that rare dedicated healer, it felt so awesome - we would stack 3 healers on our most geared warrior and just send him in and watch him kill everything. 
---
It was an environment that was so robust and fulfilling that you didn't mind being stuck in it for a few hours.
---
I would say world buffs removed for the first month or two of new raids. I think worldbuffing on non-progression is fine.
---
But yes x3
---
Mostly cause it lowers your TPS by A LOT. Its threat/rage is pretty bad, plus unless you have tactical mastery (which a lot of warriors won't take for while during the leveling process) the effective rage cost is even higher to do the stance swap. If you need the mitigation, it's often a better to solution to use more cc, either to kite or to effectively make the pull smaller.
---
Hell. I'm up to THREE sent emails now. I'll take that promotion too!
---
Do I hear MOAR DOTS!?
---
They said they were holding the items introduced in 1.10 back until they release content at that point. They aren’t changing items that were changed in 1.10 but were in before. They are staying 1.12 stars.
---
It would be far too much work and not accurate at all to have things change based on different patches. They don’t have the data. And even if they did *it would be too confusing for the player base*.
---
It’s 1.12. That’s it. All you people need to just realize that and get over it. You are all just hopping from one issue to the next to bitch about because all you remember from vanilla is really private server bs.
---
Don't buy a 3 year old graphics card
---
If you want to raid, expect to tank at least a little. If you want to get into dungeons when you have crap gear, expect to tank it. Because if not, the tank will likely not allow you in a group just to roll against his gear.
---
I’m not going to spend the last 10 minutes before I sleep allowing my character to afk /s
---
T'was merely a jest.
---
Have fun! See you in Azeroth!
---
Man you people keep moving the goal post on what you meant #nochanges to be.
---
Also, a druid vs. Druid fight with literally last forever because neither one of them could out DPS the other healing. Plus, you know, we're all cool with each other and all that shit
---
Ive heard skinning and herbing for gold
---
They said they were using 1.12 as a starting point and were open on discussion about the player limit on certain dungeons, why not this? And considering how iconic old AV is to both vanilla and fans of the game, it seems like kind of a non-brainer to include it. This is a decision they made based on conserving resources.
---
There's a big difference between getting up and about several times an hour while flying, up and stretching while autorunning, etc and taking a 10 minute shit once an hour. I can stay active (and will actually have a [bike desk](https://i.imgur.com/6HdhWdM.jpg) available during my launch week extravaganza.) while still having 0 downtime to craft. Can't craft on that 4 minute flight from A to B, but I can get up and walk to refill my water and let the dogs out.
---
“Everyone wanted 1.12”? I might accept that most people wanted 1.12 class design and the whole roster of content that existed through 1.12, but I’ve seen virtually no-one saying that 1.12 AV is their first preference.
---
If you want to argue that we can’t pick and choose pieces of multiple patches, that’s already happening. We’re getting old itemization in the initial content rollout, for example.
---
If you ever decide that you'd like to sell it give me a shout.  :)
---
&gt;shaman gear not dropping for alliance and likewise paladin gear for horde
---
This won't be a problem on classic because it was "fixed" within vanilla. 
---
Elemental  and enhance aren't meant to be good raid dps, so stop trying. They are good everywhere else.
---
Slap on healer gear and stop worrying about doing a role that a shaman isn't mean to do in one tiny facet of the game. The specs are fine in instances, pvp, and solo.  Use them there.
---
Probably because Engineering is the BiS profession for both PvP and Pve
---
I genuinely prefer the unarmored version, because I only find the troll updated mounts pleasing. The dumb glowy blue eyes and huge spiked collars are just dumb in my opinion.
---
I really like the arctic wolf in the warcraft movie, because it's looking so plain. 
---
The palomino horse looks much better than the armored horses embalmed in plate armour!
---
It's amazing how difficult #nochanges appears to be to grasp as a concept. It sounds like you're just looking for someone to be angry at. 
---
Google the items. It’s part of a straight-forward, albeit time-consuming quest chain that is repeatable.
---
Dang... I've been playing since TBC and I didn't even know these were a thing until blizzcon 2017. Wish I could get a hold on one... I just look at ebay and the only 2 on there are $1.5k and $4k...
---
I think this is Blizzards idea too, Problem is you push people like myself who couldn't give a shit about the rewards (ill find something elsewhere im sure) away from playing the 20 minute rush games. I cant play zerg AV anymore I really really cant. 
---
Yes, I am raiding with one twice a week. I don't think I can link in here without rustling som mod jimmies, but try and google "theprotdream" or "mowsenlel" and you can check out his streams. 
---
Also I don't think main tanking works that well for paladins because their single target threat is quite low and they run out of mana. They are decent OTs though depending on the bosses. Obviously tank swaps are just about impossible but they can take an add and then switch to healing once it's dead. 
---
Warriors are so OP as hell in vanilla and it's really annoying. Even the leveling experience can be made much better by kiting instead of just taking the damage. 
---
As for talents I think they should use the 1.0 talents instead. It will make the game much more balanced and it will also bring something new for team private server.
---
Damn. I played vanilla/BC and some of WOTLK on a PVE server, started checking out RP servers and finally transferred my main to Wyrmrest Accord just before cata, I think. WrA did not seem as bad overall as you describe at that point - though I haven't played much for the past couple years so maybe it got worse? Or maybe it was just worse on RP-PVP servers?  Last time I was on, there was still some decent RPing going on (both Alliance and Horde), and the trolls/OOC morons hadn't totally taken over.. I was still reporting usernames. Perhaps things will be better in Classic.
---
I've only done napkin math for skinning, but from what I've got so far, I'd rather not skin that mob and use that 3 seconds to move onto the next fight. Paladins don't really need the gold.
---
The ironic thing is 99% of people never played Vanilla Retail and still want to have an opinion on how it should be run.
---
I did, and you can shove week long AV's up your fucking ass. Just because something is old doesn't mean it's better.
---
Why cant we? I need to do something I leave the BG someone else takes my place. Thats how it worked back then too... 
---
Even on pserver with lots of neckbeards unarmored mounts were not often seen, because you had to grind to 60 and grind 1000g within 3months of the server launch in order to obtain one. 
---
Need four months? You get the updated version. It really is not that easy.
---
This, large scale clashes are generally decided in under a minute
---
How be bad at Rogue dps? Keep slice and dice up, keep poison on, rest is whatever. Its easy.
---
No matter how many of these polls I see, I still love them every time.
---
With that said, if there's really only one Hunter per every 10 players 3 months into Classic, I will spread BBQ sauce on my keyboard and eat it live on Twitch.
---
For a holy paladin that never PVPs. Meh.
---
Aren't most people this time 'round gonna use a cast bar addon to detect actual casting tho?
---
The number of posts I've seen unironically arguing something to the effect of "old AV only seems cool Because Nostalgia" *on the WoW Classic subreddit* is truly astounding.
---
in general it is true that balancing would cause a domino effect to balance everything else.
---
However that is not always true..
---
Buffing a ret paladin is not going to suddenly make them OP. As long as the devs are not so generous with the buffs, ret would be viable for raids.
---
Think you can play on intel integrated graphics tbh
---
For sure, and that'll help a good bit, but the quickest players aren't going to always be looking to reference the healing hands with the spell being cast
---
Purely DPS-wise, sure, warrior will be better. But OP stated he didn't want to tank.
---
Woo I bought a sit/stand adjustable desk.  
---
Not for my health really, but just because my tail bone starts hurting like massive bad after sitting for awhile.  
---
Contributing nothing to the discussion and just restating what I said we all already in the main body.
---
From a guy with only vaque memories: I've read the patchnote changes for AV during vanilla, but what did these changes changed? Did the game lenght went from 2 days to 2 hours? Was it taking this long because the NPC's were harder? Did it became to eazy?
---
Some insight in what exactly changed in how people played and felt about AV would be intresting for me.
---
Sorry buddy but if you make jokes, you're not a true WoW players. True WoW players don't make jokes.  
---
True WoW players don't poop either.  
---
Now that you mention it. I should have screen shot a few things.
---
Wow, I didn't expect to listen to the whole thing, but that was enjoyable.
---
What is the next class in the Ask Kevin segment, and when is it happening?
---
It’s the blue post stickied in the front page 
---
Be a real Chad and take the Ice Barded Spear like the rest of the hunters wearing spirit leather becasue it makes us look a bit like a ninja assassin!
---
The math is in its the best.
---
Thanks so much for listening, I really appreciate it! Next week will be Druid or Shaman, I have both recorded already.
---
Well done, citizen of Azeroth.
---
&gt;When AV launched, I thought it was kind of overwhelming.  A lot of the areas, tasks, and NPCs felt superfluous or annoying
---
Which is to say, it felt like a proper world zone, which in classic meant an abundance of stuff that was not specifically linked to a linear progression of some kind. The areas, tasks, and NPCs were superfluous and annoying -- but if you go to classic Azshara, that's how the zone was -- a massive expanse of really cool creatures and mobs and a couple easter eggs and random shit to do, but most of it wasn't tied to a linear quest chain. 
---
But I think pre-steamlined pre 1.8 AV would actually work really well now. Back in 2004, it was a shitshow because most people had no idea what to do, no idea how to play their class, no idea how to do anything but run into the front line, die, and repeat. It was up to maybe a core group of 5-10 smart individuals to win the BG while 30v30 just smashed face. I mean, half the people were probably playing on 2 FPS. People didn't understand the concept of a tank needing to hold aggro on the boss, or some people needing to defend against rogue ninjaing GYs, or anything like that. If people did and if people played old AV with the habits and tactics that most WoW players should understand in 2019, I think it would have played much better. 
---
Much, much worse than two.
---
Arthas really was the best server.
---
I think the difference is that you have some sort of inner drive that I don't possess. I do *some* calculations for the game and I have my own spreadsheet, but you have boundless energy for the pursuit.  
---
Me? I just got off work like an hour ago and I'm gonna take a nap in a bit.   
---
I think the difference is if things go south (hunter pet agros for example) a great healer has a chance to save the group but a tank can really only sit there and take a beating while making sure to hold threat.  
---
I agree, on average a tanks job is more demanding but when things are going poorly, or it is a hard instance, a healer can have much more of an impact. 
---
Also depends on the situation. A lot of raid bosses in vanilla you could have a one fingered Luddite tank - basically they are a sum of their gear, whereas in some dungeons you need a really sharp tank to manage threat across multiple mobs and dumb dps. 
---
I healed vanilla - bfa. I tanked BC to cata. My personal opinion is that you need to know the instances, understand massive damage dumps on yourself, and watch for peeling threat as a tank. As a healer you need to watch for peeling threat, incoming (future) damage across all players, know other classes cool downs (for heal prioritization) and know the instance (what you can dispel, what mobs front load damage etc). 
---
I tend to agree that healing has a higher top end skill cap but on average the tank is the most demanding job in the group. 
---
Encrusted Tail Fins.  
---
It's also a slight bit of future proofing. While we dont know what the future holds and I definitely prefer if they just leave things alone... IF years down the road, balance changes decide to be made, I can be ready to play my dream class. But knowing what it's like at 60 is why i'm going to be maining Warlock and not Shaman.
---
You nailed it here. I'm seriously asking because I haven't played on the new client. Looks like I might be overdoing it a bit. ;) good to know.
---
The good news for me is that Elemental does just fine making other casters cry in dungeons and blowing up characters in pvp.
---
All I need out of it. ;)
---
They can be upset, just not about this. It's exactly what they kept asking for for like a year straight. 
---
Nope, I'm going to pick highly populated PVP server as meeting enemies or allies in distress is also an addition to "relaxing from grind" :D
---
Yeah I run m+ a lot and we always chat and have fun
---
They do not run old AV on private servers as it is the full 1.12 map, which is due to that they can't access any older iterations of the map without re-build/tune their core around an older version of the game. What has been done on one of the cores that is popular is close to complete guesswork, does it mimick the feeling of the old map to some degree? Sure. Does it have the correct database values, inputs, npcs, scripts, spawns, patrols, items (e.g. all-seeing eye, shredders) etc? No, just like how Dustwallow is missing entire parts of the zone spawn points and how the Gnomeregan entrence lacks everything from scripted evacuees to standard mob pathing (random, patrols, emotes etc).    
---
Hell, prior to was it as far as 1.11 or 1.12 you were even required to form your own groups within battlegrounds which I'm sure has alot to do with the mentality changing. Some players joined and grouped up in smaller groups and did quest objectives or solo raids they thought funny, whilst others formed larger raid groups and zerged (20-25 players tops). Imaging trying to coordinate anything really through the general chat with several ongoing AV matches, let alone after the initial zerg either died, got delayed or simply got naturally separated.
---
Tell that to the arctic wolf. It's probably the best looking mount in vanilla WoW.[https://www.wowhead.com/item=12351/horn-of-the-arctic-wolf](https://www.wowhead.com/item=12351/horn-of-the-arctic-wolf)
---
Like he said, you'll have literally dozens of levels to git gud at tanking.  The whole point of the climb to 60 is to enjoy the game and figure out how it works/socialize with others.  You don't need tanking school. 
---
Actually 3 monitors are splitting the calculating power of whatever happening on them on gpu. So if i have a movie playing on one, a semi requiring flash game going on a second, and third playing wow.. Dude, just do your math, your research and then speak please. Wow doesnt struggle if i am alone in the wild fighting monsters, go to ogrimar, about 40 people its down to 25 frames. 
---
Just hook up your third monitor and then run all the errands then please tell.
---
This. For those in the know.
---
&gt; For vanilla I would say that dogshit troll bones/necklace or whatever quest in southern STV, where you need like 25 and theyhave 1-5% droprate.
---
Worst experience of my questing history.  
---
The Relics of Wakening can be pretty awful, depending on the party
---
This quest was bad enough that on one character, I incorporated dying as part of my strategy to finish it.  
---
If asking for 1.12 with no changes means something else than an unchanged 1.12 then yeah, it's really fucking difficult to grasp and you should've been a lot clearer.
---
I asked for a frankenpatch and layed out exactly which parts of which patches I wanted but I guess that's too much work since it can't be covered with a hashtag. 
---
Exactly. I loved old AV, but I honestly probably wouldn't play it today. Been there, done that, I can't do 4 hr BGs or 14 hr BGs for that matter. But that's not a reason to deny the classic advocates what they have been wanting; people fell in love with classic WoW despite its flaws and warts, and AV was a part of that just as much as, say, attunement quests or insane rep grinds. 1.12 AV is not the classic AV that people fell in love with.
---
Maybe players should have made a fuss before the game was set to release in just a few months. I'm sure people would've bitched and moaned about 3 day long fucking AVs.
---
They're releasing content like that for a reason, so people don't blast content as hard as they potentially could have. It will still get blasted but this way it stays relevant longer.
---
Trust the people that are in charge of this game are more capable at making this game than you and I, stupid complaints like this make it feel like we're playing retail. 
---
Azka?! You were my GM in Spiritmoon during vanilla and part of BC until we changed to Sunburn and eventually Lazy Town. I was our offtank through all of BC (dwarf warrior) until I had to stop playing when we downed Illidan. You guys eventually transferred when they launched the Latin American servers. 
---
TBC was my favorite era of the game, but WotLK, especially the middle of the expansion, is my second favorite. Classic is nice, but every class was so much more fleshed out in TBC/WotLK. I also liked the professions and PvP better in both TBC and WotLK. 
---
As other have said,  I wouldn’t bring a dps warrior unless we were already friends (or I need absolutely nothing from the dungeon).  Hard enough to get all the gear you need as a warrior to then roll off for it.
---
Wasn't there a strawpoll that shows the majority wants 1.12?
---
LOL m2 
---
Its not specifcly about the time its about the fun, 20 minute games are not fun becasue each side will walk right past eachother dont bother with towers dont bother with NPC's just run to the first boss then run to the second. 
---
&gt;The AV's could last a couple hours if people force them too
---
No. No AV will last hours unless I guess you have a 40 man horde and ally premade and they both agreed that everything needs to die before they fight the boss or something but good luck. 
---
World PvP is wank, You nuke a bunch of low levels before you get outnumbered 5 minutes later, Thats some real PvP right there. 
---
The gear is gated behind the content, You can still get the gear. As it stands AV is dead on arrival after everyone has their gear and mount in a single day from 5 hours of AV rushes you will never touch the place again right? That seems to be most peoples thought process. So you are willing to kill an entire part of the game to get a quick easy epic weapon? We have two very different mind sets. 
---
More like a teenager finally letting go of mommy's hand and exploring a vast and inviting world better than the one they were in previously.
---
It's happening folks. The past is our future. Love the flash forward. 
---
Burning legion?? I was on Horde and remember seeing you guys!! I was in Keepers of the Shadow.
---
SIDA bag
---
Much less chance though. 
---
What even is the modern equivalent that is not unneccessarily expensive?
---
Okey :) 
---
But that lack of balance is part of classic wow. Yes, I'm sure it was a nightmare to balance, just like classes and raids and every other system was impossible to balance. Classic WoW had severely imbalanced aspects and there were clear ways to do things in ways the devs didn't intend. But that is the whole point of classic -- to give players these experiences in their unbalanced glory. For example, Naxx was honestly horribly balanced to just be way unfun and overpunishing and hard in gear check-y ways, with trash packs that were incredibly obnoxious, etc. But it is what it is, and people want classic Naxx, so they deserve to get it. Same concept with AV. 
---
Does this mean part of you would love if Earth was destroyed by a large cosmic object?
---
&gt; for both PvP and PvE
---
Yep. That was what I was tryin' to meme at. It's not impossible for a warlock to reliably bet undead, its just slightly more frustrating.
---
you could pick up smoking just for this and take a smoke break every hour
---
Oh ic so it's for repeatable exp and rep?
---
No one said give us 1.12.1 and only 1.12.1
---
People wanted Vanillia and old av is a big part of it. Everyone has epic AV warstories except for the people who started playing in 1.12.1 and onwards. 
---
A fun time playing what you want!
---
Really? That’s awesome....I was slightly more “casual” than most the other raiders but this fight was super fun/frustrating 
---
People would complain about anything, sure. How does that make people agitating for content in their preferred form unreasonable in any way? What, exactly, is so stupid about these comments?
---
Also, players *were* making a fuss about it earlier - the version of AV to be used came up frequently in any thread about AV on the Classic forums - and BGs are going to be post-release in Classic, so there’s more than “a few months” to go.
---
I’m for real excited to wipe 100 times on the first MC pull.  Leading up to cthun again is a dream.
---
Ummm ok? Is what I suggested impossible or?..
---
??
---
I can level it at 60 if I need it. All these guides recommend it **for the purpose of leveling**.
---
That’s way less efficient than just ran targetting and sundering each mob, unless you have a Mage AoE burning them down. Battleshout’s threat is split amongst all enemies, so 5 mobs are only getting like 57 threat each. I’ll usually go in rotation and sunder each once, then taunt or concussive blow skull, and sunder each once again. At that point you want to just focus skull until it’s dead. It’s definitely more work, but I feel it’s worth it. 
---
I wish I was in Aenigma, I wasn’t on their level at the time. I remember you guys and Og, I’d run away if I ever ran across you guys in the open world XD 
---
Would you also advocate for 30-60 minute raids then?
---
Lost screen shot but I jumped my way to the top of some hut in ORG and it had a shadowed corner, Be a troll do the slav squat eyes all aglowing and shit only seeing 1 and a half troll feet a faint outline of a quiff of purple hair and glowing eyes. I thought I was a fucking genius becasue id become Batman, Left that character stood there doing nothing for ages. 
---
Only if it resembles a foot. Perhaps the turtle that holds the world on its back drops the world and accidentally steps on it. That's what I call a good death.
---
I mean I'm going to do all those things, but not as I go.  Hit 60 then get professions going.
---
Yeah, it all depends what you’re running and who’s in the party. If you ever get the honor of tanking UBRS, you want green at the ready for hibernation. And DM:N has packs of elemental that you want banish for (but with good pulling you can fight them no more than 2 at a time).
---
A Vanilla version yes. We already have changes nochanges is dead so why not this change to massively improve AV?
---
I wonder if Ragehoof got what they were looking for?
---
It just means AV is pointless outside of farming the gear and mount and once people have those they will never go back. 
---
Paladin
---
I'll likely have every class at 60 for alts 
---
This one hits home. I did several of these with my character saying things like:"Uuhh guys, how long do I have to sit here?"
---
who cares
---
100% I would, but that's entirely up to the raiders and takes a ton of hard work and dedication. That's top tier hardcore guild stuff right there and I'm not going to be putting that kind of pressure on myself this go around.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Normal raiders take about 1-3 hours to clear the raids up to Naxx, which is imo around the sweet spot for the amount of time &amp; reward. I've always burned out before Naxx but heard it takes quite a bit longer, but that's fair because it also drops the best items in all of vanilla.
---
I'm a little torn on this personally.

Per the [forbes interview](https://www.forbes.com/sites/hnewman/2018/01/30/classic-servers-cats-and-cute-things-the-world-of-warcraft-interview/#f047b9e51344), 
---
&gt;If you think about—there were two years in between the launch of World of Warcraft and the release of [the expansion] Burning Crusade. A lot of things changed in there. What should we shoot for?
---
&gt;My favorite example for this is Upper Blackrock Spire. There was a 10-person version and a five-person version for most of that two-year period, but toward the end we decided, nope, UBRS is going to be a five-person and we’re going to retune it to be appropriate for that. Is that the right decision? I don’t know. These are the types of questions. There’s lots of questions like that that we’ll be talking with the community about.
---
Other than being wrong about the person count of UBRS, this comment communicated to me that we may be getting a "frankenpatch" of sorts, a mesh of all of them, but, this article was published on Jan 30th of 2018 (god, it's been that long?). Let's look a more recent piece of communication. 
---
&gt;The first—and among the most important—decision we had to make was which version of the game to focus on. As many of you have noted, the classic period was two years long and full of changes. Core features like Battlegrounds were introduced in patches after WoW’s original launch, and class design similarly changed over time. After careful consideration, we decided on Patch 1.12: Drums of War as our foundation, because it represents the most complete version of the classic experience.
---
[Source](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/21881587/dev-watercooler-world-of-warcraft-classic)
---
Now, I'm still read that as it's worded, they're using 1.12 as the "foundation", that didn't necessarily mean that we were getting 1.12 out right, they were just using that in terms of itemization (items as they were in 1.12, loot, etc.), but things were still up for discussion. 
---
My believing things were still up for discussion is further reinforced by the 6 phased content release discussion, here
---
&gt;Along the way, we’ve taken a close look at items that provide the biggest power gains, many of which were introduced in 1.10 as part of a sweeping dungeon itemization pass. That patch was when Tier 0.5 gear was introduced, and Relics were added to the drop tables of many bosses. It also adjusted drop rates and drop locations of a lot of gear (to make room for the Relics). We’ve gone back and reconstructed many of the most heavily affected drop tables as they existed prior to the 1.10 patch, and we’re planning to update the drop tables alongside the Ahn’Qiraj War Effort. Prior to the Ahn’Qiraj unlock, most of the drop rates and locations will look as they did in the patches prior to 1.10, with exceptions—there are lots of little changes made in earlier patches that don’t have a big effect on player power, and in those cases, we’re planning to use the 1.12 drop rates and locations.
---
&gt;One example of the many items we’re planning for is: Titanic Leggings, which is a world drop that first appeared in 1.10. We can confirm that it will be controlled by the same content unlock that restricts the other 1.10 loot changes.
---
&gt;Phase 5
---
&gt;Ahn’Qiraj War Effort begins
---
&gt;Ahn’Qiraj raids open when the war effort dictates
---
&gt;**Dungeon loot reconfiguration: Tier 0.5 Dungeon gear, Relics, drop rates and location changes**
---
[Source](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/classic-content-plan/120346)
---
With all this said (sorry, the post got away from me) I think that many of us thought, and rightfully so, that there was still room for discussion in regards to AV, seeing how the shortened version they plan to release seeing how the version in 1.12 was only in vanilla for son long (since patch 1.10, right?). 
---
If you think even with 10 minute avs you will get exalted in 5 hours of release you really have no concept of vanilla. So uhm you think whatever you want bud I'll make sure to tag you in every post bitching about how long avs take cause of turtling on release
---
Just rep and free herbs after the initial turn-in
---
Yea I was sitting there one day trying to ask myself why Retail is so much worse then classic. Even though in so many ways it's objectively better. Then I remembered something my dad said to me as a kid. He used to travel as a diesel tech for the U.S. navy. Well he used to get sent to Hawaii for 2 months at a time twice a year. One day I said man I am jealous I bet you love it out there. Get to spend 4 months a year in paradise. 
---
He just looked at me and said alone. I get to spend four months a year alone. Paradise doesn't mean anything when everyone you care about is two thousand miles away. That always stuck with me. It also fits retail very well. Your alone in paradise.  
---
Interesting, did these "purists" get a confirmed "no changes" servers? If not then its a thread both for you and them.
---
Human or dwarf rogue?? I love having pvp advantages but like being top in pve dps as well. Animation wise i like both. I dont really care about character models, i prefer performance over cosmetics. 
---
I'm just tired of people complaining about a game that's 14 years old. Just because people were 10 years old when it came out doesn't mean they have to go back being a whiney child. I want this, that, blah blah.
---
In my mind since they have said what patch AV is being built on, I'm guessing they've already put it in the works. 
---
Prot paladins are already the only tank that can reliably aoe tank. They just suck donkey dick at single target, aka let them have their niche. Every class being able to do everything as well as everyone else is one of the many things wrong with retail.
---
Nah drek, just rush to the base with mounts, thats it.
---
DIre Maul not available. You’ll be using that bad boy into MC 
---
I found spriest utility combined with their scalability means gear isn’t quite as important for other classes when it comes to PVP.  For example, a warrior or rogue with crappy weapons is a total dud. Shadow priests without a ton of spell power are still extremely dangerous, the fight just lasts longer. 
---
I raided to aq40 (one of the lucky ones that got to raid as shadow) and did PVP up to lt cmdr in vanilla. PvP was awesome and I felt like I was dangerous even in lesser gear. Just be prepared to fully utilize all abilities on a priest - levitate, mind control, mama burn, Downranking swp if fighting another priest or pally that is dispelling, etc etc. In a raid I was warlock utility and dispels at best though. 
---
I distinctly remember dying way too much at the Defias mobs stationed outside of Deadmines. They were packed pretty close to each and had a fairly fast respawn rate, and any more than 1 or 2 mobs aggro’d was certain death. Those quests were a pain but I’m looking forward to it. 
---
The cd is every 10 mins :) 
---
Chill mate I just said OK. Here's a defenition of okay:
---
"OK" (spelling variations include "okay", "O.K.", "ok") is an American English word denoting approval, acceptance, agreement, assent, acknowledgment.
---
Didn't come up with anything else, as I thought OK, maybe you are right.
---
We aren't here to attack one another, classic ain't released as of yet, even though you seem to be of the Horde with that attitude. I'm a Dwarf btw. 
---
So you mean after its too late to change anything? Did you think before tryping that?
---
Yeah fuck Call of Water I do that after I get my first mount. 
---
We clear everything fine in 1 hour, why should the tank spend hundreds golds on consumables that aren't needed ?
---
Finreaver, nice.
---
Sykomike I like your attitude
---
Huh didn't expect that answer. I guess my next question is, why do you want to play classic wow then? It seems like modern wow is exactly what you're looking for, especially with things like LFR that let you breeze through raids as fast as possible.
---
Regarding AV, I think a few days is a good amount of time, because I vastly prioritize the fun of the battleground over quick cheap rewards. Winning a 2 day long battle is a reward in itself. Grinding rep will never give you that sense of accomplishment.
---
Also an extra thought: I think it would be awesome to have month long battles, but that would have to be in a different game.
---
There is no fucking way the people working on this did not understand what people mean by "Old AV"
---
We’ve all sat in that seat at least once. 
---
Except he is completely wrong.  The original vanilla client is very undemanding and runs well on old hardware. The Legion/BFA client is more demanding, even if you turn down the graphics to Classic levels.    
---
If you have tried to run all the versions of the WoW client for each expansion on a weaker machine, you can see the original vanilla client is very lightweight and runs quite well on PCs with integrated graphics, etc.  
---
There is no way the Classic client will be as lightweight and run as well on older machines or machines with integrated GPUs.    
---
It's not necessarily a bad thing, and it doesn't mean all older machines won't be able to Classic.  
---
If anyone tries the vanilla client (which you can get and use easily today), you can see the program is small and has very low requirements by todays standards. The requirements of Classic will be higher than what you need to run the original vanilla client.    
---
You can also see the graphics on old vanilla is quite low at the lowest settings. It's likely that the Classic graphics will still be an upgrade, even if they used old/simpler textures, etc.  Blizzard is not going to recreate the graphics exactly, and vanilla will have lower graphics than classic (except for textures and possibly some other aspects).
---
engineers need them too. what makes you think you would be the only person in the world looking for them?
---
I kind of Blizzard does some balance changes or minor tweaks to subpar specs. It’s going to get boring fast if everyone is playing the same handful of specs the whole time. I know this doesn’t answer your question OP, just wanted to vent a bit. 
---
They are both around the middle now. The sample size likely wasn't big enough yet.
---
Empty realms were a thing even in vanilla. Some people prefer smaller servers. It will all even out. I also wouldn’t be averse to the option of server transfers from smaller servers to higher pop servers in the event this happens. 
---
&gt; I found the demo client ran much better than the original Vanilla client did on my admittedly very modern PC. 
---
How did the vanilla client not run well? Did it seem unoptimized?
---
But we are not getting 1.12.1 becasue not all raid and dungeon content will be released from day 1...
---
We have perma sharding and the ninja loot helper system in too. Changes have happend and they were bad so why not make a single change thats good?
---
There have been no confirmations of "no changes"
---
Why bother with First Aid when you can heal yourself?
---
If you have to progress through MC you are doing it wrong.
---
As with the itemization, we've already seen that the 1.12 foundation doesn't mean that everything will be as-is circa 1.12. It's just a foundation, because adding/removing/changing things from the 1.12 foundation always made way more technical sense than trying to do the same with 1.1, 1.5, etc.
---
As for how tiring you find these things; since when has any game not had impassioned discussion about how it should be? How is *any* of this unexpected? More to the point, if you find it tiring, why are you even participating in threads like these at all? Is it just to fire self-superior scattershot comments?
---
Neither there were for "pro changes". Which means that i can come here and disagree with you.
---
They definitely will not work.  Different game version, different API calls enabled/disabled.  Addons for retail wow are more likely to work than your pserver ones.
---
I am laughing way too hard reading this at work. This was amazing.
---
Does anyone in the raid use any consumables at all? The main tank is the first place the guild should be spending money to increase effectiveness.
---
What about time saved from using the Transporter to Gadgetzan? 
---
Could someone eli5 me on what 1.12 AV is compared to 1.12?
---
I thought about making a post for a shot like that I have.
---
I think i'll share it here instead

Trying so hard not to laugh out loud at work at this comment lmao.

But I really want an ivory raptor for my troll priest anyway.
---
Totally agree, original timeline would be great
---
Problem is he said it himself he wont be playing it unless its on the specific weeekend so why design it for him? 1.12.1 turns AV into a giant loot pinatia. 
---
The issue is clashing between the people looking to just play and enjoy the game their way or people looking to rush to max rank best gear asap. 
---
I dont care about long games and leaving if I need to without a reward since its a game and im here to play for fun where as they dont care about other people having fun as long as they can rush the epics and never return to the BG. AV will be dead after a month.

Looking at your stats, pala/shaman is at 13% and it's only druids who will be under represented. 
---
Prediction: fuck no.
---
They've already stated they want to keep the two games as seperate entities.
---
Top kek
---
changing the "get crit for x" talents to "get hit for x" would not endanger class identity in any way.
---
the taunt though, i can see that being an erosion of identity but only an absurdly slight erosion given that it was never something that only warriors could do. 
---
i can see warriors and druids cry foul about the soaking mana from heals being a copy of rage and therefore eroding tank identity... but bears and warriors have rage already so it is at most as slight an erosion as taunt. 
---
You can use the number pad to type the number you’d like to split off of the original stack. Might save you some time?

---
Not sure why, but I found that hilarious. 
---
Everyone would just keep the unarmored ones.
---
I run WoW on a MacBook and it doesn't get that hot. Maybe you should turn down some of the graphics - or at least know that with graphics are turn down, the game should run a lot better (like during raids).
---
&gt;actually good
---
If youre actually good then youd realize that everyone is trying to bait your kick, and you wait until the end of the cast

I'm building my wife an raised bed no dig garden this weekend so I can keep her occupied all summer. Plus when she asks me for something I'll just point at the box 
---
This is WoW.
---
The original AV had both teams working to kill Korrak because that was the objective to get the ice barbed spear and bloodseeker crossbow.  So that made games last a little bit longer to start.  
---
Each objective was extremely fortified with hard hitting NPCs that required teamwork to take out.  Once they were removed, people had only the opposing team defending the base/objectives.
---
Defending in AV felt like you were in a tower defense/zombie game.  You had to protect choke points and use all your slows on the people invading.  Not everyone enjoyed this gameplay.  It was my personal favorite aspect of the entire game.
---
hot take
---
Small world. My first character was on Burning Legion and I remember thinking how cool all of the Aenigma guys were lol. I played with the guild Silver... Legends I think? It's been a while. Thanks for posting!
---
You can't always do this with downranks of spells, and iirc interrupts aren't off global, meaning if you just hit an ability and I start healing after, you're going to have to mash your interrupt to get it off in time. But agreed, a very good opponent will let the cast go on before interrupting 
---
Been a BDK since wrath. Tanking is the only enjoyable role I like so I’m going with Prot warrior. I’ll be leveling with a warlock. I know warrior is slow to level, but if I’m grinding with another dps, what’s the best spec to level as if I want to tank dungeons along the way? 
---
Thanks in advance. 
---
Ok I hope we'll get "screenshot of the day" section again.
---
Levelling as balance Druid makes the switch to resto at the end pretty seamless. 
---
Shadow priest is great at PvP. 
---
My friend uses an external monitor (television), wireless keyboard/mouse to use his laptop for gaming.
---
As long as you are not at risk of burning the thing out, might be a good budget option.
---
neat.
---
It can and should be both. Some people like videos, you can be a passive consumer of information vs an active consumer.
---
Was this on the Bloodlust battlegroup?
---
&gt; People have made many comparisons and have seen that the demo client is even easier to run than 1.12. 
---
Pretty sure this is not true.  Unfortunately, many of those people were testing both clients at high graphics settings.  
---
The vanilla client on low graphics settings is much easier to run than the demo. The requirements are very low. Classic will have higher minimum requirements and demand more - **if** you are comparing both clients on low or lowest settings.  
---
Vanilla is incredibly lightweight and undemanding on lower settings, and easily runs on computers with integrated graphics, for example.   
---
If you have a source for a good test of both client running on lowest settings, can you link to it?
---
What was your preferred resto talent build?
---
Ranged pulling is useful for pulling a single mob or two without risking entering the aggro range of other mobs. Doesn't Judgement have a shorter range?
---
As somebody else said, queue up a bunch of them to craft at once when you need to afk, then it doesn't add to your time played.
---
Lastly, your math re: having to take 10 minutes every hour to craft might incorrectly assume you will be pulling with dynamite literally every pull when in all likelihood you will not be using it for most pulls.
---
This is WoW classic you can play the game on a potatoe with a keyboard attached. Even Russians can afford it now.

Luckily for you Joana is making an Alliance leveling guide.

Damage meter but no threat meter. On a fight with a threat reset. Yep sounds about rogue. 
---
You don't at all need to use ESC to cancel a spell. You can move or use space.  
---
If your buddy swaps to a class with a heal y’all would destroy everything 
---
That's what i wanted to say except for your first part
---
Why can't you use wifi?  You are trying to get the speed of a wired connection?
---
Because when people talk about "old AV" they are not talking about 1.12.1 and Blizzard **KNOW IT**. They have made many many changes like sharding, staggering dungeon and raid releases and the loot ninja helper feature none of which are 1.12.1 yet they keep the worst version of AV there? Suspect for sure.  
---
If they only have that version like the only backup they found in the office was 1.12.1 and they cant be arsed to work on making it as it was thats fine but tell me that rather than lieing through your teeth at me. 
---
What am i missing here?
---
for $30 a piece I'm sure they'll bend
---
[Lol?](https://i.imgflip.com/1bhgqb.jpg)  
---
&gt; Ranged pulling is useful for pulling a single mob or two without risking entering the aggro range of other mobs. 
---
Wont that pulled mob cross into the aggro range of those other mobs, pulling them?
---
It ran quite well - it just had lower dips for the lowest 1% and 0.1% frametimes.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong as my only experience warrior tanking in vanilla has been on private servers: I thought I read somewhere that in retail Vanilla, BS only generates threat for targets on whom it first applies (not refreshes) the buff and therefore spamming BS shouldn't generate additional threat past the first one. Is that correct information?
---
Well, in general its better to simply wait for the next cast then miss/waste the kick. If you miss the kick on a healer then theyre back up to full health anyways, but if you just wait for the next cast you can still stop the full heal and make them killable
---
Im confuaed about what down ranking the spell would do? The cast times are shorter in most cases, but theyre still kickable
---
&gt;very good
---
The skill level of the pvp community is extremely high compared to what it used to be. You’ll be running into people who understand kicks at 1400 right out the gate
---
Disappointed in barrens chat in this SS
---
[https://youtu.be/kcQrnCRb4T4?t=46](https://youtu.be/kcQrnCRb4T4?t=46)
---
Lol, this was a decade ago.  I don't remember.  Thanks for the vote of confidence for my memory though.
---
I hear you, I was just explaining the reasoning behind it in this scenario. Plus tab targeting 5+ mobs means that the last mob to be sundered isn't happening until 75+ rage which is lots especially while lvling and off spec as well
---
Maybe on a completely separated group of retail trial servers
---
I don't think they existed in 2005.
---
UD start to Valley of trials is really not too bad. It’s like Dwarf start to Northshire Abbey. 
---
What’s rough is NE Start to Northshire Abbey. Did it before. Not fun. 
---
If i remember right there were 2 centaur reps in desolace and you could only max out one.
---
Another thing is syndicate and ravenhold, you cant have both. 
---
I’m just hoping that vanilla has similar pc requirements as it did back then. I’d love to play it on my less good laptop (that barely runs retail on lowest settings) so I can not be tethered to my pc as much for the grinding sessions for things like Robe of Arcana patterns. 
---
Lmao, who fucked up and cast serpent sting?
---
Ahh i see what you meant! Good shit. Still think they could put the work in tho. AV is a huge deal for many people, and is my favorite one. 
---
I'm not certain. I've read articles stating both sides, although I settled on believing the "spam BS" one. u/Taelonius seems to have a much better grasp of it than I do, lol
---
This is why you alliance are inferior.
---
  ;)
---
People who are already Rank 14 I guess yeah. No one who was ranking would go near AV though.
---
I saw that but haven’t been able to find any kind of update on the release. It looks like he’s been working on it for a while though? 
---
Anxious about pressing A and D.. Jesus.. 
---
&gt; re-bind A and D to hotkeys
---
Lol never thought of that!
---
Prediction: They won't.
---
They are missing sections of code for the earlier versions of AV, they aren't going to waste time trying to rebuild AV to what it was when they can just stick in a decent working version and prioritise important stuff.
---
Everyone who says hunters suck at raid dps should look at this screenshot.
---
I thought Blizzard was going to ruin everything? Like you guys are actually the most melodramatic hypocrites in the world. You want Vanilla, you get 1.12 Vanilla with a smoother launch and no need for tickets to a GM in order to resolve loot mistakes. All of you ejaculate over the fact that you are going to only be able to get into premade groups of 4 and Vanilla is already ruined. No I hear you, they should strictly cater to you guys and no one else. No matter how illogical or irrational you guys get. It's not like any of you fuckers would be happy anyways regardless of how they did it. 
---
Silver Storm? I would always inspect every Aenigma person I passed by haha. 
---
I also don't know if you can get Exalted with the goblin races. I don't think there's any mechanism to gain rep beyond quests, and there aren't enough to hit Exalted. Not totally confident on this, though.
---
Seems like the centaur rep only went to honored? Unless I am remembering wrong.
---
The correct answer here is the tanaris chicken quest. Don’t even bother doing it. Waste of time.
---
I agree with that. It all depends on the fight, the group, and your gear/spec. For instance, if you have a Rogue, you don’t have to worry as much about threat. If you have a Druid to cast Thorns and have a shield spike, you generate more threat. Lastly, the bottom floor of LBRS has some 6 mob pulls that are all linked, you can’t tab target that many mobs. If you don’t have a Mage/Rogue/Druid/Hunter, have fun :P. 
---
kthxbai
---
One VW limitation is that they don't have an actual single-target taunt. They only have a spell that generates a fixed amount of threat per cast. Once a VW loses agro it's unlikely to get it back.
---
I suppose that matters if you only choose your mount based on impressing other people.
---
I'd say go human. I played a gnome warrior on the recent pserver and even with having the same pre bis gear the human warriors always were top over me. The sword/mace racial is just too good for dps. And perception is pretty damn good for 1v1 against other rogues. 
---
Haha, no worries. I remember what feels like an eternity ago in what I think was BC AVs where everyone would summon the elemental, just because...it was glorious.
---
It's definitely a lesser issue than on progression, but world buffs creates a dynamic where dying makes you uncompetitive on the meters for the rest of the raid night (regardless of whether or not the death was your fault). It's a pretty miserable experience not having buffs while everyone else does.
---
If either a full removal or a temporary removal was implemented I would be happy.
---
Blood elf Paladins are silly good. Aoe silence and being able to judgement of blood out of cc gave you a much higher skill ceiling/threat level compared to alliance Paladins.
---
Living with that paranoia of yours can't be easy.
---
Lol yikes
---
I never played WoD, but I was of the understanding that’s what garrisons were, are they not?
---
Yes, 1.12 runs way better than retail.
---
But we just established that if all you care about is dps and have no interest in tanking, warrior is at least as good as rogue. So if that’s true why an earth would you go rogue? Just to appease people that think warriors should tank?
---
There exist private servers of BfA and they are bugfest galore. There is no way Classic private servers post-Classic launch will be 100%.
---
You don't have to rebind anything, but it makes sense to put strafe on A and D and then rebind Q and E. No one needs to turn.
---
Anxious? That the servers will break in the initial period and I'll be staying up the night to watch a loading screen.
---
He seems like a genuine guy who just loves classic warcraft.
---
What people aren't telling you is the reason AVs lasted for days was noone had a clue what they were doing.  It was new and it was something we'd never seen before and it was pvp so it was fun....for a while.
---
Those old AVs were absolute brain damage after a while and the only reason people here are dribbling on about them is rose tinted glassed.   AV won't be new, Battlegrounds won't be new, 1.12 is defintely for the best.
---
So I’m probably only gonna have one character for classic. I want to play a Dps spec for sure, and I wanna be able to do a little bit of everything. Leveling, PvP, dungeons. Maybe even some raids, but I’m going to be very casual. I won’t have tons of time to play all the time. Fury warrior is my ideal class fantasy, but I’ve heard that they’re terrible pretty much the whole time you’re leveling, and then continue to be bad until you get raid geared. Probably not possible for me, I’m not gonna play often enough for that. So I’m between Hunter and warlock. I still wanna be able to do raids just in case I ever get the spare time for it. Which option would be best for me? 
---
Hard to compare a raid to a few days long AV match
---
A raid is 1-3 hours, with epics dropping from nearly every boss, some BiS. There is constant moving and boss fights. Some pretty epic boss fights actually. While a multiple day AV would be a boring turtle, little action with little reward. After a few weeks (or months) you could hit exalted and get a mediocre epic or two that you will replace through raiding.
---
There is no fun and little reward with a long AV. It's pointless and detracts from the game. A 1-3 hour raid is the sweet spot for time investment/reward imo.
---
If you plan on raiding, unless you are in an extremely casual guild Engineering will be a requirement. Paladins benefit more from engineering items while leveling, so the guides recommend leveling engineering early and using the items. 
---
ahhh the old downvoted for the truth :D
---
Your "reasoning" is full of shit so I don't care.
---
What you’re referring to is the game theory principle of countersignaling.
---
No, but ten year old me would send my new characters letters explaining why I made them and my current progress. I wish I kept them.
---
1. The winterspring chimaera horns for the long scholo questchain. Have to get 8 horns, have to kill multiple hours, like one horn every 50 mobs.
---
2. Hearth Glen ... fucking ... escort quest. Is it hard? Nope. Is it slow? Not so much. Is the path long? Nah not really. Dispell und Purge? GOD DAMN FUCK YOU PRIESTS AND SHAMANS
---
Amazing hahaha. I wish I still had my old wow screenshots.
---
I believe you kill a lot - and I mean a lot - of Bloodsail pirates. Which means you also can't have both at the same time.
---
You also can't have more than 2 professions OP so maxing one out then switching is completely pointless, there's no record of it anywhere. You can also only learn certain weapon skills depending on your class. I don't think this is the right game to try and "complete".
---
Hahaha. No. They're not suicidal. 
---
Cross server BGs and dishonorable kills were part of 1.12, do you think they should be part of classic as well, just because they were in 1.12?
---
Holy moley, you have no idea what you're talking about. Just take a few seconds to use google, lol, or test it out yourself. It doesn't work how you think it works. 
---
If you're using each individual monitor for something gpu/cpu intensive, then yea, a 1060 might be pushing it. But when you're literally using 2 monitors for browsing/discord, and the third for WoW, a 1060 will 100% handle that np, the same as if you only had one monitor plugged in.
---
I've powered 3 monitors with a radeon 5770, while playing WoW on one, as an example.
---
I Just wasted 30mins by hunting down another hdmi cord, and a 1080p monitor to add to my other 2 monitors. So now I have 3 plugged into my gtx980 (roughly 8.1mil pixels, which is about 2million more than a triple 1080p setup), and I'm flying in SW with 120fps, and running around in Boralus Harbor with a hundred players at 65fps. Then I just unplugged the 3rd monitor and guess what? SAME RESULTS. And just to be positive I unplugged my second monitor and you know what, same performance.
---
Server populations. They could do everything right - content stages, when honor system is introduced, etc. and I'd still be nervous about ending up on a dead realm. 
---
Yes, buy an external monitor/keyboard/mouse and a proper cooling system for the laptop. Especially if you intend to play for extended periods of time. 
---
"Is this right to assume?" 
---
No. It makes no sense. We just don't want any (many realistically) changes from the base game and it would be the same for base expansions i.e. no, we wouldn't want flying gone, it was integral to the game, even if you didn't like it. To me it seems inevitable that they'll do TBC eventually - it's when the game was growing rapidly in popularity - and *maybe* a Wrath server, since that's the turning point for the player base. 
---
This is correct. It abruptly stops and only allows enough to progress in that zone.
---
Gnome warrior seems like the best alliance warrior race for pvp, definitely inferior compared to human for pve
---
warlock on alliance is solid for pve, you will always get a spot in raids. however in pvp its less solid, because horde have shamans (tremor totem) and will of the forsaken which kind of fucks warlocks up
---
hunter or spriest
---
There's Brian Kopp's, but it's *old* and could be outdated, I dunno. Don't be put off by the dodgy URL.
---
[http://www.oocities.org/iliektosuxit/](http://www.oocities.org/iliektosuxit/)
---
theres very little demand for bfa private servers. theres not very many actual bugs on vanilla servers its simply just wrong information on things like armor/resists which will be really easy to fix once they have a testable version of the game(and data mining)
---
Nice so I can pvp on my warrior and pve on the lock!
---
definitely mage, least gear dependent of all 3, best gold farmer and incredibly useful in groups
---
Not at all, games end extremely fast stuff is rushed down, game over within 30 minutes like retail
---
Who's gonna tell him he can't max all reps? 
---
Good joke.
---
&gt;what would TBC be like without flying? 
---
Impossible. If I remember correctly, the Kara key quest requires flying.
---
&gt;I think if we're all for No Changes in Vanilla, we're all 100% for Changes in everything after. 
---
I don't think this is right. Some of us are \#nochanges for Vanilla and could not begin to care less about either "TBC Classic" or "WoW/OSRS New Classic Content." I'm an adult now - I really doubt I'll even get to Naxx in Classic, but I'm definitely not about to spend years and years playing this again...especially not the same old game with a new, jaded playerbase.
---
I hear ya man. Tauren have a permanent pass, because (little known fact) Cairne's brother was actually the very first Anguskhan. But back in the day I loved that most people just rolled with a randomly generated name. Way too many special characters and whatnot floating around out there. 
---
I feel your pain on a personal level.
---
Actually hunters were the best dps until after BC. Then it wasnt worth having more than two in a raid, cause rogues and mages dps grew.
---
Ok so post that one instead of whatever misinformation you're spreading
---
I think there was 1 mob in the badlands that you could kill, or maybe that was to decrease rep idk
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvGNJc0yYLU
---
orcs say zugzug
---
Look up the system requirements for the 7.3.5 game client which is what classic will use
---
That’s why it’s been on the battle net launcher for pre order since November. That shit doesn’t have to be out yet for blizzard to cash in on the hype. 
---
11 days at 43, I love it. I think I was around the same on my shaman. Dont think I got 60 until like 15 days
---
Yeah, as someone who has gamed at 4k and 144hz separately, I'll take 144hz at 1080p over 60hz at 4k any day. 
---
I think everyone has [this one.](https://i.imgur.com/uCcAZLD.jpg)
---
You could make that same argument for World of Warcraft lmfao are you kidding me bro
---
Not true, feral druids can aoe tank and are in fact much better off tanks than pally tanks
---
Not to mention that the healer can dps sometimes too. I remember late vanilla we would run dm north with a shadow priest. I think he came out of shadow for the boss fight but I'm not even sure. 
---
I never played this way before. 
---
[It's a classic pose!](https://imgur.com/a/Dclb6dg)
---
Go with a 144hz monitor. Refresh rate is more important than resolution for gaming quality. Also make sure it is a tn panel. 
---
This is the correct answer.
---
An instant cast like Lightning Shield gets something like 30%, while Chain Lightning might get 80%.
---
Mate I was just trying to understand your reasoning, no need to be a total ass about it in your edit.
---
So you’re part of the camp that is totally opposite the objective minded players. Not only do you not care about winning or rewards, but you actually seem proud of the fact that you just show up and do your own shit for a few hours and then leave.
---
I’m sure there will be plenty of AV instances out there for players like you- I wouldn’t fret. People really shouldn’t be getting worked up over blizzards decision to implement 1.12 AV.
---
They are very situational and fine the way they are.
---
That's utter noob talk because with both, you lose time on your next spell cast.
---
Sometimes you want to cancel your cast so you can blink. Any mage that is not an utter noob has their blink and CS spells macroed with cancel cast so they can cast it without losing time moving or losing ability to move by jumping.
---
Some dps do use some to brag about number but that's about it
---
. Threat isn't a problem since he specced fury (and if we need more threat, i am also here since my tps is even higher as a druid), survivability isnt a problem anymore. He even dualwield tank all of MC and a third of bwl. Even if he used consumables i don't think it would really make the run faster. 
---
Mhm, I  took my sweet sweet time learning the game.  It was my first time, everything was new.  
---
I wasn't saying the above was good or bad, just that it is.
---
Personally I think battlegrounds ought to require PvP but that's me.
---
Seems like it but the BG wasn't efficient enough then.
---
You can look at the positives or the negatives it's really just about your perspective. I think it's fun to be able to speed clear raids that I've already cleared countless times, and having the minigame of completing the raid without dying I think is pretty fun.
---
Hmmm I really thought we were at the point a console could do it! Maybe next gen lol
---
This raid used to scare me everytime we had to face her. Onyxia was not an easy fight on first attempts. You walked into that room with a giant dragon laying down with no idea whats about to happen with no clue about the mechanics and no guides. That boss can go die in a cozy fire.
---
When anyone talks about old av its no the 1.12.1 patch, I know it, You know it, Blizzard knows it, Poonlord who started in MoP knows it. 
---
I would not have been suprised if they had not already made lots of changes that were never in 1.12.1 but those changes despite annoying me made me think well they are going to give us the good version of AV then sweet. 
---
That’s how vanilla is, there is a ton of other broken things, let’s just leave it how it is, cause if they get changed, why shouldn’t other stuff get changed?
---
Well ars aspire to think out the next Big dick loot system and for that he needs to be more clever because people will absolutely shit their guilds over id they can get purples
---
Thanks for the reply. Of course there are a few places that currently require flying, but those would obviously be changed.
---
Im worried about dalrend competition :(
---
Console OW omg I can't even imagine.... Ugh
---
Its a dumb change. It might be a change made specificly so they can launch in China with the exact same copy of the game though. 
---
They are doing it with diablo mobile too. I think China is now the king of Blizzard becasue they seem to be only doing things to appease that market. 
---
It kind of bums me out everyone will go into classic knowing exactly which classes are the best at what role.  Before, everyone was trying out something purely because it sounded fun to them, not knowing if it was the best at anything. 
---
With that said there will be more rogues and hunters than anything.  On launch everyone and their mother will be power leveling a hunter
---
what healer class/race should i play to be in high demand for raids and dungeons?
---
Keep in mind server population may screw with aoe grinding. I wanted to do it again with my mage but realized zones might be swarmed. 
---
5mans tanking isnt hard
---
well like 90% of it anyway
---
I’m sure they will have server transfers
---
Give us both. Make two separate queues, one for "historic AV" and one for "modern AV". One will be an epic adventure lasting days and the other one will be for people who just want to farm it.
---
The thing about AV. It just shows why dwarfs are good at defense and building up redoubts. It also shows when you have a blind ass hole as you general. He won't be able to see all holes in his own defense. Only a blinds moron would have chosen that battle field. Drek is a bafoon lol.
---
Why can't it be both? Or why can't AV help support the community aspect because its fun instead of being good for quick honor?
---
There are plenty of people who will still play classic, despite AV being a zerg rush. I don't think anybody is jumping at the chance to pay a subscription*specifically* so they can zerg rush AV. And that's a crucial point in my view.
---
Not really no.
---
This is the version where they are almost no NPC's so nothing stops you from running right past the other faction. Its the [rush version where no PvP happens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2yDzcer7Ig). 
---
Man that’s what happens when you’re in full on panic mode....but also overly polite and don’t want people to know you’re panicking haha.
---
Dwarf priests for alliance. Shaman for horde
---
I found the noob
---
Am I the only one who just holds rightclick to strafe when needed and like having the option to turn when not paying much attention?
---
I used to think that engineering gadgets were fun, but I have kinda changed my mind on it lately. It's just insane how much shit you can do with it. Reflectors, grenades, rocket helmet, net etc.. There is so much CD's and CC's that you cant even play your character anymore, it just becomes a game of cooldowns on items and who has them ready. What is a Warlock suppose to do vs a Warrior/Rogue with reflector? You just die by the click of a button, or you have to use super expensive potions to try to win..
---
Nah rush AV to get the items then never go back. AV is going to be a ghost town.
---
Well it should make sense! Everyone thinks the "QoL" changes all the way up to the current version of the ruined the game. They want no changes because each expansion brought about those changes. If you were to move on passed Naxx, would you want to play the versions of the game that started to kill it? Or would you rather play that version without the QoL changes?
---
Your answer indicates that you don't understand my question. So many people in this sub come up with many many points that essentially killed the fun of the game. These include a lack of world PvP (due to flying &amp; sharding), dungeon finder, heroic dungeons, catch up content, heirlooms, etc. Each expansion brought about those changes. What if they never made those changes in the first place? How would that affect those expansions?
---
This might have been the case for your server/battlegroup, but it is plain nonsense for me. I didn't actually buy TBC (I regret that but at least I got to do Wrath) so even though my memory isn't 20/20 I can categorically say that the zerg began and was present for quite a while at the end of vanilla. The zerg was entrenched well before TBC. It is just patently false to say otherwise. 
---
Yes there was still games that were long, but they went from 90% to 10%. 
---
[They did.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2yDzcer7Ig)
---
But the feeling when you were finally able to get one of those Onyxia hide backpacks... that was a good day.  I did have a learning process on that boss, but the rewards were nice.
---
Had no idea they sold these. Fellow stormreaver citizen, represent!
---
Okay you triggered me a little. 
---
no &gt;:(
---
What? Rogues are the absolute best world PvP class. The fact that you get the element of surprise, and get to pick the fights, makes rogues number 1 in world PvP. Not to mention that that rogues are among the top PvP class overall as well.
---
Stop.
---
&gt;  quest in Shimmering Flats 
---
Man, this was my favorite quest area in the game.  You went to the flats, hungover, and picked up the 15 quests available there and spent a few hours just grinding them all.  The feeling of accomplishment when you handed them all in was amazing.  All 3 characters in levelled in vanilla went to this zone just because it felt so efficient
---
Any escort quest
---
[https://classicdb.ch/?faction=47#quests:0+2+1](https://classicdb.ch/?faction=47#quests:0+2+1) all quests that give IF rep
---
warlock is like the best dueling class
---
There are quests for goblin races to hit exalted.
---
You need to farm to PvP competitively in Vanilla. That is just how it works. You need a broader strategy for your character progression that includes some way to generate a lot of gold over the course of your character life. That is true even if you choose mainly or only to PvP. 
---
What if they meant Southern hemisphere summer '19? Then it wont drop until December.....
---
fellow rogue here looking to take your dalrends lol
---
&gt;TIL seeking pre-raid BiS is now considered min/maxing. 
---
Is that not literally the definition? Using the best spec even if you dont want to getting all the best gear pre raid farming consumables or world buffs its all min/maxing. 
---
I also had ones of my head in the noose of the gallows outside Ratchet.
---
Nah, it's a reference for when Dwight was trying to buy time for Pam and Jim at the company volleyball game.
---
"Alright, that's enough Dwight."
---
"Can I finish?"
---
Well unless the players actually make pvp happen.
---
I'm gonna go with Resto Druid, I remember seeing far more Paladins and Shamans than I ever did Druids
---
There are some rules about addons, but I never saw those rules enforced. For example: addons must not be sold; addons must have source code available and not obfuscated. I think that Blizzard has technical ability to blacklist certain addons, for example to be able to react if Auctionator author will decide to hijack all players and automatically buy some trash with their money, but I never saw that in action.
---
So simply put, yeah, everything you can do in Lua is allowed. If it's not allowed, Blizzard will break API to forbid that. That's how they manage it.
---
And no, you won't be able to change interface version in TOC and have working addon. Some addons might work, some addons will require additional work. We do know that client will be based on Legion client or later. We know that they might break some additional APIs to further restrict addons in Classic. But generally you can expect, that popular addons will be adapted to classic, so things like auction addons, ElvUI, popular unit frames, raid frames, cast bars, etc will work.
---
I have no idea what Decursive is. If it's that addon that automatically dispelled people, then no, such addon is not possible with current API and it won't work.
---
You've never played a druid then :)
---
They don’t need to invest in special servers for classic. They can just allocate more resources per instance. Servers now are more powerful than servers then, the difference is that now instances are virtualized so they allocate resources based on expected demand. If they expect a higher demand on classic servers vs BFA they can just scale accordingly. In fact, their investment only has to be proportional to net new Blizzard players. 
---
I think what people mean to say on this thread is - I hope Blizzard ensures the correct resourcing for classic realms given they have a different usage than retail realms. 
---
[Shorter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2yDzcer7Ig)
---
Factions you can’t hit exalted with: Syndicate, Desolace centaurs, opposing faction race and PvP
---
Uhh...what?
---
Great breakdown.
---
When you say changing the interface TOC won't result in a working addon is that because some addons will have APIs that are broken in the current version?
---
Hypothetically if an old addon did nothing that breaks the current API rules set by Blizzard would changing the version result in it working correctly?
---
wtf are you talking about
---
Buh... Uh... Have you not been reading any of the comments? Thats what the nochanges people are after. 
---
Don't care about it. You need to modify exe to allow those things. And nowadays that exe is encrypted, so you need to have some serious reverse-engineering skills. You won't do it accidentally :) Experiment as much as you want. Worst thing you'll have is Lua errors or degraded FPS on your client.
---
That's still no reason for anxiety lol
---
Proudmoore (pve) was also an “Aussie” server. The OCE servers were somewhat pointless as they were still localised in the states, they only existed so that people on similar time zones would be more or less on the same realms iirc.
---
This is true but the range of possible values isn't that big. I know the max amount of bonus damage that you can find on a green cloak, for example, is 21. I have only ever seen cloaks that range from +20 damage to +21 damage as long as the required level to wear them is around \~55.
---
I don't think any of the popular databases have made an easy way to search for this yet. But I think they should given how good these items are for casters.
---
“After careful consideration, we have decided on Patch 1.12: Drums of War as our foundation, because it represents the most complete version of the classic experience.”   How does that statement exclude BGs?
---
Did you listen to anything they said about sharding or did your brain melt when they talked about it?
---
Staggering did happen... so what’s the problem?
---
I don’t really care about loot trading because needing on an item should bind it.
---
Pre-1.12 AV was enjoyable for few people which is why BLIZZARD kept patching it.
---
That bitch. As I recall, you spend several quests working towards freeing her and then she attacks.
---
&gt; Worst thing you'll have is Lua errors or degraded FPS on your client.
---
This is exactly the sort of result I come to expect :)
---
Sure, but the fights that do require consumes can easily run your cost into the 100g range if your guild happens to be stuck on it.
---
Based on the info you provided, I would go with Warlock. While I did not play Warlock myself, here are some positive points that I remember about them:  
---
\- Good at leveling and tackling solo content due to having pets (namely Voidwalker for tanking) to help you out, especially with elite mobs which some other classes can't solo and require 2-3 people.  
---
\- Has enough AoE to be pretty efficient at farming  
---
\- Is a rather underplayed class, so I would imagine even if you don't start raiding until later on you should be able to find a spot in a raid group as they were in pretty high demand in Vanilla.  
---
\- Can be very powerful in PvP although the skill cap is very high. I would recommend testing out a Talent Calculator to see what kind of builds interest you, and what build would be a good balance for PvE and PvP  
---
Me too Haha
---
Yyyyep. You also get potions from it regularly, which sell quite well!
---
And at one point Black Lotus was BoP, so the alchemist themselves would have to camp and farm the herb.
---
Can you get exalted with Bloodsail Buccaneers, if so how?
---
I think up to the level 50+ dungeons, you can tank well enough without being Prot specced. I would level Fury if you are going to be doing mainly PvE,  or go Arms if you plan to do PvP along the way. 
---
umm no, Hunter dps drops off massively after BWL
---
I was going to play Druid, because it's the class that is always the least played, but I think I might go back to Rogue, which was my first 60 and most played character throughout vanilla. This time I'll be playing Horde instead of Alliance, though.
---
I have to imagine they sell for quite a lot, especially with classic right around the corner.
---
There's two on ebay at the moment for 1.4k and 5.3k USD.
---
Both of those features have very strong pros and cons.  I’m kind of 50/50.
---
You are using XML to describe graphic elements of your addon. You can write addon in pure lua, there's nothing in XML that's not available via lua. Also XML is kind of static and with lua you can have more dynamic approach. Different people have different opinions about XML. Some prefer to write everything in Lua. Blizzard uses XML heavily for their UI. I, personally, think that XML is fine and UI structure with XML is more obvious, so unless you can't achieve something with XML, you should stick with it, but that's just my opinion. What I suggest you to do is to delve into Blizzard UI and learn how they write it. Their developers are not so bad, so may be it's worth to learn from them.
---
The noggenfoggerrrrrr
---
Agreed, I would pick Human as well. You will deal more DPS due to Sword Specialization racial trait, and perception will help you tremendously in PvP as you will be able to detect enemy rogues before they detect you and can get the jump on them.
---
&gt;I remember seeing far more Paladins and Shamans than I ever did Druids
---
There's a reason for that :P
---
I miss the old barrens and the chat. Laughing Skull barrens chat was the best. I hope classic really gets a big following. Any word on cost?
---
I bought just the base normal version and I'm having a ton of fun, the other editions are just little bullshit items you quickly out level and 3 days early access ohhhh big woopty shit, it's a fun game to kill time with.
---
Im going mage for Atiesh. I need an OJ to look like a badass in ogri
---
I know we're settled on 1.12, but a lot of the end game content actually got cleared in 2.03. It was just as long of a patch, and more people had gotten attuned, and geared by then. It also made a ton of the changes people in this thread crave, and it's still a classic patch, even though it starts the dark portal event. I wouldn't mind servers that progress to 2.03 in the last phase and stop.
---
Its a bad thing because its the patch where there is nothing on the roads. You have a clear path right to the enemy team base with no threats at all. [Not a single threat even inside the base.](https://youtu.be/D2yDzcer7Ig?t=126) 
---
I think the problem is people wanting to play the game for the experaince vs people wanting to play the game to get the loot ASAP so they can stop playing the game. 
---
I have no intrest in 10-20 minute AV's at all, I also would never have a second thought of getting off the computer if I needed to for my job or family without getting rewarded for the time I did play since playing its self was the reward for going to work the day before. People who want to gear becasue they dont like AV will get the gear swiftly and never play AV again. 
---
This patch will cause AV to die a very quick death just like back with 1.12.1 launched and moving into TBC back in the day.  
---
You said yourself you need to use expensive potions to win. I am agreeing with you and telling you that’s just part of the game. Farm gold and get the potions, then you have a chance to win. That’s part of the PvP meta in Vanilla.
---
"Free" but you need a monthly sub to retail WoW ;)
---
He is replying to your statement of needing potions.
---
I do want to mention that Warriors are perhaps the most gear-dependent class when it comes to PvP. I could imagine you having an easier time getting your warrior geared if you play your warlock first and get into a raid guild, get your Warlock geared. Eventually, your guild will likely start running "Alt Raids" and at that point you could jump in with your Warrior and get some purples (especially a solid 2H) for PvP. It's a more long term route, but will make a difference in your enjoyment of Warrior PvP imo.
---
Would’ve been 10/10 if your fried was in the other catapult
---
This is my life exactly. Except the alliance scum part
---
What if it just reset during server maintenance. It's still a pretty big tax if you respect every night or something, and trivial if you just want to switch once a week to grind or something.
---
What are you looking to do at lvl 60? PvP, Raid, casual PvE or all of them?
---
Not too bad. Still 30 for 2 months?
---
Play without them then. You come off as a freekill-type guy anyway.
---
Personally, like... I hope they do, but i'm also okay if they dont. The problem with some of the specs is not damage, but mana. And if you tweak the mana efficiency, how will that ripple into PvP and into even the other specs. Will resto now just spec deep ele because theres some broken way to regen too much mana? I support it but I know it's way more complicated than it seems.
---
Peons *yeeted*
---
1/5
---
He wants a confirm choice button.
---
Players dont fight in rush AV. It stops the rushing. 
---
$30 says they don't ;)
---
Only always.
---
What a lot of these #nochanges people seem to forget is that wow was still very much incomplete even at 1.12. I firmly believe that the game will launch 1.12 but we will see 1.12.1 or 1.13 to reign in some glaring imbalances. While leaving the game pristine and untouched would be nice, I don't see blizz leaving it that way.
---
I think Shadow Priest is a great pick for PvP and you won't need to be insanely geared. Your skill will matter more than gear in the first couple of phases. I would highly recommend getting that one staff that switches depending on if you are in shadow form or not, I can't remember what its called, and you should eventually find a raid group that would take you along just for the quest. My best friend did this, and I think that staff was the only purple he had but it made a big difference
---
Well hell yea, my brother is gonna be an alchemist so this works well for us.
---
&gt;This should have been obvious from the start when they said they were basing the game on 1.12
---
Except for sharding, And loot trading, Oh and staggered dungeon releases. Yeah there was no reason to expect them to give us the watered down version of AV. 
---
As a Tauren going to any other starting zone is fun too. Southern Barrens is like a minefield. At least it was at original launch when I did not know the zones like I do now.
---
Low effort.
---
If it's any consolation, I'd trade Classic for what you've got in an instant.
---
Someone convince me to play rogue pls
---
I would say Mage as well, especially if your goal is to try and get R14 (a VERY time consuming matter btw)  
---
Mage also has a ton of utility, and I remember selling conjured food / drink was an amazing way to make some extra coin too.  
---
Why when classic drops I'm gonna be there at launch to snag my names.
---
I typo i ment BWL
---
Surprised me that shamans are at the bottom.  Resto is a great healer in vanilla.  Enhance is fun to play as well.
---
Reflectors can be annoying but between the cooldown, the animation, and the 30sec delay to use they're pretty easy to play around in most situations. 
---
That's what I've always done.
---
This way you can travel with just one hand on keyboard
---
But is it really worth the extra development time? I am pretty sure they said the oldest version they still had laying around was 1.12 and it is what they're basing Classic on. They don't have the data from the 1.5 or 1.8 AV which means they would have to postpone the release date to accommodate for this change. I have a hard time seeing how such a tiny change is worth all the effort.
---
The melee attack on action button 1 as a Mage. So good.
---
Play rogue 
---
Part one seems to be [here](https://countdowntoclassic.com/2019/03/12/episode-95-classic-news-ex-wow-dev-talks-warriors-aq40/), for those wondering.
---
Don't need to worry about dalrend competition if it never drops...
---
So in your opinion, is it worth for Blizzard to go back and manually re-create 1.8 or 1.5 and postpone release date due to this one change? In my opinion the answer is pretty obvious.
---
Won’t somebody please think of the blessing?!!
---
^
---
Do you still have the screenshot of when you Pyroblasted yourself?
---
&gt;  and topped at end game
---
top from start to finish
---
but you don't need the Esc key, right? as OP thinks.  You can rebind it.  
---
I find most of WoW to be so slow and easy that I don't care about losing a fraction of a second. I guess in Arena it matters more.
---
It’s a realistic possibility.
---
I thinking of playing a Druid. Unfortunately I don’t like either race but I guess I can deal with it. I prefer gnomes because they’re generally the more cheerful race. Problem is my only experience for WoW is Bfa and legion. What should I expect as a classic Druid? I don’t really like the “play this way or gtfo” mentality I’m seeing though is this just a minority or the way it’s meant to be played? Otherwise I guess I’ll quit WoW for good. Are raids mandatory? It seems like the gameplay is vastly different in terms of content. Any help for a complete noob?
---
The quests “The Pages of Stranglethorn.”
---
Not only would these take forever, I remember the initial XP and quest rewards not being worth the time spent. I know they changed this with an update, still painful though.
---
I just wanna say, I think by far the most populated Race/Class combo was Night Elf Hunter. As a horde player back then, it seemed like every 3rd enemy I ran across in PvP was a Night Elf hunter, so I would expect competition to be very high.
---
Afaik his plan is to have it ready for classic launch
---
July 16th.
---
&gt;My prediction is that many games will be base races, but certainly not all of them
---
So we will have 1 out of 10 games of AV be enjoyable is what you are saying. Thats very depressing. 
---
Mhh gotta say that xbow from bwl is Nice too 
---
I'm not debating the DPS numbers. I gave a decent reason as to why OP should avoid warrior if he doesn't want to tank, because other warriors will avoid grouping with you to not compete on gear drops. If OP really wants to play warrior, I'd recommend they learn to tank not to appease others, but to help himself get groups and gear up more easily.
---
I used to. I still do, but I used to too
---
"there will be no crossover between retail and classic"
---
No reinforcments is the only difference, They nerfed these "elite" lieutenants into the floor to the point where a single player can clear a group solo easily where as before they pretty much had to be tanked. 
---
This is retail minus the reinforcements 
---
If by old addon you mean addon from vanilla, then it's very unlikely that any addon would work. API changed a lot for 13 years. They changed a lot of functions because they added some functionality or just for the sake of change and those changes often will break addons. I wrote a little addon for BfA and it was broken between 8.1.0 and 8.1.5 because they changed the way some function returns its results, so I had to write small fix. If you're talking about that ancient addon, a lot of those functions will be broken.
---
You can experiment if you want. Just install old addon into current client, hit "allow old addons" checkbox and try it. I doubt that you'll find any working addon.
---
Addons from Legion is more likely to work, unless developers would specifically break them.
---
The truth is some people like 1.15 AV. No one likes 1.12 AV. It's only supporters support it out of greater dislike of 1.15 then any actual love for the 1.12 version of wow. All blizzard did with this confirmation is put AV in the box everyone expected it to be in. You will spam it until you get the rewards from exulted. Then you will never play it again. 1.12 is a complete shit bg. I get why blizzard made the choice they did. Restoring 1.15 woulda been one hell of a chore. One they might not want to do. That being said. 1.12 Av is shit. Don't put lipstick on a pig and call it a beautiful woman. It's a pig and it's sad they are putting a pig into the game.
---
Get your priorities straight, noob!
---
I mean they were in 1.12.1 but they have not said if they will be in. 
---
I love the druid class fantasy. My two rubs with them in classic are that you can only have one rejuv on a target and you have no spammable rez. Whatever you play, I hope you enjoy it to the fullest mate. See you in Azeroth!
---
By being hostile with the Goblins.
---
I do. Either that or release AV after launch giving them time to launch the game now and fix what needs fixing later. 
---
I'm lost too. We went from #nochanges to "bring back old AV!!!"
---
Ænigma was THE guild to be in on Burning Legion. They were basically the elites of the server and were all fantastic players.

Can still remember my first epic. [\[Gloves of Holy Might\]](https://classicdb.ch/?item=867)

Those bad boys dropped for me when farming in Tanaris. Sold em for 80 gold at level 42. I felt like the Bill Gates of WoW.
---
I want Vanilla without post-Vanilla changes.
---
I want TBC, with all TBC changes, but no post-TBC changes.
---
I want WotLK, with all WotLK changes, but no post-WotLK changes.
---
I do not like all of the WotLK changes, but I want them anyway, because that is what it is, and I'm not going to presume to be the arbiter of changes.
---
I do not want Cata.  But if they make Cata, I hope it would be with all Cata changes, and no post-Cata changes.  I probably wouldn't play it, though.
---
I actually kind of want MoP.  With all MoP changes.  With no post-MoP changes.
---
I hope you see where I'm going with this.
---
My reasons for "no changes" are very simple. I want the original game (as much as that is possible). It should be playable like any other old game. The same is true of any expansion. I want the original TBC and Wrath not some changed version.
---
If its not out by the time i get home tonight then i wont be playing!
---
^^^^^/s
---
Hell yeah brother
---
I hope they let people do this again
---
I cannot comment on Druid as I did not play them, but I did get a Shaman to level 60. I also had a Warrior and Rogue to 60, and by far the Shaman was the most fun to level. It's a rather unique class I find, and both Elemental and Enhancement spec are pretty darn good for both leveling and PvP. You will want to collect a separate set of gear as you level for when you need to heal in dungeons - which is pretty easy and totems arent that hard to use. I also find Shaman can be very powerful in PvP, even if your gear isnt that great. The main downside to Shaman is that you run out of Mana quickly across the board, and you also have no hard CC.
---
its only 3hrs of BFA and locked a few quests in, so i dont see the point of it at all. Unless you just want to level past expansions.
---
&gt;Did you listen to anything they said about sharding or did your brain melt when they talked about it?
---
I did, I dont believe them. They said they want people to have a Vanilla experience too but then do this. Ill wait and see on that one though but either way we are talking about changes and that is a change yes?
---
&gt;Staggering did happen... so what’s the problem?
---
Did not happen within a single patch though. 1.5 av happend too so throw that in sweet.
---
&gt;I don’t really care about loot trading because needing on an item should bind it.
---
Fingers crossed. Would be semi tolarable that way. 
---
1.12 AV was not fun for people either though, Why do you think it was mostly dead until the achivments came out in wrath? People did not enjoy playing the rush the base in 5 minute gameplay. 
---
I was just listening to the paladin theorycrafting segment of episode 78 and its making me wonder if the judgement stacking was confirmed on the demo
---
MT is unfortunately quite "min/maxy" and you should be as geared and buffed as you can possibly be if you plan to MT for raid groups, because in a way you have to be the strongest character in the raid group. I don't know about the professions though, but I could imagine Blacksmithing to be a solid pick.
---
People like you keep making that argument Anthaen. You might even have a point for many people. The problem with that though. Is you are leaving out that the 1.12 version of AV is a turd from day one. It's a turd everyone hates. 1.15 might rub some people wrong but at least it has some fans. The only support 1.12 gets is that some people like 1.15 so little that they would rather just have a shit show piniata then a bg. 
---
Nope, They do their thing and thats great but when their thing is directly impacting fun within the game then its an issue, Fuck just slap all the epics out for gold or some shit if they are so desprate for them that they cant live without or play AV for it. 
---
Yeah im proud I can play the game without throwing my toys out of the pram when im not being showered with rewards for playing 1 specifc aspect of the game. 
---
[This is 1.12.1 AV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2yDzcer7Ig)
---
Several issues I don't see taken into account:
---
* The actual DPS of dynamite is better when you figure you're not in combat 100% of the time.  It can help you on the way to the next pack.
---
* It's also AoE, and has a minor stun as well.  So there's the survivability and PvP aspects as well.
---
* There are other things you get from Engineering that can be useful.  Simply having extra Stamina and Spirit on your helm means less downtime and less corpse runs.
---
Where are you getting the money to buy herbs from the AH?

"I can't do that yet"
---
"I need more mana" 
---
"I need more mana"
---
"Not enough mana"
---
The thing is, I don't think you can rebind the esc key unfortunately. It does more than cancel cast, it closes UI elements and eventually brings up the menu. It's like a function in and of itself.
---
You can however make a cancel cast macro and just keybind that as a workaround.
---
I haven't checked through the options right now but I'm 99% sure you can't rebind the esc key itself.
---
I would be happy if they made the game as it was, They are not that much has been clear for several months now yet on another bad change they stand firm? You have to see why people are baffled and not fans of the retail lite version of AV.
---
Short answer: Yes!
---
Click bait!
---
&gt;did these "purists" get a confirmed "no changes" servers?
---
Actually we kinda did:
---
&gt;first and foremost is authenticity as our goal
---
&gt;we want to create an experience that feels just like 2006 World of Warcraft
---
&gt;https://youtu.be/hhKkP8LryYM?t=1811
---
I'd say this is one of the situations where.ou can pretty.much go for aesthetics and character flavor without worrying too much about racials. From what I gather, dwarf is probably better for PvP because of stoneform, human has more spirit but I don't know how this impacts paladin, it can probably mean they are better at PvE. Differences feel marginal enough for you to run whichever you think looks better and has cooler animations.
---
Just as I thought this sub couldn't get any more devoid of content, you break through the bottom and discover a hidden depth of empty space.

Not sure you can get Exalted with Bloodsail and then maintain that while getting Exalted with Steamwheedle

---
Yes it has:
---
Started too late bro!
---
I'm already prepping my kids 10 and 12 to farm mats after school.
---
That makes sense. Thanks.  
---
&gt;I haven't checked through the options right now but I'm 99% sure you can't rebind the esc key itself.   
---
Sounds right.
---
I got that earthroot for ya.
---
Sorry but the way private servers implemented old AV is like getting botched plastic surgery. 
---
How about 4 minute AVs?
---
Not attacking you just had to ask if there was an issue becasue "Okay (=" is pretty scarky responce when someone gives you their side. I am also Alliance.  
---
I highly doubt Blizzard has that information. They only keep data on your account for X months since your sub expired. So if you stopped playing 2 years earlier and your account was hacked they can restore. But if you've been subbed this entire time they won't have any data on your characters from that far back. There is no reason to keep it.
---
And Fuck no to this.
---
Making changes to how things were opens up a Pandora's box that does not need to be opened.  If they take a no change approach and something is imbalanced, they can just say "Well that's how it was." and most everyone will move along.  But if they try to balance something here or there then they will open the floodgates of people requesting this be changed or that be changed or for things to be nerfed or buffed - not to mention pissing off the people who liked things the way they were and are looking for that pure experience.
---
Also, back then when people complained that something of theirs got nerfed or changed in a way they didn't like, they usually had a leg to stand on because the character they put all that work into just got less powerful or changed in a way they didn't anticipate.  Nowadays we know what it was like and know what changes to expect before ever creating that character.
---
Besides, putting the effort into trying to make new balances to the old games just isn't worth it.  It's extra work that they don't have to do when they can, again, just fall back on "Well that's how it was.".
---
If you do this make sure you check with the healer that they are good for mana and ready.
---
Another quick note, as I played both Warrior and Shaman at lvl 60 in Vanilla, is that the Warrior is definitely more gear dependent than the Shaman. I think Enhancement spec is totally fine and I personally felt very strong in PvP as Enh Shaman, with very mediocre gear too. Your greatest enemies will probably be hunters, mainly due to their pets causing a ton of interrupt when you try to self heal
---
That's kind of strange. I mean, I know both these things can't be seriously compared, but if you think about it at the base level, Classic will come once. Whereas there's plenty more years in which you could find the man/woman of your life, have kids, get a nice job etc.

No official info, aside from one mention of having "a Classic summer."  Lots of speculation around July 16th (mostly based on [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9u755q/classic_release_date_july_16th_2019/), but nothing confirmed.
---
Don't forget that every race gets a specific Priest ability too - I don't know what the dwarf one is, but Undead gets another DoT thats very strong and I think heals you per tick as well? Can't remember but be sure to factor that in when you make your Race decision
---
It wasn’t there on the demo after all, however I’ve been told that there were also other things in the demo that shouldn’t have been so Paladins are still crossing their fingers that they might still see it in Classic.

I could not resist posting. I havent deleted shit. Buttface.

Again, sick attention to detail
---
100% agree.
---
What are you mainly looking to do? Raid, PvP, casual PvE or a little bit of everything?

It’s still run on that high of a graphics pull?

Pally ret spec is for PVP. Warriors have arms for the same reason.

---
Alterac Valley! I can't wait!
---
It's not even worth doing on retail. classic AV was golden!
---
If this is true then it means that a raid heavy on paladins could judge every rank of judgement of crusader and add ~800 damage to every holy spell hit, including consecration. 
---
This means 6 paladins doing nothing but rank 1 consecrate on a boss will contribute huge amounts of damage just by existing and while burning no mana. Add in the seal swing procs and judgements and you have a boss melting machine, and that does not even touch on the amount of threat a tanking paladin would generate with no effort.
---
you still on board for no changes knowing that?
---
but you can travel with one hand by holding down both mouse buttons or just binding auto run
---
I wouldn't mind some basic achievements being a thing. Like "finished Molten Core", "finished Dead Mines" .. you know what I mean. Nothing fancy where you get something special for. 
---
That's funny how you answered the guy like that.
---
Nice reading comprehension indeed.
---
This looks awesome - I’m going to check it outs. Thanks so much man! 
---
Am i a kid or a soccer mom? Or am i mentally challenged?
---
Please do tell me since you clearly know who I am based on how I play WoW... 
---
In my opinion, the story.  MMOs are at their best when you're playing a character within a world with pre-established lore.  This worked out perfectly with Vanilla, TBC, and Wrath, as it was simply a continuation of all of the groundwork and worldbuilding established by Warcraft 3 and The Frozen Throne.  After WotLK, that well dried up and they had to start adding things.  Events seemed to happen out of nowhere, and storytelling is better done when conventional narratives can be followed -- not when we're all collaboratively a part of a world.  I stopped playing after the first ~month of Cata, but as I understand it, things only got worse -- Pandas out of nowhere, rehashed demonic invasions, time travel / alternate universe, and now back to simply just war with BFA?
---
IMO, after Arthas died at the end of Wrath, there simply should have been a Warcraft 4 RTS game to tell a conventional story and build a new set of things into the world.  They could have structured things so that they made more sense and better set the stage for World of Warcraft 2, or simply some new expansions.
---
Bummer - I was hoping sooner so I could run through it one or two times before classic to get familiar lol
---
Why
---
If you were around WoW forums in vanilla, this was the same stuff they were complaining about.
---
Leveling a Paladin is boring. Endgame with a Paladin is boring.
---
But, once you get to PVP, you'll basically never die. You'll never be able to kill anything because it can just run away, but you'll never die.
---
from what I understand, this is similar to how it worked in Vanilla, making flat armor increases more valuable to a clothie for example.
---
I could be totally wrong though. 
---
I get PTSD thinking about trying to do these first time questing in STV .... never again
---
That's good for you. I hate everything about AV so I'll just waste my 6-7 hours in there to get exalted and then never return :D
---
I thought they made our characters too important. We go from small town citizens fighting a dragon to flying on a fuckin space ship. Ridiculous.
---
That sucks, your kids aren't old enough to farm for you
---
I used to exclusively log out when sleeping in a bed.
---
i want classic right now. 4 months goes by so fast but it feels so slow now that we are getting so close to classic.
---
I just wanna play Vanilla. That's all.
---
I most certainly did... pretty much took a screenshot every time I sat down in one, it was just so damn satisfying 
---
LFR
---
It's easier to eat, use phone or do whatever with the right hand though.
---
You also cant jump or use any abilities(without clicking on them) if you're just using the mouse
---
How come everyone has autoattack on 1
---
too bad dagger specs suck early game
---
I ran Legion just fine with integrated graphics.
---
I assume it's resto default and boomkin if you want to dps, regardless how bad boomies are I imagine SP gear and ranged with dots is still a lot better than any melee in mass pvp
---
reading about it now, looks like a lot of the demo was wrong
---
i did raid in a paladin heavy guild back in the day and while we never tried it then because it never occurred to us but i do remember seen odd things with overlapping judgement debuffs. i strongly suspect this being viable. 
---
Did they do that in 2006?
---
Moved to the "bring the player not the class" mentality when they started merging auras, and homogenizing abilities.
---
I enjoy the extra work it takes to build the perfect raid comp, and then fill those roles with the best players capable of filling those roles.
---
Bring the player AND the class.
---
You and me samesame. 
---
You are drunk out of your damn mind if you think a 4 minute av is possible on 1.12
---
multiple ranks of judged seals were known to interact but this is one of the things that just never occurred to people at the time. all evidence points to it being a valid behavior under #nochanges rules.
---
cya
---
I have, my old main!  I just like knowing everyone is on equal playing field.  I guess in an optimal state, blizzard would control which add-ons are acceptable and centralize them for all to enable easily 
---
That desk is pretty interesting. I’m guessing most class levelling guides were not made for people of your calibre. 
---
I spent a good several minutes typing up and posting my own response to this thread, but I take it back because this is the right answer.
---
My alliance guide will be done for sure once Classic launches and probably be ready even for Classic Beta.  My alliance guide is leaps and bounds better than Brains old guide.  It will also be about the same quality as my Horde guide, although specific class steps will come slowly over time.
---
I'm on a 6 year old 770 and have 0 issues running modern WoW
---
What does "protected" mean here?  It's used several times in the thread but never explained.
---
Yeah but then you'd have the constant scourge of "link achieve" and never be able to even get the achievement because you can't find a group to get it with!
---
My recollection is threat meters didn't exist until later in vanilla, and even then they were only commonly used by more hardcore players.
---
This is posted daily. Do a search.
---
Even tryhard guilds won't care about race.
---
Racial bonuses are negligible compared to good gameplay and knowledge of mechanics. Anyone who isn't taking you because "you are the wrong race" is full of shit
---
Play what you want. Have fun.
---
It’s been explained why they can’t do 1.5 AV. They would literally have to rewrite EVERYTHING. These preferences are also largely opinionated. There is a whole slew of people who are stoked that it’s the 1.12 version. Are they wrong just because you’re right? Their preference of AV is wrong? There needs to be SLIGHTLY more give and take here. People need to look at things from a development/technical point of view. 
---
Honestly? I hope not. Those of us who want to play classic are doing so because we loved classic. The more tourists you get, the more whining, complaining and chicanery will go on. The more people in the game means more whining on forums means more pressure on the devs to add the qol items that are currently in retail. Then we'll end up with some kind of FrankenWoW.
---
I believe it'll be similar in performance to Cata-era WoW, maybe a little better. We won't know until we get the full release.
---

If you've read my other posts, I've offered points of middle ground. There is give an take with some people, myself included, if you read more into the discussion.

no its easier to google reddit, make an account, find this specific sub reddit and ask a question and wait for an answer./s

Im still not sure if I want to go warlock or rogue, Im worried rogues will be overpopulated. But when I see some polls alot of people here are going lock.
---
I can't imagine so many people going lock. 
---
What do you guys think? :)
---
Haha. 
---
I think most people have sat in the catapult at one time or another, including myself.
---
Sure, I agree, that's what Classic is all about. At the same time, I'm just saying that I understand why they chose the easier one to maintain and focus on more important things. Other things being more important because even with old AV, the majority of players would probably end up just doing zergs strats anyways after a few games of old school AV.
---
That's where I feel like it will fall. Somewhere middle-end of July.
---
I get it. Makes sense. Have those expansions lost potential with those changes? What would they be like without them? Do you see where I’m going with this?
---
[We did another one 3 months ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/a43hch/survey_results_subreddit_update/)
---
How do you know their able to bring back older iterations of AV than 1.12. Claiming they can because they’re a “big smart company” is not valid reason. You are complaining to complain, not suggesting realistic viable options. 
---
Yes! Dude! I knew I played with you!
---
I am very interested to know how blizzard is going to handle this.
---
Either way I know I have to haul my human warriors ass as well the gnome to Darnassus so I can farm Night elf rep fast.
---
Removed as a repost, but as you can see from others, nothing beyond "Summer 2019" is known yet.
---
it's a legion client they are using but given how modified everything is going to be who knows how performance will be compared to legion.
---
I think the armored tiger mounts look absolutely awful, personally. I really like the fast unarmored tiger on my gnome.
---
Might be time for me to get a versectamy.
---
So by your logic. If we fix one game breaking unintended bug that was never part of the Vanilla experience, we must except ALL changes?
---
Did I understand that correct?
---
Looks like I'll be starting with a rather unimaginative version of the classic: [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/AhwMAsnBBT6NOHBA](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/AhwMAsnBBT6NOHBA)
---
With that said, I'm a bit partial to putting 2 points into Feline Swiftness for WPvP/stealth. So I may roll with that at the expense of a point apiece in Natural Shifter and Nature's Focus
---
I'm sure I'll try a crit build somewhere down the line too: [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/BNIwDxAABD5NDaM](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/BNIwDxAABD5NDaM)
---
Stealth is incredibly versatile and probably one of the most OP abilities in the game. 
---
you made the decision to have kids and get married, why are you posting on reddit complaining.
---
i think the mage gloves which are easy to get have +1% spell hit making them best option before T2 set bonus or bloodvine, is this correct?
---
Warrior bracers were pre-bis as well and much easier to get than a tanking bracer drop in a 5 man.

1 month?

That's how long it takes to get to 60 for most people.

Same dude! It's so badass, especially when someone recognizes what you're wearing.
---
&gt; I truly believe that Classic will run quite well even on 10-12+ year old PCs. 
---
With the caveat that they need to be running 64-bit Windows.
---
A classic shitpost.
---
Sounds like you don't know what Gsync even is? And if you've never played on a monitor with high refresh rate and gsync you don't know what you're missing because it is amazing lol
---
You're taking my post a little out of context, and what I've send generally by a fair margin. I am not complaining to complain. If you've deduced that from all of my posts, then I'm not sure what you consider a discussion. 
---
Blizzard being a company with many resources is valid. If they had all original information sure it would be hell of a lot easier, which is why they're not. Old patch notes elude percentage value changes which they surely have access to if members in the community do.  Give me a reason why they can't that's not based on "old data" or for cost reasons. 
---
I agree it's unrealistic to have any feasible changes around AV 1.12, but there really isn't a feasible alternative without adding elements that never existed. I can accept that, but it doesn't mean I'm "complaining to complain" because I'm hopeful for something different.
---
Mobs aggroing extra mobs doesn't work quite the same as players aggroing extra mobs. Say you blunder into a tightly packed area full of murlocs like that one quest in Elwynn. You could potentially body pull like 5 murlocs and you're screwed. However if you can pull one of them at range, that one mob should only pull I think 2 others, and you actually have a chance.
---
I remember the Druid quest line specifically and thinking without others offering help id never have found it in Westfall. The thing to remember is I was overjoyed at being forced to explore this place on the other side of the world that I’d never been too. If you’re doing more than one toon ever though yes this type of gameplay is obnoxious to throw a slow moving play around a massive world.
---
I feel you. I made a list of warrior leveling weapons and spent 4 hrs today trying to figure out the minimum level I had to be to solo Mor'Ladim to get Archeus
---
Woops, I didn't know we had so many market analysts in this sub. Damn dude you're right we should just not when play. HAVE YOU SEEN OSRS!?!?
---
True. I could live with non-linkable achievements to keep it just for yourself. 
---
Yeah exactly, I can spot those pixels from a mile away. Sexy ninja pixels.
---
They took the challenge--and therefore the fun--out of leveling. Without challenge, there is no sense of accomplishment. End game challenge barely counts as you have to grind so much to get to that point.
---
I bet - your horde guide is amazing!! I can't wait to see the alliance guide and race to 60 with it :)
---
Is your site the best place to check for updates?
---
No content after Naxx is what concerns me. Means I would have to quit and wait for another game similiar to Classic wow to come out.. never :(
---
at lower gear levels they actually do most dps but due to like 0 scaling get shat on after MC.
---
Was it this corner? ((start) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0lr5ZZVY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0lr5ZZVY))

I loved finding cool areas to screenshot/record my characters.
---
People talk about classic wow race/class/specs in black and white but if you're a decent player, you can find a way to be useful as anything. All race/class/specs are viable unless you're going for world/server first boss kills.
---
Raiding is not necessary, however, raid gear drastically helps in PvP and solo PvE content. It's highly beneficial to at least raid casually.
---
There's a lot less solo content, IE pets, mounts, achievements, etc... It's best to establish a spot in a guild early so you always have dungeon groups, raids, BG groups to join with people to chat with on your grind to 60. 
---
Playing solo limits content significantly but is definitely viable if you're dedicated. 
---
If you actually paid attention to the quest text, you would have realized she was actually evil, and it was your intent to attack her after freeing her.
---
As someone else said, the story. Just like s*** movies who think they can rely on explosions to keep people interested, when the story and dialogue are garbage.
---
 My husband and I had stopped playing after Cata, and we went back last year. I literally had to turn the game off because I was getting a headache from all the buzzing and spinning and growling and Ratatat-ing of everybody's toys and pets and mounts and Oh My God!! I felt like this game was now designed for 7 year olds.
---
Ah my search was overloaded with results and analysis videos, so I must’ve missed that. I was actually watching your videos the other day when I was debating on an orc lock. I’ll check out your video going over the results actually. Thanks for the response!
---
I remember grabbing the flag in WSG and wallclimbing out of the map. The GMs didn't think that was quite as funny as I did
---
Totally understand where you’re coming from. I think people would be fine without addons if they had never existed in the first place. It’s definitely one of those things that once you turn them on you’ll never turn them off.

---
Flying mounts was one of the biggest design flaws. Blizzard realized this but it was likely too late and couldn't be undone. Besides that, probably developing new continents with every expansion. As that would suddenly make all old lands and content obsolete. Also making the world and leveling too easy. Danger is what made the world immersive.
---
Killing Condors/Boars in the blasted lands. The drop rates for what you needed from them are insane.
---
Uh oh. I see someone is gunning for my raise!
---
Back then it was all about the GRIND.. Getting from 1-60 took almost the whole classic timetable before BC. Since everyone was new they had no idea what to do since there was NO guide. but thats why people loved the game it was an World OPEN for exploration... everyone had no idea how bosses worked or how to play there class. 
---
Nowadays its So SIMPLIFIED... From Gearing to questing to end game everything a half brain monkey can do... but thats why they did it because the Majority were casuals... 
---
Thats me personally i like hard games were i feel like i can never complete it because well someone is always better or there is always a better piece of gear out there..

---
Didn't you post this a few minutes ago?
---
I absolutely have no doubts that classic will be successful. It's been reasonably successful on private servers over the years, and that isn't even counting the people who don't play on them due to ping or simply not wanting to support or condone those projects or get too involved in a notoriously unstable and unpredictable situation and risk losing progress when--not if but when--the server administration implodes and pulls the plug.
---
I expect classic will enjoy incredible success and popularity.... at first. However, looking at pserver numbers, I'm fairly convinced vanilla/classic is a very niche market. One server boasted a population of 8-10k online at any given time. Impressive. But that' one server, that catered to a global market. Split that population up between oceanic, NA, EU, China, etc and what does server population look like now?
---
A few other contenders had respectable populations ranging from vanillaesque 1-3k to some with \~5k.
---
This suggests to me that at minimum Classic will have a viable population that can support probably one of each server type per region, but likely more. But enough to dethrone BFA? I'm not sure about that.
---
I'd love it if it did, I'm hopeful that it might, but I'm under no illusions that classic will usher in some sort of MMO renaissance. If that were the case, we'd have likely seen somebody else successfully pull it off already.
---
So you are less "no changes" and more "some changes so long as it supports the schema that i also support".
---
Good god its just as bad as the classic EQ UI.
---
Appreciate the great, lenghty response!  
---
I don't mind both mage or rogue being a bit more challenging than a hunter. Solo runs for hunters seems rather stale, honestly, but Rogue pickpocket runs sounds fun. While leveling I suppose any of them works.  
---
I'm leaning more towards the mage, as Frost AoE farming seems rather fun. When it comes to the spec (improved blizzard and other stuff), is that a viable leveling approach considering also World PvP? I love the idea of AoE farming my way to 60 in a sense. Also, would I be constanly respeccing between PvP, AoE farming and Dungeon runs? Any time I want to do either I'd have to respec or how is that?  
---
I'd say it's highly unlikely.
---
Still a bitch though.
---
Well the thing is the people who dont want days long AVs in my opinion dont really have a voice. What do they want? They want a quick to complete battleground. Well suprise we already have this in warsong and arathi. Why do they really need another quick BG?
---
The people that want day long AV`s dont really want a super long BG. Thats not even the point. The point is that old AV is like a world PVP zone thats always up. You can join and have (balanced) world PVP. You go to work and come back and its still up. It doesnt fucking matter that its still the same BG, it matters that there is a BG that feels like an open world pvp zone.
---
For me open world pvp was always the best part of  the game. Sure I enjoyed raiding but in the end i raided to get the gear to pvp. And alterac is just really a zone where you feel like you are not beeing in a BG but in an open world zone.
---
So I see absolutly no reason why they dont want to give us that. Everybody that enjoys quick battlegrounds has other options. There are NO other options for constant zerg open world pvp. So in my opinon just bring back old AV and everybody who disagrees wanst there for the epic battles OR is just not interested in them. And if you are the second you really should not try to argue and ruin the fun for others because you want some stupid other thing that the game already has.
---
Id rather play classic in a dark room and subsist on chicken tendies than have kids.
---
I fucking hate the Alliance Warlock Succubus Quest. The first step is to go to the Barrens to talk to some asshole whose camped out there for no particular reason.
---
Meanwhile, Horde side... the guy is in the same damn building.
---
Appreciate the great response!  
---
It does make sense regarding leveling and PvPing as a hunter. It's the class I've played the most in WoW, so I'm fairly familiar with the playstyle and enjoy it fairly well.  When it comes to Hunter ammo, as I'm not certain I want to do Engineering despite being focused on PvP and gold farming; I suppose I could choose any profession that makes a decent buck and simply buy the ammo off the Auction House. Or would that be quite expensive?
---
He did and got shit on LMAO
---
Wat
---
&gt; Basically the sharding system should be active at launch in order to prevent starting zone overpopulation making leveling the classic way impossible (if you have ever tried playing on some fresh pserver, you know this - waiting hour to complete simple quest gather xy items from mobs)
---
It's only partly that. The other part is to avoid dead servers as much as possible. If the tourists filled up a server for the first few weeks of launch and then they all left, that server would be missing a massive chunk of population. Players joining later generally go to high or med pop servers, so that dead server would be left, well, dead.
---
Alright, that's what I thought.
---
Removed as a repost.
---
Mega torn between Mage and Rogue.
---
I will be playing alliance PVP server and either human or gnome. I will be raiding and doing outdoorpvp, maybe even grind some pvp ranks. One thing i also really enjoy is pushing the limits of my character and try to solo dungeons and or elites some other people wont be doing. Or try to do small group raids and stuff like that. 
---
Which class will do more dmg in raids like zg, bwl and aq? Which one do you think is better class at pvp duels generally speaking? I really like both of these classes and cant decide which one to go with and prolly wont have time for both as i like to really minmax my characters..
---
&gt; Like, if I tell you "ur spec sux lol" the only conceivable way that it could hurt your enjoyment of this game (which seems to be the major recurring theme of every complaint/circlejerk against "min-maxers") is if you are not being invited to dungeons/raids because of their opinions. 
---
Now imagine you encounter that every time you post your opinion or comment on this subreddit and you have a better idea of where the "circlejerk" comes form.
---
Yea, a lot of them never played the actual game back then.
---
I'm still salty about the mechanical changes from talents, debuff slots, etc as it will have a massive impact on early content, but honestly that's pretty meh in the grand scheme.
---
Blizzard looks to be taking the wish for as close to vanilla as possible very seriously and I couldn't be happier for it.
---
People who only really played on private servers may be in for a rude awakening. 
---
Yup fair enough - I mean, I think implementing everything else as 1.12 but rolling back AV to 1.8 (and setting the precedent of different game systems existing in different patch states) is a terrible development practice in general. I get why they chose 1.12 over earlier patches, so once the patch is picked, I agree with faithfully recreating that patch. There is also the argument that a 1.12 game state with a 1.8 system (AV) isn't "classic WoW" because that would be a thing that never existed in classic anyway. 
---
But outside of technical considerations, I do still think it's a shame, because AV has a huge legacy and it is a "museum piece", and I don't think 1.12 is a good or fully faithful recreation of this experience.  
---
I'm not that knowledgeable but I would assume engineering is 100% required because it is a dps increase, meaning a threat increase. 
---
He is saying, when most people play on a private server. The private servers say they are based on 1.12 which gives players the very inaccurate impression that. Private servers are actually 1.12 so when they see changes from what they are used to on private. They assume that blizzard is the one being inauthentic and not the privater server they play on.
---
&gt;I think it would be way more helpful to try and portray the middle ground and fix their "you either accept me in the raid group exactly the way I want to be accepted or you don't"
---
Can you find a single example of this attitude on this subreddit?
---
Thank you for the response!  
---
How do Warlocks do in terms of World PvP and gold farming in your opinion?
---
Lock is still pretty underpopulated. Even on the recent guild we are formulated most classes have 4-7 people tallied. Locks are at 2-3.   
---
Locks provide more support and have the demonic aspect. If you like to be a ranged player with support abilities and being demonic go with lock.   
---
If you like being a sneaker asshole go for rogue, ain't nothing wrong with that
---
As a mage with a pally tank in a dungeon you can immediately start blizzarding after they pull and drop consecration but with a feral you’ll have to wait for enough rage for multiple swipes to go off.
---
Everyone else pretty much covered it. I'd like to add that positioning (yours, your team's, and the mob's) is the most important thing.
---
Beware the wrath of the Retbull with that changes opinion ;)
---
Bc, still relevant I felt.
---
unsubbed from youtube
---
Into the Maw of Madness (elite quest in Silithus). FUCK that shit.
---
All the more reason to hold off on having kids. I'll be in a better financial position anyway.
---
Hey, show Drek'thar the respect he deserves! 
---
Though to be honest I've always wanted Saurfang as Warchief.
---
druids are very rare
---
but they are also is very low demand like a raid maybe carry 1 maybe 2.. cuz they are used for utility and not their raw numbers
---
shaman / paladin may be  a better option
---
btw druids for 5 mans kinda suck if they cant rez. U gonna have to wait for whoever died to make their way back in.
---
Letting the goblin go from the shackle in DM North should give rep even in vanilla I think?
---
Only if the wand is next to it :'( Melee/Wand cycling was pro strats since they were on two different attack cooldowns. 
---
all the chicken escort quests are terrible. even with a group of two they're a serious challenge.  even still, i do them all on every character so i can get that pet that i'll never use...
---
I'm really tempted by rolling a mage. They do sound great in many different aspects of the game.  Self sufficient and efficient class with lots of utility. Certainly sounds good.  
---
What do you think about going skinning on a mage, for that AoE grinding while leveling and at 60? Maybe paired with Tailoring or Enchanting?
---
They can't fathom that casuals have legitimate complaints about some of the vocal toxic attitudes of minmaxers, and justify the hate by brushing casuals off as "jealous."
---
No! I am not prepared!
---
Just kiss already.
---
Yes i agree, flying mounts and also the overkill of just regular mounts. How many mounts can one have?? they're turning out the most ridiculous looking mounts that you can buy with 5 gold or actual real like $$$$$ like wtf. All these crazy ugly things i see people riding around on... I miss the actual challenge of having a lvl 40 regular ground mount.
---
Well it's Vanilla WoW running on the Legion engine. So I bet it'll be less taxing than how taxing Legion is - dare I even say I think with the updated engine it's going to run better than vanilla ran from 1.0 to 1.12.1.
---
gaining continues currency for turning them in is most likely a bug on the private server you know from... Those were for reputation. But i might be wrong. Did you play back then?
---
Are Spriests able to farm gold in any way decently? I know they have their limitability in raids, although I suppose dungeons they are fine? Also, warlocks; how do they fare in gold farming during leveling and at 60? Warlocks looks fun, but I've read somewhere that their leveling spec should be Affliction only. Are their other specs viable in leveling, World PvP, BG's and dungeons?
---
Can't tell if this is a serious response or if you're actually brain dead.
---
There's a difference between expansions every 2-3 years and a silver gold edition of a game that's prioritizing on giving you extra benefits the more money you spend.
---
Why do people think it’s one or the other?  
---
“Welp I have CHILDREN now so that means no more VIDEO GAMES”.  
---
The hell?  
---
GAME WITH YOUR CHILDREN. They’ll love you forever. First thing my dad did when he got home from work everyday was play Goldeneye or Mario Kart with me and my brothers. My dad is who showed my my first game, something on his old Intellivision. He was the one who kept track of all those damn level codes on NES and SNES games for us. And he made sure we always had the latest hardware (I’m sure mainly because he wanted them just as bad). I owe my entire gaming career to my dad.  
---
Be a cool dad, not a square dad
---
The only problem with wall climbing on top of .Org was that when you got on top of the gate or wherever you were, people often couldn’t see you due to how bad the draw distance was.
---
I remember being on top of the gate and being like “check me out” only for no one to notice. I then took off all my equipment and jumped to my death to save time.
---
best tauren ever*
---
BFA is doing amazing btw
---
warlock for the cheap mounts and the sm/ruin spec works for pvp and pve
---
What were you pointing at?
---
And don’t tell me “yonder”.
---
&gt;If it was f2p itd be half decent I guess.
---
Ngl. I only checked it out because I expected it to be F2P after how bad Division 1 was... LMFAO.
---
Good points
---
I don't know of anyone on private severs that didn't understand the difference between a patch and a client version. There was so much debate on ps discords about what was and wasn't actual progression and correct for the patch you would have to have been living in a box to get them confused. 
---
human sword spec is great but what if u  will go daggers later?
---
ret bulls will love those things
---
rogues rarely even fight other rogues tbh so its not a big deal
---
anyway dwarf racial also helps much vs rogue
---
It is very doubtful if they will ever make a balance tuning pass again with their current guiding principles, but that conversation needs to be left for several years before being addressed at all.
---
Haha lol at Rogue part thanks. I really like stealth though and dont mind the harder leveling part of a rogue
---
Drek'thar is a champion of the horde and under High Overlord Varok Saurfang's administration he will be treated well. That being said we will not be placing a blind man at the head of an army. Like that incompetent buffoon thrall and his sycophants. Instead we will appoint Cairne Bloodhoof as war leader in AV. He has expertise in being high above sea level. He is the natural choice to lead a mountain engagement. 
---
The nochanges people ignore the fact that Vanilla was a moving target.
---
see the issue with vanilla is u need to pve to get good enough gear for pvp
---
The pissed ones have to be the ones that want their rewards as fast as possible, not interested in the gameplay that AV offered.
---
Alliance could get up there’s too. Beautiful, wasn’t it?
---
When did I ever say or claim to be "no changes"?
---
Classic will 100% guaranteed have a lot of changes compared to retail. That doesnt mean we should add freaking TBC talents to classes.
---
Sadly you won’t be able to waljump at all in classoc
---
So am kinda having an identity crisis :p Always played Horde apart from one alt. Seriously considering Alliance this time. New(ish) experience vs nostalgia. Group alts logically vs loyalty to the Horde.
---
And it gets more complicated if we consider the possibility of TBC transfers down the line.
---
Warlocks are excellent in PVP both world and battlegrounds. They are one of the best 1v1 classes if played correctly. Gold farming they are fantastic too because with lifetap and life drain, you never have top stop. You even have your own personal tank (void walker).
---
why not rogue?
---
Umbra and I and a small team have been working on a new alliance guide for the last 2 1/2 years. It’s nearly done; we’re finishing 55-60 at the moment. I’ll be posting once we launch it and patrons will be able to get it early enough to practise 👍 for the alliance!
---
Can't Allylocks go destro and use stuns instead then? Or is that not considered viable?
---
I do believe it's for dramatic effect.
---
A couple obvious things standout to me. Here's my personal list:
---
WotLK: 
---
       - Dungeons and heroics become VERRRY easy. Heroics dropped purples which meant have epic gear meant a lot less. 
---
       - Dungeon Finder. Less interaction with the world, less social presence.
---
       - Raids having multiple difficulties. It wasn't that bad in WotLK with only normal and heroic, but raiding started to become a grind.
---
Cataclysm: 
---
Most rogue fights favor whoever gets the opener since they set how the fight goes and can even kill you within the stunlock. Breaking bleeds/poison won't save you much other than to run away from dying. Perception also helps in AB and Wsg for scoping out rogues defending a node or flag 
---
Oh good another thread shitting on the people who loved this game so much they managed to convince blizzard that it should be officially recreated.
---
warlock is weaker in group pvp
---
warrior gold farm sucks
---
congratz u r a mage
---
Don't know. I never rolled destro pre-wotlk.
---
From what I've seen, destro relies on succubus charm into soulfire like combos. 
---
Absolutely agree. When you walk into a town and someone is on a flying mount that takes up half the screen and looks like a rainbow exploded.....you have to question the integrity of the game.
---
Pretty sure most people would consider going from pve to pvp an exploit. One some people justify because it's an exploit that involves money. No thanks an exploit is an exploit.
---
which rogue and warrior race looks best in the t0 or t0.5?
---
For me, as soon as the grind was taken away I lost interest. 
---
Flying in wow is basically just "swimming" in the air aka god mode. If they instead had implemented it like in[this quest from Cataclysm](https://youtu.be/V1ymqySDtAQ?t=11) it could've been way more fun and also prevented people from just afking in the air while on auto-run.
---
He is absolutely right. I've had to travel over seas for my job before too. And people back home think that its great but the entire time you're gone all you wish for is the time to spend with the people you really care about. 
---
It's funny cause now my circle of friends... 95% of them are from wow, and about 85% of them are from vanilla wow. Both my online and IRL friends. No one aspect of my life has brought me more lasting friendships. It is an extremely powerful game because of it.
---
Anything your character does in WoW is caused by an API call, which is basically an instruction telling the server what to do with your character.  Using a spell?  API call.  Moving?  API call.  The protected ones are the ones the player and their addons aren’t allowed to call themselves.  So for example, you can’t use the text command to move forward, you have to actually press a key keybind and the client handles it for you. 
---
Otherwise, you could write an addon that would basically be a bot, moving and reacting based on a script you wrote.
---
Drek'thar tamed an ENTIRE VALLEY of neurotic Thunder Lizards you damn ingrate. If Rexxar were here he'd put you in your place. 
---
One, love the division with labels. Cringey fuck.
---
Two, you’re right - but a moving target along the vanilla scale is a lot different then asking for non-vanilla things such as changing specs for “balance”. 
---
Move on out 
---
Unless I am remember Dishonorable kills it's even worse then that. Because  90% of horde NPC are marked honorable to kill. While almost 90% of the alliance ones would get you dishonored. 
---
At first I was like “Ha’ look at this idiot” then I was like “oh damn, I’ve been there”
---
I'm all for classic but let's be honest here, the majority of the people, both current retailers or those who are just kinda curious won't find this game appealing. Too slow, complete lack of QoL elements and instant gratification. Most people who don't know what they're signing up for will burn out before lvl 20.
---
All in all I think classic will be successfull in its own right, but probably won't outdo retail. that's just tailored for today's needs.
---
I'm thinking of playing a priest. I want to Pvp as shadow mainly, but also not against healing. What is it like to heal in Pvp as a priest? Is it enjoyable? 
---
Then everyone's roll night elf female priest so they can fap to their naked character between raids. Because someone else will roll dwarf.
---
This is what I wonder all the time.
---
I think it's possible, but not likely. 
---
It would be pretty damning of Activisions entire model though if it were the case, and if that were so, it could change the course of gaming marketing (just as WoW and Blizzard have changed the course of gaming multiple times in the past). 
---
And some of the other places too. Small dancing troll village above Feralas. Also Hyjal. Don't they let us continue access. 
---
Wow, 2/10? that just goes to show how delusional you are. I'm surprised you have upvotes. Nice bias you got there.
---
Well I am gonna main Shaman and do a lot of PVP. Keybinds are gonna be fun 
---
1.12 introduced cross-realm battlegrounds for example and yet oddly people who fall into the no changes camp seem to really want that to be left out.
---
Also, they have labeled themselves this way. Go cringe somewhere else.
---
Especially since all future DLC is free, and the game is leaps and bounds better than D1
---
As I said, no one questions Drek's valor in battle. What we question is why a blind man was left in charge of an entire army? Drek still prolly thinks the waterfall is a choke point. As far as he's concerned he's never seen any one walk up it so his fort is fine. He has had 15 years to shore that shit up. Yet here we are. 
---
I'm part of #nochanges but amuse myself thinking of what changes *I* would make. . . something like having each battlemaster at each world portal would be cool. AV/AB/WSG master at each - Ashenvale, Alterac Mountains, and Arathi Highlands. . . then maybe phase into major cities having the battlemasters. 
---
Got enough UI there, bub? 
---
Battlemasters were added for a reason. Just like how av was changed for a reason. Funnily enough the same reason X realm bgs were added. The reason is pvp had very low participation in vanilla with high effort and frustration for low rewards. You can add things as they were originally if you want, but I guarantee it will go the exact same way in Classic.
---
They nerfed AV.
---
All right cool, give me seal of fury. After all it was vanilla.
---
Defining what is and what is not vanilla according to your own personal hot take on what vanilla was is irrelevant. We do not know what blizzard has in store, and I very strongly suspect that when classic goes live or shortly after that point there will be major hybrid viability changes.
---
Awesome man! Were can I check for updates for your guide?
---
Just think... It could have been a tauren girl.
---
A blind man nearly defeated Arthas at Ice Crown Citadel! 
---
You underestimate Drek's intelligence (I mean, it's his main stat afterall), his stratagems may be too complex for your puny ogre-brain to comprehend. 
---
Because these decisions were likely made prior to Classic being announced.
---
Also, raising your kids in an Alliance household is tantamount to child abuse.
---
"but dad we have homework!" 
---
"Keep mining Timmy! Shut up Sarah!"
---
"Daddy I'm hungry!"
---
"What are you talking about honey the well fed buff is right there now keep fishing deviates!"
---
Rewards ruined PVP.
---
yea in a way dwarf racial is more reactive
---
and percep is proactive
---
dwarf also helps much vs ud priests and warriors tho
---
We’re just setting up a page, all the work to now has been on developing and testing. I’ll post on here and also dm you when the page is up 👍
---
With all of this said, I will be using add-ons.  lol.
---
The return of battle groups is literally the only reason I'm rolling on classic. Let's hope they stay.
---
As someone who had a kid in a loveless marriage, got divorced after 8 years and now live in a miserable middleground between having a kid and beingsingle; trust me dude, we only want what we don't currently have. Maybe this guy really is happy with his life, but even if he wasn't, he would say he is because he wants to be and to convince himself he is.
---
Just enjoy what you have before you lose it.
---
If I didn't see your character name, I would think it was a shot I did back in vanilla! :D
---
I'd never make it to 60.
---
If you’re worried that there will be too many rogues, just put in the work to be better than the other ones. If you understand the class well and are in a good guild, it’s fun.
---
Wow toxic...
---
The point being to any new player not buying a game because “therzz soo meny version to get!!!” Like you said could be applied to wow. Simple as that... spaz 
---
The man the myth the legend, awesome. Have you considered alternate starts via exploration aka "Fed-Ex" for horde in case of over populated starting zones at launch?
---
Yes. Dampen magic is used frequently in solo play and amplify magic has its place in group play. If you expect to take magic damage then dampen magic is great. If you're doing a dungeon and there isn't much incoming magic damage then amplify magic on the tank is great.
---
Mana shield is mostly an emergency spell or for PvP use. You don't take spell pushback while it holds which is a nice perk for frost mages before they get ice barrier or when it is down.
---
* Dungeons and heroics become VERRRY easy. Heroics dropped purples which meant have epic gear meant a lot less. 
---
* Dungeon Finder. Less interaction with the world, less social presence.
---
* Raids having multiple difficulties. It wasn't that bad in WotLK with only normal and heroic, but raiding started to become a grind.
---
* Raid finder. This is, in my opinion, the single greatest mistake blizzard ever made. It invalidated the need for a guild for a lot of people, it made epics braindead easy to get, and it added another difficulty of raid that you were almost required to do if you wanted to gear efficiently.
---
WoD:
---
* Garrisons. Nuff said.
---
* Mission table stuff was somewhat of a mindless activity that wasn't THAT bad. It was a somewhat satisfying system, although the gold output from missions made it not a good move and it was another chore that you had to keep track of. This was the first expansion where I became rich as fuck for doing very little. Gold inflation was real.
---
Legion:
---
* Artifact weapons. You wield the same weapon the entire expansion, so bosses no longer drop weapons for you to upgrade. Very unsatisfying and took away a big part of gearing up. Also the name of famous weapons like Ashbringer became meaningless since every paladin now has one. Kinda lame.
---
* Legendaries. Just when I thought the color of your gear couldn't get anymore meaningless.
---
* Lots of people liked legion for the storybuilding and content progression and what not, but I didn't much care for the world quest system. Basically worse version of dailies where it became an annoying chore to do every day. Also, my class (sub rogue) was gutted during the time I played this expac so I didnt have much fun with it, obviously didnt play much of other classes so YMMV.
---
BfA:
---
* World quest system still annoying as fuck
---
* Artifact necklace and artifact gear is very unsatisfying mechanic and heavily RNG based. 
---
Honorable mentions and misc:
---
* Class homogenization was a real killer, not sure what expansion this started with. I'm glad I see other comments about this because this one is huge. 
---
* World of Portalcraft. Somewhat necessary with all the new zones, but traveling was sooo effortless it made the world much smaller.
---
* Dual-spec lessened player identity. I can see how you could argue for this one though.
---
For that classic wow experience 
---
Private server stats all have hunter as the 4th most popular class.
---
Ne hunter was probably a pretty high percentage of the race/class combos because hunter was the 4th most popular class and then only other option was dwarf.
---
Delusional for having an opinion about yet another lazy, bland looter shooter? Do you think anthem is above average too lol? Sorry if using the whole scale offends you, but these new "AAA" games arent average even on a good day lol
---
The fact Drek's highest stat as an enhance shaman is intelligence kind of says everything. Dude has been losing the same engagement for 15 years because he's too blind to see. His shit ass base has more holes then Swiss cheese. Also his strategy is as he put it peeling an onion. You everything about that physiologically dude has no eyes. So onions never make him tear up. Now he wants everything to be like peeling an onion. Well guess what Drek just because you have no eyes don't make every problem an onion.
---
I'll be burnt out like hell by the time I even get to Naxx
---
I notice that your 1-12 guides direct all alliance players to Darkshore. Since Mages, Paladins, and Warlocks cannot train in Darnassus, do you still recommend going to Darkshore for them?
---
It also might be neat to suggest the Dun Morogh to Menethil shortcut (jumping up the mountain next to Gnomer and dying once you zone into Wetlands). I have personally found this to be faster than running through Wetlands and aggroing every crocolisk
---
Eh, I don't think you can paint them all with the same brush like that.  
---
Most of the people I saw getting pissed, and something that would irritate me occasionally, is when a push fails and your side just kinda "gives up" and people stop working together or coordinating.  That is what I saw piss people off the most.
---
That and people not guarding goddamn towers.
---
Making thing more casual friendly but by casual I don't mean bad player but rather player that didn't have enough time to play WoW in the first place. (or should I say, didn't have enough time to take part in more time consuming activities in WoW... because back in Vanilla, there were a lot of casuals (people with little time on them) who still enjoyed what Wow offered them)
---
Taking dungeons for example, they became less time consuming, making it that anyone with half an hour of time can run one. But with that "doing the dungeon" became a quick minigame, instead of epic DnD-like adventure that Wow was trying to replicate. The classic dungeons were hardly "just dungeons" in retail standards. They involved a lot of steps. 
---
Step one, grabbing the quests, 
---
Step two, gathering your party before venturing forth.
---
Step three, actually doing the dungeon which while not necessarily difficult was definitely a time consuming effort that required solid teamwork. And only at the end of this long journey would you be rewarded with some items.
---
Basically Wow, (and MMO-genre that tried to replicate it as whole) they all lost sight of what MMORPG should have been about and instead focused on end game content which consisted of multiple instanced mini-games that could be repeated times and times again.
---
Other than making it less time consuming, the other biggest fault I would point out is that WoW, instead of adding new content would rather focus on replacing it instead. By that I mean "each new expansion, each new patch, most of previous content becomes irrelevant. Like this we arrive at unbelievable situation where a new player might end up with nothing to do after playing the game just for a month or two... nothing to do despite having 15 years of content. 
---
1.12 AV on p-servers are 15-20 minute rushes ~90% of the time, it's not really up for debate. They can drag if neither team has a tank or if one team decides to turtle after wiping. 
---
&gt;raids and I'm assuming I'll go deep into the Protection talent tree
---
prolly not
---
Haha, one of my friends used to do this, and one of my favorite memories is him delaying logging out because he couldn't find a bed and the rest of us making fun of him on Ventrilo.
---
I have managed to find situations where they are useful when playing a mage but in a classic wow podcast, Kevin Jordan, the lead class designer of vanilla wow said that those are his two least favourite abilities in the game. Personally i don’t mind them but i think they are not important spells and they add a bit a flavour to the class but often go unused. 
---
Sure hope all those Warriors can find tanks for their dungeons!
---
You don't need prot talents to be a main tank. Fury warriors and arms can tank just as well. Having last(final?) stand is useful however. 
---
Dampen magic is very useful for pvp.
---
Also there's elementals that do purely magic damage and you can aoe farm them by using dampen magic making you almost immune to damage.
---
Amplifiy is hardly used though, you can use it on very few bosses (they need to do only physical damage), and buffing people up takes a while. 
---
Maybe you could be like a flag carrier or AV tank. But you don’t do a lot of damage, and would otherwise be useless. 
---
&gt;  just put in the work to be better than the other ones.
---
in translation this means working for more buffs/consumables and buying bis boes
---
Saying things were changed for a reason completely blows past the fact. No one on here thinks those changes played out well over time. 90% of the changes wow made. Are the cure being worse then the disease. Looking at you LFR/LFD
---
Regarding mana shield, that spell is very useful. Because you have mana agates (generated mana pots) and evocation which refills your mana, mana shield can allow you to mitigate a lot of damage and then quickly recover while your enemy is frozen or polymorphed
---
I've mulled over the idea of expansions re-tuned and redesigned with vanilla mechanics. I think it would be awesome, personally.
---
Stuff like no flying could work just fine. We could replace flying with gold sinks that unlock portals, taxis, and other means of quicker travel to reach destinations previously only accessible by flying.
---
If Blizz releases expansion servers I think they should prioritize catering to the players who want those respective expansions' original experiences as they were when they were relevant. But I would love to see a project--either official or unofficial--that basically ports later content into the vanilla client and makes it work according to vanilla rules and design philosophy.
---
Druid aquatic form took me most of a day doing it at lvl 16.  So much running.
---
The OP is using a strawman and attempting to blame pserver players for getting 1.12 AV because they somehow came to the idea that pserver players want 1.12 AV. And their logic for that is because pservers are on the 1.12 client, therefore they also want 1.12 AV because it also has 1.12 in the name?
---
That's what I got from the OP's word diarrhea. Then again, it's not the first time I see that user sperging out about pservers.
---
Actually , MoP&amp;Cata storyline were quite good, but the local quest were freaking boring.
---
My priest is going to turn 99% of his magical loot into dust and there's nothing you can do about it.
---
They're using the modern client and API, so no, a lot if not all of your addons will break.
---
That said, many of them will probably be ported to the classic client. You will probably be able to recreate your UI.
---
They removed too many RPG elements and put too much emphasis on the theme park aspects of the game. Now it’s like they want everyone on the exact same ride progressing at the exact same pace and it all feels way too transparent. 
---
&gt; All right cool, give me seal of fury. After all it was vanilla.
---
Straw man
---
Personally, I would love to have a true progressive Vanilla experience starting at first patch.
---
&gt; Defining what is and what is not vanilla according to your own personal hot take on what vanilla was is irrelevant. 
---
I was quoting Blizzard.
---
&gt; We do not know what blizzard has in store,
---
We know for a fact that they will not att TBC talents to Classic. We know for a fact that they want to "create an experience that feels just like 2006 World of Warcraft".
---
&gt; and I very strongly suspect that when classic goes live or shortly after that point there will be major hybrid viability changes.
---
You can suspect whatever you want. Blizzard have said that "first and foremost is authenticity as our goal". This is a FACT.
---
Did you even watch the video from Blizzcon?
---
Here it is again: https://youtu.be/hhKkP8LryYM?t=1811
---
That makes sense. Thanks for the response!
---
If they plan on keeping the sharding at launch, I don't think this will be an issue honestly. Maybe you skip eg the drawf/gnome collect the 3 toolboxes quest but the rest should be doable
---
That’s awesome. I remember Nigma. Split off from Tyranny(Doomsaws and execute!) 
---
I was also on BL for awhile when they were at their peak. Was in Stormwind Vanguard. 
---
There were so many big guilds on BL back then. Kirin Tor led by Octavian the famous, Og, Ropetown, Tyranny, Nigma, and of course Clan Seks/Zeksonic Legion. I’ve still got a pic saved somewhere from when us alliance guys met in Stormwind around January 2005 to follow Octavian on a giant raid on Tarren Mill. Then we get there and get annihilated by guys like Durn and Dingler who already had epic mounts farmed. 
---
Definitely. My main reason for recommending human was OP wanted to be competitive for dps as well and you're not gonna out dps an equally geared human. The racial is too strong for pve
---
Definitely, it's just a back up plan *in case* shards are still very populated. Going from completely unplayable (100s of players) to even  70-100 in a single zone could still make Fed-Ex worth it (possibly- hence the theorycrafting)
---
In my opinion. 1.15 is the significantly better version of AV. That being said a lot of people hate it so blizzard changed it to what it is in 1.12, which now means pretty much everyone hates it but, at least you can loot piniata through it in a week end. My opinion is simple I am not raging but if you are going to put the 1.12 Av in instead of the 1.15 version. You might as well call it a failed bg and not drop it at all and plug the rewards in somewhere else. Rather then forcing me to play the 1.12 shit bg at all.
---
All 1.12 AV means to me. Is it will drop I will play it till I am exhulted then avoid it like the plague. Like 99% of other horde players.
---
It kicks ass in Alterac Valley. Especially at the choking points. Stand back and keep everyone alive.
---
Outside of tanking bosses in AV, which can be done by dps warriors with some tank gear, you'll be completely useless as prot.
---
u can tank 5mans with a dps spec
---
Arrogance and condescension. Blizzard always believed that new design was necessarily better than what had come before. When confronted by players praising older design choices, their response was always something like "You think you do, but you don't," or "Would you rather have Classic AV, or more robust new holidays?"
---
Do you know about if you can use the same talents for both modes? And gear? 
---
priests are great pvpers especially horde
---
As from a today's POV I highly dislike the idea of spamming manually for hours in the chat what I am looking for. But I like the idea of setting up your group in the Group Finder and let other people sign up for that.
---
Heart says warrior. Best class fantasy. Look coolest. I enjoy tanking, fury DPS endgame would be fun too.
---
Brain says druid or shaman. Reasonable leveling speed. Much better solo. Can still tank as druid. Either probably better at farming. Probably easier to gear. There will be a metric fuckton of warriors.
---
My roomate is rolling priest. I think we'll be doing a lot of duo leveling. Pretty sure warrior+priest is the dream team duo.
---
I have a 35 warrior on pserver which I feel like is through the worst of it. Bout to get Whirlwind, and then Mortal Strike pretty soon.. I'm sure it still sucks post 40 but I should at least have some better options by then.
---
So... should I follow my heart or is my brain on to something here?
---
