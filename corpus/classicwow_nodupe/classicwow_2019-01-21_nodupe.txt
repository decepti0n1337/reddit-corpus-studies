While leveling you'll just want a cat with a fast attack speed to proc the Frenzy talent more often. Really easy to get one with [1.2 speed](http://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/attackspeed.php). At max level what three pets you will want depends on what your priorities are but for the most part differences in pets are pretty minor.

Overpowered really? Naxx gear seemed like a reasonable upgrade from previous tiers, and in some cases, just as good. I don’t see blizz adjusting any of the stats. You sure your server didn’t tweak the values? 
---
Hey there! I’m definitely interested in joining when the time comes.
---
Yea, I looked at the atlas loot addon. I just noticed that I think the best staff from naxx increases spell damage by like 123? I think which is a huge upgrade from I think the 87 I think from AQ40
---
I didn’t read what my spells did so I would cycle through every single one...including kick
---
Something is araisng all right
---
What is wrong with the final bosses of the game offering the best loot?
---
Hello fellow WoW Classic enthusiasts... **It has begun**!
---

---
I decided to share my passion for the game with **you** by starting my own mini WoW Classic artwork series **here on this subreddit**.  I am trying to practice my drawing skills and create some fun images in  the process. They will be formatted in a simple way without any  watermark or signature in hopes to make them easier for you to save and  use as a wallpaper if you choose to.
---
Enjoy my fifth edition to the series - a human paladin in heavy plate gear going through rogues with a 1-hander and shield. This was mainly inspired by Zalgradis' old PvP videos from Vanilla. I hope you Paladin players out there like what I've made :P
---
For those interested, I will soon upload a timelapse of the painting.
---
Write  some feedback or suggestions for the next drawings. I want to hear some  of your cool and wacky ideas including your favourite characters and  gear. Thanks! :)

That's a huge no no. Naxx gear is fine, it's a progression of all the other gear as it should be. 
---
Constructive response from someone grasping onto their memories of the past. &lt;3
---
I’ll take sharding so I can actually play the game not stand around trying to tag mobs for 6 hours
---
I feel great about classic and can’t wait for launch, it’s going to be awesome.
---
I just don’t pay attention to people who think there is going to be a cash shop for boosts or WoW token, because they’re retards.
---
Back in my day we downloaded Teamspeak and then got yelled at when the raid leader used vent.
---
2. There is a good amount of gear that drops in raids and all other content with a wide array of stats. But apart from possible PvP use you won't want this gear. If you're healing you have healer gear, if you are farming or otherwise DPSing then you wear full DPS gear.
---
3. No. Casting anything without an instant cast time resets your swing timer.
---
As for the other questions, shaman is not a good farming class, but if you must farm then 30/0/21 is the way to go. I recommend doing dungeon runs as a healer with warriors for valuable items instead. 2 man DM E jump runs. Strath living righteous orb runs.
---
*DISCLAIMER: My experience is based on writing an addon for myself during Legion.*
---
**First of all,** there's an old book on writing addons called "World of Warcraft Programming, 2nd Edition" by James Whitehead &amp; Rick Roe:
---
&gt;http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780470481288.do
---
The in-game API might have changed since 2009, but the book still does a great job of explaining the basics.
---
**Secondly,** you should extract the default UI sources to serve you as a reference:
---
&gt;http://wowwiki.wikia.com/wiki/Extracting_interface_files
---
Overall, the default UI is a mess code-wise. If you're serious about writing a useful addon, be prepared that it might be frustrating at times to figure out how to program certain things with little to no documentation at your disposal.
---
What would the best support class be? (Horde or Alliance). I simply want to reach max lvl, help new players, and be the supporting role in a raid. I don't mind healing, but I don't want to be unable to farm gold either. If anyone can help that would be great :)
---
Thanks for all the responses guys. I appreciate it!
---
na i highly highly doubt they will try and balance classes. will cause to much of an uproar and buffing the lower dps in raids could cause them to overpowered in pvp. i think after vanilla is out for awhile and they go the route of expanding on vanilla then you could see changes. but outside of that i have full confidence there will be no balance changes
---
Is it equal? I would tend to disagree. I would say the competition for hunters is far less on Alliance, where most guilds are filled with human rogues fighting for swords. There are far fewer dagger rogues in Alliance raids which means that scooping up daggers is far easier for hunters. That being said a hunter has very little competition for loot. You essentially wear your tier set, get your quest bow and then are limited to very specific "hunter items" while only sharing your rings/necks etc. The BWL cross bow is "hunter loot" and so and so forth... You only have a handful of ranged weapons during your raid run and they are all "hunter only" with the only shared concern being your melee weapons. I suppose most hunter loot concerns are much tamer in a true progression guild where items are distributed by their value for the raid. As someone who mains hunter, I have never had many concerns obtaining items on Alliance or Horde but tended to gear easier/quicker on Alliance. Hunter present very little issues when it comes to gearing IF everyone understands the hunters itemization. "PVP items" like AshKhandi can be better served as a hunter stat stick in most circumstances in an effort to keep other weapons away from the hunts instead of going to a Ret who is providing subpar numbers or a warrior who intends to PVP on the weekends or perhaps a main tank who wants something to grind gold with...
---
And is that /r/karmabait ?
---
Prot warrior. There are never enough tanks for max level dungeons. Or you could go mage and sit in a city all day handing out free food/water and portals at reagent cost.
---
Don't discourage posting!
---
Naxx gear is fine. Maybe some tuning is off on pservers? I don't remember it being too much of an issue bAcK iN tHe DaY
---
Time zone?
---
April/May for an August/September release is my guess.
---
April/May
---
It was so fine, that only Naxx gear haven't been replaced till lvl 70 in TBC
---
‘You think you do but you don’t’ unirionically applies to a lot of people, let’s see how active it is in the 3rd month before getting ahead of ourselves 
---
TBC easy leveling? Took longer to get 1-70 than 1-60 by a long shot actually. Agree with the rest though. Personally the only things i want from TBC are the raid classes balance and arenas.
---
Wtf am I reading 
---
Thank you, this answers my disjointed questions about the usefulness of taming more than one pet. Thanks for the link as well!
---
 One thing I'm having trouble with is what you mean by the Frenzy talent. 
---
DW supremacy seems to be a myth. Check out YouTube, there are tons of 2h fury as top dps in all stages of raiding. 
---
Dual wield is more glamorous, but 2h needs less hit, 9 at most, so gearing efficiently is easier. 
---
I will probably be rolling either shaman or warlock and both of which have limitations to what I am allowed to do in a raid. Shaman will be healing and windfury totem, Warlock can't rely on dots (probably just curse of elements priority ) due to the debuff limit (I don't know if they are doing 8 or 16?).
---
I wouldn't say it's very armor type based though. Plenty of cloth bis for druids, pallies and shamans, as well as leather for hunters and dps warriors.
---
FERAL druids are very bad in group PvP. I kept leveling my druid on a pserver because I really enjoyed the feral rotation in PvE. But I felt very useless when I was playing WSG at level 49. Just imagine a rogue without vanish, blind, kidney shot (unless you switch to bear), kick (except feral charge/war stomp if you count that), or gouge. You might do some good DPS if nobody touches you, but I don't see why they wouldn't touch you since you're so vulnerable. And you can't use any items not equipped to you in form; that means potions, grenades and more. PvP also calls for an increased amount of shifting, either just to get energy from Wolfshead Helm or to get out of roots/snares, which is going to be very taxing on your mana since you probably don't have a lot of int gear.
---
If you're just gonna sit in bear form and be annoying, then you may as well go resto. You'd probably still do almost same amount of damage while in bear.
---
It's not that it's the best loot, the OP's argument is that it's so far beyond what the average player will ever see that it makes the playing field radically uneven to the point it's not fun.
---
TBC had some problems, that isn't what we are talking about. 
---
i wouldn't be surprised, but only blizz knows. aslong as it plays like classic im good 
---
what about bugs, glitches, or exploits?
---
Yeah sorry I meant to reply that to someone not to the OP 
---
In both TBC and Vanilla as Horde my guild had a guy who ran 2H Fury, we started it to optimize loot distribution (as it turns out actually using gear that drops and will result increased numbers is good even if it it isn't pure BiS material). It was fairly comparable. The annoying part is Slam resets your swing timer, but most melee classes need a swing timer add-on to optimize around anyway.
---
It wasn't a problem back in the day because raiding was essentially dead shortly after naxx came out. People were just waiting for TBC and farming rank 14 weps with honour. No one really knows what the game will look like when all the raiding guilds have 3+ months of Naxx farming beneath them.
---
Done it with 3 classes back in then, raid is even more of a joke. You guys need to get your head out of your ass. "WoW I have to pull 1 mob instead of 5! Vanilla so difficult!" 
---
yeah well we will see on that. theres already debate about wether or not the spamming x to get reckoning stacks from npcs will work (there was an exploit when spamming it would lag and the mob would crit you when you were standing up to get a reckoning stack) i have a feeling blizzard will fix that and thus nerfing reckoning. also druids could use savory delight in forms and im myself wondering if that will be removed for being an "exploit" i hope it stays and will be mad if its "fixed"
---
CC! Now I can cast sheep and continue spamming frost bolt on skull! So difficult!
---
I played a warlock to 60 on a vanilla server recently and the pets definitely all talked. My voidwalker was *always* saying "I... am... void... where prohibited" 
---
The vast majority of gamers are young men. 
---
I'll bet you money this bimbo doesn't even know what classic WoW is 
---
Depending on what weapons drop, I'll probably switch between a DW and 2H fury warrior several times over the course of Classic.
---
My main characters name is that I have used since EverQuest has been Ephron.  A new i got from the Suikeodon II random name generator.  I saw it and fell in love.  Used it since 200 anytime I play a warrior type.
---
If I played alliance you'd have yourself a prot war lol.
---
Don't worry about it too much. Naxx is not going to be the steamroll people seem to think it i will be. 
---
Oh. My apologies. Thanks for helping. 
---
Est. sorry for not clarifying.
---
Alliance is better anyways. ;)
---
No.
---
Nothing will ruin classic faster than tokens. 
---
Not an argument. 
---
Besides, we all know it's coming. You crusty old farts who played back in 2004 aren't the base Blizzard is playing towards.
---
It's time you guys just accept the change that will be needed to keep this game alive
---
Why do you think Blizzard is pushing for Bnet integration? 
---
Tokens, tokens, tokens! 
---
No. 
---
Those quests were added in a later patch right? Maybe Im wrong, but I thought those quests get patched in the later patches of vanilla.
---
I want to say I remember just grinding the furbolgs, then one day, quests were available for faction.
---
Again, not an argument. 
---
I can't wait to see your faces when based Blizzard adds these awesome new additions to their store.
---
The salt will be amazing. 
---
any queue longer than 1-3 min is absolute unrealistic. I can remeber 4h and longer queues and longer on Frostwolf. no one would w8 so long today
---
We actually ARE the base. The entire reason classic is coming back. If change is what you want, retail is there for you. 
---
You have exactly what I'm talking about. 
---
I'm totally not in favour of messing around with what was the best part of world of warcraft. 
---
But yes some of that gear will be very very powerful.
---
When it is @ready
---
As a 27 year old "old fart" who played in 2004, the inclusion of tokens would singlehandedly keep me from ever playing.
---
Retail got BOOORING quick, I need something new to sink my teeth into and classic looks neat, but will need some changes to suit my style. 
---
Shitty bait, but got me to respond
---
&gt; raids consisting of 65% Warrior/rogue dps as opposed to anything else
---
I saw a grand total of 1 guild doing that on pservers when they were speedrunning BWL, and that’s because over half of their melees were rocking R14 weapons because it was *the* tryhard guild. Every other guild had a lot less melees, and you need to take into account that a chunk of the warriors are the MT/OTs and not dps. Melees become a lot less dominant in AQ and Naxx when casters replace their green spell power prebis gear and bloodvine set with raid gear that finally has good itemization. 
---
Every class has a spot in raids. Not every spec has a spot in raids. 
---
2h fury does more damage on multiple target/cleave fights like Lucifron, Gehennas or Fankriss and trash mobs.
---
DW still wins in terms of single target DPS assuming equal gear levels. Nevertheless, both specs do top-tier damage and are perfectly viable and welcome.
---
There were a couple of "hints" pointing towards [July 16](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9u755q/classic_release_date_july_16th_2019/). Interpret it as you will.
---
Horde fury warriors with Ragnaros' Sword are the single best damage dealers in the game far into AQ. You fill all your globals with atleast hamstring and do an outrageous amount of damage because of windfury. The only reason others start catching up is that the sword loses potency over time compared to what's available and bosses start having more and more downtime.
---
Having both two-handed and one-handed warriors makes gearing less annoying for everybody.
---
Locks dots are pretty garbage outside of Corruption if you’re SM/Ruin, because it can proc instant Shadow Bolts. You still need minimum 3 locks per raid to have curse of Elements/Shadows/Recklessness. 
---
Lock and Shammy are the two most sought after classes on horde side from my experience, so there’s that at least. 
---
They're not putting tokens in classic, holy fuck.
---
No way to tell atm. 
---
Lol are you serious. Might of Menethil made Warriors one shot people in BWL gear. The stat jump in Naxx is insane because they knew they were releasing TBC and just made everything in Naxx OP as shit. 
---
After like two months? You bet it will.
---
Buying token's or max level characters would be no different then letting people pay money to kill raid bosses, win pvp battlegrounds, it not only misses the point of the game but actively ruins it for those who don't do it.
---
The biggest thing people seem to miss about classic is that leveling from 1 to 60 is the experience. It can take months and is what a lot of classic players are looking forward to the most, raiding is only one part of it. Another part of that experience is also managing your money which as I understand it is way more important in classic then modern wow. You will need lots but have very little and will need to make a lot of smart choices along the way if you want to afford your mount at 40. Maybe thats a pain to you but something I and many others really enjoy.
---
Token's will inflate the cost of everything in the auction house making grinds for cash absurd, I'd rather deal with gold seller spam then that. And yes gold sellers will exist but buying gold from them will get you banned, and the few that don't get banned are to small to have an effect on the overall economy.
---
If you have a problem with that, then classic might not be for you.
---
Nah rogues and warriors just blow up out of proportion with Naxx weapons and everyone felt that in the bg:s before TBC release. 
---
He is telling you pretty clearly what the problem will be in classic when some people have Naxx on farm. Naxx gear is literally like a lvl 70 character, because some classes like Warriors scaled insanely good with gear and Naxx gear is several tiers above even AQ.
---
People just don't remember because no one was even raiding Naxx back then, since TBC was announced. 
---
They failed the mention the biggest con. Players could buy coins in retail, redeem for $15 battlenet funds, spend a little more and buy a coin for classic and sell that for gold. Effectively trading retail gold for classic gold.
---
For that reason alone, coins won't be in classic.
---
Tally up the quests and see. Also the cloth turn-ins might be available at launch, there’s not any real reason to hold them back behind a progression gate.
---
Aside from the cloth turn-ins, there’s not much in the way of repeatable grinds for the main factions, which is why they were eventually added in vanilla. Only other repeatable quest that I remember you could do was the Morrowgrain quest for Darnassus rep.
---
I agree lol, there weren't too many videos of the event to choose from.
---
I've played where some people have Naxx gear. You're right it does change the meta of PVE and PVP and I don't see a problem with any of the vanilla meta's. If his problem is his class plays better in the earlier meta then tough luck later on. If anything people should be happy. Some of the useless specs early are actually viable in PVP later. I think PVP is more fun with higher gear and PVE become more competitive objectively. 
---
Hello everyone! I'm Avanti been playing WoW since vanilla I am currently in my mid twenties and am looking for a hardcore guild ( US ) that preferably 16hours a week.
---
I have raided every expansion and have been with some of the top US guilds just to list a few: Vision, Incarnate, SnF, and a couple more. I also have logs of current and past expansions along with kill dates matching up with the said guilds.
---
I am looking to play either Warrior or Rogue ideally. I do not mind tanking and am able to invest the allotted time in helping the guild at all hours of the day. 
---
Please don't have all your merits be based off private servers nor accolades of players.
---
I am also looking for a guild that plays more than just WoW in off nights once we finish grinding. I am Divine in Dota 2 and still actively play WC3.
---
If you believe we would be a good fit please feel free to DM me and we can discuss it further.
---
In this video we talk about implementing a thing they have no even remotely mentioned planning on implementing.
---
In my next video, we'll discuss buying T3 gear for $129.99
---
This should be a 5 second video.
---
"Should WoW tokens be implemented in Classic?"    
---
"No"    
---
"Tune in next week when we talk about Transmogs and Classic!"
---
That may be so. But I think blizzard will try to put them in 
---
Link?
---
I'm impressed. A 10 minute 28 second video on WoW tokens in Classic.  
---
Said it before, say it again: "Content creation" is a cancer to Classic.  
---
I will jump ship back to the private servers if they do. And I suspect many others will too.
---
We have the upper hand here if Blizzard fucks up Classic.
---
Cool! How'd you prevent the discs from falling? I have issues fixing posters in place within their frames.
---
No, unless the AV turn in quests that give rep are available.
---
Thanks for the free burning crusade code! Jokes on you!
---
Even with private server's highly inflated rep values, it's not possible (assuming no AV) (Also worth noting that private server's spill over reputation doesn't work, at least from what I could see)  
---
With the real rep values in Vanilla, it's going to be even less possible. But there may be a glimmer of light with spillover reputation, the problem is that you might out level your quests if you're doing every single zone. And by that point, you might as well just rush to 60 and farm the 800-1000g worth of runecloth.  
---
However, just because you can't reach exalted, doesn't mean you shouldn't still do all the quests. Each 100 rep quest you do is 2 stacks of runecloth submitted to the quartermaster.  
---
You don't think they would? It's a serious topic as is the cash shop
---
I played on nostalrius. Once we lose all our feet armor and pets would always look as enemies. But damn it was fun.
---
Oh come on.. there's a reason they themselves said no to this. Even Blizzard knows that having tokens in classic, where gear and resources are actually a big deal compared to retail.. would completely ruin classic WoW for not only the old players coming back, but for EVERYONE.
---
I think the new security, classic WoW being being fully supported by the modern client, etc etc. Is enough for Blizzard to control gold farmers on the couple of classic realms that will exist.
---
Those examples completely falsify the current situation that GW2 is actually in. Saying that you can't earn the skins in the game is wrong as you can both buy all of those skins from the Trading Post from other players and you can earn gems to spend on those boxes by spending gold (It's worth mentioning that the statuettes also guarantee you rewards from them). The issue here is that gold is the "only" reward in the game. Instead of attaching skins to content it's instead attached to a monetization model. 
---
And yes while the game hasn't seen any "dungeons" since release it has seen plenty of 5-man content through updates to fractals. But Fractals also barely have any rewards attached to it other than a few skins and mostly gold. Not to mention that any new rewards are never added to the individual releases in fractals (outside of the challenge motes), only ever overarching rewards. 
---
&gt; It's a serious topic
---
No. No it's not.
---
Hey can you provide a link for them saying no. Also, we agree with you in your point
---
It's a bit of a heated topic, most people seem hostile at even the suggestion of tokens being added. I have no strong feelings either way about tokens being added or not but I will say that they are a relatively reasonable solution to the third-party gold seller issue which is more harmful to the in-game economy than WoW tokens. A non-token related solution to third-party gold sellers would be nice.
---
I just traveled from NElf starting area to Echo isles to get my tiger. Was a fun trip only died like 6 times
---
Classicdb shows ~115 quests that give gnome rep, but I don't know that that will be enough.
---
BUT... Don't all major rep quests also give the other reps?
---
Like you gain 100 rep for doing Stormwind big quest - and you gain 25 gnomer / IF / Darnassus rep too.
---
You counting those?
---
Just a Vanilladrone in denial, let him be 
---
Idk why you’d leave your codes up on that for the internet not bright are you ? 
---
This is why I'm rolling RP server 100%. I've never been on one but I imagine there will be organized events that look a little like this on there. Cuz my PvP server had like nothing but gankz.
---
Well, you're entitled to your opinion
---
I believe they are included in the classicdb list, but I'll defer to you on that one:
---
https://classicdb.ch/?faction=54#quests:0+3+1+2
---
Good to know, thanks for the reply!
---
Free server migrations followed by server mergers.  Prepare for intense tears.
---
This is what I suspected - thank you for confirming. Let's hope those cloth quests are available!
---
Paladins and shaman are the absolute definition of support classes. They have an insane amount of utility between blessings and totems. This does make you mostly a healbot and buffbot but if support is what you want then these two classes are the best imo. They will have a harder time that most classes farming but on my experience making friends with a tank for dungeon runs or even simply farming herbs is still very good farming and very chill
---
[removed]
---
I remember not even being able to click to talk to them until grinding some rep
---
They don't have any value
---
Sure the weapons were great. But the DPS gear for warriors? I seem to recall most BIS was from before Naxx. 
---
Two days ago there was a dev interview where they talked about ensuring something as relatively unimportant as warlock demon despawning was correct to vanilla.  Based on the limited updates that we have gotten the evidence seems to strongly suggest they wouldn't add tokens.  I admit I didn't watch the video, but do you have a link to any real evidence for tokens or a cash shop?
---
I get that, I'm just providing my 2 cents based on my own experience. I would have played WoW a hell of a lot more over the years if it had some kind of free to play option.
---
You seem to be going down the it's either sub or it's free to play...there are models used in MMOs that are a mix of both. WoW already does that to an extent but one thing you haven't mentioned is content gated behind a sub fee.
---
Free players can do a sizable chunk of the game but to get involved further they have to sub. Star Wars The Old Republic does this and so does Runescape to give a couple examples. They use that method to varying degrees but the point is you can jump in and, play the game, see what the latest stuff is about and decide if you want to sub to do it....rather than coughing up a sub fee up front and then seeing what you're in for.  
---
I've played both SWTOR and Runescape recently (within last 6 months), subbed for a month of both. If they'd required a sub up front I wouldn't have touched either of them and they wouldn't have seen a single dollar from me.
---
Exactly my point, well put 
---
Not that I remember but hey it was over a decade ago. I guess it would depend on how geared people were.
---
They can be used for account recovery
---
They don't do anything at this point lol. Go ahead and try to register that.... 
---
They make an adhesive double sided sheet that you can cut to size for fine print framing. Usually they dont use that since it would essentially destroy the photo but I didnt figure I wanted these going anywhere so I just said screw it. 
---
FIGHT ME BRO 
---
Did you make this OP?
---
The whole point if vanilla is that you can get amazing loot from raiding to destory your enemies in pvp. Thats the satisfaction.
---
Ehhh grinding is for sure efficient as hell but I wouldn’t compare pserver farming to what an actual blizzard version would be if that’s what you are comparing it to.
---
Pservers resoawn rates were atrociously off and most have been found to have tbc rates of xp.  Not saying it isn’t the best way to level, just saying it’s a big ‘if’ on how efficient it really is.  
---
That said in interviews that Ghost simply wasn't fun to play. Would you have liked a game that wasn't fun to play?
---
For anyone who saw that DVD and is like, wait have I not seen that before?: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYxU7pIJHhk

Let's be real - plenty of people still enjoy it and have a good reason to do so. You can't literally call it garbage when things like Fallout 76 are a thing. Classic isn't going to be better than it in a good number of regards, while it will outshine it in others. 
---
Let's be real here. 
---
Yer a Jedi, Frodo.
---
My thought is that OP is dumb and I would not employ him.
---
Received quite a few requests and questions about my UI - so here it is! Planning on recreating it once Classic launches! :)
---
First, a bit of backstory: The long running warcraft series of games featured a war between 2 factions, A bloodthirsty group of orcs and their troll allies, and an alliance of 'good' races, think lord of the rings, but with a story that you could participate in. Up until warcraft 3, there was an 'evil' side, and a good one, but turning the world on its' head, the human campaign started with a story of a great promising prince being corrupted, paving his own way to hell through the best of intentions. It also painted the orcs in a more sympathetic light, The demons they summoned actually had control over them, and in fact they were once a peaceful race bound by honor. Bringing in additional factions, and making the world more real. This set the stage for what would become the world of warcraft. At the time MMOs were a very different genre, in fact, most were based on old MUDs, or Multi User Dungeons. You didn't need much story, you just needed monsters and a setting and people would come together to explore it. Most had sparse questing and were brutal if you died, often time dropping your whole inventory on the spot, AND causing you to lose precious exp. In addition, the monsters were tuned that after a certain point, if you didn't have help, you couldn't really solo. Then WoW launched. what was expected to be a game with subs in the 10,000s were in the 100,000s. The world was teeming with people and it was clear, the story laid down in warcraft was going to continue in this new type of MMO.
---
What made it great Part 1: The story was alive WoW had a rich quest system, often telling stories from zone to zone, it felt like the NPCs in world of warcraft mattered. NPCs had walk paths, including mobs, and often times groups of them would cluster around a campfire, or a lone humanoid enemy would run when he was in danger, giving him a feeling of wanting to live. Moreover, in addition to what would comparably look like a glut of content, between the large amount of questing and the group dungeons, the sheer number of players running around mining resources, getting exp or simply fighting off the other faction meant even in a run between two zones, even if not a single mob attacked or NPC called out for help, you may meet a dark stranger on the road, clad in foreign armor who offered you his boons, or shared a bit of food or treasure more suited to one of your skill. Warlock trainers were often squirreled away in a basement, rogues had a secret meeting location, class quests were bits of content, just for you because of how you chose to play. No two people finished exactly the same quests, so your entire story felt uniquely yours. If you got to raiding you became a champion of your faction by fighting the most deadly enemies along with a large group of other players, or maybe you became known for being a great crafter. Because of the way the servers were limited and only so many people could be in the same server, People developed there reputations. Maybe you raided barrens, and it always took several horde characters to take you down. Maybe you stole gear from dungeons and laughed about it. The point was, your story was carved onto the other stories that people made on the server.
---
What made it great Part 2: Risk verses reward When people talk about how people are going to quit because classic was too hard, I laugh a bit. As I had said, classic came out when games were tuned around group content, and soloing really wasn't a thing. I would say about 80% of classic content is designed for people to be able to consume solo, whether they do or not, is up to them. Mobs are roughly designed that they should be an even fight with players at their level, forcing players to spend about half of their basic resources to deal with them. 2 mobs? well that will put you close to death without a cooldown or consumable. If you fight higher level mobs, you take your life into your own hands, and if you fight lower level mobs, you should have it a bit easier. Since Humanoid mobs tend to bunch up, there are situations such as murloc coasts and bandit encampments early on that are a nightmare for players, and to make matters worse, often times, these are the sorts of places blizzard had decided to place chests. Getting a few players to help you means you can easily get the chest, but often times you have to share the loot. The best quests for loot and exp of any given level are often based around a dungeon, and dungeons can give amazing loot as well, but again, you have to share. Gating desires behind difficulty changes a players behavior. If you are skilled enough to engage multiple mobs,  you are rewarded with superior loot. If you can perform a role in a group not only can you get individual loot for a dungeon via questing, you also get a chance a great loot from the dungeon bosses themselves. This carries all the way into raiding, and the system was not much different for PVP. Do well, gain rank, get better stuff. You could kill boars all day in the forest 2 levels below you for exp, but if you were better at the game, you could fight greater enemies and gain better rewards. You didn't need to be better to see the world, but you wanted to be better, because being better had rewards. This was the balancing line that Classic drew. It was an easy enough MMO that anyone playing for long enough could see what they wanted to. They could corpse hop their way up Jintha'lor, but to complete the quest to gain the sacred hammer was something else entirely, and earning that meant that you could summon a boss in a dungeon halfway across the world. Classic WoW was hard if you are used to the mindset of more current games, but with no expectations is was incredibly easy to just level up, time consuming, but easy. But you didn't just want to level up, you wanted to be that dark stranger, who offered you gold on your way into orgrimmar. The one with the glowing swords, and the giant wolf mount. You wanted to be able to take those risks, because the rewards were so much better.
---
What made it great part 3: Faction vs Self The horde and the alliance had years of history before the game itself ever launched. Perhaps you came in with the same sense of loyalty towards the faction you played in warcraft games, or perhaps you came in blind, knowing nothing. Either way, the factions had very real identities set out, even in the early zone. If you were alliance, you were part of group of close knit allies, watching out for each other. It felt more like being a part of a family. If you were horde, the early quests let you know that you needed to earn your place. The horde didn't carry dead weight, and if you didn't want to be left behind you needed to step up and provide something worthwhile. Everywhere the two touched, there was conflict, even in a world filled with external threats. Rather then focusing on individual desires, it created a narrative as being part of a whole, and the focus on your specific character was lessened because of this. The war raged on without you, but you could be the tipping point in a battleground, but you weren't the entire conflict. Because of this, it gave group and dungeon content a feeling of being epic, grand in scale. Several of the finest warriors your side could muster against some great threat. large scale battles with other players felt like they helped the narrative. By contrast, it meant that a skipped quest wasn't the end for that NPC, if you left someone in a cage while clearing out quillboar, maybe someone else would come along and save them.
---
What made it great part 4: Scale What sells nearly every Elder scrolls game, and helps make games like fallout feel so grand is scale. The worlds are huge, with nooks and crannies and enemies abound. Warcraft has the sense of scale, with dozens huge zones that take several minutes to traverse. but it isn't just how far you can travel. Blackrock mountain is a massive feature that looms over you as you quest in searing gorge, so large in fact, there are several cities within its' massive stone form. there are entire zones that are just paths leading up to the peak of mount Hyjal. A single tree contains not only a capital city, but a starting zone and a full zone as well! Massive dragons hidden away in zones, guarding portals to the emerald dream, The tower of Karazhan, looming in deadwind pass. The scale and feel of this game with the variety of elevations and climates makes you feel small. With calls to adventure everywhere, it feels like you are exploring a full world.
---
In conclusion, Classic WoW was an experience, and one I don't think is well replicated by modern wow. All of these elements exist to a point, but the game has become more about shrinking the world. teleports, flying, looking for dungeon, all of these reduce the scale. Since looking for dungeon and raid are in, you don't have to find people to play with, since combat has been re balanced for you fighting multiple things, the danger element has changed. The story, while still being about conflict between the alliance and the horde has moved to you being the savior of the world, and quests have changed so that only things you do matter, making you the centerpiece of your faction. Since everyone is a hero, it kills the feeling of dungeons being about a group and more focus on the self, reducing anything dealing with the factions to feel like mere bickering. All classic content has either been scrubbed from the game, or, in the case of some dungeons and raids, rewritten to fit a more personal narrative. My goal wasn't to bash on Retail, but its' hard, because a game we love died for it.
---
Please use our stickied LFG post to advertise guild recruiting.
---
Will do. Thanks. :)
---
Every WoW is someone's first WoW, and if you are loving current retail, give blizzard some money, but I encourage you come summer to come roll a character on the classic servers. Maybe you can capture a bit of that magic that enchanted all of us when we first played it.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
BTW, This post was longer, because I tend to ramble, but I hit the comment character limit, clearly there is a lot to be said for classic. Feel free to chime in other things you really liked from vanilla, if you think I forgot something.
---
Post removed as bait/trolling. The OP is one thing, the comments made afterwards by the original poster were the nail in the coffin.
---
The cash cow utters of classic wow are so dry at this point 
---
Naxx gear is very powerful, and it does affect pvp. Players in Naxx gear will be nearly unkillable vs players in zg or mc gear, especially if they are in a coordinated goup. If you have a problem with that, vanilla probably isn't for you.
---
Also some of that gear will be needed to kill the last bosses in the dungeon. Most vanilla bosses aren't mechanically complicated, but some are tuned very tightly. Without the best gear available you can't beat dps timers or survive supposedly tankable hits.
---
Your suggestion of adjusting stats on gear would open a whole new can of worms. If Blizzard did that, Classic would be more like a funserver than vanilla.
---
Post removed. We don't allow advertising of merchandise. Sorry for the inconvenience.
---
Back in 2005 I farmed DM west, first boss, using the edges to jump up and down while dots killed him, made a decent amount of gold per hour
---
This is true just if the classic token will be the same as retail's token. If blizzard make classic token un-redeemable, this problem would be solved
---
Yes it's why the "fresh" meme exists... Naxx comes out and basically once the top guilds get geared, it becomes pretty unbalanced and not as fun. Fresh server comes along a bit after and everyone is starting from the beginning again, it's honestly so fun playing at release of a fresh server. The feeling never gets old cause it's like playing a sandbox game, same adventure with differences each playthrough to 60.
---
Can you also post a pic of those framed pokemon cards? :P
---
I thought in classic only Gnomes could ride the chickens as every other race is too heavy?
---
Just like Tauren can only ride Kodo and Wolves? 
---
Man those original vanilla discs make me nostalgic as shit.
---
If tokens are about to come, then it's going to happen somewhere after AQ40 or Naxx stage. 
---
Introducing them straight away would scare off too many people. Let's be honest, the vocal majority won't make it through AQ and even less of them would manage it into Naxx. And that's the time when the "Give me fresh realm" outcry begins, because people with considerably more powerful gear which is beyond casual reach start to show up. 
---
I always have a laugh when people mention the importance of gold in early-game context, mentioning one-time purchases like pre-bis gear or epic mount. You will get them quickly even if you just play the game casually, most likely within 1-2 weeks or even less if you make a lazy effort to save up.
---
The moment when gold really becomes an issue is AQ40 and Naxx. Blowing away 400-500g per raid is easy, and you have 2 or even 3 of them weekly. And that's where the real target audience appears and WoW token is ready to step up on the stage. And these people are caring more about clearing the content then defending the #nochanges.
---
To piggyback off of this... while vastly superior on horde, can 2h Fury be played on alliance to any effect?
---
Nope, dwarves could as well.
---
Shaman just for healing and nothing else, however :/. As another poster said "Every class has a spot in a raid but not every spec". I'm not hoping for super buffs or balance changes I just wanted to know what to expect blizzard would be trying to address or if they would literally just release 1.12.1 and call it good, wondering if they would do any future events or changes. I guess I will wait and see. 
---
The "con" about PvP at dire maul is so stupid! Like if half server will start to buy token (and be able to sell them).
---
Do you even know how the basic economic's rules works? And do you know that people that purchased golds where a thing in vanilla?
---
People speak about the token like if in vanilla people didn't already purchased golds! A "true vanilla experience" is with people that buy golds! Are your memories really so pink love love blurred?
---
 I'm against the gold purchasing in any form, but here we have a problem, and I prefer the better solution between gold sellers and tokens.
---
lol just because we didn't say "bis" doesn't mean vanilla players had no concept of an item being best in slot.
---
Wrath sucked.

Hello everyone. I'm not sure if this post is allowed, if it's not I apologize and will delete. 
---
I'm interested in getting some players together to start an alliance guild once Classic is released. The guild will be loosely based on the "Matilda Knights" from the game Suikoden 2. The Knights feature 3 branches of knights. The White Knights, Blue Knights and Red Knights. With each branch featuring it's own knight captain and co-captains.
---
I would like to set each one up for a different part of the game. (Maybe one for casual, one for PVP, one for raids/end game?) If anyone is interested, please reach out to me on discord. My username is Fu Su Lu#3717. If you have any questions feel free to reach out. 
---
Any suggestions or if you're interested in becoming a part of the Knights of Matilda, Just let me know! For the Alliance!
---
https://discord.gg/TWSNMhc

Dumbest shit I’ve seen in this sub
---
They should have used that as the class hall in legion for rogues. Damn dalaran sewers.
---
Go link yourself to them saying they want to provide an authentic vanilla experience and then link yourself to a dictionary to look up authentic. 
---
Never, WoW is vapourware
---
The purposes of the video is about fun and to build some hype around our project, it really have nothing to do with showing Individual skills. We hope you like it, we had a lot of fun making it, great experience for me personal but I can't take credit for all the work.    
---
Thanks to Skou for your work!    
---
 
---
I'm pretty sure that poster would be me :)
---
And Blizzard has said multiple times that they don't want to make changes. There might be some stuff that gets changed because we'll be using the modern client instead of the bugridden 1.12 client, but overall there should be very little changes and practically no balance changes.
---
This sounds like the best reasonable date for release. Personally good for me and my timeline of life events. I will be fully ready for classic come September after a big move and the DotA international
---
We already did this on forums back in the day....
---
We had the option to setup IRC chatrooms if we wanted too as well?
---
Discord isn't really that new the only thing it helps with is having a decent messenger service combined with a working VoIP and some integration with other stuff.
---
Fuck when we started MC pugs back in the day we didn't even use vent sometimes cause no one had it. so we just bumbled through with typing shit out. You were expected to have a general idea what you were doing, and yes it was unusual for those groups to even get to Rags, but it did happen.
---
Exactly this. I got furbolg exalted and I would bounce between felwood and winterspring killing furbolgs and collecting necklaces and feathers (have to do some mindless grinding to get past hated before then though). You pick up some decent gear and its a nice easy way to waste time.
---
It's really quite easy, and when you complete the final quest Thrall yelled something about friendship with the furbolg in Orgrimmar. Had a bunch of people PM me and asked what the fuck was going on haha.
---
Someone play the Nagrand music!
---
Wasn’t there a rep item that only the most badass of lvl 19 twinks would grind for? 
---
It was an offhand that had a use effect that would heal you for a ton of hp
---
Any new information released on what the process for creating addons for Classic Wow will be? Will it be the current WoW API since the client is essentially a fork of 7.3? Will there be any proper reference documentation? 
---
This seems to be the biggest question mark. Most likely much more similar to retail than classic. I'm practicing multiboxing with as little macro support as possible and assuming most of the classic addons will have equivalent ones available eventually 
---
You stop getting a fraction of the rep when you are halfway through honored iirc.
---
Even 3 or 4k is plenty. WoW nowadays has so many different areas for players to go to, but with Classic its much more congested.
---
I definitely think it's reasonable to expect a lot of active work on the existing addons that currently work on 1.12.1 client Private Servers in order to port them to the "1.13" client, assuming the API is consistent with retail and not something that's closer to the old 1.12.1 stuff. But hey, whatever needs to be done I'm sure it will be! Some information would be nice (which I expect to be discussed more in detail if or when Beta becomes available).
---
&gt; If you're playing Vanilla to be in PVP or MC gear and be able to compete with people in Naxx gear then Vanilla isn't the game for you.
---
This is exactly what we are debating here. I was competitive in PvP gear throughout whole vanilla, and vanilla was the game for me since I played premade BGs for 90% of my time. Obviously I managed against Naxx geared players because most of them weren't really good, but the moment a top PvP player entered the BG in full Naxx gear it was a huge swing for an opposing side because the weapons and gear were ridiculously overtuned.
---
&gt; As for the power curve. It's one of the best power curves WoW has ever had through a period.
---
It's a good power curve until Naxx. That is not even debatable, you only need to look at Naxx gear compared to AQ and see the ridiculous spike in power.
---
The only solution I see is them adding a new 5 man in the vein of DM, and update PvP gear.
---
Yes, CD keys are often used as proof of account ownership.
---
someone could potentially call customer support and gain ownership of your account with it.
---
I have Vanilla, TBC and WotLK discs.
---
So cool!

Alexa!

Cool stuff! What're you planning to draw next?

Making that hammer and finally bringing that bastard in was one of my most prominent classic memories. Having everyone position themselves with their back to the pool so when they get thrown they'll land in the water.

---
It'll probably be easier to modify retail addons to work for Classic than vanilla ones since the Classic API is very similar to the retail one. 
---
I'm either getting old or Euros have weird sense of humor. Turned video off right after the bad joke in recruiting video. 
---
I actually was involved in some pretty fun world PvP today during the drustvar invasion. It's the first time all xpac I had a legit world PvP experience that wasn't ganking.
---
I agree. And if people have old versions (for 7.3) of current addons, the process could be even quicker. I guess a potential problem I can come up with would be something like spell ID changes, item IDs, locations, etc. Those might be something that could cause problems when trying to move current addons to Classic.
---
Vanilla 1.12 until Classic is released.
---
Early on it made sense to me that the more arrows I shoot at an enemy, the more damage I would do. So I was rapidly firing serpent stings on enemies until someone told me I was doing it wrong.
---
What's the point, when you're just going to re-do everything 
---
Alright granny
---
Nothing lasts forever.
---
And I actually enjoy the game.    
---
Most of us that play on private servers have been starting again roughly every year for the past 4 years.    
---
It's nothing new at this point.
---
what’s up with that „lol“? I’m getting the feeling it’s unlikely you played vanilla beeing 12.
---
nature's swiftness
---
I still see many people, including this video, implying that the token allows you to buy gold directly from Blizzard. The token does not generate any new gold; you exchange it with another player for their gold.
---
It is exactly the same as offering another player $15 on PayPal in exchange for an amount of their in-game gold.
---
This system actually has less of an impact on the economy through inflation than farming for grey items and selling them to a vendor.
---
I remember 7 discs for some reason... 
---
New blizz is just dead.  It's sad what they did to their amazing games. 
---
And wrath is when it started going actblizzard. So we have theoretically 4-5 years of decent gaming as long as they dont put LFR in. 
---
I guess what I mean is that the needs that addons filled in vanilla will end up being filled by addons in classic, regardless of whether they need to be rewritten for the new client. So it's pretty safe to practice on a private server with whatever addons you might need because some equivalent will eventually be available. In the case of macros I feel going too deep into the vanilla rabbit hole might be a waste. All that said I stopped playing a month into tbc so I don't actually understand what the modern api is like.
---
That's my strategy. Use addons to get a half decent ui, use only basic macros, get good at isboxer. 
---

Ulduar was much like the hardcore Kara.

lol most times id out dps same class with higher ilvl.  did really ruin raiding for a while though.

It's your shitty video, do the research.
---
&gt; TBC started to kill of wow with the dam flying mounts -.-
---
How did bc flying kill wow? 
---
&gt; in practice they did kill a large part of the game
---
No they didn't. 
---
He was probably one of the 95% who only cleared it after the nerfs.... 
---
1a.) I think Multiple clients per computer should be disabled.
---
1b.) I think Dual-Boxing (two different computers running one client each but controlled by the same person) should be allowed (and is as of now.)
---
2a) Multiboxing creates an odd dynamic in PVP, I've done key broadcasting with just 2 warlocks and being able to double DoT the same target is a little like pay-to-win
---
2b.) Typically if you have any sense and it isn't 1v5 you can defeat a multi-boxer because key broadcast software is far from perfect. 
---
3a.) I do not intend to multi-box but I do intend on dual-boxing.  I've dual-boxed since my old days in EQ,  One keyboard on my desk the other in my lap and two mice side-by-side.  I can't run dungeons or PvP like this. I like to roleplay and being able to control another character for chat is a lot of fun for me.  I can heckle one character or if I am rude to someone on accident or on purpose and regret it I can smooth things over with a 3rd party.  It might sound like I have a social disorder explaining this but its really just in the spirit of having fun.   Also, I personally like having the option the solo farm some things when I can't find a group/partner and having a pocket healer is always useful for buffing people or rezzing someone.  
---
Wrath ended a year after they merged with activision... coincidence. 
---
&gt; In what world were the encounters boring? The Alliance fight was imo one of the best encounters
---
What were the other encounters again
---
I would guess that they’d be playing Alliance based on previous track record. 
---
That being said, Asmongold already mentioned playing on a PVE server. 
---
Oh how bfa'ers long for welfare badge gear now
---
Pretty much just baiting till I get too raw to touch, then drowning in NyQuil to recouperate... Rinse and repeat.
---
Nothing really compares to Illumination I guess, but for Priest it's mainly Meditation in Disc and Improved Healing in Holy.
---
Similarly, Druid should get Reflection, and Improved Healing Wave unless you're strictly your guild's Rejuv bot (in which case Improved Rejuv obviously). Plenty of druids heal with only 21 for Nature's Swiftness because both Heart of the Wild and Moonglow are good substitutes for the late Restoration talents.
---
For shaman, Mana Tide is pretty damn important... But it's possible to heal with 21 down to Nature's Swiftness if you want to go down 30 into Elemental. But you'll have to answer to your guild for why you don't have Mana Tide if they're strict (it's more noticable than missing any other key talent from other healers)

Yeah, 800 over 8 seconds I think. I would think it can be done by tagging a target and getting someone else to do the rest of the damage. I know you get 0xp in those situations, but you may still get full rep and the feather.

their endgame dungeons actually rekt all the rest.

and cata only added -5million more ;)

Yes.

oh for sure the free to get into, then sub is one of the better ones, but i'd say that's a sub-type of sub based cost. i was just comparing the alternatives being bad for the longevity of the game as the developers have to make money in ways that don't help make the game better.
---
As much as communist china remark. You asked me what game had pay by the hour model, how many years its been like that and how successful it is. I showed one, then you went on a rant abour china. I showed you the fact, if you disagree with it the sure, do that.

I loved being a healer mage, so much more Hps.

Same here. I did it solo as a Warrior, so it included a lot of careful pulling, running, and dying. I believe this was my first time summoning him after completing the mallet.

During one of my recent run through of SM Lib on my Priest our Tank went AFK, before we even got to the hound master. He said he'd be right back.

We got bored of waiting and started clearing.

Long story short, we ended up clearing the whole place, including Arcanist Doan.
---
We had a Mage, a Rogue, me a Shadow Priest healing and I think the 4th was another Rogue but I can't quite remember.
---
Jokes on you, I used key binds. Plus I have an action bar, it's right there in the bottom left of the screen.
---
ICC was good and so was Ulduar. But Trial of the Crusader? Eh. Naxx 25/10 was also a bit meh also. By comparison TBC had Kara &amp; ZA, Highking/Gruuls &amp; Mag, SSC, TK, Hyjal, BT, &amp; Sunwell. Most of which required some pretty epic &amp; extensive chain quest attunements. 
---
He's trying to make a concerted effort on the pros and cons of the system. He's asking for discussion, like: 
---
   
---
Does blizzard have good enough tech to deal with the first problem?  
---
Do they have enough customer support to deal with it?  
---
  
---
He's not favoring either side really. He's making a point that they might add it. This is mostly for awareness
---
Fair point, though I'd say that there are many here that have unsubbed to retail and are simply waiting for Classic to launch. With that thought, trying to launch Classic in-between retail raids may not make as much of a difference to the bottom line as simply getting Classic up and running as quickly as possible. 
---
Reeeeeee
---
The only problem with going Reckoning is that the /sit macro won't work in Classic.
---
I've been messing around with three different Paladin characters on a p-server right now I think I'm going to do what you're doing (only level to Illumination) and then go Ret. SoC is pretty much the last source of truly great Paladin DPS. Coupled with Pursuit of Justice and Improved Ret Aura, the leveling process has been insanely fun.
---
It's been hell tanking. No matter how good the shield I grind or which talents I pick (I've memorized every guide) it's just not viable with the wildly divergent skill levels of party members. Half of tanking as a Paladin is the skill level of your party. It's just not worth it to me to waste talent points in a spec I won't even be enjoying.
---
Awesome, this is exactly what I need to know!
---
Back then every blizzard game they released was a commerical masterpiece. The real splinter cell is notable but not even of that standard. Thus I can fully understand that StarCraft Splinter Cell wouldn't have been a masterpiece (and thus up to their expectations). These days though blizzard would have totally released SC Ghost because they have no standards
---
I'm only level 41 ATM and find it easy to tank with holy shield and Imp Right Fury but I can see problems at 60 for sure with all the geared players. It might be better when you get the Law Breaker suit for them self heals or at least that is what Drag the Crusader said in his video (his channel now gone).
---
Not all heroes wear capes
---
I did mulgore on one of the fresh psers as orc rogue no probs, there's only one chain you miss. (The well cleansing)
---
This is a brilliant idea. 
---
What class has more impact in raids when played by a very skilled player, resto druid or holy priest.
---
I'm totally playing devil's advocate here, but I think the point is that Classic is going to offer an endgame that was never actually fully realized.
---
The “original” Vanilla experience did not include many players getting Naxx gear and owning everyone in PvP before TBC was launched three months later.
---
(Personally I love the idea of leaving 1.12 “running” and seeing what would have happened had TBC not actually come out.)
---
How viable is a melee Priest for leveling?
---
I am really curious to see what they do with raids.  There is a decent risk they will be trivial if they do nothing.
---
&gt; Saying that you can't earn the skins in the game is wrong as you can both buy all of those skins from the Trading Post from other players and you can earn gems to spend on those boxes by spending gold (It's worth mentioning that the statuettes also guarantee you rewards from them). The issue here is that gold is the "only" reward in the game. Instead of attaching skins to content it's instead attached to a monetization model. 
---
I actually meant to say that, but forgot to write it. My point wasn't that you can't earn them without spending money, my point was that you don't earn them with *actually playing the game*, as you described. Plus the gold price for them is very cheap.
---
&gt;And yes while the game hasn't seen any "dungeons" since release it has seen plenty of 5-man content through updates to fractals.
---
The original fractal content drop in 2013 brought 15 fractals. Today there are 20. That makes 1 new fractal per year. That's not exactly plenty.
---
I think Discord users greatly overestimate how popular Discord is.
---
Fractals are 20 minutes long pseudo-dungeons with something like 2 bosses on average, and since the original fractal patch in 2013 there have been a total of 5 added.
---
Wonder what would happen if you installed wow  with those discs now.
---
&gt;"rather it being represented as fact without personal bias."
---
Yes, no shit, which is the context it was used in
---
&gt;You've used it correctly maybe 10% of the time in this thread.
---
No, I stated the same objective figure multiple times which has been cited from numerous other publishers, and is categorically objective, non-agenda driven information from Blizzard directly. 
---
&gt;the number probably (definitely) does surpass 100 million
---
Thanks for agreeing the number presented is objectively true; appreciate that. 
---
&gt; but number of accounts created is not the same as number of players.
---
Wow, really? you don't say! this is why I have done calculations and factored in things like players having multiple accounts in the MAJORITY of my replies!
---
&gt;everything you're saying is speculative at best
---
Wow! well aren't you a smart one! Blizzard hasn't released objective information relating to the breakdown of battle.net accounts, there are potentially 100's of small factors to add to an equation of players that will have an interest in Classic enough to buy a subscription fee. I never stated (not once) that the 100,000,000 number wouldn't be divided significantly by those factors until it was in the 100k-2 million range.  
---
It's also very hard to get objective figures here. out of the 100 million players that left the game, it's incredibly hard to obtain the true percentage of those players interested in Classic World of Warcraft. I personally believe it will be less than 10% of those players at launch after factoring in all possible factors, then again, it could be 10-40% of those numbers.
---
The point was; even if it's 5%. I don't think Blizzard is prepared, cares or anticipates this volume of players immediataly off the bat. 
---
Same, i am thinking about doing this now. 
---
Paladin should always be drawn with bubble+hs
---
Terrible. Caster classes have greatly increased chance to deal a glancing blow when they attack in melee, and also greater average damage reduction from glancing blows.
---
Feathers were not in at release, they were added in a later patch, maybe around 1.8? dont quote me on what patch though, not sure. If OP is playing a non-official server atm, they might not be available.
---
the good old days of pug gdkp  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTZl5oT49Zs
---
Holy priest. Stronger and more versatile healer in general, but the difference isn't huge.
---
Holy shit - you got the piece from the Hinterlands on your own? You're a fucking mad man. 
---
Other players in current wow might as well be NPCs, you'd never know...
---
It's just so far in the wrong direction. 10 years worth of bad decisions.
---
A good write up of this is described here: https://shadowpanther.net/leveling.htm
---
Not sure of classic wow will be exactly identical when it comes to how combat is calculated but it's probably pretty close. 
---
bgs didnt destroy wpvp idiot, theres plenty if the server has enough population. Thats why I hope the population is upped. 
---
ND?
---
Well, the Classic demo itself was built on top of a build of the Legion client, and the final Classic build will likely be built on top of the demo. 
---
This is really good work and I absolutely love the dark theme. Will keep an eye out for progress!
---
NA or EU? 
---
Why does is matter? If you have cleared naxx you deserve to be powerful in classic. It's like getting daidric armor in skyrim. 
---
Yep. About as much as heroic and normal fuck with world firsts.
---
I am actually working my ass off before Classic launch. I have a lot of things to do to prepare for the no-life.  
---
Not playing games. Just working on my list.  
---
I've never had anything motivate me to "get things together" quite like Classic. The irony is deep.  
---
I wasn't talking about the technical aspects sorry, I didn't mean to imply that. I was talking what is already included in the game, I don't think they can feasibly fix several expansions worth of P2W, remove the achievement system, dailies and other cancerous elements. Even if they stop including them in the future, the damage is done.
---
Bitter sweet. I loved that dagger and wanted it bad for my mage (had a really good off hand). Another mage in the party complained the entire run, did little damage, and ended up dying 3 times and wiped us once. The Beguiler Robes had dropped in that run and I won them and he was super irritated that he lost the roll. 
---
When we downed Doan, I passed the dagger to him. We then ran to cathedral, he died again and rage quit/hearthed. I regret not rolling on that dagger to this day (even though I did get it later). 
---
So, as I said, bitter sweet..
---
Oh really? Do you know if the other ones still dropped beads to hand in? And do you know if there was still an exalted reward before that?
---
Nah it started in BC tyvm
---
Yeah our group went on to Cathedral too after Library (will be the next blog post), but luckily for the mage he ended up getting the helm, so we both got some good loot from that run.
---
It was a great dagger though. Pretty sure it replaced my staff from a Deadmines run (though honestly, I might have had something different equipped at that point. But I am sure it was a staff).
---
Good times. ^_^
---
Oh, well yeah I think you're probably correct there. You can't just remove the shop now and all of those mounts; or make those mounts obtainable within game. It's kinda built into the fabric of the game at this point.
---
Things like the leveling system and dailies could be tweaked, professions restored. Achievements and the Store would likely stay; but effort could be made to make achievements feel more rewarding. (Less = more?)
---
Sure, the initial development and infrastructure cost was huge and totally warranted the high price. But as time went by, the cost evened out. Server operation costs naturally sink over time, and most of vanilla's content patches were things that have been in the game files since release. BC also reused a ton of assets. Wrath's entire first raid tier was a rehashed vanilla raid. To put it in numbers, [before 2014 they had 140 or less developers](http://www.digitalspy.com/gaming/news/a594062/team-expansion-behind-slow-world-of-warcraft-updates-says-blizzard/) working on WoW. That's a laughable amount for an AAA game that earned something like a billion in 2010.
---
But again, even if you did that for future achievements a large part of achievement hunting is the aim to get them all which doesn't mesh with years of prior expansions having it. I really feel the best option for them is just try some changes on classicwow after the first year or new mmo time.
---
Aren't you the guy who frequented Shockedbeyondbelief? 
---
Considering that Blizzard are planning on using Sharding in the starting zones (to compensate for all the tourists), I think it would be pretty safe to assume that the population caps will be higher than the original 2.5k.
---
However, I also assume that they're aiming for each realm to have around the original 2.5k once the dust settles.
---
The beasts, jaraxas, Alliance/Horde, Valkyr, Anubrekhan
---
"No it was the peak of wow xD xD"
---
The beauty of Classic is I don't think the "content at 60" problem will exist that much at all, since alts will be so valuable to level and this naturally takes a long time.
---
The issue is; in 3 years, when we hit BC and everyone has their preferred alts. Dailies would be the natural answer, I'm not sure how you prevent or replace them; and it would absolutely need to be a change made during BC.
---
I'm not sure which mechanic you're talking about so I'll go into both. 
---
For normal resistance, it depends on the interrupt being used. But I'll use counterspell as an example. It's an arcane school of magic that's a binary resist. Meaning it can't partially resist. I don't know if the code is literally two rolls but it helps to think of it that way. The first roll looks at spell hit. Same level pvp has a default hit rate of 95% and can be increased to 99%. There will always be a 1% chance to miss. After that roll, if it is a hit, there is a second roll that looks at resistance. 75 points in arcane resist is (I think) a 25% chance to resist. Some gear will have a spell penetration stat that lowers the targets resistance by x account. That amount is subtracted directly from the targets resist before the second roll happens. So if you have 75 penetration you completely negate that targets resist. Some other interrupts were physical and therefore followed the rules of melee hit/dodge. 
---
However, there was some gear and perhaps talents that specifically mentions "increase chance to resist silence and interrupt effects by x%". This completely bypassed the normal hit/resist mechanics and as far as I know there was nothing that could reduce that. It was it's own separate thing  The reason that gear wasn't abused was because there wasn't a lot of it and if you did manage to stack it, it would cripple you to anything other than resisting interrupts. 
---
You clearly dont grasp the concept that number accounts on private server dont actually give any sort of reliable information. And yes i was referring to your "active" accounts, gold sellers are active, multiboxers are active etc. Active probably means logged at least once in last month or something
---
Oh okay so you screwed them in, that makes sense right through the disc hole probably ya? 
---
I should have kept some stuff from back in the day like my original diablo 2 box and fallout 1 box and stuff like that but I think my mom yardsaled it off. 
---
It's a sticky issue, there are quite a few no changes people who'd go with it because they've tried Nost and liked it. Although, I think if it meant having phasing past the starting zones/opening weekend rule almost all of them would take issue with it.
---
Nost had exploitable spawn rates because of the population. An AoE grinding mage could kill every mob in an area at once, and trigger the server's "fast spawn for overcrowded area's" mechanism, and the respawns would happen about a minute later.
---
I think the population sizes made sense back in the day. Less world PvP cuts down on burnout, STV went from highly competitive fun to basically unplayable.
---
Looks really cool hey 
---
Where did you get the frame for this?  I want to frame some stuff for a gift for someone and would like to know where to get one made.
---
Specially if you ever playe4d during Cata and finished the rogue legendary quest line for the daggers. It was all Ravenholdt, and it felt amazing. Was baffled they put rogue in dalaran. Guess they couldn't justify a teleport to Ravenholdt lorewise
---
You need 3% hit for pvp and you cannot go over 99% spell hit chance, opposed to melee yellow hits
---
Yes, the base game came with a lot of skins, but that the pacing of new skins "slowed down" is an understatement. The 3 years after release saw only one set of new armor earnable through ingame means. The gem store in that same timeframe got 5-7 sets. HOT was the price of a full game, but only added 3 sets. POF and its living world season was better at around 6 or so sets. But the map rewards are hardly worth talking about. For example, "A Bug in the System" added 4 new weapon skins (all of them BOE drops that can be bought from the TP), one new shoulder skin and 3 new, useless backpack skins. "Long Live the Lich" added one set of chest skins and two useless backpacks. "A Star to Guide Us" was probably the best patch with an entire new armor set and that pseudo garrison that you can furnish up. Still, there's next to no reason to actually do the maps unless you really care about minis.
---
This is the correct answer, well done
---
Check out kargoz warrior master class videos on youtube, all you ever wanna know about warriors
---
Dailies are not a substitute for substance, they are used to time-gate content which is almost always horribly unimmersive (AQ being a good exception) and as a psychology tool to make people feel compelled to log in and do some recurring task, rather than to log in and have fun/do what they naturally want to do.  
---
I feel like they can easily go the Diablo route and have some yearly classic "reset" servers, giving people fresh servers/economies to experience. As well as introducing changes in those fresh environments, even if they're small balance tweaks or increased difficulty.
---
Am still working on that. Havent played my rogue for years because they f*ed up combat with their pirate fettish.
---
Miss chance vs even level for weapon classes is 5% for specials. So that first 5% is very useful, especially since damage while leveling is heavily about consistency. Precision, by a happy coincidence, happens to give you 5%. Fight mobs at your own level or below and you'll never miss specials. 
---
https://i.redd.it/ss1ye5wzxyh01.png
---
well yea Im not saying 14k, but 6k is nice as it is right now on current p server. 
---
Seems slow 
---
Pservers made adjustments to deal with the population that Classic is not going to have. You would hate it. There were super servers in vanilla that had abnormally high populations (there was an EU server with 8 active Naxx guilds, they had to schedule Thaddius attempts with each other because it would lag everyone in the Naxx zone) and people who played on them hated it, they got off ASAP. Only being able to farm in instances because of alts literally camped out on top resource nodes that log in on cooldown to farm them (I'm not even talking one alt, guilds would have one alt per Black Lotus spawn location in a zone). Instance server being full probably won't happen on modern hardware so at least that concern is gone. 
---
Basically there are many, many, many mechanics that were designed around the population cap. Pservers made adjustments to those mechanics to have less servers. Classic won't, so having higher caps would result in a shitty experience for all concerned. 
---
It'll be using the modern API, has been stated a few times. They've also said they may restrict anything that can be used to break the "spirit" of vanilla though such as matchmaking addons.
---
chat channels in general are so volatile compared to a forum.
---
Got kicked in the face with nostalgia seeing those
---
It's part of the reason why private server die once naxx is released.
---
yes, to some degree.
---
now think about why premades or guilds form.  
---
its the strive for gear that binds the people together.  
---
no one would put themselves through hourless PvP grinds every day if there were no rewards.  
---
you became attached to your fellow PvPers and build up a community with them after you set your goal to get the rank and gear you desired.  
---
In my experience they can't. I tried to recover my account during Cate with original CD codes and was told that these are no longer accepted once they moved to .net. I eventually had to get my (then) 7 year old bank details off my old bank. :'(
---
A lot of players in one place wasn't anything special back then, so nobody took screenshots of it. Except perhaps the opening of AQ.
---
This. They said it'll use the same API as retail but it will be crippled to deny any functionality they don't want to exist in Classic. What that means is actually the only unanswered question we have, so anyone who wants to start developing an addon for Classic can just develop the same addon for Retail and hope nothing it needs gets culled.
---
the biggest reason why I try to avoid the "community" argument is that in reality you will meet the same players. the exact same person.  
---
how can it possibly be the community if you end up largely with the same people you currently play the addons with?  
---
if the players are the same maybe it is something else that different. maybe its the environment that is different.
---
players (not all, just most) are only as nice and social as the game requires them to be. sad, but true.
---

---
Cleave spec fury warriors with gear do insane damage on certain fights
---
Additionally, you usually are at least 5-10p behind on the weapon skill compared to your level... so having extra % hit is VERY nice.
---
Paladins can only get a max of 3%. Does that make it less valuable to pursue vs. the other classes?
---
if you constantly run into people than it stops beeing special.  
---
when I leveled it was a blessing when I could team up with another person to do the damned ogre quest in feralas.  
---
you maybe shouldn't have the expectation of an overcrowded servers. this is not the vanilla experience and it never will be. its the nost experience.  
---
blizzard wants to recreate the vanilla experience though.
---
Then, after all that trouble I had to experience Cata. A human tragedy.
---
These discs bring up memories.. after school we wen't to local store with my mom and bought World of Warcraft. It took ages to install. "Insert next disc" was often on my screen as I just stared installation process and waited notification to insert next disc.
---
It was quite a let down that after that long process free month didn't activate until first subscription. So I could play only at next day when we visited store again and bought game card.
---
Mark Kern has come out and said that they varied the pop cap throughout Vanilla, eventually settling for their ideal number of around 4k before TBC.
---
So the meme that pop cap was 2.5k is only that—a meme.
---
That's really cool OP! Would you mind sharing a picture of your pokemon cards too? You've got some neat nerdy decorations there.
---
This is actually true. Leveling up for hours and then seeing random guy getting into same spot. "Hello friend, want to do quests together?"
---
It quite often ended up to be friendship of that night, questing and doing dungeon and talking about things. Something never happens on current live servers. Social aspect is one of the biggest things I am looking forward from Classic.
---
COMEATMEBRO
---
I mean, the first three points are just as valuable, assuming you are in the Prot tree already. You have to work out the entire build and when you are going to get each talent if you want to have a real answer.
---
It's definitely not worth rushing unless you're already going up the prot tree to get Reckoning. 
---
Generally speaking as Paladin you want to do one of three things:
---
* Rush Seal of Command (11 ret) then carry on as Ret until you get Vengeance, then respec to get Reckoning + Seal of Command together in Prot.
---
* Rush Seal of Command (11 ret), then either race for Consecration (11 Holy) or keep going up to 30 Ret first, for an eventual 21 Holy 30 Ret build at 60 that lets you DPS and Heal equally well and almost as well as pure holy/pure ret.
---
* Rush Consecration (11), then hop over to the Prot Tree, and mix and match a Holy/Prot build that can both tank and heal any dungeon as you level. This one has much slower kill potential solo than a Seal of Command build though as you're using 1h/shield and SoRighteousness when soloing.
---
Of the above, none of them really have the option of "rushing" the Precision, but you should always grab it whenever you find your build is going up the Prot tree to grab BoSanc or Reckoning.
---
People were stacking the Token stamina trinkets cus they had a really high gearscore, they were obviously useless for any dps or healer. people would put on gear that was shit for them just to get a higher gearscore. i remember seeing a a rogue with an int belt, because it had a high gearscore.
---
Yeah i can imagine some scumbag saving names, reserving them, then messaging you on Reddit trying to sell you the name.
---
(ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧
---
THIS IS WHAT I WANTED TO KNOW OMG THANK YOU!
---
More like it will be Classic but it won't be Vanilla. I think it is good. I want them to bring the spirit behind Vanilla. No one wants to have those broken parts of the game like class balance. We all have those nostalgia feelings about Vanilla so many forget easily how much there was actually broken back then. It will be challenging to bring that spirit back (I say it's impossible) but I hope they can get as close as possible.
---
With 1.12 classic it likely be on start just like on 1.12 private server.
---
This video is so unnecessary. 
---
I'm so sorry but that is a question that can be answered in one second. 
---
Today there must be a video for every sneeze in classic. 
---
Stop doing a Video for every little detail, this makes the whole thing ridiculous 
---
Great breakdown. 
---
I was also conflicted about going for the holy points earlier or later after getting SoC..
---
Are you sure they are race specific? I recently did the UD warrior quest for def stance on an Orc.
---
Sometimes a class is easy just because of the enjoyment. If leveling warrior is fun and leveling mage is insanely boring for someone, leveling a warrior just may be "easier" for that person, even though they may be tougher objectively.
---
Then you are in for a fun time.
---
What a short sighted and selfish request.
---
Congrats, you can criticize semantics and ignore how their market dominance &amp; customer retention allows them to display monopolistic behaviors. You must've gotten at least a B in high school econ.
---
There are a couple of reasonable answers, but reading the rest of this thread I swear some of you are so obsessed with Classic you're actually going insane.
---
For your own damn good, find something else to do until release.
---
Only the VW and Succubus had voice lines. The Felhunter and Imp only made noises.
---
Note that in the Classic demo, the Imp had voicelines that would also show text in the chat pane. This is inaccurate to Vanilla WoW.
---
It also opens up 2h warrior on horde, as wf makes it viable, reducing weapon competition.
---
Exactly. If something is worth doing, its worth doing several times. Vanilla is worth doing. I've leveled several different characters on different servers both horde / alliance and its always different and always interesting.
---
I always liked the Cathedral of Light in Stormwind (Priest) and Cleft of Shadows in Orgrimmar (Rogue). Reading this it also makes me look sort of bipolar.
---
Damn, trolls humans and gnomes didn't make the cut.
---
This would be best case scenario. As much as I'm craving Classic, I don't want to be locked in my room the entire Summer.
---
&gt; Naxx gear seems wildly overpowered 
---
You think? Hahahahahahahaha... That was by design friend. Gods deserve to be high on the power curve... Vanilla rewards time and effort and OH how Naxx raiders are rewarded.
---
It wont be an issue with 16 debuff slots (which we will get with classic). Also, deep wounds is a lowprio debuff meaning it gets pushed off by basically anything and everything.
---
tldr: Deepwounds is no problem in 1.12.1 and everyone will spec into it.
---
I think you're misinterpreting the point about gear in vanilla... Vanilla was not balanced nor was it fair... It was a tale of the haves and the have nots. You were a god or you were a peasant.
---
Riiiiiiiight... Naxx will be steamrolled by those who have the time to invest into it. And then when its on farm, runs will be sold. Fear not, new servers will be released periodically and people can flock to those im sure.
---
People like you are the scum of content creation. Why can’t you be more like Kargos instead of creating content about absolute trash 
---
Agreed.  Live every other PvP montage.   
---
Having a cost is indeed a barrier to entry. Yet how many people would be turned off by a $120 expansion fee? $180? Blizzard is a business, and they've got to either cancel development, or amortize costs.
---
Im hoping for ~8k. Seeing a major city filled with players and running into other people outside of town makes the game feel alive.
---
This. The reward for no-lifing the game is that you can obliterate people who are worse than you. Thats what vanilla was... You could be a really decent pvper getting destroyed by some keyboard turner in tier 2. 
---
I personally like to get 14 holy fairly quickly because this to me makes me feel comfy healing any dungeon AND tanking any dungeon up to 50, but you do lose some soloing power. It's personal choice really, you'll find most people say just zerg to 30 ret asap as this is the fastest killing build but personally I prefer being more versatile when levelling.
---
Plus Retadin is one of those classes that really needs crit to scale with and you only really start amassing high crit once you're 60 and start getting endgame dps blues, so whilst it's still very good the value of vengeance isnt quite as high as it could be.
---
Yes, but it will not be as good as it is for horde due to lack of WF.
---
Will be the same as retail when everything gets cleared. Guilds will begin selling runs. The difference is that there is nothing equalizing pvp... All of this I am FINE with. The top players deserve to decimate everyone else, its their privilege.
---
I leveled a warrior in Vanilla during when warriors were the flavor of the month so there was about 3 wariors per every class while leveling.  I had no issues gear up outside of raids because I tanked everything.   Getting groups is easy as a tank. 
---
Raids, on the other hand, was a major problem.  Warrior DPS was quite good in raids so my guild just starting in the MC would take 15+ warriors a raid.  I raided the MC for 2 months and didn't get a single drop.  All my gear was from the regular dungeons I was tanking.  I strongly suspect there might be similar issues with classic.
---
Looking at a mountain of DKP I couldn't spend, I finished leveling up my hunter alt, barely geared him outside the AV crossbow, stepped into the MC and stepped out 5 epics.  I continued tanking 5 mans on my warrior and subing him for some fights like Vael if needed, but I had a much better raiding experience as a hunter because my guild only had like 4 hunters that raided.
---
Players on private servers will form raids to farm rep.  This works because the mobs give +5 rep regardless of group/raid size, and also because of dynamic respawns (which may be a pvt server thing, I'm not sure)
---
"decent risk"... They will be trivial by modern standards. MC will be downed within a week or two by 35 dudes in green items. BWL will be crushed within a few days of its release. AQ will take a bit longer... Naxx could take upwards of 2-3 weeks on some servers. The only thing keeping people from steam rolling the entire game in a few months will be the delayed release cycle. 
---
I mean BWL will be pugged within a month of its release... The content IS trivial. It will be interesting to see all the anti private server people acknowledging that the content is not what they remembered. I would love to see a massive ramp up in difficulty to keep the content relevant for a longer period. It only serves to promote longevity in the game.
---
I can't speak for swtor, but RS by no means lets you see what the latest stuff is about. There was 1 update a year ago, but that was a rare occasion. Users say f2p is the first 10% or so of content, and you will be gaining ground drastically slower than members. Wow has a similar trial system for levels 1-20.
---
There was one time my rogue got the rare epic drop Deadman's Hand. Was pretty sweet, and the effect was awesome for get aways. 
---
https://www.wowhead.com/item=34227/deadmans-hand
---
Not entirely sure what you mean. Which item dropped in BRS would be a replacement for an AQ/Naxx item?
---
\^ Fernando
---
It is fucking nutty. You become a living god and MAN does it feel sweet.

I genuinely wish I still had my old WoW screenshots :(

&gt;The only reason why Vanilla was so good...
---
Mmmmm... I think there are A LOT of core design philosophies that contribute to Vanilla being successful. The community was certainly one of them, but that's not the ONLY reason that Vanilla was a superior product.
---
Serval years experience? A serval is a type cat apparently.
---
Exactly. The community's success was more impactful due to forced interactions. Socialization was incentivized. But the community is not the ONLY thing that made vanilla great. The long leveling grind that stuck players to one character and allowed players to actually earn ingame EXPERIENCE while earning EXPERIENCE. The penalties of world PVP. The identity within a specific class which was FORCED by the long grind. If something got buffed or nerfed, you couldnt just move to another character. The itemization and item identity - being able to see a weapon skin and immediately identify what it was or how powerful another player was. Elite mobs were elite... like actually though... Raids were with 39 other players which felt like a raid. World travel and how valuable a mount was... SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO many design philosophies beyond "community". I feel like the layman nostalgia default response for why they enjoyed vanilla is "community", it sounds nice and they feel it encompasses all the good stuff, but its such a weak minded attempt at having an opinion. Im not even sure that it counts as an opinion... I feel like OP is one of those people who would post a meme as a counter argument because he lacks a personality. /end rant
---
Yup, every.Single.PvP.Video
---
Because there were still remaining spots where people were not on flying mounts and thus could still wpvp does not mean it was a good thing to add it in the first place.
---
Not all encounters on the road are PvP gankings, there are genuine fights and mobs can aggro/snare you. The "shape" of the terrain (paths, obstacles) is ignored.
---
It's always funny to see "some zones were only accessible by flying !". With WoW's flying model (OP free XYZ axis movement), it just does not make them more interesting. It's equivalent to a gate for lvl 70 players with the skill. 
---
Except with an actual gate on the ground, you could design paths in the hills, camps with enemies around it, progressively setting the zone's mood. There is so much more liberty for the level designer to create the player's experience.
---
It's absolutely true though that most people could not see this back then. I remember people pointing the problems on WoW-Europe forums getting shitstormed to oblivion. It sometimes takes years to realize the impact a change has on a community or on the mood of a game.
---
8k devalues everything. Youll be doing a lot more than just running into people out in the wild. More like waiting in line for mobs.
---
Until some patch, there was no hand-ins. On Nost, I started farming, noticed the absence of turn-ins, and checked patch notes. They were introduced later. So I "happily" farmed rep by kills forever to be sure to have the enchantment recipies when they released.
---
Phasing =/= sharding
---
What spec are you? What race are you? What faction are you? Your quality of life and itemization will depend on many factors...
---
I could write a book about this topic so i'll try to keep this short with Warlocks.
---
As a Warlock on Alliance you will have far less competition than a Warlock on horde. Consider this... 40-45% of horde will be undead. Undead counter warlocks with will of the forsaken. Horde have shamans to purge warlock spells. Alliance warlocks are at a massive disadvantage and PvP and are chosen FAR less often. Due to how poorly ally locks do in PVP, choosing an ally lock makes gearing easy because there are no ally locks.
---
Lets compare and Orc warrior and a human warrior. Min maxers will often choose orcs and humans though arguments can be made for other classes. For our comparison, lets compare orcs and humans. Human warriors choose human for +swords. When it comes to gearing they are competing with 6-8 other warriors in their raids who also want swords. They are competing with 4-6 combat rogues who also are human and also want swords. Assuming EVERYONE in your guild isnt min maxing, a human warrior will still need to compete with 6-12 players on average to collect his swords. Whats more? He has paladins who may take a meme ret spec and try to take the odd piece of plate gear. Now lets take a look at orcs. Axe specialization. No competition for axes, say for the odd enhance but they are VERY meme and accepted even less than Rets. No competition for plate. Who will gear faster/easier?
---
This goes SO much deeper, but this should give some insight into considerations when deciding what will be easy to gear. If you want something easy to gear, choose something that will be awful in PVP, because almost no one will play it. Resto druid, alliance warlock, alliance dagger rogue (good in pvp but most allies will go human and thus want swords), etc etc etc... If you are looking to gear easy you want to be something that no one wants to take but also isnt entirely useless like a ret, enhance / ele sham, spriest etc etc etc... 
---
INB4 "BUT NIGHTFALL IS... AND SPRIEST GET GOOD ONCE THEY GET THE CRAFTED... I KNOW THIS ONE ELE SHAM THAT..."
---
This is exactly right. Which means that the competition is far less dependent on the specific class you choose and more dependent on the class + faction. A human warrior will NOT have the same gearing experience as an orc warrior and so on and so forth.
---
Hide your CD key dude!
---
It's a shame to see the potential story line for that sword and bloodline to become what it has.  Would've been nice to see Outlands as originally planned, and not an expansion.  This NPC sparked such interest and mystery in the story line to purge the Ashbringer.  https://www.wowhead.com/npc=21465/david-wayne
---
I don’t know why but yes. 
---
It would be silly of them to not create a containment server.
---
Basically a 1.12 pre-raid list won't look like a 1.1 pre-raid list. Since we're gonna be on 1.12 at launch, a lot of these lists are going to be way off.
---
A good example would be Spellweaver's Turban (UBRS) which is bis for casters until Nefarian helm, but wasn't added until 1.10.
---
Naw it was just a really easy joke that was sort of weird and shouldnt be used as an introduction. You probably have taste. You know when you have a really dark sense of humor and then someone makes a "dark joke" and you just sort of roll your eyes because they are so soft? Thats what you just felt. Some soft dude trying to be dark and then getting some shock laughs from a bunch of softies.
---
I don't think there has been any announcement about how they intend make servers. So everything is speculation.
---
I would hope that with their modern tech they are able to run multiple low population realms as entirely separated shards on the same hardware. This way they can roll out new realms as needed. Kind of as seen in vanilla where new servers were added nearly every month.
---
Barrens Chat
---
Shit they took Drakova down? Copyright claims I'm assuming?
---
Popcap should **not** be changed from original. Although it has been debated to no end if it was a design decision or technical limitation or what limit would be best, it's clear the world can't hold 6K (or even more).
---
Just read this (comment in first post): http://forums.crestfall-gaming.com/index.php?/topic/2150-population-cap/ I agree completely.
---
It seems this is a fundamental difference between PvP and PvE. Maybe Blizzard can offer a few PvP "megaservers" for those who want it but the default should definitely be the original cap.
---
You'll know a lot about containment servers come Classic.
---
Think I binned mine :(
---
Maybe not servers, but definitely blacklists.
---
Yeah I actually quit wow once they got nerfed. I'm actually feeling old thinking that was over 8 years ago. 
---
When you say class balance you are referring to 1.12 talents I assume? Even those were pretty broken
---
Currently the plan is get an extra job and stop playing videogames for a while. Just really push myself to my physical and mental limits and try to lose as much weight as possible. Then when summer comes I'll officially drop one job EXCLUSIVELY for World of Warcraft, which leads into phase 2. Phase 2 is me putting in my "2 week notification" because World of Warcraft is coming out. This will be a well deserved reward, I feel, and extremely profitable, as I will have been working two jobs.
---
WC3: R will be released not later than Novembet 2nd. A game has to be released within 1 year of pre orders starting according to some countries. WC3: R was announced on November 2nd.
---
We have a lot in common.
---
They are probably going to have to make those adjustments anyways though. The last active private server that had Blizzlike spawns had a population of less than 1,000 players total, but even with such a small population the only way to be able to afford flasks was to buy gold because a handful or so people completely controlled the Black Lotus spawn points. 
---
It is not just bigger populations, it is people knowing exactly when and where something is going to spawn and the demand for that item is much greater than it was during actual Vanilla because it is required for both AQ40/Naxx.
---
Removed - rule 1.
---
Its not semantics, market dominance has NOTHING to do with monopoly. "monopolistic behaviour" hahah for fuck sakes, you guys have no fuckin idea what monopoly means, monopolistic behaviour means absolutly nothing. Monopoly means that only 1 person or company is allowed to distribute a certain product, now how the fuck is WoW a monopoly, how is blizzard the only company who is allowed to offer an MMORPG game, newsflash, they are not.   
---
Educate your selves you fuckin nerds hahahah, downvoting facts instead of admitting you are wrong, you nerds have a bright future ahead of you.
---
Removed - rule 1
---
All of this is first assuming that blizzard will be including the Original Unarmored mounts in game (which I REALLY hope they do) and replacing them at Dire maul.
---
Did they add a fifth disc later? I could swear both my copies only have four...
---
Yes, lets add more catch up mechanics that helped ruin retail wow. This is why we can't have nice fucking things. 
---
A black backround would look nice :) 
---
There will be no hard Population-Cap. 
---
But ID picture surpasses any other proof.
---
Le Grind
---
Uhhh it was done in vanilla and required coordination of huge numbers of people who could not keep it locked down because of a simple thing, time zones. No pserver I have ever asked anyone about has been anything but international. Also every serious guild used Flasks but hundreds of Lotuses spawn in a week if they all get harvested. Enough to support a healthy raid scene on any server with a vanilla cap that is not at that cap 24/7. Which will never happen on a Classic server but seems to be the norm for "Bliizlike" pservers. 
---
This is fucking awesome 
---
Those are not the original discs, those are pretty recent, from the battlechest i believe? Still cool tho :) 
---
Nowadays on pservers people use a little nook on the right of the gate when you come from the stairs event. In that nook you get knocked only about 5meters, knock your head on the ceiling of the corner and plummet down without taking damage. 
---
But falling in the water for sure is more cinematic!
---
Probably?
---
I mean they should fix class balance completely. Make all specs viable in every content. I personally can live with Vanilla classes but I would prefer them making all specs viable.
---
Are those the original discs? Where im from, the original box had a DVD type box with 4 discs inside, but when i look at unboxing video's some people seemed to have these sleeves, wich is the original i wonder :D 
---
Still waiting for the Flying Combat system they showcased on the Box for WoTLK.
---
Fuck! Shit!
---
Not sure about that law but I saw that it will be released "before 31st of December", meaning within 2019. I saw this on official Blizzard store. I may remember it wrong tho.
---
My guess is a late spring announcement for late summer/early fall announcement.
---
Also possible to be extended due to complications.
---
I recently did these on a test server as an Orc Warlock. This should be no problem for the Troll.
---
Well, im sure very few guilds will run 15 warriors, just because it means you have to drop other classes, that you need later on. And since you can do like 4-5 onyxias / reset (vanillalike), gearing weapons isnt THAT horrible.
---
Or just reserve one item you want.
---
Beauty.
---
Asheshee is that you? From Emerald Dream? 
---
He who slew Kotya in a rap battle?
---
I don't think there is a "one card beats'em all" solution. While I certainly don't mind WoW's subscription, I would mind it in other games. Why ?
---
Because with WoW I always knew what I was getting and I was a die hard Warcraft fan since WC2. I didn't care about the subscription enough, I just wanted to play this huge game filled with history, that had it's roots in other games.
---
Now think of people that don't care about the lore or WC1-3, that just want to play a game, they have no incentive to actually make a subscription and try the game or the subscription in itself is a deal breaker on its own.
---
I never subscribed to another MMO and there were quite a few over the years, many that went F2P after a while. I'm thinking of Warhammer: Age of Reckoning, I like Warhammer 40K and Age of Sigmar but I never got attached to the lore like I did to Warcraft (at least back in the day). I never subscribed for the game even though I wanted to play it, the subscription made everything way less appealing.
---
ESO is doing great right now but it also has a lot of monetization systems in place. You buy the game then you decide if you want to subscribe or you can play it without a monthly fee, you can buy the expansions if you want or not and the game is still relevant, you can buy stuff from the store or not. The game kind of allows you to chose where to spend your money and what is worth to you without forcing you to actually spend any money except for the Base game. And the content is quality and constantly coming out.
---
Now if a game were to actually dish out quality content and features every expansion for a subscription fee, yeah sure I would be all over it. But BFA for example offers none of that and they still require a subscription to play. Personal and subjective opinions aside and has been shown by a lot of people, old and new players that BFA's systems, features and the main plot of the expansion are severely lacking, it's main "feature" are the visuals, new animation, new spell effects, improved graphics and and new races. Everything else is a mess to some degree or another. I don't have any reason to subscribe to this expansion and I always subscribed for every expansion even if there was only 1 single thing which was good about it, this time around there isn't.
---
Those numbers seem reasonable to me, wouldn't be enthusiastic about 4k+, mind you I can likely find a medium population server that fits my wants anyway. Although, if people get fed up with the high populations when they get a taste of the world PvP they might come overcrowd my chosen sever eventually.
---
This is a great idea. Too late for me, I binned them.
---
The on use heal wasnt working for a lvl 19, they farmed it because of the +10 stamina.
---
To farm the rep, you had to be dead while a friend in the same group farmed it for you.
---
It just gets you to go online and down load the new client sadly.
---
This law exists in some countries. Germany is one of them. So Blizz has to release the game not later than November 2nd. They mentioned it on B2W.
---
As much as I understand that yea if clear naxx you should have pretty powerful gear. But there is  a limit, that gear just seems to be worlds ahead of the other raids. Jumping from a staff that gives you 84 spell damage to a staff that gives 123 seems over tuned.
---
Phasing is 100% a New Blizzard idea and horrible.
---
&gt;They definitely won't release Classic in April or May and they don't want Classic and BFA to compete for sub $.
---
Those are both on the SAME SUB $. So their BEST option is to launch classic at end of BFA content, 1-2 months before their new raid. But depends if classic is ready to release by then.
---
The server I am on is a instant 60 one, but is also pay to win since you can buy the gear. 
---
It feels like once in awhile a group of naxx geared players group up and they just are capable of ravaging the bg. Watching a naxx geared warrior run at my full t2 paladin and just stomping me because his mace probably does like 15-25 more damage per second. Like getting crit for 2k with plate seems icky Haha 
---
Nost was not buggy really, nor were the successors. Remember they were free too.
---
Wow thats really nice!
---
I mean yea they do deserve to be powerful. But there is a difference between being stronger than the rest and being godlike. 
---
&gt;2.5k seems so low now that I've experienced the n0st in its prime, with 14k on at a time lol.
---
&gt;IMO, the population should be upped to 6k at least.
---
I have no idea what Blizzard will do. But I hope that "make it like private servers" it _not_ what they do.
---
I was allways more of a F2P Supporter.... sure can turn out like shit what F2P used to be 8+ Years ago but i prefered them that way. Nowdays even more i see that F2P is the best system. Sub based was once a garante for high quality MMO but nowdays... those games also have a Cashshop basicly making them comparable to F2P games.
---
I also like the hybrid way between F2P and Sub 2 play... something what EvE online made because the f2p mode of it is for me enough its allready so vast and i can do so much. WoWs "F2P" mode on the other hand is just the trial without time limit and it only shows you the ugly sites nowdays... back then in Vanilla and TBC i used to play a ton of trial wow :D because i loved the leveling and world.
---
Well i would want alliance for easy raids and HoF, so i guess a gmone warrior (i take axes and got Escape artist) sounds good to me. What gear is pvp gear and Will i have competitive on that?
---
Same lol
---
90's "MMOs" used todo so... was quite exepnisv tho :D
---
Fair reason to be skeptical.
---
It will work with a mob. Just need to aggro it. So AV/ World pvp, it works. AB/WSG not so much. So likely, healing in pvp with a 2H can be viable but got to wait for a rogue to jump you which I mean is Classic and private servers there’s always at least 2 in a bg. 
---
NA, EST hours unknown atm. Shaman with 3 parts PvE content to 1 part PvP. Season to taste. 
---
Also I’m probably going to no life it for 2 weeks at the start so anybody looking to duo feel free to message me.
---
At Blizzcon they gave some hyper subtle hints at June 16th.
---
I think you might be overestimating the number of drops you'd realistically get
---
I was a 2 hand warrior and frequently top dps
---
Na, EST hours unknown atm. Warlock just looking for people to chat with on discord and stuff while we level. Maybe we could have a bot set up and share our favorite music with each other. (This is how I came to love Lofi Chillhop)
---
I think he deleted his channel himself
---
It’s only worth 300g if people have that much to spend and aren’t willing to get it themselves with guild mates. At 14% I’d think most people would be trying to get it with a guild vs buying it since some people will spend days farming those 1% epic drops like ironfoe or whatever the percentage is.
---
I estimated 4 drops for 25 runs
---
Yeah, it's not something you can do "all the time" but it's a thing where if the marked asks for it, it's a good gold farming way you can use sometimes
---
Unlike your instant 60 server with gear for gold, votes or whatever, a natural server where that gear needs to be earned from the raid itself will be less imbalanced.
---
Once people are clearing naxx at the very least bwl will be pug'd and chances are most of those naxx raiders aren't bothered to switch to a pvp spec to play bgs or prey on fresh 60s.
---
An instant 60 server doesn't have any resemblance to what a real server will look like.
---
Mhhh i like to agree but overall i dont get what he means that Vanilla was awesome for people 6 month without even knowing raiding. And since cata people didnt had anything todo beside raiding BUT doesnt WoW in Cata or even later add much more side activitys to the game beside Raiding and PvP compared to Vanilla which didnt even had Daily quests ? 
---
I for my self wasnt a big Fan of Raiding and played mostly WotLK and later Cata... and while i love WotLK alot in Cata i felt like i had more casual non Raiding stuff todo at max lvl + getting into raids was more chill so yeah it was more casual i guess as even casuals like me got much more often to raids in Cata. MoP Destroyed the leveling experiance for me so that was the point i stopped but i still like Cata on it self.
---
I am sure I saw a 10 minute duel between mn with mom and a paladin streamer not so long ago. Definitely not 1 shot territory.
---
Well I hope that's indeed the case in classic, because within the chain there's an early 2h axe as a reward, which I'd often lament not being able to get on an Orc warrior, particularly as Tauren warriors 95% of the time won't have trained in 2h axes before doing this quest!
---
Everytime i mention how awesome or calm and cool the Music "right now in this region" is i just get reply in discord like "oh i play without ingame sound" .\_\_\_\_\_\_\_."
---
I try to play with game music all the time even tho some games i try out i dont like the music first or one track at the start but usaly its worth it for me to have a better feel about the game. Sounds and Music are sooo extremly nostalgic... its for me very important to listen to game music :D still get a fuzzy warm feel when hear music from games i played years ago that maybe no one even heard of like 4Story, Metin 2 (had only one or 2 good tracks and the game was garbadge but man that music still gives me the nice feel) or WolfTeam.
---
Pleased to meet you Fernando!
---
this guy knows his shit
---
This obvisouly is data gathering for facial recognizition. Im pretty sure it wont work in this case. 
---
Only thing i care about is that on a sub model, people behave better. If its f2p, they can just make new accounts to "fuck around". If they actually have to PAY for it, the number of people doing it will be cut down by 90%+.
---
Looking for an Australian guild.
---
- PvE or PvP realm
---
- Horde
---
- Raid from either 9-9:30pm or in the mornings (Melbourne time). I guess this could also suit a WA guild that starts earlier.
---
- Priority is raiding. Played a warrior back in the day and got up to AQ40 and I intend to roll warrior again, will probably aim to tank.
---
- PM here or nx#9729 for discord.
---
Cancer
---
I don't disagree. It's just a far better solution than multiple dead servers imo. 
---
Phasing is what occurs between shards or areas. Not really much difference in the context. 
---
well yea that's what i said  
---
definitely, especially since they seem to be upping the game  
---
Dazaralor is getting lots of praise, so I assume Naga one will be great as well  
---
Mages will be loaded with gold though. They can afford to drop the cash without blinking an eye.
---
omg and the poke cards
---
nerdiness level &gt;9000
---
FYI vanilla originally launched with 4 discs. A 5th disc was added later with patch data on it.
---
Heads up for those in the thread wondering why the count isn't consistent.
---
Thanks a lot! 
---
I think this has potential only early when the item launches, later on most of the mages already have the item and the price will go down dramatically. So realisticaly 3 people farm for a limited amount of time. However, if your math is correct then 80g per hour is still a very good amount, you can usually get around 50 with the usual farming methods.
---
They aren't doing tokens. Unnecessary video unfortunately. 
---
yeah i cringed hard reading rule 1 lol
---
&gt; they don't want Classic and BFA to compete for sub $.
---
How can they "compete for sub $" if you get both on same sub ?
---
4k has to be max imo unless dynamic respawns are added to the game (which will most likely piss way too many people off). If not it will be completely impossible to grind or farm anything, and the economy will go bonkers
---
I'm guessing a healthy mix of what we used to have. Normal, PvP, RP-PvE and RP-PvP, or atleast that's what seems logical. 
---
they could always implement dynamic respawn like retail has  
---
you dont want both of them to have content in the same time and compete with each other    
---
you want people to keep sub going on forever with content from both sides jumping in to stall for the other  
---
"Play digger digger"
---
Legion was actually awesome. Overwatch is good game aswell.
---
if you didn't enjoy the joke, guild isn't for you. kinda the point. has nothing to do with should/shouldn't be used. it's clearly doing the job it was intended for 
---
I'm pretty  sure it never really goes below 200g on private servers, but the thing is no one really farms them. Tthe problem is more that if you farm it to much their is only a limited amount of people that will be willing to buy it for a high price so if you farm to many of them the price will go down a lot.
---
:P sorry about that
---
Thanks. I don't know yet, might do a shaman.
---
Thank you. I randomly discovered this whole white outline thing that saved my painting and I plan on using it a lot on purpose in the next few :D
---
Also, aren’t the keys already saved on ones battle.net account?
---
Is this actually rare? Can’t someone go buy the game boxes for those expansions for not insanely expensive? I have them as well.
---
I mean more the free option lets you see what the game is about and helps to reel players in a bit and encourage them to keep playing and buy that sub. SWTOR lets you do more than RS without sub but doesn't let you do any of the current end game stuff.
---
I would argue Pursuit of Justice is your most valuable talent while levelling. The amount of time saved with the extra run speed will be quite substantial in the end. 
---
I'm rushing Cons to tank DM, then respeccing to get SoCom and PoJ, then back in to Holy to retake Cons, then in Prot to grab Precision. That will enable you to tank everything, except Stockades (unless you're comfortable doing it without Cons) while levelling. 
---
On another note, if you're going down Ret, I would grab Deflection rather than Imp SoC and Imp Judgment. It's generally not worth, for maximum uptime, and safe play, to use Judgment on cooldown, neither is judging SoCru first. 
---
Only rogues have it, and it's so insanely good that you should get it regardless of spec imho.
---
Lower pop servers have their own appeals, which I like. Having said that, I think it needs to be at 2.5-3k at least so all bgs can pop somewhat regularly. Raiding is surprisingly fine even down to about 1k pop, but pvp with low pop means wsg and ab only.
---
2h fury is legit. Not optimal, but easily good enough to warrant a raid spot.
---
It's the reverse. Once naxx drops, any decent guild will start getting their hands on t3 and all the insane trash mob loot.
---
I'm 100% sure the cap will be the same like it was in the original version.
---
They are doing classic with "no change" conception. Why they have to change population cap?
---
Probably better to 5 man spam all of strat live in a solid group and split the orbs.
---
Item worth is subject to supply and demand. If you farmed that 5hours/day every day you'd flood the market, essentially creating a bigger supply than demand and price would fall.
---
The secret to farming is find what items is currently in low supply but high demand and calculate the time investment needed to attain aforementioned item.
---
i didn't went on a rant, i just said that there was a special situation there.
---
14 years ago most of china was playing from internet coffee shops. that's why you paid by the minute. meanwhile situations has changed and the payment method changed accordingly.
---
rest of the world didnt get that form of payment. because is not viable.
---
i still don't see the relevance of adding trump into conversation.
---
True, i did talk about that in another comment, this is not something that you can just farm "all the time" but once in a while when the demand is high for them because not enough farm them, then this will be a really good secondary gold farm
---
Watch this
---
https://youtu.be/vCvb8MwvsD4
---
2.5k at launch and the first few months is fine
---
but after that period youll notice the downsides, first while twinking, later for all 60 dungeons and eventually even open world
---
Of course BFA is going to be in a rough place, they tried to create a MMO for mobile players with zero rpg elements and the only goal is to chase an ever increasing ilvl on gear with no fun or interesting stats or choices.
---
Kind of happens when you completely sell out your game to a player base that doesn't want to play your genre of game.
---
The thing is, that most players play one of those games full time. And i think everyone wants the same release schedule as vanilla had, so that might not fit in their retail releases at all anyways.
---
And imo it will be for most retail players, 3 months of BFA, 1 month of classic. And then never come back. 
---
I remember when a new server opened in, I think it was still back in classic since we had to reopen AQ (it was Blades Edge, EU). Everyone was so poor for the first couple of months, the first weeks or so you could buy a stack of copper ore for less than a silver because everyone wanted money and no one had it. 
---
I dont doubt it will be a similar situation when classic rolls out so my advice is - if you want to get rich off the AH at the start, think small. It farm elite Scarlet crusaders in wpl and epl, that is probably going to be faster.
---
You can easily farm Mara solo as a fresh 60 for around 40-50g per hour.
---
We will see. Even vanilla has content droughts. You don't have to farm and grind constantly, sometimes you just raid log for a while.  
---
I think the only reason people expect populations larger than 4k is because of how that has *kinda* worked on private servers. I think alot of people are underestemating the fact that private servers are populated with people from all over the globe, that leads to people being online 24/7 because of all the timezones they inhabit. 
---
I have a feeling Blizzard will keep people region-locked come Classic time, or atleast encourage people to stay on servers within their own. 
---
It's actually a bit baffling that they didn't, considering they had no problem using other old factions.
---
This was on YouTube video  like 2 days by frost(?).
---
You really should quote your sources. 
---
Well damn 
---
Looks like I'm buying a frame on my next day off.
---
So the difference between a good and a bad priest are the same between a bad druid and a good one? 
---
Vanilla is all about PvP, and it's the most balanced version of WoW when it comes to PvP. Classes were very clearly designed with PvP first, then PvE second.
---
I watched that video, but that video had nothing to do with this topic my friend :D 
---
That video was a "rare vanilla items and how much they were worth"
---
It wasn't a guide for "What items u should farm to make gold in vanilla"
---
I looked up every item in that video and that was how i found this out, this was the only "high value" item that seemed farmable.
---
I would have quoted his video if the video was about making gold but it wasn't, it was just a video about the most rare items and how much they were worth :P
---
This is why it's such a shame shaman never had a real talent refresh (1.11 was bullshit, look up Bus Shock). When overhauling the healing classes, Blizzard did a great job of going from basically requiring 31 points to be a raid healer to putting the core raid talents sub 21 in the tree. This then opened up actual hybrid builds while allowing for more interesting better themed skills like Holy Shock, Swiftmend, and Lightwell. Shaman are then only healers left getting strong-armed into deep healing specs thanks to raid specific talents that don't really help them out but are clutch for the raid.
---
not to mention cosmetic gear ruins the rpg element. I want to wear gear that I find in the game, not gear which randomly gets added to my characters inventory. 
---
&gt;Vanilla is all about PvP 
---
lol no  
---
&gt;and it's the most balanced version of WoW when it comes to PvP 
---
based on what? Casual PVP it offers?  
---
Delusional.  
---
&gt;Classes were very clearly designed with PvP first, then PvE second  
---
nah, very few spells are pvp specific  
---
My apologies 
---
Yeah, but i dont see (at least for myself) ever taking breaks, even if i would raidlog. Im a alt-a-holic, so theres plenty to do.
---
Or simply well-balanced :)
---
/r/thanosdidnothingwrong
---
they are trying to maximize profits so they don't really care about you (in the context of worrying about you unsubbing)  
---
Wrong 
---
Generally good advice here i think but I really wouldnt grab precision at this point. The 5 early points in Prot before it make very little difference and whilst 3% hit feels good, its still only 3%. It's 3% extra dps, no more, no less, and at the expense of 8 talent points. You can't fully remove the chance of missing anyway as its not 5%.
---
Compare those 8 points into precision to putting 8 more points into Ret once you have SoComm and Pursuit- they'll get you 5% crit, imp judgement (or maxed parry) and Sanctity Aura, which will make a much bigger difference on your soloing than 8 in prot.
---
It's all about return on investment and whilst 3% hit is nice for 3 points, the 5 points you need to spend for it just arent worth it. If you're concerned with maxing your tankability early on then you should drop ret entirely and go all the way up prot for at least BoSanc. Otherwise, just go all-in on the Ret tree and keep your armor/shield up to date.
---
we can't say for sure, until BLizzard announces this.  
---
No need to post this every week :(
---
To maximize profits, they will release classic as fast as possible. They get the classic player money sooner.
---
*Ohhhh* all the level 20ish Taurens I gave up on. This is the game that taught me I have commitment issues ha
---
gear should be earned not bought in an mmorpg or it makes it kinda worthless.
---
Protip when dealing with this boss : stand under the small archway just before you enter the pool area from Stair even side, that way the ability which knocks you up gets stopped by the roof of the arch \^\^ 
---
Great memories from ZF, love the place. 
---
Not only the Rogue got with [Precision](http://classicdb.ch/?spell=13845) a +Hit talent, the Paladin also got one with the same name [Precision](http://classicdb.ch/?spell=20193). The shaman can get [Nature's Guidance](http://classicdb.ch/?spell=16198) in the Restoration talent tree.
---
Maybe Rod of the sleepwalker from Blackfathom Deeps? 
---
As alliance you're in the shitter as 2-handed fury, for Horde it's the better option until you're essentially poking your head in Naxx.
---
Reason is BRE almost exclusively, that together with Rivenspike/annihilation, crystal yield and all the other armour shredding sources you'll be hitting the boss like it's got 0 armour, that coupled with WF is mental.
---
You'll want to use Bloodthirst&gt;Whirlwind&gt;Hamstring&gt;&gt;Cleave&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Heroic strike
---
Reason for the above is you're fishing for Flurry/WF procs with hamstring, and you absolutely never want to use heroic strike since a warriors DPS is capped by threat almost always, heroic strike's damage to threat conversion sucks.
---
They are. You can look them up any time in your browser. 
---
shaman can go a hybrid build for healing where you get the improved totem stuff from enhancement. Melees will love it but passing up mana tide is probably not the preferred choice for progression...
---
Ragnaros drops an axe (Spinal reaper) or you can get the legendary hammer (Sulfuras), Nefarian drops a sword (Ashkandi)
---
i want the same system, Vanilla used  
---
(just like the Majority here)
---
there are many more factors to count in than your comment implies  
---
My first character, druid, spent the first 5 levels auto attacking mobs, I was very confused when I saw some other druid shooting green balls of doom.
---
I used to raid Arms specced.
---
I would use Feint every other GCD so I wouldn't draw aggro with my probable 30 DPS.
---
I would buy a new item on the AH after 3 levels not caring for stats, only having items "up-to-date".
---
I didn't know anything about stats like + weapon skill, hit, defense
---
Making sure I wasn't the bomb on Geddon took all of my concentration.
---
We gave a binding to a hunter.
---
I used to ninja DC from raids at 22:00 cause it was my bedtime and blamed spotty internet.
---
As do i, Sadly i dont think this will happen i think we can safely assume anything they said on the stage at blizzcon is going to be in the game.
---
Is this blizzards vanilla or pserver mind you?
---
Cause they're on a 1 hour respawn with fixed spawn points, at this point in time there's an herb alt parked at every spot by multiple players trying to cash in on that 1 hour window.
---
Well, Ironforge is closer to Menethil Harbor, and thus to Kalimdor, and in general it's right in the center of the continent, which makes getting to more places convenient.
---
For me 3-4k is the sweet spot for vanilla \^\^ I too am interested to see how they will handle it. 
---
&gt;iirc you cant need on something that your class cannot use and this isn’t the case in vanilla as far as iv seen on pservers, if so doesn’t this stop colluding/ninja’ing?
---
Well if you have someone willing, you can always ask them to need on something you can't use, and to give it to you when no one's watching.
---
I don't really care as long as there won't be dynamic respawns or sharding past the first 1-2 weeks.
---
I mean, that still takes more effort than just needing everything. 
---
A bit late to the party but thanks very much for the poll (specially the more in depth one) ! It confirms my thoughts of servers not being infested by elitists.
---
In dungeons, on my first hunter, the second the tank or healer died in a pull I immediately dismissed pet and Feigned Death. Even if 4/5 of the other folks were still alive. I see which way the wind's blowing and I ain't payin no repair bills!
---
Well, thats pretty fucking simple math. If they release the game sooner and get like xxxk new subs. Thats about x million per month. If you wait for aiming between BFA launches, you are loosing that money anyways and only maybe gaining that you dont loose that many subs (more than likely for a month).
---
Remember, BFA has tokens, classic doesnt. If you gain a classic sub, you get the money from every player. In BFA only part of the playerbase needs to spend money on it, to keep everyone playing. 
---
The main reason for going Precision at that point, is to continue down the Prot tree. 
---
I think with all the damage talents in Ret, excluding Vengeance (too unreliable imo) and SoCom, from tier 3 and onwards, you end up with something like 15% damage increase? assuming no gear with +hit. 
---
Levelling to me is about having good uptime, not necessarily good damage. While Sanctity Aura is a nice 5% damage increase (if we assume 50% of our damage is from white hits), Devo Aura/Resistance Aura will decrease damage taken a bit, so in terms of uptime the end result is probably lower than 5% difference. 
---
Depending on the mob(s) you're fighting, Reckoning and Precision could come close to that. Granted (both in going deep Ret and deep Prot at this stage, you won't have all the damage talents until lvl 58). I do believe Reckoning build is a bit more "fun" to play, than a "Crit" build (if you can call deep Ret that), and you can start the proc chance from lvl 54 and onwards. 
---
You do get a lot of benefits though. 25% cd reduction on HoJ, BoK for better group buffs (not sure if it's better for solo in terms of uptime compared to BoM/BoW). And Option to go Guardian's Favor if you want to PvP. 
---
I still have to do research on how large a benefit Redoubt + Imp Shield Spec + 2/5 Toughness is compared to Imp Devo Aura and 5/5 Toughness (basically if it's worth taking useless talents while solo, to be stronger in dungeons when tanking)
---
Since we already have every detail of vanilla and people will be racing for every world first, you’ll have Naxx geared PvPers destroying random BGs very early on Classic servers. 
---
The number of people who will go into Classic to ruin the game for other people is not small. Wander around in any online game and see how many jerks just play to make make the game miserable for others. Now hand them a game where every detail and grief strategy is well documented and will not be changed.
---
Not how it works.  
---
You're thinking that classic is limitless fountain of subs for whole eternity.   
---
Its limited just like everything else. It has certain number of years for a lifespan. Sure there will be still some people playing many years down the line, but not nearly as much.  
---
As such, they are trying to maximize the profits by not strangling BFA playerbase and making it compete with Classic and vice versa but trying to make them work together, dynamically. To fill the gaps for each other and to keep people subbed for longer.  
---
There is no "classic sub". There is just one subscription. For blizzard it doesn't matter if they get 1000$ from 1 person and 1$ from 1000 persons, outside of game pop.  
---
You're still able to form groups the old way. I think the bigger issue is that most people didn't want to, especially tanks and healers. Why take 30min forming a group when you have a 2 min queue?
---
We still found friends in lfd, too. When you got a good group you would just pound through dungeons until someone had to leave, shooting the shit the whole time. I didn't make friends because they were on my server, they became friends because they were chill players regardless of server. 
---
Exactly. Hence the every other ZG doll is 1g, mage doll 80g.
---
I don't think even ninja looters would go that far...
---
I know the feel. I thought I had forgotten about and was done with WoW. Moved on with my life, to more productive and relevant things. Classic made all those original feelings come flooding back. 
---
If you can buy gems with gold, and make gold playing the game, can't you get them by playing the game? I got the primeval set without spending a dime
---
I loved the crazy high pop on nost would not be against blizzard doing it.
---
Both are just speculative
---
Still 30 million a month, not including other mtx income. There's no way their overhead is even close to that. 
---
&gt; There is no "classic sub".
---
If i dont have several hundred thousands of gold in retail, im flat out paying the $15. And this will be the same situation for majority of private server players. They left retail years ago. So for them, the token thing isnt a thing.
---
I dont expect retail players play classic more than 2 weeks. So their "sub" money isnt going to carry classic. I expect the CLASSIC community to have massive increase in subs, period. And those playing classic have VERY little interest ever to login to retail. And for a retail player... if they like retail, i dont see them playing classic, at all.
---
So while you think they do "work together" id say its going to give blizzard maybe +1 sub to a retail player and then nothing until blizzard does like TBC. 
---
Dynamic respawns is fine imo
---
Bonereavers edge is indeed a sword
---
They're talking about [Bonereaver's Edge](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=17076/bonereavers-edge)
---
This picture is not including the bench paladin were on yeah 
---
Gw2 is solely based on cosmetics as well. There's, what, 3 item tiers and they're like within %5 of each other? 
---
Then there is no reason to use dodging as a reason for cross realm bgs
---
I think Durotar is the fastest 1 to 10 leveling in the game if you understand the quest order. If you don't know it I bet it sucks though I figured it out on accident when the game released all those years ago.
---
&gt;If i dont have several hundred thousands of gold in retail, im flat out paying the $15. And this will be the same situation for majority of private server players. They left retail years ago. So for them, the token thing isnt a thing. 
---
point being?  
---
&gt; dont expect retail players play classic more than 2 weeks. So their "sub" money isnt going to carry classic. I expect the CLASSIC community to have massive increase in subs, period. And those playing classic have VERY little interest ever to login to retail. And for a retail player... if they like retail, i dont see them playing classic, at all.  
---
Your experience is mostly from private server players which are mostly composed of vanilla only players. They still have a lot of people that play retail tho, me for example.  
---
And what do you mean by 
---
&gt;I expect the CLASSIC community to have massive increase in subs, period 
---
? Yea going from 0 to 10 or more is definitely massive increase. ???  
---
&gt;So while you think they do "work together" id say its going to give blizzard maybe +1 sub to a retail player and then nothing until blizzard does like TBC  
---
That's just plain ignorant. Plenty of people who quit long time ago will come for classic hype, realize its not for them, see that they have sub active and try out retail, which does not require you buying the game anymore btw (except newest xpack)  
---
Yes there is. Did you just ignore everything I said about the mechanics which allow you to dodge? 
---
Hi, /u/NewBlock
---
Unfortunately your post has been removed because it was thought to be low effort.

If you feel this was an error or have any questions, please send us a [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fclassicwow). Thanks!
---
&gt; ? Yea going from 0 to 10 or more is definitely massive increase. ???
---
With those hundreds of thousands of players playing in private servers, i think we can hit 11.
---
Do you really think that **people that are hyped for classic** want to play retail ? Jeesus, if they wanted to play retail, they would be playing retail. Im sure you can make a account and try it out free, right now ?
---
&gt;Do you really think that people that are hyped for classic want to play retail ?  
---
Your problem, like already mentioned, is that you think only vanilla private server players want to play classic.  
---
Very ignorant.  
---
You can only get to level 20 for free account. With sub active you can go to 110.  
---
F
---
Maybe, but I don't remember ever doing BFD back in the day. Might have been too far for my human priest. :P
---
Of course they would, it's easy.
---
&gt; Your problem, like already mentioned, is that you think only vanilla private server players want to play classic.
---
Your problem is that you thin that returning players or classic hype players want to play retail. I can assure you, most dont give a flying fuck about retail. And thats why its loosing subs.
---
Yep - hunter pet are, esp annoying for NEs who go to Elwyn
---
Melee only has an active community because of sweaty nerds with autism.
---
If I recall correctly, potions only trigger the global cooldown and that's it. 
---
I agree, but at the same time its sad walking out of Org and not seeing people duel.
---
Something in between would be sweet. 
---
Although the gear was seriously powerful I still think it should be left as it is. The people who got far enough and have the commitment to really get there, surely deserves it. With that said, I don't think you have to be too worried, yet. Very few people will raid Naxx in a near future. Even after launch. 
---
Absolutely. Naxx gear is insanely powerful, far off the power curve established from ZG-&gt;MC-&gt;BWL-&gt;AQ. They jacked up damage output far faster that survivability. Once there becomes a decent population of Nax geared players the server is basically dead because running into them is not even a game anymore.
---
This is one of the things where people don't get that Classic is fundamentally different than Vanilla. In Vanilla the craziness of Nax gear wasn't an issue since they knew TBC was coming along to level the playing field into something reasonable again. Why not throw some insane toys to the few players who managed to stick with their characters and grind out all the content? Now that we're looking at Nax as high-end with no TBC in sight, this will be a problem. Either Blizzard adjusts itemization, adds some kind of built-in character balancing mechanic like resilience, or just keeps launching fresh servers to deal with it as the private server community has done.
---
no it does not. i mean lore wise useing abilities like mortal strike or whirlwind would also reset your swing timer if you think about it. how do you autoattack someone and mortal strike them at the exact same time?
---
How on earth is a comment conceded for the long term health of the game short-sighted?
---
Doesn’t work for linen banadages.
---
It matters because once you have Nax geared players roaming the countryside, the game becomes miserable, everybody rerolls to F R E S H and your server dies, not a great look for a game that people want to last for awhile.
---
DPS war bis is all about stacking giant piles of hit and +wep skill that matter in pve and not pvp. What Nax gear does for a warrior's damage output and survability in pvp is the stone cold nuts.
---
Yeah, I feel this in my bones. Stopped for the most part in cata, and now I'm making up pro and con lists for class/race
---
&gt;Your problem is that you think that returning players or classic hype players want to play retail  
---
Your problem is assuming things. Nobody said they want to play retail. They might just happen to play it. That's what blizzard is counting on as well.  
---
&gt;I can assure you, most dont give a flying fuck about retail. And thats why its loosing subs.  
---
Still gonna have more than Classic.  
---
&gt;About that L20. Thats about where i expect most retail players ever to get in classic. And that might be too optimistic.
---
Well yea since most classes are boring as sin.  
---
You dont vendor cloth anyway. If you have extra you AH it. People buy it for tailoring
---
With the number of people playing on some servers I've personally seen some cloth sell on the AH near vendor price.
---
Make a party with a tank, a heal and a well geared mage and farm Strat live for orbs
---
I mean, I don't think it will happen very early. It will take months and months to even get close to it. But I do worry about how powerful these players will be.
---
That's a new Orgrimmar background, buddy!
---
Nature's Guidance is probably the biggest sleeper talent in all of Vanilla. People love to bitch about the speed of resto leveling, but Nature's Guidance is probably the best leveling talent a shaman could have. The talents main problem is that shaman talents are so spread out that it's hard to find points for it in your lvl 60 build, so many people will pass it up in order to avoid a respec later on. 
---
I definitely don't want them fucking around with resilience. 
---
I do feel like some slight nerfing of the stats would be okay, however they need to be careful. Because it is end game content snd they should have really powerful gear. But not quite godlike.
---
In case of emergency, break glass
---
There is a big difference. Phasing is the action of switching between phases of areas, for example the reflection of different stages of a quest on an area. Sharding is a dynamic virtual realm management, mainly used to eliminate performance issues or to hinder overpopulation in an area. Phasing is an important element for storytelling, while sharding is one way to improve performance.
---
The gear was never the goal in arena it was just a means to an end (that end being staying competitive to other peoples pvp gear), most of the people I played with were pvp junkies. We played arena because it was fun and challenging, and the competition stayed competitive as you went through the ranks, making you a better player in the end. After playing through vanilla where in order to stay competitive you had to either dedicate 16 hours a day to try to get rank 14 or you had to raid for months on end, being able to do what I enjoyed the most (pvp against equally geared equally skilled players) was a huge breath of fresh air.
---
If its 5-6k at start, its going to be 4k soon. And remember these are REGIONAL servers. Meaning the servers will have low pop hours. 
---
&gt;there was a PvP scene even before BGs were a thing. The call was "Southshore is under attack". "Crossroads is under attack". "Stormwind is under attack". etc. And there was no deserter debuff if you left and quested somewhere else.   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;With World Raid PVP any faction's advantage is counterbalanced by NPC guards. It's so simple. There was no need to institutionalize it.
---
why not frame bfa and legion while ur at it bud 
---
It all depends. If it's someone else, not very fast. If it's me, very fast.
---
superb argument
---
It depends a lot on the classes facing each other.  If you have a shaman/pally/druid duel going it could last forever.  If someone is fully geared they aren't getting one shot, but depending on the gear a highly geared and well trinketed warlock could take them out in 3 shadowbolts.
---
mop was the final straw for me so I didnt get those haha
---
Totally agree on this
---
My goals for Classic are:
---
- Get T0 for my enhancement shaman
---
- Get T0.5 for my enhancement shaman
---
- Get T2.5 for my enhancement shaman
---
BURN HIM! HERETIC!
---
Mara, DM West, solo hearthglen.. I did them each for fun and good gold farming.  Hearthglen you just use a succubus and seduce between shadowbolts and the mobs melt.  They drop around 1 gold each and some nice cloth and vendorable items
---
They said they’re releasing it summer of 2019, March through May isn’t event summer yet lol. 
---
It will be released this summer, they won’t push it back, there will be no need. It will be released between June and September.
---
I would suggest looking this up on youtube and see if it sounds good for you. You can also look up videos discussing both games. 
---
Since blizzard announced they would release classic wow again, many players have been uploading videos on youtube discussing the game and what to look forward to for new and returning players. "Tips out" has many videos about it as an example. You can look up "why was vanilla so great" and he discusses the different parts of the game, dungeons, questing, raiding, pvp. 
---
I'm pretty much in your exact position bro. Took my sweet ass time leveling early BC, was gearing up tier 1, gruuls &amp; magtheridons. I got the kill all the content like you did but it was only after the boost. Join the dope guild in wrath. Got all the way to algalon in ulduar then quit all the sudden. Probably thanks to this outdoor class I took at uni. Anyways I can't wait to go back and experience all the raids of vanilla and tbc, as they still are all pretty fresh to me.
---
I'm gonna miss death knights, enjoyed mine immensely during wotlk. I know it would never happen and that everyone would throw a hissy fit, but I would kinda like a vanilla balanced DK class
---
definitely should be same as retail, 0 reason or logic behind needing on something you cannot even equip except griefing other people  
---
[NA-Central] Horde *RP-PvP(or PvP) name to be determined.
---
Hello everyone. My brother and I have been playing wow since the summer of 2005. We have experience on retail as well as private servers. Our idea of fun is using teamwork to dominate world pvp and breeze through raids.
---
This guild will be focused primarily on world pvp during the first few months with weekly raids on alliance cities and hotspots. Since most players will want to focus on leveling, Wednesday nights will be reserved for organized pvp. Although chances are on any given night you will find people to pvp with. A certain well known server released information that stated it took the average player around 250 hours to reach level 60. That's roughly between 3-4 months playing around 15-20 hours per week which we believe is the sweet spot for people like us. We have jobs, families, and respect things like exercise and not pooping into socks. If that sounds like you, you're one of us.
---
Once we have enough of a core group to start raiding Wednesday's will be a raid night as well as either Tuesday's and\or Thursday's depending on popularity.
---
Loot will be distributed based on a contribution point system for non set pieces, and loot council for set pieces. Loot council will be elected each season by the members of each role(healer, melee[+hunters], and ranged). This allows players that are capable of contributing the most to the guild to see the most return while also avoiding loot council corruption.
---
If anyone is interested let me know. The discord is up and bot is running, guild documents are just about done, however most of our recruitment will be done in game.
---
I really 'missed' vanilla. Sure I've played it but I sucked because I was just too young and wasn't mature enough. So I left, then played a lot of MMO's, always comparing it to WoW in my mind. Now after 10x years of both causal and hardcore gaming under my belt, I can finally achieve things I couldn't do when I was young.
---
For example I recall doing ZG once (my only raiding experience) and being too scared to talk in the mic due to my clearly childish voice.
---
Yeah but it's not 6 hours or nothing. I used to play vanilla all day everyday. Now that I have a job and kids I can't do that. That doesn't mean I'm not going to play, it will just mean I can play less. The average age of my guild in classic is like 32, most are old hardcore raiders that now have IRL obligations.
---
Fucking hell not only do you think world PvP is anything like competitive PvP but you actually think guards balance it?
---
Either troll somewhere else or go get examined by a doctor for brain lesions. 
---
Oh damn. Was this is in original vanilla?
---
Depends. 
---
Mages are silly. 
---
Here I come as a warrior, doing my own thing. Notice I get targeted and polyied. Casting pyroblast and Im dead before I can even reach him. 
---
The Axe, Mace and Nef Sword are terrible in comparison because of the way armor penetration scales. You get your Bonereaver at the start of the game and switch to dual wield around the time Naxx arrives and everybody else has up-to-date weapons already.
---
Cata is not worthy of being framed.
---
Man, I wish I had kept my original box now that's a cool idea
---
Hunters farm mara like crazy and lots take herbing for the shrooms so they are often quite cheap on the ah
---
&lt;Working Adults&gt; \[H\] US-PvP
---
We are all working adults now with a much greater time  commitment to real-life and less free time to play than we did 10-15 years ago. But, we still want to progress and do the best we're able with the time we have. We plan on being a semi-serious raiding guild with a very structured weekly raiding schedule to allow us older players a chance to progress without  burning out. Raids will be capped to twice a week and 3 to 4 hours per raid night. 
---
PvP will be supported but not required. Discord is not available yet, but will be soon.

If anything, it would be lower, so they can use their crappy micro servers or whatever the name is.
---
Interesting how the servers nowadays handle less people than it used to. Activision downgrade at its finest.
---
It comes down to gear disparity.  Naxx geared vs level 60 blues, you will get 3 shot if you aren't very careful.  But on a similar gear level, most all folks have a fighting chance.  
---
Not having resilience does make PVP go very quickly though, if you remember BC or Wotlk/Cata pvp this is a lot quicker as many classes have more burst potential.  CC is the equalizer as the automatic limit of duration isn't there, so you can have fear or polymorph that goes for 20 sec, so it's more important to try and control the fight than just charge in and start spamming abilities. 
---
No they shouldn’t be a d no they won’t be.

Don't get me wrong that is great. That aspect of it wasn't the issue, it was the fact it became the focus of PvP due to it's ease of entry and high gear output. If it was just for fun, even balanced around separately with one gear set and offered title rewards it would have been great.

---
Not sure if this picture is original or not, but it’s certainly very accurate. Right in front of UBRS got especially skeletonny when people started running BWL as people would sit here to guard the entrance so their friends could make it in safe.
---
I still remember the night I quit. It was 2007 during TBC's early days. We had only recently cleared Kara. It was warm. I couldn't sleep. I played with the thought only for a few minutes before making up my mind. I logged in at 2am. I told the only officer online that I was quitting. Told him I was no longer enjoying myself. He suggested I take a month break but I needed out. I stripped my undead mage naked. A cold sweat fell over my body. I disenchanted everything. Gave the guild my hoards of goodies and never logged in again on that account. Gave it to a friend. He transferred my mage (and paladin I leveled to max through boredom).
---
I still think about my guild mates from back then. How shocked they were. Some of them even angry. They didn't understand that the game had become stale for me. It was probably my own fault for playing too much. I burnt myself out. I do it all the time with games. Play them to death then never touch them again. I had a similar experience in ARK when I destroyed hundreds of hours of work with a fire wyvern. Killing every top level dinosaur imaginable.   
---
Depends on the spec. For example for Fury Warrior's it's extremely good because the spec double dips on hit chance improvements: Your average damage goes up because you hit more, but in addition to that your rage generation goes up as well, meaning you can hit more buttons. Especially pre-endgame warriors always have the problem of never having enough rage to use all available DPS abilities. More hit helps a lot with that. 
---
I think bonereaver is quite a rare drop though isn’t it?
---
I think people tend to forget that Vanilla isn’t about getting the best weapon available, but making the weapons that you do collect work. It’s going to take a while before every rogue has perditions and every warlock has a staff of dominance and the list goes on and on.
---
That’s part of what makes Vanilla so great, you feel like a rag tag bunch of adventurers who are trying to do their best with whatever crap they happen to stumble across.
---
You can even take screenshot and share them on secret communities like reddit its totally safe
---
Nah it's from Nostalrius
---
While I prefer classic over any expansion I enjoyed Cata up to the mess LFR brought into it and quit a few weeks after the shit DS was. 
---
Ofc it wasn't close to classic but not much different to Wotlk (subpar story though and messed up world).
---
But I get the hate seeing it established LFR and more Ca$h$shop crap resulting in a very fast downfall of WoW 
---
True you could still form the old way, but most people by then never looked at chat or ignored "LFX for dungeon X" in chat.  As for the insta queue, yes it was great to only have a 2 minute pop time as a healer, but sucked when as soon as you tp'd in the rest of the party inspects you and kicks you out cause your gear is "not up to snuff" for a dungeon you can walk through blindfolded.
---
I loved finding a group where you'd talk and joke during the run, then at the end someone say "up  for another?" and the same party hits 3-4 straight dungeons.   Loved those times.
---
Definitely representative of actual vanilla though.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hE0zVZxZgccd0eq

Here's a hybrid shaman build that still has pretty good healing but takes away the 6 talent points required to get mana tide (5 of which are very weak!) and makes it more viable to spam downranked lightning bolts, wait for clearcast, and then hit max rank spells.  Can also downrank healing wave (since you have healing way) for very mana efficient heals.  
---
The more 'classic' 30/0/21 elemental/resto also can heal pretty well and has quicker casts for offense spells.  The big problem with this in PVE is that you'll go OOM if you're spamming offensive spells, unless you're using rank 4 or something at which point why bother? 
---
However, these specs would be totally fine for 5-mans.  Raiding is where you might get scrutinized depending on your guild. 
---
One wears dresses the other you look good 
---
I believe the point was "sub only", meaning no RMT at all.
---
This allows a game to be made with only consideration for game content itself that is equally accessible to all players. It's a foundation design principle that utterly and completely vanishes the very instant RMT practices are added in any capacity.
---
It has nothing to do with running or looking better however.
---
Ragnaros' loot table is relatively large with a decent amount of "dead" items. They're all pretty much equally weighted and even the Eye has a 5 ish percent chance to drop. Some guilds will be disenchanting them before other guilds even see their first, it boils down to dumb luck.
---
With that said, MC is relevant content for essentially the whole game. It isn't that far fetched to count on EVENTUALLY getting specific items from there if you're consistently playing.
---
In actual Vanilla basically nobody had full Naxx gear. But damage scales faster than survivability so the higher gear levels are burstier overall.
---
Vanilla is also more RNG-heavy than later expansions. Crits were a much bigger deal because everyone's DPS was condensed into fewer abilities. In modern WoW it's not gamechanging if you crit with Mortal Strike for example, because its maybe 15% of your damage. In Vanilla PvP it might be 50%+.
---
Nobody is getting literally 1-shot with a single ability outside of a major gear discrepancy, but it could get pretty close with some luck.
---
I moved last year and I had every blizzard box back to Diablo I and I tossed them all thinking I had no reason to keep them and they took up space. I regret that after seeing what I could have done with them
---
No not really. Naxx came out during the time Blizzard was already developing TBC and the gear scaling for the raid was aligned to fit into the progression toward TBC.
---
As a stand alone product, devoid of future progression concerns within future expansions, Naxx is woefully unbalanced.
---
This is the amount of effort I deem suitable for all of the "[IceBucket/10yr/whatever] Challenge" things.
---
Or 1 soulfire. 
---
The spec required is otherwise completely impractical, but I had to try to see how hard it could crit. The answer was 10k. Great for WSG to stop the flag carrier, but no other pvp situation allows for a 4 sec uninterrupted cast.
---
Let me guess....single much?
---
What about the Warrior class? They can use every item apart from wands.
---
Odd because i recovered an account in MoP and had only the original cd key. They found the old account off that and attached it to my then current battle.net account right along side my current wow account. Both keys have been attached to the same bnet ever since.
---
Yeah, you're gimping yourself so hard otherwise.  Warlocks are a great resource for WSG defense in general that it would be a shame to waste it on a gimmick spec. 
---
&gt;t has nothing to do with running or looking better  
---
except it does  
---
there's multithreading now, increased view distance, better optimatization (fps) and more  
---
https://www.wowhead.com/news=287727/new-multithread-optimizations-coming-in-patch-8-1-tides-of-vengeance  
---
If game can run better, that automatically makes it look better because you can increase the graphics without suffering low fps  
---
Everybody res up at once and fear them!
---
Yeah there was always ganking happening in Black Rock Mountain. And sometimes big fights at entrances of raids and dungeons. For example often I had to stealth my way inside Black Rock Depths to avoid a party of the opposite faction. Fun stuff.
---
One shotting an equally geared player? Nah. 
---
Reason #1,309 why I'll be playing on a PvE server. 
---
1st thing, and I respect vanilla players because I am one of them: DO NOT LISTEN TO PLAYERS WHO PLAYED ON 10k SERVERS!
---
These people talk about "Blizz-like" and "no changes" yet play on servers massively adjusted to handle 10k players. Those servers trivialized pve leveling and Classic's RPG status. 10k servers are playgrounds, they are fun parks and about as broken as a "no change" argument as one can get compared to the original Classic Wow.
---
That said, I do hope the server cap is slightly adjusted upward. Somewhere between 3-5k is fine and I've played on vanilla servers with this population and it highly functional while preserving similar rare item spawn rates that Blizzard has been quoted in saying was a planned mechanic for limited quantities of raid consumables so not to trivialize raiding. 10k servers are BATHED in nearly unlimited resources and are critically deviant from original Classic design.
---
Yeah, Classic is gonna get pretty silly eventually. It's why I REALLY hope they put similar delays on content as they did in Vanilla so we have plenty of time on each loot tier, rather than rushing straight to T3. 
---
I think the balance and fun of the game was best around T2, and it'd be a shame for that to be surpassed immediately.
---
Reason #1 I'm playing on a PvP server.
---
Did you know using a Halloween wand popped rogues out of stealth?  I found that out while waiting on someone to make it into the instance while our rogue was pickpocketing mobs.
---
Cal was a good rogue and vanished immediately.  I couldn't apologize enough.
---
But its 2 raid tiers above t2. The gap is fairly reasonable in my mind. 
---
This Kungen guy might have been really good a leading a guild to world firsts, but he is really bad at getting a point across. 
---
Even when he is right, he makes mistakes in details, or just does a bad job explaining what he actually means, jumps back and forth, etc etc.  A very bad speaker.
---
(it doesn't help that this is just a some twitch stream semi-monologue  , I am sure if he sad down and wrote down his ideas on this subject we would get a much better piece.)
---
Yes, it is a theory, but also one based on the fact I haven't used that account in over 5 years, it worked perfectly fine on the forums up until threads and accounts started getting deleted and limited in the Classic forums and I refer ONLY to the characters listed on the forum character selection option and not the actual game account which may still have my characters perfectly fine and intact. 
---
My characters to select to be able to post may have nothing to do with the actual characters on my account. They don't want me posting.
---
This has to be the dumbest video I have seen all week. Trash joke also
---
3-4k would be a busy server. Starting out with 2.5k would be bad cause eventually the population will be halved after launch. Imagine playing on a server with 1250 players total 1 year down the line. I've seen that route on multiple private servers. 
---
Warrior's are the same. Just some dude in the PvP areas of cities. Other than darn where they hang out with the blacksmiths.
---
You might aswell remove the 5 points from Enhancement tree and put them into Elemental to get Elemental fury.
---
No one has full naxx gear lol
---
At lv 60 4,000 health was a good cutoff to know you were able to PVP well.
---
Questing blues and some max level gear wouldn't get you to 4k. You needed some pvp gear or some high stam stuff.  But 4k was the cutoff we saw as 'okay you can survive a bit now" when we played.
---
As an enhance shaman with the unstoppable force, if my windfury's crit cloth and he had less than 4k health I most likely one shot him.
---
Under 4k at the time, you're not gonna last long. Especially if a rogue gets on you or a MS warrior.  
---
But yeah no one had full naxx gear and no, you won't have full naxx gear or likely even see naxx in wow classic.
---
Blackrock Mountain was a fun murder dome on Friday/Saturday Evenings on my server pre-AQ/Naxx. Every guild would descend on it trying to get into their raids.
---
Alliance would lock down Thorium Point. Horde mounted up in Kargath. Horde had to join up en masse to just get into the mountain. It would get restless waiting for the whole guild to get there and duels would happen to pass the time. Naturally, prowling rogues would look for cheap kills, even with sentries posted. 
---
The run up to the mountain was usually clean if you went in a pack and stuck to the southern rim of Searing Gorge, although there were a couple spots where mages could ambush with AOE. Once you got to the doors though all bets were off. So many people in one spot meant insane lag. You basically would just aim where you wanted to go and spam any aoe/defensive abilities to stay alive.
---
Molten Core was the easier one to reach; just aim for a certain spot on the big rim walkway and jump off. BWL was trickier; Each faction would try to control the walkway (through the door to the right on the screenshot). If you came up at the wrong time you were almost guaranteed to die. Most of my entrances to that raid came via rezzing right next to the orb and immediately zoning in. I kind of laugh at the youtubers talking about how world buffs will make everything too easy. If you can coordinate with your guild to get a majority of people to the raid without dying, then you deserve the buffs.
---
Coming outside after the raids the whole interior of the north side of the mountain could look like the screenshot. Fun times (seriously, it was actually really fun).
---
God help you if you wanted to run LBRS, UBRS, or BRD at that time. 
---
&gt; Highmaul was the first raid of the expansion.
---
that doesn;t matter, realm first is realm first.  if it was so easy, and he was not among the best, other guild(s) should have cleared it faster, but they didn't.  
---
Note : I have never seen this Kungen guy play, nor watched any of his streams, just wanted to explain this in general.   I did raid in a server first guild myself in 2005-2006, but we were always 2-3 months behind world first, on a more casual server.  (in fact, once realm transfers  were possible some of the more fanatical raiders on our server got recruited by Nihilum and other more hardcore guilds, because they couldn't find that level of play on our server.  obviously that makes the casual server go even slower, when some of the best players vanish.
---
Some class quests can only be done with your racial trainers. Be wary. 
---
Some quest lines are racial only like the water well quest line in Mulgore.
---
Naxx gear is not a balanced or particularly fun item tier for the long term, it's very much a crazy godmode endgame before the MMO as you know it dies (to make way for TBC). 
---
I wouldn't adjust any stats, but Blizzard needs to significantly delay Naxx's release - it originally took almost 2 years to come out. Classic will be a completely different game if they release it in 6 months.
---
Realm first means almost nothing now. It meant more in 2005-2006. Back then you were guaranteed to have 2-3 guides per faction competing to clear a raid. 
---
Now there’s a huge chance your Realm First is also a “Realm Only” since everything but the top 10 pop realms will rarely have more than a guild or two trying to clear Mythic. 
---
So if he got Realm First on Illidan US, or another similarly busy server EU side, then it’s a marginally cool achievement. But still not a huge deal. 
---
World first is legit the only thing that matters. He was quite far from world first, on a raid that isn’t hard. 
---
It’s like him getting a Realm First Ragnaros. Yes it’s an accomplishment. But not really an important one. 
---
Some advice:  
---
I think you make some good points in this topic, but you get downvoted a lot because of your excessive use of hyperboles ('1000 times worse..'   'weren't a tank you were nothing...'  etc etc.  Cut down a bit on those  and put some more time in explaining what you mean and I think a lot more people would agree with you.  
---
Looking for an EU Alliance guild, PvP realm. 
---
Looking for a guild raiding from around 7pm/6:30pm UK time since I'm in the UK (8pm/7:30pm CET).
---
I will be playing druid, would much prefer to play feral offtank but planning on gearing up resto as well. I have previous raid tank experience on retail from Cata through to Legion as DK, also played Warrior, Monk and DH occasionally but I don't feel like doing the warrior grind in Classic. 
---
I started playing WoW in Cata, before that I raided as the top DPS in my medium-hardcore guild (Hunter) in LOTRO and before that I was one of the top ranked PvPers on my server in Star Wars Galaxies.
---
I'm a student so I intend to nolife the launch and be at 60 in the first  7-10 days, looking for a serious raiding guild.
---
If you're basing those assumptions on what happens on private serves, I think thats an irrelevent comparison.  Private servers are guesswork.
---
My concern is primarily the buffs that were added in 1.12 being used on content that was designed for a pre-1.12 state.  I think they need to account for that.
---
I don't think there is a single talent as valuable for healing as illumination for the other three classes. In a raid environment if Mana Tide or NS is a make or break for success with 39 other players, you got some bigger issues to handle. 
---
But I think ultimately you should let your guild know. It's gonna be pretty obvious when you are the only paladin under performing
---
My advice is to spec full holy for now and once you have the raid content on farm mode, you will then have enough gear to make your spec more flexible.  
---
ah ok, I stopped raiding in TBC myself, mostly because of the reasons  Kungen brings up in his monologue , so I kinda agree with him, but I think he does a very bad job presenting his ideas .
---
I mean... yeah. If you keep talking about private servers you're probably just banned or suspended from the forums. I don't think that's a good way to go about it bc like you said ppl who play on private servers are usually supportive of Classic, but it is what it is
---
What exactly do you think about that takes more effort?
---
I still own the boxes but i misplace my TBC one :(
---
on my server they usually were the 2nd or 3rd most expensive 'normal' herb ,  after Plaguebloom and sometimes Gromsblood 
---
(normal, not counting lotus)
---
rip thats the best one
---
I don't understand what all the fuss is about these [discs](https://imgur.com/a/Xtrl4MA) 
---
Honestly. To me he just sounds like someone with a minor mental disorder. I’ve watched 2-3 of his longer more popular vids, and the guy sounds like he has a minor depressive disorder or something. 
---
He’s negative without ever clearly expressing, in accurate detail, why he is negative or exactly what he dislikes. He will kinda start to, but then switch into “damn kids get off my lawn” mode and just rant. 
---
The funniest part is how he contradicts himself in his own videos. Like he will talk shit about warlocks. He says they have bad dps etc. Then you see his screenshots and his guilds single Warlock will always be in the top 5-6 dps. 
---
He kinda tries to explain that in one of his vids “oh his dps is good because he was the only guy getting Warlock gear” but that doesn’t really make sense, as the only Warlock only pieces are tier....
---
If you watch his vids, you’ll see that the legend is just that. A legend. He’s either declined somehow, or just wasn’t ever really that good. 
---
I’m leaning towards the latter the more I listen to him. 
---
so much, not sure if i wanna frame them like the post i saw or if i just wanna keep the boxes to put on a shelf
---
I was listening to Classicast with one of the early Blizz devs. He said 2k was the magic number, where you'd see enough people for it to be populated, but not so crowded that it would be frustrating.
---
Here's the full podcast, it is really interesting if you have the time.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rd-Zt8bueFk
---
There is only 3 worth framing :^)
---
2K is way too low and blizz servers were actually 4k sometimes back in the day
---
Itemization sucked back then so with a mage you will be completing with the other casters. 
---
If you make a warrior on the ally side.. you will bump into Ret paladins. 
---
Nice, it even worked to pay by the hour for wow in internet cafes? Still not viable. Ok.
---
This just made me so nostalgic for WoW Classic now.
---
" He was usually fine, albeit maybe a bit taxing on healers. We wiped once because he got crit twice on a boss in MC "  
---
This was not an issue with spec, it was an issue with his gear. If he could be crit he shouldn't have been tanking. That is a primary failure to understand his class and your GM had every right to be mad.
---
If Dire maul is in at launch. Why include the unarmored mounts.
---
In my memories it goes "Vanilla then Wrath" as i started in late Vanilla and was bad at leveling and would make a new alt every few months so i would never get that far.
---
Fights against mages and rogues can be very short and bursty. Make sure you have a stack of major healing potions and whipper root tubers on you at all times. 
---
Blizzard used a class based need system for a while. I just can’t remember what release it was in.
---
If you use keybinds, you don't need to show most abilities because most don't have cooldowns. When I played my mage I had every single spell and ability, down to portals and conjuring food, on keybinds. I only had one bar showing with my cooldowns to track them easily. Cleaner UI that way. Technically you could go without bars at all if you wanted to use an add-on to track your CD timers instead.
---
You won’t be missed 
---
Eh AQ gear is only t2.5. I mean  it's really only 1 tier above. 
---
I agree they should delay naxx quite a bit 
---
If they implement loot trading, I will with no doubt bring my friends to gear up quickly.
---
There isn't a best.
---
You can be annoying as hell as a mage with a flamestrike/blizzard in large scale pvp for ccing.
---
Warlocks can spam dots freely cause they can lifetap 
---
Shadow priests are better off focus firing as they have no mana recover abilities outside of drinking. 
---
AQ is a raid teir above BWL. I believe its called 2.5 merely because it wasn't geared the same way with a focus towards different aspects of each class. Its still a full teir above 2. The gear that came out of AQ40 was better than BWL in most cases. 
---
I quit at TBC, and for about 12 years I would definitely miss playing the game here and there. Then I heard about classic. It was like inception in my brain to play again. 
---
**&lt;Wanderlust&gt; [Alliance] EU-PvE | English language**
---
**Our Philosophy:**
---
No rush, no guides. Let's play the game and learn it that way. Many of our members are new to Vanilla or at least to Vanilla raiding. We would like to experience the game to the fullest by going in "blind" and taking our time. (This should be taken as "first few times", for fun and flavor. We are not overzealous.) Veterans are of course welcome if they are fine with the style. There are already members with extensive WoW experience. We know this will take a lot of time but we are fine with it.
---
Progression. Although we should be relaxed and not rush anywhere, we should progress through all content eventually. Wipes on first tries of raids are completely expected but eventually we should learn them and clear them efficiently for progressing to the next one. The same goes for characters. We should be somewhat relaxed, not demanding the utmost in min/maxed builds. But just goofing off with "joke" builds shouldn't be our style either. Anything which works reliably for progression will be fine but no less.
---
**Who are we looking for:**
---
Anyone wishing to experience the whole game in a relaxed but mature atmosphere and who is prepared to take it slow with us. Focus is on raiding reliably, which means that people should show up and perform sufficiently. You don't need to know know stuff or be good at the game now, just be willing to improve and get good enough for raiding. Gear distribution will favor reliable progression. We should also be able to help each other in every facet of the game but apart from raiding, everything is optional. 
---
**Raiding related information:**
---
* We'll start raiding at least 6 month from release. You can use the time as you see fit, leveling slowly or leveling more than one char.
---
* Raid times are up for discussion still but I expect two raids on weekdays. (Most likely around 19-23 CET)
---
* Loot council (most likely).
---
Anyone interested, message me!
---
i'm not sure you understood but not gonna bother
---
I remember these fights, and they were wonderful.
---
Everyone with their little buffs, running innocently into MC, and then...  the main tank was sapped, the priests were sheeped, and chaos rained down upon them from the Horde hidden within the entrance of BRD, one single scout advising on when they were coming down the chain...  
---
I also remember the first time that we were cornered trying to get into UBRS as a 10-man.  We had come in through the Gorge, took the lower entrance as cover, and ended up staying in there, killing and re-killing the spawns / Alliance as they kept trying to come for us.  We couldn't go up the hallway, couldn't go out into the rotunda, and had to wait for backup to arrive -- and *they* had to wait for a group to get through the Gorge.  :)  
---
If you were lucky, your MT would act like he's running in and time the arrival of the BRD outside boss, fear, have the priest / lock fear as well and scramble inside while the Alliance took damage from the mobs.  Good times, good times.
---
Everyone RUN OUT and FEAR THEM!  
---
My most hated experiences as a melee class are when I'm waltzing along and suddenly have 3 warlock dots on me and no idea where he even is.
---
*Only one guy runs out and instantly dies*
---
I thought so also, I was surprised to hear him say it.
---
Yeah, this was vanilla Blizz. I don't play pservers. I could see it being a huge issue on pservers though.
---
Not so fast there Cataclysm.
---
Only room for three on the hype train.
---
My friend's bwl geared warr with untamed blade right clicked a sitting t1 priest and the priest died just from the white damage. The most vanilla thing i ever seen.
---
Twinking is garbage.
---
people that "cant play" a private server are such babies
---
Classic will not be pserver emulator, it will be a vanilla recreation. 
---
Spicy
---
HYPE!! /train
---
Law Breaker? u mean Lawbringer?
---
&gt; useless backpack skin  
---
I like the Mk III golem backpack skin, though =(  
---
And the new map added the Elegy set which is pretty neat.  
---
The point here though is that GW2 doesn't deprive players of in game methods of getting skins and cosmetics, which someone above was trying to claim. Majority of players are greatly satisfied with how cosmetics are handled in GW2. Personally, I've never felt 'gravitated' towards paying cash for cosmetics, and 95% of the cosmetics I have were earned through in game methods, including paying gold for the Black Lion ticket skins off the Trading Post.  
---
I think between the 5 level 80s I have, only two of them use a skin item I bought with gems/cash - the chaos gloves on my Mesmer, and an outfit on my ranger (mainly because I haven't farmed up the medium armor skins I want for her)
---
Imp had voice lines for sure as well \^\^ I member that little sucker yelling Cant we all just get along while summoning him 
---
4k would be great. Not more please, it would hinder to build a good server community where you can establish your character.
---
on private servers where naxx is running 2 years and counting , lots of people have full naxx gear.     we don;t know, classic might also have a long period with naxx out.
---
you had 3 seconds between the 1st and the 3rd to find out!
---
TBC on seperate servers where I can transfer a clone of my classic char is a million times better than the shit you are suggesting
---
anywhere between a few seconds and 10 minutes.
---
source: a gurubashi pvp tournament.  some matches are blitzkrieg fats, but some  (healer class vs healer class) are battles of attrition and mana management.   I saw one where the judges had to call it a draw, because they could not kill each bother and the fight was holding up the tournament. 
---
Why are people so negative to the fact that some people dislike pvp? 
---
Once its been out a while I just want TBC. But assuming they eventually did TBC and then WOTLK and years and years passed, I wouldnt mind them making a vanilla+ server type that added content like this, or even raids that were planned for vanilla but never made. As long as it was a standalone server. I don't want a pure 1.13 server to ever go away, it should always ben there. 
---
Make a new server and let people start from 1 on that server if they want, then give it new content rollouts after 1.12. But that would be so many years from now... I dunno.
---
I'd say early on Allies have the advantage with BoS. 
---
On the horde side you'll have a bunch of Warlocks pulling aggro off the tanks in BWL/MC trying to top the dps charts out of habit. 
---
Yeah 
---
10k is very high, sounds more like pve crit with help from other debuffs / world buffs.   
---
 are you sure you got that in a pvp scenario? 
---
&gt; Reason #1,309 why I'll be playing on a PvE server.
---
I mean, on my PvE server it was pretty bad right there too. Everyone flagged to fight people there. Did your PvE server really have a peaceful BRM? Thats hard to believe.
---
On mine people fought there constantly, and once it started, the cowards standing by the instance portal would always get brave, flag and try to kill someone then zone in, but eat a stun/snare and get destroyed and this would repeat infinitely. The whole place was a clusterfuck of people in your UBRS run zoning in with the PvP flag disease that the healers and buffers complained about getting once they buffed you.
---
Yeah true dunno why I didn't do that =p
---
Thanks
---
There's another for Stormwind IIRC that has you collect a crate in north-eastern Swamp of Sorrows and turn it in at Nethergarde Keep in the Blasted Lands. Gave a whooping 25 rep I believe.

They could probably just add fresh servers down the road that can get separate updates. I don't think all content has to be rolled out evenly across servers. Runescape classic did a pretty decent job away adding content without gutting the game, but it's a lot easier to add side-grades to that compared to wow. 
---
Shamans seem to have it harder than others with mana totem shame but cool build
---
Reason #1 I'm playing a rogue. Gank and be ganked my friend!
---
I never want WotLK in Classic as that is where the game took a hard dive in my opinion. The opening raids were comically easy (and they removed Vanilla Naxx from the game), Ulduar was amazing except Flame Leviathan, Trial of the Crusader was terrible, Heroic Raid grinding was terrible, and LFD came out when Icecrown Citadel did (this is bad for the community).
---
I added the patch where it was implemented  
---
i guess, maybe ill just keep them in the boxes, or maybe frame the discs and keep the boxes xD
---
Every private server dies well before that point. 
---
Well, the game will basically get into state, where all vanilla content is consumed and people would drop their subs. If Blizzard doesn't consider classic as short time experiment they will have to make an upgrade to TBC in order to let the game survive. But the reasonable solution would be launch of fresh vanilla server at the time of TBC progression.
---
Im here to help ⎯⎯∈
---
As someone who’s thoroughly enjoyed every smash game, melee is sick and I see why people still play it 
---
I played vanilla on a PvE server, and all the private servers as PvP. Back then, BRM wasn't a spooky place beyond the dungeons and raids. There was of course the hit and runs, or at least the attempts :P
---
All the times I've played private servers, they've all been PvP servers. Every time I've been stuck behind the leveling curve due to work, so places I normally love like Hillsbrad or STV are completely intolerable due to the constant ganking from lvl 60s to where the hour a day I get to play is spent corpse walking. 
---
Because us PvP players need PvE players to gank, otherwise we would have to fight actually good people.
---
Classic should remain Vanilla forever.
---
It's highly likely Blizzard will release TBC (and WOTLK, and the rest even :) servers. If they are not completely brain dead, those will be separate servers, not forced upgrades.
---
If you still want something else, you could petition Blizzard, I guess.
---
Pobably from Nostalrius. Never seen anything like it in Vanilla, but would be likely to occur on a server with an extremely high population cap. Corpses were common in BRM, just not anywhere near that many.
---
Shit. Subjective i guess. I wouldn't mind an optional TBC transfer. 
---
I would also not mind attempts to make interessting additions to classic, of course they could also be on a choice separate server. 
---
I am not saying what I presented is what i want. Im just wondering in the case of interest dying off, could there be things happening in classic wow that would keep it alive. (instead of "killing" classic with TBC, which could happen). 
---
Active subs are active subs. Hopefully *if* classic gets a larger player base, they'll go back to the roots with the next expac. Since they're rebuilding talent trees I would love to see retail get rid of its trash talent system. 
---
Keep in mind that healers often use cloth even though they can wear plate in vanilla.
---
vanilla peaked around bwl/zg.  pretty much every pserver has shown this phenomenon and it'll be funny seeing people beg for fresh once the AQ40 slog starts 
---
Hopefully 2-3k like in Vanilla. The goal of Classic should not be greatly changing the design of the game.
---
that's why i said only if they cannot equip it  
---
ie mage rolling for plate  
---
in 2007 (middle of TBC)  they really were the best in the world, and there was some tough competition.   But I wasn't part of it so I can't  say much further.  But as I wrote briefly in another post, a few top players on my old server got recruited into Nihilum in late 2006 and from their stories I have a little bit of an idea how they were organized.   
---
Today's top guilds both on private and on retail seem to have leveled up a notch or two compared to those old days.  Like they require their members to not have 1 fully geared main, but up to 6, to be able to min max  class balance to extreme levels.   
---
But I am also pretty sure 22 year old young Kungen in his prime would be able to be part of that too 
---
Playing World of Warcraft without participating in the *war* is a crime. PVE realms should not exist at all in Classic WoW.
---
LOL
---
Nah, For the Horde!
---
Besides, rezzing in that area, fearing and running inside BRS is old-school cool.  
---
This makes a lot of sense. This is where their decision to table a lot of the stuff they had planned to TBC seemed like a good idea back then, but in hindsight it has a huge effect on Classic servers, something they obviously couldn't have calculated back then. This is why I think TBC was the most complete version of the game, because there were so many things they would otherwise have put into Vanilla but they used TBC for. While the other expansions for the most part they were thinking of stuff to add and hence it wasn't their original ideas for the game (aside from content like Grim Batol and Uldum, which isn't on the same level as something like finishing planned class changes)
---
I mean honestly I'd recommend 30/0/21. You will lose Healing way, Mana tide and Purification but you can live without them. Most shamans will be spamming Chain ways for the duration of BWL/MC anyway. 
---
Based on his own stories, he would have been allowed to participate as a member, but would never have been allowed to lead.
---
You still need to kill the mob without auto-attacking it. It’s just a pain in the ass to set up. 
---
I mean i don’t know. Im not saying they are using this system i asked if they are using it, considering some of the best pieces for war are leather would be rip if they couldn’t need on it because the system says they should wear plate. 
---
The more i think about it they should leave it vanilla and if any issues make a gm ticket or do a nost and have a tough shit policy 
---
Yep, the shaman choices kinda made sense at the time. Shaman were up for a massive overhaul due to them no longer being faction specific. So did it make sense to move them to a "fixed" version for only two quick patches and then overhaul them yet again for TBC, or did it make more sense just to ride out the remainder of vanilla since TBC was going to make it all better (and it did). This is the same issue that the thread on worries about Nax gear was dealing with, the impending launch of TBC allowed Vanilla to sweep many sins under the rug, with no TBC in sight what does that mean for Classic?
---
Easy if you are a mage, just blink :)
---
I miss the old loot distribution systems. It still shocks me they removed master loot. I long for the day we can reward good raiders in classic for doing their jobs right by giving them the loot.
---
&gt;I think thats an irrelevent comparison
---
Think so? I think youre wrong. Lets see whose right. Pservers are smashing content so fast that it could be tuned 20-40% easier than it actually was and they would still be smashing content at an unreal rate... And we know its far more accurate than that (approx 95%\~)
---
Personal loot != loot trading, but whatever gets some karma I guess....
---
Idk, BRM can be pretty fun as a priest
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2961p9-FTs
---
To counteract people ninja roll on loot they don't need they would lose real world reputation. If I had heard of you ninja looting before you were not allowed in our dungeon run, period. This was a time before lfr, a time before xrealm. What you did reflected on your character and people remember. There were guild black listings because of their members which actually forced guilds to purge toxic members. I don't know if classic will be as community driven as it once was but I certainly hope so.
---
So what should people like me, who generally cant pvp due to stress reasons, do? 
---
I was more refering to the "do u need" spam people get which will occur with other problems if loot trading is allowed.
---
They're *adding* loot trading? 
---
Loot trading existed in Vanilla. The Nostalrius devs straight up disabled the option to contact a GM to loot trade because the reports made up a full 1/4th of all GM tickets.
---
I doubt Blizzard has thought this far ahead.
---
But knowing Blizzard they will force everybody to upgrade to TBC no matter what as having three different versions running on live is something they will be against. 
---
Which happened in the old loot style as well.
---
In wotlk after loot trading was added wasn’t a single raid I did that I didn’t get messages offering to buy the loot I just won.
---
So instead of “hey sell me that.” It’s “hey do you need?”
---
No, that won't occur. To believe so one must be truly paranoid and think the Classic community will consist mainly of assholes. 
---
BTW wasn't loot trading already in the game in 2009? It was added in WOTLK afaik. 
---
Without rewards from the harder content (M+ dungeons and raids) you won’t get any progression and people won’t stick to it either.
---
With no carrot on the end of the stick people stop trying.  The gear is that carrot.
---
*cough* reckoning exploit
---
Why did you quit after doing one dungeon at 80?
---
framing video game discs/carts is peak manchild behaviour.  put them in a bookcase or something
---
I'm right there with you. After we got server first Illidan, after server first Vashj Kael and Archimonde, my competitive drive for the game started fading. Did a couple server firsts in Sunwell, but I was befriending people from another guild who was just getting into Hyjal, and that guild was #2-4 on the server. My guild was such a serious and focused guild that that's how far we were ahead. Soon enough I told the officers of that guild I was leaving for the other guild, I had gotten my satisfaction from reaching my #1 goal of TBC to beat Illidan, and just wanted a more laid back experience.
---
Eventually after getting screwed out of Gladiator (had the rank in reach with a few days left until my IRL friend got drunk and kicked me from the team, not realizing my record would go back down to 0-0 even if he invited me back), redoing raid content I got server firsts on, and IRL taking much of my attention... I quit, thinking this is the end of this beautiful game for me which I had played for 3+ years.
---
I had even done some naughty things like give my little cousin my password after I had stopped playing and he got me banned for buying gold where I had to get my account back from Blizzard. I even sold my account to a friend of a friend for a few hundred bucks, he was paying me in installments and eventually stopped paying me or answering my calls so I took my account back.
---
So many times where I thought the sun had truly set on me for this game, but I can't believe I'm here again, my account intact, doing shit like browsing this subreddit daily and calculating talents that I've seen hundreds of times for each class. This game is something else
---
Are there any warrior abilities, besides slam, that clip auto-attack?
---
You play on a RP server?
---
Hi, /u/jak_laka
---
I thought the vanilla numbers were fine. I would mine a small increase, but nothing dramatic I'm hoping.   
---
Remember, private servers are accessed by people in hugely different timezones. For brevity/argument's sake, you could imagine 50% of the playerbase are EU on one timezone and online when NA sleeps, and 50% are NA, online when EU sleeps. On classic, the servers will be region based so you won't have such a huge swing - so a smaller population will "feel" much larger than on private server.  
---
TL;DR 2k on classic = 2k from NA, all online at the same time, 2k on a private server = 1k on EU, 1k on NA, only 1k online at the same time.
---
The formula to calculate cumulative drop chances is as follows:
---
1 - (1 - dropChance)^numTries
---
With a 14% drop chance five tries you get:
---
1 - (1 - 0.14)^5 ~= 0.53 
---
Or around 53% in percentages. As with all probabilities this is only a chance of something happened. You may get multiple drops on consecutive runs, you may never see it drop.
---
It will take around 20 runs for really unlucky players to farm it to a 95% drop chance probability.
---
Shaman doesn't have a defensive magic purge iirc, they only have an offensive one so they don't hurt locks that bad
---
I think I remember an absolute statistic of every lvl 60 and only 0.1% of population full cleared naxx. 
---
I dont roleplay. I simply dont enjoy the pvp part of the game and much prefer pve. 
---
Is that the Xbox version of Shadowrun? Was it any good? I have it, but never managed to get around to playing even though I wanted to, and I'm in the process of selling my 360 + games right now.
---
Man up and accept that dying to unfair conditions is a part of the game. It's a World of Warcraft, not World of Peacecraft where everyone gets along. 
---
Man up and accept that dying to unfair conditions is a part of the game. It's called a World of Warcraft, not World of Peacecraft where everyone gets along. 
---
Really, the only thing that needs to be said for the staunch private server defenders.   From my experience, there isn't enough evidence, or even something from Blizzard themselves, to give any of you a second thought.  Not even for a second.
---
If you're any different, then by all means we can continue.
---
no, the server dies AFTER raiders achieve all their goals and for many of us that includes getting all the gear.  That's like the finish line. 
---
You are right, the server population collapses, but that doesn't mean tons of people didn't get  their full gear set. 
---
And some of them stay a little longer, because well with that gear you might as well PVP a bit.   To see how a premade vs premade in the highest level of gear goes. 
---
The only one that will keep people on classic is offering TBC. They start adding shit to classic that wasn’t in vanilla and a good amount of the classic player base will leave.
---
Offering a move to TBC won’t kill classic it will give people who want classic the option to stay and those who want TBC the option to move on.
---
If we are at the end of the line. Everythings been done. Those without the guild to do so has bought boosts through naxx. Everything is cleaned out. People have alts, twinks ++. 
---
Any content, regardless of character progression, i think will be played. Especially progressivly tougher content, that requires skill, teamwork and resilience. 
---
Glad I wasnt the only one to start singing it in my head
---
When the game really died for me is when it was no longer necessary to actually travel anywhere. In Azeroth it really *is* all about the journey rather than the destination. No journey, no fun.
---
Very well said and I think this is why 1-2 years into Classic the Classic+ train will grow louder.
---
In an ideal world, a WoW2 holding very true to the values of Classic would be a fantastic solution. However, it's looking less and less like Blizzard is the right company to do that. But they own the IP. And we've seen how far similar projects run by former WoW devs have gone. And even if it's made, will it have the traction that would bring the population that a Blizzard-policed product would?
---
For Classic I just want Blizzard to give us a museum for this remarkable game that will stand forever as a piece of history; no WoW tokens or transmogs or anything like that, just leave it alone and have it there for whoever wants to go back to it. TBC servers are probably a good addition, too. But I really hope a Classic+ or WoW2 can come out in addition to the untouched museum piece(s).
---
Pretty crazy. But then and again the release date of Naxx before TBC was around 6 1/2 months if I rem it right. 
---
In TBC- Sunwell clear rate was even worse. 
---
You don't have to role play. Just PVE on the RP server lol. 
---
LOL Cataclysm.
---
As a mage, I learned that to make gold all I had to do was to sit by the IF bridge and sell water &amp; bread 👀

Av was pretty fun as a hunter with chromaggus crossbow. If there's a chokepoint being contested - which was all the time back then - you have 41 yd range versus everyone else's 36. Multishot is a killer with that crossbow.  
---
I have a acreenshot somewhere of an Av scoreboard where I had around 700 killing blows. 
---
Like fish in a barrel. 
---
Even as a gnome lover I have to object to this terrible idea!
---
Gnome mounts are polluting the air!  they should be banned and even gnomes should get a nice pony or just employ a warlock to summon them where they need to go. 
---
This isnt about "manning up", its about me playing the game the way I want.
---
Or are you just so insecure about the fact that people have different opinions than you that you have to tell others to "man up"? 
---
And my experience of what a "normal" player was different than yours.  So i guess what I'm saying, it's all relative. 
---
I'll give you an example.  24 hr AVs were avoided like the plague.  Barrens chat wasn't cool.  Nor were Chuck Norris jokes.
---
But now, people can't wait to get back to them - the core generation for Classic.
---
I'm not commenting on yourself as a player or myself.  Just that a lot people saying that things were a certain way 14 years ago have a very skewed view of what it was like.
---
Fact is, that people who were actually the core audience in all likelihood don't play anymore nor care enough to post on these forums like me.  Haha.
---
To those aping about the CD Keys, it's a retail WoW account at this point aka BFA...who cares lmao.
---
Loot trading for raids and dungeons did not come in till wrath. It alters the dynamics of loot distribution in groups.
---
Yes that staff has an iconic look, just like on the priest icon and Benediction

All those corpses made me remind me of this picture

Just like a real life cat, druids strengths come from being annoying as fuck, show up out of the shadows and meow in their face to assert dominance. Vomiting on their shoes if they turn away is also a valid strat. Knocking things off of high places is high risk and reward but very effective.

Over 8 million online!

Undead mage with the chapeau, name a more familiar sight while leveling. Orc warrior with Herod's shoulder and Whirlwind Axe?
---
My very FIRST MMO was Asheron's Call, which I was seriously addicted to.  Like, get home, go online until 2am addiction; it was bad, but I loved it.  Eventually I switched to WoW when it launched and while I was (thankfully) never that level of addiction, I greatly enjoyed it and played all the way to WoTLK.  
---
Fast forward about 10 years and I decided to hop back on AC to see what it was like - the game had not aged well, and like current WoW, had been updated and patched to remove all the elements of the challenge and make it more accessible in order to bring in more players.  Unfortunately, it didn't work and the game shuttered a few years ago (though lives on in private servers of varying patches).  
---
When WoW classic was announced I was surprised, but I didn't really give it much thought.  Joked with my girlfriend about it and wen on with my life.  
---
But then it started to creep back into my thoughts and when I finally played the Blizzcon demo, I was amazed that while I found I no longer liked AC when I played it, WoW classic hit the same notes for me again.  So now I'm looking forward to it, and while it does occupy my daily thoughts a bit on and off, luckily I have other distractions for now.

I'm telling you that your "opinion" is stupid. Why play an MMORPG if you want to interact with other players outside of your "safe place"? It's fucking pointless and you are a little bitch who has to hide on a PvE realm. You do not belong in WoW and I hope Blizzard cuts off PvE realms for good so that you are forced to either git gud or leave the game.
---
What?
---
Back in Vanilla if you requested to trade an item via a GM ticket, they would do so.
---
Loot trading 100% existed in Vanilla.
---
The thing is you just know people will still go to STV on launch day and acted surprise when they get ganked. 
---
As a Paladin, I learned not to roll a paladin.
---
After needing an item you don't really need in reality, you can 
---
1) sell it to someone in the group for many golds, or 
---
2) you can give it to a guildmate / altmate who needs it. 
---
Those will be an even **better reason to not PuG and play with your friend**, which is toxic for a game like wow.
---
With this loot trading system, there will be many people who didn't ninja in Vanilla (because it wasn't worth it) that will ninja from time to time now (because it's really worth it).
---
The best solution is to NOT implement loot trading at all, and tell the players that GM tickets for missloot won't be considered ever. Problems solved.
---
I used to be that guy. The tough rank 13 vanilla player that had crushed AQ back in retail. I would scoff at private servers... Especially as they were mostly pay to win and had poor scripting! Then I actually played one. I was really surprised to find out that it was, pretty well accurate... We can sit here and talk about how they had quest XP wrong for a few years or how a certain bosses phase was 5 seconds off... But the reality is that these were pretty insignificant nuances considering the wide body of work that vanilla is... Now it would be a VERY different story if people were barely killing shit and struggling at 2-3% of a bosses hp with only 5-10 raiders alive, but that isnt the case. They are rolling through content like it isnt anything. Just as they will in Classic. The meta will apply to classic (for the most part) and you will be influenced by that meta. Scream and kick and cry, you will be influenced by the meta and for certain guilds/groups you will be expected to conform.
---
Or... They could keep things as they were and keep the pve servers for those that prefer it? 
---
Sunwell was 2%, Naxx were 76 guilds in total IIRC.
---
If you have bwl gear or above you will absolutely demolish most people.
---
This - what Blizzard is doing is effectively removing the need for GMs to actually be the one to do the trading.  All they're doing is automating a process that already existed in the game.
---
Yeah like zipzoom said, Blizzard has already said during the Blizzcon q&amp;a and obviously the WoW panel that for classic WoW.. authentic vanilla experience is very important to them and the community. Which I'm sure you have heard several times.
---
But this particular interview where the youtuber actually asks about cash shop. [https://youtu.be/RAKvIx6eQpA?t=1204](https://youtu.be/RAKvIx6eQpA?t=1204)
---
All they say about cash shop is "we want an authentic vanilla experience" and they then go on to talk about stuff that is still up to debate such as realm transfers, etc etc. This for me at least is an pretty obvious indication that a cash shop with tokens won't exist in classic.
---
I would not count that as loot trading. GMs were only ever meant to move items if it was a mistake that it was given to the wrong player, even then they may refuse to move the item.
---
What if I told you that every time you're summoned, somebody is brutally murdered? Do you value the environment over the lives of living, breathing playable characters?
---
Shaman can purge errrrthang.
---
I interact with players in other ways than killing them. I have conversations, we run dungeons and raid, we hang out.
---
Why is it such a sore spot for you that people can enjoy the game in a different way than you do? 
---
IDK man. Talk to Jay Wilson about it. 
---
Because population wasn't always static, was in part due to limitations of the server rather than the game and in the name of maintaining a long term population servers should start with large caps that can be trimmed later. 
---
I am really looking for the PvE server version of this guild.  
---
Yep, that’s what Blizzard needs to do. No acting like cucks. 
---
This - a lot of people forget that there needed to be more protections in place after x realms.  You could be a jerk and never run out of people to con.  Classic servers will self-correct; if you're a jerk on a classic server, your name will get out there and eventually you won't have anyone grouping with you.  You'd be amazed at how well this dissuades people.
---
In vanilla it started from in searing gorge just outside those metal doors and the pile of bones spread all the way to MC entrance (Pre-BWL).
---
I guess I should've rephrased it better. Pre nerfed Sunwell had a lower clear rate. Sunwell was a much, much harder to clear than Naxx.
---
&gt; GMs were only ever meant to move items if it was a mistake that it was given to the wrong player
---
It was still used for loot trading back in Vanilla. On Nostalrius, the same service accounted for 1/4th of all GM tickets.
---
&gt; I would not count that as loot trading.
---
That's cool if you don't, but it's still loot trading and the automated system they're implementing is a carbon-copy of what they already had, except without the GM.
---
&gt;But knowing Blizzard they will force everybody to upgrade to TBC no matter what
---
No chance that they do this, it defeats the entire point of having Classic servers.
---

If you're not out there in the world, fighting against the other faction whenever you see them you're not playing the game correctly. Now stop responding to me you coward before I mount your head on a pike.
---
Here come the edgelords
---
How does Slam stack up for an Alliance option?
---
Yeahhh, definitely not a myth, check out some modern Vanilla content. However, if you’re Horde, and have a BrE, then 2H Fury is good through BWL and until AQ. 
---
Stormreaver on a busy day had slightly less than that density-wise but it started outside in Searing Gorge and went all the way to MC.  It was multi-raid vs multi-raid pvp and made Southshore v Tarren Mill look like a skirmish.
---
Oops, no im not. BC made a shitload of terrible changes and then WOTLK was the final nail in the coffin for me.
---
BC introduced flying which KILLED world pvp, then they introduced resilience which destroyed group pvp... Then they opted for token badge gear (introduced in vanilla, I know) which really started to water down the itemization and finally they added heroic dungeons and badge gear which was the start of welfare gear.
---
WOTLK comes out and applies "heroic" content to all raids and then also parses raids into different raid sizes. This is when players begin to do the same content OVER and OVER and OVER only to get different variations of the same loot. Raids and PVE content are no longer exclusive content for the upper tier players and left as goals for those who arent quite ready... PVE content is now for EVERYONE! Not much has changed in world pvp say for the fact that sharding is introduced to certain quest areas. The world changes for players as they complete quests which also separates them from the players they are with. WOTLK finally kills PVE and the game is left as a hollow shell of itself.
---
The raids themselves and zones were beautiful in WOTLK, possibly the best xpac, however the core game philosophies changed more in WOTLK than almost any other expansion.
---
One benefit to current architecture over the classic stuff is that if they want a new server now, they can launch it pretty much remotely from anywhere.  Old tech they had to physically BUILD the servers.  
---
So I expect they'll play it safe and launch with a conservative number and then if they need more, they can start rolling them out until wait times stabilize.
---
Didn't realize you were in favor of changes.
---
Personally I'm going to stick with being able to loot trade, just how it was in Vanilla.
---
Looking for a group on NA, either Rp or PvE.  Will be rolling horde and active in PST hours (specifics not yet set in stone).  Aiming to raid and socialize, and have narrowed it down to playing either a druid or warrior depending on future information.  Best form of contact would be here on Reddit for now.
---
If you actually read the lore, there was peace between the Alliance and the Horde during Classic. Some border skirmishes exist (bgs) but there is no actual war on.
---
So no, mindless killing isnt the top priority in the game.
---
Really mature of you to write a threat like that btw. 
---
yea no bud im not reading all that shit lol gl
---
Thats why loot trading should be removed and GMs should lose the ability to move items. That way people can't exploit the system.
---
Why do you want easy and reliable loot trading to be added to classic when it did not exist in this format in classic?
---
&gt;Well i would want alliance for easy raids and HoF
---
.... The content is REALLY old... You wont find a significant difference in difficulty on Horde or Alliance. The game is pretty trivial, except for Naxx. Naxx appears to be tuned properly.
---
From a practical aspect too you have to consider what weapon is going to be available to you with rogues and other fury warriors (and in some cases the tanks) going after the best 1h. Pre-BiS if you can't get Dal Rend's or Ironfoe or whatnot, is Arcanite Reaper or The Unstoppable Force going to be better than your alternative 1h pair? If BRE, OEB, Ashkandi, or Zinrokh drops, are you going to pass on it to dw even if your 1h pair is not as powerful as those? Most of the time in practice you work with the way the dice rolls because it's not as simple as planning out your character and then having them built exactly to that specification
---
Two Warrior, one MT one OT w/ imp. Battle Shout. One Hunter and a Shaman/Paladin for WF Totem or Aura. The last spot is flexible, we use a Feral Druid for the extra 3% crit. Idea is to boost the MT threat as much as possible.
---
Depends what your goal is. Maximize threat, or maximize odds of survival? In today's vanilla WoW, maximizing threat is much more common.
---
**Max threat group comp:**  
---
TSA Hunter  
---
Feral Druid  
---
Shaman (could be a paladin if Ally for ret aura)  
---
Tank 1  
---
Tank 2 or really anything else  
---
**Max survival group:**  
---
Warlock   
---
Shaman (would be a paladin if Ally)  
---
Tank 2  
---
Tank 3 or whatever else

Abusing GM tickets and spineless developers = loot trading, btw. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 
---
This sub has so many retail casuals. 😓
---
Cataclysm was enough to make me quit. I can't believe people made it into MoP or Legion or any of that other shit.
---
&gt; Why do you want easy and reliable loot trading to be added to classic when it did not exist in this format in classic?
---
I'm still waiting for an answer to my question:
---
Can you show me proof of what criteria had to be met for a GM to refuse to trade an item?
---
Because the fact is that you're asking for changes. Loot trading 100% existed in Vanilla. GMs could not read minds and if the ticket said it was looted by mistake then that's what they had to go off of. 
---
Just because you never used the system back in the day doesn't mean it wasn't easy and reliable.
---
you do you
---
I'm still not sure. Something about Wrath just didn't click with me. I just fell out of love with the game. I had also recently quit my guild because most of the core was moving on themselves. So I had zero pressure to gear up. I had plans to start doing more content the next day, but just couldn't find the motivation.

---
&gt; Abusing GM tickets
---
Oh hey, glad you're going to be enjoying Vanilla for the first time when it comes out! 
---
For those who *actually* played in Vanilla, submitting GM tickets to trade loot was a real thing. Can't wait for you to experience what Vanilla was really like!
---
Yeah some people are going to love it, which is who should join the guild.. and some people are going to hate it, in which case you shouldn't even have applied to the guild and we stop wasting everyone's time (personally I didn't like it)
---
The old school runescape model of changes where the player base has to vote yes with like 75%+ or something like that might be wise.  Give something a long time to be voted on, allow thorough input, and see if the player base votes overwhelmingly to approve.  None of the 50.5% majority approval crap like in politics- that is a guaranteed way to piss people off.  If you set the approval bar high enough it will ensure that only widespread approved changes would make it through. 
---
This was was removed because it seems to be about entirely post-Vanilla/Classic-era content (WotLK and BFA).
---
You can throw that one away 
---
Incorrect. Dual-wield is miles ahead of BRE. Most bosses are already at 0 armor with normal class armor debuffs + Annihilator, so BRE's proc has extremely limited value (only on a select few bosses that have more armor)

You know that crumbled statue/fountain in the courtyard (Ruins of Lordaeron) before you enter Undercity? You can run right through the center of it, no need to do fancy jumping or running around it.
---
Oh, so you agree that GM ticket abuse was a thing. Thanks? 
---
yea, I want clean mountain air to breath in for myself,   those breathing characters can sod off!
---
But we can make a law that gnome summoning is only allowed in emergencies, and they can the pony, the other option I provided. 
---
Yes I leveled a paladin tank on a private server into mid 30s.  Tanking itself wasn't a problem, but a core ability that you can't put on your hotbar is leadership in the PUG, communicating how to do pulls properly.  
---
I had a macro.  Melee focus my target.  If you pull aggro then use an aggro-reducing ability (most classes have one!) and if needed I will BoP.  Casters do the same, unless if you have AOE wait until my consecrate is about half done then AOE all you want and we're good.  A few runs were extremely effective, one was iffy but then people adjusted and went well.  Just have to make it very clear that it is different than warrior tanking, and you need to mark your targets well and communicate. 
---
I'd much rather them add things to classic with the same design choices of classic than just relaunch all the expansions.  However, that's unlikely and I'm fine with just getting TBC and WotLK again.  I just think it would be much, much cooler if they reimagined the world and made design choices based in Vanilla.  
---
There's a ton of things in Vanilla that never got added or got added later and changed.  All that I can think of right now is:
---
- Hyjal
---
- The Deathwing instance in Hyjal
---
- Uldum/The gates with a hole at the southern border of Tanaris
---
- Grim Batol
---
- Gilneas
---
- Quel'Thalas
---
Like I said, it was all eventually added later or fleshed out, but I think the original designers had other intent for it.  I mean, Gilneas is still not accessible.  I also think it would have been cool for a higher level area with a raid.  They only joined with the NE because of a retcon.  It would have been awesome for them to open up the gates and start attacking people outside of the wall.
---
Uldum was also a huge retcon.  The sundering "broke a generator" and all of a sudden we realized that it was actually a huge desert zone with Indiana Jones references rather than a place like Ulduman or Ulduar.
---
Maybe on a "per server" basis, this (almost) never happened on my high pop server (i mean there was PVP in BRM ofcourse, but not like these amounts of skellies), therefore i would actually doubt this would ever happen on med / low pop servers. For none of the servers i played on during actual Vanilla this is represenative, for overpopulated pservers, sure, this will happen.  
---
Yep! Which is why the same system is being implemented but without the GM involved, because otherwise you'd be asking for *changes*.
---
I know you want to fix things that were broken (I bet you also want to “balance” the specs, too, retail-boy) but those of us want as close to an original experience as possible.
---
Weird flex but ok
---
Yes I would agree too.  If you are spamming chain heal, having purification is a huge boost.  PVP is still viable as the spec I put out above, you're just healing more as opposed to primarily casting.  It comes down to playstyle I would say.  If you think healing is fun in BGs (bless your heart if you do, never enough healers in BG!) then throw a few more points in resto.

I never tried stealthing strat live, but I believe once you get to the keep area there are some doors that won't open until you clear trash. Correct me if I'm wrong on that, but if that's the case 2 manning will be very difficult. Also, I know the eyes can see through stealth and I think some other NPCs can as well. The archivist is a two phase fight with a sleep mechanic that would also prove challenging for any two man and by the time the gear is available that would even make that possible I think the market will have cooled off. Farming strat live is great but I think it would be better to do it as a 5 man and greed the orbs and shards. 
---
Please do accept that there are ppl that cannot handle PVP due to medical reasons, but can PVE fine. 
---
          I used to play a Druid in vanilla and didn’t even use a mouse. I had all my attack binds on the numpad and heals/forms around the movement keys. Had to move hand from numpad to the mouse each time I wanted to loot something. I thought I was brilliant for setting it up that way back then. 
---
Looking back I was a damn fool. 
---
Yep. Trinket + Curse of Elements.

LF1M UBRS NEED KEY ROGUES FULL
---
Who knows what Blizzard will add in or remove based on their modified patch progression.  They might add in fishing pools at the first tier which would make getting gold at a lower level much easier.  I'm leaning towards them including everything except the things directly associated with the raids they are releasing.  I.e. they aren't going to hold battlegrounds out because they didn't get released until patch 1.5.
---
Scenario:  group of people who know and trust eachother.  
---
mage -  tailor enchanter  
---
warrior - tank  
---
priest - heals  
---
rogue - being sneaky
---
huntard -  watching xvideos while autoshotting.
---
They don't really need the gear, they are just there in Stratholme for the Righteous Orbs  and.......  
---
Large Brilliant Shards!
---
So the mage should be able NEED most items as he is the one with enchanting in this group. 
---
Any loot system that doesn't allow this  sucks. 
---
I was also hoping there would be an add on that could auto-mark dungeon groups, skull for the mob with silence/heal/cleave/whatever ness to be killed first, x for the second target to be killed, moon for sheep, blue square for ice trap, etc. Since most dungeon mob groups are known quantities, this could save some time having to manually mark them, as well as help with targeting the right mobs in the right order.
---
&gt; Can you show me proof of what criteria had to be met for a GM to refuse to trade an item?
---
I don't think they had fixed criteria, however our Lootmaster back in the day did get comments from Blizzard GM's that he needed to stop making mistakes as they would otherwise have to start declining his tickets. 
---
I love BRM. Whenever I was bored I went to BRM to fight people since it was a guarantee someone else was there looking to tank or simply run an instance. Nostalgia at its best that place is.
---
Please go fuck yourself because I do not care about people's "medical" conditions. Their numbers are tiny compared to  healthy people like me so why would I give a single fuck about them?
---
I've played on Emerald Dream for a while, and although I don't partake in the RP most of the time, its really cool seeing it all happen around me. I'm definitely gonna look for an RP-PVP server for classic.
---
Yep, that's how consistently the system worked. It's amazing how shocked retail players are in this thread when I tell them how easy and reliable loot trading was back in Vanilla.
---
depending on how they are implemented, no way. If they are implemented without changing droprates (for example mobs spawn 4x faster due to server being busy, then their drops also need to be cut in 4) you get a unbalanced economy, especially when players can trigger the dynamic spawns to be faster and faster by killing mobs faster and faster. 
---
I named my UD rogue “ineptitude” because I thought it meant insane/crazy.
---
I also bought gold in my 40’s and ‘twinked’ (I’m pretty sure my twink gear was terrible) for a few months.
---
Never got my epic mount even though I played from pre-bwl to tbc.
---
I keyboard turned but I dont think I was ever a clicker.
---
Fortunately for me I joined an mc pug late in the game and got almost an entire nightslayer set because the other rogues simply didnt need the gear. Made my night and I was the shit among my friends for awhile. Would sit around the computer letting eachother run WSGs on my rogue with that +10 energy set bonus.
---
You realize naxx won't be available when classic starts right? It will be at least a year after launch at which point casuals will be farming bwl and progressing in AQ. It's not going to be Naxx players vs 0.5 dungeon gear players in the first few months...
---
You need cool looking gear and mounts to exist in the world or else there's nothing extra to work towards on downtime.  I hate cash shops and won't play if they exist.
---
People say sub model is dead because no one wants to pay a sub anymore.  It's the most optimal for setting up your game though.  However, like others said, WoW is a box price + sub + cash shop just because they can squeeze more money out.
---
i dont use this word often but i always just felt it was pretentious 
---
I only have two out of the many I took. Same thing happened when I played Everquest. Hopefully there is a CD-R somewhere with all of my missing screen shots.
---
13 seconds to kill a mob 2 levels lower than you isn't exactly abnormal.
---
nope because wrath was the start of the downfall of WoW, and Cata is a joke
---
Play ESO instead.  I had a lot more fun and you probably already know some of the lore if you played Oblivion or Skyrim.
---
Sit-critting to get Reckoning stacks was not an exploit. Worked the same way with Warriors and their Enrage talent.
---
[one happy boi](http://imgur.com/c8OYTYd) 
---
Only the true elite WoW players are blessed with the patience to roll a Paladin. And you get rewarded by being able to bubblehearth your way out of anything. (except those spinning axe throwers in ZG)
---
ESO is HEAVILY monetized.  They have the base game, now two "expansions", and the content that would normally be patches in WoW is addons that cost money usually like $10 - $15 each.  If you get the subscription for $15 a month you get almost all those "patches", a upgraded unlimited material bag for crafting which is a huge incentive and unavailable without paying the sub, and $15 a month in their premium currency.  It surely pays for itself, but only if you are actively playing the game.  Then, you still need to buy the expansions.  It's kinda similar to WoW in that regard.
---
Did you ever try to do any escort quest on nostalrius?
---
&gt;What do you guys think? Could it be viable?
---
The farming part might be viable, but the selling part won't
---
You make one basic error in thinking:
---
the high price you mentioned is because nobody does this.   As soon as people would churn out several Tome of Conjure Food VII a night, the market price would plummet to 100g or less, because there won't be THAT many mages that all need it right now.   (most mages just patiently run the dungeon themselves until it drops for them anyway. 
---
The high price is just because not many people ever sell it.  (they are mage themselves or for their alt)  but get the market flooded and the demand drops toi almost 0.
---
Repeatable Gold  farming only works for  consumables that people need all the time, that get used up!  A Tome is a once in a lifetime item, that every mage only needs once.   
---
Yeah, I played Pally at launch until level... I want to say 30?  Then I rolled  mage.  
---
Then when TBC came out, I rolled a new one and had FAR more fun.  
---
So I guess I'll adjust my advice:  
---
As a Paladin, I learned not to roll a Paladin.  
---
UNLESS Classic TBC becomes a thing, at which point, roll a Paladin and power through to the promised land of tanking Raids and doing deeps.
---
Why would people spam that in the old loot system?
---
If i rolled "need" then yeah, I obviously need it.
---
You probably took 20 days to get to 60 and couldn’t get into a guild on a private server. 😂😂😂 Stay cucked, kid. 
---
&gt; a unique trick I found while leveling my hunter was to use bandages to heal my pet 
---
This is a trick? Alright... Uhhhh... I found out that the 'W' key moves me forward, that was a huge trick. I found out that you have a key ring, which is actually located to the left of your bags IF you are using a default HUD. Gosh what else... Ummm... If you hit 'ENTER' you can type ingame to other players! SOOOO many more but I just dont have the time to type them up.
---
It's true that naxx was only around for 6 months but we can't say definitively that either or was harder. Due to factors of skill which is hard to put into quantitative values.
---
Here is some stats to take into consideration: 
---
World first clear of naxx took 79 days (release June 20th and cleared September 7th)
---
Sunwell world first clear took 61 days (release March 25th and cleared may 25th). 
---
0.1% of population of lvl 60s cleared naxx and it was live for 210 days. 
---
2% of the population of lvl 70s cleared sunwell and it was live for 232 days. Raids were nerfed by 30% Health in the last 30 days of TBC.
---
Great you just said what I did. Glad we're in agreement. 
---
that's because there are often 6-8 mages in a 40 man raid, compared to most classes having only 2-4 or 5 members.   So many more mages get upgrades that need a new ZG enchant. (same for warriors, they also have 6-8)  
---
Therefore shaman, druid and paladin voodoo dolls are worth nothing, and warrior and mages are premium 
---
$15 is incredibly cheap for entertainment.  No where can you spend $15 and get dozens of hours of entertainment.  A movie costs $10+ and that's about ~2h.  Two beers cost $10 - $14.  A McDonald's meal costs like $8 now.  
---
A WoW sub is definitely worth it.  People straight up not being able to afford it is another problem in entirety.  If you can't afford it you can't expect just to get it for free.  If they changed to a pay by hours system I guarantee it would cost more than $1 per hour.
---
As horde you might consider a shaman for totems - they only apply group wide.
---
Other than that I think you just end up with the odds and ends that don't quite fit in to the other groups. Usually healers that don't fit in a dedicated mana regen group, or extra dps.
---
Paladins can tank dungeons but they really struggle in raids. They run out of mana too easily.
---
Why go for two features that aren't vanilla like?
---
Especially now with everyone and their dog with recording software, won't be hard to provide proof of a persons actions to their Guild Master or even the community.  Doing bad things is going to have a pretty big impact, IMO even bigger than back in 2004.....and I'm so looking forward to this.
---
You don't lose money every hour you don't play though.  You lose $15 a month regardless of how much you play.  It takes a lot of pressure off of people knowing that no matter what they do it'll cost $15.  
---
If they charged you per unit of time there is a ton more stress.  "OMG that wipe just cost me a quarter of an hour."  "Omg I'm getting ganked repeatedly and I wasted a half hour of payment for that."  "Hey dude, come help me with this quest....  No fuck off, I'm not paying this sub to help you out."
---
Pay per hour is idiotic.  Charge an amount and let the players decide how they want to spend their time.  You don't sub to netflix or spotify and think, "I'm losing money," when you're not watching or listening.
---
I meant one shotting with an ability. It wasn't considered an exploit unless you count one shotting a 40 man world boss but it got nerfed since then.
---
&gt; You probably won't see paladins in raids. 
---
What? This is just 100% false.
---
True but old blizz vanilla servers had it at 5k on some servers. I think 6k would  be great on all servers with no changes this time around.
---
On any camps of mobs that BAF, on my mage (prior to getting my mount and ice barrier) I use rank 1 sheep on a single mob, then run around to the other side of the camp of mobs and wait. When the sheep breaks the mob runs at me, across the big camp of mobs causing them all to join him. By the time he gets to me he has all his friends in a big bunch and I can frost nova them conveniently and back up and blizzard them to death.
---
Its the only way I can pull 8+ mobs without a mount and not die. lol
---
Yeah, I misread. I thought they were talking about paladin tanks since they're on about a tank group.
---
I guess you might see one in their group with devotion aura.
---
See the thing is you don't want to play that much though.  You want to come in and "check out" the new content.  That's not how MMOs are supposed to work.  WoW is the game you're supposed to play all the time and you can leave it for short bursts to play other games.  But when all is said and done you should want to come back home to WoW.  The current expansion doesn't have that affect on people so it drives people like you away.  The game just isn't as good.
---
They have their uses. They are the best class to play for watching pornography
---
They NEED to let you need on things that are not of your specific spec, for example - Holy paladin needs a lot of cloth gear.... if they can't get that it is going to be pretty rough.
---
Doesn't quite work unfortunately, you'd most likely struggle with rage gen to keep using BT/WW/Slam on CD without windfury totem.
---
Additionally, what makes it work for horde is that a 10 rage investment through hamstring could yield both a potential 1500+ crit  (WF) or give you 30% haste for three swings with Flurry, shaving seconds off a slow 2-hander.
---
Though slam hits harder than hamstring having no WF and the possibility of being interupted/outranged and reseting swing timer for nothing just makes it rough, You could give it a go with a proper swing timer addon that accounts for Flurry Juju and enchants, but even played flawlessly you might still be in the bottom half of the DPS warriors in the raid.
---
It might sound like I have a certain bias towards WF and neglecting blessings, but it really is that good, just need tanks with fantastic threat output.
---
I'll sip classic like 15 years old Macallan. Slowly, conciously, fully aware of each flavour. Being older, taking time with the game that is meant to be taken step by step with randomly made community encouters, what else to wish for? Can't fooking wait..
---
My one regret is I cannot upvote more than once.
---
Most World PvP advocates tend to remind me of someone I had a conversation with in ArcheAge. He'd spent hundreds, if not thousands, on reforging his equipment until he rolled near enough the very best gear available at the time, no one had gear like him. Most people used what I used, gear that you got from running a dungeon and a few pieces of entry level crafted gear (Stuff that you could get without spending real money, or much real money). 
---
I asked him if he still enjoyed the game, as it centered almost entirely around World PvP at the time, there was no other real content to get engaged in, and he was by far the best geared character on the faction. He said he only got the gear so he could fight and contend with the best PvPers, oblivious to the fact that near to no one had gear like him, and that the best PvPers, the ones he could now contend with, had far worse gear than him. 
---
Most World PvPers don't like a fair fight, and I say this as someone who loves World PvP. Most World PvPers love a fight where they're 3 people against 2, where they have a healer and their opponents don't, or where their opponents are just two or three levels lower. Where the gap between them seems close, but actually it's just enough to tip the balance quite considerably. Sure, a good PvPer can overcome those odds, but that's not most the people you gank in the open world. 
---
I think this is why a lot of players don't enjoy Arenas as much as Battlegrounds, myself among them. In a Battleground you can come up on a fight where your opponent is already injured from a fight they just won, and finish it easily. In Arena both teams go in on even footing.

Yeah, good point here. Any cash shop isn't going to keep players dedicated to the game. That can only be done by a releasing progressive raids, and after that is exhausted, more content, such as TBC servers, and then WoTLK servers. I don't know what their plan is going to be, but just playing vanilla forever will definitely be a turn-off, so I'm extremely curious about their plans after it's out for a couple years.
---
Like KnaxxLive said, I too would be interested to see how they expand on a vanilla world after we've exhausted all the previous content.
---
so you're okay with cross realm battlegrounds i take it  
---
Man this makes me glad I played a PVE server. I know this makes me a buzzkill, but I don't have the patience to put up with a mass gank-fest when I just want to get in raid and start clearing.
---
Your interpretation is correct. I thought MTs may benefit from paladin auras. 
---
I got oneshoted by an Arms Warr with sword spec proc far too many times as a priest. That was the most annoying shit in the game for me when he had a healer behind his ass. You could do nothing. PoM pyro mage was a 3min cd oneshot. Ambush rogues against cloth targets had a chance to kill them in the opener. Enha shamans could proc windfury and kill you in a sec. Reckoning paladin was a thing as well till they nerfed it. Ele shaman had crazy burst window and he could 100-0 his target in one rotation if he got some crits. 
---
PvP was quick and unbalanced. The lack of Resilience was huge but I find these sustain damage classes even worse. Affli or Destro Warlock, Frost mage or elemental mage, Shadow priest and so on were the hardest to deal with. They just wrecked havoc on the battleground.
---
Well, as a a warrior there is no need for porn. I can see my char getting fucked by two mobs everyday.
---
 "The capacity to accept or tolerate delay, problems, or **suffering** without becoming annoyed or anxious."
---
That sums up paladin gameplay- It just never becomes good unlike a warrior who sucks it up to become a wrecking ball.
---
Gnomes don't need mounts.
---
They move more than fast enough by their natural mode of locomotion, which is to be fired from a cannon.
---
You have a point. But even with it being AQ, the best staff from there gives 84 spell damage. Naxx staff gives 123, seems like a bit much.
---
It was actually pretty fun.  Well probaly more fun for me since my group tended to win 2 times out of 3 with these encounters.

[Dynasty Eternal] US-PVP

Hello all, I'm looking to start an Alliance based guild on a PvP server. I have previously lead large guilds, mostly Cata timeframe forward and have more experience with leading in officer roles as well. I've been lying since vanilla, though I wasn't extremely involved back then. We will need officers and hopefully some experienced with vanilla raid content! I am a huge lover of PVP and plan on organizing world PvP as well as premade Battlegrounds. Anyone is welcome to join, we look for active participants and people who are willing to help each other out. Feel free to shoot me a pm on here for more info or if you're interested in joining! Message about anything, preferred class/race, experience, what you're excited about, etc! 
---
Pretty much - Mages fucking LOVE Pally tanks - one consecration with ret aura and they can go AoE hog wild.  
---
That was an attack voice line and definitely remember that shrill voice only after the BC patch.
---
Or you can just drop a mana spring totem and lie, which I’ve definitely seen before.
---
This was common on my small Vanillia server.  9 times out 10 we prefered PvP over PvE so anytime we ran into each other we always duked it out.
---
I was going to walk away from this, but I feel like it needs to be said.  You're acting like a real asshole in this post.  The guy is hyped up and just looking to chat about people's experiences in vanilla.  
---
Most people who had pets never bandaged them.  It's an honest to goodness great advice for someone who may have little experience leveling pet classes.
---
Yeah! They wouldn’t even had to add more talents. Just let us go more points in other trees. 
---
If you're Alliance, you should have your hearth set to Menethil Harbour 95% of the time.  Lets you get anywhere pretty quickly.
---
I escaped that once.  Priest dropped me in the middle of the lake and I lava hopped my way out on my druid.  I was so proud.  Then I went back tried to killed the priest and he blew me away.  Shadow priests are hard.
---
1. Don't raid in arms. Just don't. Not being able to use mortal strike/bloodthirst cripples your DPS. Just absolutely screws it.   
---
2. Don't dual wield in arms. Again, its absolutely terrible. There is no reason to do this other than to try to fool a guild that you are fury spec. But they will figure it out really fast when you have no damage from Bloodthirst on the meters and your damage is shit. Fury is perfectly fine in raids and pvp. You don't NEED mortal strike.  
---
3. You use crusader in raids, not icy chill. Period. If people see you raiding with weapon chain and icy chill they are going to see you as someone who doesn't care about their performance in PvE and you will not be given loot. Other players try hard to be good in pvp and in pve and build sets and gear for both. Trying to have the "best of both worlds", while putting in no effort, won't end well.  
---
4. If you only have 2-3 hours to raid a week, then you can afford to respec arms the rest of the week. Respec costs are overexaggerated. If you want to be arms in pvp and still get raid gear, this is what you do. You don't not-so-secretly cripple your raiding group so you can pvp on a budget....  
---
The fact that you think that "not speccing Deep Wounds" is even an option when speccing Arms shows you really don't know what the arms talents are. If you didn't have impale in Arms, why are you even speccing Arms?  It seems like you just think you need to have Mortal Strike to pvp and really don't know anything about vanilla talent trees or itemization or playing warrior at all. 
---
God damn brother speak the truth. Leveling a warrior is so cancerous.
---
Sounds interesting. Was it confirmed by a Blizz staff?
---
Reminds me of trying to do scarlet monastery
---
As a warrior i learned to be patient and not hardpull
---
&gt;so you're okay with cross realm battlegrounds i take it
---
Yes, because vanilla had it.
---
&gt;And I don't see private server crowd complaining about those things not being "vanilla like"
---
Private server crowd has no choice but to deal with it not to mention every server has plenty of non "vanilla-like" features they deal with. 
---
BTW if you spent any time on pserver forums/subreddits they complain about shit all the time. dynamic respawn and population included.
---
Vanilla just doesn't need 8k players plain and simple. The world feels very alive with half of that.
---
Hi, /u/siskokid21
---
Healing pet with bandages is a unique trick? :)  
---
Kinda obvious if your low on mana
---
I had a similar reaction to Wrath. I played off and on through vanilla and TBC but quit sometime late in that xpac. When Wrath released I was in college so I deliberately avoided it, knowing it might consume my life and hurt my studies. At some point I did buy it, leveled from 70 to 80 and gave it a shot, but ultimately quit within a month.  
---
Looking back, the big reason WOTLK (ostensibly the best xpac) didn't "click" for me was because I didn't have a community. My guild from TBC was gone, and many of my WoW friends were no longer around or had gone to different servers. PvPing alone or doing dungeons with random PuGs wasn't engaging. The only reason I ever came back For Cata through Legion was because I found a new community through a random friend I had made way back in vanilla. I still play games with this guild today, even if I don't play WoW anymore.
---
No, but classic server population varied from a 2.5k cap up through about 4k cap towards the end so saying "same like it was in the original version" doesn't mean anything. They want classic to have good server population so it would make sense that they'd allow it higher than it was, especially initially knowing there will be some die off. It's pretty straight forward from the point of view of server health. 
---
My first two 60s was warrior and then paladin... I just didn’t know any better. Not sure I could do that again though lol.
---
Arms is by far the worst spec for tanking. Please don't do this. 
---
&gt;Most World PvPers don't like a fair fight, and I say this as someone who loves World PvP. Most World PvPers love a fight where they're 3 people against 2, where they have a healer and their opponents don't, or where their opponents are just two or three levels lower. 
---
True.  However, I realish a good fight.  I take on 2 v 1 pretty frequently.  But I'm also the guy who doesn't tend to gank lower level players unless I'm pissed off at someone else ganking me.
---
The other day in STV I was helping a warrior work on his WW axe quest and a group of 5 mid 30s tried to kill me on my 51 hunter.  It was wierd because I was just ignoring them while farming the mobs for my friend.  I ended up killing 2 of them, but the rest of the group just kept coming at me and I just kept kiting them.  I liked seeing them that agressive, but I was suprised they even tried against me.
---
Yeah I just rerolled a hunter after getting a paladin to 35. When I started playing paladin  I thought "This is not too bad", but by level30 you start getting tired of using only 2 abilities in a fight and autoattacking.  It was fun in the battlegrounds with a friend who plays rogue. Healing him up, removing stuff from him and watching him tear shit up was great. Especially since I only was lvl31 when we qued up together and I still could be a thorn in the enemies side.  
---
But I also need a class that can be great by himself, can have some fun in wPvP and be sufficient by himself. And I don't think paladin is for me. In wPvP your a joke, sure you are hard to kill but its hard to kill people if they just decide to run away. 
---
It's yours, so do whatever you want
---
I know its not that unique, but I didn't get very far into my hunter, so I didn't see much more I could find.
---
I forgot about this. Early on my hearth was usually near/at where I was questing, but later it stayed at Menethil.
---
STV is my favorite zone to level in.  Though I generally spend almost half my time while leveling, PvPing.
---
I learned to tank with a big 2hr instead of a sword and board.
---
&gt; I was going to walk away from this, but I feel like it needs to be said.  You're acting like a real asshole in this post. 
---
Thats fair. I felt the same way about OP. I didnt want to be the asshole, but something needed to be said.
---
&gt; Most people who had pets never bandaged them.  It's an honest to  goodness great advice for someone who may have little experience  leveling pet classes. 
---
Why would swing timer/hamstring kiting be specific to fury, and not also relevant for arms and/or prot?
---
I'd love to have that 2nd group comp in a 5 man.
---
&gt;Yes, because vanilla had it.  
---
only in the last patch tho  
---
&gt;Private server crowd has no choice but to deal with it 
---
lmao, it was always the point of prize for vanilla servers and always used as good point whenever someone talked about them  
---
"look how many people are playing! look how everything is alive! look how populated cities are!"  
---
So you saying "had to deal with it" is just disingenuous.  
---
&gt;Vanilla just doesn't need 8k players plain and simple. The world feels very alive with half of that.
---
Still not what majority of servers had. Which is why they had to introduce crossrealm BGs in the first place.   
---
Because there was not enough people...  
---
Yeah, I think the only times I had it not set there was when I was questing around Tanaris/Crater and early on set to Stormwind for training.
---
I would just grind out to level 10 on your own. It will be much faster, and you can do it in one solid play session. You will meet up soon enough in Barrens and have many happy questing days with your pal.
---
No?  No what?  I've talked to quite a few people who have leveled a hunter or warlock to 60 without ever using a bandage on their pets.  Just because it was obvious to you doesn't mean it shouldn't be mentioned to inexperienced players.  Back in vanilla days when information wasn't abundant, tips like this could make a huge difference for the casual player.
---
That was not the exploit; the 'exploit' was that reckoning had unlimited stacks - that's how they one-shot Kazzak. Also sitting to proc abilities on crit from NPCs did not work in 1.12 so it will not work in classic (and did not work in the demo); it's already been confirmed by multiple sources to be private server non-blizzlike behavior. You can still sit to proc abilities if other players crit you but it only works on special attacks (Sinister Strike, Hamstring, etc.)
---
Early cataclysm was good when the difficulty was cranked up, the. It just turned into mosh halfway through with extreme welfare epics and LFR lol.
---
Right? "I EATED THE FOOD WHEN MY HEALF WAS LOW AND I DRINK THE DRINKS WHEN MY GUY IS FIRSTY!"
---
I think the real challenge for Blizzard, if classic is a success, will be to devise a way to re-release old content (TBC, for example), without making the classic servers obsolete.
---
We all know when TBC dropped (or any subsequent expansion), it instantly made the previous content dead. Any gear or progression you had made was irrelevant, and it's on to the next expansion, replacing your hard earned epics with greens from quests.
---
Blizz has a interesting opportunity here, as a ton of people are excited for classic. The question is will they be able to continue to introduce recycled content, without killing the previous recycled content.
---
It's going to be really interesting to see how it all plays out.
---
Agreed. Adding new things is much more interesting than just rehashing old stuff.  
---
But rehashing is easier and bears 0 risks so blizzard is most likely to go with that.  
---
I made a Destro Warlock PvP video back in the day
---
See if you like it :)
---
https://youtu.be/XFqXph5wEzc
---
Its alright I am not that good of a player either.  
---
&gt; Back in vanilla days when information wasn't abundant, tips like this could make a huge difference for the casual player.
---
No. You cant just rewrite history... People sucked in Vanilla. I would know, I actually played it... Bandaging your pet was part of the game. Hunters did it in raids and duels and grinding and pvp... The value of mend pet was incredibly low and hunters never wasted their mana on mending unless they couldnt bandage. People werent complete morons.
---
...it was unforgiving. 
---
Any source for 5k on actual Vaniulla servers? I know Mark Kern said 3.5 to 4k, however in the same interview he also said that the game is designed for +- 2.5K players. 
---
Yeah exactly.  I think the 0 risk is the deciding factor here.  No one will complain if they're just putting out the same content they did last time.  That's inherently what we're asking for anyway.
---
Regardless, we're ahead of ourselves here by about two years.  We don't need to think about running out of content for a while.
---
&gt; Why would swing timer/hamstring kiting be specific to fury 
---
Because you shouldnt be leveling as anything but fury. Fury is the only relevant spec until Mortal Strike. At which point a case can be made for Arms which is certainly true on a pvp server.
---
Here is why the system he described does not work: You make a list of gear. You put your most desired item from Molten Core at the top : lets say Bonereaver's Edge. Now you raid MC for 5 months and never miss a single raid. But, Bonereaver's Edge never ever drops. You haven't missed a raid, but you aren't getting any gear because luck just isn't on your side, and you are only able to get the small subset of the gear in MC that is on the top of your list.  Meanwhile, someone who just happened to make a list that matches the drops your guild gets is going to get many pieces of gear in a row, just by chance.  Is that really a non-arbitrary system?!  
---
Loot council works great and doesn't have to be "arbitrary". It can be transparent and exact reasons why one person is getting a piece of gear can be given. Also, it actually prevents one person getting stacked on gear because of chance, rather than the system proposed above.  
---
You need to find a good guild you can trust and be a good player. Then, you won't be worried about your loot council's decisions.
---
Can you pm me the name of the server that’s had 2 years of Naxx and is alive?
---
Mine is running on 3 months of Naxx and is wavering; nobody has full or even much Naxx gear, that I can see
---
There's a cool staff from Gnomeregan that gives you unlimited underwater breathing when you equip it. It's one item that is always in my bag.
---
omg, that's awesome! that's gonna save me some time!
---
What kind of things do you need to get done before launch?  
---
I really liked the video apart for the fucking my mum part. That might appeal to some people but I feel like most people excited for Classic wow are past those kind of jokes. 
---
"ACTUALLY IN VANILLA, We didnt know what are hands were for so we used our faces to control our characters... We would grind our faces along the keyboard all day... I used to actually have one of those soft plastic keyboard covers to reduce the friction against my stupid face during long raids..."
---
Might do that, but I love mulgore so damn much
---
&gt;only in the last patch tho 
---
Which classic will be on.
---
&gt;lmao, it was always the point of praise for vanilla servers and always used as good point whenever someone talked about them
---
"look how many people are playing! look how everything is alive! look how populated cities are!" 
---
Only in the last few years, before nost rolled around private servers were considered high pop at 2k online at any given time. Now people say servers are dead when they reach 3k.
---
&gt;So you saying "had to deal with it" is just disingenuous. 
---
Not at all, my point was if someone didn't like the high pop they have to just leave since they generally only have one server per provider. If nost was the best server at the time their choice was to either deal with the massive pop, lag and distance or go join a lesser server.
---
&gt;Because it was not properly implemented so people struggled to level and do quests. 
---
Its just a symptom of vanilla. It was never supposed to handle that amount of players. Even with shit like dynamic respawn it's extremely jank.
---
&gt;Still not what majority of servers had. Which is why they had to introduce crossrealm BGs in the first place.
---
Because there was not enough people... 
---
You're going to have low pop servers no matter what. Adding more pop doesn't solve the issue, the only way to solve it is merge low pop servers with others and close it.
---
Whyyy do you caallll? 
---
Didn't you upload this earlier today?
---
10k pop is perfect 
---
When a hunter at the top of the "suicide kings" list takes Ashkandi from your warriors, you will not be saying this system "removes human decision from the equation". 
---
the mage will pay to be able to spend their time which should be used for dpsing to make food.. ? doesnt add up. paying for this item does not make any sense at all. wouldnt spend too much time perfecting this farm. if the price for this is high enough for this to be viable, my mind will be blown. played mage on pservers and in retail vanilla, this item was never a big deal. theres like 3 encounters where melee/raid needs to sit down and eat or die, they can bring food for that.
---
Maraudon had two entrances, differentiated by the color of crystals around the caves leading to the instance portals. Orange crystals and purple crystals - the different entrances would place you at different parts of the instance, just like the various Stratholme entrances :) 
---
Akchually, leveling as fury is only good on private servers because of the non-blizzlike behavior of sit-critting. When you remove that, fury talents are actually worse than arms for leveling. You don't really get much other than Cruelty that will help you level more efficiently; by the time you max out Flurry you're level 38. On the other hand, with Arms you get 5% parry which is very good to reduce downtime, cheaper heroic strike, tactical mastery to help you tank dungeons, anger management to greatly help with rage generation/upkeep, improved overpower for all those dodges (and you will be dodged a lot while leveling), deep wounds/impale, etc. The best thing to do is get 5/5 Cruelty right off the bat then start going down the Arms tree til you're 40, then respec to MS and fill Cruelty again and go down the fury tree.
---
yeah i cant think of a single person who was happy when the population went from 8k to 4k on anethema when fresh launched. everyone complained about 4k being low pop.
---
&gt; It just never becomes good
---
I see you've never played a Paladin, then.
---
At least Paladin can just heal itself after combat unlike Warrior that has to eat/bandage every 2 mobs. And once you hit level 34 and get 5/5 reckoning, you literally have one of the fastest kill speeds of any class, rivaled only by Hunter or Mage with good crit RNG.
---
&gt;Warrior becomes a wrecking ball
---
at max level with stacked raid/pvp year, yes.
---
Hello there, yes we did but unfortunate we made some spelling mistakes so I deleted it.
---
&gt; that's how they one-shot Kazzak
---
Which was literally hotfixed within 24 hours, so why even bring it up?
---
Sorry if I am late to the party.
---
Hunter melee tanks are actually a thing, they can get quite high on the raiding ladder (AQ). The big problem is their lack of significant threat dealing abilities. Although, they can reach a higher tanking status depending on the server's coding treatment of Shadow Oil. Their survivability on the other hand is not a problem (especially on Alliance). 
---
I am happy to talk more about this subject, if you're interested.
---
It's the type of humor we have in this community and many others around in the private server scene also for that matter. Sad you didn't like it,  perhaps our 2nd video fall more into your taste.
---
I also played vanilla religiously.  You are extremely overestimating the capabilities of the average player.
---
u/AlternateQuestion said 'cough reckoning exploit' and you replied that sit-critting was not an exploit. But that's not what he was referring to which is why I brought it up.
---
Looking for an [A] Oceanic Guild (I'm from New Zealand)
---
It's all about #DadLife now, so looking for a casual guild that would also enjoy taking on some dungeons and raids, while leveling and chilling together. Will be rolling a Priest or Mage (still deciding). 
---
Sooo fury is the only relevant spec except when it isn’t.
---
 I ask because I hit 40 yesterday on a PvP pserver and the first thing I did, before even buying a mount, was I respecced into Arms for MS, on the advice of some reliable guides, which I will remain until 60 (at least when I get some reasonable 1handers, as my understanding is that is always better than 2h fury on alliance), and feel that is both a valid and competitive choice. 40-60 is going to comprise at least half, if not much more, of my /played until 60, and so is a relevant part of the experience. This is no memespecc “CLASS FANTASY” retadin whining.
---
Basically, you can disagree with the use of other specs, but they may as well learn hamstring/swing kiting the same as anyone else. There was no need to exclude other specs in such a general piece of warrior advice.
---
Doesn't cc last 15/10/5 seconds on 1.12?
---
Strat Live and reserve 1 orb + flask recipe, is what most people do in terms of tanking.
---
You can also do DM East, pretty easy to 2-man it with some decent preraid gear, and you just vendor / disenchant all the drops and you get 2 rich thorium veins every time for arcane crystals.
---
The Hydrocane! A real classic, that one.
---
I have always been curious as to how it would go if they basically added tbc content, but kept the level cap t 60 and tuned it to naxx40+.
---
That is a tough one as what a tank and healer can do is basically the same as what a mage/hunter/lock can do solo.  
---
Their highest damage ability in fact (until execute range)
---
Sorry I am late to the party.
---
I am known around the community for my warlock tanking.(I also have a tank guide on the Warlock Classic Discord) They can tank quite a few bosses and reach the higher levels of raiding content. However, it requires good gear and buffs alongside a skilled guild. Contrary to what people tell you, locks have no problem dealing threat and surviving the majority of raid bosses out there.
---
Why not both?
---
I saw this as a lowly Undead Rogue, probably level 30 or so, back in 2004/2005. Blew my mind watching a mounted high-level character run through it. You don't actually run through the VERY center of the fountain/statue, but just a bit off-center to the left or right and your character will naturally path up and down it.
---
1. Bind everything if you can. Buy a MMO mouse like a Logitech G600 (it helps a lot)
---
2. Find a guild with people that you enjoy being around and make friends.
---
3. Dont join a guild that are full of meter whores and tryhards. Find a guild that rewards mechanical skill and overall mastery your class. Tryhard guilds are usually toxic and will burn out too fast and die in the second half of vanilla.
---
4. Do not go too hard in Molten Core era (flasking every week). A better use of time is to save up for the rest of vanilla. Stack consumes and gold for AQ and Naxx.
---
Mages can solo farm for their own doll though.
---
Please post guild recruitment posts/videos or posts inquiring about looking for a guild to join in [the weekly stickied LFG post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ai8k0q/looking_for_group_monday_january_21_2019/)
---
I know it sucks to make a cool recruitment video and have it stuck to a comment, but we get too many LFG/recruitment posts every day to not try and corrall them. Thanks for your understanding, and sorry for the inconvenience.
---
Shaman tanks can easily achieve the higher raiding content. However, it requires good gear and buffs alongside a skilled guild. Shamans most closely resemble a feral druid's stats. (druids can tank almost everything)
---
Naw. Players sucked. But bandaging your pet is the equivalent of drinking water when low on mana or eating food when low on health. Players werent mentally disabled. I feel like people go too far in either direction, either overestimating their capacity in vanilla or drastically underestimating it.
---
In my opinion cata was much worse than wotlk. wotlk had some fun raids with fun mechanics. Cata was a mess.
---
&gt; fury talents are actually worse than arms for leveling 
---
Oops. No they arent. 
---
&gt; The best thing to do is get 5/5 Cruelty right off the bat then start going down the Arms tree til you're 40 
---
incorrect.
---
Yea. Read my post silly... 
---
&gt; Because you shouldnt be leveling as anything but fury. Fury is the only  relevant spec until Mortal Strike. At which point a case can be made for  Arms which is certainly true on a pvp server. -Me  
---
&gt;Fury is the only  relevant spec until Mortal Strike.  
---
&gt;a case can be made for Arms
---
Reading is tough stuff!
---
If you are a druid you can stealth in BRD to the Anvil and kill the fireboss Lord Incendius and D/E his drops. You just need a friend to invite you into a group between runs to reset the dungeon. I think it takes about 12 minutes and the boss is easy to solo in resto main with either NS or feral as offspec.
---
Yep. We are FAR behind their development cycle as far as information goes. If they are saying they are "considering" something, its likely already been implemented and they are assessing its reception / trying to break it to us easy.
---
If its in the game, I will use everything at my disposal to gain a competitive advantage. That means I will be needing on loot for my friends and they will for me. I will also be keeping spare gear in my bags so that I can mask what I am doing from the rest of the group. I likely wont get caught and if I do, it will be a very small repercussion for getting a game changing piece of pre BiS for me or a friend.
---
You’ve got one of the most lucrative options available. 2 person DME jump runs. If one of you can disenchant, and one of you can mine, you’re in for a lot of gold.
---
Why do posts like this get upvoted? No hate I legit do not understand why people want to see this
---
AFter we got server first dicks out
---
Going by the timeline presented at Blizzcon, DM will be out at release. Some people think this is horrendous ofc, but for almost everyone who played vanilla back then, they either started/hit 60 after its release (if US), or basically had it out on release anyway (if EU).
---
 You and me both, man. I just don't have the time to get bogged down in PVP any more. 
---
- EU
---
-PvP or PvE
---
- Looking to raid and do dungeons(mostly PvE stuff then I guess)
---
-Playing times not yet set in stone
---
- LF Guild that wants to progress but it’s also okay to not raid every week so perhaps semi casual I guess
---
- Will for sure play priest as a healer since this is what I did in original vanilla and fuck I need to finally get benediction...
---
-HMU on PM pls and ask away
---
Great video and good choice of Music!
---
Chill, I always played 2h arms, this would have been just an experiment, I never tried it before (but it seemed interesting on paper). I guess BC spoiled me rotten because I was doing fine in raids as arms with a 2h in pvp gear just fine. Not topping the charts but I was always in top 10, sometimes top 5.
---
Right? In vanilla 5 mans trash is usually the hardest part. Bosses are dead easy.  
---
I see what you're trying to say but it's to get the point across as a part of the discussion. I don't care to brag about getting server firsts 12 years ago in a forum where no one will even know who I was. It's to reiterate how many of us have the common experience of feeling like you got to the top of whatever hill back then and thought the sun had set on this game for you, but here we are waiting for Classic
---
I also knew plenty of people who never even leveled first aid in the first place.  Plenty of people never bought food or water either.  Another good hint to give new people is "Buy food/water from a mage before leaving town for a long period of play.  It's worth it!"  We're not necessarily talking about hints to be the uber best player, but small stuff like that isn't always intuitive to all players.
---
I think you need to provide a photo with you holding up a written support ticket "code" next to the cd key for it to be taken as legit. 
---
I was also going to recommend live strat orb farming.
---
From a gameplay perspective I think there is no other class that trumps paladin in its dullness. Healing is mostly spamming flash heal thingi, PvP is despelling, cycling blessings dependant on the situation and healing. It's just so unengaging to say an elemental shaman or priest.
---
Love it.
---
I respect your accomplishments.  Said it more for comedic value.
---
You have to understand something, the guys you're talking to, which are the vocal minority on this subreddit, all have had naxx on farm for many years in pservers. And they know they are gonna be among the elite in Classic, therefore they will do everything to defend their position, even if what you are saying is very reasonable for any other player.
---
What they probably don't realize, is that most people won't be like they. They will only exist as elite clusters in guilds and if lucky more than 1 guild like that per server. Most people won't be as geared as you think, even 2+ years into Vanilla. People in Vanilla, and therefore in Classic mostly are 1) not hardcore 2) PvP focused 3) farm/rep/quest oriented 4) altoholic 5) a bit of everything (which is not PvE endgame focused)
---
Don't worry.
---
Comedy appreciated, was just making sure haha

Hardcore PvE Guild, with PvP Events
---
**The Philosophy**
---
We're a guild consisting of three friends with experience from the private server hardcore community, and have participated in speedruns and realm firsts in various raids. However we haven't been active in that community for a while now and instead turned our attention towards planning our own guild when the official servers arrive. 
---
We're planning to be a top-tier raiding guild, and hopefully realm first, throughout all of Classic content. We already have a lot of preparation done, and are currently on the state where we only need to recruit people.
---
**What we expect of you**
---
We have some fairly high demands for those of you who are interested in joining our guild, but deem this necessary as our expectations are high. However if you don't have any experience, don't let this scare you away, we feel confident that the leadership and class leaders will be able to help you out. However we do expect you to put the time and dedication in the game needed to participate in this level of gameplay. 
---
**(Preliminary) Raid Schedule** (GMT+1)

A Shammy vs Pally duel is a thousand years of pain in the ass fight cause they ll become out of mana faster and all mana gain in fight ll be used to heal
---
..so just ghost wolf and don't waste time, 
---
unless the fight become a 2v2 then FIGHT FOR DA HORDE
---
You might be okay in a casual guild as 2h arms but 2h fury is much better. TBC had titan's grip which made arms more viable as dps spec.
---
&gt;Which classic will be on.
---
Not the content tho. Also because blizzard doesn't wanna put resources in applying changes per patch like original game did.  
---
&gt;Only in the last few years, before nost rolled around private servers were considered high pop at 2k online at any given time  
---
Nah, Lolten always had way more.  
---
&gt;Not at all, my point was if someone didn't like the high pop they have to just leave since they generally only have one server per provider. If nost was the best server at the time their choice was to either deal with the massive pop, lag and poor render distance or go join a lesser server  
---
So the only faults you can name is something that does not have anything to do with massive pop but rather poor hardware?   
---
Thanks for proving my argument.  
---
&gt;Its just a symptom of vanilla. It was never supposed to handle that amount of players. Even with shit like dynamic respawn it's extremely jank  
---
Nobody is saying we should stuff 15k people on a server.  
---
The only thing that could not handle more players was spawn rates and servers. Everything that can be easily achieved and solved today.  
---
&gt;You're going to have low pop servers no matter what. Adding more pop doesn't solve the issue, the only way to solve it is merge low pop servers with others and close it.  
---
Actually, it does. If you create fewer servers but with bigger caps it will make sure they stay healthier after tourists are gone. If you make low cap and make a bunch of servers then they will obviously fall low since population gets too spread.  
---
No reason to have to merge servers when you can prevent such situation from happening for a long time.  
---
Blood elfs ...
---
I know I am commenting a bit late. But I have A LOT of experience with "fringe tanking".
---
Rogues can tank raids (especially on Alliance). They have no problem surviving a boss fight but are hindered when it comes to dealing threat. They have an easier time inducing threat on servers that treat Shadow Oil differently.(scaling with ISB, pots, etc..)
---
However, there is still an over-looming problem with threat. As of writing, the talent "Setup" is horribly inaccurate and flat out not working properly. If this talent was fixed, threat would be MUCH easier to dish out, they would have no problem tanking AQ and higher.
---
Shaman tanks are capable of reaching the same stats as a feral bear tank. (bears can tank nearly everything in wow) Make of that, what you will...
---
Mage tanking is a thing (only possible on Alliance). They heavily rely on the raid's use of multiple Arcanite Dragonling. They can reach 10k hp and 10.5k armor or ~12k hp/ 11.5k armor with special event buffs.
---
Priest Tanking is also very much a thing and most closely approach the tanking potential of a warlock tank.
---
&gt;  If you have a problem with that, vanilla probably isn't for you. 
---
Lol, Barely no one I met in PvP had Naxx gear. Vanilla wasn't like you describe. Stop trying to convince people that pservers norm should be the norm in Classic. Just get out.
---
Until everyone will stop PvP because what's the point in getting one shot in most encounters even if you have MC / 20 mans gear? And no they maybe don't want to do ultra endgame PvP, to have regular weekly schedule to get gear, to that for many, many months.
---
Classic PvP should be fun for everyone. The difference between T3 and T2.5 gear is too high. It should ideally be lowered.
---
pm sent
---
Why would you bring 3 tanks to a 5 man?
---
Technically he should frame only half of Wotlk because it kinda started to go bad halfway with dungeon finder and store mounts one room raid etc. 
---
No, Titan's grip was WotLK addition actually but Arms was still pretty viable in raids regardless in BC.
---
&gt; We're not necessarily talking about hints to be the uber best player 
---
I played and raided on both alliance and horde, made it to rank 13 as a NE shadow priest and had several level 60s, and also played/raided on my brothers accounts. I raided with a lot of different guilds. By the mid-point in vanilla it was common practice for guilds to require X fire resist, X general gear and max level first aid. Most guilds required first aid, to say otherwise is silly. This was certainly true for the last half of vanillas life cycle.
---
You are funny really. Hopefully Blizzard will shut down that mentality a good announcement before naxx gets out in Classic.
---
Yeah this almost never happened in vanilla. On private servers it happens constantly because they've made changes to the game and realm sizes are insane and non blizzlike. 
---
How expensive are flasks?
---
How long for an alchemist to farm one do you estimate?
---
Wrath introduced things that stated to erode the game. But I don’t think it was immediately awful. Most of Wrath until the tail end was great. Really through TBC and Wrath They did a great job of making classes viable while keeping them unique 
---
&gt; I have unfinished business that needs to be resolved so I can just move on.  
---
This is my motivations for Classic.  
---
Finish it and be done.  
---
Except you're forgetting that they also optimized their customer support a shit ton since 2004 which saves them a lot,  and bandwidth is a lot cheaper nowadays. They're probably making comparable profits on the sub cost per player that they were back then. The cash shop was most likely motivated by them bleeding subs.
---
I’ll take a shot at this one...
---
During MC patch: Low damage and healing numbers, relatively limited burst potential. During this phase of the game 3500-4000 unbuffed is considered to be a large health pool. Frost Mages &amp; Hunters are OP during this phase of the game.
---
During BWL: Probably the most balanced and enjoyable stage of PvP. Every class is strong if it’s put in the correct role and played well. Damage classes have reliable burst but healers are able to keep up. Health pools feel just right, with geared players being between 4000-4500 depending on class.
---
During AQ: Warriors begin to emerge as the best pure/consistent PvP damage dealers, and burst from classes like Fire Mages and Warlocks becomes more difficult to survive or heal through.
---
During Naxx: Damage gets pretty out of control. Warlocks, Warriors, and Fire Mages become 1 shot machines. Health pools of geared players reach the 5000-6000 range here but damage scales much more sharply. At this point if you’re not above 4500 HP you will struggle.
---
I never understood people who quit in TBC or even early-Wrath.  
---
I was STRONGLY addicted from vanilla launch until ToC came out in Wrath. I quit for ToC and then was strongly addicted again in ICC (being given a legendary changes your devotion a bit)  
---
Then the Ruby Sanctum came out and I knew it was over.  
---
I wrote my post in light of having read that. I don’t see how you got the impression I didn’t recognise that. I think you’re the one who may require reading comprehension classes.
---
..why?
---
Offering a TBC move as optional creates problems in that it fractures a server. You probably end up needing to merge realms and annoying people as a result. 
---
I’d rather have new content in the spirit of classic. Keep the leve cap the same and add new dungeons and whatnot. Hell, they could even use some of the TBC stuff that was back on Azeroth. Some of it was likely planned long before it got shoved into TBC.  
---
So 53% chance to get the drop per hour.  Now what's the chance to get at least 4 in 5 hours if we use the simplified rate?  is it 5\*.53\^4\*(1-.53)+.53\^5?  5 Different combinations of hours with 4 successes and one failure and one all success.  In this simplified version of it, OP only has a 20.8% chance of having 4 more hours with a book within a 5 hour period.  To get closer to what OP needs, though I need to figure out how to include the chance of multiple books per hour and correct for that.
---
I'm not sure of the exact values but it was greatly reduced with TBC at the same time that resilience came into play.  It can last a LONG ass time.  I've played enough warlock and druid to see endless fear and roots and cheese to the fullest extent. 
---
&gt; Make changes to Vanilla like the aesthetics shop and other money grabs.
---
They won't do that. The whole reason they're even releasing Classic is to get additional subscriptions, and adding stuff like this would undo that.
---
Rehashing fragments the player base at every expansion and at some point it just repeats the same cycle that made people quit in the first place. 
---
It's not a huge deal, but it makes a difference.  All mages should try to get this.  It's very nice for healers in duengons and raids, and it's awesome for everyone in bgs.
---
The easy solution is to never go to TBC. Some of that content can be reused since it was in Azeroth. They have plenty of other stuff that they had started working on but put aside. I think if they trickle out new stuff people will stick around even if it’s not at the same rate. 
---
Was going to say this. The conjure tome could just be a bonus.  
---
What you just described applies to all healers.
---
I've played all healers at 60.
---
This can be done by a warrior aswell. I did it all the time to craft on the black anvil or to jump off the side and lava swim to the forge. 
---
&gt; The archivist is a two phase fight with a sleep mechanic  
---
That sounds like the last boss.  
---
i cant name the servers becoz stupid rules, but 200g is way overpriced. got it for 70g once and have never really seen it above 150g and that was only at a time where noone was doing live runs anymore.
---
200g is way too optimistic.
---
I played only horde and only one server.  The only people who required first aid were premade BG groups on my server.  The only requirement to join into raids outside the most hardcore guild was consistent attendance.
---
No he didn't, the two are totally different tools that were launched at different times. Phases are Blizz's attempt to allow players to experience the persistent effects of their own actions. So say there's a quest where you rescue some NPC, if I've done that quest, I go into the phase with everybody who has also done that quest and do not see the NPC. Everybody who has yet to do the quest goes into the phase where the NPC is up and crying for help.
---
Sharding is simply based on distributing the population regardless of what is happening in the world around them.
---
You can't see how launching as a free add-on to a game with millions of active players who can download the game while taking a shower might have a different launch experience than a game that required everybody to go out and drop $50 for a boxed copy?
---
Yup, my bad. Was confused about who dropped it.
---
&gt;http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r18480801-Disenchanting-for-profit-a-guide
---
Actually you are the one confusing retail with classic.  
---
In true classic/vanilla you could disenchant any item as long as you had Enchanting. Even if that item was a level 60 epic and you were a level 5 (level required to get enchanting) with 1 skill point in enchanting.  
---
When they released TBC that changed and they required your enchanting to be a certain level based on item level.
---
They may have changed it back eventually or changed it to what it is now in retail but you are wrong about Vanilla WoW. I know this because I both played Vanilla WoW in Beta all the way through WoTLK and am currently playing on a Blizz Like Private Server and have a bank alt with enchanting that can disenchant any item.
---
I am also pretty sure you can level enchanting using disenchant well past skill 60 in Vanilla WoW, but I haven't gotten that far yet. 
---
Yikes, you should have paid more attention to the guild chat spam. They were all asking for first aid.
---
I'm practicing with 0 addons and extremely simple macros that I know still work in Classic.  
---
What about the content that was already 'there' but not released until later like hyjal for example. Or like we had a staff to teleport to karazhan but no karazhan. 
---
Go play a different fucking game then. 
---
This is true bis  for most casters and any fc
---
Flasks take a black lotus (50-100g)
---
30-40 more herbs so add another 25-50g
---
so on average thats around 75-150g for a flask. Some people use them each week if they are able to.
---
its cruicial to stack herbs early on as they will be cheaper to purchase before gold inflates.
---
stack dreamfoil as a caster and gromsblood a melee (everyone will need dreamfoil for protection potions so its good to stack as well if ur melee)
---
Grim Batol in Wetlands. Always thought it might be used for something in the future.
---
So you agree with my initial post then? I'll take my upvotes please!
---
Teasers that ended up being disappointing: Uldum and whatever that gate is in hills in Eastern Wetlands.  
---
The difference between AQ gear and Naxx gear is insane, and a way greater gap than AQ gear and BWL gear.

Yes, we went from a 54% block shield, to a 55% block shield, to a fucking 90% block shield.   
---
Some gear progression was more logical... but that is just insane. Blizzard was meming when they made this gear.

Lol what are you talking about?

"Reasonable upgrade from previous tiers". WHAT?
---
Bro lemme get that disenchant button on the need/greed window.  
---
That's a good sign then! It'll definitely need some oversight so Devs don't essentially turn Classic into retail with addons. Is it a reasonable concern that certain function calls will likely fail when referencing things like quests, items, and spells considering many of them aren't the same IDs as retail? That's something where using the modern API could take some tweaking on their end.
---
Gnome rogue with Red Defias Mask?
---
does blizzard not break frost nova?
---
I also want a cap of 6k players. It has to be lower than private servers because the Classic servers will be regional where was privates are international with two distinct population peaks (9pm CST and 10am CST), but I want it higher than vanilla was.  
---
You’re clueless, and worse still, proud of it, lol. Completely missed the point of any of my comments.
---
9pm CST happens when this comment is 5 hours and 51 minutes old.

Grim Batol in Wetlands, I remember discovering it while leveling and  spending hours wall walking trying to get past the dragons. It was just so cool to find a place covered in lvl 60 elite dragons in a lvl 20-30 zone. When cata came out, blizz just turned it into a boring and small 5man dungeon despite the place being a hotspot of lore. 
---
Private servers are maybe a bit off with numbers, but all the people who act like they are going to be WILDLY different from classic are being stupid. The numbers might be off a bit, but they are close for the most part. MC is not going to be hard for experienced players who know the game, even if you double ragnaros' HP from the private servers.
---
I say 4k or I just go on a low-pop server.
---
High population means more wpvp, but is srsly bad for raiding.
---
Stop. Making. These. Posts.
---
Oooooor yknow, a different server type?
---
No need to be aggressive. 
---
Ok, No. That isn't block %. And you're comparing a pally shield to warrior shields. Face of death is probably the best tanking sheild. [https://classicdb.ch/?item=23043](https://classicdb.ch/?item=23043)   
---
BWL to AQ is 71 amor, loss of 3 stamina, loss of 3 block value, plus 1 defense, increased block chance by 3%.  
---
AQ to Naxx is 530 armor, plus 1 stamina, plus 17 block value.  
---
Its a good upgrade from AQ to NAxx, but its not anywhere near what you're talking about with block%. Thats BLOCK VALUE and not % and you didn't factor in the bonus stats on the shields.
---
Warriors are best. 
---
If you compare a raid composition to a Peter Gabriel song, shaman are the bass and druids are the various "worldy instruments"
---
Do you want to be the rhythm that makes everyone else sound better or do you want to be the niche instruments that add something minor but just as essential to the atmosphere?
---
For PvP, I think Shaman are more fun, whether enhance or ele, but boomkin pvp is hysterical because you're a big fat lazer turkey and you blow your celestial load on punk asses for 5 seconds before you need to recharge.
---
I still dont understand why you cant level both? Is Classic terminating after the 1 year mark? Or will it exist for the foreseeable future?
---
As a rogue :
---
Sap - CS with /stopattack - wait 5s and restealth - start fight with 2 extra combo points.
---
Other than that well timed distraction let's you mess with mages CoC
---
Just watch [this](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=AM1bSJm6GTE) If you want to take your rogue (and general) PvP game to the ultimate level
---
These are some really shitty ideas that wont appeal to many. They likely wont do ANY of what youre suggesting but I suppose its fun for you to think about while you wait?
---
To be fair, the first year of classic can't really be replicated without a fresh server. If you level up a toon to 60 and a year later you level up an alt to 60, because of what other gear has been released into the game it's a stark difference. Running around with blue pvp gear in week 10 of the server versus 1 year into it is nowhere near the same in terms of how you match up to other players you'll encounter. 
---
A lot of people think that that period of Vanilla is the most rewarding, and I can totally understand that. You put in more time than others you get out more, there's less people that can 'match up' to you. As time goes on, this gap lessens for hardcore players and widens between casual players.
---
Professions, AH, ALTS. I guess strath live side for orbs. Sell items from MC with your guild 
---
It's way less ass having an arms tank than having an arms dps.
---
You put point into improving the slow and use with cone of cold which slows them all to a crawl. They slowly walk after you while you kill them. AoE farming is amazing as you kill 5+ mobs in the same time it would take you to kill 1. 
---
why comment then lol...?
---
shammy vs pala is not a fair duel at all. pala cant heal the burst.
---
shadowrun is my all time favorite game man
---
Might as well have everyone be arms dps then because they gonna pull threat if they actually try to dps. 
---
well thats what i was asking
---
Maybe. I'm not familiar with them, but they're rage based, so no drinking every single fucking minute, and they allegedly have nice aoe threat.
---
I'm pretty sure their tps is not significantly worse than a prot warrior's.
---
&gt; as having three different versions running on live is something they will be against.
---
Not necessarily. The large amount of coding needing to be done was porting Classic to the current framework. Once that is done most systems such as talent trees, achievements, etc. will have been written and these can be switched on and off as needed.
---
Also, they are keeping Classic on the modern framework so they don't have to fix bugs in multiple versions. Fix it in one spot, fix it across all games essentially.
---
When I saw the event after getting my ashbringer I was extremely disappointed. Where us my legendary quest line :(
---
It depends a bit on the content in question, but generally yes. Druids generate more threat and have better damage mitigation when they don't have to worry too much about crushing blows and such from L63's. It's only at the later gear levels where Warriors start to surpass Druids even when not dealing with L63's.
---
There's a lot of reasons that make Warriors better in most raid conditions, such as shield block pushing crushing blows/crits off the table, superior late game itemisation, and a much stronger defensive cooldown (Shield Wall vs Feral Regeneration). But none of those things are really all that major prior to raids.
---
both are great classes, shammy is the master of burst though.
---
also ankh is not a wipe recovery tool. most of the time you will have to use it in fights. (only bad shamans dont spec improved ankh)
---
Just a little late gane insight on shaman from my experience  - I had a friend play Shaman in both high-level PVE (early Naxx) and high-level PVP (rank 13). I played it a few times in pvp and as resto in raids.
---
He would mostly stay Elemental spec, and heal through the early raids just fine. This also allowed him to jump in as DPS on trash and easier bosses. 
---
In both situations, you want to have plenty of mana potions. As Elemental, you are not as mana efficient as Resto when healing and your lightning spells also consume a lot of mana. To be great in either role as a shaman, you'll be a mana potion addict.
---
However, whenever we had to clear aq40 or naxx, he would usually have to go deeper into the Resto tree because we had some great dps and on raw #s he couldn't keep up. But, Naxx geared shamans are considered the greatest healers in the game, so there's that.
---
I’m not much of a Shaman guy but I’ll say this much:
---
1: “don’t get to see gear often”: Druid’s actually tend to gear quickly in PvE. There are also a number of pieces of gear in PvE that are insane for Druid PvP and they tend to be not time consuming to collect (in the sense that the raid will pass you over). If you really want Staff of the Shadow Flame or Lok’Amir il Romanthis yeah you will wait, and good rings and damage trinkets will also have you at the back of the list, but most of the good stuff you can get in a reasonable amount of time.
---
2: Almost none of the best feral gear is hidden behind BG grinds. There definitely are a few really great pieces in WSG and AB (AV is easy to get exalted so it doesn’t count) but a lot of great pieces are in AQ20, ZG, DM, etc. So there are replacements.
---
3 “desired for premades”: They are desired in WSG and AV has nothing to do with desire so their only questionable spot is AB. Druid’s mobility strengths aren’t as great in AB, but they can still do a lot of neat tricks so I’m not sure if this is right or not. I can only speak for myself, but I never had problems getting into my premades (as a resto pocket healer, feral Druid YMMV).
---
Food for thought.
---
When you first pick up skinning, you can skill up off of the critters, ie. Deer, cows etc. ALSO if you skin sheep, you can get wool instead of leather 
---
Yes, Mark Kern and Kevin Jordan confirmed the concurrent player cap was a design decision. But it was a dynamic cap, which was higher towards the end. Mark Kern confirmed the cap was “more or less” 3k. He also said the maximum the hardware could handle was 3.5k-4k, although it is unknown if any servers had a cap of 3.5k or higher.
---
The hardware maximum was 3.5k-4k, so 5k would not have been possible.
---
Well aren't you the pinnacle of manhood. Ladies must be clawing their way through each other to get to your big boy pants. 
---
In the Classic demo, skeletons (and dead mobs) disappear very quickly.
---
In Vanilla (and pservers) it's possible to kill a mob, die, take 5 minutes to run back to your corpse, and the mob's corpse is still there for you to loot.
---
I don't know how long skeletons last in Vanilla, but it seems very very long.
---
Hopefully the devs fix this by summer.
---
There’s always some dude spamming chat with all the good loot reserved still looking for a melee.
---
Problem here is the minute you add to it, it’s no longer Classic. The word classic alone kinda says no new content added.
---
Would it be cool to see stuff added in the same vein? Sure. Would it be Classic? No, no it would not.
---
So I'm wrong and you're not a WoD baby? 
---
On the pserver I play, people absolutely know who ninja looters are. What really blew me away is how knowledgeable and courteous the vast majority of players are.
---
I've never once, not once, had an English speaking player do something out of line like roll inappropriately or not /roll on a chest.
---
There have been ninja looters and word quickly spreads. It is a really tight knit community (blizzlike ~2k concurrent pop server).
---
I can examine these claims in detail but the bottom line is always the same. The problem with twinkers is that they break the low-level PvP game and ruin it for normal players, that is the issue any apologia has to address. And it never satisfactorily does.
---
&gt; There's very few players queuing for lowbie battlegrounds already, so making up ways to split them up further will just make make queue times exponentially longer. 
---
Nonsense. Twinks are an annoying minority and everyone else would much rather wait a few minutes longer than have to be in a battleground with them. Getting rid of twinks would absolutely not make queues "exponentially" longer and that is absurd hyperbole.
---
&gt;  People play twinks exactly because it's an uneven playing field and because the gearing process is actually rather interesting when the game isn't dictating what you can and cannot do.
---
You aren't helping your case. Yes, people twink because they want an unfair fight. This does not make an unfair fight good game design.
---
&gt; Not being able to lock your XP means you can actually fuck up
---
So what? The fact that a twinker could have fucked up does not fix the game.
---
&gt; We're talking about thousand of gold being spend on niche gear and consumables while also having to run around the world collecting world buffs if you really want to go ham.
---
So what? The fact a twinker wasted time or gold twinking does not fix the game.
---
&gt; If someone is bored enough to go through all that garbage and sit in a queue for hours just to plow helpless noobs then I have absolutely no problem with it, 
---
The question is not whether you have a problem with it. You cannot handwave away all moral problems or game design problems by saying "I do not have a problem with it, therefore it is not a problem!".
---
&gt; Don't confuse genuine bugs/oversight with someone being mean.
---
We could have an interesting discussion over whether twinks are mean (the ones with /spit macros are, I am pretty sure) or merely psychopathically self-absorbed and genuinely unable to think about how their actions affect others. But they are bad for the game in either case so it seems like a distraction.
---
&gt; The retail game got exponentially more terrible with each expansion they decided to start forcing people to play the way they intended rather than letting people figure out their own adventure.
---
Freedom is a virtue, up until the point where freedom to ruin other people's gameplay gets used to do exactly that.
---
The bottom line is that the low-level pvp game would be significantly improved if twinks just went away forever, and any small step to curtail twinking without hurting normal players is a win for the game.
---
I’d say this is a hard “maybe” and largely depends on which patch you might be in. If DM is live, then you have access to the unyielding maul which is extremely easy to get and juices your armour big time. If BG’s are out, the AV rank 6 trinket is great if you don’t have heart or the armour trinket, as well as AB shoulders and belt, etc etc.
---
It’s always down to player skill and gear. Almost impossible to say something definitively without more info.
---
Community splitting is inversely proportional to patch distance.
---
BFA and Classic are vastly different. With a TBC option there would definitely be a fracture.
---
Now whether this is worth the fracture or not is another debate. I am personally not a fan of TBC at all (old content dead, faster 1-60 without elite mobs, lvl 30 mount, easy epics, flying mounts) but I can see why some people like it.
---
I never encountered it in Vanilla but yeaaahh that instance is so boring. It's a dwarf fortress, and dwarf fortresses make for some of the best areas in WoW. Blackrock Depths. Ironforge. I even liked the random dwarf bunkers scattered throughout the world. Instead I remember it being a mostly empty dump with lots of dragons and random critters. I remember the lame segment where you fly on the back of a dragon and AOE bomb mobs.
---
I remember Naxx geared rogues one shotting me with a sinister strike... 
---
Wow I had no idea about the wool part...
---
&gt; classic
---
hehe
---
\&gt;  Classic WoW won't survive without a new revenue stream 
---
They are charging a full subscription every month for a 14y old game...
---
That didn't stop them from implementing pets and mounts / max levels on retail.
---
Acti-blizz is always hungry for more. 
---
No they are not better. Druids take more damage (my feeling as a healer) and don't have disarm, shield wall and aoe taunt.
---
They are very good though and can tank all dungeons and their large healthpool is nice. But I would not say they are better than a warrior.
---
Druids are good tanks if you know what gear you should use and so on, what things you can farm to improve your performance and more. In raids things change but for some bosses they can MT or can be used to tank one of the ads.

---
&gt; Most guilds required first aid, to say otherwise is silly.
---
I think you just conceded this argument.
---
Just because everyone who was in a raiding guild knew it, does not mean the average scrub knew it. The skill floor in vanilla was *way* low.
---
Love the look of Undead Warrior :)
---
Developing classic wow probably doesn't cost much, so they are already making a shitload of profit.
---
My recommendation is unless you are really committed to the idea don't play a Druid. They are not the best class. So many reasons not to play one unless thats your "dream" I just wouldn't go there. They are the least popular class for a reason. 
---
*half of the group leaves after Rend*
---
&gt; sit-critting
---
Legit question. What you are referring too here?
---
I know sitting could cause a crit against a player in real vanilla, I used it on a pally to gain reckoning stacks. Or is there some way that private servers handle sitting in combat that is different than Vanilla? 
---
Not better however it is better to gear your resto druid as a feral tank since rdruids blow at low gear levels.
---
Well I took your advice and went onto a Instant 60 server, and I have now decided im going to main a Rogue.
---
Happened in vanilla for me. It was usually due to raid schedule conflicts. two guilds (or more) starting around the same time. Guilds would learn the schedule and decide to alter or embrace the weekly battles.
---
If raiding is off the table then best doesn’t matter.
---
A competent Druid will be able to tank any 5 man.
---
Eh, you tried.
---
&gt; was in part due to limitations of the server rather than the game 
---
This is simply misinformation. On a Classicast interview an original Vanilla WoW dev stated that the ~2.5k population was a design decision from the very beginning.
---
The size of the zones, spawn rates, drop rates, absolutely everything around the game was designed around this population size.
---
He is spreading misinformation. The ~2.5k population was a design decision from the very beginning, not a technology compromise.
---
Everything about the game from the zones to the drop rates were designed around this population in mind.
---
Source: The Classicast and other interviews with original Vanilla WoW devs Mark Kern and Kevin Jordan.
---
Thanks for the clarification ^^ its been so damn long LOL. 
---
Makes sense actually that he would yell that as you send him into battle rather than summoning him. 
---
I guess my wording is off. But im just shooting out something. And its fine if you dont like them, what i hoped for was anyones ideas on what could happen later in classic wow. 
---
But boy oh boy, you are some very hostile and insecure lads. 
---
Hard part for horde was every server always had far more alliance players than horde, because they just had more mass appeal by appearing more tolkien and "mary sue" bland "good guys".  Having certain racials and paladins with little to no skill floor meant pve was also al ot easier, too.
---
When big fights broke out, horde generally *knew* they had to team up and coordinate to win since they were always outnumbered. 
---
Thinking about it now, ironically the Horde may have been more descriptive of the alliance just by how many more players they had and how people love the character concept of the righteous paladin archetype.
---
I think it's fair to say that druids are better dungeon tanks pre-60. Which is probably bad game design but, that's vanilla WoW for you.
---
The three critical things warriors have that make them the only viable endgame tank are (1) the ability to avoid crushing blows, (2) the ability to deal with fear and (3) multiple redundant taunts for bosses that need a taunt switch. None of those are critical in pre-60 dungeons though.
---
What tends to matter in pre-60 dungeons is keeping big packs of mobs off the healer, and druids can do this very well by running in with a HOT ticking and swiping like mad.
---
About the only thing warriors can do in pre-60 content which druids can't is pummel a caster mob to reposition it, unless I am forgetting something.
---
Warriors or druids can both tank everything pre-60 just fine with proper gear/talents/skill though, and you will rarely be in a position to be choosy about your tank. 
---
i guess we talk about the same server, on horde side yesterday 1 was on ah, and it was 250 :p
---
Your racist post is assuming the worst given literally zero sauce.
---
Being a stealth class and picking half-afk players off in towns or cities literally never gets old.
---
druid is better at everything tanking related than warrior except for damage mitigation, which happens to be the most important thing
---
so unless healing mana/power is the bottleneck they are the best, which includes overgeared raidtiers
---
It is the best way because it is desirable for most of the future improvements done to the GUI and addon API to be distributed to both Retail and Classic. Easier to maintain.
---
I actually did say this in another commnet, but should have written it in the post, this is more of a "secondary farm to do once in a while" that gives a bit more gold then main farm/hour. It's oboiusly not something that will work if many people do it on the server or if its the only farm u do yourself.
---
the hyjal portal in southern winterspring always drove me crazy.  the area even seems like a pre-instance instance with the elites everywhere.
---
**&lt; Filthy Casuals &gt;  \[A\]  US-PVP**
---
Hey everyone! 
---
We are an alliance based guild that wants to remain relevant through the lifespan of WoW Classic. We are looking for players who want to focus on the community aspect of the game as well as clearing content. We are not a hardcore guild by any means. I would put us in the category of "Semi Casual". 
---
Our objective is simple it is to work together, clear content and get the hell out so people can have their own lives. We know that everyone is an adult now with responsibilities for the most part so we will NEVER keep anyone longer than official raid end. If we finish early we will encourage people to work on consumable farming or just hanging out with the guild but it wont be mandatory. 
---
Additionally since we are semi casual and not extremely hardcore we don't expect everyone to min / max and use every cookie cutter spec out there. We want you to have fun while raiding and not get burnt out. We will try our absolute best to allow people to change specs / change roles and still raid. With that being said, we still expect people to do their role in raids and help us clear as fast as possible so we can GTFO. 
---
Something I should have mentioned maybe is that all of our officers and most members so far have PLENTY of WoW Classic experience either private server or just remembering from 2004. 
---
**Raid Times (PST):** 
---
* Monday - Off
---
* Tuesday - Off
---
* Wednesday - 8PM - 11PM
---
* Thursday - 8PM - 11PM
---
* Friday - Casually 8PM - Whenever (What does this mean)
---
* Saturday - 8PM - 11PM
---
* Sunday - Off
---
Our Friday raids will be official off nights. This is when we as a guild form up groups to do dungeons,  pre-made BGs, or anything else the guild may need help with. Need to do a Paladin / Necro Epic mount quest? This is your night. Need to farm materials for raids, but don't want to do it alone? This is your night. This is the night we go out of our way to help others in the guild and build relationships.
---
**Loot Rules:**
---
While we've looked into many other systems we have decided that we will be a DKP based guild. Randoming a raid of 40 people just isn't a fair system. Loot council can ultimately be made fair, but I don't want people to think officers or people placed on the loot council are bias against or for someone else. Also with 40 people, loot council is a beast lol. So we are just doing the simple DKP system. Points per boss kill, bid on the items you want, top bid wins the item. No going negative DKP unless you're the only one bidding on the item. We haven't decided if we want to make it an Open bid or closed bid system yet. But we will keep everyone updated. If closed bid system is chosen we will be using a discord bot to remain 100% transparent as leaders. 
---
**Membership:**  
---
There will be 6 Ranks in Filthy Casuals.
---
* Recruit - Recruits are exactly what they seem. They will be on probation for 2 weeks and must make an effort into doing things with the guild to become full members at the end of that two weeks.  At the end of the two weeks, the officers will decide to promote to extend recruit status. Last priority on raid invites, and only can get loot that is going to be DE'd.
---
* Alt - Duh
---
* Member - These people are fully functional members of Filthy Casuals with no restrictions. If a member goes inactive for a period of time we will just place a note on them in the guild tab and move on. When they come back, its like they never left. 
---
* Raider - These are members who have put forth the effort to raiding. These people require at least 75% Raid Attendance to keep the rank of raider. That number may change later on we're not 100% sure yet. Literally the only perk that Raiders have over member is they are given priority on raid invites. This will benefit them more if we have a full 40 members every raid. 
---
* Officer - Currently we have 5 officers and we plan to keep it that way unless something unforeseen arises. We will get no special treatment other than raid spots for our mains. We have all known each other for 12+ years and want to ensure that the classic experience is great for members of our guild. 
---
* GM - Me.. I don't do much, I just look pretty and stream while my officers do things for me. I will be the final say in any major decision but I do not run a dictatorship. I listen to EVERYONE and will try to do my best at leading a bunch of filthy casuals. 
---

yet another reason to never play a paladin
---
Whenever someone says 2k pop or 5k pop they don't mean anything else than currently online. Doesn't matter if half are EU half are NA, 2k online is 2k online. A server with 1k online is a 1k server. There's way more players playing on a server than there is currently online.
---
I worried about having enough time hitting 60 before Naxx releases. 
---
I would say when everyone is fresh 60 and gearing up for Mc, bears are awesome. 
---
I rush through brt with no issues at all and that is where you want to be for you first bis items. 
---
But a bear will never be as good in 5 men VS a thunderfury warrior. 
---
That weapon is downright dirty.
---
Controversial, the fastest tank for ubrs was our prot paladin, if you let the mobs hit him 1 time, everyone can just aoe and murder everyone. 
---
Everyone wanted to do ubrs with this maniac. 
---
A well-played warrior is better.  More Oh Shit tools(shield wall, reckoning, etc), fear and kiting when things get ugly, pots, shield bash, second taunt, second charge, better damage reduction, higher DPS.  But mind you that's a well-played warrior, most warriors are awful at tanking and have trouble just keeping the mobs on them.
---
Druids have a few advantages: Better mobility, easier ranged pulling,    easier aggro abilities, the ability to pop of bear to heal the healer if they have all the aggro(though few druids do this, it's very odd), etc.
---
When it comes to pugs, I'll take a random druid over a random warrior any day of the week.  Even poorly played druids tank about as well as average warriors.  At the end of the day, all I want from my dungeon groups is a nice smooth run and druids are fine at that.
---
this entrance looked like this all the time for me in vanilla and I played on a PVE server during vanilla. Crossroads/ratchet &amp; TM/SS always looked worse though. Especially before BG's were out.
---
Yep, saving 4 of my personals for when classic drops. So 6 uninterupped days of powerleveling. 
---
I'm just making an argument thats about as compelling as his own. Based on my own anecdotal experience, everyone had first aid. Thus we are at a stand still in the argument.
---
100%, desperate for them to announce dates so can get it booked, already making notes of snacks and supplies and rough plans, the hype is real 
---
Horde equivalent to this tip about Menethil is Grom'gol.
---
No. Theres a lot of people that seem to think this because Druids are a lot easier to tank with in terms of skill. Bear threat generation is pretty good and very easy to use. Spam Maul, Swipe, throw in a Demo Roar now and then, Faerie Fire when you dont have rage. Warriors have a lot more options and a lot of warriors dont build threat very intelligently, so the % of bad warrior tanks is generally a lot higher than the % of bad Druid tanks. 
---
A Warrior thats actually awake and trying to tank can just as easily keep threat off DPS in 5 mans while taking less damage and having better options for regaining threat as well as surviving
---
I've got 210 hours of PTO in the bank, might as well use it for a week. Maybe two since I'll get another ~96 before launch.
---
&gt;To be fair, the first year of classic can't really be replicated without a fresh server.
---
Wow has always released fresh servers. They did throughout all of vanilla and they are still releasing fresh realms today. The difference is that they are released within the current timeline of path progression which obviously wouldnt work in Classic. Its a safe bet that they will release fresh realms periodically and that those realms will follow a progressive path line. It wouldnt make sense for them to release one batch and put in all the effort of remastering the game, only to lose their entire playerbase back to private servers who are releasing fresh. If they want to create revenue on their product, which is paid for by the userbase, they will need to create more value than that which is created by private servers.
---
I always wanted to check out the dragon isles, but they never made it into the game. Also the old hyjal had a dungeon entrance identical to onyxia's lair so I always wondered what that was meant to be.
---
fury fury prot shaman X :gachigasm:
---
PURELY subjective, I've both enjoyed the journey and the meeting stones. 
---
Two weeks probably - depending on launch dates! Maybe three weeks just to be able to chill in the summer
---
This happened to me in Vanilla all the time. We would have to meet up 3 0 mins before raid because Alliance knew our raid times. It was a bloodbath and I loved it. Once I got my epic mount it wasn’t so bad but man, those first several weeks at cap, that was the death march.
---
Im really looking forward to classic specifically for this. I was thinking that I’m  not going to play rogue though as I’ve mained one since launch, but now I might because it’s so much damn fun! 
---
Scratch the OT, make that a defensive BM hunter pet.
---
But paladins couldn’t tank back then, could not hold agro, member?
---
Why the furys? They don't really help the MT. 
---
Following your logics, scholls should be selling weed in the cantina - to circumvent dealers and snatch that revenue. The kids will be able to get it, so why not? Because by selling the gold directly, you are legitimizing goldselling, an activity which is bad for the game and should remain a ban-able offence.
---
But you have to bring five ...
---
I said
---
1. MT
---
2. OT
---
3. Warlock (Imp)
---
4. ???
---
5. ???
---
So why scratch the OT, and not just add the BM Hunter?
---
don't bother posting stuff like this here the blizzard drones won't take it lightly 
---
All else being equal, no: warriors are better tanks. However, a stud who is specced for and geared for tanking will probably tank better than the average fury or arms warrior who thinks equipping a shield is all it takes to tank. A druid who wants to tank is also probably the type of person who will go above and beyond to be good at his role, because it's certainly easier to just dps.
---
Feral spec druids do have one big advantage over even protection warriors: as offtanks a bear tank can switch to cat form and dps when his tanked mob is killed.
---
Paladins were the king of AoE aggro hold in TBC - they generated based on BEING hit, so you just spike-adin everything.
---
Why bad for raiding?
---
Yikes
---
would just make for a quick 5 man group.  
---
warriors all benefit from windfury and furies help keep ripped mobs in cleave range while shaman chainheal keeps everyone alive.
---
The frame probably costs more than the cards
---
I'm not advocating for blizzard to do or not do something, im merely explaining the mindset behind an answer to the OPs question
---
How is "everyone else greeds, mage needs" any harder to do than "everyone else passes, mage greeds"?
---
I'm playing on a TBC private server with 5-6k during peak times and I think its just too much. Yeah the world is alive but it's not fun to do quests with 10 other people. I would prefer the original 2.5k, if it has to be more then 4k at the absolute max imo.
---
It isn't a technically issue, it's a policy driven issue. 
---
"Fury is the only relevant spec until Mortal Strike" 
---
For acting like such a pompous know it all, I am surprised you would say something so wrong.
---
Arms is great for leveling starting from level 10. Many high skilled players level as arms so they can have tactical mastery and actually stand up to gankers. Arms is only slightly slower than fury pre mortal strike and only when abusing sit-crits. The ability to survive in pvp while leveling is way more valuable than killing a mob a few seconds faster.
---
Stop being an ass hole. You dont even know what you are talking about.
---
All group are 5 men, so I don't understand what you are implying. 
---
Other healers would also heal the tank. 
---
Happened all the time on retail on my server. STV and SouthShore used to be the same way before BGs were added. 
---
This is incorrect use for this scenario. Here we are interested in average expected returns over time. If you kill the mob 5 times an hour for 20 hours that's 100 kills. At 14 % drop rate the expected number of drops is 14. Every 1 hour spent (5 kills), your expected average return is 0.7 drops. His original numbers are good. 
---
Mayne tps is comparable if they are able to use Mortal Strike. But that means wasting a debuff slot and exposing yourself as someone trying to tank in Arms.
---
Well wow classic is vanilla, they haven’t made any plans to roll TBC out as of yet.
---
**&lt;No Plan Required&gt;** is an EU Alliance guild that intends to roll on a PvP server.
---
If you're looking for a relaxed raiding environment with a pinch of competition involved, or a social enclave to hide from your severe depression, then you've hit the jackpot.

I have clients which is considered work (even though it's just a few hours a week), but I took 2 years off starting last month. Relax for a few months to get my brain together and then play classic religiously.
---
Kill the ones called Winterfall in Winterspring. 
---
Two weeks, downloaded a private server for the first time. Leveling a shaman blind to enjoy it. Maybe I make one more run making notes. After that look up some vids and two weeks of power leveling 
---
Tbc? :o
---
&gt; The whole point of the wow token is to circumvent gold sellers
---
Wrong.
---
The whole point of the token is to make Blizzard earn 5$ more for each sub paid with gold (even more than that for multiple months at a time since you don't get discounts with the token like you do with real money).
---
It does *nothing* against gold sellers nor spam nor selling runs for real money (check the state of retail).
---
Better in what way? Can they succeed in tanking non raid content..sure. 
---
Personally I hated healing bear druids as an undergeared healer. Too much hp and they take noticeably a lot more damage. 
---
Agreed. At least, this was my experience when I played and raided Vanilla as I did not play on a PvP server. Though maybe I'm a buzzkill in saying I don't regret it. Though all these stories are pretty awesome as well as funny!
---
I’ve been having a hard time finding a site that lets me look at the loot in dungeons 
---
Warriors have no +hit talents. 
---
Hell yeah. One week off. Better do it before all your nerd co workers do it before you
---
LUL You sure got them upvotes
---
Didn't you try this thread yesterday?
---
Fuck off.
---
Yup. Not exactly sure of the breakdown of days yet, and it will depend on the exact release date. But I will definitely be using at least 5 days of vacation so I can be a slob for a bit.
---
i'm allowed to post the video just without information downunder? feelsKindaBad spent quite some time on making it.
---
Yeah you can dispel buffs, off an enemy player but as far as I know they are incapable of dispelling a debuff on themselves or their allies. "Horde have shamans to purge warlock spells. " is what you said, but I don't understand that sentence considering the shaman cannot dispel corruption etc that you would put on them as a warlock.
---
I only see one
---
My thoughts are you’re an idiot
---
Kargath*
---
It depends if windfury procs or not
---
Kargath doesn't give you easy travel access to most places, including 2 blimps
---
There will obviously be the usual server types.
---
PvP, PvE, RP, RP-PvP
---
Warrior has a lot more fun potential when doing 5men content when the warrior himself isnt farming preBiS gear anymore but helping new guildies gearing.
---
A 9%hit, rest tank items, 2hander warrior will be able to  tank just fine stratholme UD/live, UBRS until arena etc. and it's incredible fun. Cleaving 24/7 at constant 100rage in a fury/prot build is something to behold.
---
if you think a rogue is around, create a campfire and stand with your back to it. A rogue will un-stealth themselves on the camp fire damage if they try to open on you
---
I think a large part of the appeal of classic is the levelling experience. Personally I think it would undermine it significantly. Where they go in the future we can only speculate on, but I think the community who will be still playing classic 3 months after it comes out would be very resistant to your ideas.
---
its irrelevant, you didn't make any proper argument  
---
you just act like a sperg   
---
I mean the first part not the attendance part, I think expecting people to attend 90% of raids is pretty unrealistic when people have real life responsibility’s 
---
Didn't we literally get confirmation that it, in fact, ***WON'T*** make it into classic? Or did I misunderstand something?
---
Spirit is the most valuable stat when leveling a warrior and strength is overrated. 
---
Spirit increases hp/s exponentially, which means every spirit point is worth more than the previous, and it can result in little or no downtime.
---
Also, troll warriors are really underrated (atleast for leveling). The regeneration passive is often neglected or ridiculed. Over a fight you easily regenerate 5% of your health with the regeneration passive, which means it's a more valuable passive than the Taurens 5% extra health. Atleast when leveling.
---
Investing in spirit, especially if you're a troll (as it compliments their passive), will make the warrior leveling process much better.
---
Shaman cons: Totems.
---
They're annoying to have to recast all the time and you have to recast them to avoid pulling trash patrols behind the group.
---
But you will be in high demand if you can tolerate playing shaman. Dungeon groups love having you as the healer and raid groups will happily use 6 of them. 
---
Druids, not so much, many dungeon groups will not want to take you as a healer because you lack the res. In raids, there will be 3 druid spots maximum but that also means you will gear up very quickly. 
---
The same is true for PvP, you can fit 2 shamans in a premade but only 1 druid. And that druid would be specced for flag carrying. 
---
TLDR: your life will be easier as a shaman than a druid but you will have more competition for gear and have to deal with annoying totem mechanics.  
---
No, but your warrior will have things that reset auto attack, I'm pretty sure hearthstone does.  I think slam is sorta a physical spell and doesn't have the flag that makes "this spell not reset autoattack" (basically the "somatic component").  Slam is the more universally common approach, where casting something resets autoattack to max time-to-swing.
---
fishing
---
Thanks a lot for the thoughtful answer and sharing your experience!!!
---
From what I've heard, warriors actually get problems in lower end content as their gear improves, they get hit less and generate much less rage which in turn makes it harder to generate threat.
---
dungeon group *
---
Ummmm, when was the last fresh retail server?
---
One of us is going crazy here but I have no recollection of  fresh retail server for about 10 years. There *might* be one for new language they added but I'm 99% sure they've not added an English/French/German realm since WOTLK.
---
Real assassins use key binds
---
You completely misinterpreted point 1. I literally meant you don't get to see your gear in forms.
---
"No."
---
You would need the AV turn ins. 
---
This is the exact kind of feedback I'm looking for. Thanks!
---
Thanks for the feedback

---
Sheeping a mob is hardly rocket science.
---
With a good mage nobody else will even have to think about it, by the time the tank wants to pull the next pack sheep will already be cast.
---
but Cata did frame us all :P
---
Most people, as in the same most people who didn't see a raid? And wouldn't care or know of mods maybe. dbm, treat and dps meters where mandatory for most raiding guilds in vanilla, there was many more mods available in the early days, having mods at launch can not be compared to nax or bgs at all...
---
Il be installing bartender, one bag, mail addons ext ASAP.
---
Once beta goes live you are a fool if you think mods will not be prepared ready for launch
---
I simply won't have the time in the foreseeable future to ever adequately gear two characters, much less level. Sure, years down the road I could get a second one, but none of the content would even be relevant at that time.
---
It super depends on when in the week it comes out.
---
* If Tuesday, no time off
---
* If Monday/Friday. Ill take that day off
---
And either way let my wife know I will be gaming a lot the first 2 weekends and will go easier form that point on.
---
Druids are an amazing class. It's obvious you didn't read the post.
---
[Here](https://i.imgur.com/R5YqMUB.jpg)
---
What do you do that gains you so much time off?
---
Be the same level as the majority of people leveling. Go to STV. Then complain about what's expected to happen
---
But that was also possible with just strat/scholo gear back in the day with an arcane power build.
---
the most gameplay you get in massively multiplayer games is always from the other players - whether playing cooperative with them or competively against them.  
---
ensuring more players have more things to do - in this case CC - is more interesting because you have to coordinate and work together and that is gameplay.
---
running from one end of a dungeon to the other pushing your own rotation and only paying attention to what the MOBS (computer) are doing is BORING.  having to pay attention to what the other PLAYERS are doing is more engaging and interesting.
---
So be it. It's a better solution than constantly losing players until mergers are needed any ways. 
---
AQ trash, especially on the way to the Twin Emps, felt like a boss in itself.
---
While leveling, make sure to run level appropriate dungeons as you level up - the sweet new weapons/armor can really make the next few levels of questing much less painful. 
---
Also, do NOT get hung up on trying to acquire a certain rare piece of gear from a particular dungeon and wind up running the same dungeon a dozen times...you'll sometimes find that when you actually get that awesome level 28 sword, you're already level 36 from all the time it took to get it.
---
Once you hit 55ish, that's a different story; run the shit out of the top tier dungeons and start building your BiS pre-raid set.
---
Can confirm TBC Prot Pally AoE tank supremacy. Way more threat gen than my Warrior and Bear counterparts, but a bit less (not all *that* much less) survivability/damage mitigation. As far as itemization, you just lose your main hand weapon for a spell power caster mace or similar and you are good to go.
---
Just know your role as the best tank for packs of small mobs as opposed to one big mob. You can tank folks like Gruul in a pinch, but it's not your best use case.
---
Then non-raiders can't see the new content and get absolutely shit on in PvP. 
---
&gt;once you hit level 34 and get 5/5 reckoning, you literally have one of the fastest kill speeds of any class
---
Maybe with a bugged private server. In Vanilla (and the classic demo), sit crits don't proc Reckoning or similarly proc'ed abilities.
---
Hoping for a 4k cap to allow wpvp as a good method for ranking!
---
Im scared to have 2,5 k population cap and to see that drop to 1k or less...
---
Hyjal and Caverns of Time. Actually getting into those areas was amazing. Even though they weren't done, the existing assets galvanized the imagination.
---
That's the plan.
---
Buy the biggest bags you can afford.
---
Id like to know too!
---
Big, if true.
---
It would certainly make the landscape look more epic after PvP
---
Yeah, I was the MT for a raid guild post TBC, however I had to yield the floor to our Warrior OT for certain hard-hitting bosses.  In general, Prot Pallys can help speed up clear rate on trash mobs, however - as long as you don't go TOO crazy and pull too many mobs.  
---
Ultimately, TBC saw a renaissance for tanks - each of the three had use and purpose across the board.
---
The first point is fair, but go on a server where people are in AQ40 and Naxx and new players will get shit on in PVP there too.
---
Yeah, it does suck but an extra swing or two can change the outcome of the fight. Again, use at your own risk Righteous warriors! 
---
Sorry but I will have to disagree but that’s me. And I have a hard feeling they will be doing some cheeky changes but I also will not being playing the live server. I’m excited to see what it can be. But I know it’s to many changes for my liking:) but I really hope the company does do what makes fans happy and the most money. I wanna see blizzard out of this slope 
---
Yeah, although we’ve seen them go back on things before so fingers crossed.
---
You couldn't get Reckoning in the demo, it only went up to level 19.
---
No it lasts the full duration iirc, so poly lasts for like 45 seconds on first cast.
---
&gt;Not the content tho. Also because blizzard doesn't wanna put resources in applying changes per patch like original game did. 
---
The content is all using 1.12.1 itemization and balance, the only difference is they're doing an artificial content gate.
---
&gt;Nah, Lolten always had way more. Also the reason for that was the pserver boom that happened with WotLK so there was just way too many of them and they were all trash. If you only have shit to compare to, mud will be viewed highly. 
---
lmao molten's population has always been under speculation, they've had the same pop as nost had for years yet their servers felt like a regular pop server.
---
&gt;So the only faults you can name is something that does not have anything to do with massive pop but rather poor hardware? 
---
You can only throw so much hardware at poorly optimized software before hitting diminishing returns. If every single server has lag/poor render distance with higher pop that doesn't really indicate hardware issues (unless every server is using the same host).
---
&gt;The only thing that could not handle more players was spawn rates and servers.
---
How can you handle more players? Dynamic respawn isn't really a optimal solution as it ends up damaging other aspects of the game (having mobs spawn to fast, screws up the economy etc.)
---
&gt;Actually, it does. If you create fewer servers but with bigger caps it will make sure they stay healthier after tourists are gone. If you make low cap and make a bunch of servers then they will obviously fall low since population gets too spread.
---
No reason to have to merge servers when you can prevent such situation from happening for a long time. 
---
So your solution is to have servers filled to the brim at launch, have it be an absolute shit show all in the hopes that they'll eventually even themselves out? 
---
Blizzard has no idea how many people are going to be playing the game at release, they run the risk of having not enough servers for everyone or too many. You're not going to fill every server evenly even if you have a high pop capability. Some are just going to be low population, it's just the way it works.
---
I wouldn’t go as far as keeping spare gear but i will most likely do this with my guild/friends in classic.
---
As i said I’m not in favour of the loot trading so i will be using it to my advantage.
