But that's the best part! We must pass this to a new generation! lol

Tip:  Type "druid macro" into the search box.
---
I've read horror stories on this sub where the name was instantly taken, not sure if there are bots trying names. My character "Dawn" survived the recreation at 4 am.
---
Hunter
---
It's probably misleading because there is no real "hacking" involved.
---
Around 20min
---
Agreed. Mix the pets with the magic
---
Grim released his movie where he fights Sommerfuglen (Thinks that is his name) so ofc i kept spamming sommer with ”WHERE U RUNNING” to the point where i never got into his group again during BWL progress, i dont think he liked me very much after that
---
Apologies if my goal is have a discussion instead of just see who can have the best *gotcha* responses.
---

---
&gt; Last response.
---
Thank God. Take your "suggestions" of making Classic not Classic with you.
---
Really bgs were on the stress test why won't they be on launch?
---
How TF could they allow so many people to sign up and not cap it at some point. There must be like 80k players on that server.
---
Reminds me of struggling in Dark Souls with the area that has all the ghosts because I never thought to use the item that curses you . . . because why would anyone curse themselves?
---
That was done by many during beta and the last stress test. Those are over now until launch as far as I know.
---
Unrelated: How do I delete someone else's post on Reddit?
---
If you want to "tryhard" shouldn't you "tryhard" to find your own quests/quest items? 
---
Jk (but not really)
---
Girl?
---
Gank in terms of gaming is generally kill someone in an underhanded way, which a lowbie being killed is. Doesn't need to be repeated multiple times.
---
I like blind bid dkp
---
yeah this was like Blizz pulling a Nintendo, purposefully create small batches to increase hype and create fake scarcity. Works every time, can't find an SNES classic because none are in stock, can't find a Switch when they came out because they can't keep them stocked
---
Blizz is learningggggg or being effected by Activision or both.
---
and if they had made 10 of each server, things would be evenly spaced and you'd have people complaining that it's going to be dead at launch lmao
---
Can't please anyone, so this is the route they chose.
---
/speculation
---
Alt tab out, open browser, go to Google translate, type in instructions, copy paste in to chat.
---
Problem solved
---
The people on Herod picked it because their options at the time were the streamer server, the Portuguese server, or Herod.
---
Do the grind for Bloodsail and Steamwheedle exalted at the same time :D
---
Why gimp yourself not using charge? With a few points in tactical mastery you can get good range to demo shout and without tactical mastery you can thunderclap and go into d stance. It's easy to macro the stance swaps too.
---
2h fury is the best leveling spec until 40+.
---
Sitting down pre combat, taking a hit to trigger the procs, then destroying the mob.
---
It is an easy algorithm but afaik they never announced how they’re doing it. Their rhetoric on the classic forum posts makes it look like they’re just counting total character count per server for a rough estimate.
---
I'm thinking EPGP for my guild. I want to find a way that everyone feels their time and effort is rewarded. I don't like the idea of policing who gets what, even though I know it will hinder progress. I'd rather everyone was just having a good time.
---
I would never be in a guild that didn't use raid council.
---
That is a common complaint with retail WoW - sensory overload. It's just too much in your face. Classic WoW gives you a completely open world but throws nothing in your face. The narrator at the beginning hypes you up for your roll in the world, but after that you are on your own buddy. Make your own kind of music.
---
&gt; You are asking [insert numerous, divergent group] to not discriminate
---
 - person who proceeds to discriminate.
---
theres an amazing Blaumeux waifu on the Blaumeux discord right now
---
funny thing is everyone is now going here so i would not be surprised if it ends up being overpopulated as well
---
If it was just ok then go ahead and try out the hunter. If you want a mystical style toon with pets then there is always the warlock lol. All three choices would be nice for solo play. Especially the hunter and warlock since they do have pets
---
So is it a book on writing LUA?
---
I dunno, but it had no consequences for the ones doing it. And I am not the only one who has experienced this.
---
Hmm really? I could be wrong. Regardless it more or less developed around the same sphere.
---
Oh shit you're close! I'm next to old Turner field!
---
AAAAAGH, AUGH AUGH
---
Clever!
---
I reserved my names but that's it.  No expectation I'm going to level in a timely manner that first week.
---
Favorite: Loot council where everyone on the council is a a longtime friend of mine.
---
2nd favorite: DKP with reserved items for main tank.  As long as everything is transparent and you prevent dumb shit like hunters trying to get a thunderfury then it's honestly the best way to go.
---
NO BRAKES!!!
---
[removed]
---
Unfortunately no. You’ll have to do it on launch.
---
Ah, we all have to learn one way or another. Way better to find a girl that likes you for who you are instead of a girl you feel like you need to impress anyway.
---
God what a perfect specimen he is
---
What you mean? At the very least it gives us all free months of subscription?
---
Do a pros, cons list. I'll get you started.
---
Hunters: Best levellers, Underpopulated as a class (few of them), best class in pvp at fighting max range/kiting, very good dps early patches, high dps can compensate for lack of skill.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Cons: DPS falls off late in classic, versus the very best players you will struggle.
---
Mages: Good AOE levellers, free food, city portals, one of the best dps, one of the best pvp classes, will not fall off as classic progresses.
---
Cons: Incredibly overpopulated (good luck getting group/loot), requires a lot of skill to be proficient at pvp with.
---
Definitely Hunter or Warlock. They’re both really fun for solo play.
---
It’s in the content patch. Original wow didn’t have battlegrounds in it, and once they did it was only WSG and AV. Arathi Basin will also arrive in a later phase.. I think 5 but could be wrong on that one.
---
The honor system isn’t being added til phase 2, so in phase 1 (MC/Ony) - PVP is just for fun.
---
No worries at all, I normally take everything on Reddit with a huge grain of salt anyways. I appreciate you saying that though, most people on here wouldn't.
---
I had a ton of fun in vanilla content during bc playing a frost mage, a bit dependant on a high stamina build but really satisfying mowing down a large group of (melee) monsters.
---
Hunter is good for solo play since it has a little helper with them at all times but it does require bullets/arrows and food for the pet.
---
Who looks for their adoptive daughter when you can play some homeless dude in Gwent to get those sweet ass cards?
---
Red = Dead
---
 I walk you through the theorycrafting, explain the math, and then you calculate a rogue timing backstab with every FH to refute me. You then completely ignore the math done (which accounted for 4 melees getting Howl), and say: 
---
&gt;"...your math looks good, but wrong things don't become true, just because you put some statistic data next to it."
---
I literally don't know another way to theorycraft. Don't forget to not vote in your next election.
---
Correct. But not all. I think people are missing the wording there
---
The new 60 content they have hinted at makes me so happy. Yes i want to experience all of the raids that i never had a chance to on retail vanilla - but the fact they are willing to consider adding more .... this is my viagra
---
My whole guild want to play PVE and I'm soo bummed by that decision. Glad to hear that blizzard is listening to the community here though
---
Haha, but you learned a valuable lesson at least ;)
---
RemindMe! 2 weeks
---
Never heard of it, thanks for the heads up!
---
The toxicity on the Classic forums is unbelieveable.
---
Use a beta sandbox, transfer files across folders (you will need to rename the folders)
---
This is your best bet.
---
I'm pretty sure it is. Anyway, I'd be surprised if it turns out to be a lot of non-English speaking on Firemaw. Seems to be mostly scandinavians so far and most of us are pretty decent at English.

Oh so it did work that way in vanilla tho?
---
... to Skeramistan!
---
Hehe, it was mostly a bad joke, I know you don't have to spend 23 hours a day in a gym to look like that :p
---
Bingo
---
When you do the math and you lose more personal dps from using a wolf than the raid gains from the choice, its suboptimal. It's like saying 2&gt;3 because I like 2 more.
---
You’re purposely taking the literal definition of the word when you know that’s not what it means in a gaming context lol
---
I've been following this sub religiously and haven't made a character or anything, I can't think of 6 people alongside me that are going to sign up lol it's going to be an absolute shit show
---
Mcdonalds
---
I'm a rogue, and the rules of engagement need not apply.
---
I know what that means. It means IT'S OVER 9,000!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Sheep, kite with blink, iceblock.
---
UK here. Golemagg.
---
Yeah that's my main worry. They should have a grace timer where the name is attached to your account for a certain amount of time after deleting.
---
Out.
---
And by the way, you don't want that
---
Great response 👍
---
Just thought I'd try to teach you something.  It's totally cool if you want to revel in your own ignorance though...
---
Where'd you get 45 from? Doesn't seem right to me
---
[https://i.redd.it/kolpcx1y5fg31.png](https://i.redd.it/kolpcx1y5fg31.png)
---
I appreciate the response.  Again, sorry and good luck to you.
---
It’s 8 hours a day. Hardcore guilds are getting 60 earlier than that. And it’s a goal, not a requirement. Many people are taking 4-6 weeks and that’s ok if they let us know that.
---
You should set foot on an NA server some time. I think you’d be surprised by what you see.
---
The Stalaggtites will always have the fraternal support of the Skeramistani.
---
Bite is not a focus dump. It has a 10 second cooldown.
---
YOU THINK YOU DO!!!!!!!!!!
---
(Sorry, has to be done again)
---
Its going to be unplayable for a few days anyways... hopefully by Friday night we can get in.
---
i wish lol
---
Sorry, I didn't understand all that. What do you mean made, ward, and mate?
---
Well now I'm just confused. You'll be playing Diablo: Immortal so what do you need Classic for?
---
Oh, MARTA, I miss thee.
---
Hunter seems like a perfect fit
---
No way the tourists last that long. And I’m not counting someone who comes from BFA and ends up loving classic as a tourist. That’s a convert. And they will
---
Can’t remember the story, but didn’t Henry Cavill miss a callback from a respected director or something after auditioning for a movie because he was playing WoW?
---
You think we will, but we won't.
---
This is what Classic is all about
---
Yeah I’m sure no one else will do that either...
---
Yeah i remember getting gatored by many a wetland reptile. The worst about stv is that you start dying by lvl 40 gorillas and it get progressively easier as you get close to duskwood. Except the part where every single horde will basically oneshot you
---
Classic wow is the same original wow that came out in 2005 that i loved before all the changes. I expect the release will be chaotic and some servers will have temporary issues. Yes there will be a lot of streamers at launch.
---
Yes the numbers will drop
---
I'm really curious how it's going to play out if classic is still very popular after all the phases are out.  I'm sure some people are going to want TBC.
---
Fuck...too true. My photography goals are taking a back seat this year lmao.
---
They need to be in human form to mine/fish but not herb/skin.  Soothe animal is useful for looting things near beasts since you can’t stealth and gather simultaneously.  Chests also can’t be looted in combat so hibernation/root won’t help there.
---
Tell them to ignore people that tell them how they should play the game. 
---
There's a lot of unique ways to min/max in classic because it depends heavily on what area of the game you want to maximize your effectiveness in.
---
I'm also not able to understand everyone thinking that Stalagg isn't going be full by some magic lol.
---
I think there will always be that community that doesn't want to pay, or wants a new "fresh", server mods or other expacs. Just going to be a much community most likely.
---
It would certainly help them, but you could still just sheep them or blink kite them until it wears off. I still don't think it would make those matchups harder than mage vs. spriest/warlock/feral though
---
yes sir
---
[https://discord.gg/njvvZPP](https://discord.gg/njvvZPP) just gunna put this here xx
---
I tried a RPPVP server in retail a few years back for the same reason.  It was alright but ultimately not for me.  Most of the guilds had RP events that I didn't like to go to so I sort of felt like an outsider even in my own guild.  RP is how a lot of guilds socialize on those servers.
---
I was just about to share this. PLEASE EVERYONE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD... WAIT UNTIL EVERYONE IS READY FOR GROUP ESCORT QUESTS OMG
---
Paying a sub is probably not an issue for the vast majority of people interested in WoW Classic.
---
Where can you download Add ons for classic? Through twitch?
---
Oh you know I’ve got this sorted but thank you for the announcement. I’m working from home Monday so that I can start early and get started a 3pm PDT.
---
One of those misconceptions I always had was that:
---
  
---
1. Rares always had a chance to drop something wild
---
2. Rares were always elites.
---
How wrong I was, only realised it after all these years because of these videos. Thanks man!
---
Do the servers show live if you are already logged in? Or do you have to log out and back in to see the server as live?
---
We hope so. Blizzard won’t release phase 2 until the population has stabilized and layering is no longer required.
---
There'll be a fresh TBCs and WotlKs in 6 months that will be massive.
---
It's like fishing, but with swords and fire!
---
&gt; did Blizzard revamp the original game
---
Every expansion release basically invalidated / replaced everything that existed in the game up to that point, not to mention the myriad changes to classes and other innate game systems.
---
So yeah, we're going back to the basics that much more closely resembles the MMOs of yore instead of the action game that retail is today.
---
Staaaaahp. I want to be uncontested for the first fishing extravaganza D:
---
Any Korean guilds plan on setting up on this pvp server? My wife and I plan on rolling here (not sure alliance or horde yet)
---
My first was born at the end of vanilla/start of BC. He just lost 20k gold gambling with me on the weekend. Sucker!
---
Those countries typically have small playerbases/communities in comparison to others and wont take over/interfere with the server in general tbh. IF they do at all
---
why would you leave your home?
---
Amazing.
---
I think the players that have reached max on private servers are looking to grind and flex there meta on a new server full of new players, but the players that are dedicated to playing on that server probably will play eventually because it is free. Or classic is the end-all of private servers guess we will see.
---
No one is trying to say anything definitive. The evidence is making the "you don't but you do" speech look more and more absurd. That's just true.  
---
The fact they released classic at all after that speech makes it look absurd. Underestimating the needed number of realms and adding 3 more in the span of a week because realms are going full during the character naming window is just laughable. I'm glad they are actually adding servers though, good on em.
---
Yes you have always been able to Shadowmeld on CC to avoid it. It was very popular in wotlk when they removed the out of combat requirement.
---
Method doesn't stand a chance in hell lmao
---
the 1600 is including the hordes :D but it seems like the horde now follows
---
Super cool infographic, but a lot of the weapon choices are pretty rough. Stuff like Limb Cleaver is just way too fast a weapon speed to be a very good Arms weapon. Whirlwind axe is probably still better, but something like Stoneslayer or The Rockpounder available at level 44 are both crazy good 2h weapons even though they aren't axes. Gatorbite Axe is also super good on Orcs that can take you basically all the way to 60. Worth noting Ice Barbed Spear isn't going to be in the game for quite some time.
---
I don't think anyone is actually just scared of other languages existing. It is more the stereotype that follows Latin American players on live. 
---
Generally they are considered to be just terrible at wow, though it is likely that some confirmation bias is at play since you can easily spot a Latin American player by server name and are more likely to remember someone who doesn't speak English well/at all and happens to perform badly.
---
when ive been corpse camped, it has turned into an event. where i call my 60 friends and they call their friends and a war breaks out.  I remember walking to the store and buying some snacks and coming back to the same guy camping my corpse.   this was like 14 years ago and i still remember that.  Was i mad at the time? ya sure.  but looking back its pretty funny that someone waited 40 minutes for me while i wasnt even home.
---
I did exactly this at end of vanilla/start of BC and mid wotlk when mine were born! works a treat
---
1. Its almost 1:1 the latest version of WoW before the first addon came out
---
2. Thats correct
---
3. Beside heavy waiting queues to get online on the first... lets say 0-72 hours after release, nothing. This is the game many WoW players have been waiting Y E A R S for.
---
Lol you just gotta use those deviates and turn into a pirate!
---
This and then google wow Classic announcement reactions, for the feels!
---
Arcanite Reaper Hoooo!
---
Ninja
---
Nope, no balance adjustments, get over it.
---
Alliance has a slight advantage in PvE
---
Horde has a slight advantage in PvP
---
Dwarf fear-ward for onxyia is amazing
---
Will of the forsaken for undead is amazing
---
Blessing of salvation is amazing
---
Windfury is amazing
---
Perception is useless
---
Warstomp is amazing
---
What does this mean?
---
Just play what you want, both sides are going to PvP and PvE endlessly and do well. And both sides are going to gripe that the other side is greener. Alliance have paladins, Horde have Shamans, the QQ is as endless as the grains of sand in Silithus
---
Personally, as a warlock that generated mega aggro, it was a godsend having a skilled pally help assist my threat management
---
But as a warlock in pvp, i want each and every rogue to know you're a talentless hack with zero skill when you burn WotF in a 1v1 fight vs a warlock.
---
If you have a gear progression and God forbid some friends to play with, why would you grind green mobs giving, what is it 50-75 their normal XP?

This one is pretty cheap, but you have to have fishing or buy the raw fish.  It still sells at a profit even if you just buy the fish. 
---
https://vanillawowdb.com/?item=13932
---
This is a cheaper version of the hp/5 potion.  THere are stronger versions that do more but they will be a lot more expensive and are useful for raiding folks. 
---
https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=3388
---
Both were very cheap and attainable while leveling- I actually made it all myself as I was herb/alchemy (so I could just gather herbs + make potions) and I had cooking so I could buy the fish pretty cheap off of AH and cook it into the food, sell a few for profit and keep the rest for myself. 
---
Stack that with blood craze (hp regen when crit) and bloodthirst (hp regain upon successful melee hit) and you are constantly regen a ton of HP
---
Psh dual wield fury ftw for leveling. What are you even doing with your life?
---
You’re awesome! 👏🏻
---
You need an active sub to play classic.
---
Everyone has different experiences with people.
---
A lot of pserver community people had problems with the chinese, personally, i thought they were on the average besides the obvious language barrier.
---
I however had a lot of problems with russian players being absolutely awful. Perhaps a small sample size, but they were always astonishingly bad whenever i played with them.
---
Not much experience with spanish players, but the point is people just relate their experiences and try to avoid bad past experiences.
---
I see you too play hunter
---
Rend doesn't replace your swing Heroic does. You're losing out on damage if you're not using Rend in the early levels.
---
Method &gt;&gt;&gt;

Y'all are delusional if you think Classic wow's raids are hard compared to what Method destroying for the past 4 years.

---
Was a hardcore raider during vanilla, but that was over 12 years ago. 
---
If I roll dwarf but want to join some rl friends who are rolling human, after character creation I run to Ironforge, catch the tram to Stormwind, then run to the human starter area and level in that area will there be any negative repercussions (e.g some quests unavailable since I'm a dwarf in human starter area, fall behind on earning ironforge rep from not doing the dwarf starter area, etc)?
---
Thomas Bros in every car.
---
I dont get the idea that most people who try classic are gonna hate it and leave.  I certainly didnt see any of that during the stress tests, it stayed busy as heck.  The servers are full right now with people hype about classic before it's even out, who played the stress tests and liked what they played enough to sign up for the servers.
---
I dont know about you, but I wanted classic servers because I think old wow is much better and more rewarding, and I think people will like what they play.  No mmo has been as addicting as classic wow was.
---
Private server guilds will get first clears on every raid, they have been clearing this content for years together. Method is only decent on retail.
---
Horde or alliance?
---
"You think you do but you don't."
---
"Most people will quit in the first week." &lt;------ You are here
---
"Classic WoW is more popular than retail."
---
It wasn't a ploy to get extra money, it was to gauge interest for launch. They're slowly adding servers as needed, which is the correct way to do things instead of opening too many and having a bunch of low-medium pop ones that no one outside of people that are completely new to MMO's will ever join.
---
Absolute legend!

This sub has gone next level fanboy and is now talking about giving blizzard alms....
---
Nice, thanks
---
Yeah I understand that.  I was hoping too as well, but it'd probably be a bad idea for blizz to reveal those numbers.  If servers get a rep for being horde dominated before they even release, then that's gonna stop a lot of potential alliance players from playing on that server and the same is true for the opposite.  We'd likely end up with servers being more lopsided towards horde or alliance than they would be if they just let players make a choice on their own.
---
You are delusional if you think method will beat people clearing this same content for years lol
---
F
---
Cool story.
---
Acting smug doesn't make you right.  In fact, it makes it even sadder considering how wrong you are.
---
Private server numbers have shown to be very inconsistent with reality and there’s a number of pathing and scripting irregularities on private servers as well.  I’d say they have actively HURT their knowledge of the game over the years by playing private servers.  Many of those players are not going to like the actual classic implementation they asked for.  #nochanges
---
That’s okay, thanks for the downvote friend.
---
I've thrown $7.50 - $8 away for far less than a name i like. If thats qll it takes to not have to play as xxshitname37xx then im happy to do it.
---
Are there any achievement addons for classic?
---
I have never played horde side im so excited
---
9 is amazing.  My personal best was only 4.
---
&gt; Y'all are delusional if you think Classic wow's raids are hard compared to what Method destroying for the past 4 years. 
---
nobody ever said that lmao
---
It's not because method does harder content that they would beat a private server game, there is so much to know about and it's not about skill only, it's mostly vanilla knowledge so method would lose
---
I dont care what the loot system is as long as its transparent and fair.
---
&gt; Every person with a current sub loses nothing by reserving names. 
---
They also gain nothing, and most refuse to play Classic. Not even 10% of the current name reserves are Retailers.Sure, at launch will be more, but we are already almost 2 million ressubed for name reserve.
---
We are actually LEGIONS. Already.
---
And more LEGIONS are coming. Many more.
---
You will see how many more realms are added AT LAUNCH, and you will understand how many we are.
---
Nah just get rid of Epic Flying. Going 60 will surely get people go taxi or walking 100. And hopping over big mountains instead of just flying to any place, unless u have time. And cancel flight when hit by a direct spell maybe. Just make it inefficient as hell. Or start with 40 + speed and get to 60 epic. With 80 when flying as a group with a paly. The more people the faster. Get to 100 when flying in party or something. Need to fly in flocks.
---
Herod will be worst queue, coming in behind it is likely Faerlina, then who knows for the others.  Stalagg would be lower in its current state, but bet your arse when this releases its getting a que as well.  Blizzard kinda hinted that even medium pop realms could see a queue early.  
---
Its going to be brutal early, they know it, we know it.  But they are doing the right thing by doing rolling server releases.  It sucks right now, but 6th months from now you will be thankful on a healthy population server.  I wouldnt be surprised to see twice the number of servers we started with by end of week one.
---
sounds like someone missed 420 today.

Make both, and then you'll gravitate towards one. You can have 2 more professions this way too!

so exited

I did it for the title and bragging rights on retail.
---
Never again.
---
So, from the account drop dow, does this indicate he has 3 accounts? Is Superman a multiboxer?
---
Go to Best Buy for the easiest option. Any computer in the store will run WoW. Some better than others.
---
I think so the epic Exalted rewards aren't available in PVE content. A fair reason.
---
Hunter belt for sure.
---
Someone be honest with me, is it gonna be lit as fuk ?
---
And get fire damage buff that is next to useless in MC
---
Reminds me of one of our tanks. Absolute beast of a player, plenty of server firsts and such. I think he played from Columbia. Miss ya Warrio!

Unbiased answer coming through, method not only has them selfs to lean on, but legions of fans willing to donate thousands of gold to there cause. GL

---
I will always choose to fap.... what was the question again?
---
I had very shitty gear and spent a huge amount of time in the mine because of that. A friend of mine hat raidgear and breezed through there everyday in a few minutes. Thanks to the eggs I was able to catch up.
---
The OOGA gang has confirmed they’re not doing anything on actual Classic it was all for the beta.  Sorry to burst your bubble.
---
&gt; officially going
---
Honestly I think people are being premature now 'officially' announcing anything. You can have an idea in mind, but were are now seeing a pattern, I don't think people should trying to decide on a server for definite at this point.
---
Mage
---
Amazing in PVE and PVP. Mages are also the fastest gold farmers in the game.
---
I thought you can't download the client without an active subscription?
---
&gt;5 million players could think they want it and start playing come launch, but in 3 months 100k players could remain.
---
I think using extreme examples, that are possible, but highly improbable, is not the way to do it.
---
What if I say the opposite : 5 million at launch, all got hooked, and bring their friends and we have 10 million Classic players in 3 months.
---
It is as possible as your scenario. But also as highly improbable.
---
I like them! I can imagine these being little info cards you get in a board game. Very nice to look at!
---
hey my wife tries to click on me the addon is on and i have things in the sell window and nothing opens on her end when she targets me
---
&gt;Particularly if someone like Joana can pull it off again.
---
Joana's gonna be like a full day or behind world first 60, if not more.
---
I thought that was after Phase 1? Layering should prevent the need for realm queuing.
---
- earl grey tea
---
- water 
---
- worthers caramel 
---
- Riesen candies 
---
- Skor toffee bars
---
To me. This is the only mmo. All the others fail so hard compared to vanilla wow. I just can’t wait to go back home.
---
Are you horde cause there us on Stalagg
---
According to that avoidstreamers site three are rolling on Shazz so yea, might not be the best server
---
That's a bit harsh bro lol, I know we are all itching for classic but damn. You know the age old saying,  you chose to click on it lol.
---
PREPARE... for the return of the best game ever made!
---
Rise, mortals! The age of love is at hand!
---
They're kind of drawing their own map as they go. You think you can just buy a map of Silithus at Lok'tar O'Mart?
---
... you can always play BFA?
---
Mostly I just planned some easy to prepare meals so we don't have to eat total junk but also don't have to spend a ton of time cooking. There will still be junk, thinking pizza for launch day but I am trying to keep it pretty typical otherwise. Going to stock up on our regular grocery supplies so any shopping trips can be shorter launch week.
---
I have been keeping an eye on addons I am interested in trying out. I probably won't use any right away, but I wanted to have a plan for when I get fed up with the standard UI haha.
---
Our internet has been super spotty so on the to-do list closer to launch is to make sure devices are all charged up for hotspot should it be necessary.
---
When has this ever been a good idea...
---
Do not stop maxing heroic strike
---
How have I never heard that? Amazing
---
Grob mob sweating silently
---
ok bro, do whatever you find is right...but i disagree :)
---
It would be too confusing because people would try to abbreviate the server as DM instead of VC.
---
Me and a buddy looking for an Alliance guild on Fairbanks. Looking for at least one raid day on Saturday as it is the day we both have off. I'll be resto druid and he is a rogue. Looking for casual guild as we both work full time. Other than that we are pretty open and both players since Vanilla.
---
I agree I think TBC/WotlK should be seperate servers with the ability to transfer your 60 Classic and then 70 TBC over so you keep the same character and don't restart level 1 each expansion.
---
Yup that's me. Stay at home dad with the baby lol
---
Part of me feels like Mike made him do it.
---
I can't predict the future and agree hunters were super popular the first time around, but according to every poll I've seen mages will be far more popular than hunters this time.
---
que?
---
It’s a leveling race. The raids are easy to any established guild.  It’s gonna come down to whichever guild has enough level 60s to actually start raiding first
---
Definitely feel this. My older brother quit playing around Cata and since we shared an account I've been sure to save all his characters. Showed him Classic and we'll be playing together again for the first time in like 8 years.
---
I once found my wife’s early Everquest map binder.  Now those were some dedicated players.
---
I’m not playing on launch day for this specific reason.  I’m not power leveling or going for anything other than playing causally at my own pace so it works for me.
---
get more creative names and that wont be a problem
---
Deadmines is hands down a better dungeon, imo. Not enough to roll ally though.
---
If only there was some way around these severe queues... If only.
---
That could also be very true. We'll just have to see. Maybe I am just projecting too much since I decided a server with the first batch and won't budge since everyone I want to play is gonna be on 1 server and we decided Shazzrah.
---
Cc chain. Interrupt. Purge. Lock down 1-2 targets, maybe have 1 healer keep you up its not hard at all.
---
DM belongs to DM
---
How was the steak?
---
TBC class design is god awful.
---
Yeah my Guild is rolling on Pagle, which is full ATM. I have a character on bloodsail and one on grobb I may have to ditch the Guild depending on the queues. Honestly I kind of want to play on an RP server anyway.
---
Im going as simple as i can.
---
Im going to use questie for obvious reasons
---
Dominos
---
Atlasloot classic
---
And im still looking for a map enhancer that can show me quest locations and stuff
---
And the people that leveled to 60 multiple times on private servers over years will be the clear winners
---
Then I sit corrected lol.
---
If half the people leave that puts you on a medium server for vanilla's standards and that will be noticeably harder to form pugs in than a server that is high or full by today's standards, and way past full by classic's.
---
I believe that's where people are coming from.
---
I don't think so, I thought that was the patch after they added idols.  Right before TBC when they gave Druids Treeform etc.  Worth looking into though.
---
3 layers? Do you even know that for CCU drop alone you need 4 layers? And for tourists another 2-3 layers? And for long term dropouts another 3-4 layers?
---
To ensure a healthy pop long term, every single realm that is high and full now will have 10 layers at launch AND queues.
---
It's basic math man.
---
i think i will but i want a couple years of classic atleast
---
Many of the recently updated add-ons also do not work.
---
Again, it's a nice idea but wasn't worth the frustration.
---
This is awesome as hell. You talented fucker!
---
Horde
---
No. It's 1 hour. Use this time to clean the filth from your body.
---
Bloodsail is still at medium. 
---
There are a lot of people who simply *do not* want to be part of our Nerd-dom.
---
We really appreciate your effort man, thanks for making these.
---
&gt;Cannot cast indoors
---
Yup, I quit around 2010, it was nice to hear Classic is coming so I can be with my brother.
---
Yep, and because of the limits of reservations I won't do. What's the point of reserving a couple of names in one place when it's difficult to know at this point which will be the best server to go with at launch.
---
Go join Skeram! Much love from Grob &lt;3
---
You can still partake in Alliance zones,  that's the point of wpvp. I will enjoy the Alliancr zones while I'm killing em lol
---
Deadmines is probably my favorite dungeon just because of how nostalgic it is. I remember thinking it was as serious as a raid when i was younger
---

---
Experienced player looking for a guild that raids at 8:30/9:00pm eastern time. I’ve played pretty much every xpac and every role, but I’m leaning towards rolling a fire mage or a holy priest. 
---
I am not into pvp very much but I enjoy being on a pvp server when I’ve got a large guild to back me up. 
---
I’ve got two kids and am in my mid 30s and would like a guild with people that are roughly my age. 21+ for sure. 
---
I prefer to play horde. I’ve reserved some names on Fae-whatever but I’m not stuck to the server. 
---
Ideally a guild I choose to be in would be large, less of a chance of my raid team dwindling out after a month or two. I don’t mind needing to ‘earn’ my raid spot. I’d literally have perfect attendance and I don’t stand in the fire. :)
---
Does that mean if you keep hitting the macro, you can disappear and re-appear your helm in quick succession?
---
I played wow classic in a raiding guild and sold my lvl 60 on ebay for 850$ then quit.  I just saw this and plan to play again for the memories :) for how long not sure.
---
I've done it a few times with my main names Dunk and Shady.
---
It gets the heart pumping in those moments but honestly the chances are very low.
---
If you're worried about get, get a buddy to save your name right after you delete, remake without worrying, and when you're ready to accept have your friend delete.
---
I skeram for ice cream!
---
That's at 60. The rate is lower agi per point of crit at lower levels.
---
The game hasnt even launched yet my dude. We have like 9 servers at or over their cap just from people reserving names.
---
You lucky. 
---
Greatest MMO experience ever made.
---
Black rock Depths and Maraudon are two of the best crafted dungeons in any game imo.
---
Is this a troll or are you high?
---
Charles Brandon!
---
Write a script for my Linux box that auto starts the queue for me before I get off work based on the estimates that I see early on.  :)
---
Aww thanks! we work hard on these for sure (though its super fun, we'll have to think of more art things like this to do once release is out!)
---
&gt; For me PvE is a way to get better in PvP and PvP is nonexistant with flying mounts. 
---
The problem with that is your spot in raid is not guaranteed. Back in my day there were too many warriors, rogues and mages, yet healers were always in demand. That's why I rolled for priest. It went perfectly as I expected, I was always welcomed in all kinds of groups, I got to complete many elite and high level quests with the help of teammates, and as soon as I hit 60, I became a regular in a raiding guild. If you were DPS, though, you might not be this lucky, as there would be a lot of competition.
---
Wait classic launches on Monday?
---
If you have a character on 3 different servers which one is your account attributed to for population purposes? Example, 50,000 peope each create 3 characters across 3 servers, do all 3 servers show as 150K pop even though there only 50k players?
---
If you have three characters on one server then yeah it counts as 1 for your account since you can only log into 1 character at a time on that server.
---
the only problem with deadmines vs wc is that after u finish deadmines u gotta go all the way around the mountern to do it again.
---
You know that since your entire post is based on numbers that are pulled out of the air, and tons of supposition with nothing to draw on other than guess work and opinion...there isn't really any way to disprove what you have said.  So the only thing others are doing are not bothering to type out their guesswork and opinion...because it's just as much of a shot in the dark.
---
[From 20 minutes ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cspbmf/how_can_i_setup_my_addons_and_make_sure_things/)
---
Depending on how successful it is, the smart thing to do is both new vanilla servers and convert current servers to TBC.
---
if maintenance isn't extended to at least 6 hours, with no update to the launcher, this will not be a vanilla experience
---
You could play in moderation? It’s all I’ll be able to do with work and home life.
---
Stop listening to min-maxers. You will tank just fine as any race.
---
Glad I could help! Welcome to Stalagg!
---
Well said. I look forward to this as well.
---
Bear tanks are perfectly good MTs for NEARLY everything a Warrior can do.
---
Yeah I got 3 people including myself leveling my main on release, my buddy works the day shift so can play all night long and I can play when he goes to bed.
---
Classics PvE experience at end game is pretty brain dead. PvP is where half the fun is.
---
Any discords up for these servers?
---
My son is 3 in a few weeks so I totally can relate. Once my toddlers are asleep it's time for WoW.
---
Here add a few more.
---
Make sure you /bow at your opponent before you engage in player vs player combat to signal that you are indeed ready to fight.  If you /bow the other player has 30 second to return the /bow or there shall be no such engagement.
---
If you are indeed about to deliver a killing blow to an opponent, make sure that you don't actually kill him and leave them with as little health as possible.  This is to prevent unneeded corpse runs, and thus will not annoy either player.  
---
If you are about to begin a player vs player confrontation, make sure both players have adequate time to return to a vendor and repair their items and return to a agreed upon location to resume the battle.  That way, in the event of a mob getting a killing blow, you won't have your items accidentally broken.
---
Did I miss anything????
---
RED =DEAD
---
You are dude, this is a man.
---
Well if you round it you’re right but if you don’t it’s about 99.5698%
---
What kind of asshole puts tabasco on pizza?!?!
---
SOMETHING NEW! SOMETHING NEW!
---
IE weapons that add abilities different classes need to solve their role they are trying to play. such as Decapitator before it was just added to warrior spells as heroic throw.
---
"I just resubscribed, live on the show" possibly the best sponsorship I've ever seen.
---
Ah so they removed it right as they did the patch I mentioned.  That's why its sticking out in my head.  You bring a good point, where do they drop it then, start, mid of after AQ?
---
The key point to leveling an Alt is that you have the backup main to log over on if someone starts camping you.
---
So of you wanna wait to play, go for it, but I would highly recommend having some hood friends and guikfies to back you up in a pinch.
---
Not really, for some reason its split up in guild discords, im using Semper Danica's, you can find an invite in r/klassiskwow
---
This dude sounds like Randall from Clerks.
---
I also put ranch on my pizza. YOU WANNA MAKE IT A PROBLEM??
---
Why would i want to use that piece of crap?
---
Same. Met so many good tanks that way and was the primary way I built out a friends list.
---
But it's just that, sensory overload. They slapped a shit load of animation, effects, cinematics and voice acting then removed all the game mechanics and depth of the game.
---
Why does everyone put points into Two-Handed Weapon Specialization? 1 point for 1% damage increase seems really shit to me. But I'm no vanilla expert am I missing something?
---
 
---
Hi! Vanilla veteran looking for an LGBT friendly guild preferably on Grobbulus. Or at the least looking for friends there. Thanks!
---
Believe whatever you want man :)  
---
I'm having fun watching you try to justify yourself, though you could probably put a little more effort in than the equivalent of "no u".
---
Also here's an American using the term: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXbzemtA094
---
I get the people are hyped now but current info is a ridiculous blend of anecdotes, wonky private server crap, and stuff from beta that could see changes after launch anyway.  
---
    
---
If you just chillax and lookup the info 3 weeks after launch when you're level 35, there'll be very concise accurate info for everything you need.
---
Phase 2 will be completely unlike every other phase of Classic as far as worldwide massacres are concerned.
---
I guess I could, just would feel odd to be without having to worry about the dude i ganked hunting me on his 60.
---
The 1600 is alliance only. The horde should be about the same size
---
I think that's the best compliment an artist can possibly get.  I've peaked.
---
This is not the advice you tell to the masses.  This is what you tell your friends and guildmates.  You need people to BUY!
---
they're all going to fill up within seconds.  be there or be square!  WooTTT!

---
* **How to join:** Join the Discord!
---
Prologue; the origins
---
Inspired by the heroic actions of **Fuel Rats** group in **Elite: Dangerous**, &lt;Goblin Rocket Fuel Rats&gt; exists with the sole purpose of helping others in World of Warcraft: Classic.
---
&gt;Well, what is **Fuel Rats** and what is **Elite: Dangerous** ?
---
Elite Dangerous is a space-flight simulation game in which the player explores a realistic 1:1 scale open-world representation of the Milky Way galaxy (yes, literally 1:1 scale). Since the Milky Way is mind-bogglingly huge, it is not unusual for space explorers to get carried away and end up stranded somewhere in the void with no fuel. When this happens to you, your only way of getting back is if someone manages to find and reach you to transfer fuel.
---
This is where Fuel Rats come in. These are a group of volunteers who literally go above and beyond to help out their fellow players. There is no in-game system for this, mind you. So each and every member of this selfless organisation help out others through their own means. Their longest rescue mission consisted of five Fuel Rats members finding Commander “Deluvian”, a stranded pilot who is 65,788 lightyears from Sol. *The combined journey took 600 (actual) hours.*
---
It would be an understatement to say how devoted these players are just to help out someone else.
---
Our goal is to provide a similar helpful environment in WoW: Classic. With the help of some **Goblin Rocket Fuel**, anything is possible.
---
Our guild ideology
---
We have one goal; helping out any adventurers we come across. Some will come to us for help, but we should always be open to seeking out others who may be in need. Your level, equipment or the amount of wealth matters not. What matters is a healthy and friendly attitude. We do not have set roles for our members (PvE helper, PvP helper, crafter etc.) because we want you to be exemplary members of the Horde; no matter the activity. We only expect you to be kind to others, guild members and non-guildies alike.
---
As long as you wear the &lt;Goblin Rocket Fuel Rats&gt; guild tag, you should always remember that you are representing this guild with your actions. Treat others the way you’d want them to treat you; don’t ninja loot, don’t spam the chat, help out low level players in quests and dungeons, give them food and potions and buffs, and perhaps some 6-8 slotted bags etc.
---
Guild Events; it’s not just helping but also having fun!
---
Helping out others is not the only reason for our existance; obviously we should be able to enjoy the game on our own as well. Such as;
---
* 5 man dungeon runs (leveling dungeons, max level dungeons)
---
* World PvP
---
* Molten Core / ZG / AQ20 / BWL / Onyxia runs should be doable with enough people. AQ40/Naxx is not on our scope.
---
* Attunement/key runs
---
* Some light Battlegrounds (when they are released)
---
* “Fuel Runs” where we go out to the wild and help random players
---
Epilogue; closing thoughts
---
A little background on myself; I’ve played WoW almost religiously starting from final stages of Vanilla all throughout Wotlk and beginning of MoP. I did almost everything aside from AQ40/Naxx and PvP ranking. Much like many returning players, this time around I’m too old/busy to have a similar playstyle. Instead I just want to kick back with some friends, and enjoy mainly the social aspect of WoW. I will most likely be tanking 5-mans and offering free food/portals/enchant services on a mage alt as well.
---
The reason I wanted to start this guild is to provide a friendly environment. If I can make one person happy, that’s a good day for me. I’m also starting this guild on (Oceanic) PvP server so with some luck I can take revenge on that level 55 gnome rogue who is harrassing those poor level 30’s.
---
Finally, I’m writing a blog on our website about the adventures of our guild written from my perspective. It’s story-driven, somewhat RP-ish, but doesn’t take itself too seriously. I already have few stories from the open Stress Test, and once Classic launches the stories there will be not just mine but all guild members. If you like the idea of having a little wow-diary of your leveling (mis)adventures and enjoy looking back on them, join us now!
---
Feel free to contact me on Discord for any questions.
---
Thanks for your time.
---
They could have gauged interest without requiring *active* subs.
---
Hell, they would have gotten a much more accurate measurement of interest by allowing anybody who has *ever* subbed to reserve their names.
---
I'm sure there are loads of people like me who are planning to sub on launch day.
---
Honestly, the idea of giving up your ultimate ret talent seems foolhardy to me.
---
Ret is already boring to level, and you're giving up one of the fewest interactions you have, and its a great one.
---
If you've not noticed, a judgement of command inflicts bonus damage to stunned or incapacitated targets, this includes targets that have been repented.
---
If you're on a PvP server, that's going to be quite nice, you can repent, heal yourself, then nuke them for bonus damage. Or repent, and mount away.
---
You also mention a leveling build, but you're only showing lvl60 builds.
---
Do you mean leveling, PvE, or PvP. Because you're so obsessed with min/maxing your 60 build that you're making the grind to 60 harder.
---
Also note you have 3 points put into imp. seal of the crusader, but if you're ret i expect you to be using seal of command which receives zero benefit.
---
Also if yuo're ret, i expect you'd want to get imp sant aura.
---
Ret aura is ok, but unless you plan on aoe tanking, sant aura will be higher dps and more fun to boot. Its also 1 talent, just grab it if you're leveling. 
---
You can respec later when you hit 60 for a perfect build (or sooner if you so like), just pick talents that are fun and help you reach 60, then respec once you better understand the class and have the talent points to invest.
---
^
---
Haha yes sir!. I think you story is true for a lot of people. Back then 56 kbps dial up or maybe 512k broad band, and 20 fps was all we had. Now most of us will be 60fps+ on good internet.
---
No, Im sorry.
---
Kismet
---
How on earth is resto levelling considered as neutral???
---
Every expansion after Classic was just as open world as classic. They all had open world we could choose to explore and do things in like we could with classic.
---
The problem for many players was that once they started doing the quests for tasks blizzard assigned them in future expansions, players began to assign value to the things blizzard told players was valuable. And gave them a tangible reward for it. How many players the trade-off in finding value and doing those specific things was no longer finding value and just going out into the open world and making their own five. But that's not blizzard fault.
---
It's like World of Garrison's, I mean Warlords of Draenor, Garrison's were not prisons. People chose to stay in their garrisons and print money instead of going out into the world and doing whatever they wanted.
---
Who is that? Sorry I haven't heard the name before.
---
From everything I was searching, bears were great off tanks, but aside from a few key fights they were strictly worse than a warrior for main tank, assuming you didn't out gear the encounter entirely. 
---
Between not being able to stop crushing blows and the difference in private server vs classic boss parry rates, it sounds like druid was far squishier, which would put alot of stress on healers compared to a warrior
---
As far as dungeons go, they did seem as good or even better than a warior there though! lots of great aoe threat
---
Timbermate rep for me. Gotta get those enchanting recipes
---
Flip a coin between two.  If you're disappointed, you know what one you really wanted.
---
Retail WoW is very different from old school WoW. I didn’t play vanilla but I was a tbc baby, and the retail game has become overly accessible and easy to the point of boredom. The more old school you get with WoW, the better it gets.
---
If you’re looking for English speaking then join a Perth timezone guild as they’ll fit your schedule best.
---
I understand what you mean. I quite like this system of filling each server up before releasing the next one, but I can understand it's a headache for those set on a name or trying to coordinate with a community of players.
---
Yes, it was, as well as Caverns of Time and Hellfire Peninsula.  Sorry, I have no source for those, but I know I've heard that on podcasts.
---
I think it's for the best. This will mean there's an insane amount of World PvP because it's the only way to grind honor. Then, when BG's do come out, there will be a ton of people queueing cause they're tired of World PvP.
---
This is false though, druids have a real issue with threat generation and aggro retention. Especially now that its known that Maul does not generate threat like it did on Pservers.
---
Level secondary professions. For both your own benefit and profit. Fishing takes a while, but the fish are worth it, and the junk crates can have some awesome gear in it. When the AH stabilizes, high end fish will probably be expensive.
---
Cooking will grant stats that are worth it later on. But even early, it's easy, probably free food.
---
And remember, theres none of this guardian and battle elixir nonsense. Buffs, potions, foods, scrolls: they all stack. Not similar types, like scroll of armor and potion of armor. But you can have a scroll of armor, potion of strength, potion of agility, troll's blood potion, PW:Fortitude or stamina or whatever, food, and any other buff that's not just doubling up. It's not always worth it, but it can certainly give you an edge.
---
Remember to train your warlock pets.
---
You do not need to buy gear. Keep your weapon within 5-10 levels of yourself, and that's all you need to worry about. If your weapon is falling behind, you can search for weapons on wow head classic (or your preferred site) and find a quest that gives weapons.
---
If you do somehow over-level a zone, but the quests are for the faction you'll be getting your mount from, stick around and do them anyway. That rep is important.
---
Have fun and explore. I'm hoping they've put in all the Easter eggs vanilla wow had.
---
Hmmm this sounds familiar...
---
holy... thank you so much, this changes how the way I bm in pvp now &lt;3
---
I don’t think you’re going to be able to duo dungeon content unless your past the level where that dungeon is relevant
---
dude, u gonna have issues if u plan on being there opening day.
---
We need WoW Classic VR!
---
Lol if your into more of the old western ballads like songs of also recommend big john by Jimmy dean (yes that jimmy dean) and just kinda go down that rabbit hole

But allow 2-handed shaman to be viable again :(

I had a classic vacation planned back when I thought the release date was going to be in mid-July. Now I'm literally leaving for a business trip on release day. I'll still get to play, just not as much as I would have liked. 
---
I'm secretly hoping that the initial set of servers are all overcrowded and they release some more after a week or two.
---

I'm rushing bis for sure

If you're WOW1 etc. accounts are free trial- accounts there is an option on the battle net account page to delete those.  
---
Just recently found out and managed to delete WOW2 to 4.
---
Yep we will, Danes, Norwegians, many Finns and even some Swedes.
---
Yeah, I agree, as a bag of meat with no self-control and feeling the impulse to accomplish as many things as possible in every way possible, it is somewhat comforting to know that classic is much more simple.
---
It's my own fault if I don't find Value in the things I accomplish in classic
---
Remember that time years back when they said that Classic ISN'T what we wanted?

WTS Swiggity on Fairbanks and Whitemane PM
---
Well think about it, how many people spend easily 6-9 hours at school/work and still play wow? He spends what 2-3 hours in the gym perhaps every second day/daily. To my understanding filming occasionally only takes like 2 months, the rest of the time he probably doesn't do that much.
---
Im assuming he means for gold farming?
---
omg i hate his smug smile at the beginning.  like, suck my wow classic ever living dick, woooooooo!  # GROB MOB

No need to go prot. You can tank as arms or fury with a shield. Don't make warrior any worse than it already is lol.
---
*Europe exists*
---
We also got a new one, patriot.
---
I know what you mean. Original WoW is and Azeroth is a lot more grounded and humble feeling if that makes sense. I played a lot of warcraft 2 RTS before WoW released and it's more in line with that then Outland  even though TBC was a great xpack.

Exactly how i felt about WC especiall with the escort event
---
Dkp works but classes tend to collude with one another. I fixed this back in the day by having item minimum prices. Also you have to figure out what to do with items nobody bids on.
---
As far as blizzard is concerned you're just logging in from home. The fact that keyboard/mouse OS input is coming from a network connection has nothing to with Blizzard or the WoW application.
---
That's what I told my roommates. I'm only going to be able to play about 2 hrs a day or so and don't really want to spend that time in queue ha
---
Yeah I saw some polls but the ones I saw were done before name reservations actually started and before we had 3 new servers.  I can't really trust them now lol.  Would be interesting to see if there's an updated poll but it's probably too early considering the 2 new realms were just announced today.
---
We were on our wogues and there was this DWOOOID
---
It's possible. In which case blizzard will release more servers.
---
Ah ok
---
Warlock is the best of hunter, the best of mage, and extra utility like portals combine. Try undead warlock, it’s the most badass race/class combo in the game and levels very quickly.
---
&gt; They were worried it wouldn't fill up
---
Nonsense. They just figured they could skimp on customer service by pretending « everybody speaks English now ». And if it didn't work they could always track back, announce French and German servers and still look good.

The `..` operator can convert numbers into strings, so you should be able to make the macro a lot shorter. I haven't tested it on an actual server, but I think this will do the same thing:
---
    /e rolls his worn bone dice.
---
    /run local r=random SendChatMessage("rolls a "..r(1, 6)..", a "..r(1, 6)..", and a "..r(1, 6)..".","emote")
---
With this version, you can fit up to 10 dice into exactly 255 characters:
---
    /run local r=random SendChatMessage("rolls a "..r(1, 6)..", a "..r(1, 6)..", a "..r(1, 6)..", a "..r(1, 6)..", a "..r(1, 6)..", a "..r(1, 6)..", a "..r(1, 6)..", a "..r(1, 6)..", a "..r(1, 6)..", and a "..r(1, 6)..".","emote")
---
LOL MY COMMENT SAYING THERE'S ONLY 2 GENDERS GOT REMOVED HAHAHAHA PATHETIC
---
What is on your leg, sir?
---
&gt; We know what you mean but your arguments for being correct are void since you are simply not correct.
---
My entire arguement was based on the fact I stated "live in 8 days"
---
lmfao, what doesn't add up for you?
---
&gt; We know what you mean
---
then shut the fuck up lmfao.
---
&gt;uh, classic is going "live" in 8 days too, so we can call it live now
---
Will you stop being acting like a small dicked bitch in 8 days then

You must just have joined the subreddit.

People are very aggressive here. Sorry, I guess my post were as well.

But a lot of the hardcore Vanilla guys are taking "no shit" from anyone. I am not one of them personally, but this has been a thing for more than a year now.

Sure, you can toggle it with the macro. You could also bake it into an ability, like on a warrior swapping to defensive stance also 'equips' your helmet.

If you're going to PvP as a shaman, go orc. 25% chance to resist stun will make your life 200% better because you'll be able to survive their opener.
---
It’s the same reason people want to have a cool name. Imagine saying “I play on Gelbin, name is Poopyhead” versus “I play on Herod, my name is Nuclearrage.” Still silly, but at least it isn’t lame to say.
---
Not to mention it matters a lot where that survey polled its results from. If it was largely from reddit than that would effect the results towards certain options. People who are here and have been here for months and longer would be the kind of super fan to pay extra to reserve their name early. The topic at hand is about the playerbase in general and people are using data that is specifically about reddit users (if the poll was mostly filled out from here).
---
come on....just think about what youre doing before u do it

the twist is you're all retarded and the same group of friends but none of you can actually count the proper number because you're all retarded.

---
I hope you love it! I'm a little worried that people who played through 1-60 in later expansions got the whole magic of exploration spoiled a little. Then again, if you only played through Azeroth once or twice, theres still probably a whole bunch of areas you havent seen yet!
---
lol, you're reading into what he said way too much, he meant they would be limiting the things the api added later on in wow.  Everything to make an LFG addon work was available in vanilla.  And you do know that casinos arent banned right?  Publicly advertising them in trade/etc is banned, thats it.
---
Pardon ? French and Russian servers are on High/Med. They'll probably require one or two extra servers in the end as well.

Wow what a great plan.  I was planning on having a miserable time but you convinced me otherwise

I thought I could take him the first time and was very much wrong.  Enter paranoia the rest of the time in that zone that would make a meth head think I'm strange.

If I was PST I would roll with Blaumeaux all damn day long.  That was the name of the stress test realm I was on and I liked it then.

You did this in a day? It rocks so damn hard. How much for a commission if you don’t mind my asking?
---
God I can’t wait for launch.

Hey there! Our guild might be a great fit for you. A lot of us are in the same boat with family &amp; kids &amp; agewise. Our raid time is a tad later then what you mention 10-1 EST.  Check us out! Thanks.

I'd love to see arena as a changing set of seasonal items. Have the equivalent amount of items to AV or WSG rep, but have switch every season. That way there is a dope reward for working hard in the arena, but it doesn't affect PvP meta too much
---
I would have thought boomkin would be great for world pvp. Spam people with wrath and moonfire from a distance, can go invis and heals.
---
For me it's Classic on the other side of the jump and IRL goals in the pit. IRL always seem to get in the way of my gaming!!
---
Some Addons could be viewed as hacks back in the day, or at least exploits. I remember you used to be able to change models you personally see with addons, and the example Blizz gave was that it was ok to make something look different, but if you make the WSG flag look like Ragnaros so you could see it from anywhere on the map, that was cheating.
---
I'm curious as to why Balance is rated good for BGs but not WPvP?

Doing Hakkar on a private server for the first time in about 10 years, I autopiloted and dropped a poison cleansing totem. Cue a friendly whisper from the GM and me suddenly remembering how the fight worked. Luckily no wipe, we just kept going so all good right?
---
Except I forgot to swap out the totem and it got the next round of poisons too. Many more whispers came...
---
Still didn't wipe though!
---
Can someone who played the classic beta confirm?
---
You can do the same thing on Chrome:
---
1. Go to Settings
---
2. Manage Search Engines
---
3. Scroll down to 'Other Search Engines' and find classic.wowhead.com
---
4. Click edit and change the keyword to 'wowc' or whatever you like.
---
Come to think of it, they could have been spun into a third faction - Naga, Blood Elves, Forsaken and Draenai (old-school, not space-goats).  Thematically, they're all outcasts!  Horde gets goblins to make up for loss of forsaken.
---
Oh, what could have been...
---
I am in the same boat between Rogue / Hunter / Warlock for my main with a warrior tank as my alt
---
50%?
---
Probably a lot more to be honest.. id say it's like 80% are not subbed or have made a name
---
Correct. OP asked if he could still play the same realm with a wait time, and he can...
---
If any realms die I'm sure they'll allow transfers or mergers to preserve the Classic player experience.
---
I have + Vanillafriends and I made a post on here a while back, my only real hope is that I've only played on RP servers and he will also choose to play on the only RP server that exists, if not I guess that's life.
---
Honestly at this point I've just accepted the fact I only like to level alts. Idk why, I just do. I used to literally get my chars to their class quest at 20 or whatever, then delete them and start over.
---
got 6 days off,  hope to get to ~55
---
true, tho a superman title would probably make alot more money than the others did.
---
Not even sure what you mean, the game is t going anywhere. They can log in whenever they please as long as they have a sub.
---
I’ve been lurking for about 10 months or so. I’ve seen the isolated elitist remarks and the casual vs. min max banter, but now I’m noticing widespread banter and no-bullshit responses on a wide-scale. Just makes sense that it’s happening because of the feeling of being so close to launch. Some of us are like drug addicts just itching for that fix
---
What is this "main" I hear of so often?
---
oh they will, people are gonna be no lifing this game. If you casually play until you really want to get into it, you'll fall behind enough
---
If you can play private server you can run vanilla, they are almost the same.
---
Only gonna get worse as we count the days . But thats a good thing right :D
---
Actually printing is so bad to the environment, get yourself an addon to see full maps of your zones and stop printing. Not /s.
---
Also remember that even though this may be the case now, if there are still a ton of people at the end of phase one then you will see queues when they remove layering.
---
You shouldn't be in defensive stance.
---
Would fit better in Virginia Highlands/Sandy Springs/Ponce/Edgewood than there tbh.
---
If you want to speak English, go to an English-speaking country.
---
I'm always baffled by tourists who feel entitled to be spoken in a language that's neither theirs nor the locals.

I know that paranoia and remember it well.  I ran into him really really early on my first ally toon.  Your looking over your shoulder constantly there after haha.

We are a semi hardcore guild planning to play on Stalagg NA EST PVP. We raid sat/sun 12-3PM in a semi hardcore environment. If those boxes check for you you should send me a pm and we can take it from there. You can check out our guild website here: warcurse.net
---
Medium population is still higher than what vanilla server populations were according to their one blue post.
---
I believe, but am not certain since I never played horde, that mage might have an easier time finding a raid slot and would be more likely allowed to play dps instead of healing in pve content (do correct me if I’m wrong, horde scum).
---
Just another thing to consider...
---
who knows maybe he even uses reddit ;)
---
Who the hell is "hey dalaran?"
---
Thex is already taken, sorry
---
Crushing blows aren't THAT big of an issue in earlier raids - and they'll still be about even with a similar geared Warrior at mitigation until later on. 
---
Watch Skarm's videos on Youtube because he'll be able to explain things much better than I ever could.
---
Lock is solid
---
Yeah I'm mostly kidding. Even the most dedicated athletes have free time. It's just a funny case of someone being quite the opposite of the stereotype.
---
This isn’t 2006 anymore, latency doesn’t really matter. It’s so insignificant you don’t notice.  In another thread a guy from NY said his latency to a PST server was 68ms.  I played on an EU private server and was at around 98ms and I didn’t notice anything.
---
Munk
---
mage
---
Nice name. Think i might use it.
---
Dude. That set is so much more badass now that I’ve seen this.
---
It was not removed until Patch 2.0.1 so it will be required.
---
Oh damn, I didn't realize this!
---
Breaking news, your personal Community experience is what you make it
---
There was a dude I played with pretty much every day for years, starting from SM, to our first raiding guild, dying over and over learning the BC heroics, killing Illidan in BC, transferring together to a better server to raid hardcore in wrath and cata. 
---
Then one day he just stopped logging in. Maybe a month went by, then suddenly his name popped up again. Except any of who whispered him got blocked. Same on Steam.
---
I'm pretty sure he sold his accounts, I'm just not sure why. He never said anything about wanting to quit or having trouble IRL that would make sense.
---
Still bums me out to this day, he was legit one of my best friends.
---
Yeah this would be a great rule set. Too bad that a main priority of most when hitting 60 will be ganking lowbies. 
---
Thankfully my PvE server follows the flagging rule set, so eye for an eye all the way!
---
Schnitzel.
---
I thought I saw the Horde one, Now im worried, whats the server split look like then? 10-1?
---
I will upvote these everyday! :D
---
haha same here m8, can't wait! I have no clue how much to ask, feel free to PM me your idea and i see if I can deliver, doing this for fun atleast for the time being ^^
---
What a great idea! Adding a dot after "Thex" so you have "Thex."
---
Thanks for the response! It’s a little too late for me though, I wake up at 6am est to get the kiddos ready for school, so ideally I’ll be in bed before midnight. I wish you guys the best!
---
Feral and enh get 2AP per Str.
---
I disagree never be afraid to execute someone who breaks the spirit, but not the letter of the rule.  A good GM won't put up with rule lawyering, and is a benevolent dictator and not an elected represenative that has the answer to anyone.

---
I think they are going to get rekt by launch. Countless people haven't subbed yet (if I trust my own thinking -- haven't subbed yet --, what you read on these forums, etc.). Like the servers that are there now, especially PvP servers will get slammed, and then will have to open new ones either on launch or in the days after.
---
I think the amount of people subbing could increase by 100% or more (this at least two-fold) from now until launch. I don't there there is any risk PvP servers extant today won't be full at launch.
---
This is guessing on my part, but countless have not subbed yet.

Thank you for this message, Yeah we actually do show notes every episode and we try to go over them at least a half hour before the show to make sure we know what we are talking about. LORE is a great podcast, I don't listen to it anymore (Gave me weird dreams) as I listen to podcasts throughout the day and kept that one in particular for the night. We record on audacity but I'm the only one with a specific recording mic since i'm also a full time live streamer and have been going at it awhile. I'm still trying to figure out how to get my streamer ramblings to translate to a podcast well since i'm a talker, but normally talk pretty fast. Just trying to slow it down. Debate in high school and college screwed me over, since the whole point was to talk fast and cram information down the other's throat to win. But seriously thank you for the critique, I really appreciate it.

I love this and the one about Flame Wreath (Karazhan).
---
Just a little
---
Apparently grammar education or sounding like a 12 year old weren't goals.
---
right, but isnt that the appeal? people from different cultures and experiences? i feel like you get the best opportunity by not having a local server for rping.
---
decided to play something else this time around but i envy all the locks leveling its so fun.
---
if you have another lock friend to level with its great too just run through each quest zone dotting everything in range
---
Skunk

OP played a private server.  He could have been 20.

---
Well, if they stay til Phase 2, they're not tourists anymore.  I think around 50-70% of tourists will quit, but the other 30-50% will at least stick around and play casually, or become a hardcore fan. Keep in mind the subs are shared, so theres always the character to play when you want to.
---
You planning on healing on the Druid?
---
It's available 8/26 in the US, they couldn't have two templates for those ads? lol
---
The latter. Merging servers is more damaging. Because the server communities does not exist yet. Because the servers are not online yet.
---
Aka 40 allies camping gromgol
---
The problem I can think of with that is it would be harder for blizzard to be able to estimate the actual players per server. If you have 3 characters all on one server, they know that you are pretty close to for sure going to be on that server. If all your characters are different servers, they have no idea which character you will actually end up playing.
---
I bet Weird Al is going to make a song about this.

Not thin air.  I just didn't show my work.

"main" is a french word meaning "hand"
---
Once I hit 60 then I am going to start my 40 box on horde. Hopefullly have 40x lvl 60 alliance that I can multibox and have my main horde farm those honor points. Might even sell 160 kill service to people as well.
---
thanks, I just went through multiple guides trying to figure it all out
---
Good so far. I don't know if these are extremely shitty for doing in one day.  I take days to do a Bob Ross painting and those are extremely shitty.
---
To the front page of classic so that all may suffer looking at this!
---
Um, so let's just take a small portion so I can get an idea of your methodology.  For instance how did you come to the conclusion that there will be 50k US players in 6 months?
---
Current trends in gaming, zoomers, Pserver data, Retail data, etc...
---
&gt; Intelligence is generally marked by curiosity and acknowledgement that "pretty much" isn't knowing much. In fact, I would guess that ignorant people are much more likely to "pretty much know" much more often than intelligent people.
---
Intelligent people are more aware of their ignorance.
---
So wait let me get this right. Me wanting to play a spec that helps my friends, instead of you wanting to play a spec that is cheaper and for fun to you, but helps the EVERYONE else less... thats me being selfish.
---
See the issue is you are projecting your selfish nature. You wanna do what you wanna do you don't care if it makes everyone else's job harder.
---
A more apt analogy would be like i am the one who is fine going dutch when out with friends... everyone else has to pay for your ass however.
---
Awm man pinapple mayo pizza with extra garlic
---
yup, WC was the worst. i started in tbc and some random asked if i'd like to join for WC that a higher leveled druid friend of their's was running for them. ugh, so i did, and that fucking JUMP. i just couldn't do it, i was such a noob. i fell like 5+ times before the druid said "fuck it, let's just keep going and leave them behind"
---
hahahah that fucking jump. can't wait for next monday.
---
for all of wow's history i have been on east coast server but i live on the west coast, i have never noticed any problems.
---
Thank you for a good laugh.
---
But the queues...   :(
---
That is exactly what will happen. Make it your truth.
---
Classic+ is all but confirmed. TBC is also on the cards. Classic, as it is, will be permanent.
---
We will get NEW servers for Classic+ and TBC, this is so damn clear. It keeps the entire player base, and adds TBC and Wrath people, plus new players that will want new, but Vanilla-like content, no BS level cap increase, flying mounts, etc.
---
It is what I have been saying for months...and getting downvoted.
---
I’m self employed and work in building/construction. I purposefully made myself really busy this week so the days go quicker! I also didn’t book any work in next week so I have a full week of nonstop classic :D
---
Thanks buddy, appreciate it a lot. Have a wonderful week and a fun time on Classic!

It opens the door.. you think retail died because of 1 moment in time? nha it died because it slowly built up over time from one open door to the other

I can guarantee you were like 3 years old or younger when WoW originally launched.

---
I got it

Alright nerd

Wasn’t world first C’thun a dwarf MT?

I think it's closer to 43 actually if I remember correctly

Did you play last stress test? Zone 1-5 is no problem at all, and as long as you're ahead of the pack by 5,  5-60 will be no problem either.
---
Spotted the PvP scrublord
---
Lol
---
I got ganked yeah but two wrongs don't make a right. I'm not going to camp a lowbie. That's no fun.
---
I have Angel and Xin on Skeram PVP
---
Depends on the server. Older servers won't have as many tourists as the newer ones.
---
Check out the warlock discord, there is A LOT of useful information there, probably more than you'll ever need.
---
1 month is barely long enough and my facial hair grows at a good pace. I think what they mean though is a decent length beard and not a nice trimmed looking one.
---
Glad to see I wont be the only one missing this because of Dragon Con.   I figure at least maybe there wont be over crowding as much since well all be a little bit behind everyone who played all weekend
---
Most of my WoW memories are in classic World PvP.
---
The thing is we wont really KNOW how big an issue crushing blows will be because of the parry differences. Every time a boss parries, they attack faster with a follow up attack, which will lead to far spikier damage hits than on private servers. 
---
Ultimately it'l be interesting to see how it turns out for sure! I just take videos like Skarm's with a grain of salt as we know alot of private server stuff was  notably off compared to classic

No, Feral, it's 1.12 patch not Vanilla Vanilla, this is post Direbear change.  It's the patch that put Feral tanks as comparable to warriors.  We started using tanks in advanced raids at that point.

3.  Asymmetric matchups are the heart and soul of world pvp.  Go play a pve server and forget it even exists instead of madposting on reddit.
---
OP, is there any way you could do updated scans? Really interested.
---
Yup. My guild got to C’thun and started Naxx with 2 out of 3 of our regular tanks were Night Elf, including me. We never had an issue. We only didn’t get further because TBC came. We were a casual raiding guild that just took our time and not forcing our members in to anything.

---
I'd roll on dong iron.
---
The incels are triggered!
---
Yeah, sort of what you get when you don't really do any major tweaks. Just as Naxx10 bosses had just slightly more health than Naxx40 bosses, certain mechanics dealt way under par damage as well.
---
Loatheb's Inevitable Doom for example deals ~ 2.5k damage every 10 seconds for 30 seconds (3 ticks, permanently every 15 sec after 5 minutes into the fight) in Naxx40, on every raid member. On Naxx10, 20 levels later, it deals a flat 4k. So 1.5k more.
---
This is exactly what I was looking for, finally
---
You are supposed to play for those 16 hours and then take a 1 hour nap fool. Learn how to no life it.
---
Nah man, actually when I picture pvp servers I picture 60 v 60 pvp and how sick it is
---
I mean not really but I get your excitement
---
As an OSRS player (started in feb 2004, has 15 years cape on RS3 but isn't maxed) and a early WotLK player, I can tell you what's happening in both scopes.
---
Just like Old School servers, Classic is an older version of WoW. We're going back to how it was in patch 1.12.x - the last Vanilla patch - with it's content being released in phases. At this moment, there's little talk about "adding new, classic-related content in the future, without ever raising level cap or venturing into the newer expansions" like OSRS did with Zeal, Fossil Island and others, but that might be something one day.
---
Every expansion, World of Wacraft goes through mechanic overhauls and steady, but continuous graphic revamps. While some of the latter will be kept in Classic (think of it like being able to zoom in OSRS - something impossible back in 2007, but doable now thanks to the HTML5 engine), the former changes are being overwritten; systems like Glyphs and Talent Trees, long gone from Retail, are still in Classic. Things are just like they were back then.
---
The community is thrilled because of the heavy RPG theme and community integration in Classic, inherited from Vanilla. While OSRS kept some of the RS3 content scheme changes (such as making large-scale raids such as Wintertodt a thing), Classic is currently relying on it's "authentic experience", based off on revisiting the old world just as it was years ago, with the same issues and the same story. It's basically the same idea OSRS originated from, but keeping changes to a minimum - if not zero.

4. You weren't convinced, but literally all your friends are going to play on a pvp server
---
It has a lot more to do with the fact that a month ago you couldn't spend money on the game. Think about it, when is the last time you saw advertising for a game you couldn't spend money on (or soon spend money on it)? Teaser trailers at conventions don't count (because nobody counted them for Classic either)

    database("ServerData").CharByServer

---
This is how I, as a very rudimentary-level user, would do this with our big data solution at work.  I am 100% confident that *someone* at Blizzard can figure out how to do a very basic database query like this.  It's not hard.
---
Teamspeak had a initial release one year before ventrillo (2001).  So they are about same age. Think we used ventrillo first, then teamspeak, then swapped back and later mumble?. But i cant for the life of me remember what we used for everquest before that. Or perhaps we just did not use it, and i first used voicechat in DaoC. argg can not remember
---
Kinda shocked how many of us are on here lol
---
*Exactly.*
---
Stay up till midnight, super hyped, telling myself 10 levels then ill go to bed, reach level 3, tab out to look at some porn, masterbate, tab back in, hearth, go to bed
---
Feral absolutely can - it's a marvelous offtank, in some situations outclassing a warrior even.
---
Pretty bad at Nefarian because of the whole being-turned-into-a-giraffe thing and chromaggus cause of the sands, but can tank most of the game's content just fine.
---
Feral DPS requires a ton of dedication but is pretty decent overall in PVE.
---
I reckon with AQ raid gear 2 druids can do every 5 man in the game, from a dps/tank/healing perspective- but some mechanics like mind control or magic dispel might screw you over at times. But yeah, it's simply going to come down to gear. With fresh levelling greens - not much. With half decent blues - quite a lot.

Thats on blizzard. Im not pre-ordering a 19 year old game. Its a fucking scam that we can ”reserve” names for 15 bucks

I don’t get it. Isn’t there like a week between tomorrow the 20th and release the 26th or...?
---
Everyone is going to transfer, you’re on the dead server. Have fun!

You can still pop cat form

Lok Tar O'gar!

Going to the A&amp;M game in Nov.  BEAT THE HELL OUTTA GEORGIA!
---
I just hope it gets populated
---
Actually my favorite thing about PVP servers is defending lowbies and lowbie quest areas from gankers.
---
4) one of the main points of the game is horde and alliance are at war so it makes sense that they would fight eachother
---
Eyes on the prize, i can respect that
---
Looks great, I think some of the data is dated though.  It seems Voidwalkers can't hold aggro like they can on private servers, so Imp and Succubus at different stages seem to be the best options.  Which changes the leveling talents as well.
---
PvP is my motivation for gearing up! having more purples than other people on my faction doesn't do anything for me. they're my friends, why should I want to compete with them? but being in a world where I have to fight against other players whenever I go out in the world gives me a reason to want to be as strong as I can be.
---
as far as lowbies go, while I'm leveling I plan on stopping at level 30 for a bit to spend some time in redridge. I don't have anything against killing a player that's green, but the real fun is trying to survive against an entire hostile zone of players who want you gone.
---
Paladin 2.0

This looks awesome.

Are you planning to do any other classes as well?

Nix, Zyra, and Kathryn. Wanted Kat but I couldn't load in fast enough.

If you are with us Mike and Andy let it be known!

If the person who has Evade on Skeram sees this, hit me up. I have it on Stalagg for trade or maybe we could work something else out.
---
You’re a champ. Thanks for this answer. I love the OSRS comparisons. So good.
---
Clarification:
---
&gt; While some of the latter will be kept in Classic (think of it like being able to zoom in OSRS - something impossible back in 2007, but doable now thanks to the HTML5 engine), the former changes are being overwritten; systems like Glyphs and Talent Trees, long gone from Retail, are still in Classic. Things are just like they were back then.
---
So graphic revamps as in the quality of life updates you’ve mentioned? I don’t imagine them upgrading the character graphics and such, analogous to to how OSRS kept its initial graphic style as opposed to the HD graphics in 2008
---
I got Taint, jelly?
---
Language can changuage
---
I like Lady Blammo the best.
---
Ehh, I thought Aquaman did it’s job and I hear Shazam was well received. 
---
I’m over all comic book movies personally. Same old shit over and over.
---
Troll. Shadowguard procs blackout and hex of weakness is a mortal strike debuff.
---
WotF isn’t as good as either of those and devouring plague costs a ton of mana.
---
Thunderfury, Ion, Bob
---
How big do the numbers have to be before Blizzard starts bragging?
---
Blow-me?
---
Ken, Armored, Rattle, Hated - Skeram. Might trade for good names on Herod
---
I'm not really fretting about it too much, it's just a little disheartening to see so many noobs getting so much bad advice. The info spread around isn't necessarily wrong, it's just not adapted to the audience, really.
---
From personal experience try talking to people who are the same class or same role as you. About anything really.
---
I've played a resto druid for the last 15 years, the last 5 years were the most important because I have a guild in WoD that suited me. I started talking to the other healers between raids etc. And now a few of us are really good friends and have regular meet ups irl.
---
This is very detailed, thanks for sharing
---
Blake was taken instantly, so I grabbed Smorc for my orc hunter.
---
Ahhh ya, Blizzard should have just had their psychics sense that a bunch of people never expressing in public that they wanted classic actually wanted classic. Seriously, the number of people playing on private servers was low, the number of people just asking for it in public spaces was LOWER. By estimates based on max layers per server and layer pop Ion has mentioned in interviews classic still isn't going to have as many players on launch as retail.
---
I was gonna go for Bob, but thought it would have too much competition. Grats
---
Pretty accurate. A note about balance PvP.
---
**Moonkin** is really bad for all types of PvP because it limits your strength of form dancing. But full (or deep) balance without moonkin is really strong at all types of pvp and arguably the best druid spec for pvp.
---
Mila Kunis and Cameron Diaz played wow? For real?
---
Pally, BM, Nidalee
---
agree with most but cant fuck.heroics. 1 difficulty. u beat it or u dont.
---
Vaccination rates about to receive a bump.
---
this is very detailed, thanks for sharing.
---
Yes just remember that Druids are only tauren so you have to train in thunder bluff and nighelve Druids have to train in the nelf area.
---
As a shaman you will be asked to heal in raids. Enhance is terrible dps and elemental is oom 50% of the fights.
---
Ultra
---
I'm rolling on a PvP server so when I enter contested zones there's a feeling of danger. I like being on the look out and tense. Sure it's going to be annoying as fuck getting ganked by a rogue right after a mob gets you down to 30%, there are upsides and downsides to everything.
---
Everything you do on you're character will be that much harder, making accomplishments feel even more rewarding. Faction rivalry's mean that much more. You can call for help from your guildies too, which is another level of bonding and relationship building you can have in the game.
---
You can do this with Safari on Mac and iPhone/iPad too.
---
1.	Go to wowhead.com
---
2.	Search for anything (this automatically adds the custom search to your Safari config)
---
3.	Boom! You can now do instant wowhead searches by typing “wowhead &lt;query&gt;” in your address bar.
---
https://i.imgur.com/kwpSGY8.png
---
https://i.imgur.com/bjCeT8E.jpg
---
Additionally, if you don’t even want to open Safari before searching, on macOS and iOS using Spotlight to search “wowhead &lt;query&gt;” will usually give you a direct link to the item (just hit return/enter to open in your browser). This works with Wowpedia as well.

Looks cool! I am using the transmog while leveling my Prot Zandalari Warrior. Aquarium looks sweet too! So clean and in order!
---
I got Supreme finally =)
---
It didn’t help :(
---
nice, 3 solid names
---
I am one of them. I’ll be making my character the day before launch.
---
i got loot just by attendance 
---
like there is 40 people back then i think i knew like 10 people in my guild
---
not to say i hated anyone , its just a bit hard to get to know 40-50 guildies that well
---
never had issues but i was in a good guild with a dkp type system sorted out
---
I got Roxy and Narancia! and also Diavolo for my friend
---
If your getting rid of it ill take it!
---
Who is this?
---
Lol googled it and found this same post and was gonna share it here. I'm just gonna say my server is "Blow Me"

Although some of the people on that list are no longer with us... RIP Robin Williams.
---
Paladin. The first time I booted up retail I knew I had to make my first character a dwarf Paladin, and having been playing one ever since. 
---
I’m rolling human for classic and intend to play the traditional “healer/utility” route, even though I’ve only ever played Ret on retail. Super excited to start!
---
Vanity 🔥
---
Nope
---
5 million is way too high my friend
---
It will be my honor to be slain by you
---
and if the queue is that bad nobody will ever leave the server, they'll just use anti-afk macros making the problem even worse
---
Some people care more and some care less though, regardless it's arrogant to assume that one person's view is how everyone else is as well.
---
Maybe she is a neat freak, maybe she really cares about house decor. Could be anything really.
---
Yeah I wanted Mike but it was gone in seconds
---
I got "Tiffany" and "Mommy" if anyone wants to buy them PM me.
---
Got Deadshot ( hunter)
---
I'd wager if you roll Tauren on opening day it won't be packed; but I doubt you'll be lonely.

Ale, Summer

I mean, we all like min-maxing, stat crunching, and playing make-believe.  seems like good targeted marketing.

Do you have any more gum?
---
O damn I was going for this as my first choice, lmao.
---
People who haven't played wow before can't know if they don't like healing, though. That's what I'm trying to say. If you're picking up the game for the first time, you don't know how anything works yet, so there's no point in telling someone "don't pick a paladin if you don't want to heal in raids when you're 60". 
---
They don't know what healing in wow is. They don't know what raids are. They don't even know how to get to 60.
---
I got Wojtek for a druid and Cudjoe for a hunter.
---
Pretty stoked about the druid name!
---
Why no poisons?
---
How can I go back to playing a game I don't play?
---
"You logged in!"
---
Like seriously that actually is commonly an achievement these days I think.
---
Wow I’m an idiot lol. Rogue/warr/mage
---
Wow. TIL..
---
I got Chad on blaumeux
---
I'm liking him more and more.
---
I was in fast and didn't get mine either. Got my friend's name though and my other name. Might stick with Thalnos though as my other friend didn't get any of his names. Ugh.
---
I wanted Cake too. If whoever got it sees this, hit me up!
---
I’ll trade you Shadough for Burger
---
Well people will be able to plan for ganking lowbies on their way up. By all means you do you. I love the PvP more than anything and I wanna be on the max level side of pvp before phase 2 hits so when I level my alt I can at least hop on my main if I am getting camped. Play how you would like to though lol
---
Hey man sweet video! Do you have an opinion on warlock or rogue on alliance for PVE? Really cant decide :(
---
Get alch and tailoring to where i can make mooncloth, arcanite bars, and GFPPS and sell em shits
---
You get Ret aura at 16 and it does 5 damage, Warriors do more with thunderclap and get cleave at 20. Blessing of sanc is level 30 where warriors have WW and sweaping strikes.
---
Warrior + Healer is much better than Paladin + Healer for the vast majority of the leveling experience hands down.
---
especially for a first timer, but unless you've been playing on a private server for years enjoy what you'll experience.
---
If all those things matter to you, you'll be much more in-tune with skill or equipment changes. Like you'll see averages instead of relying on a damage meter and stuff because it'll matter to you more.
---
people keep calling me cheap because i dont think the majority feel like wasting half a month of sub
---
the strongest think you have is moving them away from their follow range. the box player will have to round them usually focusing on running them toward their group.
---
Someone make a Paladin one!!!
---
If you role on a pvp server and expect players to have any kind of honor code, you're lying to yourself. You are going to get frustrated and should probably just roll on a pve server.
---
So it was you.. i tried to get that too lol. Happy with Thad tho
---
Putting aside the fact that repeating that meme is stupid considering the launch numbers still look to be lower than what retail has and every knows at least some of those won't keep playing even if it's not as much as Blizzard thinks. It's actually thanks to that question and answer that a lot of people finally spoke up and let Blizzard know that they actually did want Vanilla again. A lot of people who had never actually said anything about it, and so it was that question and answer that led to Classic existing.
---
It really is still a stupid meme though.
---
Got the name Villain on BlowMe. Only name I care about. UD rogue btw
---
Astral
---
H sham ;)
---
got Maga on Skarem and Bubbleoseven on Blaumeux. trade only for names on Fairbanks
---
LADY BLAMMO AND I REFUSE TO ACCEPT OTHERWISE
---
No harm, it happens
---
"Does anyone know if we will be able to shadowmeld eat death coils on live *in 8 days*?
---
Yeah, if you'd written like so from the beginning everything would have been fine. If you'd had admitted your fault on the second comment everything would have also have been fine.
---
Instead you go in a defensive stance and shout out profanities, calling me names for example. Its not a good look. If you had admitted you write wrongfully and corrected yourself you would have received more respect. And probably an answer to your question.
---
Also I'm not sure about the answer but I believe we won't be able to shadowmeld in combat, first a hunter needs to feign death to get out of combat to follow up with a night elf shadow meld. At least that's what I believe will happen after the launch of classic from what I've read. I'm not a hunter and I will not play hunter this time around.
---
* Yes you can down bosses with it 
---
* Yes there's a big difference
---
* Yes guilds will take you
---
* Yes you will be replaced when your raid leaders realize that you're not only underperforming, but choosing to underperform
---
Astral, horde shaman ;)
---
Something Google churned out, nothing else I know. I mean she did say her name is Kurn?
---
How much better is Resto than feral in a raid, if we are being honest????!
---
Nah I’m on Herod.
---
Sandy Springs reporting. Best of both worlds!
---
I think the meeting stones might be in the game from the beginning.  They were completely pointless in vanilla tho.  It was literally a tall rock that (in theory) you could stand by while waiting for others to get there.  Are you possibly thinking of summoning stones which were introduced in TBC.
---
Pserver players quit too, you know.  Most of them leave after BWL.
---
if both, warrior and rogue, dont use cd's, the rogue wins 100% of duels except its against an orc warrior. orc warriors can do lucky crits whenever he resists a stun. how? stun and opener work every time, kite with crippling poison, restealth, reengage. 
---
as soon as cooldowns are allowed, rogues win about 90% of duels, because all warriors can get lucky crits.
---
Neither have I - I'd have seen videos of Skarm telling the world he was wrong about Feral, then.
---
Maul still has a threat multiplier of like 175% and Bear form, too, has a large one. Bear does decent threat in 1.12
---
If it doesn't then it's also shit in TBC because buffs to the spec weren't huge; the class only received alright gear throughout the game.
---
I got "Word" on Herod and "Executus" on Skeram, PM.
---
Stitches look like Fiona after the ogre babies ate her tummy 2 get out.
---
A week of play time that i wont be using isnt worth it to me for a name. I am sure blizzard knows that there are a lot of players like me that will wait until the day before to actually resub. OP i 100% agree with you. I do, however, believe that they will need to open 2 more servers minimal to handle whats going to be unleashed on their servers. There hasnt been this much hype for WoW since Wrath release (say what you want about Wrath but it was the biggest hyped project they did for WoW)
---
I had the official Brady Games map back in the day. It got beat to hell in various moves, and I no longer have it. Wish I did though...
---
Because layering won’t be a thing cone phase 2.
---
where do you think those people came from?
---
You need a new setup my guy. That's going to give you trouble.
---
Wow I remember this list.  I forgot it existed.
---
Fuck JAB
---
BFA hurts my eyes
---
I got "Word" on Herod and "Executus" on Blameux, PM.
---
Switched over to one of the new realms. looking forward to less q times and cluster fucks
---
Goddamn Horde, you know you're not supposed to stop the arrow with your face right?
---
I remember the spriest engineer duelist who used to stand outside goldshire and duel people all day. I never did beat her.
---
Feels to me like too MANY mechanics. Azerite Power! Keystones! Mythic+! Three different raids!
---
The two zones i enjoy that seem to get ignored is the hinterlands and Feralis.
---
Dunno if it's underrated but felwood is great. Love the corrupted but still fantasy antmosphere. The quest chain going into the demon hold where you escort the night elf out is great.
---
So my main lady, whom I have always called my wife, is my hand? This is painfully accurate
---
They deleted the server sorry
---
Everyone always says this about backstab why is that?  Is, it just because you don't get many opportunities when you are solo or is it still kinda shit when grouped up? Genuinely curious, I've never really played a rogue past like lvl 10.
---
For everyone else, there's r/Atiesh
---
Be legendary, friends.
---
Nope you cannot. You can get pretty close while leveling and turn in some cloth at 60.
---
Super stoked for wow classic and decided to celebrate launch with some alliance themed nails!
---
#&lt;goonsquad&gt; | Casual Friendly PvE 
---
website (*not* mobile friendly):  https://www.goonsquadguild.com
---
###**Who is this guild structure aimed at?**
---
This guild was created by and for competent players with restricted play time who still wish to experience all content in Classic.  We will not be racing to 60 at a hardcore speed, and we will have relatively lax rules for attendance of raiders.  We will provide significant incentives for players who are willing to dedicate their time and effort both inside and outside of the raids.  Far more detailed information can be found on our website, though it is not mobile friendly.
---
###**How is Loot distributed?**
---
The short answer is single blind bid DKP.  The long answer is that attendance, progression, and consumables are all ways to gain DKP, with no DKP cap or decay.  To prevent players from accumulating massive amounts of DKP and receiving all of the best items, there will be a cap on the amount of DKP a player can bid.  When multiple players bid the DKP cap, a predetermined waiting list will decide who receives the item, and that player will be moved to the bottom of the list.  This allows a rotation of distributing the very sought after items.  Again, far more detailed information can be found on our website.
---
###**When are raid times?**
---
There will be two raid nights on which attendance will be taken and DKP can be earned:
---
Tue/Wed 6:00pm - 9:00pm PST.  
---
An optional Monday night will also be scheduled during the same time slot.  Attendance will not be taken and DKP cannot be earned.
---
The first guild scheduled content will be 10 weeks after launch, however, as advertised, we are very casual friendly and will not be removing prospective raiders if they are not level capped at this time.  Please note that other players will have a head start on acquiring DKP if they are level capped at that time.  
---
###**How can I join?**
---
There is a very short application process on our website for prospective raiders.  This is mostly to check for mindset compatibility.  A link to the guild discord is available on our website, but players will not have access to any of its functionality until officially added by guild management.
---
Any player is welcome to join as a social member.  Note that raiders will *always* be given priority when forming weekly raid groups, and we aim to recruit enough raiders that we should not need to field social members.
---
Only eight days left!
---
**EDIT:** If you have applied on the website, please provide an email that you actually check, this is the only way we can easily contact you after your application is reviewed.  Some applicants have made mistakes in their spelling or provided emails that are not valid, and we have no way to contact them unless they have also joined the discord.

---
I think it's the opposite. I shouldn't have to correct anyone and they should look for proper information on their own before making those.
---
What I'm mentioning is super basic and in the Warrior's discord FAQ for exemple. Takes 5 minutes of researching and reading.
---
Thirded!
---
Awesome thanks! Appreciate all your input
---
Can't decide between shaman, warlock, or mage. I played a hunter and priest before.
---
&gt;classic still isn't going to have as many players on launch as retail
---
If that actually happened it would be groundbreaking. Anyone who actually expects Classic to outperform Retail (not counting the launch weekend) is probably delusional.
---
You do realize that on launch day there will be thousands and thousands of more people joining right?
---
All we are seeing right now is those that wanted to reserve their names.
---
Reminds me of the "Jimmy Story" video. "You're on Thottbot you are cheating anyway"
---
This is a phrase that I'll still say (almost as obnoxiously as Joe) every once in a while. It's generic and no one has ever or will ever understand the reference, but it *actually* still makes me chuckle.
---
Dude's probably going to be playing classic.
---
Love a good dwarven inn :D
---
Listened to all of the podcasts over the last year, thank you so much Josh!
---
ive not seen a specific duo guide 
---
its basically a solo guide but you kill double the mobs for collection quests
---
alternatively you can de group for collection and do it on different phazes 
---
i think its just better to do it together , 2 people are a lot more strong than one and it just feels faster because each mob does not take as long
---
lol what nimrod downvoted that - you sir are dumb
---
They quit the server, not the game.
---
Google it but beware.

Half of Brazil is white, lol.  The complaint people have about Ragnaros has nothing to do with skin color, and everything to do with language barriers and incompetence.   The complaint does not imply that English speakers can't be toxic, nor is the complaint that Spanish &amp; Brazillians are toxic.  That is some world-class mental gymnastics and strawmanning you have on display right there.
---
&gt;The Hinterlands
---
I have to also agree.
---
That's because Shazzrah has the biggest population, you actually see people talking about it. This will continue after launch - "Look what happened on Shazzrah!"  "Shazzrah event!" meanwhile on Gehennas/Firemaw - "*crickets*"  
---
They need to lock the full servers and give the others a chance to become full.
---
At my computer.

Not at level 60. Agi is better.

Perfect answer, I'm not much of a min-maxer but I also realize that big of a percentage is nothing to sneer at. Thanks!

Game came out 2004. Math says otherwise
---
Eastern plaguelands,
---
It was on my birthday :D
---
Though most of the day I spent on farming this last lvl, not celebrating..
---
Honestly, love that.
---
That sign is awesome, I would love one of those.
---
sure they do, because most played on privat servers instead of retail classic. hunter mechanics are different to privat server mechanics. you'll be surprised if you roll hunter again, mate.
---
Yes 2x instant poison on alliance or windfury MH instant OH for horde
---
No Horde are the only ones allowed to gank
---
yes i understood u and im saying if they do TBC they should keep the classic way of doing dungeons and raids.
---
I don't know if you're trolling but those old Vanilla comments are from a bunch of newbs that had very little knowledge of game mechanics. Despite the fact that a bunch of newbs back in the day either DE'd these or sold them for 20-70g on the AH, times have changed and knowledge about the game has vastly increased. These are / will be worth between 2k and 8k gold, depending on your server.
---
There's no PVE RP server for Pacific timezones. That's a bit of a bummer. Prob wouldn't be as popular, but I'm not doing east coast speeds just for some RP, forget it.
---
Yes, yes yes yes!!  
---
My friend and I both watched this like 50 times back in the day, it was easily our favorite WoW video. That whole era of wall-walking was just such a unique experience within a video game, never had anything like it since. Thank you for bringing it up. Big influence on my childhood in a way
---
Luckily I had an unused wow token when I logged in on name reserve day, and 860,000 gold on my legion mage.  I practically spent my last two months of legion farming and playing the AH for fun, the game got that boring.  Glad I did focus on gold making so now I can free roll for a bit.
---
Thank you for the Warlock one! Looking forward to that afflicition goodness.
---
I agree, I think a lot people think they will wait out the que and just say fuck it and create characters with their friends on other servers and stay there.
---
Blah-moe
---
Grobbulus is currently at medium that is more people on the sever then the busiest server during Vanilla. We also still have a week to go and many players likely  will not subscribe till launch day. Likely both servers will be full by launch.
---
Why does everyone think PvP servers are "hard"? Why do PvP players always shit on PVE servers? Maybe I wanna level my Druid in peace after work without xX\_BaneOfSTV\_Xx the rogue ganking me?
---
Honestly you right I had this funny meme that generated 2.2k upvotes and 200+ comments and got to the top 6 on the “hot” within hours, people were having a good time in the comments comparing wow to the older harder mmo’s and everyone having a good time discussing in there and laughing at the meme, then within those same few hours the “flagged it as low tier meme” and removed it, I think cause tbh they got butthurt how popular it got so fast, I agree with you it’s not modded well, very toxic and biased. This will prolly find some way to be removed too after they see our comments..
---
Manual crowd pummeler making your spec viable, does not make it good. Nobody is going to have that item, let alone farming 50 of those per week for raids.
---
I think it's definitely worth it, especially with cooking. It's a great way to make some extra gold.

Weird being in the same boat with the 27 year olds at 18. :&gt;
---
Just re-roll on herod. Guaranteed no ghost town there.
---
Yes you can, the only inconvenience will be having to run there to meet up.
---
Get to level 5 first, and then take a ship to stormwind, do the quests together in goldshire if he's human or from stormwind fly to ironforge and do the quests there instead.
---
Ah I forgot all about this, ventrilo harassment is the best.
---
And to clarify, he means more damage dealt = higher TPS.
---
Would appreciate if anyone could share
---
Due to the racials pvpers are drawn more to horde and raiders to alliance. Both have benefits in world pvp tho
---
Nice.
---
Nah actually got most of the names I wanted on white mane and locked in the one I really wanted on blaumeux
---
Good luck! I've always wanted to win that damn thing.
---
Seems like? Where is the catalog of information that tells you the amount of horde gankers? I keep seeing comments like this where they say it seems like about something that concerns them. Where is this info? Certainly you aren’t naive enough to think Reddit posts is a valid source of metrics.
---
Not at all. Login servers are different than the game servers.
---
As far as my memory goes, i remember these coming out when the gates of AQ opened. I thought there was 2 or 3 different ones. I thought that they dropped in AQ20 maybe like handbook of backstab, deadly poison and feint. Perhaps those were a different series of skill upgrades than this manual was though.
---
Looking for a guild, personal deets below:
---
* Myself + 1 other
---
* Pref raid days: 2 days per week any day Mon-Thurs
---
* Pref raid times: 7-10 EST
---
* Looking for semi-hardcore, emphasis on the semi (none of this "semi-hardcore and pushing to be one of the first of 5 guilds to clear naxx" bullshit). We want to raid fairly seriously/regularly but don't want to go overboard on guild expectations...
---
* 1 druid tank preferred main role, but willing to heal as necessary but preferably not as a primary spec
---
* 1 resto sham
---
* Both myself and my friend have played off and on since classic
---
* We've both raided seriously for a couple of xpacs
---
Blaumeux: Bryan, Victor, Ez
---
Skeram is such a bitch to fight
---
Sorry, you're just wrong buddy
---
Not the point. The point is the demand is there. That's what the thread is saying.
---
yes opened 1 hour ago
---
you should try and pickup a damage dealer to play with you
---
im rolling paladin and priests are great but both of them are a bit slow 1-20 or 1-30 you may find it a bit slow
---
Did you have to pay to play on those servers?
---
If the entire reason that people play on your realm is because all the other realms are full, maybe that's a shit realm.
---
It's just a book on writing addons, macros and UI customization.
---
I played on a CST realm for all of Vanilla and TBC and some of Wrath. I'm PST. You'll be fine.
---
I think Feralas is underrated, I always enjoy starting my questing there, unlike some other zones... *cough* Felwood *cough*.
---
Superxmoto, I was only able to meet you once IRL, and I know it was mostly TBC, but you were a great duos partner and I was a wreck when I found out what happened. I’ll slaughter some Alliance for you my friend. RIP.
---
Makrik is a horde dominated Normal server. Pagle is heavy alliance.
---
No one cares about role playing other than you neerrddsss
---
Sure. I have a couple of other names I will be swapping over too, but I wanted to know how careful I have to be with a name that common. 
---
**The fact that it's common is the reason I don't have to be careful saying it online**. There is a character on each server with the same name, most of which need to be remade.
---
If posting the name increased my chance for it to be taken, it is so marginal that I don't care.
---
Yikes
---
Banks and AH is linked but yeah you'd need FPs to reach org from tb
---
thats why you roll a human
---
I have played on Rp realms since launch only once i have seen a rp dungeon run so yea not common.
---
If they launch tbc they need to do it by copying characters and keeping vanilla vanilla.
---
Any new ones on EU?
---
If I recall correctly, the servers themselves were fine if you could get on. The LOGIN server on the other hand... XD
---
Meanwhile I'll be level 12 on bloodsail buccaneers.
---
**US - Pagle - Alliance - Aly#1476**
---
Just looking for friends to get hyped over classic launch with. Don't really have any. I will be playing a Human Warlock named "**Kevinn**"
---
Once you log off it's like perma death, you are never seeing that character again.

Do you have a source on the maul threat being less?

Blizzard clearly didnt have the right estimates.
---
Here's the real question: should we get a WoW fantasy league put together for kicks?
---
Never got this before and have played ps and normal client
---
ATM machine
---
it's really just Brann, and he's a greedy bastard who keeps all the good maps to himself
---
&gt;the queue is temporary for like a week max and recognize we'll have like 80% attrition at years end. not looking to play on a ghost town, considering rolling stalagg at this point
---
Your first point is simply false, they're not worried about p1 queues they're worried about p2 (post-layering) queues when the server cap goes from 40k+ to 4k..
---
Second, everyone assumes this crazy level of attrition, if it's above 60% at the beginning of p2 I'll be very surprised.
---
If everyone thinks like you are by the end of this post , then Grob *WILL* be a ghost town cuz the people who are playing on it all think it will suck lmao not even giving it a chance!
---
Real RPers never give up, and they never go back on their word!
---
So my main is my principal? Mr Jones is going to be shocked to hear this
---
Can someone please explain to me like a 5 year old the difference between the WoW as it exists now and this classic version?
---
1 i think
---
Yes it is, but my wife owns the rest of the rooms walls with her Pokemon shrine. It's only fair!
---
Grobbulus is going to get hit worse than every other server because everyone will just avoid queues and try and hop in any realm to just play or set up their add-ons etc.
---
A good chunk of the players on the first day on Grobbulus probably won't even stay there past level 10.
---
If you're basing your decision on reckoning, be careful because they've fixed that *bug* where you sit in combat.. you don't get reck stacks from sitting..
---
ELLLRRROOYYY NNNNNJUURRRNNNKKENNSSS!!!
---
Yeah you'll be completely fine lol that's not a big deal at all
---
Skeram fam UNITE! Friendship with Stalagg Ended, Skeram is my best friend
---
Then the friend has to waste a name slot.
---
Just practice creating your character a few times. It takes 15 seconds.
---
Anyone got one of these for priest?
---
Has anyone confirmed it's a bug?
---
 **| &lt;Shinku&gt; | Alliance | Skeram Est PVP | Semi-Casual/Hardcore |**
---
**Intro:**
---
&lt;Shinku&gt; is a newly formed guild preparing for classic release. I want amazing adventures and to see all content with a great community and friends. I am not your typical guild master as i will always will put you as the hero first and lead you to greatness. Whether it be leveling, raids, pvp, guild events, I want this community to pull together and thrive. 
---
**Recruitment:**
---
Looking for all classes/players, the more the merrier. Multiple groups and raid teams can amas. 
---
Please see discord for recruitment.
---
**My Expectations:**
---
* Have fun!
---
* Be respectful.
---
* Help others in the guild.
---
* Be prepared for whatever content we are doing, including understanding your role.
---
* Not everyone is a vanilla veteran, there is always learning to do in this 15 year old game.
---
**About me:**
---
I played hardcore beginning of BC through CATA with no vanilla experience apart from leveling on private servers. I used to have a famous weekly pug on my server which soon turned into my own guild and within the top 3 of the server being semi-casual/hardcore. We were not the best, but what we had was ambition and used our time efficiently to clear content and had lots of fun along the way. We all have a moment in wow of greatness with friends and the community that is bringing us back to classic to relive those days and nostalgia, tell me your story.
---
**Schedule:**
---
Raid days will be Tuesday/Wednesday 7:00PM - 10:00PM EST. (more days can be added if needed)
---
Off raid days will include dungeon/attunement runs and organized PVP.
---
**Loot:**
---
Loot council that will consist of 2 officers and 2 raid members that will rotate weekly. More info and adjustment to system once we start actually raiding. GM will not be included into the loot council unless a dispute is made. ( I don't have a group of friends in the guild, everyone will be new and on equal grounds come day 1).
---
Discord: Shokei#3546
---
Discord: https://discord.gg/p3vmqQ5
---
Will undoubtedly be an update within an hour before launch just like name res.
---
Let Stalagg keep the claw.
---
Replace it with a 12 pack of some soothing rolling rocks.
---
I can honestly say I'm laughing at the term "free-overtime", how do these guys not have a union yet.
---
Guides are great if you're trying to speedlevel or just be generally ahead of the pack. I feel like most people rather take a slow, steady and enjoyable journey and still be capped way before phase 2 hits.
---
its the SM full clear quest, you get a better two hand axe. for way less  time investment
---
i multiboxed in D3 and it was a pain.. just started leaving them at the entrance of the rift.
---
i could see /follow be easier but...
---
WTS: "Xo" on Stalagg for retail gold, or will trade it for an equally good name on Herod.
---
This is a really nice name.
---
Yo fuck Jintha'Alor. That place alone killed Hinterlands for me. That place is an elite hell hole in Vanilla.
---
Dude yes! Nobody ever mentions 1k. I used to love watching people autorunning and falling off the cliff. And the Shimmering Flats World pvp was awesome too
---
Cringe
---
No shit...
---
Bad idea. MS is an instant with much higher priority than HS or WW and boosts your damage far more than 5%
---
Is there one for hunter? 😍
---
* Stealth is slow as shit in vanilla
---
* Ambush requires the mob to be facing away from you, you can distract but that costs you energy and slows you down even more  
---
* Ambush doesn't do well against high armor/hp targets  
---
* Without ruthless and relentless your energy and cp is pretty shit
---
* You only get kidney shot at lvl 30, and even then it's only rank 1 so it's stun lasts for a second less at all levels
---
* You need imp backstab and opportunity to even make backstab better than SS
---
So you put all that together and combat swords is just always the build that makes sense if you care at all about the speed and efficiency of your levelling. You run in headfirst and spam SS/evis and things die. You get riposte/BF/adren rush that all help massively with annoying situations.
---
Any leveling guides in addon form?
---
Nah I just like being helpful.
---
This and Zinwrath were my jam
---
so that's why you were barely killable...
---
 Do we know how players who have gotten world first in the past did it? They probably aren't sharing the information I'd imagine.
---
**Darkshore**
---
Uh yeah, how else would you see the videos of the people wearing them lol
---
That doesn't make it easy though, it takes a long time to get geared, unless you're a main tank or something
---
You are wrong. Im gonna kill every alliance i see... except if they are 5 lvls below me. I dont gank lowbies.
---
Yes it’s in p1.
---
I’m a horde player, but deadmines is a better dungeon.
---
Would ofs destroy me lol
---
Spent a lot of days in that end getting fake drunk haha
---
Why on earth would you want to play there? You guys are absolutely insane to think Grobb is going to be a ghost town. Herod is going to be a complete shit storm. It's part of the reason Blizzard won't stop making new PVP realms.
---
The discord alone has like what, almost 6000 members?
---
I won’t be using any guide, i have my own idea of how its gonna go. I aint gonna let a guide dictate my experience, as long as i touch down in STV around level 32 im good ❤️
---
If only they could divide the realms up into several different layers... if only.
---
Name res was broken though, literally told players who were even a little bit late that they couldn't create a character unless an existing character had already been created.
---
I did yeah but I anticipate I won't be so fortunate with my layering this time round. I plan for worst case scenario not best,
---
As you and someone else said. You ABSOLUTELY should be buying ranks in revenge and demo shout if you have any interest at all in tanking dungeons while you're leveling.
---
My wife wants to heal so I feel obligated to play warrior.
---
FAP wasn't cheap to make if i remember correctly.
---
If it bothers you that much just drink a potion of swiftness, outrun them, and mount away.
---
Its also considerably cheaper to drink than FAP.
---
Deadmines is DM
---
VC is Vire Caul
---
Weird Thex*
---
Free to make fresh lvl60 and start TBC, pay to transfer your lvl60 from classic with all the cool mounts/titles whatever. Sound reasonable.
---
I don’t let myself question my decision anymore. I’d never make it to sixty
---
Any reports of this happening in the Classic beta?
---
I deleted my good name chars on herod and faerlina because fuck those servers. I'm a Skeram man now.
---
Im still trying to figure out if /r/ClassicBlaumeax or /r/Blaumeax is the right subreddit.
---
You guys think Superman plays ally or horde?
---
Was in the guild “Decepticons”, lost many a life to him!
---
 Kings honor!
---
These days people have way more options for games that are as or more addictive, and require less time commitment and tedious grinding from them.
---
I'm very curious to try this out, I played WoW at launch and quit before BC because of the core game design. I didn't come back until the drought of WoD when I was blown away how much better the game had gotten.
---
Except that they announce the realms and give ample time before the realms open to allow people to get ready. You take the risk of losing your name *because* you are switching realms. If you don't want to switch then don't.
---
delete this
---
Only time will tell we don't have those answers
---
How would you say the Ele Shamans do when they don’t get the jump? Can they still hold their own?
---
Might have to do the same.
---
It's not the same.
---
Joltin' Joe has left and gone away.
---
I don't really plan to hardcore raid this time around, so I'm using the opportunity to redo my very first character (Feral Druid) with the benefit of 1.12 as opposed to 1.6. A friend is bringing back their own Druid as Resto and we'll be leveling together. My build is focused on tanking so we'll run instances whenever we like, should be a hell of a team!
---
Outside of perhaps the first weekend I don't think either of us will be going ham, so it's going to be a nice slow journey. I'd say 2-3mths to hit Lv60 at a minimum. I'll be leveling professions as I go, and aim to farm for and make as much of my own gear as I can. Might not be fast, but it's satisfying!
---
Once I'm at Lv60 I won't be too worried about getting my epic mount immediately. Gathering professions aren't going to be the money maker they normally are when nobody has the gold to burn, so it'll happen when it happens.
---
Gonna do a lot of the stuff you mentioned. I did MC and Onyxia way back when, looking forward to the Onyxia quest because those loooong chains are what makes Vanilla great!! I don't recall if I ever did Hydraxian Warlords stuff previously, but I will now. I think I only ever had the Scholomance key, so I definitely need to get off my arse this time around and earn the others.
---
I'll run dungeons and slowly gear up to pre-raid BiS stuff. When it comes out I *may* take a crack at ZG, just because it's easier to organise and in my opinion is the best Vanilla raid.
---
Skeram fam reporting in
---
Grinding in the graveyard in Western Plaguelands
---
Both of you will be in Q having a character already made doesn't push you ahead of Q. He will just be making a character while you have yours made. Make sense? Lol
---
Zug Zug dontcha know?

And where TF do they think we can do about it? Even if 20% of us move to Mankrik, both servers are fucked anyway.
---
I got a pair on my warrior back in vanilla while leveling.... dont ask me what i did with it..
---
tbh if i was you id be worried about content creators getting the same idea
---
sitting in a queue for an hour or more does not get you many twitch primes
---
Ahhhhhh ughhh oghhh
---
how does that compare to marrowgrain?
---
The warrior raid sets are tank gear so not that hard to get for the tanks.
---
Such a high effort for a image, and it's utter shit and mostly waste of money for leveling.
---
I'm going to take your name. In all seriousness you'll be fine lol.
---
&gt;Stalag
---
alliance or horde?
---
.......Why in the hell would the player base drop off 90%?!?!?!? Are you high? And by the way, it wouldn't be 50k players. We have more than 50k players on Herod and it isn't even launch yet. There would be 200k players on each server if they didn't add any more like you suggested.
---
That’s meta as fuck
---
Oh thanks, I really wanted this mount so I didn’t know how fast I needed to reach 60 by lol
---
Karazhan crypts?
---
Can’t wait!!! I’m living in ironforge either way because it’s like home to me :)
---
Oh, wait. Now I remember. "Made by BTK." Yeah, I wonder whatever happened to that guy.
---
Then using that lens take a video of ragnaros’ image and he will appear
---
Sorry you’re frustrated. I think blizzard is doing a pretty good job here. It’s mainly Herod that’s the problem case. Apart from that they are opening more realms as previous ones fill. Maybe try deleting your worst character name and reserving a better one on a new server?
---
I'm 13 and played wrath so it's possible

I always called her lady blow me

Hello. Are you available for 24 hour first night push or no?

I'm a big boy I don't need gummy vitamins, I can swallow them whole.

You should probably take those guides with a grain of salt then. Your kill time is probably higher if you use dots but you gain back that time by not having to drink after every other mob.
---
I don't know how those guides can claim that "dots eat mana" when shadow bolt spamming is beyond inefficient, here's a quick example: 
---
Shadow bolt (rank 2) does an average of 29 dmg and costs 40 mana, that's 0.725 dmg/mana.
---
Corruption (rank 1) does 40 dmg and costs 35 mana, that's ~1.14 dmg/mana.
---
And corruption only lasts 12 seconds, there's not a lot of mobs that you'll be able to kill before it runs out, so use it and immolate as well. I'm not gonna test it but I'm sure CoA is also worth using.
---
Good luck playing with 12 hours of launch lol.
---
Wonder what Joe's reddit handle is and if he's reading this?
---
Same! I love all of the information, and will be using several guides as a baseline, but what I discovered during the stress test was that it's just more fun to fuck around and not really care. But it'll be good to be able to go, "Hmm.. I need to up some fishing and cooking, what recipes should I grab right now?" and other crap like that.
---
You know Blizzard will probably offer server transfer service right? Things can change and people can always transfer to another server.
---
hour?  nah.  more like 3 hours.
---
I’ve been alliance since forever so I can’t help
---
Sometimes dude will even give you his pants... wolves are no joke.
---
My son is turning 2 years old here in november..... during stress test, I streamed my desktop to the TV in his padded / gated play area in the living room and handed him a ps4 controller.  He was super excited thinking he was playing classic!
---
I don’t think it was implemented when the beta ended in july, I’m not sure about this latest beta though. I’m just basing it on how right click reporting works in retail. 
---
It’s easily exploitable and since communities are smaller in classic from lack of sharding and cross realm, it makes it way worse
---
The raid sets aren’t itemized the best so often gear is passed on
---
Thank you I almost forgot to do so many things on this list. Now I will be super prepared for classic
---
lol what? how is shadowmeld any good, cant even use it in combat and you have stealth you can move with as a rogue. sword skill is good for pve and escape artist saves you alot in pvp. saying racials dont matter is just straight up wrong. also i dont think wanting to have escape artist is called minmaxing, its just clearly better for pvp.
---
That was me too... but man I've been on the wow hype train so hard I dont really care. The last few leagues I've kinda just done the same thing. Farm to HH early then get bored. I think a league off will be good. Plus the next league after this one is their big 4.0 so hopefully taking a league off will reinvigorate me!
---
I imagine watercolor is pretty hard.  This ain't bad.
---
Forced name change.
---
yeah WoW mulitboxing is very similar to diablo3 without follow... you end up with players all over the place and its such a huge pain you just give up
---
I would train garrote, rupture and crip poison on a pvp server, good strat against warriors especially Orcs who can resist CS.
---
That's actually quite frequent in retail.
---
So it’s worth keeping?
---
Allow me to doubt your theory, for the following points;  
---
\- Worst case scenario, we get other pvp servers' best case scenario  
---
\- I doubt that many people will forego their place in the queue of their chosen server just to skip the initial queue. It would require a lot of last minute coordination without your guild and buddies.  
---
We might see a larger queue than what we would usually have, but it will not be on the scale of other pvp server my dude.
---
.... waiting 2 levels to get BF and AR for literally no reason? Skipping rank 1 crip poison? Fkn lmao this guide is moronic.
---
\&gt; Just wanted to know since I see a lot of videos with these with full armor sets from raids and idk it just seems pretty impossible. 
---
Can you not see the conflict in that statement?
---
It's more than likely that RP and RPPVP realms will be overall more stable populations, on top of that medium pop with layering is more than full pop from original vanilla. As someone who is going to play on grobbulus **I want it to stay at medium!**
---
Its possible it depends on how your guild dolls out loot.  If your a main tank or main healer you will see gear the fastest(assuming the gear drops) likely
---
Both of those links dont work
---
Prob that one night elf dancing on a mailbox in IF
---
This is one of the addons that should get banned. Hell it should have never been a thing on retail either.
---
What are going to hit 60 we're totally raiding low areas and destroying everything.  It's a thing lol.
---
I tried relogging and they still didn’t show. I’m sure they’re still out there somewhere cuz it says name taken but I just can’t access them for some reason.
---
Get flinstones then
---
If you helped random people back in vanilla, they'd often respond with an invite to their group. No good deed goes unpunished.

Why does it say the 27th when it's getting released on the 26th in Atlanta?

Trust me.. you are going to run the raid more than enough

Nope. Better off using viable names for reserving.

But in that time you get to feel special being asswipe and beating the badword filter that somehow didn't include asswipe.

I remember exploring zones to see them, but after a while it was mostly to get rid of the Fog of War and fill out the map.
---
Hunter/Druid both come with the highest skill caps to be competent vs other classes.  
---
On one hand you have the druid, which despite most peoples misgivings is actually a fantastic tank in the 1.12 version of game, and also one the highest dps in the game 1,100 or so (at a heavy time sink and consumable price using Manual Crowd Pummeler)  Due to the consumable nature of this they cannot sustain that DPS naturally though.
---
On the other hand you have the hunter, who is probably the single most interesting DPS asset class in game for pure utility reasons (special pulls, pets, etc etc).  And also one of the easiest/fastest to level with awesome pvp potential that comes at a very high skill cap to be truly good at.
---
Both classes however suffer heavily in reputation due to poor players and the reputations they garnered before the 1.12 section of the game.  So many people judge them on that, although incorrectly by class instead of player.  If your very good at the game, either class will be rewarding, but understand as stated before that others will judge you based on the class itself before even seeing you play.
---
If you pick druid, spend some time looking at Skarms information, as well as reading this.  Im sure someone has similar info about the hunter here.

Thanks for the correction, I wasn’t aware of that yet 👍

Huehuehuehuehue

Can someone ELI5 how some of these originally started? Like some you need to kill a boss in the dungeon to become attuned to that dungeon. How did the world first clear of that dungeon happen?
---
Sorry, I simply can't spell. I fixed it.
---
It might stand to reason that a large portion of those that will resub day of won't have any particular server in mind and just move to one of low pop.  If things get bad launch day then can spin up entire new realms in addition to new layers (obviously)
---
Damn it baby hold on I'm trying to do my totem quest for my Shaman!!
---
...by making smaller layers of players on each server, which can then be merged later when people leave. No reason there can't be dozens of layers on the same server to reduce queue times, unless the server infrastructure truly can't handle 100k people across 20 layers.
---
I am definitely interested.
---
How long will the pirate server tourists last until they decide they don't want to pay to play the actual game?
---
You said it’s a joke “but not really” and you continue to defend your “joke” as if it were reasonable. Tryhard obviously refers to trying as hard as you can within the rules of a video game to perform as highly as possible and achieve the highest level goals possible.
---
Huehuehuehuehue!

Are you guys dead set on a server though? Or will you just pick the lowest pop one you can?

Better hurry for a good name
---
Feral talents arent so good that they lock out catform from any other spec. The biggest talent is hearth of the wild. You arent that much slower if you keep gear for both specs.
---
We don’t know exactly, but I’ll give it my best guess.
---
1. They cannot be using concurrent player since the realms aren’t yet live. I assume they mean total accounts with characters on the realm.
---
2. Closer to the second one, but I think your numbers are off. They haven’t announced specific layering numbers. Based on what I’ve seen it will probably be something like 3k per layer, 5 layers per server for a total of 15k.
---
Lea &lt;Fury&gt; on US Medivh instantly came to mind. Her passing crippled the entire realm for a long time...
---
The White Castle followup was gold too. Definitely have a target audience lol
---
Hunters are needed in every single raid.
---
I played on an RP server in EU, it had plenty of High Warlords and Grand Marshalls, and a fair amount of groups got pretty far into Naxx.
---
If you want to level as kitty dps then yes, there will be conflict. If you level as heal, balance then no conflict.
---
There are some duo leveling guides, you should check them out.
---
I love the PvP in Felwood.  Run backs so long that I can kill someone, do a quest and then kill them again on my way out.

Same question

Pagle is the Alliance server and Alliance always has more PvE players

Cue music...

They'll always take a few hunters.  They've got 40 spots to fill.

That’s badass as fuck
---
it came out later than AV and WSG.
---
as a pagle resident, i wish i could, but i got a neat name on there and i've already moved once
---
Right there with ya. I've dabbled in other classes but I've played since the original launch (was 22 at the time in fact) and I've had players literally run up to me and start conversations with "holy shit dude" as I juggle 3 or more mobs using my pet, kiting, traps, and conc. shot.
---
It's extremely rewarding when you master a hunter. Hell, I remember for a while there when I figured out you could even double-freeze-trap enemies. 
---
You put down your trap and waited out the timer, once it was down to about 5-10 seconds before C/D finished you'd distract a mob into it, right as they hit, you'd drop the next trap. 
---
Bingo bango, two mobs CC'd for up to a minute.
---
They'll always need 2 or 3 of you for tranquilizing shot
---
Please praytell, when is basically a 1/5 extra MoD going to make a difference that great? Almost never. Compared to other racials that you will be using all the time, whether in PVE or PVP, it is effectively useless.
---
Thanks!
---
Don't think so at all, we haven't even seen half the numbers yet of people that are coming back.
---
beef jerky gives +10 stam and +10 spirit. bis for grinding out the leveling process
---
Are you trying to be top %1 pve raider? If not then don’t worry about it, it’s not significant and hunters still have a place in later raids
---
You only take hunters to raids for tranq shot, DPS wise they are as useless as rets and boomkins
---
Be reliable, on point with tranq shot, don’t do the stereotypical “hunters” mistakes and someone will be glad to have you.
---

---
All weapon types have the same parry chance, I believe if you dual-wield, then the weapon in your off-hand has an increased chance to be parried by the enemy.
---
Prob a gnome mage , but warriors can shit on anyone if you're good enough and brought the right consumes n shit, altho it's almost impossible while you're leveling, especially in the early levels
---
Don't get the hate you're receiving.
---
Being creative w/ how players choose their difficulty is great, but going through a menu to choose a difficulty setting has never impacted my enjoyment of a game ever.
---
Play whatever you want. People are seriously overestimating how many people are expected to live and die by the word of tryhards. People keep saying how easy Classic raids were but turn around and tell you not to play Enhancement Shaman or else you won't get invited. I say fuck it all and just play what makes you happy. You WILL find a guild, PUG or group to play with you. 100%.
---
You guys take busy peeps less than 30 that are just as weary? :)
---
I would prefer to stay on Azeroth and have more content/raids added, rather than reply TBC. Flying mounts killed WPVP in my opinion, which was a shame.
---
Umm Doritos
---
Not at all. It's not even noticeable. I World PVP'd on p servers within the 150 ping range and even that wasnt too bad. 
---
Google wow pvp with ping.. think youll find that most people say you're fine under 300ms. If cdew and venruki can play on EU servers from US and get to 2500 mmr I think we're fine.
---
gnome warlock will generally be a pain for mages and hunters
---
I was hoping he would say what server. Hard pass on streamer servers, but would totally be down for a Footclan server
---
Look up some guides on how to DPS well as a hunter, get your auto attack timer and rotation down and your DPS will be perfectly good, you will also have things that only hunters can do, like tranq shot when called.
---
&gt;And the Shimmering Flats World pvp was awesome too
---
On a private server I fought a 15 round battle against a warrior with his new shinny WW Axe.  Guy would not give up, despite the kill ratio being 10-5.  He was a very good PvPer and make questing terrifying as hell as he'd come out of no where when I was grinding.  Great fights.
---
There's little point to improved slice and dice in leveling...I would put that somewhere more useful.
---
im pretty sure most raids require hunters
---
Mankrik strong 💪
---
Just saw that there would be TW servers as well, dang. Those guys are beast mode at the game but my Mandarin isnt that great
---
Gonna go combat until hemo for that sweet pvp
---
ah dude dude dude dude dude. level 18 uhh hohhhhh
---
Those two classes together are great for pvp.
---
I mean to be fair the guild is probably like 15 people or so and we won’t be raiding together as a guild - so there’s that :p
---
We all have such wildly different schedules with children / time zone differences etc. Hopefully at least we can do battlegrounds together when the phase comes
---
No. You gotta realize that a lot of people who say this either never played vanilla or played with a mindset stuck in patch 1.9
---
You're very unlikely to ever top the charts... but this is because that's not your job. Your job is utility, kiting, crowd control, resetting, and then... after all that, dps. But just because you're not going to be topping the charts does not mean that you're not going to get invited or stop you from hitting like a truck. 
---
Just be warned hunters are probably one of the hardest classes to master. Easy to play... difficult to master. Which is why huntard was a thing.
---
But ya... "Ideal comps" are the work of people stuck in patch 1.9 or never played vanilla.
---
It's between Soo Lines and Canadian Pacific Plaza. I believe it's the parking ramp that also connects to the Westin
---
Going to do one for hunter ?
---
Sorry to burst your bubble but 4.0 isn’t until late 2020 possibly even early 2021 probably will be revealed at exilecon later this year but we for sure have at least 5-6 more leagues before 4.0

I just figured people aren't so stupid and or autistic that they could understand a little something called ***CONTEXT*** and then also redundancy, here let me show you.

Given Contexts:

---
-Private server game play
---
Posted too:
---
-Official classic WoW reddit
---
Context that ties together:
---
-Classic WoW.
---
Context that ties subject matters together in the given statement "Does anyone know if we will be able to shadowmeld eat death coils on live":
---
-Classic Private server video posted to Official Classic WoW reddit.
---
Context that does NOT apply anywhere in any of the above subjects:
---
-Modern retail WoW
---
Redundant and or not needed to be given statement":
---
-live in 8 days.
---
further explanation:
---
Everyone is literally here because offical classic launches in a week, why would anyone need to point this out again in a simple question, given *all the above contexts adding up together that could *NOT* possibly mean anything else (if you aren't retarded)*
---
I'm not asking *Siri* a question, I'm asking people who can actually *think logically (again given how everything adds up in the thread) instead of literally*

I'm with you. 10,000 person queue is insane. That's 3 full servers worth of players once layering is removed. The population would have to drop by 75% for that to make sense.
---
I think all of the servers that open before the game launches are going to be highly populated for a long time.

It's not an issue of unfair. Blizzard is letting players know the queue times will be high. The choice is with the player.
---
Reading is hard.
---
On private servers I ran into an endless number of NE hunters trying to gank me.  Personally, if I was going to be an alliance ganky rogue, I'd roll gnome.  Hard to click on, good racials, and it always hurts to have a cute and cuddly gnome murder me.
---
I work like 20 hrs a day of dragon con! Little depressed it's so close to classic launch but hey.
---
Absolutely. And there was no LoS either. So it'd be a real accomplishment to sneak up on someone.
---
I recall 2 mobs at once being way too deadly, i can hardly imagine using sweeping strikes.
---
Is fury really that bad for leveling? I remember having some nice success when switching to it back in the day. The healing from bloodthirst isnt super great but its still a nice to have. How bad is slam with a 2hander? Assuming you use it when an autoattack ends and focus rage on bloodthirst mainly.
---
Need to remember
---
I guess that depends on if you are in a guild and you get loot, I don't know how exactly what happens, probably some social crap like talking to people
---
I've always leveled with my wife ( a mage)  and it's been ok.   Never rolling against each other for gear.  Great cc.  A little longer to find dungeons because were 2 dps though.
---
Oh you're right! They said anytime after q1 2020.
---
1. Items will be different
---
2. Don’t play nighelf rogue... either human for pve or gnome for PvP.

Gnome helps vs mages a lot in PvP.

Otherwise it can be strong combo.

Deadmines, UBRS, all SM wings, Blackfathom Deeps, DM North are corridors. And those are amongst the best dungeons.
---
"Many" not every one of them.   
---
When they started working on TBC dungeons they checked which Vanilla dungeons were the most popular and they realized that while amazing BRD isn't exactly practical. 
---
BRD is my absolute favourite, but let's not pretend corridor design started with TBC.
---
Gm will disconnect you and when you try to login to the character, you'll get a message &amp; option saying you need to change name before logging in. This happened to me back in Vanilla when I had an alt letter in my name and it wasn't allowed back then.

Wow I somehow missed all of that news. This changes everything. Thanks
---
What are you talking about, it's the perfect setup for a great joke. Your friends are all waiting in Q for Herod, and you chime in saying "Hey, I'm in, awesome!" And they ask "WTF, what server are you on?" 
---
"Blow me."
---
The reality is that you might not get into the guild you want as a dwarf warrior tank. Thats just how it is. But you will definitely get into a guild and be main tank.
---
How do we know Herod is so overpopulated? I might be a little out of the loop. 
---
Won’t all the servers be full and have queues? What makes Herod so special here on reddit everyone seems to think there is gonna to be 9k queues forever.
---
Resto druid hybrids tend to bring the most to a raid group.  That said where most raids are bringing 40 people into the raid &amp; you're very unlikely to be pushing for world first... just play what you want.
---
I suggest warlock for alliance, druid for horde.
---
Paladin just to waste their time, shadow priest, get some FAPs for your warrior. Rogue and pop every cd you have, soul linked warlock.

Our guild deleted our Herod names to roll on Stalagg. We've got Skeram as a back up if Stalagg hits full.

I meant for bear. Not kitty.

It's down 15 minutes most weeks, and an hour once in a while. Big patches sometimes get an 8 hour downtime but normally just 15 minutes.
---
I told my guild to, and we reserved names.
---
It's wrong. Your Weapon's average damage matters, and nothing else. Classic is based on 1.12, Weapon Normalization is in place, it's been tested.
---
This sheet in general isn't accurate in several ways.
---
Just made the switch and my buddies are following along. I'm set on playing since I got 3 pretty desirable names: Stamina, Terpenes, and Enchanting
---
I believe the current record to 60 is just shy of 5 days played, so certainly more than 40 hours.
---
Considering boomer is used incorrectly by basically all of them.  I’ll be 36 about 2 1/2 weeks after classic, I’m sure I would get called a boomer and I’m at the far borderline of millennial.
---
Are there any that aren't terrible?
---
Devilsaur is amazing for any and every Fury Warrior and Fury dualwield/2H on Horde will be great because of Classic being 1.12 based.
---
Nobody knows.
---
Just pick a server
---
41 here. Was 25 by WoW launch
---
F my.life
---
Same!
---
I think for horde you get one in barrens around level 10 or 12. Which is good enough for when you start rfc. For ally, you generally don’t start dungeons till 18ish so you have plenty of time to get one
---
I watched his video and have read through Dives, guide. In all of them they say switching to VW for difficult quests or if you forces to fight many mobs at once is the thing to do. Even with the aggro problem VW is the safer although slower route, I am not racing to 60. Now that I have re watched multiple guides and read all the debates I am still leaning toward what I have on my background.
---
Here's a tip for leveling: When you log out you should log out inside of an inn. You'll get a rested bonus that gives 50% more xp when killing mobs.
---
Use notepad and make your own challenges.
---
Going priest so everyone will love me and invite me to everything.....
---
I'd guess that it doesn't matter.
---
Let me explain: Only one character on your account can be logged in at any point in time. They are accounting for the accounts active and intention to play, not the amount of characters made. If you made 1 character on 10 realms, you can only be on one of those 10 at any time, as such they know it's not 10 x the load but 1/10th of the "value" that each of your characters weigh in on what resources you are going to use or not.  
---
In my case, I've made 1 character on 1 realm, the value of that 1 character is very much an indicator that my account will be playing on that realm and so retains 100% of its value.
---
I hope this makes sense.
---
tl/dr estimated logged in accounts matter, not the total characters on any one account.
---
Swedes and nors understand eachother, danish understands them both but understand danish is usually harder for swedes ( speaking from experience, dont know what nors thinks about danish) but its usually fine speaking your language in the other countries 👍
---
Ive got Raidleader and Gruul
---
Probably troll but try 200 hours
---
Avg time is closer to 300 hours
---
fuckin lmao
---
why? because retail is paying for the development of new raids and tons of stuff that isnt happening for classic.
---
The difference is marginal at best.  And basically no guild will turn you down for being one or the other, they will turn you down for either sucking or being full on rogues.  Don't overthink the decision and play what you want.
---
Top levelers can do it in 96 hours.
---
Most good players are 110-144 hours.
---
Some people take as long as 240 hours.
---
This looks more like Brand if you are talking about League of Legends.
---
dont buy trash off the auction house leveling save up all you can , have one person go tailoring for bags (they can change later if they like)
---
maybe one person level skinning and just vendor everything but this can feel a bit slow 
---
leveling will be 1000x more fun with a friend
---
you will need to kill more stuff but 1-30 feels very slow for most classes, with a friend it will feel faster.
---
any collection quests that have a low drop chance and say you cant get 10 of something in 30 kills just skip it.
---
you should probally only level the characters together 
---
both make an alt and just level that while the other person is not on
---
leave it in an inn for rested xp
---
I'm so jealous of the older dudes right now, if you're retired you can play classic nonstop!
---
It's really hard to predict. Also, the ignore function is bliss.
---
You certainly won’t be aoe leveling on launch lol
---
Aka garrison missions lol

I can't answer all these but I can tell you for a fact levelling with a healer (or even just multiple characters as a group) will be many times faster than solo, especially for classes like warrior or rogue. The only class where I would say a group would be similar speed would be a hunter who knows optimal routes for levelling.
---
Tryhards have to questie because others questie and that is the meta if they want to hit max with other tryhards they'll have to. So if you don't load up all the autocompletes and destination markers you aren't trying hard I get it I get it. Besides they prolly already did a good amount of these quests this post I think was for first time players.
---
It's just fucked though, blazing past that walmart greeter and running straight to another employee to get the next quest.. And then not even letting him talk! As soon as he points, bam, youre off to Westfall without caring at all about what he has to say about the Defias Brotherhood..
---
I'm really happy seeing the turn around on Classic+/post-naxx content on this sub.
---
...yeah so it's inaccurate because the best they can do is approximate... what's your deal man lol why are you so caught up in the semantics of what we're tlaking about?
---
It's a huge benefit for them to make the game out to be more popular than it is because hey, then more people want to play it because it looks a lot more popular than it is.
---
Its 5% on your total though, not base? Its actually a nice chunk of intellect apparently, extra crit and mana is nice.
---
dont die
---
No changes! So they better be!! /s

I'm thinking a druid rogue hunter warlock warrior shaman priest paladin or something. Maybe a demon hunter.
---
Alliance Herod | Bear druid looking for people without much free time who are interested in 5 man dungeon grinding to 60. I work 9-5, so ideally the other players in the group would too, but I would like to establish a regular schedule where we grind dungeons together to level, and we can all level other characters outside of the schedule. Should be roughly 100ish hours to 60. If we schedule 25ish hours a week, we could be 60 in a month.
---

---
You’ll share mob xp but will be able to crush every quest you come across. So it’ll balance out up until the dreaded 56-60 grind.
---
Fury till 40, then respec to arms for motral strike. Do not dual wield unless you find copious amount of hit gear.
---
Yes, you’ll be able to tank as fury/arms. Just be sure to have a one hand sword and shield.
---
Every server will have toxic players.
---
That seems like a great macro if you want to normally show your helm but hide it when you equip your rocket helm.
---
I’ve been waiting for this one!
---
Try to stay alive.
---
Already Moved guild to Skeram; I’m sure it will be full by release date; remember the demographics survey; more than 50% of people are waiting till release to sub.
---
Someone made a post about how we’ve all been in the car together too long, too true. But that doesn’t make this any more false. Couldn’t agree more, I don’t really feel excited as much as I feel relieved that it’s back. Missed it dearly.
---
Really? Are there any actual server locations listed? Chicago would be perfect but I didn't expect them to call it eastern
---
Don't leave Stalagg PepeHands
---
I managed to get Stamina and Enchanting, where you at?
---
World record 1-60 /played is 4 days 20 hours I think. So longer than your estimate by a lot.
---
Celery and peanut butter, and dark (around 75-80%) chocolate. Water to drink. You don't want to fill up on heavy carb foods when you're at the desk. These foods are about as easy to prep and eat as they come, but are far healthier than your average off the shelf snack. Fiber, protein, sweetness, and some caffine, all in a relatively low calorie, easy to prepare, easy to eat, and easy not to overbinge on, package.
---
yeah and I clicked on that button two more times and the error disappeared and my character was done
---
If you are in the US-Eastern Timezone, WoW Classic servers will launch at 06:00 pm.  If possible try to log in at 06:00 sharp. If you're on a full server and log in afterwards you'll likely be in a que.
---
I’ll have to reconsider it, because I do love the WC3 night elf story. They’re a little more savage and wild than they seem to get treated today. I have been considering rolling a priestess of the moon

Because others do judge you. Thats just a fact, no matter what we want to be true. And a lot of bosses judge you by your hobbies. Some will just simply never promote you because of a hobby they deem to be a dumb way to spend your free time.
---
I just turned 70. I played old vanilla because my son wanted to play and I wanted to see what it was about. And of course got hooked. 
---
We're both returning after several years of not playing. Should be interesting.
---
Yeah, very true.
---
I downvoted you just cus
---
It's not shadowmeld per say but night elves get a higher stealth level so they are harder to detect. At least I think that's what hes referring to.
---
Which is the piece of crap?
---
1 hour queue, how optimistic.
---
WAND, everyone forgets that using wands is actually important to reduce the amount of time you have to spend drinking..
---
5 second rule means that you actually want to stop casting every now and then and pull that wand out of your pocket, it even deals pretty good damage if you get a higher level one.
---
This is what people tell themselves to justify playing a queue simulator instead of WoW.
---
Newsflash: *Every* server they have currently announced is going to be filled to the brim. They will all have events. Most are *already* full except RP realms, just launch the game and look for yourself.
---
Dual wield tanking you can still swap to a shield and press shield block if you need to mitigate dmg!
---
Whats up with EPL at 330 req?
---
Yes but for much shorter times. An hour or 2 at most.
---
Just made the switch!

I thought I was going to be slick and go re-download the Curse addon installer complete with a login I remembered from a decade ago.  And then I find...Curse is no more...
---
Yet for some reason Curse was changed into Twitch, which was news to me, and now is just streaming and no addons anymore...what has become of this world?
---
Not 40 hours. Not 40 hours at all. I expect to take a few months. Playing ~10 hours a week
---
Not really, they clearly need more servers is the real issue.  Servers are filling up before launch, can't even imagine what they will be like when it actually launches.  what are they going to do, release servers on launch day when no one can log into anything lol
---
Record is 4 days /played I think?  
---
So, it's more like 100+hours.
---
Don’t play regular wow , just going to sub for classic so I don’t see a reason to waste sub time lol
---
Plus my name is unique and it has never ever been taken in any of the mmo I played in the last 20 years
---
Alliance | Whitemane | Semi-Casual | Loot Council
---
Infinity was originally a guild on Bloodscalp during Classic WOW. I am recreating the guild to allow all the Infinity Members a place to join and play together.
---
We will also be a place for new people who may not have the time to invest all week to play due to real life commitments. As many of us use to invest countless hours into this game 15 years ago we are looking to take it casual this time and enjoy the game while still clearing raid content.
---
Our guild includes raiding experience from Vanilla, TBC and WOTLK.
---
Guild members will be a wide age range who value the time they have to be able to experience this game. If you are toxic, rage, do not listen or just have the ability to piss people off do not expect to stay with us very long.
---
Raiding - Recruitment:
---
While the guild is set to be casual we will still have expectations for you to bring all consumables needed to raid.
---
Currently all classes/specs are open for recruitment and can submit applications at our discord recruitment channel
---
All classes and spec are welcome to join.
---
Raid schedule:
---
Saturday = 8:00am EST to 12:00pm EST
---
Sunday = 8:00am EST to 12:00pm EST
---
Goals and expectations:
---
With casual player base in mind we expect that most players should hit level 60 after a period of 4-6 weeks. Raiding will start once we have at least 35-40 members at 60 which would be around mid/early October.
---
We want you to play the game however you want to, as long as you are competent in what you are doing. However if you are playing a class which have the ability to offheal/offtank, it would be nice to step up and do the right thing if the situation calls for it.
---
Loot system:
---
As expectation is semi-casual loot system will be loot council as the only items that should be disenchanted constantly is shadowstrike.
---
Gear is just a means to the end and our priority is to kill bosses.
---

Winterspring was my favorite vanilla WoW zone. Pain in the ass to get to and kind of tucked away, so always very underpopulated. Fantastic atmosphere. I do love wintery zones though.
---
Haha, no. The official record is something like 4 Days 20 hours playtime from Joana (Horde Hunter.. google for his guide)
---
RUMORS. Just roll what server you want to play on and stop it with all this over thinking non sense. Every server is going to have some sort toxic group of people. There is no way to predict these behaviors ahead of time since communities don’t really form until people actually play the game. I’m rolling on Whitemane and I’m going to do my part to make it a positive experience for people who play there.
---
Surprised they are so dead. I wonder if not a lot of people saw the new realms announcement.
---
Leveled on the stress test as night elf. Between that guy and Zenns bidding, there are some definite collision points.
---
Skeram..
---
Not trolling, just have a very foggy memory of leveling 15 years ago. :)
---
Please just don't forget water :)
---
My group has switched to Stalagg. If there are any queues on launch we will go anywhere where we (hopefully) don't have to wait too long to play
---
Just don't forget to buy those resurrection ranks at level 60.. God I hate being ressed by rank 1 spells.. Especially since it's the same mana cost for them.
---
Thinking addons are only for nolifers.. lol
---
I'd say somewhere around 200 hours of played time. Even following a guide you'll need to do some research and learning your abilities and how the game works.
---
Everyone knows blaumeaux is the place to be

Sweeping Strikes is going to probably out damage an under geared fury warrior in dungeons considering the ridiculous amount of trash.
---
Where are they pulling all these names from. One day they'll run out of names relevant to vanilla that aren't already in use in retail.
---
Auction House
---
path of exile manages it.  and plenty of MMO's with subs only to unlock endgame as well.  Eventually blizzard will adopt a less greedy model
---
200 is a good ballpark. My first 60 was about 240hrs-300 hrs played
---
It's early. Give it a few days.
---
Stone form really has some handy utility while leveling. Also a great counter to rogue poisons for PvP.
---
Does Azeroth auto pilot work??
---
I normally avoid world pvp against people lower level than me, as it's not really a fair or fun fight
---
I did use everything on the stress test, everything in pic came from guides I read , 2 had that so I thought I would check it out. I am not min maxing, just want to get out of the starting area fast.  There is a ton of info and a lot of it conflicts each other, 2 new guides that came out in the last week specifically for classic pretty much go against each other. I just made this so I can keep track of everything so I don't skip upgrades to spells I need or class quests.

---
It’s really best to go stumbling through it clueless. 
---
The only suggestions I would offer is:
---
1.) figure out what kind of role you want (healer, dps, tank etc.) not all classes can fill all roles, and not all specs are optimal for 40 man raids. General rule of thumb is, if the class has a heal, they are expected to be a healer. 
---
2,) you can customize your UI using addons. Some ones of note are bartender4, and perfectraid. 
---
3,) don’t stress about race choice. Pick what you think looks cool. 
---
4,) for the love of all that is holy, use keybinds for your abilities. Do not be a clicker.
---
40 holy DPS sounds awfully low for SoC procs? What do you base that number on? Remember that it also crits fairly often at that level thanks to all the retri talent buffs.. And it also deals more damage against stunned / incapacitated targets
---
Cleave is even worse than Heroic Strike unless you're attacking 2 mobs, which you shouldn't do unless you're over-geared for the level and have sweeping strikes/whirlwind.  Cleave is also an "on next attack swing" ability, just like Heroic Strike.
---
Because most people that make an account will be from retail.
---
How chat works. There are lots of different channels and colors that represent different types of chat. It's a lot to go into I'd recommend checking out a guide on it. I'm sure they probably exist.
---
I really don't.
---
Even if every single one of those things was true, those communities would be a small fraction of everyone on the server.
---
Do whatever you want, but the Mane Gang is here for you when you decide to convert.
---
Take it slow. Read the quests. Look up; some areas are beautiful. Throw buffs on random strangers when you cross paths in the wild. Group with people questions in the same areas. Remember that behind every character is a player.
---
&gt; feral dps is real **bad**
---
FTFY
---
I raided as a hunter in vanilla.  In MC we raided wit 4 or 5 hunters and by Nax we only ran with 2. In Nax I didn't feel weak but I was not top of the meters.

Balance in PvP has the wrong icon IMO. 30/0/21 is one of the best wPvP builds and well, it's considered a balance spec

---
Yes it’s total. People have done the math and even in raid gear it translates to about 0.3% crit and some mana. It’s something I guess but basically nothing. I’d rather have the diplomacy racial to help me grind out all those reps in Vanilla, which can potentially also translate to a dps increase.

Nope, only through flight paths. The Horde has no equivalent of the Stormwind/Ironforge tram. We need to ~~kidnap gnomish slave laborers~~ research some industrial technology ASAP.
---
The best bank alts in the Horde are orcs or trolls who have easy access to Orgrimmar, the capital with the best bank-to-AH layout.

Take it professions would be mining, smithing, fishing or something to that extent? Any profession you would recommend? Mining sounds good for gold haha

---
&gt;Here's a tip for leveling: When you log out you should log out inside of an inn. You'll get a rested bonus that gives 50% more xp when killing mobs.
---
ooh thanks i forgot about that
---
My first character that had all those mechanics but it was in BC I thought?? Idk but I didn’t level him very high
---
Start thinking about saving money for your mount right from the start. Don't waste gold on spells you don't NEED. Don't be afraid to join up with people and make new friends, the community in my experience has been awesome. 
---
I am incredibly envious of you. I would do anything to go back in time and experience my favorite game all over again for the first time. Enjoy it friend!!
---
In my experience: Priest, Pally, Non Frost Mage, Rogue.
---
It's a world BOE drop. You'd have an easier time getting them by no life farming for a week and offering all of that gold to the first person that finds them.
---
I’m planning on taking vacation 1-2 weeks after as well. Don’t want to be off work raging over not being able to play haha. What will I do play RuneScape?! Fuuuuck

You give Blizzard way too much credit

This is the correct answer.

Pretty set on going a dwarf or gnome rogue, because I really love the feel of how they cross terrain and attack animations.
---
Most probably a night elf priest because I love the look and lore of it, such a beautiful combination (even though I’m sure I’ll have to make a macro telling people to leave me alone cuz it’s not a dwarf priest xD)
---
Step one hit sixty
---
I am I the only one wondering how you use a keyboard with those?
---
I never had any issues in vanilla tanking dungeons as a fury warrior. I always carried a shield/sword for swap.
---
see you around bro :)
---
haha you found the mobile user ;)
---
You have a pretty mouth
---
Just so you know, I believe king is on the restricted list as they didn't want titles in peoples names. There's a site somewhere where you can verify, I don't have the link unfortunately.
---
and that's more like the average private server player that has done the leveling many many times. I bet the average come vanilla will be 10+
---
Man. This is game is messing with my head already and i havent started. Maybe i can get over my dota addiction and replace it with a wow addiction

---
I am not changing anything after all, reading dives and watching a video on drain tanking and reading some other forum posts, I am still going to use VW for questing and whatever is most useful for each dungeon. I am not racing to 60. Only thing on there I think I would remove is the not using DOTs before 10.
---
Much of the issue with warrior leveling lies in the fact that they're basically just auto-attacking their way all the way to the late 30s/40. You have some offensive abilities, but none of them bring any major damage except for cleave which exacerbates the health issues. Compared to other non-casters you have rogues with plenty of extra damage from instant attacks etc, hunters with their pet damage, shamans with their instant spells (and strong weapon buffs) and then paladin which is sorta on the same level as warrior.
---
Duoing with a healer absolutely makes things better, as you can continuously pull multiple mobs for cleaving without any worry about taking too much damage. And once you hit 30 and get Sweeping Strikes wrecking ball mode will be engaged. And speaking of specs it's pretty much the other way around. Fury is better solo against single targets, while Arms is vastly much better when grouped and able to utilize aoe skills like Cleave, Sweeping Strikes and Whirlwind with no inhibitions.
---
Chicharones!
---
Is it because when you are dead you are missing our on leveling and completing quests. Or do you lose gold when you die?
---
I made the move.  I’m working on assumption that all of the pre-launch servers are going to have very high populations once the masses join.
---
This assumption with the fact that Herod is probably “too” populated and not every streamer agreed to leave the Herod alone made the decision easy for me.
---
And the guy who set that world record said it could probably be optimized to about 80 hours. Depending on game knowledge the average time is about 170-180.

---
Layering doesn't remove queuing. There isn't going to be infinite layers per realm. Layering can only increase a realm's population by a multiple of x (probably like 3-5 layers per server).
---
so when blizzard is saying expect queue's of 10k+ that means 10k+ people will be expected to be trying to get online than there 3-5 (or whatever number it is) layers can hold.
---
all of the realms with at least medium pop are going to be balanced, don't worry
---
You literally just shit in my breakfast. Why on earth wouldn't they play? It was one of the most entertaining parts of the beta.
---
rogue will be getting one for combat rogue leveling as well! we just didnt have time to add the rogue changes today
---
Warriors get more toys for actual tanking, but druids are *way* more fun for leveling and soloing, and they're great dungeon tanks. Druids' raid-tanking potential varies from fight to fight and based on gear.
---
I'd recommend the last output being changed to:
---
Dodoni rolls 5, 6, and 2
---
Unless that is you require a character, such as "a," in between: ",t,", a ",t," and the other segments.
---
I mean i dont really see the problem if you think about it:
---
1. The people who are high enough level to kill lowbies arent wasting there 18 hour a day for 9 days straight advantage by turning around and killing people 20-30 levels lower then them
---
2. The people who are doing that will level slower meaning they will be at your level aka. Its a fairish* fight.
---
*if they have more people your gonna get dunked on, vice versa if you have more people in the area you are gonna dunk on them
---
Nobody took your name. You can't have "King" or similar titles at the start of a name, they're on the restricted list.
---
You can get work with friends or guildmates to corner and kill someone on an epic ground mount however once someone flies 50 yards in to the air there is nothing you can do and they can just follow you watching you until you are alone to drop in and kill you again.
---
Hey, I just got reminded by the bot :)

Will kep that in mind. I assume the lvling bonus drags over from when you wake up
---
My Undead Mages name was just Death (age 11)
---
Original AV had super overpowered NPCs, that's why a lot of them are on this list. It wasn't until later that they finally got nerfed.
---
You'll miss out on the reputation discount for your mounts. Only downside I can think of.
---
I can’t get him to appear
---
Multi-pull, hot up and go bear for swiping groups down. Works similar to pally aoe grinding.
---
What? Pets had different attack speeds in classic if I recall, broken tooth had the lowest at 0.77 or something. There has to be a reason why I wanted 6 nights in a row for this damned cat.
---
It does matter. You see a certain player's name, you form rivalries.
---
Yeah if u don't want to get ganked i really don't suggest rppvp
---
swipe doesn't have an added threat modifier on pserver, so as long as it's doing the same damage as it always did, it's working the same.
---
In didnt know armiur damage existed. Im guessing ill play healer. I just assume there will be a lot of dos/tanks.
---
Keeps changing, was whitemane then rolled over to fairbanks.  I think final move to blaumeux and we'll stick there.  Just can't get my names until I get home from work in an hour.  So if you go there you know you've got at least one available.  I'll be 8 hours a night starting about 11:15 central every night.  Only tue-thur off first week to hit it real hard those 3 days but 8 hours a day after that.  No guild plans pre 60 yet, just join a leveling guild or something.
---
Sir this is a Wendy’s
---
I believe the number is 7 for demo shoot.
---
World record is 4 days 20 hours 50 mins. Or 116 hours-ish.
---
yeah, but its like 30mins-1hr these days unless its a patch
---
I like that idea a lot - will make sure to give you credit if I use it :)
---
yeah the only reason i say level together is just because if you get like 5 levels different you will want to quest 1 zone and they will be in the old one
---
The Witcher/WoW crossover confirmed /s
---
We'll lose 60-70% of people before level 40. There are going to be ALOT of tourists. 
---
That said, I think the long-term pop will be higher than most think.
---
Thanks so much man!! So much info to take in. People have been awesome in this sub.
---
Hahaha well when you can’t decide just pick something else..  being able to summon is super useful though
---
Kitty dps should be neutral
---
Honestly achievements and titles (not mounts) and maybe the occasional bit of vanity gear (silly) like a helmet or tabard would be one of the first things I would add for Classic+ and an excellent way of adding content without breaking the design philosphy of the world. Things like fully exploring the entire map or recognition for 500,000 hks would be great.
---
Lol that's not how they work somebody explain it to him I've done it enough today
---
1.5 levels if you're logged out for 7 real days. That's the max. It makes a big, big difference at lvl 45+ because the experience required stacks so high that it'll take you 8+ hrs per level
---
There is not much great synergy from a damage dealing perspective but there is a lot of survivability synergy.
---
Personally I think a lot of people going into WoW know what they are getting themselves into. With that said I bet many who have only played retailed over the last few years will try it and hate it.
---
I see. Thanks man. Yea we want to lvl together
---
Keeps changing, was whitemane then rolled over to fairbanks. I think final move to blaumeux and we'll stick there. Just can't get my names until I get home from work in an hour. So if you go there you know you've got at least one available. I'll be 8 hours a night starting about 11:15 central every night. Only tue-thur off first week to hit it real hard those 3 days but 8 hours a day after that. No guild plans pre 60 yet, just join a leveling guild or something.
---
This ^ ..wondering too.
---
You will miss out on certain quest rewards that are usable the entirety of the game, you will miss out on full reputation gains from quests, you will miss out on gear from dungeons and quests while leveling, you will miss out on many of the games experiences along your journey. That said play the game however you want, i'd recommend doing it in bursts when you get new ranks of spells like blizzard.
---
Man these are priceless. 
---
Imagine your grandchildren laying eyes upon these as they clean your attic 70 year from now. "Grandad was such an autistic person... I MEAN ARTISTIC PERSON!"
---
Could be. That's just from my own experience and I may not have leveled in the most optimal way with my priest.  I leveled every class besides Shamans &amp; Warlocks to 60 in vanilla and I found Warriors to be faster than Fire Mages, Pallys, Priests, and Rogues.  Though with my rogue I spent so much time PvPing that it's probably not far comparison.
---
There is no linux version of wow, so you're going to have to use wine.
---
Its not going to be good.
---
Just remember that if you feel like you are having a bad time leveling slow or getting ganked a lot, it gets much much worse.
---
A PVP server is a PVE server with FUN enabled* 
---
Fixed that for ya!
---
With a pocket heal I would go prot.
---
Arms is doable - fury needed a lot of hit which was rare on low items (if I am not mistaken).
---
With better gear you don‘t need to get that deep into prot (if you manage aggro). The less dmg you take and the better you manage aggro gives the shaman time to do dmg and you kill mobs way faster.
---
Yeah! This is the vanilla I want!
---
Started  playing in 2007 because of the free sample of WOW that came in South Park season 10 dvd.  I remember having to have reagents for portals and thing like that too
---
Thanks man
---
Remind me of that LITrpg world tree online  lol
---
But r/Skeram already exists and has more people.
---
Repairing gets expensive and corpse running can be a real pain especially when the mobs respawn. You can only manage 1-2 mobs at your level range with full health. 3 with cooldowns
---
Anyone who tells you it's one button in raids is trolling. You'll press at least all four directions.
---
Unfortunately it is mages biggest drawback in raiding. Warlock suffers the same issue. Mage is fun in dungeons due to lots of variation, CC, AOE, etc, but raids is just mass conjuring food and water, people randomly opening trade windows for it, and then pressing frost bolt. 
---
Most classes have dull rotations in Vanilla but mage is pretty much as dull as it gets :/
---
pelvic thrusts?
---
I was actually excited to get my name and burned a token early for tonight's server release. My buddy has been trying for a name on every realm and had to work tonight, so I did him a solid by snagging both of our names right when the server opened.
---
Not even 15sec went by after the server opened and I was only able to get one out of the two names. Needless to say my buddy is happy af and I'm still content with the backup name I had.
---
Yeah, maybe we do after all.
---
Yeah, I don't believe her. Get Blammo'ed.
---
Lmao
---
The only guide I'm using is to get every dungeon quest and attunement quest. Besides that I'm just gunna enjoy the ride at my own pace.
---
They were playing on NA servers from London, and their ping was good enough to do world 1st mythic raid progression.
---
Its called an abbreviation you mongoloid
---
Because people with less difficulties in their way are more likely to do something. Non-retail people had to create a subscription, retail people had to just log in.
---
I still play my original resto shaman from vanilla in retail and I'm remaking him for classic. Resto Shaman through and through
---
You have these names? Ive been looking everywhere for paul.  Taledar#1305
---
MARTA ain’t bad but it makes the kennesaw state busses look like a private jet
---
All the Emerald Dream bros gonna take over Grobbulus be ready.
---
this comment made me feel exactly the same way
---
You could do something similar on PvE, just toggle PvP when you want to fight and toggle PvE when you want to chill.
---
I think you need to look at the group you are sampling from to understand the reasonings behind the abrupt deaths in the community.
---
Video games don’t require a ton of physical exertion, so naturally anyone that has pre-existing conditions where they cannot exert themselves physically will play video games for enjoyment. Due to this, you’ll have individuals with health issues added into your population with low life expectancies.
---
Then we go on to the mental health state of affairs for players. We can say that a good amount of us escaped our RLs for Azeroth, due to problems at school, family, etc. this causes an elevated level of depression leading to higher than normal suicides within the community.
---
Finally, we get to that the community ranges in age a ton and you truly don’t know how old that person is that was talking to you on ventrilo in ‘04. I had a guy in my guild who was 62 and I thought he was 22 because his voice still sounded youthful. Is he still alive? I’m sure, but I wouldn’t bet on it.
---
This creates a microcosm of unexpected deaths in a relatively small community that would appear to be elevated than other communities. I don’t think it’s truly out of the norm once you better understand the community that you are surrounded by.
---
What the hell was that
---
You’re right, I looked up the run I was thinking of and it’s been proven the server it was done on had flawed xp rates so I guess Joana still has it
---

---
2 rules for men taking selfies:
---
1. Dont
---
2. Put the phone down
---
...maybe...:)
---
Probably the best advice. Your in-game rep will follow you. Treat others like you want to be treated and it'll pay dividends!
---
With no interactions or video game atmosphere at all. Just want a game that punches itself in the face and gives us free epics.
---
Said no one, ever.
---
You dont lose gold but its almost always 10+ minute walk back to your body. Or you can take res sickness and not be able to fight anything. Im fairly new as well and I've found 3 enemies at once is too many lvl 1-20 lol
---
What about Onxyia?
---
Lol? Priest is one of the faster classes to level.
---
Classic WoW is TOS Star Trek.
---
Post-Cata is JJ Abrams Star Trek.
---
You’ll get gear from questing and running dungeons, too. For the most part you don’t really need to actively search out best in slot gear while leveling.
---

Just 1 account. Really weird it makes them vanish when I create or delete another character. Submit a ticket for it so should hear back
---
Enhancement is trash. This video was just some dude rambling for 24 min about nothing.
---
I know this is a wow sub but damn did literally no one get the nfl reference?
---
\&gt;  And it wasn't shit in TBC   
---
Swipe was shit, tho. If you wanted aggro on three, you did an initial swipe and then you tab lacerated and built the stacks.

The guy she tells you not to worry about.

Nagas weren't a thing yet... But, being left handed was... Don't know if that's what's up with it but I hope so :).

Would be an honor to have someone sing it, but maybe wait until all 12 are done? I timed this poorly and the last post will actually be on 8/25 - which gives you a chance to record and post on 8/26 (day of launch)
---
Why does that only apply to skeram
---
What are these world buffs you're talking about?  First I've heard of them.
---
Could you send it to me too please
---
Yep, I can show you if you want, I'm not at my pc right now, do you have discord? pAUL#6959
---
His 1k dps says otherwise!
---
more dots i guess
---
I did very well as a ret Paladin and I don't think I was a very skilled player. I think it's the class that benefits most from engineering. Invest in that and you might find yourself to be quite a force.
---
Be carefull tho. If you wipe in a dungeon some toxic aswholes may blame you for that:). Healer = a lot of responsibility. If you arent sure play some dps first to learn the basics. Also keep in mind that most classes can perform more than 1 role (eg priest can both dps and heal depensing on his talent build).
---
That's cool! Leveling another Pally in classic!?
---
I took Tuesday off, I only had 3.5 days left for the year. That’s enough time for me to play all night (launch at 6PM) straight through the next day and then pass out around 8PM Tuesday night to get up and drive to work the next day.
---
maybe in game time, but you are going to have less effective playtime/day because very very very few people will actually have a reliable consistent 5 man team that can play 5+ hours straight every day
---
I mean, for a serious guild there isn't a reason to bring more than one feral druid. You don't have them MT, and they are kitty/off heals most of the encounters.
---
Where else would new players go?
---
All the other NA servers are full and will likely have a queue.
---
It's crit, 1 AP and dodge.
---
It seems you have never read Flintlocke's Guide to Azeroth?
---
[http://flintlocke.thecomicseries.com/](http://flintlocke.thecomicseries.com/)
---
Yes, because they're an agi class with multiple skills that only scale with spell damage. Pets also don't scale well. That said, they're still good enough to get invited, just don't expect to be beating the other dps classes all too often. They have utility outside of pure damage.
---
Some sort of modified DKP. Straight dkp is pretty problematic (hoarding etc) but there are some good dkp systems. 
---
My live guild has just rolled on stuff for years now, what did retail guilds use before forced personal loot?

The raid fights are more than just the buttons you press.  Every class is pretty boring if you look at it that way.  Doing the dance you keep be using instants while you run, blink is awesome for movement heavy fights.  Got the wrong charge? Blink to the other side.  Too many stacks on horseman? ... blink away.  During trash control your cc.  Maybe a key frost nova to save that lock next to you that pulled aggro.  Damage is just 1 thing you do in raids.  And 1 button damage is one thing you do when you have a single target and you don't have to move.  Many fights make you move
---
It seemed to work ok with random people back in the day.
---
You can tank AoE adds that's about it. Cant hold aggro good enough for single target I dont think
---
Stuck in the same spot Mjolnirr.....here's my breakdown. First and foremost - pick the look you will enjoy long term, I cant stand trolls because their feet. Myself - debating between Tauren or Orc Hunter.  
---
**Orc -** If your going to be spending time wPVP and Battlegrounds, the stun resist is going to be key. Pair that with pet damage and not too shabby. The bloodlust cooldown is dull for hunters.....melee damage increase (i plan on kiting not melee) and 50% reduction in heals...ouch.  
---
**Tauren** \- 5% stam will help add a little extra health and make you slightly tankier (slightly!) pair that with warstomp and you have a nice little out to wing clip someone and exit to save yourself and reset. However, larger target, and I could care less about herbalism. I dig their vibe and history though. Am I really at a loss not having the 25% stun?  
---
**Troll** \- If you really wanna be a min/maxer (cause everyone's pro apparently) lol this is most likely your optimal PvE spec - your cooldown increases attack speak for more shots. 5% beast damage is ish comparatively and again their damn feet.  
---
**Alliance** \- Well....... I just dont play Alliance. I track them and kill them =)
---
being on reddit is bias, the overwhelming majority of the playerbase doesn't go on forums and many of them don't even know classic is coming yet and will find out when it comes out
---
I'm hijacking the top comment to add six more. These have either come up in the comments or are just useful to know.
---
\*\*Show/Hide Helm/Cloak\*\*  
---
/run ShowHelm(not ShowingHelm())  
---
/run ShowCloak(not ShowingCloak())
---
These will toggle showing and hiding your helm and cloak. Feel free to split it into two macros. You can tie them to abilities, like showing your helm when you enter defensive stance, or hiding your helm when you equip a specific helm, like goblin rocket helmet. 
---
\---
---
\*\*Sheath/Unsheath\*\*
---
/run ToggleSheath()
---
This macro toggles your weapons like hitting the Z key. Unlike the Z key, you can target specific actions. ToggleSheath(1) stows your weapons, 2 draws your melee weapon, 3 draws your ranged weapon. This could allow a rogue to say, draw their weapons when entering stealth. 
---
\*\*Druid's Roar\*\*
---
/roar  
---
/Mountspecial
---
The mount special command can be used on any mount to make it play a special animation while standing still. It is the same animation that gets played when you hit the space bar while stationary. Druids have special animations while shape shifted you can only activate wit this command,as space bar, even while stationary makes them jump. The roar is just in there to add sound to the animation, which has no associated emote.
---
\*\*First Person\*\*
---
/console cameraDistanceMoveSpeed 50  
---
/console ActionCam full  
---
/run CameraZoomIn(500)  
---
/run ToggleFrame(UIParent)
---
/console cameraDistanceMoveSpeed 8.5
---
/console ActionCam off
---
/run CameraZoomOut(200)
---
These are two macros. One will zoom in quickly, turn on camera shake, and turn off the UI like alt+z.
---
\*\*Screenshot\*\*
---
/run Screenshot()
---
This macro will take a screenshot, like the print screen key. You could combine it with a line from the macro above to hide the UI and take a screenshot with one button.
---
\*\*Violence\*\*
---
/console violencelevel 5
---
/console reloadui
---
This macro sets the blood spatters to maximum. Change the 5 to 0 to turn them off.
---
ITT: people not understanding or not reading the actual post by the TSM devs where they say there’s no trade api. Functionality of the add on will be so limited compared to retail but Reddit would rather rage
---
ok, launch day is here just keep the baby entertained with your foot. (sometimes passes) Yay I'm level 10! oh that smells, well it's fine that's what diapers are for, ill change the diaper once I'm level 12, can"t get caught in the zerg! Woot can"t believe I am level 15 already! shit the baby ok ok, you hungry my dude?!..dude? 
---
shit shit shit shit shit, I need a new baby before she gets home fuck.
---
not true, it was a joke and as soon as soon as i posted it, i posted a comment below for people to get the context. but people were blindly typing without reading because they got upset by the title.
---
I thought it was blowmew? Hockey casters pronounced Mario Lemieux's last name as "lemew"
---
That’s a terrible name irl and ingame. 
---
Pick a new one
---
Unfortunately my favorite vent rages weren’t recorded. I still have dreams about the rage that occurred one day by our GM who got pissed off because the priests decided to purposefully chase raid members around and heal them during priest call on nefarion and put the dot on everyone they could. We had the encounter on farm though so it was pretty hilarious. But he wasn’t amused and screamed for like a minute straight.
---
Yeah I almost wish they'd somewhat blokc some types of add-ons that are do not promote a vanilla experience. This very much does the opposite of that.
---
Por que? Donde esta la bibliotecha?
---
Dropped your pants?
---
End game not viable at all. Dungeons sure.
---
It's perfectly fine for dungeons, but don't expect to tank raids
---
If you can google it you can link it to back it up.  The only thing ion has said in an interview that ive found regarding lfg was regarding the changes in bfa for world quest group finders.  Go ahead and link it, because im certain right now that it doesnt exist in the form you are portraying.  Or just go bitch and moan that others are making addons that hurt your feelings.
---
Actually different regions don't get different numbers... An NA and EU account would be Wow 1(US) and WoW 1(EU)... But you can get multiple WoW accounts in the same region and they will get numbered.
---
**[Stalagg] [H] LF1M Warrior or Shaman for Dungeon Cleave Leveling Group to 60**
---
Have 2 Warriors, 1 Druid, 1 Priest.
---
14+ hour days, 11am-11pm (EST) with group decision to play later each night. We'll follow this schedule until we reach lvl 60 or 9/2 (Monday after Release).
---
We'll be following a pre-written dungeon leveling guide that includes some questing. No prior experience required, just be committed to the schedule and be a chill person. The schedule is negotiable, so if you have specific requirements, I'm open to discuss them with you.
---
Message me if you're interested or have any questions.
---
Need to stop cutting these onions.... Brother and I did the same for many years in classic. He has a family now and has got out gaming really but those are some amazing memories I have and sure you share the same. Sorry about your brother sir, sure he would be all over this release. Be well.
---
I got preacharound for my priest.
---
More like after brack said that someone from the marketing department showed him that there was a profit to be made and he came around.
---
but we have no info on battlegroups. retail has oce in a bg with the us but hopefully they come to their senses for classic because its a fucking horrible idea. a battlegroup of all oce servers should be more than enough.
---
Ayyy!! Team Atlanta represent!! So hyped!
---
But also be ready for criticism and don’t just meet with “I cAn PlAy VaNiLlA hOwEvEr I wAnT!” Which is true you can play how you want but if it starts affecting groups expect to play that way by yourself...
---
If nothing else, there will be LONG queues on almost every server. We'll just have to see how the stability is.
---
There's a drui trainer in the Park, Stormwind.
---
Battlegroups...
---
Prrrretty much. The discord is already a riot. Great people, great guilds, huge population.
---
Yep, this is the place to be for the PvE ruleset for sure.
---
are u real?
---
Don't worry, you can still simulate old school bgs by only queuing within a 3 window each day and /afking out of every 3rd match and sending yourself an emote of "this bg will close because of insufficient players". You'll get the true pre 1.12 classic experience.
---
WTS Paula- Herod
---
Lmao then why would I need the other FP.
---
This is why I curse the social constructs of men! Who the fuck came up with a 40 hour work week? Why the fuck do we have to work 5 out of 7 days a week? If only I could go back in time and change those decisions right then and there.
---
Skeram powah!!!
---
Don't sweat it, repair cost is minimal especially if you go cloth wearer.  The bad part to dying is the run back to your body to rez.  It could be a 5 minute run or longer with some of the graveyard locations.  Also using this to your advantage to die on purpose to rez at the graveyard can save you a 5 min run.  Just make sure it's the closest graveyard.  You take 25% durability hit but like I said for both that is almost nothing.  It's not much for other senior at low levels either while you'll be learning anyways.  Don't be afraid to die you'll learn something in doing so, your limitations.  Then constantly push those limitations.
---
I know latency is very forgiving in this game compared to twitch shooters or shooters in general, but is 70-90ms too much for you??
---
thats why when i posted the whole thread, i put a long comment inside explaining what i meant, it might of been that people didnt understand the title, but all the angry folk didnt take a moment to read the comment and understand the entire story.
---
Yeah Zenn has like a minute long timer on his "Seek Redemption!" hand in, brutal.
---
I use the chrome extension "Infinity New Tab" that shows 10 useful bookmarks in the middle of the screen, most of which are wow related &amp; it has a search bar that uses this same feature, that I have configured to 3 different DB websites, in case some of them go down or are slow due to traffic.
---
Essentially, instead of typing in the address bar, I press ctrl+T to open a new tab and then start typing. While this is slightly less efficient, I don't lose out on using the address bar for google searches, which is something I utilize constantly.
---
My guild lost two 19 year olds in a car accident. I can still remember another guildie protesting that X "made my quiver last night. It can't be true.".  
---
RIP to all of those who have passed on.  
---
May we all visit a memorial in-game from time to time and remember them...
---
Maybe, wouldn't be the first time.
---
Your realm loyalty will dry up really quick if you’re playing on a faction imbalanced server and your queue time is over an hour.
---
We don’t know details yet but it will be like modern WoW most likely.
---
This is a leveling guide though, presumably to save money (so you have more for e.g. lvl 40 mount). Once you hit 60, might as well buy up the rest of the ranks of your skills.
---
it was just for the picture, to hide keyboard and mouse wire &lt;3 thank you for your concern
---
I like how you purposely dont bother to list whatever jank methods of dismounting another player in the air you can think of just so you can feel superior on the internet.
---
I'm hoping to be 60 in a month...or sooner....
---
Well it's hard to look at vanilla in 'Rotations' as you would in retail. Yes, their rotation is 'Frostbolt' for MC/BWL. Many fights you can scroll wheel while watching netflix. However there is more buttons than the rotation. You have items like Trinkets, CDs like Arcane Power, to use and maximize when they will give you the biggest DPS boost. You will be using other spells, too. CC, AoE, Buffs. Also you are one of the few classes who will have an entirely different set of spells between MC/BWL &amp; AQ/Naxx. At that point you will switch to fire, and have a new 'rotation'.  
---
If you look at the 'rotation' of almost every vanilla class, they're all pretty boring.
---
Not viable beyond five mans
---
I straight up told my work my grandma died. Funeral out of state? Am I a piece of trash? Probably. Do I feel any remorse? Absolutely not.
---
Lmao nice name
---
I wouldn’t really call dungeons “end game,” per se, but any of the tanks can handle dungeons just fine.
---
The 18+ rule is why 11 year old me was female to get into guilds.
---
Sadly no friends here but I can attest I too haven't subbed yet
---
Will be leveling up my trade skills that I worked so hard on from level 1-25 and then said f’ when I got sick of it.
---
Sorry, closed, bye
---
no, when i found it on reddit, there was 3-4 different versions, the version that was meant to be printed on canvas was a bit darker than this and not as crisp, i had that one first and changed it to this one, you can probably find it
---
Omg i remember that one lol
---
It was serious question how do I make character
---
now I'm no longer alone
---
NO MORE ON STALAGG LEAVE US ALONE WERE FINE  
---
lowkey stalagggang &lt;3
---
"awesome name"?
---
Not sure If you are trolling or just 12 years old, but there is nothing awsome about that name.
---
Do people actually pvp then?
---
What is EPGP loot, and how long do you plan on raiding each night?
---
Warlock, warlocks are sexy.
---
Jump in your time machine and take a ride to last week
---
If you plan on rolling a rogue on a pvp server I hope you are on the other side of my pvp server.
---
My 1 friend irl is on faerlina help what do I do
---
hahaha! no thirsty women in my comments... yet.. i can imagine what a nightmare it would have been for you too
---
All hardcore and some semi hardcore guilds will not take you.  You could probably find a spot in casual guilds. There may be exceptions for very specific raid scenarios.  It is just too costly to spread tank gear across another player that won't be able to benefit the group as much as a warrior would.
---
Silithus, farming pages. I was up near the northeastern part of the map, someone summoned thunderaan. I ran in, saw like 30-40 hordes... Got slain. Worth it.
---
the chokeholds are brutal when half the players have no idea what to do
---
https://xkcd.com/244/
---
Can you cast your line in small ponds also?
---
And all you care about is the weapon having more/better stats, not DPS.
---
Need to AFK for a piss, shadowmeld. Want to set an ambush party, shadowmeld. Need to drink/eat after combat, shadowmeld. There are lots of great ways to use it.
---
Read them blue posts!
---
40 DPS from something that procs 40% of the time and does 70% weapon damage?
---
What's so low about that? That's the expected SoC DPS from about 140 white DPS.
---
Really cool stuff. Would be interesting seeing a lot of these items in potential new content after Phase 6. A lot of the items are super OP, but would fit in perfectly in post-Naxx content.
---
I really like Sin's Obstacle a lot. Basically a shield that actually allows Prot Paladin to be a thing. I hope that if they do new content after Naxx, they add items like that to help out other specs.
---
You’ll be a bad ass. Dwarf&gt;all for style. Do it.
---
roll on a pve server and send mean mail to the horde
---
No. After I level my warrior.
---
LMAO
---
Near unplayable. With engineering or something you might be able to tank 5 man dungeons but it’ll be an uphill battle.
---
Exactly. Enhancement is for those few that want a different playstyle, but not necessarily the best one they can get (with a Shaman). Some here are pretending Enhancement to be superior at something, which is just not true. Back in Vanilla I was an Enhancement Shaman in the beginning, and I speak from experience that Elemental was vastly superior back then (especially when you had gotten enough crit at around BWL for more reliable burst).
---
I remember seeing a lot of speculation about this around the time of TBC, it would have been cool to see what they could do if they allowed alliances to shift and morph as the story demanded. Maybe even having the Cenarion Circle of Night Elves and Tauren split off as the increasingly warlike Alliance/Horde start working against their own interests.
---
But alas, they instead went the easy route and just slowly eroded all the RPG from the game.
---
You will see them again. Remember there will be battlegroups, you're not gonna be playing with the entire wow population. Only a small subset of servers. You can still build those rivalries with cross realm bgs.
---
Time travel suckasssss
---
Love these!!!! Ready to take on some horde scum 🤘❤
---
"Hero"? This isn't BFA they're called toons.
---
From reading every other tanking thread here, prot pallies are pretty trash.  Bear druids do alright though.
---
before all the comments, as soon as i posted this, i posted it with context written in teh comments for people that wouldnt of gotten the title
---
&gt; she asked me if she could redecorate the house, including my room. i dont really care about how something looks, i care about the functionality more. so i said yes and gave her the conditions, i need the shelves for my books and sofa for watching TV and ofc PC for gaming. the rest i said she could do what she wanted. we had another picture on this wall and she wanted to change it, so i jokingly said im gna make it a map, she said okay thinking i meant a world map... she didnt mind that it was a wow map because ive been talking her ear off for like 3 months about it...

I am so on board with the idea of horizontal progression once players have fully completed WoW: Classic. I really like the idea of adding new end game dungeons/raids/content/gear exclusive to Azeroth that fits the theme of vanilla WoW without the need for increasing stats. For example, creating a raid that requires some type of elemental resistance and awards gear that allows uncommon specs to shine via set bonuses.
---
Yeah it still is most things are pretty much the same.

29 year old dude looking for a west coast horde raiding/pvp guild. I plan on playing an undead mage and will be playing quite a bit. I have a newborn so i wont be "no lifing it". My wife and i are self employed/ work from home so raid times are not much of an issue. looking to be part of a core raid group. probably wont miss any raid times unless i have tickets to a phish show.
---
Awesome, this is great to hear.
---
I figure I will be going tank/heal hybrid spec. Something like this:
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0ZxxhscMdxxxf0fo
---
That post last week showed cat DPS as being like the 2nd best DPS spec, losing out only to a geared warrior
---
You know you can dismount mid air and do whatever you want right?
---
They even had to disable dismounting players on a flying mount at a certain point because of all the griefing
---
What exactly do people do when they RP?  Stuff like work fields in Elwyn?  Mine in jasperlode?  Or is it more complex stuff?
---
Lol also going for Tim.

Always good for a laugh!
---
Obviously don't have data, but I'd guess like 70%+ of people who play classic are already subbed. If you have a retail account, why wouldn't you play? Even for just a couple hours? 
---
Millions of people play retail and many of them will stop by for a quick look at classic and then leave.
---
I feel that WoW got too "epic" for it's own good. Cataclysm started pushing the idea that the player character was a "chosen one" of sorts. These days, we, the player character, are a literal god, fighting alongside the most powerful beings in the lore as the ultimate savior of the universe. In Legion we had artifacts and multiple legendaries, we killed gods and a titan. Admittedly I haven't played BFA, but I know it's no different in this trend. I personally don't care for it, and am glad to go back to a more humble Azeroth.
---
I mean, most of the raid bosses until AQ where some variation of spank tank and don’t step in some random shit. It was a lot of just standing in one spot pressing 1 button.
---
Awesome, so all the swords/maces/daggers will go to him. I'll just have a stat stick. Good to know.

This is really the only way to handle weirdos who wave at you on pvp servers.

You can work with friends or guildmates to ambush him when he gets to the ground to gank you.

she asked me if she could redecorate the house, including my room. i dont really care about how something looks, i care about the functionality more. so i said yes and gave her the conditions, i need the shelves for my books and sofa for watching TV and ofc PC for gaming. the rest i said she could do what she wanted. we had another picture on this wall and she wanted to change it, so i jokingly said im gna make it a map, she said okay thinking i meant a world map... she didnt mind that it was a wow map because ive been talking her ear off for like 3 months about it...  
---
and i'll tell you! she has redecorates a different room in our house every 6-9 months, she loves that shit
---
looking at the recent survey i''m surprised there will be more warlocks than rogues?? dafuq

Where did they promise no transfers and no merges? As far as I know they want to avoid those things but will do them if necessary.
---
While we lost secondaries, most classes were gutted some form or another with losing artifacts without any replacements. Class buffs lost, spells lost, reforging lost. so many things lost. 
---
I agree with him, mechanics are going down the drain. Content however, they keep churning out. But it's all the wrong flavours
---
No
---
LOL Im shocked you're the first comment to recognize it. I guess maybe they're just much different subreddits.
---
If you save enough gold on retail for one token that should cover one month of subscription. Last I saw them going for 120k gold.
---
Woosh
---
I used to run a friend of mine through all the lower level dungeons for gear upgrades. Along the way he got suspended for various reasons such as threatening language and what not. He got to level 45 after about 3 months playing and ran his first dungeon with a group of players he had just met. Things got heated about loot and he called them every name in the book for needing on things they couldn't use. He ended up perma banned a day later it. A month later he fell into drugs and died of an overdose. Rip Bainus, miss you, you little shit.
---
Omfg OP never delete this post LMAO
---
Nothing at all in vanilla effects a pally after they bubble. Mass dispel was added in TBC was the first thing.
---
Ah okay. The answer I was looking for thank you.
---
Rule #1 when making pr@ meme spec guides.
---
Use pservers to film all the stuff, but make sure your name does not exist on the actual pserver raid logs.
---
I'm awarding OP with the most delusional post in the history of this subreddit award. Thank you for summarizing why we can't trust this company.
---
I think people are just making posts at this point to defend Blizzard. I mean come on... To your point they've almost doubled the servers... How can OP even begin to say they know about off the radar people.. What a good laugh to end the night.
---
You'll actually basically never use double stealth before 60
---
I also want to know this.
---
If you are referring to paying for subscription time with gold, you can in a roundabout way.  You can buy WoW Tokens in retail “modern” WoW and redeem them for subscription time, which lets you play Classic.
---
However you cannot buy WoW tokens in Classic.  So you cannot get game time just by playing Classic.
---
This sounds like something someone staying on herod would say &gt;.&gt;
---
It depends on your raid setup. High melee vs high amount of casters. If I remember right as well wanding consumed the charges as well but I might be off on that. If your that type of wand that Carrie's a feral druid and an enhancement shaman and has higher amount of melee wouldn't hurt to go sub. The charges get dropped fast.
---
you can still make characters on 'full' realms
---
Hey man I charge for emotional rollercoaster rides.
---
TBC/ WOTLK class design, Classic dungeon design and TBC dungeon  difficulty (regular, heroic, and raid) would be the best combination.
---
Depends, a lot of people just do casual stuff in Stormwind pubs and things, but when folks find an RP group they tend to intermingle a lot and form cliques and create their own story lines and drama between each other. You'll rarely see that kind of stuff bleed out into the world, a lot of people keep it mostly private.
---
Though, there were a few server wide RP events that used to get advertised on realm forums, some fashion shows or battles between Horde/Alliance, one time I saw 2 rival guard guilds marching against each other in Elwynn Forest, just a line of duels and things.
---
A lot of it is gated behind addons these days, unfortunately, and a lot of RPers use it as a "Do not pass" barrier, so people that actively go out and look for RP without the "appropriate addons" tend to get ignored or turned away, which is a shame. Still, there's some folks out there that will just have a casual in-character conversation at a pub or inn.
---
You do sure make a good steamed ham

Same here...I will be 50 this years. I started in 2005..I think. Anyway..I will be playing classic too..with all my old guildmates. Most were pretty young then. I watched them finish college and get married. We stayed friends all these years, even visited. I can't wait to totally suck and be carried by my guild kids.lol

I would just hop in Q with a remote connection. By the time you get home it might be up. Safer bet then not trying to afk.

Not sure if it’s listed but I saw someone say they are the same locations as the retail servers

Damn, it's in the retail section of Twitch mods atm, hopefully it will be moved to \_classic\_ before next week

Okay so classic is strictly subscription monthly based only?
---
All in your right, but I'd like to ask you to look for introspection what caused that reaction to begin with.
---
I wonder how many of those same people said the market wasn't interested in classic....
---
most classes just use 1 spell tbh.

No. You can only stay on toon screen 30 min.

im in northeast i go to school at the U just transferred from mctc and i wait tables at annies feel free to come by for dinner lol

Woah, that's a game changer... Why is that? I don't understand.
---
There’s something calming, an escape from our own busy daily lives that Azeroth originally gave us.
---
Settling down with a drink, landing in winter spring and just enjoying the slower pace. It was truly relaxing. 
---
No dailies yet. No chores. Just explore, craft, the occasional kill, and enjoy.
---
See you all in Azeroth.
---
doesn’t matter what anyone says, play what you want. some are obviously less desired than others but that doesn’t matter, pick what you think is cool and everything will all work out.
---
Do you think players stop rolling on a server once it says full? The full servers are going to have a much higher population than the high ones and I'd rather not play on a server that has 50% of the population of other realms.
---
Dwarf rogue. Do it
---
Hakkar shouldn't be 100 points either.  ZG was monumentally easier than BWL.  MC- and BWL-geared folks cut through it like a hot knife through butter.

It was a fun raid though.

Yes, many times, right back to the early days.
---
hey im born and raised in mpls and just visited germany i miss it so much cheers/prost
---
Hey bud. Give many of our members are in the exact life stage as you, we haven't committed to raid dates or times and would prefer to get to end game first and see where it all shakes out. Below is our guild recruitment charter if you would like to consider:
---
&lt;Catharsis&gt; NA-West-Fairbanks-PVP-Casual/Moderate Alliance Guild
---
Hey Alliance friends who have chosen Fairbanks! Well met! Our guild aims to be a community that caters to those who want to play with old friends, make new friends, travel on this nostalgic journey together, and build a sense of community—which in my opinion is the most enchanting part of the game. The guild will have veterans who have played for fifteen years as well as the fortuitously naive who will be experiencing its frustrations and exhilarations for the first time. There are no set nights for dungeons/pvp/events in that we hope to get enough guildies online, that we can group up and have fun on most nights of the week. As we get to endgame, we can then decide what our exciting next steps should be and how we want to organize raiding and loot distribution! Our current members come from all walks of life, and most are working professionals (authors, athletes, teachers, scientists, doctors, business leaders) who all want to spend our evenings escaping to another vibrant world with each other. If this community sounds inviting to you, message me here or on discord (~Swell~#9845). No application needed. Just see if it feels right to you, and feel free to reach out to me with any questions.
---
The things I listed are all that are confirmed not to be the same. But keep believing whatever you believe. If you for example are going to roll a Warrior tank, hurry up and get your 1.3 dagger so your raid can laugh at you.
---
Can't shadowmeld in combat.
---
There will be plenty of raid groups willing to take healers regardless of spec, back in Vanilla it wasn't unusual for a lot of raid guidls to have only a handful of appropriately specced healers, and let their off-healers be whatever spec they wanted.
---
As long as you're signing for raids as a healer primary, and wear/bid for all of the appropriate healing gear, then they won't care too much.
---
I'm not sure how it works with the modern login server, but there was a time that you could get through the queue and have a small grace period to get back in before you were booted back into the queue -- it definitely was not 30 minutes though, more like 5-10 minutes. However, I think there was no grace period for people logging in from different IP addresses.
---
Your best bet will be to remote into your home computer to get in the queue before leaving work, or whatever your queue estimate is, minus 10 minutes (so you have to wait just a little at home -- better than timing out)
---
This has had more nostalgic effect on me than any other research/hype concerning WoW Classic I've seen.
---
Every morning we wake up, to see the countdown showing seven days and four hours until Classic. We post and bitch about our suspicion that there aren't enough servers. Every afternoon we're startled to learn that Blizzard is adding 2 new NA servers, 1 new English-EU and 2 new German ones. Every evening we're getting worried about signs that every server is filling up, and there will be endless queues at launch. Every night we go to bed, feeling empty, knowing that our lives don't really start until launch day.
---
And every morning we wake up to a countdown showing seven days and four hours, starting the same day again, without ever retaining our memories.
---
I've been going back and forth between priest and druid.
---
&gt; Are there any other classes that could do ok in PvP/solo content while also still being accepted into raids as a healer? 
---
You can be really good in pvp with a disc/holy spec and raid at the same time. You can farm solo with it too.
---
Assuming classic is a success there is no way Classic is left as is. Either they go to TBC, or they will probably try adding new content to classic like old school runescape, and if they go to TBC this will probably be the next step after that. They are not investing in this just to have it die out due to people getting bored.

Anger Management doesn't actually do what it says in the tooltip... per se. It passively grants you 1 rage every 3 seconds even in combat. Thats 20 rage per minute.
---
Yo, this is sick! 
---
New player here, any chance of there being a Mage version of this?
---
https://youtu.be/B8QIa3klodc
---
This is true, but cleave still wrecks heroic strike in terms of rage efficiency, presuming you're hitting two targets, and it's not even close.  Cleave deals \~100% more damage than heroic strike for 17% more rage cost after factoring in the lost rage on the attack swing, assuming one swing generates 15 rage.
---
holy shit you're the same sleepa that did the pirates of the pancreas rap video
---
your video (and guild) is what made me realise how good classic can be
---
You should be asking what class is easiest to gear in raids because. . .
---
The ZG 20 man raid in phase 4 is the only catch up mechanic.
---
The really good PvP gear requires a 3 month insanity grind. Look up the Rank 14 grind.
---
This has been discussed endlessly for the last 3 days since the blue post below was released.
---
The wording leaves it open to interpretation to a certain extent, however after much discussion with people in this community and my guild, and the other remarks they've made about keeping servers as vanilla-like as possible, the way I understand it is that the hard server caps, once layering is removed, will be the same as they were in vanilla. 
---
I could be wrong, it wouldn't be the first or last time, and I personally hope the server caps are closer to 10k, but from all information available this is the most likely conclusion, in my opinion. 
---

Did the same and the names I missed out on in Herod (due to queue) were available!

I doubt that would work.  You'd be better off getting remote desktop software and use that to login to your home pc from work and login from there.

With that said, does shaman pve healing gear compliment pvp ele?

Manhandle my ham candle.
---
I think what would help would be if they made an announcement that between phases, depending on Populations (not all realms would be eligible), Free realm Xfers for high pop /low pop realms would be made available. They used to do it so its not that far outside the realms of "classic". 
---
Just little thing to ease the pressure of launch and the fears of some.
---
yes, but not in Phase 1
---
You can kill Booty Bay guards and grind DB books for steamwheedle reputation. Its one hell of a grind tho.
---
I feel like that’s normal raid times. Before my guild disbanded (lots of stuff happened but that’s a story for another time lol), we raided twice a week from 9 pm to 1 am eastern. Started a little earlier than you’re asking, but this was for mythic progression (not sure if you’re going for casual or hardcore progression raiding). I feel like you have a pretty good chance of raiding around that time - though it might be easier with a guild that’s mostly PST so when they start earlier their time, it’ll be around 10 or 11 your time

Hemo rogue with imp. stealth and me being feral/restore hybrid use to 2 man BRD for HoJ and the epic mace. We were mostly AQ geared but to tbh we could have done it bwl geared. Just would have taken a bit.

I could see 2 druids 2 manning dungeons but in would rather find a rogue friend due to dps requirements and fight reset mechanics.
---
Herod can only LAUGH at the puny latecomers.
---
This is a hunter belt
---
The problem is the PvP damage to health ratio gets completely thrown off in AQ and classic+ would further steer that away unless they’re smart about it
---
Yeah actually that's 100% the case for me.
---
/e spits on you.

Retribution, feral, balance, Ele, enhance, arms, prot pally, Spriest... Maybe a few more I'm blanking on. Hard to find a spot.
---
Had a new player ding 60 on his Warlock, his first ever character.  He was a complete noob, but had managed to get attuned to MC before hitting 60.
---
We needed a warlock and told him he could literally do nothing all night, just auto-follow a mage and soulstone a rezzer.
---
Obviously he did more than that, but the point was, just don't screw us up and you're on for free loot.
---
Dude netted 11 epics that night.  He went from blues and greens to almost full epics in 2-3 hours.  He was freaking out.  Most of us needed nothing out of there, we were running it for fun and low chance at bindings and eye.  He then spent the next couple days in Bags, drunk with his new power.  It was fun to see him having such a blast.
---
Raid Tarren Mill and kill ALL OF THE QUEST NPC and Flightmaster and hold the Horde hostage.
---
Raid Grom'gol and kill all the NPC and prevent any horde from escaping Grom'gol. Range DPS can attack the Flightmaster from the outside safely and all those who flies in LOL.
---
get ready to cry!
---
Coming from someone who was an original vanilla player, play what makes you happy. Yes there are "optimal" specs for class but you need to be having fun getting to 60 and beyond.
---
Example: we used to take a warlock to molten core(40 man raid) that would run in naked and aoe with hell fire on every pull then rez him. Why'd we take him? Because having the full 40 even if some are stupid is better than just having the 39.
---
If he cam find a group, you can too, even as a 'b'oomkin.
---
For add-on no clue.
---
Paladin/Rogue
---
Protection Paladins do absolutely fine in dungeon content. The lack of active mitigation and a taunt lowers raid viability
---
In pvp they shit on priests across all phases. And even pre naxx they def keep up if not surpass. By t3 it's over.
---
&gt;  there would be no maliciousness at all  
---
It's highly malicious.  The models don't look at all the same, and whatever look you build your character around with vanilla models often either maps to a different WoD model choice (so if you and I have different settings, the character is not as intended on one of our screens), and often you can't get anything close to a match anyway, even if you mess around with it.  
---
&gt; The new water is in Classic WoW, you can toggle it on and off  
---
I'm not sure how great that is either, but the water being different doesn't totally ruin the idea of a shared world.  The idea is that someone is supposed to look the way that they intend, not the way that you intend.  
---
Hopefully they never allow it.  Vanilla doesn't have those monstrosities, and hopefully classic never will.
---
Alright, I got feedback; Thanks for responding. I see the flaws of this guide and will update it for myself.
---
Ah the vanilla experience. Some servers should get surprise maintenance on Thursday and every now and then be down all weekend too.
---
General rule of thumb for raiding is most desired is
---
Tanks - warriors
---
Healers - paladins/shamans, druid, priests
---
Dps - mage/warlock/rogue/hunter/warrior
---
You can try a different spec, but yeah it will be harder to get a raid group.
---

MS scales off of average damage range due to speed normalization. Yes, slower weapons have higher damage range. But the *highest top end* is not always the highest average.
---
Remindme! 6 days
---
I'm gonna roll on a PvE server specifically because I just want to enjoy original Azeroth again in peace.
---
Common man. This is bullshit.
---
Thanks I’ll check it out. Although, the spreadsheet on the sub has some pretty good numbers, with faerlina being basically 50/50 out of ~2200 submissions and the only server that’s even. Whitemane is the second most even.  The rest of the pvp servers are all horde dominated by 13% or more.
---
No 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Healing gear and caster DPS gear rarely overlap, unfortunately, and many raid groups will not allow healers to bid for off-spec items unless the DPS pass. It will take longer to get geared, but you'll get there eventually, it's how most people did it back in Vanilla.
---
I think for every troll we get, there's half a dozen righteous dudes out there. I love that.
---
Realistically, though, 300 people is &lt;5% of the population.
---
Hmm.  Do you have any suggestions on what I roll then?
---
Right?!  I have a 16 month old and it's like 24/7 suicide watch.  Their mission in life is to aggressively try to end their life - how did we ever survive as a species?
---
Every class can find raid spots. Even druids, who are generally considered to be lackluster. Someone still has to cast mark of the wild, battle rez, and soak up all of that druid gear.
---
However, if your class can heal, you are typically expected to heal in raids. You may be able to find a guild willing to carry you just to fill out their roster or because they like you, but it would indeed just be a carry because you would not be pulling your weight. The difference between trying to dps as an enhancement shaman vs trying to dps as a rogue or mage is oppressively huge. Far more than any spec differences in modern WoW.
---
Dps classes have their own similar issues where they tend to be expected to play builds that excel in raids but may be poor in PvP or solo PvE. Ask any combat dagger rogue.
---
There’s twenty of us that are going to be playing classic exclusively.
---
Only two resubbed, so 18 of us didn’t.
---
3 more of our friends are already avid retail players.
---
Blizzard is in for a shock when they see MILLIONS of people logging on and I’m so hyped to be in que and watch porn while I wait.
---
This essentially means Blizzard is targeting zoomers as a viable market (which they should).
---
I don't even know what a snapcode is and I have snapchat.
---
Ret Pallys and Enhance shamans have the problems of not being able to use all their mana. Then there's the hybrid tax. 
---
If your raid is okay with it then its fine, but you got to get a guild that will do that or you're going to be stuck pugging.
---
They will ban you if you are using exploits, scripts, macros that prevents you from afking. And no third party software use either ala ghostmouse (been banned for it back in the day).
---
However this my friends is physically touching the keyboard :)
---
 Unfortunately I tried doing this years ago with another druid friend after I successfully did it with a rogue friend  in brd and couple other and it is quite difficult.

I had some of the best feral gear out of AQ and even had a Feral AP weapon off of the green dragons.

---
If you read the tooltip closely, you'll notice the wording is very specific. It only increases the critical damage of abilities and doesn't affect your autos. Your autos are the most part of your damage in leveling, especially with low crit chance, which is why Impale is not as good in the early levels compared to end game.
---
Hotw Druid! Well not having swiftmend kind of sucks but hotw 20% int is amazing. Though Druid isn’t he most desirable healer. I’m sure you’d be accepted into most raids still as Druid’s aren’t too popular.

US West Horde Whitemane mage looking for dungeon grinding group. Have Tues - Monday off, going hard.
---
Still wrong.
---
I agree with the others who said you can do most bosses that don’t require complicated mechanics. 
---
Double druids bring double innervate and battlerezes, so there may be creative options to get around stuff. Some bosses could be tanked in cat form and others you could just slow roll in bear. 
---
I got something similar planned with my rogue friend, my main concern is that lots of bosses pull any unkilled trash with them, so some rooms will have to be cleared.
---
You could be a PvP healer? Priest are pretty versatile for that.
---
As a shaman as 60 you will almost always be forced to heal. 1 Enhance can be in a raid but only to apply a debuff from an axe called nightfall. You literally just drop totems and auto attack. You get to wear no tier, but random off-pieces. And you will be last priority to give to. It’s just the consequences of being considered a “Meme-spec”. 
---
That being said, Shaman is awesome. You should level Enhance, and Shaman is a decent leveler. Gets to deck out in SM gear, grab whirlwind axe, etc.
---
At 60 you will be healing raids and as Ele PvP you become a wrecking ball. In dungeons Ele is still extremely strong, but not until a bit later on. They actually do so much AOE burst that they grab immediate Aggro, and don’t offer hard CC, AND they OOM extremely quickly. 
---
Over to raiding as resto, if you choose this over enhanced you will be extremely sought after, but have lots of loot competition. Your heals are technically the lowest HPS in the game later on, but chain heals functions as a smart heal which is great for heal sniping, and your totems make you 100% needed and viable. 
---
Lastly, if you’re trying to avoid useless specs in Vanilla, there’s a lot of them. A quick (And not ENTIRELY accurate) rule of thumb is if you have a healing spec you will heal raids. Leveling you can make anything work usually. PvP you can make anything work but justifying a raid guild to give you gear towards it will take a lot of effort  and time commitment.
---
Best of luck!
---
Nice set up!
---
I actually really like this a lot.
---
Where did you get that map?
---
I’d love to replicate something like this.
---
Im not sure this would work.
---
No idea, mate. There's some overlap for Priests, maybe? With their staff being both a Holy and Shadow weapon, but ultimately most "hybrids" face the same problem, they're healer primary. I know private servers are influencing things a lot this time around, and perhaps some raid groups will be happy to take an elemental shaman.
---
Good luck to you, either way.
---
Priest, shaman, or lock for me. Zug zug.

Also please send help, I'm drowning in a sea of indecision.

I feel like people are under estimating blizzard. After all they were the ones frantically trying to fix the servers when they were over populated during wows early days, I’m sure they understand how popular this game is going to be.  I can assure you que times will be minimal to none, now sure you may be laughing because we all know how blizz has been in the past however the only thing I’ve seen on forums/reddit etc is the public opinion on server ques and I’m more than certain blizz has noticed and will ensure the ques are reduced
---
Looking at your demo tree you're vastly overestimating the usefulness of your pets.
---
Using void is fine for leveling on a pvp server but don't expect it to tank like a hunter's pet, just looking the wrong way at a mob can outaggro your void. You usually just use it more like a meatsack that absorbs the first hit and that you can sac in case of emergency (pvp). 
---
Demo tree is just a bunch of fillers to get to the good stuff, master summoner, DS, MD, SL. Not taking master summoner when you go that deep in the tree is just crazy, it's almost like not buying deathcoil while leveling because it's not dmg/mana-efficient. 
---
But in the end you'd be better off with shadowburn in both pve and pvp and then you can still pick up some very useful talents from both affliction and destruction, or even the first tier of demo. To give you an example on how much I rate those chosen demo tree talents: I'd prefer just one point in CoEx over 20 of those points, only DS is more useful.
---
Motorcycles are not so out of place tbh, warcraft is steampunkish. there are rifles and helicopters.
---
Dude unless you're in a world first sort of guild there is absolutely no way you'd be turned down for being a dwarf vs human provided you're a good tank. 
---
And the only reason they'd do it is because they've picked their main tank far before launch and that tank decided to roll human.
---
Holy shit, thank you.
---
Wasn't it 8 in vanilla?

See it as building the hate towards the other faction when you get ganked. They are the other faction, not your friends..
---
Oui oui oui!
---
I was sitting outside my brother's door listening to him yell and scream at people that kept tagging mobs before him, because my copy hadn't been ordered yet and it was the closest I could get to playing the game.
---
Well, like others have said, you don't really "farm" these, you just get massively lucky with mobs in the level range to drop them. 
---
That said, elites have a higher drop chance. Zul'farrak and hinterlands elites can both drop it.
---
I remember those cloaks...do you need dragonscale leatherworking to make them or just leatherworking?
---
Wouldn't be classic without long queues. Blizzard is really going for the full immersion.
---
I’m not seeing much room for interpretation 🤷🏻‍♂️

I'm sure. I was at his house when this happened. It was the very first night the beta PvP realm went live. We stayed up all night to get to around lvl 8-10. We swam to durotar from ratchet.

You will be invited to raids.... though in smaller quantities. You will be last dps, unless you have downs guildmates.

It'd be an interesting challenge. I know people 4 manned ony in vanilla, 3 manned at 60 with 2.0.1. If you had both druids geared out the arse and both have the ability to usefully tank and throw heals I can't imagine any 5 man would give you trouble outside of specific mechanics. 
---
I'm sure people will get more interested in this sort of stuff towards the end of the phases when they're clearing raids very quickly and looking for stuff to do. Same with 4 or 3 man 45min baron runs.
---
Best idea I've heard is remoting into your PC with your phone to start the login.  I'm sure this is possible but I haven't looked into how to do it yet.

Thanks, my man! I appreciate the compliment.

You'll still use it up to rank 4 but fishing for Overpower procs with hamstring usually beats HS for good at lvl 29 with Corpsemaker, even as early as lvl 26 if you have Strike of the Hydra.

Who might you be saying that to (either one) that it wouldn’t sound lame?

Not exactly. Some zones only have quests for one faction.

Rogue is reasonably solid without gear, since they are very reliant on eviscerate in pvp which does not scale with gear at all. Fresh 60 in greens hits exactly as hard with evisc as a Naxx rogue. The class also remains super squishy no matter what gear you are running, so it's not like a warlock or whatever which is near unkillable with high-end equipment. You're going to be relying on stealth and cooldowns to survive which are just as effective either way.
---
That being said, gear still makes a significant difference no matter your class.
---
It’s good bro trust me
---
I just wanted to let everyone know that Joana him/herself said that it could be done faster. People are hitting 40 in 35 hours. If you can get a good cleave group together you can level in probably about 60-80 hours. By yourself, depending on class, you're looking at 80-150 hours /played.
---
Nobody is bear

I will never NOT laugh at this. The early days of the internet was like the wild west.
---
I am in this group (35-54)
---
Bruh if you don’t play on a pvp realm you’re a pussy. Simply put getting ganked and then figuring out a way for the 5 lvl 34’s around you to kill the terrifying 57 in a way to quest in peace is just as fun as ganking lowbies yourself.
---
Well... i won't be awesome. I'll be "normal." I'll treat you with respect, like my parents taught me to do with other people. But I won't expect to be treated the same way.
---
If it happens: good

If not: I'm tank and my Hearthstone will be ready~

I was going to say the same. For a lot of working people, itll be like 2.5mos i bet for 60.

 Generally reading the quest text would give you directions, that's the whole point.

&gt;I've noticed a lot of complaints about paladins lately, with regard to their low dps and limited combat options. But what players are forgetting is the main reason Blizzard programmed Paladins. Paladins were not designed to be hybrid Tanks/Healers, as many claim. Instead, paladins were designed to be played while downloading pornography.
---
&gt;Paladins have roughly zero combat interaction, thus making them the perfect character to play while downloading massive amounts of hardcore pornography. Simply target a monster, hit "1", and minimize your window. Then sit back and enjoy the amazing girl on girl action.
---
&gt;Because a Paladin takes about one full minute to kill any monster, you can leisurely browse the erotic and pornographic fruits of the internet without much concern over your Paladin's welfare. After a minute, I go back to WoW, and usually my Paladin is alive and ready to loot the corpse. This is what makes grinding so pleasurable and convenient for me; the ability to simultaneously watch girls have sex with each other and level up at the same time. I doubt any other class has such an elegantly designed system, and I applaud Blizzard for their foresight in crafting a character that I can play with while playing with myself.
---
&gt;DPS? Who needs it? The quicker I kill something, the less time I have to watch boobies. Combat Interactivity? Overrated. I'd much rather interact with the girls writhing on my computer screen. Yes, a paladin was created for the sole purpose of surviving a fight while you stream hot pornography directly to your computer. That is why we have the high armor class, healing abilities, and the low, low DPS.
---
&gt;As for PvP, nothing is better than getting into Battlegrounds and soaking up the honor points while I watch girls take their clothes off for money. Only the minimum interaction is necessary for a Paladin to perform, and it is this very quality that I love the most about my Paladin. I doubt Rogues get any time to watch pornography while trying to vanish and rack up combo points, and I bet Shamans haven't seen a single naked breast while figuring out which totem to throw down before choosing which shock they are going to cast next.
---
&gt;In addition to grinding, we have several defensive options during combat that also allow us the flexibility of downloading pornography. Hammer of Justice allows a quick 6 second glimpse at a naked lady while our opponent is stunned, and Divine Shield allows a leisurely 8 seconds of quality right-hand time. Indeed, Paladins have cornered the market on the pornography during playtime of World of Warcraft gameplay.
---
&gt;It saddens me that many Paladins do not take advantage of the main functionality of your character, and are in fact lobbying for increased DPS, or more combat options. These are all unnecessary frivolities that would only harm our pornography downloading efficiency. Instead, we should thank the fine programmers at Blizzard for crafting a character that is great to grind with while grinding your loins.
---
Can you tank dungeons in that spec?
---
Medium is a higher pop than any real vanilla realms ever had according to their blue post, so no realms are gonna be dead at this point lol.

That's great until you fail to land 2 or 3 mauls in a row. Literally dead in the water for what, 9 seconds? That can happen at any time, not just under crowd pummeler.

The only problem is that you need to be lvl 120 to make enough gold quick enough to pay for a sub. Most of your time will be farming gold on retail and barely any time playing classic.

i never raided but i thought wow was boring after hitting 60 on my mage and quit until BC.  If I level a mage it will be for pvp funs and AOEing 5mans mostly.
---
There’s really nothing to indicate that, though. You could just as easily say that Herod is where the retail tourists jumped to get their character names registered, and the servers added later are where a lot of the old timers that are resubbing just for classic are going to end up and therefor will probably have longer lasting communities. It’s all just speculation at this point. Look at Archimonde when WoW first released. It had a lot of hardcore guilds from UO/AC and everyone jumped ship to Mugthol because they were sick of the server problems, and Mugthol was a great server until realm and faction xfers destroyed it like every other server.

The elder scrolls online is doing the same. Eveey expansion they are just adding new lore content/dungeons/raids etc. but dont increase the level cap.
---
I dont understand why they changed wow during all thia years so much. Why they removed some mechanics, like hunters ammo for example or change talents or add fly mounts.
---
They should have leave all mechanics like it was before and just add lore end game content without increasing level cap.

I was in highschool from 2004-2008, played with a group of friends, we stopped playing when we went to college, some earlier than that, went our separate ways, while I wont be playing with the same group of friends I did in highschool, I have a new group of friends/coworkers I plan on playing with now and I cant wait to get that feel of running dungeons with a group of close friends screwing around just having a good time.
---
The ping difference will be negligible, the thing you’ll want to consider is what time is peak playtime for you. If you join a guild that raids 7:00-11:00 in the evening, that will be 6:00pm-10:00pm for you if you join an EST realm, but 9:00pm-1:00am if you joint a PST realm. If you play mostly on the weekend this will matter less to you, but if you play weeknights this is definitely something to consider.
---
I could take a look at what doesn't work. Do you have the combat log changes your friend made?
---
People are gonna be RPing, usually out of the way somewhere, just don't bother them. You don't have to participate in RP, most won't try to rope you into RP if they don't know you, there's no RP in dungeons, usually no RP in universal channels like Trade/General.
---
Ultimately people keep to themselves, if you don't want to participate then don't, just don't bother people by actively trying to disrupt whatever is going on and you'll be fine.
---
Dwarf priest : always always wanted in raids (priest+fearward) decent leveling ,tho a bit boring (wand things to death)

I mean my guild has 34 people and I know at least 25 have reserved their 3 names already. If you really don't think retail players aren't reserving your name you are being closed minded. Why wouldn't they? Already subbed, might as well lock up their names.

Are you fucking retarded

Just don't switch servers then? And by the way, more people will sub at release and pick the newest servers by default.

Or, they could layer tbc players, never allow them to interact with vanilla players. It would take some game developers and resources though for sure. I will be playing vanilla still years down the road and would do anything not to be forced to tbc.

I had just graduated high school and started my first part time job. And couldn't get my hands on a copy of the game until march.   Shit was sold out everywhere.   Had to pay someone to drive me to city to pick it up.   I started playing the same week I started dating my wife.    We both played and now our kid is 12 and classic is back and were ready to play again.     We quit when the LFR patch dropped in cataclysm.  Games sucked ever since.

you'll have plenty of money at 40 for your money. You'll only lose out on rep. The discount on rep for the mount is pointless for an aoe grinding mage, since you'll have more then enough gold at 40 and probably tons of BoEs to sell in AH since you're not rolling against anyone.

Shadow priest might be your best bet. Ele shams dont get a lot of raid spots TBH. Their dps just isn't the best as opposed to say a lock or a mage. Same goes for a shadow priest, however shadow is more likely to get into raids over ele sham. And a druid, also might be considered for the crit aura and innervate also. 
---
But with all the new influx of players, I wouldn't be surprised if some of the odd specs that were shunned back in 2005 make a resurgence. People are more open minded (unless you are in a hardcore raiding guild)

Just play what you want and join a guild that will accept you for who you are ;) #beyourself

Wait are you saying some things are different? No way.. i can name as many things different about Classic than Vanilla as you have here. All those things you just listed are MOST or even close to 1/2. My statement is accurate most things are similar and for most if they have a difference its small.
---
WAS darkshore now off EPL? Were undead a alliance faction? Were mountains in the right place?  Dwarves start in EF? 
---
MOST of pserver context is accurate and when its not its similar.
---
I always thought the same. I loved TBC and Wrath, but if they do these expects they’ll have to continue it. They won’t just stop after wrath and create new content. I’m not interested in Classic turning back into retail.
---
I hope they do the OSRS route as well. We’ll see

where did you hear that was possible?

there are already made components in the game that were just never used. like the emerald dream. there's a few other spots, and areas that were pretty well-designed and obviously for raid content that were just never used.

---
Fun fact, 'Cumdonor' and 'Saggytits' are also valid names.
---
Yeah, I'm hoping to avoid waiting until then. I'd rather give my group a heads-up ahead of time to avoid any confusion or split amongst server choices.
---
You reserve a name on a single server. Which means it can be available on one server and not available on another server depending if someone took it. All servers have their own database of names.
---
you can use the same name as long as its on a different server and no one took it on that server
---
Every decision is a sacrifice of what you could have if you made another decision.  
---
A shadow specced priest raid healer will generally be a more competitive/coveted position (1 per raid max), and will be less effective at healing than ele/resto imo.  
---
Ele/resto shaman is a nice compromise but you will definitely not be as valuable in terms of healing as other healers.  On the other hand, mana tide totem isn't that necessary for all of the shamans.  It's really only valuable in healer and mage/warlock groups.  Otherwise you can bring significantly more value by totem twisting properly.  (though, admittedly, totem twisting is easier to maintain with mana tide and improved mana spring).

Agree, until naxx getting 40 ppl is enough and most people aren't going to raid naxx anyway to worry about.

Hi there! I've played on an RP realm on Retail since WoTL yet I don't actually participate in any RP myself. It's perfectly fine to play on the realm and not avidly partake in the full immersion. Not everyone RP's every single thing. If you do notice people RP'ing however be respectful and don't go awol and break their immersion. They're just trying to have a good time same as you. Feel free to participate as well if you want. Just be polite and try your best to act how your character would in the same situation. Even if you're no good at it most people won't mind and will still be fairly open with you.

Ion already said in an interview that the current plan, if it were to happen, is to have expansions separate from each other. Secondly, the same applies to adding custom bullshit to it.

Allow me to explain why opening additional servers now that were past the initial name reservation doesn't mater. Every top guild has already picked their home (Herod) there's already a "mega server" and the game isn't even released. Moving away from this megaserver is putting your guild at a disadvantage as every good player is already on Herod. If you're serious about raiding and want to find the best recruits Herod is the place to be. This means the new servers being opened are being filled by more casual players, further perpetuating the advantage one gains by choosing to play on Herod. The result is most guilds are refusing to switch off Herod and risk an inferior pool of players to recruit. Opening additional servers will help with the flood of casuals on launch but anyone in the know is gonna stick it out despite the massive queues. It creates a shitty situation. To stay on Herod and benefit from a higher caliber of player but have your play experience ruined by ridiculous queues or to transfer and risk a server full of tourists/first time vanilla players. Both options are a lose/lose. They really screwed up by only initially announcing so few servers and pretty much created this situation through poor planning. The only solution I can see moving forward is delete Herod entirely and open 3-4 new servers, allowing guilds to spread out.

Yes. As long as it isn't taken by someone else on that server

For some reason I can't see the other comments, so forgive me if I've repeated what others have said.

Flag carry is one thing.  You're mostly a support class.  Healing, rooting, stealth around with rogues etc.

There are dozens of us!
---
I have good memories there in vanilla but to be fair i also leveled with a priest most of the way to 60.
---
World travel, threat management, currency scarcity, and the need for crowd control are a few that come to mind off the top of my head.
---
Always, always discuss drops before going into a dungeon. If no one in your group wants to talk about loot, if they just rush right in and ignore you, stay outside until they have the conversation. Ain't nobody got time for that shit.
---
Every server is going to have Spanish players. Even if they all combined into one server, they wouldnt surpass a single digit % and most of them would still speak English, you backdoor nationalist racist lite completely and utterly hopeless waste of breath and biomass.

Late Night - Alliance - PvE - NA
---
Healer looking for a guild that will be active late nights. I will usually be on starting around 9PM PST (after putting the kids to bed). I plan to play either a holy paladin or a resto druid. 
---
I am more of a causal player, and may take some time to level up. Once leveled, I would be looking to raid Friday/Saturday (9PM - 12AM PST or so). I am also interested in some PvP, especially organized battlegrounds once available, but prefer to play on a PvE server so I can fish in peace.
---
I wonder if Ronda Rousey will be playing with Vin Diesel
---
Yes you can use the same name across multiple servers.
---
Now name calling as well. Dude you are salty as fuck. Probably live at home with the parents still because you don't like the challenge of having to look after yourself.
---
That'd be a cool mousepad
---
This is some 200 IQ 4-D chess right here.
---
the burning crusade was no garbage at all.
---
Casual shit if you ask me. You should be forced to draw your own map and use a compass to navigate.
---
It would be greatly appreciated. I know I for one will be doing most of these with friends as we level so that everyone has the key to everything. But I’m assuming we will all end up a bit scattered level wise so it would be helpful to know what we can/can’t just carry others threw.
---
While not quite the same as those people behind the screen who unfortunately will never log in again, and not quite from as long ago as classic, I'd like to share a story of someone I met during my first ventures into this game (during cata) who disappeared into the dark void of ones and zeroes home to many fallen brother and sisters.
---
I was but a young night elf rogue, slowly gearing and figuring the game out. Upon my travels I met another young night elf and her two companions; one a druid, and the other a hunter. It was with these three that I learned about friendship, and it was with these three that I came to appreciate the value of personal relationships.
---
One evening after sneaking online after my folks had gone to sleep I logged in and looked all over Teldrassil for her at our favorite hangout (the chopped up bits of the roots of the world tree behind Rut'theran Village) and was dismayed when I couldn't find her. Our druid friend, who I only remember now as being referred to as 'kitty', came up to me and said that the young night elf didn't come to school that day either. Only reflecting on things now do I realize how depressed that young night elf girl was at the time.
---
Myself being just a young night elf rogue I didn't quite know what all that might entail and, after not seeing her for a while, assumed her parents had just stopped paying her sub.
---
8+ years have passed since then. I don't know what happened to 'kitty' although I'm sure she's still fine and living life somewhere. 
---
By chance I was revisiting our old hangout one night a little over a year ago with the exact same rogue I had first made those many late nights ago and happened upon the hunter who I had spent so many of them in the company of. Like myself, he's now a grown man, eager to live his life and do what he wants. This man decided to dedicate part of his life in service to his country, and it sounds just like something that young hunter I met all those years ago would do.
---
So what of this young night elf girl who just logged off one night, never to be heard from again? I'm afraid I'll never know. I can only hope that she's alive and doing well somewhere. Maybe she's married now with children of her own.
---
Lori; if you're out there, thank you for the memories and teaching me how to open up to other people. I've never forgotten our small group, and never will.
---
Yes, the difference is a single talent (Frostbite). but if you may want to reconsider planning to AOE grind if you never have before.
---
Really?
---
Felwood is a zone i never skip.
---
Is there a better version?
---
Well we might see TBC. It is a very popular among to classic players. It was a very good expansion. But I dont know if they will go the same route as BFA.
---
F. Then I will see you on the battlefield!
---

---
You won't be aoe farming unless you get ahead of every other player on your server
---
Wanting to be included is one way to put it and if that's one of your concerns as a player you should look for a guild that has that including attitude. There are a million and one other concerns that different guilds may have when choosing who to bring for a raid.

---
Two hardcore/semi-hardcore players looking for a relevant US progression guild.
---
While we would like to think we can still both play at a hardcore level, we're both adults now and don't have the same amount time as we did back in the day. We are looking for a US progression guild on any server as any faction to call our permanent home. 
---
My buddy will be playing a rogue/warlock based on what is needed.
---
I will be playing a mage/warrior(tank) based on what is needed.
---
We are both more than interested in being class officers or contributing to a needed role within the guild.
---
You can send me a message on here or add me on discord  colby#5088 
---
I can explain our raiding experience and any necessary recruiting information over pm's.
---
In that case, know that what you are putting time and effort into starting next week may very well be heading in that direction. It's up to you how long you choose to stick with it.
---
Reagents and ammo from outside dungeons sounds reasonable.  It's going to suck for Hunters regardless, I don't recall a lot of early ranged weapons.
---
The hobbits the hobbits the hobbits the hobbits...
---
He is correct that link even mentions it further down the page.
---
This is all fine for pug groups. Hybrids can add a lot of value to groups that are shaky or have just formed. They are fine for lots of content and get a bad rap.
---
That being said. 
---
People who want to just speed clear dungeons for specific gear, won't be running oom or having a dps die. They will be on their 10th run that day, and just want to burn a few more down. They won't care about utility as much as just raw outputs.
---
I think these things will only keep going as long as there is moisture on the top part (under the dressing). Around 2 hours IIRC.

Does it work? I really want to buy one
---
Aka around the clock camping of VC entrance
---
&gt;and not just switching to a low pop one.
---
Good luck finding a low pop server on launch day.  Every server will have queues (unless they release a bunch more).
---
I'm pretty sure technology is there to count accounts, not names
---
Swedish players prolly moving again LUL
---
Chill my man, retail and classic exists, we've done enough arguing.
---
I hope the servers are 10k cap or higher. Its what people are used to from private servers
---
I must know server and faction. I shall be the one who killed superman.
---
PVP servers are suprisingly balanced from what I saw. There were quite a few polls done quite a number of responses I'm sure if you Google search might find them but action balance was pretty equal
---
Meld has a passive effect that increases your stealth level by 1
---
LMAO dudebro you're like so edgy and kewl lawl. Wish I could be you LMAO
---
Very much so, yes. I’ll keep rerolling for name reservations if they drop a new server, but I would rather play a second choice name on a balanced server if it comes to that.
---
Which just goes to show that the best way to climb the corporate ladder is to be condescending to your audience/customers.
---
All these full servers, with who knows how many players waiting until the day classic launches to sub.  I wonder how many of those people will go for a low pop server vs a higher pop one?
---
Myself and some friends are rolling Horde on Myzreal.
---
Aww crap  I just realized that realm is PST ... crap.
---
Nah I don't think it's that, I just think they really thought it wasn't technically possible to do so. But once Omar the God did his magic, he was more than happy to announce Classic.
---
Feel free to change it to copper, silver, or even [titanium](https://www.wowhead.com/item=44430/titanium-seal-of-dalaran).
---
what names were they
---
The first month of a phd program is chill as fuck.
---
yes
---
Well whenever you go to a sub and don't contribute anything, and shit on the purpose of the sub it's not surprising when you get banned, is it?
---
Sounds like something an alliance player would say
---
How does that help in determining realm population?
---
If my names are spread evenly across realms and I don't know what realm I'll end up playing on, how does Blizzard?
---
Means you need to use a lure.
---
I disagree a little bit here. I was absolutely wowed by every zone in outland. I remember being terrified of the Fel Reaveras and cackling when that hunter who wouldn't fuck off and kept trying to gank me got one shot by it. I remember Nagrand and just being completely at peace and grinding ogre beads for my Talbuk Mount. I remember Zangarmarsh absolutely annoying the piss out of me, but loving the soundtrack and the dungeons in the zone. I remember running around Black Temple and just not being able to wait to get inside and fuck up Illidan. Same goes for Netherstorm and Kaelthas in Tempest Keep. I do think they missed out on really making the blades edge mountains exciting as it was my least favorite zone aside from Terrokar Forest, even though the whole Draeni graveyard and mana bomb thing was cool though. I'm sorry, I went on a tangent, but parts of TBC and parts of WotLK were absolutely amazing and not a detraction from Classic at all
---
Unfortunately, if you read the comments, youd see how they all deserve the downvotes.
---
No because the only truly massive imbalances are on pve servers. You're not going to have the 95%-5% servers like on retail because those are the result of 15 years of transfers and crz making realms basically pointless.
---
OH MY GOD, This guy has a macro that every time he lands off of a griffin he yells..."Hello everyone I am here" and then he greets everyone warmly. OH my god...
---
If someone else hasn’t taken that name on that other server then yes you can use it. It’s per server
---
What are they specifically? Paladins MTd on private servers - it’s not 2005 anymore.
---
We thought you didn’t but you did.

---
I keep hitting the M key as you say, but it just moves my character forwards. Oh that's the W key. You must be full of shit. I can't ever be wrong
---
Yep! That's why I said medium is high enough to have a healthy population. Even after the inevitable departure of the tourists, there'll still be a viable population on the realm. However, we'll never have the 10,000 person queue that would plague the PvP servers because PvE servers are inherently less popular, and RP servers are the least popular of the PvE servers. We are basically the runt of Classic. XD
---
I mean you went on a subreddit dedicated to a specific game and called that game shit. What did you expect to happen? I have been banned from subreddits for less.
---
Edgy.

That part is not true at all. Raid bosses are mostly taunt immune.
---
can you link me to this survey please 🙏
---
If its red it's dead. Sign for free wii
---
On pservers yes, in actual classic the rep gains are like 60-70% lower
---
You have it backwards.
---
1. People voice concerns about problem
---
2. Problem gets fixed after complaints
---
3. BRUH Y U QQ
---
This logic is on the same level as ‘why do we need police if there’s no crime’?
---
Hard to really know but I feel like the people who have reserved names is only like 20% of the population. What % do you guys think
---
So what's wrong with resilience? I thought that's what took the PvP scene from a 1shot madness into coordinated battles.
---
Is this the Pantheon from Nost? If so is Kane coming back?
---
Can you do one for warlock? I don’t wanna be a new when the game comes out lol

&gt; Portal to Stonard
---
This was....not a thing in vanilla...was it?
---
Is this a consequence of players knowing all of the encounters beforehand, so you end up bringing all of the tanks / healers / DPS you need? No real room for a flexible class if you know what you need.
---
I can't speak for you.  But I realized I didn't take care of myself in my 20s and for a while it didn't matter.  As I rounded 30 I just had to take care of myself more than ever bit I feel better now than 25 after making some positive changes. 
---
Tough with a kid!  But try to be good to yourself physically and mentally and I hope things turn around like they did for me.
---
He's right though, I don't understand why they started with at least half the servers needed.
---
“You installed the game.”
---
Either he was bluffing with gesticulations and grunts or he must've had a Butler with an amulet that allowed him to speak bear.
---
How do you like that silver? 
---
...Oh, it's actually 1 gold for a portal? I hate portals...
---
Yeah pretty underrated movie imo
---
Can confirm. Am intersted but not subbed yet. That's as good as proof, right? RIGHT?  
---
I won't even be able join at launch, unfortunately. But about a week and half in.
---
Also worth to mention that creating new server today is blazing fast compared what it was back in days. If launch start to look really bad they need 10 minutes to roll new server up for people to play. I think their way to approach servers is better than making 10 servers now and see one or two of them ending up dead after couple of months.
---
My favourite one hander for sure. I remember killing Onyxia along with our main tank then running off to finish the quest, completely giddy. Good times.

Currently use this in retail for both my Belt Paladins tanking and healing weapons.

I'd ask if he's Horde or Alliance but maybe I'd rather not know. I don't want to potentially lose respect for one of my favorite actors...
---
Here comes the smart guy, thanks for the tip!
---
There’s still stuff to get from dungeons after MC’s on farm. Guildies work on alts and need a tank, etc.
---
Loved raid tanking, hated going back to trivial 5-mans and was a black sheep for that.
---

---
Should be it, if you still need it.
---
That's harsh, mate. I know there are cases, where the best management can't avoid crunch time because some phases in development simply can't be stretched. When things come together near the finshing line it's high noon. This happens at my company too, but we get godly paid for overtime that can't be avoided. That put more pressure onto a good project management and boosts the morale even in the long run because one feels rewarded for the sacrifice you make for the company.
---
Working in dev is no pushover, I hope you guys won't ever face burnout! Stay healthy, my friends.
---
Nailed it.  Use installed data and name reservation data from hundreds of thousands of players to judge demand.  There's probably a data model going within Blizzard to predict the likelihood of a player staying with the game past the first few months...
---
Its not even the queue times at launch that worry me. It's the queue times after phase 2 when they remove layering. I also deleted my good character names on Whitemane and I'm headed to Skeram.
---
Five of these possible at launch the rest is a long wait
---
Everyone is a "support" class, they all bring some utility outside of their holy trinity designation.  
---
Any good player can do what you describe regardless of class.  The more you rely on "support" or "utility" to justify your spot, the more likely you are to push your class toward fewer raid spots rather than more, and less secure dungeon spots.
---
Self-heals effects and abilities are not nearly prolific in classic.
---
Source on this?
---
Red = Overfed
---
Frostbolt will be the main spell you cast but there are plenty of fights where you need to remove curses also. Fact is more or less every classes rotation is fairly simple toughest being feral. In 5 and 10 mans mage is fun in my opinion as well as pvp.Once you get to AQ and Naxx you can go fire and that rotation will be more involved.
---
In classic you have to goto a Class Trainer and pay them to teach you skills and spells. Each rank costs more than the previous one.
---
When you look at your spell book you will actually be able to choose to use rank 1 even if you have learned 5 more ranks of the skill.
---
Why would anyone choose to do this, you wonder? Sometimes it is beneficial to use lower rank--or down ranked--skills and spells. Heals, for instance, in the later ranks become very costly on mana in a raid setting with longer boss engage timers so it is common practice to use a rank or two lower than max until you have the mana pool to afford the max rank thing. Or if you're healing DPS that don't need a more powerful heal because they are only missing a little HP. 
---
For Mages, they can cast r1 Frostbolt to apply the movement snare but it also has a slightly lower cast time. It won't do squat for damage, but in PvP it could save the mage's life. 
---
There are a few different settings this technique is useful, but as far as this guide is concerned, it would seem to me that it is a money saving tactic while leveling. Since unless you are farming and selling things to earn extra gold, you won't have enough money while leveling to learn every single thing from the trainer. you will often have to pick and choose what to spend your coveted gold on.
---
Shadow priests scale pretty badly. So maybe them? PvP is extremely gear dependent though so you will get ripped by pretty much everyone with gear that’s much better then yours. Even if you vastly outskill them.
---
Though I saw numbers above 20k when name reservation came up. Not sure if that disproves what you're saying though, since that could just be for name reservation.
---
That level 4 rogue was honor bound to defend Orgrimar from the invading alliance though, he was in his right to attack and the alliance started it with their invasion
---
I'll be damned.
---
Yes.
---
I downloaded the private client for a little taster. To lvl my warrior to 10 took 8hours 49 mins. My priest took just over 4 hours.
---
Albeit the quests were fresh in my head for the priest, but I forgot how tedious warrior was even at low levels, and I have 2 vanilla warriors and 3 more since wotlk. Get a 2h asap. Be prepared to corspe run a lot
---
why would u go to the retail subreddit and just shit on the game
---
EVERQUEST 2?!
---
The voice intro totally butchered the pacing. Much better when it goes straight to dwarf on the mountain.
---
I remember playing for 5 days straight once back in vanilla. I had a quest that made you kill some NPCs to get a single item to drop. It didn't drop until the 5th day after picking up the quest. I ground those NPCs into the earth for 5 days with short breaks to keep my sanity. RNG was just great.
---
Not sure why you feel the need to flame at all. People like what they like, if you hate retail then don’t play it. Your opinions literally mean nothing.
---
Nothing will happen if i make ppl think they got pickpocketted right?
---
Wasn't aware of that, thanks for the info.
---
Ah yep, I didn't realise that would get you back without affecting your bloodsail rep.
---
I did bloodsail back in BC. I wouldnt have minded the grind back, but it's extremely inconvenient not being able to go to the Goblin towns anymore.
---
They should carry on up to WOTLK, but when they move onto TBC create another sever just for people that want to play classic that won't go on into TBC and then the same for TBC when wrath comes out.
---

Ah, very nice. I was wondering exactly that, since there must be some sort of readable output from the random function. I am new to macros though,  am just discovering the magic through this post.

Nice painting :)
---
We should have 1 server for all the EU countries that subtitle their movies/series + the Brits, and one for all the other retarded countries that don't and hence don't speak English properly.
---
You could see exactly who they were, you didn't have to guess who they "spoke on behalf of". There's a website and a google doc documenting exactly which guilds were and still are a part of that coalition. This includes discord links to check each and every guild out individually. Just google "nordicclassic jinnis".
---
You know as opposed to this "4700 player norwegian discord" linked above with 839 members lol, just count for yourself.
---
I really doubt that
---
Believe it or not, those weapon specializations end up being a LOT more than 1%. Classic maths were wild.
---
It’s not really for raid bosses. A quick grab aggro button is pretty needed for certain fights and trash pulls. 
---
Also another main issue is active mitigation. Us Paladins lack a form of active mitigation and have to rely on passive mitigation to work. 
---
However this doesn’t mean you can’t or shouldn’t try. I know I’m going to give it my best shot, and see if I can do some main tanking for my guild. We’ll see what happens.
---
We're all gonna be 5 days behind everyone else because of the Con of Dragons lol.
---

---
I think most of the finnish went to gehennas with swedes as did i. 
---
Atleast 2 of the biggest guilds did.
---
I only have two wow accounts and my options are just “WoW1” and “WoW2”
---
The Trinity is Tank, Healer, and DPS.
---
DPS kills all the things
---
Healers keep everyone alive
---
Tanks absorb all the damage
---
Choose which role you enjoy.  Get into some dungeons early on to get a taste for how a 5-man group works.  This will help you decide what role you'd like to fill.
---
Every class has at least one spec that works for DPS.  Some can only do DPS.  IIRC, warlocks, mages, hunters, and rogues were always topping the meters in vanilla, and should be again in Classic.
---
Shaman, Paladins, Druids, and Priests all have healing specs, and when specced/geared properly are each very capable healers with their own styles and niches.  However, Priests are considered to be the all around best at healing.
---
Tanking in Classic WoW will be done by Warriors, Paladins, and Druids.  Just like healing, each class is very capable when geared/specced right.  Warriors are considered to be the best at this role.
---
The value you bring to your group isn't just tied up in those 3 primary roles, however.  There are many minor roles (off-tank, off-heals, CC, etc.) that can be filled by many classes, and are often crucial to the group's success.  Also, the class you pick may not be "the best" at any of these 3 roles, but you will have a unique utility that you provide that can make huge differences.  Shaman with their totems, hunters &amp; warlocks with their "6th man", and so much more.  Conjured food, wipe protection, AoE, CC, Lockpicking, summoning, and the list goes on.
---
In the end, just play what you find fun and cool.  Get good at it, and you'll never feel like you picked the wrong class.
---

Looking for 1 more dps for our mostly melee cleave. we have war/war/shaman/priest atm. Looking for a lock or hunter.

Going hard on launch day, then 12-14 hrs a day after launch.

i bet /r/Imaginaryazeroth or some variations of "r/imaginary_____" would like this
---
Not really.. Hmm a rogue maybe, maybe a hunter, maybe a mage, maybe a fury warrior maybe a healer..  Deffinetly not anything that tanks.
---
Cleave effectively doubles your AA damage for that swing, though, rather than just adding a small static modifier to a single target.
---
Also, I assume the suggestion to get 90+ rage on a solo target first plays into it.
---
Exactlythis. BC for sure not. BC was more like Vanila+
---

Yaa I guess thats something to consider. Don’t particularly expect myself to be that ahead anyway

you'll have to rig (elevate) your keyboard for the peak to press down on a button. Also how sensative your keyboard is too. If not, feel free to add a little bit of weight (1/4 or 1/5 lb) to give it enough momentum to press the key, but not enough to keep it down.

worth a try, it's like 5 bucks on amazon

Should be “as many”. If it’s countable say “many”, if it’s not countable say “much”.
---
&gt; They added two servers today. I have no problem with this.
---
I do.  They're adding too many servers.
---
My Life Goal is Classic. Looks like i am winner now.
---
Literally who? 
---
Nevermind, don't answer. Someone too stupid to press print screen isn't worth knowing anyway.
---
MoP is legit the last good expansion
---
Showing some real improvement here. Better be careful or you may accidentally graduate to "sorta shitty".
---
Unless they drop 10+ more servers before launch, ALL servers are going to have at least 2 hr queues at all times the first week.
---
They're all going to be full because Blizz is using layering to allow more people per zone, but not upping the amount of people that can be *in* the game at the same time by much. 
---
They're also allowing a LOT more accounts per server than they normally do in order to combat dead servers within 3 months of launch.
---
There's literally no way to avoid it on any server because a good portion of the players, like has been posted here over and over again, haven't even subbed yet because they don't care about paying early for a name.
---
We're gonna see at least 10-20k more people sub on Sunday night.
---
11999 queue was most anyone saw during name reservation on Shazzrah, i mean i assume the server can hold at least twice that much nowadays so a FULL server should be anywhere between 25-35k accounts.
---
I's a 10 second cast. And responding to the request, grouping up, waiting for them to come to you, it all adds up to at least a minute. At the Mage minimum wage, this is at least worth 1g PLUS the cost of the rune.
---
Thanks. Aren't those the BFA stats ? Can't seems to find Classic servers.
---
It's crazy how fast all the names like Bob and Jeff get taken.  I only got Fred, and Aw on the new realms.
---
I’ve never really played the alliance before, and I’m rolling human w/ diplomacy. So at this point I think I might shy away from an AOE build
---
Thanks for this!
---
If you are the type of person that really gets mad or annoyed at being ganked i would just roll RP. You can avoid a lot of ganking though if you just regularly group up with people and world pvp can be a lot of fun at times. I am rolling RPPVP myself and realize there will be times when Horde is driving me nuts and i am not accomplishing anything.
---
Desolace?
---
Firstly because that’s how it was launched back in the day, and this is supposed to strive for authenticity, and secondly because the PVP gear you got for climbing the ranks outperforms raid gear up to like AQ40, thus invalidating huge chunks of pve content. It’d massively imbalance the early months of the servers, and also severely throttle the chaos of world pvp
---
sounds like my dad. im responsible with wow because of it to say the least.
---
Despite what anyone may think, ferals are insane DPS they can't just ever get in the gear. When they have it though... WOW... :D  It's really their best spec -- they can pull big numbers. Tanking is kinda meh because they're dodge tanks, but they'e always a valid off-tank and there is a lot to off tank in vanilla.  Anyway, they're much more useful if you play them as "off-tank/flex dps" -- even more useful than a resto healer. (Druid healing is meh, at least if we're comparing to Pally, Shaman, or Priest... all of which beat them..) So, played right I'd still think a raid can use a flex tank with a battle res and even a limited off-heal capacity.  I still think they're a green on raids.  If you play a feral and think you're doing one thing during an encounter you suck, but if you are flexing you are a freaking god and your raid will know it.
---
I have 2 accounts with 6 names on 3 different servers.  Now, which of the three servers will I play on?  No one knows.
---
It's actually really good news that they are opening up new servers.  It means a few things.  First, they had nfi how many people were actually interested.  Second, they don't plan on using layering as a substitute for more servers.  Third, they aren't banking on player drop off to keep servers at a stable size.
---
There will be a mass exodus at the start of people who don’t really care, which I’m guessing is most.
---
As much as I appreciate it, I think this is the third leveling guide on this sub I've seen, and they all have only done Druid.  Give ya boy some mage guides!
---
I guess me and my 3 friends will be all alone on grobbulus :(
---
What is that apps Name?
---
the realm which the account reserved their first name on will 90% of the time be the one they intend on playing on.
---
I just picked that number out of my ass but you get my point. there are ways and techniques for predicting these things, and i'm sure they have someone well versed in these things in charge of this situation.
---
Well that's exactly where classic is headed in 15 years, so enjoy having your experience soured by that thought I guess haha
---
Soothe Animal helps to not agro extra mobs when pulling / looting / for party members that can’t stealth. So...
---
Oh well, that can be done :) One would still need to specify the commas and spaces in between the numbers, but the "a" is not needed. So it would be ,t,", ",t,
---
This had me deceased 😂
---
To be fair, undead is the worst horde race for a warrior. BiS animations AND the best mohawk from all horde races.
---
*bounce* *bounce*
---
How dare people demand payment for services only their time and energy can provide!
---
We have no clue either
---
Its the fastest and easiest dungeon tank, but the worst for raiding.
---
Druids are good for dung and raids
---
Warriors are the worst dungeon tank (im thinking time here! Not effectiveness) but the best raid tank (atleast after molten core and onyxia)
---
What would Bobby B say to this?
---
Just assume all the pvp servers will be 60/40 horde dominated the only server i have seen that so far is looking balanced is Grobbulus at 50/50 but it is RPPVP.
---
Somewhat true. If that picture is an accurate depiction of the hemispheres then spain and part of france are in the western hemisphere but they are not in the same timezone ad the UK but +1 so it releases on the 27th for them
---
AHHH
---
Why would You skip res? Its a quest reward
---
Look at "mowsen" on youtube
---
No. I don't need to know the numbers to have fun
---
The pointer is giving a loving caress .
---
My worry is not what they do; my worry is why they do it.
---
They could easily have prevented this by not allowing people to place names on multiple realms. Or only give people 1 name and then make the name-pool be shared between all types of realm (pvp/pve/rp) so they could potentially merge late on without anyone losing their names.
---
But according to the poll right now it's around 75% that only have names on 1 realm, so at least it's not super bad.
---
From what I've seen on various poles it seem about 55:45 Horde/Ally ratio on most servers. Close enough to balanced.
---
IT keeps reddit unblocked for their own benefit, but no reason to have a game website unblocked.
---
This is really awesome stuff thanks for sharing.
---
I remember getting the vanilla beta invite and honestly wasn't hugely excited. Whilst I loved WC3, I was playing the City of Heroes and Ryzom MMOs at the time, and my friend's guild on CoH was gaining traction and was a lot of fun, so that occupied most of my gaming time.
---
But, I installed the beta for WoW and started playing and just got hooked right from the start. My mate told me that it probably wouldn't be for me as I didn't like 'cartoony' graphics and he said i'd probably drop out in less than a year. 
---
Yet, here we are, 15 years later and i'm still playing and can't wait to get into Classic.
---
I was watching a video today about a guy who tanked most of the vanilla raid bosses with a bear. I'm glad to see that you acknowledge their skill for off-tanking, but I had to point out that they can actually be fantastic tanks for bosses as well! It depends on the boss, sometimes you just shouldn't have a feral MT, but it's a surprisingly low number. 
---
[Here is the Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyWQlXtkuJ0)
---
Great TPS, less dependent on armor, don't swipe warrior gear, better health, damage done to them is more consistent (easier on healers), there's a lot of benefits to using a druid for tanking. I hope people in classic are more open to them then they were previously. It took a while for people to realize their potential (by tbc, people better understood druid's tanking prowess). Luckily, we'll be on a patch that druids were strong in!
---
Is asking people to deliberate over their actions considered too much?
---
God forbid we analyze ourselves.
---
I’d say go shaman, my man. Healers always have a place in groups regardless of what the overall objective is. DPS spots on the other hand are usually a dime a dozen.
---
Dude are you blind.  You see those epic swirlies in the middle of the world thats the Maelstrom.  Gosh.
---
My friend is rolling warrior and will be levelling with us (mage, priest and warlock). We will be mostly questing, but also doing some dungeons. Can they use this spec to tank for us in the odd dungeon as well?
---
Heres the thing. This isnt just RP. Its RPPVP. So its people who PVP (like you already do) but with the passion of RP. RPPVP goes hard. They look for reasons to start wpvp and keep it going. They want to be invested in their pvp just like theyre invested in their characters. When I first started in vanilla, I played on Rp servers. Then I moved to a pvp server. Then I ended up on an Rppvp server. There was so much more action on the rppvp realm that I felt like I had been missing out for nearly a decade on something special.
---
Give it a go.
---
I think the threat game in raids will be a newer and fun concept for me, i’m leaning towards lock now!
---
Never heard bad mannered in my life. Always heard it said as bowel movement (or beast master in WoW as you mention). Definitely not something the OP made up.
---
You don't hear ppl say "I gotta make a BM" because it's an extremely polite term for poop, and the people who feel the need to use it will refrain from referring to poop unless absolutely necessary... In which case they'll say BM or bowel movement.
---
\&gt; Mana users will love you for innervate

No, they won't, lol.

# &lt;Versus&gt; [Herod] [H] [PvX]
---
*"Your new home away from home."* **&lt;Versus&gt;** is a grounded, welcoming, and steadfast North American based guild that will not put up with racism, toxicity, or generally negative people. We are open to Vanilla veterans and inexperienced players alike.
---
This guild's foundation is a group of friends that met in retail Legion &amp; Battle for Azeroth, coming together to realize our dreams of returning to official Vanilla World of Warcraft. We are led by cutting edge Vanilla raiders including myself; a former member of Exodia on Skullcrusher that evolved to become Exo on Smolderthorn. **&lt;Versus&gt;** will not be nearly as hardcore nor elitist as Exo was back then. Mind you, this lifestyle choice will not affect our desire, and ability to push every tier of content to the limit.
---
Vanilla was/Classic will be a truly massive social experience. To that point, **&lt;Versus&gt;** is a guild that plays the game for fun and values the people we play the game with. We understand that each of our members are individuals with lives outside of the game; and even further we appreciate the time each member puts into growing together as a guild and as friends. We hold dear these friendships we make in the process.
---
**RECRUITMENT**
---
**These recruitment needs pertain directly to the guild raid roster's needs.**
---
*At any given time you may find one of these symbols next to your class' listing to indicate their current level of need within the roster:* 🟩🟨🟧🟥
---
* **DRUID:**   NEED   🟩
---
* **PRIEST:**   OPEN  🟧
---
* **SHAMAN:**   OPEN  🟨
---
\_
---
* **ROGUE:**   OPEN  🟨
---
* **WARRIOR:**   NEED 🟩
---
* **MAGE:**   NEED  🟩
---
* **HUNTER:**   NEED  🟩
---
* **WARLOCK:**   OPEN  🟨
---
*( We are always looking to recruit people who push the boundaries of their role. Should your class be closed and you still want to join/raid with the guild ... you can join the guild under the pretense that you are an alternate in case a main raid member is unable to make the raid and/or wishes to sit the raid. )*
---
**Raid Schedule:** To Be Determined. We do know that we will raid two nights each week. Likely to be weekdays.
---
We will employ a **Loot Council** system, with a side-variable based on raid attendance.
---
What **&lt;Versus&gt;** expects of you:
---
* **Punctuality &amp; Preparation**. Be on time for raids and come prepared with consumables.
---
* **Competent** level of play. We don't expect everyone to have as much experience that some of us have. But we do expect you to be capable of learning from mistakes and persevering through the adversity that we will inevitably face as a guild.
---
* **Communication**. Discord will be mandatory during raids. It's there to use at your leisure outside of raids. If there is something preventing you from making a raid night or at most will make you late to raid ... use Discord and let us know ahead of time!
---
* Be a **Team Player**. We are looking for dedicated like-minded individuals that want the entire guild to make progress, not only themselves.
---
* Most of all, we expect you to **HAVE FUN** playing the game. If you ever reach a point where you're not having fun playing the game ... reach out to your fellow members, talk to us. We want to know what's going on.
---
**Discord:** Under construction

ROFLMAO ME TOO BRO!I hate I didn’t get to make this awesome post.No dancing trolls on mailboxes for me:(
---
I mean they're... pretty good. And all combine multiplicatively:
---
+15% on your finisher
---
1 second more on your opening stun (aka one more Shred)
---
-20% energy cost for Shred
---
6% more crit
---
Double combo points on crit
---
Attack power increased by 150% of your level
---
Plus the single most powerful talent in the game for leveling: 30% increased movement speed starting at level 20.
---
Best spec star?
---
You can't right click report the opposite faction.
---
I was unaware a game called world of warcraft existed. I only found out on release because the day it launched i went to chat to my cousin in a game store and he told me to buy it
---
yea that sounds fair and totally makes sense. thanks!
---
No, because there won’t be any significantly imbalanced PvP servers. There aren’t enough of them in the first place
---
I am sure they realize that they likely have additional numbers and metrics also like new subscriptions they may even only count the server where people created there first character because that is often where people will head. Assume though 60% spread there names out Blizz can make a likely guess.
---
Or 2 or 3 buttons depending on class, yes.  I was just trying to point out damage isn't the only thing you do and all classes are pretty much limited on what they need to do during raid.  If you want to play mage, don't be discouraged because there is another class out there that uses 2 buttons more often instead of one.  It's not that big of deal all the classes are limited.
---
Man everyone is jealous of you.
---
I hope you’re wrong but in the case you’re not I will definitely level a shammy regardless of my first pick to level.
---
That’s honestly why I haven’t bothered to switch.I got the 3 I wanted on Herod.If I can’t make anymore on the new servers they’re pushing out it’s pointless.
---
great suggestion thx.
---
/r/latestagecapitalism
---
Probably will start to see the drop offs a few months after all the phases have been released.
---
Great, now I HAVE to roll a rogue on the RP-PvP server just to pickpocket people or flip a coin to decide their fate as they sit sapped.
---
As said by the other bloke, use Teamviewer back to your home PC from work, and just login their.
---
Free app called Mousejiggler that can keep you from going afk in game
---
Skipping PVP abilities? That's a terrible idea, you're going to be forced to WPVP a lot if you're on a pvp server.
---
And Exorcism helps you kill mobs a lot quicker in Duskwood, don't skip it unless you're not planning to go there.
---
lol.  I am embarrassed for you.  Read the TOS again.  Do a little research before you repeat bullshit.
---
This sub isn't your diary, nobody gives a shit! Hpefully you get banned here too.
---
LMFAO!
---
having a single server means you put all the au/us/canadian/mexican/brazilians all on a single rp realm.
---
if you are having issues rping on this realm then something tells me there just isn't that many aussies interested in doing this and making a server just for them isn't a very good idea for population health.
---
Thing is, a lot of people here, between reserving their names and just all of their pent-up excitement and anxiety over the last weeks and months and years. That has led to this, and they are preemptively shoving all of this emotional energy and investment into whatever Ultra crowded server they reserved names on.
---
That's their Community now. Even though the server has not launched. They're anxious not to lose not only the name, but this experience on this specific server they have built up in their heads.
---
S***, I didn't have this much of an emotional investment built up in retail wow until around the middle of cataclysm.
---
But hey, each person has two handle their own emotional investment and whatever way they think they will get pay off.
---
I will be rolling alliace as always. I will fight the horde as always. Step up butter cup.
---
Commenting for this warrior cheat sheet later

[r/thalnosdidnothingwrong](https://www.reddit.com/r/thanosdidnothingwrong/)
---
I thought he was a human paladin. Literally Superman.
---
The Norwegian community? You mean ~50-60 Norwegian people who are on this discord server. There will be plenty norwegians, swedes, danes on every EU server for them to make their own guilds and communities. I don't get these posts.
---
Summing at query time, or even caching the value in that way (summing thousands of times) would be a severe run time hit. Its likely stored as is alongside other realm stats and is incremented whenever a character is created.
---
Skeram would one hit Herod.
---
Good luck brave soldiers.
---
You just don't let your kids have birthdays obviously.
---
Whatever it takes.
---
Its 15 years until retail.. I don't care either way but settle the fuck down.
---
haha my wow name is "dontwave" 
---
just so i have an excuse to kill people who /wave without looking
---
Past all that. My 7 year old wants to play with me. Im trying to find a laptop for him since I dont have money for a computer.
---
There was an awkward period where BM was quite good, but then pets were nerfed at some point to keep hunters from face rolling content. I partially remember scorpid poison being hotfixed as it was scaling FAR too well in late vanilla.
---
There are probably guilds that will let you do that massive hybrid class strategy, but realistically speaking both the druid and the paladin classes shine when the talents are built around specializing in one area. Just like most classes in the game you will be incorporating multiple talents from different trees to get the most bang for your buck. The thing is that I've personally never seen a resto druid in my group go 
---
"Hey that mob is running away lemme go bear form and pull it for my tank real quick"
---
when normally they're the only druid in the group, Everyone has their specific roles and it really helps simplify things if people would generally stick to them. Like you wouldn't want your Prot pally to start saying
---
"Ah who needs to generate threat when you could just hit top DPS"
---
The dudes who should be hitting that top DPS are your DPS guys you brought to the dungeon and the guy keeping you all alive is the healer ( who hopefully is doing their job ) :)
---
I hope I shed some light on it for you, but hey if you wanna be that ultra hybrid guy .. then I encourage you to do so and enjoy the game you wanna play it!
---
Bullshit, if that is what you meant to imply you would have said it. lol, nice try Trump.

Hmm, I don't like the west coast server name.

Bruh you sound like a kid
---
nothing
---
I reserved a name! For the horde!
---
He didn't.  He was wrong also and missed your bullshit.
---
saw this on his insta story, he'll probably be playing on an EU server
---
I believeeee Herod does have a subreddit that you could specifically recruit on as well :)
---
Only issue I ever came to was raid time schedules. Being on the west coast it's hard to be ready for the raid at 7pm EST when that's 4pm PST and I'm still at work.
---
The tribute run still made sense. A chest did not just "pop up". An ogre came in and planted it down. And it even made sense in the setting and the story that was told.
---
I've been on holiday for three weeks and unable to access a PC to change mine... So I'm stuck as a Priest even though I've settled on Paladin :(
---
I mean just look at the roles, do you want to heal or dps?
---
For the alliance sister! Let's bathe in the blood of our enemies
---
“Will you help me find my dog? 😞”
---
Which is cool, I'm not trying to bash 'em. I just have *opinions*, man.
---
Ah, a fellow Shockadin?
---
Apparently a good number
---
Right? Like is this an actual question?
---
Because naturally the roleplayers needed multiple servers. Same thing on eu realms
---
Both! i’m just looking big picture what would be more enjoyable in the long run
---
r/HerodClassic
---
I say resto because I'm warlock and I wanna group up, so I'm biased. 
---
Having said that, juxtapose your desire to kill vs your desire to protect and you shall have your answer. 
---
Alternatively, do both.
---
Fucking hate hunting for those specific moonkins.
---
Yep they chose some french name for a west coast server. I honestly can't even pronounce it properly why would I switch.
---
Ok, how is this? This is a cheap PC on sale at a local chain store.
---
&gt;2.6 GHz 7th Generation AMD A6-9225 dual-core processor and 8 GB DDR4-1866 SDRAM combine to deliver speedy performance that's perfect for power users and multitaskers
---
&gt;AMD Radeon R4 Graphics card provides crisp and clear images while playing games and watching videos
---
Thing is I have no idea whether that's better or worse than the minimum specs they list.
---
People move, might not be a lot. But enough to lower the stress of the server.  
---
The new servers are also needed for the new influx of people.
---
People will move when they sit in their 5 hour queues on launch night and everyone else is able to play.
---
He was just abit strange I think
---
&gt;Of course he didn't say he was wrong during the same Q&amp;A
---
Sorry, I meant Q&amp;A's...or whatever you wanna call the event that the two clips came from. 
---
As to the owning up part - I'm glad to hear that he actually owned up to it - I was seeing a lot of people post comments similar to yours and I was confused because the video OP posted doesn't show him apologizing for it.
---
Ye. Looks fun as frick
---
Ok, how is this? This is a cheap PC on sale ($400 CAD) at a local chain store.

I'm in the same boat. Spent months certain I was going to be a Dwarf Priest... Now I've settled on Human Paladin but Warlock does keep tempting me :/

---
Personal responsibility? Wtf?
---
Wasnt there a rumor back in the day that Horde got blood elves to boost their numbers as they were outnumbered on most servers?
---
If spergs want to wait in a 10k queue because they have emotional attachment to their unimaginative name that 5,000 other people use then let them. Clearly population is redistributing from the fact that the newly released servers aren't listed as low population.
---
prob an instant 70 private server.
---
you'd 99% of the time glance at it and think "cool new WoW expansion" and never notice the outrageously tiny font that says "Classic" and even if you did never realize that means they are bringing back real official vanilla WoW
---
I'm quite glad to be an AU player with dedicated Oceanic servers. Last I checked they were at medium population.
---
I'm fine with this 😊
---
Plus one or plus three it doesn’t really matter it it’s probably rounded anyhow.

Aliance or Horde
---
As an aspiring warrior main please take me under your wing
---
you should go to the character select screen, read the class descriptions and pick which one you think sounds the coolest to you.
---
its not boomkin spec its a balance/resto hybrid and its strong as fuck for world pvp.  should definitly be a green tick on that one.
---
Good point, the character limit needs to have 3 additional temporary slots which automatically relinquish after about 10 minutes or so, to give flexibility to those who want to be sure they can get their names on the new server without risking their current names. That would help many, for sure.
---
\*couldn't care less.... damn those destroy me too
---
playing on old and high &gt; playing on new and low
---
10/10 troll going to be hilarious seeing people level off this guide and all the " warriors are shit at levelling reeeeeee" posts next week.
---
That’s another problem as well.Guilds have made their toons and picked the server they wanna roll on.Now they’re either going to fight the queue and try to get together or try to get the whole guild to move.I think that’s more frustrating than not having the names you want.
---
I honestly want to come back and play classic and with old guildies/some family members. I’ve been gone for years, after dedicating almost 6 years of my life to WoW. Just saving to build a compatible PC to run it. Especially for the return of Classic!
---
87% of the population now, checked it earlier today.
---
Don’t worry about what other people think, try it out if you think you will like it, the worst that can happen is you don’t enjoy it and quit, but at least you tried
---
Congrats?  I guess classic is where the elitist jerks go.  Glad you are spreading the word. /s
---
hey. first of all thanks for posting my vid :)). i'm an amateur and this is probably my first vid ever. some clarification:  
---
\- stuttering happens because i used scripts to move mouse on classic 2005 model viewer, when pulling dropdowns to start animations it lags. i made like 20000 cuts to reduce that but yeah..  
---
\- there are no bows in 2005 model viewer  
---
\- the animations are original 2005, not retail as mentioned, but the viewer is bugged and i cant guarantee every animation fits its class, but they should!  
---
\- the zoom out thing, i would do that different if i did it again, but its too late. i used a 200" monitor to create it and now i see it sucks on mobile or small screen...  
---
for me its all undead :)))) have fun on 26.!
---
I love shitposts like this. Keep them coming.
---
Right on! Appreciate the heads up. I'm still not very reddit savvy, so I'll have to try and find my way there.
---
Honestly I wouldn't worry about a hardcore AOE build unless you're a seasoned mage who's actually gonna aoe grind most of the time.
---
Whether or not it's more efficient depends on your skill, knowledge, and the rest of your group. Wiping on AOE pulls is devastating to your leveling speed. I would just feel what plays right to you. Typical frost specs feel great to level up since there's so much synergy.
---
We don’t want your kind here
---
It won’t work at launch, have fun sharing your 3-4 mob groups with 8 other mages
---
those guilds weren't even full guilds. and on the reddit survey it was 6% BR pop
---
The people who wait will have a better experience for sure.
---
Not just in the pvp aspect.

Put a spike on your shield and use ret aura.  Let the mobs kill themselves.

I have heard the legend of the Manual Crowd Pummeler, I just can't see myself spending a lot of time grinding for something that is consumable like that.
---
Thank you so much for the advice!
---
I like both.  Can we have both?  Give us pure BC and WotLK servers and then also give us Classic+.  Should be super easy, they probably already have a button for that!
---
imo i've never been a big fan of gathering professions while leveling. usually i pick skinning and nothing else. it is actually a huge time sink to have to backtrack and gather after you complete a zone. it is a lot more time efficient to get to 60 and then worry about your gold farming/epic mount grind/professions.
---
Yeah people forget this drama
---
WotLK’s Naxx was this easy because it was the testing ground for Raiding Achievements (which were introduced in LK’s prepatch) for Blizzard. Basically the idea was to make the raid very easy, BUT to make fights harder for the players willing it via achievements (which requires you to kill bosses in specific ways, keeping some adds alive through the fight for example) . And even Naxx 10 raiding achievements were far from trivial, as many guilds didn’t manage to make them in time to get the Plagued Proto Drake reward (Black Proto Drake for 25 men mode, indiscriminately of normal/heroic difficulty). 
---
It wasn’t a stupid thing to do, but tbh the end result was that the base raid was too simple.
---
Remember that when you use heroic strike, you're not just losing the rage listed on the tooltip, but the rage you would have generated from the white hit. Heroic strike is more expensive than it looks.
---
So I take it you couldn't get the name Aaron?
---
Warlock would be so good for this.  Lifetap and lvl 60 spells + demons.  You'd never need any gear.
---
Many seem to think back with rose-tinted glasses and claim that toxicity wasn't present in Classic. I do disagree with that notion. There is a degree of toxicity that is associated with Classic, yes. However, we will not stand for having any of it in our guild.
---
Im definetly sold on the druid viability train! I'm going to tennatively plan to level warrior (assuming im not destroyed trying to do it while streaming with my 5ish viewers on herod xD), and i'm really hoping to run into a good druid buddy along the way. They seem like the perfect compliment to warrior for raids, as less gear competition is always great and they can fill in as MT for the fights where druids have the edge.
---
i’m here to chat about classic wow.
---
&gt; I am not worried about getting to 60 faster than anyone else
---
That's good, because you sure as shit won't be if VW is gonna 'be your best friend' until Lv60. You're gonna find out the hard way just how average his threat generation is.
---
There are a whole bunch of significant map design issues that cause Horde to have a disadvantage though. AV changed a lot in TBC but in classic is a much harder for Horde to win.
---
Im worried about balance shifting with all the moves.  Im thinking each new server will slide toward alliance with a ton of horde players staying put, private server people and such.  Just a wild guess, but something I worry could happen.
---
Wut
---
Whats the point in arguing and trash taking anymore, just makes you look chlidish and quite rightly got you banned If you can not provide any meaningfull dialogue to the conversation but trashtalking.
---
Im overly hyped for classic but will probably still play some retail down the line with my friends.
---
Stop trashtalking and lets enjoy the best of both worlds.
---
I mean, I don't see a problem. People who won't move are gonna be stuck in queues and that's their choice.
---
I like the idea of burning crusade. Maybe wotlk without group finders and other bullshit mechanics that came and ruined the immersion of the game itself. Then alternate timeline different shit new stuff who knows. Or just classic happens and a meteor comes and plants a new continent with a playable alien race and we get pew pew lasers and it turns into a FPS with magic and fuck who cares just play the game.
---
No race mixing in WoW. Dems da roolz
---
Looks like they are working as intended ;)
---
I was planning on aoe grinding as I had a lot of fun doing that my first go around. The leveling guides  people have put out a really good though and I think I'm just going to follow one of those this time around.
---
You don't need to be Windows 10 Pro to remote in, only if you're using Microsoft's own RDP. There's tonnes of 3rd party options which even work from mobile devices!!
---
I'll be using Anydesk which looks nice and lightweight and also free. 
---
Also, look into wether your router supports Wake-on-LAN as you can then wake your pc up before logging in so you don't need to leave your pc on all day
---
He asks for the easiest class to stay relevant for a while and you come up with shadow priest in PvP gear???
---
i'll be using my own slightly tweeked aoe build as mage when it launches up until raid content.  Every bit of dungeon content is easily doable with an aoe spec for mage.
---
Unless you're fighting mobs higher level than you, 5 weapon skill is only .5% hit, so yeah, axe spec is worth it. The best weapons from 30ish through the 40s as a warrior are 2h axes, so it's practically a straight +5% crit.
---
I feel like Son if Arugal should be on that list
---
I use to keep any random trash or white item I came across with what I deemed to have an auspicious name. Like one day I was going to pick up the right peice of garbage filler item and it turn out to be the one thing you needed to get a legendary sword or turn out to be the hidden immunity idol. But sometimes a stick is just a fucking stick!
---
Im sorry if i have to dissapoint you... but your chances of getting this Mount are reaaaally slim
---
Thank you for putting this out! It took me forever to pick a main class... and I think I’m set. Or am I? Ah, I just feel like rogue offers the most utility for my playstyle :)
---
I don't have an active sub atm and i still need to download the game, im waiting for the last few days, i don't live in the USA so it not as big of an issue for me, but im curious to see all the current realms pop levels
---
You'll be fine. Stress quest queue times for 12,000 were six minutes.
---
It's like that jump in Wailing Caverns, no one is gonna make it
---
Don't turn this into /r/wow and it's constant art pls
---
For 5 man dungeon anything works.
---
For most of the guides, I've tried to avoid touching on hybrid specs, as that goes into too much detail for a guide designed as a quick glance for noobies sort of thing.
---
that is particularly why I had lots of trouble with the guide, as druids tend to be extremely hybridy compared to other classes that may dabble in a tree, but very clearly lean toward one or another.
---
You definitely got bear tanking wrong. It is absolutely viable. It was viable in vanilla, was further elaborated on on private servers, and now with the new macro system they can even drink pots in fights.
---
I never realized until now that's when I get to play it. Man.
---
Watch esfand
---
My new server.
---
As long as I don't roll on the same server as asmongold I think I'm okay with rolling on the same realm as a streamer. Nothing personally again him, just a pretty toxic fan base.
---
I really hope a majority of the player base doesn’t know what you are referring to.
---
No, they have the choice of considering you 1/3rd on each realm aswell. I don't think things are as simple as you make them out to be.
---
No rotation is fun, no matter what class you play all you’re doing is hitting some numbers on a keyboard, I believe the fun comes from the teamwork and achieving victory over bosses, not pressing some keys in a certain order but that’s just me
---
Canadian bacon, pineapple, jalapeno. Salty, sweet, spicy in every bite.
---
Perpare to rarely die, drink often, and kill things slowly
---
Hah same here married for 16 and together for 17. I don't ask for shit unless I'm severely inconveniencing my wife. I have good taste, she knows it and we're both really easy going.
---
no idea about ffxiv or eso, but priests are a solid healer choice. you have the biggest toolkit, having an instant shield, heal over time, single target, aoe, health buff, resurrect and dispel.
---
shamans have good aoe with chain heal and passable single target. most shaman value is in their totems which offer great buffs to party members.
---
druids are jack of all trades master of none. they have hots but mostly spam healing touch in raids, they have innervate which will give mana regeneration to the friendly target, the only resurrect they have is a battle resurrect which is on a large cooldown, so if your group wipes it sucks as a druid.
---
I am not programmed for fair PvP.
---
And look where all those money from our pockets got us. To the fucking BFA! :(
---
BE PATIENT. You will die, a lot. High risk, high reward.
---
wrong sub?
---
So you gonna post this 23 more times?
---
Stealthers and hunters will beat the shit out of everyone
---
Rogue at 4 and Warlock at #1 doesn’t seem right.
---
You buff the raid*
---
Shhhhhhhhhhh
---
Just lol, and some ppl say there are no stupid questions
---
Stop
---
Dude it is obnoxious. Some people must be fking allergic to the slightest notion that blizzard isn’t absolutely perfect
---
Let me know if you changed your mind until ~Level 30. Voidwalker threat will disappoint you big time, at least that is my guess after having played both the beta and a lot on private servers as well. Voidwalker threat in Classic is nowhere near its threat on private servers. I believe it is a lot smarter to go Drain Tank asap.
---
Yes, bears get 2 AP per str, but it's not enough to make it better than agi. Crits, armor, dodge.
---
Perhaps not, but the online petition that received hundreds of thousands of signatures after Nostalrius shut down is a good indication of how many are interested in Classic.  Then consider the amount of people who didn't know the online petition existed.
---
I think you misunderstand my point.  
---
people with an active sub could create characters. this includes people who are still mostly interested in the current game.  
---
if you wanted to save your name, even if you are not really interested in classic, but want to do it anyways just because, then you were forced to create your toon on one of the first servers.  
---
which means that the earlier realms will have many BfA players who saved a name there to try out vanilla a bit.  
---
new realms on the other hand will get people who sub right before the actual launch. people who only sub because of classic. i.e. the ones that are truly interested in this.
---
play with the talent tree a bit. you don't really get very good kitty talents until pretty deep into feral. i imagine a resto kitty wouldn't do too bad, honestly, although I've never tried it (and wouldn't, feral is beastly fun)
---
There's been like an estimated 1mil + people to sub. All US servers prob have around 125k players. Add EU and the rest maybe 300k-400k? All these servers are high-full and we except like almost 2.5x the base currently. WE'RE ALL DOOMED !!
---
Here's a simple cheat sheet I made based off of [Dive's Drain Tanking Guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qdUs229_XvkR1NCeTrJkybL5BDXGIh7q/view). Definitely read through the guide before you use this as a bunch of the later talents are optional and there is a ton of info not included in the sheet.
---
They released Shazzrah and Golemagg at the same time, of course it's difficult to quantify community sentiment but if we go by the discords: Shazzrah discord has 15,600 members Golemagg has 6000. If they released 10 servers at once, one would be named the "must-play" server by every doomsayer in the community that thinks all other servers will die, in turn it inevitably becomes several times larger than all the other realms. This isn't really an issue specifically caused by release schedule.
---
Upping the realm-caps significantly and waiting for each and every server to fill up, in my opinion, is the best move they could do. If Blizzard is guaranteeing each server and all the players who choose to join them that they will essentially be a mega-server by vanilla WoW standards they're giving those players assurance that moving realms won't be a huge mistake and a waste of time on their end. 
---
Of course this does kind of screw over "low-pop players" who want to play on low/medium realms (low/medium by 2004 standards - not the increased current caps) but that's a much smaller audience by definition.
---
Zenns is easy enough to skip. Denalan is a little more important XP-wise if I remember correctly. Skipping either won't impact you much after you get out of Teldrassil, though doing so may slow down your leveling.
---
Nope, only the swedes moved to gehennas
---
Who even is that suffix for?
---
But imagine that you finally get the item to drop, you're so happy. You equip it and use it for a couple weeks. Then they release the next patch and your top of the line weapon is now at the bottom, until you farm the SAME ITEM AGAIN, only this time it has a higher number next to it. God I hate retail.
---
Apparently Eagles, Falcons &amp; Monkeys play too
---
I have read that, was not noticeable for me at 15 but I am sure thing will get a lot different after that, there are 2 guides that are out from this past week that still go VW, but may be that those people are going off of private servers as well.
---
&gt; sounds like a typical alliance (imma kill people lower level cause people my level are scary). 
---
lololololol
---
... Yes a sub is a sure death sentence in 2019. All those 25+ year old nerds simply don’t have 10 bucks a month. They prob don’t have a credit card! Piss off with this bandwagon moronic bs dude
---
Y I K E S. Totally forgot about those tbh. Glad I'm skipping NE for launch.
---
I've seen there's the azeroth auto pilot for classic on the twitch app, thing is, is it made for retail or classic since I bet the quest givers etc. are on other positions in classic, or?
---
Yep.  In fact there’s a quest that requires it!
---
You play DotA? You’ll fit right into the toxicity if you play a pvp server.
---
You dont need to post it 12 times.
---
Which ones are left now? Or is that the last one?
---
Please end with a post that has all of them in it :)
---
I think you misspelled Paladin
---
As an Alliance player, pretty glad to have them on my side :D
---
I remember it being hard lol but doable easy with a partner
---
cool i guess, but what functionality does this have over the ingame map. these "look what i made" posts are getting annoying
---
This is so gay lol
---
If it had just said 12am I would have thought it was noon. Good thing I see the other times.and the date line there as well. Who had the brilliant idea that 12am should be midnight and not noon? I mean you have 10am, 11am and then suddenly 12pm... it doesn't make sense.
---
Bad phrasing, PVE i thought of, how much do I miss out on Wpvp (will be a big part earlier on)
---
Because Strength is AP, so you mix AP and AP. And for paladins Strength is far superior as 20 Str and 40 AP are the same item budget, but 20 Str are 48 AP for a paladin.
---
It makes sense with agility for rogues as 1 agi is only 1 AP and a bit of crit. So adding pure AP there is a different type of statline. But for Stength based classes putting AP on an item instead of Strength or mixing the two is just terrible. It matters less on horde side, but on alliance thanks to kings strength is always better than pure AP.
---
Bustea and Ettern are currently working on their horde guides i think they should be ready until launch
---
Bustea: https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/guidelime-busteas-12-60-leveling
---
Etterns should be coming this weekend
---
Cool, thanks for the info!
---
This is probably correct. Took French for seven years myself. Could be wrong, but if so, I'm guessing it's some weird rule like what you occasionally find in English.
---
What a cool fucking mom.
---
Would it make sense to set the minimum bid as a percentage (maybe 20%? not sure if that’s too little or too much) of each persons DKP total? That way those with more DKP would tend to win over those with less as it should be, but the percentage will provide a larger sink to keep some balance and discourage hoarding. Combined with blind bidding so that someone with less total DKP can potentially win if they are willing to dump more than 20% for it.
---
I’m planning on being a guild leader in classic and would definitely rather go with a well designed DKP system over loot council (It would also be difficult for me to find people with the right character to do it properly, as I’m only starting this with one RL friend who will likely not be a hardcore raider, so would have to put trust in those I recruit and promote to higher ranks if I were to have a loot council)
---
I like the idea of providing that capitalistic motivation so that people really want to show up and earn their fair share, even if some loot is not perfectly allocated for optimal progression, also to avoid drama and corruption by having the system completely laid out and transparent. 
---
Curious on your thoughts!
---
It was. They could have gauges it without charging for it, and they perfectly well should have. You don’t charge players for testing your game dude. This wasn’t the least of it either: the first beta was a ton of money, and the second was charged for 2.
---
He called retail shit on the retail sub reddit...
---
Quit spamming this
---
You can try to log in in the morning and hopefully by the time you get back from work it'll have popped.
---
I dont blame blizzard for what they did. When you need money you do what is needed to bring players back to the game. It is part of the reason they are still In business 10 years later.
---
Is the pvp gear somewhat equal to PvE gear?
---
I like how everyone keeps forgetting about Fairbanks.
---
Or you know they could have been a billion dollar company with decades of experience and found a way around that, like not opening it up to fresh accounts.
---
When you're tanking, revenge takes care of itself through the use of shield block. While leveling, don't talent for block. Block's value for mitigation is that you can't be crit/crushed on a block. Outside of raid bosses or tanking a lot of low damage adds, block doesn't really matter.
---
What class
---
I haven't subbed, won't until like the 2nd last day but i might bump that up now to make sure i get on an actual server ffs....
---
Looks like I will be just hanging out in Goldshire on Bloodsail Buccaneers
---
&gt;It's.. Meh, for pvp, in any case. If I need to chase some one I can mount up. If I need to run away, I can stun, run and mount up just never seen any use for it ever, and I always play on PvP servers..
---
I can't mount in combat. I can stun once, but on a 60 sec cooldown. I don't see why you would pass on Repentance on those grounds.
---
This is why I would choose to have Repentance:
---
Its a free interrupt on a range. It let's you catch up when being kited. It gives you the opportunity to heal uninterrupted. It doubles your Judgement of Command damage. It is nice redundancy with grenades. You can incapacitate a healer in a 2v1 while you burst down the other guy.
---
I remember I was in the bathroom, door locked. I was mid stroke and deep into a picture book when my older brother pounded on the door and told me to come check it out.
---
I pray for all you brave souls.
---
My current plan is to sleep through midnight release and see what the login gods say around 6:00 before taking the dog out and I'm not even confident about that :/
---
You think blizzard don’t know what they’re doing? It will work out
---
Something with the subreddit caused it to batch post all my failed attempts, I'm trying to delete them now lol
---
mage?
---
Aoe Frost mage
---
No, because I only ever play one class/spec for a few years, but I‘d love to know.
---
Have they posted how large battlegroups will be?
---
Then you count as 1/3 of a person on each server.
---
Jeah but first arcane and than fire? until you have clearcast?.. my fear of going fire would be.. warrior does stuff and you sit there drinking.
---
I played the stresstest, and mana is eaven as frost an issue
---
I always used teamviewer for this back in the day. WotLK and Cataclysm had massive queues on my server. Started loging in before I went home from work after being told from my friends what the queue was.
---
First thing that came to mind was paladin. How’d I do?
---
lol dude got called out twice in 3 comments on this not being vanilla
---
It was (is, even?) definitely the case for a while. Though looking at all the censuses we've had on here now, I don't think that's a concern anymore. I would absolutely love to see high elves or even going down the route of completely splitting the lore and getting alliance blood elves.
---
Blizzard have data and metrics far in excess of what you could ever imagine, as well as outsourced information. You’re so naive to think a publicly listed company as large as Activision Blizzard doesn’t have this all squared away. Only college kids and high schoolers would think like this.
---
Defeat each of the final raid bosses, kill 1337 enemies in PvP, collect your whole first set of tier gear, fully explore every zone, reach max level with a horde and alliance character, and finally dance in the tavern in goldshire as a horde player
---
MAKE MINE PLS
---
You could see 12k que 2 hours after name reservations started. Im willing to be they have 50-100k accounts made chars on that fucking server.
---
Appreciate the kind words, thank you :)
---
I don’t remember what I did last week never mind 10 years ago
---
&gt;However some people are stubborn and insist that they can pass the queue
---
People are insane. Why don't they just switch?
---
Because they should've add more servers before name reservation when most guilds chose their realms.
---
AWWW DUDE
---
I\`d rather spen half an hour in queue than having my char stuck on a Low po server 2 months from now.
---
/r/lostredditors
---
I think it would be ideal if they had login queues for **PvP** servers split per-faction, to help encourage and maintain faction balance.
---
It wouldn't work for PvE servers, but it also doesn't *matter* on them. World PvP balance is the only consideration, as battlegrounds will be crossrealm.
---
They call him dovahkiin... dragonborn!!
---
Least common of all race/class combinations during original Vanilla if I remember correctly
---
Holy shit
---
Take skinning it will give you something to do while she looks around for a while
---
Get this to the top boys
---
This. R14 is one of the hardest achievements in the game.
---
I made it to r10/11 iirc by sidelining with some of the cool kids, and even that was a big grind. It only gets exponentially more time consuming after that.
---
Let’s goooooooo!
---
Feral OTing is great, especially when they are done off tanking they can make a much better swap to dps than warriors in tank gear can. New info on fury warrior tanks will change that though as you don’t need full tank gear to tank much content especially in the OT spot. 
---
Druids are better than warriors in some spots but there are some fights Druids cannot tank, but no fights warriors can’t tank and shield block makes up for a lack of gear on harder hitting bosses.  Getting plus hit as a tank Druid is rough you really gonna give a Druid BoA, and DFT? 2 misses in a row early in the fight can make holding agro tough in combination with having a super high dodge leading to being rage starved and their agro generating ability has a bigger downside than warriors. Also Druids have no major tanking cool downs which is an issue also if they are tanking they can’t use two of their best abilities. But you have guaranteed FF up at all times and a more powerful pull option with the instant cast. Horde side Druid tanks have to be in a weird group because they waste the wind fury buff but you want to give your dps the crit so do you put them with hunters if your guild even runs three hunters? Alliance is different as you get the warrior, pally, lock, hunter, Druid group is which is solid. 
---
Feral dps requires way more work for at best equal payoff to rogues and dps warriors and it goes back to the gearing issue. Are you really going to give Druids the best dps gear over rogues and warriors early on? 
---
And how many gnomer runs can you do in a lifetime.
---
it not being 2005 doesnt remove a paladins limitations. show me a paladin main tank that wasnt doing it for the lulz.
---
same
---
As others pointed out, some of this information is a bit outdated. I recommend joining us at **[the Shadow Council](https://discord.gg/zMJMh3p)** (the Classic Warlock discord) if you want to get access to all of the necessary warlock resources. 
---
I look forward to welcoming all of you new initiates personally :)
---
OP still deserves recognition for his effort, though, so thank you.
---
Blade’s Edge Mountains is the one of the most underrated zones in the entire game. The start of it isn’t super interesting as it’s just forest and a valley full of ogres to kill with quests spaced out. But after you get through that initial part the atmosphere, ambience, and music make it entirely worth it. Nothing better than crawling through long tunnels through the mountains until you reach the plateau area and see the twisting nether with the spacey music and alien ambience that’s never seen in another WoW zone ever again.
---
Everything looks amazing. Those class icon nameplates are next level!
---
That one was mine. I goofed and posted it like 5 times. Here's the working link  [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cstee8/warlock\_drain\_tanking\_cheat\_sheet/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cstee8/warlock_drain_tanking_cheat_sheet/)
---
Just play on the Oceanic server on launch if you're gonna stay in AUS long term. I don't think transfer will be available in Classic, at least for the first few years.
---
I only had three months to enjoy those sweet sweet weapons before BC released, and then when they were obsolete, I was burned out.
---
Sounds very familiar to my group of friends! We're all mostly original vanilla players, now all 20-somethings, and have recently came together to form Dark Side of Elune. Join our Discord and we can talk more :). Server invite code is: PYGHqv5
---
I’d just rip the bandaid off and go to an Australian server now
---
but you need to explore it first.. otherwise you will walk around many minutes without finding the fastest way to your next level zone.!
---
Altough.. if you bought the original game, in the case you have an explored map i think
---
Oh my god my addictometer is about to explode! send help!
---
relatable
---
Even when reaching R14, when AQ/NAXX releases, it's gear will be better than your PVP gear, so you'll have to do PVE to be competitive in PVP, as there is no such thing as resilience.
---
I just want some fresh servers after Naxx.
---
Advocate for feral lol.  Imo roll a priest, spriest is cool and you can heal/rez her.
---
Thanks !
---
I read that Zygor will be available for Classic!
---
He might just be Italian
---
That's one of the coolest pieces of warlock art, great choice!
---
There are a few that are considered bad, and a lot of elitist groups will probably decline them. But those are usually the kind of people you don't want to play with anyway. Find yourself a good guild/friends and you can really play pretty much anything as long as you take the time to be prepared, and actually show up on time for raids.
---
If you are concerned about being denied groups from those elitist players, however, you should generally avoid:
---
Retribution Paladin
---
Protection Paladin
---
Balance Druid
---
Enhancement shaman
---
and depending on how elitist, possibly also:
---
Elemental Shaman
---
Feral Druid
---
As others have said, honestly play what you want, and if you find a good group they will take you because its you, not because of what you are playing.
---
There are quite a few addons working, people were getting them set up during the beta/stress tests. https://willitclassic.com/ tries to keep up to date with what addons have been confirmed/announced for classic. You could scroll through that. As for ones worth getting, that's up to you.
---
Glad you enjoy them. Thanks
---
Dont listen to them. Her journey as a cat will be worth it 🐱
---
If you are at the point where the boss is on farm your MT will be dw fury tanking and put out more than enough threat to tank without any fear of losing agro while still having defensive cool downs for when the healers slack
---
Sounds like a great challenge
---
Tank shamans are so are off being viable. They need a full set and an ability or two more for that to happens. The idea is fun though.
---
Not every healer is equal in talent. The weak will be culled.
---

2 weeks is pretty normal
---
As much as I love the theme of fury (it's how I leveled my warrior in vanilla) it's not the most pragmatic/min-max. It's got periodic awesome interspersed with a lot of crap, whereas Arms tree progression is good enough that it's hard to decide when you're justified detouring for 5 points in Cruelty. Leveling my warrior this time, I'm planning on going for Anger Management ASAP (mostly because I want tactical mastery (I'mma shield bash ALL the casters) but keeping rage between fights plus 10 rage for every 30 seconds in combat for one point is awesome.
---
Well you can say that about tanks and DPS as well...
---
So you are saying taking a day off work in a fit of nostalgia was a bad idea and a waste of time, then? lol
---
I'm curious if the servers go live late at night the day before or morning of. Is this a release or a patch in their eyes.
---
Ur horde....
---
Underrated meme.
---
To answer your question - a lot of the Danish guilds (and ditto for most nationalities) have tried to organise in advance for classic to try and settle on a server. Originally the Scandinavian nations all settled on Shazzrah, alongside the Brits and a few others.
---
That went out of the window when the Swedes decided to roll on Gehennas instead when it opened, leaving Norweigans and Danes of both factions on Shazzrah. 
---
With the opening of Firemaw, the GMs of some of the larger guilds of both factions got together yesterday and decided to migrate, alongside the Norweigan community. The Danish community counts at the present more than 1600 members plus a lot of people who haven't declared for any of the guilds. So while it's not for ALL danes, it is a large group of people who are trying to band together.
---
Also, this is obviously only for PvP servers - The PvE players are trying to flock to Pyrewood.
---
Fortiguard? I Feel you!
---
A too horny 15 yr olds monitor?
---
Try some new experiences man, you dont need to play your exact builds from tbc to have fun in classic, if you really cant enjoy being a frost mage then just pick a new class altogether that you have no preconceived feelings towards and just start fresh.
---
As a maxed osrs player, I can safely say that the voting system is shit and should only be utilized in major updates
---
People seem to have forgotten Alterac valley, so this could be a good point to pick that up again.
---
At times, healers were as hard to find as tanks.  You will absolutely not have a problem finding a spot.
---
 &gt; they normalized damage type and movement speed in 1.9 for pet
---
so some pets used to move faster than other pets? and whats the damage normalization
---
I have never seen white powder on carrots. What the fuck xD Maybe buy normal carrots and cut them up?
---
ah yea I saw you had posted multiple times, thanks for the fix
---
Horde obviously
---
That sounds just like what my guild is looking for. We're a bunch of original vanilla players, now mostly all 20-somethings, and have recently came together to form Dark Side of Elune. Join our Discord and we can talk more :). Server invite code is: PYGHqv5
---
Oh boy, this suffering is killing me.
---
I can feel every minute passing through. I look at the  clock and I don't think "2 hours to end my shift and go home", I think "there are still X hours to Classic release".
---
End this.
---
Thanks :)
---
Barrens would be your best bet.
---
At what levels? Almost any healer can just DPS in low levels and be fine for a dungeon group. At 60? Don't think for a second it will remain at 20%
---
I wasn't in the beta, but I've leveled two Warlocks to 60 in actual Vanilla and then another to max in the stress test. VW was average at holding aggro 15 years ago and he was just as average in the stress test. Do you realise that a huge amount of the info being thrown about at the moment comes from private servers, where aggro mechanics were mostly just guesses? Where VW threat generation was greatly buffed relative to what he's capable of in the real game?
---
If I'm being negative it's because every other day someone is posting guides like this, containing fundamental flaws and based on outdated or otherwise incorrect information, and which unaware players thank the poster for because they've incorrectly assumed the poster knows what they're talking about. Not that long ago a guide hit the front page where the poster was providing macros that literally haven't worked since 2006. Why? Because he found them in a guide/s, and they were written based on private server code.
---
Also you literally call it a guide in the title of your post.
---
Balance is good, even deep Balance.  Just not the Moonkin ability specifically.  :D
---
Considering the average wow player's age in 2005 was 28 I'm not surprised there is a lot of older people playing.
---
This is why I think the argument "People don't have time to play classic because they have jobs and families now" is so dumb.
---
He is a huge nerd and he says it proudly.
---
Missed a phone call telling him he won the casting for Man of steel because he was busy MM raiding.
---
Jumped on the occasion to play Geralt in the Witcher because he is a huge fan of the game and the books.
---
ContactedChris Roberts to star in the upcoming solo campaign of Star Citizen because he played wing commander and freelancer (previous Roberts games).
---
He openly speak about gaming in general and it's really fun to read non-gamer or women comments all over his instagram post about it. Solo handly destroying the myth of the big ass gamer in his mom's basement
---
Yes, this Reddit only subsection of a poll has predicted every individual healers experience in classic.

Azlis was my very first WoW character, and Verion has been my main ever since I left Azlis behind.

I think it was for the lvl 60.

RIP in peace abbreviations.

Hoping this server will have a great late-night guild for those of us in Alaska and Hawaii...as well for those people who just like to play late.
---
Thanks
---
Pro gamer move
---
Sounds like a great thing to make a sub for.
---
nah i got it. Was just continuing the grammar corrections trend.
---
Your only rivalries are another premade group in the other side of the BG. You know that when in a cross real BG all of them come from the same server.
---
A service that is probably completely automated.
---
What do you mean?
---
There are is no auto-mod post for RP guilds.
---
Palladin, free mount and judgement armor to show off.
---
It’s already full... starting zones are gonna be a zoo.
---
”Defias Pillager”
---
Oh yeah, I know you. Been killed damn countless times by those OP bastards.
---
You mean the Defias guild right?
---
fair enough I was not trying to give bad info, I was just getting info from guides that I thought would be handy to have, I have only played to 15 in the stress test and before posting this I had no reason to not believe any of this which came from new guides on websites about classic wow, and I am taking everyone's advise. I realize your right I did call it a guide, I apologize, for that. I thought that condensing info from multiple guides to a cheat sheet would be useful to some people. I have learned a lot tonight just from everyone pointing me in the right direction for what may be a better way. I really do appreciate everyone's input. So many people feel the same as you and I would delete this but I also think the discussion in the thread has helped me and will help others. I never said I have any personal experience with any of it other than the stress test and hope I did not lead anyone down a difficult path, I will now change my main to a mage and never bother another warlock again ....:)
---
Hi from white bear lake
---
This was my favorite to.
---
It is until you get to crit cap.
---
Sell is the right word
---
omg the flashbacks.
---
Nobody knows how populated servers will be.
---
No one has a crystal ball.
---
The best Blizzard can do it mitigate and future proof their strategy as best as they can.
---
For me it's a blessing in disguise. When I finally have time to play the game will have been out for 18 hours, so queues will hopefully be shorter by then.
---
Might as well roll healer then if you like the playstyle, because the other parts of my write up specify that you rarely want to be on your own out in the world anyways. Both a warrior and a healer are just food on their own out in the world. Better team up for a great experience.
---
Pick disc or holy, resto shaman or holy paladin and you will find a raid group as well as PvP to your hearts content. The last pserver I played on among the top 10 was a holy paladin who went out in the to wreck hordes of... horde.
---
You misspelled Azzinoth, you know, like those blades?
---
Could you please link the guide.
---
haha They still sell gametime cards :O ?
---
What's the best way to go about reserving a name on this realm? Log in way before and wait for the realm list, or log in as soon as the clock ticks over?
---
Last minute extistensial crisis has me rolling my old main.
---
I'm on paternal leave with my 9 month old son until November. Luckily he sleeps a couple hours during the day. Any other tips on baby entertainment while playing wow? He usually doesnt like to sit still.
---
Ah, the smell of burning retinas as you alt-tab over to that blinding white mess at 2 am. Brings back memories...
---
Agreed, but I think what he was trying to say was the the overall player count curve is what blizz will be looking at to see how soon people drop off.
---
He's a gamer. Huge Witcher fan as well, that'a why he got the role as Geralt.
---
Nobody wants to play with rpers
---
Appears to be a strange aoe mage spec.
---
"EUGHHHHHH!"
---
What is this TBC abomintion doing there?
---
I feel the same way I can just talk about this game endlessly. That first conversation you have with someone when you find out they play WoW is the greatest.. can go on for hours.
---
that's a classic, WoW!
---
You said "if the servers are full just from pre-launch" - they're NOT full just from pre-launch.  Blizzard is just *projecting* they'll be full, based on an assumption about what % of the folks who reserved names will be online at a given time, in addition to their projection about the number of people who have yet to create characters (and a similar assumption there).  Blizzard could be assuming that only 5% of the people who will play classic have reserved names so far, for all we know, thereby ensuring a smooth launch.
---
All of this being said, yeah, the servers are probably gonna be unstable and overloaded and there's probably gonna be queues on nearly every server.
---
163 hours is still less than 200.
---
I’d say Tauren Paladin xD
---
You have no idea how refreshing it is to see a reasonable take on Blizzard’s likely data gathering. 
---
It seems like every thread is filled with people whose only argument is that one guy said “You think you do, but you don’t” and therefore Blizzard is forever incapable of making an informed decision on anything. 
---
I just wish there was more cautious optimism and less preemptive pessimism in this sub, although with launch getting closer and closer it does seem that the overall sentiment is shifting from pessimism to excitement.
---
Is athene going to play?
---
UGROSH. ORC WARRIOR WITH DEEPTHUNDER
---
Most of my WoW time was spent in that expansion. :P To each their own!
---
I didn't mean to make it sound like I didn't have experience in the original game.  I probably started in 2006 and didn't stop until well after WotLK.  Played a Forsaken Mage as my main for the LONGEST time, eventually tried a Rogue and Priest, but could never get interested in tanking with the options I had available.  Mage was a raider somewhat.  Never got beyond BWL.  As far as I know, I was the first character on my server with a Hawkstrider.  I farmed the Hell out of Runecloth in my spare time to donate for Exalted with Silvermoon as soon as the first expansion dropped.  It was the first thing I did.  Male Forsaken Mage riding a giant pink chicken around Burning Crusade.  Absolutely loved it.
---
Once Paladins became available on my side of the conflict, I ended up main tanking for my slightly-above-casual-raiding-guild and absolutely loved it.  I tried warrior and druid more times than I can remember, but never could get interested in it.  I've also tried Alliance multiple times, and just can't make myself do it.
---
So it's not so much that I don't enjoy classic.  I just know the limitations that it had (which are fine), but I DO miss the changes that came out in early expansions.  Namely, specifically, Paladins for Horde and more Arcane focus for mages (once I went full Arcane I never went back).  I wasn't trying to rag on classic, or whine that I wouldn't see those things available in it.  Just that certain things that came later were definitely for the better (mostly just offensive spells like Arcane Blast or all the original classes available to both sides).
---
honestly i dont think it will be completely chaotic in the starting Zone. I played on the stresstest and the dynamic respawns were so frequent, mobs did spawn near instantly upon looting. Then i logged out and back in shortly after and found myself in a relative empty layer. 
---
tl;dr : i doubt you would be stuck in the first zone for hours
---
Still with the less than 3.5 weapon speed use SoR myth, which was the most glaring error on your first version.
---
It will never be as great because of reporting and speech policing nowadays.
---
I really hope they never add achievements to classic.
---
Came here looking for this. Sure you can heal a 5-man dungeon, but if someone dies, they're most likely running back and you gotta go fetch him at the entrance (or burn your long cd battle rez) since mobs respawning is a thing in the longer, slower dungeons (deadmines anyone? yeah...)
---
I only see warrior and shaman in this album :O
---
You are just plain wrong. For example doing the nelf starter quests gives 100rep each, while on pservers they awarded 300-350
---
Outstanding move.
---
Toronto native here got me and 28 other friends making a guild on Staglagg with Toronto natives looking to push for 60 raid end game, got veterans and new players alike if you’d like to join our guild were friendly and love a good laugh. 
---
battle tag is - Kathetara#1666 
---
add me or send me a pm if other Ontario natives are interested :)
---
I'm doing exactly the same
---
this is all you can really say to a question so dumb...
---
Meanwhile in rp land:
---
im horrified by the severe lack of depth perception. kudos
---
[Fun machinima on that](https://youtu.be/LDoNp_hTB1M)
---
First, the amount of people polled is tiny compared to the actual amount of people that will be playing. The actual numbers of how many people will be playing each role might be vastly different. Second, I am willing to bet that there are a lot of people that want to have a easy time finding a group and see healing as the easier role compared to tanking. But once the majority of these players realize what it takes to level up to 60, they are going to want to go dps for an easier time, especially if they are playing solo. Also realize a lot of players want to WANT to heal, but dont actually want to heal. Same goes for tanking. There is a reason they are the least played roles. If you want more accurate numbers, look at some of the big private server numbers or numbers from vanilla. Yes, that data might be skewed a little as well for whatever reason, but at least those numbers come from people actually playing the game, not from people who are still waiting and planning.
---
Yeah, they claimed to be officially speaking for all Scandinavians, but both Denmark and Norway had decided to stay. This move is official for the Danes and Norwegians.
---
Sir, could you please reinstall World of Warcraft?!
---
BY THE LIGHT OF ELUUUNE *POOF*
---
I think people whining about it have no clue.
---
You got 2 options; 1 overpopulated now &amp; nicely populated for years when the noobs stop playing.
---
Or 2 nicely populated now; dead later.
---
Have your pick. Im behind blizzard on choosing the 2nd
---
"it's just nostalgia"
---
Always needs warr tanks, then priest and mages. That's the core.
---
Wait what? Why is there so many people that want to destroy and steal an ad that advertises our game? Im amazed how many selfish people i see here.
---
Loot Council. All of my large scale raiding was done on Loot Council, and frankly I prefer it.
---
There's plenty of ways to make it work better than fine, but it relies a lot on trust obviously. This can be created with transparency, like having rotating non-officers picked by RNG participate on a set schedule, posting the logs of the /o channel, or both.
---
We spoke on the behalf of every guild who decided to join our project. That includes guilds from any of the nordic nations. You can't blame us that the norwegians wanted to run their own show and not include the rest of the nordic nations(Which is fine). 
---
We however shared our plans with them all the way to the final server choice. 
---
We also shared the list of guilds that decided to follow our project and invited any guild leaders of nordic guilds to be part of the discussion, so if you didnt join then you can only blame yourself.
---
he means skipping the higher ranks of res.
---
I think so too, but why not just play with the English client then? It's not like you have to join an English realm to accomplish that. Also, from my friends who actually use the German client, I've heard that the localization for classic will be a bit different than in retail. No more "Das Wegekreuz" (holding back vomit right now).
---
I just found out today another coworker is trying to take off next week as well... Not sure who will actually get it off now.
---
Sad
---
TBC content in classic WoW sub
---
WeirdChamp
---
unless it’s fresh servers and you have a choice that would kill the game. need the option to not have to go down the same shit progression of the game all over again. that’s the point of classic, we don’t want any of the bullshit that came after it.
---
Who says?
---
https://discord.gg/8mrt6DE
---
It really doesn't help that much as you sacrifice dmg to jduge the seal. Normally you are better off stunning the fleeing mob or positioning it correctly, so it doesn't run into friends.
---
I mean wallpaper yeah and all.. but why?
---
It's not accurate. If you're not PvPing hamstring is pointless. If you're going to buy revenge then you need to buy max level revenge because it's only useful as a threat skill.
---
Sunder is absolutely bae. I dunno why the person above you said otherwise. It's not only high threat, it improves all physical damage.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bif380/a_warriors_guide_to_threat_aggro_and_tanking/
---
No. They will be maining druids, paladins, priests and shamans. I'd be willing to bet that a large portion of them believe that the other specs are only shunned by elitist guilds.
---
Very good. I accept this.
---
ZOMBIE
---
I don’t need a cause I just can
---
B I T C H
---
love the warlock during vanilla as pve &amp; battlegrounds. 
---
- succubus seduction for crowd control
---
- summon doom lord for fun 
---
- diremaul quest for unique mount
---
- solo with pets (no need to level pets, no food, no petting care needed)
---
- soulstone (vs reincarnation)
---
- pet tanking
---
- summons
---
as 1vs1, it's mostly painful experience, especially vs rogues. avoid them at all cost.
---
Resto shaman - you could easily join groups as heals. heals are always welcome on any guilds, dungeons and raids.
---
my 2cents - main in shaman and be active in guilds. in classic, guilds will be great again. Enjoy soloing as alt - warlocks. Warlock as money making/exploring/pve content. Shaman for serious dungeons/raiding groups.
---
It is de forest
---
I'd guess he's referring to the success of Trump
---
Dwarf hunter propaganda when they lack bis gun
---
I've seen a few people doing infographics and debating various points about the best builds for some classes, so I thought I'd write up a full brief of what I consider to be the most optimal builds for any given Warrior role, PvP, tanking, DPS, hybrid, etc.
---
[I've also included the individual builds as images in an Imgur if that's easier for you to read](https://imgur.com/a/CFWgEmn)
---
The question in the census was about a role, not the class.
---
same here, but after the stresstest impression i think it would be totaly playable tho. The reason why 2nd week is still better, is because you can gauge the server demand and decide late which one you roll, in case your friends didnt decide and level first
---
hahaha
---
Windfury is still stupid strong even post AP and self-proc nerf era. As seen by the continual nerfs and eventual removal in the coming expacs. It's synergy with other talents and procs is not to be underestimated.
---
Yikesssss

try and download it from there, its 142mb
---
Fck. I had tuesday off and now half of it is wasted. Servers open 1pm in finland.
---
Midnight lauch would have been nice.
---
So? Better now than launch day.
---
In addition why only list weapon dps? Attack speed matters,  along with stats and possible procs.
---
From a horde perspective too, this is one of my favorite zones. Love the Shadra quest line, slime cave with ghost mushrooms, even Jintha'alor for how insanely hard that place was.
---
try and download it from there, its 142mb you can print it at whatever size you want

try and download it from there, its 142mb here you go pal

Yeah me, was there on stress test and shazz name reservation along with 50+ guildies.
---
Unless you stream it! That's my plan ;)
---
I was logged into the Eonar server for about 15 hours a day from rank 8-11 and then THREE MONTHS of 20-22 hour days from ranks 11-14. I ate pizza pockets and Mountain Dew, and my team was like my family.  Nehelenia, Ahota, Vilrix, Sporky, to make a few. These were my brothers. 
---
I first thought to run for warlord around rank 11, but there was an A team on Eonar, but they were an older group of gamers and they were not keen on letting some 18 year old kid on their team. Needless to say, I started what became the B team comprised of the leftovers like me that were discarded from the A team. I also had friends from leveling and guild ages join now and then. Soon, we were in battlegrounds so often that the A team just kind of gave up. I remember there being some complaining that these kids who didn’t have jobs had an upper hand, and they were right, but my team wasn’t all k S, we were an eclectic mix of old and young and mostly undergeared, although I admit, towards the end of my run while rank 13 I was making it a habit of being very selective who I let in. And for good reason. 
---
My team would crush most any pick up group, and we often beat the alliance teams that were grinding honor like we were. Against these groups there was sort of a gentleman’s agreement not to turtle, as there was no time limit, and gaining honor was based on the number of games completed, not the length of the game. Long games mean less honor, especially with honor decay. So, some games would run a long time and it was annoying, but mostly it was smooth sailing.
---
There was exception.
---
I started my stint about rank 11 around 6 months from BC launch. By that time there were many guilds on my server fully geared in tier 2. And when they got bored and tired of raiding they would come play with us. And it was never fun for us. You see, most people grinding honor were wearing the blue set that completes at rank 11, which is vastly inferior to a set of tier 2. I would even wager that it completely negates skill in most matchups. Even the Warlord set of epics is not really equal to the performance of tier 2, specifically for healers and tanks, but even for DPS. 
---
Anyway, not that this would have mattered if they were just logging on to steamroll us and move in with their lives... but that was not always their goal. No... often, they would grab the flag and graveyard camp, which they could do indefinitely because there was no amount of skill will save a team of people half geared in tier .5 against a fully raid geared squad.  So the solution was to scout the matchup when these teams would appear. It was typically bad for morale on days they would play, and towards the end of vanilla they were appearing more often as time went on and raiding seemed moot. 
---
All of this said, I lived in my guild leader at his apartment at the time, for 3 months from rank 11-14, and I don’t think I cooked a single meal the whole time. I just heated up pizza pockets and guzzled Mountain Dew. I hardly left the apartment for 3 months and when I completed my mission I’m sure my guild leader was happy to have me off his couch when I moved on.
---
I got to enjoy the rank 14 daggers and swords (but mostly the daggers) for about 3 months, mostly retired and burned out from BGs and instead stealthing around stormwind with my best friends Ahota and Nehelenia. I remover vividly one day, although I can’t recall which one, where I was sitting there listening to everyone on ventrilo (sometimes it was teamspeak), and thinking “man this is going to last forever, I’m going to play this game my whole life, even when I’m 80”. 
---
I was one of the first in line for BC release and I rolled a blood elf paladin. I leveled it to 58 and was so burned out on pve I thought often I would quit the game, but I couldn’t do it. Something something sunken cost fallacy. I only ever played for the pvp (although I rolled on a pve server), and I wasn’t really enjoying myself. I then had a bright idea that I would hire someone to level my account and I was banned. I sent an email to blizzard thanking them for releasing me from the thing I could not leave myself. 
---
I have since then had a pretty good life away from world of Warcraft and I’m ultimately happy things worked out the way they did. This time I’m rolling a Druid and running flags for 20-22 hours a day, but I will probably be eating more broccoli and kale. 
---
Here we go again.
---
How does it proc off mobs without a sit macro? I thought mobs dont crit you, just crushing. Which only occurs when they're +3 levels on you
---
The whole rhetoric about hunters not scaling is absolute garbage. Who fucking cares. You are a hunter, not a raid spot.
---
This. This is what I am gonna do
---
Just mage and warlock left now!
---
Pretty bad considering listening to the community is one of the reasons retail became so casual.
---
80% horde 20% alliance will never happen on PvP servers.
---
1. Theres not enough servers in the first place
---
2. No one wants to have 3 hour BG queues and no one to kill in wPvP
---
Regardless of what realm you choose, there will be people speaking all languages, and the factions will be generally balanced
---
This is going to be my first launch not at zero hour. Going to sleep first, wake up at 7am get going (rather than the 11pm launch). Figure I will be less tired and most people will have gone to sleep at that point.
---
Plus most "healer" classes won't actually want to heal. The same issue with warriors, most will want to tank but not all
---
You forgot the part where you use paypal to get someone to follow and heal you.
---
This would make me quit in a heartbeat as well, and it is definitely coming - the real question is if the community can hold them off and for how long. 
---
The last time they added a cash shop they attached charity to it iirc. It’s so malicious. If you complained against having it, the frankly moronic blizz drones who can’t think with 2 brain cells, would shout you down going “You don’t like charity bro?!? It’s just cosmetic dude it’s for Africa!!”. Make no mistake either, this was entirely intentional as well.

The most exciting thing about Classic isn’t that it’s a genuinely good game, nor the nostalgia, not even the many friends I’ll be reunited and playing with. The most exciting thing about Classic is that it’s a game from a time before MTX culture, skins and cosmetics included, started fucking with game design and gameplay integrity. The moment we lose that fight I am picking up irl fishing.

try and download it from there, its 142mb here you go :) i printed it on matte paper and it looks pretty good, i had it in a frame with non reflective glass, but it made the picture blurry from the angle that i would be looking at it from (underneath)

As a healer who got to 60 on a pserver recently, whilst it wasn't a struggle, It certainly wasn't the instant walk into a dungeon group id hoped it was. I pvped so that was easy, but pve there were healers quite often. Still good to roll a healer though as it your any good people remember you and message you before going out to lfg.
---
Remember Remember the 5th of december patch plot and treason.
---
What was the exact wording? Because if it's just maining healer classes, that's pointless, since shadow priests and elem/enh shamans are also in there. And even if it's explicitly by role rather than class, depending on the wording of the question, people who feel they can fill a healer spot in 5 man without specializing as one all the way might have put themselves down as one despite being perfectly content to stay a dps if possible.
---
Finally someone intelligent.
---
It’s not reliable
---
Thanks for that! I wasn't aware of that. It looks clear now that I look at it, but as a lazy non-native speaker, I copy a lot of things from just reading and listening and don't check if it's actually correct.
---
PvP

Warlocks have more abilities than Shaman, priest has almost as many.

rank 14 should be 2000
---
Most rewarding feeling. Either it drops quick and you’ve a giant smirk, or you end up having to work hard for it and when it drops it feels like victory. Most times it’s a reasonable medium imo tho
---
Of course. I am just messing with you ! :) Nice work overall, I am jealous, really!

Hey this is actually some relevant info, thanks :)

Same here. Love the lore and SFK is my favorite instance. Sons of Arugal were the OG Fel Reavers.
---
I actually would broadly agree with you. Often I feel peoples races reflect the kind of players they are. Personally I don't treat them any differently but there are obvious tendencies.
---
rend sucks and when you parry you get a free auto attack.
---
Quite a lot more people play healers these days
---
It was about the role, not about the class.
---
Its so cute :D very nice work &lt;3
---
The level of the art in these is pretty much crazy good
---
pvp servers tend to skew horde, while pve (and rp) servers tend to skew alliance. Because of this I am going RP-PVP which according to the polls is very close to 50/50. Also helps that an RP-PVP server probably has a much better community than a pure PVP server. Just go look at each realm's discord, subreddit, any forum threads, and you'll see what I mean. Shazzrah players are a bunch of spergs.
---
i remember replying to you, but it says that i cannot find the replied comment
---
How do you do that?!

He's balding, but I guess that's literally his only physical flaw. He was even lucky enough to born into a very rich family; I'd gladly go bald if it meant switching places with him lol.

Just relax, this is a break your mind needed for a very long time, otherwise you will just simply end up like this - https://images.app.goo.gl/bDiJqH59UuTe9b6WA

From a healer PoV? Most people reveal themselves in the 5 minutes of a dungeon.
---
The warlock I'd be worried if he had anything other than a succ out. Nooblocks tend to fear n' forget until the mob they feared brings back 6 friends.
---
Hunter depends if he does hunter things. Not turning off pet taunt? Gonna be a hard dungeon.
---
Mage thinks its a carry run and tries to AoE and get mad at me when they inevitably get smashed. Classic isn't really "hard" but your character isn't God mode.
---
I know for ubrs it was like 20g
---
By lvl 10 in retail you are a complete class. You’ll never need anyone’s help or teachings to do your levelling, nor need any gear thanks to heirlooms.
---
Honestly, have giving it much thought, no
---
I planned on playing both Golemagg and Shazzrah. Then the new PvP realm came and I moved from Shazzrah to Gehenas. I can't move from Golemagg, since my Ally guild is there. So I'll be Horde on Gehenas with possibly no queues. Since the other two realms are full.

Inusually hate these kinds of videos but this was pretty funny

I wish I could find my one real friend from Vanilla, but it's been so long- his name was Tehwin but it got reported and changed and I can't remember what he changed it to. This was on Dalaran Horde if by any small chance you know who he is. Was an amazing, helpful person!
---
I spent a lot of time there farming the blue dragonkin for recipes, it really is an underrated zone.

This is literally me rn. working 6 days this week and the Monday right before launch.

I think that was the blackfish actually but a comforting sentiment nonetheless

Good server ran by Legends.
---
Of course you can, never did I say you couldn't.
---
But acting on impulses you don't understand seems like a cloudy way to live, but that might just be me.
---
You have to install Classic to log in and get your name tho, you need quite some interest to do that. The game has massive interest behind it, enough to make it profitable for Blizz
---
Oh shit? I just realised looking at first person, since the game used the current engine there will be actioncam
---
?
---
I would just like to point out they can main-tank roughly 98% of vanilla content with relative ease. There are deep dives on the subject. Tips and Skarm did a video together focusing on this subject specifically and dispelled almost all of the misinformation and misunderstandings about bear tanks. 
---
tl;dr? They are not just viable off-tanks, but completely viable main-tanks for the vast majority of classic content. 
---
I really just want to stop the flow of misguided regurgitation of what everyone wrongly thought 15 years ago. I was a feral who was forced to respec if I wanted into raids back in vanilla. People keep repeating false information as fact and it's going to impact how many people get to enjoy feral this time around. Please understand I'm not attacking you, I'm just a vanilla druid who is tired of correcting this.
---
Same for me I am afraid of this issue as well But what makes me worry more is when the hype will start fading and some people will be "bored" ( because they are filthy casuals) they stop playing and what if my server ends up being low population with so little people on it the I won't be able do to enjoy the game .
---
Although, to play devil's advocate, 22 damage extra on each hit multiplied by the hundreds - if not thousands - of mobs you kill during those levels could add up to be pretty significant time saving.  I still don't think it's worth it over imp hamstring but it's interesting.
---
The fact that Istanbul is on the map made me really happy dunno why.

Why would you want to do this to *your own team*?

Seems a good way to lose the battleground

Suppose I am, but I don't get the doomsday feel of these posts implying every single Norwegian person should join them in order to have fun. It's not like there won't still be hundreds or thousands of them spread over all the other servers.

This is just amazing XD it's almost like if they (actors) are normal people.
---
oh my mistake.  i love wow radio tho, can't wait
---
I'd totally roll on Beaten Corpse realm!
---
Perhaps OP managed to make a Char with a hard to grab name. Then went on to make it again on other realms but it kept saying unavailable. Might lead one to believe that might be the case. Gotta look at it from all perspectives :p
---
I used DPSMate  
---
Don't know if it will work in classic, but if it does, I'm totally going for that one.  
---
As for Hunter pets, in DPSMate you can choose if Pet damage merges with the Hunter/Warlock or if they are seperate.  
---
If the damages are nerfed, you can still hover over the Hunter (for example) and see both Hunter damage and Pet damage, and what moves did the most damage (top 3)
---
I do agree that a name has a big influence on how your character is being perceived as well. I'd find it quite funny to get stabbed in STV by a dwarf rogue named Donut. More so than being stabbed by a human Rogue called Assassinmeister.
---
Yeah I really don't see why anyone would worry about ANY of the pre-launch realms in terms of long-term active players.  a "Full" realm back in Vanilla was like 3 - 3.5k.  I don't see any of these realms getting lower than that for years.
---
This seems nice, no more guesswork. GG.
---
 RemindMe! 7 days
---
That’s totally cool, man. You can RP a brainless orc if you want to! That sounds like a fun character actually.
---
Auctioneer was existing in classic. Is it that different and more powerful?
---
Terrible idea. This is not what we have been asking for for a decade.
---
The mods locked the thread about Henry Cavill so this guy took the convo to a completely unrelated comment by the person he was arguing with.
---
Well if I remember the census data correct about 50% of the playerbase does not have a guild atm and coordinating with 2/3 friends is not that hard.
---
mate, Ragnaros!? FUCKING BLACKWING!?
---
"Damn we couldn't get him, see if John C Reilly is available"
---
" Blizzard have stats that we don't " - I am already in love with that sentence, lmao...... Literally everyone is using it nowadays. Releasing 2 PvP servers in first wave was a big mistake by Blizzard. People now have their names there and they won´t switch that easily to "new" realms. We need at least 8-10 PvP servers minimum!
---
Cata added Trolls and Worgen druids. Until then it was strictly Nelf/cow.
---
I'm wondering this as well.  On the private servers I played on it worked even when people had the buff, but as we know private servers aren't accurate.
---
Speak for yourself, I love achievement hunting. Adds a tonne more stuff to do
---
Some delay between the two emotes could be nice:
---
`/e rolls a pair of worn bone dice...`
---
`/run C_Timer.After(2, function() SendChatMessage("rolls a "..random(1,6).." and a "..random(1,6)..".", "emote") end)`
---
Also please for the love of god just use the result of random() directly, or use `string.format`. Idk if that's possible in whatever version of lua 1.12 clients run but it is possible in the retail client.
---
The story made no sens tho.. I'm still not sure why we went to Outland and wtf the blood elves were doing there

Step 1. Remove players

Step 2. Remove layers.

Ehh as someone who’s done both beta and psrvs I’m not following. The mana rejuv is slower on classic or ? I think it’s a really underrated talent by people making the more popular guides. Spamming a drainsoul macro well times on every mob done effectively means you never have to lifetap to a situation where you dip below 50%. Leveling uptime is key and is tapping means not dotting. This helps if you’re speed leveling and are in a drought of spirit drops and are surviving off quests which can totally happen. This talent allows you to kinda soften the blow of no spirit if you gotta go with Stam and int instead. 
---
I also am not fully sold on Succy being the only demon you need which I see a lot in those guides. VW threat handling does indeed fall off into your early 30s but the way their taunt works isn’t a hard taunt but rather a static amount and increasing that by 10% along with the bubble increase give you a solid way to grab 3 mobs to dot up and wand with a good defensive cd to bail if you need to in sac. Full dots on 2 mobs being taken on by your void and fearing dotting another if you have room feels good
---
Not saying other people are wrong but it’s important to find out why you don’t like something and don’t blindly follow a guide , and I say that because those talents are pretty exceptional components to efficient leveling if you get down how vw and your threat works. 
---
Succy is obv invaluable when you need a charm to safely 1v2 where you can
---
Swolemagg
---
I'm with you. I went cruelty first in Vanilla, but this time I'm rushing Anger Management. Tactical Mastery is too good a quality of life improvement. Plus if you start factoring in deep wounds/impale in the comparison, then you're trying to predict the overkill/unused portions of rend, deep wounds, and critical hits. And considering  improved charge and improved overpower are fair game too, plus improved rend, and parry...any comparison between an Arms talent and Cruelty while leveling isn't just a straight comparison, it's also comparing how much longer it will take to get all the other Arms talents. I probably won't take Cruelty until after Sweeping Strikes, with the plan to respec at 40 for Mortal Strike. I could see Cruelty being slightly better in the math before Sweeping strikes, but it's so close it's not worth worrying over.
---
Italians don't believe in internet ?

[https://discord.gg/DCkRk9](https://discord.gg/DCkRk9)

I really hope not. Mounts used to have a value back in classic, because there weren't thousands of different ones you really felt awesome if you got a special one. I remember delivering runecloth for weeks to get a tigermount for my gnome. Nowadays people won't notice you have a special mount because everyone has a hundred special mounts. It's the same thing as with epics, everyone has a ton of them so they're not special anymore. Whoever thought getting epics from quest rewards was a good idea I have no idea.
---
Blizzard are only adding servers when they deem it to be absolutely necessary. I'm sure they are worrying a lot more about longevity than you, and have a lot of data to make their decisions. Therefore any realm you choose now should have a stable population down the line. The game isn't even out yet and tens of thousands of characters have been created. Most people reserving names early are the type that know what the game is and will continue playing it. The tourists come later.
---
And that NPC's name? Albert Einstein.
---
Me not that kind of warrior
---
&gt;monitor
---
But I have to ask, why are the monitors literally 1cm above the table? Seems weird or is it just the angle?
---
yes, the costs did increase depending on how frequently you respec. I think it begins with 10s and it ends with 50g.
---
Wait what? Don't you lose rep from killing them on retail? I think you have to do a weird strat in order to get both exalted, I'll have to look it up again.
---
The people who wanna PvP as druid are people who enjoy that you need 9 different strategies to beat each class 1v1. It's quite the skill gap. Also if you plan on being feral DPS you need to farm Crowd Pummelers to stay competitive.
---
If your main priority is to be competitive at T3 then warrior is the way to go.

Sorry I was always more of a Pokemon than a Beyblade guy, so no.

Honestly I agree with imp drain and vw , don’t blindly follow guides that say otherwise  that focus on Succy damage . Utility of sac is great where mobs are densely spawned.
---
I would prefer a classic server wipe and let us start fresh again, similar to Diablo's seasons system, than expansions. Im finally getting my favorite game at my favorite time period. I dont want to lose that just because "theres no new content"

I was adamant on playing a mage since I finally decided 2 Weeks ago. But today I woke up and wanted to be a Shaman. Will this nightmare never end?
---
I WANT NEW CLASSIC CONTENT BLIZZARD PLSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS  
---
Though, we would have to find a way to make them sign a "Classic Constitution" or follow some sort of rules when designing Classic++ content.  Like, no flying mounts, no egregious gear upgrades that make other gear useless(creating an endless power grind, end game should be about finding what gear fits your build/playstyle), no transmog or other "realness" reducing things, etc.  Maybe increase level cap to 70 to compensate for TBC fans and allowing more builds.  Give us more items with "different" stats/effects(world drops or new dungeons), new enchants(?), new crafting stuff, new EARNABLE mounts (no cash shop).  
---
Would be cool if the community could come up with a list of stuff we would want IF they did classic++
---
I have already a good bunch of people from old guilds, my irl friends and so on to play with. I just want to play with them. The game is not even out yet - I don't really worry about this. Are there queues? Good - more people that are playing. Are there more people on the opposite faction? Good - more people to gank / not taking my quests (at least in the beginning). Blizzard underestimated the amount of players in classic? Good - free game time and more servers incoming. 
---
Just be happy classic is out in fucking 6 days! 6 MF'ing days!
---
Going home boys, to Kryp.... Azeroth!
---
"The Most Hated Man in Azeroth... For Some Time"

Fortunately we can make que have the same meaning as queue if we use it enough, and then no one will have to type those superflous extra letters anymore. Using "que" is doing future English users a service.
---
Can't join the queue if the queue is full.
---
On private server, or actually on official back in the day ?
---
Joana's the WR holder (and playing Hunter) and it takes him 24-25h to reach 30

Surely a phase-shifted imp is better than succubus in most dungeon situations?
---
that might work on the US servers :D
---
In this case. Pretty much spot on the money. (No pun intended) Well done for recognizing that.
---
Really cool.
---
I bet money is relatively high on her list
---
We talking Mekgineers or the TV show competition one
---
Alot of people say they will play healers. Like alot of people say they want to lose weight on New Years Resolutions.
---
This is painfully accurate.
---
Lmao that triggerred me to the moon. I would punch your face irl for this picture. I am literally mad rn.
---
Stop posting things that have already been posted. Thanks
---
You're the chosen one, aswell as 3 million other people...
---
That depends on party size and enemy count
---
As did thousands of other players. It was group effort not your character who defeated them.
---
Improved Overpower is (roughly) a 70% damage boost on a 5% chance on hit, which converts to 1.75% DPS per point. That's very good, but significantly below Enrage (up to 5% per point if you abuse batch-casting with a /sit macro). 
---
The first respec is 1g, that should not be any issue at 40.
---
If Blizzard fixes the /sit Enrage, then Arms is probably competitive from level 10 onwards.
---
for real. most of my friends that are resubbing are waiting until the day before or launch day. I'm sure tons of people are waiting.
---
its just for the picture, they are on extendable arms, you can raise them. i was trying to hide a couple of wires behind the monitor (keyboard and mouse wire)
---
And when the new server will open, you will go to the new one as well? It's like a reddit trend, that some "community" is going from one server to another, when the new one opens.
---
Nah, Blizzard's official merch is uninspired and low quality. Look at places like j!nx for some decent WoW stuff. I got a real nice quality Horde zip up hoodie from them a few months ago.
---
They were used by leveling characters, exactly like 55-60 zones were used by leveling characters.
---
There was little to no reason for any lvl 60 char to go to places different than: Winterspring, Silithus, Un'Goro, Plaguelands, Feralas, Searing Gorge, Burning Steppes, Blasted Lands. And some of them only to access a dungeon in it.
---
Post it 3 times = 3 times the karma
---
Humongous if correct
---
They’re trying to spread the launch population with a mild white lie deception.  
---
That’s my opinion at least.
---
Really like the idea of classic + even if its just BC and WOtLK scaled to classic design, no dung finder, no flying(atleast on main continents) maybe resillence but deffinetly keep the vanilla pvp system. Keep everything level 60 with minimal power creep, preserve talent tree functionality even if altering the talents themselves. Instead of using a higher level cap to progress to content use rep/questing to unlock atunements. AS far as the difficulties.. I kind of see a reason for having them but I think it was used an excuse to drag out contnent and make it much blander/easier. I distinctly remember being geared enough by cata(without doing raids) to just ignore many dungeon mechanics at normal difficulty. 
---
PS. Do not think anything related to the word "DAILY" is remotely a good idea.
---
They don't care about subs, they're making money on micro-transaction like anyone else. Classic is just there to say « look we're not a completely disincarnate machine yet ». It's PR. The opportunity cost of messing with Classic would outweigh any financial gains they make on it.
---
Absolutely love it, gonna use them all &lt;3
---
I am sad to say that I think he passed away (another guy we used to play with told me a while back). He was joy to play with, and I hope we'll meet again.
---
It's more of the stigma that you don't socialise as much in a video game as going out with a group of RL buds, don't think it's strictly a money thing.
---
Survival can actually be the best hunter spec depending on how much agility you can stack.
---
You still have to be there for these because you can't afford to miss them when they pass
---
Iam about to open the car door.

Well, in case you're interested, it is a long video but you might skim it.

---
I was feral in vanilla, I was in a pretty cool guild that let me attempt it from time to time. Are we better than warriors? Rarely. Are we viable almost everywhere? From firsthand experience in vanilla, not pservers, I know we are. 
---
As for the video, it's just Tips asking the questions, Skarm gives all the information and he's adamant that bears are excellent, at the very least every raid should have one as off-tank.
---
Self described brutally honest people usually just say something kind of stupid or so obvious everyone knew it didn't need to be said, but in an assholish way.
---
There's still nothing you're going to get that's going to give you more than you'll find in Arms though. There's nothing of any significant value you can pick up in either Prot or Fury. You can't get more survival, and ultimately more threat is more threat.
---
Icyveins is good check them out.

---
As much as I completely agree, they stated multiple times that the original AV was a spaghetti mess of code, held together by good will and prayers. Getting it back would most likely involve completely rewriting the entire code for it, which is out of scope for Classic.
---
Don't insist on staying in the same zone, until you're "done" with it, despite quests being red. Alternate them. For example, do lower level quests in Loch Modan, Auberdine, Westfall. Keep higher level ones for later. That way, you will have less quests grey out, botching your xp gain, and will be able to comfily level without grinding out levels for no reason. I'm surprised I even need to say this, but playing on private servers a year and more back, It's surprising how many people I've seen struggling doing quests, being underleveled for them, while the mobs are green for me.
---
Valley of trials &gt; Orgrimmar &gt; take zeppelin to thunder bluff
---
Well as I said I don't want to limit myself since I can speak with like 98 % of the people on the server anyway. I'd rather hang out with a big international crowd then a small national one. 
---
Also I don't know why but I feel weird talking Swedish to random people online.
---
One time my guild brought our most famous gold farmer on server, Wolfking, the female Tauren warrior, to MC.
---
From what I remember they rolled on everything but I’m pretty sure we gave them an Earthshaker.
---
Most people are leaving Shazzrah now.
---
The new place "to be" is now Gehennas and Firemaw!
---
You can also get around the 255 character limitation by writing it in a sane way:
---
`/run SendChatMessage("rolls a "..random(1,6)..", a "..random(1,6)..", and a "..random(1,6)..".", "emote")`
---
If you vote for that, I'll vote for queueue.
---
Ditto
---
Depends on a case by case. Undergeared? I'd rather have a seduce. Overgeared? Burn it down.
---
I don't care about your feelings in a game. You should visit a psychiatrist if you get upset about being killed in a game.
---
And btw. this is exactly what I meant. Comments like yours, crying and complaining!
---
Classic+ is the best option, easily.  I know people "loved" TBC, but vanilla is special.  TBC introduced a lot of stuff that made the game eventually bad.  Flying mounts are a big one.  Arena, while they "helped" the mainstream of the game and were interesting for a few seasons, they eventually helped lessen the amount of world PvP and "world feel" that vanilla had.  
---
  Vanilla with more overall content, more mounts to earn, more items, maybe level 70 cap(or give an extra 10 talent points to everyone at 60 instead).
---
And then you have to watch THIS

Take the path from Valley of Trials over the rocks and come out at Ratchet. Grab the flight path on your way to x-roads.  Grab flight path and head south to Camp Taraujo where you'll grab your last flight path before heading west to Mulgore.
---
Good points. My only concern is that tourists leave eventually, while the real community is made out of the people who are reservering names, etc.
---
Even a lot of these people will come and go during phases and such.
---
If it's anything like retail Vanilla, then only Hillsbrad will have reasonably reliable wpvp action.
---
but horde always dominate the PvE scene

Second icy veins. They have a classic section up on the site now with class guides.
---
Yea some people are being crazy cheap lmfao
---
Resilience divided gear into pvp and pve gear. Resilience is useless in pve, but essential in pvp, so you divide the game into two different entities. 
---
In vanilla, most pvp sets and weapons are also great for pve for a long time, while you also should supplement pvp gear with pve items. It just ran into the problem of the pvp gear staying mostly static the entirety of vanilla, while pve gear eventually outpaced it.
---
The stamina buff in tbc alone (basically +50% health for everybody) is enough to reduce the oneshot madness, it doesn't need a rigid segregation in pvp and pve gear, which means, there is zero reason for pvp players to ever pve and vice versa as well as being totally gimped when you do pve without pve gear vice versa.
---
To HAVE snagged.
---
Let try it your way
---
&gt; I mean you have 11am, 12am and then suddenly 1pm...it doesn't make sense
---
But as a more serious point, it's because anything past midday is pm. So as you soon as you get 1 milisecond past midday it's correct to call it PM. Try and look at this way
---
11:58 am
---
11:59 am
---
Midday
---
12:01 pm
---
12:02 pm
---
I wouldn't make sense to call it 12:01 am in the afternoon, that would be confusing.
---
the power gap between MC, blues and 20 man raids vs the power of AQ and naxx gear and the total lack of catch up mechanics in classic
---
means that any form of classic + content either has to
---
a) trivialize raid content with catch up gear
---
b) be a brick wall for non raiders
---
c) be trivial and boring/useless content for raiders
---
d) fend off the no changes mob
---
\-
---
I'll stick with it. TBC is a safe bet. It's cheaper to make and classic + will end up becoming TBC anyway because players will demand the class changes that they know to be possible (as they exist in TBC)

Did you get into beta and experience anything higher than 15? I felt like I had to watch my aggro with the VW tanking from 10-15 but it was easily manageable especially with multiple targets. I also have read multiple guides that go full on VW and they are labeled as classic guides, not vanilla and updated recently. I hope that they are going from beta and not a private server for info. People get very passionate about there being only one way to play. Of course all this will be forgotten once I hit 60, and then it will be everyone saying there is only one way to Raid or PVP etc..
---
Save this, this is some great stuff!
---
The thing you don't take into account, and most people don't when thinking about this, is that not everyone is constantly looking for a dungeon group. Alot of those dps players will just be solo leveling with quests or grinding mobs because it's faster for them, for example.
---
Sweet thanks boys! If you have any other sides aswell intake em

Do you think Blizzard really has any desire to be releasing new Content for classic as well as keeping retail going? That is wayyy to expensive for Actiblizz. They love Money too much :P
---
Why if you can just take old expansions and re-release them.. Easy Bucks xD
---
Yeah I feel you and I would totally agree. Although I would take a Little patch after classic that makes all Specs viable at least.
---
Spent like 4-5 hours trying to setup my AddOns during the stress test.
---
IMO arena is what helped kill world PvP and made the game a sweaty mess instead of a fun sandbox where you can try neat builds and get gear by actually playing/wandering the world and not hardqueuing arenas/bg all day.

Being ahead would mean you’d have to play really late at night to PvP during peak hours. 
---
Also if you wake up at eg 10 and play on a weekend, the server will be quite empty since it will be 7am in the US. This may be good if you want more resources to yourself, or bad if you want to play with others. Depends on what you want from the game

Way, way more powerful. It's essentially the all-in-one addon for true AH-players that combines many different features from profession / mail / AH / market related addons all into one.

Very cool idea. Perfect solution for all those who do wanna keep an active eye on it!

Druids are great healers because if their instant casts making them hyper mobile with travel form along with being able to break snares and polymophs at will.  with the CC they have and stealth you can be one of the most annoying a frustrating healers because of the effort it takes to kill you will get the enemy killed by whoever you were there healing in the first place. Along with inervate you have great sustain.
---
Druids are so stupidly annoying in pvp,
---
I wasn't talking about my feelings, wasn't asking you to care about them and it was pretty evident you don't care. I was talking *your* motivations, and what they reveal about you.
---
Duels / FFA arenas
---
You can still create characters on full realms, so there essentially is no cap, that's why they keep nudging players to move now.
---
If controversial stuff like the dungeon/raid finder was polled back in the day, I doubt it would pass.
---
Things like this always make me wonder how many people we come across online who are famous without even knowing it. It's gotta happen quite a bit.
---
You don’t think they’re more likely to come when the game actually releases?
---
It's a flair. If you're on pc you go to the sub and on the right side somewhere there is a flair button that lets you set faction and class. 
---
Not sure if you can do it on mobile. Not on "Reddit is fun" atleast

Nice im at work but noone will notice me listening to some guides ;)

---
Last 2 posts got posted twice lmao
---
Layers are going to be as big as the old servers, via Ion saying it multiple times. Starting zones will still be crazy crowded.
---
So if you don't mind- where does this put me as a english speaking person looking for a server? I don't want the gigantic ques on Shazzrah. I am def gonna play horde and I love playing with scandinavians since I always somehow played with them and always had a brilliant time. I speak a little bit norwegian but not enough. What server should I pick? I'm thinking Gehennas or Firemaw? Will there be a big language barrier?
---
That's a great name
---
I very much want it to exist; I just don't want to moderate it.
---
So in MC and for the majority of bosses in BWL (so basically, until phase 4 which is likely almost a year out) the fire resistance of enemies is just too high
---
Theoretically you could switch back and forth and do dungeons as fire, but that would be really expensive .
---
As a fellow mage, I deeply feel your pain, as frost raiding is utter butt cheeks.
---
That said, we reap the benefits after AQ and do nutty dps that is pretty fun! Can't wait for fire, but for MC and BWL (and ony!) it's a serious detriment to your raid to be fire, it's very selfish basically saying " id rather have fun pressing my keybinds than actually contributing to the raid"
---
&gt;, add a raid in one of the zones with gear about 5-8% stronger than the gear acquired in Naxx
---
Not even that much %, maybe like 1-3%, and they should figure out how to do "sidegrade" type itemization where the player can, instead of engaging in an endless power-grind for gear, raid for gear that better fits their build, playstyle, or looks.  I'm sure blizzard could come up with some ways to make gear more interesting rather than just hard stat upgrades.
---
Paladins are amazing in pvp.
---
I'll roll a Paladin, reasons:
---
1. you can tank dungeons
---
2. you can play ret for PvP
---
3. you can heal in raids 
---
4. free mount with 40
---
5. amazing lore and sets
---
Hahaha pretty epic actually.
---
Exept Shazzrah is bursting at the seams with players and ia going to have huge queues after phase 1.
---
They want to get all realms off of being full before launch without adding too many servers so they are adding them 1-2 at a time. They can't wait TOO long because there is only a week left until launch.
---
Yes because its a wind serpent :) I think...

not sure about vanikla, maybe npc scan?

So we need a queue for the queue.

I'll find you while you're pulling mobs
---
Dungeons, probably get away with it. Raids won't take you.
---
Haha, I’m rolling pve so I’m stoked to even see it at medium now - launch day might be high!
---
Sitting does not trigger enrage in Classic
---
the servers can handle it, the auth servers are the bottleneck
---
I think the griefing is gonna be huge, but seems awesome to me if it works. I hope to see an answer for this, might change my main
---
Sure mate, the arbitrary number you randomly decided on in your head without a data basis surely would have been a better idea.
---
Gotta have a flag carrier too in WSG!
---
Thats true and it's deliberate to slowly phase in green items as you progress through the game
---
&gt; I bet we get a few more to choose from in the coming weeks. 
---
Should be week because this is the last week before launch lol
---
Will there actually be a /world chat for WoW Classic?
---
Moreover it's exactly why classic is included in retail sub. People will check out and then go back on retail, blizzard knows it. But if it's included in retail, some on the verge of stopping might stay for classic, people who usualy cancel their sub when their is content drought will go on classic so they will stay subbed, and the last but not the least, a portion of classic player will be sub only for classic. And sure they will quit if blizard makes bullshit again
---
Sure, what the hell. Haven't done this one in a while.
---
Sorry to shatter the illustration :(
---
If you run to "the other end of the area" so it doesn\`t run into friends you lose time aswell when running back to the camp + you can use  HoJ freely to reduce your dmg-taken or to boost the dmg of your Seal of Command-Judgement. It equals out the dmg loss of one missing judgement. Just buy it for 40s and have a way more relaxed time :)
---
If shit really goes south, they will probably not hesitate to merge servers if needed.
---
Their first step back in the day used to be offering free transfers to low pop servers, so they have all the tools available.
---
Most people definitely arent subbed, myself included. I think only doubling the servers is pretty conservative. Itll be a mess
---

I played a mained a balance druid in Vanilla, I would say that for battlegrounds if we're being honest it's not as good as feral or resto. It's not bad, but it's certainly not as good as either of the other two. Feral in particular shines in WSG (though so does resto) and Resto druid is great in AV and AB, but balance just is kinda mediocre (though fun!). I'd say neutral for balance in BGs.
---
Shamans are good pvp healers. Their purge, shocks and totems can make a big difference. Mail armor and shield is also great to have as healer.
---
I would rate Paladins higher in general but if you go horde then Shaman is good.
---
Could say druid is better for the type of pvp healing where they stay out of enemy range and still manage to get some healing done on others (shaman/paladin could stay close and do their heals).
---
Priest is still very good also. It wouldnt be problem if you wanted to be priest.
---
I put Russian dressing on my pizza every day at school and it was delicious. Fight me bitch.
---
clickbait BS - that's not how layering works. You can read every single player in the global channels regardless of their layer
---
Age in gaming means nothing, we unite over the joy we feel and that you meet others for the first time without considering if their occupation is below yours or if your ages are too far apart to converse or other things...
---
a racist might without noticing get friendly with what he is against and realize his faulty bias
---
a kid can get a decent conversation with an adult without it having to be condecending
---
an adult can feel like a kid or the invigorating feeling he had then but now he knows more than ever before of what to do
---
eitherway its a game and it offers freedom
---
And one final thing, you said their info was from pservers, but the video I linked was from Skarm's actual personal experience tanking as a bear in vanilla on legit Bliz servers. He figured this shit out almost before anyone else and had to fight through the bias and ignorance. So I don't even need to see how it works out once classic goes live, I already know. Hopefully you realize the truth too.
---
That isn't really true though, often times combat dagger rogues will have 40-55% of their total damage output be from backstab. The white damage shrinks even further with seal fate when you lose 40% of your offhand dps.
---
I have that whole week off
---
I would argue that resto is poo for levelling. Nobody ever uses it.
---
"Lowbies" in MC had the keep way right on the bridge, or they could pull golemagg.
---
In my imo
---
All the people are going to be playing.  They did everything they could do this time around.  Godspeed.
---
I was under the impression that when the game starts there will be no queues because of layering and onyl have to worry about that once phase 2 is coming but by that time lots of people will quit
---
If they're gonna add tbc and wrath, please make them their own servers. I didn't want to play classic to be forced onto the expacs again.
---
Precisely. Bet at Blizzcon they announce the Khadgar Charity Mount...
---
Would be cool to see
---
hmm too bad it has no maps on it
---
 Idk if this effects it or not, and it was only 1 test, but I noticed the "xxx hours until launch" doesnt flip over on the hour when you are on the character select screen. This tells me that the client doesnt recieve an update from the server while on the character select screen, meaning the enter world button wont turn red when it launchs if you are logged into the character select screen.
---
Again, i only tested it once, feel free to test it yourself and verify. Also again im just assuming that if the hour timer doesnt roll over that means the button wont flip when it launchs. I cannot verify it.
---
Justin Bieber?
---
Taking days off for a game is stupid.
---
Gehennas for Swedes and Fins, Firemaw for Norwegians and Danes. No language barrier on either except for guild recruitment.
---
It's not just mana tide, trading 30 talent points in the resto tree (and mana in the enhance tree) for 30 strictly damage points makes a tremendous difference. They aren't even there best healers full resto spec, so going in with a compromise build is hugely noticeable.
---
You'll spend way more on consumables than respeccing would cost.
---
Can someone tell me why people write comments like this instead of just googling it if they don't know
---
Will probably go with Paladin because I like the initial endgame utility you have with the ability to AoE grind initial cash and run both tank and heal dungeons, before moving on to a Holy Shock/Ret build for raid healing/PvP
---
Plus the big savings on mounts are pretty good for a first character (though Warlock gets that too, of course).
---
I'd say that the versatility of a Pala and the ability to experiment with different roles (and still be sought after as a healer) compensates for the slow leveling speed. Though I never got why people hate the gameplay so much - I've always found it pretty chill to just stick on a film or browse the net while auto attacking away :)
---
i'm subbing the day before and making my 3 characters.

---
i see, thats what i fear off, because i do enjoy PVP and i heard those servers are more alive - but if that means that my 3 hours of game time will be divided into 1 hour to try get ready &amp; inside an instance and 2 hours of actual playing i might need to go back to PVE
---
As shamy you should have problems at least at the beginning to get a raid spot for MC. Every group will need that extra fire resi at the beginning.
---
When I started all I had to actually do was put up fire resi and wf totem 😉
---
Ah yeah and make sure I had enough ankh mats.
---
It works, but you are not likely to get in raids. Generally there is WAAAAAY to many people who want to tank (in raids, dungeons is the opposite) anyway, so haveing a unoptimal healer for the times when you don't need an extra tank is kinda a waste.
---
When everyone is super, nobody is.
---
It would inevitably change the leveling trajectory of some classes but only for the very early levels of some classes. I'm not sure this would destroy the balance of the game, since everyone would end with the same # of talent points.
---
what?
---
Even if you could make it to Durotar in a reasonable time, its one of the worse starting experiences. There will be so many Orcs is ridiculous, combined with Trolls in the same area. The quests suck compared to the Undead starting area as well. Better off getting him to run the the starting zone IF(Big If) you want to level through the starting zone together.
---
5-mans while levelling should be fine.  There aren't many (any?) talents that are absolute game changers in the feral tree (lots of good ones, but none that are suddenly going to remove your ability to tank if you don't have them).
---
In a raiding environment it's a more complex story, but still much the same.
---
A bear gets a lot of its strength simply from dure bear form, which isn't a talent.  You will definitely be a better tank if you go deep in feral, but in contrast, your guild will get a more flexible player if you spread yourself more. A lot of talents in feral focus on dps/threat; it's not really until you get to the last 2 rows that you see survivability and the crit buff for the raid come in.
---
I'd look at it this way.  Do you (and/or your guild) want a tank who can also do other stuff or a healer who can tank if required?  If you want to main tank (while also healing a bit), you will need to go deeper into feral; otherwise you should be fine.
---
There's 100% going to be queues on gehennas. A lot of people haven't subbed yet. Literally nobody subs for name reservation. Only small portion of reddit, which is also a small portion of the overall expected population.
---
I’d take Improved gouge for sure
---
They should run a poll for it
---
Hey at least I won't bother spending 10 minutes trying to get a group together for a rare now! Thanks for the videos! My only recommendation is if you have any lower level zones left to do, smash them out ASAP!
---
Yes, I leveled both as fury and arms various times and bloodthirst is just not good at level 40.
---
You will hit about 20-30% harder with MS than with bloodthirst and both cost 30rage. 
---
Especially as todays leveling meta goes towards heavy +agi stacking, because crit &gt; AP as long as you don't hit the crit cap which you don't while leveling.
---
At level 60 it goes as follows:
---
hit &gt; crit &gt; AP.
---
That's why you would use deathdealer breastplate as one decent pre BiS item over cadaverous armor. But if you hit enough crit via world buffs and other +crit items, cadaverous with its massive +ap becomes incredibly good.
---
Would be interested to see people opinions!
---
I sent you a PM
---
Don’t-ception
---
With the extra talent points you need a lot of the other stuff that tbc brought, this becomes apparent in PvP where you need more hp in comparison to dmg potential, otherwise all dmg specs will be absolute instakill gods in PvP.
---
I really loved TBC, especially the class balance, but theres a LOT more to it than just the talent system at that time.
---
I think it's implying that they are BFA players, and they are tourists in Classic.
---
Haha, truth.  I used to push tanks hard just to see how they react if they'll be good.  If I pulled off them not a big deal as mage just kite finish if they don't take it back.  Mainly just the trash I wasn't trying to wipe groups lol.  I'd watch my aggro for bosses or anything I couldn't control if things got out of hand.  Good info to hold onto when it comes to harder content later.
---
Having said that...I'm rolling my first warrior so I hope others push me just to get better.  I won't hold it against anyone if they pull aggro, good luck if you try I don't plan on making that easy.
---
I think "q" would be more likely to win in that regard since que is commonly pronounced as "ké" instead of "kyoo".
---
For the same reason you start a doomguard portal that kills a person at random, but telling them it's a healthstone well. It's hilarious.
---
Doing a pure rested XP run would be a different category. Ideally you would time the type of record Joana has from server opening to 60. (Joana's WR from vanilla was done on a fresh server where he got server first 60)
---
My friends and I have not yet resubbed and we think about rolling Gehennas but after Firemaw announce we are not sure anymore :)
---
I think we'll roll on Firemaw if it has at least High pop indicator at launch. We still have  a lot of time though

Nice

This is just so inaccarurate.

The answer is: It does not matter. There will be players of all nationalities on all servers. Most people don't read the forums.

The fuzzy nature of druid specs combine with your vague mission statement as the saving grace here. This is probably your least accurate and least useful graph, but at the same time no single issue is as offensively wrong as some of the details from your other guides.
---
It is a good argument for going PvE if you have limited time. I personally can't play without haveing the feel of danger that comes with a PvP server, but if that is not a problem to you PvE is quite good. After all you can still do PvP on a PvE server either through flagging yourself or do battlegrounds after they release.

Everybody speaks passable English in wow, stop obsessing on that. Even if there are a few guilds that are Spanish or Scandinavian or whatever it doesn't affect you in any negative way.
---
If these are all the servers were getting (4) then I'd guess the newest one is the logical choice if you have not already reserved names.
---
That wasnt broken, the servers were just locked. It allowed people a little time to log into the character select screen and release the character creation option once enough people were logged in. Think of it like lining runners up at a starting line before starting the race. The problem came from Blizzard not anticipate THAT many people logging in to create characters and it caused a bunch of other problems like disconnecting people, switching servers without the players knowledge and so on.
---
I assume it doesn't save the level of logged off people? If someone logs off to sleep they obviously don't show up in /who, but their level still exists.
---
I'll download it anyway, thanks for the effort!

Feral will shine even into AQ and with 40 people to gear it will take a long time for the gap to widen. It also completely depends on who you play with - some people don’t care about bringing competitive DPS (even though Feral are for the first few phases) and just bringing the people who turn up on time and know what they’re doing. I do agree that Feral will fall off later in the phase cycle, unlike most pure DPS classes, but with 40 spaces to fill I don’t see why they won’t be invited.
---
Three names ~~saved~~ Thexed.
---
That's just who killed the bosses 1st, and is only vanilla. If you go to wowprog and look at the last 3 xpac you'll see horde in the top 50 by like 80%+ which is insane.

I've never done any serious PvP in vanilla. Assuming you want the full epic PvP set, how is the nitty-gritty of it going to look like? Do you have to spam BGs at 8 hours a day for a month to achieve the highest ranks or can they be reached more gradually? I've read up something on how the ranking works but the part about it being relative to other players makes it difficult to get a real picture.
---
I notice you only use the ⭐ (clear best) only pally ret spec for leveling on all your posters so far.
---
yeah smart idea doing the same
---
I always leveled and loved doing wpvp, this is the build I used leveling up, starting by Sub.

But we're talking about vanilla?
---
Your salary sure seems highly relevant to this shitpost, you wanker.
---
I'll give you that, some number tweaking of the top end talents and new skills would be necessary, but their mechanics could stay the same.
---
In my opinion, TBCs greatest strength was it's characterization improvments. Outland was beautiful, but it sucked all the high levels out of Azeroth and murdered the world PvP scene. Flying mounts then killed off much of the danger in world PvP in outland too. 
---
So many specs had cool tools to use, it would be fun to unleash those tools on Azeroth.

---
Really awesome
---
At least there won’t be as big of a queue than on the other two.
---
Same thing nowadays sadly.
---
mage will be way easier to level
---
Will this work if I want to tank 5 mans while leveling?  Or is there a leveling guide that can account for that as well?  This is very pleasing on the eye and easy to reference...wondering if you accounted for tanking. :)
---
Correct, and since it's player-made, someone can just lock it, ban people from it etc.
---
I think LookingForGroup exists though, but I imagine you could get banned or at least muted for using it as a world chat channel.
---
I mean they fucked up, big time. The servers got full during name reservation. Which probably isn't even 50% of the players. Its gonna be a shit show and the first week will most likely not be very playable.
---
If I was working at Blizzard I would have opened at least two times as many servers as they have now after already adding 1 more to each region. If populatin drops (which it will) you deal with population issues then. 
---
Having the game be unplayable because of full servers is a great way to kill off the hype. But at least the release will be Blizzlike.

---
Personally I wish they added some sort of world pvp-enabling type content instead of organized PvP like bg/arena.  I had an idea about capturable bases/garrisons that you can invest gold into after capturing and get a gold investment return for every 3 hours you hold the base.  There would be 2-3 per continent and maybe they lock for 3 hours after capture to promote traveling. I know they didn't add more to world PvP stuff because it has an effect on servers, but world PvP is what makes WoW so amazing in the first place and should be promoted not lessened.   
---
Flying mounts were not the sole reason for world pvp dying.  It was an accumulation of many additions/changes.  Anything that "takes people out of the world" or gives people a way to avoid traveling, is what kills world PvP and the overall feel of the world being huge.
---
I know the entire comment revolves around IF they do classic ++ but for me classic must stay EXACTLY as it was back then. I'd rather have the classic experience and then "TBC classic" release with the possibility to clone your toon to the TBC server and keep vanilla char on vanilla server. That way people could see the evolution as it was or keep playing the "superior wow".
---
Thing that do not impact on the game in itself like simplification of macros or autoloot instead of shift+click etc are fine because it's quality of life, in the same taste they could reduce the time needed to craft an item (like crafting 20 shoulder pad for the simple sake of leveling taking 10 mins is... well... ) 
---
I could even see some things like the haircut change as it only impacts your vision of your own character but NO WAY, and  i prey all the blizzard gods,  they put transmog. The possibility to estimate an ennemy power in pvp just by seeing what he looks like is an absolute must.
---
As for the level cap or new gear it would imho denaturate the game. I mean in the same taste they could increase the debuff slot on ennemies making more classes/specs viable like affliction WL but it would mean other dps threshold and reworking bosses strats/healthpool. Meaning that the guys that want "the exact same experience" couldn't compete with those willing to sacrifice authenticity for new things.
---
This is after all this is the whole point of wow classic, taking the exact same elements and giving them back to the community like they asked. If you do wow classic BUT , it's not wow classic.
---
The one without 5h queue.
---
Make a pretty good pvo pocket healer and main tank healer on horde side too
---
So this means Stalagg's already got something like 20-30,000 players on it I think
---
I don't doubt it, if I'd be playing solo. But I'll be taking my time leveling accompanied by my old wow buddies, so what's easiest/most effective really doesn't matter to me.
---
Great map! Please do alliance as well
---
Man, I wish 250,000 copies sold and a total population of 200,000 was still viewed as large. Now if it isn't millions it ain't shit.
---
It’s sad that even 15 later and after druids have been proven as capable tanks for the vast majority of PVE raid encounters we will still misinformation being spread along.
---
With a compass and grid you do. Also more wasted time that could get a second toon to 60.
---
:( :( :( :( :(
---
Why wouldn't Quartz work?
---
oh you're right !
---
still dumb tbh its a few silver, wont get you epic mount any faster and can be such a bother in groups, plus hes allready ahead on mount game duo to free lvl 40 mount
---
/s
---
The whole point of the phase 1 layering is so you don't have to fight 37 people for mob tags.
---
So you have no source saying the queues are capped at 12k?
---
Fuckn not bahddd good soize
---
i could care less... If the topic is relevant imo i will respond and at least i added to the subject at hand unlike your petty remark that didnt add to a thing...
---
Depends on the healer. A resto shaman really is weaker than an elemental due to the talents fitting more into a PvE playstyle (like the Manatide totem only having 5HP and getting stomped immediately). 
---
However a holy paladin just throws on his tier set he never gets to wear in PvE and stomps horde aplenty with his trusty warrior friend.
---
I personally playing as warrior very rarely played solo. Maybe 5% of my playtime. 
---
Log on, get a whisper, open a group, let's go.
---
Playing a healer or warrior and then doing solo content is just asking for misery. 
---
Then again people can play melee hunters I suppose.
---
Btw good players are aaalways in demand. I never had a problem getting into a guild, because apart from topnotch cutting edge hardcore raids, guilds always try to cut their latest slackers who don't pull their weight. A good player will find a guild.
---
tbc talents would be awesome since they make a lot of meme specs viable. 
---
needs some serious balancing though doesnt matter if 10talent points more or less
---
Told my boss I was going to be out of town for the next 3 weeks. 
---
He’s like where to? 
---
AZEROTH.
---
Think from your own perspective, and I'd like to think that there will be people who will do like this: come after work and see that your server is in 10k queue. You don't have a guild, but have a name reserved for some reason. Say fuck it, and choose medium or server without queue, because you actually wanna play the game. I guarantee there will be some people like that for sure.
---
Yeah I'm sure you'll have plenty of FAP's while leveling...
---
You know exactly who Henry Cavill is, this doesn't make you look cool
---
Zenn is actually extremely strong xp (450) and it's doable very early. Doing the follow up quest of "clicking 3 things while doing ANY other quest from delanaar" grants basically free 650 xp adding up to 1100 xp total, which is almost a 3rd of a level from 6 to 7.
---
It was a group effort with 19 other people, it is not like the lore insinuated that 5.000.000 players invaded Icecrown citadel. There is some gameplay and story segretation necessary for things to make sense.
---
This. For that entire zone I was rocking out at my desk
---
They will be on the same layer if invited; and you will be unlikely to be affected.
---
Well, i'm multiboxing (usually 5box) since BC and you're wrong, we usually struggle with gold.  
---
You have to spare 5 times the amount of a solo player to get gear, mounts or whatever, so compare the amount of gold of one player vs a boxer is irrelevant. Only the gold per active character is relevant because we don't box as a way to feed a main character, we play all of them, we have to equip all of them, and a lot of method of gold farming availiable as a solo player don't work well with us because they will not scale with our group (farming herbs/minerals, playing with AH).  
---
I don't think we can get per character the amount of gold/h of a solo-boxer, especially when non-patched DM will launch.
---
But is it really worth it for just one trinket? Is this the BiS trinket in the whole game?
---
Why

My original plan was (or is) to level and play a ret paladin at release. I'm reading so many dreadfully bad things about my favourite class that I'm about to change my mind. Are paladins viable at 60? Are they fun to play? Please convince me!
---
Define scale bad? 
---
\- Bear druid in Naxx gear wins over warrior in naxx gear in PvP. You just sit there and tank the warrior. 
---
\- Resto druid is always a worse healer than paladin, shaman or priest, but still scales enought that the gap between the classes never widen. 
---
\- Cat is a 3.6; not good, not terrible.
---
Good Map. Whats the Orange Powder left of the gates?

Looking for a Semi-Hardcore guild or group. Looking for an NA server, but not set on one in particular, except that I probably won’t be on Herod.

⚡ LATE NIGHT RAIDING ⚡
---
📋 Guild: &lt;Dominatus&gt; [H] [Arugal]
---
🌄 Time Zone: GMT+ 10
---
⌚ Raid times:  10:00pm - 1:30am Mon/Weds/Thurs (+ Sunday as a reserve night if needed)
---
📝 Goals: PvE (Semi-hardcore raid progression)
---
🎲 Loot: EPGP/council
---
🔎 Info: Dominatus is a late-night, semi-hardcore guild. Raiding will start at 10:00pm GMT+10 time so this would suit WA/SEA players or East Coast nightowls. We will not be rushing for server firsts but intend to develop into a high quality raiding guild for like-minded players.
---
📥 Applicants:  Applicants: Vanilla raiding experience is preferred but not mandatory. It is expected that players will have a moderate-to-advanced knowledge of their class as well as a committed ethos to raiding (familiarising yourself with mechanics, farming consumables, acquiring BiS gear, raid attendence etc).

When invite is accepted for a party the player is then swapped to the layer the party leader was on and you should stay in the same layer with your friends as long as your grouped on in the same landmass
---
Don't see many LH strat in the wild.
---
&gt;I'd look at it this way.  Do you (and/or your guild) want a tank who can also do other stuff or a healer who can tank if required?  If you want to main tank (while also healing a bit), you will need to go deeper into feral; otherwise you should be fine.
---
I think i'm too institutionalised by retail... thinking I can have it all, tank, heals, dps and pvp viability. I think this spec is scary close to having a lot of options... but falls sort of perfection. Kind of like the old Druid saying "Jack of all trades, Master of none".
---
 It misses a few healing buffs through talents and tanking buffs through threat and LotP. These short comings aside... it gets Insect Swarm and gains 20% str,int,stam from HotW, which normal resto druids lack. I think a big selling point for me is also its utility in PvP, druids are difficult to counter , especially when you can use both feral/balance and resto abilities. 
---
I'm beginning to ramble...
---
You make a good point! I guess we will have to take one for the team :)
---
Back in the day, in actual vanilla, myself and other Druids tanked the same bosses that Druids have been tanking in pservers so you are really just looking for excuses to continue to spread misinformation on Druid raid tanking. You are dead wrong and unfortunately a lot of persons will take these infographics as gospel. 
---
And please do try to come up with a better response than to patronizingly calling me silly like you did to another user.
---
Look bud, at this point I'm starting to think these infographics are just going to be positive no matter what.
---
Well unless it's a popular forum topic to slate a spec. E.G. Pally.
---
Tenner bets OP or GF is playing a drood
---
that's general trade goods merchant, where you can get mining pick etc...
---
See you there
---
&gt;other classes aren't interested in your stats.
---
depends.. if you go cat druid you will be competeing with rogues, warriors and hunters over crit, hit and agi gear.
---
In a old interview where he mentioned that was playing WoW and missed a very important phone call, he said he played as a healer...not sure if he always plays that role tho.
---
One thing that TBC is far far superior for me than vanilla were the class design and mechanics. They literally breath life into each classes, making them very unique and appealing - even retri paladins, while maintaining the class uniqueness and character. It would be nice to see in upcoming content
---
You clearly haven’t seen any stress test or beta testing my dude
---
You might wanna get close to me at this point.
---
Germany even got 2 servers more. But we only had 2 in the beginning so... fair I guess?
---
I would like to see content released as part of classic as an alternate timeline. TBC was amazing, however it changed core mechanics, like flying, which in turn killed wpvp. So yeah for me it is staying with Classic and adding content it that style and vibe would be amazing.
---
Landmass? So if we are in westfall and he needs to go to stormwind for any reason, he has the chance to be relayered? will he return to our layer when he comes back close to us?

NA PST - Alliance PVE - NA - Healer/Priest
---
If this is the wrong section to post this in I apologize, I felt like I fit a little in the middle.  
---
I've been playing MMOs for quite a few years now (normally as DPS or healer), however classic WoW is going to be my first proper experience with WoW (beyond a very very short stint with a friend years ago.). I was getting tired of Blade and Soul and thought this would be a good thing to hop to. I liked healing so that's what I was going to do and was looking for a guild focused on actually doing PvE content like dungeons and raids as well as people to potentially level with. I'm a casual but dedicated player and my playtime depends on my college load so I'll be taking things at the pace I can so apologies on that. While discussable, I have Arma ops on weekend afternoons (normally 4pm pst to 7pm pst) so unless raid times are later than that, i'll have to discuss that with a guild/ group if they'd still like me to potentially join.  
---
Note I'm not locked down to any server yet, however I really really wish to be on a server with guilds focused on PvE/ raids, as some of my past MMO experiences got ruined by friends putting me on RP or dead servers in games and ending up having no one to play with who actually wanted to do content.  
---
I look forward to any replies, and if this isn't in the right spot, do let me know.
---
Tabasco on your pizza? Wtf... doesnt that clash with the pineapple?
---
You can get some big chips slices out of that one.
---
\&gt; I'm expecting to transfer at some point because server pops will decline. 
---
The entire point of layering is that server pop can decline by like 80% or whatever and you still have a good server population.
---
You mean like that one beta test that was layered so much it looked like on one was online? If a ton of people were in one area it's because they were testing it, because that was the point.
---
It is absolutely not inaccurate.
---
While there will be players of all nationalities on all servers, there will be a snowball effect that might be substantial (we don’t know). 
---
Its not unreasonable to predict there will be more Norwegians than swedes on Firemaw and vice versa for Gehennass.
---
On Y2K I knew things would be fine because the *real* Y2K is scheduled for 2038.
---
Never played back in Vanilla, but I did get to play few days of stress testing at the beginning of August, and I actually enjoyed it more than I ever enjoyed retail. Everything feels so personal to character development, and I just love it.
---
No, as the other guy said, some classes profit way more from additional talent points than others. There are classes that would only benefit moderately while others would get extremely strong because the final talents synergise
---
LOL
---
can u update it? and make tiny icons on the side saying whats what?  
---
noob here &lt;3  
---
i love the map. gonna print it out if you update it so i have it above my monitor :)
---
One thing you'll learn about classic is that there is something called resistance / immunity...
---
Spells and abilities aren't "just" magic damage, it is shadow, nature, frost, fire, and holy. 
---
Your gear can have this resistance stat, (and you'll need it for later) ...
---
Unfortunately this means that creatures also have this ability, it makes rp sense, that a creature made of fire can't rally be hurt by it...
---
It makes for some sad fire mages , but luckily frost is fun enough :)
---
You get to take revenge in bwl.
---
Also, remember respecting is expensive as hell , so you might want to stick with frost for a long time...
---
Leveling as a fire mage is possibly buy you'll learn another truth about classic, while you have a lot of talent freedom and choices, you are forced to do one thing regardless of what you think is how you want it... 
---
So I would suggest you go frost for leveling, if you haven't tried classic yet, you'll notice that mages are **not** tanky, if the adds catches you, you die, and frost offers so much control you'll be blown away - or rather the adds will :)
---
Judy my 2 cents, play as you will, but don't turn up for molten core with a fire spec, it's a sure way to be beaten by even healers (who uses their wands)
---
Is this even real? The only source I can find is off of a twitter fan account. His Instagram and fb don’t have this picture on it.
---
This...
---
The carnage he's going to leave in his wake will be incredible.  Between him and Hogger, the Alliance have some blood letting mobs in their starting zones.
---
Shower thought:  can a mob of level ones take this guy on?  say...100 of them?
---
It was by killing a mob in one of the Silithus hives.
---
The use of democracy is to keep running the same system.
---
Anything revolutionary or innovative requires dictatorship.
---
Can you summon whatshisname? That big walking tree thing? Or is that a different patch?
---
Is it possible to make a mouseover macro for group invite?
---
Zygor, but it requires a subscription.
---
You'll need only 20 talent points in Frost tree for PvE.
---
So You can be a Fire Mage.
---
nope, zeppelins are free
---
Buckle up man you’re in for a rude awakening on launch day, each layer holds a highly decent amount of people. Everyone will be starting out at the same place..
---
Feral are actually second top DPS in pre-raid-bis in a raid environment, ~750DPS without MCP and ~850DPS with MCP. Feral are competitive quicker than other classes which means they will be good at raiding faster. Check the meme spec most, Feral will be good into AQ I promise that.
---
absolutely beautiful thanks
---
That is false, the finnish Horde coalition joined Gehennas and the Alliance will stay on Shazzrah.
---
im happy for it ...boring azeroth ...not everyone running around in epic gear ....your status on the server meaningful whether it be pvp, pve, professions.  Gonna be glorious!
---
Guns sounds are the best 😊
---
PS unpopular opinion ... I play without sound 🤭
---
Vanilla rogue forever set me on the path of the rogue in all games after. It literally changed my identity. And no game ever captured that same magic that the rogue class in vanilla did. I've leveled multiple rogues in retail and on private servers. Literally the only reason I'm not making a rogue this time is because I've done it too much! And even then it's still my backup plan.
---
Rogues are truly something special in classic.
---
Does anyone know if Defiance talent also improves the threat from Battle Shout and Bloodrage (rage gain)? I know in tooltip it say "increase threat of your attacks" but it might have been a poor description back then..
---
Hours in servers queue? Yes
---
How?
---
"Blu mu"
---
Need water between you and a load screen for layering to be different
---
Even that's pushing it
---
Its basically just 2 addons. Tukui for 99% of what you see and maxui which just adds extra customization options. The layout is pretty much the default. I just tweaked some of the scaling  and turned on some of the extra info display around the ouside areas.
---
Leveling healer is also a DPS and some of them also can tank 5-mans. This isn't retail, you aren't fixed one one spec-role at a time.
---
Un'Goro set up with a few friends so all 5 of us would hit 60 by killing a Devilsaur!
---
Blizzard's not ready to deal with such amount of players, IMO they didnt expect so much hype and interest. I mean, this is big, bois. Hope a solution is found soon bcause nobody likes infinite queues or, whatever the reason, being unable to play a game so long waited. As a result, WoW players are disoriented and dont know what to do. 
---
For example, I know im not playing it from day 1. Must be patient for all this to solve and relax. Hope queues are not so long for you guys who are playing it from launch day, for real.
---
Worst bait on this sub.
---
Just because there's layering don't expect a personal safe haven.
---
There's still going to be heavy competition, mobs are very much a resource in vanilla.
---
Sunken Temple quest should be phase4 content
---
I will be spending a lot of time fishing whilst leveling up, so this is much appreciated! Just wanted to point out a couple of errors though: Elwynn Forest has 2 n's, Dun Morogh is 2 words, Redridge is 1 word
---
Where do you work, good sir?
---
It was quite fine on stress test. Dynamic respawn works wonders
---
This is a very good summary, I expected lots of misinformation but this hits it home good.
---
Let me add:
---
Vs priests shaman is usually favored because purge is a real bitch.
---
Vs ret paladins it depends on if you know what you do. Low/mid skill is way ret could be slightly favored with all cds Rdy. High skill level ele is favored
---
We had 15 years to establish. That if you want to get anywhere in wow. Be it raiding PvP or god forbid RP. Then you need to be where the most people are. No exceptions.
---
I‘m going to main/OT with my druid and will be flexible for alle the fights i don‘t tank anymore, maybe i‘m going to live the dream of every druid! But i‘m very involved in guild organisation which probably got me the spot for something like that.
---
Yes it is! Big like a baby poo
---
HIGH RES WALLPAPERS
---
How did you get toneet that up? Private?
---
Leveling a warrior on a pvp server  **(in 6 months when potions are being steadily sold on the AH and you can afford to buy them with the money from your main)** ? dont forget this neat trick. (Screw mages)
---
Yeah that's what I read but I don't see how it works in practice. If I do casual 10-15 BGs a week, how far will that get me? Also does that mean that the more players are aiming for higher ranks, the more difficult are they making it for each other?
---
One can tell that you put time into this and I like your approach. Regarding the Deep prot spec I am concerned by you taking Tactical Mastery up to a point to then discard Anger management completely.  
---
Regarding impale I prefer (on my end) discard the whole arm tree except for the line until anger management. Then I take 5 in Cruelty. I would be 11/5/31 with 4 points left.   
---
And regarding of my raid comp I would have the choice to drop my 4 points into either :   
---
\- Imp. HS  
---
\- Imp. Revenge  
---
\- Imp. Sunder  
---
\- Imp. Demo. Shout  
---
Demo shout is my personal favorite tbh, its damage reduction and mitigation has just been proved to be that much efficient. It's a my personal favorite as it's a roundabout very good talent so I'd drop 4 poi
---
Skeram, mashem, stick em in a queue.
---
That little hub around Hemet Nesingwary is gonna be a graveyard.
---
Try gehennas instead
---
Not sure about the finnish but the danish and norwegian horde communities are going to the new Firemaw PvP server that opens tonight. You should come join :D
---
Man, I really wanted to be on that server. It's such a cool name :( I just don't want any queues.
---
This was really cool during the stress tests but it was very who hungry. Glad to see you've changed that.
---
Just go watch Kargoz video on youtube. It has a link to a power point for pages as well. And its accurate.

You're missing the point. That would have never happened. The discussion is about Blizzard only releasing a small amount of servers and then after that releasing more. This leads to people having to move. The counterargument people are saying is to just have more servers from the first announcement so all are an appropriate size and nobody had to move.

Fckk.... I knew I did something wrong... I was like - ohh it's locked we better don't join yet - and joined at like 10 mins past the official time because I thought Blizz can't fck up that hard :D
---
Turns out I'm the one that was stupid ;)
---
Ty for the Info!
---
A kind of dry toast / biscuit, but that's not important right now.
---
Check his twitch. It's on classic beta. its from like 7 days ago.
---
Usually it’s mt and mh first - after that dkp.
---
Priest, most likely Dwarf but I could roll UD as well.
---
There medium server pop is over the original server population cap” so I think original blizz like is incorrect for world pvp
---
Support your reasoning or continue to ride Blizzards dick with a blindfold screaming “Daddy”.
---
just go female gnome with 2 pink ponytails, they are broken
---
rend doesn't give u extra auto attack like whirldwind or mortal strike... I was comparing rend dmg with additional damage on heroic strike...
---
LMFAO
---
Ask your grandpa for advice if you rly need that blessing of wisdom
---
Lol what, you mean the russians? Scandinavia is deadset on gehennas
---
Yeah, I was joking, since it's very good for healers too.
---
There will most likely be an update right before the "gates open".
---
Not at level 18
---
Someone posted this [link](https://classicmaps.xyz/sandbox/) a few days back. I just followed the instructions. As an FYI you can skip everything prior to the "Preparing your World of Warcraft installation for the World of Warcraft Classic Beta client" section.
---
rend doesn't give u extra auto attack like whirldwind or mortal strike... I was comparing rend dmg with additional damage on heroic strike that is added to your white hit... your statement makes no sense
---
That's not a fuckup, they deliberately lowballed the number of servers because they can always make more to meet demand like they've been doing but can't reduce the number. Better to go too low than too high.
---

Thanks, I'll check it out.

---
So why did they decide to move this time?
---
SEVONE SEVONE SEVONE SEVONE
---
Yes
---
I just hope they go up instantly when more people subscribe. It's gonna be a shitshow if they let people queue for hours first, get to 10 and then suggest that they maybe should switch servers to avoid queues.
---
Ohh, the original Valley of Spirits... finally!!!

Do you not have one?

I started playing in wrath. So this is a learning experience for me.

I know this may sound weird, but if you have free time and willingness, just pick up a *groups psychology* book and try to apply it to wow. Specially leadership chapters.

Cheers.

History is now old man!

Because illustrations aside, these things aren't very good. Leveling resto in 1.12 is only slightly better (because of changes to cat stats in 1.7 and the bear form armor fix in 1.3) than druid at launch -- which still started with 11 points in balance for Natural Weapons and Omen of Clarity, mind you -- making it arguably the worst leveling spec in the game, as well as ridiculously self-crippling (imagine turning down Feline Swiftness, wtf. Feral really should have gotten the "Clear best" star). But the OP's schtick of "I'm open to criticism!" then being chronically closed off to criticism...I think my standards are too low at this point to be properly offended.
---
Hi, sorry this is a late reply to your post but did you end up finding your guild? I happen to know of an LGBT guild rolling on an EU RP Server (Alliance)
---
Your suggestion costs Blizzard about $20 million. The amount of people paying for just one month for the nostalgia is unheard of, most likely. Open beta would give a large sum of people their fill without ever paying.
---
that is what lockable closets are for
---
Is this where we sign up for PM's?
---
This is not the majority of people, and is an outlier case of severe character hoarding.
---
i like you :D
---
very jealous!
---
Would also like to see some
---
I always liked Ambush as a quick way to get some hp down right at the beggining of a battle, so I leveled up with a Dagger in my main hand. Off-hand used to be Dagger/Sword depending on what was available. 
---
Combat/Assasination is good, as it allows you to "farm" mobs quicker from time to time and grants you more damage over time, but you lack some good pvp talents and stealth improvements which would help you kill other players (stealth detection, additional dmg/combo points when using Garrote/Ambush...). 
---
Also, you can take those 2 points from Dirty Deeds and put them on Elusiveness, so you reduce CD on Vanish and Blind, which can help you get out of bad situations (remember Improved Sprint too).
---
Your on point in the ele tree. Your resto tree is completely fucked up though.
---
Your clearly doing it wrong , you have a little goldfarmer right there ! Get that little guy an account and get him mining!
---
Thanks a lot for this! I've only leveled a rogue to 20 on a private server and I really enjoyed it, can only imagine that it gets better and better.
---
Any particularly memorable stories come to mind?
---
30% movement speed starting at level 20. Bro, do you even theorycraft?
---
For the people askin how:
---
You can always level as fire and then respec for MC. 
---
Use an elemental talent build. Then you play mostly with firespells except rank 1 frostbolts for the slow and frost nova. It's totally doable while leveling and you'll be a bit unique.
---
I think it could still use some work. Warriors getting to be the *only* real tanking choice in raids AND having the highest dps while Paladins have to forgo their class fantasy and sit in a dress and heal instead of wearing plate armor and swinging a giant hammer? Pretty shitty if you ask me.
---
Never stayed in touch with him really, he was just another hardcore roleplayer on the server. Didn't belong to a guild or anything. I hope he does come back to bear his way to 60 once more.
---
There is a website that will show you multiple options besides bis for each slot before MC as for a AddOn you could use atlas loot and make a favorite list of all the items you will need to acquire you still have to put some effort into finding out what items can but subbed but, atlas loot can make it where you don’t have to constantly look up the items this could save you some time.
---
Do you have any estimate number of players that your project is holding on Gehennas?
---
working on it
---
I could see him as Arthas tbh, He has the height and good looks to play Arthas.
---
Druids can't talk in bear form.
---
I don't think that will happen. Classic and retail will be able to run alongside each other just fine. Think about it.
---
Classic is always moving at a rather slow pace. There is nothing to "rush" through in classic. When you wake up in the morning, you do not have this pressure on you that you have to log on and do all the WQs and other stuff for today to not miss out on that rep grind for your flying. In Classic, you can do pretty much anything at your own pace and only have to worry about weekly raid lockouts.
---
Retail, on the other hand, has this weird cycle going on. When ever a new expansion is released, or a new major content patch, you will have a total rush for content for a few weeks, but after that, when you have grinded through everything that is new, done all the raids, got all the new reps to exalted etc. you always fall into this lethargic state where you log on and have no clue what to do with your time. So you barely play anymore until the next patch rolls around.
---
I predict that a lot of people will put most of their playing time into Classic, and whenever a new retail expansion or big patch is released, they will shift their focus over to that, burn through the new content in a few weeks, and then get back to Classic. It's not like they are missing out on too much of anything when they let Classic rest for a few weeks, you know.
---
Not saying that everyone wil be like that. You will definitely have part of the playerbase being focused on Classic almost exclusively and another part not caring about Classic at all and stick with retail. But I predict that more than half of the playerbase will have this cycle where they focus on retail with every new big patch for a few weeks, then get back to Classic once retail gets boring again.
---
It was me ^^. The wallpaper cheatsheet is made to have information abd to be beautifull. Too much info remove the beautifull aspect ^^
---
You guys need a bluetooth
---
ye the LFG channel exists on beta at least, I haven't actually tried but afaik addons can't use the blizz defined channels (General, Trade, etc) for sending hidden addon messages
---
Yo momma's got a mythic chest...
---
Doesn’t matter though - 4-5 servers and 1000 layers is stupid
---
Now for SW, IF and Darnassus &lt;3
---
It's almost as though Classic wow isn't the main game. Like a side project or something. Weird right?
---
If you have the "correct" discord server then reply to this comment with a link to it, if there really is a norwegian discord server that just went official with Firemaw and has 4700+ users I'll edit my post of course.
---
13 hours after the announcement, I checked the link again.. same link. Is the "real one" up in the 5k's now or what? Or is the 4700 an estimated number that you think you might reach in the future? Probably shouldn't claim to have 4700 users then.
---
It sure just seems like an attempt to gaslight people, which is kind of ironic because that's what the norwegian players on Shazzrah was claiming the nordic classic coalition was doing.. difference being they actually hosted their own website and up-to-date google doc documenting exactly which guilds were going where AND gave individual discord links to the guilds if you wanted to check them out and talk to those people personally.
---
forgot reagents =)
---
Chris Hemsworth is the perfect Arthas though =D And it would be badass to see him as Lich King arthas.
---
i have very limited time, gonna roll on pvp nevertheless. love the heartattacks i get when im suddenly attackt or see a gang of red names running towards me. wouldn't want to miss my bloodpressure suddenly peaking at 200 after a pvp fight.
---
pve servers feel like singleplayer games for me, and i never finish singeplayer games. i need the looming threat and the possibilty to become it myself, be able to throw in a gank in here and there
---
Kids who play free to play games don’t play subscriptions. If they do, good in them.
---
I agree with your post though, most people won’t subscribe until release day
---
they've fucked up everything they've done for years. I can't imagine how people can still be riding blizzard dick at this point.
---
your suggesting over 1 million people subscribed specificly for the last stress test? Did blizzard say as much? If true then they absolutely didnt make enough realms available. Your also suggesting(unless I'm misinterpretting) that whole group will quit in a month.
---
But hey lets roll with it "giving up 20million" for early subs but increasing hype and gauging awareness/interest to better prepare for launch, which would drasticly increase server stability in the longterm. Which even if it only retained an additional 1/10 subs would pay out much more. And it should be noted that the last stress test got delayed so much that even if you subbed specifically for it your game time would overlap with launch.
---
Nice wallpaper cheatsheet! I like it =)
---
Look at all these people that care about ur business trip boomer
---
Example?
---
Bald is beautiful, my friends, never forget...
---
Do you have a link to any? PM me if you do, would be useful
---
This is not true just for hardcore guilds. If you think that people won't get angry when you give extremely rare and powerful items to someone who contributes 50% of the average DPS, you're in for a surprise.
---
When in doubt, go rogue.
---
I swapped from Herod to Skeram not because of ques at launch but once they turn off layering before phase 2 I see the server being massively over populated with a longer que than at launch.
---
this strategy doesn´t work everywhere and HoJ+SoCJudgement on a fleeing mob where one more auto-attack would be enough is overkill anyways.
---
Ammunition NPCs - the one for bullets is where you can set hearth and the other one.. OKAY GOOGLE
---
i had a friend make the char the second i deleted mine and took my time to create the looks then made it again, called Donut, i have other names that are not so good i keep deleting and remaking, but something like pickle, i would be careful. seems to be bots
---
As an Australian part of me wants to agree but id rather see him as Uther.
---
Shazz for me - UK
---
I liked questing in AV a lot in private servers. I hope it is still somehow relevant in Classic.
---
We're going to have a lan party for the first two weeks after launch, and we're going to start playing on alliance. My friend figured it would be cool to have a flag on the wall or something, but couldn't find a fitting one anywhere online... so he just made this banner himself.
---
He doesn't really use reddit, but he figured that you guys would probably like it so he asked me to post it here. If you have any random questions related to the project, feel free to ask and I'll forward the questions to him.
---
Cool idea but surely its easier to just ask the guards than referring to a map every time?
---
We had plenty of say the first time around. Just about everything they added to wow were things that the community asked for.
---
that's the one I'm most likely to do next (if I don any lol)
---
At max health it still provides 10% attack speed increase, which means more dps than an undead mage who has no dps racial
---
Hi. What font is that? :)
---
I don't get it
---
Blizz needs to get Cavill on a Classic commercial
---
So surprised how so many people on this sub found out so late.
---
Haha ! Exactly, so many people defending their clearly out to get more money practises. None of these people defending them players classic back in the day - imo
---
What is that weird space goat the orc is standing on?
---
TBC is my favorite time in the life of the game, so you pretty much just @ me there guy.
---
You say floating rocks and I give you fighting an elemental lord in the heart of a volcano.  You say big war machine and I say AQ.  You say demon armies and I point to chromatic dragon hordes.  Heck, C'thun is the only old god/eternal the players actually get credit for taking down.
---
TBC was everything vanilla was polished and given new features.  Balancing, talents, raids, factions, ect.  The most controversial thing they actually changed from classic was flying mounts.
---
Don't get me wrong.  I am beyond hyped for classic.  Don't knock TBC though.  It was the purest expansion and probably the best experience to have.
---
So Quartz won't work?
---
&gt;Blizzard knows what they’re doing; they have analysts that have undoubtedly viewed data from other games
---
Then how come they have had to increase the number of servers so much (by 50% overall?) already???
---
The game 'opened' for name reserving 1 week ago, but we are still a week from actual launch.  Almost every server (globally) is high or full (the only real exceptions are rp servers (and even these are starting to fill up) and any newly released servers).
---
I would suspect that it's a reasonable expectation that we will only see 50% (at most) of players registered before launch...
---
This means that Blizzard may well need to instantly double the number of servers next Tuesday...
---
It
---
Let me guess. Alliance quest in northern Ashenvale that has you killing Twilight cultist NPCs until one of them drops this "orb" thing?
---
I fixed it:
---
Confirmed: Playing WoW Classic makes you feel like a successful, millionaire actor and makes you feel like you look like a Greek god to boot!
---
1. No
---
2. No
---
Solved
---
Its great, less competition!
---
Pølse for fan man???
---
I agree and if the population doesn't drop off severely I don't think Blizzard will have any option but more servers and free transfers if they ever hope to get down to 1 layer per server.
---
Wait what?
---
Better than the first, although did Stiches have jaundice in Vanilla? Also is that 'river' accurate?
---
Post was deleted, please send me private message :D
---
&gt; Is it a good solution?
---
Shitting up other people's servers with people who don't care about it?
---
We can't, and it doesn't work.
---
You don't really hang out on the warrior discord or the theorycraft discords? Like, I appreciate your work and effort, but you are undermining people who have spent hours testing during the beta and more... Cause then you would know the common mistakes done in these builds:
---
\- Blood craze is just never worth the talent points, you would be better off putting those literally anywhere else.. 3% of max health is not much. In PvP it does not even equal the difference between a crit and a normal attack. In PvE leveleing as a warrior you should not fight mobs that are orange or red level to you, and the chances of getting crit by a yellow or green mob is almost nothing. In endgame dungeons and raids 3% of max is very little compared to your incomeing damage and again you should not be crit here because a combination of high defence skill and the fact taht shield block completely pushes crits off the attack table. The fact that you don't get this 3% health instant just makes it even worse. It is included in some builds where you use a /sit macro to get crit at the start of combat to trigger enrage, but even in that build the talent is not actually worth it if you do the math, but people still seem to swear to it.
---
\- Because of how crit supression works you never want a build that does not have 5/5 cruelty.. aka relocate some points in your general purpose specc.
---
\- For tanking impale prot is a dead specc used on private servers that got things wrong. It does less damage and threat than just going 5/5 cruelty because of how crit supression works. aka, you can save 6 talent points and still do more damage and generate more threat. 
---
\- Those points should be put into Anger Mangement witch works differently from what the tooltip says it does. In fact it simply generates 1 rage per 3 seconds both in and out of combat, witch is quite good in rage starved situations.
---
\- The utility talent in the prot tree are not low value, they just tend to be a situationally good and hence are often dropped for other talents. Depending on playstyle all of these are good in the right setting: Improved revenged is tested and even on a stun immune mob the talent "procs" and generates extra threat even thought you do not stun, it is also one of the most busted dungeon trash tanking talents out there, if anything.. try it out. Improved sunder armor helps a lot with building threat in rage starved situations both in dungeons and raids.  Improved Shield wall is great for progress raiding especially against bosses with enrage mechanics. 
---
You still get some things right though :)
---
i mean he lives in london with a dog and everything
---
I'm a simple man. I see The Office, I up vote
---
I actually like the cinematics and voice acting in retail WoW.
---
For me, the "perfect" version of WoW would be a mix of the quest "design" and world building of classic, and the voice acting, cinematic and overall storytelling "tools" that retail has to offer now.
---
There's a dirty joke in there, I just can't find it...
---
Indeed friend. But guess what, the hype is crazy now, just wait till people actually start playing and everyone will see and want 'in'.   
---
I predict on release day -  it'll be 3-4x more players than 'pre sub'.  Remember - pre-sub gets you a name and 10 days played :P

Bubble boy!
---
How do you know this?
---
You won't have to compete with people for quests thanks to layering. Hopefully. Atleast, that's how Blizzard says it will go.
---
Thanks for the advice, i'll try to share it there :)
---
I want phase 1 layering.  It's genius.
---
It’s been all over mmo-champion from blue post
---
I was late and didn't get onto Pagle, so I jumped onto Mankrik to see what a horde dominant server would be like as alliance.  Now it's filling up too.  Jeez.
---
The retail community asked for these things.  That's why retail is what it is and why those people still play.  
---
Now the communities should effectively split, and since we can see the past choices effects, we can make better choices.
---
No one can.
---
I havnt found any blue post where did you find this info ?
---
Those not use to the classic way's of playing - won't understand this.   
---
You may also have to type 'Hey'
---
There's a reason teachers usually take away points when someone gets the right answer, but the work is wrong.
---
would love to read an english version if it exists
---
Never heard of this movie.. it's called, "Napoleon Solo" ? Is it on Netflix?  I'm too lazy to check.
---
they can close low pop servers and let people transfer off for free
---
Came to say teh same thing. Out of my 6 friends coming back for classic I'm the only one who turned my sub on to reserve a name.
---
You dot the enemy up with Moonfire and Insect Swarm, use your feral forms for damage that doesn't cost mana and utility (Bash, Feral Charge, Dash...), and occasionally blast people with Starfire or Wrath.
---
Sounds like a lack of items/good itemization and some talents needing buffs or reworks.  All of that stuff would have to be very gradual and under extreme scrutiny.   I'm just saying we don't need every class being capable of everything like it is in retail.
---
From where did you get it?
---
I know 4 people that hard quit the game in Wrath that will be coming back that did not resub to save a name . It's going to be interesting to say the least.
---
I bet they'll be 1000's of layers per server. Don't worry the hype will die down.... :&lt;
---
[Fight club](https://discord.gg/mmVZFW) is the Classic warrior theorycraft discord. There is also the discord called [warrior calssic](https://discord.gg/rw87Pa) (mnore casual, less math). They all spring out from the Huge retail warrior community called Skyhold (focuses on retail wow, cant generate link but just search for it)
---
I have tactically booked Wed-Fri off knowing Tues gonna be a shitshow.
---
\*Laughs in Zandalar\*
---
Once thing to consider is that it was a test environment so they where testing different setups that may or may not be the exact ratio of population they are really aiming to set once it goes live to production. So no one besides WoW Classic team can really tell us for sure what amount of players per layer they are aiming for or how really crowded it's gonna feel.
---
Probably not to a woman that turns into a dragon as soon as the ring hits her finger.
---
Why would you need to ask for permission to change something above your own PC setup? This rooms mine, she can decorate the bedroom like she wants in exchange.
---
I’ll also be a few days late to start playing because I have to fuck my 5 wives (who are supermodels) on my yacht and I’ll only have satellite internet :(
---
I like the red flag from WoW more.
---
Well, i'm excited for boxing classic, but not for the same things.
---
Doing wpvp will be definitivly fun, but not on 5 to 1. I'm not saying i wont (well free HK, so in phase 2 red is dead except if your druid because "druid code"), but there is just no fun nucking stuff.
---
I'm excited to do stuff i'm actually not sure to be able to pull off, some of the end game dungeons, raids if we get enought fellow boxers ...
---
Multiboxing is like Backcountry skiing, it's one of the few area of the game when you can actually discover stuff or be the first (or the few) one to do something without following the steps of countless players who puts some youtube tutorials and in-deep guides.
---
Ofc the servers can handle it - they always could. They just want your monies. It doesn't cost a lot to run a server compared to their income.
---
Norway and Denmark are going on firemaw?
---
This... awesome, thank you for explaining !
---
not the servers
---
There will be as many layers as there needs to be, that's why Blizzard put it in
---
I legit thought for a moment that this was a cartridge for one of those cheap bootleg video game machines.
---
Lol, selling names wtf
---
You could try  [https://sixtyupgrades.com/](https://sixtyupgrades.com/). I've got an 'easy' target with nothing RNG or hard to farm (easy crafts and quest rewards), with various additional specs adding in dungeon drops etc - all the way up to raid BiS.
---
Bright screens are really bad for babies
---
PvP Servers for EU? No.
---
They’re going to need quite a few more. If they’re filling up just from people wanting to reserve names, imagine how many more people are gonna subscribe and get on WoW Classic when it launches!
---
You must be new here
---
My guild befriended a Chinese farmer and brought him into MC. He was a troll rogue that spent his days farming Satyrs in Azshara, with mostly green gear, and we couldn’t really communicate with him other than using rudimentary emotes. That’s about all I remember, but we had a lot of fun with him and he became a mascot of sorts. I want to say we got him a Perdition’s Blade but can’t say for sure.
---
Plot twist - he lives in Japan
---
Depends on the class.
---
As a Mage? No.
---
As a Warrior? Yes.
---
You forget the meeting point on top of the bank.
---
Classic fat cavill
---
Yes, those are BfA stats collected by crawling armory. Of course similar stats for Classic servers are not available, the best estimate you could have is to look at server status. But I don't see any reason why proportions of players in Classic will be significantly different from retail. So it should be a good approximation.
---
I hope you find reasons to keep on going &lt;3 Regardless of server and faction, we're all here for you! We're a family and the reunion happens the 27th!
---
Jack of all trade, master of none,  *but oftentimes better than a master of one.*
---
True. They don’t have instant heal or shield and requires cast time and are really subject ton interruptions... definitely priest/druids are better... and even pal in large battles
---
Exactly the same with me.

Can't tell, but great art!

Got a link to it? I'm very interested as this will be my first time playing wow and I'm looking for something very thorough and well thought out. Thanks.
---
we havent heard of him in a long time. 😂
---
I see blue, I like.
---
Oh, are we leveling with a pure PvE raiding build? Must be playing on a PvE server with no one to contest with!
---
Yeah, it was similar with me. At first, I refused to play Classic. Exping takes so long and who wants to wait till 40 to get mount?
---
Few months later, I was the most hyped guy from our group of friends hah.

Also, one of my friends went from "No way!" to "So, are we gonna roll horde?" in an hour.

Not really. Private servers are constantly relaunching. If you would look at some old private server, it won't be exactly healthy.
---
I like the voice acting and bells and whistle too but for the little I tried Legion it felt like it was only that and smashing the same button over and over. Probably because I gave up after the first intro 2 first levels.
---
It is crazy just how utterly pointless your comment is, even more pointless than a comment saying nothing other than “cool”.
---
Honestly impressive just how much of a useless comment you have posted here.

not sure about tabasco but sriracha on pizza is the shit

Ah, before Doctor Who went to shit.
---
Oooo good question. I'm wondering this as well.
---
Thanks! really keen to try druid for PVP in classic (in phase 3).
---
right I merely observed in my layer atleast it was infact crowded but not impossible to progress by any means. Also blizzard has stated atleast for the earlier test they had indeed lowered layer cpas significantly to test layer building. i Just dont think launch is going to as much of a cluster as people think(maybe on herod) but im much more concerned about p2 if falloff isn't as drastic as people/blizzard think.
---
Why would anyone downvote this? It’s so cool! I wish your friend was my friend! I want one of these!
---
This is partly false. Norway and i think Denmark too are going Firemaw. A pool would be a great tool to Get an overview of the real population, rather than listening to propaganda from all angles.

To streamline your answers:

Although technically, they can pay for 2 subs each, then it would work.

---
I think, while maybe somewhat true, this is mostly NOT the case with classic.  Classic is a vanity project that is held very close to the heart of many old players and I like to think we are capable of steering Classic into a very awesome version of Classic+ if given the chance.  
---
But yes, maybe after Naxx having harder raids that require AQ/Naxx gear to complete might be cool, but I also don't want straight up gear-check type raid content.  I want challenging bosses with mechanics that are almost half-ridiculous to a degree.  
---
&gt;As for level cap, I see issues once again for those willing to keep it "exactly as it was" as they could not experience their pvp the same way for exemple.   
---
Yeah, sadly people will probably be against anything that changes the "core" of the game, but I think allowing for even just 5 extra talent points could make for some very diverse builds.  I wouldn't mind if they tested it a year from now.  
---
Splitting the community is what we don't want.  Expansions would enable that to happen 100%.  Classic+ is basically free DLC to an already fun game(that could definitely use some tweaks but overall it's a really good "game").  I hope the community pushes really hard for Classic+, that would be an awesome timeline.
---
Kinda funny how people here claim that "raids won't take you".
---
I've raided every raid except Naxx in this spec.
---
Hotw Spec was pretty popular back then. And the Hotw-Spec was considered a viable healing-spec.
---
The more mana-efficient healing-styles use HT anyways and not Regrowth and Swiftmend. So for the most part you trade 10% base-heal against 20% max-mana and the ability to actually play a completely different role pretty decently.
---
You still have some cool tools that other healers don't have: Brezz, Innervate, Tranquility and NS+HT as super strong Oh-Shit-Button on a relatively short CD.
---
A lot of people who roll druid pick the class for it's versatility and not to be a pure healer with fewer tools than priest. And hotw-spec is prettymuch the epitome of versatility.
---
Especially in smaller raids like ZG and AQ20 and guilds someone who can be used for different purposes is a great asset.
---
I personally intend on using a 25-0-26 Moonglow-Spec with OoC for maximum utility and mana-efficiency. But I totally wouldn't mind a Hotw-druid.
---
Say it with me now!

ah my bad, just went on the site and saw it, i'll take the post down
---
Of course we know. A) some of us were druid tanks in vanilla. B) If you have to use private server for comparison, parry was 5%. Classic is 14%. So parry will be 1.8x more. MATHS!  Note: for those of us who are properly cynical, we note that while this is a not insignificant difference in threat generation (although parry refunds rage, so there's that), as far as generating swing resets, the difference between private server and classic is less than teaching *just one goddamned rogue to stop attacking from the front!* Achem. Apologies.
---
Druid at 60 is already confirmed similar between versions, and we veteran druids already know where druids were in Vanilla if only by what was fixed and refined in TBC: druids lose to warriors by 10% against magic effects thanks to defensive stance; eat crits/crushes; lack oh shit buttons; and win at effective health, although the difference between the two aren't as appreciable in Classic in this regard, so mitigation has more of an edge than it had in TBC. However, since overheal is more of a concern in vanilla, some of that spikiness is mitigated by the nature of healing. They have the advantage that 1.12 itemization was hella better than early vanilla for druids, so even though they don't scale as well as warriors, they'll be starting stronk, and as warriors overtake them in main tanking, a feral/HotW druid is way more valuable than a thumb twirling prot OT.
---
My fear of being stranded on a dead server in 6 months outweighs my fear of long shazzrah launch queues
---
thanks i'll update it
---
Tool Tips Not showing up. maps Broken. /s lol  :P
---
Some say they are, others are saying they are staying on their current server... No way to know..
---
I’ll be just logging in around midnight EST, possibly earlier, so I’m expecting a decent amount to be logged off from queue frustration.
---
You can still log in and play off the blue now and then, you don't have to wait for a full bar. I'm leveling a resto/boomy on the side so that's what I'll be doing.
---
It would work for your own cast bar. But for target cast bars, it would need adjustments. And it could never be accurate. What that means is that it could guess the duration of the cast from the combat log based on spell names. But as no spell ranks are provided in the combat log, you would have to guess. Or always use the highest rank.
---
Q: I’ve collected a ton of mounts, pets, titles, toys and transmog gear over the years in World of Warcraft. Can I use them in WoW Classic?
---
A: No, you won’t be able to access any of the items in your World of Warcraft Collections tab when you’re playing WoW Classic.

Will be slightly less inconvenient if his friend goes dwarf.
---
TBC almost had me quit WoW. Sounds weird, right?
---
Well... back in Vanilla I was in love with the world, the lore, the story. I was a big fan of the RTS games and a roleplayer at heart. TBC caused a huge outcry in the roleplaying community, I remember. Because it retconnec and rewrote a lot of the story that we had all come to love from the RTS games. Suddenly these evil "demons" we knew as Eredar weren't so super evil anymore. They were called "Draenei" now and a playable race for Alliance. And only part of them had become evil demons while the rest of them had stayed good. It's hard to imagine nowadays how that felt back in the day. You have to consider that nobody ever had heard of "Draenei" before TBC, only thing we knew was Archimonde, Kil'jaeden and evil Eredar.
---
Then the whole setting of outland with it's spacey sci-fi graphics, glowing lazer beams, giant robots walking around, floating islands and all that other alien shit was so extremely different from the "Classic Fantasy World" that I was used to from the RTS games and Vanilla. I felt like I was playing a totally different game.
---
If I had been big into raiding and PvP back then, I would probably have loved TBC. But as mainly a roleplayer and lover of fantasy, I was simply disgusted by this new lore and all that lazer beam shit and glowing crystal stuff and that one dude is swinging an axe around that has floating bits and pieces on it. Just didn't feel like Warcraft to me anymore.
---
Higher ranks of Hamstring improve the slow, so it's very important to take those. Cleave I agree, the whole point is just to hit the next target, dumping gold on 4 extra damage isn't worth when you're saving for a mount, I pretty much stop buying Heroic Strike myself around 20-ish
---
wouldnt lvl 20 require like 8hours of playtime? i fully expect not get that much in, unless i turn into a nocturnal being and play during the night, when i suspect that queues to be shorter.
---
Points invested into aoe talents will be wasted points. UNLESS you are a total no lifer and are the first into all the new areas. Otherwise you will be single targeting mobs. All this is just my take on what I see happening. But I have given it some thought as I am also rolling a happy mage. Happy because he has the same name as he had in vanilla. :)
---
yeah and horde kill the last boss 1st except BWL. Technically horde cleared the raid 1st before alliance majority of the time.
---
Yeah, getting high rank is also a competition with other members of your faction. There is a way around it (to agree with others on a number of HK and stay at it) but that seems really hard especially on a big server
---
Yes, that would be so nice!
---
Now that I remember it started with a rotation of 2 button smashing, then I took a point in that abomination that replaced the talent tree and it __removed__ one of my two buttons WTF! It then was single button smashing until the end of the tutorial, I was afraid they where gonna take away my last button so I quit while I was still ahead lol :)
---
Reroll on one of the other servers or risk queues. It's still full because it's very unlikely people deleted their chars on herod after creating them on the new ones.
---
I do not know so I left it out ;) (but don't worry you have 2 rotations, if one doesn't work there is the other one
---
Oh ya, I took a break 'cause I got really burned out so I had like a 5-6 month gap or something between videos :D
---
You plan on doing one for Warlock?
---
levels 10-20 says "frontstab" is probably why he brought it up :P

Twas' But a Scratch. US, Alliance, Herod PvP Server, CST/EST based guild/community.
---
* We plan on starting out as a leveling guild with a heavy emphasis on enoying not only endgame content, but the adventure of leveling to 60 that Classic brings.
---
* We will likely raid with a somewhat casual schedule (1-2x week, likely 2-3 hrs).  That said, nothing is set in stone. If there's an interest for a hardcore or super casual group to form, the guild leadership will help facilitate that to the best of their ability.
---
* We're not just a WoW guild, but a community that plays many different games. WoW (Retail &amp; Classic) is certainly the focus, but we have dedicated groups to tabletop games, Destiny 2, LoL &amp; all kinds of shit.
---
* We don't really have a whole grandstand-ie plan or vision for the community beyond being a comfortable gathering place for people to hang out and have fun playing games together.
---
* Raid times &amp; loot structure will be negotiable once the dust settles &amp; things normalize a bit.
---
* For the most part, members are between the ages of 25-40. 
---

&gt;I agree that the system is far from perfect and could be changed for the better

Did you even read my comment? I'm saying calling Blizzard "immoral" for not changing something is a rediculous argument. There is no chance in hell that they haven't looked at it and agreed it's broken, but at the risk of triggering thousands of #nochanges they've opted to leave as is for now.
---
How is this shitting up ohter people's servers if you have an alt on a low-medium populated server? Isn't it helping that server?
---
theyre still good after that. i distinctly remember doing 750 dps on maexxna one day (yes, with the annoying stun) without using crowd pummelers
---
at that point in the game, if you can do that much dps on your own power and calculate the damage from faerie fire and the crit aura, youre basically the melee version of the mage with ignite: doing a shitload of damage, except it was the result of a team effort. since it doesnt get applied to YOUR meter row, everybody seems to believe the melee just somehow did usually great that night
---
The stress test wasn’t bad at all. The “dynamic spawning” helped make it not a living hell. I tested elwynn and Durotar and I got out of the starting zone in no time (with quest addons tho)

haha i meant how many mobs they can take on :) i've seen groups with 20+ warriors that delete bosses in a few seconds, warriors are insane when they get geared, but the leveling proces... oof! It's gonna be tough.

It's almost like forcing all the players that are unlikely to give up at level 20 onto a couple of servers is a bad idea!

hunter aswell plz
---
That’s true, definitely not very often does a mob have that little health before the final swing.
---
Hunter Next!
---
Sure, but the topic is "leveling completely on rested XP" so the absolute minimum you'd have to play if the 10days/bar rule is true is nearly 2 full real-time months of waiting plus, what, 70+ hours of actual game time in between? Certainly works, as long as you're not in a rush.
---
dont forget the new macro API will likely allow us to effortlessly perform perfect powershifts in cat and perfectly pot/barkskin as bears
---
This week, and next week. They will prob add some after launch, when the players that waited until the 26/27th resub.
---
Keep notes on players that you come across like 'Great DPS', 'Ninjas Loot', 'Is an asshole'. While leveling there will be other players that have a similar leveling speed as you and log in on a similar schedule to you, so you will come across them frequently from lvl 1-60. It's really handy to remember who you've had friendly interactions with and tagged a Quest NPC but wouldn't group up, then /spit and ran away.
---
Invest in bags ASAP. They are a big expense at the beginning of the game, but without them you either waste money having to drop things, or time by having to keep running back into time to vendor items. And time is money!
---
Don't feed the trolls. For every edgelord mouthing off in General Chat there's 20 normal players rolling their eyes and going about their business without responding.
---
Don't be a dick. Reputation matters. If you ninja loot, go AFK in dungeons, mouth off in general chat, people will remember who you are and will avoid you in future. You may even find yourselves kicked from your guild who don't want you bringing down their server rep.

Didn't they remove the name generator? My last memory of it is from cata when it helpfully named my worgen Amoramor.

There's more than one R14 per server though. Pretty sure they changed that in vanilla.

---
Don't.
---
Um... I've forgotten what I wanted to say...
---
Sweeds going gehennas ye not norway/denmark
---
It depends on how many other bgs everyone else is doing. It's all relative. There isn't done arbitrary cp threshold that rewards everyone who crosses it.
---
If literally everyone else is doing 16hrs of pvp a day, you're not going to rise very far. Especially because everyone starts at the bottom and can only rise so much every week so they'll be at it for a long time.
---
There are going to be a lot of try harder gunning for rank 14. A lot will give up along the way, so competition will ease up. And eventually some start getting their r14 and immediately take a long break from it. Next up chills out when they get it. And so on, hypothetically reading the competition. But the competition never really truly dies out. You'll rise to somewhere in the middle, and that's just you.
---
That being said, a solid and consistent effort should yield you the mid tier grear. It's definitely a non linear pyramid and there's a lot of room at the bottom to middle. Makes it quite reasonable to achieve especially considering a lot of people realize how impossible top tier is to get along the way and become satisfied with the mid tier and hop off then.

Morihalda's version indeed is loads better.

---
Definitely just playing as I want to. Only thing I have looked up is how certain talents work if they aren't absolutely clear to me. I just want to have fun and enjoy the game.
---
Well imo german is not an easy language to learn. Grammar really sucks and in most other languages there is no courtesy form (not even sure if I can translate it that way). But to be clear, in english there is only a "you", and it doesnt matter if this is a person you know or your chef. In german it matters how to adress a person. If you know them it's "Du", if you don't it's "Sie".
---
I.... never said this. I don’t know why you’re downvoting me. That was taken straight from the forums in a blue post where they warned if people didn’t reroll off Herod, they’d face queues.
---
Sup man, I played Vanilla. If you are just having fun with the boys and ganking some horde/allies for a few hours a day and throw in a few BG's you will rank up and make it to a middle rank quite comfortably. That will get you access to the PvP trinket and a bunch of other PvP faction specific gear.
---
True. But would be a nice side job for a month or two per year.

Honestly I'm not sure if it's a confirmed new thing from blizz or just one of the things private servers got wrong that was already that way in vanilla. IIRC it's about 25% more bonus experience for killing elites in dungeons and the elites are also a lot easier than private servers/people's memory.  Killing an elite in a dungeon with five people gives about the same as you killing a normal mob by yourself now.  Dungeon grinding is going to be the new hotness at launch. Tons of people are looking for melee cleave groups to speed through.
---
&gt;One can tell that you put time into this and I like your approach. Regarding the Deep prot spec I am concerned by you taking Tactical Mastery up to a point to then discard Anger management completely.
---
Because Tactical Mastery offers incredible quality of life value, while AM is a far more marginal talent. I mention it in my explanations as "If you like this talent, change these around and take it" but it's definitely nothing major.
---
&gt;Demo shout is my personal favorite tbh, its damage reduction and mitigation has just been proved to be that much efficient. It's a my personal favorite as it's a roundabout very good talent so I'd drop 4 points in that every day 
---
Demo shout is good, but I can't think of any reason another Warrior can't be putting it up with 5/5 Imp Demo shout. And I wouldn't value any of Revenge, HS, or Sunder as worth any amount of talent points. That's minor rage savings on abilities at a time when 99% of the time you're gonna be flooded with more rage than you can use.
---
&gt;Edit : Just wanted to say also, Anger Management isn't marginal, it is purely linear, the tooltip is wrong and it gives you flat +1 rage every 3 seconds while in combat on top of the 30% reduction of rage decaying time OOC.
---
Which is incredibly marginal. Plus one rage every three seconds will rarely do anything to help in any realistic situation. Prot doesn't need or want it, Fury doesn't need or want it, so it's only for general purpose or PvP specs, which makes it even more marginal. If it's something you value, then like I said, go ahead and take it, it's only one point, but it's not something I'd go out of my way for.
---
Ok but can anyone tell me if he got the rock up or not?

"bosses will be putting out far more damage"
---
do you not remember the years where a ton of servers were all on the same core and had naxx bosses that were using literal WOTLK damage values?
---
id love to see blizzard even try to pull that. druid threat will remain mostly the same. warrior threat is the one that is kinda getting gutted. fury/prot tanks getting blown out by the confirmed parry rate since dual wield tanking would just force the boss to be parry hastened 24/7. also, it seems that you cannot use /sit to force enrage procs as a warrior anymore
---
Curse of recklessness is important as heck yo.  You can save a dungeon group by making sure some chump doesnt run away and aggro a whole mess of other crusty chumps.  GET THAT CURSE
---
I'll see y'all there!
---
Can confirm. The community is divided a bit. The official message on the Norwegian discord is that we are migrating to Firemaw. Many disagree and are staying on Shazz and some are going with the swedes to Golemagg. The danish are claiming Firemaw as well.

That’s an amazing list. Thanks for sharing :)

This looks promising.
---
I am still an advocate for new content, in regards to catchup there is no real need to trivialise early raids too much, personaly for 'catchup' i'd...
---
\- Add in a blue dungeon set that is close to BWL levels (make sure players need to work to get this)  
---
\- Add a NAXX 20 option
---
This way players still need to do ZG, AQ and NAXX as 20man but can skip MC completly and possibly BWL\\ZG.  Ultimatly they cannot skip to endgame raiding at soon as they ding 60 they still need to put in the work.
---
Though I think blizz will ultimatly go the TBC route, as it's the easiest and will cause the least drama.

How accurate you think the Census is ?  
---
How many people will stick to their originally picked class.  
---
The data is no where near accurate.  
---
And only time will tell
---
yeah i thanks that fear is a great part of the game that adds depth, like souls and dolls in diablo 2 spice up things, very rewarding if you can get away or win a fight
---
He made the announcement for classic did he not?
---
It's a right of passage. Level 50-60 took a long time and all those AV quests helped you a lot. It was great feeling like you were contributing to the war effort for your level 60's
---
Not sure. I made this one because someone in my guild ask for it and gave me the materials to do it ;)
---
Thanks, I forgot I hadn't finished reading the manual!
---
Was looking for an english version but unfortunately i cant find any.  
---
I was hoping that one of our redditors knows more or even has a english version.
---
Did he drop any good loot?
---
When you say Blizz-like do you mean "2006-like"? Because that's not true. Classic is going to have way more than the 3.5k concurrent or whatever it was back then, it was purely a technical limitation, the world can handle twice that amount easily at least. Unless you can provide a source, I think you've mistaken what they meant when they said that each LAYER holds the same as a 2006 server. That doesn't mean they're only going to let 3.5k people in at a time after layering's turned off.
---
`/e spits on you`
---
only macro you need
---
You stood on the hill so Archimondes flames wouldn't burn you right? Be honest :p
---
isnt there an addon that shows icons similar to or these exact ones in their location?
---
Being the first to level 40 with a mount will be your best bet of winning that one. Or being the first to 60 with an epic mount, though that is unlikely.
---
You could have that in the beginning :) I think it was beta only :)
---
It's a huge help, but no you won't be useless without. You'll never win a equal matchup to someone with engineering, but you don't get many equal matchups in vanilla.
---
Great idea
---
Engineering is bis for pve too
---
Thanks. This is Better Than the original i listen to daily...
---
Cause kids
---
If you want tbc go play tbc
---
Account sharing is how a lot of people got there. I ranked to about 11/12 in groups where people were sharing and working together.
---
I’m going Feral DPS with Tank capabilities but i’ll go healer later down the line if Feral falls off too hard.
---
I enjoy the “bring me 20 bear arses” quests. Theyre soothing.
---
Gotta stop in Barrens if you're going to Stonetalon, but yes it's possible. Desolace is kind of a pain in the ass because mobs don't care about paths and will kill you pretty frequently. Safer to go to 1k Needles honestly.
---
OK... My english is bad... Sorry...
---
I meant : It is here because I was not sure it was not a thing in classic.
---
Engineering yields significant advantage in PVP for sure. Stuns, CC and extra damage. But also for PVE. It's also quite the gold sink, and may not be worth it if you're a casual.
---
too bad it has to be burned, FOR THE HORDE!!
---
Yes, the whole concept of a new continent in each expansion makes the old high level zones fall away due to being far away from the new content where you progress your character, this results in the old zones becoming dead aside from leveling characters. And let's not start about flying mounts, they should've never been implemented.
---
If the classic servers ever move on to any expansions I hope that the community invites or even demands changes, mainly just removing flying mounts (and then the dev team have to change parts of the world to work with only ground mounts)
---
It's not at all about the money. My name is either going to be my usual generic fantasy name that I got from an online generator like 18 years ago (99% chance it's not taken on any server when I sub on the 27th) or it will be some random shit made up on the spot, like my every alt in every online game.
---
In the end as long as my name is not bad enough to prevent me from getting group invites, I don't care. There's just no purpose in early subbing for me
---
It is almost as if the community is going to spread out throughout all the servers despite nationalities because it's just the natural way. my oh my
---
&gt; ...because the thought of 5-man tanking on a War when your group outgears the instance is what’s keeping me from rolling War again. I just want to Consecrate and run around.
---
They can tank AQ and Naxx, its all a matter of how much effort you put into it to make it work.
---
The art is really great! Time to learn german ;)
---
Any mailbox will do!
---
Thanks for the fast answer. But Can you acces stone talon from the South from Mulgore (Thunderbluff) im basically asking since i want to Level as Undead and at the right Point Swap continents to then run Stone Talon &gt; Desolace &gt; Feralas...  Since im Mage i thought about what the fastest way is to get there ... so i thought i port to Thunderbluff and go up through the Stone Talon Pass &gt; but i don´t know if it exists in classic...
---
That's a lot of money for a period in my life where I will only be wearing tighty whities with cheetos stains.
---
demonic rune
---
I did take a vacation because of classic wow for the coming 2 weeks.  
---
I'm not really worried about it. Layering should help in the beginning. And my internet connection is stable enough not to worry about DC's. We'll see how it goes!
---
Not gonna fool me
---
Interesting
---
Questie
---
there's a few mobs that give steamwheedle rep that don't drop your bloodsail rep
---
Thanks dad.
---
Draenei (or a form of them) existed in Warcraft 3, and so did a lot of that tech in TBC.
---
I worry about AV, the vanilla magic of it was unfortunately lost before BC. The moment it changed enough to ignore the other faction and just race and it became pve pug raid content it was over.
---
Coming back to vanilla, to me, means coming back to the magic of true hard mode pvp stand still AV. But that's not possible. And not what 1.12 is about.
---
No, even if he felt 100% wrong for saying it and guilty for belittling that dude in front of millions Activision Blizzard would never allow him to publicly apologize, that's normal corporate behavior. The best we can hope for is a little self deprecating humor like with Todd Howard (who I fucking hate and have long before Fallout 76) with "oh you guys still here?".           
---
          
---
His Vanilla flavor comment is the closest you'll ever hear to an apology.
---
"A few minutes daily" haha are you normally this dramatic?
---
I doubt vanilla wow was something to disappear overnight. Of course, for some purists it's the case, but not for me, fortunately.
---
You won't be useless, but you're intentionally putting yourself at a disadvantage if you don't.
---
Ok yeah if i need to go through Barrens anyways id prolly prefer Needles over the outroute ... thanks mate :)
---
Great map! Just one other suggestion, the building to the left of the AH does repairs / sells bullets for hunters etc. Thanks for putting it together :)
---
Dont know what server you played on but on the popular ones that hasnt been the case
---
LOL!
---
The best mage guide... ever made haha
---
That's gorgeous. Way better than the absolute bollocks on Etsy.
---
I would roll a Tauren Rogue if I could.
---
I agree on the motorcycles but flying machines have been in the game since WCII so that wasn't really out of place.
---
How fast is your friend expecting to get to 60?
---
Or viper stinging hunters who never get inside your range, Or SL locks who mana drain you
---
less important for some classes/specs but generally yes if you want to play at high level against the rankers.
---
feral druid and spriest probably have the least use for it, but can still benefit. That said its hard for a feral to not pick up BS for the fear immunity trinket. 
---
but think about a rogue or mage having all the control they need built in plus a mind control helmet and rocket boots not to mention higher burst from grenades. There is more but those paint a good picture for how powerful it makes classes. ~~depending on your role~~ in PVE its also very useful for cooridinated cd's and grenades.

 **🔷🔷 &lt;ASCENDANCE&gt;🔷🔷** **EU | Alliance | PvP | Shazzrah** 
---
**Region**: Europe
---
**Faction**: Alliance
---
**Server**: Shazzrah - PvP
---
**Raid schedule**: Tuesday &amp; Sunday 20:00 – 24:00 CEST
---
**Loot rules**: DKP
---
**About us:**
---
We are a group of vanilla veterans that have many years of experience raiding who are eager to return to the classic days. You can rest assured; we expect to farm Onyxia, Ragnaros and Nefarian yet again.
---
As the guild recruitment market is saturated with semi-hardcore and hardcore guilds. We aim to reach the more balanced segment, somewhere between casual and semi-hardcore. We do not expect any world first kills nor do we intend to reach the sky on damage parses. We do however take our raiding seriously and do not intend to accept continuous wipe nights due to someone not committed to studying the tactics required. As such, we are looking for people who are passionate and willing to help securing the guilds success.
---
In addition, some of our members have a lot of PvP experience both from vanilla and in later expansions, achieving high PvP ranks and 2200 arena ratings. This also means that, apart from raiding, most will also have a healthy interest in PvP and as such, if you have an interest, you will find plenty of guildies to share it with.
---
**Raid Roster needs:**
---
* Druids: *Backup\**
---
* Hunters: *Backup\**
---
* Mages: *Backup\**
---
* Paladins: *Backup\**
---
* Priest: *Backup\**
---
* Rogues: *Backup\**
---
* Warlocks: *Backup\**
---
* Warriors: *Backup\**
---
***\*Backup***
---
We currently have our 40-man roster full and a few backups. However, we have experienced significant changes across the months we had in the guild already. Not to mention, we expect drop-offs while leveling. So, roster changes are bound to happen.
---
**What we expect**:
---
* You to play your class well and have knowledge of the various boss / trash mechanics.
---
* High raid attendance.
---
* Be on time for raids (at raid location at/before scheduled time) \[DKP on time bonus\]
---
* Positive outlook and a friendly behavior towards your fellow guildie.
---
**What we do not expect**:
---
* We do not expect our members to spend exuberant amount of hours on world buffs or consumables before every raid, but we do expect people to be prepared with what would be considered reasonable. (e.g. Healing Potions, Mana Potions, fire protection potions, bandages, soul shards, Symbols of divinity, arrows etc.).
---
* That you play the perfect raid spec down to the last point. This means that we do not expect SM Ruin warlocks to respec if there is not enough debuff slots for corruption. We do not expect every hunter to have true shot aura if your PvP activities require you to have scatter/intim. We do, however, not allow specs that break the debuff limit. This means we do not allow warriors to have deep wounds for example. (For a more case-to-case example, ask an officer or GM).
---
**What our progression roadmap looks like**:
---
* Leveling (Launch + 4 – 6 weeks)
---
* Attunements (Week 6-7)
---
* Onyxia &amp; Molten Core (Week 8)
---
* ZG, BWL, AQ, Naxx (TBD)
---
We are well aware, that we are ambitious when it comes to the roadmap. We do however think it’s important to clarify what our dream scenario is. Naturally, we need a certain amount of people before we can start raiding and as there are some uncertainties when it comes to experience gain, the roadmap might be subject to change/postpone. We will however start raiding as soon as member count allows it.

---
Missing all kinds of reputations.......
---
Im not happy
---
My pserver experience as a priest and mage was that it was easier to get into groups as mage, possibly both due to mages being wanted in dungeons and an abundance of healers at 60.
---
Ok mb, mighty impressive then !
---
Does anybody have one like this about what spells to down rank for healing priests??
---
What? Hamstring lets you hit-kite.
---
I'd go mage.
---
As ZG Comes out you can guy the Bloodvine set which will boost you a bit more. You can get some other good pieces of gear later on - they are expensive but don't require raiding.
---
Also Mages always do fine in PVP because they are mages.
---
Don't forget the roof of the bank!
---
way too much risk and too little reward, also the novelty would wear off incredibly fast
---
They have said there is still gonna be a maximum player count on the server. They announced that herod would have 10k+ ques
---
Try that with an actual kid and not a baby..
---
&gt; retail players who reserved a name just because they could and might use it
---
That's a key argument.   
---
I personally know a few people who play retail and reserved their names on Classic "just in case they'll want to play in the future".
---
Nobbel and Preach.
---
Not sure about Preach's community, but Nobbel is a really nice guy (and Dutch!). I can't imagine his community being that fanboy-y or toxic.
---
This is brilliant, well done!
---
“My names Henry Cavill and I’m a paladin. *pans over to human paladin with superman looking gear* I use my divine powers to protect all of Azeroth and its people....”
---
oh do you not swap out of form to consume pots in classic?? In Vanilla I remember you did.
---
Yes, shapeshifting removes slows and roots...
---
well yes
---
Only horde? Feel like the server is gonna be 70% horde at this rate.
---
What do they do when they are not tanking though?
---
Like a warrior can be at the top of the meters and without respecting tank the next pull no issue.
---
I’m aware that they meant each layer was meant to hold a realm’s worth of players. I’m basing it off of earlier sources saying we’d get blizz-like server caps *post* layering.
---
If I’m wrong about eventual realm caps, I’ll be the first to admit I am. They *have* said they will not raise caps higher than the 2006 levels, even though they can. (Source: https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/overcrowded-realm-update/255835).
---
So I don’t think I’m wrong to assume they mean to keep Vanilla blizz-like caps -meaning no megaservers like pservers are.
---
Always afk at 4:20
---
Ah! These are amazing, great job! Makes me pumped for next week!
---
Pserver community has proven that after 15years the community was still happy with classic without any extra content.  
---
So i wont say no immediately to extra Content, but i say lats wait for 3 years and then decide.
---
That's my case. Thank you!!
---
It's still six fucking kinds of arbitrary to draw the line somewhere like that. "But it was in WC so it's k" is such a weak explanation.
---
Nice try
---
Yeah but like denmark and norway arent even half of the swedish community and we already have kartelli
---
:D Queues can be bad. They don't have to be. And even if they are you can still Play a lot of hours daily.
---
But you are right. If you are not in a rush then why not just delay it a bit? 
---
I just want to Play though. I can't wait :P
---
My step-dad died at the start of the year and he was hanging out for release. Its not going to be the same without him.
---
Some people will want TBC, but I think most will want Classic+.  
---
TBC will introduce a lot of bad shit, and also split the community.  As cool as nostalgia is, I want to experience a different timeline within Classic, and expand the world to a degree that fits the game and doesn't take from the "classic experience" in any way.
---
pick another server
---
Cleave functions the same way as Heroic Strike, in that it turns your next melee swing into an 'ability', so you get 0 rage from it. It's beneficial because you can pull 2 mobs and cleavespam to effectively double your auto damage for that pull, but you have to do a normal pull with minimal rage expenditure to recharge between Cleavepulls.
---
thank you! :)
---
Well, then I hope this post gets their attention.  
---
It'll take a few days to get enough people to take the poll to have some sort of reliable data set, and we only have a week to go.
---
She looks fed up of waiting.
---
I mostly agree except that it absolutely worked for Outland. Outland was an alien world shattered by massive energies, floating rocks and streams of mana in the sky fit it perfectly and contrasted really well with Azeroth.
---
The way that parry haste works is that whenever a boss parrys you the boss's  next swing is about 40% faster. In a 300 second fight against a boss with a swing timer of 2.5 seconds you will be hit 120 times, which means you will be crushed on average 18 times. 
---
A bear druid with MCPs has a swing timer of 1.66, meaning in that same fight you will hit about 180 times and on average will be parried about 25 times. 
---
This means that the boss will swing about 10 more times, bringing the total amount of times you are hit to 130 and the average amount of crushing blows from 18 to either 19 or 20. Therefore, the difference between 9% parry on private servers and 14% parry on Classic is about 1or 2 crushing blows on extremely long fights, which is pretty much meaningless. However, since most fights are unlikely to last more than 2 or 3 minutes the amount of times you are crushed at 9% parry and 14% parry are extremely likely to be the same.
---
TLDR: The most significant thing about the 14% parry difference is it increases the chance you have your first maul parried and your initial threat sucks.
---
You think you do
---
Do what you want and just have fun. In most situations it isn't going to have an effect as the other person isn't likely to have it either. For the most part only the more hardcore players are going to both have it and know what to do with it and at that point they are likely to be better at PvP anyway.
---
WOTLK was where WoW peaked in my opinion. I've never had as much fun as I did playing that expansion. Plus, having grown up playing wc3 and tft, WOTLK was a nostalgia trip in its own way.
---
I sold my account for $350 and left a week before TBC launched because the changes (obvious and subtle) all spelled doom to me.
---
I won't stick around for another no changes TBC. Flying mounts are cancer (but the content is designed around them). No changes means the same dungeon finder, cross realm shit, and weird class changes that we all recognize as the wing direction today.
---
They need to do 'new' vanilla content without messing with many of the systems, or just go straight WOW2 using vanilla as the template rather than retail; a challenge, a world, less trophies than there are players.
---

Wir suchen noch einen Nolifer für unsere Melee-Cleave-Gruppe (Derzeit Warrior, Rogue, Shaman, Shaman), der zumindest die erste Woche nach Launch keine anderen Verpflichtungen hat und vorhat, Hardcore zu spielen. (Erster Tag wird von Mitternacht bis mindesten Level 20 gespielt evtl länger)  
---
Schlafpausen werden 8 Stunden betragen.
---
Klasse: Warrior, Rogue, Shaman, Priest (andere Klassen theoretisch möglich, wenn auch nicht optimal, probiers einfach)
---
Grundlegenedes Spielwissen sollte natürlich vorhanden sein.

---
A fresh level 60 probably won't have the money for a flying mount. At least a level 50 vs a level 60 you're both on the ground and they can't just hover over you.
---
Every raid group needs a couple warlocks too! =P
---
Fuck to be retired when Classic comes out would be amazing./

good point ... hmm
---
Not unless the servers start breaking. It hasn’t worked in the beta or stress tests
---
That's a waste of laundry, I just play naked
---
In vanilla people played Alliance because they wanted Good vs Bad(Orcs)
---
Today when people go back they are gonna look at strongest racials for PvE/PvP usually.  That + people are used to horde means they will have majority.
---
Also shamans are very popular.
---
We went to Outland to kill the demons that came from the portal in the pre tbc event. Upon arriving in outlands, we got involved in the story there.
---
1. Nope, sub cost only. Boxed copy is useless, it's running on the new client, just download [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) launcher and install Classic.
---
2. You'll be able to either log into your old account or hopefully get Blizzard to help you recover it if you can't remember the details.
---
3. There'll be vets on every server, don't worry about that. 
---
4. It's the version of the game that existed in 2006 before the TBC pre-patch. They'll be slowly releasing the raids and BGs over time.
---
5. Thankfully, no. Original races/classes only.
---
Do we need to remember it every month though ?

---
I'm tired, so I'll just give you the short answers. I can go into detail later, if you need.
---
Excellent! I really appreciate the feedback, I am learning so much in this thread!
---
So "end" works for both do loops and if statements?
---
Can you recommend any literature for writing macros?
---
I'll probably do SW , IF if I'm motivated, but since I'm rolling horde I'll do UC first
---
I'd love to know solid information but I'd never put any stock into the polls I've seen on reddit or any of the forums. I still look at them, but I hardly believe a damned thing.
---
Hope he plays classic. Need episode 2
---
This is the only rep grind I did back in the day. I was the only bloodsail Buccaneer on Lightbringer EU, my one achievement.
---
Is it not 23:00 on the 26th for Ireland?
---
 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
The Paladin Epic mount quest.
---
Or the Warlock Doom Guard quest where you have to sacrifice a friend.
---
I love how the same guys said "these swedes dont speak in behalf of scandinavian coalition". Literally the next day "speaks for the whole country".
---
Any cheat sheets for tanking :)?
---
Many choose Gehennas
---
Why?
---
&gt;3) I need a PvP server, I don't suppose there is one focused on older players from the original game is there? -I'm not that worried, because I doubt Gen Z'ers will stick around in Classic for long if it really is as grindy as Original.
---
There are multiple RP servers....if you're super concerned about being with older players, that's where alot of us are going to be...we like people typing full sentences.
---
I'm just looking forward to professions that are meaningful.
---
Dafuq. That one isn't better at all
---
I bet you're a baby face.
---
Why didn't we jump on Gehennes with the Swedes then? They haven't fleshed out the reason for this sudden change, that's what is bothering me
---
Are two swords on top right weapon skill trainer?
---
I may have just missed it, but I don’t see a Druid trainer. Do Druids have to go to Thunder Bluff?
---
Hrm, I don't see an actual way to switch between Retail and Classic inside the twitch client.  
---
I'll just do it manually if it won't show.  
---
Macro is impossible, Blizzard intentionally limited this in Classic.
---
Addon I'm not sure about but it sounds very similar in functionality to the macro so I guess not?
---
I always loved that place with a good group! Looking firward to the hammer quest line as well!
---
Hope you right.  My (humanities) program is looking pretty weighty from the get.  But I *will* need short breaks while reading, which I'm sure will somehow turn into multi-hour "breaks," lol.
---
Team Solo Mid, or TSM, is a professional esports franchise with teams in many different games.
---
yes indeed :(
---
I am assuming you are talking about Skarm Tank's 0/30/21 feral/resto druid spec. A lot of that build is based on certain assumptions about raid organization and his place in the raid. Not getting Leader of the Pack as the capstone of Feral is based on other druids being there to give access to it or just not caring about access to that additional raid DPS. Not needing improved GotW because dedicated resto druids will handle it.
---
The real loss comes from not going 11 into balance. Missing Natural Weapons is losing out on 10% damage and missing Omen of Clarity which gives you free casts of your abilities. This is where a lot of your points would have gone as a dedicated feral tank. +4% armor loss or the 10 free instant rage from Improved Enrage that you miss.
---
As a healer, it misses out on too much to be a dedicated healer. On top of all of this, you would need 2 sets of gear, as he mentions in his AQ40 video showing off the spec.
---
Its viability at dungeons is probably fine. Especially as a tank, I wouldn't expect issues. Losing LotP only matters if you have a melee heavy DPS team. With healing, you might have some issues, especially if the tank is under-geared because it misses a lot of critical healing talents that a dedicated healer would have, but it would probably be fine too.
---
In raids, it's going to depend. At first, it will probably be unacceptable. I would expect that a lot of guilds and raids will want dedicated builds, especially while gear is limited and the need for efficiency is higher. Usually, there are only a few slots in a raid for druids as it is. If you are working yourself into a tank/OT slot you will want to be able to prove that you can do that to the best of your ability. Same if you want to be a healer or DPS. You don't want to be half-assed and tell them you can do both when you are a random nobody or when no one has the gear to handle being two things at once effectively. 
---
Beyond all of this, Skarm is a person who has been doing this for years and has a reputation behind him to back it up, and on top of that, he has years of gearing and dedication behind him. He isn't off-healing with jank gear as a fresh 60, but with tier pieces and bis gear that he got when no resto druid wanted it after months of raiding as a dedicated feral. His raid has enough gear that they don't need the DPS that the 3% crit LotP provides and he has enough skill and gear as a tank to not need the 11 points in balance. His benefit as a side-healer is purely based on the need of the raid/guild.
---
So, your results will vary. It'll probably be fine while leveling and gearing pre-raid and I plan to roll a druid with a similar skill setup for leveling and gearing. I wouldn't expect to keep it while raiding, however. At least, not at first, and not if you aren't involved with your guild. Getting the okay for that build from your raid leader will depend on your relationship with them, your skill level, your gear as well as the gear and skill of the rest of your raid. Also, what you are raiding is likely to be very important. He isn't running this build in his MC and Nax videos, he has Omen of Clarity on those. He is using it in AQ, where after tanking he has a lot of viability as a poison removal bot instead of a mediocre cat DPS.
---
Agreed
---
Do that stupid long quest to get my dreadsteed. It took me weeks to farm all the crap to do those quests and its the coolest cranky horse around.
---
edited version here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/csvuy0/edited\_map\_of\_orgrimmar\_added\_pois\_and\_legend/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/csvuy0/edited_map_of_orgrimmar_added_pois_and_legend/)
---
Correct. The 26th.
---
&gt;In the end though if you really want to play Ret, do it. Just know that you will have a very hard time getting the gear you need to be decent.  
---
I was in an awesome situation in Vanilla and didn't really appreciate it as much as I should have.  I was in a server first raiding guild and I raided as Ret and sometimes Holy.  We used DKP on gear and I was able to get the gear I needed to be effective (alliance 2nd Hand of Rag) and I was always just barely behind on meters.  I've seen a *lot* of bad Ret players, even though the spec is pretty simple, and most people are thinking of those players when they imagine Rets trying to raid.  So I understand where it comes from.  I was going to reunite with my old guild and go Ret again but they're playing on the streamer server and I really want to avoid that server like the plague.  I have to find a guild on another server that will give me a chance.  Thanks for your reply.
---
Got so scare there :D
---
Mums a legend

Pages of nessingwary is mine most iconic one.

27th
---
Your account is surely still there, it's just been transformed into a 'battle.net' account
---
If you open a ticket or go to battle.net I'm sure a gamemaster or service person will be very helpful in getting ur old account up and running
---
No pandas no blood elves, classic is as classic says, just the pure vanilla without content from burning crusade or wrath
---
The servers will be running the 1. 12 version of the game (or maybe 1.13?) so it's a patch from the very end of vanilla with the late game content well build out
---
Then I'm fairly sure you're remembering wrong. 680dps is the sort of number that you can expect if you've got full consumables, worldbuffs and T2.5.
---
Holy mother of god you are correct.  The current website for WoWhead is just insane!  How does anyone effectively use it for ANYTHING?
---
Yea, I had this conversation a couple weeks ago. As horde, I would feel like I accomplished more if I made them bubble hearth. That being said, I am rolling a Paladin because I always wanted to have that experience but never got around to it back then.
---
I would love to know that too, missed setting up my UI during the last stress test. Private servers use 1.12 client, which won't work with the new addons for 1.13.
---
The ranks are respectively: 40%, 45%, and 50%. So, it's a 12.5% increase from 40 to 45. And then 11% increase from 45 to 50. A little deminished return. Rank 2 might be worth getting as it yields a better increase and is available at level 32. Rank 3 isn't available until level 56 or something, so that's...situational anyway I guess.
---
Layering isn't "blizz-like for classic" either, but we've got that for months to come. Neither is being on 1.12 for the entire duration. WoW classic *is* WoW remastered. They don't want an entirely faithful recreation because that would be completely unfeasible. They'd have to follow every patch to the letter.
---
Yes, we'll see, but there's no way in hell they stick to 3.5k conc during phase 2, the game would be almost unplayable. You can't just layer several megaservers into one at the start and hope it dies down to barely anyone at all playing, it needs to be several times bigger because you're making the server several times bigger temporarily.
---
Indeed I have "some clue" of what I'm doing, and by some clue I mean Joana's guide, haha.
---
Now about the rest, I don't intend to have any life left for that week. And I perfectly understand why you wouldn't do it or find it ridiculous, it's just something I want to do once in my life. I'm not 14 anymore either, I'll probably have kids soon enough, so this is some kind of "last challenge" to me. Just wanna do the fastest time possible this once with if possible realm/national 1st (I'll be on a French server), then go back to work and casual playing.
---
Would you be able to just post your profile? Would love to use this setup!
---
Elvui is also available now.
---
thanks for sharing this. Nice that I can set up my addons with this.
---
Honestly I hate the way thousands of players in preformed communities are organising what server they're going to. I know we can't avoid it nowadays but it just kills a part of classic for me

---
Im on Remulos. I dont want to play the game while dying every 45 seconds because of pvp. I want to die every 45 seconds because of my own personal ineptitudes.
---
&gt;Thank you for that input, though ur speaking about resto druid only as pve, could u elobarate for PvP? Since actually most druid pvp Specs are at least "medium deep" in resto, more full.
---
Deep Resto in PvP is again a bit worse than the other healers, but the gap does not widen at later stages. However, druid is better in PvP as a hybrid of any type.. often you just go partirally into resto to argument the rest of your build. 
---
&gt; And do U mean just Bear Form or a feral Baer spec?
---
Feral Bear spec. Gotta get that Heart of the Wild hp and thick hide armor.
---
A build you should look into Heart of the WIld + Nature Swiftness builds. Looks somthing like this: [HOW/NW](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/-500242130302215-05502310401) (bear). There are both cat and bear focused versions of this build, but the bear one is best vs. warriors.
---
Thank you for your answer!
---
you think its not good?
---
always one who kills the fun by going too far.
---
Not taking a day off for any game. I have a family now and a career. Pretty sure you will be in queue. The game can wait imo
---
Thank you!
---
Arenas broke the game more than anything else, having to attempt to balance for what are essentially duels is what led to homogenizing all of the classes, and at the end of the day there's always one or two classes above the rest anyway.
---
I would take off the day after launch and log in during the morning hours when most people are at work or still sleeping
---
Thank you! Yes, I will go mage.
---
Well, people are min-maxing racials for PvP, imagine a profession with items that [silence and drains mana in AoE ?](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=16040/arcane-bomb) Or maybe a  [5 second spell reflect](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18639/ultra-flash-shadow-reflector) (for shadow spells).  
---
Yea it will never be a fair fight, it is almost another class worth of utility, prob more.
---
Not quite. It speeds up your next melee swing by 40ish% (?), it does not make you swing immediately once you parry.
---
Well ninja makes around 500k a month and henrys net worth is 20 mill and ninja made 10 mill in one year so at at this rate he will overtake henry by next year so its fair to say that the biggest streamers make similar amounts to movie stars
---
Cross realm bg's???
---
Is this a joke???
---
Is this another "you think you want this but you don't. Remember the queue times?? The incomplete rosters?"
---
Motherfuckers, I need to know who I'm up against. I need to recognize names. I need them to recognize mine!! Non instant queues mean I can multi task, gather, craft, prepare for a raid, get some traveling done as I prepare for a particular dungeon.
---
Instant queues and unrecognizable opponents means a non stop impersonal grind, it's not half as engaging. 'No fucking changes' wasn't just a snappy catch phrase, it fucking matters.
---
Probably a warrior too.
---
Is this some variation of Helm's Eye from Neverwinternights? Under Horde and Alliance crests.
---
Sort of like pack mentality? Idk, please explain.
---
For what i know “frontstab” is a retail thing (it’s backstab with the possibility to be cast in front of the target). Classic never had it. Ambush is from behind too and only dagger spell.
---
Really love your work, like it's probably been the most interesting thing I'm looking for on this sub those last days.
---
I just have to say however that things such as "You won't be topping the damage meters" , or the same kind of line for hunters about how their DPS does not scale well as other classes in later tiers, don't fit very well in those "class cards". I believe you've not written something like that for the rest of the other class so far, and it was good that way.
---
If your goal is to give new players good insights of what the class does, you should avoid leading them into the minmax / hardcore / PVE-DPS-IS-LIFE mentality. In the end all of those classes are viable, and that's what counts. If someone is hardcore enough to care, they won't need your cards to know anyway. *It's only my opinion though obviously, it's not meant to be mean in any way.*
---
A few other things you could have written that are not obvious instead is for example
---
* Heal mostly consists of hots compared to other healers (which is very good for solo or PvP, etc)
---
* travel form at lvl 20 (or is it 30?)
---
* Stealth is possible in cat form
---
* Maybe a bit less gear dependent that some other classes
---
* etc.
---
Just my 2 cents, but again, great work otherwise !
---
Thank you, I will go mage after reading all the responses.
---
where is the petmaster?
---
:D
---
Yea, he was the WoW Executive Producer at the time but became the CEO a year later. 
---
He was both the person who arrogantly told the world that they didn't really want WoW Classic and the one to announce it years later.
---

Preach is cool too. His audience should be the same.

It's still not enough to outweigh autistic army of forsen. Gonna roll somewhere else. Shame.
---
Sure, but need 2 accounts to do so.
---
Engineering is only as good as the amount of consumables you're willing to throw into it. That being said (and making certain assumptions about AH prices and a 'return on investment' basis) you're much better off throwing any disposable income you have into 'free action potions' if you want the maximum return on consumables.
---
***
---
Having the option to do something and electing to do it are entirely different things. Not having Engineering removes some options (i.e. can't use engineering only items) but if you'd never use them in the first place (because you couldn't justify the expense) then you're not missing out on anything.
---
The most expensive 'consumable' you are likely to use if you had Engineering is an Arcane Bomb. Ask yourself if you could justify that sort of expense, and then work backwards through the list. Eventually you'll find a point where getting that extra 'honor kill' isn't worth the expenditure.
---
By "boomkin" I meant balanse specialisation in general, not exactly last talent.

---
Yeah good times..
---
I usually expect shit from hunters. That being said I my wife, our friend, and I have always been very good with hunters. I wouldn't deny someone an invite over it though and if they really were bad I'd just offer some tips so that hopefully they can make hunters look better in the future.

Forgot Shamans in Valley of Spirits
---
Not worried so much about the competition, moreso want to know where we should be duo farming for maximum profit/levels
---
No Pandas, No BC, No WOTLK - just the pure Gold from WOW.
---
We have phases like it used to be. Almost no endgame Content in the beginning and then Phase by Phase they will add the raids (Like it used to be patch by patch)
---
There is a few minor differences in Itemization - you know some items got Change in the Expansion. 
---
A lot of those are in the Expansion from the beginning.
---
You will have to Call/Write Blizzard. They have been very helpful for a lot of returning Players (Plenty of Posts of Screenshots of old chars of reactivated accounts) I hope they are able to help you too! :)
---
HF &amp; GL on your Journeys!

the night from 26th to 27th at midnight.. we had the same issue in our group
---
I believe it's the eye of Dalaran.
---
u missing a reagent right behind the tower
---
&gt;It's the version of the game that existed in 2006 before the TBC pre-patch. They'll be slowly releasing the raids and BGs over time.
---
So no Alterac Valley on Launch? - or whatever that other one was for low level players, BGs were great.
---
Yeah nice. 
---
I think I'm going ret/holy the whole way from 1-60. Very keen to heal dungeons and the like while levelling. But yeah, very excited, feels like a great spec for doing both PvE and PvP with minimal respeccing endgame; maybe just a couple respecs during the first few phases if I get tired of solely healing battlegrounds.
---
what he says!
---
This. So much this. I’m looking forward to being part of the Alliance, not the Hero of Azeroth. I like that my character spends their early days dealing with small problems, but those lead into interesting things like the Defias Brotherhood and Van Cleef.
---
I also miss the old zones. I enjoyed them a lot more.
---
yea but it seems they added the stonetalon pass in later so we cant use it in classic :( at least from my researches as of now justdrop also said you need to go through barrens so ill prolly stick to needles
---
I like how EU store has HORRIBLE postages and they cant even bother selling most of stuff in US store.
---
I think I DON'T FUCKING CARE WOOOOOOOOOO CLASSIC BABY 7 DAYS WOOHOOHOOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
omfg
---
Most swedish i've talked to are going Firemaw now.
---
Exactly. I was busy playing Toontown back when I was sub 10.
---
Names are far less important than people think they are...
---
Exactly. Not all their ruinous changes waited for TBC to get implemented. You think we'd want flying mounts if they added them a week before the expansion?
---
Of course not! 1.12 is a convenient patch but shit, private servers had pvp on a single server. No one wanted nost to cross realm with other private servers even if it was possible; the self contained community and the integral world was the whole point.
---
I wasn't super fussed with shaman until the first stress test and having fun with totem management. Then cdew in the second PvP tourney flicked a crazy switch in my brain
---
/thread
---
It’s certainly an interesting coincidence whether they’re connected or not
---
I kinda agree but also not really.
---
I played a priest to level 45 on a Pserver and I have the impression that the amount of healers really is much higher than back in the day and ontop of that healers have a higher tendency of wanting to run dungeons.
---
So what happened a lot is that we just went into the dungeon with several healers. I remember specifically one Scarlet-Monastry-Run where we had 3 People with healing-spec! That was rare but 2 was really common like in every other dungeon-run common. We decided who of the healers would volunteer for DPSing. It often was me since as Nightelf I had Starshards, which are pretty neat for that purpose.
---
So essentially it's not really a big deal and easily to work around. It takes a little longer but also is a lot safer. 
---
Anyhow, I decided to roll a druid due to that instead of a priest because that way I can tank and thus will never have to look long for a group.
---
Posts like these increases the odds that you meet people IRL who play on the same server as you.
---
I have a group of friends I want to play with, and we roll together, but I have 3 other group of friends who roll with their group of friends. It's exceedingly difficult getting all of these players to play on the same server.
---
I tried to leave shazzrah in favour of gehennas, but the pull from friends staying at shazzrah was too much.
---
Now with these news, I can finally convince everybody to go to Firemaw. People didn't want to leave the server because "everybody else" was staying.
---
That is the point of posts like these
---
&gt; crit supression
---
what is this?
---
mums are great. :)
---
&gt;for belittling that dude in front of millions
---
That's a very good point. Imagine being that guy, a twinkle in his eye, excited about a Blizzard game he loves, being told that he thinks he wants to play his favorite game, but he actually doesn't.
---
How stupid do they think their fans are? Imagine being so cynical and disconnected from your hardcore fans that you can't even acknowledge their desires as real.
---
It has been some sort of miracle that we're getting Classic.
---
It was probably Mike Morhaime's last huzzah before he left the company (since Mark Kern met with him in person about it after Nost was shut down).
---
lol
---
haha, ye but this time around we are old farts, 30-55 years old. We gonnaa die all the time :)

Lol, "To streamline your answers:"

Out
---
Rocket helm, swiftness pot, rocket boots etc. If poly + IB aren't enough to survive you need to fight consumes with consumes
---
Because for a solution to be good it would have to work.
---
hard to say but the amount of estimated raiders in each guild is listen on the spreadsheet. There a link to it on nordicclassic.jinnis.se
---
Not too much intention should be given to healing specs for leveling though.. Like there is absolutely no use to use a healing spec while leveling, because you can heal every dungeon with any point in your healing tree until level 60 anyway. Better look at what's best between the 2 other specs.
---

---
I have no idea who Forsen is, I can't find him on the avoidstreamers site though? Even though he seems to have quite a viewerbase looking at his statistics. Do you know which server and faction he is going to then?
---
Might be best to go Gehennas. No streamers and wholesome community compared to Shazzrah.
---
FYI,  Shazzrah is chosen by large CIS population as their game server.
---
You also have to consider corpse runs, because that hunter finally outwaddled your hamstring vs wing clip slow just to kite you to death. 
---
A hamstring root by a level 44 warrior sporting executioners cleaver or stoneslayer or rockpounder really is nothing to sneeze at. 
---
At that time he has a decent chance to put you in the ground.
---
Thank you.
---
Even has Mudsproket. smh
---
Oh yes, makes sense. You're right:)
---
How is that different from arenas?
---
In Germany we only used TeamSpeak starting in the 90s with counterstrike
---
Well best to get put in front of that one. Otherwise it would always hang over him.
---
The future holds: Position in queue 34,204
---
nice karma whore post we have here. maybe next time, do little research before posting useless info (hint: frontstabing is not working in classic)
---
I can shapeshift out of polymorph!? daaaamn I didn't know that.

Forgot reagent vendor and repair
---
Wait there's a bowyer down by the entrance of org? 
---
I always ran all the way to the valley of honor to the bowyer to the right of the entrance there.
---
only swedes go to gehennas
---
a few danes are staying on shazzrah and rest, incl the nowegians, are rolling on firemaw
---
Because it would potentially create queue for the people who actually want to play on that server.

It's not fucking hard to understand if you try to not think like an entitled bitch

&gt; A fresh level 60 probably won't have the money for a flying mount. 
---
Do you even know what you're talking about?
---
&gt; At least a level 50 vs a level 60 you're both on the ground and they can't just hover over you.
---
They can just stay hidden far enough, and then catch you and kill in seconds.
---
If a char who's 10 level higher than you has decided to grief you while you're leveling there isn't much you can do anyway.
---
Yeah an elite mob being killed in dungeons with 5 people giving about the same amount of XP per player as a normal mob (if you kill it on your own) sounds about right to me and that's how I remember it. I thought you were talking about some extra bonus that didn't exist back then and they put in just for classic.
---
I believe it's an attempt at avoiding nationalities that give 0 fucks about speaking english on english realms.
---
It’s a good theory as long as the BFA servers can maintain players or create interest with an expansion.  
---
If the people playing it are noticeably fewer, they may go the other way.
---
How do you have 1 point in mindflay but 0 in the 2nd row in shadow? That’s not possible.
---
Ha !  
---
Ca joue sur Aubergine ou Sulfuron ? Quelle classe ?
---
This answer made me make my mind up. Thank you.
---
Same for me with paladins, it started in diablo 2 and continued into WoW
---
Deep wounds scales off the weapon's average damage.
---
AP has nothing to do regarding the bleed tick.
---
World PvP is the sole reason for me to come back to this in many ways outdated game. I don't look forward to the time&gt;all gear progression, but I definitely can't wait to gank again.
---
What are you talking about, the exact same thing happened in vanilla.
---
Is impale really worth the 8 talent points while leveling ? I assume that Deep Wounds pre-60 is useless, so 20% additional crit damage alone sounds like a waste.
---
dope
---
People seem to forget.. 5days (4d 20h being worldrecord) ingame playtime is quite a lot of reale time.
---
If for example you can play 3h a day after work... ;)
---
No, some of the honor gear you can get is vastly better than the early dungeon/raid stuff, so it'd imbalance things quite a lot. The release schedule looks like this, with no given time frame for each phase:
---
* **Phase 1 (Classic Launch):** Molten Core, Onyxia, Maraudon. PVP enabled but no honor.
---
* **Phase 2:** Dire Maul, Azuregos, Kazzak. Honor system and PVP rewards.
---
* **Phase 3:** Blackwing Lair, Darkmoon Faire, Darkmoon deck drops begin. AV and WSG.
---
* **Phase 4:** Zul'Gurub, Green Dragons. AB. 
---
* **Phase 5:** Ahn’Qiraj War Effort begins, Ahn’Qiraj raids open when the war effort dictates, Dungeon loot reconfiguration (Tier 0.5 Dungeon gear, Relics, drop rates and location changes)
---
* **Phase 6:** Naxxramas, Scourge Invasion. World PVP objectives.
---
Bear in mind AV will be the final 1.12 version, not the original version where battles could go on for 2 days at a time. This could well change beforehand if enough people moan about it.
---
this post is why this subreddit sucks now, who cares?
---
Sure, but the thing is the crowds would be of equal size probably, at least if it warrants having their own realm. For example, if you assume that a realm holds 20k players (that's no estimation, just a random number), then the only difference would be that you'd play with 20k Swedes instead of 20k people from different places.
---
I don't really see how that's limiting, unless you think Swedes are somehow worse at gaming.
---
Definitely! Thanks for your answer!
---

@RealOwner
---
It needs to be under a new account.
---
The 12-hour clock system is a convention where the 24 hours of the day are divided into two periods of 12 hours numbered 1-12 starting at midnight. We then use the Latin terms ante meridian (meaning before midday and abbreviated to AM) and post meridem (meaning past midday and abbreviated to PM) to indicate which half we are referring to.
---
There is no '0:00' in the 12 hour clock system. The periods run 1-12 (repeated twice).
---
Remember the terms 'before midday' and 'after midday'? Any time right up to 11:59 and 59 seconds is before midday so is referred to as AM. As soon as you get to 12:00 and 1 second it is now after midday (by 1 second!) so the correct term is PM.
---
The only problematic time is at exactly midday (or midnight) because it's neither before or past midday so can be confusing. Modern convention to refer to midnight as 12:00am and midday as 12:00pm which makes sense to me as within 1 nanosecond of it being 12:00 the am / pm will be correct. However to avoid confusion if you are referring to exactly midnight or midday it's probably better to use '12 noon' and '12 midnight' to avoid confusion.
---
Blizzard is predicting 10k player queues on Herod being some of the worst. 
---
In the stress test i got an 11k player queue which took slightly more than an hour - allowing more players to play via layers means people log out more often. 
---
Depending on your timezone I'd recommend using team viewer or similar software to log into the queue from work on the 26th and take the 28th off instead if you only have two days to spend.
---
\&gt;  I'm ready for nice boring Westfall, just some bummed out farmers and their fields as well as some nice forests with some ruins.   
---
And crazed farming machines, the secret base of a criminal organization, several invasions of tide people and an aggressive fauna.
---
He would have to have an account on NA, so if he still plays on EU would have to pay for 2 accounts
---
Seems right. Thanks!
---
Lets be honest people mainly care about who full cleared the raid first by killing the end boss. Besides BWL Horde cleared every other vanilla raid first
---
I want the authentic experience though.
---
Agrer
---
No need to be rude my friend :) not sure if a low pop server would necessarily get a queue from this tho
---
I have no issue with layering personally, I trust them to remove it. I've played on enough private server releases to never want to deal with thousands of people in a starting area again.
---
Getting to your post, I understand and agree with everything you've said. My question is: with layering are they letting way more people onto a server than they plan to let on later on with out layering? My concern is if theyre letting 15k into a server that later will have a 5k cap, then when phase 2 hits if there hasnt been a substantial drop off in players suddenly people with level 60 toons on the server are going to have 3 hour queues to get in - its going go be too late to switch servers for many crews/guilds.
---
https://shadowpanther.net/mainhand.htm
---
This sub will say pvp but with limited game time I recommend pve. On a pvp server your the way you play is dictated by the other players. If you log in to quest and then you get gank/corpse run for the next hours its time you lost. You also need to be 60 before phase 2 otherwise its going to be hell on earth.
---
Mob tagging doesn't work in classic.
---
I think it's level 18
---
No, I just posted this interview in a separate comment: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYuUD0o-Nz8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYuUD0o-Nz8)
---
2006-like caps to begin with and they are gradually going to **increase** that number over the first few weeks.
---
Queues will still happen on the big servers after phase 1 in all likelihood due to the sheer volume of people on those servers.
---
A bit late, but 25rage (intimidating shout) is quite expensive in comparison to the 10rage spammable slow.
---
Also intimidating shout breaks *immediately* on the main target on any kind of damage.
---
Have a bleed effect (like deep wounds which you can't control) on the feared target? Fear breaks immediately.
---
It can be amazing like switching your maintarget towards the hunter pet, fear the pet, switch back. The pet you ignore anyways will now be feared 8 seconds, while the hamstrung hunter is running in fear from you all while you are nuking him.
---
You don’t know how Anger Management work
---
Some important things about this that you might screw up: Don't forget your hearthstone is still set to Valley of Trials ; If you ress 4 times (25% item durability per death= 100%) your items will break even in inventory, and you will have 0 copper to repair it, so be careful ; I did this run in stress test as a hunter and my level 10 pet quest sent me back to razor hill, durotar. 
---
Adding to other replies, you can die at the water and ress at ratchet, but maybe the walk distance from the GY to flightmaster is the same so idk if this death is worth. As soon as you leave ratchet you can die and ress at crossroads (get flightpath), walk south past the mankrik wifes bridge and die again, ress at camp taurajo (another flightpath), walk to mulgore. It took around 10-11 mins

Definitely recommend mining for the 50 arcanite bars, the transmute cd's is something you can get cheap or free from guildmates, if a guild gets both tf halves they will all have to pitch in for the 100 bars for their mt as well anyway.
---
The reagents from mc usually go to a guildbank (an alt of the guildleader, or a seperate account which the officers have access to). And after a few mc runs (long before you probably see the eye drop, and definitely long before you have 8-9 sulfuron ingots) your guildbank will be overflowing with those fiery cores ect and wont mind giving them to you. The only problems are the sulfuron ingots (drop only from golemagg, \~10-30% chance) and hearts of the mountain (rare drops from the molten giants &amp; destroyers \~1-3%, but sometimes in the ah) And you should be getting those from your guildbank as well if they have any, since sulfuron sngots arent used for anything else, and Heart of the mountain only has maybe 1-2 other somewhat decent niche uses (a feral tank trinket and maybe some fr gear idk...).
---
You should be worried most about the 8 (+1 for the recipe) sulfuron ingots, which just take a shitton of time &amp; luck, as you only get a \~10-30% chance once a week on one of those. Many progressive guilds stop raiding mc entirely before they ever got 8 ingots, most likely you'll have to contact other guilds and try to buy their ingots at ridiculous prices, or organize your own mc pugs where you reserve them.
---
Or moonglade. You get a teleport moonglade skill.

I´m pretty sure you start with Remorseless Attacks and then go combat tree.

Why would you speak better English from watching movies with subs on?

Noone is forcing anyone to roll on any specific realm because of a poll.

You will still be able to choose any realm you want based on any criteria you may have.

The purpose of this post is to give people as much information as possible in order to make the right realm choise for them, based on whatever criteria they might deem important.

In the end we all want to avoid as many post launch realm transfers as possible. That's how realms die...

\- All in all you are looseing \~ 6% crit chance against bosses.
---
\- For every level a mob is above you you get 1% less chance to crit it. Most Bosses are level 63 so thats 3% "supression"
---
\- Secondly bosses have an "pre-aura supression mechanic"  where you loose anything from 1 to  3% chance to crit from talents, items and buffs. So thats potentially another 3% "supression"
---
\- On top of that there is a small reduction to crit chance just based on the weapon skill vs. defence.. neglectable 0.1% or so..

it use to be on warcraftmovies website, but i asked it to be taken out of embarrassment i guess haha.

I contacted the owner of the site about 8 years ago or so, and he still had the files and sent them to me :)

Sorry to hear bro, but hey, it hasnt released yet, so a big wave of players is still coming.
---
So during BST we are one hour behind CEST?
---
Yeah that doesn't work in classic.
---
I wonder if mor EU ones coming too
---
Apparently out of of 123 comments i am the only one that doesn't know this
---
Piercing howl absolutely. The times you lose aggro on one mob who will now interrupt the healer's spells are plentiful. Don't get me started on a ranged AoE slow in a PvP scenario.
---
Blood craze probably not, no real reason as you get healed like 20damage a tick.
---
Thank you I missed that interview. I think this might be worth bringing up again in the coming AMA to get even more clarification so I might try do that.
---
The fury talents seem kinda lazy i also disagree on putting 5 points into two-hand spec while disregarding improved charge. I rather sacrifice 1% damage and 1%parry for 6 rage more at every charge meaning i can immediately mortal strike.
---
So you decided not to move due to some GMs honor was tainted by not being part of the discussion? Bad politics

This seems much more balanced. Spiritual guidance isnt that great, are you really doing holy damage (other than maybe grinding with holy nova). Shadow weaving for getting a damage boosts for warlocks in raids.
---
I just googled it, this a vague estimation based on vague numbers with a questionable method, just to get other opinions!
---
Yeah I feel like this sub's biggest questions are all going to be based around server pops, caps and layers. It's the biggest thing we don't know enough about right now.
---
They are adding servers because they underestimate and dont analyze correctly in the first place.
---
I would like a new poll.
---
Not what many guides tell me.
---
Highly agree on this
---
That's exactly what I meant with the "I haven't seen addressed yet" part. Queues would be one option but as I said, there are many more.
---
I'd like to third this.
---
Why is everyone so hot to trot about blood craze? Imp battle shout is better IMO. Hear me out. At fresh lvl 60 you're going to have 5-6k hp. That's 150-180 hp healed over 6 seconds when crit with max blood crazy. This is versus a 137 attack power increase given by 5 ranks in imp battle shout. That's about a 9.8 dps increase. In most situations you're going to be utilizing imp battle shout 100% of the time. Whereas with blood crazy you'll only be utilizing it when being attacked. Not only this, but a fair amount of crits against you in PvP will be BIG. I'd much rather have that little bit of extra damage against a mage than that little bit of extra heath regen. I will say that blood craze would be good for sweeping strikes farming, but that's such a limited and minor use that it still doesn't make it worth the talent points. Piercing howl is money though, got to have that.
---
Obviously never played retail
---
Being a tank really is the free-entry-ticket to any 5-man.
---
But if you like the playstyle of being a healer more, you should think about it.
---
I really think druid is a great compromise, as I'll still be able to fulfill the role I actually wanted in PvP and Raids later on.
---
Pet attack - autoshoot - win.

Damn. This is what we parentes tell our children when we want them to do the opposite. He nailed us all.

well EU here the game launches at midnight and with 4 pvp servers now I honestly don't think there will be much of a queue.

&gt;I am a bully because I kill other players in a game
---
No. You are a bully because you admitted you get pleasure from making people cry.
---
Is this real or fake. Anyone have a link?
---
Well in that case you should absolutely have the release date off! And If possible have the whole week off. That way you get to grind with as dedicated players as you are and really get into the groove of classic :)
---
haha awesome
---
Don't bother with blacksmith, except if you are going to be the guild's smith (main armorer,axe/sword/mace smith). Usually the materials for this kind of weapons and armors are heavily contributed by your guild. So I except reagents that drop in raids (like lava cores) will be given for free and you'll get help for transmutes and arcane crystal gathering.  
---
Weapons like Hand of Ragnaros, Ashkandi and Ashbringer are status symbols and they are given priority to people who are distinguished within their guild. I'm not sure what you mean by dedicated. Usually those weapons are given to the people who not only are top tier in their dps/hps/role but to those who also contribute with assisting on organizing the guild,  succour their guildies when getting ganged, help others with leveling/quests/attunements and general to those who are the most popular within the ranks.  
---
IMO if I wanted to have a chance on those weapons I would focus on community aspects and be top3 of my given role, in order to have dips into them.
---
But then how do we know they aren't lying to us?
---
I understand your point but I disagree, it is a discussion after all. Thanks for bringing your take on the table :) There was some content in your whole post that I took notes of.

---
The "Go to master at level" is about the spells/abilities
---
It’s literally a straight boost to damage. Why would you not take it? I’m curious what guides said not to take it.
---
I've heard it's not a thing in classic, people have tried during beta and weren't successful
---
Protection is inferior to both arms and fury in leveling dungeons as a tank.
---
As a tank you want to get rage to use abilities. Your personal damage sucks, so you don't get much rage from hitting mobs, but the mobs also suck hitting on mail armor + shield, therefore you don't get much rage from being hit.
---
The last thing you want is the mob to do even *less* damage while you *also* do less damage due to lacking DPS talents.
---
Now you just never have enough rage. Yes, you live longer, but this really is no concern when the mobs are all over the place hitting your clothis.
---
The clothis might not be in immediate jeopardy of dying, but their spells are being delayed, the healer has to pump out more mana.
---
All in all protection really only comes into its own right at level 55+ when dungeon mobs actually start hurting you as a tank.
---
Thanks =)
---
The same thing is true for Warriors.
---
The only differences between "proper av" and the version we are getting are:
---
A few less elite mobs &amp; No mines
---
No mines really suck, but honestly it's not that big a deal. You can still have massive long battle if you want to, you can still summon the big bosses and stuff.
---
That sounds rational, but in Petasos from Sailor MOON and Moon Goddess disciples are too much affinities for saying that Petasos isn't main source of inspiration

Ok buddy have a block

It should be all damage, the im more worried about the used talent points / the stats you get. Firstly you spend 7 talent points for getting 25% SP from spirit. If you are thinking of shadow dps, you got instacast dot, instacast channeled spell and short cast dps spell. Nothing on that list is exactly scaling perfectly regarding +damage.
---
And on healing side, getting extra 50-75 healing is nice, but not gamechanging. Having a shadow weaving priest in raid is something to think about. Hybrid build you arent going to be the top dps OR the top healer. So you need to do something that others cant.
---
Percentage is a great idea actually. I think we just did something like minimum 10 dkp for non set and 20 for set pieces. It made it feel like Valor points in some ways. We also gave everyone who showed up day one a base amount of dkp so the first run people had stuff to spend.. and it generated pretty quickly since we did attendance and hourly dkp. We experimented with boss dkp but people tended to show up only for bosses on farm then bail when we started wiping.
---
Warcraft 3 is the best game of all time. However if you want to play now, I would recommend you play the offline version of the disc as the ai has been broken ever since Blizzard started working on the game for Reforged. So people who play the campaign atm, play against a malfunctioning ai. A real shame, for such an exelent campaign. 
---
Also the Scene is very much Alive and if you want to learn more about the Game there are streams like Grubby (all races) and ToD (humans). For Custom games theres also streamers, my favorite is Macro Map Top player: Zoomsf. There is a game/games for everybody in Wc3 and allot of fun to be had.

How much memory do you dedicate to addons on the addons screen?

Well it's still not wrong, do server say full? Yup!
---
It's not to segregate people, but to avoid *language barriers* as much as possible.
---
EU has a plethora of different languages and not everyone speak English fluently, so it happens that some people "monopolize" English servers for not having one in their own language and *don't respect* the server rule of talking in English on public channels, they may not even speak English at all.
---
Good luck playing on a server being overrun by people that speak a language you cannot understand.

'Sweden' is of course a big collection of individuals, but when talking about a somewhat big organized coalition of vocal guilds, those guys are set on Gehennes. It's a shame though, i would have liked for them to come to Firemaw. Allthough, there are lots of people from all of the nordics who im sure will divide themselves on all servers
---
I will never have the panache like this og gangsta kid:

Yeah all 10 of my friends thought I was crazy for wasting 7 dollar just to reserve the name “Daddy”. I think it’s worth it. And they’ll be subbing the day before or the morning of.

&lt;Lux Vult&gt; | North America | Alliance | Pagle (PvE) | Semi-Casual
---
Semi-casual consisting of long time players/raiders.  We put an onus on enjoying the game, playing what we want, and forming lasting relationships with solid raiders!
---
GM:       Tristnal
---
Faction:  Alliance
---
Region:   [US]
---
Server:   Pagle
---
Goal:     Semi-casual - 2 Week Day Raid Nights
---
The understanding, so far, is that we'll be running Tuesday with either Wednesday or Thursday as our second day. 
---
Raids will start around 7pm EST and we will discuss with everyone a good time to stop for the night.
---
Being flexible will be an asset, as we haven't decided 100% yet. Once times are decided, they will the same days/times every week.
---
Along with being semi-casual, we understand that people aren't going to be wholly dedicated to just the game and as such, we won't have any hard set requirements. However:  Vanilla has their own, so simple things like not being attuned, is entirely on you. We won't be enforcing things like full enchants and consumables, that being said, we do expect people to show up prepared for the short amount of time we have to raid each week. Therefore under performance and constant issues will likely get you sat for someone else. The onus is entirely on you as to who much or little effort you want to put in.
---
We'll be running Loot Council. Show up, contribute and get loot.  We are a fair group of people that put a premium on lasting friendships and cohesion as a group. As long as you are a team player, you will be rewarded the same as anyone else, this is a guarantee.  
---
Tanks, Healers, mDPS, &amp; rDPS are welcome!  Feel free to play what you enjoy, period!
---
"Meme" specs are welcome. As mentioned before, raid performance is considered, but raw dps is rarely a deciding factor. If you're constantly dead or causing issues, I don't care what spec you are, you'll be sat. So Ret Pallies and Boomies are welcome!
---
If you have additional questions and/or are interested in talking to us about joining, send me a PM here on Reddit, add me on discord (Thirdkind#4560) or join our discord and ask for an officer! (https://discord.gg/MzNcJjb)
---
I remember when wod was announced that was going to be the redemption for blizzard. We can keep hoping but it's never coming.
---
Crazy power creep is already in Vanilla.
---
We defeat an OLD GOD, for crying out loud.
---
This looks like the standard layout
---
Its easy when everyone is at going to play at the same moment. Me myself. I got 2 groups of irl friends. A Pserver crew and a old vanilla crew. Its already hard to coordinate to get them on the same server weeks in advance.
---
Golemagg or gehennas?
---
Thank you for this.
---
Blizzard has released a lost of servers that will experience "severe queues."
---
Their words.
---
I missed out on the diablo 3 launch so this time, i'll be prepared for error 37 part 2
---
Haha go ahead mate, got it on Gehennas
---
Enjoyed Cavill since he played Charles Brandon in Tudors. Would be awesome to run across him in game, though I’m sure most wont know it’s him anyway. That and I’m NA. Hope he doesn’t lose too much sleep over the game! At least not after the first week or two of nolifing anyway.
---
The people that want vanilla for WPvP will want TBC for the arena.
---
Some will want it for a few nostalgic raids.
---
Most people, even including vanilla, would prefer WotLK, so there will probably be something along the lines of a 35/40%-60/65% split between staying vanilla and trying/commiting to TBC until WotLK releases. 
---
Thats where the true golden plan of Blizzard lies. Thats where the golden cash-cow is.
---
Don't constantly look at your cheat sheet or the teacher will catch you
---
female human meta
---
I find it interesting because he said 'do you remember when you used to spam LFG in chat? no because now you just press a button'
---
What he said was the 100% exact opposite of truth.  I vaguely remember some LFG dungeons/raids I did, but no deep memories formed.  Because you put in so little effort, it all just kind of falls out of your brain two seconds later.  OTOH, I remember very clearly many groups I was in back when you manually searched.. you grew to know some people fairly well.
---
For instance, I still remember doing a BRD group with a friend, a BOE world epic dropped and we discussed quickly whether we should ninja loot it and split the gold.  We ended up not ninjaing it and won it naturally instead, but that debate was an actual, concrete memory.. I have no such concrete memories from the ENTIRE Mists of Pandaria expansion.  Only vague snippets.  The closest would probably be those cool timed chest runs.
---
You won’t need 50 you need less than 10 a week and they don’t even take that long to farm - it’s just an extra consumable for druids.
---
Isn't there an addon for this?
---
Very nice and visual! I just think Thousand Needles is a 130=225 map, rather than 130=25
---
That aside, very good indeed!
---
I have it on Gehennas aswel, just thought it'd be waste to let the name go to some random schmuck on launch day lol
---
Minnesota nice
---
I‘ll just sheep you and you wasted a bunch of
---
money to delay your death by 30sec
---
Valid point, but it doesn't make much sense business-wise: pointing classic instead of a new expac (which is likely coming out next year) to lots of players won't be a wise decision to do if you're after the money.
---
This is one of the few times where “back in my day ... Alliance don’t have Bloodlust, you had to dps your ass off all the time” is actually true lol.
---
Playing in my late 20’s through cata, then off and on, now at 42 I get to play with my daughter and show her why it is that I have all this wow stuff in my office.
---
Good times for all :)
---
Thanks for the answer c: now to hoping I won't be made fun of for my accent on the discord xD
---
Same server, good days on Lightbringer, horde or alliance back then? :)
---
Well it ain't like Finns are gonna speak english on whatever realm they end up on, hence the move to a specific server.
---
Obvious low effort troll
---
He meant that we don't dub english speaking tv shows
---
Im trying really hard not to play rogue again but the rogue class hall quests were awesome i really wish they had finished them .
---
You can only backstab from the behind, backstabbing from the front came on retail in wod i believe.
---
 stronger 
---
More than ever, 
---
Hour after, 
---
Our work is never over
---
This exactly is why games like Skyrim are far more immersive than Elder Scrolls Online for example. (In-universe comparison)
---
The world doesn't need to be jampacked with shit everywhere. And most important of all, you need long open stretches of well, nothing, because guess what, that's what a world is actually like.
---
Regardless of whether or not that stuff is crazy, developers need to learn to take a breather and just have more areas without all the stuff.
---
Good luck!
---
I don't like tukui because it takes up half the entire screen and makes me feel calostrophobic playing the game.
---
This is like a restaurant that caters to vegans, but is soon opening a stake joint next door. They aren't going to mix the damn dishes. They will not going to have the vegans and the meat eaters forcing them to eat a mix dish. No way.
---
Thinking that Blizzard will EVER make Retail more like Vanilla...is plain stupidity. 
---
Classic or not, successful or not, Retail will be even MORE streamlined, even more pruned, will make money virtually thru microtransactions...and in 2 x-pacs is going mobile. That's how easy and pruned and solo based ARG and mtx based Retail will be.
---
I don't know how 9.0 will be. But 10.0 is going to be the last PC based expansion for WoW Retail. After that, is mobile only all the way.
---
You'll want to keep tailoring after RotA since you will need it for the Bloodvine set after ZG releases. For your other profession, you'll eventually want to go Engineering, but early on you could consider vendor-skinning until 40 to help out with your mount, followed by mining (for ex. if you want to farm your own mats for leveling Engi) or herbalism (if you want to farm herbs - but as a mage you probably have better ways to make money). You could also keep skinning if you want to try getting into the devilsaur leather market at 60.
---
I hope they haven't fucked up the original campaign for good. What we will get with WC3R will likely be a different campaign that is retconned to hell.
---
&gt;you're looking at 40 hours a week.
---
casual.
---
You're not playing classic properly without a poop bucket, a mtn dew fridge and hot pockets via conveyor belt. /s
---
I really believe there are 3 entirely seperate populations in classic.
---
* The hardcore crowd that is disappointed if they don't clear MC within first reset
---
* The significantly committed, that will get to 60 within a month or 2 (playing 3-4h/day) that then pushes for progression
---
* The casual that will take months to get to 60
---
I belong to the third group. And in my books the first group could as well play a different game than me as their experience will be so different than mine. Devilsaur Mafia? throwing manabombs in pvp? Min-maxxing raid composition? 2 rows of consumable/buffs to kill thrash in mc?
---
I think it will be an achievement for me to clear BWL.
---
Many enough to give particular countries their own realms as it would affect game play.
---
Can I just mention I'm loving this community, it is like going back in time. So many people sharing maps and guides they have made, people reacting nicely and providing constructive feedback. It really is great.
---
I could have said this in many other threads over the last couple of days but this is as good a place as any.
---
Thanks! I got it from your link, looks great. Hope I see you there.
---
Rogue!
---
There is a huge difference between the community that would play classic if it were free and those willing to pay for it.
---
I agree that the macro probably isn't possible anymore.
---
Addon, I want to say that's Healbot. However I don't think raid frame addons can re-sort in combat like this anymore.
---
If you don't know what you're doing, you shouldn't be making *guides*.
---
Hope it goes well!
---
*eats fish that turns me into a ninja*

Pitiful immaturity, but who cares.
---
The one with the lacrosse kid.
---
Frost is the greatest fire will always be boring.
---
Yeah, same level of WoD/Legion/BfA power creep, right?
---
We are discussing on 2 entirely different levels.
---
No competition on RP PvP servers, very few good players choose them.
---
&gt; Then I will save up tons of herbs until I drop Tailoring for alchemy once I have the BOP Tailoring robes that are really good on Prie
---
this is my agenda but instead will be doing mining/engineering instead of herb/alchemy the wands are OP esp early game
---
still.. my point is they underestimate it :D
---
move to Skeram with us, the cool kids. Word on the street is we'll have black jack and hookers.
---
If you have the client downloaded there will be a drop box that will let you choose WoW classic instead of retail.
---
Can you ask guards where things are in Classic?
---
&gt; In a month when the lvl 20 wall hits the majority of players 
---
You mean a week, right? Because no matter how slow a player is, lvl 20 is like what? 25 hours or so?
---
So, in a week, we will see what the majority does. Hell, let's make it 2 weeks. But not 1 month.
---
&gt; If I do casual 10-15 BGs a week, how far will that get me? 
---
In terms of ranks, and the gear that will allow you to purchase,  not very far at all. 
---
&gt;Also does that mean that the more players are aiming for higher ranks, the more difficult are they making it for each other? 
---
Yes, if it is implemented in the same way it was, then there is competition between players of the same faction on the same server, as one ascends another descends.  You will be limited to how many ranks you can increase per week, so taking a weeks holiday and living off high caffeine drinks and playing for 18+ hours per day for the week will have a very limited impact as to how far you rise in ranks.
---
Totally....30+ at heart, rather than by birthday :)
---
I was trying to rack my brains where I’d read/seen that response before! Thanks for laugh lol
---
Hunter will be fine. Like another posted said, it's just an issue if you are super hardcore and want to compete against other dps classes.
---
 But I mean classes are different. Do you really need to compare yourself to other classes for the dps meter? Just compare yourself to other hunters and try and do the best you can. Also like already mentioned hunters are brought for other things than just dps.
---
 I think hunter is a very fun class to play and that is what is most important. I will roll a warlock but it's a close call between hunter and lock. You can do so much to improve your gameplay with hunters. Weaving Auto Shots, feign death trinket switches, controlling your pet etc. So much you can experiment with.
---
Ironically, this comment right here is “””brutally honest”””.
---
Oh snap!  I thought you were just making up a random year.
---
What's with the hate for Asmongold ?
---
The difference is that assholes on RP-PvP servers only pretend to be assholes when on PVP they are just assholes.
---
Heirloom vendor, maybe 1(general) chat will be less of "anyone know where the looms are" spam lol
---
This dude is living in the moment!
---
No clue. Its been a long time since I worried about addon usage. Wasn't aware it was still a thing!
---
So we do AH scans, just like the good old days!
---
Hello reddit! I discovered one of fundamental secrets of World of Warcraft some years ago and want to share it with classic community. It is true source of inspiration of Night Elves creator, especially NE druids. And where is the source, what do you think? It is in... Simpsons? South Park? Star Trek? No! It is in...
---
Sailor Moon anime!
---
Just look at that character above! She reminds something, isn't she? That character is from first season of Sailor Moon, episode 15, which was aired on 20 June 1992.
---
Why I am have no dougbt that it is main reference for NE creator:
---
1. Purple skin colour, just like in WC3 and later
---
2. King size eyebrows, just like in WC3 and later
---
3. Elf size ears
---
4. Toxic green hair color, just like in WoW
---
5. Markings, which firstly came from WC3 art, but at that character they more look like from WoW
---
6. Leather armor (at least it looks like that)
---
7. Night Elves venerate Elune, Goddes of the Moon, and that character is from Sailor MOON anime (in which Moon theme is very important)
---
8. Nature magic and connection with forces of Nature
---
I have no doubt that artist, who made concept of Night Elves (Samwise Didier?), was inspired by that Sailor Moon character, Petasos. But anyway, I want to see official confirmation of that, so question to Blizzard is:
---
Are Night Elves were inspired by Sailor Moon character, Petasos demon from 15 episode of Sailor Moon?
---
Even if Bliz say no, or not remember where is source of inspiration, it is insanely next to impossible that such constellation of affinities of Petasos and Night Elves is just play of chance. That way, probably Samwise or his colleague saw Petasos out of the tail of his eye just by a moment and character sketch was remembered by subconscious. And if they didn't see Petasos at all, they can took conception from informational dimension where it was already materialised (how that mind technology works is another topic but you may know that many things were invented simultaneous and "independently").
---
So reddit, what do you think all about that?
---
A poll will happen in the next three days with results available immediately, but for today, we're focused on the AMA (10 AM PDT).
---
The thing with engineering is:  You can't buy most the the good consumables that it gives you.  Whereas with other profs you usually can.  For example you can buy all the potions/elixirs/flasks/enchants/boe crafted gear etc.  But you can't buy/use grenades as a non-engineer, or goblin rocket helm, or the mc hat, or deathray, etc etc.
---
End of the day engineering gives you quite an edge vs people who don't have it.  And vs people who do, it keeps it even.  So yes, you need it if you're serious about pvp.
---
NB: that doesn't mean you need to do engineering right now as you level a new char on a new server though.  You could always go mining/herbing for cash and then just kill the herbing at 60 and reskill eng for example.
---
 Not really sure. Many small things I guess. For example I haven't played alliance in ages and going for it in classic. I like gnomes and hunters can't be gnomes so that would be one reason. Another would be warlock was the last character I played on a private server so have it fresh in memory. Just stuff like that not really related to the class itself. 
---
 Race for mage/warlock? Just play what you prefer. It's not going to be gamebreaking. If you don't feel very strongly one way or another go gnome. I wouldn't roll gnome though if you can't stand them( seems to be common I guess :P).
---
This is the true chad move
---
It isn't. You need to understand that people value money differently. If you are just going to buy a car, you don't need a Ferrari. If you are "just" going to play classic, then you don't need to reserve a name. other people put pride/whatever behind their avatar and feel 7,5 dollars are worth it to secure a name.
---
Ah good call, I'll recognize your claim and defer the Danish claim to you guys, so it's officially yours
---
Later, can't remember what phase exactly but its like 3 or 4
---
Yeah I know, just find the phrase funny.

Also he's been dating pink sparkles for a year and a half so he isn't a virgin.
---
Asmongold is the reason I’m so pumped for classic. Cavil just has a dank chin.
---
I’m sure someone said you can’t skin the starting area mobs? If so then it shouldn’t matter and don’t run there and all the way back at the start! 
---
(Someone correct me if I’m wrong pls!)

Maybe hes not his kid
---
Yup, I fell ya pain, though I have taken a free day on 28th, warned my GF that I will be zoned from this world, and gonna start my seesion from 27th after work, until 28th evening.

Of course I didn't tell my boss the real reason why I need the free day, had to lie.

He said and drove home making in that 1 event, what most of us make in a year.
---
Why the fuck does EU get all the cool names? Fairbanks sounds like a suburb somewhere.
---
What is Vendor Skinning? NPCing trash skinned mats? And how would I level my Tailoring during the process of leveling?
---
I get that, but what about the situation makes it useful and what doesnt? At how many combo points does it become worthwhile? Does it depend on your eviscerate rank? Hit %? Ever rank 1 or also rank 2 SND?
---
„Go to master“? So green ist a must go and red is not?
---
It works for Sinister Strike. Don´t need daggers to make use of RA.
---
You do this with 39 others though. You are still a soldier in an army. And not THE hero. In other expansions you are THE hero. Leader of your own army.
---
Or just download before and set them up when you log in? Or play the game without addons for a few hours and install at the end of your first play session?
---
There are a lot of options that don't require you to sit around not playing.
---
RIP Taylor.  You never played vanilla, but I’m sure you’d be pumped.
---
3+ hour queues imo
---
Really? I'm not so sure. I was thrilled once the dungeon finder came out. Now, some 10 years later I don't want anything to do with it.
---
The thought occurs... I had friends once... then they announced Classic WOW
---
Definitely. As long as you respect those who are rp'ing, except the other faction of course, and don't have a name that doesn't fit with the server, you're good.
---
The only class to avoid is the one you don't have fun with.
---
I think a lot of current players also reserved names, but have no intent of actually playing much classic.
---
Rather not, afterall most of the issues retail has are because of blizz listening too much to the community at the detriment of their game.
---
People asked for xrealm dungeon finder, people asked for LFR, people complained about having to use ammo as hunters, people wanted flying in old azeroth, then people wanted faster flying and more portals and etc etc etc....
---
Blizzard listened and too often said "give the people what tehy want" rather than adults in the room saying "wait a minute, it's not good for the game...".
---
They dont open up till later in the day and there is a chance the servers shit the bed entirely amd game will be unplayable for a day or two
---
I really don't understand these? In teldrassil for instance, I need to fish 1 time to avoid getaway 75? What?
---
And guess which faction is known to not like PvP. Makes sense why it's full.
---
N64 gameshark with the good ol GS button nice

I don't know. It was marked as planned until a few days ago. Now it says updated.

---
Having an ass for a chin is chad like?
---
I was telling my friend the same.  I’ll be playing super casual but he and his friends (total of 20+) haven’t resubbed yet either.
---
Lol yes the slowest leveler in the game gets faster when you add someone.
---
You are comparing the absolute top outlier streamer vs a mid tier movie star. Come back and talk when Ninja is worth near the $500m ish Tom Cruise is roughly worth.
---
Knaak is absolutely awful
---
You could play on a RP realm and never once RP or be affected by it in anyway whatsoever. You could act as if you were on a normal realm and no one would bat an eye.
---
You’ll see guilds recruiting for RP in general and you’ll see characters walking around ‘in character’ but no one will ever, *ever* expect you to RP.
---
You’ll be missing out if you don’t though. It can really add so much more depth to an already deep game. The immersion can be through the roof if it’s done well.
---
One side we see an Outstanding character who ‘s acting skills are on point. He’s making plenty of money to perform a show when on camera. Who we look up to as a wow player. 
---
On the other side we see Henry Cavill
---
Or group up and grind more.
---
Literally a countdown there and on the world of Warcraft website.
---
compliment professions are not neccesary at all.
---
The optimal play for mage professions is:
---
Skinning until 60, then figure out what your main gold making profession will be, this is either skinning, herbalism or mining. Depends how you farm gold basically. 
---
Level up that profession and replace skinning(unless if that's the one you pick), with tailoring and use all the cloth you got while leveling(mail it to any alt, that's a very easy way to save it) plus some from AH. Get the archmage chest.
---
Now you can either choose to go engineering for better pvp and pve, or to go double gold making profession. I think engineering is amazing to have, game isn't fun without it, and one goldmaking profession is enough. So abandon tailoring and get either engi or that second gold making profession(something that compliments your first gold making profession, herbalism+skinning / mining + skinning works well). 
---
And that's it. Farm gold with the profession using aoe dungeon farming. Come phase 4 you will need bloodvine, so you have to reroll a gold making profession to tailoring again, however with phase 4 comes ZG crocodiles farming and it's really fun and good gold.
---
How would you configure an interface without actually seeing what you're doing? Because you need to log into the game to see what you're doing ...
---
Yeah I know that, maybe my title was a bit misleading. Does the priest suffer from this?
---
hodor was a fucking amazing DJ at blizzcon. I am not usually into that music, but he did that job perfectly
---
Classic players aren't the players that are going to buy the microtransactions anyway. They are the ones that, if they are gonna play retail, are only gonna pay for the sub anyway plus box price I guess. 
---
Giving classic players what they want to get high sub numbers which still makes the company look good and then making retail more microtransaction heavy to make more money is a sound business idea to me.
---
It deffo worked both in old retail (guess most people remember Athene) and also on pservers. 
---
Thanks for the answers so far, would be great to get a proper source guys, its fairly important for my preparations!

You're a fucking idiot lmao.

It means you need a fishing skill of 1 to fish there and a skill of 75 to avoid fish getting away.

Used the stress test for this.  It took me about 30 minutes to get my addons where I wanted them.  I have a few more to iron out, but for the most part my UI is ready to roll.   At least until later.  If you had them working in the stress test you can copy them to your new characters.  Google will help.

I mean. Does Avril Lavigne count?

Everybody is in a rush to do everything. I hope people don’t forget to slow it down and enjoy the classic experience.

Ninja was a fluke and he does not make anywhere close to that any more.
---
The hero we needed
---
Thank you. The first part "number of fish" is really confusing. Shouldn't it just be fishing level?
---
I think that was a reference to Apex Legends.
---
Have you read the WoW Diary by John Statts?
---
I think # in this case means level of fishing required to fish.
---
And = means level of fishing to not get any getaways.
---
I always bought reagents from that hut to the left of the entrance to the Drag (straight north from that bank icon)...

This is litterly not true and I think they will make some millions but not hundreds. Thee have been some Diablo-ARPG-Games on mobile in China but they floppt so hard that they have really bad reviews. I actually think that China will review Diablo also bad if its turns out the same way as other ARPG on mobile.
---
Will have mana issues if they use spirit tap and the warrior is getting the killing blows. Overall just a bit though.
---
Sounds like the difference between Brasil and Portugal. They are pretty much the same but Portugal has an extra thicc accent.
---
Robin Sparkles?
---
Me neither. Yeah the Reforged campaign will be eddited to match the Bfa lore. I also think the current wc3 and Classic cannon is superior and it would have been better the other way around or pref to cut all lore past this. The expansion story's served their purpose and has no value post functionality. Even Vanilla suffers from this, unless the raids function as Fallout story's, where the outcome of the events are unsurtain. 
---
Yeah me to. It's a bummer that it's in this shape as allot of people show so much interest atm. You can still get decent practice against the Undead Insane computer as it creates very strong army compared to others. They just won't use their heroes.
---
? Competitive players rarely ever pick rp servers, it’s a fact. There is always some decent players, but on average compared to a high pop PvP server it’s not even close.
---
&gt;Bc has heroics, Azeroth becomes useless, resilience, pvp system is gone, arenas, no 40 mans, flying, summoning stones actually summoning etc etc.
---
Wow that sounds great.
---
&gt;Wrath has heroic and normals, lfg, flying, dualspec, 10/25 man versions, class ~~homogenization~~ **balance** and so on.
---
Wow that sounds even better.
---
Pretty sure you are talking about ...... "Tex".....
---
Still you are accomplish, with 39 others, what thousands couldn't.
---
I don't know the answer to your question, but the undercity is like, at most, 5 minutes away from Org, and thats if you just missed the Zep. If you want to level in Durotar, i'd say just do it and take the extra maybe 5-10 minutes to go get the rogue quest in undercity if need be.
---
Jesus, look at [the dude's comment history](https://i.imgur.com/V2lYz2z.png), you can't make this shit up.
---
XD
---
They mostly aren't.
---
My guild does this for end of raid. Much more fun in bfa with all the portals we have access to.
---
&gt; I think it was the best in WoTLK, where you were part of the elite group of adventurers that with Fordring defeated Arthas
---
I agree
---
&gt; There was a predetermined order of who was going to be rank 14 each week that was planned out months in advance at any time.
---
And that was how they reduced the amount of grinding for everyone involved. Until that aone jackass that doesnt want to wait and is willing to fight the entire server for it shows up.
---
Understood, that is, I thought they would scale as much as needed not cap it.
---
There are two simple rules you need to follow and you will be fine:
---
1. Give your character a lore friendly name
---
2. Don't disturb other roleplayers while roleplaying. You don't have to roleplay yourself if you don't want to.

Because it removes the potential for people to be influenced by previous votes. A lot of the time people will just vote for what's winning since there's "no chance" the other option will win.
---
That's a good point. I can see that a lot of people might stop playing once they realize it takes longer than a week to hit 60.
---
My brother was a massive Rp'er he would organize events in different areas and had a crazy huge character story. I remember him standing in the same spot for like 3 hours straight, just talking in character with whatever role-play session he was doing. 
---
He would also occasionally troll the hell out of people (in character) because that is also funny as hell. As long as you piss off if told to do so you'll be fine
---
Where ddoes this logic come from? Barely anybody wants a cata re-release, let alone one of the later expansions. They'll never go further than cata, simply because it's not worth the effort.
---
Vanilla and possibly tbc and wotlk are sought after, because they represent the height of the game.

I mean you really think anyone scouring this sub reddit is not allready counting seconds? :D
---
Yes he meant vendoring the low level leather.
---
You get cloth for tailoring from humanoid enemies. It just drops, you don't need a gathering profession for it. If you find you are outleveling your tailoring (higher level cloth is dropping than what you need) then just grind some lower level humanoids until your tailoring is up where you need it
---
it will be fine :)
---
I just mean with druids there's really no solid "spec", you're thinking like retail
---
This sub is actually 90% casuals, any hardcore discussion gets drowned out by the hourly "PSA: play what you want, don't min max, don't read any guides, read all the quest text" post.
---
I'm assuming tap means pulling aggro? You start with immolate, which does instant damage. In fact it does damage faster than shadow bolt (which is a projectile), so that's another pro.
---
Color it pls
---
There was an interview a few years ago with a few of the top dogs at Blizzard where they said that Classic should be preserved as it's a big part of gaming history. I don't think they'll roll the servers over to TBC, I think they'll likely just create new servers to host it separately.
---
Show poll results after voting. Easy.
---
It was possible, it was called Stress test.
---
&gt; more stuff to do
---
Does it though? You have the exact same stuff to do, no more no less. You just get points for completing it which competes against other peoples completion points. You've got BfA if you like hunting achievements, or literally any other modern game.
---
How'd you do that?
---
Rank 1 slice and dice is pretty lackluster though, I usually skip it until I access level 2.
---
You could just making macros with ur basic attacks that have pet attack in it.
---
You saved me. I thought it was launching at noon on 27th!!!
---
So launch is on midnight 26/27th? I gotta go to bed at 5pm then and sleep until like 11pm so I can do a 24h run
---
best mage guide online at the moment!
---
It really could go either way. It could be a niche thing that only 100k people are playing after a year or it could continue to blow up and Blizzard knows this.
---
Thats not the point though, you have to have engineering to use them - you don't have to have alchemy to use potions, or enchanting to use enchants.
---
No I don't think Classic was lazy, but re-releasing TBC and WotLK is definitely lazy in my opinion.
---
It is possible.  But I would think plenty of people follow esports or at least know of some e sports teams that are large enough.
---
Or horde propaganda

You'll have to run.
---
The passage you're talking about came on Cataclysm, when it was actually possible to fly in the old Azeroth overworld. The reason is that because of flying, they had to "render" chunks of the world in a different way. Check out the image you've just sent as a response to another comment; notice how it becomes an elevated extension of the map with grass and mobs, rather than being just a natural barrier between zones. The grey passageway with Nelf ruins between Mulgore and Desolace wasn't there back then for the same reason: it was unaccessible and, as such, there was no reason to actually model a way through the natural barrier.
---
Although if you try enough perhaps you can glitch through it - but that's not the point, I'll suppose.
---
Rushing to beat 15 year old content that's already beat is selling yourself short.  Only reason to rush is if you want to be the first to good gear from mc to wreck other players with.
---
His point was people using tools others dont gives them an unfair advantage.
---
Well a spreadsheet is a tool giving him an unfair advantage.
---
Hell should we force everyone to use a £5 m&amp;k so no one has an advantage there.
---
Tsm levels the playing field since it's free and easy to use.
---
Yeah, I think plenty will switch, but as of now, there are no low pop servers and unless they open some on launch day.  I do not see any staying at low if added a few days before.
---
Anyone know anything regarding itemache swapping in Classic?
---
fair enough, makes sense if you look at it like that.
---
Get leatherworking
---
Nice one mate!
---
Thanks for your work!
---
Plus waiting in queues on top of that. The average player might not even be able to play for a week if they can only play during peak times.
---
Thanks for all the answers guys! Really helped a bunch!
---
This video taught me a valuable lesson, the fear of the triple dot.

Need to add the fruit vendor for hunter pets.

Giant logo on the back is ugly, otherwise it would be really nice

It’s not like he just got paid millions by Microsoft or anything
---
Most people asking are going to be using some setup heavy addons. Things like WeakAuras, TSM, any of the various ElvUi or TukUi addons. A lot of these addons are very time intensive to set up the way you want it to feel
---
Wow hes just plain rude to people. If you dig a little i bet youll find at least one comment worthy of r/iamverysmart
---
I'm a bit confused here. People don't trust blizzard to make updates themselves, but they also don't trust themselves &amp; democracy to vote things into the game?
---
So what? What they want classic to just slowly die after naxx with 0 updates of any kind whatsoever post naxx?
---

“Bring the old vanilla game designers back”

Okay good luck with that lol
---
i'm gonna miss the dungeon maps they added in cata. they were so usefull and beautifull to , with art work on the sides and stuff.
---
I wish people would stop posting this shit.
---
Something about this makes me extremely uncomfortable.
---
leveling is a big part of classic so enjoy it if u can. unless ofc u want to hardcore raid be first in everything then rush.
---
I'm saying Swedes, actual players. The majority of swedes do not want to play in Swedish guilds.
---
That's why i want another poll. If anything i feel like people will avoid Gehennas because of this claim.
---
DENTAL PLAN!
---
You'd think so. Hasn't been the case for OSRS though, where it took them 6 years to start doing that.
---
So you telling me that 30/0/21 and 29/11/11 druids doesn't esixt?
---
It’s 10 days for *1.5* levels of rest, I believe. Which would mean 400 days of rest to level only on rested xp.
---
No you determine who to mail things to based on the character's name.
---
I didn't say it was actually going to happen, just my thoughts on what is best for the game.
---
No. Wow is the way it is now because blizz listened to the community too much
---
Dave Chappelle and Robin Williams are two celebrities I know that used to play a lot of WoW. I was briefly in a guild with the guitarist of I think it was Amon Amarth a decently famous metalband. So there's bound to be alot of them around
---
Help with what? This is exactly the type of thing you should be picking yourself
---
Just look at that character above!
---
She reminds something, isn't she? That character is from first season, episode 15, which was aired on 20 June 1992.
---
7. Nature magic and connection with forces of Nature
---
8. Night Elves venerate to Elune, Goddess of the Moon, and that character from Sailor MOON, anime in which Moon theme are very important
---
I have no doubt that artist, who made concept of Night Elves (Samwise Didier?), was inspired by that Sailor Moon character, Petasos. But anyway, I want to see official confirmation of that, so question for Blizzard is: 
---
Are Night Elves was inspired by Sailor Moon character, Petasos demon from 15 episode?
---
Even if they say no, or not remember where is source of inspiration, it is insanely next to impossible that such constellation of affinities of Petasos and Night Elves is just play of chance. That way, probably Samwise or his colleague saw Petasos out of the tail of his eye just by a moment and character sketch was remembered by subconscious. And if they didn't see Petasos at all, they can took conception from informational dimension where it was already materialised (how that mind technology works is another topic but you may know that many things were invented simultaneous and "independently").
---
P.S. My previous post was removed by automoderator after few experiments when I tried to show image in newsfeed.
---
I reserved names for Alliance on Herod. Keep an eye out for a gnome rogue named Folsom, or gnome warrior named Culldozer.
---
It's going to be your he flattest Azeroth...
---
Man as a warrior I always know it's going to be like a 20 minute intermission at least if I want to get my spells every 2 levels
---
&gt;You don’t charge players for testing your game dude
---
Yeah you do and folks do it gladly for you. Early access and all that shit
---
Don't try to steal my gains with your social shenanigans.
---
It did during stress test, but I think only until 40ish
---
Yea, because Blizzard would release TBC and erase Classic again.
---
Do you honestly believe this? It's literally one of the dumbest ideas i've ever heard, there is a zero percent chance that Blizzard would ever do that after all the work they just put into Classic.
---
Fuck that, I've always enjoyed rolling new classes. Gimme day fresh class feel
---
If only you weren't forced to use this UI.
---
I thought i deleted it as soon as i post it
---
As an undead rogue myself I will probably just go for the Alterac Wolf or if I'm crazy enough the rank 11 one. Both seem easier or at least more fun to obtain than grinding the org rep.
---
Also of your not getting UC rep your mount at 40 will be slightly more expensive unless you can also get honored with UC even tho you skipped all the early quests and cant really go back for full rep later.
---
The 2 mage looking boxes on both sides look awesome! What is it for and anyway i can just that part? would be awesome for my undead mage
---
By far I haven't used threat plates in awhile I switched to Kui and now plater.
---
I've also always loved rolling other classes but this really feels different!
---
I've experienced honor without bg on private: it will be hell for anyone in the 47-60 range.
---
My advice : don't even log in, you'll be farmed from the fp to every quest hub / access to the high level zones.
---
Imo it's really stupid to release hobor without bg, each player who isn't 60 yet will just stop the game
---
it's not about how old you are but how old you act. i hope classic will be nothing like retail in that regard but i bet it will be.
---
They switched to Gehennas from Shazzrah
---
I feel the opposite. I have some good memories with my original tauren hunter, and to simply remake him would be disrespectful. I'll always have memories playing as him, and now I can make more on a new character.
---
I never knew where Mankriks wife was until it became a meme.  I do remember always getting the quest "consumed by hatred" from Mankrik though, and never finishing the 60 quilboar kills.
---
But even the dudes from &lt;My little e-peen&gt; did it.
---
I understand your point. But it's still huge difference for me.
---
What are you going to get a half of a level of xp in 3.3 days, play for a half hour, and log off again?
---
That isn't "what you're doing". You'll just be playing the game when you can and whatever rested xp you get is what you'll have.
---
Hahahaha
---
My first character ever was a UD Female Mage, I chose the cross patter leather as a cosmetic and I don't remember ever regretting it.  But now I have sat at the character creator and in the world in different lighting locations checking over and over to see which face looks better. Do I stick with the cross patter? Or do I leave her with eyes this time around?  
---
Everything else about the character I have settled on happily, it is this last choice that taunts me and I have less than a week now to figure it out!   
---
Do you like the cross pattern? Hate it? Any advantages to glowing eyes over the cross I am not thinking of? etc.  
---
Pleas help a fellow player rationalize out a choice!
---
Just play a night elf. There will be a million dwarf priests.
---
I really don't trust the players to make good decisions. I play a lot of OSRS and people are constantly voting for "quality of life" changes that make the game easier.
---
Or just fix game breaking bugs
---
Not saying I wouldn't play it, but I think it would be far more interesting to see new content adhering to vanilla design principles. But business is business, and it's cheaper for Activision to re-release the expansions because they know people will play it.
---
How Many Layers Should We Exspect For Each Server On Launch ?
---
Large is already showing out of stock for me
---
Well than that’s obvious, 99% of us classic players would agree with that
---
I feel like they’ll release TBC servers and possibly allow you to copy your character over **once** and progress from there. Maybe even allow a free race/faction change for the new races/class combos. 
---
I’m not sure they could do it any other way than this without pissing off literally everyone.
---
Listening to the community is a double edged blade.  The community can be really spot on with some things but then depending who participates, can introduce bad things as well, or support ideas that seem good initially then end up bad.  
---
In saying that, you still need to take the community into account when making any additions or changes.
---
As an alliance, I can't wait to go in there to do Ragefire Chasm!
---
&gt;they will release TBC and Classic will be gone again.
---
Nailed it.  If Blizzard releases subsequent expansions on top of classic, we lose classic again - and what we all came here for will again be lost.  I'm open to new classic content, as along as it is parallel content that does not increase the level cap, rebalance classes, or reset gear in any way.
---
Sold
---
Ha yeah was mostly a joke, honestly the holding head together is a much better head canon. I've always been torn on the cross straps, I do like the look but I was hesitant to want them on my character forever
---
WoW is the the most popular MMORPG of all-time, it has existed since 2004 and still continues to release new expansions. The modern version is called “Live / Retail / BFA”.
---
Many players feel like the modern game is too far detached from the core gameplay and have left the game entirely. And that’s how we’re back here with the relaunched of the original WoW Classic (with no expansions), which is releasing in 6 days.
---
A MMORPG is an always-online experience, where you choose a character to level up and explore a massive virtual world with alike players.
---
You don't need Quality of Life if you have no life!
---
My point is that engineering consumes are still sold on the ah anyway.
---
Probably, from the middle phase towards the end they will probably start actively working on releasing info for the next retail expansion with the claim of feedback from retail and classic. To be released probably 2-8 months after the final phase. Can also see them alternating expansions and Classic expansion servers.
---

---
Flying mounts are amazing?
---
If you start adding new content for vanilla it's basically like aiming a gun at BFA. You are competing against yourself.
---
Listening to the community is a double edged blade. The community can be really spot on with some things but then depending who participates, can introduce bad things as well, or support ideas that seem good initially then end up bad.
---
After seeing how immature and dumb so many players in this community are I don’t want them voting on anything
---
They did it once already...
---
Big brain here has your back ^^
---
Cool kinda what I figured some D&amp;D influence. Dark elf+Wood elf with afew extra feet height lol.
---
BfA has us killing an Old God's minion, Vanilla has us killing the actual Old God.
---
WoW classics impending release is making me work harder than ever before trying to get ahead of my deadlines to allow myself time to play during the first week or two
---
Those all have alternative revenue streams like cash shops or cosmetics, you want those for classic? Bad idea
---
It’s only 15 a month, that’s nothing, this whining is how you get annoying p2w games btw
---
Moonglade yo
---
Exactly. As someone who started in BFA, I found it so overwhelming how much I had to worry about and learn. Maybe it's simple from one expansion to the next, but adding one small thing each expansion makes it very complex to a new player after 15 years.
---
I've come from an even more grind heavy game (runescape), so i'm okay with everything being slower paced but simplicity is appealing when done well and I really enjoyed the bit of classic that i've played.
---
Dwarf priest has fear ward which is going to be wanted and probably chosen over a nelf.
---
Yeah but then you have to go two places to ah and train.
---
Nah man, leveling as any class is way harder with another person helping you.
---
Like after Bungie lost Halo.  It lost a lot of its mystery and character after that.
---
I knew wow was heading in the wrong direction with TBC with flying mounts and the way the design was heading. By Wrath it was all over for me playing wow. Vanilla had the best and most simple but intuitive design, both aesthetically and mechanically.
---
The game will 100% die off if they don't do classic+ with community in mind.  Listening to the community got us Classic in the first place.
---
Glowing eyes can look really good with helmets that show eyes. My planned alt is UD female and I would previously have gone for the hollow eyes but this time I will do glowing eyes.
---
Classic wowhead doesn't show up for me in other search engines
---
Ugh, NA private server players *shudder*.  Has there ever been a group of more racist inbread people ever in the history of the internet?
---
That's why I like going with a supermajority vote. That doesn't necessarily mean that the questions need to have 75% yes votes like Old School Runescape - Blizzard could alter it so that questions require 80 or even 85% yes votes. Then only the changes that essentially everyone wants would pass.
---
blue=poo
---
MT and holy priest :)
---
Thanks. Other people are saying it's better to level as fury until either 30 or 40, and then re-spec, at which point the above question becomes irrelevant. Looks like it is a topic on which nobody agrees!
---
Lava?
---
Celine Dion?
---
"we made them purple for some reason" — that reason explained above :)  
---
And it would be realy hard to admit ahead of big audience of geeks that their well known characters were inspired by Sailor Moon, which mostly perceives as cartoon for little girls (which is not truth at all)
---
Well, the discs aren't really, since they'll install the old client.
---
But they sure are pretty.
---
I'm rolling warlock  which I had as main back then but this time I go horde instead of Alliance. 
---
Rolling with the feel how much I've improved since last time so if people see it as I'm being disrespectful to my old self I truly might be because being 15 years old in wow sure was painful at some point, knowing today that I can do so much better. That's my view on it. Played different classes on vary of projects but warlock is what I find as my true self in vanilla experience.
---
Nice one, troll.
---
These are my thoughts exactly
---
Just be careful, a couple of items on there for pre-raid include dire maul blues. A lot of people thought DM would be in phase 1 but it wont be until phase 2. Hence the pre-raid 1/2 buttons, if you're going hard from the start plan on getting the gear in the 1 tab.
---
Bruh, you're activation key is there for all of reddit to see.
---

---
Not a macro. Might be Healbot.
---
Also think you might mean HoT not DoT.
---
Yea maybe not low pop, but you can be sure they'll be some mediums.  Blizzard doesn't want completely full realms at any point in time.
---
diabolical...
---
For anyone curious about other classes, Wowhead and Icy Veins have a Classic section, both have bis lists.
---
Yeah 75%+ would probably work pretty well.  That way hardcore players would have a say and it wouldn't be easy for casuals to implement casual changes.
---
all classes will suffer from that "problem" it's like 40% of the reason we want to play classic.

How many rogues does it take to kill a Paladin?
---
2.
---
One to attack him, and one to wait in the ironforge inn to finish him off.
---
Thx mate! Always nice with info like this!
---
Hi!
---
I´m 100% certain that in vanilla Feral Instict was not needed if your are Night elf for having a greater stealth against rouges. Rouges however have a talent called "Master of deception" which increases there stealth enough to be on par with a nightelf. I would advice you to take Feral instinct if you want to counter rouges or (especially in duels).
---
I´m 90% certain that in vanilla Thick hide applied before the bearform multiplier. This is why you can cap your armor as a bear tank.
---
Yes, but that opens the door for someone to steal your account...
---

---
I heard Robin Williams isn’t coming back for classic. If he does he’s playing an undead I’m guessing.
---
Ok.do your gripe is skill level so we should ban everything but a 2 button mouse and basic keyboard because anything else makes it easier negating their skill and effort
---
Same with the the ah dont have any spreadsheets or anything written down because you have an advantage over those who dont use them and just remember negating their skill and effot
---
Or are just a hypocrite and are only bothered when someone has an advantage over you?
---
nah. wasnt sam a fan of anime?
---
full = cant create characters unless you already have one there.
---
Surely he will join the Alliance.
---
I'm a coalition of one man, beat that.
---
No they won't, but i would like to be proven wrong, average /played to reach 60 is 30 days, thats 30x24h. Sure it can be done faster but the world record says 4 days i believe. Thats 4x24h. So unless they beat world record I don't see it happening friday or saturday.
---
Although small, there is also a level requirement in order to vote in a poll on Old School Runescape. Something like only allowing accounts with max level characters to vote would stop a lot of 'casuals' from casting their votes early on.
---
&gt;I don't lose out on the utility of using the address bar for google searches, which is something I use constantly.

Neither do you in this case. If you watch the video until the end you will notice that you have to lead your search by a key term, in this case "wowc" for it to search through wowhead
---
Just too much affinities in one character with Night Elves for saying that Petasos isn't main source of inspiration. And remember! They both connected with Moon (Petasos from Sailor Moon and Night Elves venerate to Elune, Goddess of the Moon).
---
&gt; Yeah its not like you can go to a vendor and buy these,
---
You can however just go to the AH and buy these.
---
This approach worked for RuneScape though?
---
TBC is *inevitable* if Classic succeeds, which it currently seems to be on track to do. It's free money. They'd be absolutely retarded not to re-release the most popular expansion.
---
Again, then you don’t understand the value of it
---
Exactly my point, thanks for the backup here ^^
---
As someone moving to Horde from Alliance this time round, this is extremely useful. Thank you
---
i got the other way around.. old name worked but not new 🙈
---
It's not 2005 anymore !
---
This one is pretty good!
---
https://youtu.be/MFZuhtcjRDQ
---
Yeah, this is much more accurate.
---
No. The game devs was able to create Vanilla WoW without asking the community. The new devs can too hopefully. People gravitate towards path of least resistance, and soon we will be having LFD and all the other game ruining systems retail offers.
---
Yeah, been playing years on pservers and can't remember many time anyone unleashing a mechanical chicken on me or used a rocket helmet. It's cool trinkets for sure but most people won't bother.
---
I'm really no theorycrafting expert but isn't the armor just multiplied ontop of eachother? So that the product is the same either way you do it: 
---
Armor \* thickhide \* bearmultiplier = Armor \* bearmultiplier \* thickhide
---
Edits like this may have been doable on private servers, but they are bannable in Classic. Make sure that you read over the TOS and if in doubt ask on the official forums.
---
Drip drip
---
I know the feeling. I was a main mage for many years and not being a main mage this times feels like it's not really what I am in WoW... Might change my mind still.
---
Please, no. Playing WoW doesn't make him a good actor.
---
Surprised you werent down voted. Honestly people are acting like the game is out already when it isnt. Im not a hater btw i cant wait for classic but lets just be real and base out shit memes on facts.
---
No, its not inevitable not sure why peoplesaythis.
---
Also, the runescape polls aren't pure democracy. You need a certain amount of votes before they are considered and a high percentage.
---
Don't worry, it's Sweden's turn to move next, then we will move to the 6th PVP server.
---
Cross realm was the big one, phasing etc.
---
Killed the personal touch of world PvP as you rarely ever encounter the same people anymore.
---
Thats kind of my point.
---
I still have the same computer from 2007...
---
Why would you create characters on multiple servers in the first place tho?
---
Good to know, I will try a bit of everything, see what feels good at the start, I will be trying to get in at the start so I doubt anything is going to go fast until I can get out of the sub 10 zone.
---
Yeah, the horde don't have fear ward and the priests there are doing fine.
---
check his insta story for today.
---
Any chance you have a cheat sheet for rogues?
---
Rogue's auto attack damage is a large portion of their dps. More hit helps with that.
---
Unite the tribes /bagpipesplay.
---
Check out Prologue by Eluveitie!
---
So you're telling me there's a chance?
---
How dare you compare the best beverage to bfa. Water is l33t gaming juice in every form. Bfa is the juice that drops out of the bottom of a dumpster
---
Never tell me the odds
---
&gt; Does it depends on taste heavily?
---
of course. some people are not interested in that experience at all.
---
&gt; There will be a million dwarf priests.
---
not really
---
not even pservers had that many
---
If you go Night Elf and you are spec'd Holy/Disc for healing then you can still use Starshards to farm mobs/gold. 
---
It's basically like having mind-flay for free and will make your day to day farming much easier without having to respec.
---
Shit loads of people have replied sayin "thanks" or "I didnt know this" or "crap I took the wrong day off work."
---
Is pally leveling really that bad? I’m playing alliance for the first time, and I love tanking (which is why I’m thinking warrior). 
---
I love the lore and aesthetics of paladins, but I’m hesitating to switch from warrior because pally leveling looks so damn BORING. Is it really just autoattacking for 60 levels?
---
Alliance.
---
\- farming Silithus texts
---
\- farming the demonic runes and felcloth in Felwood
---
\- farming burning elementals in Felwood
---
\- doing rock elementals and fire elementals in Badlands and Arathi Highlands
---
\- lasher farm 
---
 Just from the top of my head. All doable as a priest, shaman, druid, warrior, enhancement shaman.
---
But not recommended, because these classes do so much better when synergizing with their counter parts.
---
Yeah, I am very curious how common devilsaur leather is going to be too.
---
Sweden said that and they do not speak on behalf of Norway and Denmark.
---
This is fantastically useful, thank you kindly :)
---
You are obviously in a state of denial. Can't you see? You are addicted to reddit.
---
Is he interested in possibly selling some? I wanted to buy a similar banner off the WoW Movie Prop Auction that happened in June..but each banner went waaaaaay over my budget.
---
I played the stresstest and did name reservation. I just thought it would be nice to be able to make sure my bars were right before release. I didn't realize this would make so many people so mad.
---
Hmmm nah. Not really. not when everyone is undergeared and pushing. Private servers have the raid data all wrong, so don't go off your experience of them.
---
Don't tell me what to do!
---
I doubt any guild rejected a priest cuz he is a nelf
---
Probably going to be way longer then a hour the first few days
---
Alternatively, be horde and just get that juicy UC repp for the warhorse. Win win.
---
and? you cant seriously compare that to launch...
---
I think you’ve discovered the root of the problem!
---
How many norwegian players in total do you think have left Shazzrah?
---
Even a rough estimate would help,thanks!
---
It took me 20 minutes to make the run via Org.  I'm sure it wasn't the fastest, but if you leave Org through the west exit into the barrens, when you die from the mobs you can spirit res at the crossroads.  Then from crossroads you can run the rest of the way to mulgore.
---
That's why I will farm the WinterSpring Frostsaber instead. Still months of farm but at least, it's not RNG.
---
You both have points about different things. Yes grenades sell on AH. Yes you will need to sacrifice another profession to use them.
---
"*I've got balls of steel.*"

his bnet client is in EU (as in, he's got the date in the right format) so he'll be playing at home. Wonder where he'll roll..
---
Icy Veins lists alternatives to Frozen Wrath pieces
---
Feral being good pvp is a laugh. Balance is ok if u moonfire spam someone at Max range.
---
I kind of want people to believe druids are good so we end up with more healers though
---
I played a warlock for vanilla raiding, and now will play a priest.  Swapsies?
---
I don't think they'd be devastating, just thought it would be nice.
---
combat swords is recommended for leveling, correct? Is it still viable for world PvP. I plan on doing ganking while leveling and i'm not sure if i want to go swords or daggers yet
---
While I agree, I prefer my water chilled.
---
What about the defias mask
---
Remorseless attacks isn't very strong for combat, so no, you don't.
---
Good deal lol. You have to get the expendable time pak cartridge that goes on top. It’s the only way it will work.
---
Streamers in Blizzards ‘Good books’ say positive things about Blizzard games.
---
How is this surprising?
---
While maybe not directly paid by Blizzard  if they’re consistently tearing it down they might just be left off the Streamer privilege list.
---
I wanted this printed out on a poster lol
---
No one will change anything like that, it would be NOT CLASSIC. Go play PvE. End of story.
---
well yes, but actually no :)
---
&gt; For all we know they could open another handful of servers on launch day, or something.
---
I have no doubt. There will 100% be servers going up after release. probably in the first 24 hours
---
If the mob dies quickly then don't use it, if it will survive for the majority of the duration then use it.
---
Yeah, people shouldn't follow this "cheat sheet", it's straight up bad.
---
Don't know which server I will play on.
---
Is there an option to track guild members? Just like the class only option.
---
Aye ATL what's up
---
True strike shoulders, good luck getting those
---
bars, raid frames, addon settings sometimes are character specific though right? Just thought it would be a nice.
---
Druids are like the worst class in vanilla. Feral and balance are not good options for pvp or for raids. They can do quests well though.
---
I don't know if it was ever possible to have a macro that did as your describing without the help of an addon.  But I came across a site that describes exactly what you want to accomplish using a macro and an addon.   [https://www.briankoponen.com/vanilla-world-warcraft-druid-macros/](https://www.briankoponen.com/vanilla-world-warcraft-druid-macros/) 
---
It's for Vanilla wow, client version 1.12.  Maybe it can work for 1.13.2, (classic wow), maybe it won't.
---
My response was a response to the sub level 10 comment
---
 * Shadow Bolt Rank 1 has a 1.7s cast time
---
 * Shadow Bolt Rank 2 (level 6) has a 2.2s cast time
---
 * Corruption has a 2s cast time (no talents before level 10) and ticks after 3 seconds (5 seconds total)
---
Before level 10, if you have to fight to tag a mob, corruption is useless. Immolate might be the tool we have.
---
And if you don't have to fight for mobs, I will prefer the "not being attacked while my first Shadow Bolt flies" any time over a dot (again, before level 10, with the week enemies there).
---
IMO they should re release TBC and WoTLK maybe a year or less after the previous release but make it so that each option is viable onto itself. So that there would be a way to play only Classic and/or play Classic all the way through to TBC and/or WoTLK. 
---
Then work on a 4th expansion (after WoTLK) that is the new retail and doesn't go down the previous path.
---
Druid ?
---
Shoot they should let us login and knock out the starter zone too
---
You can get almost 4k through revered, so "not even remotely close" is objectively wrong. Granted, you're still 17k away but that's a lot closer than not
---
As a new player myself, I appreciate this. ily?
---
If blizz lets the community vote for content it will be the beginning of the end. It'll evolve into the turd of a game that retail is now
---
I see lots of posts here talking about how toxic pserver community is, which I honestly dont understand. I think you guys have prejudice towards those people for no particular reason whatsoever. Its exactly this behavior, you are showing us here right now, that makes the community toxic in my humble opinion. 90% people I have encountered on pservers were always very friendly and patient people
---
Yeah, this is pretty bad. It looks exactly like a poorly thought up talent tree I saw someone post a few days back.
---
&gt;The use of democracy is to keep running the same system.  
---
&gt;Anything revolutionary or innovative requires dictatorship.
---
Not fundamentally, no.
---
&gt; Therefore introducing a voting system wouldn’t do shit to the game 
---
Like in osrs, right? Point is, you're wrong.
---
It also wouldn't be a democracy, since the devs are the ones presenting the changes, requiring (ideally) 25-15% vote by the community to veto.
---
Hit me with a game credit blizz!
---
He's a swedish streamer who last I heard wasn't going to play classic wow.
---
Green/Grey quests seem pretty pointless then... I'd better not follow up on any of them and instead just abandon them.
---
Haha searing pain spam. Best TPS, however, of course death. Goodtimes.
---
Nice.  Would support that.
---
Make sure to tell everyone about Sinterklaas, Zwarte Pete and salted licorice
---
Such a tryhard using Elvui for levelling 🤣
---
people : money is super important in classic and you need to do everything you can to save up as much as possible
---
also people : throw money away (literally, grenades) to kill other people
---
ill pass
---
Kek no.
---
www.shadowpanther.net has everything you're asking
---
Old school horde here, it's been so long since I've played the game in its original state that having a refresher is nice.
---
Vanilla wow is beautiful. 
---
It’s like a beautiful lady. The ones who have a beauty without all the makeup are the most beautiful of all.
---
When did they add DR? Or is it just that not everything shares a DR
---
Ping difference between east coast and west coast is 30-40. It's not really significant.
---
There is still too much space for flying players to avoid each other. Compare this to a choke point in a zone. Flying was neat but it definitely removed most danger from the world while making it feel much smaller.
---
I don't think it's even close to 30 days. More like 10-12 these days when people know roughly what they're doing but aren't trying to level as fast as possible. This includes some being afk, leveling professions, socializing etc...
---
I personally believe that the Classic WoW trailer would have been the best had it stayed mostly the same as it currently is, but instead of starting the Vanilla trailer at the Dwarf (and have it artificially sped up for some reason), start the Vanilla cinematic at the rifle \*click\* sound effect. That was the part of the Vanilla cinematic that really got going and would have made an excellent starting point to continue the rest of the cinematic from.
---
Some people like to compete for top dps and hunters can't really do that. I love them as a class but you have to accept reality.
---
Just make your own guild (like korn) and just kick any beggers.
---
Nah. They’re probably gonna fill these two *and* need to make more servers.
---
The office and WoW. Name a more iconic duo.
---
Imagine going on a PvP server expecting to not PvP
---
I have done this a few times, so I’m guessing it’ll be between 7-10 days /played depending on how distracted I get. So, maybe two months :(

5 man multiboxing. No looking for new memebears. 100% chance you getting it.
---
If only you could get orb from the run, it would be worth it. Well, then again, dont think you would have to worry about AD rep for NAXX attunement.
---
You know as well as I that the world is not in black and white.   
---
There are nuances.
---
And just like Blizzard saw decursive as too botty, I see TSM as too botty.
---
And I would advocate against voice chat between alliance and horde. 
---
See how there is a nuance in voice chat already?
---
its very similar. and so is the gameplay so definitely check it out. it's even included in the classic subscription
---
I think you are correct, you can't always play with 100% efficiency.
---
What iqsixsixsix said. BUT, I personally hope they go the OSRS route and release new content with Classic in mind.
---
Ohh well that is a difficult decision.
---
BFA is still played by millions so it can't be as bad as a lot of People make it out to be in this reddit.
---
It is just very different from Classic. And People in this Reddit will always lean towards Classic.
---
I would say that Classic is definitely easier to get into then BFA and Classic already is quite complex. 
---
BFA has advanced by 6 Expansions so it has a lot of added Systems and ways to entertain you. 
---
While Classic is a bit more puristic. Not as many things to do (compared to BFA) but those things take longer, more effort and are therefore Feeling much more rewarding. 
---
But it is a case of opinion and what you want to get out of your game. I feel like BFA is a much better Option for Players that don't have as much time but still want to experience most aspects of the game. 
---
While Classic will take a bit more time Investment in order to expirience everything.
---
&gt;Nope, only through flight paths. The Horde has no equivalent of the Stormwind/Ironforge tram. 
---
Surely that's the Org/UC zeppelin? TB is just the left out Horde capital, like Darnassus for the Alliance.

Shit man, so much nostalgia
---
World PvP was dead in TBC.  Stop lying to yourself.
---
 a quest add on basically modifies the map and marks where to go for all the quests. No reading or thought required. 
---
As for addon recommendations, all I would suggest for starting would be:
---
1.) Bartender4 (this does away with the default UI that takes up half the screen, and replaces it with a fully customizable interface) - if you like the default UI by all means this one is skip able
---
2.) Castbar addon that shows your latency/ping this tells you when you press your ability again for the server to register it. 
---
3.) Party/Raid frames - if I’m healing, I HATE the default frames. I use: https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info4673-PerfectRaid.html
---
The other guy covered roles really well. My suggestion would be to pick a class fantasy you enjoy (e.g do you like nature? Druid or Shaman, Do you like all things demonic? warlock, do you enjoy being a sneaky mofo? rogue)
---
I'm an EU scrub
---
don't you have phones?!
---
I do hope you are correct, for me it will probably take 5 days longer.
---
I feel the opposite, I have very strong memories of my Hunters back in the day(one of every classic and TBC race, and then several more at each battle ground bracket) .
---
So my only rule with classic is no hunters. I want to preserve the memories of what I happened with them. Either I won't be able to live up to past glories, or I'll exceed them either way, it would leave the memory less than what it was.
---
With a few very minor tweaks, scale and some added datasets, it is.
---
Don't you dare speak this into existence.
---
Yea I remember trying to convince my parents to use their credit card. It took some time but man was it worth it. I think the ROI for wow was the best for me.
---
I'm rushing the first character, enjoying the second.
---
No way I'm going into STV 2 months after launch on a PvP server without a 60 parked nearby.
---
I've already seen everything Classic has to offer, though and I'm still going to play it.
---
Anyone know if you Will be able to change server for like 15 euro? I know you used to be able to do this back in the days, would be a Nice insurance against dead servers
---
Link appears dead. Is it just me?

ZUG ZUG

---
Ive been raiding on RP servers since vanilla(catalyst feathermoon)(bloodrite thorium brotherhood) to Wyrmrest accord(epoch)/taking a break for classic.
---
There just isn’t the same pool of players available and recruiting good players to come to a server with one CE guild is very difficult.
---
I did too! Sober, I'll see you fellas out there.
---
Any chance on a sweet alliance one with a gnome lock? You’d get at least one karma from me for it.
---
https://i.imgur.com/ItZXeBr.jpg
---
Skin things and vendor them.
---
According to the ClassicCastbars page: "Blizzard removed the abilit to distinguish between spell ranks in the combat log, so now cast times are always based on the highest rank".
---
The addon seems to work like how you described Quartz?
---
For those who don't know, that's his son.   
---
They've set it up to spice things up a little and make people laugh.   
---
Good on 'em I say :D
---
Imagine being a jerk, ruining the level experience for another player. When leveling, its not ok. When traveling, thats another. Countless of times has red ridge been slaughtered by horde players. I cant even return my quest. Thats a jerk, no offence, but those who’d do that are jerks
---
Everything depends on how much you can play, but ingame /played should be around the same for most players.
---
This is me. I'm not getting anything done at work at all. I'm just sitting here refreshing reddit and checking classic discords. LET ME IIIIIIN
---
LET'S GO WI-LD
---
Gracias! le echo un vistazo!!!
---
Yeah, I think they should release WotLK and then TBC afterwards.
---
For the horde!
---
Seriously cool flag tho
---
Not those mines. I'm taking about the invisible landmines that the early version had.
---
One can hope lol
---
??? because poors and rednecks play horde?
---
JOEL! 4 stam 4 strenght leather belt, level 18, UGHH! AGHHH
---
My first 60 was 19d20h. This was played from one day after release so me and most others were complete noobs and I tool a lot of time exploring. 34 days seems extremely long even considering it was in 2k4. I still feel like a lot of people underestimate leveling time though. I aim at 9d played in 8 weeks real time.
---
Where are your parents?
---
Classic has a community where you have an established name and reputation. The game has a lot less QoL than retail (no dungeon/raid finder, no AoE looting). The game is also a lot harder. Getting to max lvl (60) takes months of effort and it's a journey. Mobs are harder so you have to think about your actions rather than just running into a pack of 10 mobs and wiping them without fear of death. For some classes pulling more than 1 or 2 mobs means you will die unless you get lucky RNG or you really use your abilities and potions to the max. Not all classes/specs are viable for raids. There are a lot more RPG elements than retail, such as talent trees, weapon skills, unique stats on gear, reagents for certain spells. Gold is much harder to come by, so when you buy your mount at lvl 40, and your epic at 60, it feels like you've earned it. There's no flying mounts so the world feels a lot bigger. Cataclysm ruined the original world so you're getting the best version of Azeroth with a better engine for more graphical fidelity. For me, the biggest thing, is the community. It's going to feel like a World again. I've been playing MMOs since 1997 when UO was released. I played that until I went to DAoC and played that until WoW came out in 2004. I played WoW until the end of WoTLK hardcore and casually afterwards. The game fell apart after the end of WoTLK because the devs lost sight of what it means to play a true MMO. If you've only played WoW from MOP and beyond, you have NO idea what a true MMO is like. You definitely need to check it out. It's going to seem more difficult, but that is why it is so great, because there's a sense of accomplishment when you put in actual effort and get a reward, rather than the slot machine rewards that is retail.
---
Great success. Where you raiding in classic?
---
The way the player is treated by the entire world, be it quest givers or regular NPCs, is much different in classic than it is in BfA, that's the point.
---
Hi, /u/woopydalan

---
try and get that pane of glass!!!!
---
I am not denying it. Maybe you misunderstood what I meant? How did you come to the conclusion that I am a griefer?
---
Now, there's a difference between ganking and griefing. I don't corpse-camp for an hour, and never will. And I never said I gank people that are way below my level. Sure, if I hang around in STV and come across a lowbie, I'd probably gank him, because why not? It's a contested territory and there are players from my faction there who I'd like to "help" and "protect".
---
You may say I am backtracking now, I'm not, you took my main comment and blew it out of proportions. Many players have experienced what you have, but abandoning your character forever seems a little more than just frustration?
---
When you pick a PVP server, you instantly have a target on your back. Don't expect fairness and honorable players in a competitive game.
---
Get mining and save everything on an alt. When ppl reach 60 the demand for ore and stone etc is going to sky rocket due to all serious players choosing Engi as profession.
---
When BC came out I was at a Hollywood GameStop in line for the midnight release and Mika Kunis showed up to meet the guys in front of me, they were her guildmates. I didn’t know she was into the game at the time and it exploded my brain a bit. She bought two copies because she was getting one for Macaulay Culkin who she was dating at the time.
---
If you're combat, and spec the 5% hit as well as 6 weapon skill, you only need 1% hit from other sources to cap yellow attacks. That said, white hits are of course a big thing still.
---
Took me 21 days played to get to 60, I was along for the ride.
---
You can't get def cap with pre raid gear tho.
---
I don't know much about the new lore since MOP, what has been added into Legion/BFA that makes the lore falling apart for the past event ? It seems.. Weird ?
---
Also when you go outside, you see plates. Crazy world we live in.
---
Ehh, that early on the vendors are going to give you next to nothing. But skinning and mining are fairly simple because those are both going to be encountered as you quest. Sell in AH for a decent profit.
---
The Profit $keram
---
Well yeah, he's been taking us for a ride this whole time...
---
I want someone with musical talent to perform this on day twelve.
---
that is a great idea actually!
---
Reminds me of that SrGrafo piece.
---
This is a whole lotta effort for a shitpost lul
---
I cringed so hard. I feel sorry for your parents.
---
Nuance is important
---
The only class slower for leveling is warrior, which is the slowest. No self healing (that makes a difference), so bandages and sitting down for food every time you get low enough. Which dumps all your excess rage since you aren't in combat. Charge is your only "movement boosting" skill, so youre running at normal speed until 40 if you manage to scrape up enough gold for a mount as soon as you get there. If you want to go at a decent pace as a warrior, you kind of need a friend.
---
Yeah, okay. Are you 12 years old?
---
Let me tell you how it is: you have no idea what you're talking about and you're pulling numbers out of your ass, reinforcing your own statement with an extremely shitty and blatant master suppression technique. Stop pretending like you have any idea of what the 'majority' or '99%' of Swedes want to do, because you quite frankly have no fucking clue, *because these statistics don't even fucking exist.*
---
I do not pull numbers out of my ass and try to convince people about it. I can only speak for my own experiences. But every Swede I know that wants to play WoW wants to play with swedes and/or their friends. As in, for the most part, other Swedes.
---
I do not doubt that some swedes prefer to play with people from other nationalities, because I'm sure that's true. But 99% of them? Nah.
---
Fresh start. It’s your chance to do everything differently. Go for it.
---
And no, I feel compelled to do the opposite of last time.
---
Mouths moved so effing weird in WC3.
---
Already hacked his bank account and stole his identity.
---
The one truly best MMORPG from 15 years ago is re-launching in the current engine.  
---
For a lot of players this was one of the best, or maybe  THE best WoW game ever released.
---
This game was the foundation for many upcoming mmorpg but never did one grow as big as this one.  
---
So its a big deal :D
---
I'm on Herod so If I get in with less than 4 hour queue I'll be happy.
---
You can run a sandboxed world with no npcs, quests, stats, talents.. No nothing! But, it will let you enter the game, move around and setup your addons (for the most part).
---
One example is www.arctium.io, which will allow you to start such a sandbox world and give you a launcher file (.exe file that goes into the wow folder, next to the normal launcher).
---
I did it yesterday, just Google around a bit (don't have time for in depth description now, sorry)
---
As someone who leveled Horde back in vanilla, I assure you it happened all the time.  Right along side all the killing of the flight masters they could.
---
As a warrior whom plans on tanking I just can’t agree with stacking all that +def gear,  having no hit and the slowest one handed weapons possible.
---
I'll be your friend &lt;3. Were you guys irl buds or did you meet in game?
---
Why speed run it? I mean, it's still a whole week til ww're finally let in. Enjoy the trip, I really love that game. Especially the short Rexxar campaign and most of all the various custom maps! Go wild with them!! There's also still a hosting Website.
---
Early? Skinning, mining, herb. No knowledge required, mine or skim then just list on ah. Later after you have maxed them professions like alchemy, tailoring, etc can make you more but you have to kinnda know how to play the AH.
---
That sounds unrealistic to me even when playing 12h a day.

---
That wont work at all unless you're ready to put in twice the time because you'll be fighting with a lot of competition (get ready for a lot of saly and cancer) .
---
Other than that you won't miss much except rep
---
The rareness is part of what makes it prestigious. I'm so confused at this post. Yes it takes a long time. A horrendously long time. And it's RNG. Duh. This has been known. These are the things that make it so awesome, not just being a skeleton horse for alliance, although obviously that's a big deal as well.  
---
Did you just learn how chances and statistics work? Did you just learn how long Strat takes? I am confused as to what promoted this well known fact to be interpreted as never try a thing. That just confuses me and makes me sad on so many levels that someone would think like that. I seriously don't even know where to start with this self-defeating attitude. I am sorry for you.
---
Likely won't happen again, at least on pvp servers where it actually matters. Did it really happen on pvp servers before? I thought it only occured on PvE realms.
---
The nords speak English you know.
---
Heard that too, was very surprised!
---
wait - what?? this is new to me
---
Fastest - Hunter (150 hours) w/ leveling guide
---
Slowest - Warlock (340 hours), pvping, dungeons, exploring, etc
---
I'm hoping for the 41 seconds
---
The only benefit to subscribing early is to reserve a name. Server slots are always 100% first come - first serve. Everyone will wait in the same queue.
---
NO SHIT Sherlock.
---
You also completely missed the point I'm making.
---
AH and bank should be linked, right?
---
I’m in the US so the 26th at 3 pst? Like for sure?
---
Why bother to post if you don’t have a clue of what your going on about?
---
But he reloaded his Arm Guns in mission impossible!
---
FIVE PEOPLE GROOOOOOUPED
---
Here's the link:
---
[https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/leatrix-plus-classic](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/leatrix-plus-classic) 
---
Just enable Show Wowhead Links, it's in the Interface menu.
---
Yeah
---
Dude that's awesome
---
Nada!
---
Yeah not getting new content almost killed OSRS, and they didn't get revived until new content kept going into the game.
---
This is what I was afraid of, if this turns out to be another controversial post I will edit tomorrow and stick to the formula.
---
Im talking with a friend right now and he's talking about the raiding's hes been doing on bfa, he also sent me this link:    
---
https://raider.io/characters/us/azralon/Axoroth  
---
I dont understand anything on it. He said if i starts to play Bfa he can help me with a bunch of stuff. I i do that i'm not learning the game on the proper way, so i maybe play the Classic for more of a ''simple stuff''.
---
World record will be beaten by anyone trying to speed level
---
Nukiko and math class... Two old friends
---
How dare you use a peasants horse to indicate the glorious combat bred good bois of the Horde.
---
Thunder Bluff smells like cow shit
---
Is... Are battlegrounds really phase 3 as in months into the game launching? I feel like they're such an integral part of the vanilla experience and fear that my newly recruited friends may quit before getting a taste of chasing after shifting druids and landing fear bombs
---
#Mankirk need braces!
---
Pretty sure horde scums stay in Orgrimmar/Undercity all the time.
---
So you will be missing alot of "LF1M DPS" dgs/raid groups and people selling/buying things.
---
Doesn't matter if you don't mind the extra journey to Orgrimmar if you want to take the zepplins. Also if you want to trade with someone they'll probably be in Orgrimmar
---
You'll have a great time with any of them, just decide whether u want to do heal or dps, then decide if u want to cast spells with a pet or shoot a gun / bow with a pet =P All the classes are fun in their own unique way. It's gonna be a blast no matter what you choose. Hunter has the best solo play out of the 3 though / Warlock brings the summoning stone which will be a must in any raid group and Resto druids are healers so every1 needs a healer =\]
---
It's very nice, however, if you watch streams of people actually using it, you'll see that they miss, and get resisted all the time.  Some items have really long cool downs, and really only help if you know in advance what your attacking. 
---
It's an extra edge, to pushes you a bit further, if you 100% had to do everything possible to win or top meters regardless of the cost it's a decent way to spend your gold.
---
Myself I don't plan to take it,  If that gimps me, oh well.
---
The biggest thing for me is world PvP. It makes up for the recycled content. Once everyone had flying mounts in TBC it was pretty much dead, no point to revisit the expansion IMO.
---
Never played wsg i guess ?
---
Tailoring / Ench is a good starting choice on release because it synergizes well with humanoid farming, which is already a good source of  character xp/gold by itself.
---
Can't wait to be frustrated about these messages all over again.
---
Won't be able to make the AMA, if someone gets a chance, can you ask any of these questions?
---
* 1) Are there currently any plans to implement paid realm transfers during phase 1? (For the people who are paranoid about ending up on a "dead" server)
---
* 2) What is the last possible minute that players can re-sub to WoW and reserve their character name? (approximately **when** will the servers be taken down in preparation for launch)
---
* 3) Can you explain what specifically "triggers" dynamic respawns of a certain mob / gathering node? As in, is it based on X players in all of elwynn forest, therefore ALL mobs in elwynn forest are spawning at the same heightened rate? Is the map divided into sections, is it based on amount of players within a certain proximity, etc
---
* 3b) if it is based on proximity, is there a cap? Or could you have a raid of 40 players standing on top of a blasted lands herb node, camping it for potentially accelerated black lotus spawns
---
I forget where the fp in Org is
---
The PvP system is going to be the oldschool honor system, right? The grinding is not "grinding honor" but rather a weekly placement vs other players (the more pvp you play, the higher your rank) and the higher your rank, the better gear you get unlocked.
---
Yes all major city AH will be linked.
---
Fo' sho'. Everyone has their own desires and objectives, the point isn't to disparage those who enjoy that kind of thing, but to offer an alternative perspective as the default is considered the rush due to how modern WoW is structured. This could lead to a lot of people defaulting into that mindset not because they enjoy it but because it's what's expected of them in retail. So the point of the thread is just to say "It's ok to take it slow, as it's not like retail and you have more time."
---
We had a mid tier somewhat televised UFC fighter who’s name I wish I could remember now...

nice

You can and should do that as arms too.
---
You take cruelty first then go arms and respec either at 30 for sweeping strikes or at 35 to just trade cruelty for axe spec.
---
My wife and I play together with same composition, she plays priest and I play something tankie. We roll thru areas like no ones business.
---
This same thing happened to a few of my friends and I during beta and stress. But we figured out how to loot rare spawns over and over using this to our advantage so have plans now to farm rare items and be rolling in gold lol!
---
Short answer would be "no".
---
Long answer is pretty much that he isn't doing this professionally so it takes quite a bit of time to do it, and he'd use his limited free time doing it.
---
The material costs are also pretty high for this quality - this banner took around 400€ / $450.
---
The end result is that he would need to ask a lot of money for it to be worth his free time. :D
---
If you level a rogue using anything *but* masks for the head slot you're playing wrong. Get a defias mask, then the tailoring 8st 8agi mask, and that thing is good enough to last till you can do strath for the unforgiven mask.
---
Nice, beside that I made a little userscript that redirects normal wowhead pages to classic.wowhead. This way I don't always have to press the button that leads to the classic version. https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/388448-wowhead-classic-redirect
---
I've moved from Herod &gt; Whitemane &gt; Stalaag &gt; Skeram. I think I'm going to stay put now, though I suspect this server to hit high pop on release.
---
Yea I'd say we have around 50 people atm. Guild will surely expand when winter hits and nobody wants to deal with cold and polar bears.
---
Just move your fucking name your nerd. It's not a commitment lol.
---
This is a lot of good info, thanks. I’ll be referencing this come release!
---
We do have WotF tho
---
it's only a week away...  you can download all the addons and save them in your addon folder.  The bare minimum you need to get started is your camera preference, key bindings, and auto loot?  Plus there will be long lines waiting for quest mobs and quest items just like the stress test was you will have 30 min of downtime to do this like it or not.
---
No, equipping a new weapon resets it. Maybe I could see an application for a macro to swap for a slower weapon for abilities like overpower, but i feel like you'd lose that dps anyway swapping weapons. Better to not bother
---
Nah that's my bad, my memory was off it seems (or my mage buddies have been scamming me).
---
Did vanilla have auction houses in TB and undercity?  I vaguely remember that coming later as a quality of life improvement.
---
The best thing about classic back in the day was being a noob and learning everything. It made the same so much more mysterious and fun. Honestly jump into it and explore and be shit, make mistakes and make new friends it's what it's all about. If you're on EU Gehennas Alliance, /w Artorig, the friendliest priest in town 😎
---
Do you need to ask? Reddit is extremely stupid 90% of the time
---
Both are correct, because time-zones are a thing that exist in this world.
---
No you’re not
---
August 27 00:00gmt

Here, have a a free day, or two, or three of game time added to your account automatically without you even having to ask.
---
Is that for 1.13 or the old Vanilla client on 1.12?
---
Thanks for sharing.
---
I agree, the WoW beta was so much fun and had a great tight-knit community.  You could say I threw away 500 bucks by not selling it, but if I did it all over again, I wouldn't change a thing.
---
I forgot about warlocks having detect invisibility.
---
It's a global launch which has been known for a very long time now.  [https://www.wowclassiccountdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/UI5GHS0013QD1557845843113.jpg](https://www.wowclassiccountdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/UI5GHS0013QD1557845843113.jpg)
---
Even as ret, you can heal dungeons just fine. What I usually do is collect cloth gear from quests to put on when I end up healing, and have a second bar set up with downranked spells. Pretty much just have to watch your mana
---
Takes about two minutes to get your addons setup, you’ll live
---
demonic runes for everyone! free epic mounts yay
---
Ah shit, that's true. Embarrassing.

---
there is no front stabbing in classic, that was a pserver thing
---
Tonnes of whole milk.
---
Considering the nochanges-crowd was as huge as it was, despite numerous sources (and eventually Blizzard) confirming that their definition of Vanilla was private server based, which differs from Retail a lot.
---
See? There you are again with your condescending tone.
---
I'm perfectly fine with me personally finding some aspects of addons and hardware to be in line with the game (like KTM), but others not.   
---
I dont like big\_wigs, TSM, inter faction discords, cross faction collusion for example. Others will disagree and think big\_wigs is totally fine telling me when to run back and forth precise  to the second.
---
Everything that I personally deem to be against the spirit of the game, I'm against.
---
Now it's up to the populace in general to argue for or against it. And I'm an advocate against.
---
1.12. is already the least skillbased patch of classic, don't need to dumb it down further with a plethora of addons playing the game for you.
---
Not just that, but if you play with a too large pool of players it's really hard to have that tight community feel and yeah overcrowded areas suck too.
---
Large caps have some pros too but the negatives outweigh them.
---
Personally.
---
They should keep classic and update it, if they want to cut costs, give us a TBC Phase, where they release bc dungeons and raids but scale them to 60 and scale the gear item levels to 60, with a slight increase from Naxx gear.
---
They already have the tech for this, and it means we keep classic but with new content.
---
No leveling
---
No new spells
---
No new talents
---
To be fair, the "nordic" classic project, should be renamed "Swedish classic project".
---
For the alliance my friend
---
It still helps queues because more people can log in at the intense peak time of launch.
---
I dunno, there are bigger overlying problems in those movie than his acting I think.
---
This one is much better imo (click on equipmnet &amp; enchants at the top)  [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10IV\_3NEmZdhh8iQXrs2Ek77YyUJbjBMWO5UxIWLlZl0/htmlview?usp=sharing&amp;sle=true#](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10IV_3NEmZdhh8iQXrs2Ek77YyUJbjBMWO5UxIWLlZl0/htmlview?usp=sharing&amp;sle=true#)
---
I have a Gigabit Internet connection.  When I downloaded Classic, i averaged 600 Mbps, and it took me roughly 3 minutes to have it fully downloaded.  It's not big, compared to retail, but it certainly isn't small.
---
Also note he has two accounts
---
you got dethroned, now change your name peasant Mangly
---
You must have some major issues to go off like this to someone just asking a question. Go outside friend, breath the fresh air and chill
---
Also, fuck raider io... It's a garbage metric for this. It won't be used in classic because gear worked differently back then. Best in slot feral druid stuff was blue drops from level 51 before AQ40 and stuff like that.
---
It's an important post to have. Retail really promotes the rush mentality, while Classic is much more laid back. This doesn't mean you can't rush in Classic, but it doesn't mean you're not obligated to do so, which is important to keep in mind as it's a perspective of play that isn't endorsed within Retail's design, so many new players who didn't play back in the day might not be prepared for the difference.
---
Welcome to catch-up mechanics.
---
!remindme 10 hours
---
Yea, this seems to be a common request to have day 5 relate to 5 man groups/dungeons. Will try to wordsmith and maybe edit it tomorrow. Thanks!
---
I am rolling a rogue so I can camp people for hours at a time...
---
Back in vanilla I camped this guy for 5 hours by the yeti cave, he logged off and logged back in and I was still there waiting
---
While I agree that Thunderbluff is beautiful, and Orgrimmar is slightly depressing, you will likely need to spend most of your city time in Orgrimmar due to its central location and access to zeppelins. But if you make an effort then I don't see why not :) I wish you luck on your adventures &lt;3
---
(Personally im rolling alliance, almost entirely due to capital cities. My environment greatly effects my mood)
---
As a paladin you'll look fabulous in PvE and badass in PvP - it's pretty much a win/win.
---
And Feral druids, and warlocks...
---
If you're not in Orgrimmar, I'm pretty sure you wont be recieving the Dragonslayer buff. If and when someone kills Onyxia... It's an overpowered buff and can really change your game play.
---
That wasn’t there back when I played
---
an auto-clicking app works well too.
---
TB for sure!
---
Yes I am. Im Romanian, english is not my main language.

**&lt;Daybreak&gt; \[A\] | Herod, NA-PvP | Tues/Weds | 11:30am-2:30pm EST | Semi-Hardcore | Loot Council**
---
Daybreak is an East Coast, Alliance Daytime Raiding guild on Herod PvP server. We are a collection of players committed to taking on the challenge of Classic PvE Progression with schedules that accommodate a daytime raiding schedule.
---
**Raid Schedule:**
---
* Days: Tuesdays &amp; Wednesdays
---
* Times: 11:30 AM - 2:30 PM EST
---
Our desire is to begin raiding, realistically, in the second or third month post launch. Members in the guild have had experience raiding Vanilla Naxx and look forward to completing raid progression that was left on the table at the end of 2006.
---
**Values for a positive guild &amp; community:**
---
We are a guild and community that seeks to…
---
* Build one another up, not tear down.
---
* Help and serve one another, not play for your own isolated gain.
---
* Grow as a team to progress through content, not act as a collection of individuals.
---
* Act in a mature manner, but humor is encouraged.
---
Please visit our Discord to apply if you are interested in a Daytime raiding guild. We have a solid core of 40+ raiders, and are looking for all classes at this time. [https://discord.gg/j5e96Gb](https://discord.gg/j5e96Gb)
---
Thank you,
---
Daybreak Team
---
Change ‘a-Hoppin’ to ‘front flippin’?
---
Thank you for the guide. Quick question, if you leveled with a warrior, would you change anything about this build? Particularly improved blessing of might instead reduced mana cost on seals and judgments?
---
They have never had a smooth launch in their history. Take that as you will.
---
Yeah, I guess I'm unique in that regard.  A lot of people see to love it.
---
I'll be using whatever the equivalent of Dominoes is along with some kind of unit frame addon.
---
I got to create character on shazzrah and Golemagg when servers went up and I didn't have to wait in any queues. Booting your game when servers go up will lose you time, which you dont really have.
---
You missed out the importance of using a barrier cream, I recommend LBF. This will help protect against the chemical burns you will get from prolonged hours of sitting in your own stool. But if you want that first 60, you're gonna feel the burn.
---
No, absolutely not, you better off buying my cooked fish from the AH :)
---
Brainful content
---
I prefered leveling as 2h fury, the fury talents are good for tanking dungeons aswell.
---
Thats without the racial. Although including quests such as the one to kill general drakkisath in ubrs (500 rep)
---
I cant wait for the boomers to start complaining about everything taking so long 😂
---
Well OP does. He didn’t even bother googling since he would find the picture with the world map in wow style with all the releasetimes per timezone instantly on blizzards own site.
---
As of right now, the main download button on CurseForge only downloads the latest release.  Twitch App does the same.
---
That's fine if the addon author has made separate projects - one for retail and one for Classic.
---
The problem is that some authors are publishing both classic and retail releases to the same project so the main download link on the website and Twitch App can download the wrong version.  You have to look at the versions section (bottom-right of CurseForge page) to choose the correct release.
---
To make matters worse, the game version shown in Twitch App (such as designed for Wow 8.2.0) is often completely wrong so it's pointless relying on that.  Some modern 8.2.0 addons are showing in Twitch App as designed for WoTLK or Cata which is... weird.
---
We really need CurseForge to support retail and Classic under a single project and for Twitch App to do the same and for Twitch App to fix their game version number bug.  But until that happens (if it ever does), addon authors should publish their Classic version into a separate project so that website and Twitch App users don't download the wrong version.
---
I would've imagined Human Disc Priest.
---
the servers will be exploded, probably experience crashes
---
I'm a 'Nost veteran' you could say, having played since shortly after Nosts release up until today where I've been on almost every single vanilla pserver. So it's not like I don't know the pserver community. I'm a part of it!
---
You and me are talking about different people. Have you seen some of the discords? There are literal nazi's there. Like literally, 'lol jews are bad' and laughing at black people 'n shit. That's far different from your average Nostalrius player.
---
I don't see how my behaviour is toxic in any way. I just shared my opinion, saying that a lot of people in this community are toxic (again, with the hate and the nazis).
---
And the 90% you talk about is exactly my point. A ton of pserver folks are nice and wholesome. That's why I said every server that isn't Shazz seems to have a very friendly community. But 30% of Shazz players could still be toxic aholes and a tiny % of those even actual nazi's.
---
I don't care about dark jokes or whatever though. But at the same time these aren't the same players that will be either friendly or hardcore players. And if they're neither of those then they're just annoying to play with.
---
&gt;Regards, Yes.
---
10/10 shitpost, lol'd irl
---
How will i flex my unemployed e-peen then? I wanna rush to 60 so i can gank, /spit and totally ruin the experience for others while i watch people rage over on the Alliance discord.
---
Poles give + fishing, some gear + fishing, engineering gives a rule that gives you +100 fishing.
---
Nothing like the OG OG.
---
You should use 7 runes to douse stuff in MC!
---
just over 6 days*
---
I guess. I just expected them to follow their patterns of doing everything in pst. Being after maintenance and crap made sense too. Just needed confirmation so I can adjust my pto
---
There are almost 30 servers already
---
TFW people consider a 3 minute download not small. Try 56k where your download didn't even start in 3 minutes!
---
3rd party software will get you banned. I used to do ghost mouse and that did not work out well for me.
---
Wortt, is that you?
---
ESKERAM
---
Woe and disaster! The miserable bastards! Dastardly claims of the OP class master!
---
^(What the hell do you mean I can't one-shot squishies anymore!?!?!?!)
---
No, the disperity you see people claiming is mostly elitist nonsense.  They are not an obsolete class endgame.  They are not top DPS but they are still valuable.  Hunter utilities also have a large roll in later raiding and despite the high skill cap make wonderful PvP chars.  You will still find raid/group slots and enjoy a very strong PvP class if you can master it.
---
Your concern is coming from a bunch of elitists saying "Though Shall Bow to my Will and Roll What I TELL YOU."
---
Play a hunter and have fun with it if you want to.

I agree. The music and epic shots as it builds is why I like this one.
---
This is a pvp thread why in hell would you think the comment would be IRL related?
---
It's really hard to say. Gathering professions are the 'stable' ways to make gold. The crafting progressions depend on if you can get recipes and corner a market for something valuable.
---
Coming from someone who has religiously played both games, I would support it if they ever decide to implement major new content patches beyond the original patches implementes in classic. OSRS began to die due to lack of new content and exploded in popularity once brand new content was polled and added. Classic may not have this problem since there are many content patches and even expansions for people to look forward to. It all depends on tje popularity of the game and what players want. After experiencing OSRS I can say I’d be down if blizzard adds brand new content at a level 60 cap beyond what was originally released
---
enjoy it while it lasts... take many screenshots in-game
---
By tell us do you mean show us?
---
Tailoring and skinning. Skinning as a warlock is severely underrated. You can skin mobs as your void tanks the next pull. Great for vendoring to make some extra silver. And for tailoring you can make some decent gear come 60, and bags are always useful. If you’re really worried about other guildies having tailoring you could go enchanting or double up on gathering prof, I’d take herbalism.
---
In my experience, you get decent enough gear from quest chains to have a usable set stored in your bags/bank. If I join to heal, I roll for healing gear usually but will ask the dps of the group if something would be okay to roll on. Not the end of the world to miss out on an item because my main goal in the dungeon is to do all the quests i have for it usually. I may ask to roll on something, but if a dps really wants it I'll pass. Has happened a lot where I let them get an item, and then they let me get another drop later in the run.
---
Dream big, man.
---
This is not the sub for this. Try r/gatekeeping
---
May want to double check your heart health. Launch day could kill you.
---
This or similar things have been asked and answered here a million times, but since you seem new I'll answer it for you.
---
You don't need to be on a dedicated healing or tanking talent to heal or tank low level dungeons and for leveling going for a healing or tanking talent is a really really bad idea. Even at max level people tanked raids on DPS talents. 
---
As a healer class what you want to do is use a DPS leveling spec and heal dungeons on that. I'm no paladin expert but I think the best leveling spec is actually prot from a certain level because of reckoning. Don't quote me on that though I never played a paladin in Vanilla because I find it to be incredibly boring to level and to play at max level.
---
This would be a fresh experience from POE to me. Its been 6 years playing the game, doing the same thing over and over every 3 months, you get to end game, do the first maps and get a upgrade and keep moving on untill you get bored.  
---
The closest thing that comes close to wow that i played is Rift couple years ago. I remember the map being invaded by some gigantic monsters and 200 guys showing up to kill the boss and get some loot from it.
---
There is no auction house in Thunder Bluff
---
Don't complain on launch everyone's been warned...
---
Form-ul-a, form-ul-a!  The rest is great!
---
I mean, I have no official involvement at all, I'm just saying what I've heard, but I assume it's due to Blizzard being very explicit about the long queues which would be present on Shazz. Additionally, from my own point of view it also seems like the rhetoric &amp; attitude around the new servers has improved immensely.
---
I was thinking the same, only because of them saying medium pop servers are larger than high pop servers in vanilla. I played vanilla on Shattered Hand and it was high pop, no real queue times other than typical Friday and Saturday nights. But still, would like to avoid them lol
---
Most throughout healing will be coming from gear and set bonuses. Being able to tank or heal I would value much more than DPS.
---
SW &lt;3
---
Maybe, it was never really meant for the high end raider and I assume a lot more are going to try to raid in classic. However, with loot split between 40 people in raids it takes a loong time before everyone gets full epic, even if we weren't counting duplicates.
---
Zul'Gurub have been launched here, so people might have outgeared most of it. 
---
The quest is quite epic though, and it's a good way to get sort of geared on your alts as most people won't be raiding too much MC at that point.
---
Not sure why I am getting down voted. That is how almost every mage in my old server used to do it. If they ask how much tell them the rate you want but if they ask for a portal it's not etiquite to just demand payment. Most people will ask how much it costs most of the time so it won't be an issue in most circumstances.
---
Azshara was definitely more powerful than a partially awake C'thun.  She was the most powerful mortal before being juiced up by N'zoth.
---
I hope he isn't expecting a flying mount in the game....
---
I’ve posted this here a bunch of times before but do not waste a profession on tailoring phase 1. Bags are fine, the Robes of the Void are not. Pick up tailoring ahead of ZG.
---
Do what you want otherwise, but warlock tailoring is the least valuable kind of tailoring. If you want money your skinning herbalism plan works fine.
---
shadow priest
---
Posting to come back later
---
I think ideas like this should be saved for after phase 6.
---
For me I was 14 years old and hit 60 two months before BC release, so all I really had was tier 0.5 and PvP gear I guess I never realized it was added to the game so late.
---
Welcome to Classic
---
when in doubt: herb
---
I plan to take my time. No interest in raiding or dungeons so the game is about the levelling process for me and then just the sweet ganks at 60.
---
I like this, do you have the export link?
---
For the Alliance! Iron forge and Stormwind are 100 times sexier than any horde city in Vanilla.
---
Yeah I think this is one of the fairer times.
---
People need to realise that even though the Joana record will be beaten he still took 4days 20hrs and that included asking for loans for his mount as well as doing nothing but levelling hard and fast routes.
---
The reality is a lot of people have their hearth on a capital city, they do profession stuff. They spend time AFK. I think doubling what Joana did is *maybe* fair as a baseline for an average Joe.
---
We didnt kill C'thun.  We fought it in its weakened state and put it back to sleep like we did Yogg.
---
It's fine.
---
Warrior are the most demanding class in term of farming and xp to level. My advice : don't play one if you're casual
---
How It's Made and WoW for me.
---
I have to leave them even if they dont wave haha xd my girlfriend always let the enemy live when they are similar or lower level. But then we get killed by a high level and i ask myself why dont i just slaughter all i can see lol
---
I played the stress test too and downloaded some addons for that.  I haven't done any major UI addons yet and really don't plan on it until around level 20 around the time I fill up my second action bar with abilities.
---
Wait I’m confused, people get addicted to this game?
---
Not even Undercity?
---
resto kitty in retail still isn't bad, with the right gear and a potion, I got it up to around 3/4 of what numbers I could get out in feral, admittedly I have to pop troll racial to get anywhere near that and most of the damage is auto attack and you do no healing at all other than any leech you might have and yesras gift.
---
You can get decent DPS out of it for the mythic+ stuff though and still get respectable healing numbers from weaving in and out of kitty.
---
No! I will only wear plate and plan to be naked until lvl40 to show my willpower!
---
Can’t believe there aren’t mage and priest trainers in Orgimmar, have to go to TB
---
in osrs people love that there's a chance that the boss they're killing has a 1/5000 chance to drop a miniature version of itself. there will be people who see rivendare's mount the same way
---
"Where's my heirloom gear and why cant i see the shop for level boosts?" :D
---
You wont be rage capped, even in preraid bis. You will always be able to dump rage into heroic strikes. Atleast untill you consistently outthreat the tank. a free heroic strike every 45 seconds &gt; 25% crit on an ability that already has a high crit chance, and rarely become available.
---
I’ve seen it posted a lot the last few days, but what’s the point on only getting the lower rank version of ability’s?
---
Also, if you dont already have this planned out, tomorrow should be "8 races rolling"
---
Hopefully arenas never happen, because that means you have to perfectly balance the game around the 3v3 minigame. 
---
Nothing worse than putting a pet-battlesque gimmick into the game which destroyed actual big PvP battles.
---
If anything 15v15 should've been the trademark of balancing. Interestingly enough classic WoW has *amazing* premade PvP balance and each class is wanted.
---
It just was off my radar, to be honest.  I knew it was coming 'later this year' and then blammo, it's mid august and my buddies are talking about reserving their names...
---
And that hype truck just wholloped me, now I got my 3 names reserved and I'm waiting for Classic by going into Retail and trying to make sense of 8.1 and beyond.
---
The office and osrs
---
Is this new? I told some of my friends to try to download it and they said they couldn't. You just download it through the launcher?
---
Given that C'Thun is on par with N'zoth, and that she's empowere by N'zoth I wouldn't say that's the case.
---
She was the most powerful mortal, still a mortal.

Not sure Alliance even acknowledge Undercity as being an actual city do they?
---
Even if they do not fill up the day before launch, they certainly will on launch. People who have no affiliation to a realm will instantly switch to the realm they can play on at launch, instead of sitting in queue of thousands of people for no reason
---
Holy shit thank you. I have to do summer reading for school and was planing to be done by 6pm on the 27th.

Best post in the last days ever!

Don't listen to this haters, because they are Alliance players and flame you for helping us out!

---
I remember it taking hours, we'll agree to disagree.
---
i really fear the start of classic, gonna fuck up my life. 
---
again..
---
Theres no druid trainer in orgrimmar?
---
How have you not been awarded by the mods your own flair yet, get this guy a flair boys
---
But it does have value.  Someone wants to move to another server and values moving their character over.  Blizzard meets the need and charges a fee for migration that they've automated. Banks and credit/debit card companies have done it forever.  
---
If Blizzard charged too much nobody would do it and it would fail.  The price point makes sense, even if you don't want to pay money for it.
---
Only on the lower rise.
---
Shoot, we only have 19 more months to wait :(
---
I want all that wolf meat and defias mask to myself
---
People have already given ways of doing this without access to the game - you salty, salty boi.
---
Yes, but can you imagine the absolute shit show if it was free?
---
Underrated comment here.
---
Undercity is better anyway!!!!
---
This the answer. Pick one and stick with it. Everything is viable if you try.
---
I definitely agree. I expected bgs in p2. Depending on how long these first few phases last, most of my group(which are heavy pvpers, several r14's) might lose some interest without bgs.
---
Sucks, but what can you do.
---
What did the population feel like at 10k?
---
&gt; So? I would rather be known as a famous explorer and dragonhunter
---
And that's exactly how they are treating you. A champion. One of the most powerful adventurers ever. And with that it comes some military power as well, it would be pointless to put you in a Garithos-Kael'thas situation.
---
You've gained more experience than the vast majority of Alliance/Horde military figures, why should you be placed under them, when they need you to do shit?
---
u gotta farm like a weeks worth of silithid corpses with your guild while every other guild is also competing for them
---
To each his own I guess but typically you need for a fight X tanks and X healers and filled out with dps.
---
If you need 10 healers for the raid you don't want one of them being a tank for this fight and you don't really need a 11th in the fights you don't. Combine that with warriors being top 2-3 dps classes and it's clear what's optimal.
---
It's not like druids are the best healers even when resto.
---
You misunderatood me. I know Fins speak perfect english but why would they want to if they are surrounded mostly by other Fins? I know I wouldn't. But I'm probably wrong here, it's gonna be a mixed server where ever you go and english will be in abundance
---
The push button resets your one character slot

It's a meme you dip.
---
City: ironforge
---
Mood: cozy af
---
Honestly I would get a thrash blade + w/e offhand instead of grinding out dal'rends
---
Then frim this switch as op is stating that more than 4000 user discord is moving servers we will see shazzrah drop from full to full to high. And i highly doubt that
---
I see my family plenty what I don't get to do very often if play classic wow with my homies on a long weekend right after launch.
---
I agree with all of your points. I don't remember anything about the professions, though, but perhaps that's conclusive evidence that you are right.
---
Im 90% certain the title wont be seen in game, they added that in tbc. The mount is the trophy, not the title. Hopefully I'm wrong but I have seen this mentioned a few times.
---
Is the alliance/horde split even?
---
Playing Warcraft 3 TFT woild be more than enough
---
Im rushing to 60, clear mc, complain there is nothing to do at 60
---
rocket helm is amazing for 2v1, big bombs and grenades are excellent cc tools and the trinkets you can make are really good against casters
---
Ragefire Chasm?
---
would add: drain soul macro
---
would fix: 
---
add spells Fear Rank 1, Death Coil
---
not getting master summoner means you are playing on a pve realm I guess?
---
stuff about VW has already been said, but at lvl 10 its a must have, so far you are correct (there is just some stuff you cant do with the imp, like the cave next to OG)
---
The title is really hard to get because it’s not even in the game until tbc!
---
He came to DC recently. His latest track with Ferry Corsten is amaaazing. Love me some prog house.
---
Kurenai is the name of a tribe of Broken. These aren't part of it.
---
You may get that Feeling that is true.
---
But that has a lot to do with the fact that (this might have changed by now - so Close to release) most People in this Reddit are "Hardcore" Players or a large Proportion of People is taking this serious when they are lurking the reddit.
---
That way you would definitely get the Feeling that the majority of People plans on rushing.
---
I think that is not the case. If someone feels forced to rush or feels like he has to be part of the Hype Train. Then it is their own fault really...
---
But I get how you want People to know there is alternatives :)
---
And I am yet to meet a Person that is new to classic and feels like rushing to 60 is the only reasonable Option. 
---
Probably thanks to the bazillion threads about taking your chill pill ;)
---
I will give you a + because we didn't have this thread in a while I feel like so you deserve to get some Attention!
---
Just a subscription.  The base game and classic are included with the sub price.  The only thing you don't get is the most current expansion.
---
For the Rogues reading this, since you will not get your hands on Hand of Justice, consider Rune of the Guard Captain instead.
---
You probably won't ever see the chest or belt either. I'd offer Nightbrace Tunic as an alternative chest and Frostbite Girdle for belt.
---
Good luck to everyone aiming to pick all this stuff up, especially the weapons!
---
Log off - welcome to 5 hour queue.

Just the sub.
---
If i open google and typ in Scarab lord, the first 230734507  pages are filled with info how to obtain... here a copy paste:  
---
The title *Scarab Lord* and the [Black Qiraji Resonating Crystal](https://www.wowhead.com/?item=21176) (a.k.a. "black bug mount") are obtained by completing [Bang a Gong!](https://wotlk.wowhead.com/?quest=8743) The first player realm-wide to complete the quest opens the gates of [Ahn'Qiraj](https://www.wowhead.com/?zone=3428). More than one player per realm may still complete the quest and receive both title and mount, provided they do so within ten hours of the gates opening.   
---
The black bug mount may be used anywhere ground mounts can be used *and* inside Ahn'Qiraj. There are [other, differently colored bug mounts](https://www.wowhead.com/?items&amp;filter=na=Qiraji+Resonating+Crystal;cr=16;crs=3428;crv=0) which drop from creatures inside Ahn'Qiraj, and may *only* be used while inside.
---
I mean, the sub has gained like 25% of its current audience in the last month. So there is potentially a good 50 thousand people that didn't see it posted last month, not to mention not everybody checks the sub everyday.
---
I don't disagree with you, but a 1 month repost really isn't the worst of things in this sub.
---
Also depends on class, i'm going hunter so it's easy mode.  When i leveled my war in vanilla on the other hand...
---
Does the mount only drop for a successful timed run?
---
I hate the idea of not using dots because of the 8 debuff limit. Maybe I'll just go holy paladin. I heard they're amazing once max gear comes out.
---
Is it? He cleans up pretty damn well.

Same dude, same. Depression is horrible, and this game is like, the light i need right now lol.
---
Thanks for the guides!
---
I just can't stand his voice overs on his fallout videos..
---
I think one of the biggest questions I see floating around the community (especially among guild leadership) is whether Molten Core be released in it's relatively broken status of minimal loot tables, tier 2 drops from mc bosses like it was on launch or can we expect Domo's chest, Onslaught Girdle, and the other items that were added to the loot table early in Vanillas Life.  
---
Please if you can get us an answer on this.
---
&gt; You're focussed so much on "Who's The Strongest Villain We Defeated: Classic vs BfA Edition™
---
This is exactly WHY YOU MISSED MY POINT.
---
It doesn't fucking matter who the strongest evil is. That was a side argument related to power creep.
---
Still we defeated every major threat to Azeroth, and the threats in Vanilla weren't really risible ones. An elemental lord, a old god, the most powerful necromancer turned lich in existence, dragons, undead dragons, death knights, a trolls ancient god, whatever we faced we pwnd.
---
It's only logical to get some better treatment, and with more and more heroics the treatment improves.
---
At a certain point it becomes obvious that we are the only people on Azeroth who actually GET SHIT DONE.
---
I think, and hope, you're right.  It doesn't stop the armies of r/classicwow posters who speculate on it hourly though.
---
Hey, depending on your time frames and your schedule.  Go check out the ping on the Oceanic servers.  When I worked nights, most of my time playing was with the Aus guys.  They are great and would likely love having you.  I never had an issue in 10 years of gaming with them due to my schedule.  Something to consider, spell batching really takes the sting out of long distance relationships ;)
---
*sad Gladiator noises*
---
Upvote for the Steel Panther reference.
---
Tbh both are kinda bad for a mage and are going to be mostly useless.
---
If only we could be orc, /cry
---
Wow I just moved my goal of rank 11 to rank 13. Thanks.
---
Get your mom a sub and meet her in game. Problem solved.
---
5-6 hours a day is quite a bit... lol
---
No. There won't be anyone wasting money on low level enchanting mats early on and low level mats are easy to go back and farm at 60 if you're leveling enchanting.
---
you are a champion that has done so much, makes sense. you still can't accomplish anything raid wise without other champions
---
Iirc, they plan to remove layering after a time as it was only supposed to function, primarily, to reduce the waiting-for-mobs flight queue that happens in new/beginning areas before everyone can branch off somewhat.
---
Understood, well if you're still looking for a home feel free to drop by and read our spam and get to know folks. We will only be raiding one night a week officially with off night activities as things go, we're primarily a core of wow vets who have aged past the point in our lives where we could raid 20 hours a week, but will lean on our experience to help us clear content at a reasonable pace: https://discord.gg/EnsWcP
---
pretty sure they dont have world drops on there for obvious reasons
---
"I'm Homelander I'll fucking laser you!"
---
yep! wasnt there also some novelty account with a pet?
---
not sure what type of account it was but that was pretty crazy :)
---
There is a ton of guild quests that have to be done, and you can only do it for a very short window.
---
There were maybe 4 people on my server that got it.
---
Ironforge is pretty cozy, can't lie. Favorite Ally city.
---
There is no &lt;scarab lord&gt; title in vanilla, they added that in TBC.  All you get is the mount. The difficulty is you need an entire guild supporting you to grind the reputation off turnins in silithus, it's really a colossal effort very few people get on a server.
---
Always on the other monitor while grinding god dammit
---
If you guys are going to be particular, spirit is the better leveling stat.
---
I think it's kind of neat, to have a rare cosmetic item that people don't own because they farmed for it, but because they got lucky.
---
Now, Ironfoe on the other hand is kind of a dick move.
---
I will also be on Gehennas so make it 25%
---
I think those items are in "pre raid phase 2" tab
---
The founding of durotar special campaign in wc3 is pretty fun iirc
---
Cringey comment
---
hamstring kiting doesn't work in classic? how could it not work?
---
Yeah, so that’s why it’s so hard to get ;)
---
Then they just need to balance their items while keeping that in mind.
---
this is a vanilla one time event only Title.
---
Most healer BIS shit came from BRD, if I recall. I remember that place too damn well, also getting 'nam flashbacks on it.
---
I thought he did a great job in his first superman movie, but I thought the movie was pretty crap.  He seemed ripe for a movie that played up the clark kent/superman double life a bit more.  The DC movies all looked like garbage so i never saw him in his repeat performances.
---
Yeah that's why I said from a certain level. 
---
Also isn't there an AoE grinding spec for paladin?
---
I'm pretty sure balance isn't an "ok" levelling spec. At least not if the all the warrior specs are "bad" (both arms and fury are okey, just not great).
---
Back when I was a softpaw, my friend was a Warlock and I was a Hunter. He always won the duels we had. So Warlock is my vote.
---
Be horde.
---
Farm [Ironfoe](https://classicdb.ch/?item=11684).
---
Find a dwarf.
---
Autoattack the dwarf until you proc the 10 secs speak Dwarvish buff.
---
Talk for 10 seconds.
---
Launch an all out war on tarren mill or southshore!
---
He made that for a brief bit and fell way off. He’s not making nearly that much any more.
---
This is soooo coool!!!
---
I'm leaving town the 31st and 1st. Have to supplement but playing an unhealthy amount of hours the days prior :D

I'll play druid and I absolutely have no issue looking like a priest just with green glowy hands instead of yellow.

I've been watching The Office and playing WoW since Wrath. Started with switching DVDs out on my tv while I played on my laptop to now using a streaming service to watch it on my second monitor. I can't wait to play Classic and watch The Office.
---
Amything to kill time!
---
Oh how I miss the old worldofwarcraft.com
---
You can learn enchanting at lvl 5. So the bank alt is able to disenchant items.
---
Monday 3PM PST is when it will start for you
---
There's an advantage in logging in on your (all) characters and then logging off to start rested xp. Otherwise there is none.
---
Probably 100k characters on Shazz, doubt it will have the slightest of effect
---
Hmm, its tough to say which you'll want to play more, they both have there pros and cons and what makes them fun and have different playstyles especially before u dive into specs. 
---
Hunters kite and jump and 360 no scope and pretend to be dead most of their gameplay and take every weapon in the game. You also can get a pet Gorilla who will run at people and throw there feces at them and you can grow him into kingkong while ur at it.
---
Warlocks like to summon demons and use the dark arts to burn their enemies alive with the sheer amounts of aids and cancer they spawn inside their foes. Not only this but people also want warlocks to bring people out of the closet to get to raids quicker.
---
so its between those two choices I'd say.
---
I thought Root had no DR at least for Phase 1
---
I agree with you 100% on this.  Whilst TBC was a good expansion, it was there that the dailies started, and the "Quality of Life" improvements in Wrath.  What MIGHT be more interesting, if they released them, but in a "classic style"...  so, keeping the social aspect.
---
Really? I thought that whole area was part of the quest chain that starts in ZF and ends in ST?
---
There is nothing "important" about engineering.  The vast majority of people will not be engineers.  You won't constantly be losing fights because you fought an engineer.  Not everyone who IS an engineer will be willing to use tons of bombs constantly.  Not every engineer you fight will have their 20 minute cooldowns ready for you. 
---
It's a fun profession with a lot of cool toys.  You won't constantly be dominated by engineers, don't worry.
---
Read the whole post.
---
He’s talking about the actual title. Titles weren’t a thing in vanilla. It was added in TBC.  Which is what he is referring to.
---
Dropping the hardest album Azeroth has ever heard...
---
Pablo, I think you are confused. The event is vanilla, of course, but the in game title wasnt added until patch 2.0, the tbc patch. Anyone who had completed the scepter line and rung the gong was at that point able to show their title avove their head in game. Previously the mount was the only way to know that someone was the scarab lord.
---
Homelander.... The real superman
---
Are you colorblind? I don't mean to offend, only because that could muddle things together. I've always found Orgrimmar to have a warm dry, high desert vibe. A comforting retreat on a cold grey day in England.
---
If you like the music then the band "Hoven Droven" might interest you (here's one of their slow ones):

---
Just farming for trade materials? I've done my fair share of that in TBC. Not much at elemental plateau in Nagrand since that place is always crowded, I mostly hanged out at the lake in the southeast of Terokkar forest where there were several elite ancient treants roaming around. You knock it down and loot, then you get to "skin" the corpse for some herbs and motes of primal life if you can herb. That was the only spot to farm this material. There was a time when a patch was about to launch in which a lot of +healing enchantment was added, and I practically monopolized all the primal life supplies, first buying off all of that from AH, then farming at the lake all day long, if anybody else was farming those treants I approached and stole the body as soon as it was looted. I don't regret for missing that out in vanilla.
---
Also. Level 5 disenchant can disenchant any level of item.
---
shazz has a bit of a horde favour
---
&gt; Given that the bracers provide less spell damage and less Int and no Stamina, no Hit, and a paltry amount of mp/5, I'd never see anyone using them over Bracers of Arcane Accuracy if given the choice.
---
Considering Spiritshaper is mc and Arcane Accuracy is bwl, I don't see why you should make this comparison. Spiritshaper certainly beats any other option shadow priests have in mc or pre-raid.
---
Hahahahaha
---
Tuesday.
---
How long were you waiting to take this screenshot?
---
P.S.: Nice.
---
say kek over and over
---
How... how is that any different than classic?
---
Can't control who decides to join. I'm sure the Finnish guilds appreciates it and although a much smaller portion - the norwegians as well.
---
For example I'm pretty sure the "Spanish coalition" that decided to join Shazzrah make up a pretty tiny part of the the Spanish playerbase as a whole. The "some spanish guilds or maybe just people who speak spanish but live somewhere else coalition" just doesn't have the same ring to it.
---
I understood it as having X days to vote and only releasing results once it ends, so that the current results do not influence your vote
---
Dutch here, gonna K O L O N I S E E R the fuck outta Firemaw
---
I think it's some sort of private server thing. They probably don't allow mailing items or anything until a certain level.
---
Again buddy - you’re not listening. There is not title in vanilla other than PvP ranks I believe. 
---
The point they are making is that even completing the event does not give the title - because that wasn’t added till TBC.
---
Traitors to the dutchy!
---
Gonna guess that mining nodes and herbing nodes would also follow this skill pattern, at least loosely?
---
Have they fixed10 man dungeons
---
I believe the earliest you can start is level 30, where it is on par with wanding. At 38 you get a new rank of drain life and it pulls ahead
---
Looks dope! Have you considered doing them in a gradient-sort-of-style, so 1/5 talent is the white closest to original grey, and 5/5 talent is the most white etc.?
---
its 15 year ago, but im pretty sure you would receive the title in Vanilla and not TBC.  
---
because its so long ago, i can agree my memory has some clouded visions.....  
---
But still im pretty sure tho...:D
---
Maybe. But that doesn't change the fact that you won't struggle finding groups as a healer.
---
Awesome!
---
Do warlocks struggle against undeads because of their racial? Also which race woukd be better for a warlock; orc or undead?
---
I can't believe multiboxing is even allowed on retail. It's the biggest kind of cheating, to me, and getting instakilled and camped in world PvP by one guy with five shamans is bullshit.
---
He just needed to scroll down on the webpage he screenshotted and he would see the release times and have a clear answer

* Ding 60 in 2024
---
If you have some kind of leveling plan you can hit 60 in like 6 or 7 days /played. Over 10 is super slow
---
Nope.  Please re-release every expansion in chronological order.
---
The zeppelin is fundamentally necessary for intercontinental transport. It's the equivalent of the ship from Rut'theran Village to Stormwind, not to the tram.
---
The hardest part of getting the title in Classic is that the title doesn’t exist in Classic.
---
If you’re talking about being able to get the mount though, just look up a guide to getting it.  I don’t remember all the details, but basically each guild is bottlenecked into getting one person through the long questchain at a time.  So unless your entire server is willing to wait 40 times longer than normal to open the AQ gates, only one person each from the top guilds can realistically get it.
---
While that makes it feel a lot less daunting, it might be better to frontload it a bit in lower levels. I took my time with fishing and remember trying to level it in BB when I got there and most of the fish were getting away until I bought the more expensive lures and sat there for an hour.
---
No thank you, I've already enjoyed the game, this isn't a new game. I'll be getting to 60 as fast as I can while pvping and helping friends get there so we can start farming mats and bis. You say it's not to tell people how to play the game yet your title is a statement that's telling me to take my time and not to rush through it.
---
Over 9,000

Beyond this no one really knows. But blizz has a pretty good idea by now. Rest assured additional servers are standing by and will be deployed if and when they are needed. This is an opportunity for blizz to re-roll out the game flexing all they’ve learned in the last 15 years. It will be well scrutinized and blizz are aware.
---
So weird to see that people only played alliance, then I looks myself. A person that has only played horde. Lol
---
I hope they do.
---
Saved.

Hope I remember to look at it lol, awesome map!

Mail won't expire for like 30 days so you can start sending stuff to your bank alt without losing it no need to spend launch day on an alt unless you just want to.
---
Technically 23:00BST (so 22:00GMT).
---
People often use the bank alt to craft, for example, enchanting.  These  trades cant be learned intil lvl 5.
---
That is a good view of it. One of the reasons I made the post is because of how Reddits like this and streamers really push the rush and min-max aspect, mostly because it's the most objective aspect of the game and easiest to convey. 
---
I don't think it's someone's fault for being caught up in the hype train, it's really easy to let your competitive nature kick in and to tunnel vision on something.

Only skinning until level 40. Once you have mount, go back if you like and farm mats.
---
Uuuugggghhhh ooooooggghhh

Ques on launch day are going to suck! In the old days, people were logging on and off all the time, so you just had to wait a few minutes. No one is going to be logging off for hours next Monday evening.

---
When it comes to PvP, here is my take on it.
---
People seem to love Classic PvP. Yes it is not balanced well, there is one or two-shots and all that stuff happening. But imo that is okay. Imo there does not need to be a perfect balance to PvP. Seeking this perfect balance is like attempting to turn WoW into some sort of esports game. But that is not what the OG WoW ever was supposed to be.
---
World of Warcraft is an MMORPG, especially Vanilla WoW was so unique and loved because everything made "sense". The feel of the world is extremely important. A lot of this "world feeling" has been lost for the sake of balancing the game. The world, if it truly wants to feel authentic and immersive, HAS to be unbalanced. Things like a unique trinket dropping from one rare NPC somewhere in this huge world, which has the on-use effect to stun someone for 4 seconds, is a perfect example. It may be mediocre for some classes and may be extremely overpowered in the hands of other classes. Unique and unbalanced things like this make the world feel like a real place.
---
Having a mage run around who has so much +fire damage on his gear that he can one-shot a low-geared player with a pyroblast seems unbalanced, but it makes so much sense for someone that has been working and specializing his mage for months to be able to do that to someone who just hit level 60.
---
The point I am trying to make here is...
---
WoW should not be an esports. That was not what made vanilla WoW special or loved. Vanilla WoW did a great job at building an authentic, immersive world full of unique things. Look at PvP how it is today. It does not get any more boring and generic than that. Cookie-Cutter 3vs3 teams, trading defensive cooldowns in a 10-minute long battle with each other until one team runs out of defensive cooldowns to use and the other team has that little window where they chain enough CC and DPS cooldowns to burst one of them down. And every single match looks like this. And all of it is happening in some sort of instanced Arena.
---
Compare that to a wild, unbalanced battle that suddenly happens in World PvP somewhere in Classic and ask yourself which of the two was the more fun experience for you. And ask yourself if game balance truly mattered.
---
Classic is not meant to be played solo, its meant to be played as part of the community at large. My wife and I group up and we level just as fast as anyone else. Plus we have more fun because we are together. She plays a healer and I play something tankie. I round em up and she keeps me alive.
---
Yes you are correct to assume that a Logitech G600. And a Logitech G13 gamepad for the left hand.
---
You clearly want the original name for all the right reasons.
---
Subtle. I like it.
---
Because of Americans using AM and PM. And Developers have a tendency to say "midnight" or 12AM, Instead of just using the 24h clock and saying 00.01 On August 27th.

Pulled this from the Stalagg sub.
---
Ion specifically said they wouldn't add any new lore to Classic as the story already exists and they dont want to detract from it.
---
Thanks, that's helped me a bit in the sense that it seems like it's going to be very similar on all realms
---
Nice one ;)
---
It is still in pst...
---
How would that work across different server types? While I can't come up with an example, I can see some changes affecting PVP servers diffierently than PVE servers, and perhaps even RP vs non-RP.
---
&gt;u gotta farm like a weeks worth of silithid corpses
---
Way more than a weeks worth, unless you have a huge team of dedicated farmers. It's a serious undertaking.
---
Ah you meant after launch in previous post, alright.
---

I agree with this comment. My thought is...

1. Run these dungeons. Do the quests.  
---
2. If you get any of this gear, keep it. Make sure you don't get rid of it.

---
Oh, I mean... *Nice*.
---
Eh people get like this about literally every single MMO before it's released. Classic is no different.
---
I hope it does great, but suggesting that it does what every other MMO released this last 15 years isn't "silly".
---
That show was so damn good (ignore season 3).
---
This is great
---
Why do you think community votes is the only way to get new content?
---
Square.
---
I would guess the first 3 days.  After that:
---
* Retail kiddos that are used to instant gratification will give up.
---
* 1-10 starter zones will not be insanely crowded. (They'll still be crowded AF though)
---
* Server hiccups will be addressed
---
* Realm queues will be lower/non-existant
---
I think liking your server name can be an important part of server selection. For me, it was a big part of it. 
---
I prefer to stay on Herod because *server history has already started*. I'd be playing (in a queue) on "The People's Server". 
---
Switching servers for me would be easier if they made a "Hellscream" or "Ironspine" Eastern PvP, i.e. a cool name server, to help me forget about the server history of Herod. Also, Herod is a community of people who will not tolerate streamers, which is a very attractive aspect of the server community. I dont get that same assurance on another server. I also can't play Pacific servers, as I have EU friends who will be playing with me.
---
Really, I need a cool name on an Eastern PvP server with a day's warning *to trade* with the server history and the anti-streamer community currently on Herod. I keep pretty up to date with Classic news, but some of my friends don't. I need to time ask about switching, at least 24 hours.
---
Alliance stuff usually downvoted by horde nerds.
---
Same here. Priest you gotta go out of your way to always be in a group and it's great, otherwise if you just want to solo then hunter.  I think I'm going to have to do both. If things are dead and my priest is standing around IF and I don't want to go get ganked into oblivion as heal spec, then I'll go work on the hunter and leave a note in discord/guild-chat.  
---
Not sure what else to do either.
---
To each their own, I am going to “rush” to BIS gear on classic so I can go back to retail and play a real challenging game. And in my downtime on retail play classic during new content/when I’m bored to PvP while raiding once a week.
---
Fuck this brings back memories, not long now bois
---
Yes i took an indian name so saying “show bob &amp; vagene” or “bitch lasagna” had extra punch. I’m not a pajeet shitstreet.
---
Beta and stress-test give us some idea of game-play, but that’s about it. And we can’t depend on vanilla or p-servers, because the game is actually built on a modified BFA client. Blizz *will* get things wrong. But for now, we really don’t know.
---
I don't but you are telling people how to play the game, instead of putting information out there for them. There are people who will farm mounts, and collectibles because that's what they enjoy. Except you made a Public Service announcement that says you shouldn't try to farm this said mount. My PSA's better.
---
My first character in vanilla (a hunter), took 10 days /played to 60. Got to 60 in 7 days /played on a priest on nost without following any guides while also doing dungeons/pvp etc.
---
Well me and about 400 other dutchies from the same guild are going to roll on Shazzrah.
---
This may be a stupid question... but why does everybody on here keep saying the 27th... My official battle.net launcher and the website says the launch is 3pm on Monday, the 26th. I don't even see the 27th for any other timezones in the world... they all say 26th, am I crazy?
---
WTB Madmax on Herod. Please!!!
---
I'd say its a decent idea but the issue comes in when something big is suggested. For example, in OSRS the new warding skill failed by just a few percent, no new skill will ever be added to OSRS cause people just can't agree on what a good skill is. I'd argue the poll system is good overall but should definitely have limits.
---
Halfway and then i died of cringe.
---
Because it's so blindingly obvious. It's the most popular WoW expansion *by far*, it's a completely known quantity unlike potential new classic content which could end up shit, most of the groundwork is already done, it's the next step after vanilla originally, etc. It's gonna happen if Classic is successful enough.
---
Both. I am guessing we will get more realms added this week, and again after launch, as they fill up the current ones.
---
Superman hype
---
You spend 99% of your time in a clown-like mismatched set of cloth pieces and a dress holding flowers though.
---
It's actually pretty easy to set up a character with one of the "templates" and use it to autofill the gear that's BiS.  Then, you can click on each piece of gear and see a list of next best alternatives.  
---
I thought it was super complicated too, and it CAN be, but if you want to get it up and running quickly you still can.
---
I sit in a cubicle doing data analysis. So the coverage excuse is an odd one.
---
They say it because - if classic is successful they won't let it stagnate. Have you seen how the retail community loses it's mind if they don't have new content for a little while? Classic will shrivel up quickly if they complete phase 6 and do nothing else with it.   
---
Something has to come next. The obvious solution would be the next expansion.
---
More servers!
---
Im glad the sub has been pretty decent again lately.  Its nice to hang out here and for the most part see positive posts and people just genuinely excited for launch.
---
I had to un-sub a month and a half ago when it was just constant fighting and doomsayers.   Made me sad to not be able to come here and look for new info without seeing multiple threads about how Bliz was tanking the game on purpose, or how new (to classic) players would never, ever be able to deal with it.
---
Its been a refreshing change, and its only helping to get me hyped up for next week.  Im really looking forward to seeing that nice sense of community again in the game.
---
My thoughts exactly. Fuck off with Arenas.
---
Battlegrounds are a nice addition to the game. They pit enough players against each other that they can effectively simulate an open world battle, sort of.
---
Also, this may be an unpopular opinion, but I think the OG vanilla Honor system was the best PvP system that WoW ever had. Yes true, it required an insane amount of no-lifing and grinding to get to any of the top 3 ranks of this system. But that is okay in my opinion. There should be content like this that simply can't be achieved by anyone and everyone. Stuff like this makes the world feel unique and special. When there is only a handful of grand marshals on the alliance side, those guys stand out. Yes, I may not be one of them. But that's okay. It gives so much character and uniqueness and awesomeness to your whole server community. Stuff like this BUILDS server community, which is so important. Right now, I could not even tell you who the fuck on my retail server is high ranked in Arena. The whole PvP scene on my retail server is just one big huge grey homogenic mass to me. Nobody  stands out in any way.
---
You do the Long quest chain and bang the gong.
---
Other People will have a couple of minutes to do the same Thing.
---
After that you can not bang the gong anymore and therefore will never be able to finish the quest line again.
---
It is pretty much a "1 Person per Server" Thing unless you Team up and communicate and not get fcked over by this one Person banging the gong in the middle of the night because he can xD
---
Ya if the retail plebs can't vote.
---
both are shit
---
Fuck this place
---
4% droprate from one boss and 1% from another 5 bosses. Wouldnt call that common.
---
Shadowpanther is a great resource as well
---
Leave Geralt alone
---
I love this. Great job great meme :)
---
No worries, happens to the best of us.
---
I think the whole skill vs gear argument is only relevant in PvP. PvP isn't about rotation it's about reacting and anticipating your enemies moves, adapting your approach accordingly. 
---
In PvE, I agree. It comes down to a few button presses really and the occasional consumable being timed correctly
---
/golfclap
---
Depends on the individual.  I like fishing and cooking, so I level it on all my characters.  People who don't like fishing and cooking call people like me crazy.  So it's up to you.
---
https://i.imgur.com/T5yPnIG.gif
---
I am as disappointed as you are...
---
Every server will most likely have equally high populations and queue times at launch, so moving doesn't really matter. If your friends want to keep their names, let them.
---
Is this a Joke question?
---
It is definitely more efficient to just Level it on one character.
---
If you feel like doing it on multiple characters go for it. But most People could not be bothered with it I think :D
---
Just because we haven’t been through this exact experience before doesn’t mean the last 15 years of information can’t give us some reasonable assumptions. That and a HEALTHY (key word) level of speculation. 
---
For example, experience and healthy speculation tells us that if player dropoff is as severe as expected and some servers suffer from low populations while others are still high/full, blizzard will open free transfers to the low pop server. This has been done before historically and addresses a concern a lot of people have with Classic.
---
An example that you are correct about is layering and how it will affect the login/launch day experience. We don’t really have anything to base that off of and most of the speculation has been unhealthy, but that won’t stop the doom and gloom folks.
---
I don't know where you'll be getting a staff and the proficiency to use it in a starter zone. 
---
And the thing with dots is that you don't need to stay around and finish the target, you can start casting on the next one. 
---
But in the end you guys can do what you want, if you want to abstain from using dots then go ahead.
---
I disagree. Even if you'll spend 0 money on consumables and just PvP with what you've got, engineering is the best profession by far.
---
Examples of engineering items that stay with you after you create them: Any "reflector" trinket (Shadow, fire, frost), the net trinket, invis trinket, gnomish mind control helmet, gnomish rocket boots, etc. etc.
---
Good call, thanks!
---
You could have the immersion with a tiny bit of thought though. Example: If you skip the first boss and circle back to him later, the dungeon is harder. From your characters perspective, absolutely nothing has changed, but if you have some kind of internally consistent explanation for why your character keeps going back to kill rend blackhand over and over like some kind of sick groundhog day, you can provide some kind of internally consistent explanation for why skipping the first boss makes the dungeon harder. Maybe he's infusing all the orcs in BRS with some kind of magic, maybe he's their figurehead and they become totally demoralised, maybe they got an arms shipment and reinforcements while you were killing him.  
---
Maybe you just give the bosses procedurally generated names and up the difficulty/loot each time you full clear it, or whenever you have all loot for the current difficulty. Take the highest/lowest/average number of completions for a group to get the difficulty for the run. This would resolve the groundhog day issue too. Better yet, come up with a sequence of names. Drakar Blackhand, Rend's second cousin twice removed, has stepped in to fill his shoes, and it turns out he's even tougher. There's a million ways to do it.  
---
One thing that is sure, if they do some classic plus thing, they're definitely going to recycle assets they've already developed. Expect to see zones, dungeons, and raids that you've seen before, whether they do TBC classic or reuse those assets as level 60 content, or something else entirely. Art and animations are not cheap.
---
^^^Nice
---
What i'm talking about is my experience, in the exact same vein you're talking about yours.
---
By saying "Don't tell people what or what not to do with their own time", you just told someone what not do do with their own time.
---
Also: Do you REALLY think there are people out there who aren't deterred by a 0.02% drop chance, but are deterred by some random dude telling them it's probably not the best idea?
---
Is everyone insane these days?
---
Considering how time intensive fishing can be I usually do it on my main and mail stuff as needed. 
---
Of course I actually enjoy fishing sometimes and end up doing it on all my characters. But if you don't enjoy it use the postal service.
---
Silithus. Slightly to the south of the way coming from Ungoro-Crater near the zone-entrance.
---
stop linking this. its wrong on so many items and thus pretty misleading
---
To clarify, this advantage is minimal at low levels since rested xp caps at 1.5 levels.
---
Hunters too :)
---
For dps classes maybe, there is plenty of skill involved in tanking, off tanking, healing and esspecially hybrid specs.
---
Probably not worth it if you can concentrate on one toon. You'll probably level it faster and you can send mats, etc from your alts to your cook. Money is scarce in Classic. Don't waste it on training multiple characters the same skills.
---
Ah, I get it. Not my style of communication, but I respect that. You've clearly put a lot of effort and thought into it just to shitpost. You're like me.
---
I dont know about hopefully, but it probably will be.

I don't think the timer has anything to do with it, tbh.  It's just a standard strath UD run.  Kill the 3 ziggurats, open the gate, kill rivendare.
---
You have to complete a huge quest chain that involves farming the rarest materials in the game and killing bosses in a ton of raids to get the scepter to do the gong quest.  So if your guild does all this stuff and then elects you as the scepter holder then you can bang the gong within the window that someone else bangs it and collect your mount and maybe the title

---
It always help me when theres something to look forward too. Like when classic was announced, it gave me a moral boost. As it came closer to launch i feel more excited and feel spirited lifted in a way. I keep refreshing this sub for something new to kill time with untill this week passes. Some of you might get it.
---
So i feel you bro, im happy for you.
---
I think at this point Classic is already competing with BFA, but not really since you get Classic by paying for BFA, and vice versa.
---
The questing area might exist, but if it was added in a patch that was not 1.1 and 1.2, it might not be in the game.  There is a progressive itemization as when items were added, and Guard Captain didn't exist on release.
---
As for HoJ... Just go in with a Druid/Rogue team of 5 and farm it until everyone gets it.  You'll have it in no time.  There's no reason not to farm HoJ, it's BiS for a LONG time on melee classes.
---
But if someone doesn't want to farm HoJ, the Dire Maul trinket in Phase 2 is a pretty suitable option.
---
I'm rolling a Warlock as well... i'm gonna do Skinning and Mining... saving all of the Mining mats that I get as I level then at 60 I'll drop Mining for Engineering.
---
Same. Back then I figured, great! Everyone can enjoy everything whether you're casual or hardcore. But the reality is that over time, trying to do more became pointless. I tried to explain this to a friend when regarding portals vs zeppelins/boats. Even when both options are present, people will end up going for the most efficient especially when your team is waiting around for you.
---
Infant parent checking in. 4 month old girl, though mine has only rolled over on her own once so far. I can definitely vouch for the chest carrier. She'll take a nap on me, and that gives me a solid 1-2 hours of game time (depending on how tired she is).
---
I mean, sure, there's a certain maximum dps your char can possibly achieve with the given gear, and the closer everyone in the raid gets to that cap, the more marginal the effects of a difference in skill become.
---
Skill usually really shows when things go to hell, and it becomes a challenge to keep attacking steadily or, sometimes, not wiping at all. Most raids would prefer to avoid this kind of situations, though, I think.
---
We do know a lot of things TBH from the Beta.
---
I know what you mean but your post is really generalized. 
---
We already have plenty of Information. Just nothing beyond 40 and nothing to do with any data like population, layers, login, because... how would we :d
---
But I do get you this reddit is full of questions no one will be able to answer until release and all the once that can be answered are not asked because they are already answered... 
---
This is the circle of classic reddit
---
Obviously you should get the items with the best stats on them, leather does nothing for a resto druid. The most well known item druids will wear is the cloth robes of the exalted dress which is bis until Tier 2 or even AQ: https://classicdb.ch/?item=13346
---
&gt; Yeah, people shouldn't follow this "cheat sheet", it's straight up bad.
---
When I looked at this sheet I was seriously asking myself if it is a parody. 1/3rd of the sheet to say "get 4 CP, Evis"? Autoattack included as part of the rotation? "SND: Use it if worth it"? No shit sherlock, nice cheat sheet. Oo
---
yikes
---
I definitely think so! My cousin never played WoW and now he’s giving it a try, and I imagine there will be more people coming to check it out
---
That being said, Classic is a grind, so well see who is still around after a few months
---
&gt;”Just bring back the old game designers”
---
Yeah, that’s not how that works. Maybe a handful would return with some nice bribery, but the majority of the game would be created by new blood. Even then, it *could* be good,  but I feel like there’s an 80% chance the new content would feel awkward, out of place, and cheesy. Most boss mechanics these days look really clunky compared to the simplistic, believable, DnD inspired style of Vanilla.
---
It’s also not as easy as “just keep adding to the game and the game becomes better”. You’ll have new glittery content making MC obsolete, for example. So what would we end up with in that scenario? A classic WoW that’s forever altered, and still no BC which people will absolutely beg for in 2 years.
---
Meanwhile, the demand is there for BC, it’s cost effective, and most of all, Classic is sure to remain a *great* game without any new additions. Classic isn’t perfect, but it’s better now than it would be with a constant stream of raids and cluttered content.
---
Mages bring portals and teleporting. People will complain about where their hearthstone is set, you will go where ever the hell you want. You can make gold afkish in towns selling portals for a gold.  Mages are the best class experience overall in vanilla.
---
Have they released anything similar for EU realms?
---
Surely they must realise that some people haven't even subbed yet and won't do so until release day, so these servers will be even more overloaded?
---
👆🏻 this, close thread :p
---
No, classic needs to remain classic and people should fuck off to private servers if they don't like it.
---
They could still reveal fake results. Self-governed entities can do whatever they want.   
---
The only thing we can do is trust them.

There are some social engineering tactics, like getting everyone to agree to roll greed and then needing it yourself, that will help you increase that 20% chance to win the roll.

Don't Stand in the Fire!

I ran 60fps in the stress test with a GTX 650 on the second highest graphic preset. Their recommended requirements are 100% overkill, they just copy/pasted them from BFA.
---
I love how rugged this looks, I've picked up one from ebay and it smelt of foo foo, looked and felt so unreal plastic - I binned it

Someone put this on a t-shirt. I’m sure people would like one for all the popular specs
---
God, the smug asshole further down the comment chain with the "Did you ever play a hunter back then?" bitching about food and ammo.
---
You know what ammo did and what function it served?
---
It gave every hunter a story about a time they ran out of ammo and had to rush in and defeat the boss with a melee weapon.
---
It made you prepare before you set out on your adventure. Sure, it was inconvenient and costly, but so is going to Disney World and I'd much rather spend some money and get inconvenienced so that when I actually get to my destination, it's memorable.
---
Removing all of the "oh shit" moments also removed all of the "I can't believe I lived" moments that people remember even 15 years later. That's what people want out of MMOs, not "thank god that was so easy for me."
---
40 hours? I feel like I did something wrong. I thought the campaign of both RoC and TfT together was 10 hours at most...? I haven't played the campaign in years though.
---
Maybe they'll run the old commercials with Mr. T.
---
I hope so. Although you can probably start killing devilsaurs around 55 right?
---
Escort quest out of northwatch hold (the barrens).  takes wayyyyy too long.
---
At this point vanilla only adds by having subscriptions increase. (Vanilla can be completed and they can keep working on current expansions without having to hire too many people) If you want vanilla to get NEW content they are gonna have to have people working on it, And that costs money. And that means less profit from subs.
---
When you are fighting trash mobs fights don’t usually last longer than 30 seconds to a minute. Those are the fights where at most you will only want to use it right away only for 1-2 combo points, maybe 3 depending on how you open. I would usually use it right after opening with ambush. That way it’ll be active for majority of the fight still but give you enough time leftover to build up 5 combo points still for an eviscerate before the fight is over.
---
Right... but why would they just delete their own game, after *all of this*? I support being cynical of Blizzard, but it’s like twenty leaps too far to think they’d delete Classic after all the money and time they’ve put into it.
---
She plays a Female Tauren, awesomesauce!
---
My cat will also go Gehennas, make it 40%
---
&gt; The game will 100% die off after Naxx if they don't do classic+ with community in mind. Listening to the community got us Classic in the first place.
---
This is where we progress to TBC. And you have to actually clear Naxx.
---
The dynamic respawns as you got higher level actually got to be a bit of a hindrance because they were spawning so fast.  I want to say when you get to some of your first red mobs it go to be a challenge because you'd kill one and three more would spawn sometimes.  Had to do a fair amount of running away.
---
Yeah so, SW, westfall, iron forge, redbridge, the one next to ironforge the name is escaping me right now.... possibly booty bay and menethil harbor and ararhi highlands and south shore.... if you knock it out at lvl 1 you can take unlimited rez sickness without any penalty.
---
Well, I haven't read the definition either, but in my mind... a cash grab is a cheap move that a company makes to exploit their customers into paying for something they shouldn't have to pay for. 
---
I would be upset if I had to buy Classic, or any potential expansion thereafter because we already own them. I'm okay paying a subscription because I've rationalized it in my mind as a necessary fee for keeping the servers alive. 
---
I'd like to believe they'd do the same in the future, if they do anything at all in the future.
---
There's an addon called Census+.
---
It does a lot of /who-requests with filters in order to find every single person on the server.
---
People who have and use it, can upload their data to http://www.warcraftrealms.com/census.php
---
The more people use the add-on and upload the data, the more accurate it will be.
---
I guess there will be numbers pretty soon after launch.
---
I just checked and WoW vanilla (when it launched) had 4 GB hard drive requirements. That's about what Classic takes now. At the end of Vanilla/start of BC the requirements were 15 GB space. 
---
Considering the content we get now at classic launch is comparable to vanilla launch, the 4 GB the game now takes on your hard drive sounds about right.
---
That was amazing.
---
This makes me feel like a traitor for rolling alliance for classic. I miss Troll-town priest trainers.
---
Does curse works for addon in classic?
---
Tbh, IMO, I’ve played with the settings all the way down and maxed in the stress test to see the difference, and while there is some, overall I thought it was pretty negligible for my taste, I wouldn’t worry too much
---
And if you feel it’s not running well enough and you wanna upgrade, there are several routes you can take to achieve that
---
ugh..hunters so greedy!
---
Classic+ in a similar way to how OSRS been doing it (staying true to the old version and polling everything) would keep Classic going for many more years.   
---
Otherwise Classic will eventually just die.
---
It's hard because it's not in Vanilla.
---
I agree, but let's say classic, tbc and wotlk were released and all of them were a success, do you really think they'd stop there and not release cata as well? I think they'd stop once they see nobody pays for classic cata.
---
It's Activision after all, they go where the money is and when they get money from the first three versions of wow, they'll try the 4th too and only call it quits, when they don't get money anymore.
---
Do you have a blizzard source for this by any chance? I don't doubt you, I'd just like to see it so I can reference it for others.
---
Oh I'm not offended it takes a lot to do that. Just a pet peeve of mine when someone says Go do this, or Don't do that. Unless they pay my salary they aren't my boss. I agree 99.999999999% people don't recall what they are in for that's the beauty of it. There's new people thinking they are going to get to 60 by Saturday and be BiS'd out, but will bare be 30 by the weekend. It's going to be great.
---
I too reserved names on Herod, but am probably going to switch to Mankrik (PvE) to play with an old friend who really wants to play there.  If I had more than about 5 hours of playtime per week, I'd probably just wait out the queue times on Herod.  Queues never last, and I'd be surprised if the queue was more than 5 minutes long this time next month for Herod.  If you've got decent sized chunks of playtime (more than 2 hours at a time) I wouldn't feel too bad about the queue.
---
Gear score lmfao
---
Hated that shit, gear didn't mean you could play
---
Perfectly viable. There’s no stat bonus for wearing your highest armor class in vanilla.
---
Good thinking! Lol Probably my favorite character off the entire series!

Consider the context of the discussion that you're having...

Seems like DPS warrior loot to me :&gt;
---
That is awesome
---
Dont use weapons/spells that uses a debuff slot, unless told to ofc.
---
Run well implies running without performance stutters, it doesn't mean 4K ultra HD on a 5120×2880 monitor.  
---
You can turn the graphics down and it'll run on a potato, yes.
---
Myself and my friends are rolling Gehennas!
---
I don't insult non sentient creatures.
---
Nope just a newbie with a dumb question apparently lol. I was curious if there was some benefit I wasn't seeing for multiple characters. Thanks for your input!
---
Make friends with a priest and duo up for levelling.
---
Running well does not mean using high settings. Running well means a smooth and high frame rate.
---
Okay thanks!
---
That would *never happen*. Why would they just trash can all of their work, instead of... I don’t know, let both versions stand alone!
---
This sounds familiar.
---
100%
---
Yeah its great :)
---
I’ve had one first hand experience with this. We were doing Toc 5 man, I was on a pally alt in green and blues getting some easy gear 4 guildies 1 random. The random whispers me after the boss fight. “Holy shit how does someone with shit gear do so much damage” my response was I know how to play the class and knew the fight. Hopefully changed that persons perspective that gear doesn’t equal good.
---
Is there a rogue trainer in TB?
---
He bought the fabric and stained it and painted the symbol on. Then used a propane torch to burn / give it the rugged look that it has. Incredibly talented dude.
---
Got a fair few on Shazz, seem to be evenly spread out.
---
Me too!
---
You need about 42000 quest items that drop from elites and that's just the beggining of the quest line.
---
I really hope so. I will report them for harassment, both the danish, spanish, polish and whatever.
---
I am doing the exact same, mained priest vanilla and TBC.
---
Everyone said spriests were wannabe warlocks so... might as well do warlock this time.
---
Ferrr the herrrrddd!!
---
Don't announce in VOIP like a dunce : "I need x Buff!"
---
Don't ask warlocks for a summon unless you absolutely need one (and not as a result of your own laziness). 
---
Don't discuss loot decisions mid raid.
---
Don't afk during trash.
---
What you got?
---
Haha exactly my thoughts
---
"Light will forge you a new one" as paladin
---
I'm not actually sure if it is. He's not selling anything technically, He's being paid to delete his own charicter
---
If you really want to breeze ir just insert the cores "whosyourdaddy", "warpten", "greedisgood 10000000" and "iseedeadpeople" it males you invonerable, have all reasources, ser the whole map, and makes you build super fast
---
That’s what happens when you listen to the lowest common denominator.
---
Huh, learn something every day! I never thought of using a bankalt to disenchant. Guess I’ll start doing that as well!
---
10 hours after the first person bangs the gong.
---
Those specs are wrong. They copy/pasted the recommended specs for Battle for Azeroth. Classic has much lower requirements, with the minimum being a Core 2 Duo and an 8800GT. This game will literally run on a PC from 2007. A 960M will run it perfectly fine.
---
this is not 100% true there is alot of Danish horde guilds going firemaw

Mining/skinning/etc costs ~24 copper to learn, and the tools for them cost about ~80copper. I might be off by a few copper but its more or less spot on.
---
First aid costs 1s to learn.
---
There is no level requirement for these (confirmed by me on stress test).
---
I believe there is a level requirement for CRAFTING proffs, which is 5 (so you need 5 if you want to disenchant on your alt).
---
I wish they did. I remember reading the chuck norris commercials made the website crash from the incoming traffic
---
Mage, but the Arcane tree bottom 3 talents aren't connected properly. 1/10
---
But really, this is super cool.
---
How long? 3 months?
---
&gt; I really don't understand your take on this
---
I think of other players as the human beings they are, playing a game. I'm not selfish. I don't want to spoil their enjoyment. I'd like to be afforded the same respect. Is that really so hard to understand?
---
&gt;not in the mood for a challenge
---
It's about not about being while 'not in the mood' is when you can't possibly compete. Either they are higher level or way better geared than you. They kill you. You can't kill them. They just kill you repeatedly. Is that fun for you?
---
&gt;and just going AFK and not ressing for 10 minutes
---
Unfortunately the one time that happened to me, after being killed a few times. I didn't ress for 20mins. Came back 20mins later, he was still there stealthed behind me ready to kill me within 5 second of ressing.
---
&gt;What if somebody tagged your mobs, would that be considered griefing too?
---
Griefing is a bit of a strong word, but I consider is rude and selfish. My good memories of classic were coming across the opposite faction and not killing or mob stealing from them. But pointing towards the quest boss we were both obviously wanting to kill, and taking turns killing the boss helping each other all without being able to communicate. That seems a whole lot more rewarding that randomly killing somebody who can't possibly compete.
---
Then why is there a druid trainer in Stormwind?
---
This looks awesome! Wouldn’t happen to have an Undercity one?
---
IGN: Paid to pump and dump
---
just right, starter zones kinda packed. but once u get ahead of the pack or weeks/months later you'll have enough interactions for it to stay fun. not too much not too little people in lategame zones. I even would like it if they move the cap to 12 or 14k. 12k is probably perfect. anything below 10k is too little imo
---
I know hunters can name their pets and summon them again and again to actually have a conversation.   But thats lame.
---
The issue with the gearscore addon was that it applied an arbitrary number to a player that had nothing at all to do with how good that player was. In fact, we used to skirt around people's GS/ilvl requirements - much as we do today - by just equipping higher ilvl gear, regardless of how shit it is for our specs. 
---
It's true that a higher geared person CAN do higher DPS, but it doesn't mean that they WILL. In my opinion, displaying ilvl, gearscore, (and that other addon that ranked people from achievement points), was bad for the game as it raised the barrier to entry for potentially better players who didn't have good enough gear, while also allowing everyone and their mother to, at a glance, decide how good you are at the game by the number displayed next to your name.
---
It's not just auto attacking but really, you toss out a judgement, seal and then auto attack and toss out a stun when you can.
---
It does help that your survivability is through the roof but it's just slow and boring.
---
However it's the Netflix class. Toss up the office on a second monitor and just enjoy the easy grind even if it takes longer
---
450 in patch 3.0 ;) 
---
Another answer already covered it: total skill after lures, rod, hat, and boots
---
ewwww
---
...Nice
---
Even worse.
---
I loved and hated it, but the Broodlord Head quest chain that leads towards the AQ40 Gong. I never got the mount, but the healing dagger is absurd. The quest itself is just so long, and with so many parts, it's great and terrible at the same time.
---
Very Nice
---
World PvP is great and in my opinion the best form of PvP for what WoW is supposed to be. I dislike anything instanced (besides dungeons or raids).
---
However, there is a big issue with world PvP, especially if you tie it in with stuff like rewards for holding a position or conquering zones or castles. And that is faction balance per server. It was a huge issue back in WotLK with Wintergrasp. On some servers where factions were horribly imbalanced, with a lot more alliance than horde ratio for example, Horde would have a really hard time getting control of Wintergrasp. Alliance simply overwhelmed them each battle with sheer numbers. Which was very bitter since Vault of Archavon was only available to the faction holding Wintergrasp.
---
I loved Wintergrasp, by the way. Absolutely amazing. But flaws like this can't be ignored. If they would implement new World PvP stuff with rewards etc., they'd also have to somehow "balance" it out. Instancing it is the easy way, sharding would be another way but... we all don'T want that, right?
---
&gt;  there are people who want everything fucking handed to them constantly I.e catchup mechanics, LFG, LFR, etc. 
---
And those people can play retail.  As cool as nostalgia can be sometimes, it's not worth splitting the community, introducing stuff that removes the magic of vanilla, and never getting to see what Classic could've been if the game stayed in that dimension.
---
What if they do implement the classes? And we get educated on the races?! 
---
Mindblown.
---
the problem with any heroic version of dungeons, beside the approach blizzard chose with Ulduar is that its insanely immersion breaking and gives the game a treadmill feeling just by giving you the option to do the same thing twice... or in wotlk 4 times with 10/25/nh/h versions.
---
Classic design would mean 1 difficulty, which again would mean new difficult high lvl dungeons instead of low lvl dungeons copy pasted with higher stats.
---
Classic + not BC-
---
Wtf that bottom one.  I've been out of the loop a long time.  Are there 3 factions?
---
You can't put all the blame in the players.
---
&gt;People asked for xrealm dungeon finder
---
...because regular dungeon finder queues were too long.
---
&gt;people asked for LFR
---
...because the community was too weak for casual solo players to be introduced to raids the proper way.
---
&gt;people complained about having to use ammo as hunters
---
...because so many other QoL changes had been made, why not one for hunters?
---
&gt;people wanted flying in old azeroth
---
...because there's a disconnect when you can fly everywhere else.
---
&gt;then people wanted faster flying and more portals
---
...because once you can fly anywhere, travel becomes monotonous and boring.
---
You see what I mean? The players didn't always ask for game breaking mechanics, more likely they were asking for the already implemented mechanic to be improved, since it was there.
---
In classic, we're okay with not having these things because the alternative is just fine. We understand that LFG/LFR kills community, that the time it takes to go from point A to B might be longer but is a lot more engaging, and that small QoL changes are convenient but also take away from the class responsibilities/fantasies. Some of this comes from experience, and some comes from playing a game the way it was before Blizzard made changes to appeal to a larger crowd.
---
Fair advice thx.
---
Ret can heal in dungeons just stock up on int gear (even if it’s cloth) and keep in your bags
---
Terrible, don't lock yourself in to a weapon type pre60, get 3/3 aggression.
---
Where is relentless strikes?
---
coolest shit here xD
---
Obtain mount 20/80
---
Don't you mean 40/60 ?
---
Isn't there a profile you can share a link to? I could swear I saw a youtube video where someone used this and shared his profile link in comments which you could just copy/paste to get the exact same setup.
---
My laptop flips out if I try to play Fortnite on the lowest settings but doesn’t even heat up running Classic.
---
This is exactly what should be done.
---
The problem with this is a) small sample size, b) missing new realms, c) some people have left Herod and others for new realms.
---
I'm waiting for release date to pick a realm. Guranteed Skerams gonna get zerged as well.
---
Hopefully for those you needs to buy it. Hopefully not for those you wants to sell it.
---
filthy casual.
---
But are you certain there will be a 'hunter' as you call them in the game? I think that's just hearsay.
---
How about 73
---
That doesn't say what you are saying it says. So downvotes for deliberately misrepresentation of a statement to enhance your own argument, which isn't adding anything useful. Seems like downvotes as intented.
---
Making a game to also appeal to casuals doesn't mean not appealing to hardcore players. The game was designed to appeal to both.
---
I guess if you don't ever want to use any consumables or get an epic mount. But even then, 1g per day would mean you're barely even playing the game. Even just doing dungeon runs will get you more than that per day.
---
First two seasons were definitely better than the second two. Still enjoyed Cavill and Rhys Meyers all throughout though.
---
Making a backup on Skeram. Herod to Stal refuge. Now maybe Skeram if queues are rough.
---
Yeah it'll be mana and health intensive, but that's how we like to play because we're gigantic children.
---
Weak. Me and all my dutch friends/guldies are going to Gehennas
---
You are not alone friend. I would choose the one with the eyes, cuz glowing eyes in some gear is noice
---
I farmed strath every day on my gnome DK to get this mount. I got it around the trial of the crusader patch. It wasn't worth it and I hardly ever use it cuz I have a water strider and 2 seat rocket. :(
---
I've been questing a bit on my retail main that I haven't played since November. It is not doing a good job holding me over.
---
If you think they need to hide poll results in order to fake the numbers then you have a thing or two to learn about computers.
---
Thanks. I didn't play much in terms of private servers and wasn't really in tune with things like number of players with original launch back in high school and college.
---
America or europe? For america thalnos for europe i dont know since i play in america
---
And some bastard will type it in all lower case so it stands out like a sore thumb on your interface among General, Trade and LookingForGroup.

7 dwarfs encounter in BRD
---
We should make a classic guild of Twin Cities people
---
In case I am unable to make the AMA, would someone be able to ask the following question ? cheers!
---
&gt;Has the team thoroughly tested the Paladin seal system; and specifically, the mechanic of seal twisting?  
---
&gt;One interaction which has been noticed not to work is seen in twisting Seal of Command into Seal of Righteousness. This should produce the result where Seal of Righteousness damage is applied to both the original white swing and the consecutive Seal of Command swing; this currently does not occur and speculation points towards this being a result of the Spell Batch system. In looking towards The Burning Crusade, we know that a similar spell Seal of Blood produced exactly this effect and to this end Seal of Righteousness should function in the exact same fashion.  
---
&gt;To this end; is the current interaction of seal twisting Seal of Command and Seal of Righteousness being not possible accurate? Or is this merely a bug yet to be fixed in WoW Classic?  
---
&gt;Best Regards,  
---
&gt;Archeon.
---
Hunter isn't particularly good at duels but they're top tier for group pvp.
---
Wondering the same thing.
---
Sorry you’re correct I knew the item just didn’t think about the phase, it’ll be with us with DM. 
---
Plus we hunters don’t need any help being hated.
---
6 days
---
It is. Someone report this shit.
---
I agree, but it's an option. Personally, I just want to experience TBC and WotLK again. If that means they re-release them 100% the way they were, I'd be ecstatic. If they rebuild them to fit the Vanilla style to appease the Classic purists, I'd be happy too. I just want to see them get the classic treatment.
---
That's some sad shit right there
---
Yeah thats true but a large portion of are
---
That's not literally what I'm saying at all. I'm saying that the swedes I know will play on Gehennas because they prefer playing with Swedes for the most part. Not swedes as in all swedes. I'm not mad in the slightest and I'm not pulling shit out of my ass because I made it very clear that it's what I've gathered from my own personal experiences and that I do not speak for the majority in any way whatsoever... unlike what you're doing. 
---
I understand that not everyone can into reading comprehension though so it's ok.
---
"We are all haunted by the past, Maraad. Few of us ever get the opportunity... to change it!"
---
You can't break coil like that, it's a terrify effect.

I had the same family around for the last 11 years, I can't say the same about classic.
---
I thought it was one of the few shows that had a decent ending. Yes, the scene in the final season when Henry commands him get down on his knees and not to die is such a good scene.
---
cant wait to camp you and people like you :)
---
what's the stalagg sub?

Good stuff!

Maybe im using the wrong terminal? Ctrl+Alt+T  
---
My laptop is running the following specs  
---
Intel Core i5  
---
8GB Ram  
---
256GB SSD
---
Loosely yes but there’s always outliers. Kingsblood spawns in the barrens but has a minimum 125 skill; much higher than the fish / ores / other herbs in the zone.
---
Yeah... We're the same fuckers who welcomed flying mounts, summoning stones and dungeon finder.
---
I'm not sure.  If they asked like "do you want flying mounts?" I'd be scared that a huge amount of people would vote yes, despite them ultimately being bad game design and leading to all sorts of game design issues.
---
hehe yeah thats true but I think every realm thats out atm will have a huge population and queues
---
But that's not how it works once you create a name the name is yours for a period of time even if you delete the character
---
Not conclusive due to sample size, but 58/40 atm in favor of Horde (2% undecided).
---
Im for new horizontal content.
---
They should introduce new raids that provide gear in the strength of naxx and AQ40. Maybe gear that just makes other specs viable too.
---
Like this we avoid two things:
---
- thinning out the vanilla playerbase
---
- creating another loot spiral that people have to chase
---
Questie shows you all the quests you've completed.  I'd just use an excel sheet and keep track of it manually along with using questie to confirm which you've done.
---
Well, using SND with 1 combo point means the mob survives the majority of the duration every time, but its generally not something  thats recommended.
---
The hell you say... people still stand in fire.

Do we know if any swedes are going to Firemaw? don't wanna change from Gehennas to Firemaw if no swedes are there!
---
Separate*
---
Yeah, the engineering shield that drops in MC is a must for AoE tanking warriors.
---
Which large guilds are going Gehennas then?
---
Flying mounts and LFG/LFR were SUPER popular ideas with the casual crowd. Easily over 75%.
---
r/theydidntdothemath
---
That’s a wall hanger imo very cool
---
A silly statement proven by years of private server populations which ultimately Nostralius forced their hand. Some gamers like spamming buttons, others like a challenge.
---
Has nothing to do with “Americans” just really fucking stupid people. I’ve lived in CDT my entire life and since I was old enough to understand time and timezones(lets just say 10 years old) I’ve been able to know what time it is on each coast. Not a hard skill, just stupid people.
---
I think it was more balanced than that 😭
---
This is the best argument against it. So many changes over the years were lauded at first (reagent removals, portals to every major city, LFD, etc.) and it wasn’t until later when most realized these “inconveniences” are necessary for making the game feel like a world.
---
The real MVP
---
another comment suggested you could multibox a team to clear it, circumventing the rolling issue.
---
Nice one:)
---
Based on my experience from polls and watching r/classicwow subreddit i can gather that on average the majority of swedes still won't be on Gehennas, And the fact is that majority of Swedes prefer English over VOIP.
---
I can guess that if you are around the age of 12 as you suggested to me earlier it would be simpler to talk swedish to swedes but again, From what the average posts on this subreddit adds up to is that every server will have a split nationality.
---
I think you forgot a couple words in your last sentence.
---
Your ideas are retarded and way too restrictive. The way OSRS does it is perfectly fine, more than that even it's been extremely successful.
---
75% supermajority to push through minor changes and maybe a higher supermajority for major ones and one max-level character required to vote is more than restrictive enough.
---
The superior Org
---
People be stupid
---
It's also a war, get used to it. Can't turn in quests? Turn tail and find a new zone or start a raid/get help from big boys and try to push them back. 
---
That is wPvP, it's dynamic and unforgiving.
---
Play the one that you want, honestly. Arms is probably a little bit slower than fury, but it's going to be more consistent. Fury, will be much faster if you have a healer, and a bit faster solo, but you'll always be threading that fine line between life and death - especially if you're trying to be as efficient as possible.
---
Not nice ..

They'll do free transfers off Herod and such when they want to get rid of layering, but outside of that, dont expect paid transfers. Paid transfers kind of ruin the responsibility/community aspect of vanilla. Given that if I get a bad rep I can just paid transfer off, and potentially come back later with a different name.
---
Should be a note that druids are very difficult to master. Whether its hybrid pvp (one mistake or dodge/parry can fuck you royally) or feral in PvE. The skill cap is higher than other classes.
---
Cool guides tho, been enjoying them!

I wish you had put the regular version next to it so we could compare.

I don't actually get to see the login screen anymore these days with [battle.net](https://battle.net) instantly putting you into realm/character select

Not as dumb as paladins in their pink dress

With the name I got I aint going anywhere!
---
August 27 is not in pst...
---
Fury doesn't kick in until level 40+ since it requires a considerable amount of crit.
---
Arms is more consistent.
---
The first respec costs 50s or 1G  if I remember correctly, that should not hold you back. 2h fury is imo the correct way to level sub 40, mostly because Piercing Howl is an absolute life saver if you ever pull mob too many or want to run out of a tunnel without killing all the respawns. But also because the damage is good and the 5% crit early helps.
---
I cant speak for other classes. Assume probably.
---
Your business training is complete.
---
Jeg vil egentlig råde dig til at holde kæft. Du har aldrig være indenover beslutninger hos majoriteten af de danske guilds, som jeg står sammen med. Vi ruller Firemaw og alt andet er spin. Vel mødt!
---
Unless you are trying to get into a bleeding edge progression guild, you'll be fine. Expect to mostly heal in raids and you are able to do tank or heals for preraid stuff. If you are on a pvp server, you should have a little extra breathing room since pvp is a concern anyhow.
---
That was my initial thought as well actually but tried to get silly with it. Will probably edit for tomorrow's post :)
---
What is that? A helm for gnomes?
---
Using the most downranked heal above level 20 because it is so mana-efficient due to +heal prevents you from benefitting from one of your most important stats: Spirit.
---
Looking at HPM as most important metric would make sense if Mana was a finite resource. But it isn't. Healers for whom others can buy the time to step out of the 5-second-rule can actually regenerate a lot of mana.
---
I've done the math and compared the HPS you generate over something I called a cycle. A cycle consists of spending all your mana and then regenerating mana while not casting or ideally wanding.
---
Constantly healing with Heal Rank 1 means it'll take you longer to go OOM for the first time than it would have taken you with using max-rank, regging back to full and then using max-rank again.
---
Thing is that the overall healing generated in that same timeframe is about 20% higher with the max-ranks, with very good gear. And the discrepancy just gets bigger with worse gear, as Spirit doesn't increase as much as +Heal does.
---
If you see healing as a group effort and have people take "shifts" in healing and regging you increase the overall potential output of both healing and damage.
---
That's why I think that Downranking as a means of increasing HPM is vastly overemphasized. Of course downranking should still be done in order to prevent overhealing.
---
To be honest I'm just pointing out the fact that the nordic server project is by far mostly made up of Swedish players, but is being sold as a coalition of scandinavian guilds, which is just not true.
---
I don't understand your point about the Spanish coalition, since I'm literally making the point that if it's mostly swedes it should just be Swedish server project, and not "Swedish guilds plus a few Finnish and half-Norwegian guilds"
---
It's misleading, especially for Danish players, since most of the Danish communities have no connection to the nordic server project, and are not even rolling on the same server.
---
Some of my best memories of playing WoW are having my window open during the fall and getting an occasional cold breeze while having a blanket wrapped around me in front of the computer.
---
Doubt it. Ex WoW players is a big demographic though, so should be good amount of players.
---
I mean, Isn't TBC pretty much the same as vanilla except added Arena for PvP and flying?
---
Websites are telling Rune of the Guard Captain isn't gonna be available at P1. True?
---
Do not need to level them.  Just make the name in the log in screen, then go level your first 60.  You can mail your level 1's that have not logged into the game as many pieces of mail as your pitiful gold can afford.
---
You should try out the PTR server. Nobody will bother you there.
---
I had a gnome rogue named Oa on Feathermoon back in the day. Got a bunch of grief for it since it was an RP server, but I was really into Green Lantern at the time.
---
He's not even your real dad.
---
The Eye of Dalaran - it helps the mages watch people use the bathroom
---
Awesome, really great asset to have!
---
Only real problems ElvUI had in the last stress test was unitframes not showing hp, castbar, debuff timers (same for nameplates) and backpack being buggy. Otherwise it was working fine.
---
Maybe...I kind of think Robin would chuckle though.
---
R.I.P.
---
Arms and Fury leveling work exactly the same. Meaning you will be pressing the same buttons in the same order regardless of the spec.
---
So it comes down to personal preference.
---
I like Enrage and Flurry in the Fury tree. When they proc they boost my happiness. Even tho Mortal Strike is clearly &gt; Bloodthirst.
---
So pick what seems more fun to you.
---
I am not trying to imply you did, I agree with you.
---
Well shoulders are usually red. Helmet depends on whether you have it showing or not. If you do then it will be Brownish.
---
Chest is usually Gold/Green. Your Weapons will have more of a red/green Color.
---
The Leveling is for professions (:
---
Engineering if you are into PvP.
---
I mean, the top 10 streamers charge something like 30,000$+ an hour for their sponsored streams, and they get a lot of offers.

The other pull had 1000 votes and was 51/49

sappers, grenades, battle chicken, arcanite dragonling

I wonder if they’ll decide to add that quest into classic since it didn’t come til WotLK.

It's so heavy, they have an Absurd macro transaction and they won't admit that the entire Attunement mechanic that it is left as in the Leveling requirements is a terrible mechanic that is there solely for them to perpetuate the macro transaction.

There's more than one?
---
quick question as I didn't play classic. Isn't a regular attack an auto attack? so when I looked at that rotation it looks to me like sinister strike and then having to manually attack with weapon. is that right?
---
Is there not an auto attack?
---
Engineering.  LW for mail gear at 60 is not good.
---
Recommended settings are always a bit high, and for a good reason. They're recommended for a reason, it means you'll be able to play the game (within reason) with whatever settings you want without sacrificing any performance. 
---
All the M cards are trash, but it'll play the game fine.

Druids can!

If you're with a group its not bad. The NPC is slow but you can kill shit along the way.
---
The BoEs are prob gonna be way more than 10 gold at the start though
---
I too am curious on how paid transfers will be implemented. There's no telling how things will be in a month or two and it would be great to have free/paid options to let people move
---
what's world of diablo ?

Wish I could pen.

Someone do rogue one please
---
Nagrand is and always will be my favourite zone, it was so peaceful and beautiful and stunning in an understated, quiet kind of way. It's the first thing I picture when I get nostalgic about WoW and if they ever release TBC I might shed a few tears when I finally go back.
---
Turned my downvote into an upvote, but...
---
Lok’tar Ogar.
---
Yup. Which is why we’re not calling it until Monday :p
---
Amazing how people still don't realize in 2019 that Engi is the best profession for *PvE* as well.
---
My concern is the number of people who never get involved because of queue times. It is hard to charm new players who have zero reason to sit in a queue for two hours and go back to retail. I would rather server merges later and lose my name than have the population so bottlenecked like this. 
---
I want to trust blizzard but they have been guided a lot by feedback from the community with classic. The overwhelming feedback right now is that we want more servers.
---
I disagree, people will be a few levels ahead of me but when it comes time for them to run far to turn in a quest or get to a new zone for xyz and they are already burned out I will start passing them since I can just fly there and take a few minutes break and get coffee or water use the bathroom.
---
Trust me, if playing full arcane is what’s going to make you happy, then go full arcane. At that point min/maxing your dps really doesn’t matter.
---
Well if you do wanna go paladin you could always have an alt on another server :)
---
If you aren’t focused on being a hardcore raider or pushing big numbers, just play the game how u wanna play
---
At least you get free shipping.
---
I think that between Mists of Pandaria and BFA, I've had less social interaction than in a week of Classic.

yes. =)

This and 'you got to play wow' are my staple vanilla music videos.

Not to mention world of roguecraft's playlist.

It isn't 00.01 though... It's 00:00.  Shows how "smart" europeans are.
---
It's just stupid people not knowing what time zone they live in.

&gt; to live alone and play wow as much as i can haha 
---
I am right now for the one time in my life of almost 35 years now actualizing this for myself, do not underestimate the power of SELF my friend.

If you are not actualized as yourself you CAN NOT benefit others, at all. If you aren't accessing you, nothing you do will help anyone.
---
I'm celebrating classic wow, so yes I do think this belongs here. :)
---
Wailing Caverns specifically is a fuckin labirynth. Rolled on a P server and leveled to 47 just to familiarize myself with all the early dungeons. 
---
Had plans of getting to 60 but I didn't want to commit with everything being irrelevant once classic releases next week.

Missed the Warchief! How can you go into Classic and not pay respects.
---
&gt;However, nobody will be laughing at your damage
---
Lol why is this so funny? It sounds so bitter
---
I thought uncollected mail was returned after 30 days.  Also it is the new mail system not the classic one so it will be interesting to see how it works unless someone tested it on the beta.
---
I like this a lot. I want a desktop background of those totems and other things drawn in that style. Reminds me of yoshi's island art style. Good job!

Firemaw all the way

Excuse me--this is World of Fashioncraft.

they would never let the players decide, luckily because its a bad idea, take osrs for example.
---
Looks like a Hunter weapon
---
Isn't it basically exactly the same model as the skeletal warhorse only slightly different color? Imagine the feeling if it drops and a freaking undead gets it.
---
That's on you for assuming and taking PTO off an assumption.  It said on their site the launch time is in BST for ages.
---
Depends what you consider new blood tbh, I've played a few months through MoP but was far too young to play vanilla other than at my "childminder" 's (new word tell me if it ain't right) place who had a son into raiding. 
---
There is a full spectrum of new players with various knowledge about what vanilla is tbh.
---
Leveling would be Hpal/warlock.... pvp I'm pretty sure its Hpal/warrior.
---
Anyone on a PvP server would be insane to not take Engineering.
---
Jokes on you, one of the main mechanics of Jaina was to stand in the fire.
---
Out of curiosity - what spec do you hate it in?
---
I'll be honest, I liked it specifically as Holy in Mists of Pandaria (no other expansion got it right), and I liked it as Ret, it was better than "you're a warrior but you also heal".  Although I like old school Paladins better.
---
The funny this is that the OSRS community is making mistakes I saw WoW make. When they vote to make a really difficult quest easier they make fun of the people who are against them by saying things like "I had to suffer so everyone else has to suffer too. boo hoo". It's the same attitude I saw from the WoW community when they started letting people get mounts at level 20.
---

I can only share my experience from playing Wow, and the majority of swedes I came across tend to shy away from playing with fellow swedes . Not stating a fact, just my own experience. (Source: Being a Swede my self)
---
This is false rumors, dont know where you have that info, however the LARGE part of the Danish community is going to firemaw both horde and alliance, the is alot of documentation for this
---
well....it is relevant in actuality, unless you are going for a low /played lvl 60 for novelty.
---
Especially since the beta streaming from people like pokimane which brought the game to a whole new audience
---
I think it was a compliment saying you’re English is already very good :)
---
In classic? I want to say no actually but I'm not sure. It was definitely disabled for name reservations, but I'm not sure if that feature was actually in classic or not and if they will enable it again.
---
Well that's unfortunate. Happy grinding, NElves!
---
That's a lot of stuff I didn't consider, thanks! I guess I'm going Impale and I'm definitely going to grab Imp. Overpower. I plan to rush Bonebiter over Whirlwind Axe too. Hoping that works out.
---
I want the horde version of this.  I already know the alliance areas.
---
Yup when I leveled my lock in classic I was always looking for packs of mons and I pretty much never had to stop and rest. 
---
It was the funnest classic leveling experience by far for me. Hunter in co.parison was boring af.
---
Rogue/warrior? Countered by 1 mage.
---
Make a starter account and do lvl 20 bg's 😏🙄
---
TBC was not an expansion.  In fact WoW expansions were not "expansion".   
---
They did NOT expand on the game, they invalidated the old game. They  released a new game.   
---
Expansions means you can pick up the game with the expansion, ENJOY THE FULL VANILLA GAME, then venture into the extra content.    
---
This is not so for WOW.    
---
No thanks. No. TBC.
---
The launch date is 0000 on August 27th BST.
---
If you don't care that much about what realm you're on, pick whatever the lowest one is some hours before launch. Login and create a character there. Sit on the character screen spinning your character round now and again so you don't get logged out. Get ready to hit "enter world" as soon as humanly possible when launch arrives.
---
I think that should all work.
---
Swifty and athene need to powerlevel
---
T3 BiS tank warriors are the most badass looking thing in the game, and most of their tanking gear is badass.
---
T3 BiS dps warriors look like... they enjoy bright colours. There is a point, during MC / BWL progression where warriors can look incredible (Helm of Endless Rage, Drake Talon Pauldrons, etc.), but that starts to slide when Chromatic boots and AQ/Naxx gear is introduced.
---
The login queue will be to login. If you're at character selection screen, you've already logged in. 
---
So you will be waiting at the screen where you enter your username and password, waiting to press Login button before other people. If you're not first, you will be given a queue. When your time comes, you will be able to choose server etc.
---
But what is the Hungarian realm?
---
I have a 960m and it runs at 60fps on max. You're fine
---
For world PvP I feel like i would hate running into a mage/rogue combo.
---
So satisfying, well done
---
Yeah, this belt is great at 18. 50% chance it's replacing a white item.
---
The way he has it listed, yes it is. If he changed some words than ugh, Well thing gets complicated. (and may force bliz to reword their tos if they care enough)
---
The only real benefit that I can see would be if you wanted to try to get the [STV Fishing tornament rewards](https://legacy-wow.com/fishing-guide-stranglethorn-fishing-extravaganza/) on multiple characters.
---
You might actually be correct with that return Thing!
---
But what happens if it is returned and then not collected for 30 Days? Returned again? :P That is soooo much Postage fee they miss out on there... :D
---
This is really great. I honestly prefer this version of Org to the one currently in retail. It's just gotten so bloated now, I really don't like it.
---
They are literally only doing it until things die down, and server population caps will also be much higher than they were way back when.
---
Every time I see these I always think why did people moan about pruning and say rotations are simple now
---
r/StalaggClassic
---
I'd bet the vast majority of two and three letter names were grabbed by bots.
---
Congrats you have earned yourself a downvote all with love &lt;3
---
PvE server population doesn't have too much to do with which faction has the topend raiders. I'd be surprised if the best raiders in Classic aren't on PvP servers
---
If you talk to a city guard in any city they will put a pin on your map for these things. (for those who didn't know)

Thank you! Saved!

Oh my god that's a HUGE gnome!

Yes that is all we learn.  That's why we have the world's leading economy.

“Might be pretty rape”

😂 wtf this terminology
---
Yeah but in OSRS you can solo most bosses multiple times per hour and they net a lot of profit.
---
wakes you back up
---
It's a really damn long struggle. It will hurt, but you will become stronger in suffering... Or something.
---
Right. Logging in to reserve a name is one thing, average time to create is like 5 minutes. 
---
Think of it like you're going to a club and there's a "One in, One out policy going on". Then picture the line up standing in is 10,000 people long. 
---
I can only imagine the rage that will happen when someone finally gets in and then their internet fucks up and they get DC'd and have to wait in the back of the line again...

A huge chunk of the Swedish and Finish are going to be on Gehennas, see here: http://nordicclassic.jinnis.se/

A well geared end-game dps warrior looks like the very embodiment of fear, when you're close enough to see him you better leg it.

Oh wow.. I was casually browsing this sub and I noticed that the thumbnail looked quite similar..  thank you for posting my video I appreciate it :)

What if I told you you can also get that name on Firemaw
---
I did it on the stress test, you are likely right. It took a while. I had to stand next to the peons and wait for them to fall asleep because everyone and their mother was doing the same quest. Prolly took 1min+ per peon not including finding them. Roughly 10min on a small xp quest.

---
Relatable, I skipped Legion and BfA but my IRL friends were planning and hyped to play Classic. I shrugged it away for a while, but I slowly got excited until the point I cant wait anymore. Dis gun b gud.
---
It wont be anywhere near as quick. People were hopping in grabbing names and hopping out on name reservation. On release when they in they wont be leaving and if their forced out they will immediately try to get back in. But we must ride the storm Shazzrah will be the EU hub and we MUST HOLD.
---
Is that real??
---
Depends.  Sure, when there are a few but there is also not a lot of gold in the economy at the start either so prices stay in check. 
---
Even at that, you can get crap like a Dusky Belt that's a green BoE that at least has some agi/stam on it and would be good enough if you can't find any of the other blue belts I listed.
---
The real point is that there is a lot more than this BIS list everyone loves throwing around.  If you show up not in this BIS list, and know how to push sinister strike and 5 combo point SnD, you're going to be fine.
---
Do you know of other items that have a similar effect? I never knew about these and can't find anything online.
---
Waiting for the Warrior one 😁

I'm not asking the question, I'm stating it's not possible.

---
I’m curious to know what the alliance to horde split is on these servers. 
---
Also I’m just jumping on the hype train as of last night. What’s the phase 2 idea?
---
Thanks for the comment :) I've definitely never played Classic before. I've heard it's hard but I'm sure I'm still underestimating it lol I'll definitely be taking your advice though and most likely will be sticking to frost and biding my time until AQ or Nax like most people have suggested :)
---
Wait, the only people who should be allowed to vote are those who play at least 6.5 hours a day, EVERY day? That’s nearly 45 hours a week; MORE than a full-time job! Aside from all your other demands, which are, frankly, ridiculous, this alone invalidates everything you’ve written.
---
Catering to the 1% has never been a winning strategy. If you restrict voting to no-lifers, honor-grind PvPers, and bleeding edge raiders, then you end up with a game that only no-lifers, honor-grind PvPers, and bleeding-edge raiders will want to play. That will kill Classic even faster than MTX and Pandaland.
---
What is Thenx going for ?
---
Balance (Note that you do not get 31 points in balance for moonkin form) in world PvP should get a green mark, I'm more sure about that than giving them a green mark in battlegrounds.
---
Well let’s just say that isn’t a shadow behind him. It’s a stain, from having bogbutt.
---
&gt;By saying "Don't tell people what or what not to do with their own time", you just told someone what not do do with their own time.
---
Yeah but there's nuance in who cast the first stone.

Due to snowball effect, I believe the big ones will continue to grow

Higher ilvl does not mean better gear in classic though
---
Two rogues, warlock&amp;mage, warlock&amp;shadow priest, warrior/disc or shadow priest, if we're speaking synergy.
---
It was a united front with norwegians, danes, swedes and fins and then it split up with the launch of gehennas. Doesn't make sense to rebrand just because some of the danes and norwegians don't wanna hang out anymore. It still seems to be the biggest nordic coalition that is open and calling it swedish would piss off the ones who aren't swedish.
---
&gt;I plan to rush Bonebiter over Whirlwind Axe too.
---
Hahaha.. That's my strategy on pservers :P I like desolace a lot as a zone and I usually spend a lot of time in SM so it is just natural for me to pick it up. On classic launch I will try a dungeon grind 5-man melee cleave group and those are centered around warriors with ravager to cleave big pulls as much as possible :P

LF NOLIFER Shaman for Dungeon Cleaving.

We are going 36h on release and 17/7 first week everyday

We are members of  \[Legends\] Horde Hardcore guild rolling on firemaw and we are looking for an Enha Shammy to put in group 1 for dungeon cleaving, our shaman couldn't handle our schedule on release so we need to find a new one.  There is also the chance to join our guild and to be in the main raiding roster if u are skilled enough, prove yourself and join us!    
---
We are international guild with very skilled players knowing all aspects of vanilla, we are aiming to have a full raiding roster around the 10 days mark.  
---
Ps: Our schedule it's really hard to stustai , we are going to rush liv 12 and start cleaving for the first 36h , after that we scheduled a 17/7 plan for the rest of the week.

6 hours 9 minutes would be nicer

Yep definitely agree.  You can also spend that gold on gear upgrades which will definitely decrease your leveling time a lot more than the ranks of demo shout if you're into minimizing your time as much as possible.
---
Fake news, clown even deleted all his shit regarding classic stuff. Either hes a weak viking or just simply a poor liar who struggles with reality. LULW
---
Can you speak to that a little bit? What's wrong with it?
---
Neither  skill has any recipes with Cooldowns, Like Mooncloth, or Transmute arcanite, so isn't much need to have more than one character with the skill.  Some of the Cooking Recipes are BoP, but I can't think of any actual food that is BoP so in theory, you could just buy anything that cooking makes and skip the skills altogether.
---
For Cooking you really only need one character with this skill, (rogue maybe because of thistle tea, if you have one) otherwise your main would be the best choice since they have access to more recipes.
---
Fishing, really only need one character with this skill,  Shamans (water walking), Priest (levitate) are probably the best fisherman for access to hard to reach pools, but any class will do just fine.   I myself Max this skill on every character, for no reason other than I want to,
---
Not before stealing all his gold lol
---
Man, these oddly specific details are getting out of hand
---
I mean, let's be real. It was a really nice belt.
---
If you know you are going to die you can unequip weapon through a macro (idk what it is) and it won't lose dura unless you spirit res. (weapon because it is most expensive to repair)
---
And it's a 100% chance to get it in the run right after you swear "OK this run is the last one", so you gotta keep trying.
---
Oh okay, so you know what im talking about then :) I dont read discord so I cant agree, but those chats are generally shitstorm. My opinon is based clearly from ingame experience
---
i didnt say that i didnt want to play on pvp, im saying that people that are going around killing the npc's just to ruin others leveling are jerks. instead of leveling on their own, they choose to go out and ruin the day for everyone else for their own delight
---
You not like memes Edgelord?
---
You just have to change the server/character name for the add ons profile in your wtf file on launch. I too set up add-ons before on the stress test and since I'm on stalagg with the same character name as I had then it won't need changing.
---
sorry to disappoint you
---
Druid/Warrior can work as well at least because Druid can get out of a lot of CC using shapeshifting and has more speed to get away.  Paladin with cleans, BoF, etc can keep the warrior on full attack and has the plate to stand back and heal/take hits.
---
If they ever added anything lorewise it would be side things.  They aren't going to trample on the lore they've made for 15 years.  Do you really expect the current leaders of WoW and Blizzard to write anything better?
---
Nice wow beta eBay there.
---
I never liked arenas, I think that's why when TBC came out I gravitated towards Lineage 2 which had competitive open world PvP. Not in the sense of fairness, but competitive that you were fighting over important things in the world like raid bosses and even just questing or material farming spots. Gave an unmatched feeling when the fight was over something not imaginary like rankings or points.
---
Hey WyriMaps guy here, Love the attention it got. The map is from WotLK so there are some differences from Vanilla so when I get the chance I'll put a Vanilla map up. (That's a when I can get my hands on it.)
---
hey! im a huge fan of your mage doc! awesome work there!
---
hope you dont mind that i used your video to make a point :).
---
Do you have a similar image for Shaman?
---
Considering peoplel will not want to log out queues could be 6+ hours
---
I just like to be able to spam a few more buttons keep the dungeons easygoing, never really had a prob doing this, I usually stop at the stun, which I really like for warrior lvling on a pvp server
---
I don't see why you wouldn't, I will be using english when communicating and am not sure if I even want to roll with a guild that speaks Swedish in chat.
---
Saved, thanks for this! As a Druid ima need one for TB also :)
---
The bis boots are Chromatic Boots which are pink... It sort of matches the aesthetic
---
Right ! Don’t worry too much about it you’ll look at the back of the head 99% of the time 😅
---
Absolutely, since Forsaken can’t be paladins I was all aboard the Blood Elf train. They were also pretty awesome in TFT
---
Personal take: I will go for any leather gear with this priority:
---
*Hit chance (upto 8%) 
---
*crit chance (hit chance+30%) 
---
*hit chance (above 8% to raise crit cap)
---
*attack power (if twice the value of agility or more)
---
*agility
---
*attack power (if greater than stength but lower than twice agility)
---
*strength
---
(Feel free to make suggestions)
---
Not going to sweat beyond hit cap and doing as much pve as I can get into. Desperately farming last boss in brd sounds like a nightmare to me.
---
These are classic dude
---
i think they look badass
---
Oh no not at all! :P Thank you!
---
Yeah, I was guessing as much, though I hopped over to Gehennas and it isn’t ’Full’ yet, but probably will become full at release.
---
Good lord man, maybe you shouldn't this time.
---
Fine. Sausage, green peppers, onions. Scientifically proven to be the best pizza toppings.
---
I never understood the thought process behind comments like this.
---
I don't think it would ever happen. Jagex is not exactly the most professional company. They can get away with stuff like this because it's literally better than having Jagex run the game. 
---
Blizzard is very professional. They need the final say on any and all decisions.
---
I think most people will remember (or will be reminded on social media) that certain updates like flying had more cons than pros. Even if only 26% of people realize it's not a good idea and vote no, it won't be added to the game.
---
Jack Black's a hooker?
---
Link isnt working for me :( invalid invite
---
Great work! Too bad a few things are still missing and it's not higher res.
---
Can't wait to lose my way in the old version of Orgrimmar xd
---
Y’all need to think about this.
---
They set the release date and time as 3 pm PDt and then converted that time for the rest of the world.
---
They are in a PDT zone and their release times are always based on that.
---
Please get some help.
---
It’s filthy Frank motherfucker
---
maybe its Maybelline hahah if I cared about reddit enough I would give you an award but I don't. 
---
made me lol tho ty dude
---
I want this too. I don’t want to run out of content and want there to always be new things coming out for the world, but I’m done with level cap increases. 60 or bust. I’m older now and my play time is a lot more sparse than it was in Vanilla. That means my time is more valuable and I’d like to feel that my time at least will not be invalidated at some point (lol it’s vidya). So if I dump 1,000 hours into a character at level 60, I don’t want an expansion to go live with a level cap increase allowing a fresh character to surge past my character in a mere 100 hours just because of a level increase invalidating all prior effort. I could piss that away in the past and not worry, but it would be too painful now to devote that time and then it literally evaporate. I know...it’s an mmo, but the idea of a forever 60 server actually makes me want to invest time into it. The specter of TBC on the horizon would make me invest far less. And that’s not crazy. Just think back to Naxx prior to 2.0 TBC. Lots of guilds called it quits knowing that all the headbanging against Naxx was going to be invalidated in a few months. So they didn’t bother. That’s one major draw now where people want to go back and actually do that content. Well, we should be starting this out that 60 is forever the cap and no huge effort of valuable time will be so casually and thoughtlessly destroyed by a level cap increase.
---
could you link a decent guide/ cheat sheet?
---
I wonder if he'll raid.
---
I have a feeling plenty of raiders in the US are gonna listen for his voice in voice chat.
---
Thanks for the correction.
---
I know for sure, Enchanting and tailoring required level 5.
---
How about using the game... /2 /4
---
500 bones.. jesus christ.
---
I am going to have a hard time making it to our traditional opening day dove hunt.
---
I remember when classic first came out, my friend got lost in UC for an hour and a half. I had to come all the way from the Barrens to come get him...
---
No it doesn't. This sheet is mostly bullshit.
---
Or just for MMOs ingeneral. Archeage comes to mind
---
It's Filthy Frank Biiiitch
---
I'm too excited for this game to release.
---
I think fins just like us swedes prefer speaking english in order to allow for more international members, surely there will be exceptions but I would not stick with a guild that speaks swedish mainly.
---
where do you get your informations about the old gods strength? Is there a book I didn't read yet? a official wiki i don't know? I'm curious.
---
Yes, to all of the above.
---
Ahhh ok. Thank you!
---
Lord of rings memes. I remember them being really popular back in Vanilla before "memes" were a thing (at least memes in the modern day).
---
Very well done! I'm rolling sham too, mind if I ...borrow this...?
---
It was quite easy healing as ret during leveling as long as you kept a healing set on private servers, did everything up to and including brd without issue. Should be even easier on classic since dungeons are gimped compared to pservers
---
Orc, no contest
---
Goodbye.
---
Hmm, maybe crafting requires 5 while gathering has no requirement.
---
Yep engineering fills in many of the holes in a paladin kit.
---
Haha all good correction is always welcome ;) always happy to improve my english:) 
---
Lose if you lost something - and a screw is loose right? Or is there just no double O lose?
---
Because we think we do but we don't.
---
From a mage in vanilla think of it as... or how I learned to love my frost bolt!
---
Ahhh, it took all night, but now I’m 10th in queue for Herod!
---
Ahh, 5 minutes later I’m LOGGING IN!!!
---
System: 5 minutes until server restart. 
---
Noooooooo!!!!!
---
The idea is a lot will leave so the queues should ideally be manageable
---
I’m really late, but the Ironforge wallpaper is sick. Would you mind sharing a link of some sorts?
---
my poor, shoddily layed out tree city
---
I haven’t played WoW in years and I joined during WotLK. I consider myself a new player to classic and I’m super excited!
---
Those names suck too, lol.
---
I'm not one to tell anyone what to do, but I would say to maybe stay away from Retail if you haven't played it in a long time and are hyped for Classic. They are very different games/experiences, and the inevitable comparisons will come up when you start playing Classic, some good, some bad. It's a headache I myself would rather skip.
---
Lol I've never heard of bogbutt but I'm using that in my future.
---
Looks sick dude
---
You’ve clearly never played OSRS.
---
[Corrupted Ashbringer](https://classicdb.ch/?item=22691)
---
When you equip it:
---
Your character will turn a little darker.
---
You will gain the [Ashbringer](https://classicdb.ch/?spell=28282) buff. Which makes you hear [whispers (real sound) from the sword](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNdl7K0EIm0).
---
You will become Friendly with the Scarlet Crusade.
---
And when you walk into the Scarlet Monastery dungeon you will get [a special event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3E6W6-rRGA).
---
0.02% of the time, it works every time.
---
Whats actually gonna cause server population issues is Actilizzard releasing 5 servers for the entirety of the EU. You blaming the hard working proletariat for merely going where the sheppard leads us!?
---
Doesn’t feel much different, I’ve always had a small unit
---
Increased the drop chance in tbc afaik
---
but you know people will yell at him for Man of steel's direction of superman
---
im scared of ending up on dead server, i now that its stupid of me to think that those servers will be dead but tell that to my brain he is the one that is scared
---
Q is it better to be ally or horde as a dagger rogue?
---
Yea even as druid main I would agree
---
Don’t just trust this guys advice because he took the time to make pretty cheat sheets. This rogue one is pretty bad so I’m assuming the other might have a lot of errors as well.
---
Thats me... and to see the other side since all my chars are alliance on retail... and shamans. Mostly the shitposting in barrens chat though
---
Haha, good one!
---
For real tho icyveins and wowhead have the lists.
---
Warrior is just a machine with the paladin utility.
---
In addition, if you aren't 60 after two years, nothing that is being voted on will affect you in the least bit. All votes that pertain to altering the leveling experience will be no-voted by a large majority of people.
---
Dutchies are everywhere.
---
Even when you go on holiday to the most shithole country you will find Piet and Gerda with his 2 kids wandering around.
---
Gamon needs a special Icon
---
This sounds like a god damn super hero plot. "I never wanted this power" to continue this comparison: As Spiderman said, with great power, comes great responsibility.
---
Based Fairbanks
---
Only if level 50 and up are allowed to vote for it.
---
Because I can see how Russian Bots would try to bamboozle us.
---
If you are going for pvp ranks you have to grind, weekly, a massive amount of honor.
---
The luxury of going at your own pace isn't there when you are competing with other players.
---
I don't believe you. There is no way. When you first boot up the game, your character is in 3rd person. Every time you create a new character, it is in 3rd person. You only have to accidentially slip a finger over your mouse scroll wheel and bam, 3rd person. There is no way the dude never realized the game had 3rd peson view in it after months of playing.
---
LOL! Underrated asf
---
Know them feels brah, know them oh too well. If you want shaz id reccomend trying your name again tonight for a while while Firemaw drops, you never know someone might crack under the pressure!!
---
Apply poisons - Yes
---
Swap equip - Yes
---
Bandage - No
---
Eat - Yes
---
Honestly though. People used to try to find out the droprate is items and then just tell you what it was. Now we have a post for ever rare item in the game telling you that you don’t want it.
---
“You don’t want to play world of Warcraft! It takes forever!”
---
That run to Valley of Honor as lvl &lt; 40 with no mount just to smelt some copper...pain.
---
Also don't stand directly in front. (Or behind if it's a dragon)
---
You're correct, loose means that something isn't fastened properly or that something that was restrained (tied down) has escaped:
---
"THE MOOSE IS LOOSE!"
---
I'm on golemagg. Not sure if golemagg is earmarked for British players though
---
Preach brother!
---
Yup i got burned in Cata, took a few days off and i think in 48 hours i managed to get just 8 hours in.
---
I'm interested but the discord link is invalid
---
I understand your POV. You just expect the opposing faction player to be kind to you, have the same moral guidelines like you and abstain from doing something they can or want to. 
---
This is something you ***cannot*** expect in a competitive PVP game.
---
Nobody likes griefers, those nasty corpse-campers. I am not one of them. But if I roam an area, and I come across a player, depending on the circumstances, I'll probably try to gank him, and that's it. If they don't like it, it's their problem. The game allows me to do that, so if you have an issue with that, hate the game, not the player.
---
I've also had interactions with the other faction like that as well, helped lowbies kill elites and so on.
---
You can definitely swap equipment.  
---
You can eat, then go stealth, but not the reverse.  
---
Bandaging brings you out of stealth.  
---
In patch 1.10, applying poisons no longer broke stealth, so I think you're safe since we should essentially be on patch 1.12.  
---
Drinking a potion breaks stealth.  
---
For the most part you can do a lot of things, THEN stealth, but not stealth then do a lot of things.
---
Most swedes (me included) are sticking to Gehennas.
---
Same here. All the people I know who are gonna play Classic are waiting for the launch day to sub, including myself. Get ready for a server choke boiiiiz
---
As long as there is one version, the community won't be "split"
---
Offering TBC and Classic together would literally split the playerbase and ruin both versions.
---
Classic+ is the only way to go imo. Recycling like Private Servers after Naxx will kill off all but the most hardcore, and doing nothing will kill off everyone. Progressing through expansions will kill off everyone starting around ToC at the latest, and then we have bad expansions to relive. It just isn't feasible to expect that to work.
---
LFG and LFR are still in modern WoW and they are subscribed to it. They can go play that. That's what it's there for.
---
Looks like a hunter pre raid bis list to me : )
---
Here's all of 'em man:

As the top comment points out, shamans do okay, they don't wear any awful blue dresses.
---
Defias.
---
Anyone know why i get an error message that says "Max number of characters for this account has been reached..." I literally have 3 characters total lol. like wut?

Absolutely. Turn off messages.

Horrible font and color selection... damn

The riding trainer on the stress test offered to teach Horse Riding, not Apprentice Riding. Is that an error or does it convert automatically to Apprentice Riding after you learn it?
---
They already released 2 new est realms which puts it at 5. This is a week out from launch, I think that this new one will fill by launch as well and they will release another 2 for launch for est. Other servers will follow similarly when theirs over fill as well. A large chunk of the potential playerbase do not care about names and will only buy time on the day prior to launch/launch. They are in for a flux of people on top of what we have currently.
---
All the weapons
---
The guy who posted this probably thinks he’s such a big brain genius and when he wastes all the time crafting these just gets sheeped and dies lollll.
---
If that's how you imagined it ok, I guess.  
---
But most raid quests tell you to collect "your friends" to face the threat
---
They are super rare dude
---
Bandage, no.
---
Equipment, yes.
---
Poisons, I can't remember. I think they've changed it over the years.
---
As for abilities, Virtually any offensive ability will break stealth. Defensive abilities like distract and sprint won't. I believe talented "buffs" like cold blood and premed will not. Sap can be talented to reduce the chance to break steal to 10% I believe.
---
I stopped at the end of Cata, but warrior was always a viable main tank and always viable in pvp.
---
It’s amazing on hunter.
---
Certain things you can, it depends what. You cant bandage in stealth for example, and if you were to begin eating in stealth it would cancel stealth, however you could click to eat then stealth and you would be eating in stealth. It interacts differently depending how you utilize it. Just mess around with the abilities with stealth interaction and you'll figure it out quickly.
---
Man I've been playing too much BotW lately. I thought it was the sheikah eye at first...
---
Oof
---
I wish I could say I had seen anything in the UK resembling classic adverts.. unless I've missed anything?
---
Orc. The stun resist is OP and will of the forsaken is less essential since your dot and pet damage will still hit the enemy when feared.
---
I’m a new player, never played Classic back in the day. I played for a short while when WotLK came out and then fell out of it. I tried to play Cata and fell out of it again. Pretty much the same result with all of the other expansions as well. I haven’t tried BFA at all, but I definitely plan on playing Classic for quite a while.
---
For some reason I thought it was this Friday. I was so sure and so close.
---
It's quite simple, I did it the other way around for the beta. Just make a starter account and sub for it and it's done
---
It was superman role
---
Did they bring back the limit for Classic?
---
Orc.  If you compare the classes that fear vs the number of classes that can stun, you are far more likely to be stunned then feared.
---
That’s the way I look at it.
---
As someone who always played Alliance but was forced to change faction by friends, I thank you. (Also I apologize to my Alliance friends whom I've now betrayed).
---
Swedes are on gehennas.
---
You know Jeff Kaplan was one of the main minds behind classic right? The team was the same all through tbc and then they later went on to do Titan which became overwatch.
---
Smaller than any other class? Holy priest has nearly the exact same spec for pvp and pve.
---
Fuck all that, raiding for 4-5 hours in 2019 LUL
---
I think the fastest way to level will be to follow Joana's guide with a partner. With the right group and enough AoE dps, it may be marginally faster to grind, but you're going to be missing incremental upgrades gained from quests, and it probably won't be a fun experience. 
---
Joana has spent many years optimizing the fastest way to level, I'd like to believe that if it was faster to grind, that's what he would do. He has mentioned however, that dungeon grinding may be faster, but with the caveat that you need the right group.
---
That might have been the case in actual vanilla but pretty much every survey or poll I've seen leading up to classic shows thats not going to be the case.
---
Only one per week per faction.
---
Hour long queues? Those are rookie numbers, you gotta pump those up!
---
Yeah launch will be messy. I'm happy on stalagg though, will be a good server!
---
Becoming immortal.
---
That which has no life, can not be killed.
---
Honestly the people looking to have stuff handed to them won't last in Classic. I'm not worried about them being around if something like community polls came out to vote on Classic+ content at some point after phase 6. I just don't think a CTRL+C CTRL+V of TBC after Naxx is the right move. Personally I think it'd be sick to see TBC content and onward reworked to be Vanilla endgame content. Idk what features I'd pick and choose (flying mounts, LFG, w/e else) but seeing that content reimagined would be pretty cool imo. But that's why we should put it to a community vote. Let us help guide things after Phase 6!
---
Who is APES and why should I not go to Firemaw?
---
TBC didn’t have dungeon finder
---
For your next playthrough a PSA: 
---
both the silithid pox casters and the black tar monsters' cast can be outranged, but *not* interrupted. If you see their pincers/hands start glowing, step back 2 steps and the cast does not go through. :)
---
Recommended settings have always been sponsored by GPU companies, it will run very well on your laptop with some settings turned down slightly, but imo you basically only need a decent AA to make classic look good.
---
Just started working from home a couple of weeks ago. I’m making sure to finish up for this client by Monday, so I can push back a couple of weeks on my next client. 
---
“I’ve got a major project going on right now - I can get cracking on yours in approximately two weeks. Thanks for your patience.”
---
No one cares.
---
Butt. Its but but with two t's making it a butt
---
And don't be surprised at 10 hour queues.
---
They can do it like ffxiv does it. Introduce harder modes of dungeons in the story. Like after clearing it and it being abandoned, some other forces moved in and took over the area leading to another threat.
---
Their Hard modes also change the entire or close to the entire lay-out, keeping it fresh while maintaining the design.
---
Oh man I remember the Pally and Warlock epic mount quests.  That was some top tier class flavor blizzard only remade like once, with the green fire quest.
---
What a shitty cheat
---
i would always meme about this in my guild, but i was always met with "what are you talking about?" and a lot of "huhs?" in my gchat or discord.
---
i have finally found other people who get this joke. i have found home.
---
Nice  
---
p.s. my first comment on reddit, nice
---
Hehe this kinda hits home. Just last night I was thinking about Classic and how it really is somewhat one of the closest things humanity will have to time travel (for now, I guess?).
---
A virtual world, and we're going to travel back to the beginning of its existence. Something else this MMO now does, that just not possible in real life.
---
Weird, it’s almost like people are hearing they’re claiming every realm so that no one actually knows
---

Oh no way. Isn't in thunder bluff area? I thought it was an OG quest. I started right as WOTLK came out.
---
Yep same, People seem to forget blizz we're actually pretty sweet back in the day and compensated extra game time if there was more than 2-3 hours with extended downtime.
---
Reapers of Souls, D3 expansion, was massive aswell and the RMAH was removed way before. RMAH =/= microtransactions.
---
Ehh, there are 676 2-char and 17576 3-char possible combinations.  If a full server is 20k, then all 2-char names account for a bit over 3% of all characters, and you could have an entire server of 3-char names.  The "rarity" doesn't seem worth it for an otherwise terrible name.
---
Private servers are the reasom we have classic
---
Do you think this will end up causing a lot of arguments with druids and clothies then?
---
I think memories are a bit off. 
---
As i recall, and I played a holy priest so farming was a royal pain, I was spending 3-4 hours a week farming in order to pay for my consumable use in AQ/Naxx several nights/week.
---
I was forever poor because I was sinking all that gold into pots, but considering I was playing 30+ hours a week at that point, 3-4 hours farming isn't a lot either.
---
I personally like YouTube because you can usually get an explanation for most choices. I think Kargoz actually did a rogue deep dive with 3 rogues yesterday. Also tipsout has one with LMGD. Both I found useful.
---
So with queues being 12000+ and the players online + people who have not yet started. You are still saying your 1370 will be the majority?
---
Iron grenades cost next to nothing. I could not disagree more. And you are completely ignoring all the trinkets and other consumables.
---
Frankly I am curious where you got this ridiculous notion from.
---
Priest has always been solid for the most part
---
What're you, 12?
---
Wailing caverns is a fucking nightmare even with a tracking map 
---
Good thing I’m hunter I just follow the tank
---
Blocked.
---
Which is irrelevant.
---
wait, roman aristocrats had harems?
---
Totem drawings 👌
---
The people doing polls are the same people who are more likely to reserve their name. Out of the 15~ people I know that are going to play only 5 have reserved names.
---
Where did they say this?
---
The answer was inarguably wrong, though.
---
More fool you for believing them
---
Whos lights..
---
getting into hard drugs for the true grind experience?
---
It's only a guess but as someone that enjoys them for comp games, I think they would be great for farming also.
---
I'd like it. I feel like a lot of the things classic is going to do it does because of a certain quite vocal minority.
---
Amazing, a legit video from 2004. Those are rare, thank you!

You should definitely update to something that only works for 7, those Elves a-hopping could work for any number.
---
Tip for tomorrow if you didn't alreaddy think of it, 8 playable classes!
---
&gt; This was....not a thing in vanilla...was it?
---
Neither was the food table.
---
That's definitely where the dance party is
---
I think the Classic playerbase is split on it, or at least has diverse opinions. I'm part of the playerbase - I'm SUPER excited for classic. I played Vanilla, but never quite progressed in it as far as TBC and Wrath. I guess I kinda want them both for different reasons.
---
For those of you who never got to use it it was just a basic drop down optioned class/tier set viewer. I may be recalling incorrectly but i believe mousing over the items gave the names/stats. Either way I TRULY miss this and the old Armory style... oh yeah and the armory app.... damn.....
---
Im going herb/enchanting  
---
make an alt to level alch if really needed (only require level 35) but i assume ill have at least a few people in guild who can make me flasks/potions with my mats for free and even offer same service from my enchanting in return.
---
perfect combo really for not having to buy any consumables and make gold if needed.
---
Got to test a friends account during closed beta and ordered it, first time playing on my own account was during the EU final beta. It was my first real MMORPG, had only played Tibia before
---
I have GrandAdmiralDouchnozzle and XxDemonN00bslayer420BlazeItxX available for trade, but gonna have to stick with those names over Maydie
---
If the game is good, they will come. I have no worries. It's not like vanilla wow was dead at all before tbc
---
My guess is that they might fuse servers if they have too few population
---
Sure, if nobody notices.
---
Not gonna lie that would be the best thing for me. I cant be there at launch cause I have a final to go to at 9am
---
2 Weeks off work starting next monday, i´m ready at midnight :D
---
They want that world to survive as it was. If  you want the updates, retail wow has that. 
---
Classic should remain as is. They could do things like setup a resetting server or servers that have a 12 month lifespan. Launch and let it run for 12 months then reset it and start again. People could experience that new realm feeling every year.
---
I have the \_classic\_beta\_ folder and put the Sandbox Downloader file in the wow folder (where world of warcraft launcher.exe is located). However when I run the downloader and click Classic, nothing happens. It just says ready without actually downloading anything. 
---
Anyone know what I am doing wrong?
---
What other poll?
---
Ehhh the UI was released back in classic already, lots of people used it in Naxx. Atleast a ton of my guildies did back then.
---
HAHAHA! I actually had no idea ferals could get such high armour! That actually makes me want to play one of them. I believe I have updated it now to the maximum armour you can think to achieve in Classic.
---

Horde are low key the good guys in Warcraft. Fk the Alliance! Slaving scum!

[Michio Kaku on education in the US](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W54GLw0rtZE)
---
Start watching around the 2:00 mark. You're not the leading economy because of your education system but because of the influx of foreigners.
---
But hey, this is reddit and I'm putting up a youtube video as an argument. Take things a little less seriously, would you?
---
You can but you'll have to be popping mana pots and other consumables quite a bit.
---
Just don't tell your class leader ;)
---
From what I understood, you start using the Succubus and drain tank at about level 24 when you have Fel Concentration maxed to make it so that your Drain Life isn't interrupted constantly. Respeccing later works too, Dive's guide has a version where you spec Improved Imp right away and respec to full affliction later.
---
Her uniboob needs some attention too.
---
No because CATA was a dogshit expansion before people knew that was possible - so even though it’s considered one of the worst, it still gets carried by being on the tail end of Wrath.
---
Maybe 3-5% of people would want CATA and they either were CATA babies or don’t know better.
---
I like that there is areas in classic that are just open. No quest, few npcs, just open land. Really makes the game feel bigger. In retail every area has some specific purpose or quest line
---
Yeah no doubt. The idea of spending my adult years raiding in classic wow sounds like legit torture. Maybe when I had no responsibilities and no life, sure. But as an adult? Big yikes. Not sure how I could justify it to friends/family/myself wasting so much time doing this shit all again. PvP and dicking around, sure. But hardcore raiding? Nah brah.
---
With those that have no idea what they are talking about, maybe. In raids it shouldn't be an issue, in random groups however ... well.
---
You can get away with it in 5mans. You will run oom so fast as shadow though you might as well dps to try to speed the kill up.
---
You're very wrong.  
---
Mage/Mage:  Blessing of sacrafice the sheep on the paladin, cleanse everything on the warrior, the warrior face rolls both mage clothies.  If things get hairy, paladin bubbles.  There's literally nothing a mage can do that a paladin can't cleanse, and a warrior with freedom can kill a mage in the span of one bubble. 
---
Mage/Rogue:  Same deal.  Warrior could kill either within the time frame of a single bubble, especially if the rogue decides to evasion.  Holy overpower.  
---
Rogue/Warlock:  Again, no.  Paladin can cleanse everything the warlock can throw as well, and fear is an even more unreliable CC than sheep.  Warrior is unfearable even if the Paladin gets caught.  Warrior eats both for breakfast.
---
Mage/Warlock:  Now you're talking.  This combo stands the best chance but still very unlikely.  
---
Holy Paladin/Warrior is the best world pvp combo, followed closely by Resto Shaman/Warrior.
---
Not well
---
huehuehuehuehue
---
Well part of pre-raid BiS is you typically only raid 1-2 nights a week; especially early on when only MC and Ony is out. Also gearing is pretty slow even for guilds full clearing MC. So what do you do rest of week? This gives you some goals to fill in gaps until you get full Tier 1 or both MC swords etc. I do think it’s a big misconception that you need full pre-raid BiS to just step foot in raids.
---
Which class has the easiest job to obtain the minimum gear for raids?
---
Get out of this thread!
---
This man bubbles
---
well u chose alliance what are u triyng to expect?
---
I was a shaman in Vanilla.  I'm going Paladin for a similar, yet completely different experience that I've never had before.  I'm incredibly excited.
---
Oh, and I will 100% play a shaman at some point as well, for the nostalgia.
---
hahahahah
---
Okay, this [Obama version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu0PXtUfJ-Q) is next level.
---
Every pvp server has a slight/moderate Horde majority. All the less dedicated players are coming in on release date though, which is probably the overall majority. And the masses have often given Alliance the upper hand in sheer numbers.
---
But we'll see. I think its gonna be pretty balanced in the end.
---
Нице
---
Ya these are good additions.
---
Break\*. You horde filth can't even spell properly
---
Awesome
---
Thank you, after watching this episode last night I spent about 2 hours making it. I’m just glad I was able to make some people smile this morning!
---
One of the very first posts was a straw poll.  I went back to it a few days ago to review results but haven’t looked at it in the last few days.
---
I'm just worried that most of them will be casual and not very good at the game or not very interested in high end serious raiding. Based on the discord numbers the vast majority of hardcore players playing on PvE servers went to Pagle.
---
anything you can share about future plans/content for classic after phase 6?
---
If its a good guild they'll notice quite fast, and its not very optimal.
---
What are the plans after Phase 6? More content for classic or moving to TBC?
---
Give a shit
---
Thank you so much! :)
---
Well, for what it's worth, depebdibg on your choice of pet it's cheap access to food to keep Happiness up.
---
Lol yeah his gold assumptions are super low. Ever heard of rogue pick pocketing runs? Or mara farms?
---
Apes and spaniards and going? Stay far far away from this realm.
---
Hey team! Thanks for being part of bringing Classic WoW back to us. Additionally thanks to r/ClassicWoW team for hosting.
---
Question: What are plans for phase 2 if some realms are horrifically overpopulated at 50K+ players? Will layering stay?
---
We have many large scale RP events we want to coordinate but layering is preventing us from doing this without tremendous headache,  but massive overpopulation would also be a bad situation.
---
Thanks again!
---
I'd still roll Horde. I dont enjoy the Alliance aesthetic at all. I need Orgrimmar in my WoW life.
---
Will you offer free realm transfers is servers get way overpopulated after launch?
---
Will Mankrik's wife be moved to recreate an authentic Vanilla experience?
---
Group of atleast 20 Dutchies golemagg here too. And recruiting :)
---
I had the armour drop loads of times, 2005/6 vanilla rogue. 
---
Too much +hit on this bis set for human combat builds
---
i love people who talk with so much conviction but dont know what they are saying.. its cute
---
Pretty sure if you'd gone for something a tiny bit more generic like Frodo you would be singing a different song.
---
&gt; My body is ready. 
---
So you’re already 350 lbs?
---
What exactly are the pop caps for a layer? And extrapolating from that, what are the server pop thresholds roughly indicating (what makes a server low vs medium vs high?)
---
strength, Blood and THUNDER
---
I have no intention of deleting KnifeySpoony. I do plan on finding my friends in westfall and giving them the old undead hello
---
My guild used to call her "Lady Blammo"
---
We were wrong but its EASY
---
Most PvP Server will have horde majority. This will be an advantage in world PvP but will be insanely annoying once BG queues are added. (Alliance insta queus and Horde most likely 30+ minute queue time)
---
Have the devs given any thought to the idea of community-polled updates similar to  how Oldschool Runescape?
---
You got this! If you do end up making something be sure to share it so we can all see!
---
Upvoting for priority
---
What are people expecting, realistically? I'll only start playing Tuesday evening (EU) due to work. Hoping it might stabilize by then, with new servers added, people migrating because of huge queues, etc
---
Shazzrah and Golemagg are Full. Gehennas is High. Firemaw isn't open yet.
---
Which of you guys will reach level 60 first?
---
Brother came home from leave in the army around Thanksgiving one year, I had been playing guild wars 1 for months , he was also a big gamer and he wanted to show me this new "Warcraft" mmo, I had no idea they even made one, I was 11 years old the time so I didn't know shit. I immediately got hooked as soon as I saw the login screen and heard that music, and saw the opening cinematic. I was instantly addicted. First character ever was a dwarf hunter, as my brother didn't let me play the game at all while he was visiting I just had to watch and countdown the days till he was gone so that I could finally play. I then bounced around character to character for a while. my max character was my brothers which was only level 25. I slowly would jump onto that character it was a Night elf hunter, I loved Nelfs. So I ended up meeting my first WoW friend named Warriorlord who was a dwarf warrior who asked me to level with him, so it was from there I decided to actually stick to a character and level it to cap. STV and the Hinterlands were a blast having a friend there, and  then we also got to Tanaris together as well. Banged out 40-49 and went to Un'goro crater to try and finish off our grind to 60. I believe it wasn't until we got to the blasted lands until we hit the level cap. But it was a fkn blast. Especially being 11/12 years old at the time. Can't wait to play the game as an adult now, I want to do nothing but play the shit out of it all over again. I played the beta a couple weeks ago and was Immediately hooked again like I was all those years ago.
---
Shamans too
---
What is the player cap for layers in phase one, and servers after layering? Will it be the vanilla cap, or the current cap?
---
Louvered?
---
Actually, I used an app on my phone called “Enlight,” really awesome on-the-go editing app, I recommend it!
---
What all classes do you all plan on playing, and do you all raid together or do you do your own thing?
---
Thanks so much for making Classic WoW possible btw.  Haven't been this excited in a game in years.
---

---
What were the main factors that led to RP-PvP being added to the server lists ?
---
Oh me, too, make no mistake! I agree everyone will be split on it and want both, but realistically we'll only get one.
---
you don't need professions, have the guild enchanter DE for you.  when the game crashes and you are waiting for your group buddy to log in play the alt.  There is no reason to start leveling a bank alt.  What you are saying you want to DE stuff to make +5 bracer health?  What does that give you?  5 health?  Why is that your concern?
---
Is anything we don't know of going to fundamentally change from the way it was originally?
---
What will you do if all of the realms are capped out at launch day with massive queues? Will you continually put up realms until the demand is met?
---
If classic is a Success (I don't understand why anyone will want to once again relive their past. Groundhog day anyone?) It will be a big I dictator that people want THAT gameplay back. Why anyone would not choose to go down another parallel path using the same fantasy, immersion and rpg elements that make classic what it is is beyond me. Stop playing repeat and use Classic as what it is, the chance to play the game we originally loved with an opportunity to expand on it learning from past mistakes.
---
I think it would be great, so they would not fuck up.
---
I always wondered is there a BiS list for pvp?
---
ECIN
---
Cause:
---
1) they can. Why would they make it the same price? Classic won't have much dlc so this is one of their best ways to make extra dough. 
---
2) to limit transfers for a more authentic experience. If people can switch every week, it will be strange. They will likely also limit the number of transfers per account per realm etc more than retail.
---
That's like 5% of the server if everyone moves tho.
---
Herod and Shazzrah have been specifically named as having extremely long queue lengths (over 10,000). However, the issue my group is facing is that the length of players in queue tells us little about the expected wait time. With new layering technology, name reservations having people logged in for brief periods of time, and many thousands of people in the stress test, people in my group are unconcerned about queues.  Many think it will be like the name reservations or stress test, where there will be a long queue, but it will move quickly. Some liken it to old times when an over 1k queue was normal on some realms, and expect hours and hours of queue time with a 10k queue. I know my group would likely consider rerolling if we were expecting 4 hour+ queues for an extended period of time, but as a whole they seem to think we'll have sub 1 hour queues. As the general public isn't familiar with the layering technology, people are just wildly speculating what queue times will be.
---
On the Herod and Shazzrah servers, assuming population stays like it currently is, can you provide some rough idea of what you expect the minimum time in queue to be at launch? Can you elaborate in any way on some on the expected queue lengths (preferably in length of time) at launch?
---
they should have had a level 5 capped period where you get to have ONE character that gains exp, after one char hits level 2 you cannot gain exp on the others
---
Nobody knows, it’s unlikely that you can log in days prior and mouse over the enter world button.
---
Are you hoping to expand upon a Classic + post launch, if the player demand, still is there? I think it's one of the most requested features.
---
I'm not talking about a Burning Crusade expansion, but content added to the actual game that is new, fresh, content that is made for Classic only?
---
Yup
---
Do you have any plans to add **Guild Banks**?
---
Maintaining my own public ledger of deposits/withdrawals, and trying to depend on people NOT to ninja stuff when they want to leave guild or quit, is not adding to my sense of accomplishment and struggle, or self-worth, in classic.
---
Why are you bringing optimisation into this, it’s a completely separate matter. A game can run well despite being poorly optimised if you throw enough power at it. 
---
Running well strictly refers to rendering, irregardless of graphics settings.
---
Is dungeon experience as it is intended or bugged? People have checked and compared old videos from vanilla to the beta/classic servers and it seems you gain more exp currently in groups doing dungeons.
---
You can find these on wowhead.
---
u/ZoidWoW (or u/Ogronz and u/Pazorax), my understanding is that the 1.12.1 client wasn't used for Classic so that you could have feature/infrastructure parity with modern WoW. However, it seemed the Classic beta didn't have DX12 capabilities and didn't have the multi-threaded enhancements provided to modern WoW around patch 8.1.
---
Will we see DX12 in Classic and the multi-threaded utilization enhancements at some point? If not, is there a technical limitation?
---
Moo.
---
Will the AQ gate opening war effort mean the gates open at different times on each server, or will they all open at once?
---
How concerned are y'all about the current realm population distribution?
---
Will the Skeletons that appear when someone dies be the same as it was originally? Right now they disappear after you die again, they used to stay longer than that.
---
What is the population size difference between a full current gen server and a full server in 2004?
---
Thank you for doing this. How long will each phase last?
---
Hey Team, any thoughts on relocating Mankrik's wife for the authentic classic experience?
---
What’s the best WoW classic PvP song?
---
Great response here, Zonquist. I’ll be doing the exact same thing for my warrior. Always get points in Arms and grab overpower first -&gt; grab 5 points in cruelty after that -&gt; go back to filling in talents in the arms tree until 40 and then respec for MS -&gt; go back and finish your final points in Fury after that and then respec to whatever you want based on what you want to do end game and, of course, based on what your best weapon(s) are. 
---
This is just the most optimal way by far - no contest.

Why did you take both dagger and sword spec?
---
What classes are you guys playing? :)
---
Do you have plans to balance the game in ways not seen in vanilla?  Mainly, making various specs more viable for endgame raiding (Moonkin, Retribution, ect?)
---
Has nothing to do with talent, it's design philosophy of not just Blizzard, but the entire games industry changing over the years.
---
So long as they stick to vanilla design principles, which they have shown with classic that they are really trying to, any new content ought to be inline with that too.
---
In phase 2 and beyond, do you plan on having the server populations the same as 2005, or will they be increased?

---
Is there any plans to make changes to the game like Old School runescape where you still keep it to the roots but add small content updates?
---
To be honest, the blue dress is probably just as good. I *believe* it's because the other dress has MP5 which Shamans want more but I'm definitely no expert.
---
If the team does end up deciding to do TBC or WotLK content, would you add it to the classic servers, or start separate TBC/WotLK servers? If you added separate servers, would we be able to transfer our classic characters to them?
---
I wonder how long it will be before they announce they will be moving to another server once there is more added.
---
20 million player queues?
---
:'( forgive me
---
[I'd think twice before disrespecting Herod if I were you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34KmJXppJt4)

What was a change you guys contemplated implementing, but ultimately decided not to? (If there were multiple feel free to share).
---
Speak for yourself, I'd say there's more demand for BC classic than adding to classic.
---
Mors you gonna be playing hard and streaming? What are you rolling?
---
I had a text file full of “translated” lines I would use.
---
I know “P Mo fe” would translate to “U Lo se”. I also would say things like “Lo ve u no ki ll” but I lost the document when I gave up before WotLK
---
Why do the Alliance have so many more chairs than the Horde?
---
For reference, this analysis:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cpwg9b/a_thorough_analysis_of_chair_counts_in_all_major/
---
I'd like them to have this but no quality of life changes should ever happen. After naxx the only thing they should add are raids. Raids are the only thing Blizzard does ok at. Just make a new raid for us every 6 months or so. And make the gear item levels drop when outside of the new raids to prevent any pvp issues.
---
Blizzard, in your recent post you **warned** about "**severe queues** on selected realms" Could you please shed some light on the length of theses queues. Are we looking at 10 minute queues or 1 to 2 hour queues?
---
Oh for fucks sake. 
---
PvP Encounter: Frontloaded damage, over in a few rotations. You'll get zero value from AM.
---
PvE Levelling/Grinding: Same as above, zero value from the rage gen, minimal or zero value from lesser decay.
---
PvE Raiding as Fury: Zero value. You don't need more rage if you're raid buffed and geared/specced correctly.
---
PvE Raiding as Prot: Zero value. lul.
---
PvE Raiding as Arms: Minimal value. You SHOULDN'T need more rage if you're raid buffed and geared/specced correctly. However without an offhand weapon (assuming you don't have Windfury) this will give you another Heroic Strike or two over the course of an entire fight, maybe. If you have Windfury, that's a zero value again.
---
But I get it.
---
I get it.
---
I understand.
---
Some people (probably you) massively overvalue AM and see it as a talent that does a lot more than it does. Luckily, I addressed exactly this on my image... I pointed out how you can make a simple change to take it, if you want it. Why so many people seem to have gotten their panties in a twist about this just blows my mind.
---
Please speak Dutch guys. Ik moet mijn Nederlands verbeteren.
---
Hello,
---
Can you give us some statement about the duration of phases ? Is there a general static timeframe or is it depending on internal server events i.e content clearing in the phase . Best regards
---
What are some things you wish you knew before you started developing wow classic? Do you have any funny stories that happened while developing? Like bugs that you had a lot of trouble solving but the solution turned out to be really obvious? Maybe you stumbled upon the solution?
---
Thanks so much for doing this and especially thanks for developing wow classic, I personally can't wait to start playing!
---
Lol the quality of shitposts on this sub right now 😩
---
Paladin warrior with impending doom is insanely hard for double mage, if not impossible. They'd have to block warriors impending doom just to get a sheep off. Then youve got all kinds of variables happening.
---
Besides its a rock paper scizzor game. There are counters to every team. Double mage will struggle vs heavy engineering and gadget team.
---
If the warrior is good he wont let an easy SAP off. Zerker, Combat with bloodrage, doom etc.
---
Mage lock is prolly very good vs war pala.
---
Yes yes yes yes yes. This guy gets it.
---
Is mob aggro/chase mechanic functioning properly? I don't remember hearing this happening and its hard to find footage with "targets of target" enabled while running away from an enemy with multiple threat sources.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbGib2UwFTQ
---
During beta this worked the same if it was a player instead of a pet and it was not exclusive to two sources, it would cycle through all 5 (only tried in party)
---
Split-pulling as a mechanic seems to also be off based on videos, a Pets threat seems to be directly linked with the player character, not as an individual on threat if that makes sense, confirmation if this was how it works would be nice because it just feels wonky currently.
---
With regards to cross realm battlegrounds was there any discussion about wether or not to include them or only include them after a certain time? I know they were available in 1.12, but during Vanilla that patch came after a server only pvp community had already been solidly established. I was curious about if you guys were always set on sticking to 1.12 in that respect or if there was a debate about it internally. Thank you.
---
Do you think you may have underestimated the popularity of Classic, and the need for more servers?
---
I played EQ all throughout High School, and I’d always been a Blizzard fanboy. When submissions for the WoW beta went live, my guild actually took a 10 minute break so everyone could apply. There were somewhat mixed reactions, some saying it’s too casual friendly, some saying it’s Blizzard so it has to be good. When the beta started, I didn’t get an invite, but I was able to play on a friend’s account.
---
If the Classic WoW results are higher than your expectations, have you considered developping what is called (by the community at least) Classic+?
---
There's a lot of auto-attacking, yeah. It's not terribly boring, but you don't have much mana, so you can't just spam spells. Most classes are like that in vanilla, just paladin more so than others. Seal, auto attack, maybe a judgment opener, maybe a heal. Lots of drinking. I prefer paladin because of its survivability.
---
Infamous because they do PVP? Wow, such infamy.
---
Questing zones like Hinterlands and Searing Gorge got new quests after the release, during  vanilla  
---
(for example Revantusk Village quest hub for Horde in Hinterlands)
---
Will these be in at launch, or will we get them later down the line in another phase?
---
Is there any unreleased content produced during classics lifetime that you are prepared to release as part of a classic+ model, continuing classic beyond phase 6
---
Are there any plans to make more Normal type realms?
---
What is the population cap per server? And how many layers will there be on a full server?
---
Fack I just tried Mikasa. I have tsukasa and plumbus on herod
---
Do you have a rough estimation for how many total layers will be implemented for each individual server?
---
I want to test/build addons before launch! How can I do this with beta down?
---
I mean basically once a guild has a few days of dungeons drops and 35-+ 60s they should be able to do mc/ onyxia
---
pretty sure I was 20k queue with an hour wait for stress.
---
I mean come on you guys are ALL guessing.
---
People need to stop saying X wants a "WoW" Show / Movie / Series what ever, it's just Warcraft, that's the universe in which WoW derives from. So we don't want a show about WoW, people want a show about Warcraft. The semantics is a big deal in this case.
---
CHOO CHOO 🚞💨
---
I played TBC and BFA. Both feel the same.
---
Are we going to see GM's out in the world like back in the day?
---
Mage 100%. Mage has basically been the best overall class in all aspects of the game every xpac. Warrior was close, but has fallen off at some points.
---
Still trying to "trade" for it :/
---
Yeah, TBC and Wrath have fairly large and vocal fans. I'll be shocked if we don't see them.
---
Hello Thanks for doing this!
---
Have you guys talked at all about the possibility of server transfers in the future?
---
Having clarity on this point would help out my guilds current debate about what server we should play on at launch.
---
I could see two clear cases this could help based on how well classic retains players who try it out at launch:
---
- If the game does keep a decent retention. For people on extremely high population servers like Herod, if they stay on there and come phase 2 are hit with impossibly long queues, transferring off could become a good decision
---
- If the game has a lot of attrition. For people that maybe are not on the more populated servers, this gives them an option to leave a "dead" server, and join one that has a more active and involved community.
---
With no clear idea if/when this will be allowed, the above worries are pretty clear.
---
Same here.
---
\#OneChange
---
Everyone expects there to be a massive "drop off" in player count for Classic in the weeks after release.  It's my understanding that layering was introduced as a way to combat that drop off while maintaining healthy server populations.  How did you calculate the appropriate number of players or layers per server, and do you of a contingency plan if the "drop off" is either far greater or far less than you were expecting?
---
Vanilla had addons. I had like 30 addons installed by the time I hit 60
---
One of the best parts about vanilla was its UI customization, no other games really gave you so much freedom.
---
Fiddling with my UI is one of my favorite parts of wow, and while I'll be staying close to the default feel, who cares if someone wants a to use a tukui or elvui full body replacement
---
Same here, what server?
---
Exactly!
---
Chill you all... No one is neglecting their family here. I'm not canceling some family vacation. It was just a last minute hey you wanna come hang out since you have a long weekend and I'm like nah I got something planned already let's do one of my other long weekends
---
Which is once every 2 weeks since I work a 9:80 schedule
---
Hello devs of the most epic game ever made :)
---
Will UBRS be a 10 or 15 man dungeon?
---
Agreed. It takes 2 to 3 hours if you're playing normal speed to get to level 10.  It takes a half hour to go all the way to the NE area, even longer if you run on the road through loch modan.
---
What’s the top tank now, DK?
---
Estimated time: Calculating...
---
Once all the phases have been released and if classic maintains its popularity, would you be interested in doing a 'Classic+' model? (I.e, keep the gameplay the same but add dungeons/raids/Bags)
---
42
---
Probably a 3 way tie between priest mage and rogue. If I had to go with just 2 it’d be priest. At least one spec has always been viable in both pve and pvp since forever.
---
After the [deepdive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U83KVY5ikiE) with one of the best rogues out there (LMGD), the way I understood it is, if you go combat, you 100% of the time use swords. It's straight up the best PvE build for rogues. Here's an actually good leveling build by LMGD: https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/325200105-0230550100050150231 (you can go with 3 points in gouge, instead of lightning reflexes, depending on how crowded server is and if you need a good tagging skill). This spec is obviously not PvP centered, so it won't perform amazing, but fairly alright. If you know what you're doing you'll have your fun at ganking, don't worry. 
---
Daggers is only a great choice for PvP, here's his build if you really want to go with that: https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/205300105-302302002-25025300003012.
---
Guild Banks were a BC addition, so no. If they did it wouldn't be Classic.
---
What is your favorite music to listen to when playing classic WoW?
---
Can we have the original c'thun for 1 or 2 months? So only the really best guilds can manage it to beat him. And thats the way it should be i think
---
With regards to logging in on release day, could you describe the practical aspects of that. Can you for instance log in to your character screen beforehand or do all the servers go down untill release?
---
Thank you all for helping bringing us back this special game. 
---
Some questions regarding layering were not yet answered clearly imo.
---
* How man layers will we have per server and/or at what cap does a realm switch to "Full"?
---
* How are you planning to transition to phase 2 if the regular player base stays too high? How likely do you believe is this scenario?
---
Thank you again guys, this game means so much to many of us.
---
Do you have some rough estimation on the drop-off numbers after the initial wave or is this event something totally new for you with little space for expectation? (Thank you very much to the whole team in bringing the game to us, I cannot wait to login!)
---
What were some of the bigger challenges with porting Vanilla onto the BFA code?
---
After the movie? No thank you.
---
Not everything has to be a TV show. The market's completely saturated with them because they just eat up old properties and shit out low-effort series that get canned early because nobody watches them.
---
He's just asking dude, he's not trying to waste their time...
---
Keep classic and release tbc. I love tbc not interested in "new content" for vanilla. thats not vanilla. either do fresh servers for BC or transfer copies from vanilla. Or just let private servers get all that money lol
---
Do you have any plans to fix any of the specs, or will you be leaving some in a useless state?
---
Well maybe he didn't know, your answer is enough, don't be rude :)
---
Doubtful.
---
PS I prefer to heal.
---
I would rather play with people I like than randoms. Their class and spec choice be damned.
---
Well that's just great. I had almost forgotten WC3 is also getting a re-release. Thanks alot, OP. Now I have **two** games I want to play but can't.
---
Yeah this was more in line with what I saw.
---
On pserver it was around 16k on a single realm.  In 2004, a measly 4k. In other words, a dead server.
---
there has been multiple problems with layering including exploits involving hopping from one layer to another. is this gonna be fixed before release?
---
No... lol not even close. Why on earth should it be around the same? It will range from 4 days /played to 20 days /played depending on how fast you’re trying to go and if you know what you’re doing or not
---
Turn down shadows and you could play on a potato. Shadows are CPU. In addition to that I don't even like shadows past "Good". You end up with "dynamic shadows that phase in and out on the trees and that are frankly distracting. They look like they were tacked on.
---
Other sucker settings. Anything past 7 ground clutter looks awful. 7 gives you what looks like Vanilla design but makes it interactive and movable on foilage.  Particle density past low is well past vanilla. Do you want your screen looking like a fireworks show or for a rogue to look like his hands are on fire? No? Turn it off. That is usually hard on CPU to.  I find anything past low distracting and again "tacked on".
---
The big improvements are ambient occlusion which puts more depth and shadows on things to make them look more real and less "flat"(Ultra is HBAO+), sunshafts and water. Some people don't even like the water. It's all preference. Those settings are pretty much all GPU outside the highest water setting which might be some CPU due to reflections.
---
***This will run better than the old client on the classic setting. It has multithreading through DX 11 that the original client didn't.*** 
---
I run this and my CPU is barely used and I have a 4770k at 4.3ghz. At 1440p with 8xMSAA My GPU is using about 2/3rds of it's power and is passively cooled on an undervolt (VEGA 56). This is with environment detail set to 10 as well, which is way past Classic. I get high hundreds in the FPS department uncapped and I just cap it at 75. It's a freakin MMO not a shooter and 75 looks fine on my 27 inch display. Using 200 watts on my GPU instead of like 80 is stupid.
---

---
For people with laptops I would definitely recommend turning some of the things down I did as well. They do very little vistually, in some cases make it worse and are stupidly higher cost on hardware. If I want to push my hardware I put on Witcher 3 with the new reshade ray tracing.
---
When you were looking for the old classic data did you come across any data for the later xpacs?
---
Well the city to be at is the one with the most efficient position to the raid 
---
So anywhere with a zeppelin is fine 
---
But I believe the auction house isn’t server wide but bound to the city ? Idk in which patch they made them server wide
---
How true to vanilla will classic be? If I come across something that *should* be there but isn’t (a quest chain that ends prematurely), how easy will it be to have it corrected?
---
what exactly are we guessing?
---
"i'M noT HeRe tO EdUcAtE YoU"
---
pretty sure their main stance is "whatever the community wants going forward" but I don't think they've really fleshed out whether or not that means polls or anything
---
Any plans to create additional content after Phase 6? I would love to see the base game being expanded further upon. OSRS (OldSchool RuneScape) did this and it's been a pretty fantastic success.
---
Did you deliberately choose to start off with the patch 1.11 version of PvP gear or did it just happen to get lumped in with the "all items have 1.12 stats" thing? It's going to have a gigantic influence on PvP for a really long time because this gear, which was originally added in Naxx, is on par with AQ40 loot but will become available starting in phase 2. That's four phases earlier than back in the day.
---
See [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cs1n29/fourday_chat_8_world_pvp_and_battlegrounds/exc11w4/) for further explanation.
---
I'm actually extremely happy they won't be in at launch. World pvp before battlegrounds was a ton of fun
---
No need for that, we all speak english
---
Has the initial player count exceeded expectations? If so, could you give us a rough estimate of that (10% more than expected, 100% more, etc)?
---
Imagine playing WoW in 2k19 without ElvUI.. Even if it's for classic.
---
I've used it a ton when playing on Private TBC servers, even if I was Bongos main back in 2007 (and about 100 other addons that are almost all now inside ElvUI/TukUI)
---
Oh, I thought he meant the WotLK engineering mount.
---
but it wont in classic
---
What do you think the impact will be on your team and Blizzard as a whole if Classic greatly exceeds expectations? Is it fair to say that Classic being wildly successful may shift priorities within the organization?
---
It's all in good fun man 😅 like I said it's a 15 yo game - that I've played before btw - so I know what to expect. It's just nice having that childlike sense of joy for a video game again
---
Melee leeway is an example of a mechanic of vanilla wow days that doesn't work with today's context. Are you looking to faithfully modify the way this mechanic works so its similar to vanilla days or simply leave it and claim you're allegiance to #nochanges. 
---
In my opinion when people who say #nochanges they truly mean they want the game as they had it back in vanilla. That means to swallow pride and introduce/develop and create Bugs, mechanics and everything else as it was back then in orde to feel/act the same way it did in Vanilla days.
---
Do we know what services will be offered throughout Classic?
---
Server transfer was on the "eventually" list, but is that the extent of it or will we get paid name changes, faction changes and race changes?
---
I'm going to be making potions and selling them as I lvl
---
17k away is barely halfway lmao. Not even close.
---
It does not appear to be a problem based on current realm populations but down the line are you willing (not last resort) to merge low population servers? It seems Blizzard has been very against actually merging servers for retail as it has been needed to be done for many years.
---
Could you give any hints for possible additions to Classic after the last phase? Such as unreleased vanilla content e.g Hyjal, Emerald Dream zone, Azshara Crater?
---
until in phase 2 where layering gets deactivated and suddenly you're in a world made for 2000 people trying to sustain a 20k population, so there's not enough herbs/ore to sustain all players and the economy/raiding community crashes.
---
So first of all, if you haven't played the class you wouldn't know the info is wrong so I dont think you can blame OP.  
---
Secondly, these sheets look cool and if the info on them were correct they would be pretty useful.
---
I think the problem is that either Kargoz needs to update his guides and videos or someone else needs to get this info sorted out.
---
Are there any unused assets from the original game that you are planning on adding AFTER phase 4? 
---
Rather, are there plans to add additional content that weren't in the 2006 version? And if they are not set in stone, would the team be open to discussing such a plan?
---

Thank you for taking the time to do this AMA. Thank you for building the world that encapsulated us all. Thank you for going back to your roots. Thank you for bringing us home. I look forward to getting lost again, much love from Houston.
---
Everything is useful at the beginning because everyone is leveling - even stacks of peacebloom will have a good market.  If you aren't using the Mats for creating yourself,  you should be AHing them all.  It'll take several weeks and possibly months for the server economies to flatten out - for awhile it will be a complete seller's market.
---
What’s a Guardian?
---
Lfg? Plenty of guilds are already built.. What rep grinds are you taking about?
---
MAYBE the will be a fire resist issue on tag, but you guys are grossly overestimating these raids, a huge portion of the bosses have almost no mechanics.
---
Hi WoW Dev team! Thanks for doing this AMA. I have 2 questions that pertain to Molten Core.
---
1. Will bindings be available phase 1?
---
2. On private servers, hunters could kite Garr adds far away (into Ragnaros’ lair for instance). Will there be a leash range for Garr adds in classic?
---
You can delete it and than quickly make a new toon this time on the true side the alliance. Just be  quick before somone else takes name and do it when limited people would be on.
---
RIP Witcher season 2
---
Layering is re-branded sharding to shut up the complainers
---
I'd love to see one of UC
---
also good because both have increased move speed so you don't slow one another down
---
For a movie based off of a game it was great. It was beautifully shot aswell. But the casting and writing is what killed it.
---
I know between the closed beta and the stress test, it seemed some of the APIs were changed or broken for wow addons (such as spellIds being removed from the combat log and possibly others) which caused a lot of headaches for addon devs as the flood gates opened with new players downloading and testing addons.
---
Is the wow addon api pretty much set now or will there be more changes to it going forward to tweaking of it?  Since there really are no new "patches" per-say I wonder if you guys are happy with the state of the wow addon api or if there is more pruning to be done.  Is there a chance of any of the apis coming back at all?
---
Yeah, the answer was strictly relating to his high medium low pop question to which it absolutely works this way to the best of my knowledge.
---
Would make sense to have a full hardcap.
---
What is the plan for post-launch development and resource allocation? Will there always be people available to fix bugs if need be, even a year from now on (etc...)?
---
A lot of people are talking just about how boring it is for them or what ever but you should take into account buffs and extra gold you can generate. If you're going into all wPvP/PvP with food buffs from cookie (aided by fishing) you'll have a competitive edge to most people who don't.
---
Even small buffs from food are huge in Classic, a couple of stat points here or there will make the difference going to new zones and stuff.
---
Will front stabbing (rogues being able to back stab someone from the front through strafing and proximity) be just like it was in vanilla or will it be fixed? Seems in beta it's been fixed.
---
/hug HyenDry
---
BIS charts are generally for PVE raiding, and in that case druids are primarily healers so it's perfectly viable and optimal because your armor type isn't relevant, as you don't need take hits.  Throughput stats matter more.
---
Chromie could take us back!
---
Yes, it's terrible dramatic.
---
Have you guys given thought about how to go about updates after Phase 6 release? Are you planning to do any sort of polling of the classic community? Others suggested picking up the in-game polling system from OSRS.
---
Regarding after Phase 6 releases, do you have any ideas that you guys have been bouncing around? Not so much specifics stuff but are you guys thinking of new dungeons/raids? Building on the RPG elements maybe? Such as adding a way to study language skills? Big quest chains? I figure it's such a long way out anyway - but it's never too soon to start contemplating ideas.
---
Thanks for everything y'all are doing :)
---
With the way that you created Classic WoW (based on the BFA client on the backend). Obviously, this brings changes to the addon API.
---
So we've seen recently that addons are being developed to replicate a sort of "Dungeon Finder" where essentially it filters text from the world chats and puts it into a nice list for players to choose which groups to whisper for a dungeon. Some of them also feature the ability to spam world chats with "LFM" on a set timer.
---
Do you think something like this breaks the "Spirit of Classic"? and would an addon like this be able to be broken through tweaking the API or other such means?
---
If they don’t, switch guilds! 😬
---
There is a need for a mega-server before more servers.
---
Mega-servers will solve any chance that a server might die, more server just increase that chance ten fold
---
So open free transfers off those servers?  
---
I know the phrase “free” is a dirty word, but free server transfers down the line in exchange for a better launch, someone has to do a cost/benefit analysis and see that the happier you make people initially, those people will stay subbed longer vs the opportunity cost of transfers... it seems like a no-brainer to me.
---
Are you able to give us any indication what Low / Medium / High / Full means, in terms of number characters created on realms? Even a ballpark range or bracket?
---
I really hope farther down the line we're able to, as a well established community, vote on things that should be added to the game, where like 75% of the votes have to be a *yes* or w/e. I think at that point we'd be able to distinguish between adding a 'guild bank' vs. adding 'dungeon finder', for example; it just allows for so much more positive growth. Imo.
---
Actually having to trust people is part of the classic experience. Let's not go down the slippery slope of asking for convenience features from future expansions.
---
Hi WoW Devs, I have three questions for y'all:
---
1. When asked about Ragnaros dying in the first week in a recent interview, Brian Birmingham said that he was betting on Rag to prevail and that he didn’t think players would be able to take him down in that time period.  We also know from recent bug reports that there are a number of things that private servers did not take into account on boss fights (Parry chance, hit and crit suppression).  
---
Without going into too much detail, are there other differences between popular private server code bases and the official code that will have a major impact on raiding?
---
1. Will the client-side code base be continually updated to the latest retail code base?  Or, will only major infrastructure and security related changes make their way into the Classic client?
---
1. Melee Leeway is still a hot topic in the community.  How was the original value of the bonus range being ⅓ of a second of running (running being 8 yd/s) decided upon?  Was leeway always present in the server-side code?  If so, why was it not introduced client-side until patch 1.10?  If not, what prompted the addition of it?
---
Will there be ever a server in the Baltic States?
---
Choices! Pressing 3 buttons in the correct order is a lot less impressive if you only have 3 buttons than if you have 25 with 22 not being viable or super niche!
---
Agreed, watch some videos and get excited, sure. But planning every move 1-60 sounds like hell. Wouldn’t be surprised if those are the people who quit first
---
Will players be able to transfer their characters from low/medium realms onto high or even full population level realms?  
---
When will players be able to purchase paid character transfers?
---
I think the answer is fairly simple, how long do you think it'll take 10k+ people to get tired of player classic wow on launch night to log off and let you have a turn?
---
As far as I understand you are not planning on fixing many of the gameplay exploits that were present during all of Vanilla. If people find new exploits (either undiscovered or fresh ones due to the remake) are we to expect that anything that's not completely game-breaking will not be fixed ?
---
how come you were so hesitant with the server selection during the initial days of name reservations? and what are the plans to deal with the low/high pop servers going into phase2?
---
A question for ranking: How long will phase 2 last do you think? How far do you think the first generation of rankers will get before premade BGs in phase 3 will become the meta? 
---
Will phase 3 start off with all premades already having several rank 13+ players in them? Do you think someone will gain rank 13 or 14 before battlegrounds are introduced?
---

**&lt;Completion&gt;** Horde | East Coast NA | PvP | Semi-Hardcore | **Stalagg or Skeram** Sixty iterations off the central finite curve, there's a semi-hardcore guild named &lt;Completion&gt; that will dominate world PvP, raid Tuesday/Thursday 8-11pm, and create a family like community. Our discord has collections of all of the top class guides, profession guides, and BiS lists. Come home to the impossible guild of your own completion.
---
**Who are we?**  
---
Our guild is run by experienced and skilled players that have played since 2004-2006. Our raid leaders have raided in vanilla through Naxx, and have raided through Naxx on private servers. Others have achieved PvP ranks ranging from Rival to Gladiator on retail, and raided at a mythic level with exceptional parses. In short, we raid to gear for PvP. We are looking to min/max our characters at a relaxed pace to dominate all aspects of PvP and PvE and have a blast doing it.
---
**Who are we looking for?**  
---
We are looking for more like-minded players with character min/maxing aspirations with a passion for PvP and raiding to join our ranks and fill out our 40+ man roster. We have a biggest need for a **Warrior.** We are accepting all other classes as well and everyone that joins will have every opportunity to earn a raid spot. We are also accepting any casual players looking for an active community.
---
**What will we be doing?**  
---
We will be raiding Tuesday/Thursday, 8-11 EST and will use a 25% weekly decay DKP system for loot. There will likely be a 3rd optional day added in the future during BWL progression and onwards. We also will be doing many world PvP events and PvP raids, as well as an extensive amount of premade BGs. We will make a valiant attempt at rank 14 without killing ourselves in the process. Also, we will have other weekly community events such as dueling tournaments, "where is X" events, and weekly bounties against certain Alliance players, all with gold prizes.

When was Loot Trading added?

When was auto-loot added?

What are your thoughts on Classic+ ? (Classic+ is generally the idea to develop new content for vanilla instead of the original path = TBC / WOTLK) On this subreddit u/ChromedDragon made some really cool designs which portray the idea in zone wise.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c09szr/what_youve_all_been_waiting_for_how_northern/er2ycg0/
---
Are there plans currently to release the complete original trilogy now that Classic is days away from release? Many of my friends are excited for Classic but our true love for the game was experienced in TBC/WotLK and the idea of Classic + isn't something many of us are interested in having played the game in AQ 40/Naxx gear knowing that having more content will lead to bigger problems.
---
Waiting in queues is the new Classic meta.
---
Can you make a surprise release 1 day earlier?
---
You mean the Warcraft lore that they changed **for** the movie.
---
&gt;I think one of the biggest questions I see floating around the community (especially among the communities of guild leadership) is what state Molten Core's loot tables will be released in.  
---
&gt;In phase 1, will the raid only drop items added to Molten Core before patch 1.3? In phase 2, will it only drop items added to Molten Core before 1.5? Or will it have the 1.12 vanilla Molten Core loot table from the start?
---
Would love an official response to this one
---
The vision for replicating Classic wow is clearly a 1.12 foundation. However, the devs have shown they are willing to pick things from earlier patches that will lead to a better experience, especially when it comes to early raids that did not benefit from 1.12 class buffs, 16 debuff slots, or buffed itemization. Has Blizzard considering making level 60 5-mans + Ony / MC / BWL in their hardest vanilla forms (no nurfs, etc.), to help account for this. Many of us are worried that the game will be even easier than it originally was due to this, and lead players to raid logging very early on in the first phase.
---
What are the pillars of Classic for the dev team, and how would this influence the future of it--most often called Classic+?
---
TBC/realm restarts both have their own issues, I think they would lead to a splitting of communities.
---
Also, would the dev team ever consider deploying servers with custom rules? One of the most fascinating things about the games that inspired WoW originally(Everquest 1, Ultima Online, ...) were that there was a high penalty on death, especially if killed by a player. Is a classic server with player looting / perma-death possible?
---
What kind of action can we expect to be taken against botters farming herb / mining nodes? Do these servers have dedicated GM teams that understand classic and will investigate reports immediately or are we stuck with copy paste GMs that ignore issues. The "banwave" theme of punishing them all at once after months of collecting names isn't going to be a good plan for young servers with undeveloped economies. Please don't let a lazy GM team screw up the hard work you guys have put into designing these servers.

Oooh I'd like an answer to this.
---
Been one.
---
How long do you intend to have phases last?
---
WHat made you change your minds about that whole "you think you do but you don't" thing?
---
When Classic launches will the "Enter World" button on the character creation screen become clickable or will we need to relaunch our game?
---
Has there been any thought to changing the spell batching to possibly 200ms vs the current 400ms (assumed)? While we all know it was like this in vanilla, it just feels clunky with modern tech.
---
Are there any plans to change the requirements for the Ahn'Qiraj war effort so auctioneers don't horde all the materials and try to sell at massive profits? 
---
Are there any plans to remove or mitigate world buffs in raiding/dungeons? I know some people are highly opposed to world buffs. I myself think they should stay.
---
I'm having the same issue.  Any information would be great.
---
Will you release the horde to alliance ratios before launch? It may persuade players on "full" pop realms to transfer with their friends!
---
i reccommend golemagg, it doesnt seem to be dominated by specific nationalities and has a really close H/A ratio. its classed as FULL though but i think its still got plenty of room
---
Greetings Blizzard Devs, thank you so much for taking the time to do an AMA with us. 
---
Yesterday it was announced that the addon "TradeSkillMaster" (TSM) will be in classic.  Most of us are extremely worried about the impact it will have on immersion in the classic community.  
---
**Will you permit powerful, market-stifling addons like TradeSkillMaster  in classic?**

Dominoes is working. I set it up on the beta.

How much money would it take to be able to re-roll a pet name? You guys are sitting on a goldmine here!

Is there the possibility of an alternate progression path in terms of story and expansion? I.e Can we get an alternate universe and a whole new game instead of following the same path as before?
---
This thread...
---
If theres 50k ppl on a server with layering and we share one ah... how fast do you think the price will be driven down?
---
I can certainly understand that point of view, especially the account wide stuff. Personally like the connected approach, it works very well in Star Wars in particular with 'family trees' as the excuse. Although that makes little RP sense unless all characters are the same race..
---
Personally I'm hoping for an addon rather than in game system. That way no-one has to be inflicted with something they don't want.
---
Longterm although TBC/Wrath were good, my personal preference would be a copy server that runs 'Classic+' whilst these servers remain pristine. Have to see what that would do to the population. OSRS for example started to decline once the base content was done.
---
A question for layers: Have you considered 'un-layering' capital cities? It would be nice to see a lot of players inside the capitals.. I think it would take away a lot of the hype if all the capitals are empty when players enter them..
---
Really good question, would love to see LFG addons get blocked.
---
might as well just make wow 2 at that point
---
Opposite boat, wanted to roll Alliance for the Pally power, old friend invited me to his guild that is only Horde. Shaman time it is...
---
1) How does your team plan to address the deficiencies of the Vanilla resource spawn system, once layering is disabled? Herbs and minerals specifically. There will obviously be significant demand for raid consumables, meaning a lot of players will be farming for Black Lotus, Plaguebloom, Rich Thorium Veins, etc. Those resources are already scarce on low population private servers. We can only imagine what the scarcity will be like on a full server like Herod. 1,000 gold for 1 Black Lotus? Certainly a possibility...
---
2) How are you going to handle world buffs? Are they going to be enabled at the launch of each new 40-man raid, or will they be disabled for a certain length of time, to make the raid more difficult?
---
3) Will Rallying Cry of the Dragonslayer have a cooldown? Meaning, if a head is already hanging in Stormwind or Orgrimmar, will players have to wait for it to disappear to be able to receive the buff?
---
4) Are there any difficulty adjustments planned for 40-man raids?
---
5) Molten Core bosses had their loot tables updated multiple times throughout patches 1.4 - 1.6. Which items will be in at Classic launch, and which won't?
---
6) Are there any plans to reduce the talent respec gold cap?
---
Adding more servers will create dead servers. On the other hand, increasing population cap or making mega servers will protect against having dead servers for a very long time.
---
Why do we not have any mega-server options? A lot of people want mega-servers. Can we make Herod a mega-server?
---
LFG UBRS...
---
For me, it was Tuesday!
---
Totally
---
Question: Can we assume that things that were added to the game outside of major content patches will usually be available in the game at launch? For example, the Molten Core loot table updates, Thorium Brotherhood and Timbermaw Hold recipes, and Skill Books that didn't drop in AQ (e.g., Manual of Eviscerate IX - which dropped in UBRS after 1.12). This would not apply to things like Argent Dawn and Cenarion recipes which were released in tandem with major content releases.
---
Any plans to introduce API functionally to allow addons to more accurately track threat/aggro?
---
I appreciate all of your guys' concerns. I will for sure be careful and not let this game destroy what I've built for my life so far. I'M JUST EXCITED IS ALL!!
---
Was there ever any consideration of rebalancing 5man and raid content around the far more powerful 1.12 talents, mechanics, and itemization?
---
Further piggy backing, originally PvP to PvE transfers were allowed, but PvE to PvP transfers were not. I understand the reasoning behind this (we had to level while getting ganked, why should you transfer and not have to do the same?), but I also think it's a valid question to ask if times have changed enough that this isn't a big deal. My primary concern is that I'm rolling PvE - if it turns out that my guild falls apart, and I'm not able to find another one that I mesh with and fit schedules, there's another guild I'm connected with on a PvP server, and would want the opportunity to possibly transfer there.
---
Tl;Dr - when/if paid transfers become available, will past restrictions be removed so we can go from PvE to PvP, as that's where our other community may live?
---
I gotta do my laundry.
---
How do you come to a decision on what stays in the game over what gets pushed out in regards to discrepancies in patch version vs. phase?
---
For example, we had two moons in the skybox in vanilla up until around patch 1.10 when we got weather effects, when the moon disappeared (due to a bug or otherwise). Weather effects are in the game at launch, and we appear to not have the the second moon in Classic. Why did you come to the decision to have weather effects at launch instead of a few phases in, and to go a bit further... could have have the second moon back?
---
They were, and they did add them. In BC.
---
Two weeks after vanilla launch, previously played city of heroes
---
So cute! :)
---

---
Would you consider changing the mats needed for the war effort to prevent stockpiling?
---
I want to give u these questions:
---
You said that u will nerf hunter's scatter trap combo.Will you nerf Rogue's second Blind after preparation?Rogue cant beat Mage without 2nd Blind after Ice block.Rogue main by myself.
---
Leeway in vanilla,will u turn it on?If yes,then can it kill the Rogue vs Warrior matchup which is based on Rupture kiting?
---
Will u fix the Paladin proc which is called Reckoning?
---
How long will be the phase 1?
---
Same, the eastern nomad style of the horde appeals to me more than the alliance fantasy European medieval style
---
Are the layers set except when you group or are the players constantly switching between layers upon different logins? I started playing wow again in BFA and I hate the lack of community due to the system. I want to run into the same players over and over again throughout leveling as that was part of the magic of classic.
---
Can't you just reserve it?
---
Yes, it's still a big deal. The community would throw a fit if this became allowed. Everybody would just play PVE until they hit the level they want then transfer.
---
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh can't wait dude!!
---
Are there any plans to alter the way ranking works in the honor system? Currently rank 13 and 14 require an unhealthy amount of playing and encourage account sharing in order to maintain honor to avoid decay.
---
Low effort.
---
just set up an auto clicker so u don't go afk and DC cause you know 3rd party programs and such
---
If Classic WoW is a huge success, what are the odds that we get new level 60 content instead of continuing through TBC or stagnating at Naxx content forever?
---
“You have been Disconnected from the server”
---
Would solve the hassling for us though. We wanna play with our fellow vikings.
---
Why did you choose 'hoppin' when 'bouncin' would be more accurate and fit with the picture you chose.
---
oooo I didn't consider that, thanks
---
Is there add-ons for this kind of thing?
---
Dynamic spawns are on. On the stress test I could kill the same boar over and over and over again **very** quickly because the start zone was rammed. Then an hour later after layering kicked in, there were more than enough mobs to go around. It'll be fine.
---
It's the getting into the server that's gonna be the hard part.
---
and yet they allow impact font
---
There's even an item that makes you take damage. Meaning you can't be poly'd for i believe 10 seconds. Either 5 or 10 seconds. Meaning that dude can never get the good start they want.
---
Using boomer ironically to refer to people who aren't boomers is a thing
---
Early on the mob shouldn’t be alive long enough to use snd.
---
I still don't mind summoning stones personally.
---
Who is your favorite WoW Classic streamer?
---
I can't speak for the devs obviously, but they warned everyone in multiple blue posts about excessive queues, more or less stating that if you choose to roll on a realm like Herod (US), you will experience perhaps upward of 10,000 in the queue. I'm sure they'll release more servers as they become necessary, but this has been addressed somewhat thoroughly.
---
Obviously if your question is more specific, I'd edit it to reflect that specification.
---
As far as logging in goes, it depends on what server you're on. If you chose Herod, you won't be able to log in during peak hours unless people actually start leaving the realm. Like you said, at launch it's only gonna get worse, not better. But for most other realms, I think they'll be okay. I find it hard to believe that they'd fail to consider at-launch log-ins as part of their warning pertaining to server queues.
---
But I also feel that they'll undoubtedly open another realm or two at launch if they have to, just to ensure a lot of the fresh-subbing people fill up new realms and don't create queues on full realms.
---
Would love an answer to this. I was looking forward to the original mounts and when I found out they were being excluded I was really disappointed.
---
I asked another player why their Mana bar was red in a non-trolling, legitimately didn't know way.
---
A wise man once said "Hold the line!"
---
Can you shed any more light on the current situation with the "full" realms?  What are the thoughts around handling these come phase 2 when layering is meant to be removed and they're possibly still overcrowded?
---
I know it's far in the future, but is there any plans for implementing Burning Crusade after Phase 6 ? BC was my favorite expension of all times and i would love to play it again !
---
I'm laugh so hard when these hype babies leave the game. People excited to play but make it to only level 20
---
How are they elwynn forest themed u ask? Because these are the candles that come from the kobolds in that god forsaken cave.
---
its cheap as fuck lol
---
You can prevent dead servers by making mega-servers.
---
 Will players be able to re-create the Corrupted Blood incident during  the first week of phase 4? It wouldn't be an authentic, Blizzard-quality  Classic experience if we couldn't! :)
---
I cant wait for all the people pushing this fantasy to be absolutely crushed when the game comes out
---
Yeah.. That's sadly the recipe for any blizzard release. It's a joke. A billion dollar gaming company who doesn't know their shit.
---
Thank you, everyone for the clarification. Big help!
---
What aspect of Classic was more difficult/time consuming to match to Vanilla: the appearance or game mechanics?
---
thoughts on jorts?
---
Install everything in a USB3 stick and you can play at any pc. I used to do that when I was playing from net cafes.
---
You guys gonna do something about bots this time around?
---
Not a Blizz employee but... it shouldn't have any effect on economy, because it's directly proportional.  
---
Layering = more players per realm = more demand = more supply.  
---
No layering = less players per realm = less demand = less supply.  
---
So it shouldn't have any effect on economy overall.  
---
However the concern is one player abusing the layering system and farming multiple nodes from the same area, but again, given the population, that is very unlikely to happen.
---
Original WoW, vack in the days, could be copied to a flashdrive and you were able to run it from there. The launcher just refers to the executable in the installation directory afaik. So if you copy WoW to a flashdrive and run tje executable, it should work. You just have to enter your account credentials manually as the launcher also does this for you automatically.
---
just go make macros and name them the old spells and put them in your action bar it's not like you would use them anyway.
---
Also it's not a choice if only one option is viable
---
I actually do destroy my hearthstone before level 10, it frees up a bag space, and I can hearth by just dieing.
---
Could we get an expanded look at what sort of plan you have for different loot sources and phases? 
---
Will Molten Core bosses such as Shazzrah (12264) only have Crimson Shocker in addition to a tier piece in phase 1?
---
Will Sunken temple quests be added all at once or staggered by patch?
---
Will quests and their rewards that are not specifically linked to a big event (I.E. Elite Hinterland quests for horde) be available immediately or added in patch appropriate phase?
---
Will dungeon items such as Rosewine circle drop from their patch appropriate phase boss (War master Voone pre 1.10) or their final 1.12 location (Urok Doomhowl 1.10)?  
---
I understand that there may be items that have exceptions just looking for examples so I can understand what the general rules will be.   
---
P.S. Classic is gunna be sick.
---
Hey guys, not sure i have a specific question to ask, but i'd just like to thank you for all the work youve put in to make this possible.
---
I know the community has at times been pretty...harsh..., and im sure it can be a thankless job at times, so i'd just like to say thanks :)
---
As far as we know none of them will be in at launch
---
I thought there were spanish speaking servers?
---
This
---
Yeah, if the people racing to 60 are not streaming when they usually stream they are having different people play
---
min/maxing is about getting an edge though???
---
There have been many people discussing the pros and cons of spell batching as it has been implemented. Understandably, as code designed to address hardware limitations, it can never be truly recreated. Has the team considered changing the spell batching window to a more middle of the road or even lower value to account for modern low ping connections and subjective lag feel?
---
Can you offer us some concrete numbers on what the population and faction balance look like on the existing Classic realms (both EU and NA) so we can better shift ourselves around to spread across the servers?
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1x73l9yXK0-l6uL3D3K011DAszFJ7kPzo4ZTTvB_q3co
---
So far you've opened up three additional PvP realms for the North American market and seem to be getting very little response in convincing players to move off the very-overpopulated realms. With regards to incentivising players to switch, did the team give any consideration towards the attachment players have for their character names, and how the limited number of available character slots creates a hostage situation for them?
---
Are the servers going to be pulled offline before turning on, or will the “enter world” button under our characters simply turn red when we can log in?
---
Keep the memes alive!
---
Yeah that account being shared and breaking ToS is exactly the situation I want to avoid.
---
This is a very important question!
---
Hello and thanks for doing this for us! I was wondering why the RP-PVP server was hosted in the LA data center vs. the Chicago data center where all the current retail RP servers are hosted. It seems like there are a ton of EST players who would love to be on the RP PVP server but don't want to deal with the extra latency. Wouldn't having the server more centralized benefit more players in the long run and push that server to fill faster?
---
Character transfers still unconfirmed, which is in the back of every insecure server chooser’s head. 
---
I’m thinking it’s likely but what do I know???? Nuthin
---
The classic one
---
I would love this
---
At this point, Blizzard should buy Elv and just incorporate it into the base game. It's that good.
---
That's a non-answer. How would they know if the players wanted it and do they have something planned to determine if the players want it? Are they planning to poll whether players want polls?
---
ye but how much TPS are we talking about? 1-5 % more TPS? 10%?  because the dmg you gain from weapon skill on glancing blows are white hits, and a tank does mostly spam heroic strike and it doesnt count on that.
---
I guess it’s pretty dangerous, it only took 300 spainiards to ruin the aztecs, that server is fucked.
---
Seeing as all PvE servers in NA are currently in high/full population, are you guys considering adding another server, similarly to what was done for PvP servers?
---
Thought bind on equip gear meant you were permanently stuck with it.
---
Game crashed at lvl 8 and I was kicking myself since I hadn't saved yet and clearly would have to start over.
---
Will the Raid Lockouts in Classic WoW be the same as they were in 1.12? 
---
Also, would the "Weekly Maintenance" occur on the same day as retail for US/EU i.e Tuesday for US &amp; Wednesday for EU?
---
&gt;This is how they were in Vanilla WoW (Post 1.9)  
---
&gt;Molten Core: Every 7 Days, resetting during weekly maintenance.  
---
&gt;Blackwing Lair: Every 7 Days, resetting during weekly maintenance  
---
&gt;Onyxia: Every 5 Days  
---
&gt;Zul'Gurub: Every 3 Days  
---
&gt;Temple of Ahn'Qiraj (40-man): Every 7 Days, resetting during weekly maintenance  
---
&gt;Ruins of Ahn'Qiraj (20-man): Every 3 Days
---
Addon dev here: Can you please make wow support a way to make a single addon that loads for both classic and bfa without “out of date” checked. My code works for both but I have to upload 2 zips just to change 1 line in the TOC.
---
The fact that this comment has both gold and silver really makes me concerned about the state of the classic community...
---
&gt; The biggest waste of mana is the competition between your raid's healers trying to outdo one another and the overhealing it causes.
---
Word! That's prettymuch what I was trying to say! :p
---
Optimizing the coordination of healers would probably lead to a situation that is unfavourable for the healers as the most likely outcome is that you don't need that many anymore.
---
Also: If a healer tries to play conservative with their mana in order to be capable of still having some when others are running out of it, they'd be the one looking bad as their numbers would be lower.
---
So healers are at the weird situation where playing well might make them look bad.
---
Could you comment on Ion's previous tweet about items being added to MC in phase 2 &amp; 3: https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/1121853269033328641
---
Is this still the plan?  This would mean there are numerous instances of items being added to raids in a phase after the raid's actual release
---
I think this is the best option. If you let the player base decide then we have no one to blame but ourselves.
---
Another user linked this below, you should totally check it out it has a ton of info if you want it, or you can look through the take aways at the bottom for a quicker read.

This is a great question! Hopefully they give a hint for where to find the answer.

Dont talk about AQ its like 1 year from now 😅
---
Lol you just know I'm right and I called you out on how pathetic you sound. And no I actually have a career and live with my girlfriend, thanks for checking up on me though :)
---
Adding my support to this - forcing servers to transition INTO BC/Wrath servers would be terrible and put us in the same position as before Classic was a thing. 
---
Please, if BC/Wrath becomes a thing (and they should), make server-specific servers (Pagle, Pagle-BC, Pagle-Wrath, etc.), and allow a one-time account-copy (user, or Blizz initiated) to allow us to simultaneously play our characters in the different expansion ecosystems. (Account, vs Character copy, would prevent gold/item duping, and in essence would transfer the already existing economy to the new expansion ecosystem)
---
It's the same on Shazzrah
---
Will there be new original content created for the Classic WoW world?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cqt8n7/wanting_to_set_up_my_ui_before_launch/ewzpy10/
---
Hey, glad you liked it!
---
Not being able to play Classic right now and have to wait 6 more days.
---
&gt;But the simple facts are, Swedes are not a majority on ANY SERVER. Regardless of how many "friends" you convince. Because the simple fact is. Majority of players aren't on reddit.
---
??? 
---
You literally replied to this quote from me:
---
&gt;I have not even once said that majority of or most Swedes will go to any server
---
Let's continue:
---
&gt;I'm simply saying, That the majority of players aren't gonna be swedes on Gehennes.
---
No, which I never even claimed in the first place, but you've been saying some other things, and I quoute you now, word for word:
---
&gt; the fact is that majority of Swedes prefer English over VOIP
---
&gt;The majority of swedes do not want to play in Swedish guilds.
---
&gt;99% of the Swedish WoW playerbase don't give a single fuck about being in one of these swedish guilds
---
What I've been asking you all along is, *how do you know this when there are zero trustworthy statistics of it?*
---
Like shit dude I'm sorry to say it but if you still can't figure out what you're doing wrong and what my point is then you should probably just stop using reddit and other online forums altogether to save other people the headache. Holy hell.
---
&gt;But in your mind and your narrative 
---
Talk about being delusional.
---
Do you plan on releasing any more new realms prior to launch?
---
That's a lot of space to say "go to the trainer every time."
---
Add warding to classic wow?
---
Ganking someone and them killing you.
---
How much of an effect do you see Classic having on the total number of subscribers for World of Warcraft in general? And as a follow up, have you seen a notable increase of users in the months leading up to Classic's launch?
---
jumping off a ledge as a hunter and realizing your pet just pulled the entire dungeon
---
By now you have activated a discord or two. I‘m sure someone else will in a bit.
---
and there is the true answer
---
Diablo 4 on PC?
---
You must be one of the people who thinks Classic should just be left to stagnate and rot after Naxx.
---
When the company who made a perfect game where you had tons of childhood fulfillment and made tons of great friends along the way decides to burn it and contort it into a shit filled social experiment. That's probably my worst feeling.
---
Oh you meant like in game feelings. Probably my pet dying makes me sad every time.
---
I'm rolling on Horde on ZT, I know of a lot of others that are too, I think the balance will be quite decent, maybe slightly in favour of Alliance, which is fine.
---
Wow, crazy amount of questions, that's insane, though like 1 percent will be answered. Gl
---
If you want WoW's Greatest Hits, either play Retail or wait for an expansion server that has what you're looking for. Shoehorning non-Classic features into Classic means *It's not Classic anymore*.
---
Thank god
---
If someone's dead and the party didn't wipe then it was probably their own fault.
---
The worst feeling in Classic is when as a healer a nice mp5 loot drops and some Warlock wins it on a NEED roll.
---
Yessss me tooo!!!!!
---
First of all, from the bottom of my heart, thank you for making Classic possible.  
---
My questions are;
---
1. What were the population caps on the original vanilla servers?
---
2. Can you confirm that the population cap on a single layer is equal to that of an original vanilla server?
---
3. What is the maximum amount of layers on a single Classic server?
---
4. What is your expected population cap on a single Classic server once layering is removed?
---
Dwarves are tolerable. And just level up through loch modan, redridge, duskwood. Duskwood is great. The early areas are cool. Then delete at 30. Not worth continuing after that.
---
Maybe you have TeamViewer on your work PC... Just pilot your home PC with it :p
---
Imp wands and spirit tap, then go into shadow. At 40 respec for shadowform. That's how I'm gonna be rolling.
---
Do you understand that many players are not end-game, hard-core raiders who do not race through content but instead enjoy the long journey, questing, dungeons and lore and that we want more of that content?
---
This is a great idea I think. You could ask the dev team if they would consider  this for classic wow for the AMA and see what kind of response they'll give you, if they don't have intention to do the poll hopefully they got other things in mind.
---
The system was great. You didnt have to rank up as there was no real incentive to do so other than the title really and maybe weapon for warriors. All other gear could more easily obtained from tier 2+ raids. And if you were incapable of raiding BWL you were likely incapable of ranking too. So all in all great system.
---
Most things that were hard at the age of 13 will be easier at 28
---
Didn't they say before world bosses are released 'there can't be more than one Kazzak' world bosses are out in phase 2. Phase 2 does not have a release date currently.
---
Just wanna say thanks for creating RP-PvP servers!
---
They should make an exact copy of the servers, preserving the Classic ones. You log in, your realm and characters are just as you left them, and there’s a new realm that is identical, all your characters, items, everything. Only difference is this new realm is “free play” for Blizzard, so they can do TBC or Classic+ here.
---
Don’t offer character copies, just duplicate the realm. This will erase any issues with economy, items, etc. 
---
Personally I think Classic+ would be a cool idea, starting with redesigned classic raid encounters. The hardest part of classic raids is not the bosses themselves, it’s organizing a group together to go in (and standing in the right spots). One thing retail has is awesome raid encounters. Give us updated mechanics for all the classic bosses.
---
How would those raids be implemented? Sidegrades that no one will do or will only do if it's easier than the equivalent? Linear upgrades would be even worse as it would completely destroy how the game is balanced. Pvp gear would become useless. 
---
People have this fantasy that you can magically just keep adding content without disrupting other things. It just can't happen. There is a reason level cap increases happen in games.
---
:) now you've got me right on the precipice of rolling alliance
---
Classic isn't vanilla. If you want vanilla, play a pserver :)
---
Due to the smashing success that was WOTLK, will you be hastening the release schedule to get everyone back to that nirvana?
---
2/10 at best
---
There's also an ammo/general goods vendor in Valley of Wisdom in the hut outside the building with Thrall.
---
I'm doing questie, and that's it. That's all you really  need.
---
And all the game asks in return is a sizable chunk of your waking life. Plus 15 bucks for the sub...
---
Yep. Wow classic will have to be enjoyed after he is in bed at 7pm.
---
It is a choice if you don’t know what’s viable. Inexperienced players might use every spell in the book because they think it’s the right way. That adds to their experience with the game regardless of how it affects their output.
---
Where is Mankriks wife? Asking for a friend.
---
I mean pally tier gear drops for horde in raids, no reason that Deathbone wouldn't
---
That will take forever! Is a good compromise!
---
What version of Fist of Stone from the boss Landslide in Maraudon are you going with at launch? Since this weapon wasn’t actually changed just a different version of it added later on to the loot table
---
 Future hopes for me would be -
---
1. Optional graphics overhaul
---
2. If expansions do come that they’re separate from classic in order to allow people to keep playing at level 60. 
---
3. If there’s demand then new raids and experiences beyond AQ and Naxx
---
Scandinavia, Holland, Belgium, Finland, Estonia, all developed countries that speak English well online. All sub their movies and series so every kid gets some English. Although, sadly, in Holland they've started dubbing cartoons too. 
---
Germany, France, Spain, italy, all dub their media. And they're bad at English online generally.
---
I basically learnt fluent English from watching fucking Scooby Doo subbed when I was 6.
---
That is incredible.
---
For the most part, and I say that with a bit of reserve, as long as the add-on doesn't call to functions that are exclusive to retail elements, the API seems relatively unchanged. With an exception on some elements that are slightly different but exist in both (such as flag requests for guild permissions as both have permissions, but each have slightly different permissions available to check). Obviously that can change, but from the direction it seemed they were taking, it's unlikely.
---
Makes sense. Can spam track mining when near mountains too
---
I will if i do make something. It will be butt ugly though
---
You're welcome sir, speedy recovery!
---
Many people have suggested taking Classic WoW in its own direction after Phase 6, with unique updates that maintain the spirit of the original, similar to OSRS. Obviously, its to early to gauge the success of  Classic, but is the idea of new original content in Classic something that is being seriously considered internally?
---
I probably won't be using any / most addons until end game. I may just use a quest helper and a gatherer addon and thats about it till I hit 60, and maybe recount.
---
Yes, I've read the blue posts. But I'm from Europe, playing European realms. We have 4 English PvP worlds for the entire continent. We're fortunate enough that they decided to make German and French servers to help with overpopulation. In doing so they completely overlooked the Spanish community who also have a large community.
---
I have created characters on all 3 of the English speaking PvP realms that have been launched already in anticipation for queue dodging. But as we draw nearer to the time, it's looking like the 3 realms that have already been released will be full before launch, with no doubt that Firemaw will be going in the same direction.
---
Now, bearing in mind these are only full of people who have reserved character names, how are these 4 English speaking PvP worlds going to handle the influx of players, the ones who didn't care enough to reserve their name, the ones are only actually interested in paying for a subscription once the game has been released? There are a lot of them out there, and it's only going to add to the issue.
---
You mention just launch a realm or two at launch. That's an assumption, and assumptions aren't facts, so until that is either confirmed or dismissed we can assume that queue times at release are going to be extremely lengthy. For the first 2 weeks anyone that plays peak hours with limited game time is going to have a very difficult experience emerging themselves into a world they can't even access.
---
So again, my question aimed at the devs is how do they plan on alleviating this issue of overpopulation on launch to ensure queue times aren't excessive.
---
Explanation posted below -- the scent was selected with Elwynn Forest in mind! I plan on burning them while questing there!
---
I think a good case could be say youre alliance and your server is mostly horde dominated.  You want to go to a server with a fairer ratio.
---
is there a chance the layering implementation will be extended to servers with extremely high population ?
---
Nice?
---
Exactly
---
Another stupid remark lol
---
Since they've added more servers my guess is that there are more people than they were expecting
---
Hello! Thank you for doing this AMA! much appreciated. 
---
I'm sure you get this question a lot but here it goes - what is the plan after all the phases have been rolled out? I understand that will be in quite awhile. Still, I'm curious as to what is being talked about! Will there be a rollout of TBC servers? The creation of new expansions or expansion like content (keeping with the design philosophy of vanilla ofc)? I'm curious to hear what has been talked about on your end! 
---
I can no longer tell if you are serious.
---
Are there any plans to alter the addon API to allow for the usage of certain specific gameplay-automating addons widely used by certain classes during vanilla, such as PallyPower and Decursive?
---
&gt;Imo the 2005 era saw a lot less complaining and sulking and people was just generally happy to play even though there were some road blocks.
---
Man, in 2005, Shamans were literally threatening to run their community manager over with a bus.
---
Maybe asking what patch it would be wouldv been a bit better I guess. I understand what you were asking.
---
Yeah, their actions really fly in the face of 'Blizzard has a plan, they know more than you'.

The mess with the server names and stuff just makes it seem like they are really disconnected with the community at large.
---
Hello dev team! First of all, thank you for all your hard work in delivering Classic to the masses. I have no doubt that we're just day away from an event which will be celebrated for many years to come!
---
**Question:** What were some of the most notably surprising challenges your team encountered when undertaking the task to bring Classic back to life, and how did you overcome these challenges?
---
Spy, get him!
---
This guy maths!
---
Lol, that's a good way of getting both worlds. Yet each character is a distinct person and creation to me. Is a solid idea though.
---
well, if you've planned properly you'll know what works and what doesn't.
---
I have not had beta but on stress tests i got to know roughly what works and what doesn't.
---
you dont need 50,000 add ons for leveling.

When will the first gurubashi arena chest spawn? Since the NA servers spawn at 3pm and 6pm, will they start with a chest already spawned?
---
When creating classic, was there anything specific your team thought was going to be incredibly hard to accomplish that turned out be A LOT easier than expected? or vise versa.
---
Pretty sure it's intended to make mounts into more of a gold-sink. It's a deviation from 1.12 with no plans to use content phasing. Definitely more to it than "most experience" ... :P
---
Thank you! Of course, borrow away!
---
Right, and if i knew a little about coke i could put an estimated date of what year coke classic is from
---
Are there any plans for post-naxx content that does not involve any of the already existing expansions?
---
My WoW friends won't play Classic. It's such a disappointment. 
---
Time for new friends.
---
Classic WoW is missing the authentic "moonwalking", seen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlF1jfknro8
---
We've seen you reimplement old bugs because they were authentic, so why not this one? Classic still has some weird bfa movements while targeting and running too.
---
Currently, we are limited to the 3 characters per account limit on name reservations.  With the game launching at 6 PM EST, will that limit be removed at exactly 6 PM EST, or will it be removed a bit before or after the official launch time to grab additional names going to the max account limit detailed out already?
---
Lol, I hope to prove not only you wrong, but myself. I've given up private servers before, but I think that was because I felt like I was solely trying to catch up with friends who zoomed past me; it helps to be part of a larger group all leveling and questing together (I'm glad I got in a guild as quickly as I did!) and I really think I will stick with it because of that. Plus, the point of my life that I'm at right now... I'm just really looking for something that I can play in my down time and maybe listen to a podcast while adventuring. IDK.
---
I may be assuming it'll be more casual in some aspects, but that'll be okay too. It'll be a wake-up call to focus on the game. Plus some other MMO's I've played were too easy, so the challenge will be welcome.
---
There wasn’t exactly a boatload of level 60 content, and things like rep grinds and what not didn’t disappear.
---
With Classic I think you’ll find guilds clearing multiple farm raids daily, pretty early on in the phases. That’s about it.
---
Stroopwafels are god's true gift to humanity. Simply gezellig.

Thanks for the downvote.
---
So I’m a sysadmin and there’s a couple ways you can accomplish this. If you’re organization allows flash drives, there’s software you can use to create a “portable” version of any application that runs isolated on the flash drive instead of the file system in windows. However, wow uses a lot of data. All that data is still going to pass through the firewall even if you use a VPN. The network admin will know this and question why you’re using a lot of data. If they trace the packets they can see where it’s coming from and you’ll likely lose your job. The only way around this is to 1) bring in your own WiFi hotspot and laptop, or 2) use some kind of remote software like splash top and play wow on your tablet with a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse. Make sure you’re either on your own hotspot or you’re using LTE/4g. Really you should be working though bc it’s not worth losing your job over.
---
Another stupid answer lol
---
I expect extreme queues for the first two weeks.
---
I didn't mean to imply that top end guilds would take 2 months to clear MC.  But the vast majority of players won't have leveled to 60 for the first 30-60 days.
---
On farm for &lt;1% of players doesn't really count as on farm imo.
---
Finkle's Skinner, if I don't get it before 60. Can't be the designated Core Hound skinner without it!
---
Hear, hear!
---
nah mon
---
As far as addons.  Do you have a list of ones that will be allowed and not be allowed.  I am concerned with add onls like LFG being in game.  From what I understand is that it has been used in the beta.  Is this going to be allowed?  There are other addons such as pvp scanner that shows the location of enemies and warns you when you are going to get attacked.  What is blizzards stance on this?
---
A huge part of the classic experience was discovery. 
---
Once old content is released and completed what does the future hold for classic wow? 
---
Is it possible we may discover new content again? Or will we be sticking to the script?
---
Did we miss anything the first go at classic. Such as 5 priest hakkar?
---
When Vanilla came out there were a ton of good games. Its 2019 people have so many games to choose from it's going to be rare for someone to choose WoWs slow and committed style to modern fast paced games. It's why the majoirt of people coming back to play are adults who played wow in 2004. All the hype. babies are just that. Hype babies. Every game that has ever came out was hyped then hated. anthem,eso,ff,destiny and so on. All hyped games that people complained about when they realised loot was hard to get. These hype babies just dont understand that WoW is not just a game but more of a commitment.
---
&gt;It’s not the chance of it dropping it’s the chance of you getting it
---
No, the 3% only relates to the chance of it dropping. This makes no assumptions about how many people within the raid you are competing to get it from
---
turns out blizzard is fucking dumb, who'd have thought
---
Will you continue to release content as classic proceeds? For example, I didn't start playing WoW til MoP and am so regretful that I wasn't around for Wrath. Will you eventually release subsiquent content and attempt to keep the rest of the Vanilla/Classic features?
---
Were there any surprising things you learned/discovered about the original game (technical or otherwise) during development of classic WoW?
---
Can we expect minor class balances ONLY for specs that are not used at all/not good? Maybe after the final phase has been active for a while? I'm talking super minimal tweaks in the existing content.
---
Who smells worse? Hogger or Thrall?
---
Auto run anywhere in vanilla, notice how you can't seem to go 20 feet without bumping into something and getting stuck, and tell me that again.
---
They knew what they were doing. The Everquest team knew what it was doing, too, and that's all WOW really was: "holy fuck, this is a great idea. we can exploit this"
---
Benefit only to farm content? The entire game is farm content except for the first week of each raid. 
---
Rage decay is NOT “qol”, the fact that you think that is plain ridiculous. AM is good for absolutely all aspects of the game, leveling included. 
---
Seriously, it seems like you haven’t even tried it
---
&gt; This time everybody starts at level 1. So chances of getting griefed by a much higher level are slim.
---
That was kind of my thinking, and the world PVP on a busy server at launch (STV) could be crazy epic. I really don't mind getting killed when it's give and take, love battlegrounds.
---
Do any of you subscribe to the philosophy of "IF IT'S RED, IT'S DED"?
---
How focused are you gents on keeping that community aspect alive in classic? Things like LFD, LFR, cross-realm dungeons, etc. really killed the feeling that one was a part of the "world" of warcraft, imo, and I'm nervous about things like that coming to classic.
---
The problem is getting a writing team as good as the guys behind something like Avatar. Just willing shows into existence isn't a guarantee they'll be good based on the IP - look at the Warcraft movie, they gave it to Duncan Jones who made a little modern masterpiece with Moon, Source Code was pretty good too, and then even he couldn't make Warcraft a good movie. Very impressive CGI != good movie.
---
Let me preface this question by saying I'm ecstatic we have WoW classic and have wanted something akin to it for many years. My only concern is the longevity it will have. Classic will take plenty of time to complete, but it will eventually be complete. With no further plans to add future expansions, what is the future for classic? What do you have in mind to stop it just collapsing as soon as the majority of the playerbase has completed all that is achievable?
---
Hey everyone, just wanted to give a huge thanks for putting on this AMA. When Tier 2 armor gets added with Blackwing Lair, is it going to use the placeholder artwork that it originally launched with or are we going to see the final models that were introduced in 1.9?
---
if for say you do progress to tbc and wotlk .. do you have any plans after than.. do we go to cata and start reapting history or do you start releasing new content after wotlk.. i know its a long time away since we will even know if were going tbc.
---
N O I C E
---
Pls! I think most people would love cosmetic changes if they are optional.
---
And when exactly did I suggest that?
---
Hi! Thanks for the AMA!
---
You guys just announced the servers are getting full really quickly, aside from the problems of queues on full servers do you predict any crashes? How are you going to deal with the huge amount of people all trying to login at the same time?
---
First, I'd like to say "Thank you!",  not only to the Devs in this AMA, but the entire classic team. For the people in this Sub especially,  when we go to work to do _our jobs_, we daydream about the _job_ *you're doing*. To say the least, this Dev team is doing something incredibly special.
---
Which leads me to my first question! I imagine you were flooded with requests, both internally and externally, to join the team. How was this small team assembled (Best talent? Most inspired? Least dishonorable kills?) and what was that experience like?
---
Secondly, what were some unexpected hurdles or pleasant surprises that the team came across during development?
---
I need a bis list for every bar of every level. Pls help reddit. I need to optimize every bit of my gaming experience.
---
After the last phase; which direction is your team most leaning towards? Rebooting TBC, or fresh new content?
---
What's been the easiest/hardest decision between keeping something the way it was in Vanilla and changing it to something different for Classic?
---
It's certainly going to be nostalgia for some who will come back, play briefly, then call it a day.      
---
       
---
But that won't be the case for a lot of people. Keep in mind, for a significant portion of the time since classic ended, there have been active and healthy vanilla wow servers with decent populations. Blizzard endorsing it and releasing it themselves is going to significantly strengthen those communities. I plan on playing quite a bit of classic.       
---
        
---
You won't know how you feel until you try it. Try a few classes, take your time, enjoy the experience.
---
for creating this entire problem with sharding and 3 servers ******
---
High; once they realize how much their missing out on haha
---
Will streamers such as Asmongold get priority to skip queues the day classic launches?
---
BiS aoe tanking shield  , battle chicken gives AS buff to party, sapper aoe burst dmg
---
Wife and I will play same toon to make sure this doesn't happen.
---
Outside of imp wands and spi tap it's very debatable. Assuming you have those the fastest leveling spec could be any mix of shadow, disc, or holy depending on how you plan on leveling and what happens to you (assuming you're playing in a pvp realm that is).
---
Yeah especially launch week you're going to expect inflated play time per session. Most people will play 6-8 hours on first logging so the Queues in the first couple of days might move a lot slower than when the servers are mature (and you have people logging to get on DE alts, bank alts, guys just logging to check the AH etc etc).
---
Personally I'm aiming for 12-14 hour days on the first week, then down to probably 4-6 hours a day average for a couple of months and see how it feels from there.
---
If you were to re-release the expansions would it be possible to keep our lvl 60 on a Vanilla server and maybe just copy the characters over (for a fee ofc) to expansion servers? Or would this be too costly?
---
When TBC got introduced, although it was a good expansion, selling all the hard-earned raid gear and replacing it with greens killed my gamer soul a bit and I emmideately wanted to go bac to Vanilla.
---
Being able to go back and play around with lvl 60 world PvP would personally keep me as a subscriber longer. Just like I come back to Diablo 2 for a season now and then.
---
Saw a youtube video of a gnome mage running to Darnassus. Took him 24 minutes and that includes him going to IF first. He took the wetlands shortcut. That saves a lot of time. Not sure how long to run from Darnassus to starting quester though.  I would venture a guess you might be able to do the entire trip in a half hour. I am doing it to gain rep for the cat mount. I despise the chicken mount...
---
He said famous.
---
Is there any intention/possibility of addressing leeway and/or (more importantly) spell batching? While the code may match what was Vanilla, the gameplay does not anymore due to how much better everyone's computers and internet connections are. At what point does preserving design made to accommodate technical limitations such as very high latency and server processing capabilities at the sacrifice of smoother gameplay become too much?

Yet you have to click on a different game in Bnet to get to D3. Classic is a drop down box on the retail wow list. They could in fact be a different infrastructure but until that's confirmed it's a valid question
---

For me it's nostalgia and slower, more tactical and enjoyable gameplay.
---
Warlock buddy gave me a Krol blade for free, I was level 50, it lasted me a good long while. First epic I ever had.
---
it's a disaster no matter what unless you're willing to switch servers. Damage is done
---
That’s a bit dramatic. I’m not saying I wouldn’t play the game if they added guild banks. Just this whole idea of adding things to what is supposed to be an authentic classic wow server can be a slippery slope. There are many things that can be added out of “convenience.” Where is the line drawn?
---
Back in Vanilla, both pieces dropped in the same run. Our main tank had enough DKP to grab both. It was the last thing he didn't have from Molten Core, so he immediately left guild for a guild that could progress. We were disappointed but all understood
---
Explains why gehennas is high already since people refuse to move.
---
Are there any plans to impliment more customization into classic? Barber shop comes to mind. These small things would have zeronimpact on gameplay and keep things classic but give the ability to keep your looks fresh!
---
"Exploit"
---
Does anyone know when the drop chance got hugely increased? because I got it in tbc when the drop chance was extremely low, but I remember near the end of tbc it was increased to something like 1%. but now I log on retail and everyone has it.
---
How do you think layering will affect the economy ?
---
Mage just gets better every expac until WoD (wod+ sucks for mage )

---
You are referring to the "low effort meme" rule? I mean, it's not amazing, but I did go through a few videos to find this interview and then made the image. There's at least some effort involved.
---
I really think Classic needs to work like progression servers in Everquest. It seems the only logical direction to me, but everyone in the world seems to be screaming for anything but that. Classic should be a way to level a character from the launch of the game all the way to the modern day, just at an accelerated timeline. And when it's over they can join that character to a normal realm, and then reset the realm to classic.
---
Being a priest and a melee resists your psychic scream. Just have to accept defeat or pray for help.
---
Are there any plans for added events this time around, similar to the Elemental Invasions, that will keep the game environment alive?
---
I haven't even played Vanilla, I was unfortunate enough to start in BfA, and I still teared up a little.
---
This is going to be a grand time.
---
oh god i hope you're not talking about that sub 1 quarter cataclysm release where they maintained the same 12mil (but not hitting 13 mil) subscribers that dipped after one quarter nearly 3/4ths a million players LOL
---
If you search up Joana's alliance leveling guide, it's a really efficient route. You don't have to follow it to a tee, but it can give you an idea of how you could possibly move through zones to keep questing instead of grinding mobs. Many people pair a guide with the questie addon which will put where quests and objectives are on the map, but as a new player I'd recommend not rushing and embracing the feeling of being lost. I'd say get an addon for coordinates to be on your map to help with the guide, but keep it at that to get a fun experience that is also fairly efficient.

Dungeon AOE grinding strategies significantly reduce leveling time. I can see well thought out groups leveling within that time period. Also, don't forget that Method players are getting paid, so it is literally their job to level up. I don't see any reason why they couldn't clear MC after the first week.
---
Only you can answer that question.

How was the journey of recovering the old game data? What lengths did the team have to go through in order to get it?

I recall reading they had to contact this parties to see if they had some data.

Because it shows you are actually commited to the game.
---
Can you elaborate on the choice to expand the use of sharding/layering from only in the starting area in the first weeks to everywhere for what is presumed to be months and months? The impact on rare resources has got to be monumental.
---
Is the desire to avoid low activity servers more important than changing the entire fabric of the games end game economy?
---
There were some really great changes in TBC and wrath. Do you think its possible to cut the good changes from the bad and not make the game a repeat of its former self?
---
&gt; Anyone caught up by only nostalgia will be gone within 3-4 ~~months.~~ weeks. possibly days.
---
Lol I genuinely laughed. Thanks for that!
---
Classic was designed for casuals. What’s the rush? Just have fun. Meet friends. Clear it at your pace. This subreddit just has some of the most hardcore players in the base of subs, but they are the 1%. If you’re having fun. Who cares about what your gear is, etc. it’s a game after all.
---
3 servers in total btw lmaoooooo blizzard is fucking stupid holy shit
---
Are you aware of the MASSIVE criticism and worries regarding layering and if so, are you considering changing something or are your decisions final?
---
NICE
---
Is there any way to estimate queue times or at least give us a general number of players on each server so we can make a more educated decision on which server to choose? It wouldn't require exact numbers, just some relative information - for example, many realms are listed as full, but does Herod have 3 times the number of the next full server? It would be great to have some information on "how full is full" compared to the other servers.

Same reason people love Illidan, they want to be on the biggest, most competitive server. The one where you get Youtube videos showcasing BGs and big wPvP events.

As far as not having people to play with: Don’t worry. There will be tons of people to play with on Classic. Retail doesn’t really require a group effort for most things. Classic makes it necessary to group up and find people to work together with. It’s a much more social environment.

Well, it is called \*rested\*.

bottom line with no crap, its a good game. you can play casual, you can play hardcore, PvE, PvP, RP whatever you like. it has definitely stood the test of time. just personal opinion but classic wow is better than any of the other MMOs on the market.
---
There's a big difference between losing to five people and losing to one person.

How much has the Character Reservation shifted your expectations or realisations of the amount of people we may expect on the WoW Classic Launch?
---
They're never going to be able to incentivize getting people off their original server. Most will sit on their hands and go "I'm not moving, YOU go to the other server."
---
No, they said they want to remove layering before phase 2 completly . :)

Now that Classic is about to release; would bringing us a Classic TBC in the future be easier since most of TBC has been untouched in modern WoW world? From a business standpoint it would seem that TBC is the logical answer to "what comes next?: considering that it would not involve additional Art or Assets vs a Classic+.(I personally want TBC, and sadly its because I don't trust anyone involved with WoD-BFA to not add in daily's and other time gating content)Thank you for Claissic!!!!

That's not how layering works, though. It's not a situation where people have to leave to let others in. It's more centered around load balancing and a bottleneck on the login server, if I recall the official explanation. Either way, hope we find out in the AMA.

Could you please speak on issues regarding combat interactions, especially where range is a factor?
---
I've heard many complaints about how Mages' Cone of Cold spell seems to be surprisingly unreliable at connecting with enemies, for example. Other frequently voiced concerns are spell batching timings that might be too generous (e.g. 2 Mages polymorphing eachother), as well as the "leeway" mechanic which feels more like artificial lag interfering with the otherwise responsive gameplay, less like an integral part of the game.
---
As a day one player from 2005, I do remember melees often having a weirdly dynamic melee range in PvP, however, I always attributed this to my bad internet connection and never considered it to be part of the game, especially since it works so unreliably. Responsive, clean combat is one of WoW's hallmarks and I think leeway should therefore be toned down as much as possible. Please give us your thoughts on these matters.

Better than nothing and if you're getting a second piece, adding a 3rd might not be that bad with the extra 10ap. I'm not saying the 3 piece is BiS either. Just pointing out bonuses and options.

Has the reception of Classic altered how Blizzard approaches MMOs? The genre never seemed to reach the potential it demonstrated in the early 2000s, and Classic clearly has some appeal that modern MMOs do not. Do you think there could be a closer imitation of Classic design philosophy in retail or other MMOs, or additional Classic content, to meet this demand?
---

The price will probably be pretty stagnant. Imagine 50k players, 10% are lvl 60 by this point (5k players) out of those 5k players atleast 50% will be Rogues / Fury Warriors / memey ret palas / memey feral druid dps etc. thats 2500 people needing gloves and legs. Thats 22 Devilsaur Leathers for 1 set x 2.5k people = 55.000 Leathers .

obviously this was a slightly exaggerated hypothetical, but also keep in mind that the people farming these leathers first are gonna be the most hardcore raiders, and theyre gonna farm them for their whole raid roster first before putting them on the AH for monies giving a few more players the time to reach 60 and farm themselves.
---
experienced this myself while raiding elwynn forest with the guild
---
Unfortunately wowwiki is not 100% accurate so unless if you have footage of a group killing the mobs and showing exp(shouldn't be hard..) in vanilla then you're wasting your breath.
---
Mostly for the software engineers. Looking back at legacy code can be daunting. Did any of you run into code you wrote all those years ago?
---
Thanks! &lt;3
---
Are there any plans to move beyond Classic and into TBC? If so, would TBC servers be separate to keep Classic Pre-BC? What are your thoughts on new TBC servers vs changing current servers to TBC?
---
Warriors can use Staffs too 
---
I feel personally attacked.
---
Druid, Mage, Warlock and priest get priority. 
---
Then any other class.

Told my wife and my friends that i am officially dead as of Monday @ 3pm and that if they want time with me in the next 3 weeks that they better get it this weekend lol
---
This is my only question : 
---
***How many accounts reserved names on Classic realms, worldwide? Or at least on NA and EU, if worldwide data is not available.***
---
Agree
---
Is there any chance we might see an updated player model toggle either as a (default off) option in the system options, or even as an API/LUA/Script command? Honestly, even a .cfg file option in the game files to manually tell the Classic client to pull available updated models from a BfA client installed in the same wow root folder; or a manually downloaded and applied officially-sourced patch that swaps out the models would be so, so appreciated.
---
I (and I'm sure many others) enjoyed Classic's systems, RPG mechanics, playstyle, immersion, community, content etc. But do not miss triangle wedges for fingers, square mouths and pupils, and many hairstyles that are only a handful of jagged polygons. It would be really nice to be able to set this option and enjoy Classic's great game design in higher definition. Especially since the only other way to go about this is relying on EULA-breaking 3rd party patches that put in the updated models, or even more EULA-breaking 3rd party programs that actively modify game data.
---
I don't want to ruin or change anyone's Classic experience who wants to play with the original look, and that look should remain default. But it would be very nice to have the option someplace for people that want that purely visual, personal change to the higher polygon character models. Especially since many of the other graphical options (view distance, shadows, water, ground clutter density/movement, etc.) do have the choice to use updated graphics.
---
Stuff like this is in muscle memory for me. Once there with a keyboard I know where to go. But if you ask me now I might mess it up. Same with BRD and wailing caverns with all their secrets.

Would be better with the old skeletons :(

I'd love a whole new mmo. I'm with you on getting back to fundamentals. One of my huge gripes with retail wow is Transmog, it takes all of the sense of accomplishment away from what you're wearing they have no creativity in the armor sets. I'd like to see some form of it with shading if you earned it during the time period it was relevant it is one shade but after it changes. I miss the sense of pride or random whispers I'd get from people admiring my gear.
---
Clearly. ;)

That's the next purchase, the crappy tv will do for a couple days lol. Also is 144hz really worth it if I'm not going deeper than Wow and CsGo?
---
When launch hits, if we are currently logged in, will we be able to enter the world without reloading? As of now the button is greyed out, if we are sitting on our character screen will it turn red and let us in?

I recently finished John Staat's WoW Diary development book (I wholeheartedly recommend it) which walks through the creation of vanilla WoW. Its development surprised me in a couple of ways (debate of fantasy v. scifi, no horde/alliance at the start, no version control for source, difficulty of tool production, 2 years of crunch time). 
---
I was curious what interesting technical difficulties you all ran into while porting tools and systems and recreating the client/server. Were you able to use a modern version of wowedit? How much could be extracted vs. reproduced? Did you have to reimplement any bugs to maintain similarities? What were some of the greatest technical challenges?
---
Or any other fun development stories among the team.
---
No just no...
---
Horde - EU Firemaw. PVP/PVE casual guild for casual leveling and perhaps later on some serious PVE. Gonna roll mage and a friend will be rolling a hunter. Many great bantz we bring.
---
ce
---
You could easily do without the snobby attitude.
---
on PvP servers, Rogues have to rush a less than warriors :^ )
---
Didn't you get a month free with expansions?
---
He won't have to change battletag. He needs to add a US starter account to his bnet (You can have up to 8 WoWs on 1 bnet, a mix of US and EU if you please)
---
Then download the US client ....And he also needs to buy his sub from the US online store. As someone from the UK playing on US servers for many years, Blizzard directs you to the EU site/stores any chance they get but you just change the URL and carry on as normal. Never had an issue.
---
The only difference I have ever noticed is that if your Bnet lists a non-UK address, on retail you when you buy WoW tokens with gold you can only use them for game time and no bnet balance. However, if you sign up with a US address even if you're not from there you can convert to balance like normal.
---
Vanilla was great, but it was really only just the beginning in my opinion and the opinion of many. Sure, some of the decisions that came later weren't great ones, but they didn't really start hurting the experience until cata. I think a lot of us want to relive those first 3 expansions, the glory days of WoW.
---
I would say objectively vanilla was not the best version of WoW, sub count was way higher in BC and WotLK
---
you must be new here, welcome to the sub
---
This is a nice psychological effect called semantic satiation.

I have no idea about raiding. I don't like it in retail, but I'm not opposed to it. In fact, I'm happier grinding mats and being in the background than raiding for top dps.  Which leads me to: classes

Druid - bears are best

What will classic look like after 18 months and players have full cleared Naxx.
---
A lot of players have differing opinions from how Blizzard will be handling this, what route are you likely to take?
---
Lock probably is the best. 2% crit is great. And no feral druid would tank with this, there's much much better options. And no resto druid is tanking a Naxx run. 
---
That said if you're GM or Officer and you're a druid, and you've been instrumental in your guild's success since day 1, then you're just as likely to get this as any other caster.
---
In the end, it'll go to whoever is most worthy regardless of class, I highly HIGHLY doubt min-max will ever be taken into consideration, since you're literally already farming Naxx.
---
Supply &amp; Demand.
---
Just because "you" don't like it, that doesn't mean it shouldn't exist, simply do not participate.
---
It wouldn’t be that overpowered if you make it so it has to be preemptively cast and maybe only lasts as a buff for like 2 seconds or so.
---
Ranks aren't in until phase 2 - blizzard is betting on population to be a fraction of what it is in launch day when phase 2 comes around.

---
honestly not far. Soon after i started that person stopped playing with me so i've just been solo leveling. I haven't played consistently in a long time since then. The last time i played was that free weekend that happend some months ago so my character has only just broken level 60, and frankly i have no idea what im doing. At some point i made it  a goal to get at least one full set of armor and im still trying to figure out how to do that.
---
Its % based off population, similar to arena titles
---
Nice, I'm doing similar
---
Couldn't you in theory do this with every raid boss too? Hearth before luci dies, hearth before mag dies etc.?
---
You weren't worried about queue times until you realized queue times require waiting?
---
Great insightful question for the development team.
---
Would like to know this as well.
---
Seeing how smooth the whole classic open beta was with actions/spells etc i feel that the try from blizzard on adding spell-batching has made the game feel alot more sluggish and laggy. So my question: Since you/blizzard cant get spell-batching working for only spells in pvp etc and not with loot and all else. Do you intend to remove the "introduced" spell-batching and make everything play out smooth or are you gonna try to make it work like it did in vanilla again ?
---
I'd say it's more required for warlocks than a mage for example, simply because we lack mobility. Having extra CC effects on demand is a godsend against melee which are our biggest threats.
---
While multi-boxing was present in classic although minuscule with the re-release of classic on the 27th there will be a huge increase in multi-boxers. This has already witnessed on the stress test and through content creators such as Swifty who will be multi-boxing come release. While multiboxing was possible in classic it wasn't as prominent  and i was wondering if there would be any restrictions put on multi-boxing to help prevent the market from being manipulated by a single individual,providing them an unfair advantage in pvp or world events such as the opening of Ahn'Qiraj gates. Thanks
---
My only lament of WoW Classic is that many classes only have 1 viable role in endgame, especially in the case of hybrids.
---
I understand that the stage has been set through Phase 6, but after that do you see a potential for class balance and changes, in order to give more talent trees increased functionality and impactful purpose?
---
I don't think your math checks out either
---
That's my concern, right on
---
https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/22990080/mark-your-calendars-wow-classic-launch-and-testing-schedule
---
What are your plans past phase 6? nothing? extra content? BC servers?  
---
And are we gonna have an armory for classic?
---
FFXIV is honestly the best MMO’s I’ve ever played and does a ton of things great that a modern MMO should. 
---
I’m willing to sacrifice all of that because I simply love the WoW universe so much more.
---
You're replying to his comment lol, you don't need to quote the entire thing
---
Their explanation is that only a minority will obtain the rank that fast and it wont impact that much. On a certain 15k pop server. Only 1k were semi active. Only 350 pushed 300k honor a week with BGs out.
---
If you need another data point for your social experiment, I would still kill you if I saw that
---
I'll never win a good mage, not even in my dreams but i had to pick random mages for the clips else the video is going to be full of lost duels, no point.
---
Having played since vanilla I do not want them to add content. That isn't vanilla and it isn't what vanilla players want. Classic players that don't care about classic, the ones that never played vanilla and just want something "new" for the sake of not being bored, yeah those guys probably want additional content and story added. I dont. Vanilla players dont.
---
I liked the movie and a show would be fun too, I just wished I saw more races and cool places than just the orcs and humans... I was kinda confused on the half orc chick or whatever which was my only problem lol

Is there something like this for a Warlock? That’d be great! Need to set some goals.

I thought that wrapped gifts were RNG based. So I used to buy a bunch of them from trade at like 1g a piece xDDD

This is what I wish I did. 16-years-old, 2005, deadset on going Horde. Find out playing group I was planning to play with was going Alliance. They weren't even my friends, they were friends of my sister's boyfriend, I didn't even know them.
---
I thought about going Horde anyway. But I buckled and went Alliance. 
---
I wish I went Horde. Now I'm too attached to Alliance (moreso their cities, to be honest...).
---
My message to you: Go with what feels right. You can make new friends.
---
Sadly yes it will.
---
Hello!
---
My high school friends and I are "getting the gang back together" for Classic and have been discussing the phases of content that could potentially follow all that encompasses the "Classic experience."
---
Is your team considering offering a "Classic Eternal" option where we could in some way play on a server, or transfer to a server that stops before Burning Crusade if the player base is healthy enough?
---
We really want to be able to experience all the raids, gather all the tier sets, and potentially do this with more than one class at a pace that's feasible for our adult lives filled with adult obligations.
---
Thank you so much for bringing classic back. I hope you all are as hyped as we are.
---
All you’re doing is providing negating examples of why my argument is bad, rather than pointing out a reason vanilla was better the BC or WotLK
---
The community has speculated on the longevity of Classic WoW and where we'll be a few years down the road. We've asked about Vanilla progressing to TBC or possibly new content being introduced ala Old School Runescape. Are there any other options that the Classic team is kicking around beyond these two? I don't expect that a final decision has been made but I'm curious what other options may be on the table that you're willing to discuss.
---
Great question! I remember running dungeons with 5-10 people.
---
Phasing content makes a lot of sense, but i think a lot of players are wondering if phase 2 is in 1 year or in 2 months.  
---
i understand the urge to avoid any concrete information and wait for more information, but i don't think it is unreasonable to ask for a ballpark guesstimate.  
---
Otherwise you will have players rush to wait for new content and others who won't even reach 60 before phase 2 (neither of which is ideal for the playerbase sustain)
---
Mages, Warlocks, and Druids can all create some kind of teleport effects already, so clearly Priest has priority 
---
/S
---
No changes. Adding content would lead us to what we have in retail. Also, classic is meant to be a museum piece, as stated by ion. 
---
No to a bastardized version of classic wow.
---
And if 75% say yes to lfr?
---
WoW Vanilla was great, in part because of the freedom players had (in both PVP and PVE servers) to grief, gank, camp and generally annoy each other in the open world of Azeroth. 
---
Will GMs be more strict in Classic WoW when it comes to players' complaints regarding this behaviour, or will the experience of playing Classic more closely mimic what we experienced in Vanilla? Also, have any changes been implemented in this regard for Classic that weren't there during Vanilla (I.e., dealing with complaints of verbal and non-verbal confrontations between players)?
---
Hello.
---
Very excited to play WoW Classic!
---
I have one concern however and that is about layering and economy.
---
I understand the plan with layering to be removed before phase two to smooth out the "re-launch" of Classic, to not repeat history. I'm all for that so that more people can discover and enjoy Classic. It's a win-win in that regard.
---
However what I'm worried about is the potential to abuse the system for the few people that will speedlevel to 60 and then mass-skin in Un'Goro for example so they can get a good grip on the servers early economy. Since they can layerhop to maximise farm and get enough gold to never needing to farm again, within two weeks maybe.
---
Has there been any internal discussions about the potential abuse-tactics for layering at max-level and the implications it could have on realm economy for the whole lifetime of Classic servers. Don't wanna have Illidan screaming at our necks that we weren't prepared :)
---
Greetings,
---
Alexander
---
Taylor Swift used to post on 4chan
---
Absolutely
---
Oh but it do my dude.
---
So, probably the most talked about subject layering. Is this permanent, or temporary and any eta how long? I'm not a tech genius but I'm going to take a guess and say the servers can handle more players than they did back in 06-07, so I'm just excited for the possibility to not only play with more people but have them all in just 1 "layer" of the game.
---
Sword rogues smh
---
Hi team! I had a question about Hunters and how they are known to scale very poorly in the end game. How do you feel about such class design ”issues” and would you want to see such things fixed or is this a #nochanges things that Hunter players have to live with?
---
Doesn't really matter a good mage will always win, those mages aren't the best :P
---
This will have serious implications on wpvp, especially in P1. Looking forward to a clarification. 
---
My memory from vanilla was that the guards were utterly useless in protecting anything but the main cities, memory corrupt?
---
Still have mine on my priest on live
---
I’m wondering more about World first. Wonder if any websites will be tracking since there is a few competitors.  Interested in if Athene mob tags/clever use of game mechanics to 60, how staysafe/Quinn will do etc
---
That's all based on a tweet by Ion:https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/1121853269033328641
---
which is quite vague, especially when considering the complex changes to the MC loot tables over vanilla.
---
That'd be killer
---
This is a really good question.
---
is there a site that has this same info for other classes?
---
Lifehack: get goblin engineering and you can rez with jumper cables.
---
Cheers, same to you.
---
You're uhm... gonna do this for warlock too, right?
---
What are the current implementation plans for cross-realm Battlegrounds? Specifically, my question is whether time-zone specific battlegroups are being planned, or if an entire region (i.e. NA) will be cross connected through the battleground system? 
---
I realize this is multiple phases away from implementation, and subject to change, but I was curious where plans were from your current phase of planning. 
---
Yes that has been my argument with people that the world itself was not designed to support that many players. I am trying to bury my head in the sand if I am honest about it or I would not play :)
---
I hope they answer this
---
My guild has a large number of players so far. We all decided, in order to stay away from streamers, we would be on Herod. With all of the panic about overpopulation now we are worried that we won't actually be able to play on launch week. We do not want to move servers.  
---
What are you doing to make sure the launch is smooth even for people like us on Herod?
---
Bro as someone with 2500+ hours in cs, please get a 144hz monitor. Its fucking night and day difference.
---
The problem with the Cadaverous set is that it's so incredibly rare. Devilsaur pushes the gloves and belt right out of consideration, the belt is nice, but the boots are middling at best.
---
Getting three specific pieces of an incredibly rare set for 10 AP is not really what I'd call exploring options. There are other three item combos with better stats and much better drop rates.
---
I'd believe it. My three hour estimate was a little on the conservative side. Idk how afk-logging is going to work/be dealt with on these classic servers.
---
Where is Mankrik's wife?
---
Can I add a bit? Do everything you can to immediately train scorch at level 1. Sell your dagger, etc to get the 10 copper so that you can tag mobs easier in the starting zone.
---
Hello, first off thank you for bringing us Classic, it's probably the only game I need to play for the rest of my life.
---
Now onto my question, in regards to layering, on a faction imbalanced server, will the lower pop faction be spread out across all the layers on that server, or will they fill up layer by layer?
---
If you don't have engineering you're doing it wrong. If that is okay with you then what exactly do you want us to say that could decide for you?
---
A group of people will invite you to their group of people, guaranteed.
---
 Probably won't be a group of minmaxing nolifers. Are you okay with that?
---
Would there be a possibility of updating druids, pallys, and essentially any 'nonviable'spec' to a state somewhat similar to that in TBC if there was classic+? it'd be nice to main tank as a Druid or pally
---
1. Has spell batching been fixed for gathering professions ? Previously on beta and stress test multiple people can gather a single object and everyone receives loot.
---
Slare has no place to live atm and might miss launch, can you pay for his hotel for a week?
---
Thank you for taking the time to rerelease an important part of gaming history.
---
If successful, can we expect TBC servers? 
---
*and*
---
If there are TBC servers, would you allow something like a free one-time server transfer to the TBC servers, or would plays need to start from level 1?
---
Beautiful.
---
It really borrows from a lot of fantasy tropes, but that’s not a bad thing. I love how the zones are all different from each other and fantastical in nature, but it’s still *believable*. 
---
I think it’s also kind of funny that you mention how the expansions started getting too extreme and showboaty, but mention BC and Cata, skipping Wrath. Because IMO, Northrens is a perfect spiritual successor to EK and Kalimdor. The zones are all believable, yet interesting. Icecrown and Storm Peaks perhaps go a bit over the top, but aside from that, it feels like it belongs in Azeroth. And yeah, then Cata came and just made every zone a theme park with whacky hi-jinks and spooky scary bad guise.
---
They WERE learning the encounter back then. There weren't kill videos or guides like there are in the dozens now.
---
Exactly, we'll know all this stuff in only a week.
---
Someone doesn't like Skittles
---
Thanks! That's exactly what I'm looking for. I guess you make a valid point. The super casual guilds don't care about recruiting right away. I should have figured that out myself.
---
Thanks again.
---
Do you have plans for adding more servers if a lot of players will join the last day before Classic launch?
---
I really hope if the success is there that you guys will continue this "classic" series til at least Lich King. Are there any thoughts on that?
---
Hey. What is your plan if servers stay overpopulated for long periods of time? I think we can agree that 25k+ queue or an hour queue every day is bad for the game and server. Do you plan on offering free transfers or whats the game plan if that happens? Thanks.
---
Get a dance mat
---
Spell bactching seems to be causing problems with aoe abilities such as people being able to run over hunters traps and it not going off or running through mages blizzard spell and not getting hit or slowed by it and many more aoe abilities.. are there any thoughts about lowering the spell batching delay or another way to fix these issues?
---
Super!
---
Chat channels are case sensitive, we will end up with both "world" and "World".
---
plus green lens of healing, phase 2 prebis.
---
Good question. I will look into the process for doing that. I think they have some sort of approval system you have to go through. So no guarantees.
---
I fucking love this. Grinning from ear to ear!!
---
I'm sorry, but this is complete nonsense. WoW wiki certainly does not use private server information. https://wow.gamepedia.com/index.php?title=Mob_experience&amp;oldid=557499
---
This is from 23rd March 2007, the formula is exactly the same as in the other link i provided. Granted, it's about 2 months after TBC release, but the experience formula was not changed in any of the patches between original Classic and this date.
---
can we get actually numbers on current server populations?
---
What is the: 
---
Population (logged in characters) that will fit in one server, before queues kick in
---
Population (logged in characters) that will fit in one layer
---
Population (accounts with created characters) in a realm marked "full"
---
Population (accounts with created characters) in a realm marked "high"
---
Population (accounts with created characters) in a realm marked "medium"
---
Niiiceeeeee
---
&gt; that shit was hella rigged.
---
+1
---
Will you be doing any class/talent balancing at any point?
---
&gt; And that's ignoring the time to make the Arcanite bars
---
Except you can speed this up by using multiple characters as well as buying from AH if needed.
---
&gt;or the infinitesimally small chance of seeing 9 Sulfuron Ingots in 12 weeks
---
Read above. They are not BOP and hence can be sped up by farming/alt raiding/buying.
---
&gt;Those materials can be purchased on the AH if the player going for HoR or Thunderfury spends all their spare time farming gold.
---
The player going for HOR/TF will not be buying mats. The guild will be. At least any guild worth their salt will help.
---
Do you have a source for the world buffs not being intended to be used in raids?
---
I dig the peanuts desk
---
I agree with this. It would be nice to have an option to play on the classic or WoD character models. Private servers have this option.
---
Will we get to have our Plague Inc. minigame with the Corrupted Blood again?
---
Troll regenerates 5hp per second and there's NOTHING anyone can do about it.
---
Troll is your answer.
---
Really curious to know devs toughts on this. That would require some very fundamental changes on wow, to allow more content to be add complementing old stuff instead of replacing it every "expansion".
---
This is incorrect. Daggers would work better with a duo that could hold threat on the mobs. The reason daggers are bad for leveling is because of backstab. Mobs will be facing you 90% of the time so combat is just better since it's front end damage comes from sinister strike whereas daggers it's from backstab.
---
149 hours to go. Release it early? please?
---
Is there anything in the plans to combat the right click mass report exploit?
---
A lot of streamers readily reported players when they got ganked even when it didn't warrant it, for playing the game properly. On current retail, mass reports mute a player and automatically disconnects them. This is a serious problem for raiding guilds competing for server kills and pvp.
---
Haste was incredibly rare and only a few actual buffs/enchants provided it (even then, 1% or 3% at most for enchants)
---
I have no idea wth mastery is.
---
Do you have a contingency plan to deal with a larger-than-expected population?  Suppose as many people create characters in the 24 hours before launch as have done so already -- how quickly will you be able to add new servers?
---
Foot peddles with ctrl and alt modifiers!
---
LEL yes

---
It's not that it was only possible to have one rank 14, it was percentage based and the majority of servers only had one person in the top .1%. Essentially, there was only 1 player per thousand, per faction, per server of active pvp players. 
---
If the same percentages of players are active as they were in vanilla, having a higher population server won't have any impact on how hard/easy it is to gain the pvp ranks.
---
I think you need to say things out loud before you hit enter.
---
What has it been like working on a project that touches so many people and has effected their lives for over a decade now? Have you felt nervous of letting the fans down, or intimidated by the unforgiving critics? Have you felt inspired by peoples passion? 
---
Also thank you for making this happen.
---
It feels like a lot of vanilla wow content was left unfinished when BC got announced. Very little came with grinding Ravenholdt reputation as a rogue, not every class got an epic quest, Karazhan's basement and Hyjal are there but empty.
---
If Karazhan was a new 20 man post Naxx it should probably drop gear ilvl equivalent to MC/BWL but also offer something else other than gear like ZG giving shoulder enchants and AQ20 giving skill books. So long as new content don't invalidate old content entirely, I think it would respect classic's design philosophy.
---
Do you like the idea of fleshing out the content of classic post phase 6?
---
The armory app during WoD was REALLY awesome. I really thoroughly appreciated being able to do some auction house stuff and keep my garrison table rolling while I was travelling etc. I totally understand why they took it out because of the botters etc., but man, I wish it hadn't been so widely abused.
---
Appreciate it man thanks a lot
---
What about the short lived feeling of hope when a party members goblin jumper cables light up on only to be shattered when they fail.
---
Don't worry  
---
Roses really smell like poooOOooop
---
You must be a troll with that voodoo magic
---
Armory wasn't around during vanilla, and having it impacts gameplay.  They have explicitly stated that they will not have one for Classic for this reason.
---
That's part of the Classic Experience™ though...
---
Which is wrong. "a Medium realm today already has more characters on it than even the most crowded realms did back in 2006."
---
Have you contemplated opening world of Warcraft to the world for free on August 25th / 26th (or even a few days before) to gain insight to demand that has been off the radar? (people that are new to the franchise or refused to sub for a name reservation).
---
It seems that there's a missing puzzle piece to demand that could critically hinder launch.
---
Classic shadow is nothing like retail shadow. Your spec can easily be replaced by a holy priest who puts 20 points in shadow. Spriests do the lowest dps, and have massive mana issues.  Why bring a spriest when you can bring literally anything else. 
---
But you should still play whatever you want because it’s your 15$/month.
---
Were there aspects of the Classic WoW (in 2004-6) gameplay meta that you guys as developers totally anticipated, or even planned? I'm wondering mostly about what certain of us call "meme-specs" or off-specs; did you launch the game knowing full-well that certain specs (shadow priest, ret paladin) wouldn't be performing nearly as well as some of their DPS peers, at least in early raids with weaker gear? What I love deeply about classic wow is the sense of class-spec identity and uniqueness. I would take that feeling over "everyone tops meters and all specs are viable for all content" any day.
---
As a corollary: what are your guys' favorite specs in the game? Based on lore, gameplay mechanics, role, whatever. 
---
thank you!
---
What's the max population on each realm? Back in vanilla, I think it was 2.5-3k? I think.
---
It’s because they are releasing them unannounced and people payed money to reserve names. It’s hard to move a network of people who will not get the names they paid to reserve on the new server. Especially when you do not give them any notice ahead of time to coordinate the move of an entire friend group or guild
---
Godspeed!
---
My questions are at the end of this:
---
In terms of new content, post the 6 phases, I would like to see you continue with expansions but keep the vanilla experience alive. With some thought going toward remembering that QOL is very different than "easy mode"
---
-What are your thoughts on keeping a certain degree of challenge in "everyday" levelling? Today's retail version of wow isn't much of a challenge for anyone and beyond collecting things has lost its attractiveness.
---
-What are your thoughts on class balancing long term? More specifically, will you aim to make all classes viable when solo fighting each other or will the emphasis remain on team efforts where different classes are NEEDED to accomplish goals?
---
Would you consider an "alternate reality" post 1.0 - 1.6? (differentiating the storyline from retail). 
---
Thanks very much. I can't wait for Classic
---
I'm sorry but this is a stupid question. Mouseover macros exist, as do addons like clique or luna that let you bind specific mouse clicks to abilities such as decurse/dispel etc...  
---
If guilds have issue with dispelling, it's because people are lazy/selfish or are just bad at the game. It's not hard.
---
So close to be finally home, but 
---
I feel like you massively underestimate the number of people who did not subscribe for the name reservation. I would really not like to choose couple days into Classic to continue on the current realm with 10k+ queues or reroll to newly opened realm. Feels like the way you open servers are also separating the community somewhat.
---
Do you expect discrepancy on realms opened early vs opened after/closer to release in terms of how much people leave after the first wave of the hype fades? Do you think the conservative realm numbers to avoid future server merges at all costs worth risking a smooth launch? A lot of games are doomed on launch nowadays if they are buggy, unoptimized or anything crippling the first impression.
---
Carpe Diem!  Labor durus solverit!
---
But there will be only 1 auction house for all 3 layers.
---
I’m so shocked there’s such a majority with entrenched vocal opinions that nothing should ever change and classic needs to be a time capsule. In my opinions it was only obvious that classic would work like progression servers in Everquest, but it seems no one in the world but me wants that.
---
I'm hoping something like region wide - considering PVP realms tend to be Horde heavy and PVE realms Alliance heavy, region wide would probably be the best to even out the queue times.
---
That and mobs will be facing you pretty much all the time. You can gouge and stuff to backstab but combat just makes it way smoother not needing to worry about getting behind mobs.
---
Is there any chance of rated battle grounds or arenas in a future phase?
---
Seeing as how there was a number of bugs found during the Beta and stress tests, have you resolved them all (that you knew of), such that there are no (or extremely little) bugs remaining on launch, or will it be more of a continuous effort after the launch too to fix the bugs (meaning all currently known ones haven't been resolved yet)?
---
Will the quest hubs at Thorium Point, Revantusk Village, and Cenarion Hold be available at launch?
---
Can you give us some ideas you have been spit balling in meetings to determine when the next phase is ready to launch?  We have asked many times when you will update us on the new phases hitting classic, but we just hear that you will do it when the community is ready.  
---
Are you able to implement phases at different times for different servers?   Are you planning on staggering different phases by each region of players?  Does all of wow classic have to be on the same phase at the same time, from a server that no one has killed Golemagg, to a server in an entire different region where 20+ guilds speed clear MC in under 2 hrs each Tuesday night before going to WPVP to kill time?
---
:P i was only joking, i upvoted you before i posted that, so HA.
---
Blue posts have already answered this. It's a form of real money trading and not officially allowed.
---
Howdy, how long will you guys incorporate sharding in classic? Will you re-activate it during the opening of the gates event too? Thanks andcan't wait to play classic!
---
You're talking about extreme examples that are generally players massively distorting models from the back end.
---
Any chance dedicated Latin America servers will be added before launch?
---
Is there any consideration being given to the idea to make some minor balancing adjustments to certain specs that are major underperformers? I don't believe that every spec should be optimal or even viable in all aspects of the game, but I would be interested in seeing each spec having at least some niche where it can do well. For example I know boomkin is largely considered useless across the board. Any chance a spec like that could see a tweak to make it viable in at least one of pvp, dungeons, or raids?
---
Seeing lots of skeletons isn't proof that one character can have two skeletons in the world simultaneously. It could just be lots of people dying
---
What is my best bet on logging in on launch day without a que? Should I log in as soon as they go live? Should I log in 25minutes beforehand and hit enter world at the character select screen as soon as they go live? Should I log in 2 hours early?
---
Because the majority of players is what ActiBlizz catered to when they introduced LFR/leveling boosts/obamacare epics. The same majority that loved the spoon-feeding now has turned around and has eyes on classic because "retail is too easy and unrewarding". I would support a seperate dev team that focuses on introducing classic+ that isn't under papa Activison's boot to provide "player-engagement" before I support player voting.
---
I think there literally is a toggle but I'm not sure.
---
I'm fortunate enough to have a physically intensive job in the oilfield so the constant activity helps alittle, but my head is nowhere near this rig lately. Especially this week! My uselessness begins at home where I should be a productive and responsible boyfriend and help cook, clean and perform other chores. Not sure launch day is going to make that any better though..
---
Well that wouldn’t just be your opinion. The sub count literally peaked in WotLK, so that’s the concensus. Well, it technically peaked like one week after Cata launch, but that was just because Wrath was doing so well already, and expansions always bring a quick burst of subs. 
---
I really hope we get the Classic Trilogy. I could see myself subbing for 10 years straight, just like from 2005.
---
I've seen various community suggestions for what should be done once classic has 'caught up' (phase 6 has been out for a while)- "Classic+" with new (community approved/voted on?) content, Burning Crusade classic (and so on), 'seasonal' classic servers, and of course just leaving it as-is.
---
While I'm sure it's too soon to have/say your thoughts on what your plans *are*, are any of the more well-known ideas for the future of classic already out of the question to you and/or do you have thoughts on them you can share?
---
This is one of the reasons I left Herod
---
Hardmode
---
plz answer this
---
If you could "Classic-ify" any newer zone, raid, or content and throw them into Classic, what would you chose? Note: Please don't do this, though. :P
---
Classic WoW is missing the authentic "moonwalking" movement of vanilla, seen here: www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlF1jfknro8
---
The Classic stress test also had some weird leftover BFA character movements when you were targeting someone while running, seen here: https://i.gyazo.com/b41b6de2e4095674a3f3a92f580d83c6.mp4
---
If someone finds any exploits / economy breaking mechanics that were present in classic. Will you keep them because #nochanges or are you ok to adjust things?
---
I.E. Tribute runs, there might be more extreme examples people discover.
---
The flight path logout wasn't a bug, but an add-in in later expansions, no? I don't remember this working ever in vanilla...
---
Big true
---
Ye it's wacky
---
1. v1.12 honor system allowed more people in the higher ranks (Rank 12+) and less people in the lower ranks to enable players to finish their grinds before 2.0 and the new system hit. 
---
**Q: Since most mechanics are 1.12-based, which honor system can we expect? 1.12 or pre-1.12?**
---
2. In Vanilla WoW, Naxxramas was endgame content for ca. 6 months, before TBC started phasing out that gear, which was clearly intended to easy the transition and is quite overpowered for most of WoW Classic. On long-running servers, players will be full T3 before gaining meaningful PvP ranks.
---
**Q: Are there plans to adapt the honor system formulas again to align PvE and PvP gear progression once Naxx has been endgame content for a longer time than in the original game?**
---
3. **Q: Are all realms of each region going to be in the same BG pool?**
---
&gt; It will be a whine fest and businessman in suits will drop the orders to make the people happy and before you know it were back to dungeon finder and other BS. 
---
Nah...
---
Hunters solo farming DM:T causes huge inflation and some private servers prevented this by making changes to the end boss. Will soloing DM:T be possible in classic?
---
What internal assurances can you provide about the guarantee of layering removal before Phase 2? Have there been any engineering challenges or processes you have needed to follow to accommodate for it?
---
The only disadvantage of not taking engineering in pvp is when you're fighting against someone who both has engineering, and wants to waste the gold to kill you.
---
It's really not that big of a deal, and in the end, it doesn't really matter that much.
---
First, thanks so much for this wonderful world you’ve created! Second, what’s the current thoughts on what will happen after phase six?
---
I didn’t learn about talent points until level 33 or so... yea then I went arcane.
---
To add on to this..TSM just recently announced classic support. This is definitely an addon that should be banned as the classic economy will suffer from this addon.
---
If you wanted to optimize them, I'd be happy to update the list with your corrections. I am decidedly not a programmer!
---
Get this guy to the top!
---
I hope it doesn’t translate to raids :/ MC is easy enough as is on private servers.
---
Each item is probably BiS itself even if the 7% +hit here is not strictly necessary. However, literally nobody will get all of those items in phase 1 before raiding in MC is viable. Now I'm sure someone will get it all but what I mean is that MC raids are viable very quickly and phase 1 BiS isn't worth farming for very long considering the epic upgrades you will get when you raid.
---
When calculating server population, especially for servers considered 'full', are you accounting for people who have reserved names on multiple servers?
---
Do you have any way of extrapolating which accounts can be expected to actually play on that server come launch day, vs character reservations that are being held as backup or for sale?
---
In your opinion, what's the worst or most painful aspect of classic that you kept or specifically re-introduced to the engine for sake of 'no changes'?
---
For a player with average knowledge of the game it takes 250 hours to hit level 60.
---
So if you lose all of your items and half your levels no one would do it, even if they were the last person on a dead server, at that point I would just remake a new character.
---
My friend was a warrior and I was a paladin in late vanilla when we started. He hit 20 about an hour pr so before me and learned duel wield. I hit 20 and quickly became depressed that I couldnt duel wield cool 1 handed weapons like cruel barb.
---
I was shocked when I whispered a lvl 60 asking what lvl paladin got to duel wield and when he told me never I almost re rolled on the spot.
---
Is trading gold between classic and retail allowed?
---
Classic seems to be having an overwhelmingly positive reception. The amount of people I know returning for it far exceeds any other WoW expansion.   
---
Does it seem likely that the retail team will take any inspiration from classic for the upcoming expansion?
---
yis
---
The first time I finally made it to Darnassus as a nightelf, just running through the city in awe. Some high level came up to me and gave me 1gp. I was fucking rich, immediately went and spent it all on grey leather armor.
---
Are you as excited as we are and are you surprised by all the hype?
---
When the time comes to remove layering, what will be done if a server is still too populated?
---
It looks very similar to Pitbull Imo.
---
The demand doesn't increase with supply.  Demand will maybe be slightly variable depending on the price of the leather, but the supply will go up which is drop the price.
---
The benefit of low waiting time outweighs that. AV still takes a long time, but at least you get quick AB and WSG matches.
---
I am in solid agreement with the idea of "Classic should be a museum piece." However, I am also not against, like so many others, of adding small things to the game over time.
---
Are there any non "gamebreaking" changes you would personally like to see come to Classic? I'm thinking more quality of life sorts of things, like bigger bags, get rid of the quiver, etc.
---
Along those same lines, I played Hunter and Priest in Classic, so I was able to enjoy some very class specific endgame stuff unlike most of my guildies. Do you think it's possible we'll ever see other Rhok/Benedication sort of items added for other classes?
---
Meh
---
guild coalitions lol?
---
ditto for visibility
---
Are realm forums coming back?
---
How will phases be?
---
What are your plans if servers such as Herod still have a massive population come Phase 2 when layering must be removed completely?
---
Can you not play casually? Or is your net really that bad? Seems a shame if you can't at least enjoy the world (even if your connection isn't good enough to PVP or Raid)
---
Yeah I think summoning stones are fine, but lfg needs to never come back.
---
Lost ZG raptor once, tiger twice. Did get Deathcharger's Reins though after about a year or so.
---
I don’t expect it being close to vanilla since I just can’t believe the server architecture hasn’t improved, and that it should be possible to virtually increase queue speed times.
---
I hope. :P
---
I Wana this one answered lol
---
It still reduces talking. It reduces interaction. It's not what Classic is about.
---
Thanks, so much easier to update if you do!
---
There are two choke points.
---
Login server to the realm and realm login. (technically 3 but blizz authentication servers are pretty fast)
---
The login server has the harsh bottleneck to reduce the effects of unintentional and intentional DDoS via either malicious means or just mass amounts of people trying to connect.
---
The character login finds you a slot on the server. Using arbitrary numbers for this queue is disingenuous because you are much more likely to get into a server with 30,000 slots than a server with 10,000 slots.
---
Eh, BC did class balance a lot better than Vanilla. The hybrid tax actually made more sense, e.g., warriors were better main tanks but paladins were really effective multi-target tanks (and actually had a taunt, lol). 
---
Plus you had a reason to actually bring a ret paladin to a raid. Definitely should have kept paladins and shamans faction specific though.
---
Atlas maps was totally what we used back in the day along with atlas loot to show loot drops.
---
You can have Museum servers, IDGAF but this "No Changes" bullshit needs to stop RIGHT NOW.
---
I don't want Retail and I also don't want to languish with a bunch of broken specializations, shitty itemization, rampant imbalance and all the other terrible things that come with Vanilla World of Warcraft.
---
#ClassicPlus
---
They also aren’t static. They learned things and they saw the result of mistakes they made in TBC and WotLK. Kevin Jordan talks about it. Flying and badge gear are some of the things specifically called out as mistakes that he wouldn’t make again. Having seen the end result of some of their design decisions, perhaps they go a different route the next time around.
---
A Mage in our guild has 2 of these bad boys. Shame there is no dual wielding.
---
So you’re saying there’s a chance!
---
Tigged ismt the right word.
---
The better and more loyal players get the better gear. Its smart. Suck up iftou want to be included
---
We're actually going Stalagg Alliance ;)
---
Will the Classic be added to the Looking Glass connectivity test page?
---
Having to lend a new R14 warrior gold in order to be able to buy all the weapons was pretty common.  When you're grinding rank, you're almost always broke
---
I guess not everyone is capable of identifying comical hubris.
---
Back in the day there were quite a lot of early WoW myths/legends, such as the breadcrumbs for what was long assumed to be the original Ashbringer quest, Talisman of Binding Shard, Hyjal, Old Ironforge to name but a few..
---
Did the team revisit any of these elements or discover anything else interesting during the rebuilding Classic process? Was there a temptation to 'complete' some of these?
---
Kevin Jordan would come back.
---
Bad math is bad.
---
Same as demon hunter doh
---
Blizzard dudes: please don't respond to this guys request. It'll only make lopsided servers more lopsided.
---
LOL that's the second time i had to do a double-take, dont know why my eyes keep setting themselves on mulgore. here's a fix. https://i.imgur.com/CIyfpkJ.jpg
---
Horde raid my friend
---
That would suck i would have begged the guild for a loan.
---
No you have non combat fluff for class fantasy. You dont mess with how the class plays just to add fluff.
---
Will there be a trial period for classic? 
---
I play WoW a long time ago, and have moved on to other mmos since. I'm excited to try out returning to WoW with the classic release, but I am honestly not sure if my memory will live up to my standards today.  I'm hoping there will be a way to test the game out before paying for the monthly
---
That depends on whether they act as mere conduits or have "storage" for power generated and transferred to them slowly over time.
---
"5 damage? that sucks"
---
Why aren't the female characters busty ?
---
Will the friends list be how it was in 2006 or will it be connected to battle.net? I really enjoyed creating a new character and being a completely new "person" in the world where nobody knew it was me and my friends didn't even know who I was. There was a level of privacy that I enjoyed and hope that will be continued here.
---
Will the additional Hinterlands and Searing Gorge quests added in patch 1.5 be available in Phase 1?
---
There is a big loss felt by the community that the AV battles from older patches (stalemate battles at choke points for hours, summoning efforts, etc) will not be able to happen with the 1.2 AV version we are getting since it’s more zerg-mode.
---
Are the rep levels to become exalted with AV factions adjusted to the current AV design?
---
Ok
---
Can you run queries against the sever data to obtain overall player statistics? If so could you make this accessable from the internet for players? The reason I'm asking is that I'm a gonna kill as many murlocs as I can and I want to know if anyone has killed more than me so I can go back and kill some more and then maybe kill some more just for fun. I have unfunushed business with those Murlocs and it's payback time.

Can Latin America and Brazil get their separate servers please? Our community is fractured by players splitting through different servers. Just one server for Latin America would be great. We don’t have to keep precedent of having a PvP server and Normal server.
---
Will you be nerfing the hunter Dire Maul north solo strategy? This provides something like 80-100 gold *per hour* and was nerfed on most private servers -- it was considered an exploit that was never made popular during the original run of Classic.
---
Yes and tanks will "LFW" in endgame dungeons. I find it pompous
---
&gt;Most people don't like it
---
Most people couldn't care less. Some extremely vocal people rage against it.
---
Q: What sort of eventual change can we expect to see over the next 1, 3, 5 years with WoW Classic? Are we jumping into a novelty, a stagnate world? Or can we expect enhancements, expansions, improvements, if so, please elaborate on details, even 'uncommitted ideas' so we can get an idea where the team's head is at.
---
You have woken up a great many of former customers, and I think we would all like to know where this is going?
---
Q: Are you planning to do any "cycles" of new servers, so that new servers will pop up in the earlier phases? Will all servers always be on the same phase?
---
Q: Do you have an idea of the total time to get from phase 1 to the last phase? I understand you can't announce unannounced content (things like "classic BC"), but I'm trying to understand whether it will be faster or near the same speed as original Vanilla.
---
"Hey guys, remember that time the night elves defeated an evil being and drove him back?  Instead of bringing the three major elves that stopped Queen Azshara, instead lets leave them completely out of her raid and story line, and instead use Jaina and Thrall to drive our narrative."

If I'm not well for classic what's even the point xD
---
how can u play with  that mousepad your dpi must be 100000
---
Currently, several realm discords have organically sprang up. While this can help the community grow and build off of itself, a few of the discords have already begun advertising for boosting and gold selling services. Will Blizzard be doing anything to combat this? I understand that Discord is outside the control of Blizzard, but I still feel this could potentially damage the brand and product if gold selling becomes rampant.
---
Takedown requests? Have you never heard of the Streisand effect? :/
---
I don’t know if that’s necessarily true. If I boost to 120, I can literally go through old content and one shot Arthas, Deathwing, and so on. Sure, I guess I did kill them... but is the praise I get really consistent with the effort?
---
Server transfers were mentioned positively quite recently, in an interview between Tipsout, Omar G., and another.
---
I haven't played in probably about 7 years or so. My wife and I both played, and we played a ton. I even used to have a WoW blog. I miss it. I know I don't have time for it these days, and I couldn't play if I wanted to, but I do wish I could just log on and see if my main was still there. 
---
I suppose if, suddenly, I had a ton of time on my hands, I might give it a go again. I made a lot of good friends playing WoW, and I found out, via Facebook, that several of them are still playing the same characters on the same server. Playing with them was the best part about it, really.
---
You know what's been really great about this launch? Being American and not having to worry about what language my server would be speaking.
---
Not being a jerk, but have you done the math? For the record, I think it would be an interesting experiment and hope they do.
---
1: What is your professional oppinion about the current trend of immediate reward mechanics compared to the hype for the brutal classic wow?
---
2: Will the new market insight creep further into future projects at blizzard?
---
3: In your professional oppinion, does commitment based reward mechanics have a future in games with no world-immersion?
---
Will pvp sets be released in phases? 
---
The blue pvp sets are different item ids, iirc the updated level 60 blue pvp set was introduced in 1.9 or 1.10. Prior to that we had a level 58 set and the epic set (which I believe was updated, which overwrote the item ID, as opposed to blue sets where there are two items a level 58 and 60)
---
In short, will we see level 58 and level 60 blue pvp sets.
---
Haha nah mate, I’m now set for Gayness. Wish you well, and hope you’re queue’s are decent. ;)
---
Okay pretty simple. You need a few things though.
---
1. A cheap mmo mouse like this you can bind your bread and butter to:  [https://www.amazon.com/UtechSmart-Precision-Programmable-Computer-Recommendation/dp/B00FNKMVUO?ref\_=fsclp\_pl\_dp\_2](https://www.amazon.com/UtechSmart-Precision-Programmable-Computer-Recommendation/dp/B00FNKMVUO?ref_=fsclp_pl_dp_2) 
---
2. A addon like Banana Bar that organizes hostel/enemy frames.  
---
3. Mouse over cast macro something like : #showtooltip Holy Light  
---
/cast \[target=mouseover,exists\] Holy Light; Holy Light 
---
Replace Holy Light with whatever spell you want.
---
Will in game GMs be a thing again?
---
Saved. Thank you!
---
About Herod, can you reveal any information about the server cap size? Also, in your experiences where do you think new players will begin to allocate when Classic launches? Would you expect Herod to thin out over time? 
---
Thanks so much for all the work you've put into making Classic a reality and for taking time to answer questions from us!
---
Were there any mechanics present in the 1.12 reference client that were particularly troublesome to get working in the new client?
---
How seriously will reports on RP/RPPvP realms be taken about RP intrusions? In modern WoW, they seldom seem listened to.
---
Additional question- how firmly will the rule on RP names be taken for these realms? Do we have to worry about people spam reporting names to open them up?
---
I would be surprised if you can even log in on launch day, no one can see into the future and find unknown problems.
---
Just hope for the best and roll a nat20 if possible.
---
mobile*
---
how many people can be online on 1 realm?
---
how many people in que's are acceptable by blizzard?
---
In regards to the number of servers, I think most reasonable people understand why it's so low compared to 2004. Newer servers with layering can support far more players, and you're also making sure we don't end up with dead servers when the inevitable drop in population occurs. I think the majority of people understand that there WILL be a drop off, but it seems like the fans and developers have widely varying opinions on how big that drop it will be.
---
My questions regarding this are 
---
1) How big of a drop in population are you anticipating before layering is removed? It seems to a lot of people that you're counting on a very big drop, which brings me to my second question.
---
2) What are your plans if that drop off is nowhere near as large as you're expecting. Will layering be able to be removed if there are servers that still have far higher active populations than you're anticipating in a few months?
---
What do you base your "drop off" rate off? Seems like you are expecting 80%+ of the initial players and "tourists" to quit before end of phase 1, but this can only be educated guesses from your side?   
---
What happens if theres still a 20k population on a realm once phase 1 ends? Transfers would not be fair for the low pop server as the gold will be insanely inflated on the big realm.
---
Happens in combat and out of combat.
---
It's just a meme though, it's not noticable.
---
That being said. I'm going Troll Warrior. Stun resist is good and all but I love Beserking and the Troll animations are the best for Warriors.
---
ok so i accidently edited mulgore instead of 1k cause i'm retarded. click this: https://i.imgur.com/CIyfpkJ.jpg
---
Yes. I would like this, OSRS has really taken off since implementing their poll system.
---
Thanks for your detailed information. Is that all berserking is good for? Attack speed would not amount to anything in pvp? I thought for sure berserking fury warrior dual wielding would get some nice bonuses. 
---
I guess troll is better for casters then for increased cast speed? I just thought attack speed would be one of fury warriors things lol
---
Oh, then i will gladly take the compliment :) 
---
Thank you sir.
---
We chose the server before they announced it was massively overpopulated. HOW DENSE ARE YOU?!
---
Just saw another post from M.N.

Have you considered offering the new player models and animations from the retail client as an in game toggle?
---
100% agreed, I'm happy if there are things in the game (such as rank 14 in PvP) that I'm unable to acquire, but can always aspire to get, or look in envy at other players having.
---
 account got hacked , when blizzard got his stuff back they gave him an extra staff.
---
Runescape is legit one of the best MMOs available right now and has been for most of the last 18 years. It's fine if you don't like it but that's no reason to belittle other people's choice of game.
---
What defines WoW: Classic to each of you? Is it the old school graphics? Content focused around grouping? The focus on the open world itself? All of the above?
---
hopefully it gets Shazzrah down to 8k from 10k ques lol
---
How will the launch work? Can we sit in the character select or do we need to relog?
---
Has the team thoroughly tested the Paladin seal system; and specifically, the mechanic of seal twisting?
---
One interaction which has been noticed not to work is seen in twisting Seal of Command into Seal of Righteousness. This should produce the result where Seal of Righteousness damage is applied to both the original white swing and the consecutive Seal of Command swing; this currently does not occur and speculation points towards this being a result of the Spell Batch system. In looking towards The Burning Crusade, we know that a similar spell Seal of Blood produced exactly this effect and to this end Seal of Righteousness should function in the exact same fashion.
---
To this end; is the current interaction of seal twisting Seal of Command and Seal of Righteousness being not possible accurate? Or is this merely a bug yet to be fixed in WoW Classic?
---
Best Regards,

Archeon.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if they do not answer questions related to private servers. It's essentially a different game.
---
there was a similar comment with the perspective on chance after n runs.
---
i did mention on average and not definitely tough. since you ll fall into the gamblers fallacy otherwise.
---
does the % follow a certain mathematical constant?
---
i thought it was e but after looking into it im pretty sure im wrong. do you know about that?
---
I started with Enh Shaman main on cata. Kinda want the prequel, same name and all, no matter how many people advise against it.
---
What is the office/headquarters like now that we’re getting closer to the release of WoW Classic?
---
Are workers stressed, excited, or normal? Is the office more chaotic than normal?
---
Orcs have weapon skill increase, they will be better. Trolls aren't a terrible pick though
---
What type of paid services will you offer for Classic WoW? IE Will there be race changes/realm changes/name changes available in the shop?
---
Out if all the minmaxing races the one that really matters is alliance priests. That fear Ward is huge. No other racial choice for classes causes you to gain or lose significant abilities like that
---
Will we see the eventual release of scrapped or delayed content such as the Azshara Crater or Hyjal?
---
Is the possibility of extending classic content past Naxxramas totally out of the question? For example releasing totally new dungeons and raids with the level 60 cap, possibly even a 60 Karazhan?
---
Having never played the game past Litch King, I'm unfamiliar with the phasing system implemented on the later builds. 
---
Would this system be toggled on/off when population becomes a bit regulated?
---
What is the que going to be on Herod?
---
Fishing lvls?
---
Attack speed normally doesn't mean a ton in pvp as you don't get a lot of up time on your target normally. Very often you get into melee range get off an auto and maybe an ability or two. Then they are back out of melee range. I'm not saying Berserk does nothing. It's just no where near as valuable as a stun resist.
---
Good evening to the Blizzard team! My question for you guys is how long you reckon phase 1 and phase 2 be? As someone who loves vanilla bgs i think it's sad they are implemented first in phase 3 and i will really miss them until that phase! What are the thoughts behind how long each phase is gonna be? Will you be listening to the communities? Give me your answer and thanks for bringing Classic back! &lt;3
---
Will there be given any info on different numbers for caps and spans in server pop? how many are needed for medium, high, full etc. and is there a maximum on the queue aswell?
---
Thanks, got the right discord I think.
---
Nobbel87 does a ton of lore videos on YouTube
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
somebody couldn't kill jad
---
Memory accurate.  It was easy to take over Crossroads as a level 60, even by yourself.  The only threat was other 60s.
---
Chuck Norris has a grizzly bear rug in his room. It's not dead, it's just afraid to move.
---
Man why are you checking out /new on this sub if you can't even play, sounds like torture
---
Agreed, went straps first time, I know I like them at least.  But this time Eyes might be nice, the curse of choosing is worse than the curse of un-death.
---
I want them stickers though!
---
What bee flew into your bonnet?
---
Will raid leaders in BGs be able to spam ready checks and RWs?
---
Gold is extremely valuable and important for classic - raiding is expensive (consumables, respec costs).  High level pvp is also expensive (consumables)
---
That's dumb as af
---
Yep they did, but my comment was purely on how it decides to show high medium low :)
---
Then start your own guild. Letting scrubs get gear and leave is how you disband
---
Yeah, little discussion itt about _when_ it could be implemented, and I agree. Post phase 6, well down the line, this could be a good tool for forging a path for the longevity of Classic, and listening only to those who're still playing it then.
---
&gt;Onyxia
---
This is not possible in Classic.  All players who were in the instance when Onyxia is engaged will be locked.
---
Will the addons vanilla be compatible? How about addons from newer expansions? I'm sorry but Peggle may be a make or break for me.
---
Just ignore wowhead, the guides are full of misinformation. This site gives the most accurate guess we know of: https://itemization.info
---
No matter the itemisation scheme T2 helm should be phase 1 since it was there from release in vanilla.
---
Are there other items beside stun Grenade that would help with mobility??
---
Looks like windowed mode
---
The servers are already marked as full or high population. And that's only the people who wanted to get their name reserved prelaunch. How do you plan on handling the insane demand and pressure on the servers when the rest of the playerbase goes to make a character aswell?
---
or that guildie that quits a week later
---
In regards to server population and layer capping. How many players can a given server have? Will layers stop being adding once a cap is met?
---
If you want people off of Herod so bad - can you give us some numbers? Had the population cap been reached? Will we be waiting for others to log out to log in as opposed to be queued into a layer?
---
I couldn't find this anywhere but have you guys decided on the instant mail or 1 hour delay?
---
It will probably be like it was on stress test which is pretty much like it's on retail. You can go invisible on the battle net tho so you can get that feeling nonetheless.
---
If not during, definitely afterwards.
---
Also going to be using an early 2015 macbook pro. From what i gather most people say it should be just fine, At most i will be using discord + wow classic at once. There shouldnt be any major problems that prohibit you or me from playing
---
Lol yeah. I'm 35 now and returning for sure :) still feeling young though 0.o
---
So say Classic+ does become a thing.. would there still be the chance that we get BC and WOTLK content? Would they tie into the game or would they be separate servers do you think?
---
However, when I make my warrior alt, I’m gonna play Tauren. Male Tauren have the largest hit box therefore they have increased melee range. And imo stomp is super clutch. I’ll be pvp prio.
---
Is this a troll post?
---
Will there be a way to ensure that your "base" layer is connected to your guildmates. So it's possible to meet them out in the world by coincidence instead of having to plan it out with party invites beforehand?
---
One of the worst changes I remember happening was the goblin guards with nets that were basically terminators. Sucked all the fun out of the booty bay and gadgetzan shenanigans.
---
Yep it is.
---
What's your favorite classic WoW Machinima?
---
Will you guys ever consider making herod a mega server (6-10k players online or no cap limit) in the event where the population after phase 1 dosen't drop and queues are still hours long?
---
There is only 1 mok nathal left though...
---
I thought xrealms was not going to be a feature for classic at any level.
---
Ahhh the joys of a square (4:3) display 🤗
---
Does Blizzard have any plans to make /world an official chat channel? Ty in advance.
---
What has the method been for choosing realm names?
---
Are mods going to flair the blizz employee accounts so we can easily scroll through and see responses?
---
How I could tell? Lmao. My subjective opinion was that it turned increasingly into a game I didn't want to play. I wanted to play the old world, I didn't wanna "press a button to get fun" which is what the game slowly turned into. You think it took a whistleblower for the huge BFA playerbase to suddenly realise the game was shit? MoP came out 5 years after TBC. You might not have been very receptive in your early teens but I was.

**&lt;Heroism Not Included&gt;** \- Alliance, US-PvE (Pagle) - Casual/Semi-HC Raiding
---
**&lt;Heroism Not Included&gt;** is looking for more players to bolster our ranks ahead of Classic launch so we can hit the ground running with a few groups to level together and grow into a solid raid team.  There is absolutely zero intention to push for world/region/server firsts at all -- we all have jobs, and can’t put in the kind of time we used to.  We’re here to have fun first - to us, that means play what you dig and enjoy the people you spend time with in-game!  Our expectations for members can be summed up in the one sentence: "Act like an adult, don’t cheat, and think of the team first."
---
Focus/Schedule: Early on, obviously, will be leveling. No one is expecting you to be 60 in a week (heck, even a month...) - you play at your pace. Eventually (targeting 6-8 weeks) we'll be raiding on Thursday and Friday nights from 8:00-11:00pm Eastern Time. We intend to use EP/GP for raid loot.
---
Applying: We're currently accepting all classes! Please visit our website (https://heroismnotincluded.gamerlaunch.com) to read our Guild Charter and fill out our short application!  If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us on Discord!

Kargoz mage leveling guide. /thread
---
I dunno, sometimes i think listening too much to what the players wanted, is what watered down and weakened Vanilla in the first place.
---
Thanks for this AMA! What are the max technical capabilities that the modern servers can support in terms of population/player base? I'm curious from a technical standpoint - if layering was never going to be removed, is there any theoretical limit on how many players could make it on a single realm? Otherwise with layering, I'm guessing you can just spin up or merge new instances as needed, correct? (I know this isn't the plan for classic). 
---
What kind of player numbers are you expecting to support for phase 1 with layering and what are you capable of handling in phase 2 without layering but with the support of modern hardware?
---
The caps are already higher than they used to be, but you'll still be waiting for people to log off, so you can login.
---
Through layering, they have increased realm capacity, but they've stated they won't increase the # of layers infinitely, despite being able to.  They don't want these realms to suffer when layering goes away.
---
I remember people setting up gadgets on their desks to move their character every couple seconds so they wouldn't get logged off and stuck in a queue.
---
Do you enjoy making up lies?
---
Ok not a super heavy question but what were your favorite classes in recreating for classic?
---
I think i recall PvP gets fixed but the old remains. What about old IF, under SW, secret troll villages and GM island!
---
Male for sure. 
---
Hey as a Troll you're covered if you ever want to Tank.
---
Ehhh....I say leave the freaky dominatrix masks to the warlocks and rogues lol
---
You guys done with your little deluded powwow?  
---
There's a reason why r/classicwowplus only has like 1k members despite having been promoted, constantly, to the people of your persuasion on this sub since it was at 30k.  
---
This was the time to strike, for your community to come together and bat for the team to make Classic+ become a reality while the ball was in the air. All you could muster was 1.000 people.  
---
As for community votes, the community is stupid. We cheered when they gave us flying, we cheered when they removed the option for same realm BGs, we cheered when they gave us LFG, we cheered when they gave us LFR. We cheered when they gave us CRZ. The community is incompetent at making predictions. It can't decide what the better choice is until it has experienced the full ramifications.  
---
The only **real** choice at this point is to either go into maintenance mode (if financial 'failure') or progress to TBC (if financial succes), because it is the only financially responsible option. The tools have been developed, the team is experienced, small cost - big return.  
---
Yes this will 'split' the community, but there is no way to keep it together in the first place. You do nothing, we leave, you start balancing or making sideways progression, we leave. For maximum player retention, the playerbase needs the option to move forwards into TBC content while some people stay behind.  
---
It would have taken an immense effort to make Classic+ a reality to begin with, as the official stance at Blizzard has been "No." since the game was announced - likely because it's not even remotely as cost-effective or what we asked for in the first place.  
---
[You had 20 months, it's time to accept the reality of the situation.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnYr6E0Wqs0)
---
Did someone say, Thunderfury Blessed Blade of the Windseeker?
---
I feel the same way regarding this as I do with /script CastSpellByName("Ability Name here")
---
Adding this exploit (let's be honest, that's what it is) back would be true to vanilla, but it would be completely antithetical to the design and vision of vanilla, and everybody knows it.
---
Congrats, then you don't actually want to play Classic.  Classic plus is called retail.
---
Thanks homie
---
This is definitely one of the options we are considering. But for now, we are encouraging players to use the name reservation period to transfer their characters to lower population realms.
---
Yeah, I know, I've been playing one for 15 years.
---
It's also immobile as fuck, to the point where you'll love having more stuns and CC that doesn't eachother.
---
Hey, asking about cut content from when vanilla was released (Hyjal for example). What is each of your favourite things when it comes to cut content that you would have loved to see make it into the game?
---
Recently, the developers wanted to add a new skill called Warding to the game. They put a lot of time and effort into creating the skill and then made changes based on community feedback.
---
When the skill was finally polled, out of 125k votes, 66.4% voted Yes and 33.6% voted No. In order to be added to the game, it needs a 75% majority vote. This poll also had the most votes out of any poll to date.
---
One of the problems with this polling system are people can create new member accounts and vote on them. For every No vote, there needs to be 3 Yes votes in order to pass. The developers said that people with alt accounts was minimal and would not have changed the outcome.
---
Another negative to the vote system is some people vote No out of spite towards another community. There is a big divide between the PvM community and PvP community. The PvP community is much smaller than the PvM community which makes polls for PvP updates are harder to pass. If there is a PvP update being polled, a handful of people from the PvM community will vote No to the update no matter what it is. This makes it difficult for PvP updates to happen.
---
As you can see, a voting system can be good and bad. Voting helps ensure that majority community is happy with an update, but is bad when a part of the community gets completely neglected out of spite.
---
It’s called seasonal servers or fresh servers released in cycles, been doing it for years. Adding any additional content after Naxx will break the game.
---
The vocal members of the classic community have been extremely loud on saying 'NO CHANGES', however personally speaking (as a non-vocal member of the classic community) there is quite a good number of changes I would like to see in classic as to not affect the base game. 
---
For example, as a hardcore arena player on retail, and speaking with the members I play with regularly, Classic doesn't meet there need of high skill arena gameplay, thus most of them won't really be putting much effort into Classic just because this fact. So I could see adding rated arenas as an alternate skill based route to getting rank 14 gear but achieving a gladiator title instead, being some beneficial content for the community. Other avenues for changes might be bringing more life to 'dead' specs, either by adding gear or tweaking skills and talents. 
---
That being said, the success is based on the communities viewpoint, and similar work is seen in Old School Runescape. I personally think there is a MASSIVE opportunity from blizzard even to go as far as launching temporary new servers with the sole purpose of providing a new experience, like OSRS' deadman mode (and ending with a server wide duel tournament!)
---
So my question is: Has the classic team determined how they might interact with the community to provide updates to classic? Has there been any specific strategy decided on how to approach them (e.g. what is a good idea, what is a bad idea)?
---
Happy cake day!
---
I find comfort in sharing the misery this video bestowed upon me.
---
You are not going to get an unbiased opinion in this subreddit.
---
Retail is so instanced, phased, layered, sharded with so many convenience and cross-realm features that it plays like a hub based instance game. You typically just sit in a hub area and queue up for stuff. There is very little world once you complete the theme park leveling experience for that expansion.
---
Would be amazing to see Emerald Dream as it was supposed to be :D guessing they have map files and dev notes so that they are able to do it. But it seems like most of the community wants a bc and wrath launch instead of expanding on classic, the classic way
---
The server pop caps won't be raised any further. However, the server population caps in classic will be much higher than vanilla. Blizzard stated this in the last couple of days.
---
So this means that the initial demand was wildly underestimated by Blizzard staff when making only a few servers of each type?
---
It’s about as long as you make it out to be. 
---
I’ve played it a bunch so I know where things are and what is going to happen. 
---
I am also not great at RTS but not dog shit either, so I’m pretty quick with macro and micro. 
---
I’m on the undead campaign after about two hours or so of play time.
---
This is my most burning question. I want desperately for what WoW could have been. I'd love some alternate history / development.
---
Legend has it that quests and other content went away with Cataclysm without ever being discovered by players, but devs were always a bit coy about what they were even after they were gone. Can you confirm whether such things exist and have returned in Classic?
---
I did the bed thing, it just felt right to do so back then.
---
Just to add to this: I would absolutely love to have access to the other expansions like with classic.
---
I wasn't around when classic was (I don't feel any nostalgia towards it, but I'll be giving it a shot regardless), but I'd **love** to replay WOTLK/Cata/MoP.
---
You've always been able to change character names by abusing customer support procedures if you really wanted to so you don't even need to transfer to a new server.
---
Hi, /u/fishbowlfood
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ct2ivy/are_brits_transfering_to_firemaw/). 
---
They didn't offer this until later in classic.
---
Usually they would offer transfers to players on one or two particularly high population servers to one specific low population realm.  
---
they wouldn't offer you and your friends a way off the dead server, they would bring some new life to it.
---
1. Do you plan on having micro-transactions or paid services in Classic? 
---
2. How do you plan on combating the rampant bots and gold-sellers that have plagued the private server realms?
---
Hot.
---
Thankfully, my gf and I have already had planned time off to travel and visit her family next week. She doesn't care what I do as long as I have fun (she says that now) and her dad might make fun of me a little bit but I won't hear him if I'm on discord
---
We're not releasing specific numbers, that will likely change dramatically. Based on the response we got from name reservations, we're anticipating large  player populations for some realms initially. This may change as players switch to lower population realms. We'll use layers to help improve performance in the short-term if large groups of players cluster in an area. We hope to reduce the use of layering over time as people spread out in each realm.
---
Kirilenko probably will be the best geared person in classic lol
---
me2. I want that non glowy swift wolf for my tauren. :(
---
its rng u silly F for lack of better words
---
Can we have some numerical estimates on how many people currently are reserved on Shazzrah? It's hard to convince my friends to leave because they expect all the other servers to be dead a week after launch - however if we had roughly an idea on how many reserved characters there are on the server it would be way easier for me to persuade them to leave!
---
Also makes it hard for people to decide because honestly we don't know what "full" or medium means.
---
If player numbers do not dwindle but rise.. what will you do in order to achieve no layering by phase 2?
---
Akama and the broken Draenei are in WC3.
---
And chairs!
---
&gt; You can stay on vanilla at Naxx patch forever if you want, I'm sure when the time comes to expand into tbc or 'classic+', the majority of the community will be exhausted with Vanilla.
---
This is all I've ever said to anyone and people get feverishly angry when I bring it up. I want everyone to get what they want and they already have what they're after. I don't want to spoil their happy ending with WoW Classic.
---
I just want other people stuck in the middle who are sick to death of retail but also unhappy with 1.13 to get a fairy tale ending too.
---
Yep. More importantly, it would prevent retail players who aren't invested in Classic from voting.
---
Hey I'm not sure if this has been answered but I would like to roll on a pvp server that wont have insane queues, but incase it ends up being dead afterwards I would like to transfer to another pvp server with a more dense population once the dust has settled for classic. Id like to know if you guys plan on offering paid character transfers for wow classic.
---
Being worried ≠ Whining.
---
It could still even out with the player influx at launch. I'm just saying that the Horde seems like the bigger faction right now by a somewhat significant margin.
---
Should classic be successful, do you plan to bring some aspects of the game that made classic great back in retail? Be it rpg or classic fantasy
---
Hey guys thanks for your time. After a few weeks will you guys release any graphs releasing faction ratio, classes ect. It would be interesting to see the numbers and data that you guys come up with. 
---
Thanks for your time. 
---
Whats your favorite expo for world of warcraft
---
Where I used to work it took use 6 weeks to get blades setup and configured into the datacenter.
---
Could explain why Blizzard had to stop selling their game for a period
---
But they stuck to their class nonetheless. In 2019 they would’ve rerolled after 5 mins.
---
Thanks for taking the time to do this! Any idea on what the proc chance on ironfoe will be? Thanks!
---
Rofl, go play on a pve server if youre this butthurt.
---
Did you try stalagg?
---
At launch, how long does it take for an afk character to be kicked off the server? I have kids that need attention from time to time or other issues that need urgent attention and I’d hate to be in queue for 1 hour, log into the realm, then be kicked out for inactivity and then back to queue.
---
I know this may sound like a silly question, but I have to manage this variable as well :)
---
Will new servers ever be introduced that act as a "Refresh" of sorts to the content release schedule. I hope it is not a 'one and done' situation once we all get to Nax.
---
What is the plan going forward after Naxxramas has been out for a year or so? Will there be progressive content or plans to transition into TBC?
---
I know that you are getting bombarded with questions but what is the difference between a high and full pop server? All the PvP servers for EST are high.
---
Sure.
---
I was just responding to the "how quickly will you be able to add new servers?" question, which is something we already pretty much know. If they've got staff/resources at the ready (which they will on launch), then they should be able to get new servers up and running pretty damn fast if that decision is made.
---
&gt; It is designed for Casual players. 
---
You literally say it in this post. Your logic is flawed on how you see the game design. You've repeatedly said it is designed for the causal, and implied repeatedly it was only designed for the casual. It never was, or has been since initial conception been designed for a single demographic of gamers.
---
 It is designed for both, it has hardcore aspects, and casual aspects. It was designed so casuals could have as much fun as hardcore gamers, Yes. That doesn't mean it is designed for the casual players to see all the content, or achieve everything in game.

Could you give us estimated queue times on each of the "Full" servers? This would be super helpful in determining to stay or leave a realm.
---
That’s brutal man. What a jerk. My buddy had similar happen. He made every raid as main tank, but he missed one non-mandatory raid, and of course half of thunder fury drops that day, and it went to our rogue buddy. 
---
A month later the second half drops and they give it to our buddy, a rogue, so they gave thunder fury to a rogue instead of offtank because the rogue had the first half. 
---
They still argue over it to this day.
---
This greatly undermines the spirit of the War Effort. It was something that was sprung on players and demanded we react. Now players will farm the materials months in advance and the War Effort will end in a flash, robbing entire servers of an amazing, one-of-a-kind experience in WoW.
---
A special event requires a special philosophy. It shouldn't be treated like the rest of vanilla. 
---
This is a big mistake.
---
Paid transfers were a thing in vanilla.
---
But not changing it is a change because we know where it is and that changes everything!

I've lived with chronic pain for 10+ years and have had to not use each hand at separate points because of intense pain levels. Your best option is going to be to buy a mouse with at least six buttons on it. Clicking your spells is totally feasible too, if you don't have the money for a mouse, but I really want to caution you against overdoing it because it doesn't take much to mess up your tendons when you're doing a ton of moving and clicking. RSI sucks!
---
If you can't afford a nice mouse, looks like you're on clicking duty! It's not the best, but it's not the worst, either. Just go slow and be considerate to your body by remembering to take breaks so your right hand doesn't bear too much stress and end up in a bad place, too. :)
---
Just for example on Ony, you would get her scales and bag on every clear. By having 35 people leave, only 5 would get locked and you could clear Ony \~5-6 times via this method weekly. Even as far as unique loot goes, you would just leave a tank, a healer, a caster, and a melee dps so any drops could be possibly used.
---
Mankrik and Pagle are both showing "Full" with not many PvE server options remaining. Do you think you're destined to open another PvE realm at this rate?
---
Text only appears to be blue on old Reddit, is that expected?
---
It's so dense, every single image has so much going on.
---
Are your realms on VMs or physical servers? When did WoW transition from physical servers to VMs?
---
Mage races on ally suck and horde zones suck
---
I see alot of warrior loot on there tbh :)
---
you're fucked.
---
That’s a bad example, a better one would be more like are apples better than shit?
---
Hello and thanks for giving us classic i just have one question!
---
Why cant we have the old mount models for the first couple of phases?
---
Since you implemented the old mount faction system why can't we get the original mounts for a little time for the same prices it was back then? I had one of those mounts in original vanilla and i really wanted it again.
---
I think if you let them stay up for 2 phases everyone will have the chance to get it and it will be more authentic than the way you want to do it now ?
---
Can you charge $7.50 a month just for classic?
---
Weapon skill is the most broken OP racial for PvE DPS.
---
There are Edgemaster's Handguards gloves with +7 wep skill for daggers, axes and swords which put you closer to the orcs but they will cost you quite a lot of gold (Could even be a double price of an epic lvl60 mount lol), but you still are missing out other stats from glove slot. 
---
Not going axes won't change how mustard tastes, as now you will be competing for swords and daggers with rogues instead.
---
Troll berserking is a decent ability but it costs rage, has longer CD and you need to be &lt;40% HP for max effect.
---
So you'd really want to be an orc if you're trying to max out PvE/PvP as a DPS horde warrior.
---
Minmaxers would pick fury/prot hybrid spec trolls for tanking, but it is a different story already.
---
And in Europe there is quite a debate over which nationalities go to which servers. It's really, really bad for us if they just suddenly make more servers and split us up!
---
This is one of those times I think it'd be detrimental - people will stockpile ahead of time, finish the event within hours, and deny the involvement of the majority of players. Especially if the resource count required stays the same due to the increased populations.
---
It won't playera that want to kill you will still want to kill you honor rewards or not.
---
Sadly people donm't read it  and vote anyways-.
---
Very enjoyable for the ganker, I would think.
---
It was cool at first. But I missed having real buildings. Dalaran was such a breath of fresh air for me. Pyramids were also really cool, but a pain in the ass to navigate.
---
In any case, seeing huts and spikes everywhere gets old pretty quickly. Especially since most of the quest areas are huts in general for the horde. 
---
Granted, if you were Alliance the entire time, seeing homes and castles would probably get pretty boring pretty quickly as well...
---
Almost every "national" server is pure cancer. I'm very worried that there's not enough servers to avoid the bullshit.
---
My group and I are going to be playing on Arugal on OCE servers, but we’re quite worried that our server may end up becoming extremely underpopulated, or at least not having many English speakers on it. Will it be on the cards for us to transfer to a United States realm if this is the case?
---
Its the breadcrumb players that will be an issue.  The 5 people who havent created an account yet but are going to roll on X server because thats where their friend steve rolled.
---
No amount of big data center can maintain the integrity of the game in that case
---
Melt
---
all
---
the
---
faces
---
Yeah IF is a cool city. At least you guys get to chill there instead of Stormwind now.
---
Will you provide a public horde/alliance ratio for classic realms? This way people can better decide where to go.
---
Don't be sad, you're one of the good guys now.
---
Are you planning on or even contemplating allowing “corrupted blood” to be an event for a short time period like what happened by accident originally? It seems like there’s a pretty big call for this to happen. (After all, it is hilarious)
---
You guys should really give a ETA of Players? Like 30k Online etc.
---
That'd be awesome
---
So very true. Things that make the game easier, do not always make it better. 
---
I know a lot of people just haaaate leveling and grind. I love it. I wish it were longer and maxing out wasn't even really realistic. Would most people probably hate that? Oh probably. Would they vote to make the game less grindy, rather than slog through it? Probably again.  I'm betting a lot of people will leave classic quickly due to "Whine whine tedium grind". Knowing that they could vote to change things in their favor? Yikes.
---
My concern with having these progression servers is that it will dilute the existing servers which will in-turn reduce player interaction.  I'm extremely happy about Classic, but I don't think this recreation will scale well for the other expansions.
---
Please reconsider how the behavior of the event works.  ie. Instead of "peacebloom" have the turn-in be "peacebloom pollen" which is only harvestable in the gate opening patch.
---
What sort of paid options will be available? (Realm swap? Faction swap? Character rename? Character recustomization? etc)
---
You would have a better arguement if you tried to get them to just have the unarmored mounts in period... without going away.. Their reasoning is that they do not want to create an incentive to speed level, and many causal players will be punished for not being able to speed level before phase 2.
---
Eat a soap man you're too sour
---
Hello and thank you for doing this. Let's talk Spell Batching. Its here and it's in the game, but if it proves to be a detriment to the authentic feel of classic, will it be looked at? It was a nessecary evil (and a brilliant design decision) in 2004, but in 2019, it doesnt feel like it used to.
---
After a couple of phases when realm population stabilize would server merging be a consideration for low pop realms?
---
in the beta multiple people could skin the same mob at the same time and get the leather is that vanilla like? are you aware of this? i already saw people talking about skinning devilsaurs with multiple people at the same time to get more of the leather will this be a thing?
---
several hours or **more** 
---
days?
---
The queue time is all the incetinve they need to stop more people from joining and encouraging players to move. If the people who choose to remain want to deal with the queues ultimately thata on them
---
Rent a studio apartment in the city for wow.  Tell your wife you have a busy work season coming up, and you’ll be traveling out of town frequently for the next year.
---
You’re welcome.
---
I don't think that's true. Once a casual left Azeroth behind they were sent to a small world with almost 0 exploration or social potential. And it got worse after Burning Crusade. I just don't think bolting small new worlds onto the main world, with 0 interaction between them, did anything for anyone, most especially casuals.  As far an I can tell it was only ever done to introduce flying, which created a knock-on effect of making these small new worlds even smaller again. There is no joy for an explorer/casual type in ascending 50 feet and auto-flying to their destination entirely unimpeded.
---
Good for you on your skepticism I suppose?
---
Can't tell you much else, I'm not the dude in question and its been 13 years since then. I know for a fact that the mouse I had in '05 did not have a scrollwheel on it however, so it's not like I ever changed my camera settings either. I recall my characters shins being somewhere at the bottom of the screen.
---
Oh boy this triggered my PTSD. F that movie
---
Will the Auction House be per server or Game-Wide?
---
why has ion been fired yet  
---
thanks
---
Agreed, sad to see even Blizz doesn't understand that strict literal #nochanges is a more sever change than actual numeric changes.
---
Do you think that some little loot table changes or  balance changes could occur after a while ?
---
For example there is no upgrade for a ranged weapon for a hunter from BWL to last boss of Naxx. Adding one in AQ40 could be a good change to help balance the class !
---
I assume Bindings for TF are not immidately on the table, if anything.
---
Aaw, what is wrong with low population realms? We like them, well some of us do!
---
Is it possible to have an idea of the server limit that will be in effect once phase 2 launches vs the population limit at launch?
---
Example if Herod has 10k+ queues at launch, how much longer would those queues be once phase 2 launches, assuming no one drops out (even though people will drop out)
---
Mankrik's Wife is a meme. But a more serious issue is the Ahn'Qiraj War Effort. With a year's worth of advanced knowledge farming, the war effort will be over in the blink of an eye if you keep the required turn-ins the same. Have you ever considered changing these, even by simply switching the Horde turn-ins to Alliance and vice versa? Otherwise it will entirely defeat the expectations of a server-wide community event.
---
What are your thoughts on Classic+ content? Have you guys/gals thought about adding races in like the high elves, goblins, etc? What about adding in the zones of Azeroth that aren’t in Classic like Hyjal, Lordaeron, Twilight Highlands, etc. Or adding in any content that was planned for Classic like Kara or Azshara’s battleground that didn’t make it in? I know adding new content and changing things in Classic is a huge no no to most of the returning players but I think if it’s kept in Classics original concepts and gameplay it would be very awesome to have new content to explore after Phase 6! 
---
Thanks for taking the time to read and answer if you do!
---
There's no such thing as solid information in this context. There's only what anecdotes you choose to believe will be similar to your future experience. Which is kind of silly, your experience will be whatever it's going to be and you really can't quite predict it. Because it involves other bags of meat
---
in contrast to private servers, it's still going to be cheaper. 10k players on 1 realm made buying these a pain.
---
I'm just glad I'm not the only one. I haven't done a single hour of work this week.
---
You are so lame.
---
Hi, /u/Lowgarr
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ct2uu8/mankrik_is_now_full/). 
---
100% this.
---
Our guild swapped over last night to Skeram, and lost ~10 or so members in the process because of names not being reserved. It definitely would have made the transition smoother as we were also trying to coordinate what guild members needed a name reserved since they couldn't be on.
---
they stated before that they dramatically increased the pops from vanilla, bu this would make a good starting off point for guesstimating that data.
---
What are the population goals per server once phase 2 hits and how many people can we expect to be playing with on our layer in phase 1?
---
If Classic is successful enough, will you guys consider creating new content for the game in Classic style, instead of moving along the original path?
---
2 things, please never add any content to classic, it needs to stay as is and die, question mark for question lol? And second split the damn wow news groups. Regular players are tired of seeing classic crap every single day when we're never going to play that game again?
---
I also think it should be time gated, or just left in game in general. They have said #nochanges in response to other things. I don't know why that can't include the unarmored mounts. they've responded to questions about how many skeletons a person can generate, so here's hoping for a reply about this :)
---
Huh, I looked at these:
---
https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Devouring_Plague  https://classicdb.ch/?spell=2944
---
I'm kinda curious which is correct now.
---
FWIW, wowhead also says: 
---
&gt; For leveling as a Priest, there is only one spec that is reasonable to level as, and that is Shadow:
---
BALLS OF STEEL!!
---
Raises glass* True story. I quit my job and I have taken Monday’s off from my uni classes. Have you done your part OP?
---
That's an opinion
---
I wanted to do an addon that hide the ui while you weren't in combat.
---
It turns out that I hate lua and xml.
---
Is there any addon that does something like that?
---
I just hope it won’t be the same as on the private servers. If you don’t have every single pre-raid-bis item, good luck trying to get into any party. Fucking elitism for what, classic raiding?
---
Eh. Tranquility will patch that right back up.
---
With skeletons being nerfed because the possibility of hate speech, I must say you are going way to far trying to keep people "safe". It's world of WAR craft not world of you dont leave skeletons when you die.
---
We need a german rp server.
---
Ya don't listen to this guy. Just take it slow, plenty of time to enjoy leveling.
---
Possibly
---
It's my dream atm. Classic has so many things that make it funner than retail to me, I'm just afraid it won't last if there's no content post Naxx.
---
&gt;literally have to wait for 5900 people to log off before getting in
---
This isnt quite correct, you're waiting for 5900 players to be authenticated and logged into the server, the queue isnt tied to number of players actively in the game.
---
To much power for an orc
---
Try Endless Space 2.
---
Some of us are concerned about ending up on a low population realm and are consequently concerned about leaving one of the high population servers.  Will paid server transfers to a realm of our choice become available?  This might alleviate some of the stress in selecting a realm now.
---
Will there be account transfers for Classic? If not, I'm going to have to cancel some of my extra accounts now lol.
---
Sorry i dont know who you're talking about then. Because if its not the devs, it cant possibly be me because i was there for it as well.
---
Will there be any form of free trial version for new players to experience the Classic world of warcraft?
---
Answered: you'll be able to log and hit enter world as soon as servers launch
---
Same situation here man. Except I have that entire weekend after launch committed to grinding. Thank god for Labor Day 😂
---
If I open it in my Reddit app, I only see two images, but if I open the link in chrome I see all of them
---
mistake ;s
---
Just don't stop playing, poopsock it.
---
I'm personally not a fan of the  'X' head or what not but at the end of the day you'll be playing hours on this character so would feel bad influencing your decision.  I'm having similar problems, was leaning towards a Paladin but the male human models are pretty brutal looking. Though I had it figured out but I'm still up in the air on which class I'll end of playing.
---
Are you keeping server count low because you expect a huge influx of people joining with a sharp decline of activity in the next few months or is there a reason there are such a few number of servers to handle such a massively popular launch? I understand you guys want people that are on the biggest servers to switch to the lower pop servers but they are all filling up without considering all the people that haven't subbed yet or all the people that don't care about reserving their name?
---
At the end of vanilla, were there any undiscovered secrets for players to find that we never found, and do you hope people find them in classic wow?
---
Will the Stranglethorn Fishing Extravaganza and Gurubashi Arena chest be available right away?
---
Why can't trolls wear shoes? :(
---
I just want to toggle them off and on.
---
Sure you were.
---
After that luck you'll be lucky to even get a blue bracer drop in classic
---
Any chance we'll see something like the Corrupted Blood incident again?
---
&gt; #nochanges
---
I guess this answers a lot of questions here. What a joke.
---
It's still summer until September 23rd
---
Thank you, I find it weird to look at the word “sorry” after so long, it’s weird.
---
Not with that attitude.
---
Fishing is a-amazing for the times you are sitting in a pug raid waiting for the last couple healers to be found. You venture from Ogrimmar to Azshara and fish all them stonescale eels to not wholy waste that waiting time.
---
Yea chill lol
---
You make a convincing argument..
---
I doubt they answer this.  They want people to move now, not wait to move for free down the road.
---
Still a super vague and ambiguous answer.
---
UP TO several hours. Okay what's the expected, the average, not the worst case maximum possible number.
---
And what's SEVERAL hours? 2? 6?
---
And only in CERTAIN instances.
---
Will your spirit be automatically released after 6 minutes? Because it wasn't working during stress test.
---
Thanks for the answer but that’s disappointing
---
We have ~70 people who have made their characters over there. We created a coalition already with 11 other guilds and formed an alliance for pvp/raids. We have members already cross discussing with these other guilds and working towards locking zones, pvp response and even swapping members around in raids with some of our overpopulated classes. 
---
We have a good amount of time invested already with our server and other guilds of this server. Time we won't be getting back, that is how we are established. It isn't just we said we are going here.
---
Is looting being subjected to spell batching?
---
How are you going to combat botting and multi's and gold farmers.?
---
Hi, I’m me. I’ve done this before. You just get into the game and forget you waited in queue earlier and go “oh I need Gatherer!” And log out without thinking about it
---
Yes but there's a difference between:
---
1. Being a Scarab Lord takes a huge, guildwide commitment and a lot of serious dedication over a few weeks.
---
And what we'll have here which is:
---
2. Being a Scarab Lord requires someone to take mass, heart-stopping amounts of methamphetamine as they stay up multiple days straight. All while flopping the small army of Chinese child-slaves in their basement to commit mass-genocide on 18 generations of Silithids on every corner of Silithus to the point where C'thun surrenders and sticks a giant white flag above the gates of Ahn'Qiraj.
---
If Classic is as popular as it looks like it will be, is it possible that the development team will look at fleshing out the world with new immersive storytelling and class questlines, and perhaps other features y’all wanted to put into the initial game but didn’t have time to do so?
---
Dozens of us stayed!
---
Dozens of us!
---
These servers are being opened to combat high population on Herod/shazz, so new people who haven't bothered to log in to try to reserve names aren't really high priority to me when you're trying to give guilds incentives to move off higher pop realms.
---
I try my best, thanks friend.
---
SneakyPete vs Vending Machine Sally
---
Better yet, you should not be heroic striking ;-)
---
Just as much as you were in that case :)

Obviously, someone well versed in the art of vanilla

Will the Gurubashi Arena be open on server launch?
---
What are your estimates for server population after the first few weeks?
---
Personally, i would expect the numbers to explode in the first few weeks and then fall off in the upcoming months.
---
How do you fine people expect the population to fluctuate over time?
---
If I'm logged into a Full realm and I get disconnected, will I have a grace period to log back in and avoid the queue ?
---
Business decisions. Not gonna release shit like they to random people on the internet lol
---
And that queue moved fast as shit. Sucks if you bugged out but there are always going to be winners and losers in a random queue. As a whole the process was still very smooth and nothing like the doomsday scenario OP tried creating.
---
Fire Red allows Cevil Islands and Gen 2 catch.
---
This is kinda huge.
---
Does this pertain only to raid bosses, or to 5- and 10-man dungeon bosses as well? I think people were expecting item-gating where blue-quality "catch up" gear from 1.10 wouldn't exist in dungeons until phase 5 to avoid warping raid difficulty and protect the importance of epic drops in early raiding. Can you clarify this point a bit more?
---
completely agree, watching hype videos the past 2 days and procrastinating all my work till thurs and fri, pumped to have all next week off!
---
I don't retail.  I will Classic.  Checkmate, Athiest.
---
What was your favorite part about developing WoW Classic?
---
What about queue times of other servers such as Stalagg and Skeram in comparison? 
---
I am trying to convince my friends to switch off of Herod, any estimates would help.
---
Link?
---
I was VERY disappointed to see I could not reserve my vanilla wow names. Why did you not give long-time subscribers the opportunity to keep their vanilla names? Specifically, if they are still playing those names from Vanilla in BFA, why didn't you reserve them?  
---
Great difficulty loggin on to reserve my names. 2 of the 3 were already taken, and I was forced to select a server I know nothing about. It was literally a race to get a name reserved.
---
Straight facts and the sub count proves it.
---
This just hurt my head worse.
---
The "you think you do" speech was just a long con to drum up fan interest...
---
"#nochanges but we will exclude the unarmored mounts because we don't want players to rush the content for it."
---
Stay mad boomer
---
Wow, this is an awesome write up and really informative.
---
No. He means 1 layer, as in 1 big layer of all the people on the server.
---
Will there be a restock of the 15th anniversary collector's edition? It was sold out after a few hours basically and there are plenty of players who are still looking to buy one.
---
Queues
---
If you want to vendor yeah but even auctioning it is pretty good.
---
Wow. Fantastic. Could you give any insight on how layering interacts with guilds? eg. will players be put on the same layer as their guild members if possible?
---
Thank. You. !
---
Great! I must have missed it. Was it recently?
---
I like the graphics in retail better (especially character models), but classic is miles better in all other aspects (especially social interaction, aka single vs multi player).
---
Nice. Some mad WoW cred right there!
---
Heya! Do you have any plans to let players continue to play with their Classic WoW characters in Retail WoW after the Classic WoW comes to an end one way or the other? I'd love to see option to copy the character from Classic WoW to Retail WoW and continue the journey there. Would be pitty not to see my character to progress somewhere after the Classic WoW comes to an end.
---
Awful and shortsighted. These are things private servers were forced to change for good reason. Your stubbornness will ruin this amazing community event, which, let’s face it, only comes around once every 15 years.
---
I hope we never get TBC, unless it's an "opt in" thing to move to a new server.  The appeal of a pure classic server for me is never losing my progress and gear.  I want to level up a fun world pvp character... then I wanna just go do other things, and have him waiting for me whenever I want to world pvp again.  
---
I don't want to log on and discover they added TBC and he's totally worthless now.
---
Agreed. It just sucks because they’re taking the week off before hand so from Wednesday (tomorrow) to August 27th. So it’s like the very last day of their vacation.
---
We gotta know what low means first... low could mean 5k people right now.
---
No question, but a thanks. Thanks for listening to the community, and letting us old wow heads relive the grinding glory that was classic. Cheers.
---
Fucking thank you, that's a lot of really concrete information and I appreciate your hard work.
---
Najs
---
At one point is was like a 1 month cooldown on transfers right?
---
I love the internet.
---
Will you guys be patching known Gold Farming Strategies like DM Tribute runs to have a healthier economy?
---
I’d be perfectly happy with that
---
There is a 5 minute time window where you skip the queue, for situations like addons or when you random DC.
---
Skeram looking pretty good right now.
---
Asking 12 guild to move all their players to a new server, re-do time put into graphics, customizing discord servers etc. it seems easy, and while it most likely could be just seems disheartening. The effort has already been done with the expectation of our server and the thought that Blizzard was not going to introduce more servers.
---
&gt; When the time comes to withdraw from the fight, you’ll have to escape from your enemies and get to a safe place before you’re able to join your friends on another layer. 
---
lol, the mere idea that can you hide and layer has me in stitches, it's such an incredibly anti-vanilla thing. No longer can one faction keep a zone/town like SS/Theramore/Menethil/TM under control since can you just layer and go right past.
---
Or if one guild has some people on a kill-list they can just hide and layer and then be fine.
---
You should not ever ever ever ever ever be able to escape wpvp on a pvp realm, no matter if you hide for 1 hour or 10 hours. If you are in a contested zone you are in danger, end of story. None of this layering nonsense.
---
maybe you should announce now that you are going to change up the resources to prevent stockpiling then sneakily keep it the same
---
Please reconsider this. I'm as #nochanges as they come, but the spirit of intention should be the focus, rather than the actual character-for-character code. Some system should be implemented to, in essence, extend the collection event - be it a limit per-character/per-day on how many items can be turned in of a given source, or hard percentage caps (so, perhaps, no more than 5% of total items can be turned in faction-wide in a given day, leading to a minimum of 20 days for the event). 
---
I'd ask that the team review exactly how long the average server took to complete the event, and implement a system that allows the event to take approximately that long. The AQ event was epic, bringing it back is equally as epic, but keeping things as is, while literally #nochanges, takes away from the epic scale of the event. For collections to possibly be completed in a single day, given knowledge, ability for factions to plan for this, and for the drastically higher player counts on each server compared to OG, makes a literal 1-to-1 no change go against the spirit of this. Please look into changing this. I'm all for increasing the required turn-ins by 500%, or capping per-day contributions by the faction to 5%. Allow this event to recapture the epic scale it originally had - don't let it come and go in one day because you're inflexible on the actual numbers needed originally. That's #nochanges, but it's against the spirit of #nochanges.
---
What are unarmored mounts?
---
I would add that in vanilla some highly populated servers were offered server transfers, Whisperwind and Proudmore for example.
---
The OSRS route wont be any different. Before you know it people will be voting in all the stuff from retail that we didnt want. And dont say it wont because its obvious from this reddit and other places, hell even this thread alone, that people want stuff that shouldnt be in classic in it. The community cant be trusted enough to not let classic turn into retail.
---
And yeah they ignored some things because developers have their own vision for what a game should be, for better or for worse, they dont have to, and shouldnt, listen to the community for EVERYTHING. Otherwise we wouldnt have had  wow fall off a cliff during and after cataclysm. You can blame ghostcrawler for that, he made the game into the state its in today.
---
Why encourage paid? If a server drops heavily in population people shouldn't have to pay to ensure a decent game.
---
Is this actually a huge problem for most people? I have always had a unique name because I joined servers way after they were put out and if someone takes that I'll just think of something else. Sure my guild secured some cool names but every single one of them was willing to give them up
---
Will players be able to re-create the Corrupted Blood incident during  the first week of phase 4? It wouldn't be an authentic, Blizzard-quality  Classic experience if we couldn't! :)
---
Same, for now it'll be enjoy classic, I didn't get to the first time around. I wonder what happens though post phase 6
---
So it’s clear your a moron. I’ll just stop now. It’s not one guild moron you clearly cannot read.
---
how do you know its already 4:1? Where do you get your numbers?
---
Are there Easter eggs/secret quests that were never discovered by a single player and have yet to be found?
---
I would imagine 50,000 is what a FULL server looks like.
---
Instead of changing the mats (specific material or # of) around has thought been given to the idea of disallowing previously acquired mats that are needed?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cp111a/census_and_server_demographic_results_subreddit/
---
The “Raw data” link shows the breakdown
---
Hi judgement\_classicwow, and thanks for the question.  
---
As /u/pazorax mentioned earlier, we want there to be some exploration and discovery to this, so I can't dig super deep into exact specifics around when individual quests, items, or rep items will be available. Painting in broad strokes however, Thorium Point and Jintha'alor quests should be available during phase 1. Most quests in Cenarion Hold will be available during phase 5 along with the AQ Gate opening content. The general methodology was to make quests, recipes, items, and the like available when it makes sense to do so and feels relevant to the rest of the available content.
---
In order to alleviate the population issues on heavy servers like Herod, have you considered cloning these servers in their current state before launch?
---
Many guilds organized and synchronized getting all members to reserve their names based on the original realm list and organizing a mass migration to decompress servers is challenging and will result in lots of people losing the names they spent money subscribing early to secure.

By cloning the server guilds can easily redirect as a group to the clone in response to long queue times and the cloned servers can naturally diverge from their original as time progresses while still allowing those that logged on to secure names early not feel cheated about losing their name and pressured to not want to switch as a group. This should help prevent fragmenting guilds and legacy server collections.
---
I mean someone whos internet "fame/popularity" isn´t based on wow for example like sOAZ (league pro player) and people like that.
---
Oh, well then!  Hopefully it's still the case for classic, but I think you might be right that they may not allow that due to the extremely high populations.
---
Who knows!
---
Not true, dungeons are the fastest way to level.. unless you're a hunter/mage
---
Lol the joke is you trying to play it off as one
---
I members my first Classic launch, was 16 or 17 I had to go to school the next morning but I played until I got caught at 5am by mom. Now I'm 32, no school but still run the risk of getting caught at 5am .......by mom.
---
This is why the initial sprint out the gate is important. For every gank the opposing player does to someone not me, I'm grinding another couple mobs or finishing a quest. I think STV might be surprisingly tame early on because "red is dead" folks will take a bit longer to find the zone level applicable.
---
That said I might skip STV anyway due to PTSD.
---
I sure did. closer tight knit community.
---
Lol ! I just thought that before reading your post i allrdy calculated 8 hours of sleep be4 00:00 so i can play all night and than go strait to work ( I burned all my vacation at wrok for BFA :(  
---
Thank you  ! :D
---
Would you guys do a polling booth like OSRS has? I think it would strongly benefit the game.
---
Is there any plans to include the graphics updates or is it just gonna look "classic"

Are you guys planning to release the corrupted blood into the world once again or will it be kept from creating another pandemic?
---
You literally can’t buy anything to increases the strength of your character. So no, it’s not pay to win. Method isn’t the best bcuz they spent the most money. Your just some anti blizzard fanboy who didn’t answer my question.
---
Either there is a correlation between sub count and quality of product in which case retails quality would be better due to more subs, or there isn’t and your argument is null.
---
I do think theres something to be said for spirit of vanilla vs 1to1 recreation. The authentic experience cant be achieved if guilds use their prior knowledge to stockpile everything.
---
Hello team,
---
What phases will the Stranglethorn Fishing Extravaganza and Gurubashi Arena be added to the game?
---
I had submitted many questions regarding layering and so had many others.  This reply on layers is definitely the hard ball questions that need to be answered.  Thank you for doing so, and not just another "Yes, we are very excited for people to play classic wow next and layering will help!  Don't forget Herod and Shazzrah have long queues!"
---
Damn. No reck bomb.
---
While I know alot of people want Classic to be Classic, but are there any plans to allow the new character models to be available on Classic for those that want it? I'm all for the Classic mechanics....but I'm not against the newer visuals
---
How would it increase system requirements if DX12 is just an option? the default setting can just be what it is now
---
&gt;We're considering integrating a character transfer service once players have reached higher levels.
---
Please no
---
Might be to late. But what is the plan for new content? Will it be handled kinda like OSRS where the game will get new updates and content but you try to make sure it will fit with the classic "feel" or is there another plan for updates?
---
You said skeletons won't stay long because players can spell shit out... Can they not do this with living players?
---
It might be somewhat better in PVP but absolutely yes, mortal strike is a great addition to your DPS when you're leveling.  In PVP it is HUGE becaues you can do a combo of charge, autoattack, bloodrage+mortal strike for big damage to start a fight.
---
How does that work with the honour calculations? They were always done in downtime.
---
Do yall think that there will ever be items added specifically for Classic much much later? Maybe a color variation of different tier sets to support different specs?
---
It was 6 months, because it was meant to dissuade people from abandoning already small servers to go to a larger one. If you got to the larger one and couldn't "make it", you were now stuck there for 6 months. When you go from Large -&gt; Small I believe, generally, they removed or reduced that cooldown significantly.
---
TBC and WotLK are great and if classic does well should totally be brought back. 
---
You can talk separate servers but that would just break apart the community. Just bring them back like before but maybe make some slight changes and not bringing back features classic players dislike such as dungeon finder.
---

---
 Could you confirm this proc rate for us? /u/Aggrend
---
It’s utter garbage because it’s an unpolished heap of dogshit with no good mechanics or gameplay going for it. I’d have a better time figuring out its few good traits than listing all the reasons it’s a solid 3.4/10
---
Live client has LFR, therefor classic should have LFR too.
---
.....no, that's dumb.
---
I'd love to see a response to this as well.
---
Why nobody asked if you are planning to bring retail models and textures in toggled option for classic? 
---
I am a fan of visual upgrades of WoW since TBC (I am Vanilla player just didn't see much visual goodness in it, but since TBC came out all new stuff was so much better than old) and I want to preserve this new feeling and flowy stuff that your art team added to the game throughout these years. I'm sucker for graphics but I crave vanilla gameplay, so I want toggled option as you made for Draenor/legion when it was relevant. 
---
Will it be soon™ enough so I would experience Vanilla with better textures and models or I will be getting it as maybe or "you think you do but you don't"-wise? 
---
A lot of people in official forums also waiting this or at least don't mind if this will be optional toggle for the like of me.
---
Yeah, you're paying the exact same amount, in 2019, as you would in 2004, to play an always online game that requires maintenance, development, server space, etc. 
---
Depending on how you look at it, you're getting one of two subscriptions for free.
---
A cash grab would be them having a separate subscription for Classic, or worse, selling Classic as its own game. 
---
Just my $0.02
---
This just straight up made my day
---
I enjoy the speed part of it, I've leveled over 10 chars, I've taken it slow and enjoyed it a lot, but after a while you need something else to spice it up.

He has scheduled the first 28 hours playing 14 hours per after that anyway. The vanilla "record" is going to get fucking destroyed. I think less then 3 days played pretty easily. The guy who broke the record hit 40 in less then 34 hours played which was much faster then he did during vanilla times, and he has even said he isn't the fastest in the world right now.  To make assumptions on how fast people leveled 15 years ago is silly
---
Hey /u/AltruisWoW
---
Question from the PvE side of things. There's been such a huge focus on PvP servers, but now that the only two Normal EST realms of Pagle and Mankrik are showing as full, are there plans to make one or more PvE realms so we're not all drowning in queues? 
---
It does feel like we get shafted for the often louder PvP players/servers, and knowing if a new realm(s) were coming, would help a great deal of us plan to migrate or plan to stay. 
---
Insight would be amazing, thanks for all the hard work!
---
Laughing at people who are prioritizing WoW over life.
---
That fucking sucks. Shame you once again make the majority suffer for transgressions of a minority.
---
Classic is about the journey bro
---
Hey Classic dev team!
---
I'm a writer for Wowhead's Classic Guides section and recently did a guide for Spell Coefficients, as far as I can tell from digging up old wayback machine URLs, Blizzard never officially commented on spell coefficients. 
---
Most of the information (still available) out there is for 2.0.3 or later, which doesn't line up with coefficients for Classic WoW.  Which makes it really difficult to get accurate information for Classic.
---
Is there any way for players to get some more information on the spell coefficients in Classic WoW or could you just post the values somewhere? Thanks for any information!!  We love you!
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/formulas-spell-coefficients-classic-wow
---
The best part is how todays UI addons basically shows this exact same information. Just more efficiently.
---
As /u/altruiswow said elsewhere: We have contingency plans in place to bring up additional realms quickly if needed. 
---
We took a careful approach here. Taking various things into consideration, we wanted to hold true to our main objective of ensuring healthy realm communities in a post-Launch world. Therefore, we felt that the best approach here was to start off with fewer realms in order to gauge player interest during the name reservation period. As we have seen players congregate on certain types of realms, we have opened up new realms with communication to that effect. While we acknowledge that queues will be part of the launch experience, we encourage players to keep an eye on the forums and message boards over the next days/weeks for communications around realms with lower populations and therefore more manageable queue times.
---
You got downvoted because you pulled numbers out of the air.
---
Why the Fuck did you use that asshole in your gif
---
If I understand correctly, front-stabbing / front-shredding WAS possible during vanilla but the more frequent server tick rate will practically eliminate that possibility. What has been the discussion internally of this feature and was there any consideration of making mobs slightly stupider to make a front stab possible? 
---
I assume it was an unintended feature in the original game but something that some rogues/druids built their leveling experience around. Thanks for the AMA!
---
No- the second blizzard is fine
---
Blizzard slow lasts for 5 seconds if you reapply it even if it takes forever, it's not longer than 5 seconds my dude.
---
I mean, gold is kind of meaningless in WoW once you have your mount.  On the scale of evils, this would be pretty minor
---
either way its an exploit and the guild would be banned.
---
One of those players here. Hope to get this answered!
---
!remindMe 5 days
---
Does Activision-Blizzard plan on bringing in a WoW Classic PVP Competition for Blizzcon this year/next year? I find that, because Classic PvP is a bit slower, it's easier to follow and much less intense than contemporary WoW.
---
I saw they responded to your question. Does this answer change your guide at all? I’m planning to use it and just want to make sure I get the current version if you update it. :D thank you!
---
I don’t disagree, but of course our tanks were upset. It’s kind of a fun debate and I’m not sure there’s a wrong answer. That debuff helps the raid so much, and that was the crux of the argument.
---
You are the best!
---
Moving Mankrik's wife and tweaking AQ war effort to preserve the magic of vanilla with relatively little effort? #nochanges
---
Implementing a basic and well-loved mechanic as it already existed? No can do, kiddo
---
That's the rub between No Changes and keeping the spirit. Can't please everyone. Personally I'm with you but you know some people would go ape shit if they scaled it up.
---
I would definitely lose interest after I finished everything. Though I t’s gonna take me a couple of years.
---
So the strategy is to stay logged into your character before launch so you don't get queue
---
Chuck Norris doesn't sleep, he waits.

&gt;On  the most popular servers, such as Herod and Shazzrah, we are currently  estimating lengthy queue times - up to several hours or more in certain  instances. That is why we strongly encourage players to use the name  reservation period to transfer their characters and their guilds to  lower pop realms
---
Yeah...  lets see if I can get my guild to move now...

I thought this was a change after vanilla tho

WoW Classic Spotlight: The Ahn'Qiraj War Effort
---
posted 2018/01/09 at 2:51 PMby Neryssa
---
Hey everyone! We're back with another Classic Spotlight, where we take a deeper look at events that happened during WoW Vanilla to remember them and get hyped up for the upcoming WoW Classic servers! In this first post of a 2-part series, we're looking at the event that started it all and unlocked the secrets of the qiraji, the Ahn'Qiraj War Effort!
---
With the upcoming (World Event #638) event and the recent newfound relevancy of Silithus, we have decided to look at two classic instances: Ruins of Ahn'Qiraj and Ahn'Qiraj! In this first of a 2-post series, we will look at the massive server-wide event that led to the opening of those 2 instances.
---
Check out our past Classic spotlights as well on Onyxia's Lair and Farming Nature Resistance.

---
Fun Facts and Trivia
---
The Gates of Ahn'Qiraj was Blizzard's first attempt at a massive event that required efforts from the entire server. 
---
￼
---
When Patch 1.9 was released on January 3rd, in 2006, the two raid instances that composed Ahn'Qiraj, Ruins of Ahn'Qiraj and Ahn'Qiraj, were not immediately available to the general population. Instead, players had to undertake a massive war effort to help open the instance which included two segments: the gathering of hundreds of thousands of supplies, and completing an epic questline that took the server's most geared characters through an adventure to help the Dragonflights. The event reached its climax with a server-wide 10 hour event, which spanned lots of zones in Kalimdor. 
---
How fast or slowly Ahn'Qiraj opened depended only on the dedication of the entire server.
---
There was never such an event since AQ - Blizzard has created server-wide events since then, such as pre-expansion events, but these weren't as involved or as taxing on the players as the Ahn'Qiraj War Effort was. Although epic, the AQ event was plagued with server crashes, massive lag and even weird bugs.
---
Closed Scarab Wall image taken by Tour of Azeroth on flickr!
---
The Scarab Wall was created by the might of the Dragonflights, as a way to contain the Qiraji at the end of the War of the Shifting Sands. The only way the wall could be opened was by banging the Scarab Gong with the Scepter of the Shifting Sands, a creation from all the combined Dragonflights. As for the lore, the scepter was shattered by Fandral Staghelm, as documented in the Chronicle series of books:
---
"As a final act, Anachronos forged two mystical artifacts: the Scarab Gong and the Scepter of the Shifting Sands. The dragon entrusted the scepter to Fandral. Should the need ever arise to enter Ahn'Qiraj again, he could use this artifact to open the Scarab Wall.
---
Fandral found no solace in ending the qiraji threat, for Valstann's death still tormented his heart. In his rage, he shattered the Scepter of the Shifting Sands, and the pieces became lost for the next thousand years."
---
Warcraft Chronicle Volume One, page 148.
---
In the WoW lore, the official Scarab Lord, responsible for banging the gong and starting the second War of the Shifting Sands, is the veteran Night Elf Priestess Shiromar. You can read a short story on the War of the Shifting Sands on the official WoW website, written by Micky Neilson.
---
In this massive event, the most dedicated players reassembled the Scepter of the Shifting Sands, while the rest of the server gathered materials to aid in the war effort. As the Scarab Wall opened, a myriad of qiraji creatures would rush at the players, so the entire population of Azeroth had to prepare for the attack.
---
One of the necessary steps to open Ahn'Qiraj was the gathering of supplies. Both Horde and Alliance had to collect hundreds of thousands of supplies to aid in the war effort. You could turn these in at the War Effort bases (located at the Military Ward in Ironforge for Alliance, and the Valley of Spirits in Orgrimmar for Horde). 
---
Each turn-in gave you an ￼ Ahn'Qiraj War Effort Supplies, containing a green item equivalent to the level of the item you turned in, and a number of signets (￼ Alliance Commendation Signet/￼ Horde Commendation Signet), which were turned it at Commendation Officers for reputation for the capital city of your choice. This was actually a good way to farm reputation with capital cities, as the only other option at the time was cloth turn-ins (like A Donation of Runecloth).
---
Both factions had to gather a total of:
---
90,000 ￼ Copper Bar (1 signet per turn in)
---
26,000 ￼ Purple Lotus (7 signets per turn in)
---
80,000 ￼ Thick Leather (7 signets per turn in)
---
17,000 ￼ Spotted Yellowtail (7 signets per turn in)
---
400,000 ￼ Runecloth Bandage (10 signets per turn in)
---
The Alliance also had to gather:
---
180,000 ￼ Light Leather (1 signet)
---
800,000 ￼ Linen Bandage (1 signet)
---
110,000 ￼ Medium Leather (3 signets)
---
33,000 ￼ Stranglekelp (3 signets)
---
14,000 ￼ Rainbow Fin Albacore (3 signets)
---
28,000 ￼ Iron Bar (5 signets)
---
20,000 ￼ Roast Raptor (5 signets)
---
600,000 ￼ Silk Bandage (5 signets)
---
24,000 ￼ Thorium Bar (10 signets)
---
20,000 ￼ Arthas' Tears (10 signets)
---
The Horde also had to gather:
---
96,000 ￼ Peacebloom (1 signet)
---
10,000 ￼ Lean Wolf Steak (1 signet)
---
22,000 ￼ Tin Bar (3 signets)
---
250,000 ￼ Wool Bandage (3 signets)
---
19,000 ￼ Firebloom (5 signets)
---
60,000 ￼ Heavy Leather (5 signets)
---
18,000 ￼ Mithril Bar (7 signets)
---
250,000 ￼ Mageweave Bandage (7 signets)
---
60,000 ￼ Rugged Leather (10 signets)
---
10,000 ￼ Baked Salmon (10 signets)
---
I didn't say anything about a reward. There is a reward for PvP. All I'm pointing out is that Classic PvP is not a competition of skill, profession, class, etc - it's a competition of who can spend the most time PvPing and soaking honor.
---
In the aggregate, having engineering isn't going to make that big of a difference when you need to farm 500-1000 HKs a day to keep your rank 12+.
---
I suspect name reservations have made it more difficult to get large groups to migrate because some won't be able to get their names on a new server. People are really attached to their identity. Have you considered cloning the Herod database to a new server? Then a guild could pick the new server without worry of members losing name reservations.
---
Yeah I strictly play holy. I'm also known for sometimes being nearly completepy geared in cloth, lol.
---
Any other heads up on holy playstyle?
---
What are your post Naxx plans? Releasing TBC? Takeing Classic in a new, different direction with orginal content? Periodic resets? Something else?
---
Force close/quit the app and immediately relaunch and you get the new addons without re-queueing. Used to do it all the time back in the day.
---
:O
---
Can’t you make the bucks with stuff like Nightfall, Arcanite Bars and Bullets?
---
Will you hide RaidID's or re-randomize them so RID rolling doesnt happen and we get an HOR or TF the first weeks of their content?
---
Yeah here: https://discord.gg/rN6w9R
---
I believe that was referring to the phase 1 servers, with layering. By phase 5 it should be vanilla size servers.
---
Hi all,
---
Thanks for taking your time out to answer some questions.
---
To preface my question I understand that you may not be able to give specifics but a general overview would be cool!
---
How has the team been preparing for the spike and sustained network traffic that's expected for the launch of Classic? As in have you undergone any network upgrades to your existing networking infrastructure?
---
Have you invested into new DDoS mitigation infrastructure?
---
It'd be cool to see some before and after traffic graphing after launch too!
---
Thanks again
---
(WTS) 
---

---
Pm me! 😊
---
&gt; available when it makes sense to do so and feels relevant to the rest of the available content.
---
For a game with a clear timeline this is very unspecific. I hope you intend to clearly announce new content before it is made available.
---
&gt; Corrupted ashbringer
---
will this be in the game?
---
Nope, i plan on afk botting
---
Hey guys, random question but have you added a way to save your progression on the leveling guides yet?  If not, will it be available by the time classic releases?
---
Pretty sure that is a false negative. But, I mean.. If in doubt.. It's not really worth risking anything over an addon configuration. Thank you for raising the alarm flags. I've had no issues myself and I'm in no way affiliated with the project.   
---
I think, but I'm not sure, there are also some test servers available, much like private servers but with similar setup as Artctium and magos.
---
The thing that worries me the most about layering is how resources like Black Lotus and Devilsaur Leather and the likes will be farmed in absurd quantities by having new level 1 characters transfering a main character to different layers to hog all these resources. They're made to be scarce in-game but an unfortunate side-effect is that this is bypassed by the mechanics of layering.
---
Do you have any plans to combat this?
---
Well I wouldn't lump blizzard in that group. They are the ones who didn't make any where near enough servers. Then made a bunch of nobody named servers and a server named Herod.
---
The music makes it 10 times better and it is synced with the fat dudes moves too looool
---
I suspect u/ogronz means that they won't need to take the servers offline for the 6+ hours that they used to (which was, if memory serves, usually 6:00AM to 11:00AM PST assuming it all went well). Without a doubt they will still do the usual weekly rolling restarts that we have today.
---
Coming from someone dealing with legacy code right now, I'm certain both of these occurred. 
---
I'm also interested in the specifics, but I doubt they'd reveal it.
---
It is my personal opinion.  But I used  [https://itemization.info/](https://itemization.info/)  and looked at every single item per phase and per equipment slot and added everything remotely relevant.
---
isnt there an addon fot that
---
Is this the official big tiddy goth gf server?
---
Because the op you replied to clearly was talking about shareholders with some degree of ownership, not your regular Joe with 1 stock he bought online during the lunch break. So you're either picky or missed his point
---
&gt; Regarding PvP, we saw many posts from players wondering if getting invited to a party is a good way to escape from PvP combat. I’m pleased to say there’s actually a separate, longer transfer delay following any PvP combat. We know a lot of world PvP enthusiasts are excited for WoW Classic, and we don’t want the additional layers to feel like they’re robbing you of your kills. When the time comes to withdraw from the fight, you’ll have to escape from your enemies and get to a safe place before you’re able to join your friends on another layer.
---
So this is what I was worried about doing unknowingly, I was playing out a scenario in my head where I'm strolling through STV skinning some cats and shit and I get ganked, I call up the boys to come defend my honor and when I invite them to group I would get phased out of my layer.
---
If my intentions are to group up and fight back against the opposing alliance all I need to do is be the party leader and invite my friends, not accept invites from them?
---
Just want to clarify, if a friend invites me to a group but **I AM THE ONE ASKING FOR HELP** He will be unable to join in on the PvP because he invited me to HIS layer?
---
Pretty much this, I never, ever use heroic strike unless I have absolutely nothing else I can possible do. Even then you can still spam hamstring because of the super low cost.
---
Just ignore those posts then.
---
Is it possible for a YT mirror? Reddit video's suck for linking in discord. Most people don't bother clicking links.
---
They answered, it won't work
---
Yes!!!  Let the server trash-talking begin!
---
[Nice.](https://i.imgur.com/Fz10Dc2.gifv)
---
So do you think the community would vote on flying again? Do you think they'd vote on LFG again? The outrage that would come out if that poll even was announced let alone allowed to be voted on. It would never happen.
---
Hell, yo ushould see how difficult Jagex is finding it to add a new skill to OSRS. The community is too scared to add one, so they vote no. You are too scared to even reach that point, not realizing that the community is much smarter than you give credit for.
---
Your doomsday feelings are misguided. You are scared of WoW ending up the same as modern, but you fail to realize that the alternatives are to literally kill the game outright. Why not give it a fair shot?
---
Besides, the polls are created by the community. The polls are voted on by the community. The idea would be a limit to what accounts can vote (based on having a character max level or something) so that there is little to no trolling of polls. The idea would be to allow discussion and to vote together. What you are saying is that you are too scared to add anything to the game at all, because the outcome can't be known. That's a foolish sentiment.
---
Are you guys preparing for the potential abuse of RCR?  People are worried that an automated system will lead to bans over world pvp.
---
Good news! Cross realm BG's solve this issue.
---
Hahaha
---
1 + 1 = 2

1 + 0 = 1

That's just like... your opinion, man.

I dont care where you come from as long as you can speak reasonable english in game.  The problem is large numbers of EU people can't.

I have 3 questions:

- Why you are not restoring the pre-1.4 old epic mounts?

- Why aren't you adding back the 1.7 Alterac Valley version, even as an alternative option to choose from through the NPC battlemaster, along with the latest 1.12 AV?

- Why you didn't follow the plan to add back the 8 debuffs limit and then upgrade it to 16 slots only when the expected phase was reached?...
---
- BONUS: Following my reasoning about 1.7 AV, can we have the "impossible" C'Thun raid back in the game as an additional alternative option to choose from too?
---
fan made could be done but may be bannable if you use the client, someone made an HD client for OSRS and it was bannable to use it
---
If you feel guilty you could quit and give me your job and idk go do some heavy lifting sweat inducing job thst will make you feel proud you are actually working hard instead of hardly working but idk up to you
---
Yep.  And then when the next expansion was announced my thought was "all this stuff I'm working towards is going to be shit in a few months...why bother?"
---
Tauren master race lol I think troll is master race !
---
&gt;you can ride the boat from Ratchet to Booty Bay with the same people alongside you the whole way.
---
This always ticks me off a bit in retail.... get on a zeppelin with someone and after the loading screen it's someone completely different. I'll usually mess with people on the zeppelin with toys, pets, emotes, etc. because why not but sharding kinda ruined it
---
yes great set indeed, got that on my r11 warrior back in the day
---
Just a FYI, the 3 character limit for name reservation is ACCOUNT wide :(. I tried to  create a new character on Firemaw, and it returns a "You already have the maximum number of characters allowed on this account."
---
PLEASE reconsider this. #nochanges =/ authentic experience with AQ war event. You can do something for sure !
---
Well, that and the friends list he made along the way
---
Would you consider classic wow to have expansions and go into an alternate time line where 1 choice could have impacted the game in a big way? It might make it easier to make expansions for the alt universe, plus it could be a nice way to keep players in low rate server like classic!
---
Do not underestimate the nature of classic wow. In all likelihood server populations will be high then dip quickly then increase again over time and this increase will be permanent. Its mechanics foster player bonds which keep people coming back. Raid bosses don't keep people coming back, friends do.
---
Vanilla cap.
---
Well I respect your view, I enjoyed playing TBC first time around and on a certain other server. In my ideal world we'll get the option to copy our characters over to the next expansion while retaining the original to experience future original content. But I doubt that'll happen :(
---
Please answer this
---
Please clarify whether this means drop % or actual item drop tables. Changing mageblade drop % when more items get added to the table isn't that big of a deal, changing whether bindings drop in Phase 1 is entirely different.
---
that could be synonymous with 'let the banning begin'.
---
Anyone else find it funny that a bunch of people (nearly 400) upvoted this? BFA players that never played it and are scared of working for their gear hahah
---
Great news
---
Haven't heard anything about that. I am just now realizing this potential issue too. Higher populations means those resources would be more rare than vanilla and prices could reflect that. It depends on the server population after layering ends, which may or may not be larger than what people experienced in vanilla (though I think it is still likely to be larger).
---
Oh... right, they're doing that garbage. Guess it'll be Horde, then...
---
That would be unfortunate for you.  The system has gotten much better at finding them.  Consider using another method like TeamViewer to prelog.  The AFK bot was heavily abused then persued a while back and they are really good at finding them now.
---
Ifs is extremely clear that your own perceived self entitlement is to blame here, not blizzard. Move or queue, you have been warned.
---
Stop acting like a child and grow up.
---
Got "Gamora" , "Groot" and "Mvp" on Firemaw :)
---
and this is a in-depth (and far too long) TL;DR about those:
---
1) Why you are not restoring the pre-1.4 old epic mounts?
---
Some months ago Brian said they will not be made available again in Classic:
---
- *"[...]because we don't want to incentivize people to a playstyle that they would not otherwise choose for their first level up experience. If someone comes into World of Warcraft, and we say, 'Hey, you can only get this mount if you get to level 60 and get all this gold in the first month...', we don't want to force that on anybody. We want to make sure that everybody that comes back plays at their own pace that they feel is most comfortable."*
---
But earlier at Blizzcon, Ion Hazzikostas himself said: 
---
- *"The second we start to substitute our modern judgement... we are deviating from our goal of a historical recreation of the game as it was."* https://youtu.be/hhKkP8LryYM?t=1915
---
Another blue post also stated:
---
- *"Developers have scoured through vendor lists and treasure tables for items that were added in patches, and then attached them to the staged content unlock plan."*
---
The exceptions to this were the old mounts themselves (they are still items nonetheless).
---
**A]** What I don't honestly get is why now people's different playstyles became a variable dictating how the game itself should be made. If the team is striving to get at least 90% accurate, it should be still close to that threshold, and not falling back to 75% just because that mounts grind doesn't seems healthy enough for everyone.
---
Should we then ban people aiming at R14 cause it will bring them to the brink of death? (it won't by the way)
---
Who decides that Bob’s rushing to 60 experience isn’t worth any consideration while Phil’s chilling and stopping smelling roses will be the truly one?
---
None of them will be forced to rush through the early phases unless they're willingly doing it on purpose to get that mount, and those who are won't be players planning to take their time leveling anyway, since they know they can always do that later on on an alt, already accepting that fact alone.
---
This sounds really elitist but I'm the complete opposite of that behaviour since I'm an altoholic myself and I know very well how to take my time planning my characters traits/professions/etc and enjoying the game at a slower pace when I want to (even spending 2 whole weeks just to find a name that fits well the physical features for the character I chose to make, before starting playing it). And with all the due respect to any people interested in RP, I'm not into RP myself.
---
Blaming people zerging through the content regarding how "wrong" they play the game, means you'll also have to blame the entire WoW speedleveling community aiming to hit 60 for the same reason then, and that's total nonsense in my opinion.
---
**B]** Brian openly stated that it would be interesting to add back the Blood Plague just for a bit when the time comes to let people have experience of that scenario since many have never done so before (100% agree on this)
---
Now, we got to know that the main leitmotif about classic was "restoring things like they were supposed to be during vanilla" but if you adopt the same logic based on the decision to completely discard the Old Mounts from being added in Classic, then from here on out you would be forced to:
---
- not let the Blood Plague happen again in the first place (it wasn't there in 1.12.1),
---
- have AQ gates opening event already completed at launch, with AQ20/40 free to be entered (they weren't closed in 1.12.1),
---
- not let the Scourge Invasion happen later on (it wasn't there in 1.12.1)...
---
...and this is a logical nonsense.
---
**What the people want (the few/many/etc, name it) is to mainly re-experience what they have missed, and the first and foremost things are limited-time events like these, not just the ones you can still do 1 year later after the launch.**
---
If you remove the old mounts from the game, giving excuses about the fact many will feel forced to power grind their way to 60 as soon as possible you are completely denying to all the other players a piece of that cake you want to faithfully restore.
---
This is real, those were considered as status symbols, like R14 and AQ mount were too and Vanilla/Classic already has so few of them from the start.
---
R14 and AQ are basically out of reach for everyone but that 0,01% of players alone, while anyone else could get an old epic mount more easily in comparison, they just need to put a bit of effort in it. 
---
*Classic is not a game that holds your hand 24/7, and should still be like this, otherwise nothing done in-game wouldn't have any meaningful value.*
---
There were no achievements in Vanilla, you made them up yourself by knowing how cool and unconventional was walljumping through SW/ORGR, getting exalted with the Bloodsail Buccaneers for no reason or riding another faction mount.
---
That's what makes the world feel alive and what makes character progression feel so good, keep them available for a limited time, just like they did back then.
---
Personally I want to play a game where your efforts matter something at least; where not everyone could easily get AQ mount, R14, or an old epic mount.
---
It doesn't matter if then Blizzard chooses to add them with the in-game shop and then many other will get them. I value my effort more than anything else cause it's a feeling of having achieved something for myself in the first place to which I still have to give a definitive closure in this regard.
---
**Players cared (and still care) about those mounts cause, for one reason or another, they couldn't play retail vanilla until after they got removed or TBC/WotLK came out, and so they'd like to have another chance at them in Classic.**
---
At the end, it's just a matter of visual appearance, but the old ones are the same as the new ones, despite the new ones look worse in comparison.
---
On this aspect I want to take another game as an example:
---
- Warframe is a F2P game that gave its Founders an exclusive reward, being Excalibur Prime, that is no longer obtainable, but still considered as status symbol among the entire playerbase despite a new special and stronger warframe has also been given to all other players (Excalibur Umbra).
---
The stats of the latter are higher than Excalibur Prime but just the fact alone that the former is no longer available and it has a special appearance still gives prestige to the people who own it.
---
I want to quote **obligatory_'s** comment on another thread related to the same issue that I found very enlightening:
---
&gt; - Like OP says, keeping the old mount/skill system for the entirety of Classic means the mounts themselves will be **prohibitively expensive**, making having more than one an even bigger status symbol. **Getting them won't be trivialised by having expensive riding skills but cheap mounts**, which, if push comes to shove, you could just buy and hold on to until you can afford the actual skill.
---
&gt;&gt; - They are just that, **status symbols**. They are simply visually different from other epic mounts. I feel like **that makes them much more inconsequential to have in the game than say, gear suddenly having different stats when your realm moves on to the next phase**. So why not allow players this small, inconsequential throwback to Vanilla times...?
---
&gt;&gt; - ...because when there is content in the game to achieve, people will try to achieve it, and will bitch and moan when the possibility to achieve it gets taken away from them. This leads to players feeling pressured into having to achieve the goal while it's still possible, the main problem Blizzard wants to avoid apparently. HOWEVER - this bullet point isn't an argument in favour of having Old School Epic Mounts so far, lol - I personally feel this argument is weakened by quite a bit simply by there being **no achievement system in Classic** and the game being much slower, not to say tedious, than retail. I'm gonna go out on a limb and say **completionists will be MUCH much rarer since collecting stuff just for the sake of it will in no way be reflected by your character or account status, and the amount of people that are going to end up disappointed will be much lower than the amount of people who would be happy for having them in**.
---
&gt;&gt; - In any case, there is always, still, the simplest solution: just keep them in indefinitely, alongside the newer ones. Yes, that diminishes their value (again, purely prestige) down to that of regular epic mounts, but IMHO this would still be a better option than not having them at all, in which case their value would be zero due to being nonexistent, and it would allow people who like them for their actual looks to get them. Personally, I don't care about the rarity aspect at all, but I think the unarmored Night Elf mounts and the Ivory Raptor are the prettiest mounts in the game, and I would still go get them even if they were in forever - I just like the looks. **I would take literally any option instead of not having them at all**.
---
Yes it sucked that I missed my character name but it was definitely a vanilla wow experience :) :) :)
---
&gt;I think even the most die hard of the #nochanges crowd think that keeping the mats the same is a bad idea.
---
Wrong.  Stop trying to micromanage.
---
True, we all wanted them in the end it broke the core of what was Vanilla.
---
RP servers are such a waste.
---
I moved from Shazz, tried to get the name Alice, gone.  
---
Life is pain.
---
Coolio,  
---
So my question is, do you have any plans on changing jump spots and similar things in BGs? As they can create an unfair advantage or change meta hide spots or heal spots that the majority of players cannot deal with. I'll link an example of Stormling doing it during the Classic Beta:  
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Noj-ACoX4&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Noj-ACoX4&amp;feature=youtu.be)   
---
Timestamps 00:02, 07:27, 11:43. Hell even Swifty gets annoyed (1:24) when he faces that guy as Stormling is a druid who is probably top tier at these kinds of things. I think certain spots can definitely upset the balance in BGs, especially vs classes who have no counter to this or cannot get up there due to limited movement vs. for example a druid.  
---
Also thank you to everyone (mods, devs, players) who made this all happen. Hyped!
---
Are there any wow classic realms located at the Chicago data center?
---
Is there a way you can release a EST PVP Server, that is locked, and allow the Herod Pop to transfer over without risking the name reservation? Keep it locked for a day, then open it up once people have transferred. The rumors of 10K+ Player queue is crazy, and we need an alternative!
---
More time for shitposting! The true competitive scene in wow classic!
---
Will Hunters be able to abuse DM tribute solo runs? I know this was able to be done in classic but unsure if it was ever patched before 1.12.  I know Private servers nerfed it regardless
---
After the first hype, do you plan to pool severs in case of them getting too empty?
---
And will there be an API for the auction house?
---
I was so hoping they would of released classic during our summer break, but no! The first damn day back to work. Ugh.
---
Thread isn’t about hating runescape, it’s about not making a Warcraft subreddit part runescape. It’s about not implementing features from a browser game, even if it’s players think it’s a good idea. Reading is hard
---
shut up
---
He just /mquit his marriage and is now in prime position for a do over. 
---
I was option 1. Week of pto already slated and have the vast knowledge of the game. I am ready.
---
Hello! How many new PVP servers do you plan on rolling out before launch (ballpark) to handle the influx of players?
---
I think it will need to scale beyond just the pop growth. because NOW people know what to stockpile and will do it for a long time before. When AQ event dropped in Vanilla no one knew what to expect till it dropped and there was this mad scramble. The only way to recreate this is to tell people right now, that they will change both in what is required and how much but not say what. That way unless you want to stock pile ungodly amounts of EVERYTHING, which is hard to do. we will just have to wait to see what and how much we need and scramble, just like before.  
---
The reason I say we need to say RIGHT NOW that it WILL change is so people dont stock pile what WAS required and that is now not required leaving people with a ton of stuff they don't need.
---
cool
---
What action bar addons is that?
---
I saw this shit all the time in Vanilla and TBC. Every time I was in org there'd be skeletons or bodies spelling out a gold selling sites or some edgelord spelling the n word.
---
This isn't a bug they're capped to the global tick timer like any other command.
---
I got fired for not turning up on a day I had asked off a long time previous. They said I couldn't have it off because someone who doesn't work on anything to do with my job also had it off, and then someone from my area asked for it off after me, and got it off, so I just didn't turn up. Management playing favourites isn't happening with me.
---
Best thing I ever did was getting out of that job, so YMMV.
---
Thank you for this amazing response!
---
One followup, so you can't abuse node spawns with the logouts, but can it be abused with swapping layers via party?
---
Such a whiny little kid, you are.
---
Have fun sitting in that queue :)
---
I'm not a lawyer but that should totally work. Imo
---
Only people patient enough to enjoy fishing will read it all the way to the end.  It's sneaky genius.
---
I wanted to avoid repetition
---
You got me all hyped up now...  Gonna be hell trying to decide.
---
I'm going Orc on my warlock so maybe I should do Tauren to change it up...
---
Yeah, I had planned to take August 27th to Sept 3rd, so I would’ve had an entire week.
---
That guide literally talks about three different specs, and that speed leveling build is closer to the holy build than standard shadow builds.
---
im pretty concerned about hunter scattershot sharing a DR with frozen trap. i realize the bug was there during your snapshot, but ruining scattershot because it was bugged during a small window of vanilla seems silly. melee leeway also scares me. is this stuff going to still be addressed or is it final? i want to play a hunter like i did in vanilla but if its going to be a nerfed down version compared to most of vanilla I'll have to pass.
---
It's Lovely. You are the bomb.
---
Please enlighten me. Do you think you'd have any better chance to get a girl's attention than a guy's? I mean, c'mon. Let's be honest with ourselves...
---
When you heal as druid, you should make sure you take someone with your who can rezz, so you can use your one rezz on him and he can rez the rest.
---
I want to thank the team for bringing back the Collector's Edition pets. It's so much fun running around Classic with the same pets I had in vanilla. Any plans on bringing back Murky?
---
If it’s ok you’d stop crying to me and come to terms with the fact that idiots like you made OSRS into RS3v2
---
My biggest concern going into the game as a 10 hour a week, "casual", is that there are a number of "hardcore" players who know the game inside and out who will be ready to maximize every move and make everything optimal. Are any contingencies/classic friendly changes going in place to deal with the inevitable inbalancing that will come with this?
---
You can play on even the slowest smart fridges
---
Honestly I completely agree with you. Class halls specifically, I didn’t care much for the garrisons.
---
Classic is definitely going to be popular and have it’s niche but I think once the Vanilla phase cycle is done and they announce what is coming after is when we’ll see if it has the power to over take retail. If they go down the Classic+ route i genuinely believe the sceptics will be more inclined to give it ago.
---
They could make all the required mats be unique event versions of the mats that only start to drop when the event starts.
---
But 1 million hours *specifically* fixing bugs and exploits that existed during *vanilla*? Come on now...
---
Do not really have a question, just wanted to say thank you. It is nice to see developers going back to basics. Nothing fancy, no in game shops, no craziness...just a flat out amazing gaming experience.
---
I am.
---
I have so much to get done irl, but instead what I did was simply work on my WoW prep.
---
I'm coming back to wow because of this. Haven't played seriously since wrath. Thank you.
---
Yes, classic wow is a far more social experience than current retail wow.
---
Sidenote, if you happen to be on the same server as me I'd be happy to provide some assistance in game.
---
Will any of the new wow features be available in the future? And also how far the classic will Go? Can we expect some expansions coming out again or will the game stay as it is?
---
No, most of us have grown up and no longer feel the need to miss work or put off relationships to play a video game
---
Jains with white hair?  That’s not vanilla
---
Oh I agree, I don't believe there will be that much bleed off.  But this was the number floating around for ages from both blizzard and players.  I on the other hand starkly disagree with it, but we cannot see the future.  So I guess they just keep course.
---
Copy*
---
Let the character stay put on the Classic server
---
Level as either arms or fury. Prot is not needed for tanking and the talent points are usually better spent elsewhere as leveling as prot is quite ineffective solo. Respecc at 58 if you want to primarily tank dungeons.
---
[Here is an arms build (notice the talent order)](https://www.bobo-talents.com/?c=warrior&amp;t=qfrqrryKyLqlryrzrArBqmqisYslsxsHySyTyMyNqjyOp-rIrJrKrLqcrsrtqkqCsyszsAsBqGsKsLsMsNqFqDsmsnsoqzs-tatbtc) that is quite focused around tanking as it prioretizes Deflection, improved heroic strike and improved demoralizing as early as possible while still picking up the really good talents like sweeping strikes at the right levels.
---
What are you anticipating in terms of a greater influx of players as we get closer to launch compared to players that subbed for the stress test and name reservations?
---
[I made this a while ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bwlity/someone_posted_this_map_here_a_while_ago_and_ive/epye2d8/) out of the map you linked, since it contains TONS of spelling errors. Mine is 100% spelling error free.
---
Well we don't know what the "full" threshold is. If shazzrah has gone from 30k to 25k (pulling those numbers from my arse) and the "full" threshold is 20k for example, shazzrah would still be full but 5k less.

The Untamed Blade is almost as good and much easier to get. And it looks cooler
---
TBC along with MoP, is my favorite expansion, so yea, I want TBC.
---
Sucked out all the fun? I've no idea what you're talking about, I loved walking in people's faces with pvp tag on watching them misclick and get absolutely wrecked by a bunch of terminator goblins.
---
i mean first week will have loads of server issues so its inefficient
---
This is good to hear. To those who are concerned about how terrible the experience of gathering world buffs is, then you have the option to not use them. None of the content in Vanilla requires world buffs. If you don't want to spend an hour before each raid running around the world, then you have the option to convince your guild to not do so. Outside of the top 0.01% of guilds that will be doing speedruns, no guild needs world buffs to clear content.
---
can very much relate lol
---
Very nice painting.
---
Farming in Felwood and Winterspring paid for my epic mount. I never really touched Azshara during Vanilla.
---
Make a list of the addons now, download them all, and finally disable them before logging in if you care about getting a "headstart".
---
It's ok. You don't know what you're talking about. :)
---
well well well, beanposters and spaniards think they can play on shazzrah eu. well mr amphetameme says NO you cannot. I will have you know that he is top shazzposter and the best druid on the horde. the spaniards can go to gehennas where they belong because newsflash... no one likes you, amigo. flag es. point right. door. REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
New PvE servers when
---
What's your code to release pipeline?
---
This... This is what makes me jealous of PC gaming. That is a killer set up
---
I moved from shazz too, tried my name and my friends name, both gone within 1 min. :&lt;
---
TF, HoR and Atiesh. Those 3 are the only ones
---
This. I appreciate you calling out contradictory behavior.
---
I like to believe that it was around the new year in 1999.  The last sheet of A4 bright white printer paper was sitting inside of a printer at metzen's desk. The clock hit 12am and the printer whirled up.  
---
It large green letters it said.  
---
**GROBMOB 2019**
---
This is how it all started and eventually led to the where we are at today.
---
Just because you switch server doesn't mean you delete your old character. I moved to Gehennas and kept my Shazzrah character. Now I'm moving to firemaw and keeping both my other characters
---
Looks cool. Is one computer gaming and other work? Or both ready for gaming
---
On my second week of uselessness. Literally just on this sub all day until someone comes in. And even then, I send 'em to the next guy sometimes.
---
This is true.  I remember popping sprint and stealthing through hunter flares to try and get the cheapshot off on the hunter sitting in the flare before the flare revealed me.  It didn't always work but if you got lucky with the timing then you could pull it off.
---
well, the r10 set looks good as well. With the horde r10 is just a recolor of r13
---
Yeah now *that's* understandable. I'm always curious about this stuff as a programmer/once-aspiring game dev, so it'd be nice for everything to just be shareable. At the same time, WoW fans have a long, storied history of overthinking and over-optimizing their choices based on data like this. Meanwhile, IIRC the whole point of the Low/Med/High/Full system is to dynamically estimate long-term realm population in such a way that will be more useful for players' decision process than (most) players could come up with themselves even if the server published those threshold values along with precise "online now" statistics hourly. Meanwhile people would freak out every time a given reset had lower average population than the one before it. So I can understand them being gun-shy.
---
Yeaaah feel you
---
We are working hard on having a saving ability working by release for the guide because we know it's a pain to find your spot again.
---
Make a main on one server as Horde and play casually with your friends as Alliance on another.
---
I'm trying to remember what it was. For some reason, I think it was tied into an addon that made two thin bars the whole length of the top and bottom of your screen that would show xx/50 bag slots, rep, xp, armor score, stuff like that.
---
Or y'know, just wear whatever you want.
---
Why isn't there a designated button for the game? All the other games on the battle.net launcher have icons except classic wow. I think that might be a cause for confusion for people that aren't up to date on classic news. Also it keeps the game on your mind if you always see it when you open up the launcher, thereby contributing to the game's longevity.
---
idk, the power levels of the game are insane atm. DWH, PoH restore all stats and teleport anywhere. The slowest skill being like 80k xp/hr with most skills being in the 300k/hr range. Sure we don't have MTX or the horrible cosmetics but OSRS is very close to 2013 runescape. Power level wise we are above it already.
---
We want 12 hour downtimes with 4 hours planned and extensions every 2 hours!!! #nochanges

Cry me a fucking river. Are you recreating the Classic experience or a sugar flavored one? What the fuck.

How are you going to handle the massive player drop off once people figure out that old wow was trash too and see that no improvements have been made?
---
Just a sub dont need bfa :)

What add-ons will be available for people on the RP server? I plan on rolling an RP server for the first time and it looks like add-ons play a big role. Thanks!
---
Aren't they? It's a different game. You aren't using RMT but you are still using an outside currency (BfA Gold) to purchase Classic currency. You would also break ToS if you exchanged BfA Gold for, say, FF14 Gil. A different game, but the ToS does not cover only RMT.

Hey guys! I'm super late to the party but I haven't seen this addressed yet so I wanted to ask:
---
I saw on the beta that people who own the original World of Warcraft Collector's Edition were able to have the pets that came with that edition. Is there any plan to re-introduce the original collector's edition or maybe even the TCG loot cards from vanilla? I would love to sit and farm winter squid in my Fishing Chair. Thank you!
---
Haha for sure I wish I acted differently, my 14 year old mind was to whisper him asking for gold.. lol. Isn’t it funny how we remember some in game moments so well
---
Can't argue against this...
---
Whatever man I’m just playing a warlock to do the same shit anyways. Summoning stones are great.
---
It's spell crit, not physical or ranged crit like the leader of the pack buff.
---
&gt;female tauren
---
why tho
---
It's a common marketing technique, if noone notices your announcement, just announce again. Chances that someone will call you out on it are low since only few noticed your first announcement anyway.
---
The Ultramarine mount exists in retail as an Archaeology reward if I really wanted to ride a Qiraji scarab.
---
I just think it's a **really, really, really shitty idea** to not change the requirements or the reward for a world event that only rewards a single player per server. Especially when that world event could be over in a matter of minutes as opposed to weeks thanks to pre-preparation and player knowledge.
---
Right, and when most people say “global” few are actually referring to one global. If you can kill a person in a few seconds, I would consider that being globaled.
---
Thanks for doing this AMA, REALLY looking forward to playing next week!
---
Q: How big is the player count gap between a "High" server and a "Full" server? Is there a specific threshold?
---
Robes of Arugal...
---
Every fucking time it drops it gets ninja-ed from me
---
It's based on weapon damage, not the ability damage itself.
---
Source is from a guild leader who were in the Nordic collusion, and have connections to the various nationalities’ hubs on EU whom updates where each Hub is located.
---
I would have read those ama answers before posting this..
---
Actually the opposite, it feels good to get some work done and out of the way so next week I have more time for WoW
---
It's two entirely different games. You can transfer your character to the BC realm, so the gold you have and are bringing forward can't be a big deal if we allow that. You can also choose to keep it where it is, so the gold staying put isn't a big deal either.
---
The BC and Classic realms would be two distinct realms, completely independent of each other. How on earth would the character and gold existing in both places have any effect on each other? This still makes absolutely no sense.
---
Wholesome dude
---
Yeah that's what I'm sacred of is joining a steamer sever and not like the game bc of that
---
I'd be fine with them releasing additional TBC realms after Classic has been out a while. Either allow certain characters to Opt In to automatic transfers to a realm with TBC content enabled, or create Fresh Start realms with TBC content. 
---
After that, who knows. Wrath was great, but it was the beginning of the tipping point of making WoW go downhill. The over "casualization" of the game was not a good thing.
---
Wait lmao but you were just talking about a spellweavers turbin though which is +9 intellect + 36 spell/healing +1% hit
---
Are you saying that's BiS until t2 for ret?
---
Your icon shows paladin , it's quite confusing.
---
Affliction Warlock leveling was very interesting because not only COULD you fight two or even three mobs at once, but with the nature of dots, it was actually significantly faster than doing it one at a time.  (Yet it wasn't as picky location wise as Mage AoE grinding).  There are other classes who can fight a couple mobs at a time if they have to, but it isn't faster than fighting them one at a time.
---
     
---
That meant there was a reason to actually challenge yourself and need to keep your brain active as you constantly solved challenges.  There was always incentive to push yourself closer to potential failure to go even faster.    
---
      
---
One of my friends leveled a warlock and said it was great because he basically never died.  I had the opposite experience, I died the most, because I figured if I didn't die once every two hours or so, I wasn't pushing myself enough.
---
I'm not assuming that at all. You just seem uninformed. People have already used layering to farm the same node across layers. Just because a layer has other people on it doesn't mean that someone is going to stand at an empty node waiting for it to respawn. No one does that unless they know when it will respawn.

---
how...
---
Yeah but the volume of people trying to play at once always dies down. Every xpac has shown that. Thats a reason people are so unwilling to leave Herod. Because what launch is all said and done it will likely be amongst the most healthy servers in regards to pop, especially when those joining just for the hype realize how much harder it is to do anything compared to live and quit.
---
Those are all honest observations from a gamer who has played the game extensively, as well as many other MMOs on the market. Do not hate any game, but I will assess it as honestly and thoroughly as I can. You’re quote is of said honest observations.
---
What kind of quality of life will be added into classic later on? I heard talk of things such as guild banks and achievements being made available or at least in speculation of being so.
---
We have a Dutch guild in Shazzrah, Alliance Side Already 400 members.
---
Too bad Cataclysm was terrible in so many other ways.  They may have added Uldum, but every quest is based around Harrison Jones and terribly unfunny movie references.. everything is slapstick to an absurd level.  And it was obviously designed for flying mounts.
---
They'd basically have to rework the entire zone to make it fit thematically with vanilla.
---
He needs to spend more time on this sub, he’d know the people who really know how it works have already proven to us Classic is a dead game because of layering. Because Blizz bad

Default UI Master race. Most immersive. I've moved player and target frames, and have some addons of course, but try to keep the UI looking the same. I can't believe people actually want addons to remove the gryphons. I would use more UI changing addons if there was an addon to re-add the gryphons.
---
The best part of this staff is creating portals at the end of raid and watching how many people end up in the wrong zone.
---
What.....? What does people quitting have anything to do at all with the amount of servers you START out with? They STILL have no idea how many people are quitting.
---
It's not remotely necessary. It's a brash heavy-handed solution to an incredibly rare problem. Punishing millions from the crimes of several dozen at best is a horrible philosophy. 
---
That all being said, I accept that Blizzard is hyper sensitive and idiotic at times so I agree that the proposed solution would be a great compromise. The immersion created by copious skeletons is not diminished by a random orientation so if Blizzard wants to pretend this is a real problem, then at least this is a more elegant fix.
---
1. Doing well. Thanks for asking!
---
2. I’m currently obsessed with the poutine at a local restaurant, which has short rib on it.

Are there any NEW Easter eggs that weren't there originally?
---
Regarding Phases: What is the projected timeframes for releasing the different phases of WoW Classic? That being said, what are the long term plans after the last phase has been released? Start back from the beginning of phase 1?
---
I am just getting the background map image when opening up the link. Is something wrong or just me?
---
They definitely can.
---
What I'm saying is: a single realm can probably hold the character and account information of everyone on earth that plays WoW, therefore there is no account cap to disclose.  You can still choose to roll on the realm even if it has 10,000,000 accounts on it, the server doesn't care - Blizzard is just saying that their population cap (which definitely exists) isn't going to accommodate 10,000,000 people at once.
---
Why settle for Classic TBC when you could get excited for Classic Cata?
---
I just picked horde and put my name in as quickly as possible. I'll change it before the 26th.
---
You mean like Bioshock?
---
So it's like reposting when your shit gets deleted for being a repost, and hoping a different mod is around that doesn't delete it!
---
this is the point of the questline and the mount that is the reward; o ly the most hardcore players will get it and it should stay that way
---
I have a feeling deep down that classic won’t keep me hooked until 60. Only one of my friends that I played with is jumping back in. Getting to stv and pvping is probably my endgame.
---
Can you provide any additional information on the length (weeks/months) of phase 1 and phase 2? Thanks! /u/ZoidWoW
---
The 3 man scenarios are available from loremasters above the palace.
---
No one asked you to memorize anything nor did anyone claim to know it off the top of their head. It's common sense that Classic, being rebuilt with the modern engine under its hood, is going to require more power.
---
Even if you do get it going on that Chromebook, it's going to run terribly.
---
I'm not your enemy, I'm not against classic+, I'm not campaigning to defeat you.
---
I'm extrapolating data from past and current events to project the future, and with the information laid before us, like the economics, risks, proven support, player behaviour etc. 
---
I'm not saying that OSRS wasn't a success, or that what they're doing isn't working. I'm saying that not only is it a risk to carbon copy the system over to Classic, it's too great a risk compared to moving on because not enough noise has been made. It has no proven support and is a potential money drain due to the nature of game development.
---
You say I have doomsday feelings, but our stances are very similar. Without X/Y happening, the game dies. You believe that classic needs post-classic updates to stave off death, and I believe that it needs to move on to TBC. We both want to see the game survive, even if our convictions differ. We're not spelling its doom, we're hoping for a bright future.
---
Again, I'm not your enemy, but the race IS over. The future of Classic will be decided in the next few months, and only economically viable options will be explored. Classic+ has no chance of happening at this point because the Classic+ community didn't come together in the past 20 months to campaign for the cause.
---
will there be a boxed version for wow classic
---
The guilds on my server (Haomarush) were still clearing BWL, and an entire guild transferred over and proceeded to open the gates of AQ and it really killed the servers raiding community. I'm not really sure what the best solution to this issue would be, but please be careful with character transfers!
---
yep, time to update the site after the AMA!
---
Hunter all the way. Theres some LBRS farming you could do for a while that was nice for Rogue. Warrior isnt super bad but i did my AQ farming on one so it really burnt me out.

Assuming `/run DoEmote("bow")` on its own does work, I would try removing the parentheses around `DoEmote("bow")`. That's the best guess I can give without being at my PC.

Will there be progression servers?

Yes, it's Pre-BIS for ret/spelladin. +36 spell is great.

Thanks for the iteration and the write up clarifying layering!

This is about my day. I alternate hours basically. 1 on reddit, 1 on work, 1 on classic wowhead, 1 on work, 1 back on reddit, 1 on work, 1 on discord/reddit/classic wowhead, .5 end of day fluttering about with work that needs done on a daily, .5 lunch, .5 "breaks" welp time to go.
---
Super hyped about this!
---
Big true true.
---
If Classic WoW is successful enough to move forward, releasing TBC and WotLK, what would come next?
---
Is it most likely that no new updates would be released afterwards? The game would move on to Cata and MoP, but with changes to the updates they made that were controversial or harmed the overall game? A new expansion pack designed to be in the same vein as Vanilla, TBC and WotLK?
---
Have you considered a playerbase polling system, similar to the one that Jagex uses to decide updates for OSRS (where new changes require a supermajority vote), in order to ensure new content is desired by the majority of the playerbase?
---
I have been trying to work around my schedule, so i do more work this week to be able to work less next week. And especially work from home next week, so they can se me online but not what im doing!
---
WOW why this shit isn't in any tutorial? it seems like a no-brainer to do, maybe Vanilla wasn't really that much explored on private server.
---
There are a few addons that do this. Probably the best is Informant, which is included as part of the Auctioneer Addon suite. Auctioneer is still actively developed for retail, but no word yet on if they're porting it to Classic. The old 1.12 version won't work anymore, and if you try to load the current suite, you will get lots of errors. If you unzip the addon package and install just the included addons "Stubby" and "Informant" you will get most of the basic info like quest/profession use, and individual/full stack/current stack vendor price.
---
"The truth is, people as a *collective* are more intelligent than any individual."
---
This is false. Some individuals will take better decisions than the collective.
---
But when other individuals could take extremely bad decision, using a collective approach can help to reach a sufficiently good choice.
---
A collective can also be completely wrong and vote for something it will regret, that's also another risk. But it might still be the best thing to do.
---
You're right. It could be solved rather easily though, just introduce a 6 month CD per character to race changing, or more.

What’s the better class for pvp as a horde mage? Troll or undead?
---
Do you guys plan on keeping zones like Hyjal and such that you could jump in to when exploring accessible? i know back in the day they didnt want us in those zones because they were unfinished, but it would be cool to be able to explore what they originally looked like without having to worry about bans.
---
I remember twinking a hell of a lot and exploring new areas just because it was fun. That was a huge part of the game. As far as pvp goes: AV was just the eternal zerg and not much fun to me. AV and WG were pretty much what you'd expect. Only thing is that, other than in later expansions, you wouldn't really get many (or any) relevant rewards out of it unless you invested a lot of time to rank up.
---
World pvp in Strangle, especially near the arena, was rampant. People also liked to camp the Blackrock to kill some raiders.
---
Other than that, a lot of "end game" was just farming dungeons and farming for gold, especially because few people knew effective ways of getting shit done and just did the first thing they could think of. Also, raiding was more chaotic and many people had just no idea what to do. Though maybe that hasn't changed as much, lol. But managing two score people is obviously more challenging than managing a dozen of them, possibly explaining the simpler mechanics, back then.
---
what's it referring to?
---
Yeah I know.  I just like numbers.
---
I just hope it's Sylvanas' old voice actor, I hate the new one.
---
This is absolutely magnificent, would you mind if i try to record myself reading it and post it here?
---
Wasa is the brand dude
---
Will u ever at the old wow launcher back just as a fun gig? I would like to see it even just for one day
---
They've kept the mission table system for three expansions now. Each time they "improve" it, which is to say "phase it out a little more". That's one legacy system I can't *wait* until we're done with.
---
While I agree the original records are there to stay, I can also see why this is a different game and thus could have its own race.
---
Seriously. This was uncalled for. Slap in the face, Blizz.
---
Should I play night elf or dwarf hunter?
---
awesome ty!
---
They likely come from a game where currency is the end game. 
---
Like black desert,  where end game is grinding for silver to buy better gear.
---
&gt;this sub
---
No one but the most absolute retards believed this and they were always downvoted. Don't act like it was the whole subreddit.
---
So your saying they gave you plenty of notice to adapt to the situation before it became a problem.  I agree with that fully.
---
Yes, that’s obvious. But so is gaining 20% (40% at r2)attack speed throughout your grinding experience. You speak like I said evisc is never worth the energy, but I’ll reiterate, it’s easy to maintain and sometimes is the OBVIOUS choice between the two skills. You do you, but it’ll be blatantly slower.
---
On behalf of the WoW team, thank you all for taking the time today to post your questions, suggestions, and support for WoW Classic. There were a lot of great posts and we'll be poring over all of them. Your guidance is important to us and much appreciated.  
---
We're eagerly anticipating launch day and joining all of you in Classic Azeroth.
---
1 click.
---
a lot of engineering items required you to have a certain level of engineering just to use them. for what purpose are you going engineering? i only took engineering for PvP on my warrior. also for the lulz (gnomish death ray and mind control). it wasn't cheap on my server. that was over a decade ago and i have no clue how the new economy will be. leveling crafting in generally can be expensive so the best route for me was to gather up to 60 and drop one for engineering.
---
i never had issues leveling herbalism. if i ever made an alt in durotar, i'd run them to mulgore as i enjoy leveling there the most.
---
Just like the community prevented overpowered items like claws and bulwarks and blowpipes and elysians from being implemented into the game 😂 
---
There’s a reason why the US founders made us into a republic and not a democracy. The fact that you call that reasoning dumb goes to show you are the type of person actually intelligent thinkers need to worry about.
---
In the Shadows - The Rasmus 
---
Epic raid or grinding tune 🤘🏻
---
Thank you for the welcome!
---
Won't this chance since hit cap is supposed to be lower? Replacingsome of those hit pieces with crit pieces?
---
I don't think that's how layers work. They put them in to lessen the load on the servers in overcrowded areas (like the starting areas at launch). Once people disperse over the whole world, the total population of the server can stay the same and they still would remove layers until there is only one left, keeping the pop at the increased limit.
---
IRL would be dangerous. ;)) But otherwise I agree somewhat.
---
 Just so I didn't misunderstood you. The stubby and Informant you used came from the retail Auctioneer right? And not the 1.12.1 Auctioneer?
---
Wow seems like troll is getting worse and worse as I find out more information lol
---
Right, I definitely feel the nostalgia of having masses of skeletons in the ground after PvP events, and not having this in classic would be a bummer.
---
Why use many word when few word do trick
---
Of course I can’t speak for everyone, but in my friend group it’s pretty big. My friend had a 3rd slot for an empty name and I thought he would hold the name for me so I gave him a name idea. Turns out he liked the name and decided to keep it and won’t give it back
---
a really cool stream if they had programmed a Spectating system conttrolled by gms, devs, maybe even player entities in the future if they manage to add more crazy big event like content that would be entertaining to both viewers and players. a whole revolution in gaming entertainment could be possible here
---
You dont have to buy BFA just create an EU account and pay the 30$ a month.
---
Not sure why I expected to read anything other than, nice, in the comments.
---
Can you just use laying in order to have multiple expacs on one and the same server ? Ie a classic layer and a tbc layer?
---
Yeah I do, but I edited my post to satisfy your desires JUST FOR FUN
---
homie, i did naxx40 and am super hyped for classic. i'll more than likely never touch live wow again, but am 100% looking forward to the vanilla experience. pretty sure just because you feel a certain way doesn't mean that's the norm.
---
Nostalgia and re experiencing isn't the only thing! I just honestly want to enjoy a great mmorpg.
---
Hunter&gt; rogue = mage
---
Will pets that had "caster" stats be fixed so they are not useless?
---
see: https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/casterpets.php
---
How about a classic+ server that is the same content only harder?
---
Thanks for this answer but it sounds so canned :D. Are you really a Lead Software Engineer answering or did you have to run this through PR or someone else?
---
Regardless, thanks again for making the game happen!
---
Wait, what? We can do low level dungeons with 10 players?! Why would that be allowed? I don’t recall ever doing a dungeon with more than 5 players, except Blackrock Spire and Stratholme (for a brief time).
---
10-manning these dungeons will trivialize them.
---
I'd vote for locking level cap at 60, raising the level cap created a lot of discontinuity imo
---
\*saves post\*
---
It would be nice to see what the best pre-raid gear is, as a top-5. Clearly, Blizzard intended to make the dungeon set the pre-raid gear, and probably tested MC using that. Yet nowadays players greatly value +spell power and +shadow so felcloth stuff is super valuable to maximize pre-raid damage. I plan on going for my dungeon set, but only really as a collection, maybe for PvE if I choose. But it would be nice to see a ranking of the top 5, best hear pre-raid. Most guilds are going to want their raider group during phase 1 to have at a top-five BiS pre-raid in each slot. Where does the dungeon set rank?
---
Thanks for the info though, it even has most of the info I want. Got to find something to occupy me while I wait the next 6+ days.
---
6 days and counting boys and gals and cats and dogs!
---
yeah! play how -mekkie- does or you're doing it wrong!
---
I'm not pretending like anything is a  "big deal". I was just having a random dialogue with a random person in the internet. I think you're the one making it a big deal now.
---
can confirm? He said it happened around legion yet you haven't been there for 4 years. AKA you can't confirm
---
Hunter main, mage alt. 
---
I anticipate having a lot of gold because I love making money in MMOs. Any sort of profession/merchanting/money-making method that can be grinded, I will likely grind it much more than I would raid.
---
*World Sloppy Seconds
---
Layoff my blackcrow roguetards
---
Does this mean our ranks will update in real time, or do we still have to wait for the reset?
---
Its pretty basic to do. Sorry, didn't know we had engineers in here that know Blizz's servers better than they do.
---
What name he get?
---
I think Classic to modern without any of the added systems would be awesome. Just new places to explore and grow incrementally more powerful, not massive growth changes that completely invalidate previous content.
---
Like if all the raid tiers were just X higher than the previous one where you only got a few more stam/str/agi/int/etc. instead of like 5x as much. Create a linear growth instead of it being exponential.
---
lol, it's also the only way many of us are even going to touch wow again. don't generalize.
---
You couldn't really do PvP to gear up unless you played all day in BGs all the time for months bc the good stuff came with later ranks that only a scant few obtained
---
Looks like it's over
---
Do you have plans to re release the Burning Crusade expansion pack so players can play through that as well?
---
Are you expecting these high queue times during the EU midnight release as well?
---
You should be able to reload the UI while the game is running.  Just copy it to the right directory.  I'm pretty sure it was just a /reloadui command.
---
Fuck it, I'll watch. Won't be racing myself but I enjoy hype
---
Will you do anything to enforce server balance in terms of Horde/Alliance? Personally I think that you should lock down character creation for one of the sides if it becomes as unbalanced as 70/30.
---
I remember sitting in tavern in some town nad just chatting and getting some "immerse"
---
When my char get drunk, I couldnt see difference between my friend playing dwarf and chairs haha:)
---
Only on the Mankrik server.
---
There was some world pvp in tbc, despite flying (thanks to the 310% glad mount), but it was nowhere near as fun.
---
Wraths phasing killed it. :(
---
Make the oomkin become a Doomkin!!!
---
I'm glad, but I'm also sad.
---
I spent so much time discovering bugs (And yeah, 'exploits') during Vanilla that it almost became part of the game. A friend and I discovered a trick with a warlock charming a PVP enemy, then a hunter (Seemingly HAD to be a hunter for some unknown reason) would use a gnomish rocket helmet and charge the guy and they'd get stuck in an endless stun loop, even if they logged out and back in.
---
Don't get me wrong, we never actually used any of those exploits in PVP or Raids, but that was always one of the most fun parts of the game to me.
---
Any comments on hunter "caster" pets?
---
https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/casterpets.php
---
will they still be useless?
---
&gt; buying the EU game for $50 and then paying $30 a month for two subscriptions? 
---
Well you dont have to buy the game anymore, the subscribtion gets you everything. But i do think you would have to pay a sub for US and one for EU.
---
&gt; by giving us classic lol
---
We are kind of paying for it, no?
---
I know you guys touted "no changes" as a (funny) jab to show fans a couple QoL improvements that could have been made. My "no changes" complaint that won't be reimplemented is no wall jumping. My question is what am I supposed to do when I was planning on logging off an hour prior and I'm just sitting in SW and I can't get on top of AH or Cathedral? Jumping in circles only keeps me occupied for an additional 15 minutes.
---
&gt;Your layer assignment now persists for a few minutes between logouts, long enough that by the time the game would choose a new layer for you, that node would have respawned on its own anyway.
---
I don't quite understand this.
---
 Does that mean that stuff like black lotus respawns after a few minutes?
---
I never noticed that druids don't get spell damage from this
---
They really didn't like moonkins did they?
---
Yeah, those are events that shape what WoW means to you though, it's neat
---
This is pretty nuts. 24/7 for 7 days at the casino with over 40 people plus hosts?
---

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ct4cmr/as_a_new_vanilla_horde_player_i_have_to_ask/). 
---
Per realm.
---
The game is 1.12 so that's the version we're getting.  There's a big can of worms when you say "well this was only in for 4 months, it's not vanilla"... 
---
It was vanilla.  It will be "classic"
---
Then you have a population of 100 people playing the last content and they will simply stop creating more
---
I have been keeping my eye on that. The only unfortunate part is that it only includes those on this subreddit and even then just those that filled out the survey.
---
Remember when Sco joked about this? Guess the corporate sponsors think this is a good idea.
---
True vanilla experience!  ;)
---
Felt cute might delete later teehee
---
Available in every realm
---
I think you're overestimating player retention; pretty obvious they're slowly rolling out servers to prevent dead servers down the line.
---
"You disagree with me so you're a troll"
---
That's BiS through Naxx I would imagine it would be added with the DM loot and Relics in P5 or 6.
---
I think you will be fine because it's a two hour time difference. Your raids will just be at a later time for you than your guilds. 
---
ex.
---
Raid time for them is 7pm
---
Raid time for you is 9pm
---
Unless you have to get up early in the morning. It shouldn't be an issue.
---
Also finding guilds that's raid schedule is held earlier in the day might help with the time difference.
---
Thistle Tea is cooking btw
---
Draenei.
---
And WC 3 funded Vanilla! 
---
It's a never ending cycle!!!!
---
Always wanted to get the Corrupted Ashbringer!!
---
&gt; more populated ones 
---
Thats what you want!
---
Still a pawg
---
If you could date an NPC who would it be?
---
Will this new engine eventually support more cpu threads like the BFA engine?
---
Yea i get that.. But if you saw " álex", "álêx" or "älex" you would still just say "alex" cuz they actually looks like letters you know from you own language.. you know? :) 
---
But russians uses symbols wich doesnt look anything like the english letters, so you cant really translate it like the example i gave earliere :(
---
In retrospect, what is your guy's opinions of J Allen Brack's, *"You think you want it, but you don't"* quote in reference to the massively popular release of classic realms?
---
Like I've explained, you switch to that layer just before it spawns and harvest it. Or it's already being farmed by someone within your group. The whole point is to lock other people out from being able to compete on that resource.
---
This isn't rocket science.
---
Is Classic+  being seriously considered / has it been brought up? Stuff such as diverting to a new path instead of TBC and creating content that holds onto the classic spirit?
---
lol paid character transfer
---
Here comes activision to fuck up the game.
---
B-b-but it was in vanilla!
---
So were 2.0 talents. Let's add 2.0 talents, too. And TBC pre patch.
---
Fuck you activision.
---
There is nothing funny about this picture, in fact you might have made this formula as unfunny as is possible
---
I want everything as it was right before members was released.
---
I started playing WoW a week after launch. Though it had a rocky start, I was hooked pretty much right away. I've been deeply in love with this game since my early teens. I played up until the end of Wrath, where I decided I wasn't a huge fan of the game's direction (which is fine, I understand *why* you guys made the changes you did). 
---
Since then I've had to rely on private servers. I'm sure you've probably heard, in passing, what the experience on this servers is like. It's horrible. I won't even go into details as to how or why, but for the 3 or 4 years I played across many different private servers, every single time it ended badly.
---
Until now. I'm not sure if it was Ion, or possibly the investor board that *truly* heard out cry for classic, but either way I'm deeply grateful.
---
I'm also grateful to the dev team itself. For 15 years people have been trying to accurately reproduce classic and failed, and you guys did it in 2 successfully. That's a serious accomplishment. I can imagine the crunch has been intense.
---
So my question to you guys/gals is; what was the most difficult part of converting classic over to the new client?
---
Thanks again for all your hard work :)
---
This isn't the actual Method guild from retail, and it's not a team thing as far as I understand. They just brought together a bunch of streamers who will all be playing their own way, with their own guilds etc. They'll just be featured on the Method stream.
---
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
---
hi I'm just here to say I'm joining your server with my guild of 650+ retail wow friends thank you for letting me know where the good server is
---
1
---
Yea this is a serious dealbreaker.  Completely unacceptable.
---
I highly doubt that. They may have not played as much as they used to, but millions didn't stop and never look back. Most checked in back in after expansion releases to see the hype and leave a week later
---
Then whose Tauren chieftain, Bain Bloodhoof?
---
I suppose Nathanos Blightcaller is her first champion.
---
And Mankrik is boss of the Steamwheedle Cartel.
---
SP. Vanilla PvP, especially by Post Naxx/T3, is suuuuuuuuuper bursty. Meaning, every1 is getting 1 shotted. You're definitely dead before you're oom, esp considering you still have like 8k mana unbuffed by then with how much Int you already have (plus all the spirit). Most damage = even more burst. MP5 = more sustain, which is practically irrelevant in PvP.
---
Firemaw!
---
He's wrong because you don't create layers.  The server creates a layer at a population threshold.  All you get to do is get invited to one someone is already on.
---
Please kill the lava spawns. (on firelords)
---
They've clearly been practicing on pservers.  Anyone who thinks otherwise is deluded.
---
No one would even try unless they had.
---
I mean...yes? Except I don't see how it would be magical to get your alts to different layers. I assume the layer it puts you in is random when you login, and thus your alts are likely to be on different layers from your main.
---
sulfuras hand of ragnaros. got it a while back on lights hope and it costed me like 5-7k gold. probably the reason why im not going for it again.
---
I've only used wowclassicbis for prot warrior, so I can't speak for the other classes, but it's just downright awful.  I redid my list based on my own research twice, but I didn't see that nice wowhead list that includes mail +hit gear options.  Time to redo it all again!
---
Aszhara is 425 surely!?
---
Any reason this got deleted? :(
---
\*High five\*
---
I dropped WoW some time after WotLK release and I tried to come back a few times later but it just wasn't fun at all. *Everything* about it felt wrong. I tried questing with friends and we quickly realized that we were only getting in the way of each other because everything just dies so easily. I tried doing instances and it was all so lifeless. Get in the dungeon finder queue, get teleported to god knows where without any sense of being in the world, faceroll through the dungeon with random people without ever saying a word or pausing to strategize. Instant spec swap, no talent trees, ~~dumbed down~~ streamlined skills. Ugh.
---
I just felt so happy these past couple of weeks watching people playing the stress test getting murdered by random cats in Barrens, randomly flicking through old talent calculators and quest databases.
---
Even if it all turns out to be one huge nostalgia trip it was still more than worth it.
---
One big zerg. Often without tactic.. and people loved that! Good memories :)
---
Can you quote where I said wow isn't for hardcore players?
---
No you can't.
---
Ecin
---
You honestly think leveling in retail teaches you how to play a class?
---
Precisly? Hence saying "Not really retail funded it, and you get classic at no extra cost with a sub" - makes little sense.
---
If you read the blue post from 5 minutes earlier than yours you'd realise that the catch up gear added in 1.10 isn't in the game until Phase 5. Including Spellweaver's Turban.
---
Pretty mind-bogglingly stupid of you to rant so furiously while being wrong don't you think.
---
Would like to know this aswell!
---
Cheers
---
randomness makes it inconvenient enough that people won't spend all day trying to invite people to the layer.  every person you invite is a risk that they pull you to their layer instead, now you both need an invite to get back, that's inconvenient for you so you're less likely to invite someone just to help them.
---
They'd need to have a lot of gold for it to be worth it, I don't know if 39 people would carry someone for 4000 gold meaning 102 gold each in about the same time someone could have just grinded it in dire maul.
---
Are there any plans for certain unexpected vanilla events (like the corrupted blood incident) to make it into classic to keep with the "as close to vanilla experience as possible" development credo?
---
Hi Devs!
---
Thanks for all the hard work you've put into bringing Classic back. It's been one of the things my wife and I have been wishing for for years now, and we never thought it would actually happen, so we're really grateful you guys pushed forward with it.
---
We're not really the dungeon/party type, and most of our gameplay revolved around PvP. It wasn't much, but one of my proudest achievements was making the Sergeant Major rank through Battlegrounds. Could you verify if those ranks are coming back (with the original requirements)? Thanks again!
---
This might be a better idea in a way.. Nice.
---
you know you've been playing a lot of wow when you start to speak like a troll!
---
The big thing you get with PvP sets is mroe armor/health with a trade off on gear stats and then higher weapon damage.
---
R14 weapons for casters, outside of their large stamina, are generally worse DPS wise than R14 stuff.  But looking at stuff in BWL, you can make up with some HP heavy gear.
---
While you also make a direct comparison on weapon damage ranges, DPS still has a roll for your non-instant attacks.  most PvE gear from BWL on (rag weapons work as well) have good DPS stats but aren't super slow like the PvP weapons are.  Warriors will still be shredding with Spinal Reaper and Bonereaver's Edge.  In fact, BRE could potentially be more since it's auto applying a sunder armor effect to players so you do more damage for every hit.
---
wiping at 1%
---
well no, because even if you have the same time you can play, but are logged out for 50% of it for w/e reason compared to someone playing solo at their own pace, though you could level more efficiently during the time you are logged in, you are still less efficient in respect to the time you could be playing.
---
While that may be likely, I've seen Alliance pvp dominated servers in retail.
---
You spelled Grobbulus wrong
---
N i c e
---
Wow thank you so much I had no clue hamstring could proc either
---
meh you end up doing other things like queued like watching TV, making food, cleaning the house, etc. I used to even remote in to my PC from work back in the day so I could go ahead and wait in queue while I'm waiting in traffic on my way home.
---
There was no real point to doing them with &gt;5 players since the exp gets significantly reduced and you can't complete dungeon quests, but the option to do so was there in vanilla so it's gonna still be there.
---
I’ve been trying to be productive, but it has been quite the battle for sure
---
I know vin diesel played a horde shaman back in the day
---
I'm sorry about your brother. I hope you can relive many great memories when classic launches.
---
No it doesn't. You can be standing outside the instance waiting for it to reset and then walk in when the clock ticks over, without the server restarting.
---
get a team of node farmers all on diff layers and inv each other
---
Is there a possibility that you can see your healing in scrolling combat text in the future?
---
Haha, yea try convincing my buddies lol.  I would assume the economy would be much better on high pop realms...There will be more then 5-10 extreme nerds on the server so inflation wouldn't be such an issue.  No offence if you game that hard. hahaha
---
Clicked only because of the title tbh. No interest in the guide or fishing whatsoever.
---
No. There's some speculation on Discord about population, but we're not really going to know just yet.
---
What is the cool down for dropping ony/nef head and getting the buff? It seems ridiculous with 10k plus pop and have to wait on a cooldown
---
Imagine going to your boss' office and he says he has a great idea, then he tells you his idea and it is literally so horrible all you want to do is yell at him "NO, JUST NO, YOU FUCKING IDIOT! HOW ARE YOU THIS STUPID!?", but you don't because you need the job.
---
It is similar to that.
---
Yep, but I've seen even worse. In Elder Scrolls blades, there is only one game mode and it actively scales the difficulty to your current gear. You can get stronger or weaker all you want and it never changes anything
---
Vloms!
---
This is vanilla warrior we're talking about, hes gonna need macros to stance swap, weapon swap and cast skills all the meanwhile.
---
Each set of skills will need its macros.
---
Or OSRS. I played it for a bit with my friend and you can just buy gear, use it for how ever long, then sell it when you're done with it. It was such a foreign concept to me.
---
Blizzard said min hit for raiding is 9%.
---
It will be there on launch, however I have seen a ton of people looking to do this at launch for the extra gold. You will run into a lot of competition.
---
So then which class is overall better in premade PvP, druid or priest?
---
Arguably druid for objective based battlegrounds, and world PvP.  Priest might have the edge in AV.
---
stealth healing is just too powerful
---
Posture info is kind of misleading. You don't want to sit completely upright for hours, but hunching forward is worse than leaning back (which is good- spine curve &amp; lumbar support).
---
What I do is a couple stretches in a day; stand flat against a wall, heels, shoulders, back of head all aligned on the wall's surface. Brings my arms so my elbows are bent, hands up, still pressing my elbows to the wall and slowly raise my hands up over my head, almost like a policeman asking you to put em up.
---
This pulls your shoulders back, straightens your neck, and your spine.
---
I could tell a difference immediately after from looking in the mirror, and I still do it semi regularly to keep good posture. That + stretch the legs!
---
No because everyone starts at 110 so they dont learn abilities as they level and use them in the world. They are just handed everything and have no idea what is going on. That's why I'm saying giving a new player a lvl 110 is a bad thing and just a cash grab from blizzard.
---
I mean, they still call it Lordaeron, so you may have a point.
---
You have to decrease layer size if players are congregated. You can increase layer size (thus have fewer layers) if players are spread out.
---
Well, I mean for every extra person thats providing resources like Arcanite Bars, Devilsaur Leather and Black Lotus there is an extra buyer. And yes there will be 10k+ people on each server, blizzard confirmed that theyre expecting 10k+ QUEUES for Shazzrah / Herod... so theyre gonna be PACKED. What the servers will look like after layering will be interesting.
---
Oh, by no means was it a stupid question, I was just interested to see if you had any additional math/information to back up your argument (not to prove me wrong, but to educate me).
---
Amen, old Sylvanas voice super creepy, harrowing, everything I expect from a Banshee Queen.
---
It will probably be very hard to have 100g by level 40, that's why it's important not to spend money on unnecessary skills. In the first 2-3 weeks, playing the AH won't be possible because no one will have money to buy stuff on the AH.
---
2 things will make you a bit of money:
---
1. Having 2 gathering professions: one to stockpile for your level 60 crafting profession and Skinning. The plan is to sell all leather and skin to the vendor to make extra bucks (again: no one will have money to buy those from the AH). If you plan to have Leatherworking...well, sell your ores or herbs to the vendor.
---
2. Around level 37-40, farm high value mobs. High value mob are generally the ones that drop valuable grey items that stack and that can be sold to the vendor. If the target can be skinned, you double the gain.
---
Me and others on r/Newcastleupontyne are also on shazzah
---
That Turban was added in Patch 1.10, and therefore won't be in the game at all until Phase 5. As shown here: https://itemization.info/item/22267
---
Me and 8 friends just made the move as well!
---
The post which was made in response to my original post? Yea, I should have just read the post from the future, heh.
---
I looked at the current Herod discord survey when I posted that comment. I guess technically 52% Horde is "mainly".
---
I'm guessing that what it will mean in practice is that Phase 2 might be rolled out at 6 pm Paris time for EU servers, at 6 pm Chicago time for American servers, at 6 pm Sydney time for Oceanic servers, etc.
---
Most likely everyone will have a long queue at launch, so dont think you will get away from that.
---
I'd even be OK with obvious bug fixes.
---
The problem with Kazzak in particular is that you can drag him to Stormwind where guards instantly respawn and he will infinitely heal until a GM comes and death touches him. This is something that was hotfixed pretty quickly after people found it out (similar to the Reckoning Bomb), so it's not like most players encountered it in their normal play.
---
It could be that dungeon xp is high enough that people will be able to keep up leveling entirely in dungeons.
---
or leave it in for that "Authentic" Feel. I remember how much i hated it but man did it create some fond memories.
---
Top notch response.
---
I don't care about LFG chat. But back in the day Trade chat was used as a game wide channel for talking to people in other cities. Whether you like that or not, it's how it was back then. Technicalities do not matter when a cultural distinction is in place.
---
I feel as though a split in servers might be the best bet. 
---
Classic+ can have a ton of content to it, but it's probably going to be all endgame focus, so a lot of the early game things is going to be lost and people are going to farm -&gt; log out by that point in the cycle. So having an alternate server with some life to it, might be the best bet (hence TBC).
---
I would hope for character copies by that point as well, as people I am sure would love to play their characters they have invested literal YEARS into by that point.
---
this isn't about hopping to farm nodes, this is about layers being molded for specific purposes on a large scale.
---
all the horde will join the same layer, because it's inconvenient to be on the layer where all the alliance are ganking you. 
---
if you're looking for pvp, you'll join a layer where the other players are specifically looking for pvp instead of the trade layer where everybody's hiding in stormwind.
---
It's not, sorry.
---
It's not 100% random. It tries to keep you with people on your friends list, guild mates, and your alts. Your alts are NOT likely to be on a separate layer unless you get invited to another one, or if you happen to overflow the layer between logs.
---
You definitely didn't know everyone in the game back then either. Judging from Nostalrius, there will be a tightknit community even with 15k players online peaks.
---
Mate imagine if they turned around now and said "We're going to be creating our own version of the retail store, featuring ingame boosts for a small fee"
---
I'd flip tables.
---
If classic was live we could tell you but AAP is a go to
---
Where do you see classic 6 years from now?
---
&gt; Things majority of the player base enjoys without ruining the game in its original state.
---
BfA players can vote, right? I think you have your answer.
---
Ahh ok I had it backwards LoL.  Yeah I watched the first world race because I have a friend who's played with method in another game so I support them and respect them from what I know about them. They had quite a few people take time off work but because it was limited time they were worrying about having to stop raiding to go back to jobs. They talked about it on stream. Granted they had subs ready to go, I couldn't imagine have 40 raiders ready to go, then subs waiting on the side patiently, even though they won't be needed.
---
Lol good one!
---
You're aware that there's literally an AMA open right now?  Did you even look at the front page?
---
[I was expecting this.](https://i.imgur.com/TJsxPy4.gifv)
---
I was quite reassured that he said multiple times during the AmA that they are "absolutely committed" to having just one layer by the end of phase 1
---
WTS: "Michael" on Herod
---
discord: motive#1141
---
Shh let them post it. More people say it's a long q more people leave and it's a shorter q.
---
When is my "charname" folder created? Does it happen when i "/reload"?
---
Yeah you're correct, Its just that as a player like anyone else we don't know where the MOST hardcore or dedicated players are trending to go, we have a general idea of the large clumps but now that every server is full/high whos to say what communities are where?
---
I'm not going to rush it. I took a week of paid time off but I'll try to not fuck up and maintain a healthy sleep schedule, I would feel miserable constantly otherwise. I'm prone to burn-out so I'm taking it in a semi-hardcore way, content is in phases anyway for a good reason. To answer your question for this I don't need any extra purchases.
---
Pretty lazy response, authentic experience would not be knowing the resources and quantities. No changes was an important movement that has become a double edged sword.
---
But they will probably still need on it anyway.
---
Think of it like this. "If I get this week done well, I will deserve classic WoW next week." This is the only sentence getting me through these troubled times.
---
Firemaw here also!
---
Most certainly is.
---
No name private server guilds bout to destroy method lmao
---
That would be dope
---
Getting to level 60, that itself is a great acomplishement for me, and then i guess just building my character to be as strong as possible, also I love leveling proffesions and world PvP
---
Has higher subs than wow does lul
---
you are correct ofc! other commenters said the same, so there is no misunderstanding here :)
---
i thought it would be easier for everyone to just assume the average person sees one drop at about 5000 kills.
---
more intuitive and still gets my point across :).
---
i should have probably used:
---
&gt;50% chance it will drop if you do 3466 runs ( 1-(.9998)\^3466=.5 )
---
obv. its not determinable at what point it drops because of the gamblers fallacy but still thank you for your effort! :)
---
If you can't tell he is meming there, you might want a better sarcasm detector.
---
This was such a good AMA, literally has me even more hyped. Love how detailed they go and how serious they are taking everything.
---
thats probably about as concrete of an end goal as one could set
---
How do you intend to combat bots?
---
I bet they are really doing it to reduce server load. This seems similar to how they nerfed the Haunted Memento because as they fragment the servers into multiple machines working in unison instead of one mega-server machine the space for individual spawns is going to likely be reduced. I wonder if with the new server architecture having skeletons all over the place might cause lag of some kind.
---
More layers to thin out the localized population. Then, as the population becomes less localized, they reduce the number of layers to keep visible population up. 
---
All in an effort to not bottleneck and overtax the servers.
---
my friend and i are going to level in Nelf zones. we are going dwarf and gnome. he will be a mage so he will have problems with the trainer before level 16. he will keep his hearth at IF and just hearth there every very important milestones
---

Explore the world, improve your character and socialize.
---
I agree, I hate the idea of cross-realm anything.
---
In vanilla if you BG'd a lot you would start to recognize the teams you were facing. We knew the leaders of the BG teams, we knew their strats, and we would keep track of which teams were queueing. We changed strat and group composition to counter the teams that were queueing. There was a lot of trash talking because playing against the same people over and over created rivalries.
---
None of that will be experienced in classic.
---
What a shitty response lol. "We're just gonna wreck the classic experience so everyone plays in a world where they're the only players in capital cities. It's closer to Skyrim that way so that's a good thing."  
---
Gross.
---
Classic's economy is gonna be whack yo.
---
haha, you got me :D
---
MOM!! I NEED THE BUCKET!!!
---
It'll run it, but you won't be running high settings or getting good framerate in crowded areas. That laptop has integrated graphics, so just keep in mind it's not at all meant for gaming.
---
Never bet against Pserver autism.
---
I have got a million client deliverables to finish so I’ve been mostly doing pretty long hours with browsing a bit at night. But that’s not unusual unless I get lucky and get staffed on an easy relaxing project which rarely happens.
---
I did retard. Sco confirmed he would be playing 2 months ago. This is the first official announcement that method will race and host this event.
---
They cant ever remove layers with the amount of projected people going into phase 2.  Nodes of herbs/mines are fixed based on a population of 3k'ish like back in vanilla.  Resources would just be non existant with layers removed and keeping the pop that high
---
Do some change on the way ! Add draenei for the alliance, but not blood elf for the horde (classic communauty isn't fan of them), so offer goblins instead !
---
And how about playing dagger/sword(or better dagger/dagger) with ambush/backstab build? Do you have any good one?(cold blood talent look's cool :D)
---
People sometimes talk about "splitting the playerbase" when discussing the possibility of running Classic and TBC side by side. I don't think that's accurate, I think players who want TBC will eventually leave Classic for private servers if they want TBC bad enough. I think for the vast majority of the community, upgrading the Classic servers to TBC is out of the question. But I don't see the harm in creating an additional server for TBC that we can copy our Classic characters over to. The playerbases are different.
---
There's 2 trinket slots...
---
Another tip: the yellow connection between Ratchet and Booty Bay is for Alliance as well - I forgot to include it :)
---
Tbf those robes are really good for a while
---
Would you being willing to add a poll system like Old school Runescape?
---
 Old School Runescape (Os Rs). Os Rs implemented a poll system where if 75% of the player base that voted yes quality of life updates would come to the game without taking away authenticity. For Examples a barber shop. Things majority of the player base enjoys without ruining the game in its original state.
---
Warrior is the best Hunter spec
---
Wanting longer que times and unbalanced horde vs alliance ratios just to recognize people in your bg every now and then? Seems like a logical move to me. /s
---
I have been specifically told on more than one occasion to not touch a piece of code under any circumstances below a nuclear apocalypse. Must....make....better.....
---
You listen to the Tipsout leaked &lt;HOME&gt; officer meeting and he was discussing it.  Method just wants to slap their name on people who have potential to world first something.  Throw enough darts at a board and eventually one will be a bullseye.
---
Tips, based on last Classic Cast, is going batshit insane.  40 hours day 1, 6 hours sleep, 24 hours 6 hours sleep after that.  For a guy that hasn't, as far as I know, done anything remotely crazy for a sleep schedule.  He's going to be out of it by day 2.
---
It's real easy to do "24 hour streams" once.  But trying to maintain that for 6-7 days straight?
---
At least we get to see people deteriorate live on stream for this.
---
The players just wanted to be the ones who get to ruin the game instead of Jagex 😂
---
Lol what are you guys talking about. The event is at least 6 hours long
---
It will take way more than an hour to turn in all the materials even if a hardcore guild has each player make 5 accounts so they can have 50 toons per server (probably would take even more than this tbh to store everything)
---
Nice. So you used all the luck you had for your life

---
I disagree. I made friends on the opposite faction in BG's during vanilla that eventually lead me to switching factions, re-leveling and joining them in BC. The only reason this happened is because we were limited to same realm bgs and we played against one another ALL the time.
---
NA / whitemane Holy priest and Enh shaman looking for guild. Gonna be very active first few days then go back to work and will probably play 4 - 6 hours a night.  We love to pvp but will also be interested in running dungeons and raids a lot.
---
Classic+ or nothing.
---
I like the time locked idea to be fair.
---
That must have been a rush!
---
So unofficially I'm right.  Thanks.
---
I saved a bunch of stuff from college. Oh dear god.......
---
we arent sure what values the loots have now
---
and the respawns and general reset gimmicks for dungeons like dm
---
Fun, regardless of what is fun for you.
---
Some people find raiding end-game content fun. Getting their PvE epics to go smash people's faces in in WSG.
---
Some people find farming gold fun, they sit on their wealth and laugh in the faces of plebs and farm mobs day after day after day to get rare world drops to make even more money.
---
Some people like to chill out in Goldshire and casually duel people, have a laugh with friends, attack the hordies that are dicking about.
---
Some people like to sit in Goldshire and use Mind Control to heal/shield the hordies that are killing everyone and then get raged at by their own faction because they can't take a joke.
---
Some people like to just play Battlegrounds and PvP to test their skill and their limits and things.
---
Some people like to RP. Some just like to do 5 man dungeons. Some people make too many alts.
---
Everyone has fun doing different things and WoW has a lot of different things to have fun with. (Except the PvP ranking system which is so far removed from fun that no one could possibly enjoy going for Rank 14.)
---
Griefing lowbies.
---
To crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and hear the lamentations of their women.
---
They're still horde and alliance.  These are mostly the prominent/head of their respective guilds to represent them in the stream race.
---
Yeah don’t train heroic strike past rank 2 while leveling...oh god that is terrible advice
---
gross, leave this garbage on live and stop infecting everything with \~esports\~ trash. the real world firsts were 15 years ago.
---
It was in the beta and stress tests which are based on phase 1, i have seen and grabbed the chest myself.
---
Which is exactly the point of the question, it's a "bug" that they kept.  So, why are they not keeping other things that were in vanilla?  What was their criteria for "vanilla enough" to keep or throw out?
---
and Blackhand's Breath is better AND a quest reward.
---
They usually sent terrible
---
Definitely agree with you there! Firemaw is dope af sounding name.
---
Why not remove the cap entirely as it was when vanilla launched originally? Strat and Scholo were ran as 20 man when I first hit 55-60.
---
Absolutely not, he confirmed he would play? Are you daft? This is a huge event and definitely a big announcement
---
Naxx had some dirty weapon drops. Made Warriors and Shamans gods
---
Alright, I can see how Master's Call doesn't fit in. It does seem like a better flare, I agree.
---
However I'm still set on Arcane Shield. It can be tuned for PvE situations for sure. It could have a cap on exactly how much damage it can block. But in PvP, unlike Will of the Forsaken, you'd have to cast it preemptively, it would block one magical harmful effect coming your way, so either a fireball, a tick of a dot, or poly/fear. I imagine a good mage would get rid of it with a fire blast and move on and a good warlock would already have dots on you, not to mention that even if poly/fear does get blocked, it could still be recast. So I definitely don't see how it's more versatile than WotF that not only lets you break those effects on will but also gives you immunity to them for 5 seconds.
---
At level 40 with Ravager:
---
* MS does 12.4 eDPR
---
* WW does 11.1 eDPR
---
* Sunder Armor does 12.9 eDPR
---
* 7 ticks of Rend deal 21.3 eDPR
---
(on average, vs. warrior type mobs, 10% crit and 400 ap)
---
i'm not saying don't use hs, you have to sometimes to dump rage, but glancing blows only have 10% against same level mob. as orc/human with correct weapon you are essentially 1 level above mobs of same level so it will be even less
---
They usually arnt terrible
---
It only runs on 2012 or newer Metal capable macs
---
Didn't they already do that though, for certain areas before flying was available?
---
Similar to the bombing quests in Hellfire Penninsula and whatnot. I don't think it would feel that disconnected. 
---
Perhaps, instead of NPCs there could be more thematically appropriate ways of travel. Like portals to get to the entrances to Tempest Keep in Netherstorm. 
---
Personally, I am not against flying. But I understand the reason why the community is so I want to think of ways to limit it and reduce the argument against TBC and WotLK. 
---
Perhaps another solution could be a Flying Fatigue system. You can only fly for so long before having to land.
---
Right, and I can't play the way I want to play when limited by systems made to punish others.
---
Berzerking scales based on your hp. Ironically might get better use out of it as prot then fury.
---
Yeah exactly!
---
3/4*
---
Phase 2 is honor system without BGs.  No one wants their twink to get accidental XP.
---
Haha struggling so fucking hard to not look in the mirror. Feel bad for you man.
---
what layer
---
$15
---
They’re either delusional or they’ve secretly acquired some private server neckbeards that have been training their asses of. I hope it’s the latter because it’s going to cringe me out if they get totally smoked by randoms
---
The newer Sylvanas (asthetics and character) is reason 163 of why modern WoW is ass.

---
you're assuming it was a premade. It was really 1-3 guys who were in the same guild who all liked to pvp. We'd buttheads in WSG all the time.
---
I honestly think you'll still have a chance to raid. 
---
Classic is an rpg, find a fun guild and I'm sure they'll be down for running any raid, whenever. Regardless of the phase classic is in. 
---
And re rolling profs at max level isn't that daunting. Netflix and grind :)
---
no, you're completely wrong.  it doesn't take coordination, it happens totally naturally.
---
you see trade chat cross-layer, right.  and what happens when you need to trade with somebody?  well they're on a different layer, so you have to invite them, that means they get dragged over to your layer.  now they're on the trade layer, very quickly everybody who's trading is on the same layer.
---
lots of alliance on your layer, and that's annoying you?  easiest solution is to ask for an invite to another layer.  now you're on a layer with horde, very quickly the factions separate.  it's all natural.
---
It's not breaking the rules, there is no where in the TOS saying "you cannot socialize on trade channel"
---
No thanks to flying mounts, dailies, resilience, catch-up gear, irrelevant old world, dying wpvp...
---
No one cares for TBC servers except for the loud minority. TBC on private servers suck and no one plays them.
---
&gt;The Stranglethorn Fishing Extravaganza is available probably during phase 4 and is an event that occurs every Sunday from 2 to 4 PM
---
Is this confirmed? Will there be no fishing extravaganza when phase 1 opens next week?
---
Its not really "significantly different" because even if it had a 10 man cap it would still be in your best interest to 5 man it.
---
This is fantastic.  Thanks OP!
---
(In case anyone didn't notice, there's three images you can scroll through here.  The other two are flight maps.)
---
We got Harvest Festival in about a month too!
---
It more bothers me that you can one hit Frozen King and other powerful bosses, kills the immersion.
---
I'd guess this will happen quite regularly. On the other hand, it's also a way to avoid somebody who's corpse camping you
---
Oh! I get it.
---
This is exactly what retail is.
---
Retail has all of those convenience features that kill the social aspect of the game. Retail has almost no community because of features like cross-realm and group finder. Many of us are going to play classic because it doesn't have those features.
---
iirc they used the free transfers to balance servers that had population issues, i cant remember exactly though its been like 15 years
---
RUNA blood orange tea. Weed. 
---
Fast to lv 60, so you can stay in shape annnd never leave the chair. 
---
I was gonna hook up my bike desk but my seat is horrible. A good seat is crucial with back support!
---
I mean you could always just buy yourself a paper bag if you're that gross.
---
15 bucks little man. Put that shit in my hands. If that money dosent show me then you'll owe me owe me owe
---
So "nochanges" unless you decide it's harmful? What's the criteria for changes? People can also say the N word in chat and there will be a massive influx of gold sellers in trade. Are you going to remove chat functions because of the potential to cause harm? Hunter traps are broken in this patch. Will that be changed? I just don't understand this philosophy. What does "No Changes" mean?

Later on. Should be 206xp, they get 255. This is 310% - not the expected 250%
---
Fuck warriors!
---
Good one:)
---
Bruh, easy....that comment actually does give us more info we didn't have originally. The answer proves the hard work is done....bc would be easier to implement... We know the wow community wants bc...so....bc is going to happen

Someone's mad he was proven wrong and his tiny sick ego cant handle it :D
---
I feel bad for the 12 hosts. Don't get to play on launch. I bet all the good hosts turned down the job as well.
---
not if you time it right, like an hour before just incase its faster
---
Yes it is, under bugs fixed or soon to be fixed.
---
Been 80k in january!
---
I looked on our old guild DKP and we had 2 drop.  We disenchanted one of them haha.  Granted that was January in 2006 and we stopped doing MC by april 2006 and even at that point we were doing 1 MC clear month in 2006.
---
Weapons are always those things that were low count.  We saw 2 Death's Sting, only saw 2 pairs of Hungering Cold/Gressil though in 11 KT kills.  So we got a lot more lucky on that.
---
The people that purchase a 110 boost ar the people that would pay to have a 3rd party boost your account. Same with tokens, it doesn't add anything to the game that people havent already been paying for from a 3rd party. The only people who should be upset by those additions are people who got paid to farm gold/boost characters.
---
What? We are getting cross realm BGs, no matter what sever you're on you'll have the same length of queue times.
---
While layering is in place I don't intend to see a community like we had in 2004-2005, there's going to be too many players across all the layers, and you won't always be in the same layers to get to know those around you.  
---
However, when layering is complete and we are left with just one layer - the server, I do hope to see a player cap similar to the ones we did have back then.
---
you guys ever Beavis?
---
I’m Vanilla I had a friend who was super casual but managed to make friends with a Naxx geared tank, an Undead Warrior.  He tanked Strat in his non raiding time and basically gave out free 45 minute baron runs with the mount being reserved.  He eventually got it.  I got a few ultra smooth strat runs out of him.
---
RP servers should be converted to PvP/Normal servers. Such a waste.
---
There isn't even a boat in retail .
---
You say I'm not very bright but your playing the game like every single player is coming to play with friends. And also you completley ignore the majority of people who will re roll anyways because of queue times. No one was wasting this long for classic to wait an hour in que.
---
And im not bright lol
---
It's because WotF only works on fear/charm effects, which is a limited amount. Functionally in the game its basically just warlock fear and priest psychic scream (outside of some weird niche uses).
---
But this lets you block *anything.* Hunter trap, Deathcoil, entangling roots, sheep, fear, sleep, pally stun, repentance, the list just goes on forever. The number of things this ability counters is massive. Pre-casting isn't really that much of a negative when you consider how many of these things are telegraphed by a cast time.
---
In Vanilla they had cross realm BGs.
---
As /u/ljsmith_1978 mentions in the thread above:
---
&gt;i'm not saying don't use hs, you have to sometimes to dump rage, but glancing blows only have 10% against same level mob. as orc/human with correct weapon you are essentially 1 level above mobs of same level so it will be even less
---
Oof, that's a solid one.
---
When you rush to the top it’s sort of like a few days to a week before the mass catches up. You can get ahead of the AH game but other than that you sort of waiting for some 5 mans.
---
Upvoted for truth.
---
If you want a skeletal zombie horse, roll an undead character.
---
you''ll see at the amount of people watching the stream
---
Level in your starting zones till you hit 6 train all skills then run to the nelf zone then start questing there to get full rep from all quests.
---
Yes, but not because 1 single guild is speedrunning mc
---
I think 10k queues are unrealistic.
---
I'm guessing it's gonna be more like 50k+
---
So you never beat these other guys and joined them for easy wins. Yeah cross realm is the way to go.
---
/#nochanges
---
It will only cost your soul.
---
Now that y’all are telling me these things my memory is getting rejogged. They weren’t available for very long after I got to 60, but now I remember them existing. I’m glad that they’re pointless though, glad you can’t complete quests in them.
---
I strongly believe you shouldn’t be able to 10-man these dungeons though, especially low level dungeons, on principle.
---
Guilds like method could play classic for months they made strategys combos and all the other stuff they calculated everything just to be the first on the server. They have so much knowledge which they dont want to share because other could use them too.  When i played Blade &amp; Soul i joined a progress guild and knew only the pvp stuff, they had so much documents about level guides and level strategys we build a lot of groups and leveld in 24 hours to max level if you know the secrets everybody can do that but most people wont get this informations because they are secrets
---
Horde only. meh
---
Does your friend have an Etsy? I'd pay for one of these. The only other decent-looking one on Etsy is from all the way in Russia and is also out of stock...
---
What in the actual fuck.
---
Also how do you decide between gnomish / goblin engineering? I watched a video that said gnomish is better for melee, goblin is better for ranged... but that seems backwards.
---
accidental exp? people will pvp on twinks in p2 for the trinkets &amp; ranking.
---
lol no, i dont spend crazy amounts of time on reddit though is it a reddit thing?
---
Rhok'delar.. have always been super sad i didn't start vanilla early enough to get it.  
---
Wont really feel the same having it on classic where anyone can, but I'll still love at least getting my hands on it.
---
But we're not talking about all those conveniences, we're talking about cross realm BATTLEGROUNDS. This is as stupid as those people claiming sitting in queue to log in is part of the experience. No one wants 5 hour bg queues.
---
best eu english pvp realm name. i hope a lot of ppl switch to firemaw instead of the other 3
---
I frequently ran into the same groups of people in AV with cross realm BGs.  Your argument is invalid.
---
That just doesn‘t sound like a solution.
---
Just change which mats will be needed, easy peasy.
---
Can someone do one for elemental shaman? Would it just be the upgraded version of the elements set. I never played classic.
---
Did BFA replace it with a portal?  I know they love those portals now.
---
Engineering is too fucking good in classic and sadly it fucks up the entire profession  system.. oh well, no changes...
---
Classic for me always felt like a true RPG. So ima just take my time with everything and enjoy the hell out of it!
---
FYI, there were paid transfers in vanilla.
---
I'm 100% on board with using all expansion content but keeping level cap at 60 and making ways to include expansion content in the 1-60 journey.
---
Should remain through the whole effect. Great for tanking if you only use it below 50%ish health.
---
Nothing character specific per se. Higher fishing skill can help with the tournament in booty bay.
---
that is a great idea....... for a mage, thanks
---
Pineapple does not go on pizza. Working at an Italian restaurant making pizzas, the worst thing ever is having to put wet ass pineapple on the pizza. Completely ruins the integrity of the pie. For shame.
---
Aloha from Oahu :). Old player from WOTLK here. Looking forward to a great experience with WoW classic!
---
Well in my experience you're very wrong. But it doesn't matter because Method aren't really playing classic as hardcore as they play retail. They have like 10 of their raiders who are playing hardcore but they won't be taking it seriously enough to get world firsts. Which is not suprising because classic world firsts don't really matter.
---
This is called cathexis - in essence meaning Emotional investment into an Object.  
---
The main reason we have an automatic cathexis is our creativity. Self is actualized in the things we have, make, or do.   
---
It is medicinal and therapeutic to access this in game and entertainment worlds when it is not easily available through one's regular life. Angry ORC put it best when he said that we are fighting imaginary monsters in order to escape the real ones in our lives that we cannot fight.  
---
Addiction is not really a correct term, not until you see behavior (often wherein the individual can self observe it is happening with awareness, yet still be unable to modify the pattern) of self disruption, where basic needs, sleep, eating, or priorities that usually defined their functional wellbeing, go away and pursuit of the Item takes up more and more bandwidth instead.  
---
My plan is to create a school where adventure gaming is a focus in the activities and materials. Right now I'm just building the foundation of the the ideas as Adventure Basics.
---
The fact is that this game is an example of remarkably educational adventure design, it stands alone, no other game came along and iterated, although other games emerged in similar threads of adventure, but in smaller scope, or different from adventure while still having educational gameplay (IE minecraft).
---
you dont have anything to say about it, the roll of the dice does.
---
&gt; So what populations are you expecting then? What is the max pop you will allow on a server after the layering phase? What will you do if the population stays above that?
---
Blizzard has always been silent about realm populations. It's a trade secret. That's not going to change now.
---
I was in a guild with the lead singer of Cannibal Corpse. He only lived 4 hours away and we got to go hang out with him for a day which was pretty cool
---
It shouldn't have been too big of a surprise... I mean... considering the number of people who participated on private servers elsewhere...
---
Fishing up that 6 slot bag is a habit of mine on new characters.
---
Litterally anything runs these. My gf has a 400$ one year old dell laptop and it's fine.
---
I know an invincible ogre in Dustwallow that we used to take on trips to Orgrimmar.
---
I can’t go right away because I’m a Mage but I will go to Darkshore at level 12.
---
I’ve so barely played Horde in my WoW history but I’m excited because I think I’m going to make a Troll Shaman. I want to heal and I know they don’t top HPS, but I love their lore and I like the complexity of their utility. I also love Shamanism IRL and want to RP a little.
---
Which race are you going? I’m pretty set on Troll for Resto, myself.
---
Me but replace it with anywhere from 1 month to 1 year ago.
---
Time constraints can lead to interesting compromises. 
---
&gt; Ah hell this is bad, but it works and I'll get to cleaning it up later.
---
Yee
---
Getting to like me
---
You will still see that tho?
---
Agreed, While i believe the raiding and the addition of heroic dungeons are fun, and even arena are fun, the rest of the expansion is unappealing. I would probably play if it they chose to go that route, but i wouldnt say im excited for it
---
If you didn’t play classic then you had to level 1-60 on BC anyways.
---
Tauren don't like goblins I guess
---
Not sure if this question was asked previously.
---
I know it's incredibly early to be thinking this far ahead but with all of the questions dealing with whether expacs will be coming next I was wondering:
---
After all the feature rollouts are long completed and we're getting to a point where C'thun has had enough of wiping raiders. are there any talks of rolling out "new" content that was previously unfinished or even creating new raid tiers, either retconning the next expacs or revisiting old conflicts from the RTS Warcraft days?
---
Thanks so much for putting this all together, can't wait for the grind!
---
&gt;If the answer is no, then its a waste of servers until it is removed.
---
Just say fuck it
---
Damn I'm not even counted yet and that's where all my old friends are planning to be.
---
Bannok Grimaxe/chest farming in the part at the bottom before the spiders
---
Any plans on banning people who account share to get world first 60 records? This was a huge thing on private servers, but they were never banned.
---
Can we also expect similar a similar anticheat to that of the regular client? Since there is a lot of grinding in Vanilla, it is almost expected that there will be bots one way or another. The original 1.12 anticheat is laughable in today's terms to say the least.
---
Bruh that is cute as shit 😂
---
MORE HOT POCKETS
---
Bless you.
---
I could tell you but I'm done talking to you
---
My super endgame ultimate goal would be Sulfuras. That's gonna take a *bit* of time. I'd also love to have Ironfoe. It's just a super dwarfy weapon that I'd love to have on my Paladin.
---
People were majorly PO'd and demanding that we all roll for it. I felt sortof bad saying "I'm a prot pally and this is the best in slot for me; sorry guys, but I'm keeping it.", but I doubt that if anyone else had picked it up instead of me, that they'd have agreed to roll for it either.
---
At least I equipped it immediately with the intent to use it. Most others would have just been rolling so they could sell it. I take that small bit of solace in my decision :-P
---
Medivh's staff, yes. Karazhan is his home so it's lore appropriate.
---
Hey, as you mentioned weapon speed, I wanted to point out something about the new attack tables. Due to 14% parry, when a boss is facing you, if you have 35% crit after suppression (which you'll probably want for flurry uptime), you'll need 25% +hit to avoid having some of your white (offhand) crits pushed off the table. Since this is... unlikely, that means the old misconception about a fast offhand eating more flurry charges than it produces becomes true when you are dual wield tanking. You're going to want a fast mainhand still, moreso than ever, but you'll want the slowest offhand possible if you want any kind of uptime on flurry. Also, you can't actually get above 35% crit on whites from the front of a boss anymore unless you stack like 20 weaponskill.
---
Pagle is the big dick Chad who found the Ashbringer and just left it there because he doesn't need it. Some say his fishing rod pales in comparison to his actual rod.
---
Right but if the hard cap is in place on release, that would mean that we ARE waiting for people to log off before we are let in.
---
I agree with the second option. Grapthic is personally ok for me, but pls no new content. We dont know how that will end, let vanilla just be vanilla.
---
Yeah, I'm going hard day 1, but I'm still doing 30 hours, 8 hours sleep first session, then going 16 up and 8 down for the rest of the week.  Pending how good I feel, might drop down to 6 hours because I'll pull 4-6 hours on weekdays for work anyway.
---
It's going to be more about getting up and taking regular breaks on flight paths to stretch my legs and not eating like a fat slob during a week of sitting in a chair.
---
Very pumped that Blizzard's answer is that they're leaning towards TBC. Classic+ is such a fundamentally dumb idea and yet people continued to insist that it was a valid way of thinking about the future of the Classic trilogy. I'm glad word of god has finally been spoken, hopefully those loons will pipe down.
---
&gt; and the math agrees with me.
---
I haven’t seen any math and what he’s saying makes sense assuming mana to heal ratio is similar.  
---
If you spend 40 mana to heal 50 damage or 80 mana to heal 100, the 80 mana is more efficient because you only need to heal once, so half the casting time and more regen time?
---
All this is assuming no overhealing.
---
What am I missing?
---
Can someone tell me the average length of a vanilla battleground?
---
Riding a saber as a non-NE race was a Vanilla rite of passage
---
Perhaps this isnt the game for you then.
---
I see you're familiar with my work. Thank you for the recognition.
---
This is what I've found as well. STV is a good example too. Go there at 30, and fewer quests will be accessible, mobs aggro easier, the enemy faction will more likely target you as a free kill. 
---
Waiting that extra level or two is worth is, since everything will just go more smoothly overall.
---
Lolret
---
Man i loved playing a Shammy, such a fun class. But ill never roll Horde, so Rogue it is &gt;:)
---
Haha... immolate I mean 😁
---
No, how can they expect everyone to leave Herod? That's not a solution you sperg. Begone!
---
Oh wow, this is yuge! This may have solidified my choice tbh, I was mostly dreading the run.

Dude crunch must have been so brutal for them xD
---
On my first run in deadmines I was only told to need something if I needed it. I just picked up enchanting, so I neeeeded everything, right? YIKES. I did not make any friends that day. The group was incredibly patient with me and I amazingly didn't get kicked. Good times.
---
Fun; there IS no one goal. You can enjoy your time in WoW and never get to level 60. You can have a blast in dungeons while others hate them. You could spend most of your time hunting people in world PVP, while others would opt for a PVE server. Some enjoy the endgame raiding while others want nothing to do with that. 
---
Unlike the modern game, what your "endgame" entails is wholly up to you.
---
I wish it showed classes on the BG screen. That's a small change I wouldn't mind.

This is different than a TV show intro showing the cast.  Streamers put on a "stream starting soon" intro to pad up the numbers before they start streaming.
---
This is such an excellent post, and honestly should have been made quite a while ago as answers many unanswered questions. 
---
But thanks for doing it now at least!
---
Inb4 removed.
---
i wanted some clarification on layering
---
* what determines when a new layer is "made"?
---
* when im forced onto another layer, do you attempt to prevent mobs from spawning/despawning around you,  
---
like in this [example](https://www.twitch.tv/frostlive/clip/SillyHomelyLegFloof)
---
* how often do you estimate that i will be forced to switch layers during say a 4 hour gaming session on a full pop server.
---
What are you, the team, most looking forward to in Classic?
---
What were your favorite moments that you hope to experience all over again?
---
I was going to mention the LBRS shortcut but simply... anytime you jump off of something in an instance, dismiss your pet first. The only possible exception is if you've cleared every possible route the pet could take to reach you after the jump - and even then there might be respawns.
---
amen to that.
---
this kind of line of thoughts is what differentiate a real "senior" from the others.
---
guidelines, best practice, bleeding edge and all the jazz are things to aim at but not necessarily the realistic goal when dealing with big scale / real deadline products.
---
some modern startup should learn this.
---
&gt; Well new ally guilds wont join Luci if it is already Horde favoured.
---
This just explains the general concept, but not why Lucifron is Horde dominated
---
That's a nice tip. Thanks for the info.
---
Elite Gamer Package... that’s actually a nightmare. Vote for net neutrality.

Doesn't this sort of fly in the face of the #nochanges thing you guys are posting on numerous other comments, though? Does any of what you said there really matter if it was part of Vanilla? The whole point is that we want Vanilla, flaws and all, and you guys are going so far as to implement technical limitations on combat and such just because it existed in Vanilla, yet you won't put this in because...? Seems inconsistent.
---
"no queue" 
---
4 servers is not enough for 0 queue.
---
regardless queues will be gone in a day or two.
---
Damn all the servers are realllllly filling up, I bet the queue is over exaggerated and they just want less servers with more pop, fine with me
---
This seems like a good spot in this thread to link this: https://youtu.be/E4yFfCcg4Q8
---
I'm willing to bet every realm that is created before release will be full and healthy for a long time. If they add more oh shit realms on release those are the ones I would try to avoid.
---
Not if the queue is hours long.
---
DAE SKY IS FALLING?
---
correct!
---
Make rolling a Night Elf leveling Ashenvale a living hell. I plan on wPvPing to the max. I love wPvP between levels 20-40. They are the best.
---
Don’t bother, there is no due process and the rules are meant as guidelines. You skirt close to what they don’t want you will get punished, referencing a fake document as support won’t ever help your case.
---
Once blizzard reaches out to you over something they perceive as rule breaking, they already made their decision and are just hoping you don’t end your sub in response
---
I’m so excited too man! I traded my Mac book for a pc just so I could enjoy wow haha. Cheers brotha
---
Yea if anyone try’s to put 5 mans with master loot that’s a huge red flag 🚩 
---
Gl filling your groups, would just be easier not to invite ppl who want “your” loot
---
Yeah. Finding happiness and meaning.
---
why would u openly advocate for giving hunters the ability to kite kazzak to stormwind in 2019? when someone did this back in the day, the only way to restore server stability and prevent kazzak from infinitely killing NPCs and players in the city with aoe shadowbolt volleys was to physically roll back the servers
---
My body is ready for the vanilla soundtrack on loop.
---
It's definitely been a long time, but I'm like 99% certain paid transfers weren't a thing at any point in vanilla. This is fine, and will probably be for the best if these server pops don't go down by phase 2.
---
Naxx is already power creep though.  IMO we need to consider our options BEFORE phase 6.
---
Would have be nice to add language for EU
---
Sir?
---
I agree, there's definitely a difference. However, at least in my experience on Nostalrius, the perceived difference is much smaller than the numbers implicate.
---
Wait what, cat7? Brb
---
If you say so. Game's still great, lol.
---
You can buy those of the auction house.
---
Thats literally what this entire game is dude. The world firsts happened 15 years ago.
---
I'm at my char creation screen right now.
---
+20 AP, don't really get anything better until their trinket from Dire Maul in Phase 2.
---
Guess what I’m not doing tonight
---
aye no specific break up's of guilds yet .
---
'' Participants in the Classic Race to World First will seek to be the first players to level their personal characters to Level 60, then attempt to lead their guilds from around the world to be the first group of 40 players to kill the legendary "end bosses" Ragnaros and Onyxia.  ''  
---
hence the ''their guilds'' meaning multiple guilds so we can probably assume esfand and tipsout both pushing their own guilds
---
Bad troll is bad
---
thats one tall dwarf
---
Have you all been reading the unarmored mounts thread on the official forums? A lot of us would love to see them in phase 1.
---
I don't think it you can make any changes to a character after you create it. so the only way is to delete the character and make a new one.
---
I'd recommend to do that at like after 4 a.m. when no one else is doing it if it's a player name that people want
---
uh, no
---
And literally nothing has happened since then.
---
Does this mean Benediction will drop in P1?
---
I hope not because it would make priests waaay too strong in P1 if this is the case. Please don't do this.
---
&gt; leagues 
---
I was trying to figure out why that name was familiar. Yeah, I imagine people who have a schedule that allows them to play those month long race leagues have become accustomed to that sort of toll on the body are pretty well-suited to grinding to level 60.
---
What were they thinking, adding a service to Classic that was in Vanilla? THE HORROR!
---
For sure! Locking in that mount means more then rushing 60.
---
I predict no queue at all, @Lokhe is right
---
So you didn't read the whole post, at least my argument isn't just "I am right so fuck you". also you cannot create channels in classic so your statement is moot. 
---
I dont like punching boulders. Ttyl
---
15$ is assuming your American... It's like 18$ in Canada...
---
Seems like a great idea to me!
---
Sure they can, everyone above the population cap gets queued and if the queues are bad because the server is stuffed they might offer transfers to other, less populous, servers.
---
Unless you communicate this beforehand. I have no problem as a paladin saying something like "I'll heal Deadmines, but I want to roll on Smite's Hammer." Even the healing specs need damage weapons for leveling. 
---
This situation changes closer to 60 when you start to talk about farming your pre-raid gear, but again the best answer really is to confirm with your group that even though you're healing you want to roll on certain off-spec items.
---
If you are postion 34,204 on a 30,000 max realm then you are better off re-rolling
---
Retail most certainly will give you the 100% answer.  Classic is based on a stripped down version of the legion/bfa client.
---
Can you send me the cords Mankrik's wife?
---
So you’re saying I should quest in my own starting zone till level 6 and then head to Teldrassil and do the 1 to 6 quests again because only one of them is gray? 
---
Don’t green quests also give less rep or am I wrong?
---
Not with masterloot buddy
---
Thank you kind stranger!!
---
Please stop, I can only get so errect.
---
As classic is based patch 1.12, will dungeons such as scholo and strat be in there easier versions that came in with the dungeon tier sets t0.5 at release?
---
Will the system to achieve High Warlord remain the same as it was? 
---
I suppose it will and that many support that for #nochanges, but it seemed flawed in the amount of time and effort required to get it. To the point where it required things like multiple people playing one character 24/7, guilds on opposite factions working together to establish who would get it next, etc...
---
It would be nice if even if it took years of playing, that you didn't have to play so much in such a short window of time, making it literally impossible as it was then for probably 99.99999% of players.
---
Compare to clearing Naxx, which is also absolutely extremely difficult, yet still more feasible to achieve without destroying your life and health. Percentage of players for clearing Naxx was what, 2-4%? Which is still in a whole different league easier than HWL.
---
What took so damn long?
---
If I don’t hit 60 I agree but if I’m 60 I’ll feel fine waiting til evening for dungeons as I’ll be maybe one of 50-100 60s.
---
Why the fuck did I read all of this?
---
I don't mind the idea of servers for TBC, and Wrath. I would certainly hope they wouldn't make the current roll to it. Leave Vanilla, make new for TBC, then new for Wrath. Honestly Wrath would be my home if they made it. That was my favorite Xpac.
---
¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Will there be holidays like Hallow's End? I need me some Hoseman quotes.
---
Doing a 7 days water fast while playing. Will be good.
---
Man if you're comparing Perseption to Hardiness you have no idea how strong this ability is.
---
"based"
---
Paid transfers came out in 2006 (latter half of vanilla) and had a 6 month cooldown. You could transfer from PvE -&gt; PvE or PvP -&gt; PvE/PvP but not PvE -&gt; PvP. They also did free transfers relatively early on for some servers. I.E. a significant amount of people went from Illidan to Stonemaul.
---
I remember when Lord Kazzak was summoned to Ironforge a few days before TBC came out on Andorhal.
---
I'm with you on this but as a shaman whose going enhance needs to let the group know hey I'm rolling on enhance gear.
---
Totally rolling a druid now.
---
The sad reality I had to learn to live with as a druid. Until a tank dies and you save the day with either a brez or by going bear yourself. I think they do excel, just in unconventional ways. Cheers.
---
I see what you are saying but it requires assuming that had the internet remained a public utility speeds would have gotten faster and prices would have gone down. That hypothesis is not possible to verify because it didn't remain a public utility. 
---
It also gets into very murky territory like what is fair? I pay $60 a month for 500mbps down with a 1tb cap (that I hit once in 2 years after downloading my entire steam library)
---
Is this gouging? If so, would a 2tb cap and $40 a month become "not gouging"? What about a 3tb cap and $20 a month? Can the business and service be sustained at this price? Why not just free internet and no cap? Would the government have been able to simply dictate these lower prices because they are artificially too high, or is there something about the price that reflects a reality about the costs of the service plus a reasonable profit to make the effort worthwhile?
---
These other prices become meaningless under scrutiny because the relevant price is the one I'm paying, that I have voluntarily decided to pay in exchange for the service, that is based on my local market for substitutable services.
---
No, he's said he's going to level but not trying for world first.  He's said he's got health problems and doesn't want to over stress himself on release week.  Although, he could very well still be competitive on a /played perspective.
---
After he levels, his focus is going to shift towards putting his guide in UImod and releasing that.
---
Yo!
---
Master looter does exist and should be used by every warrior running BRD.
---
Leveling ret pally. Going to heal most dungeons. Will be organizing my own groups for the most part and telling them I am rolling on dps gear if it’s an upgrade
---
Need is your best talent
---
Your first two sentences are very contradictory
---
Thanks for compiling these. Since the topic is Q&amp;A related, need to check a couple of things with /r/classicwow:
---
* Silly Question #1: Aside from an active subscription, do I need to buy the current expansion (BFA) to play Classic? I quit at the end of Legion. 
---
* Silly Question #2: What official WoW client do I download for Classic?
---
Thanks in advance.
---
At some point, my guild was looking for any way to progress faster and we kind of figured it out, but this was after getting halfway through MC. I think there were websites that actually did the math and made their own BiS, but they were not as good as the guides out now. Usually, it would say something like "the dungeon set is good, but if you want to maximize your damage at the expense of your health, mana, and spirit you can get better burst damage.
---
Like, of course, you didn't care about your health in a raid if your DPS if you actually followed the strategy you shouldn't be betting that much damage, and downranking spells can save a lot of mana, so that was less of an issue, especially for a Warlock.
---
I wonder if the early raids are going to be "too easy" because of the collective knowledge gained over the years.
---
Because I don't want to.
---
They shouldn’t be calling this “world first.” They need to call it something like the “last first”
---
Talk about loot before hand. That's what we did back then. We COMMUNICATED with each other
---
Never too late my friend.
---
Go with honor!
---
Thanks matey, sounds good.
---
You're absolutely right.
---
However, if Skeram and Blaumeux reach full or high, I can't imagine we'd have enough realms for everyone come launch day. They've even told us they have emergency realms on standby for launch.
---
That’s awesome. Congrats to you guys for keeping it real.
---
It’s from vanilla release wise
---
It is for sure until 30+, it's the best dmg per rage ability you have for a long time.
---
and btw, readers ARE subs, I turned off reddit's css and members becomes readers
---
Doesn't matter to you maybe. But no one cares about you, certainly not all the people competing.
---
This should be reconsidered, in my opinion. Not having corpses/skeletons left behind takes away from the experience.
---
It's really cool to actually see the amount of corpses after a huge world PvP battle.
---
Ironforge Airfield was at some point intended to be reachable through that giant gateway off to the side of it, though. Same with Old Ironforge. But because the scale of Ironforge as a whole got cut back from what it was originally intended, they just turned it into a FP vista.
---
Can't tell of /s or not but, no. Before that word was used for *that*, it was used to relate to a tricked out/highly geared low level characters. Generally for the purpose of low character level but high skill PvP in certain brackets (lvl19, 29, 39, etc)
---
Yea I agree. I wouldn’t mind seeing TBC and WoTLK. They’re both not even comparable to how bad Cata was.
---
This is entirely anecdotal but here is my take on WSG length for different situations from Retro-Wow private server. Assuming people play objectives and not HK farm 
---
Pug vs premade = 7 mins
---
Prem v prem equal skill = 30-1hr 
---
Pug v Pug  20-45 mins
---
For the HK farming games, pugs get bored at around the 1hr mark
---
It will have virtually zero effect on your experience.
---
Your safest bet would be rp-pvp since it's at medium, and remember medium in wow classic is far more people then the most overcrowded servers in Vanilla WoW.
---
RP-pvpers is usually out of character when questing, Dungeons and raids. Then they roleplay in player made events so you don't have to be scared of playing on one.
---
Your alternative is firemaw, but I suspect it will be full once release.
---
They already fixed reckoning wayyy back when a dude one shot a WB.
---
The game peaked in 2010, so he would’ve been 13 at its peak.  Which means that by 15, he may well have noticed it begin to gradually decline, as well as witnessing the addition of more gimmicky stuff + less challenging gameplay. I was two years older than him and felt the exact same way, so I quit at the start of Mists. I remember my friends and other players mocking how WoW was “EZmode now” as far back as Wrath/Cataclysm. 
---
It’s really not that far-fetched. Why are you getting heated about this?
---
I have a shitty laptop. Just bought a serial to usb converter for an old monitor so I can play with a second screen
---
Off to the circus with you.
---
Afaik this problem occured first during the 40-45 test, it was just fine before. I bug reported it, but I feel like practically no one else is aware of this and I want to prevent this being in the game at all cost because I'm nearly certain it's bugged and it's just gamebreaking.
---
Okay, what the fuck do you want?  No one can login to classic.  Rub two brain cells together and make an educated guess.
---
Priests have a 1-hour buff that gives shadow resist, but I think it isn't locked to shadow, and is baseline. I might be wrong and missremembering though.
---
Maybe servers are down.
---
I recreated all of my toons last night so Im ready to go.
---
Can confirm: Had Gressil and Hungering as a Fury Warrior.
---
I was an unstoppable death machine lol.
---
Irrelevant, EU keeps beating NA despite 1 day disadvantage.
---
No, I just redid my build last year. Hope it runs good for ya though.
---
I would see it the other way around. Since Paladin is mainly auto attacks I would level to 6 in the Human starting area. By then you'll have Judgement, Seal of Righteousness &amp; Crusader, Holy Light, Blessing of Might, Devotion Aura and Divine Protection and can head to the NE starting area with a pretty solid toolkit.
---
I would go back to IF at levels 10 and 18 to grab new spells and most importantly new ranks of Seal of Righteousness. At lvl 18 you could gather all the quests for DM and reach lvl 20 if you want to get Verigans Fist. Otherwise you could just skip that part and keep questing in the NE areas.
---
day/session, you know what I mean.  
---
Funny thing, when I was in college I moved to a "6 day week" by staying up 20 hours, sleeping 8.  Because I found that I was barely sleeping (or not sleeping) nights and added up 8x6 and was getting more sleep that way.  Was an interesting experiment for a semester.
---
Everything has beed said, so I just want to point out the necessity of adapting the event to this time. It won't be the same experience if it's not changed.
---
If youre a business with a recent history of going for every coin possible for as little risk as possible, it is. Esp if its "unnecessary" risk in comparison to the alternative (tbc).
---
This is certainly going to help hunters with the broken tooth grind. Perks for leveling a hunter in phase 1. Can check all the layers from your guildies inviting you for the spawn.
---
You're missing a key element in that sentence above, "\[A\]t this time."  
---
Do you really feel so entitled to be the white-knight for a subreddit?  
---
Grow up, that's pathetic.
---
It's not a single method guild working together, just a bunch of random streamers racing separately.
---
Light mode?
---
Honestly i came full circle, from humans, then elfs, then not-so-pretty races, back to humans. Idk why, i just tired of picking something as far from human as it can be. And in case of a gnome i would just pretend it's a dragon fooling aroun, bonus points for picking dragon-esque name; same with other races, i pretend it's something other.
---
Real talk, I think from previous responses the message is this: It's TBC or nothing.
---
They have essentially said, it's easy AF to release TBC, they are going to revisit TBC during the classic lifestyle, and if there is a demand, they will re release it. But they have mentioned absolutely nothing about classic + afaik.
---
I think the route to classic+, if it's at all possible, is a huge hemmoraging of players from Retail to classic combined with a strong community distaste for TBC over Classic +.
---
I think the most realistic outcome is a split playerbase with Classic+ vs TBC, resulting in them deciding not to pursue it. Instead there will be a canon reset of retail bringing it more in line with retail, like a cataclysm 2.0.
---
&gt; gamebreaking.
---
You don't need to learn how to write them. Look for a shaman macro guide that will explain what each one does. If it sounds like it's doing something that you want then just copy and paste it. 
---
You can certainly get by without them, they just make things easier.
---
The problem with Golemag is the amount of streamers.
---
Significantly more active than r/wow
---
The cutscenes and cinematics alone total up to 5 hours.
---
Iam sad that you didnt follow us swedes to Gehennas, would have loved to have you here. Eitherway hope you have a wounderful time on Firemaw.
---
You must trade away the part of your mind that prioritized sleep
---
Shit was brutal. But I was unemployed and had nothing else to do at the time
---
You can look this up on youtube! should be a lot of helpful guides on there!
---
You don't KNOW there's more horde on the other layer. You'll be away from THOSE alliance, but there's no reason that there's not another pack in some other zone. 
---
There's still no trade layer. One person would have to be selling to a ton of different people to cause any form of effect. You'll be inviting people to layer 2, while others will be invited FROM layer 2. If the same 10 people keep reading between each other, sure, they'll combine on the same layer, but there's Zero "natural" stacking occurring. That's also assuming you invite instead of being invited for a trade.
---
There's plenty time for them to put in crossrealm BGs then should single server fail.
---
I actually appreciate how they are rolling servers.  It's being really respectful towards each servers longevity.   As uncomfortable as it may seem to some, it really was a good idea.
---
Have you guys thought about keeping classic the way it is but just adding the new and updated character models and graphics?
---
I feel like that’s one of the main things I’d miss from current wow is just the updated art.
---
Ok so, name my character
---
Would you ever consider a poll system later on in the life of classic wow? Similar to the one RuneScape classic uses? For adding quality of life updates and things of that nature. (75% vote needed to pass any updates that change the game at all)
---
Exact same thing here! I worked my ass off last week at work to try and catch up for next week, and now i don't have a whole lot to do.  Did a lot around the house over the wekeend in prep for launch, now just the slow wait.  Luckily going out of town for the weekend which should hopefully make time go by faster lol.
---
You’re doing gods work
---
If they don’t want 5 hour queue then they can reroll to other server or other faction. With cross realm bg we will have 80% horde 20% alliance servers mostly. World pvp will be dead in 1 year.
---
nochanges
---
Don't worry. Soon enough you will be waiting on another countdown.
---
I want new servers every 2 years for 20 years
---
They said "several hours or more" for Herod in the AMA.
---
can only agree, i stopped liking OSRS when GE came out. but the game pulled me back in with the ironman challange, i would agree that overall its a better game now. but the game now is more appelled to the masses, and that perfectly good too i think. its just not for me anymore ( also because after they annonced classic wow i couldnt think of any other game, so had a hard to putting in the hours to keep playing osrs) :)
---
People who say this is too long of an intro need to watch trainwreckstv lmao
---
Hi Hypnoticus, I am interested in looking for a guild that is gonna be doing some end tier raiding and pvping and is just a nice group to hangout with and level with as well. I am gonna be on faerlina and will be horde side as a warrior. Not sure if you are looking for warriors or not but I will be playing a lot the first week of launch to level and I start a new job the following week so I am not 100% sure of my schedule after that, but I am assuming I will be off and home around 6-7pm PST.   
---
Played during original release and did most raids and all dungeons before later changes, so I remember the good old days of having to use your tool kit on trash packs and making sure to CC rather than just pulling crazily haha. I am 28 years old and just looking to enjoy the game again and make some new friends as most of my old friends have since quit WoW entirely.  
---
Let me know if interested, if not no hard feelings. Hope to hear from you :)  
---
P.S. you can contact me on here or via bnet or discord.  
---
Bnet: Ashkabash#1592  
---
Discord: Bbasher#2635
---
Well, Ziz died, and unless the other team died they had no chance of coming back. That's like being upset that someone who crashed at Nascar or F1 didn't finish the race.
---
Definitely. You can use the time by teleporting instead of running to a FP and flying to farm the silver it costs and you will earn XP and have a chance at great drops.
---
We get it.  We'll never know what we want until people much smarter than us tell us what we want.
---
Worst case scenario is you end up on a low pop server. Guess what blizzard will do...open realm transfers or server merges.
---
It happened with original WoW as well. They made a ton of servers after the initial influx of people and many of them ended up dead by the time TBC was out. Luckily the game hit another growth spurt so some recovered, but yea it was bumpy at times.
---
I'll be rolling a dwarf priest, however much prefer the night elf saber mounts over dwarf rams, so will likely run my dwarf to the nelf starting area asap. If running there at level 1 is viable, I'll probably do it without delay.
---
Forget work I started grad school this week too lol. Good thing Syllabus Week is a thing. But next week is going to be a drag.
---
Got it, I knew the quests part, didnt know you actually got any xp, so thats good I suppose.
---
I'm keen on Vanilla.  
---
I have 'XL', 'icecube' and 'twitchprime' on Shazzrah
---
I agree. I don't really care for WotLK anymore but that shouldn't mean other people can't play it. I just don't want my Classic characters forced into new expansions, so... new servers for each expansion.
---
how dare u use this kind of rhetoric to describe classic
---
Oo
---
Just think about how relieved she’d be when she found out you weren’t cheating on her.  She’d probably love you even more.
---
This is a true win-win!  I’m happy to be the fall guy if it doesn’t end well.
---
There are no positive experiences in retail anymore. The arena community hates the PVE community. The PVE community hates the Arena community. The rated BG community is banned every 2 months for exploits and selling carries. The normal people left and a lot of skilled players left because their friends are excluded. This all happened in Cata when people who literally called themselves "elitist jerks" started taking over the game. WoW was never meant to be an esport and all the original designers said it was a mistake. Now go back at the streamer you worship that is trying to stay relevant. Good MMO's don't have a playerbase that is watching a streamer. The people are actually playing the game and invested in the world.
---
The only playerbase modern WoW is people with bad taste or computers that can't run a real good story RPG like Witcher 3 and people who are delusional and think that MMO esports will ever be relevant or cared about when the original designers of WoW called them a mistake. If they were good at esports they would be playing esports games that actually matter. Instead they ruin the game they are on. Blizzard even made these people a esport game (Overwatch) and they don't even plkay it.  Catering to them was a huge mistake and OLD Blizzard knows it. New Blizzard is just delusional Bobby Kotick who thinks he can become the NFL, due to having delusional friends like Robert Kraft who owns the Patriots and got bored of getting arrested with hookers.

because of the law of unintended consequences
---
Iron forge airfield, per John Staats, was added as a flight path decoration only. That’s is the only reason it and the Troll village exist. 
---
Portal in Stormwind was supposed to lead to player housing. But that was abandoned pre-Beta. Again, per John Staats.
---
Grim Batol and Hyjal were covered in retail. Twice in the case of Hyjal. So I doubt they’d do much with either.
---
amazing work to be sure, i do think the symbols a little 2 perfect somehow
---
You have that backwards. A twink is just the young gay male version of a sugarbaby. And it was used older mmo's because that was basically the relationship between someone that twinked their character and had an higher leveled character gear them up, and then the term carried over in WoW after BG's were released.

as a shaman or druid with nature's swiftness, i'd have a macro for NS-&gt;big heal. maybe some other macroes calling out combat ress etc. on my warrior i'd have some weapon swap ones. just small things to make life a bit easier. you don't have to learn anything, just find the ones you may need online. you don't *have* to have them though. it's all up to you and your play style.

---
Playing on a nice laptop with a fried nvidia card count? Using plan ole integrated Intel 4600 graphics.
---
No, this is incorrect.  They confirmed that there is a population cap on the servers themselves, even with layering.
---
&gt;While we are able to fit several times more players on a single realm in 2019 than was the case in 2006, we are not going to raise that cap any further, even though we have the technical capacity to do so. Raising realm caps would simply forestall the problem, letting more players in at launch but creating an unsustainable situation down the line, with severe queues when we turn off layering permanently before Phase 2 of our content unlock plan.
---
Why would you restrict that? Let the players play how they want, if there's a demand for those tools, let them use it. It shouldn't affect you.

Oh, you poor summer child. *turns around and walks away*

Duh, it’s a start up intro. It’s supposed to be long. Instead of looking at a wallpaper screen listening to what ever song that is playing he created a video
---
I’m expecting them to get burned on the US and delay EU - Pokemon Go style.

Absolutely this. AND after an hour when You finaly enter one. Surprise,  surprise its a premade.

"Patch 1.12.0 Highlights: Cross-realm battlegrounds"

Jakenbake? Djari? Sco?  
---
These are people in your roster grinding 20h/day for a week?
---
But "For the Horde!" is catchy. Alliance just does not feel like they would die for it, every faction (by races or cities) there for the sake of power in numbers, horde is binded together to survive, look at forsaken, friends to none.
---
And I always have been. Lok’tar my dude, have a chill time in your rad alliance only leveling zones, they’re awesome.
---
You do not need to have BFA to play Classic WoW. I Tested this last night as I resubbed a second account that only has Wotlk and it let me reserve names. In Battle.net right above the play button there is a drop down menu and you can select World of Warcraft Classic. Once selected it will download like any other game.
---
Which is why expansions like WoD disabled flying until later. They knew exactly what impact it had on the games.
---
Boy they really had to time it for the beginning of the semester? Fuck off.
---
You deleted your comment, why not delete this thread?
---
As much as I'm generally on board with the #nochanges mentality this is one of the few instances we're I heavily disagree. As many have already pointed out this will only lead to the event being over within an hour.
---
I was sort of looking forward to more videos of 15 pallies or 15 warlocks down UBRS...
---
Lok Tar Ogar,
---
Will you be adding events/achievements to vanilla? Anything like timed dungeons/raids?
---
Anything in the works for "end game" content? For example, heroic dungeon runs, new world bosses, etc.
---
Just curious, I can't wait for that old school groove.
---
Adoriopius
---
Not authentic without you losing your memories of the game!
---
Ok so I'm going to level up 3 male tauren warriors with Balkan names, always use a mediocre weapon and backpedal. Thanks for the tips!
---
Feels like y’all are really off base with this - the game ought to feel the same not be exactly the same. You’ve made this clear in other aspects, why let this entire event be ruined by a change of heart now?
---
yup
---
back in classic certain rogues thought they were the shit for outdpsing epics
---
It's not huge, but definitely significant. A big part of being scared when entering any area was seeing the ground littered with skeletons (and then instantly dying to the 60 rogue that is camping that fucking yeti cave)
---
For sure. #nowaifus
---
^ this so much.
---
I've got a character reserved on Farelina.. I fit in to your description (early 30s) and most likely will be playing that same amount of time during the week. I don't have any friends that play WoW, and have lost track of all my old WoW/CS/COD friends from back in the day, so definitely looking for a group to play with.
---
I haven't really played since Vanilla/BC, and my main was a priest (shadow)..But I'd be open to rolling a different DPS class. Shoot me a message if interested.
---
I clearly remember people using their Naxx gear even at 70. First blue of Tbc my ass
---
The speedrunners are fully erect
---
Aww man! Now THAT is nostalgic!
---
My right ear liked this video
---
You had to be pretty hardcore to have these .
---
I don't understand why they even thought of that idea. Its completely unreasonable to make a tunnel like that through half of the planet even for a game.
---
So like, this is a thing I'm interested in. I was neck deep in WoW until getting deployed to Iraq when my guild was a few bosses deep in AQ40. Would love to beat my old progress.
---
But the pricing model is actually kind of upsetting. Charging 2004 prices for a 2004 product in 2019 isn't right. This needs to be discussed.
---
This. Once people are a couple of phases (and sunken cost has got its teeth in) in they can start the monetisation and these mounts would really sell well.
---
Whoops, I shouldnt have said arena. Thanks for the catch.
---
Classic comes out in 6 days.
---
It depends on the class. If you just look them up and copy paste the 5 most useful macros you’ll be right to be in the 1% best players of that class. You don’t need to bother till 60 though really.
---
Will rogue with spelldmg be legitimate?
---
I know what quests lead where a lot better than I did the first time around, but I'm still going in without a plan. I'm casual and I am playing for nostalgia. No plan is what I remember and what I want to experience again.
---
Transfer and play the game or keep your names on Herod and wait in queue. There is nothing to fix.
---
No. It was fixed with the new engine. If you go out of bounds you will be ported back to town.
---
the only answer i need to see
---
Was ally first time around.
---
Horde side this time. &gt;:)
---
The end.
---
I’ve been planing a bit what I’ll do when I hit lvl 60, but my journey will be without quest helper or most other addons, just me going through the content like the good old days!
---
Hey look, during the AMA they confirmed it was a bug with layering and explained the cause of the bug, turns out it had nothing to do with the sharding system and how it functions!
---
Ah good, so completely avoidable.
---
nah, the player base was at it’s peak during wotlk and started declining with Cata... Businesswise it makes sense to satisfy the greater number and aim for wotlk, plus it’s the easiest route. I’d rather that than getting potentially disappointing new content for a Classic+
---
This is about what I want, not what Blizzard wants. If the community pushes for it, they'll listen.
---
How is that an obscure reference?
---
Right? You might get one item *maybe* but you'll have plenty of time to go and upgrade your other slots.
---
Any thoughts on just leaving Dishonorable Kills out entirely?  The two or so months where Honor was in and DHKs were not were the golden age of world PvP, and I'm heartbroken to see that the phases are pushing DHKs and Honor simultaneously.  Not vanilla.
---
Most players don't even understand what they were, which is unfortunate for dialogue on the issue.  DHKs were a small penalty to that week's ranking for killing a Civilian flagged npc, and absolutely nothing else.  No protection for grey ganking players, no permanent penalty on someone's ability to rank, and it didn't really affect anyone who wasn't already pushing rank 10+.
---
What DHKs did do was wall off city raiding for people going for GM/HW.  As a city-raid focused guild leader, these things are pure toxicity to me.
---
There is an obvious solution and what you've said over your various post is that you're too lazy to attempt the solution.
---
What would be a "correct rollout" in your professional, behind the scenes access, game developer opinion?
---
there's a big difference between winging it and seeing what happens. Now let's see what happens
---
4 warrior 1 priest
---
My guess, it will be incredibly easy to get into a raid guild in classic. I think a lot more people will be raiding in classic than were in vanilla.
---
Just what I always wanted. "Esport athletes" who aren't good enough to play esports that actually pay money like Overwatch, to passively aggressively attack Classic, while ignoring the fact that tier 1 (and 2) have been nerfed multiple times. They are about as easy as WOTLK Naxx 25 that Kungen cleared with 10 people in the first week.
---
Some of the nerfs. 16 debuffs instead of 8 which is enormous. Itemization which skyrockets dps and healing, Warriors doing 2-3 x the damage they did in earlier patches, since they were buffed in AQ. One handed fury was not even viable and it's top dps. 
---
This is just going to be used to attack Classic WoW by Blizzard's "yes men" esports organization that might as well be a division of Activision at this point. I guarantee they will not once mention all the nerfs done to the content.
---
Lol, lowest pop count for NA and yet the grob mob has more members on it's subreddit than the rest of the PvE servers combined, and more than any other PvP server. Not to mention, an almost perfect 50/50 alliance/horde ratio right now.
---
Yeah, I think we're doing fine. RP players are more hyped than anyone else and will see the least attrition.
---
Yeah I remember how many people were literally against classic. Now you hardly see any comments/posts/videos about it.
---
Yesssss that's it!
---
&gt;k is a much faster leveler and has a self heal. The only decent shaman raid spec really is resto, so don't get any ideas about doing dps. Shaman will also be heavily populate
---
So you think Shamans will be a more popular class overall?
---
noice
---
Yikes. Are we on that narrative now? Now TBC was the start of WoW dying now and not cata? Funny how things change.
---
Lmao right how retarded is that.
---
&gt;what you're thinking of is called a bulletin board forum.
---
No idea what this is supposed to me, but sure.
---
Anyway, Reddit is the shitpost capital of the internet.  Gamer subs are the meme central stations. If you're looking for "quality submission forums" you're in the wrong neighborhood, chief.
---
Yes, definitely
---
Hey Craig, I think I'm in the same boat as you. Recently at work I dislocated both shoulders simultaneously. Under doctors orders I cant drive it lift anything up. I bought one of those left handed mouse's on amazon so I can still play (even if I have 1 mouse resting on my chest) and the other to the right of the keyboard. 
---
Let me know how it works out for you or what you find helps!

Not gonna keep wasting my time with you, but you should consider reevaluating what you think is a justified reason to call complete strangers idiots (Their comment wasn't one btw).
---
i do have a lenovo t480 i want to install it on and see how well it does on intel graphics. but most of the time ill be playing at 3440 x 1440 on my main rig
---
Socialize a lot.  Classic WoW is probably one of the most social games there is.
---
Add value to the experiences of others, and they’ll add value to yours.
---
This game is a two-way street.
---
Id much rather have OSRS with polls then 0 updates.
---
Since all weapons/gears/items are updated to their 1.12 versions, it should give the non-consumable version.  I'd love to get confirmation from Blizzard though.
---
Please take this to r/classicwowplus

Thanks a lot for this very thorough guide!

I managed to finally open the Battlenet client but I see no option to install Classic, only Retail (there is a single button that says "Free trial").  
---
The version of the client is 1.15.1.11346  
---
Fyi, I couldn't log in at first, and even after I finally managed to do so, the client would crash. Strangely enough, the issues I had were simply fixed by... trying and trying again (without even restarting my computer).  
---
Do I have to be a WoW suscriber first to see the option to install Classic? Do I need to install Retail first (you seem to say it's not necessary)?
---
Golemagg for pvp, mirage raceway for pve
---
An occupation where you are the criminal, the victim and the detective all at the same time :-)
---
Just think, in a week we can stop hearing the whining about these fucking mounts.
---
You just have to go in with the "it's a close as we can get" mindset, and not worry about every exact detail being perfect.  Otherwise you'll just be focused on finding things wrong with it instead of finding ways to enjoy it.
---
AV was a heart breaker, but one I expected.
---
&gt; Now TBC was the start of WoW dying
---
Well, you invalidated WoW 1.0 and set a president of bad expansion roll out.
---
&gt;ly real problems ElvUI had in the last stress test was unitframes not showing hp, castbar, debuff timers (same for nameplates) and backpack being buggy. Otherwise it was working fine.
---
that's somewhat unrelated. As default UI doesn't show enemy target HPs, Castbars and debuff timers anyways. All of those functionalities come from other addons like RealMobHealth, ClassicAuraDuration and other things like that. It remains to be seen if the Elvui devs are planning to do their own version of those addons to be working straight out of Elv or if they plan to add compatibility with other addons, right now, while RealMobHealth works great on standard Unitframes, it doesn't work on Elv.
---
You get an ID as soon as you kill the first trash mob anyway. There wasn't really a pug scene during vanilla. So don't expect any in classic.
---
I'll be taking Bloodthirst.
---
Would we get supermajority on no flying mounts TBC?
---
"LF invite to another layer"
---
I just realized this as well. My eyes would hurt staring at that for more than a minute.
---
" how you can tell which faction *actually* has the more mature players. "
---
haha well we know you're not one of them.
---
the game literally is built around faction rivalry
---
Exactly my thought lol.  you’re doing something wrong if you’re a frost mage and lose against an arms warrior.
---
Layering bro.  
---
Should be fun.
---
4 warrior 1 pally
---
Man I wish pfui was being ported to classic. Tragic :(
---
i'm in the same boat as him.  the most fun i've ever had games were for expansion releases or when old school runescape dropped and it was a mad house/race to the highest level and doing the most quests.  It's just fun seeing what everyone decides to do with their time and see the real grinders duke it out.  different strokes man.  every launch has been hectic but still manageable/playable and expansion launches were WAY bigger than this.  dunno why everyone is freaking the fuck out lmao
---

Why not ? I'm pro classic+, i can understand some don't like that idea. But if you're pro classic+ why not add races aswell ?

Good luck being on the same layer as them regardless

---
First of all, thank you for your work, you are making many, many people happy, like me. 
---
About this answer, seems to me an awful decision that makes no sense. You might as well just take down the chat if that's the reason. Please, reconsider it...
---
These were just an urban legend on my old server... And then I remembered I played on a 2nd or 3rd wave realm.      Don't know if even one person had one.
---
Well that's just ridiculous. Max pop once we go to 1 layer massively affects gameplay, are you joking.
---
Impressive.
---
people say that because of flying
---
Personally I dont hate flying, I think it allowed for interesting zone design
---
This intro is so good. He represented a shadow priest and THEN a holy priest. he really represented a lot of the known bad-ass character types in vanilla. I absolutely love it.
---
So you think every server released after that change was made were "not authentic"?
---
I think you mean wait for it to turn red ;)
---
They already told people not to roll on full servers if people don’t listen that’s their fault
---
Well...I have a plan, but by most accounts, I'm still going to be a casual leveler.
---
I plan on working on my profs during the week, then leveling with two other dudes on the weekends. I also plan on stopping and smelling the flowers along the way. 
---
The first time I leveled up (TBC), I just wanted to get to cap as fast as possible. This time, I want to really soak it all in.
---
I think they will stay on Shazz no matter what.. but everything can happen before launch.
---
aap?
---
Hi guys! Hope things aren’t too hectic leading up to the big day.
---
About how long can we expect the phases to last? I’m particularly curious about phases 1 and 2. Is this something that has been decided already or is it maybe more of a “wait and see” approach?
---
Priest, Warrior, Rogue, Mage Paladin.
---
Healing Priest
---
Tanking Warrior
---
DPS Rogue and PvP mainliner
---
DPS Mage for food portals and CC
---
Paladin for offhealing/damage and buffing the party
---
Tank: Warrior
---
Healer: Priest
---
DPS 1: Rogue
---
DPS 2: Mage
---
Utility / DPS 3: Shaman
---
I would say it really depends on what you want to do endgame (no arenas in classic BTW). 
---
Warlock will always dps and has great utility/damage in later tiers, plus their leveling is faster. You will need bag space for soul shards to cast spells, but they have great cc and dots in pvp (dot and spam fear basically).
---
Shamans can dps and heal, though in most raids you will be coerced to heal just because heals will be hard to find. They have a lot of cool 1 shot builds that can make PVP exciting (see cdew in classic beta tourney) whether you want to melee w wind fury or cast a hard hitting chain lightning.
---
I would say Shamans are the more difficult class but it’s a new server so I always advocate going something you haven’t done before. Plus WINdfury.
---
It's something like that - imagine there's a table with a shitload of stuff stacked on it. It's all packed really tight and any movement could cause something expensive to fall. And this table has four legs, three of them are modern, strong and just pleasant to look at. But you also have the fourth leg, old, battered and downright hideous.
---
You want to replace it, you know you will **probably** have to replace it as some point, as more and more things are stacked on the table and this leg is the most probable to fail first. But also, it's very risky as changing anything may move the table, causing stuff to drop, and, of course, there's also chance of undiscovered bugs (most probably termites) hidden inside the new leg.
---
So it's balancing act - old leg is bad but is also confirmed to work **right now**, which is something that you just don't throw out on production, it's too valuable. The goal is to get new one just before the cost of replacement soars or before it fails. However, it's really fucking easy to miss the mark...
---
And yet, you're still replying.  
---
Lemme guess, you're playing on a PvE server.  
---
Wah, someone got called an idiot on the internet. Jesus christ go back to your Luthren Church or wherever the fuck you came from.
---
Just do what private servers have always done. New fresh.
---
it's a tried method and it works.
---
I'm a little late to the party, but I'm trying my luck before posting a new thread.
---
As a Rogue, if I go the standard PvE swords Combat spec (https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/005323105-3210052020050150231), which order do I want to pick up the talents in?  
---
I don't want to bother leveling using a different spec and then changing to the real spec when I hit 60.
---
Get a good mix and have some fun.  Off the top of my head I'd go with:  
---
* Warrior Tank
---
* DPS - Mage, Rogue, Pally DPS who can be a back up tank or healer as needed.
---
* Priest Heals
---

Very nice, anywhere to download the file to print myself?
---
for other people, i'm dumb-- Does this mean in Phase 1 Cenarion Hold is going to be mostly empty?
---
For you, the 27th.
---
I plan to ruin every single AV I'm in for people like you. who allowed Blizzard to get away with using 1.12 AV.  I will flask, use invuln pots whatever. I will bind rank 1 blizzard to my s key and proc novas on your entire team in concert with other mages. When on my rogue I will ninja everything back. Nothing will bring me greater joy than to ruin your honor per hour in a BG you wanted destroyed, just so .00000000000000001 percent of the population and streamers don't have their precious honor per hour ruined.
---
When you finally get in our base I will wipe you by attacking every pet I can find and luring it to Drek'thar, since so many pet players don't know how to control their pet. When you wipe I will do hipthrusts. When you leave the BG I will consider it a victory.
---
Sounds like a lot of advice from people that never played on pve servers. There will be plenty of players on both types.
---
My mains were always on PvE servers when I started in 2005. I never had issues doing the content I wanted to as Horde. There was still open world pvp in places and there were even pug raids eventually.
---
It really just comes down to your personal preference.

It's replaced by a more powerful weapon that also drops from ragnaros, BRE.

Yes he did, but this is a “World of Warcraft: Classic” subreddit so I made my post a themed one by referencing a spell in the game. You see what I did there?

What if all the servers are already full (or damn close)?
---
Unpopular opinion, but I don’t mind. Something about the queue tells me that i’m about to join a well populated server with tons of people. That’s what i’m looking forward to
---
I firmly believe that these servers can support a healthy BG population. I played on a large vanilla server and it had relatively fast BG queues. I think these servers are going to be even larger than my old server, meaning fast queues.
---
I feel that the positives of having everyone in the BG being from the same server outweigh the negatives of a longer queue. NOW, should the queues reach longer than 30 min or so, then have Blizzard implement cross-realm BGs.
---
There is no way a zerg rush AV will slip by on my watch!
---
&gt;those people join layers permanently
---
Absolutely not how it's going to go, as we've seen time and time again on the stress tests/beta. Sure, they've changed it, but it's revealed that the architecture they're using to do layering is pretty much exactly what sharding is. It *never* should have been swapping people's layers switching zones, if the "whole world layers" that they advertised existed and worked like they had claimed. People almost assuredly will not *actually* be strictly bound to one server until it merges or a new one is created.
---
The argument here I think is about whether you believe what they're saying about layers, and what you think they'll do with them. I think the previous issues people have documented are enough to take a cautious cynical approach to what Blizz says about layering, and I fear that they're going to use it to control visible populations on a zone by zone basis. You think they'll do it exactly as they say, and it'll only really affect the starter zones.
---
We'll see who is correct when the game launches, I hope you are right but I'm not as optimistic.
---
Pugs just need it, whatever man.
---
Eh, it was so boring in my opinion. The quests were boring, boring zones, the only good raid was Kara, flying mounts lol, LFG, everything happening in Outland, Shatt,

Hell yea, OP.

Ah shit I literally did this as a 70 gnome rogue when I was like 11.

If you watch Method they approach it like a job with actual hours, analytics, and reasonable downtime. The thing is that may not transfer over to this competition. All the strats are known, the encounters are patched and in their final forms from go.

It simply isn't the same. There's also not really a gear check in MC you can't just brute force with pots and buffs.

Thanks, but I don't really know if we had much of a hand in this success. I think the subreddit would have grown either way, as Classic is obviously a super-hyped game (and rightfully so). All we did is try to figure out a balance for memes / shit-posts versus real content (something we still try to figure out on a daily basis).

---
Pro-tip: Since you tamed a beast that's hostile, when someone is getting close, start running towards them to simulate that they "aggro'd" it. Increases the odds that they'll attack it before realizing it's a hunter pet!
---
Fun video otherwise, eye of the beast is such a perfect hunter tool, and it's always fun to see it used to mess with people!

-Solid crew that have been gaming together for YEARS.  Most of us are past 25, if that matters.  Some young pups have joined the ranks and we are attempting to break their spirits before they hit 30.
---
-Good communication.
---
-A SICK spreadsheet that I spent way too much time on.
---
-The lady of the guild constantly topping the charts and reminding us testosterone is weak.
---
-Planning on a DKP system with decay to keep everyone in line and getting geared at a reasonably good pace.
---
-Competent, good communicators looking to progress far and fast whilst having the best time possible.

sort of related, will there be a new rppvp server on EST perhaps?
---
Can you quote where you said it was?
---
I'm confused.
---
You're saying Reddit is the 'shitpost capital of the internet', and that 'gamer subs' are 'meme central stations'. Perhaps the ones **you** visit are. /r/classicwow bans low effort memes, and the rest of the ones I visit other than /r/crusaderkings2 ban them entirely.

Wrong, not a restart, a recreation
---
1 tank
---
1healer
---
3 dps

that should do it
---
Get to 10. Get Teleport: Moonglade. Get Bear Form. Run to Stormwind and set hearth point.
---
There's a Druid trainer in the Park. Maybe save your level 14 and 16 quests to do them together.

It's just time consuming. Not hard to get there aside from being eaten by raptors and Crocs

Are there any plans to add new content to the game?

Don't pvp, way faster to just win trade....  : /
---
Can't play any class other than a warlock.. so lol
---
Yeee please please?
---
They will. This is one of the most famous games of all time and they see now the importance of preserving it’s history. 
---
I don’t think they would make the same mistake twice, and let bootleg private servers carry the mantle again of Classic WoW (because you know people will still eventually just want to play Blizz refined Vanilla but for free) should Blizzard Classic devolve into “Classic WoW+” or “Classic TBC”
---
I’m not saying those wouldn’t also be great from Blizz and of course the community wants it, but I think everyone also knows just how important it is that the REAL Classic WoW experience is preserved for anyone to experience years from now.
---
I am all for "free character transfer" to alleviate issues with big populations and long queue times (on a limited basis.) I am completely against the idea of "paid character server transfers" as a service. I am fine with it for Retail WoW (that I don't play) but the ability to character transfer (and thus name change) is antithetical to the "reputation matters" world of a community driven MMO like Vanilla WoW.
---
I would humbly ask that, despite the dollars gained with such a service, to deny it for Classic WoW. If you can freely act like an asshole and/or ninja loot a guild's raid or many dungeons only to paid server transfer when people get wise to your scheme this is damaging to the idea that your personal reputation matters on a realm.
---
i may actually try things out without addons, read quest text etc...
---
Sunder is bread and butter. If you took it off your bars, you'd be a fail tank. Your argument is fail tank. Your edit is a meaningless attempt to ride the credibility of the link I posted for others.
---
I don't care whether you learn or not. Just take your excuses outside my inbox.
---
That’s because it’s from the [music video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ouyC28ffPjQ)! This post was good enough on its own but that was such a throwback to the early 2010s it just made it great for me
---
What I would legit like, is because of how leveling scales the content and "forces" old content to never be played again. I'd love it if we could just "Earn" skills through quests - like vanilla did and just keep everyone at level 60, or at most 65.
---
With a really nice ilvl crunch, gaining power can be through smaller gear upgrades, not levels (therefore forcing reduced damage, levels increases dodges and resists, etc.) C'thun could still be a good fight at 65, if ilvls weren't blown out of scale.
---
Man I thought Westfall and the Defias questlines were great? Is that just nostalgia talking?!
---
Well happy trails and good discussion. Have fun in Classic!
---
Just say it before, HoJ goes to melee. No one has ever had a tough time filling a hunter's spot in a BRD run anyway
---
TBC doesn't NEED flying.  They can just take that out completely.  And they should.  Along with the 70 level cap.   Maybe have paragon?
---
How did you get this data?
---
There isn’t really a discussion.  This game is 15 years old. This conversation has been had 5000 times already. 
---
Objectively speaking night elf is probably one of the worst races in the game for most classes.
---
Kara was cool but the zones in Outland and content was just soooooo cookie cutter.
---
NA EST Stalagg Horde  
---
I'm planning on leveling a hunter with hopes of doing some raiding and pvp fun in the future. I'm pretty busy irl, and I'm looking for a guild who trusts and respects their members, who has fun, and who is ok with members who only have a couple hours daily to make progress. I don't want to miss out on raiding and world pvp this time around, and I want a guild who is interested in both without expectations to be ultra-hardcore, min-maxing.   
---
I fell in love with this game as a teenager, and I want to get back to adventuring and enjoying time with people who are cool.
---
Lmfaoo
---
why would we have to accept the private server world first? they are not equal to classic at all, as has been confirmed by all the differences between both
---
That doesn't follow. Classic was great because you **didn't need to inspect someone** to know what they were wearing. Now, you actually do have to inspect them to see.
---
(yeah I screwed up including arenas) 
---
That's good advice about Respec gold. Would you say resto shammy is viable and fun in pvp? I am def not opposed to healing, I mained a priest the last couple of expansions. I just liked the look of dps shammy. Haha 
---
The things you mentioned are def a big draw to the warlock.
---
There's a skip to avoid the Wetlands run, you can just hop over the mountains North of the leper gnomes quest

---
I think it’s a great idea too. Glad I don’t have to fight with thousands of others for the 3 rattlebones spawn.
---
Agreed. I wouldn’t mind just scrapping flying but getting TBC. also agree on the paragon thing.
---
If Classic becomes significantly more popular than Retail, will that have any important effects on ActivisionBlizzard's approach to running World of Warcraft?
---
https://youtu.be/-2xuO8JBepM
---
There you go!
---
That druid mana regin is nice. I wonder if I can convince my guild...
---
1. That's not even an actual game that has ever existed.  
---
2. LOTS of people played and liked Blood Elves.  
---
3. Unilaterally making this dramatic of an opinion-based change would never go over well with anything close to a significant portion of players, much less anything nearing a majority. You can't just say "don't add this race because they're bullshit" that's absurd.  
---
4. Goblins are bullshit.
---
Shamans actually don't need that many and it uses the new macro language that is super easy. 
---
You want a /stopcasting on earthschock for interupts. This just cancels a heal/attack you are using to instantly eshock. Put /startattack on pretty much every attack and a stopattack on something like the engineering grenade since it is your only real CC. 
---
Other than that you can use clique for healing and any other healing macros you have you can do a /tar mouseover.
---
So a typical macro will look like this. The showtooltip just makes it so the macro uses the spell icon. You can shift click the spells out of the spellbook to put them in the macro.
---
\#showtooltip
---
/stopcasting
---
/cast Earth Shock (Rank1)
---
Clique let's you use things already used when you are over a party unit frame. So you can bind like mouse scroll up, down left click, right click to cleanses or lesser rank heals, chain heal whatever you want. I tested it in the demo and it worked fine.
---
 [https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info25107-CliqueClassic.html](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info25107-CliqueClassic.html) 
---
As others said you can also do a Nswiftness macro. With Clique I don't bother though as I always played elemental and you can use it offensiveness or defensively. You could also make a macro to use it with ghostwold.
---
You'd think people will have common sense.  But we had to slap silly some druids in our guild that wanted Drake Fang Talisman just to "try out feral"
---
The fact that they're throwing these items on BiS lists means people are going to use this to justify rolling on them over melee classes.
---
[Captain P, you'll never know the emptiness inside as we sit ashore on Menethil, waitin' for a ride.](https://youtu.be/-2xuO8JBepM)

same monitor! i got it for 700 on prime day
---
What would you put those two talent points in?  
---
You don’t NEED master of deception at all honestly.
---
I hope the liberties Blizzard takes are not towards 5 hour queues
---
I hate getting rid of awesome gear in one level. New awesome gear is fine but it shouldn't make the old gear worthless.
---
Dude that would be crazy. You can’t just redesign Outlands with no flighting mounts
---
Runescape does something similar, but has a somewhat low threshold. Your account must have a total level of 300 and 25 hours played. The community has suggested raising the total level, but there has not been a big movement.
---
If Blizzard restricted voting to accounts that have at least one level 60 character I could see that working.
---
Sexy
---
Layering and dynamic spawns has it handled. Things went pretty well in the last stress test. They even explained during the AMA today why sharding won't work in classic (stuff like Rexxar's long-ass patrol route).
---
It won't be as bad in the classic patch due to some Druid changes, but I was specced fully for healing here, so yeah it was slow. I decided to grind out the last bit of 59 because questing in Plaguelands was a pain in the rear.
---
I’ve been around, but I’ve never heard this reasoning before. 
---
I figure the highest agility + strength total as well as 2 additional points at least warrants some thought. 
---
I was sure night elf’s were the worst too, but now I’m not so sure, so I’m just trying to gauge community opinions
---
AS a tank I would always run around with that badboy equiped. (Except for tanking ofc)
---
It's an MMO. Part of the game is having to socialize with people and compete for resources. People don't want the same systems that are present in the current game that enables people to ignore the social aspects of MMOs. Yes, it's going to be a pain in the ass sometimes to farm stuff, find groups, and quest efficiently, but people are willing to sacrifice that ease of use for the social aspect that got them hooked on the WoW experience in the first place. 
---
If this turns into the current retail WoW with less content, classic won't last.
---
Start with less, add more if needed just like salting food to cook. You can't un-season a steak but you can always add to it. If things get crazy they will open up free transfers, or merge servers together.
---
Fury warriors never look skilled aesthetically. ;_;
---
The hardest part isn't the drop rate.
---
It's the very first step
---
I have no doubt it's going to be someone who suffers from insomnia and living on disability that's going to no life it to 60.
---
I'd rather see how well people are going to get to 60 in /played.  That's showing more of an efficiency rather than the will to play without getting any sleep.
---
The internet has never been treated as a public utility by the federal government, or in most of the US.
---
Sorry let me reiterate it was too long for the video that was being displayed it was kind of boring. Your comment on a wallpaper and song is also irrelevant that's a completely fine to have.
---
Good
---
I recommend trying "you're a wonderful human being and I'm happy to play with you".
---
&gt; No one cares for TBC servers except for the loud minority.
---
Like for Classic WoW?
---
Night Elf Mohawk of course!
---
So shadow melt faces.
---
Luck has it that I'm not making the game, so don't need to worry about if I would make it like that.  I certainly wont be restraining myself from world pvp(the thing I am looking forward to the most) in any of the phases.  I just accept that if towns/flightpaths/quest givers are over run 100% of the time it could have a negative affect on population and I would rather have more world pvp later than a ton of ganking in 2 and empty world later.
---
The guild?
---
Thanks Saturn, we owe you big time!
---
it aint bad but it's no escape artist or stone fomr.
---
Every single poll I've seen has them the second most populated class on horde. Every single one. Some of the latest ones even have them pretty even with warriors.
---
Its too soon, but after phase 5. Yes I think this is a great system.
---
I REMEMBER THAT LOL
---
swim the coast from menethil to when the map changes to stormwind, drown yourself, boom, one death, pop in goldshire graveyard, go about your business, it's time consuming but who cares.
---
Be as shitty as you want the factions are at war ffs.
---
its all just one big joke anyway.
---
Lol I thought so. Really though the people I'm playing with don't want to switch so Im stuck
---
And yet here we are in a meme thread, shit posting about nonsense nobody cares about.
---
&gt;what you're thinking of is usually called a bulletin board forum
---
&gt;Perhaps the ones you visit.
---
&gt; You're saying... that if you want anything that doesn't conform to this strange standard of yours should leave reddit.
---
You really should try making fewer assumptions about people.
---
You don’t need it unless you’re fighting other rogues, and if classic servers before we’re any indication, there’s gonna be lots of rogues.
---
I’m not sure which would be best. Maybe improved gouge, or heightened sense to try and match human perception while also getting higher dodge chance
---
Spinal Reaper, thats all I wanted for my warrior back in classic.
---
The non-consume version is revered, consume version is honored.
---
Kehk deh
---
Where I put my macros ...
---
I don't think the majority of players will come close to completing all the endgame content.
---
For me it was always full Tier 1 Shaman set. Still my favorite looking set in the game.
---
a momentous occasion, grats
---
Gotta love the Swanson's
---
I def see a mix of both being talked about, but I was more trying to say that the classic+ ideas usually get more upvotes and discussions, but more of a slightly tipped scale that way than a huge landslide for it.
---
Those are all ideas I agree with for the most part. I agree that there would be no way to make a classic+ and please everybody. I'm definitely for remaking the maps for later content and including it at level 60, but don't think that will save much time wise apart from being able to reuse assets. Whichever choice they do, I'm hoping they keep a couple seasonal/permanently classic servers to please the #NOCHANGES crowd.
---
Lol I cannot imagine how bored you are.
---
thanks alot!! I actually used both of them but it seems like i had the wrong version. 
---
Finally im getting my old UI going again =)
---
YESSS I NEED ARENA!
---
There's something that I really like about the old human models that makes me wish they had kept them and polished them up a bit, maybe it's just that they look a bit more heroic.
---
drama leftover from private servers? how is there already drama lmao
---
New server with the option to transfer or better yet, copy, a character from classic.
---
Did you even try to look?
---
I'm going Tauren to be a B I G B O Y E
---
I'd love if they released a re-worked version of TBC and WotLK as lvl 60 parallel progressions.
---
Lucky you. Gogogo sell sell sell!
---
Oh I get it. I have said the same thing to other people too. Its just funny that the impulse is so strong.
---
MC will be almost pointless gearwise for Rogues. The BiS gear is better than the Rogues Tier 1 set.
---
The only item worth getting is the [Brutality Blade](https://classicdb.ch/?item=18832) but will be almost impossible to get for most Rogues.
---
Realistically a guild will see 1 Brutality Blade drop a month in MC; and having 15-20 raid members bidding on it.
---
MC raids will be composed of: 5-10 Warriors, 5-8 rogues, 2-4 Hunters in the raid
---
That's 15-20 people you have to compete with once a month for the Brutality Blade. If you think your going to get 2 of them before BLW comes out your fucking delusional, or you have to be on a Loot Council that wont freak out on the person getting 2 of them; ultimately causing the guild to collapse because of your greediness.
---
 And once BWL launches, the [Brutality Blade](https://classicdb.ch/?item=18832) will become obsolete with the [Chromatically Tempered Sword](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19352) being much better. Hence why raiding MC will only be useful to farm DKP for rogues.
---
Shhhhhh
---
Thanks that's really helpful, the #showtooltip had me stumped actually so explaining what that is has helped.
---
Earth shock macro sounds like it would be extremely useful
---
#NoChanges
---
Yeah? And the devs explained on the stresstests &amp; Betas why the cities were empty (also i think u replied to wrong person)
---
Only if you're going by pserver (pre-TBC patch 2.0.1) values. Which are 200-250% higher than Classic's rep gains.
---
You will _not_ even be able to reach Exalted with your own faction much less any others just by questing.
---
Reddit be like Ajit Pai bad Google good
---
It is, when they won’t accept you if you’re 1-2 items short on the pre-raid-bis gear, which these people do. And it’s totally unnecessary, classic raids didn’t need this kind of min-maxing back then, and I don’t think they will now, but sure, killing the boss 10 seconds faster because of that dps increase is totally worth killing the community and turning it into the toxic elitist mess that these servers are. But one can hope official will be different, we’ll see.
---
I plan on ranking up. I will communicate with others doing the same thing. If we agree to take turns, great. If not, then whatever, I'll continue play as much as I want anyway. I'm not going to bow down to anyone, at the expense of my own fun.
---
Spec doesn’t matter u just collect a spell damage set from leveling + AH gear
---
Say goodbye to your wife
---
I'm not saying that classic will have more players than retail, but I would argue that it can be a better game, and for me as a player, that's what's important.
---
Retail is dogged down by too many psychological, focus group style triggers.  Because of that it will always keep people playing.  FOMO and gambling addiction are real things that retail uses (among other huge games) to keep players hooked.  Retail isn't a great game and it's a terrible rpg.
---
Classic, to many people, is hands down the better game.  And it's not all nostalgia.  If you could separate people from their investment into their retail accounts, I'd bet many of them would prefer classic.
---
I know that but doesn't spec swapping become very expensive and not very available after a while so I can't swap to shadow every night after a raid if I wanted to PvP, right?
---
Huge reply!
---
No even remotely connected to WoW, but a couple of days ago a speedrunner did Final Fantasy 1 to 15 in one session. It took him over 92 hours. He ofcourse had 3-4 breaks during this, but none longer than 1-2 hours.
---
It's possible if you're insane and insanely dedicated to something.

You can do 1.12 MC with 20 people. It's nerfed to the ground. 8 debuffs and tons of bleeds also didn't work out to well there champ. Here have a history lesson from Preach gaming. Threat also changed due to the one handed rebalancing btw champ. 
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74fmTBRTnDg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74fmTBRTnDg) 
---
Mages were often forced to just stand there as shown. This made healing extremely hard as the itemization sucked compared to 1.12. Boss encounters were simply longer, DPS was lower.
---

Enjoy losing to horde rogues in pvp I guess.
---
Can't wait to wear ugly santa gloves as a fire mage . . .
---
Go back in time and do any one of the open stress tests.
---
Oh, then use /insult
---
on PVP server you will have to accept regular time loss. Maybe some evenings you get nothing done and had a frustrating experience. This is fine if it is not going to get your blood boiling and you are ok with just trying another day. You do not have to rush your accomplishments in the game.
---
PVE server I do not think will "die" more than a PVP one would. Doing whatever farming and getting into dungeons/raids might take less time but I dont think it is a problem that some people might be logged in 30mins less a day than if they were delayed 30mins more trying to do the same. Theres still BGs and PVP with willing enemies on PVE.
---
PVP server is just most zones being unsafe and those who can kill you one sided with clear advantage can do it.
---
Hi! From Whittier neighborhood.
---
6 piece shadowcraft can be good if you play right.
---
&gt; We’ll get to it later.   
---
The greatest lie ever told!
---
Well the reason you're struggling to see it as an equal is because they aren't.
---
Tauren arent bad for the record, the extra range isnt far. People seem to misunderstand that the difference between tauren melee leeway and orc, is minimal.
---
Warstomp has its uses too, but it also resets the swing timer so its double edged at times.
---
Its worth noting that Tauren are big. That might seem like it doesnt matter, but it does. Nameplates have a reduced range in vanilla. If you're easier to spot, you're easier to target. If more people target you, you arent going to have a very fun time without pocket healers. Which you almost certainly won't have because unlike the Alliance exclusive class, almost every Shaman and their mother doesnt heal in PvP.
---
Bottom line here is because of all this, hardiness is king. It can and will make you win where a Tauren could have never won. Orcs are also smaller, and bloodfury is situationally ok if you time it right on a 1v1.
---
Thanks I hate it!
---
Absolutely roll PVP.
---
Without world PVP, you are missing  out on such a huge part of the game. Everything feels more engaging when there's something at stake. Even when you're on the wrong end of it, world pvp can be fun because you see a threat and you get that adrenaline rush and try to get away or avoid them.
---
It also forces you to become better at the game.
---
Tauren is good too, it just changes what classes your racials benefit you most again. Keep in mind stun resistance is primarily only going to be giving a lot of benefit against rogues. I'm pretty sure the way holy spells work, it doesn't factor in against Hammer of Justice, so that just leaves the sparse procs like Blackout.
---
The range thing and an additional way to stop someone's cast is pretty darn good.
---
Good man! Thank you, just adding it, goal is 666 songs
---
Why would disclosing how much money they earn be a violation of SEC rules?
---
You're setting yourself up for disappointment.
---
Cool, then replay it again and again at a 60-locked server with the 10 other people that wish to do that.
---
Shamans have chain heal, so at least you can AOE heal while buffing the raid.
---
Right, but if I go priest and move to the human zone and do everything like the humans, I should have the sad level of reputation for the human mount no ?
---
I meant down ranked spells.
---
Nah, none of it is that bad! Unless your party rogues are asking you to totem twist, they can go fuck themselves though. 
---
It’s a fun class to heal with because every single heal that comes out is situational and you have to decide which one is best (how fast does it need to be, how big does it need to be, how many people do I need to hit). As opposed to paladins who literally just spam flash.
---
They said it will be taken down before phase 2
---
How is that a nightmare lmao. Thanks to them finally ending net neutrality in my area I was able to get better internet. Internet was limited here

*In loot drops?*
---
so can someone explain to me the idea behind leveling fishing and cooking because i have played every expansion and i don't think i have even picked up fishing or cooking once
---
i shoot myself in the face if my raid takes longer than 3h for mc + ony
---
that's probably 6 month till bwl comes out, 1 day is fine for now
---
Exactly. The only servers that won't have wait times are the ones they create the day of the launch. And even some of those will end up having wait times
---
This is a fantastic idea, I hope the devs see this.
---
You’ll have to wait till launch.
---
&gt;and the game hasn't even launched yet
---
.. that's **why** there's so many people here
---
I guess you are HAhahah
---
WOTF for warriors is good for group pvp.
---
Not the kind of detail I can remember from that far back. I always went AFK to get stuff done while in queue and came back when I heard the music change...
---
I get the flight trivializes World PvP. Kinda sucks, not really a problem for me, I am not much of a PvP guy. But, I appreciate that maaaaany people enjoy it and feel that it's integral to their enjoyment of the game. 
---
I think limiting flight so it's still a feature but doesn't allow you to skip that aspect it a good first step.
---
Blizzard never instant applied the slow back in the day.  Mobs would run halfway through it then catch the slow, or right away.  It was basically each tick of damage would apply it but they could make it half way through a blizzard with the right timing and speed.  I didn't play after wrath so I don't know how it changed after but I saw what I'm guessing was a pserver mage aoe grinding and that was the first thing I noticed that his blizzard slowed instantly.  It's been 10 years but I knew that was wrong.
---
Grenades, reflectors, nets, and sapper charges are all huge for pvp.
---
Jesus dude, you ok?
---
I didn't use it often, but on really DPS intensive fights sometimes opening with a BF &gt;&gt; Shieldslam can really help get the threat to stick and usually healing isn't an issue early in a fight.  It just depends really, but I agree it's not something you should use often, highly situational. I'm sure someone will push up their glasses to disagree with my assessment of it's usefulness but the orc tanks I knew back in Vanilla seemed to do that often so who knows.
---
Not sure I fully get what you're saying, but I'll chime in here and say that today's Q&amp;A had a response that for a server like Herod, the queues will be "several hours" and that "lengthy queues" are expected on these servers through the first week of the game.
---
&gt; Nope, the layers are server wide. That would be sharding. Each layer is like it's own server, and can be merged as the population decreases.
---
I know, but they do that server wide so people don't get layered too much. Layer info from a dev: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ct08c7/welcome_to_the_rclassicwow_subreddit_ama_with_the/exi8loz/
---
&gt; Nowhere have they indicated that they would increase the population caps from their vanilla numbers.
---
That's wrong. See https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/overcrowded-realm-update/70777 "a Medium realm today already has more characters on it than even the most crowded realms did back in 2006."
---
18th Question is extremely important for those that are uneasy about Layering and had questions.
---
not really, we are in peak hype phase
---
Why are you talking about mounts, trinkets, and set bonuses while complaining about transmog...?
---
Blomo* even cooler
---
I had the same thought.  Unleash the Path of Exiles streamers.  They would own this.
---
Based on his comments in this thread... it appears both?
---
Eli5
---
Transmog is a travesty. Other MMOs do similar things. I never liked it. Even in later versions of WoW without Transmogging, the characters got very similar looking at different stages. 
---
I liked the fact that some items were exceedingly rare. Other MMOs should follow suit. People literally knowing your in game name because you had Thunderfury is awesome, it adds to the immersion.
---
I have yet to get a world drop... maybe all my luck's been building up for classic!
---
&gt; I figure the highest agility + strength total as well as 2 additional points at least warrants some thought.
---
Are you willing to trade this for escape artist though?
---
Just get a Hunter or a Mage as an alt to farm whatever you need.
---
Ummm... you cannot summon someone from outside into an instance iirc?
---
No, ofc not. Only if you are really confident in your abilities. This can easily backfire if you are not at the top of your game. 
---
I've been playing this game since 2005, on vanilla private servers since 2012.
---
I'll be quite frank, ya'll. I wrote this thinking you might get some value or at least a different perspective from the standard streamer min maxing one. I was ready to go to bed, but I might not go yet. I thought about writting p2 with in depth discussion of classes, no sure now.
---
Look at grail on willitclassic
---
Bull crap. Gold was the most valuable asset in classic.
---
Everyone would love to have new content while remaining "vanilla-esque" but that is not what this is. If they want to release classic+ servers with added content then fine. But you dont promise millions of people a "real classic experience" only to then have new additional content added that was never in vanilla. Thats a lot of people who sunk time and money into something they were promised only to have it taken from them. That's just *not* classic. 
---
Believe me, I would love to see brand new fresh content in the state of vanilla, but it has no place being *here*. If they decide to run classic+ servers with a bunch of changes then that's fine.
---
Dubstep? Is it 2009?
---
Good to hear, but I'm still not sure where to roll. Probably Gehennas or a new server after the Firemaw if there's one before the launch.
---
Ok thought so, thought I'd throw the question out there in case there was some way to do it.
---
r/wow isnt going to pass this sub anytime soon unless a miracle happens.  r/wow is only losing activity and at a quick pace.  We all know retail is pretty much dead at this point and so is r/wow.
---
I fucking lost it
---
Do the in game events later in Vanilla not spur on WPVP? Like needing to collect mats to open the AQ gates, and the Scourge Invasion? I'm a wrath baby who is excited for the WPVP and these are things ive read from people saying wpvp is what makes vanilla/classic.
---
only 1 monitor?  yikes
---
&gt;old leg is bad but is also proven to work **right now**
---
And you yell at your manager: "end of life!" support for this version ended in 2017!!! But they do not care.
---
I mean barely. R1 frostbolt to get a quick slow or r1 arcane explosion to get rogues out of stealth. Neither of which pertain to the original parent comment of atiesh MP5 and its effect on dps.
---
That's a great story! I hope I get similar online friends like that :D
---
That sounds great!
---
Well first you pet the lil guy then give him a treat
---
Data caps on specific services are real....
---
I'll take your claim of scammy behavior on face value.  And let's say Cox wants to do the same level of scammy behavior, except with their football channel package.  But they haven't been able to.  Why not?
---
This basically. 
---
I'm perfectly fine with layering for the first few months even tbh. I don't need to be so immersed into a game that layering will ruin it for me. That's kinda silly. But, after a few months I'd like to get back to the niche classic community that vanilla had on each server.
---
Where are the mods at when there is blatant forum manipulation going on here from Method? Just look at those 100 upvotes magically appearing out of nowhere.
---
no.  They fucked it up and your account can only be logged into one service at a time.  If you buy a completely second subscription for classic, and a completely separate $15 sub for retail, you could do that, because at that point you are paying for two different accounts.  
---
As it is right now they don't let you log in and you are removed from the existing logged in account with an error, "Your account has been logged in else where, contact support if you do not know who logged in on your account or think this has been an error."
---
Literally saw it while browsing amazon, thought "why the heck not" and 1-click purchased it so just a normal SSD. Never had one before as I dont really mind the few second loading time I have in games on a HDD, but might get converted after trying this one out :P
---
I will likely be doing more healing than hitting by the level I get into the resto tree so not personally super worried about hit
---
Mage confirmed BIS for Orgrimmar class training speed-run?
---
Hey! No timey wimey stuff in classic, thank you very much.
---
I played really early in classic so I can't really speak to 1.12. 
---
But I was mining engineering priest in vanilla. I had enough gold to Respec 2-5 times a week depending on what I wanted to do.
---
I also always bought the most expense consumables I could find on the ah right before a raid.
---
Sounds great? Well I did all 180 days /played at 60% mount speed as I was never able to afford my epic riding. I even had the option to buy cheap training first but the time I had the gold I decided to save for the more expensive part first... Well then they switched it before I got there. So I spent a lot of time with an epic mount in my bank lol.
---
Anyway if you are better with professions, are stingy with resoecs, you can afford the stuff but you will have to research and work for it imo. You just don't have the farming potential especially in raid healing spec.
---
they arent equal, but they can do things orcs cant, the aoe stun is cool, the range is nice but you also can be frost novad from further away also, pick your poison.
---
youare the perfect example of someone who talks alot but has no clue what he is talking about. you can do 1.1 mc with 20 ppl. the only reason mc was "hard" is because ppl had no clue what they are doing. mc was not nerfed to the ground. the only change they did was to ragnaros and it wasnt much of a nerf. threat was only an issue because tanks didnt know how to itemize for tps  and what rotations to use.
---
there you have your history lessen kid. now sit down
---
They have been very clear about keeping it as close to retail as possible.
---
i love you, fuck them i want my 24h av back
---
Wasn't personal. It's just that I've been active since vanilla release and I've seen the hardcore aspect of the game degrading ever since.
---
Why do I like to oneshot lower level players? I don't know.
---
Why do Americans like guns? Why are wars always present on earth?
---
Probably because we have been killed before by a higher level player, and we feel the need for 'payback'. Besides it's only a game.
---
And like some other guy stated: this will draw out their friend so we can have a real hour-lasting battle.
---
Ps. I WILL kill you. But if you're defenseless I will stop after 2-3 times. I guess it has something to do with pride. The whole "For the Horde!!__!111" and what not.
---
Besides, it's a game. In real life I'm a real friendly crowdpleaser ;)
---
Ghost is another one, you could put gwar, toxic holocaust, aglloch, the summoning, drudka
---
&gt; The only way I can see them fixing this is by changing the resource count.
---
An easier solution would be to have it timed. 
---
So make it set so that the event or "change" doesn't happen until X amount of days. 
---
So if one server gets it done and finished within 3 hours of it becoming available, the server itself doesn't start the event until X number of days.
---
Couldn't agree more.
---
Winterspring Frostsaber - Eventually got it after months of grinding rep! I may even go for it again in Classic, since I can't commit to a raiding schedule anymore.
---
Most boring race ever. Jesus even mc is a snoozefest to watch.
---
&gt; no guild is gunna have 180,000 light leather sitting on multiple bank alts just for turn in day 1
---
You're severely underestimating this community my friend, a guild like Method for example have shown a willingness to go to extreme lengths to accomplish their goals.
---
I know a guy on retail who runs a second account just for his own personal hoarder style storage needs.
---
Ventrilo, Winamp and MSN Messenger... that's some true nostalgia right there.
---
+1, for now, Scotland is part of the UK. Who lives in the UK  and doesn't know this!
---
I noticed that a lot of people weren't happy with some of these and thought they were too overpowered. While I don't agree with all of them, I made an [updated version](https://i.imgur.com/BsDiwbx.jpg) of the racials.
---
I still don't think Arcane Shield is overpowered in comparison to some other stuff, but I completely changed since people seemed very upset with it.
---
Master's Call now summons a hawk that flies around you and that functions almost like a shield against stealthers. The duration is decreased as well.
---
Hired Muscle now only summons 1 ogre and its duration is now 8 seconds. I also specified that it moves very slowly and deals damage only after it reaches the target. Kaboom! is also specified to do a small amount of damage because it was always meant as more of a comedic ability to have (come on, finishing an opponent that is low off and taking them with you is funny). Gun Specialization removed because they did have one too many racials.
---
Nerfed the skills as well since some of them worked too well together.
---
Hopefully it's better now and I appreciate the feedback :p
---
Leave it to an Alliance member to have cable management like that
---
Just use this:

My bad xP
---
But utilizing that logic, hunters aren't able to roll on any of their non-mail bis gear.
---
Can we please keep everything esports related out of classic
---
Nothing like the feeling of lag in Shattrath.
---
I think this is a great idea, once most raid content has been picked dry. I would love to odo black temple when it is actually relevant, as I leveled up during BC and never got to experience the late game. Also Shattrath and outland in general are amazing! Love u guys.
---
I still don't see the try hard to be consumed and buffed out of your mind for doing something like Molten Core.  My guild was clearing up through AQ with maybe only using world buffs for first/second kills to get us over those edges.
---
These people better be healthy. Gaming like this leads to stroke, heart attack, dehydration and other issues.
---
\#nochanges
---
Their answer to this question was weird. I expected them to say it taxes the server, but instead they said its been altered due to people spelling out messages in corpses. Wtf?
---
And releasing it will likely kill classic itself. Classic + is the only way forward imo
---
That's the exact spot I hit 60 for the first time in Vanilla. Nice!
---
Is that enough time to name them all?
---
This is amazing. My guild discord got a kick out of this, thank you so much &lt;3
---
I sympathize with your concerns OP and have similar time constraints. I’ve played both types of servers and have at one point been a ruthless ganking farmbot. 
---
My perspective is it’s pretty uncommon for a ganker to bother with a single player for more than a few attempts before moving on or getting pushed off. This amounts to perhaps 5 minutes on your part in stv, for example. 
---
There are no rules though and some people can and do hold up quest hubs. If this happens to you it’s a great time to move elsewhere or level up that bank toon for a few minutes before logging back in. You don’t want to give that fker the satisfaction of you logging.
---
There are only a few places where this happens regularly and it’s pretty easy to see when this goes on.
---
Dude this is what classic was like, your in the wrong anyway, of course people who have to speak english once every blood moon with passing tourists might want to relax and not have to think anout grammar and have to explain simple concepts over and over again because somethings are hard to translate.
---
And when you do the transfer, create an alt with your name on the server you transferred from to keep it reserved for a while should you ever transfer back.
---
We don't need this in Classic.  This is not what Classic is about.
---
More thinking tanking warrior.  To prep for raids like MC
---
It's an old school mud/mmo term I think, like mob or proc.
---
I have them up to print at retail cost here if you're interested in picking one up: [https://rdbl.co/2Pg05SW](https://rdbl.co/2Pg05SW)
---
Awesome! I actually wrote one of these yesterday I plan to post. I’m gonna read it out loud for a video though. Hopefully it’s as good as yours!
---
Is sticking by #nochanges really worth your player base not getting to experience the AQ War Event?
---
Jeez. Lots of sponsorship money being thrown around. Must be a very lucrative time to be WoW streamers.
---
Nixe
---
Well Sogeking from one piece is blocked by profanity filter and I’m trying to figure out why for days now
---
Hey! Is this addon Ready to use when Classic comes out?
---
Why do people think this is the AMA thread??
---
What purpose does this post serve?
---
I think you guys are doing a great job, and I appreciate the hard work.
---
Every time I think of azshara I get fond,  but salty, memories.
---
Farming Felcloth on my warrior from satyrs. Only every time I charged something, this asshole same-faction druid would Moonfire my mob before killing off his own, effectively tagging it and making me kill it for him as it was faster to kill it than to run. This worked because Charge would obviously put me in combat with it, but since it does no damage it wouldnt tag it. So he would just moonfire shit as I charged it.
---
This pissed me off to no end.
---
And of course, anti-cheat.
---
Yeah, it's ironic how these people are so excited for classic yet are ruining their own experience by playing sleep deprived most of the time
---
mouthbreathers need skele horses too bro :(
---
What happened to Thottbot anyway?

This is now official:

---
Read any idea post on any mmo subreddit and you'll see 99% of player ideas are just utter unworkable gamebreaking shit.  Yeah devs have bad ideas too, but holy shit are player submitted ideas bad.
---
I'm already in a guild but if there's a q longer than 10 mins on launch, I'm just switching servers.
---
Can you add Skeram and Blaumeux to the Server Demographics Survey as an option? Thanks!
---
I've never heard Pai speak or read anything he's written, I can come up with my own opinions thanks.
---
Companies would package their internet how they liked before the FCC started claiming jurisdiction.  Email or what we would now call cloud storage could be included in internet service.  Not to mention AOL, the company that convinced so many people to even bother with internet.  Companies wouldn't have dared introducing such deals between 2015-2017.
---
So the companies got fed up with this and asked the court to find out why they were able to be bullied in this way.  The court basically demurred and told the FCC that it's okay to decide for themselves what's legal as long as they do it out loud.  
---
And then lo and behold, when an unelected regulatory department can change the law at will, a new administration can change it back.
---
No I am saying that Blizzard has the correct data and that WoWWiki and private servers are wrong.
---
i think with classic being a thing now, the "retail team" should be less inclined to take inspiration from classic now, seeing as the more hardcore oldschool fans  have their own game to play, while the more casual newer fans can enjoy their game. 
---
they no longer need to attempt to please both with an awkward middle ground
---
When I started in Wrath my main was a Paladin and was through Warlords when I stopped. I love them and I do wish I could go Horde Pally but I do also like Shamans so I am excited. I want to try totem twisting some time it’s just so mana intensive; I feel like that strat is really for the diehard raiding guilds and I’m not really planning on doing much progression these days. I’m excited to level in Vanilla and experience the game with a fresh outlook after so many years. Not having played horde much too, I’m excited to have those new experiences.
---
I leveled a rogue and didn’t realize until level 35 or so that I could go stealth without vanish. The icon stealth was above my action bars and I never noticed it haha. I would Vanish to pickpocket/Ambush
---
Probably spell like an insult in some weird south-african language.
---
I don’t think you know what you’re talking about, as only the four classes you listed as “priority” can even equip it. No clue what you mean by “then any other class”
---
Who is this we you speak of
---
All of Lordaeron's citizens are still happily living there, they're just zombies now
---
Surveys seem to suggest Mankrik for PvE horde. All the other PvE servers lean alliance. But this is just reddit survey data, it leaves a lot of people out who aren't on reddit and similar platforms to even see the survey in the first place.
---
It was brutal when I was doing our progression raiding, alt raids and then doing PvP grind in the evenings.  Most of the time PvP grinding until the 10am reset time.  I made sure to do my class schedule to either have MWF start at noon to give me the most evening time to push until 4/5am and still get enough sleep for classes the next day.
---
Today... haha, not so much with a 9-5 but I'm still going to bed 1-2am every day.
---
Knock it off
---
Yes. Warrior issues early on solo is that rage dumps are not as effective and down time between killing mins, even with spirit, is high. Plus if you aggro multiple jobs in accident (looking at you harpies) it's almost fir sure a trip from the graveyard. 
---
With two warriors you can alternate dumping rage on mobs. You can ping pong kiting and dps with hamstring and you can more effectively handle extra mob pulls. Once your both 40 you can start chain pulling groups of mobs. 
---
Is it more effective than shaman and warrior probably not. But certainly still good.
---
This is amazing and finally something very clearly written out. Thank you and your team for being amazing.
---
Its a fucking video game.
---
R E L A X
---
Still waiting for LFR queue to clear.  Can't play the game if I am waiting in a queue.
---
No, but I read a brief wiki. Hence my previous comment ;]
---
Myzrael, great people so far with who I have talked to through Discord.
---
Nah he was bubble hearthening. Always gotta have spell of target on.
---
I'll try and get to Fairbanks and Blaumeux eventually to round off the US PVP servers.
---
How are you not getting booted for being idle? I need your secrets!
---
This is why im going PVE server. Leveling in peace while watching people who toggle pvp fight to death, great fun
---
Compared to English eu servers, yeah. But keep in mind europe got french german and russian servers aswell.
---
I hope the game goes classic+  
---
Personally, I'd like to see the level cap stay at 60. But improve and release new content (finish the unfinished zones), tweak balancing, etc sometime after Phase 6 has released and been allowed to breathe. Make it an alternate timeline to retail wow.
---
wow dude...shill harder. the talk for the last 2 years has all been about how easy raiding it going to be due to the MANY nerfs and buffs.  You're just wrong.
---
Would shrug my shoulders and wait until then. I am an adult and not a child crying because he didn’t get the toy he wanted after all as well as a software developer that has been on very big projects so I know the reality of development and don’t live in the fantasy world that thinks writing complex software is magic.
---
Hmm Troll maybe?
---
Blizzard never guaranteed anyone a name.  They opened servers based on internal projections and then, based on actual numbers, opened more servers to meet high demand—twice.  Now, the choice is yours: do you want the name you reserved on Herod or do you actually want to play the game?  
---
Blizzard clearly warned everyone a full 10-days ahead of launch about what to expect if you stay.  You are informed and what you choose to do with that information is on you.  But, it seems pretty childish to throw a tantrum and stubbornly refuse to take action in your own best interest unless some kind of special accommodation is made for you.  A name isn’t a very compelling reason to ruin your classic experience and waste 2+ weeks on principle when you could simply move to another available server.  Especially considering you haven’t so much as stepped foot in the server yet.
---
Take mining instead of tailoring would be what I’d do
---
I bet they get it.
---
Skinning is generally nice for leveling because its easy to level and make some gold for your mount by vendoring the leather. Im not sure about Tailoring though. Its not as easy to farm cloth on a fresh server. If you are sure that you want to reroll your professions for mining and engineering, id rather take mining and skinning and later swap skinning for engineering. You can send your ores that you collect to a bank char for later.
---
Low effort, blacklist yourself.
---
I think it would be really cool if they could include this, exactly how it was done in Vanilla. Gimme the lag, baby.
---
Can you further explain this? I don’t understand what you mean. As long as a new guild raids at 10:00, 10:30, 11:00, and 11:30 and each one pops an Ony head before they go out for the buff. Shouldn’t the area there in the city give the buff to everyone at each time interval? 
---
You can’t cap the amount of ony buffs in a server or else that’s blizz saying hey you better raid early or else some other guild will have gotten their ony buff and no one else can raid with the buff for another 2 hours
---
Runeblade of Baron Rivendare. Looks cool as hell.
---
My first ever AV started at around 22:00, I had uni the next day so I went to bed around 4 or 5 and when I came home after 15:00 I rejoined the same game. 
---
"Shortly" after that we won.
---
They have an always-on self-buff that boosts the threat gained from holy damage. The real issue is its very hard for them to reach uncrushable and they run out of mana.
---
2004 i believe
---
I was gonna roll UD mage, loved their animations + wotf. Friend is rolling a ally warrior, told him that i would gank him with R1 frostbolt as often as possible. Ended up getting bribed with food so now im rolling a pink haired fucking gnome mage
---
Rip the dream
---
Some of the raiders in Method are literal body builders. Now, you can obviously take things at that size that are absolutely terrible for your body/health but a lot of those guys are in phenomenal shape. 
---
Obviously, some of the people included in this event they’re hosting are very very out of shape.
---
Well I’ll be a warrior on Fairbanks so hit me up if you’re there!
---
I posted a pic of a syringe with wow logo on it, and had a spoon, it was removed for rule 7, and then a week later same pic is posted and didnt get removed. Mods suck big pp.

This is  beautiful! :o I think I leveled in Azshara, one time. It was quite the adventure, and I loved the Naga aspect of it. Paint more zones like this?? Please?? :D

This is not how net neutrality works at all. Net neutrality is the idea that ISPs should treat all data that travels over their networks fairly, without improper discrimination in favor of particular apps, sites or services. Your service availability where you live doesn't have anything to do with net neutrality.
---
Skeram released not 24 hours ago and just ticked over to medium.  This shit is gonna continue accelerating until launch.
---
I'm off and on at work. Send an email. Check classic news. Open a spreadsheet. Check the subreddit. Chit chat on office chat with another WoW player. Check to see if got a reply from email. Figure out best profession combos for the characters I plan on playing. Just repeat.
---
Thanks! I figured it was some sort of embroidery. I've done stuff similar to that process, I am thinking about replicating this!
---
It was a joke.

Gold selling websites used to do that back in BC if I remember correctly may have been wrath. They would die in the websites name haha
---
Techincally the discombobulator was made by a dragon. Anyway, people only hate gnomes because they are salty when a little gnome squashes them with a smug grin or cute little pig tails. It's like being beatup by a weeb. Embarassing.
---
In vanilla I got to 39 on my human warrior and then rerolled an orc warrior.
---
That is a lot of totems...I never played old shaman, I'm gonna have a fun time remembering all those lol. I can't wait!!
---
Gold sellers frequently send 40 or so level ones into a capital and aggro gamon till death or something to spell messages with corpses.
---
Wow, this...yeah
---
So what's your point? Still fail to see why your so butt hurt from a random true comment.
---
I'm tempted to level fury soley for piercing howl so I can gtfo if I over pull.
---
Absolutely not.

Some questions: 
---
The macro says drain soul rank 1. Does that mean we shouldn’t learn any past that?
---
Also, for the “max rank spells”, are those the only spells we should learn past rank 1?
---
Titanforged gear could also help /s
---
There won't be a &lt;Method&gt; to race against, or even if there is those 20 streamers they listed won't all be part of it. They'll just be featured on the Method twitch channel while playing in their own guilds.
---
Piles and piles of them!
---
8 5man teams running dungeons on a pve server should be pretty smooth.
---
Just like 99% of all games?
---
Once you go gnome you never go home
---
That's literally me the moment the WoW devs made clear that they're aiming towards TBC if classic is a success!
---
the addons can be reloaded in game without relogging. I think it has something to do with the updated game engine
---
so you'll be able to an able and disable them live without restarting
---
Classic's a dad game then. Fk this game
---
I'm not too well informed about pvp meta I believe resto sham is good for pvp, but you better google some guides to confirm. Also elem and enh shamans are good pvp (though enh relies heavily on windfury procs, so it's quite random). About shaman dps raiding - it is not impossible, elemental shamans in raids may not be meta, but there will be plenty of non-meta guilds... Hell, look at EsfandTV - that guy rolls retro-pally dps, he does not care that he's not #1 on the meters, he still dishes out a decent damage (he has to walk some extra miles for that though). And then again, during your leveling you can do even less meta stuff like going to heal OR EVEN TANK (that last one is tricky tho) as an enh sham - just make sure you have some side gear for those roles.
---
So if you feel like you really wanna be damage shammy, go ahead.
---
Go sword! Itll be pretty annoying either way but sword was better imo.
---
No changes
---
I can see how you would believe that you're going to get bored and you might. lizard kind of figured out that if they reward more of their player base than just the hardcore elite players that they can make more money. Even though a majority of their subscribers for casual players only a very small percentage were actually able to see in-game content in vanilla. The game changed vast amount between the burning crusade and its predecessor. But to me what was so fun about vanilla was becoming part of that hardcore elite. Granted I spent more than probably 40 hours a week in game. I'm not sure it's something I'm willing to invest that much time in again. But the game felt more difficult before burning crusade the world felt bigger without flying mounts. And I appreciated that challenge. Getting gear with so difficult. It was really tough for me when burning crusade came out that I was replacing epic gear that I worked so hard for with green and blue items. clearing out your character felt so much more rewarding when deer was tougher to get and took such a big effort to coordinate. I might never get back there but I look forward to being able to have that option of playing that way again.
---
I’m an early riser tank. I’ll join you.
---
On another note: I recently joined a guild of people in situations like ours. Most of the people in the guild are adults. They have kids, responsibilities, and not near the amount of time we wish we had to play.

If you’d like some more information I can point you in the right direction.

Gold sellers would use this to plaster cities with there websites. They probably will still do it just not res the dead
---
This was important because no had split screens back then. Now most of us have 2 monitors at least.
---
Honestly this idea that all sites should be charged the same is ignorant. Why should my father who goes on eBay occasionally pay the same as someone who games 8 hours of the day online? He has basic internet that fits his needs and I now have internet that fits mine.
---
I logged into retail the other day and saw legendaries on the AH. Wtf is that all about?
---
It read to me that they were putting a hard cap on characters/players created there, not on at one time during the layering phase. Oh well
---
ice
---
/run works, but there are some API calls that are protected from being used inside of scripts such as CastSpellByName()
---
There's no point in responding to this guy, he's either on a stream subreddit acting superior and jerking off esfand or he's here belittling people and acting almighty.
---
Achievements are cancer. Not just in WoW, but on any game or platform. 
---
Fuck that.
---
correct it was later adjusted to 0.1%
---
Looks like you’re switching servers all the way to the current retail version then. Expecting less than a 10m wait time on any of the servers is a little crazy.
---
&gt;Our plan is to identify everything we need to do should we ever decide to go this route. 
---
I'm reading this is "our current plan is to identify everything we need to do" - the "should we ever decide to go this route" meaning "we want to have everything lined and prepared if the demand is there".
---
The only winners are massive cable companies. Don't get why anyone would be against it.
---
Most people on pvp servers are going horde, please go alliance, think of the balance.
---
no
---
Data caps were already thing and were going to be a thing regardless.
---
doesn’t anyone else think the hwl sword is a little too short? Even on the pat pvp video with his Tauren, i feel like it should be half a ft longer
---
There is a hidden eastern egg when you fight Shade of Aran and someone has the staff equiped
---
vanilla had no achievments  so  classic  should nether.
---
method shill xD. im not a fan of method but you are just wrong. there are no nerfs. provide evidence in form of patchnotes or sit down
---
its probably blocked.
---
You're probably going to have to switch servers all the way to retail.
---
Hope I'm wrong tho. :(
---
Wouldn't make sense, either they add post-Naxx content and further increase the already steep gear curve for new players getting into raiding on established servers, or they add horizontal progression and people clear it first day then ignore it because they already have Naxx gear. Plus they have a shitload of beloved TBC/Wrath content that's going completely to waste.
---
Much rather they make progression servers to keep things fresh (seasons, if you will) and maybe separate TBC/Wrath servers for people that prefer that since the content is already done
---
I mean this site is just plain wrong since it doesn't include +healing or +frostdmg greens?
---
I seen videos of the raids I a see a few hunters
---
My prayers have been answered. Can't say that it will suck, but PoE Tower Defense doesn't interest me at all.
---
Im thinking I can slim it down and tidy that up a fair bit, doubt it will look to similar to that if I can get the add ons and put something together.
---
i had one of them ..when the patch hit i ran to the  npc to see what i could buy  for new mounts  but had an addon that traded in quest autocratically .... well they added a quest to trade in old mounts for new mounts vs amor .
---
I wrote a ticket but gm's back in the days did not help for stuff of that kinda... i was pretty pissed x(
---
Someone give this man a medal.
---
Don't have time off, so I plan to minimize time spent on things that aren't playing. So, things I can just shove in the oven/in a pot or pan. That said, I'm not trying to rush leveling too much, nor do I have a raid guild already to heal in, though I'll be looking for one at 60. Anyway:
---
- Several bottles of diet soda.
---
- 3-4 days of tomato/meat sauce in the freezer. Just need to warm that + pasta.
---
- 2 x egg/broccoli/cheese/bacon pies, also frozen.
---
- Past that, probably some frozen chicken breast. That + rice + greens (probably broccoli again)
---
- Might also buy a couple frozen pizzas from the store, just to top up/as backup.
---
Already **well** over a week with that. The plan is to make it Sunday and freeze it. I plan to continue to get my sleep, and be a responsible adult.
---
Oh hell yes brother! That sounds like exactly what I am looking for.
---
Fury Warriors looked really stupid with their mismatched plate, mail, and leather. Who cares they stopped looking stupid when you realized the amount of DPS they were capable of.
---
I always liked getting the sets though and standing in Ironforge doing my auctioning and other business. It was like a cool achievement get the sets.
---
I understood that reference.
---
Buffing classes is a nerf to content.
---
I feel bad for your that your life is shilling for a guild trying to 'world first' 15 year old content.
---
If you're interested in making serious bank go to Tanaris and fish for Stonescale Eels
---
You totally can if you're willing to download an emulator. There are a some options of you Google around for running the world locally with your client. So the world will not have any mobs or npcs (and obviously nothing you did would actually effect your character's on wow). But as far as configuring your interface you could use such a thing to do that.
---
Haven't done it personally, but it is doable depending on how much you care. Personally think it's not that importantant. You'll have plenty of time waiting for mob spawns and such to configure your UI.
---
How did we survive before 2015 when net neutrality was first started ? Seemed to be no issues back then
---
Gotta turn every ability into a macro with /startattack added on to it of course
---
[www.youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com) has literally a billion guides for classic hunters. gl my dude
---
But this does has nothing to do with getting attunement to MC tho? :-) its part of the clearing of MC, but the attunement should still be the same quests chain with "attunement to the core"?(?)
---
I did read it, dynamic respawns and queue times solve the issue for the players. It takes more server processing power because more people are pooled, but that's limited by queue times and having more servers, and just getting better servers. Not like this is an indie company that can't afford that easily.
---
I really hope they do reset them about 15-30 min in advance
---
Likely we'll see new classic exclusive codes given out in future events.
---
Why should paladins be a raid tank and not Shamans?
---
Searching Vanilla too much lol.
---
come on bro.. they're doing it for the community /s
---
100% agree, they're creating a monopoly on WOW streaming which is a joke.

I threw up in my mouth a little

Party Planning Committee is a WoW Classic Alliance PvE guild forming to progress through end game content at a competitive pace with a laid back attitude and realistic expectations.

---
(Just Remember your P.A.R.A.N.T.S)
---
\_\_\*\*Leveling Expectations and Goals:\*\*\_\_
---
In an ideal world we will being raiding in October 2019.  This gives players a few weeks to level effectively, gear a fair amount, and begin with us.  We do not expect people to race to 60, if you want to, more power to you, but we would like to give everyone time to level and enjoy it.  If we have a solid core of 60s earlier than anticipated, then we will begin raiding beforehand.  During this time of leveling we expect the guild to be social and help people out within reason.  Grouping together and growing as a team is the best way to prepare for raiding.

Thank god it seems like there will be BC or a BC option. Get me away from all these people who got theirs and want to fuck everyone else over who wanted one of the earlier xpacs.
---
&gt;" I'd be fine playing my vanilla characters for the next 10 years. Sure I'd have maxed out gear, and level on every class. And it'd be boring as fuck! But fuck those expansions the majority of WoW players thought were the best!"
---
Classic+ crowd is so annoying.
---
Exactly how i feel. Actually if i'm not mistaken literally almost every pvp server population on wow retail several years ago favored horde. It was such a bad experience playing as alliance. I think that's one of the reasons they implemented war mode. Really really wish the servers would be close to equal, doubt it though.
---
No blessing of salvation and all the melee dogs have windfury too... soooo
---
hahahah
---
Does that make it okay?
---
hello sir i am apart of this community and understand it well.
---
method ruins every game and they are a complete outlier; however, even they will have a hard time doing something like collecting (and STORING) 800,000 linen before day 1 just so lowbies can't participate in the war effort. i think you are severely underestimating the logistics of being able to have every single material ready to turn in immediately on release; collecting 19k firebloom is not an easy task regardless of your strategy.
---
most hardcore guilds will only be partially prepared for some of the objectives, such as having 180k light leather. only a hyperminority of people meet the criteria you describe in your personal anecdote; most people do not have an incentive to collect thousands of peacebloom.
---
Arms is better, and it better prepares you for being a 60 warrior
---
Yup, Exactly!
---
30 minutes, and it does not reset with you creating/deleting characters.
---
Listen carefully dumbass both methods are completely fine I have seen twitch streams. The intro OP posted is too long for what it was. I said your comment was irrelevant because you think a video is superior.
---
I got that during Legion when I was tanking random heroics. It was inside a tank bag.
---
Ahh, an afk work from home true classic wow-er.
---
You can’t go to the bathroom, you’re stacking sunder armor.
---
u/Pimdaz was awesome and tested this. Apparently the maximum time you can sit in character creation is 30 minutes.
---
Orc 100%, especially for when you get the boots in a BG and they do that "haulin ass" run.

They are useful to save money, if you fish/cook you don't have to buy food from vendors (unless you're a mage and can conjure it), especially if you were a hunter when you still had to constantly feed your pet to keep it happy.
---
Honestly, who can love a gnome. Disgusting creatures.
---
As someone who will be logging in ASAP on Monday, I hope they don't. But it does make the most sense.
---
Roflmao tbc is vanilla cranked up to 11
---
Not to mention every guide is suggesting picking up skinning to vendor skins for money, wich keans another 50% of those guides suggest farming a bit of devilsaur at lvl 60 to get some gold also. We will have higher supply also from it. And fresh server means that no1 will have the capacity to buy it leading to lower prices overall in the srart because players cant afford expensive items because there is not enough money in circulation.

This was the only epic boe I found. I was in STV leveling my shaman. I was partied with my friend that only really played to socialize. He was flying to booty bay when this drop hit the need or greed party loot screen. He njnja’d it.
---
I moreso meant for themselves. I guess I dont understand playing something 40 hours to the point where I have to physically force myself to continue. But hey, guess I'm not having fun playing while fully rested so I can consciously experience the entire game. Have fun grueling over wow and letting it keep you from being physically and mentally healthy. Because that's apparently fun.
---
Biggest tool i've ever watched doing vanilla content so far is tipsout he tries to follow the same bravado as asmongold but he can't so he just comes off as a dick.
---
Is this the same Agramon that played in TBC?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evY1Q9KdXfM

was one of my favourite movies from that era

My only concern is whether those weights will translate to the best dps.

---
Your experiment is my life lol, being non-24 sucks a lot but it will definitely be a big advantage for leveling when I'm on a nightcycle.
---
You have to commit entirely. Only food you can eat through a straw. Just throw your pizza in a blender and you're off to the races.
---
It makes it preferable in some cases.  Such as in this case.  It used to be a good game, then they turned it to shit.  Now it's going back to being a good game and some people are saying "well it eventually has to turn to shit because I say so"
---
Can anyone point me to any information on hit rating value for rogues.  I know it's high because of white damage, but it seems like overkill to prioritize it over the crit cap on white dmg.
---
I love it
---
Simply: because it's not the authentic experience.
---
Any changes to classic, no matter how good or bad, will always leave some people feeling like it's not the same, so it will never meet their expectations.
---
Why wait until launch?
---
Nope. Can't wait for tbc. :P
---
That's why they are the devs and you are not :)
---
Haha, I got out 3 years ago
---
Holy shit this sub can be so cringe.
---
He’s going to dead.
---
The risk is oversupply.
---
The extra attacks trigger flurry, so it scales alot better too.
---
I will turtle because gifting a win is silly
---
Luckily I have a large group of friends I'll be playing with for the majority of my time, and I don't think I'm competing with any of them for main spec gear. 
---
I played rogue from BC until Legion before quitting, so I can vaguely remember some old rogue info, but classic feels like another beast I don't want to underestimate.
---
I do have a fond nostalgic feeling for hemo rogue from playing him in BC, so i might give that a shot!
---
Or you know, you could use your brain and just make the the macros on retail WoW and just copy the WTF folder from retail to the Classic folder?
---
This is why I said classic + is the way to go.......
---
Build on the strengths of classic. Build on the game so many people are hyped about. Imagine how incredible it would be to get new content in the style of classic wow in this day and age. 
---
TBC is the slippery slope it all started on. 
---
OSRS did it right. They realized what hopefully blizzard will as well. Keep the game popular amongst the gaming community by sticking to the roots while you keep your whales happy on your other game.
---
What was the whole point of this thing if you just repeat everything again. Your argument also applies to TBC and Wotlk so what do we do in 5 years? Cata?
---
Happy cake day
---
When I reach lvl40 I am legit going to respec into Balance for Moonkin form and I'm also going to spec into Natural Weapons and Omen and going to use my staff as a wand
---
Starfall --&gt; Wrath --&gt; Moonfire --&gt; melee --&gt; (Wrath on Omen procs)
---
It's probably not going to be good but I'm going to try it out.
---
&gt; hate speech
---
not a real thing
---
turn skeletons back on
---
Why dont you just ignore classic esports?
---
This week, and a good half of last week, too. I usually don't have motivation troubles at all, but I'd wager at least 25% of my working day now goes by with me on reddit, or watching youtube, or reading guides with information I already know. Might be 50% on the worse days.
---
It's actually terrible, because it makes the work days feel much longer than when I work. I also don't think it'll improve next week, because I tried to get holidays like 4 months ago, but it was denied due to others being away (paternity leave). So, I'll be stuck at work, even when the game's up. And I'm unlikely to be very productive then, either.
---
Don't you guys have phones?!
---
You had the opportunity to test them during the stress test if you really wanted it that badly.
---
All the gnome hate has actually inspired me to make a gnome rogue cuz the thought of someone raging that hard from being killed by a certain race is hilarious to me :D
---
In all honesty i think that 90% of ppl who "hate" on gnomes are just doing it cuz they think it makes them cooler.
---
I'm not moving goal posts... i merely commented on what I do. If you want to be different do you. I am not arguing or debating with you. I really don't care how you play the game. My way has always worked for me. I have been practicing for years and it works. Is it not possible for people not just to comment? I really don't care how anyone else plays. I am not here to debate you or anyone else.
---
Hah, yes *world. My husband has been teasing me about it already. "Hey, has the enter word button turned green yet?" Probably going to be an inside joke now.
---
The only time I ever saw one in person was when I had to open a ticket to fix a bugged dungeon : (
---
Shattered Halls timed run and a door not opening in Magister's Terrace.
---
Was the stress test not available to all subs for around 4 days recently?
---
Getting like
---
All I can say is anecdotal evidence but being banned for abusive language was pretty uncommon back in the day. People being racist in public was basically a given and many mainstream memes were explicitly racist. Reddit  early on had many very offensive boards and only started to clean up it's act this decade.
---
Most of us will be sat in our own filth, not just character creation
---
Without the method shills to pump their little "world first in a 15 year old game, yay!" epeens up, this thread would have disappeared already.
---
Don't encourage people. Any hunter that needs on HoJ if there is somebody else in the party that also needs it is a ninja and deserves to be blacklisted.
---
It's actually pally and shaman for their multihit class mechanics... It's trash in the first two raids for everyone regardless due to the fire resist on bosses anyways, though PvP it has more viability.
---
I think this will be the great surprise of this - that instances are actually hella efficient. I distinctly recall the hardcore guilds on my server running hellfire ramparts at the start of tbc to level at crazy speeds, and with the competition for mobs and tanking etc., I’m guessing classic won’t be different.
---
How's the faction imbalance?
---
Hunters use mend pet mate, we casters too.
---
If you're referring to Shadowmeld, it can't be used in combat.
---
Yeah the gear is okay, but nothing beats getting downed in a ks by a guy who can't reach your kneecaps lol
---
Any original WoW devs or you guys just taking credit for a 15 year old game? Seems pretty lackluster when private servers had better open world play than what it appears to be in official servers
---
With the later patch loot from dungeons it should mostly concern the wand spot I guess, OP's pic doesn't have a wand.
---
Same thing with mage, shadowpriest, warlock. Iirc the +dmg goes up to 17 and +healing to 33 or 35 on wands. Easily beats out Stormrager or Bonecreeper Stylus.
---
It refunds part of the cost.
---
I'm positive there are no examples of a Mok'Nathal Druid in lore.
---
No way? When did they allow it to be used in combat?
---
The only edit is me adding the last part of my comment calling out the specific issues bud.
---
And solution? Where did I say I was providing a solution? Since when does voicing concerns constitute as crying?
---
Why are you so defensive about this poor decision on their part? Is the echo chamber of this answer's comment chain not enough for you to be satisfied?
---
You should do a post about this
---
Actually, the community as a whole does indeed have a say in it. Any hunter who need rolls on HoJ over a melee in their group \*is\* a ninja looter.
---
Damn lol, and yeah morning classes suck
---
You know she's undead right? This is a living corpse.
---
They've just confirmed the skeletons will disappear immediately after death, because they don't want people spelling the n-word with skeletons.
---
Awesome :) have fun man.
---
Yeah, mage nova would be a big one, and I can certainly see it coming in clutch for when that warrior or hunter is about to get away and you have the combo points on them waiting to finish them off.
---
&gt;switching over from herod
---
nah.  simply more people joining every day.  if people were switching off herod, it wouldn't be full anymore.  it's been full since before every other realm was full and high
---
theyre my hate corpses and i want them now!
---
One time in classic I picked a server and made 12 trolls, and then named them the lyrics to Milkshake by Kelis. Then I ran each one to die in org.
---
for the same reason I can't ignore, lfd,lfr,crz,sharding,raid modes and homogenized crap on retail.  Its a mmo, its not a vacuum. when method does unnecessary shit like this the rest of the server thinks its the norm and demands the name level of obsessive min maxing raider IO garbage from everyone.
---
Do you guys not have phones?!
---
If a member of your party engages someone you get the honor too.  If youre outside that persons party healing them you also get that honor.
---
Its just that HK's have a diminishing returns on them.  So if youve killed the same people over and over again in a BG, soon you wont get any honor for killing them.    You either have them leave to let others in that give you honor, you leave to wait out your 15 min deserter and join another BG, or you win/lose in a quick fashion to reset the DR's for those ppl youve killed in that BG so when you meet them again in another BG or out in the world youll start the whole DR cycle over.
---
Won't be able to kill rag without fire resist. Tanks get 2 shot
---
Well we can both be in agreement then that vanilla was best :)
---
&gt;HUGE advantage
---
lol, ok.
---
There was like 3 or so stress tests that gave people lots of time to do that lol
---
I was one of them. 
---
Also there's a sandbox out there but apparently there's some sketchy shit with a hidden miner on it so idk,
---
This might be the MOST obvious proof that people don't read the OP.
---
Wait, twelve hours? I start getting physical pain and need to take a break after just two. Damn, twelve...
---
As cool as that could be, would they be able to accomplish it with such different staff? 
---
Allen adham and Rob Pardo were so heavily involved with vanilla wow game design I struggle to see how they could pull it off without them.
---
And im sure many others played a fundamental role, no doubt.
---
Pleas reconsider this for the skeletons. Corpses I can understand.
---
I'm a little miffed that nobody at all asked the direct question.
---
"Are you going to allow people to pay to transfer off-realm or change their names if they get themselves into a lot of trouble on their first realm?"
---
There were like 3 questions that sidetracked into the pure aspect of whether or not there would be paid services. And all that was said was that character transfers were the only thing on the table. But that is NOT a direct answer. It's a vague assumption we're pulling from. I wish someone had asked this straight up. I would have, but I was out in the real world when the AMA happened. Damn. =(
---
[He's also got a video about the legacy of raiding in Classic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDP3T3j2vOc) that is equally good.
---
I think you're conflating very secluded portions of the internet with actual mainstream places. WoW is infinitely more toxic today than it was in 2004.
---
If I can't make a bunch of characters and write a swastika with bodies then is it even classic? 
---
/s pls don't ban me
---
I thought I was looking into a mirror for a second
---
You have neither the numbers nor the knowledge to support what **you** said...
---
You def should. It's a great idea
---
If you find yourself waiting around for people it’s a thing to do.  Fishing tourneys on PVP servers are nuts!
---
It’s eating updates sorry had a g drive issue
---
I clapped my little hands, when both me and my best mate got our original character names reserved! :D
---
Hard agree.
---
Once previous content became trivial enough for people to solo and farm gear/titles/achievements they never "earned" I lost interest in the game. It devalued the work my friends and I put in. 
---
I realize how elitist that makes me sound, but that's just how I feel.
---
Lol because only people who made characters the first day are serious players. /s
---
What did I say?  I literally said it would be interesting to find out.
---
while true, and I'm not taking sides here, he was specifically the *spell* designer.  He *created* the spells we are talking about.  and he didn't just design them on paper, he used the spell creation tools that were available to him and actually implemented them in the game.
---
Again, memory is memory, but to discount him as just a designer, particularly when the topic is spell behavior, is a bit strange.
---
The Gnome Racial is amazing in PVP, that's it.
---
The Intellect Racial gives you a whopping 2 (two) more dps at level 60 with medium gear and about 2 Frostbolts worth of mana.
---
Play human unless you want to PVP excessively, in which case I would pick Gnome if I can stand the race.
---
And you forgot to do your homework
---
Um, excuse me. I don't see any other staff giving +attack power?
---
Checkmate, nerd.
---
mc takes 30 min to clear with 40 people in bwl/aq gear and with preclearing trash. 30 min is far from the norm.
---
The law doesn't actually stop people from doing what they want. Otherwise we wouldn't have prisons.
---
Software is easy. Doing things like identifying people in pictures, summarizing written text, and making classic wow are all cake for programmers. ;)
---
too bad most of the playerbase for OSRS use fuckin runelite which makes the game easier anyways.
---
Double jokes on you, for I am a night elf. My people were old when you took your first hoof clops
---
Very good
---
WHAT FORUM IS THIS!?
---
For the horde!!!!! See you guys on Herod PvP realm next week. My orc rogue is going to shred
---
You could join a game - play for hours - go to bed - join back into the same AV the day after. It was a real war back in the days

# INTEREST YA IN A PINT?

---
Nostalgia brings you back. Enjoyment keeps you around for a few months. Well see how the game is come December.
---
&lt;3 Safe adventures, friend
---
You did the right thing.
---
I don't know how to take this.
---
You've shortened my life expectancy by a solid 50years.
---
Awesome vid sir! Now get me to Un’Goro so I can farm that Essence of Fire and get riiiich again! Rich I tell ya! Haha
---
There is important missing info. What happens when invites happen on a capped layer. Will the whole server be able to gather on one single layer or players will be kicked out of the layer?
---
My first Epic drop was from Sunken Temple off of a trash mob. ( Boots of Avoidance).
---
Myself and another Warrior that was teaching my the ropes and guiding me around the world had it drop.
---
He gave the Epic Boots to me, and I was so grateful.
---
You should have played the stresstest mate.
---
Dude i feel you. Took me like a year to 60 in vanilla, had like 10 lvl 20-30s though. I guess just try to take pleasure in seeing that max lvl go up on one character, you get to do new content and get closer to end game.
---
OH hot damn I have not seen this old gem for many, MANY years!
---
One of my favourite gifs of all time. The seamless translation from LotR to WoW is hilarious!
---
Honestly, I would bet that with this few servers so far, there's going to be an hour+ long queue no matter what server you decide to play on. 
---
I think Blizzard way underestimated the interest in Classic - and honestly, I feel a little insulted.
---
Eternal should not be available until P5 or P6.
---
The UBRS quest item is 100% - the Wowhead information is wrong because the item does not drop if nobody in the raid has the quest. The same problem exists with loads and loads of quest items.
---
Should just make all wow raids, TBC and WOTLK at an equal level, minor gear differences so its all still playable.   
---
Level it all so its all played.
---
I for sure agree with that
---
What are your plans after all the content from Vanilla is cleared? How will Activision force you to find a way to monetize the game after the player-base grows bored?
---
What is there to get? You haven't relayed anything to me other than I am mistaken.
---
Thank you! This clarified a lot. This should be a sticky somewhere. I'm sorry for being skeptical about it, seems layering is the best option. Thank you again for all the work!
---
Linux Client, When???
---
I had a druid named Moam for years until I name changed on my own. I think you'll be alright unless you draw attention to it.
---
&gt;if people were switching off herod, it wouldn't be full anymore.
---
This is so not true. Herod is very likely at a point where thousands of players could leave and it would still have more than other 'full' realms.
---
isn't ramstein on the undead side?
---
What part of “WoW Classic” don’t you understand? 
---
I waited upwards of an hour back in 2004/5.
---
Who cares? This is for classic wow. Pirates have their own reddit.
---
If you're going to be a lazy shithole and make your coworkers shoulder your burden, you deserve to be fired. It's a good thing you don't work for me.
---
Like he said, grow up.
---
Possibly worse, if people still stubbornly don't migrate.  I'm sure tons of people will stop playing in the first 1-3 months, but say Herod is still experiencing 10-15k queues from day 1 through the start of P2, its only going to get worse with layering turned off because now you've gone from say, 5-6 layers with ~3000 people each to 1 world with 3000 people and 15k behind them waiting to get in.
---
How long do your poops take...
---
I would much rather have Classic+ than TBC!
---
Pff hahaha HAHAH
---
gOOD One
---
Generally it doesn't matter in pve. Pvp, some will have a preference. Gnomes Escape artist ability is really nice to escape cc especially a rogues cc. But again engineering can provide many items to help.
---
No.
---
I'm not sure what you're even talking about? What sandbox?
---
Hahah ok good point, but basically if the higher pop server I'm on has a huge q i'll just go to the lesser pop server and deal with it there.
---
dying and getting sent to an extremely far away graveyard
---
It’s almost like there’s not reason behind the hate
---
That’s a spicy hot take. Why do we even have laws?
---
What’d u decide on bro
---
I’m actually going to buy this when I get home lol that’s awesome thanks
---
I have also checked multiple videos. The 5man exp unintentionally being the 4man exp sounds feasible.
---
They boosted the numbers.   
---
I think Blizz should "scale" the required amounts with the size of the server and resources available.   
---
Not changing this will suck.
---
I could have swore mages had invisibility back in beta that got removed.
---
You literally told me how to play before I got interested in responding to this thread lol. Just stop responding in the future rather than attempting to take the high road after it’s obvious you’re back tracking.
---
This plus I got a new job which I'm starting in a month. Not very productive at the office, to say the least. I'm watching TI and reading about classic/following the classic discords all day.
---
Pro tip here. I spam hamstring to dps,
---
cough. tens of thousands could leave and it would still be full. cough.
---
You're correct - its one extra level.
---
Demon hunter
---
It will be classic world first and it's happening!
---
why would a dragon with control of time need to invent a temporal discombobulator?  clearly chromie is a gnome with the technology to perfectly disguise herself as a dragon, where she learned how to invent such a thing.  the dragons would never agree to this
---
I highly doubt it. That would mean you may not be able to get your rewards before somebody else overtakes you.
---
"Please stop bringing up and making comparisons with RuneScape..."
---
So you must have seen people making comparisons with WoW and RuneScape in other threads here
---
but
---
you chose not to ask them to stop specifically, and instead made a vague callout post
---
i just find that really brave
---
This.
---
...
---
Go away
---
Right on, I'd be glad to be wrong about that 😅 Please let me know how it works, I'm genuinely curious.
---
I know bro, I have them too. It was a joke, since it sounds like 'what's tha..'.
---
But apparently it didn't land, too bad!
---
To inconvenience people who want to play on private servers, obviously.
---
When it comes to killing opposing faction NPCs I think it will be alot harder in classic no private server I have seen have the guard spawning mechanics right. When it comes to cooldowns I believe the 1% will just get the buff in off hours and raidlogg. The rest of us will just have to manage
---
Just gotta put her in some hot water to moisten and warm up the good parts.
---
Great explanation of this system!
---
But from the sounds of it this is just for the first phase at which point layering will be turned off, and that phase sounds like it's primarily launch so shouldn't effect the game too much
---
Nah, layering will ruin it, it won’t be as hectic as nostalrius was
---
Firemaw went medium in 18mins
---
Would people expect you to just sit there and twiddle your thumbs?

Chromie just fucks around like doctor who.
---
tfw you realize you can setup macros in notepad
---
When I started as a Gnome, my brother started as a dwarf. We stumbled on the Gnomeregan instance and after, we tried to “discover” more dungeons by searching for caves. We mainly found yetis, lol.
---
I have it on two of my accounts lol. Wasn't even trying for the mount either time.
---
You keep providing examples which have absolutely nothing to do with mainstream media lol. I'm sure the dark shitholes of the web were incredibly racist a decade ago, but WoW wasn't one of those places. The internet has become incredibly toxic since WoW originally debuted and you're a lot more likely to encounter an asshat on the internet today than you were playing WoW in 2004.
---
&gt; OK, so first clearly your comment about subbing was pointless since it doesn't affect what we're talking about,
---
It shows that everyone isn't super invested like you guys seem to assume.   
---
&gt; that doesn't mean Blizzard can't predict within a few percentage points how many will be live on launch day(s).  
---
Yet here we are days before release panic opening new servers.
---
I don’t know what you’re doing then because I’ve used it for nearly ten years and it takes up significantly less space than hodgepodging something with the same functionality out of different addons, especially in a world where 40 man raiding exists
---
I didn't say smaller than classic+ crowd, but I had no idea there was a subreddit for it. I really wouldn't even consider using it as judgement. Hell, I promise a significant portion of people playing Classic won't even know there's specifically a r/classicwow subreddit. It's a terrible metric to use.
---
What I'm saying is it isn't a majority. It never will be. Pretty much everyone wants the classic experience (#nochanges), but very few are going to want to relive it forever (the crowd you are referring to as #nochanges). Also, while it's even possible a majority want to see TBC, it simply won't end well. I regret to say that simple fact makes all other arguments moot in my opinion. If this is to last, there is one option. You can make side arguments about how it could still be good, but you cannot argue that the game will not be guaranteed to die. That is simply the truth.
---
We're not crazy, just enthusiastic. ; )
---
The skeleton change makes me pretty bummed out, it was always cool when you'd come into your capital and see skeletons everywhere and be like "oh crap what happened here?"
---
Yeah, but it shouldn't be.

---
Will Dishonorable Kills be a thing?  I remember them destroying world pvp back in vanilla.
---
Hell if I know it's a horrible picture. ;)
---
The most important thing about classic is actually Tarren Mill vs.Southshore. Change my mind
---
We need more aliance on skeram
---
I never said my characters name was the reason I want to stay on Herod. 
---
It's about communities. People already chose Herod. I'm sure my guild isn't alone in this, we have about 60 something people interested in playing Classic. We have 2 other allied guilds full of people as well playing on Herod. We want to stay together. 
---
By moving realms we're risking splintering. People are also worried about dead servers in 2-3 months. Herod is popular and likely has a lower risk of fizzling out. It's currently also streamer free which is appealing to a lot of people. 
---
I think Herod is a unique case and would require a unique solution.
---
So unfair that mob beasts can parry but druids in beast form can't.
---
Yes, and his neck didn’t come out until 1.4 iirc. So it shouldn’t be on this phase 1 listing.
---
For me it's the difference between 35 ping and 110.
---
I'm not saying they should priority take it over a melee that needs it for several phases.  If they talk with the group and that group is OK with them rolling on it, more power to them finding a group that does it.  But you're going to be hard pressed to get main roll on HoJ as a Hunter/Druid, even though it's pre-raid BiS.
---
Getting a credit for contributing to an iteration of a meme for the WoW Classic Reddit - my mum’ll be so proud
---
The first ever rag kill was April 25 2005 yet you guys killed him just a month later with only 28 people?
---
The idea of mostly acquiescing to the private vanilla server community's no changes demands for classic WoW, and then turning around and changing subsequent expansions to cater to those people,  when the expansions brought the game to an entirely new (and much larger) population, strikes me as absurd.
---
Simply have some mechanism for people who want to proceed to TBC to be allowed to do so, and then replicate TBC with the same care you've shown with vanilla. I loved vanilla WoW, but there are far more people who never touched the game until TBC or Wrath, and they are no less valuable than me.
---
Yup you’re absolutely right. Most people have a life. I don’t so I’m aiming for 3 weeks to hit 60.
---
Get this shit outta here
---
I just realized how this comment could be taken out of context lmfao
---
Yeah, you have no idea what the fuck you're talking about. The sandbox was a way to log into your characters on a blank world and setup your keybinds/addons. Nothing more.
---
Mods r gay if you will?
---
Earthmother guide your path.
---
You can farm rep on elementals in Silithus. Dedicated guilds will have people grinding those while leveling. You don't even need 7 people at honored as you can summon people back and forth to get more quintessences.
---
every zone and dungeon being a memory is what made the game great. i can't even recall what i did in BFA when it released.
---
"Quiver ladies, quiver!"
---
Yeah, I can imagine being off peak hours on release week is going to be real nice to dodge the queues.
---
This gives me anxiety.
---
Why should the people who liked those expansions exactly how they were be treated as lesser to the people who demanded a faithful vanilla?
---
Why make someone the main tank of a 40 man raid if you don’t trust them?
---
This is a poorly considered comment.
---
Your people were still trolls living in caves when the first Tauren walked upon Kalimdor. Read your history again. It took a magic puddle to make you what you are now, one that your society tried to use to consort with demons and then exploded, causing the greatest calamity the world has ever seen. You hid in your trees, contentedly ignoring the rest of the world as the centaurs drove us to the brink of extinction, and *still* we joined your kind on the slopes of Mount Hyjal to save *your* tree from a monster that *your* kind introduced to Azeroth in the first place. The Kaldorei have more than ten thousand years of crimes to atone for before, and still I offer peace first. But if you insist on misguided vengeance, you will swiftly know the full fury of the earth and sky.
---
You must be new to add on development...
---
Runemaster would be neat, sounds like a half melee staff, half range dot class
---
I honestly thought it was Lights without even knowing her name or really recalling if she was Canadian or not. lol
---
Oo oo do one for resto druids please!
---
I think part of the issue is that Warriors are OP as fuck in vanilla, so it attracts that type of person.  FOTM dbags.
---
I'm right there with you there, just looking for some chill people to enjoy and play Classic WoW. I'd be down to play on either faction as well! Message me sometime
---
Lol a couple of hours.
---
Well, in the case of  Loremaster yes, an addon could track it. In Classic there is no achievements for addons to track but addons can check what quests has been completed and there will be many addons showing the list of all quests available in the game. So, if we consider Loremaster as just complete all the quests is as easy as using a quest addon with a database of all quest and check that there is no quest incomplete. Those kind of addons are capable of filter to ignore quests of different classes, professions, faction or raid quests for those who do not want to raid.
---
eh, I'm starting with a 72 hour marathon at launch before going to a 6 off 18 on schedule for the rest of the week. I've done 3 previous 72 hour marathons (3 separate D2 ladder resets) so I at least have experience doing these kinds of marathons. 40 doesn't seem that crazy.
---
Who cares? You won’t even be able to craft it. 
---
Or are you mad because you still won’t be able to get it?
---
Yeah.... no. The sandbox uses your actual Classic client. It works fine. Just sucks the author had to be a little shit.
---
Yeah, just the way "I" want it, nevermind all the people that were asking for it over the last week as it continually came up in discussions to the point that it was highly upvoted in the Q&amp;A thread. But okay, pretend it is just me.
---
Animated Chain Necklace was released in 1.4, so its presumed it’ll come in phase 2.
---
I didn't know that crit doubled your damage, thanks.
---
Yeah that's not really due to faction allegiance, racial abilities are squarely to blame for that.  The min/max and hard-core crowd are never the problem in the context of this conversation, they go wherever is "best".  In vanilla, TBC, and most of Wrath Alliance had dominance in both PVP and PVE.  Cata and MoP is where Horde started gaining favor, but Legion is where the game went full-tilt towards Horde.  Thanks, Blood Elves.
---
True.  But I don't know if anyone has really figured out how long it would take you to level someone up using nothing but rested XP?  I'd think it would take you a whole year to do that.
---
Please remember it's not pronounced "pownage" or "pawnage", it's pronounced "ownage".
---
Soulstones for eyes
---
Not sure why that's relevant - I'm from EU for clarification, perhaps that has some reason for why everyone I know is not so interested, while your friends are.
---
23!
---
One in the same, friend
---
Can you create similar list for other classes as well?
---
Yes i left retail about 5 months ago i really think i am done after all these years.
---
Posting a streaming event in the sub that has raging hate boners for them probably wasn’t thenwiset by reading the comments. 
---
Kinda sad. The ego elitism here is quite a turn off to browse there was a top post here saying you don’t wanna be like the man wow sub. But I’d take that over the vitriol here when you don’t act like you’ve played since friends and family beta. 
---
Just enjoy the game and support everyone who plays it. I mean hell they might bring in more folks you can feast on in arathi or hillsbrad all day. Wouldn’t that be nice.
---
&gt;&lt;Kor Kron Vanguard&gt;
---
Huh, neat name. I started an RP guild on Moon Guard way back in Wrath called &lt;The Kor'kron Legion&gt;. Good times.
---
Yes. We literally watched them do it on stream. Dungeon grinding is an efficient way to level.
---
If you want to play a Death Knight, go play Retail.
---
I don't remember if this was in classic or not, but Stiches was able to be pulled to Goldshire on Nostalrius.

I would love a "Classic style" alternate timeline. BC, but reworks to things like PvP and Badge gear, plus maybe a better story.

---
There will be a couple of guilds trying to get world first. The strategic challenge is who planned their the rush the best.
---
Maybe some Pserver freaks are gonna clear MC with a lvl 56 raid.
---
Laughable. Wish I had more downvotes.
---
I dunno how you do it. I get so hyped about some games I don't function properly when I'm waiting for them to release, or re-release in this case. I dunno how I'd react if they suddenly postpone this close to launch.
---
You can train Imp at lvl 1. Did it on the stress test
---
Gives us more time to get that sexy bastard. I approve!
---
Towngear was a thing though!

I was actually really frustrated because a similar issue happened to me during the name reservation process. 
---
I was waiting for the servers to come online, got on to the server I wanted about 3 minutes later. I picked my name and selected create character but nothing happened. I was praying that it was just temporary lag and that it would create my guy but after sitting there for 15 minutes spamming create character I decided to try a different name, again... nothing happened. I had to relog and wait in queue. Of course the name I wanted had been taking once I got back in.
---
The option is to preinstall it and launch is next week.
---
You can't set your own group as a dps or healer, because it takes forever.   You also have to pass lead to the tank eventually, so he can disregard your rules.
---
Tanked a lot actually.   Never acted like an entitled douchebag that expected shit for free, because my role was in demand more.
---
Nah best part is mind controlling baby hordies off the great lift.
---
I tried farming Dreamfoil there and it seemed like the respawn rate was abysmal. I'd go from the southwest to the north, hitting every spawn point of it that I passed by, and only find like 2 nodes the entire way.
---
If they allow transfers they will only allow from high pop to low pop, not the other way around
---
You can download it and log in to choose a server and make up to 3 characters, but you can't actually start playing yet.

No no keep talking about how wow turned ez mode. 😂😂😂 that really proved your point 🤣🤣🤣☝️☝️☝️😅😅😅
---
As stated before - many times - by several people...the two talent point thing is not only stupid - but isn't even relevant because nothing you'll gain outweighs stoneform or escape artist - additionally it's not really even 2 extra talent points...it's just moving from a talent you either wouldn't take - or would take all 5 points anyway to move down the tree because the other would be useless.
---
I think most people are just telling you not to question it because they know the correct answer and are tired of explaining it to every lazy ass person who won't use Google.
---
Woooooo
---
Melee crits are 100% without talents, spell crits are 50% without talents.
---
I was a hunter and I trained some skills but forgot to do the follow up quest to learn Feed Pet. My cats kept running away and I wanted to feed them but I didn’t know how...??? Saw my cat could eat fish and looked over: fishies were swimming in the water...! I jumped in to try to catch them... spent like two hours sadly swimming through the fish failing to catch even one...
---
I’m not entirely sure, though I would like to think they patterns are going to BoP. If they are BoE, they will cost hundreds if not over a thousand gold just for the pattern.
---
What a nerd... That being said I giggled like a little girl when I got my name last night.
---
It's huge vs almost everyone, tbh.
---
1 GCD allows you to quickly control the spacing in so many different situations.
---
Yes but it's text based. Walk up to a guard and type "Hi, where's the bank?" For example.
---
&gt;!Just kidding.!&lt;
---
If you plan on playing more than one character maybe a spreadsheet would be easier to manage, IMO ofc.
---
&gt; That would be like starting a diet losing twenty pounds and then stopping and gaining all the weight back. 
---
Please refrain from attacking me personally in the future.
---
Gear progression cannot simply exist only vertically.  Lateral progression can be something great too.  Gear could be made so that it fits certain builds, playstyles, or whatever quirky thing they come up with.  Infinite vertical power grinds end up being bad for the game and the community.
---
It doesn't matter if it is a million people.  You want it to be changed so it's not the same as it was.  They aren't trying to give us a new gaming experience.  They're trying to give us an accurate as possible 1.12 experience.  They aren't remastering it.  
---
Petitions are stupid.  "Hey, if we get enough people to sign up for a stupid idea, Blizzard has to allow it!"  Ok, so I get five million people to sign a petition and upvote in an AMA that Goblins should be added as a third playable faction to WoW Classic.  Now Blizzard has to do it?  That's not how it works.  They aren't letting you vote in changes.
---
Khro! That's awesome lol
---
Don't mess with the troll if you don't want the bones?
---
On image 32 they're talking about how they extended the queue limits and clarified the error message because they expect some server QUEUES to be full.
---
I’m also curious about the need for engineering.
---
There's 0% chance that BC is not the followup to WoW Classic. They will totally change some details/numbers, but there is no way that Blizz will completely reimagine the content. People would much rather have BC and T4 content than whatever the Classic team thinks up.
---
But certain classes are likely to have a higher tendency of it.   Warriors are OP as fuck, and by far the most in demand.
---
I hope it's a dwarf female with the constipated face. :)
---
Now I'm wondering if we can create more characters while we wait or if the 3char limit will still be in effect until the servers officially launch.
---
It’ll be really interesting to see what happens to the game once classic becomes stale again. I wonder if they’ll keep classic servers and then roll out TBC Classic on other servers and offer a free character copy or transfer?
---
You can login, choose a Realm and create up to 3 characters.  But you can't enter the world until the launch date.
---
WTT Herod name(s) for a Stalagg name

\*me trying to see if I could resurrect my addon from TBC\*
---
Not only is this stupid because there aren't any world firsts to be had, it's stupid because they're going to encourage sniping even more than otherwise.
---
That may be the only reason worth watching. This is going to be an absolute train wreck.
---
Seriously guys and im not joking here SLEEP. Once a 24 hour stream is ok but after 48 hours of no sleep you seriously endager your health, not to mention the cognitive decline. Also make sure you move while playing (easy thing is for example make 25 pushups every levelup and 30 minutes walk every 10 level).
---
Good thing you aren't forced to participate, you can enjoy it slow and steady just like I can enjoy it hard and fast. It's sad that you hate that other people enjoy a game differently than you.
---
Eh, there were definitely guilds that put TF on rogues back in the day.  The ones I was in always put it on main tanks, which was generally correct.  
---
If Blizzard had made it 2.4 speed or higher, it would have been extraordinary on rogues- possibly BiS or something.  By contrast, a tank getting BiS from something like this feels more like a guild accomplishment.
---
Don't you need shit from BWL to make the sword?    Also, it takes literally almost year on average to get a single TF!
---
It destroyed the capability people had to meet strangers that lived on their own server. While most people were fine sticking to their guild for social stuff, youd be reminded that there was a community around you when running to dungeons with pugs. Friend lists had a purpose.
---
I've just about had it with your holier-than-thou attitude.
---
The person who actually gets world first is going to be some random loner guy who isn't affiliated with these commercialized streamers/guilds.
---
OSRS has spoiled us with its democracy... /s
---
The tank shortage in 5 man's only gets stronger as the endgame goes on.
---
Yes. This is generally why all the physical dps classes have talents than increase their crit damage by a relatively small amount and the caster crit damage talents are 100%.
---
Get the winterspring sabre mount. It's an unreasonably long rep grind but it's definitely possible, and it's hard to get for anyone, not just non-nelfs.
---
In retail you can be whatever you want to be.
---
I didn't think he was a troll until I read his name and realized its basically DTF daddy 69.
---
Alright that makes sense, thanks for the clarification!
---
It wasn't couple of hours but it was relatively fast. Don't forget they also had BIS at lvl 30 and engineering bombs for AoE tho
---
Me and you both. I guess we're...
---
I mean, I'm not even a newbie and it made NO sense. Special class for me it is...
---
Your math is WAAAAY wrong. Even if you raided straight for 6 months, MC clears, assuming a 1.8% droprate, that leaves you with a 4.33% chance of seeing each individual binding drop.   
---
Every time you try its still a 1.8% drop rate. Doing it 26 times doesn't increase it drop chance.
---
Yeah my thoughts exactly. At least they said catch-up items won't be added until in p5.
---
If you want to get close to it, I have an extra one in one of my toon's banks on retail (farmed for ages and finally got it, then had a second one drop the following clear while i was in there still trying for the raptor), I can put it in *will not be traded* for you :D
---
well i feel sorry for whoever does want that.
---
I'm pretty sure vanish doesn't remove hunter's mark.
---
Great job. 
---
I just had a flashback to that questline that made you swim across that cove like 4 times
---
Most of us were pretty garbage players back in the day.  A lot of us probably felt like we really needed those buffs because they made up for poor play.

They haven't said anything about increasing the concurrent player cap. In fact the only thing they have said about it is that each layer will be one vanilla server's worth of people. You are looking at one thing "Retail realms have more people in them" and turning it into something it isn't.

#ATTENTION REPLIES:  OP IS RIGHT, THE SKY IS FALLING!
---
Just add TBC and Wrath as lvl 60 zones but removing some of the things we don't like, like flying and lfg
---
No they can't. I've read up on sleep deprivation, there was actually somebody who went over 200 days without sleep.

#nochanges

MSN messenger in the systray, good old days!
---
1) you’re a grown adult who acts like a child
---
2) If me as a 17 year old kid thought it was EZ, it’s pretty sad that you still found it challenging
---
3) I’m not the original OP, I only offered my input because you were nearly having a brain aneurysm over the fact that he didn’t enjoy WoW after Mists
---
4) go take a breath of fresh air, it’s clear you’re in dire need of one
---
Yeah.  It's the same of stuff like how Hunters should probably not take a Striker's mark Phase 1 over melee classes.  Sure, it's an upgrade to a blue, but even at that I'm not even sure it's a good bow because of the sub 3 second attack speed and I think there are better options like blastershot launcher.
---
Lol, this is great.
---
Did you even bother to check the link? Because they do have a fully fleshed out dkp system with all their raids registered. And their first rag kill was exactly as he described (it’s aprox 1 month after the world first).
---
So basically you just went on the offensive for no reason and made a fool of yourself.
---
To the fellow vanilla raider who killed Rag on May 27th: well done! And you guys even got the Eye of Sulfuras on the first kill :)
---
Despite how boring, monotonous, and frustrating WoW fishing is, I’m actually looking forward to it again.  Westfall and the Barrens were some of my favorite spots to fish, especially at night.  Was the Fishing Tournament in Vanilla?  I forget.
---
Entrance to RFC is in The cleft of shadow. Also the flight master is at the top of the building north of the bank.
---
I mean, method cleared out 3 realms for BoD world first.
---
They have a lot of reputation to borrow against. Like a fuck ton.
---
No, it’s by no means impossible. 
---
As a mage it’s only tiresome until you get teleport.
---
Run to NE zone, grab every flight path, leave your hearth in Ironforge. Level up as long as you can, hearth back and get talents, then make the trip back to NE zone. Rinse and repeat until you get teleport and then just have a hearth wherever you are questing.
---
It will substantially cut down on the number of cloth turn ins you have to do.
---
Username checks out
---
No, it's not, because rogues benefit more from gear than hunters do.
---
lol what? Method is going to standard world first races, that doesn't even make sense...
---
Here’s my take. I told all of my friends that they are really underestimating the level of commitment this game is going to take. I really think blizzard knows this too, and that’s fine. Most of my friends that are the most excited about playing capped out at about BWL level and/or rerolled so many times that they could never stick with or do any end game 60 content. Having the 1.12 release is going to help tremendously, so that’s good.
---
But I think that when it takes 3-4 months of playing and struggling to level to 60 on PvP servers when people hardly have time to play and they’re either constantly getting ganked, or falling behind, etc. it’s going to put a huge damper on their nostalgic feel. Mainly because they can’t no life like they did back in HS/College. 
---
ALL of that being said. I was a naysayer and did not think it was going to be a great idea because the game has added features to retail to make it more accessible for the times. There just simply won’t be much extra time for other recreational activities during the leveling process. But then I realized that once it’s end-game. You can do your stuff and you’re done. There is no pressure to log on every single day to daily grind faction rep. You can essentially be a raid logger if you have the in-game resources, or things on farm.
---
Granted the thing I’m most excited about is being part of a community again. Having people help, and helping people out. I’m currently unemployed and rolling a tank. I’ll be standing by for my guild/friends at every turn to spam run dungeons to get pre raid BiS and help with anything that they need.
---
I think people really just need to take a damn chill pill. The games gonna be what it’s gonna be. #nochanges is a great thing for phase 1-6. We will all see what happens after that.
---
its good if you want the undead mount, since at higher levels you get lower rep from low lvl quests.
---
It still took 1-2 hours a level in dungeons per level. It was a similar pace to good solo levelling. Nothing near a couple of levels for 10 levels which would be ridiculous.   
---
The reason it takes non hardcore players months and months to level isn't because of their xp/hour. It's because of their hours/day they play.
---
I mean cash money = cash money
---
Princess Huhuran is a hearthstone card.
---
If I see maintenance I’ll just go to work for a couple hours or take a nap... it’d suck but...I could make the most of it
---
Any other paladins out there fall in love with shard of the fallen star?  That spell damage pally video was something else...
---
will check tonight ty
---
Yep, if the enemy has armour sunder is worth more than heroic strike. 
---
If the enemy doesn't have armour it's dead before you have enough rage to waste on heroic strike.
---
🦀🦀🦀15$🦀🦀🦀
---
I still have General displayed at all times but Warlord was the one I really wanted.  
---
Maybe work will let me do it again...
---
Love ZG fishing!  I caught a mage tome there, at least once.
---
Thats not at all what op is saying. The truth is that there are people who have the lost wife quest and the war chain memorized to a t.. And it COULD be refreshing to renew the mystery that was in the CLASSIC experience.  Accurate as possible would mean we wouldnt know as much as we do, like back then.
---
Ah okay, so you still have to grind rep for Darnassus? Isn't that only possible if you do all the quests super early on though before they turn grey?
---
There's an Inn keeper there? :O
---
In vanilla as a hunter my rep as being a successful party leader. Helped me make several pocket tank and healer friends for scheduled runs.
---
It's in human nature to feel someone else is being a dick but. I know personally having played all three roles since vanilla people can ultimately lead to the attitudes tanks and healers have for many reasons.
---
Granted their are just entitled tanks and healers out their along with dps. 
---
Make friend's and form groups my recommendation.
---
So how are they going to do expansions or are they?  If so, when or how often will they be releasing expansions because at some point its going to end up right back to where we are now in normal release.
---
Was it phantom hourglass?
---
Most people get exalted by turning in runecloth at level 60 mate. You won't get the saber at 40, but you can get a saber. You also have War Mounts for rank 11, Winterspring saber, and Zulian Tiger to get sabers.
---
thats europe where they just opened 1 new realm. in NA they opened stalagg, then another 2 realms (skeram/blowme)
---
My bad! Cheers out-dated private server info! ♥
---
Coordinates. Nothing else.
---
Dude. You came back 2 hours after I had finished just to tell me to take a break?? 😂😂😂
---
Probably so no one complains when they cannot log on at 12:01AM on the 26th.
---
Would never play one myself but I don't have a problem with them being there or anything. Can't hate on my fellow ally buddies.
---
ive never really played on an oceanic server that had japanese people on it
---
i guess whatever server has the best ping?
---
any of the asian servers have good ping? but yeah if its us or oceanic id prob pick by ping
---
Yeah, tried to recruit a bunch of old grpup.  Got Haruka, Cavos, Drackaine, Elwynta, Cazukeil, Boinkor, myself (Rankil) and we even got Baird to come over from Ropetown to join us.
---
I was playing as a night elf hunter and quickly met a NE warrior. At some point, he went off to learn weapon skills in Ironforge (we were questing in Darkshore at that point). When he came back, he was telling about this amazing city he found that was super medieval themed with a CASTLE. I wanted to see it so bad. So we hopped on the boat from Auberdine and then got on another boat. And I saw it, this beautiful city. It was much different then Darnasus' splendor. I was so amazed at this new place. The name: Theramore. We quickly bound our hearthstones there and went out to explore this new wondrous land...
---
Where we quickly aggro'd everything and it took us so long to corpse run the like 20ft back into Theramore.
---
It's that last week before launch rush of panicked Chiken Littles grasping at straws to complain about because then they won't have anyone left to read their falling sky posts, since we'll all be happily playing and shitposting our first green drops.
---
Forget him (them) man you were right on the money
---
Ah that's perfect. So I don't have to bother with going to the NE starting zone right away, but just have to put in a shit ton of time once I get to this level/quest?
---
My first short ban came after telling dead baby jokes in trade chat. And there was every gradient of awful leading up to that so yeah, I was uninhibited and they were more tolerant back then.
---
The most important thing in Classic is to not forget your Onyxia necklace in the bank.
---
The buff quest is after the quest reward from Thrall.
---
They gotta step out of the dungeon at some point ;\^)
---
Queues will happen if people don't quit.
---
Wow if pallies got that holy strike they wouldn’t be as bad in vanilla. Sort of like crusaders strike
---
Don’t worry. We aren’t all like that. I think you’ll find the classic community a lot better. It’ll be filled with adults who are playing the game for nastalgia/it’s the greatest game they’ve ever played. 
---
I will work to change the narrative that all tanks are douches.
---
What do you do with excess rage?
---
Fucked zoomers with theirs bfa
---
Oh hey now, I was not involved, my friend. I am very much a respectable member of the community.
---
Just most of the people I know who also played female characters were not.
---
Bs
---
That sucks man. I always kept changing jobs til I found this one and I’ll be here for life because the salary is great and it’s a permanent gig for me. Keep looking for jobs even when you get that next job that is good !
---
6x4 = 24 attempts. Chance of not getting the drop = 0.982.
---
0.92^24 = 0.982 ^ 0.646 to not get the binding, thus 35.4% chance to get it.
---
Sounds like your math is wrong.
---
&gt; If dungeon spell/melee cleave works to speed to 60, people are going to be geared well enough to walk into MC 
---
Dungeon leveling is going to be slower 100%. The videos promoting it had Warriors solo questing at pretty much the same speed as them dungeon grinding. So their going to be leveling as slow or slower than the slowest leveling class.
---
&gt;Our first Rag kill was May 27th 2005 with 28 people. 
---
You had months of clearing MC.. People in your guild already had 4+ pieces of MC loot by the time you killed Rag. I imagine people in half preraid BiS and half MC gear would be able to do MC with 28 people.. I don't imagine people in quest greens will be able to do MC with 20 people.
---
It was literally the same stream they went from 30-40.
---
So much of this. I've wanted to acquire one ever since my brother got me the ashbringer comic
---
For Onyxia? It is not.
---
Thank you kind person, not only days after the initial post, but also for such an in depth and well reasoned response.
---
This has set my mind at rest; again thanks for taking the time.
---
Two groups of us maybe \~ 50 total just opted for Skeram and took characters off Herod. Skeram has a few things going for it. It has a solid name, it is currently medium pop 5 days before servers go live, and should only go higher. I believe it will have a healthy population for months into release. The safest server is obviously herod, but that doesn't guarantee you'll be able to log in at a reasonable time. We are still keeping herod as main option, but Skeram is the go to backup if queues are as bad as blizzard has alluded to. I would recommend for others on Herod to have a back up server (if you can't tolerate long queue times).
---
&gt; Lol? What kind of argument is that? I can say the exact same thing back to you.
---
No you can't, because it doesn't work.  My argument is "don't change things you don't have to change to get the game working".  What are you saying to that?
---
"You *not wanting it changed* isn't a valid reason for them to not change it!"
---
Uh... yeah it is.  Classic WoW is based on an existing game, data, sets of quests.  There is a framework for how it works.  They are trying to recreate that as exactly as possible.  Changing shit just because they can goes against their entire philosophy of giving us that 1.12 type experience.
---
No, trying to make this into a big deal is stupid.
---
introduction andrew
---
....im both shocked and sad...
---
Buit extremely thankfull to all of you who spent time answering....thanks
---
First toon was a tauren warrior. Levelled all the way up to 12 without ever learning any new skills. In the barrens I saw an orc warrior perform 'charge' and immediately ran up to ask him how TF he did that.
---
He was kind enough to tell me and also told me where to go to train.
---
Still makes me cringe how many hours it took me to finish all the mulgore quests with nothing but heroic strike :/
---
Why would Tier2 items drop in MC? Like which tier2 except pants drops there? Im so confused at 01.00am
---
Wait 15 years till that becomes the default UI
---
Do you understand the reference we are making?
---
&gt;_"you"_
---
This is literally straw man at this point. Your persistent use of "you" isn't just disingenuous at this point... it's LYING. You are lying to yourself and probably are hoping to trick other people reading this thread. This is far beyond just me.
---
There's different crit caps for different things. The crit cap for yellow damage (abilities, such as heroic strike or bloodthirst) is effectively non existent (~95%). The crit cap for white damage (auto swings) is much lower at ~38% (still basically impossible to obtain). These numbers are different because white hits and abilities use two different attack tables to resolve. Less important is the crit cap and more important is simply understanding the one and two roll systems for attacks. You can just google attack tables for vanilla WoW or something if you want to know more.
---
To get in the right mindset I’ve decided to play games that came out around the vanilla release. Looks like halo 2 and half life 2 both came out the same month!
---
You clearly didn't use the internet much back in 2004. You couldn't play a game on Xbox Live without hearing constant hard-r's from 12 year olds.
---
Uh you can see it in the video dude he hit like a 160 lmfao
---
they won't be cleared immediately though.  theres way more in this design space than I see credit being given.
---
its cool though its my 2c i dont need you to agree with me / vice versa!  we have til sometime after phase 6 til any of this happens anyway so until then have a good classic!
---
Do you guys not have phones?
---
They may be shit, but people will still pay an arm and a leg for them because they're purple
---
Sure.. you can't gouge some dank basement dwelling weeb for 500g, but you can still make a pretty penny
---
Arcane shot too.
---
Any alternatives to this to get addons up and running?
---
And yet it happens slowly, over time, and with much less intense activities. Holding a phone while standing- you'll crane your neck, round your shoulders slightly. 
---
Unless you're physically reversing those "stretches" via your own stretching or activity, it'll only get worse
---
That cleared up a lot of my doubts.Thanks for a detailed answer!
---
These competitive paces aren’t going to matter on servers that are absolutely thwomped to the gills with players stumbling over each other and likely blizzards very traditional server restarts / shutdowns at various random times. If it were me trying to blitz levels I’d either focus on aoe dungeon grinding or simulating level 30-60 because hopefully by then people will be scattered to provide a much more realistic leveling experience.
---
You're wrong. And I hope you admit you're wrong on launch and not try to play it off like everyone on this sub. "STALAGG WONT FILL, YOURE AN IDIOT IF U DONT SWITCH TO STALAGG".
---
I'd be generous and say at least 50% of players haven't subbed or created characters yet.
---
The second way you prove you've lost an argument is to drag out the phrase "straw man".
---
Ahh yeah fair enough. Will just have to set it all up while on flight paths and stuff lol
---
Game releases on Aug 26th at 6pm for NA EST btw
---
nICE
---
Well, if you feel guilty, I guess you know which way your heart is leading you!
---
A lot of it will depend on what class you will play. Classes that bring utility like a hunter, warlock, paladin or shaman are more missed than a mage or rogue. But even without a fixed raidingspot you can still pug MC/ZG/BWL/AQ20. 
---
There will be many pugs organised by experienced people who are splitting raids for Thunderfury and BWL trinkets/weapons.
---
Once your name starts sounding familiar in those pugs you'll get invites easily and not joining for a week will be no problem.
---
Winterspring Saber is where its at.
---
It was not explained if there is a delay by inviting a player. It was aonly specified the logout problem :(
---
Same here. Made a gnome just to humiliate the entire horde :)
---
Scandinavian community has choosen Firemaw as the server now. Many Danes and Norwegians are heading for that server.
---
At least back when I had to spam cities needing a tank I had the chance to get someone who didn't necessarily want to tank but could swap specs. The multiplayer interactions have been removed.
---
"welp.. I never wanted a kid anyway"
---
*throws baby out the window*
---
Working on mobile for me. Maybe open in Imgur app?
---
I used to play on an RP realm and I never Role played.  To be perfectly honest 15 years ago I didn't know what RP on the server even ment.  I just thought it was for people that liked RPGs.  But I never ran into ERP on my old realm.  If it was there it was kept in party chat where that shit belongs.
---
The Greater [Element] Protection Potions, Purification Potion, Restorative Potion, Lesser Invisibility Potion (different cooldown), Rage Potions, Thistle Tea, and Mana Potions should all be mentioned.
---
Amazing that someone so out of touch with their consumers is in such a high level position like that.
---
&gt; How important will it become for these guilds to make sure everyone has the wbuff when it comes to raid time?
---
If they are a competent raid group, not important at all.  I would be surprised to see people put any amount of effort into controlling the buff.
---
 [https://discordapp.com/invite/D6TrRkq](https://discordapp.com/invite/D6TrRkq)

I think we can all agree on that these people dont know, what they are missing out
---
needatankneedatankneedatank
---
Yes sir, warrior alliance or horde depending on which group/friends works out. It’s boring since I played warrior original from day one of vanilla but I tried every class but Druid or monk and I like warrior best. Only tough part is which server. Since I’m officially adult Mors I’m gonna try to stream 3 hrs a week night and as much as possible on the weekend. After 60/ raids we will see, maybe one alt. Really looking forward to a real game for once.
---
this is very funny
---
but... you should have labeled Jim as /r/classicwow .  We're the ones who are anticipating the release, not Blizzard
---
Doesn't matter here since the point was farming xp. It's okay with 4 but a lot better with 5.
---
The xp gains aren't linear afaik, the fifth player doesn't cost 1/5th of all xp but a lot less.
---
cause fuck you, and [fuck the enemy faction](https://extrafabulouscomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/sports.png)
---
That is a very cool idea! Using what they know the server already contains so that stockpiling mats will have zero impact on it! It's whatever the server currently contains plus all the extra items they have to gather!.I like it!
---
I decided I want to roll on a PvE server and be a carebear because I thought it might mean less people in queue and no streamers around with giant groups of people to gank me or spamming chat with nonsensical crap. I was planning on waiting a week or two before trying out Classic but let's be honest here, I sit at home all day thanks to my shitty disability trying to find something to do, Classic is literally the thing scratch my itch and sadly I already know I'm going to try getting on either the first day it releases or the second day.
---
Yea i am a Mage \^\^ thats why i want to go for that.
---
It modifies game files, doesn't it?
---
ITT: A bunch of people who didn't actually play vanilla WoW for this event, have no idea what all went into the quest line involving the Scepter of the Shifting Sands, and didn't spend 6+ hours having an absolute blast in the carnage, lag, and insanity that was Silithus during the Opening event.
---
Except for MC I think veteran private server guilds can clear each new raid within hours. Encounters might be a bit different, but I doubt it will slow them down all that much.
---
Or being an alliance priest.  WoF is broken.
---
LOL! This was around the time where I didn't know what I was doing. SO I had to take notes on what everything meant XD
---
One thing you gotta remember is that you need to set your pace quickly and get ahead of the curve. The sooner you get past other levelers, the sooner you have grinding spots to yourself. You're at a fine pace, but are you going to be able to maintain that pace with tons of other people all competing for the same mobs?
---
Yes :p
---
The better question is; is that hard to *accept* that some people enjoy Retail WoW? No, no it isn't :)
---
“If you’re smart” you’re clearly not. His response was... imagine logging out real quick and being forced into an hour plus queue. This could happen to anyone at anytime. Thought you had to get off but turns out you don’t so you hope back on. Log off for some food and hop back on. Go pick up the kids from school and hop back on. I could go on....  it has nothing to do with being smart. Lmfao. Get outta here with your bs comments.
---
FRESH would require me going to the store more often
---
i just find it kind of funny people can sit for thousands of hours probably throughout their lives and still not know how to do it properly.
---
You can make money with *any* profession if you have the right recipes.
---
I was reading through this and was confused.  From vanilla I remember getting skill ups from lower areas, it's just you can't get skill ups from areas that are higher than your skill.
---
software engineer says its not necessary.  reddit user disagrees
---
Just made mine. His name is Jpmorgan...
---
The goal is 8-9 hours to 20 so your close. It hurts that you are doing the greater wand alone.
---
Seeing those skeletons was critical on pvp servers and very immersive. Please reconsider.
---
You can dps pretty reliably by the time you get mind flay. Just know that sometimes it’s just less of a headache for you to just heal. Which you also can very easily do as shadow spec. Sometimes it’s annoying to find a healer and it’d be equally irritating to technically have one who simply just refuses to.
---
How do you wake up at noon on Friday and get to a noon class?
---
I've been on the internet every single day since 1995. To me there is basically less people giving a shit about what people think of them. When I played Quake, Everquest, chatted in AOL/IRC, gaming forums, anywhere I never once saw anyone spamming the N-word or lambasting about why woman/certain race are garbage. It's as if people actually cared about their reputation and people just ignored the anonymity of the internet. In the early days of wow I saw being become ostracized for loot stealing for example and they had to stop playing their character because no one wanted to group with them. Perhaps people knew they would face the same fate if they also went on a racist rant.
---
Good joke
---
A server wide event that had people racing against other servers and along side the enemy faction is so massively different from what you're talking about, I'm not sure you understand why people are ok and even want that change. It's not "just cause." It's to stop the massive stockpiling of mats for months before the event - people would rather play with a new set of mats so the server is teaming with players everywhere gathering, etc.
---
This subreddit has gone full normie
---
Well, I mean. That's a sick name
---
Guild spam, gold farm websites, curse words, and more... All waiting for their glorious skeleton font. Lol.
---
"Why do \[insert strictly anecdotal and utterly baseless statistic\]?"
---
No way am I going to update drivers or make any material change to my computer.  I know how that story ends.  It ends with tons of problems because I didn't leave good enough alone.
---
This is a great guide! Few things I wanted to add/suggest about your leveling build.  
---
Going 4/5 Thundering Strikes and dipping early to Imp Ghost Wolf would be a touch better to get that early faster cast speed. Getting Reincarnation before Totemic Focus would help when you want to make use of it more (unless you're certain you're not dying often enough to make full use of it). Putting 3 points into Nature's Guidance asap is pretty important for that hit% on spells AND melee (personally I dip into that very early, hit is EVERYTHING while leveling)  
---
But that's just me, this is still a very solid hybrid build!
---
yea true its about fast and efficient pathing glitching wont help me :)
---
And some people like pineapple on pizza. There are a lot of crazies.
---
Yeah his math checks out!
---
I just wanna get in and out of STV before the gankfest starts.
---
at the point that your guild can get it, it literally doesn't matter who it goes to! So we gave ours to a druid who had been there through thick and thin. He became a bear tank officially the day he got that staff :)
---
Having to find a tank, or people to help you in general is part of the fun. It causes a sense of community to form. Now you can one man hogger. I've been playing retail lately and on the "hard" quests they give you an NPC companion to help you. What's the point of playing a multiplayer game that encourages solo play?
---
Not fast enough.
---
Sounds great :D
---
Haha, what is it with this thread...
---
Do you got a shit bucket? No? See that's your problem, you get up to use the bathroom you're not playin wow. Shit in a bucket, you're playin wow.
---
Pussy? You getting any? Yeah you gotta stop that too...
---
You got a job? Yeah? No.
---
If I was you I would feel embarrassed to say something so ridiculously pathetic. You continually can't counter any points made so you respond with completely outlandish comments like "you used debate terminology so I won!" What??? What planet are you from?
---
Well fuck we need to spread the awareness
---
So you don't have to learn any non-fish cooking recipes to get to 150? Like do you need spices or random herbs to cook fish? 
---
Thanks for the info!
---
My toaster could run classic. You're fine.
---
I'm using Arch. The only thing I could see causing this problem would be the fact that my laptop has one integrated graphic card on the intel CPU + one NVIDIA GPU (GeForce GT 650M). I never bothered configuring hybrid graphics because I didn't plan on gaming with my computer, and the Arch Wiki pages related to hybrid graphics are pretty cryptic for me (I'm not a power user by any means). I don't even know where to start actually, should I try installing Bumblebee, or NVidia Optimus, or is there something else that does the job better...
---
I just assumed my laptop uses the integrated GPU by default, so during step 3 I only installed the dependencies for Intel (but they encompass the dependencies required for NVidia GPUs anyway).  
---
I managed to launch Classic a couple of minutes ago, I could hear the music and the WoW cursor but my screen stayed black.
---
Thanks mate! Yeah ill be keeping it 1k needles after what ive learned here :)
---
The sharding isn’t permanent, it’s only a temporary “fix” to deal with the massive amount of players in the beginning. Also, there’s still going to be enough people in your layer that you will still be able to socialize with and have to compete for resources for that “true” mmo experience. If you’ve ever played on a fresh server launch, you’d understand that having over 300+ people in a starting area takes away from the mmo experience. The “competing for resources” claim means literally standing on top of a cactus apple with 45 other people around you trying to click it before you do. In my opinion, it can be a great way to deal with the first few weeks of gameplay if it’s done right.
---
Nope.
---
Oh the nostalgia....
---
Theres lots of action bar addons that could get you pretty close. Best bet would be to try some different ones out, hope ya find one!
---
No it isn't a fact, it is your opinion and it is a incredibly whiny one. Do you work for free? This may be a game but the same free market principles that govern most of our lives govern much of this game. You are free to do whatever you want, and if you don't want to use a tank that reserves gear then that is your right. Don't act like other people are being selfish because they won't tank for you for free. You just come across as whiny. 
---
If someone has a job and kids they don't have time to run the same dungeon 15 hoping to win a roll. If they want to reserve gear before investing the time it takes to complete a dungeon then that is their right. If you don't like it then go play BFA and get auto grouped with a tank. This game has a social element that just might not be for you.
---
We're beyond bias at this point. Nothing you say is rooted in facts, everything is conjecture and dressed up personal opinion :p
---
I've said it like 5 times now, I absolutely understand feeling this way, and wanting something real bad. 
---
&gt;I regret to say that simple fact makes all other arguments moot in my opinion. If this is to last, there is one option. You can make side arguments about how it could still be good, but you cannot argue that the game will not be guaranteed to die. That is simply the truth.
---
Dude.
---
Will there be anything added to retail along side with Classic for nostalgia? Such as replica versions of old unobtainable items such as OG Corrupted Ashbringer? Also will Corrupted Ashbringer be in Classic?
---
What if people just camp them 24/7 lol.
---
They've all just got so much going for them, the actual fulfilment of class fantasy makes them all so appealing
---
&gt; we have til sometime after phase 6 til any of this happens anyway so until then have a good classic!
---
100% and going to love every minute of it. Have a good one 👍
---
lmfao what
---
Absolutely not. It became hyper sanitized.
---
I already use Reshade, does this same thing but better
---
What? Did you just completely miss the posts saying they hope for them to change some of these things?
---
I love how I scroll down a little and see you say:
---
"The problem is that you refuse to see any point of view other than your own as possibly right."
---
And then the rest of this thread is you throwing a bitch fit over the fact that there's more people who want it changed than don't.
---
Classic will be the death of retail so it doesn't really matter what happens to it.
---
I mean how would you explain late game gear progression for classic as is? New gear only comes from raids.
---
Yea but you will need new zones and new quests and it'd be pretty cool to have epic quest chains bringing you everywhere that give you a new talent.
---
Necromancers and HORDE ONLY ORC (in spirit)  DK's would be sweet, the Second War guys like Teron Gorefiend in human corpses.
---
I'm totally in for lateral development after the Classic Phases are up. Lot's of these #nochanges people are being total mongs thinking that the game won't die in 2 years without new updates. Vanilla WoW wasn't a constant patch, there was constant class balancing and new content for players, as well as new players showing up. Classic is already starting with an experienced player base, and probably won't see a lot of new player growth after release, and is maintaining one patch for class balance choices. There's 3 warning signs to me that the game will be stagnant after the final release of planned content. I'm sure there's a few hundred or maybe even a few thousand super purists that would love to run AQ40 for 3 years straight, but that group is far too small for Blizzard to bother catering to.
---
But they are enjoying it. They are just not enjoying it the same way as you. No reason to be salty.
---
I say tauren. In 5man dungeons taunt is melee range im classic i think(as far as my limited experience knows) so the extra range helps. 
---
Extra nature resist for AQ
---
If you plan on doing competitive flower picking the +to herbalism is a must(gathering can fail)
---
And in pvp sometimes with how bursti things are that extra stam migth(in rare cases) save you
---
&gt; If this were the case, they would change it.
---
That doesn't even make any sense.  The AQ quest line is just like every other quest that requires you to go out and gather an item.
---
There was nothing fun about gathering resources for AQ.  You went out and farmed for a while, you got a box of crap as a reward for it.  You repeated that until your server finally had enough crap.  It was exactly like every other "go get me stuff" quest.
---
&gt; You can't say they're trying to give us WoW as close as they can when an entire portion of one of the biggest releases in vanilla will be over in a matter of hours instead of weeks.
---
It will still take weeks of gathering.  It will just begin before the quest giver shows up.
---
&gt; If there was a 'WoW lottery' with predetermined winning numbers
---
Well there aren't any quests like that.  There are however a whole bunch of quests that require you to get specific things that you already know about.
---
what
---
Black Qiraji Resonating Crystal.  Wishful thinking =/
---
&gt; The irony here is the snowflakes are the people complaining they can't spell out shit with dead bodies lmao.
---
Absolutely no one is complaining about that, or expressing any intent to spell anything out whatsoever.
---
People are complaining that the memorable Vanilla post-WorldPvP scenes like [this](https://i.redd.it/peafav46xiz21.jpg) will no longer be possible to the same extent in Classic WoW.
---
Classic warrior levelling was fucking brutal.
---
Unfortunately theyve been here for several months
---
Isnt that the everquest model
---
Melee; but mages are the one ranged class that I love playing because of the frosty control, so that doesn't narrow it down either haha
---
Some Wrath and TBC content was made with flying in mind, so that would have to be changed.
---
That sweet sweet loot.
---
Imagine getting this tied up on one comment from a great AMA. It doesn't matter. It doesn't even register on the scale. It's that small.
---
Additionally, you are minimizing their argument when you day, "a few bad words". We're not talking some 12 year olds spelling out boobs on a calculator here, and you know that.
---
my go-to spot was always plaguelands. Tons of DF, black lotus and PVP
---
&gt; I'm 100% set on this now and I'm not switching.
---
Until tomorrow? ;)
---
There's a UI someone made for classic to replicate this.
---
https://github.com/EsreverWoW/BattleForAzerothUI_Classic
---
That particular sandbox program, had a crypto miner in it, please dont download it
---
Is the whole game classic? So we won't be getting the current graphical improvement?
---
Honestly, I think this is slightly unpopular but it might be the way they have to go. People now say they should just do TBC and Wrath, but eventually they'll end up asking for Cata. Adding Hyjal and such in the future might be the way forward, but I'm good with either way.
---
Roll grobbulus bro, it’s social paradise with epic world PvP and world events
---
Don't really care about any of this since I'll be too busy playing. But I am concerned about what server they'll be on.
---
1. Bet on one team
---
2. Gank the other teams
---
3. Profit
---
Mate it’s 2019 everyone cries about everything you literally have to remove everything that was good incase you upset some cry babies
---
😭 sad days.
---
Its already split and always was.
---
yeah streamers can´t perform that ancient technique.
---
Too bad.
---
yea thats true didnt think of that when i started classic it was already going for a year or so, so there was an established economy
---
Thanks, I'll check out your link and try to stick with it for once.  
---
Do you think I should pacman -Rs any of what I've installed so far and start again once I sort out my problem with the dual graphic cards?
---
Honestly i could care less
---
Good thinking!!
---
I was set on a lot of things last week. Now I don't even know what faction or server I'm going to play on.
---
Well with mage you can get away without respeccing between pvp and raiding. Rogue you can  as well but it is a more noticeable difference.
---
3 skeletons is a better compromise, far better than 1 skeleton per player...
---
Yes, remember raids, where multiple wipes would create whiter and whiter carpets of your guild's bones, reminding you of your failure to defeat Ragnaros, insects!
---
This is a very flavorful and beloved, memorable part of Vanilla WoW. And our computers can handle a couple of raid wipes worth of skeletons in 2019.
---
Stupid.
---
the white raptor
---
which will be un-obtainable in Classic
---
T_T
---
I mean, the gold still has to get farmed in classic, so I don't see it affecting the game any more than the ubiquitous gold buying did back in the day. 
---
I don't know that it's really realistic or even ethical to enforce this concept. There are groups of friends who will probably continue to play both retail and classic together. That will cause all sorts of problems.
---
I'll only allow elves if they're the terrible high elf model from Azshara, because that would be so funny to me.
---
"Give us sexy elves!"
---
Ha, no.
---
its the best legendary in the game
---
Absolutely TIL
---
PAGLE Q is looking like 2 hours ish if we went live today. HEROD like 12 lol
---
Hi WoWHobbes
---
No one gets to tell you what to do while your on vacation, and no one is allowed to make you feel bad for having fu. 
---
Hf gl.
---
"Our" is a strong word ;o
---
Indeed, I just keep myself away from all those tank guides and stories because tanking Sounds fun too  !! :D
---
Ne is best for alliance
---
&gt;which, when you think about it, would have barely any players below 60.
---
doubt that. You'd see a huge surge in new players just coming for TBC. You'd have the authentic experience, and having alliance shammys and horde paladins running about the vanilla servers would only serve to royally piss off the vanilla players
---
*Waka Flocka looking confused and saying okay*
---
No. The Sandbox Downloader isn't malicious, it's the files you get from the downloader that are. There whole reason for using a client downloader is to "protect our intellectual property", but in reality it's just to bend your PC over and fuck it in the ass.
---
Gathering a bunch of people together that like something doesn't mean that there are people who dislike the same thing.  They just didn't feel like showing up to tell you.
---
Getting a dozen people to support you doesn't make you right or make you get to pass whatever rule or change you want.
---
I hope he goes more into the fraud him and his dad committed.
---
He's wearing the scarlet set, drops from Scarlet monastery, most of the gear is BOE.
---
imo, there will not be any servers that remain locked at the end of vanilla content, with no further plans for anything
---
World first 60, rag solo, and ony solo for sure. Day 1 easy
---
The glory of tanking is that you'll always be in demand! Levelling is a lot easier when groups are queuing up to have you
---
I appreciate your reply, and I think you are right. With Streamers being a thing now, I could see how this would get abused with the n-word forsure.
---
Sounds like there are two upset crybabies named refutedukx and jackblack2323 right here
---
Half the people like that are on this sub now
---
I'm assuming you are NOT being sarcastic, because that's indeed the one thing stopping a streamer from doing that.
---
Wahh blizzard took away mah racism. Wahhhhhhh
---
Why would they not just add a limit of skeletons per player?
---
could not*
---
NE rep is actually one of the easier ones. There are enough quests that you should hit exalted by 40ish just by questing in that region with level-appropriate quests.
---
A lot of people suggesting cloth turn-ins but IMO doing cloth turn-ins is a far bigger pain in the ass than going back to Stormwind for skills. You will have all the flightpaths, just grab some lunch or take a walk while you’re flying. 
---
I believe for rep there is enough surplus from the quests that you don’t have to go immediately at level 1 (plus even if you do the starting zone at level ~6 I think you’re still getting 80% rep).
---
No.  there is a separate group joining transition timer that allows for people to loot the mob they just killed before, without logging out, changing layers
---
Unfortunately, no. My last day is Friday and I'm spending this week rushing to complete a ridiculous amount of work that was suddenly assigned to me before I leave. But four weeks ago? Yeah I was pretty useless.
---
Preaching truth!
---
M-my body is ready.
---
You’re my age. You call them emoticons 
---
shout out to msn messenger times! 🤓
---
saving energy for Monday.
---
They've spent the past six years doing this, of course they will world first lol
---
There are some decent feral builds which can play both PvP and PvE content too, but mage and rogue are definitely stronger with their options
---
Wicked sick visuals, too.
---
I can't say that I care all that much about Mankrik's wife of the AQ turnins since those are relatively minor, but I will say that I've played on the classic Everquest 1 private server, Project1999, for years. They tend to veer towards "no changes".
---
I have found this to be a huge mistake. In a game where the primary appeal is grouping and social scenarios, everybody solos because now we are knowledgeable enough to do so and it's simpler/faster exp. People also only level in areas that are now known to be the most efficient, as opposed to exploring the world like the playerbase did when we we didn't have decades of theorycrafting. 
---
The server would have been much better by introducing non-classic changes like a higher grouping exp bonus or rotating "hot zones" that encourage people to play in a way that is more akin to and plays to the strengths of classic. Personally I am extremely wary of changes but sometimes it is the right call.
---
Yes, but they aren't giving us a game that we get to vote on changes.  They are giving us 1.12 as they have it as close to it as they can get. 
---
Honestly, people should feel stupid for trying to get them to cram changes into the last minute.  You really want them to break the release because they tried to make some last minute changes?
---
Obviously, no reason to back yourself into a corner when you dont have to
---
So? You are able to gather the item way faster this way. About 36% faster on average in fact. 
---
What would you say if they just increased the droprate of an item by say 25% ? Yeah you'd call it bullcrap, because that's what it is.
---
you farm for it, it drops, someone ninja's it. log off crying.
---
Yes there is.
---
Why do you need people to recognize your "achievement" so much?
---
Blizz said the first two phases would be about 2 months.
---
This is the exact slippery slope that I'm terrified of. If they poll the community regularly and implement changes they want, slowly but surely we'll end up going the route of Retail. I disagree with you completely.
---
For issues like this, they don't *need* to poll the community. Obviously keeping the war effort materials the same completely kills the event. Blizzard knows this. They need to think critically about the spirit of "nochanges" and implement changes accordingly.
---
considering that a medium realm today has more people than the most overcrowded servers in 2006 I imagine it will be longer than 2 hours
---
Ok! You can keep your hate locked up in that stupid face of yours c:! You give me literally any reason to do so and I'll report you so quick, and my friends will do the same! You'll lose your character and your sub money and all the progress you made! So keep your fucking mouth shut or we'll shut it for you ^^ !
---
That's an orc.
---
Lmfao
---
Dude what the hell lmao I went to a concert of hers back in like 2013 I didnt know she played
---
You underestimate the power of social media and potential influence people would want to have over the game's decision making process.
---
You could just allow everyone to sign on for free without paying a $15 to see how many actual people are going to play on release. But many of us dont care enough to start a $15 monthly fee just to reserve our name. So... Its dooable just takes some minimal thinking.
---
Why not McDonald’s?
---
There is no such thing as the gaming experience. There is your gaming experience and my gaming experience.
---
And I guess there was also your hypothetical gaming experience where you come across the field where there may or may not be a pile of skeletons to admire and improve your hypothetical future experience.
---
I don't worry about my hypothetical future experience. That's not a part of my gaming experience.
---
Exactly, who would come to play classic wow and vote for group finder, it doesn’t make sense.
---
It would be pretty funny if Blizzard maintained nochanges but then on launch mankriks wife was nowhere to be found. I for one would be pretty flustered
---
BuT pEoPlE cOuLd SpElL bAd WoRdS wItH tHeM.
---
Which I've never seen in my entire life playing wow. I've seen gold advertisements a few times in vanilla/tbc Era but, maybe 4 times?
---
Seems extremely stupid to me.
---
Not to turn this into the non-24 support group but have you tried taking melatonin? It really helped me.
---
Yes, we noticed the last time that it was posted.
---
I believe it's named that because it used to be cooked in a cast iron pan with legs on it, so you could put it over an open fire or bed of coals.
---
Nah uhhh
---
Why are the subscription so expensive ? Can't we just pay like a 150$ on time fee and have access untill the servers are shut down ?
---
Use healing spells. Downrank if said healing spell would heal for too much to be mana efficient.
---
The strategy for healing is to let them get as close to dying as possible so that you conserve mana.
---
Hunter wpn!
---
We hope to have it implemented before release. It should be but you know how software goes.
---
You won't be able to grind much in starter zone with everyone logging in at once
---
Didn’t they say they won’t compete bc the boss fights are too easy or sth or was that just stupid shit some idiot said
---
Imp and drain tanking with a succubus is about the same effectiveness wise.
---
I'm playing healer, but since I am not an entitled bitch expecting strangers to do things for me I will have tank friends to play with.
---
"You are nochanges correct?" 
---
"And wanna keep everything as authentic to vanilla as possible?"
---
"You even added queue to not go beyond the vanilla 3k population"
---
That makes sense to me.
---
"So get rid of layering!"
---
No, we need layering for the vanilla experience.
---
Oof cringe in the wilderness
---
I don't see any DM blues in Pre raid 1
---
Non issue lol
---
Put another way: what, other than pride, stops you from actually consulting people who know the class prior to putting out the guide? It seems you spend more time defending bad choices than you spend with effective research.
---
This.  Also why anything that removes ANY form of traveling requirements needs to never be added.  The only thing that should exist is mage portals and warlock summons.
---
a week after is fine IMO. You'll still be ahead of the zerg and the vast majority of people who took time off will also be returning that day too
---
Can’t wait to roll for Ashkandi and Zin’rokh on my hunter.
---
Dalaran *did* have an entrance at the ground. It was a teleporting crystal, and it was shown to you by the first Dalaran quest. Everyone used it a grand total of one time and then forgot it existed.
---
Hit 2 and repeat
---
Well as long as I can wash it down with some morning glory dew(white monster) I guess it's fine.
---
Funnier still I bet you feel oppressed! Maybe you should go back where you belong to that garbage other place where you used to play. It'd be easier for all of us.
---
"oof" and "cringe"
---
Pot, meet kettle.
---
&gt;the entire concept of internet wasn't even mainstream in 2004
---
lol, found the millennial
---
There’s literally no gameplay being banned though, not even sure what that means
---
Your warrior "friends" really appreciate you passing on all the orbs for them.
---
That would make sense
---
Not sure why you're getting downvoted just for having an opinion.  This is a site for sharing opinions not hiding them
---
And I'm a person who's set to roll on BB
---
Wow that's amazing work. Thanks
---
&gt;There is no such thing as the gaming experience. There is your gaming experience and my gaming experience.
---
&gt;That's not a part of my gaming experience.
---
By your 'logic' then macros aren't important because it's most part of someone's gaming experience, because there are people that don't use macros.
---
It's a completely absurd and pointless argument. If you're deaf then the sound isn't a part of *your* experience, that doesn't mean that the original Vanilla sounds aren't important for *the* game experience, which is an overall average of potential experiences.
---
I’m with you! Also bought a Wow Bestiary! :D
---
Member going the first time to Hemets camp and see it full on skeletons?
---
I think you should stay away if you don't care. If people care, it will be recognized, if people dont care, nobody will recognize it.
---
Cool, will consider this
---
What dude, when does AQ come out again? Remind me
---
&gt; 2019 offended culture
---
The brutal irony in how upset you are right now over something that doesn't matter.
---
i used to have it on a troll changed it to an orc because   its TROLL XD LOL XD RAWRRRRR XD XD
---
I bought the master guide when playing nost
---
They don't want their brand to look bad when some no name guild that's been playing private servers for 10 years clears mc first.
---
Unlikely considering they'll definitely be leveling as a group and significantly ahead of the regular crowd.
---
That's assuming they roll on a pvp server which they obviously won't considering their goals.
---
I think it's way too early to talk about new content for Classic servers, but the willingness for people to run all of Molten Core just to catch people up is going to diminish over time. Especially with attunements required to even enter most of the raid dungeons in Classic (and BC for that matter.)
---
BURN IT WITH FIRE
---
HEHE
---
I'm not sure she played long.
---
this was early bc and we were level 30ish
---
presume all you want, i found it funny and it made my day
---
I think TBC would bring in some players who don't want to play Classic. 
---
I hope they'd leave the Classic servers open if they end up releasing TBC servers. 
---
There are enough people playing on private servers to fill up Classic and TBC realms. I don't think TBC would kill Classic if we had both running concurrently in the future.
---
You got plenty of pennies at this point, but here's my 0.02:
---
Y'all need to reconsider this. Seeing a giant pile of skeletons in Hillsbrad as a little nelf hunter my first time around the block was harrowing to say the least. 
---
Yes, I do remember people spelling out gold selling websites, but it was far and few between, especially with respect to the immersive quality of *seeing* danger ahead. 
---
Seriously, please reconsider. Some other folks here have made some great suggestions about ways to bring the skeletons back without allowing the losers to ruin our fun!
---
Dunno why but im just happy for you lol
---
His math looks right. What are you talking about?
---
I just got mine in bfa after 14years
---
OP's real name is Dinkles
---
i got the name "shh"
---
Alive characters can do the same tho
---
i doubt they'll happen.
---
What the fuck was Blizzards hesitation with this when for years people in droves kept asking for exactly this?
---
Yo, is that some **SKERAM** I see?
---
Damn, haven't seen one of those in quite a few years.
---
Wait are you legitimately trying to make fun of me for being anti racism? Like, that's actually the argument you're gonna go with? Nice.
---
It's up to Medium now!
---
I think you know why. Bizzard's risk management department decided that it would be too costly of a risk if it can be use for hate speech/ gold seller ads. At the end of the day, Blizzard is a company that wants to make money. Risking damaging brand image is something the board members would not approve of.  
---
As a player i'd wish they didn't make the change, but if I was in their shoes I would definitely go with whatever made the most money.
---
http://www.aenigma-guild.com/dkp/dkp/viewevent.php?s=76083b5d533259fad3afa5f9e08ce8e4&amp;e=12
---
That's our entire list of Rag kills.  
---
You had to go in the "monopoly DKP" since we did a restructure after AQ when we realized that we shouldn't be carrying over DKP that long.
---
https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/fag-suffix
---
Fucking trolled.
---
It was taken down cause it wasn't indicated that  it is classic
---
&gt;I'm alliance so i don't care
---
No shit that's the problem lmao. Other people do.
---
I thought the character count per server was limited to 10
---
I'm not passing? We split equally. DPS passes.
---
Oh right, I forgot that PvE would allow them to mostly speed level in peace.
---
Sometimes I just go buy BK food because it upsets white supremacists. Stay mad hehe!
---
I mainly asking in regards to talent tree's, should I talent into ret for faster leveling when im questing and just heal in dungeons anyway. Will not having any talents into holy make me unable to keep a dungeon group alive?
---
Yeah, that makes more sense now that I think about it.
---
I didn't say one way or the other if I cared.  I asked why you needed them to care.
---
I dislike Harrison Jones because it's a blantant example of blizzards knack for plagiarizing content that isn't there's but cutttng enough out to make it legally unique.
---
I mean warcraft itself is a blatant rip off of Warhammer, but their love of pop culture became SUPER rampant and apparent around cata and hj just stood out like such a sore thumb.
---
Yea, me too. ;-)
---
Sure, you do... Sure.
---
PRAISE SKERAM
---
Macro won't work as well in classic as unlike in vanilla, /run (or /script) is disabled during combat.
---
No way!
---
Shazzrah - Alliance
---
Golemagg - Horde
---
Sadly, as a long time user of reddit and being a gamer most of my life, it takes a lot of time for people to realize things that would benefit themselves.
---
Agree! I hope they can compromise and let the skeletons stay, im not fussed about the corpses.
---
Disabling Discord Overlay fixes it.
---
&gt;Obviously the full ones are better
---
Why is that obvious? The quality of a server isn't just the number of players.
---
funny thing is, if they DID decide to change either of these it would work better as a surprise.  If they wanted it to be a surprise, they'd have to say "nochanges" when asked about it.
---
Have nothing better to do on Monday.  Gonna give this a shot.
---
Looking forward to our STV adventures again my man &lt;3
---
The former. He is implying that the talents are irrelevant. Your provided healing spells are enough. Just make sure you have +Intellect gear on when healing.
---
How many hours for his first WC?
---
What would you do if a natural disaster destroyed your internet on launch day
---
Your hash from the image doesn't work.
---
And i just did a scan of the same file and found nothing suspicious.
---
place /giggle as the last command and you are Gucci
---
You'll find groups just fine. Don't listen to anyone that tells you otherwise
---
Played since classic, my man.
---
Not surely. Oldschool runescape hasn't gone anywhere be near rs3 and classic wow community doesn't want this to be anything like retail. I do say there would need to be precautions and limitations though.
---
There was a bit of a fuzzy answer from the AMA today, but with them saying that Bindings are dropping Phase 1, I think that means Domo chest will be available in Phase 1 as well possibly?  Should be able to get both parts and have the bow/staff quest then?
---
But if it won't be available.  But I'm not 100% on hungers, but isn't 3.0+ the sweet spot for a weapon?  So Blackcrow be best?  But I'd think Blastershot Launcher would make up in the fast attack with the better DPS and damage per shot?
---
Yes, I care about people behaving negatively against an accomplishment. That doesn't equal a need for people to react positively to it. There is an in-between neutral where nobody cares and nobody reacts negatively, and that's fine.
---
This just sent my nostalgia levels through the roof.
---
Oh really, that's very interesting. Could have just saved me rerolling! Where are you getting the info from?
---
Cool factor.  Not a character sheet stat, but it exists.
---
You're a waste of computing resources.
---
Think he's referring to [this video,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYJAkOZ4lXk) which overturns a lot of conventional wisdom about Shaman weapon enchants. Even on the slowest of weapons, Rockbiter comes out on top. You can always get lucky with Windfury, of course. But Rockbiter's better on average.
---
You can dps as any spec in dungeons if you start the group 😬😬
---
the right answer is: The rogue dude had a binding. He should of gotten to complete it as it could of been months or never till the other one showed up again for the tank.
---
&gt; But Kevin Jordan confirmed there was special code that overrode batching/heartbeat for things like interrupts and traps -- spells that needed to be executed immediately.
---
This team has access to the original source code and is in a greater position to speak about it.

Don't downplay it, rights that erode slowly can be hard to notice, and there was no reason net neutrality should've been taken down. There's no positives, and no apparent negatives yet, but it allows only for negatives (or the current state) in the future.
---
This is why the servers get fucked.
---
then you get over-zealous developers that implement shit changes that eventually lead to retail-like gameplay because it's literally impossible for a single human to gauge the needs and wants of a hardcore community.
---
HAHA. My thoughts exactly! That must've been horrible /u/ogronz
---
Lol!
---
So when I was there(which included wrath) GMs were still very much a thing. They had two departments, one that was just Game Masters, the other was more technical/billing support. By the time I left during WoD they were working to combine the two into one department, everyone was trained to do both. Even in that situation though the GM wasn’t going away, just expected to do more tasks, but a much more corporate call center environment feel to it by the time I left.
---
Didn’t you hear him?  Some guys ran the numbers!
---
Same here, yet I never saw you.  Coincidence, or layering?
---
Lmfao at all the people about to get banned because they don't want to take 15 minutes to set up addons.

Remote desktop!
---
you mad?
---
Yup I'm running 4k @60
---
I'm just kinda going on luck, I feel like some people on a realm will drop off and some are gonna thrive like you're suggesting, so I'm just banking on the more full one to be the best chance of staying that way\*
---
Because no one will let the druid tank?  ;)
---
Seriously, warriors can be a little more selective with groups because they are in demand.  You need a tank for most group content, and the numbers mean usually dps need the tank more than he needs the dps....same with healers.  This is compounded by tanks doing less group content as they get geared, and since they share less gear (1 tank instead of 3) it means it happens quicker in general.
---
That being said, I have met some amazing tanks who were happy to go out of the way for groupmembers.  Just make sure and be friendly with the good ones.

Found the eq player
---
Why are you leaving out Mila Kunis?
---
Where ever you play it’s going to be fun I wouldn’t stress it too much
---
I agree, over healing during lvling is going to a huge waste of mana. 
---
Know your spells and how much they heal, this will help with not over healing. No need to heal every if they are at 95% health.
---
Use different ranks of heals,  if rank 2 works fine no need to use rank 3. You'll save mana.
---
My favorite holiday was Halloween event due to the Scarlet Monastery turning into a giant WPVP area. The floor was just a blanket of skeletons. I really hope they fix this by then.
---
Somebody take note, this was the first day of the #changes movement
---
That's exactly what I'm doing. I'm coming back to the game, and having maintained any connections to my old party. I'm just going to show up on the server with the shortest line and play. I'll make friends and find a guild along the way, just like I did back then.
---
I'm trying to make classic WoW as new to me as possible. I'm playing a Tauren druid, I've never played a Tauren or a druid before so it will be an all new experience.
---
YES! LOL! Especially because they used Everquest in almost every way as their baseline to create WoW, they ripped off it REALLY hard.
---
I know this is a week old, but...
---
I think you're both right and wrong. Percieved hassle will stop some people. My wife doesn't want to play warlock or hunter because of the "hassle" of shard and ammo, and losing a bag slot for it.
---
But having soloed warlock 1-60 back in classic, I'd say you're mostly right. It's really not a hassle. You keep some on you, replenish as you go, and destroy them as you need bag space, because it's pretty simple to get them back.
---
To say you're a bad warlock if you run out is wrong, though. My friend mained warlock and she was part of a raid group. Providing for everyone was expected of the locks, so she'd have to farm extra. And if a raid group is trying to prog and learning a fight, and keeps wiping on a boss, it's easy enough to run out.
---
It wasn't uncommon for her to go in with nothing but soul shards and a few empty spots in her bags. Not because she was bad, but because they'd get to the boss they were wiping on and she wanted to be able to burn through shards without having to leave the raid to get more.
---
Granted, that's not a normal situation. That's 4+ hour raid nights while learning fights (or maybe undergeared) and hoping one of 39 other people don't fuck up. In general, I agree with you. I just feel you're drawing too hard a line on "if you run out, you're bad", and ignoring the percieved hassle of the classes.
---
Shit, piss, and cum. Not in any specific order and possibly simultaneously.
---
I have that old google chrome extension that changes "SJW" to "spooky skeleton" and for the first time in like 5 years, it actually made a post confusing! Go figure
---
Nice isn't the adjective I would have went for.
---
His arse
---
&gt; will it have it's own expansions that it'll go through?
---
Wouldn't that mean having a second WoW team creating an alternate universe-Azeroth?
---
I mean, the work involved in creating more story to play in an expansion is already a lot, if they had Classic-specific expansions they'd essentially be doing twice the work in terms of creating separate stories and experiences. Hell, it may even get worse for them if suddenly Classic exps are demanded to be in current-WoW.
---
Maybe they will, maybe they won't, but the idea just seems unfeasible unless they actually want to start having to refer to WoW-Classic events and maintain clarity when people (or they) speak about lore from one version or the other.
---
I love you.
---
I was set on rogue but now considering paladin LOL
---
darn it!  how'd you figure me out?!
---
Also, research 1 handed wow players. There have to be a few notable ones out there.
---
I have no experience myself with classic paladin past level 28. I would think though that it shouldn't be any problem being ret and healing non endgame dungeons.
---
 Played a lot of feral druid and should be pretty similar. As feral you can heal fine up until BRD at least. You just need to have a +int gearswap set and some mana potions as backup.
---
I was thinking classic macros would run on the same set of commands as retail, since it's built on the retail engine.
---
So can someone clear this up for me: How much hit does a Swords spec Human need? The racial bonus is 3% effective from what I've heard, the Precision talent is 5%, and isn't Weapon Expertise Talent another 3%?
---
interesting...
---
We can't have nice things because all the kids can't play nice together
---
10 days/played seems pretty excessive. I was around 7.5/played as a stupid 13 year old back in the day.
---
Classic wasn't exactly great for diversity in builds or playstyles. It's not even just stats (although that didn't help), but fundamentally missing abilities and mechanics that weren't really part of the game until they changed classes significantly with BC.
---
There's a limit to how much they're going to be able to play around with the same handful of stats (and Classic has fewer stats to play with in the first place.)
---
Cum? That escalated quickly.
---
There's a high chance that 1) vanilla will have MANY hardcore minded people playing, 2) a higher requirement of a poll (80%+) makes it so that the casual players could not overwhelm hardcore players in the decision process.  
---
That, and we already know where many choices lead.  We can see this because we already made a set of choices that led to retail.  We can now think things through with more examples.
---
Try Grobbulus. Its a RPPvP server. Going to be fun.
---
unless this was a lie amd they actually do have a few tricks up their sleeve but can't tell us right now because that would ruin the effect :P
---
herod is the horde server
---
THE RACE TO WF IS 14 YEARS TOO LATE
---
This isn't the whole truth.  You want them to *not* say anything negative about what you feel is an accomplishment.  You are asking them to be quiet and not express their opinion if their opinion doesn't support you.  Their opinion isn't any less valid than yours just because you don't agree with it, and they shouldn't be forced into silence just because you don't like what they have to say.
---
Look at oldschool runescape has 3x the player base as rs3 this is be the exact same for wow classic upto atleast phase 6 and dependent on how they go about updates either they do same sort of polling system as osrs or create new expansions with the help of devoted players wow classic will have a long and healthy life just like osrs
---
vanilla brain activated
---
Im sorry that i don't personally know multiple people per vanilla class so that the quick, for fun noobie guides can be up to your personal standard of depth. If anything that seems like it would lead to even more bias than simply reasearching the general consnesus on classes. 
---
But hey, please continue to be a complete dick to someone just trying to do something fun for the community because you disagree with a rating that absolutely no one can confirm, considering no one has played the game for 15 years. Im sure your just a blast at parties
---
haha we used to intentionally do this to piss of the GL , it was all cool we only did it on stuff like geddon and try to kill the most with bombs.
---
Although I intentionally took agro on patchwerk once, as a shaman and pushed the healers to the max-core. Didn't die either! 
---
This was also a good way to get guild kicked if you fucked around on a hardcore day or progression raid.
---
Dear MJ aka Alliance Scum, you should avoid world pvp. - The Horde
---
You honestly think Skeram won’t be just as full?
---
If you want to know what you'll look like with this gear: https://classic.wowhead.com/dressing-room#sz0V0zJ89cckRqc9m8cYZ808cXI808c4Q808mbM87kcq5808mqW808cxs808cyU808cte808ctC87c
---
Skeletons are not a core gameplay component. No amount of kicking and screaming is change that fact. At the absolute most, it’s a fringe QoL piece. It very minimally affects immersion and frankly, I wouldn’t have even noticed they were missing.
---
Their answer this in the AMA was literally, we can't because there's potential that people will be offended...
---
This guy heals.
---
Oh... I'm not sure how much I trust that data :/
---
I thought dutch were tall?
---
Yeah. So wait as a ghost for a couple min, swap layers, avoid pvp.
---
Lol, no one there has any chance other than that 1 guy that is from progress
---
It's just bullshit that developed on the private servers from dudes who haven't played anything else in like 10 years. They exhausted all the normal ways of playing the game and having fun so they developed this speed running meta thing to stay interested. Speed running is really one of the only reasons you'd put in the retarded amount of time to stay fully buffed with every consumable and shit every raid night.
---
I’ll be 7 next month
---
Im all about WoW, I always played horde, but a huge epic world of fantasy, I never understood people that played human, why would you want to just be some dude lol. Im sure human has a lot of memories for people, but I never understood it.
---
Fuck ajit pai
---
how about grow some thicker skin since words hurt you so much to the point you want to change how a video game is played.
---
I don't know what the demographics of Everquest would have been like but in WoW there was always at least 1 guild on the server that was a known harbor for trolls. I played EvE Online in 2008 and a commonly used strategy was universally called a "rape cage", the largest organization in the game had 30,000 members and was famous for lying to non-members about recruiting them for a chance to rob them blind which was officially sanctioned by their leadership, and one of the clans founded by Reddit users with 10,000 members was "I whip my slaves back and forth" to make fun of the Willow Smith song. I don't know about Quake either but I played Halo 2 in 2003 and heard constant abusive talk. If someone sounded black and someone was angry they would certainly have been called the n-word. Games like Runescape had so many players that could hop worlds whenever they wanted that no such consequences would be found for being abusive. I remember being ninja looted in WoW during TBC in the 40ish range and the guy who did it got me kicked from a later group. I played an extremely obscure MMOFPS in 2003 called Endless Ages, and I was targeted for griefing because it was known I was very young despite the community having an even smaller community than Everquest.
